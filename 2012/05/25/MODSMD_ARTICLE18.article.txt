# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## KEEP ON ROLLING Gibbs, Burdette advance again 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Just two players, sophomore Nicole Gibbs
and junior Mallory Burdette, are left carrying
the torch for Stanford women's tennis at the
NCAA Championship, as both won their sec
ond round singles matches this morning and
advanced to the quarterfinal round. Gibbs and
Burdette also combined to win their first
round match in the doubles draw.

Gibbs got an early scare on the second day
of singles play, needing three sets to beat Flori
da's Joanna Mather 3-6,6-4,6-3.
"This match was really big for me mental
ly," said Gibbs, who is now 2-2 in her career
against Mather. "She plays really good tennis
and I was able to stay with her."
Burdette dominated for a second straight
day, defeating Washington's Denise Dy 6-1,6-2.

The second-seeded duo of Gibbs and Bur
dette took care of business in their opening
round of doubles play, winning 6-1,6-1 against
the unseeded Princeton pair of Hillary Bartlett
and Lindsay Graff.
The work has just begun for Gibbs and Bur
dette, who will have to play both a singles and
a doubles match every day until they are elim
inated, or until the finals next Monday. This is
nothing new for Burdette, who won last year's
NCAA doubles championship with Hilary
Barte, who graduated last year.
Having a chance at making a deep run in both
the singles and doubles is new for Gibbs though.
"It is definitely a grind, but I am taking all the
right precautions," Gibbs said of the battles
ahead.
Freshman Ellen Tsay and jun
ior Stacey Tan also appeared in
the doubles draw, although they
lost a closely contested match
with the score of 4-6,7-5,7-6 (5) to
the eighth-ranked duo of Kristy
Frilling and Shannon Mathews
from Notre Dame.

Pluskota from Tennessee. They
have never played each other in
singles, but they have met in dou
bles in the past.

Burdette will face a more fa
miliar foe in USC's top singles
player Zoe Scandalis. While
Gibbs has beaten Scandalis in
dual matches twice this year, Bur
dette fell to her 7-6,6-7,3-6 in the
finals of the Freeman Invitational
back in January. Winning would
also give Burdette a measure of
revenge from the team competi
tion as Stanford lost to USC in the

Next up for Gibbs is Natalie

quarterfinals of the NCAA team
competition last week.

Gibbs and Burdette's doubles
match will be against Rice's Na
talie Beazant and Dominique
Harmath in the second round of
the doubles draw.
Both Gibbs's and Burdette's
singles matches will begin at 7
a.m. PDT while their doubles
match is scheduled to start at 1
p.m. PDT today.
