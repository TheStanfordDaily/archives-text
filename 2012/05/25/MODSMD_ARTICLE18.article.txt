## KEEP ON ROLLING Gibbs, Burdette advance again 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Just two players, sophomore Nicole Gibbs
and junior Mallory Burdette, are left carrying
the torch for Stanford women's tennis at the
NCAA Championship, as both won their sec
ond round singles matches this morning and
advanced to the quarterfinal round. Gibbs and
Burdette also combined to win their first
round match in the doubles draw.

Gibbs got an early scare on the second day
of singles play, needing three sets to beat Flori
da's Joanna Mather 3-6,6-4,6-3.
"This match was really big for me mental
ly," said Gibbs, who is now 2-2 in her career
against Mather. "She plays really good tennis
and I was able to stay with her."
Burdette dominated for a second straight
day, defeating Washington's Denise Dy 6-1,6-2.

The second-seeded duo of Gibbs and Bur
dette took care of business in their opening
round of doubles play, winning 6-1,6-1 against
the unseeded Princeton pair of Hillary Bartlett
and Lindsay Graff.
The work has just begun for Gibbs and Bur
dette, who will have to play both a singles and
a doubles match every day until they are elim
inated, or until the finals next Monday. This is
nothing new for Burdette, who won last year's
NCAA doubles championship with Hilary
Barte, who graduated last year.
Having a chance at making a deep run in both
the singles and doubles is new for Gibbs though.
"It is definitely a grind, but I am taking all the
right precautions," Gibbs said of the battles
ahead.
