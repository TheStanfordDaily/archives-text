## Caterpillar CEO talks leadership Oberhelman discusses strategic importance of emerging markets 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Douglas Oberhelman, CEO and
chairman of Caterpillar Inc., empha
sized the long-term planning neces
sary to run his company in contrast
with the start-up mindset of Silicon
Valley in a speech Thursday night in
Cemex Auditorium.

"We have to start planning now for
the short, medium and long-term so
we can be around for another 85
years," Oberhelman said. "We have to
deal with 10-year product cycles. Can
you even imagine that happening
over here?"

Outside the auditorium, a handful
of students protested Oberhelman's
presence on campus and Caterpillar's
business practices in the Middle East.
While introducing Oberhelman,
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
Dean Garth Saloner credited Cater
pillar Inc. an 85-year-old company
that is currently the world's largest
producer of construction and mining
equipment, diesel and natural gas en
gines, and industrial gas turbines
with having its "fingers on the pulse of
the world."

"If you want to see where infra
structure development will fuel
growth tomorrow," Saloner said, "you
should look at where Caterpillar is
getting its orders today."
During his talk, which was part of
the GSB's View From The Top speak
er series, Oberhelman discussed the
strategic value of working in emerg
ing markets, commenting on the pos

sibility of Caterpillar expanding to
Brazil, the Middle East and Africa.
"Everyone in emerging markets
right now wants to live like us, and we
want to help them do that," Oberhel
man said.

"I couldn't imagine saying so when
I first started working at Caterpillar,
but I can see the day coming when we
will have our first production facility
somewhere in Africa," he added.
The presentation took the format
of a "fireside chat," with questions
posed to Oberhelman by a GSB stu
dent. When asked what the compa
ny's three most pressing challenges
are, Oberhelman answered accounta
bility, a connection with customers
and asset allocation.

"Responsibility gets diffused in a
big company, and when it's all going
well, that doesn't really matter," he
said. "But when things start slowing
down, the finger-pointing starts."
He said his proudest accomplish
ment would be leaving behind a lega
cy of changing the company's corpo
rate culture.

Oberhelman, CEO of Caterpil
lar since November 2010, said the
most vital part of his job has been
communication. He credited social
media with simplifying the task, but
said it hasn't completely solved the
problem.
