## Caterpillar CEO talks leadership Oberhelman discusses strategic importance of emerging markets 
### AARON SEKHRI STAFF WRITER 
Douglas Oberhelman, CEO and
chairman of Caterpillar Inc., empha
sized the long-term planning neces
sary to run his company in contrast
with the start-up mindset of Silicon
Valley in a speech Thursday night in
Cemex Auditorium.

"We have to start planning now for
the short, medium and long-term so
we can be around for another 85
years," Oberhelman said. "We have to
deal with 10-year product cycles. Can
you even imagine that happening
over here?"

Outside the auditorium, a handful
of students protested Oberhelman's
presence on campus and Caterpillar's
business practices in the Middle East.
While introducing Oberhelman,
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
Dean Garth Saloner credited Cater
pillar Inc. an 85-year-old company
that is currently the world's largest
producer of construction and mining
equipment, diesel and natural gas en
gines, and industrial gas turbines
with having its "fingers on the pulse of
the world."

"If you want to see where infra
structure development will fuel
growth tomorrow," Saloner said, "you
should look at where Caterpillar is
getting its orders today."
During his talk, which was part of
the GSB's View From The Top speak
er series, Oberhelman discussed the
strategic value of working in emerg
ing markets, commenting on the pos

sibility of Caterpillar expanding to
Brazil, the Middle East and Africa.
"Everyone in emerging markets
right now wants to live like us, and we
want to help them do that," Oberhel
man said.

"I couldn't imagine saying so when
I first started working at Caterpillar,
but I can see the day coming when we
will have our first production facility
somewhere in Africa," he added.
The presentation took the format
of a "fireside chat," with questions
posed to Oberhelman by a GSB stu
dent. When asked what the compa
ny's three most pressing challenges
are, Oberhelman answered accounta
bility, a connection with customers
and asset allocation.

"Responsibility gets diffused in a
big company, and when it's all going
well, that doesn't really matter," he
said. "But when things start slowing
down, the finger-pointing starts."
He said his proudest accomplish
ment would be leaving behind a lega
cy of changing the company's corpo
rate culture.

Oberhelman, CEO of Caterpil
lar since November 2010, said the
most vital part of his job has been
communication. He credited social
media with simplifying the task, but
said it hasn't completely solved the
problem.

MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Caterpillar CEO Douglas Oberhelman discussed the long-term planning
necessary to run his company Thursday at Cemex Auditoriu. His talk was part
of the Graduate School of Business View from the Top speaker series.
"When conducting the big or
chestra that is 150,000 employees,
you can get lost easily," he said.
"You have to communicate, com
municate, communicate, and let
that information cascade down."
Oberhelman also touched on
cultivating leadership within the
company, praising its internal
strength as the reason that Cater
pillar has never had an outside
CEO in its history. He described
his managerial philosophy as one
that strives to develop "a deep set
of values" that are universalized
across the company.
"It doesn't matter whether you
are in Palo Alto, Peoria, 111., Brus
sels or Moscow; people just want
to know what the rules are, and
they want a level playing-field

where they know exactly how they
can succeed," he said.

He added that it is important
for a leader to get "direct and hon
est feedback." Oberhelman said
he has taken an unconventional
strategy of visiting plants around
the world and unassumingly ap
proaching random employees.
"As CEO, you never get any
honest feedback, 'Everything's
just always going great!"' he said.
"And I wanted to get past that."
He also touched on the topic of
innovation, and argued that it "is
nothing but a buzzword unless
you actually loosen the reins of
creativity." He went on to de
scribe a virtual reality simulator
at a Caterpillar R&D office as an
implementation of innovation
within the company.

Audience member Parabal
Singh 'l5 reflected positively on
Olberhelman's ideas.
"I loved the talk because he was
more honest than almost anybody

I have seen present," Singh said.
Protesters outside, however,
carried placards with messages
such as "The Wall Must Fall" and
"Say No to Caterpillar Violations
of International Law," attempting
to highlight Caterpillar's role in
the construction of the West Bank
Barrier and the provision of bull
dozers to Israeli defense forces as
critical grievances.
"They're supplying tools to the
occupation," said Itai Farhi 'l4,
vice president of Students for
Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER). "It's wrong to be contin
uing to profit from the stealing of
land."

While SPER has consistently
advocated University divestment
from companies associated with
the Israeli occupation of Palestin
ian territories, Farhi acknowledged
that as demonstrated by the
small number of protesters, which
at one point numbered three
the cause has yet to gain traction

with the Stanford student body.
"None of what we're saying
should be surprising to people,"
Farhi said. "People know that
there are a lot of things that aren't
right, and it shouldn't be as weird
as it seems to be to say 'this mat
ters.'"
"Those [issues] are things that
any person with a conscience
should care about," he added.
"This isn't a radical issue or even
an activist issue this is an ethics
issue."

gines, and industrial gas turbines
with having its "fingers on the pulse of
the world."

"If you want to see where infra
structure development will fuel
growth tomorrow," Saloner said, "you
should look at where Caterpillar is
getting its orders today."
During his talk, which was part of
the GSB's View From The Top speak
er series, Oberhelman discussed the
strategic value of working in emerg
ing markets, commenting on the pos

sibility of Caterpillar expanding to
Brazil, the Middle East and Africa.
"Everyone in emerging markets
right now wants to live like us, and we
want to help them do that," Oberhel
man said.

"I couldn't imagine saying so when
I first started working at Caterpillar,
but I can see the day coming when we
will have our first production facility
somewhere in Africa," he added.
The presentation took the format
of a "fireside chat," with questions
posed to Oberhelman by a GSB stu
dent. When asked what the compa
ny's three most pressing challenges
are, Oberhelman answered accounta
bility, a connection with customers
and asset allocation.

"Responsibility gets diffused in a
big company, and when it's all going
well, that doesn't really matter," he
said. "But when things start slowing
down, the finger-pointing starts."
He said his proudest accomplish
ment would be leaving behind a lega
cy of changing the company's corpo
rate culture.

Oberhelman, CEO of Caterpil
lar since November 2010, said the
most vital part of his job has been
communication. He credited social
media with simplifying the task, but
said it hasn't completely solved the
problem.

Three students protested outside a talk by Douglas Oberhelman, Caterpillar
CEO, Thursday. Students for Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER) has advocated for
University divestment from Caterpillar, citing its Middle East business practices.


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Caterpillar CEO Douglas Oberhelman discussed the long-term planning
necessary to run his company Thursday at Cemex Auditoriu. His talk was part
of the Graduate School of Business View from the Top speaker series.
"When conducting the big or
chestra that is 150,000 employees,
you can get lost easily," he said.
"You have to communicate, com
municate, communicate, and let
that information cascade down."
Oberhelman also touched on
cultivating leadership within the
company, praising its internal
strength as the reason that Cater
pillar has never had an outside
CEO in its history. He described
his managerial philosophy as one
that strives to develop "a deep set
of values" that are universalized
across the company.
"It doesn't matter whether you
are in Palo Alto, Peoria, 111., Brus
sels or Moscow; people just want
to know what the rules are, and
they want a level playing-field

where they know exactly how they
can succeed," he said.

He added that it is important
for a leader to get "direct and hon
est feedback." Oberhelman said
he has taken an unconventional
strategy of visiting plants around
the world and unassumingly ap
proaching random employees.
"As CEO, you never get any
honest feedback, 'Everything's
just always going great!"' he said.
"And I wanted to get past that."
He also touched on the topic of
innovation, and argued that it "is
nothing but a buzzword unless
you actually loosen the reins of
creativity." He went on to de
scribe a virtual reality simulator
at a Caterpillar R&D office as an
implementation of innovation
within the company.

Audience member Parabal
Singh 'l5 reflected positively on
Olberhelman's ideas.
"I loved the talk because he was
more honest than almost anybody

I have seen present," Singh said.
Protesters outside, however,
carried placards with messages
such as "The Wall Must Fall" and
"Say No to Caterpillar Violations
of International Law," attempting
to highlight Caterpillar's role in
the construction of the West Bank
Barrier and the provision of bull
dozers to Israeli defense forces as
critical grievances.
"They're supplying tools to the
occupation," said Itai Farhi 'l4,
vice president of Students for
Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER). "It's wrong to be contin
uing to profit from the stealing of
land."

While SPER has consistently
advocated University divestment
from companies associated with
the Israeli occupation of Palestin
ian territories, Farhi acknowledged
that as demonstrated by the
small number of protesters, which
at one point numbered three
the cause has yet to gain traction

with the Stanford student body.
"None of what we're saying
should be surprising to people,"
Farhi said. "People know that
there are a lot of things that aren't
right, and it shouldn't be as weird
as it seems to be to say 'this mat
ters.'"
"Those [issues] are things that
any person with a conscience
should care about," he added.
"This isn't a radical issue or even
an activist issue this is an ethics
issue."

Douglas Oberhelman, CEO and
chairman of Caterpillar Inc., empha
sized the long-term planning neces
sary to run his company in contrast
with the start-up mindset of Silicon
Valley in a speech Thursday night in
Cemex Auditorium.

"We have to start planning now for
the short, medium and long-term so
we can be around for another 85
years," Oberhelman said. "We have to
deal with 10-year product cycles. Can
you even imagine that happening
over here?"

Outside the auditorium, a handful
of students protested Oberhelman's
presence on campus and Caterpillar's
business practices in the Middle East.
While introducing Oberhelman,
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
Dean Garth Saloner credited Cater
pillar Inc. an 85-year-old company
that is currently the world's largest
producer of construction and mining
equipment, diesel and natural gas en
gines, and industrial gas turbines
with having its "fingers on the pulse of
the world."
