## ANNOYING TRENDS IN FACEBOOK STATUSES 
### 
For most people, Facebook is away to com
municate, share pictures with your best cyber
friends and enemies, make yourself seem cool,
avoid your mother's friend request and stalk
the wedding photos of your Southern friends.
But for those of us who avidly analyze socio
cultural trends in the modern, tethered youth,
certain stylistic choices in status updates have
become overused to the point where they are
just one more update away from crossing the
nebulous division from trope into cliche. Read
the critique and recognize your own crimes
the following five trends can be eradicated,
one dedicated Facebook-user/Daily Reader at
a time. Happy Facebooking!
Dear Restaurant/Strangers/
Something Else,
"You have let me down. Sincerely, Me." This
one comes in many forms. Dear People who
took all the parking spaces, I hate you. Dear
Starbucks, tell your baristas not to put so
much foam in my lattes. Dear California,
OMG thanks for the sun! Love you!!!!!
This might have been funny the first 50 times
people did it, but it's become tiresome. If the
whole purpose of writing the letter is to share
this disappointing experience with your 700
Facebook friends, then the "letter" form is
misleading. Cut the frills with an avant-garde,
minimalist posting: "There's too much foam in
my latte." Or even a surrealist text-painting a
la Magritte: "This latte is not a latte." Is it fair
to complain about something behind some
one's back? Yes, it is. But it is not fair to pre
tend that you are directly addressing the
problem when you are really just whining. So
try this for a change: Write that letter to
Starbucks or the person who cut you in line
for Fraiche and give it to them. They can't
change if you don't tell them.
Something fun that I'm doing,
but I'm going to put a question
mark at the end? Yes, please.
Why are you phrasing this as a question? If

you are having a great day hanging out with
your best friends by the new fountain, just
say that. Posting "A sunny afternoon with my
besties at the new fountain? Yes, please!" is
terribly indirect. Have some confidence, take
a stand and end your sentence with a period
like a real grown-up who actually graduated
grammar school.

Hey, Location! Missed you.
Again, just say it. Just say, "It's great to be
back at Stanford!" Just because a place is a
proper noun does not mean you should
address it directly. We hate to be the one
to break it to you, but the place you are
talking to cannot hear you and will never
respond to you. It's basically on par with
talking to inanimate objects. See also,
number one.
That awkward moment when
the moment isn't actually
awkward, but I'm pretending
it is.
You know you've done this one. The awk
ward moment when you drink 2 percent milk
instead of fat free. The awkward moment
when you think it's Tuesday, but it's Friday.
Not every moment is awkward. Not every
moment needs to be written in this "the
moment when ..." format. Like a wise, now
anonymous, freshman housemate once said,
"Awkward doesn't even exist. It's a mindset."
So lose it, and don't let me find it on a news
feed.
The "I have clearly been
hacked" status.
Once upon a time, posting a status as your
friend was really, really hilarious. Now it is a
minor crime that happens once every 5.9
seconds. It's still not funny when someone's
status update is "I smell like cat butt," or "I
love Sarah Palin." Well, it's probably funny if
you were there, but all your Facebook
friends wish you would stop posting status
es from your friends' accounts, if only to not
disrupt our ideas of static identity uncor
rupted by role-play or a fluid existence. Or
whatever.
