# MY MAN CRUSH ON JOEL STEIN

Man Crush. It's a term general
ly used to describe when a
straight man has a crush on
another man, in an idolizing way, and
I've got one on Joel Stein '93.
Okay, so I'm, by most definitions of
the word, a woman, but "Man Crush" is
the only phrase to describe my adulation
of the columnist whose first book, "Man
Made," hit the stands last week. A simple
"crash" doesn't fit, because this is not

Lolita situation and I am not creepy, he's
not quite a "mentor," because I'm pretty
sure he doesn't actually know who I am;
and it's not a "girl crush," because, despite
Stein's 300-page-long quest for manli
ness, he is technically male. Alas, I have a
man cmsh on Stein because, well, he's
the type of man I want to be.

Struck with the fear that his sono
gram-baby's penis will eventually grow to
full human form and that he must teach
his penis-baby the tricks of the man
trade lest that baby seek help from

friends' fathers or coaches, Stein decides
to embark on a journey to find his own
masculinity. If you don't know Stein as
well as I claim to, the humor writer for
"Time Magazine" has contributed to the
likes of GQ and the Los Angeles Times
and even began as a columnist for The
Stanford Daily. Maybe I look up to Stein
because I'm the type of person who iso
lates two obscure similarities between

myself and a potential idol, finds a

desired outcome and then concludes that
there is hope for me, the struggling artist
with a figurative beret and literal dreams
for semi-stardom.

So when I found out during one of
Stein s campus talks that he ako didn't
start at The Daily until sophomore

year, that his back-up plan was a life

of lawyerdom, too, and that he con-

tributed to GQ nothing less than my
dream job and the subject of my college
essay — I was certain that I too would
some day make it in this society. All
alumni should be so inspiring.

I remember the first time I met
Stein. It was just before I was ducking out
of a class to attend Stein's actual talk with
The Daily. He was wearing a brown suit,
like a monkey. And then I met Stein
again when he spoke during iDeclare

week to a group of sophomores, sitting
around him and a panel of other speak
ers in folding chairs with mediocre

refreshments that made it feel more like a
self-help slap in the face than a career
planning venture. When a former Wall
Street Journal journalist asked me what I
wanted to be when I graduated from

Stanford, I announced to the room that I
wanted to be Stein. The room laughed;
iDidn'tDeclare.

The last time I met Stein, I cornered
him after his TEDxStanford talk to sign
my copy of his book. His talk introduced
"Man Made" with just a tad of suspense
for those who haven't yet flipped through
the essays of wanton manliness, but that
was about it. He concluded that the dag
ger of unmanliness or for those of us
blessed/cursed to move through life

with a vagina know, of weakness in gen
eral is just fear of confrontation.

That's it! He didn't even read us "The
List," his top-secret list of life lessons
reserved for only Laszlo, his oddly

named penis-baby. And some people
paid a lot for those TEDx tickets.

But "Man Made" is worth the read
even if it doesn't reveal all of life's secrets
to pretty successful success and even
for those readers who aren't women
who secretly want to be dapper, stur
dy gentlemen. Yes, there are life les
sons to be learned like the impor
tance of a knowledge of American
history, particularly of our success in
wars, to the apparent perception of
manliness and Stein makes a
point to mention Stanford many
times, which will in turn make any
Stanford reader feel both special and
closer to the author. (That last one
may just be me again.)
But no, not for knowledge or
manliness or even for a Father's Day
gift should you pick up this book.
Do it for the laughs. Any Stanford

student immersed in spoiled discon
tent or mild frustration at the limita
tions of a comfortable upbringing
can appreciate Steins journey
through manliness as if in some
modem Orpheus story, rescuing his
own man-imus from himself and
from society's expectations. It's no
"Eat, Pray, Love," but it is a barrel of
laughs and will probably become a
TV movie starring Casey Affleck if
they can't get Matt Damon. The
book is a lot cheaper than TEDx
tickets anyway.

"Man Made" with just a tad of suspense
for those who haven't yet flipped through
the essays of wanton manliness, but that
was about it. He concluded that the dag
ger of unmanliness or for those of us
blessed/cursed to move through life

with a vagina know, of weakness in gen
eral is just fear of confrontation.

That's it! He didn't even read us "The
List," his top-secret list of life lessons
reserved for only Laszlo, his oddly

named penis-baby. And some people
paid a lot for those TEDx tickets.

But "Man Made" is worth the read
even if it doesn't reveal all of life's secrets
to pretty successful success and even
for those readers who aren't women
who secretly want to be dapper, stur
dy gentlemen. Yes, there are life les
sons to be learned like the impor
tance of a knowledge of American
history, particularly of our success in
wars, to the apparent perception of
manliness and Stein makes a
point to mention Stanford many
times, which will in turn make any
Stanford reader feel both special and
closer to the author. (That last one
may just be me again.)
But no, not for knowledge or
manliness or even for a Father's Day
gift should you pick up this book.
Do it for the laughs. Any Stanford

student immersed in spoiled discon
tent or mild frustration at the limita
tions of a comfortable upbringing
can appreciate Steins journey
through manliness as if in some
modem Orpheus story, rescuing his
own man-imus from himself and
from society's expectations. It's no
"Eat, Pray, Love," but it is a barrel of
laughs and will probably become a
TV movie starring Casey Affleck if
they can't get Matt Damon. The
book is a lot cheaper than TEDx
tickets anyway.

Man Crush. It's a term general
ly used to describe when a
straight man has a crush on
another man, in an idolizing way, and
I've got one on Joel Stein '93.
Okay, so I'm, by most definitions of
the word, a woman, but "Man Crush" is
the only phrase to describe my adulation
of the columnist whose first book, "Man
Made," hit the stands last week. A simple
"crash" doesn't fit, because this is not

Lolita situation and I am not creepy, he's
not quite a "mentor," because I'm pretty
sure he doesn't actually know who I am;
and it's not a "girl crush," because, despite
Stein's 300-page-long quest for manli
ness, he is technically male. Alas, I have a
man cmsh on Stein because, well, he's
the type of man I want to be.

Struck with the fear that his sono
gram-baby's penis will eventually grow to
full human form and that he must teach
his penis-baby the tricks of the man
trade lest that baby seek help from

friends' fathers or coaches, Stein decides
to embark on a journey to find his own
masculinity. If you don't know Stein as
well as I claim to, the humor writer for
"Time Magazine" has contributed to the
likes of GQ and the Los Angeles Times
and even began as a columnist for The
Stanford Daily. Maybe I look up to Stein
because I'm the type of person who iso
lates two obscure similarities between

myself and a potential idol, finds a

desired outcome and then concludes that
there is hope for me, the struggling artist
with a figurative beret and literal dreams
for semi-stardom.

So when I found out during one of
Stein s campus talks that he ako didn't
start at The Daily until sophomore

year, that his back-up plan was a life

of lawyerdom, too, and that he con-

tributed to GQ nothing less than my
dream job and the subject of my college
essay — I was certain that I too would
some day make it in this society. All
alumni should be so inspiring.

I remember the first time I met
Stein. It was just before I was ducking out
of a class to attend Stein's actual talk with
The Daily. He was wearing a brown suit,
like a monkey. And then I met Stein
again when he spoke during iDeclare

week to a group of sophomores, sitting
around him and a panel of other speak
ers in folding chairs with mediocre

refreshments that made it feel more like a
self-help slap in the face than a career
planning venture. When a former Wall
Street Journal journalist asked me what I
wanted to be when I graduated from

Stanford, I announced to the room that I
wanted to be Stein. The room laughed;
iDidn'tDeclare.

The last time I met Stein, I cornered
him after his TEDxStanford talk to sign
my copy of his book. His talk introduced
"Man Made" with just a tad of suspense
for those who haven't yet flipped through
the essays of wanton manliness, but that
was about it. He concluded that the dag
ger of unmanliness or for those of us
blessed/cursed to move through life

with a vagina know, of weakness in gen
eral is just fear of confrontation.

That's it! He didn't even read us "The
