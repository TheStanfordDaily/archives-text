# THEATRE
## 'COLOR PURPLE' ILLUSTRATES HOPE 
### – andrea HINTON contact andrea 
Amid the warm spring air
these past few days, campus
events have consumed stu
dents. TEDx talks, for instance,
inspired hundreds, while Frost
Revival and BlackFest delivered the
best of Bay Area music right to
Stanford's doorstep.
But another buzz has been
growing on campus around a show
that completely sold out weeks
before opening night. In the shad
ows of Pigott Theater, fifty audi
ence members waited as a simple
scene of rural Georgia was lit up in
pale shades of violet, and on a very
small stage, a monumental per
formance gripped the crowd as
Black Stage Theater Company put
on their first full showing of their
spring musical, "The Color
Purple."

"Purple," based on the 1982
epistolary novel by Alice Walker
and directed by Brandon Jackson
'l2, follows the shadowed life of
Celie (Jessica Anderson 'l4), first
introduced to the audience as a 14-
year-old girl pregnant with her sec
ond child both sired by her

stepfather. The only bright spot in
this child's life is her younger, pret
tier sister Nettie, but the two are
separated after their father gives
Celie to a brutal man known only
as Mr. (Logan Richard 'l5). Celie
and Mr. continue a hostile life

together that is shaken up when
Shug Avery (Doris Bumpus), a
crucial part of Mr.'s past and
eventually Celie's future comes
to town.

"Purple" is not for the faint of
heart, containing demeaning
images of women, domestic abuse,
discussions of rape and blatant
racism. But in the spots when
some of the plot-knowledgeable
audience members were clearly
nervous about others' reactions
at one tense point when a knife is
pulled on another character, a
woman sitting behind me actually
muttered, "I hope no one walks
out after this scene" the cast
handled the roles beautifully.

In fact, what made the show
so incredible was the fine line that
this immensely talented ensemble
was able to collectively walk to
make every characterization spot

on. Take Celie, for example, who
might be one of the most difficult I
girls to portray in all of musical
theater, her character forcing
actresses to convince the audience I
of her transformation from meek
and confused to bold and unhin
dered. Anderson, however, is a
star on any stage, not simply that
of "Purple." I don't think I'm
alone in saying that her incredible
solo performance of "I'm Here,"
the penultimate song, raised ■
goosebumps.
On the nefarious side, Mr.
whose short, terse name seems
to reflect his bad attitude was I
vicious from the start and
induced actual physical cringes
whenever he raised his whip.
Richard has a substantial stage
presence and equally large voice,
helping to establish him as a true
villain no small feat in a musical
production.

But the strongest of presences
might have belonged to Ladidi
Garba 'l2, whose brash character
Sofia made slapping men around
look easy. Garba was easily one of
the best performers of the night,

not to mention her palpable chem
istry with her on-stage husband
Harpo (Kelsei Wharton 'l2) in
their duet "Any Little Thing." Most
importantly, though, Sofia, along
of the rest of the cast, continually
reaffirmed the importance of
moral strength, the driving force
behind Celie's dramatic transfor
mation.
At a time when racial tension
lies at the crux of many recent
political issues and in an environ
ment where self-affirmation

remains a constant goal through
out our four years, "The Color
Purple" boldly reminds us of the
powerful force of hope, even in the
most extreme oppression. Purple,
they say, is an indefinable shade of
mystery and intrigue, of royalty
and of spirituality, but for
Black Stage, it is clearly the color of
excellence.
