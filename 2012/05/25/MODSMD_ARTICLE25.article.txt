The Stanford Shakespeare
Company traditionally
stages its spring show out
doors, in scenic and visually inter
esting parts of campus. This year is
no exception: The group mounts
"Romeo and Juliet" in a small,
sunken amphitheatre on the
Engineering Quad, with a large
tree bathed in violet lights as the
centerpiece of the stage. The setting
is intimate the first ring of stone
benches is level with the actors
and the players enter and exit from
behind the audience.
The actors adapt well to a pro
duction in the round, making good

use of the sparse scenery and the
tree, which serves as Juliet's
(Camille Brown 'l4) balcony in Act
11, Scene 2. She and Romeo (Kevin
Hurlbutt 'l4) render this and other
interactions with all the emotional
fluctuation appropriate to a hor
monal and eminently believable
young couple. As Brown told The
Daily, "Once I translated it into
modern English just for myself
it felt natural to become the
character." Brown's Juliet is consis
tently relatable to anyone who
remembers their high school years;

she is impulsive and headstrong,
the quintessential rebellious
teenager in a restrictive household,
whose infatuation with a boy she
meets at a party becomes her
whole world. Her best moments,
however, are not the expected
scenes of high passion; rather,
Brown excels at internal conflict
her marriage vows, which follow
several memorable bouts of self
doubt, are justly earned.
Hurlbutt's Romeo, too, could
be any brooding, lovelorn high
schooler decked out in a blue dou
blet; he spends the majority of the
play lamenting his romantic woes
in a typical adolescent fashion, his
melancholy punctuated by several
soliloquies revealing a more impas
sioned inner character. Hurlbutt
recounts developing Romeo's inter
nality with director Evan Dragic
'l2, which involved "lots of looking
at the text, talking about symbol
ism and all the little things [the
audience doesn't] notice." This
detailed examination shines
through in several key scenes: the
few minutes of animated panic in
the Capulet garden, a moving reac
tion to the death of Mercutio
(Mary Glen Fredrick 'l2) and
Romeo's bitterness upon receiving
word of his banishment, where
upon he lashes out at his friend
and mentor, Friar Laurence
(Francisco Maravilla 'l2).
The play is not all tears; the
company deftly captures the Bard's
sharp, often bawdy wit. The banter
between Romeo and his sidekicks
Mercutio and Benvolio (Mary
Beth Corbett 'l2) never fails to
amuse, especially as they become
more inebriated as the night pro
gresses. Corbett's stage presence is
emphatic and precise, whereas
Fredrick's Mercutio is mercurial
and animated, both providing
contrast to the more sober Romeo.

Juliet's nurse (Insiya Jafferjee 'l4)
also manages to ease the tension
among the Capulets as she flits
about like a well-intentioned
mother hen, offering equal parts
comfort and unwelcome advice,
much to the exasperation of Juliet,
her parents and undoubtedly the
audience as well.
The production's parental fig
ures span a wide range of acting
styles that, despite or perhaps
due to their differences, comple
ment each other and their way
ward children. In this rendition,
Lord and Lady Montague are col
lapsed into a single character
(Rachel Lindee 'l2), an unusual
but ultimately effective casting that
allows Friar Laurence to assume a
unique position as surrogate father
to Romeo. As Maravilla comment
ed, "there was a lot of effort
involved in carving out [the] char
acter, figuring out why he and
Romeo have this kinship." Their
relationship appeared in stark

opposition to that of Juliet and her
parents; Lord Capulet (Nick Weiler,
sth year Ph.D) is deliciously tyran
nical, and Lady Capulet (Nora
Tjossem 'l5) attempts to soothe
the tension between Juliet and her
father, but ultimately lacks the will
to contradict her husband a
subtle contrast to Montague's
strong single-motherhood. The
Capulets' version of tiger parent
ing, Renaissance-style, garners
Juliet, and by extension, Romeo,
immense audience sympathy.
StanShakes has produced, in
"Romeo and Juliet," another enter
taining, moving classic that is sure
to appeal to modern audiences of
all stripes. The intimate venue is
small, so you may want to reserve
your tickets before they sell out.
