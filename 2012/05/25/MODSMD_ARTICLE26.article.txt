## CANNES JOB a student at the fest 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
For the average cinephile or
celebrity gawker, the word
"Cannes" probably conjures
up images of svelte actors and
gowned actresses posing on the red
carpet silhouetted against a blue
sea, speckled with fancy yachts, and
the occasional renegade director.
Sure, world premieres, photo calls
and press conferences are just part
of the everyday happenings, but
what the photo-shopped images
don't reveal is the less than glam
orous behind-the-scenes scram
bling that truly makes the Cannes
Film Festival the prestigious event
that it is.

As a lowly student journalist
I've been a bit of a fly on the wall,
enjoying the people watching almost
as much as the films. And believe

me, there can be a lot of downtime.
With thousands of accredited jour
nalists attending the festival, Cannes
has a hierarchy to manage who gets
in to what screening. My yellow

badge puts me just above the pho
tographers, but at the bottom of the
ranks of the rest of the journalists.
Depending on the venue, blue, pink
and white badges all have priority
access before me. Just the other
night, I waited in line for an hour
outside, in the rain for the new
Abbas Kiarostami film that debuted
in competition, only to be turned
away when the theater became full
with higher-ranked press. (Granted,
it could have been worse. Entry to
last year's "The Tree of Life" was so
competitive that it resulted in actual
physical fights.)

However, for each minor set
back Cannes has something
redeeming to offer, like the time
some friends and I crashed a party
hosted by Firefox for their new
Flicks platform. Unfortunately we
missed the guest of honor, actor
Edward Norton, but the open bar,
fireworks over the water and excel
lent DJ made up for it. The chances
of a celebrity sighting at Cannes are
also considerably high possibly
even more so than in metropolitan
Meccas like Los Angeles and New
York. In fact, my first night here, I
took the bus back to my apartment
and noticed Bonnie Wright (aka
Ginny Weasley) standing a few feet
away with a group of friends.
Balancing work and play can
be a bit of a challenge, especially
when press screenings begin as
early as 8:30 a.m. and continue on
until 10 in the evening which, for
some films, means getting out of
the theater past midnight. The

Palais des Festivals, the central hub
for press and industry members,
offers free Nespresso stations to

recharge between screenings, but as
you might guess they only serve
espresso. In tiny cups. Maybe my
palette just isn't refined enough,
but even with sugar, the experience
of drinking espresso the French
way is not unlike how I would
imagine taking a shot of battery
acid would feel: unpleasant, yet
highly stimulating.
As a seasoned journalist
advised me at a press junket, the
more you accept that Cannes,
despite its golden reputation, isn't
actually all that well organized, the
more you can relax and enjoy
yourself. So having come to terms
with the fact that I can only fit so
much into a single day, I'm back to
feeling that same sense of awe that
I had the day I first checked in. For
someone like me, just being here is
a dream come true.
