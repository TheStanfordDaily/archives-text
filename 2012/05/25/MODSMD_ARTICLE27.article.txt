Part coming-of-age story and
part comedy of manners,
Wes Anderson's "Moonrise
Kingdom" chronicles the adventur
ous romance of two young lovers
on a fictional island off the coast of
New England. Newcomers Kara
Hayward and Jared Gilman lead a
star-studded supporting cast
including Bruce Willis, Bill Murray,
Frances McDormand, Edward
Norton and Tilda Swinton.
In the summer of 1965, preco
cious twelve year-old Sam
Shakosky (Gilman) executes a well
planned escape from his Khaki
Scout troop in order to rendezvous
with his pen pal and crush, Suzy
Bishop (Hayward). With the help
of Sam's superior wilderness skills,
the two fugitives make their way
across the island while evading the
clutches of the various locals out to
reign them in, which include Scout
Master Ward (Norton) and the rest
of Troop 55, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
(Murray and McDormand) and
local police Captain Sharp (Willis).
Alone together, Sam and Suzy
bond over a mutual penchant for
getting in trouble and feeling like
an outsider he as a foster child
and she for getting into fights at

school. She shares with him her
favorite books (stolen from the
library, no less) while he, a budding
renaissance man, paints watercol
ors of her against the beautiful
New England scenery. Yet just as
they realize their true love for each
other, the search party catches up
and forces them apart. But, as
young people are wont to do, Sam
and Suzy scheme up ways to be

reunited, even in the face of an
aggressive social services agent
(Swinton) who threatens to take
Sam away. Meanwhile, a hurricane
brews just off the coast that prom
ises to shake things up even more
for the tiny, insular community.
Awash in the vintage, sepia
toned look that Anderson favors,
"Moonrise Kingdom" is less of a
period piece than merely an exten-

sion of the quirky, off-kilter reali
ties that the director brings to the
screen. (Previous works include
"The Darjeeling Limited" and "The
Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou").
But as kitschy as his latest film is, it
feels more grown up and thorough
than anything else he has produced
to date, perhaps, in away, repre
senting a certain coming of age for
the director as well as the charac

ters.
As a twist on the Romeo and
Juliet forbidden love story,
"Moonrise Kingdom" succeeds in
capturing the playful earnestness
and awkwardness of budding
romance without being overly sen
timental. Juxtaposed with the
adults in the film, who are por
trayed as incompetent, inept and
forever loveless (the failure of the
Bishops' marriage is a recurring
theme), Sam and Suzy make
admirable heroes for taking their
fate into their own hands. So if
they take themselves a little too
seriously it's only because, well,
they're a lot more adult than the
real grown-ups around them.
Anderson fans will be satisfied
with the impeccable ensemble cast
ing and the evolution of his story
telling, and as for everyone else
here's your chance to jump on the
bandwagon.
