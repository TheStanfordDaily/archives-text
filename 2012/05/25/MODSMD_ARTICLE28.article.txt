# MAD MEN IN BLACK
## 
### â€“ alex KENNEDY contact alex: alexjk@stanford. edu 
Like most of the undergrad population
on this campus, I was too young to be
a part of the target audience of the
original "Men in Black" when in came out in
'97. Most of us were fortunate enough to
have older siblings or pals introduce us to the
comedic and badass stylings of Will Smith
and Tommy Lee Jones, and we can fondly
look back on the original as well as the
sequel. But even if "Lilo and Stich" was your
primary extraterrestrial exposure, you're in
luck, because Will Smith doesn't seem to have
aged a day in "Men in Black III." Plus, the

first 15 minutes of this movie provide a
handy refresher on the dynamic, crime-fight
ing alien duo of Agent J and Agent K, not to
mention bring you up to speed on the cur
rent state of (Hollywood) race relations.
Meanwhile, those of you already famil
iar with these secret agents and their usual
high jinks need not get anxious at the
prospect of a contrived regurgitation of the
same fight scenes and jokes. Like practically
all movies these days (including the upcom
ing movie version of "The Great Gatsby'Lsay
what?), "Men in Black III" comes to you in 3D. I

often get distracted in recent movies because
I'm preoccupied with guessing which things
I'm seeing are/will be enhanced by 3D or mere
ly wondering if such objects are 3D I'm pret
ty sure all of a few blades of grass were the only
3D parts of "Lion King 3D" but if there ever
was a movie made for that extra dimension,

this is it. Surprises were much more surprising,
aliens much more alien-y and travels through
time and space generally more absorbing.
This movie has no shortage of fantastical
creatures and even more fantastical gadgets, all
of which translates nicely to the 3D experience.
"MIB III" doesn't just stop with protrud
ing plasma guns, but continues to break from
the existing "Men in Black" canon with the plot

itself. The movie is a romp through New York
and U.S. history, driven by Agent J's mission to
stop a gnarly-looking alien assassin from
killing Agent K and ultimately destroying
planet Earth. Same old, same old pressure to
save the world in 90 minutes? Yes, but when
Agent J goes back in time to do it, he finds
himself paired up with the 40-years-younger
version of his partner (played by Josh Brolin in
an eerily Jonesian fashion), which makes for an
entirely novel crime-fighting team. And to top it
all off, these two get started kicking ass and tak
ing names in 1969 New York City (redux
with aliens).
We already knew the black suits and
skinny ties were timeless, but they're perhaps
best served with the Mad Men
esque backdrop of mod '6os decor
and secretaries in sharp pencil
skirts and fab, voluminous hairdos,
lust when you start to wonder if
this is AMC or the big screen, Will
Smith brings you back with his

witty repartee, taking his thor
oughly confused '6os peers by
storm in scene after scene. While
Agent J keeps the humor current,
Agent K and his generation allow
us to indulge some more of our
favorite aspects of the era, from
period cars to Andy Warhol to the
Apollo 13. Will Smith's acting is on
point, if not because it feels more

like Will Smith being cool than
Will Smith acting.
Though many of these scenes
are great fun, the progression from
one scene to the next relies heavily
on some relatively predictable plot
developments and an overarching
theme of secret-agent bromance
and machismo. Attempts at bring
ing gravity to the plot and its key
moments of foreshadowing often
fell flat. It's probably not a good
sign when a serious moment of
warning makes you inadvertently
burst out laughing. It doesn't help
that somber news is delivered to
the protagonists by a unicorn,
albeit a very loose and rather
bizarre interpretation of a "one
horned" being. On the other hand,
the title of this movie isn't "Pursuit
of Happyness II," and I wouldn't go
into it with a hankering for
nuanced symbolism or a narrative
that tugs at the heartstrings. If you
are, however, in the mood for some
laugh-out-loud moments with Will
Smith, some involuntary alien
dodging in your seat and an overall
fun time, then this may well be a
movie for you.

ing alien duo of Agent J and Agent K, not to
mention bring you up to speed on the cur
rent state of (Hollywood) race relations.
Meanwhile, those of you already famil
iar with these secret agents and their usual
high jinks need not get anxious at the
prospect of a contrived regurgitation of the
same fight scenes and jokes. Like practically
all movies these days (including the upcom
ing movie version of "The Great Gatsby'Lsay
what?), "Men in Black III" comes to you in 3D. I

often get distracted in recent movies because
I'm preoccupied with guessing which things
I'm seeing are/will be enhanced by 3D or mere
ly wondering if such objects are 3D I'm pret
ty sure all of a few blades of grass were the only
3D parts of "Lion King 3D" but if there ever
was a movie made for that extra dimension,

this is it. Surprises were much more surprising,
aliens much more alien-y and travels through
time and space generally more absorbing.
This movie has no shortage of fantastical
creatures and even more fantastical gadgets, all
of which translates nicely to the 3D experience.
"MIB III" doesn't just stop with protrud
ing plasma guns, but continues to break from
the existing "Men in Black" canon with the plot

itself. The movie is a romp through New York
and U.S. history, driven by Agent J's mission to
stop a gnarly-looking alien assassin from
killing Agent K and ultimately destroying
planet Earth. Same old, same old pressure to
save the world in 90 minutes? Yes, but when
Agent J goes back in time to do it, he finds
himself paired up with the 40-years-younger
version of his partner (played by Josh Brolin in
an eerily Jonesian fashion), which makes for an
entirely novel crime-fighting team. And to top it
all off, these two get started kicking ass and tak
ing names in 1969 New York City (redux
with aliens).
We already knew the black suits and
skinny ties were timeless, but they're perhaps
best served with the Mad Men
esque backdrop of mod '6os decor
and secretaries in sharp pencil
skirts and fab, voluminous hairdos,
lust when you start to wonder if
this is AMC or the big screen, Will
Smith brings you back with his

witty repartee, taking his thor
oughly confused '6os peers by
storm in scene after scene. While
Agent J keeps the humor current,
Agent K and his generation allow
us to indulge some more of our
favorite aspects of the era, from
period cars to Andy Warhol to the
Apollo 13. Will Smith's acting is on
point, if not because it feels more

like Will Smith being cool than
Will Smith acting.
Though many of these scenes
are great fun, the progression from
one scene to the next relies heavily
on some relatively predictable plot
developments and an overarching
theme of secret-agent bromance
and machismo. Attempts at bring
ing gravity to the plot and its key
moments of foreshadowing often
fell flat. It's probably not a good
sign when a serious moment of
warning makes you inadvertently
burst out laughing. It doesn't help
that somber news is delivered to
the protagonists by a unicorn,
albeit a very loose and rather
bizarre interpretation of a "one
horned" being. On the other hand,
the title of this movie isn't "Pursuit
of Happyness II," and I wouldn't go
into it with a hankering for
nuanced symbolism or a narrative
that tugs at the heartstrings. If you
are, however, in the mood for some
laugh-out-loud moments with Will
Smith, some involuntary alien
dodging in your seat and an overall
fun time, then this may well be a
movie for you.
