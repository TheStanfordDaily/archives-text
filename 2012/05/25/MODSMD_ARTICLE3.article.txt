On Feb. 15, a Toyon residential staff member alerted two
University officials that AkeenValdez, who is not a Stanford stu
dent but was living in Toyon with a resident, had been accused
of sexual assault by a female Toyon resident. It would be more
than a month before a stay-away letter was issued against
Valdez, and more than two months before he would be escorted
off campus by University officials.

The staff member reported the incident to the Residence
Dean of Toyon and Stern Hall, Arcadio Morales, and Dean of
Sexual Assault Angela Exson on Feb. 15, two days after the al
leged assault occurred. University officials suspected he was
lodging in Sigma Chi and Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) in ad
dition to Toyon.

No further contact between the Toyon staff member and ad
ministrators occurred until two weeks later, on Feb. 28, when
Valdez was again spotted in Toyon, after he and his Stanford
student host were told by the staff member that Valdez would
not be allowed back in the dorm. The following day, this same
staff member requested a meeting with Morales, at which point
Morales said that he had informed staff at Sigma Chi to look out
for Valdez, that FloMo was too large of a hall to contact and that
he thought that Valdez would stay away from Toyon after being
asked to do so by the staff member.

Scott Galey'l2, a resident assistant (RA) of Sigma Chi, told
The Daily he does not recall receiving a phone call or alert from
Morales or any other University official. Galey was not aware of
Valdez or any other lodger in Sigma Chi.
Guests who stay for three consecutive days or five days in a
single quarter in Stanford housing are required to register with
the Stanford Housing front desk, according to guest policy.
Housing strengthened policies preventing illegal lodgers fol
