# Lodger accused of sexual assault
## Akeen Valdez escorted from campus more than two months after incident 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE KURT CHIRBAS 
On Feb. 15, a Toyon residential staff member alerted two
University officials that AkeenValdez, who is not a Stanford stu
dent but was living in Toyon with a resident, had been accused
of sexual assault by a female Toyon resident. It would be more
than a month before a stay-away letter was issued against
Valdez, and more than two months before he would be escorted
off campus by University officials.

The staff member reported the incident to the Residence
Dean of Toyon and Stern Hall, Arcadio Morales, and Dean of
Sexual Assault Angela Exson on Feb. 15, two days after the al
leged assault occurred. University officials suspected he was
lodging in Sigma Chi and Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) in ad
dition to Toyon.

No further contact between the Toyon staff member and ad
ministrators occurred until two weeks later, on Feb. 28, when
Valdez was again spotted in Toyon, after he and his Stanford
student host were told by the staff member that Valdez would
not be allowed back in the dorm. The following day, this same
staff member requested a meeting with Morales, at which point
Morales said that he had informed staff at Sigma Chi to look out
for Valdez, that FloMo was too large of a hall to contact and that
he thought that Valdez would stay away from Toyon after being
asked to do so by the staff member.

Scott Galey'l2, a resident assistant (RA) of Sigma Chi, told
The Daily he does not recall receiving a phone call or alert from
Morales or any other University official. Galey was not aware of
Valdez or any other lodger in Sigma Chi.
Guests who stay for three consecutive days or five days in a
single quarter in Stanford housing are required to register with
the Stanford Housing front desk, according to guest policy.
Housing strengthened policies preventing illegal lodgers fol
lowing an "incident" that occurred several years ago, according
to a Housing representative who
was likely referring to the case of
Azia Kim, who lived in Stanford
housing for nearly a year from
2006 to 2007, despite never being
an enrolled student.
Valdez claims he was on cam
pus to work on a start-up with sev
eral other Stanford students,
which he continues to do from an
off-campus apartment.
On March 20, five weeks after
the initial incident was reported to
University officials, Stanford is
sued a stay-away letter to Valdez,
according to University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin.

At the time initial concerns
were voiced, Valdez received mul
tiple warnings to leave the campus,
including a written stay-away let
ter issued to him March 20."

Valdez denied receiving such a
letter, but did say that University
administrators had warned him
not to come within 50 feet of stu
dent residences. His Twitter feed
shows photos taken from the Stan
ford campus on March 30 and
April 16.
On May 4, more than a month
after the stay-away letter was is
sued, the Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) was called to
FloMo one of the residences
Valdez is known to have stayed in
to accompany University staff
in confronting Valdez. After arriv
ing at the dorm room where he
was staying, University staff es
corted Valdez off the premises, ac
cording to an SUDPS report.
On May 9, Fran'Cee Brown-
McClure, student affairs officer for
Residential Education, sent an
email to all RAs with a picture of
Valdez, identifying him as an "ille
gal lodger" and notifying RAs
that, "we have reason to believe
that [Valdez's] presence could be a
threat to other Stanford students."
The notice informed students to
contact SUDPS deputies if they
see Valdez on campus.
The University has not pressed
charges against Valdez; however,
failure to comply with a stay-away
letter could result in trespassing
charges, a criminal misdemeanor.
"The warnings are over," Lapin
said. "If he comes on campus
again, he will be subject to arrest."
Lapin added that administra
tors were unable to confirm that
Valdez committed any crime, but
decided to ban him from campus
given student concern.
"While the University has not
been able to verify any criminal
conduct to date, Stanford takes
any concerns voiced by students
seriously," Lapin said.

asked to do so by the staff member.

Scott Galey'l2, a resident assistant (RA) of Sigma Chi, told
The Daily he does not recall receiving a phone call or alert from
Morales or any other University official. Galey was not aware of
Valdez or any other lodger in Sigma Chi.
Guests who stay for three consecutive days or five days in a
single quarter in Stanford housing are required to register with
the Stanford Housing front desk, according to guest policy.
Housing strengthened policies preventing illegal lodgers fol
lowing an "incident" that occurred several years ago, according
to a Housing representative who
was likely referring to the case of
Azia Kim, who lived in Stanford
housing for nearly a year from
2006 to 2007, despite never being
an enrolled student.
Valdez claims he was on cam
pus to work on a start-up with sev
eral other Stanford students,
which he continues to do from an
off-campus apartment.
On March 20, five weeks after
the initial incident was reported to
University officials, Stanford is
sued a stay-away letter to Valdez,
according to University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin.

At the time initial concerns
were voiced, Valdez received mul
tiple warnings to leave the campus,
including a written stay-away let
ter issued to him March 20."

Valdez denied receiving such a
letter, but did say that University
administrators had warned him
not to come within 50 feet of stu
dent residences. His Twitter feed
shows photos taken from the Stan
ford campus on March 30 and
April 16.
On May 4, more than a month
after the stay-away letter was is
sued, the Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) was called to
FloMo one of the residences
Valdez is known to have stayed in
to accompany University staff
in confronting Valdez. After arriv
ing at the dorm room where he
was staying, University staff es
corted Valdez off the premises, ac
cording to an SUDPS report.
On May 9, Fran'Cee Brown-
McClure, student affairs officer for
Residential Education, sent an
email to all RAs with a picture of
Valdez, identifying him as an "ille
gal lodger" and notifying RAs
that, "we have reason to believe
that [Valdez's] presence could be a
threat to other Stanford students."
The notice informed students to
contact SUDPS deputies if they
see Valdez on campus.
The University has not pressed
charges against Valdez; however,
failure to comply with a stay-away
letter could result in trespassing
charges, a criminal misdemeanor.
"The warnings are over," Lapin
said. "If he comes on campus
again, he will be subject to arrest."
Lapin added that administra
tors were unable to confirm that
Valdez committed any crime, but
decided to ban him from campus
given student concern.
"While the University has not
been able to verify any criminal
conduct to date, Stanford takes
any concerns voiced by students
seriously," Lapin said.
