## PART TWO CUSTOM CONSOLES 
### â€“ nate adams contact nate: nadams@stanford. edu 
When growing up, chances are there
came a time when you realized that
you were categorically superior to
your parents in at least one regard: computer
stuff. For me, that moment came when my dear
father couldn't switch the RF adapter for my
NES from "game mode" back to cable in time
for a Twins game. I was seven at the time.
The generational gap in technological
know-how is a uniquely modern phenome
non, and the divide is only going to be larger
for the next few rounds of wired youngsters.
In the meantime, we should do more to devel
op a knowledge-driven sense of control over
technology's place in our personal lives.
As I discussed last week, console-manu
facturers may be in a great position to lead
that sort of paradigm-shift. By couching a
gentle introduction to computer-tweaking in a
common medium of entertainment, a lot
more people might suddenly flex their sea legs
in a world often consumed by technology. A
host of obstacles have historically prevented
that kind of radical change, but the playing
field may be a little different today. Let's take
an updated look at some of the reasons con
sole-makers don't typically encourage us to
tinker around with their products.
Splitting the user-base
The most talked-about problem with re
configurable consoles, without a doubt, is that
they would split a manufacturer's customers
into various segments. In so doing, the tradi
tional purpose of a console giving users a
streamlined, unified and easily advertised
experience is damaged.
What people sometimes neglect is this: we
already have that problem. Nintendo, Microsoft
and Sony all released products in this console
generation that categorically split the player
experience to the point that compatible games

now need to be
specifically
labeled. They
didn't shy away

from advertising the add-ons
Wii Motion Plus, Kinect and Play Station Move
as radically new experiences that redefine
their consoles. Evidently, they aren't so afraid of
splitting the base anymore, especially if it
means appealing to more people.
More importantly, most of the changes
I'm advocating wouldn't so much split the
user-base as stretch it out. That is to say,
adding a couple gigabytes of RAM wouldn't
allow for categorically new experiences, just
better ones of the same kind. Who loses there?
That's right, no one.
Alienating people
Consoles are popular because they aren't
intimidating. Quite rightly, their manufacturers
are afraid of scaring off casual consumers with
a dizzying array of options. But given the age
we five in, I daresay those consumers are ready
for a calculated step forward. We've gone from
plug-and-play games to online services, micro
transactions, wacky peripherals and finicky
controller-syncing at some point, we should
be able to open the hood. It doesn't have to be
an instant switch to full customization, either.
That would ruin the point. If we're given a lim
ited set of meaningfully distinguishable hard
ware options, I think we'd find the happy place
between comfort and customization.
Price-gouging
This worrying problem is more on the
consumer's side of spectrum, but no less
important. The standard practice for
exchangeable doo-dads on current platforms
is (predictably) to not pass on the savings to
the end-user and instead milk their wallets

dry. Typically, that's done by creating artificial
ly proprietary components like the Xbox 360's
hard drive or the Vita's outrageously expensive
memory sticks. It's like a homemade mini
monopoly. It's a difficult problem to solve, but
perhaps manufacturers could open RAM or
processor production to third parties and
charge licensing fees, as they currently do with
other peripherals. Or they could simply trust
that by treating the consumer fairly, they'd sell
more units and create a larger install base for
lucrative software.
Companies likely to make the switch
It's hard to say which company ight
release the world's first "open" console. Of
the established players, Sony might make the
best fit it's still one of the world's premier
electronics companies, and not long ago it
championed Linux and custom hard drives
on PS3. Microsoft certainly has the pipeline
for such a move, but seems fiercely commit
ted to keeping the Xbox line as straightfor
ward as possible. Nintendo is the same way,
infinitely more so.
It might make more sense for a new con
tender to come out of the gate with a custom
console approach from the beginning. Apple
has been flirting with consoles for a while
(and even developed one back in the day), but
it is the last company on Earth that would
release a new product line with customizable
hardware. Valve, the savior of PC gaming and
keeper of its biggest marketplace in Steam, is
the top contender in my mind. Nobody
champions user empowerment more than
Gabe Newell & Co., who certainly have the

liquid cash to produce and market a console.
If Valve ever does release its much-rumored
console, I'd be shocked, in fact, if we couldn't
open it up and toss in anything that the moth
erboard and OS would support.

In the end, I'll salute (and pay) whoever bites
the bullet and gives the consumer the cus
tomization we crave.
