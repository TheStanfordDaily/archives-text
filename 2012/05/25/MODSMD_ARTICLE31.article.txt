## ROXY SASS ROXY'S GUIDE TO YOUR SPRING FLING 
### 
Some say spring is a time for
romance, but by the last few
weeks of the quarter, Roxy
knows the only love to be had at
Stanford is the kind they study in
Women in French Cinema. With
only a few weeks remaining, there's
no time to start a full-fledged rela
tionship but Roxy only needs a
few hours (or less, in a pinch) for
her favorite kind of relationship.
With warm days and chilly nights,
the logic of the casual hookup is
inescapable: find someone to keep
your bed warm when the sun

ducks behind the moon and who'll
be out of your hair by the time we
see light of day again.

And the perks of a spring
fling? If you're heading off to a new
place for the summer, this might
be your last, ahem, taste of
Stanford for a while. Graduating
seniors need to lock down their
bucket lists, and you certainly can't
hook up in the stacks alone. And of
course, with finals on the horizon,
there's no better way to de-stress
than to undress.

As this isn't Roxy's first time at
the spring quarter rodeo, she's got
some suggestions for how to guar
antee a successful finish... to the
year, of course! If you're truly look
ing for random, Roxy recommends
the dance floor of an all-campus
party. You barely need to exchange
names before the DFMO (dance

floor make out, of course) can
begin forget pleasantries like
class year, major and freshman year
IHUM. Alternative places to meet
potential hookups include outside
on the Row as people wander
between parties or on FloMo field
mid-day drinking.
After the hookup, you've
shared plenty Roxy believes
there's no need to share more
information... like your phone
number. Of course, if you're look
ing for a round two, you might
have to give in order to get some.
In that case, Roxy recommends
you refrain from any texts before
dinnertime you might give the
impression that you actually want
to see this person before dinner.
Similarly, avoid sympathy coffee
(you know, the "I want to pretend
this wasn't a random thing so we
can go out to coffee once and
never talk again" coffee). Nothing
ruins hot and steamy memories
more than iced beverages and stilt
ed conversation.
Roxy wishes you all the best in
your pursuits. Trust her, it's worth
it to end the year with a bang. Or
two.
Looking for away to stay warm at night
but can't seem to find your space heater?
Roxy can heat things up in no time. See if
she's busy (or wants to get busy) at
Intermission@Stanforddaily.com.
