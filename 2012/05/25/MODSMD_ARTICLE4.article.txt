## Harvard professor defends nation states 
### CHARLOTTE WAYNE COPY EDITOR 
"When everything goes well, it might look like you don't
need the nation state, but it turns out that when things be
come tough, that's the only thing that you have," said Dani
Rodrik, a professor of international political economy at the
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard Univer
sity, Thursday in Annenberg Auditorium.
The Center for Ethics in Society hosted Rodrik's lecture,
which was titled "Who Needs the Nation State?" and deliv
ered as the annual Arrow Lecture on Ethics and Leadership.
During the presentation, Rodrik defended the concept of
a nation state, which he defined as any smaller, self-governed
body as contrasted to a global polity. He began by outlining
key criticisms of the nation state, primarily those from fellow
economists who emphasize the inefficiency of transaction
costs caused by national borders, which impede global trade.
"This sort of looks like it's hundred dollar bills lying on the
proverbial pavement to the economists," Rodrik said. "It
means that we should basically pick up these hundred dollar
bills by getting rid of nation
states, getting rid of these juris
dictional boundaries, discontinu
ities in the global economy."
Rodrik pointed to ethical ar
guments by "moral cosmopoli
tans," who question the validity
of national distinctions.

provide the safety nets and pump
up demand and print the money,"
Rodrik said. "Most typically, in the
Euro Zone, we've seen how what
seems to be a transnationalist proj
ect depends so much on the choic
es that individual nation states
make, and ultimately all the re
sponsibility for everything that has
gone wrong and for the little
that has gone right has been
laid at the feet of national politi
cians."

"It's a totally artificial bound
ary," Rodrik said, paraphrasing
the arguments of his critics.
"Moreover, it's becoming more
and more artificial in terms of im
provements in communication
and transportation technolo-

Paradoxically, nation states
both enable and impede global
ization by providing the institu
tions required by global trade
while introducing regulatory bar
riers, Rodrik said.
"This paradox requires us to
manage the role of the nation
state, to maintain this balance in a
way, because the danger of trying
to push markets beyond what the
existing regulatory agents can
support is that we get too much
markets, too little governments,
and therefore a lot of instability,"
Rodrik said, highlighting the
2008 global financial collapse as
evidence that nation states are re
quired to pick up the pieces after
economic crises.

Earlier in the day, Rodrik
spoke to eight students in
Crothers Memorial Hall through
the dorm's Global Citizenship
program, in a discussion moder
ated by Ishan Nath 'l2.
Rodrik presented data show
ing that Europeans surveyed
identified only slightly more as
citizens of the European Union
than as global citizens. The Euro
Zone debt crisis was the topic of
numerous audience queries in
the question-and-answer session
that followed Rodrik's lecture.

"The fact that certainly Ger
mans don't feel they are the same

Greeks and that difference

mountable obstacle to the cre
ation of Europe-wide institu
tions, that makes the economic
and financial integration projects
unsustainable," Rodrik said. "Eu
rope is going through precisely
the tensions that I've tried to
identify here, and is doing it in a
very vivid and real-time kind of
fashion."

One student audience mem
ber criticized the event's out-

reach.
"The talk was almost identical
to other Ethics in Society events,"
said audience member Joe Ri
vano Barros 'l4. "Few students
were in the audience, and fewer
still were asking questions, with
only faculty or gray-haired locals
remotely engaging with the
speaker.
"It was interesting that he did
n't really question the nation state
as a construct," he added, "but
stuck to the question of the role of
the nation state, given that it's here
to stay, in a globalized world."
