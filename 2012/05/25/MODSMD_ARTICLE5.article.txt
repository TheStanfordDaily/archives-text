# NEWS BRIEF
## Three Books selections inspired by opening of Bing Concert Hall 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
While its title may suggest otherwise,
this year's "Three Books" program will
only include one physical book.
The Office of Undergraduate Advis
ing and Research announced the three
texts chosen for the program on Tuesday.
The selections, provided by courtesy to all
incoming members of the Class of 2016,
include the DVD documentary "My Kid
Could Paint That" by New York Times
critic Michael Kimmelman, the smart
phone application "Smule" by Stanford
Assistant Professor of Music Ge Wang
and "Fargo Rock City: A Heavy Metal
Odyssey in Rural North Dakota," a mem
oir written by Chuck Klosterman.
Incoming freshmen will receive the
DVD and memoir by mail in July, and will
be able to download the smartphone app
when they arrive on-campus.
Mark Applebaum, associate profes
sor of music, is responsible for this year's
unconventional picks. In a Uni
versity press release, Applebaum
said his selections were inspired
by the opening of the Bing Con
cert Hall, which is set to open its
doors in January. Applebaum
said he hopes the texts will in
spire students "to ask broader
questions about where art is
made, what art is important and
who should decide."

"In selecting these 'texts,' Pro
fessor Applebaum hopes the di
versity of formats encourages stu
dents to think about how ideas are
expressed differently by the writ
ten word, in filmic presentation,
through music, or by using con
temporary social media," said
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, dean of
Freshman and Undergraduate
Advising, in the University press
release. Lythcott-Haims pio
neered the Three Books program,
now in its ninth year.
This will be the first year that
non-printed texts have been se
lected. Past picks have included

Junot Diaz's "The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao" in 2008, Mal
colm Gladwell's "Outliers" in 2009
and Geraldine Brooks' "March" in
2011.

The authors of the three texts
will participate in a panel discus
sion at the conclusion of New Stu
dent Orientation. This year's dis
cussion, moderated by Apple
baum, will take place on Sept. 23
in Memorial Auditorium. A live
telecast of the event in Pigott The
ater will be open to the broader
Stanford community.
