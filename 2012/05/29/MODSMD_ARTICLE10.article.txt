## Twins on the Farm 
### RAYMOND LOUNG 
Sonya Smith '95, associate direc
tor of Undergraduate Admis
sions, set the record straight that
being a multiple does not provide
any sort of advantage over a non
multiple in gaining admission to
Stanford. Nor does being a multi
ple increase all multiples' chances
of getting into Stanford.
"While we are sensitive to
twins, triplets [and] multiples ap
plying, we treat them just the
same as any other applicant," she
said. "That is, our admission re
view is centered on each individ
ual applicant. We read each stu
dent's file holistically and in con
text of her or his school and com
munity."
Smith said that at times sib

The transition from high
school to college can be
hard for incoming
freshmen, especially
with separation from
parents and siblings leading to
homesickness. For twins who
have often spent the entirety of
their lives together this dis
tance can seem even further. But
what if your twin weren't so far
away? What if you lived on the
same college campus, or maybe a
few doors down the same hall, or
even in the same room?
For many twins at Stanford,
this situation is the reality. The
University is home to many sets of
twins and even triplets.
While rumor has it that having
your twin gain acceptance into
Stanford increases your chances,

has a unique story to tell.
Though admissions officers do
not specifically group multiples
together, they do acknowledge
when an applicant has a sibling in
the applicant pool. There is an op
tion on the Stanford Supplement
for applicants to indicate if they
have a sibling who is also applying
to Stanford.
"It may mean that she or he is
a twin, triplet [or] multiple, but it
could also mean that one sibling is
applying as a freshman and anoth
er as a transfer or that one sibling
is graduating early," Smith said.
"Sometimes a teacher or guid
ance counselor letter will also
mention that the applicant is a
twin or triplet."
Even if each multiple gains ac
ceptance to the same university,
there is still the common need
among siblings to differentiate

themselves from one another.
However, many sets of twins who
attend Stanford note that the Uni
versity is large enough for each to
develop his or her own experience.
Elena Ayala 'l4 attends Stan
ford with her twin Alejandro. She
noted that, during freshman year,
they were placed on opposite
sides of campus, and as a result,
developed separate groups of
friends. In fact, the only times they
saw each other were when their
parents visited.
The two also focus on different
areas of academic study. Elena
plans to study English and sociol
ogy, while her brother enjoys
computer science. Despite these
differences, however, this year
both are taking Social Dance and
currently live in Crothers Hall.
"Though we have different
and separate lives, there is always
the possibility of being able to see
him for help and companionship,"
Elena said.
Twins Melanie and Veronica
Polin 'l4 observe similar experi
ences at Stanford.
"In high school, it was a lot
harder to separate," Veronica
said. "Growing up, we were a lot
more put together in different ac
tivities, but at Stanford, we've
been really able to pursue differ
ent interests and create our own
identities."
Though they share similar cir
cles of friends and are roommates
this year, the two have different
academic interests. Melanie plans
to major in biology, while Veroni
ca intends to study international
relations and economics.
Melanie suggested that, while
she enjoys having Veronica
around, they experience no pres
sure to hang out all the time. In
particular, Melanie looks forward
to studying abroad in order to live
independently from her sister.
"Studying abroad in a different
country will be an entirely new ex
perience," Melanie said. "For
three months, I'll be able to see
what life would be like without
my sister."
For freshmen, having a famil
iar face on campus can ease part
of the anxiety that comes with the
transition to college. Arielle Ba
sich 'l5 attends Stanford with her
twin brother Chase and said she
believes that her adjustment to
college life was made easier by the
presence of her brother.
"I love having someone to talk
about friends and family back
home," Arielle said. "Plus, he is my
best friend, so I couldn't really ask
for anything better."
Basich also noted that incom
ing freshman twins tend to be
placed into separate housing. For
instance, she lives in Stern Hall
while her brother lives in Flo
rence Moore Hall. She said she
feels this has essential to the cre
ation of her own college experi
ence independent of her twin.
Elena, Melanie, Veronica and
Arielle all agreed that there are
many sets of twins at Stanford and
the pairs are able to relate and
bond over a shared experience.
"We can laugh at a lot of simi
lar things and tendencies that we
know and have," Veronica said
with a smile. "It's a twin thing."
For many twins at Stanford
whose siblings attend another
university, separating from their
other halves came with the initial
drastic change of leaving home.
Mitch Wheeler 'l4 is an identi

cal twin whose brother attends
the University of Chicago. They
are able to visit each other at least
once a year and Skype fairly
often. In addition, both Stanford
and the University of Chicago are
on quarter systems, so they share
similar academic breaks. Never
theless, Wheeler admitted that the
transition to college was made
more difficult because his twin
was across the country.
" [When I am at home], I am al
ways with [him] doing some
thing," Wheeler said. "When I
come to Stanford, I have a lot
more time alone to do my own
thing, but there are kids that kind
of replace your twin."
Despite their geographic sepa
ration, Mitch and his brother are
both economics majors and often
take similar classes.
"In retrospect, it would have
been nice and cool to have him
with me, to have somebody to do
stuff with, to take the same classes
[since] we're the same major," he
said.
Wheeler notes that if his twin
had come to Stanford, he proba
bly would have had a similar ex
perience. They are both involved
in Greek life and consider them
selves to be outgoing people,
though they are more outgoing as
a pair.
Michael Celentano 'l4 is a fra
ternal twin whose sister attends
Washington University in St.
Louis. He also has two older sis
ters, but comments on how being
separated from his twin is differ
ent than being away from his
other siblings.
"The transition is much more
extreme with a twin because you
are constantly together when
[you're] growing up," he noted.
"We were in the same grade and
classes, and our social lives over
lapped."
Celentano plans to study math
and physics and finds Stanford to
be the right fit for him, while his
sister enjoys art and anthropology
and prefers the social environ
ment at Washington University in
St. Louis.
Despite missing his sister, Ce
lentano said he believes physical
distance is necessary in order to
differentiate himself from his twin.
"It's good to get space and ex
ercise independence," he said.
"We have to separate at some
point. We're not going to be with
each other for our entire lives, and
college seems to be an appropri
ate time to start anew.
"For everyone, there's an ele
ment of entering a fresh environ
ment with completely new peo
ple. To have someone whom you
know really well diminishes that
element," he added.
Though both their twins are
not at Stanford, both Wheeler and
Celentano noted that being a twin
is an integral part of their identity.
They use the twin experience as a
conversation starter and enjoy
observing and comparing other
twin relationships with their own.
According to Basich, there is
also something to be said for mak
ing friends with other twins whose
experiences going to school with
or without their twin have affect
ed their undergraduate lives.
"Once you meet someone who
is a twin, you don't forget it," she
said.

Despite their geographic sepa

both economics majors and often
take similar classes.
"In retrospect, it would have

[since] we're the same major," he
said.

The transition from high
school to college can be
hard for incoming
freshmen, especially
with separation from
parents and siblings leading to
homesickness. For twins who
have often spent the entirety of
their lives together this dis
tance can seem even further. But
what if your twin weren't so far
away? What if you lived on the
same college campus, or maybe a
few doors down the same hall, or
even in the same room?
For many twins at Stanford,
this situation is the reality. The
University is home to many sets of
twins and even triplets.
While rumor has it that having
your twin gain acceptance into
Stanford increases your chances,

has a unique story to tell.
Though admissions officers do
not specifically group multiples
together, they do acknowledge
when an applicant has a sibling in
the applicant pool. There is an op
tion on the Stanford Supplement
for applicants to indicate if they
have a sibling who is also applying
to Stanford.
"It may mean that she or he is
a twin, triplet [or] multiple, but it
could also mean that one sibling is
applying as a freshman and anoth
er as a transfer or that one sibling
is graduating early," Smith said.
"Sometimes a teacher or guid
ance counselor letter will also
mention that the applicant is a
twin or triplet."
Even if each multiple gains ac
ceptance to the same university,
there is still the common need
among siblings to differentiate

themselves from one another.
However, many sets of twins who
attend Stanford note that the Uni
versity is large enough for each to
develop his or her own experience.
Elena Ayala 'l4 attends Stan
ford with her twin Alejandro. She
noted that, during freshman year,
they were placed on opposite
sides of campus, and as a result,
developed separate groups of
friends. In fact, the only times they
saw each other were when their
parents visited.
The two also focus on different
areas of academic study. Elena
plans to study English and sociol
ogy, while her brother enjoys
computer science. Despite these
differences, however, this year
both are taking Social Dance and
currently live in Crothers Hall.
"Though we have different
and separate lives, there is always
the possibility of being able to see
him for help and companionship,"
Elena said.
Twins Melanie and Veronica
Polin 'l4 observe similar experi
ences at Stanford.
"In high school, it was a lot
harder to separate," Veronica
said. "Growing up, we were a lot
more put together in different ac
tivities, but at Stanford, we've
been really able to pursue differ
ent interests and create our own
identities."
Though they share similar cir
cles of friends and are roommates
this year, the two have different
academic interests. Melanie plans
to major in biology, while Veroni
ca intends to study international
relations and economics.
Melanie suggested that, while
she enjoys having Veronica
around, they experience no pres
sure to hang out all the time. In
particular, Melanie looks forward
to studying abroad in order to live
independently from her sister.
"Studying abroad in a different
country will be an entirely new ex
perience," Melanie said. "For
three months, I'll be able to see
what life would be like without
my sister."
For freshmen, having a famil
iar face on campus can ease part
of the anxiety that comes with the
transition to college. Arielle Ba
sich 'l5 attends Stanford with her
twin brother Chase and said she
believes that her adjustment to
college life was made easier by the
presence of her brother.
"I love having someone to talk
about friends and family back
home," Arielle said. "Plus, he is my
best friend, so I couldn't really ask
for anything better."
Basich also noted that incom
ing freshman twins tend to be
placed into separate housing. For
instance, she lives in Stern Hall
while her brother lives in Flo
rence Moore Hall. She said she
feels this has essential to the cre
ation of her own college experi
ence independent of her twin.
Elena, Melanie, Veronica and
Arielle all agreed that there are
many sets of twins at Stanford and
the pairs are able to relate and
bond over a shared experience.
"We can laugh at a lot of simi
lar things and tendencies that we
know and have," Veronica said
with a smile. "It's a twin thing."
For many twins at Stanford
whose siblings attend another
university, separating from their
other halves came with the initial
drastic change of leaving home.
Mitch Wheeler 'l4 is an identi

cal twin whose brother attends
the University of Chicago. They
are able to visit each other at least
once a year and Skype fairly
often. In addition, both Stanford
and the University of Chicago are
on quarter systems, so they share
similar academic breaks. Never
theless, Wheeler admitted that the
transition to college was made
more difficult because his twin
was across the country.
" [When I am at home], I am al

and separate lives, there is always
the possibility of being able to see
him for help and companionship,"
Elena said.
Twins Melanie and Veronica
Polin 'l4 observe similar experi
ences at Stanford.
"In high school, it was a lot
harder to separate," Veronica
said. "Growing up, we were a lot
more put together in different ac
tivities, but at Stanford, we've
been really able to pursue differ
ent interests and create our own
identities."
Though they share similar cir
cles of friends and are roommates
this year, the two have different
academic interests. Melanie plans
to major in biology, while Veroni
ca intends to study international
relations and economics.
Melanie suggested that, while
she enjoys having Veronica
around, they experience no pres
sure to hang out all the time. In
particular, Melanie looks forward
to studying abroad in order to live
independently from her sister.
"Studying abroad in a different
country will be an entirely new ex
perience," Melanie said. "For
three months, I'll be able to see
what life would be like without
my sister."
For freshmen, having a famil
iar face on campus can ease part
of the anxiety that comes with the
transition to college. Arielle Ba
sich 'l5 attends Stanford with her
twin brother Chase and said she
believes that her adjustment to
college life was made easier by the
presence of her brother.
"I love having someone to talk
about friends and family back
home," Arielle said. "Plus, he is my
best friend, so I couldn't really ask
for anything better."
Basich also noted that incom
ing freshman twins tend to be
placed into separate housing. For
instance, she lives in Stern Hall
while her brother lives in Flo
rence Moore Hall. She said she
feels this has essential to the cre
ation of her own college experi
ence independent of her twin.
Elena, Melanie, Veronica and
Arielle all agreed that there are
many sets of twins at Stanford and
the pairs are able to relate and
bond over a shared experience.
"We can laugh at a lot of simi
lar things and tendencies that we
know and have," Veronica said
with a smile. "It's a twin thing."
For many twins at Stanford
whose siblings attend another
university, separating from their
other halves came with the initial
drastic change of leaving home.
Mitch Wheeler 'l4 is an identi

cal twin whose brother attends
the University of Chicago. They
are able to visit each other at least
once a year and Skype fairly
often. In addition, both Stanford
and the University of Chicago are
on quarter systems, so they share
similar academic breaks. Never
theless, Wheeler admitted that the
transition to college was made
more difficult because his twin
was across the country.
" [When I am at home], I am al
ways with [him] doing some
thing," Wheeler said. "When I
come to Stanford, I have a lot
more time alone to do my own
thing, but there are kids that kind
of replace your twin."
Despite their geographic sepa
ration, Mitch and his brother are
both economics majors and often
take similar classes.
"In retrospect, it would have
been nice and cool to have him
with me, to have somebody to do
stuff with, to take the same classes
[since] we're the same major," he
said.
Wheeler notes that if his twin
had come to Stanford, he proba
bly would have had a similar ex
perience. They are both involved
in Greek life and consider them
selves to be outgoing people,
though they are more outgoing as
a pair.
Michael Celentano 'l4 is a fra
ternal twin whose sister attends
Washington University in St.
Louis. He also has two older sis
ters, but comments on how being
separated from his twin is differ
ent than being away from his
other siblings.
"The transition is much more
extreme with a twin because you
are constantly together when
[you're] growing up," he noted.
"We were in the same grade and
classes, and our social lives over
lapped."
Celentano plans to study math
and physics and finds Stanford to
be the right fit for him, while his
sister enjoys art and anthropology
and prefers the social environ
ment at Washington University in
St. Louis.
Despite missing his sister, Ce
lentano said he believes physical
distance is necessary in order to
differentiate himself from his twin.
"It's good to get space and ex
ercise independence," he said.
"We have to separate at some
point. We're not going to be with
each other for our entire lives, and
college seems to be an appropri
ate time to start anew.
"For everyone, there's an ele
ment of entering a fresh environ
ment with completely new peo
ple. To have someone whom you
know really well diminishes that
element," he added.
Though both their twins are
not at Stanford, both Wheeler and
Celentano noted that being a twin
is an integral part of their identity.
They use the twin experience as a
conversation starter and enjoy
observing and comparing other
twin relationships with their own.
According to Basich, there is
also something to be said for mak
ing friends with other twins whose
experiences going to school with
or without their twin have affect
ed their undergraduate lives.
"Once you meet someone who
is a twin, you don't forget it," she
said.
