## The 						Angel of Grief Snapshot of a statue 
### â€“ Stephanie Wang 
Sitting next to the Mausoleum, the "Angel
of Grief" might be the lesser known of the
two Stanford landmarks, yet the image of
an angel hunched over in tears is hard to
forget. The statue is even more memo
rable for its meaning: It serves as an emblem of
Jane Stanford's grief over the loss of her brother
Henry Lathrop, who lived with her after Leland
Stanford Sr. died. Lathrop is buried beneath the
statue.
"At the time that she [had the statue built],
there was a bigger cemetery in the arboretum,"
said University Archaeologist Laura Jones. "The
University faculty, staff and employees were also
buried [there]."
Before she died, Jane Stanford had the ceme
tery in the arboretum moved to its present-day lo
cation on Arastradero Road.
"She didn't want the arboretum to be just a
cemetery," Jones said. "There were more and
more graves, and she was concerned that it was
going to take over the entire arboretum."
Still, the angel stayed, even though it is not the
original statue Jane Stanford commissioned in
1901. The first one was damaged in the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake, and Charles Lathrop, an
other one of Jane's brothers, arranged to have a
replacement brought from Italy.
"The original angel had a marble cupola over
the top of it," Jones said. "That's what fell in 1906."
Small marble tiles also surrounded the entire
original statue.
Since its replacement, the University has made
a strong effort to preserve the "Angel of Grief." In

1996, the original small marble tiles surrounding
the statue were replaced with plants in a restora
tion project.
Although it sits in a secluded part of the ar
boretum, the angel is not immune to vandalism.
The University once had to repair the angel's arm
after someone carved it off.
"[The statue is] over-scaled slightly. If she stood
up, she would have been over seven feet tall,"
Jones said. "We scaled it back slightly, and the
Cantor Arts Center curators reviewed it as well.
This hand is slightly smaller than the other hand.
If it was [made] to scale, it would have looked
monstrous."
Jane Stanford's grief and love for her brother
Henry, although captured in the statue itself, can
best be seen in a letter she wrote to Charles fol
lowing Henry's death. In particular, she included
words of instruction to ensure careful preparation
for the statue.
"Dear brother, do not have any of these mar
bles unpacked until I get home," she wrote in a let
ter written before the statue was erected. "Have
them carefully put in a safe, dry place."
Nowadays, the Angel is used as a more univer
sal memorial site for locals to mourn the loss of
their loved ones.
Still, the monument retains both its historic
charm and initial significance as Jane Stanford's
tribute to the premature death of a beloved sib
ling, much in the same way that the Farm itself
stands as a memorial to her deceased son and the
University's namesake, Leland Stanford Jr.
