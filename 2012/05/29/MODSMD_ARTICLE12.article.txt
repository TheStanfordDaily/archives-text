## FROM FARM TO FORK Eat your peas and carrots 
### Jenny Rempel 
When he was a kid, my dad
wasn't allowed to leave
the dinner table until he
had finished everything on his
plate. Still scarred from stomach
ing more canned peas and carrots
than he wanted, my dad never
forced me to finish my food. At
dinnertime, he would usually just
repeat his favorite mantra, "Chew
slowly," and encourage me to take
only what I would actually eat.
Except when overwhelmed by
options at the new Arrillaga Fam
ily Dining Commons, I think my
dad's parenting was about as ef
fective as his parents': I usually
finish whatever is on my plate. A
lot of Stanford students don't,
though. Our campus still gener
ates somewhere on the order of
1,300 tons of food waste each
year.
Stanford's commitment to
waste reduction was first appar
ent to me at a "zero waste lunch"
during Admit Weekend. Zero
waste events feature all-com
postable materials in an attempt
to raise awareness about the un
fortunate ease and frequency with
which we throw away food and
packaging materials. It's impor
tant to focus attention on waste
streams, since the average Stan
ford student generates almost 14
pounds of waste each week. Of
that, 1.8 pounds per person are
"food service organics." Some
simple math suggests that a stu
dent generates, on average, 95
pounds of food waste per year,
and that's just in the end con
sumption stage.
Zero waste lunches are an ef
fective outreach strategy, but their
name is a little misleading. Having
volunteered at "zero waste"
events like the recent Spring
Faire, I've seen how much materi
al gets placed into plastic trash
bins at the end of the event. Sure,
the waste in these bins is headed
toward a compost facility instead
of a landfill, but it's still waste.
Serving food on compostable
plates or containers is a step in the
right direction, but we need to be
more conscious of the food waste
left on those plates (not to men
tion the energy and resources
used to produce the single-use,
disposable plates). Perhaps the
events would be more aptly
named "zero landfill" affairs, be
cause then students might consid
er the fact that uneaten food is still
waste, even if it goes to a compost
ing facility.
The amount of food wasted on
our planet is a symptom of our
faulty food systems. Almost a
third of all food produced for
human consumption is wasted
somewhere along the path from
production to consumption. Last
year, this meant 1.3 billion tons of
food were lost or wasted. In devel
oped countries like the United
States, consumers are to blame for
much of this wasted food.
According to the United Na
tions Food and Agriculture Or
ganization, the developed world
wastes 222 million tons of food
each year. This number is almost
equivalent to the amount of food
produced annually in all of sub-
Saharan Africa. Americans are
prime offenders. We waste 40 per
cent of the food produced for

human consumption, at a cost of
over $lOO billion annually.
Recognizing this problem,
Stanford students and staff have
rallied to target food waste reduc
tion through their "Love Food,
Hate Waste" campaign. Stanford
Dining, acting much like my dad,
encourages students to take only
what they will eat. Any uneaten
food is scraped into composting
bins and transported to the
Newby Island compost facility by
the Peninsula Sanitary Service,
Inc., where it is turned into usable
mulch that is then driven back to
campus for use in gardens and
landscaping. It's better than send
ing the food to a landfill where it
would produce methane (a green
house gas 23 times more potent
than carbon dioxide) during
anaerobic decay, but driving food
up and down the Peninsula still
produces unnecessary carbon
emissions.
The Stanford Project on
Hunger tries to further reduce
waste by taking leftovers from
dining halls and houses to the
Palo Alto Opportunity Center,
but their limited volunteer base
can't do everything. So the onus is
back on students, faculty and staff.
It's probably impossible to
achieve a "zero waste" food sys
tem, but there are some steps we
can take before, during and after
meals to reduce food waste. The
Worldwatch Institute encourages
Americans to be realistic about
meals, plan ahead, go small at
mealtime, use self-serving meal
stations, store leftovers, compost
food scraps, repurpose food into
new meals and donate excess.
Some of these steps are not that
applicable to students eating in
dining halls, but it's a pretty sim
ple, important list to remember
for post-college life. In campus
dining halls, though, it boils down
to the message my dad taught me
as a child: Take only what you
think you'll actually eat. You can
always go back for seconds.
