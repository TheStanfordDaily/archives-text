# HALF-INVENTED
## Stare at the sun 
### Chase Ishii 
I recently got to see author Ravi
Zacharias speak. I hadn't ever
heard of him before the event,
but he sparked my attention dur
ing the question-and-answer seg
ment following the talk when he
addressed the meaning of life. He
posited that there are four neces
sary components to find meaning
in life: truth, love, security and
wonder.
If you stood in the middle of
White Plaza and tried to ask 100
students on campus where they
look to find meaning in life, the
nine or 10 students willing to stop
and respond would probably in
clude the first three on their list:
truth, love and security. But won
der? You may be hard-pressed to
find that answer. Is having wonder
in life necessary for meaning?
And if so, why is it so underappre
ciated?
I recently restarted watching
wrestling. And not Olympic-style,
grapple, counter, mat wrestling. I

mean chokeslam-through-a
table, steel-chair-to-the-face-of-a
-7-foot-300-pound-gimmick,
staged professional wrestling. I
used to watch it every week grow
ing up, and I dreamt of becoming
a professional wrestler one day,
despite possessing the size and
shape of a meerkat.
I started watching again be
cause of a new straightedge
wrestler named CM Punk, and, let
me just say, the 10 years between
watching as a 10-year-old and
watching it now has made a huge
difference, I always knew it was
fake, but not this fake. If you've
never experienced the joy and
wonder that is professional
wrestling, you should stop reading
this right now and hop on
You Tube. The personalities are
flat, the feuds are more scripted
than soap operas and the actual
wrestling is hit or miss. And by "hit
or miss," I mean whether the per
son gets a hit or misses, the other
guy falls over. It's incredible.
But twice a week for two
hours, stadiums and convention
centers are filled with fans cheer
ing, booing and paying to see
grown men in tights fake fight.
And it's because of the sense of
wonder this fake world holds.
Anything can happen. In this
world, the good guy doesn't al
ways win, the rules aren't always
followed and the little guy can
sometimes overcome the giant.
Even though they are completely
aware it is fake, thousands of peo
ple every week look to profes
sional wrestling to divorce them
selves from their world of mun
dane routine.
And this is the type of wonder
I think Ravi Zacharias was refer
ring to as necessary for finding
meaning in life. Not professional
wrestling specifically, but a won
der found from seeing the every
day world around us with aston
ishment, without jaded or dulled
hearts. It is the appreciation for
things regardless of their in
evitability or routine. It is the
hope that anything, no matter
how small and insignificant, can
become great. It is the excitement
that anything and everything can
happen.
And I think the busy college
world is detrimental to this sense

of wonder. In order to succeed as
a college kid, you need to have
your world figured out so you can
best take advantage of it. The
freedom of time is reduced to
hourly calendar spots within a day
that must be filled as efficiently as
possible. Passions and longings
simply become weekly routines of
going through the motions. Ac
tions and choices become the ha
bitual cause-and-effect decision
that reaps the most effective ben
efits. Emotions and imagination
are dismissed for figures and
graphs, and questions of "why?"
and "what if?" are replaced by the
more pragmatic and explainable
"how?" questions. And therein
lies the problem.
There was a solar eclipse last
week, and everyone gathered
with wonder and astonishment to
watch, but the wonder seemed to
die once the sun was no longer ob
scured. That seems ironic to me.
There's a giant, flaming ball of gas
in the sky that gives us heat and
growing plants and delicious
Sunny D, and we only find it
amazing when something gets in
its way?
We need to rethink the way we
perceive the world, and it starts
with hope and humility. Maybe we
haven't figured out everything
there is to know about the things
and people and places in front of
us. In the words of G.K. Chester
ton, "The world will never starve
for want of wonders; but only for
want of wonder."

Is having
wonder in life
necessary
for meaning?

I recently got to see author Ravi
Zacharias speak. I hadn't ever
heard of him before the event,
but he sparked my attention dur
ing the question-and-answer seg
ment following the talk when he
addressed the meaning of life. He
posited that there are four neces
sary components to find meaning
in life: truth, love, security and
wonder.
If you stood in the middle of
White Plaza and tried to ask 100
students on campus where they
look to find meaning in life, the
nine or 10 students willing to stop
and respond would probably in
clude the first three on their list:
truth, love and security. But won
der? You may be hard-pressed to
find that answer. Is having wonder
in life necessary for meaning?
And if so, why is it so underappre
ciated?
I recently restarted watching
wrestling. And not Olympic-style,
grapple, counter, mat wrestling. I

mean chokeslam-through-a
table, steel-chair-to-the-face-of-a
-7-foot-300-pound-gimmick,
staged professional wrestling. I
used to watch it every week grow
ing up, and I dreamt of becoming
a professional wrestler one day,
despite possessing the size and
shape of a meerkat.
I started watching again be
cause of a new straightedge
wrestler named CM Punk, and, let
me just say, the 10 years between
watching as a 10-year-old and
watching it now has made a huge
difference, I always knew it was
fake, but not this fake. If you've
never experienced the joy and
wonder that is professional
wrestling, you should stop reading
this right now and hop on
You Tube. The personalities are
flat, the feuds are more scripted
than soap operas and the actual
wrestling is hit or miss. And by "hit
or miss," I mean whether the per
son gets a hit or misses, the other
guy falls over. It's incredible.
But twice a week for two
hours, stadiums and convention
centers are filled with fans cheer
ing, booing and paying to see
grown men in tights fake fight.
And it's because of the sense of
wonder this fake world holds.
Anything can happen. In this
world, the good guy doesn't al
ways win, the rules aren't always
followed and the little guy can
sometimes overcome the giant.
Even though they are completely
aware it is fake, thousands of peo
ple every week look to profes
sional wrestling to divorce them
selves from their world of mun
dane routine.
And this is the type of wonder
I think Ravi Zacharias was refer
ring to as necessary for finding
meaning in life. Not professional
wrestling specifically, but a won
der found from seeing the every
day world around us with aston
ishment, without jaded or dulled
hearts. It is the appreciation for
things regardless of their in
evitability or routine. It is the
hope that anything, no matter
how small and insignificant, can
become great. It is the excitement
that anything and everything can
happen.
