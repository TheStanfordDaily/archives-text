# Here we go again, England

### Tom Taylor 
I promised myself it wouldn't
happen this time, I thought I
could keep it cool and that the
physical distance between us
and the memory of how
you've hurt me and let me down so
many times before would be
enough to prevent me from repeat
ing past mistakes. But try as I might,
I just can't stay mad at you. Damn
you, England.
In just under two weeks time, the
2012 UEFA European Football
Championship, the biggest interna
tional prize outside of the World
Cup, will kick off in the two host
countries of Poland and Ukraine.
Looking at the current FIFA rank
ings, the England team is the fifth
best European squad, but with three
of the teams ahead of it drawn to
gether in the "Group of Death," my
home team should be looking to, at
the very least, reach the semifinals.
However, life is never that easy for
an England fan. It seems almost in
evitable that this team, consisting of
many of the world's top players, will
crash and burn and that we'll have
to divert our sporting interest to
London hosting the Olympics un
naturally early.
It never used to be this way. Back
in 1966, we actually won a World
Cup, and even when I was a kid,
there seemed to be real hope. Eng
land rarely got beyond the quarter
finals, but our exits, though painful,
seemed respectable. You could feel
proud of the team's performance
and know that soon it would break
the run and make it to a final.
On the back of ex-coach Fabio
Capello's dreadful campaign at the
last World Cup two years ago and
the increasingly misguided deci
sions and appointments by the Eng
lish FA who renegotiated Capel
lo's contract just days before his
abysmal showing in South Africa to
ensure we were subjected to two
more years of his "genius" that
hope seems to have run dry. Tuning
in to watch a game, especially a tour
nament qualifier or friendly, has be
come a chore, something you know
you're supposed to do but won't re
ally enjoy.
There are frustrations too about
the leadership of the global game.
FIFA appears to be plagued by cor
ruption on such a scale that it makes
even the dirtiest politicians look
squeaky-clean. It is also no real se
cret that many of those in charge of
international soccer are no fans of
England. Apart from criticizing the
United Kingdom's free press for in
vestigating corruption allegations
and making it pretty clear that the
World Cup won't be hosted on Eng
land's shores any time soon, FIFA
has also grabbed hold of the prepos
terous idea that soccer is not in fact
an English game, but instead a Chi
nese one. No one in England has
ever claimed to have invented the
ball, but it is a clear, indisputable fact
that the roots of the modern game
lie in this little Northern European
country.
And don't get me started on vio
lence and racism. England once had
a serious problem with these issues,
but it remains one of the few coun
tries to have taken significant steps
to correct this and has become a
leading light in the fight against
both. In contrast, reports surfacing
from Poland and Ukraine suggest
that both countries have failed to
address these serious problems. Just
this year, masses of Ukrainian fans
were reported giving the Nazi salute
to their team, and, two weeks after
that incident, the same club's fans
turned on a handful of Indian sup
porters in their midst.
The worst thing about this,
though, is that we don't have our
own house in order. With FIFA be
sieged by corruption allegations, our
FA attempted to bribe the executive
committee ahead of the World Cup
selection, and included on our
squad for Euro 2012 is a player, de
fender John Terry, facing allegations
of racial abuse.
Faced with all these things, there
are easily enough reasons for me
not to tune in this summer, to not to
drag myself out of bed early to
watch live games and deal with the
inevitable defeat when it comes.
But even over here I can already
sense what must be going on back
home. In the vacuum after the end
of the regular soccer season, the
media will be seizing on this story to
fill the next month or so, pubs will be
preparing for the onslaught of fans
unable to travel to the tournament,
TV ad after TV ad will be seeking
