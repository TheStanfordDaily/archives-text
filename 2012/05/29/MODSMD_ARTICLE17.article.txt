# FRENZIED FINALE
## STANFORD DROPS TWO OF THREE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A disappointing weekend against Cal at
Sunken Diamond wrapped up a conference sea
son of missed opportunities for the No. 11 Stan
ford baseball team.
With conference-leading Oregon losing all
three games to Oregon State, the Cardinal
would have finished in a three-way tie for the
Pac-12 championship had it swept the un
ranked Bears. Instead, Stanford (38-16, 18-12
Pac-12) finished in a three-way tie for fourth
place after losing twice, marking the second
straight year that the preseason-frontrunner
Cardinal has slipped to the middle of the pack.
Stanford was outlasted by its cross-bay rival
in a perplexing 18-inning opener before a 15-5
bludgeoning by the Bears (29-25,12-18) on Sat
urday, but still enters the postseason on a win
ning note with a 5-3 Sunday win.
The final victory came just hours after the
announcement that the Farm would be one of
16 regional sites in the NCAA Tournament,
with Stanford set to host Fresno State, Michigan
State and Pepperdine next weekend. In the 14
years that the Cardinal has hosted a regional, it
has reached the College World Series 11 times.
As he prepares to make another run at
Omaha, head coach Mark Marquess isn't put
ting too much stock in this weekend's series
loss.
"The crazy thing is that you don't know. You

can win all three [in your last series] and not
play well in the regional, or you can lose all
three and then all of a sudden you play [bet
ter]," he said. "So it really is a second season
I tell the players that and there's enough
time off that there's not necessarily a carry
over."
There was a carryover from the Cardinal's
Saturday night loss, from the Bears' epic 18-in
ning win in the series opener that is tied for the
longest game in each school's recorded history.
Cal played an 18-inning game in 1943, and Stan
ford, whose records only date back 15 years, had
one of its own in 2002.
In the big picture, the 4-5 loss eliminated the
Cardinal from Pac-12 title contention, snapped
its eight-game winning streak and likely threat
ened its chances at hosting a Super Regional.
But all 569 pitches of the five-hour and 58-
minute contest were bizarre entertainment for
the 2,743 fans who packed into Sunken Dia
mond or, at least those who stuck around for
the end of the chilly marathon.
Junior righthander Mark Appel (9-1) left
with a 2-1 lead and eight strikeouts to his name
through seven innings, but the Bears clawed
back with an unearned run in the eighth. The
Cardinal had runners in scoring position in each
of the next two innings but couldn't convert,
sending the game to extras.
Sophomore righty A.J. Vanegas held Cal off
the scoreboard until the 12th, when senior catch
er Chadd Krist battled back from 0-2 with two
outs and lined a two-run double to put the Bears
ahead 4-2.
An inexplicable bottom of the 12th then left
everyone crowd, dugouts, press box and all
in shock.
With one on and two out, sophomore first

baseman Brian Ragira walked and right fielder
Austin Wilson doubled, narrowing the margin to
one. An intentional walk loaded the bases for
pinch-hitter Brett Michael Doran.
With the count at 1-2, Doran shot a ball deep
to left field which landed just foul and hit the
wall on one bounce. But incredibly, home-plate
umpire Billy Speck ruled the play a home run,
apparently believing that the ball had hit the
foul pole and bounced back into the playing
field.
Cardinal bats and helmets were strewn
everywhere, and both teams streamed out of
their dugouts: Stanford celebrating in center
field, and Cal contesting the call down the third
base line.
The play was eventually reversed, but even
after the Cardinal's equipment had been picked
up, the drama persisted. On the very next pitch,
Doran hit a cue shot between first base and the
mound, advancing everyone easily to tie the
game.
The ball was so perfectly placed, in fact, that
Wilson had enough time to come around from
second for the winning run. But he stutter
stepped at third base and was thrown out at the
plate, then ejected for slamming his helmet in
frustration.
The teams would battle back and forth for six
more innings, with Stanford using four different
catchers while several batters for both teams
registered eight at-bats.
It would be Cal's star shortstop Tony Renda
who broke through in the 18th. The Bears put a
runner in scoring position on the game's 10th sac
bunt, before Renda came to the plate at 0-for-7
on the evening. His eighth time up was the
charm, though, as Renda singled on a full count
to put his team ahead 5-4.
Junior shortstop Kenny Diekroeger also
0-for-7 at that point led off the bottom half of
the inning with a double, but the Cardinal could
not bring him home.
The deflating loss seemed to stick with Stan
ford the following afternoon, as the Bears cap
tured their first series win on the Farm since 2008
in dominant fashion.
"It didn't bother Cal at all. They came out
and played well, hit the ball around the ballpark
and really gave us a good beating, playing much
better than we did in all phases of the game,"
Marquess said. "Unless they got more sleep than
we did, I don't know why."
"They just gave a good whipping," he added.
It seemed as if the Bears, having used Satur
day starter Justin Jones as a reliever in the open
er, would have an off pitching day, but instead it
was the Cardinal that was exposed on the
mound. Redshirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham lasted just 3.2 innings, allowing
eight earned runs and 10 hits, and fellow lefty
Garrett Hughes couldn't record a single out in
relief
Cal got on the board with two outs in the sec
ond inning, scoring four runs with two outs after
Krist who leads the Pac-12 in doubles and set
a Cal career record over the weekend had
another two-bagger to ignite a rally. Stanford
loaded the bases in the bottom half and got back
two runs on a wild pitch and an error by catcher
Andrew Knapp, but the Bears limited the dam
age to just that pair of scores

season-ending series against Cal. The team still secured a spot as a regional host.
