# KLAHN LEAVES ON HIGH NOTE
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The singles and doubles portion
of the NCAA Championships
once again proved to be an elusive
prize for the Stanford men's tennis
team this weekend, with senior
Bradley Klahn falling to eventual
champion Steve Johnson of USC
in the semifinal of the singles event
and the duo of Klahn and fellow
senior Ryan Thacher coming up
just short in the doubles quarterfi
nal against Oklahoma's Costin
Paval and Dane Webb.
Going into the Round of 16 on
Friday, Klahn an at-large en
trant into the tournament field
appeared to be peaking at just the
right time on the same University
of Georgia courts where he won
the 2010 NCAA singles champi
onship, having yet to drop a set and
coming off of a upset of No. 4
Jarmere Jenkins of Virginia in the
first round.
Playing against No. 10-seed
Cole Buchanan of Ohio State on
Friday, Klahn claimed the first set
quickly and jumped out to a 3-0
lead with two break point opportu
nities in the second set.
Buchanan rallied, however,
saving both break points en route
to taking the second set, but Klahn
adapted and rallied to clinch a
hard-fought 6-4,5-7,6-2 victory.
Klahn's quarterfinal test
against No. 14-seed Nik Scholtz
of Mississippi proved to be an
easier affair. Scholtz, a freshman,
had played three consecutive
three-setters prior to Saturday's
contest, and his fatigue showed as
Klahn claimed an emphatic 6-1,6-
3 victory.
Moving into the semifinals,
Klahn was confronted for the
third time this year by Johnson,
the 2011 singles champion and

holder of a 70-match win streak.
Klahn and Johnson grew up to
gether in Southern California and
competed against each other
countless times, and Klahn was the
last player to beat Johnson more
than 16 months ago.
On Sunday, however, Klahn
struggled to threaten Johnson's
serve, with the two rivals staying on
serve throughout the first set be
fore Johnson broke Klahn in the
tenth game to win the set 6-4. In the
second set, Klahn and Johnson
swapped breaks early on before
going down to the wire again, but
Johnson eventually came up with a
second break to win out 6-4,7-5.
Johnson would go on to repeat
as NCAA singles national champi
on on Monday, beating No. 3-seed
Eric Quigley of Kentucky 6-4, 6-4
in the final.
Klahn, meanwhile, concluded a
standout Cardinal career even
with a senior campaign shortened
by injury with a 130-34 overall
singles record, a 60-22 duals ledger,
three All-American awards in
both singles and doubles and one
singles national championship in
2010.
In the doubles draw, Klahn and
Thacher faced a dangerous Sweet
16 opponent Friday in No. 16-seed
Henrique Cunha and Chris Men
gel of Duke, The No.-4 seed Cardi
nal duo, who have won eight dou
bles titles together in their time on
the Farm, hoped to improve on
their 2011 performance when
they lost in the tournament final
and conclude their prolific pairing
on a high note.
Cunha and Mengel showed
themselves to be capable oppo
nents, taking the first set on a 7-3
tiebreaker and jumping out to a 3-
0 lead in the second set. Klahn and

Senior Bradley Klahn (above) ended his stellar career in impressive
fashion, advancing to the NCAA singles semifinals before falling to
eventual champion and longtime friend Steve Johnson of USC.
Thacher rallied, however, and
made consistent inroads into the
Blue Devils' serves en route to a 6-
7 (3), 6-4,6-2 victory.
In the quarterfinals, the Cardi
nal team faced No. 10-seed Paval
and Webb, who had struggled to
three-set victories in both of their
earlier matches.The Sooners, how
ever, made a quick start to the
match, claiming the first set 7-5.
Klahn and Thacher rallied to take
the second set on a tiebreak, but
had no response to an Oklahoma
break in the third set as they suc

cumbedto a7-5,6-7 (4), 6-3 defeat.
Paval and Webb went on to lose
in the semifinals against No. 1-
seed and eventual champions
Chase Buchanan and Blaz Rola of
Ohio State.
For both Klahn and Thacher,
their exit from the tournament
marks the conclusion of sterling
Stanford careers, having led the
Cardinal lineup through four suc
cessful individual and team sea
sons. For the Stanford men's tennis
program, the ability to effectively
replace the graduating seniors re
mains the dominant question to be
addressed before next year.
