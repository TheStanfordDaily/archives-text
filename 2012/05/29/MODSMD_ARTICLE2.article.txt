## ASSU group reviews use of union space 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Following a report commissioned earlier
this year, the ASSU assembled a working group
to review use of student union spaces. The
group has since launched several initiatives to
repurpose spaces in Old Union and surround
ing buildings and has encouraged further use of
union spaces.
Programs such as Union Underground and
the Volunteer Student Organization (VSO)
Office Space Pilot Program have resulted from
the working group.
To evaluate Stanford's union spaces, the re
search group both looked at the history of
unions at Stanford and examined peer institu
tions with strong student unions, particularly
the University of Maryland-College Park and
its Stamp Student Union.
According to former ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2, the group focused on spaces
in the "White Plaza complex," the name as
signed to the area that includes Old Union,
Tresidder Union, the Nitery and other build-
ings adjacent to White Plaza.
"While [the White Plaza com
plex] does include most of the as
pects found in other student unions,
it lacks certain aspects, such as a
strong arts space as well as some
more kind of recreational activities
found in most student unions," Cruz
said, noting that the union has par
ticularly strong centers for ethnic,
religious and gender groups.
The unions were also found to
be particularly strong in having gen
eral-use areas for students.
"We were as strong, if not
stronger, than most other student
unions in terms of having really
good study spaces or group meeting
spaces," Cruz said.
In the student union study, 42
percent of students said the first
thing they thought of when thinking
about Old Union was "a place to do
group work," second only to "The
Axe and Palm" at 51 percent.
To address the shortcomings of
the union spaces, the working group
created or expedited several pro
grams. Union Underground, an ini
tiative to create an area for student

art and a "free store" in the base
ment of Old Union, was piloted last
spring and received confirmation to
continue operations this year.
"It was actually a really big
struggle to get space at all," said Liz
Matus 'l4, one of the students who
helped start the Union Under
ground project.
Matus said that the art aspect,
addressing the need for student art
space, was what ultimately got the
project approved.
The VSO Space Initiative was
created this quarter as a pilot pro
gram to allocate three rooms in Old
Union and four in the Nitery as of
fice, work and storage space for stu
dents groups. The ASSU issued an
application for any student group to
apply for its own space.
Former ASSU Vice President
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
said that if the pilot program is suc
cessful, the working group plans to
try to continue the initiative and
expand it. One drawback, he said,
was that since more groups applied
for space than the initiative could
accommodate, groups might have
to move in and out of spaces peri
odically.
According to Cruz, the goal of
the Student Space Initiative was
"increasing student engagement
with Old Union and having stu

dents feel like they really have a
sense of ownership with the student
unions." He said the idea resulted
from observations that students
who feel at home in Stanford's stu
dent unions are generally those ac
tive in organizations housed there.
"Student groups that didn't have
that kind of connection haven't felt
as much of a connection to Old
Union as an institution," Cruz said.
"While a majority of students are
involved in some group during their
time at Stanford, we felt that [Old
Union engagement] was a major
lacking issue."
The ASSU manages union
spaces in conjunction with the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA). VPSA Director of
Student Unions Jeanette Smith-
Laws, who worked on the VSO Of
fice Space Pilot Program, did not
respond to a request for an inter
view.

Cruz also said that the ASSU
has finished funding its executive
action grants for the year. The
grants are given to groups of stu
dents looking to enhance Stanford
student life in some way, and en
courage student recipients to inte
grate Old Union into their activities.
