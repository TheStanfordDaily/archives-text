Former University President Richard
Lyman died of congestive heart failure Sun
day in Palo Alto. He served as the Universi
ty's seventh president from September 1970
until August 1980.
Lyman was 88.
At the end of Lyman's 10-year presiden
cy, The Daily's Editorial Board took stock of
his legacy in an editorial titled "Sorry to see
Lyman go."
"The University is now an undisputed
member of the select club of academically
superb institutions ... What makes this
achievement even more significant is that
Lyman cemented the university's position as
a world-class institution during a period of
unrest both financial and emotional," the
editorial read.
Path to the presidency
Lyman attended Swarthmore College
before earning his master's and Ph.D. from
Harvard University. He also attended the
London School of Economics on a Fulbright
scholarship and taught history at Washing
ton University in St. Louis before coming to
Stanford as a history professor in 1958.

Before serving as University president,
Lyman also served as the associate dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences and
provost. In 1988, he founded and served as
director of the center that later became the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
The choice of Lyman to replace Kenneth
Pitzer as University president was one point
of consensus amid the otherwise turbulent
times on campus in the late '6os and early
70s.
The Daily wrote shortly after Lyman
took office that it was rare for alumni, facul
ty members, students and trustees to "agree
on anything, yet all these natural enemies
managed to agree" on Lyman.
Weathering the storm
Lyman, however, did not receive a warm
welcome to the University. During his first
convocation address in September 1970,
demonstrators employed the "give 'em the
axe" cheer normally reserved for sporting
events against Cal.
Lyman's term as president represented a
time of significant transition for the Univer
sity. He reflected in his memoir, "Stanford in
