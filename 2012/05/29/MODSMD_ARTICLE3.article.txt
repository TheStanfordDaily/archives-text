# Former President Lyman dies at 88

### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Former University President Richard
Lyman died of congestive heart failure Sun
day in Palo Alto. He served as the Universi
ty's seventh president from September 1970
until August 1980.
Lyman was 88.
At the end of Lyman's 10-year presiden
cy, The Daily's Editorial Board took stock of
his legacy in an editorial titled "Sorry to see
Lyman go."
"The University is now an undisputed
member of the select club of academically
superb institutions ... What makes this
achievement even more significant is that
Lyman cemented the university's position as
a world-class institution during a period of
unrest both financial and emotional," the
editorial read.
Path to the presidency
Lyman attended Swarthmore College
before earning his master's and Ph.D. from
Harvard University. He also attended the
London School of Economics on a Fulbright
scholarship and taught history at Washing
ton University in St. Louis before coming to
Stanford as a history professor in 1958.

Before serving as University president,
Lyman also served as the associate dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences and
provost. In 1988, he founded and served as
director of the center that later became the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
The choice of Lyman to replace Kenneth
Pitzer as University president was one point
of consensus amid the otherwise turbulent
times on campus in the late '6os and early
70s.
The Daily wrote shortly after Lyman
took office that it was rare for alumni, facul
ty members, students and trustees to "agree
on anything, yet all these natural enemies
managed to agree" on Lyman.
Weathering the storm
Lyman, however, did not receive a warm
welcome to the University. During his first
convocation address in September 1970,
demonstrators employed the "give 'em the
axe" cheer normally reserved for sporting
events against Cal.
Lyman's term as president represented a
time of significant transition for the Univer
sity. He reflected in his memoir, "Stanford in

protest era at Stanford and led the University
to become a world-renowned institution.
Turmoil." that Stanford rose from its
status as a regional institution in the
1950s to a "nationally and interna
tionally prestigious university by the
time the '7os were over."
However, this rise to promi
nence did not come without up
heaval on campus.
In his first year as president,
Lyman suspended Associate Eng
lish Professor H. Bruce Franklin for
inciting violence among students on
campus. Lyman was criticized for
this action during a Faculty Senate
meeting, in which Nobel Laureate
Linus Pauling accused Lyman of in
fringing upon Franklin's academic
freedom and individual rights.
In early 1971, students accused
Lyman of "tossing crumbs to black
students" after a meeting with Black
Student Union (BSU) leaders to
discuss demands of the group. The
co-chairman of BSU called Lyman
"blatantly negative and hostile."
BSU members had previously
taken over the stage during a speech
Lyman delivered in Memorial Audi
torium in 1968.
"We believe that the lack of re
sponse is indicative of either a shal
low interest in the questions which
affect racial groups on this campus,
or perhaps more accurately a gen
uine inability to deal with the ques
tions of racism," ASSU leaders
wrote in an May 14, 1971, op-ed
printed in The Daily.
Other on-campus protests dur
ing Lyman's politically active
tenure included protests against
CIA recruiting, ROTC training on
campus and conducting military re
search in campus labs. Students and
faculty participated in sit-ins and
protests that, in the case of the Enci
na Hall protest during Lyman's
time as University provost, shut
down University buildings. He de
clared as president in 1971 that oc
cupying a building was "not an ac
ceptable form of political action
within the University."
Lyman urged students and facul
ty to stay away from meetings and
marches in a Feb. 11,1970, radio ad
dress on KZSU one of the many
weekly addresses he gave on KZSU.
He characterized the disruptions as
"the frankly declared attempt to re
produce as much of the war as pos
sible on the Stanford University
campus."
These disruptions made their
way to Lyman's personal residence
on El Escarpado Way. The Universi
ty installed a tripwire alarm system,
a hot line to campus security, a fire
alarm wired directly to the campus
fire station and additional exterior
lighting around the house to protect
it from protestors while Lyman was
still provost.
During one incident that took
place the evening Lyman was host
ing a reception for the dean of the

School of Humanities and Sciences,
protestors threw rocks into Lyman's
upstairs windows and launched a
soda bottle filled with red paint into
the kitchen.
Lyman's time as president also
saw student uproar over more cam
pus-central issues.
In 1972, Lyman's recommenda
tion that Stanford replace its "Indi
an" mascot was so unpopular that
alumni withheld donations in
protest, despite the student senate's
support for the mascot change at the
time.
That particular point of discon
tent was not enough to keep Lyman
from raising $3OO million in the 1972
Campaign for Stanford. At the time,
it was the largest-ever fundraising
effort by an institute of higher edu
cation.
Beyond Stanford
Lyman was unanimously elected
to serve as president of the Rocke
feller Foundation upon leaving
Stanford in 1980,10 years after he
was named to the post, living out his
own declaration in 1970 that a uni
versity president ought to only serve
10 years.
"Ideally a university president
should serve long enough to accom
plish something, and not long
enough to make people think of his
accomplishments wholly in the past
tense," Lyman told The Daily in Oc
tober 1970, less than a month after
he assumed the presidency.
Lyman also served on the Na
tional Council on the Humanities
from 1976 to 1982 and as vice chair
man of the council for two of those
years.
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion established the Richard W.
Lyman Award for Faculty Service in
1983.The award gives faculty $1,500
earmarked for books and materials
in the faculty member's field of in
terest to given to Stanford libraries.
In 2002, the National Humani
ties Center inaugurated the Richard
W. Lyman Award. The award, given
to five people each year from 2002
until 2006, included a $500,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Foundation
and $25,000 prize in recognition of
academics who developed a synthe
sis between knowledge in the hu
manities and technological innova
tion.
Lyman is survived by his wife,
Jing (Palo Alto), daughters Jennifer
(Washington, D.C.) and the Rev.
Holly Antolini (Cambridge, Mass.),
sons Christopher (Searsmont,
Maine) and Timothy (Hartford,
Conn.) and four grandchildren.
The family has requested that, in
the place of flowers, memorial dona
tions be made out to the American
Friends Service Committee or the
Michelle R. Clayman Institute for
Gender Research at Stanford.

The choice of Lyman to replace Kenneth
Pitzer as University president was one point
of consensus amid the otherwise turbulent
times on campus in the late '6os and early

The Daily wrote shortly after Lyman

Weathering the storm
Lyman, however, did not receive a warm
welcome to the University. During his first
convocation address in September 1970,
demonstrators employed the "give 'em the

events against Cal.
Lyman's term as president represented a
time of significant transition for the Univer

Turmoil." that Stanford rose from its
status as a regional institution in the
1950s to a "nationally and interna
tionally prestigious university by the
time the '7os were over."
However, this rise to promi
nence did not come without up
heaval on campus.
In his first year as president,
Lyman suspended Associate Eng
lish Professor H. Bruce Franklin for
inciting violence among students on
campus. Lyman was criticized for
this action during a Faculty Senate
meeting, in which Nobel Laureate
Linus Pauling accused Lyman of in
fringing upon Franklin's academic
freedom and individual rights.
In early 1971, students accused
Lyman of "tossing crumbs to black
students" after a meeting with Black
Student Union (BSU) leaders to
discuss demands of the group. The
co-chairman of BSU called Lyman
"blatantly negative and hostile."
BSU members had previously
taken over the stage during a speech
Lyman delivered in Memorial Audi
torium in 1968.
"We believe that the lack of re
sponse is indicative of either a shal
low interest in the questions which
affect racial groups on this campus,
or perhaps more accurately a gen
uine inability to deal with the ques
tions of racism," ASSU leaders
wrote in an May 14, 1971, op-ed
printed in The Daily.
Other on-campus protests dur
ing Lyman's politically active
tenure included protests against
CIA recruiting, ROTC training on
campus and conducting military re
search in campus labs. Students and
faculty participated in sit-ins and
protests that, in the case of the Enci
na Hall protest during Lyman's
time as University provost, shut
down University buildings. He de
clared as president in 1971 that oc
cupying a building was "not an ac
ceptable form of political action
within the University."
Lyman urged students and facul
ty to stay away from meetings and
marches in a Feb. 11,1970, radio ad
dress on KZSU one of the many
weekly addresses he gave on KZSU.
He characterized the disruptions as
"the frankly declared attempt to re
produce as much of the war as pos
sible on the Stanford University
campus."
These disruptions made their
way to Lyman's personal residence
on El Escarpado Way. The Universi
ty installed a tripwire alarm system,
a hot line to campus security, a fire
alarm wired directly to the campus
fire station and additional exterior
lighting around the house to protect
it from protestors while Lyman was
still provost.
During one incident that took
place the evening Lyman was host
ing a reception for the dean of the

School of Humanities and Sciences,
protestors threw rocks into Lyman's
upstairs windows and launched a
soda bottle filled with red paint into
the kitchen.
Lyman's time as president also
saw student uproar over more cam
pus-central issues.
In 1972, Lyman's recommenda
tion that Stanford replace its "Indi
an" mascot was so unpopular that
alumni withheld donations in
protest, despite the student senate's
support for the mascot change at the
time.
That particular point of discon
tent was not enough to keep Lyman
from raising $3OO million in the 1972
Campaign for Stanford. At the time,
it was the largest-ever fundraising
effort by an institute of higher edu
cation.
Beyond Stanford
Lyman was unanimously elected
to serve as president of the Rocke
feller Foundation upon leaving
Stanford in 1980,10 years after he
was named to the post, living out his
own declaration in 1970 that a uni
versity president ought to only serve
10 years.
"Ideally a university president
should serve long enough to accom
plish something, and not long
enough to make people think of his
accomplishments wholly in the past
tense," Lyman told The Daily in Oc
tober 1970, less than a month after
he assumed the presidency.
Lyman also served on the Na
tional Council on the Humanities
from 1976 to 1982 and as vice chair
man of the council for two of those
years.
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion established the Richard W.
Lyman Award for Faculty Service in
1983.The award gives faculty $1,500

In 2002, the National Humani

W. Lyman Award. The award, given
to five people each year from 2002
until 2006, included a $500,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Foundation
and $25,000 prize in recognition of
academics who developed a synthe

manities and technological innova

Lyman is survived by his wife,

(Washington, D.C.) and the Rev.
Holly Antolini (Cambridge, Mass.),
sons Christopher (Searsmont,
