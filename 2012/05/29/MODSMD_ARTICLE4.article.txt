## Pro-Romney group ramps up campaign 
### MATT BETTONVILLE DESK EDITOR 
Now that Republican presiden
tial candidate Mitt Romney is fo
cusing his campaign on the Novem
ber general election, Stanford's Stu
dents for Romney, a chapter of the
national campaign organization
Students for Mitt, is launching its
on-campus organization.
The group is presently in the
process of electing its leadership for
the next school year, but eventually
hopes to raise support for Rom
ney's campaign by hosting debates,
a phone-a-thon and events promot
ing political awareness.
The group originally formed to
support Romney's campaign for
the Republican nomination for
president, but was largely inactive.
"We kind of knew throughout
the primaries that he was going to
win, so we were kind of waiting for
the bigger fight," said Reagan
Thompson 'l2, president of Stu
dents for Romney.
The group held a launch event
Friday afternoon to gather interest
both for participants and leadership
positions during election season
next fall. According to Students for
Romney Vice President Chip
Schroeder 'l2, about 30 people,
mostly graduate students and up
perclassmen, attended.
"Our goal for the group is to in
vite Stanford students to learn
more about Romney and consider
positions especially economic
which are not often discussed at
Stanford," Schroeder said in an
email to The Daily.
Schroeder said support was
strongest from students in the
Graduate School of Business, but
weaker among undergraduate stu
dents, perhaps due to the economic
focus of the group and the cam
paign.
"There's actually a pretty sub
stantial Republican, conservative
constituency on campus," Thomp
son said, citing the Stanford Con
servative Society, the Stanford Re
view and the Stanford Republicans
as strong organizations. "It's just a
matter of mobilizing."
Thompson said that it is unlikely
that Students for Romney will host
any events this quarter since the
year is nearly over, but the group
hopes to have a strong presence fall
quarter of next year. She added that
the group hopes to organize de
bates and panels with Stanford De
mocrats.
"There was talk of attempting to
bring Romney to campus,"Thomp
son said. "That's definitely a higher
level dream."
Romney will be in the area cam
paigning and fundraising several
times throughout the year.
In addition to supporting Rom
ney's campaign, Thompson said
that Students for Romney hopes to
raise the level of general political

conversation on campus.
"We feel like there are a lot of
students on campus who don't real
ly think critically about their politi
cal position "Thompson said. "Our
goal is ... raising the level of polit
ical dialogue on campus."
The group said that a high level
of political discussion on campus
will be an important factor in the
upcoming election.
"We're really excited that this
election likely is going to be close,"
Thompson said. "We students are
going to have a significant role ...
and we're really excited about
that-
