# CARDINAL CLEANS UP AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
It was a historic day for Stanford women's
tennis at the NCAA Tennis Championships,
as an all-Cardinal final in the singles draw was
followed by a doubles title just hours later.
Sophomore Nicole Gibbs defeated junior
teammate Mallory Burdette for the individ
ual championship before the two joined
forces to take the doubles crown 6-2,6-4.
Gibbs became only the third Stanford
player to win both the singles and doubles ti

tles in the same year at the NCAA Champi
onships. Monday's win at the Dan Magill Ten
nis Complex in Athens, Ga., made Gibbs the
15th Stanford woman to win the collegiate
singles championship and the first since
Amber Liu in 2004.
Gibbs defeated Burdette, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3
in a mentally grueling match in which she was
once a set and three games behind. Gibbs
came back to force a second set tiebreak,
where she fell behind 5-2 and once again
found herself on the brink of elimination.
In the first set, Burdette was the more as

sertive player, as she came to net successfully
and took control of the match. Ahead 4-1 in
the second set, she looked poised to run away
with the trophy. Burdette had not lost more
than three games in a set in the entire tourna
ment, and she appeared set on continuing
that dominant streak.
"I had kind of resigned myself to losing to
someone who was playing by far the best ten
nis in all of college tennis," Gibbs said. "At
that point, I was just trying anything possible

to stay in points."
Gibbs' persistence paid off.
She won three straight games as
Burdette began making un
forced errors and double faulted
on a crucial point.The set evened
out at 4-4, and after trading
breaks they went into a tiebreak.
Burdette again looked poised
to win the match, needing just
two points to clinch after jump
ing out to a 5-2 lead. But Gibbs
hung on to win five straight
points and take the set. At that
point, all of the momentum and
confidence belonged to the soph
omore, and she got an early
break on her way to a 6-3 third
set win.
The teammates would later
share the joy of winning a cham
pionship together, but that
would have to wait. As Gibbs
stood on her side looking at the

sky with a smile, Burdette sat
down on her side of the court and
stared off in disbelief.
Head coach Lele Forood
summed up how it must have felt
for her top two players.
"It's difficult. It's even difficult
for the winner because they are
really excited, but also they feel
bad for their teammate," she said.
Gibbs and Burdette gave each
other time apart to soak up the
emotions from the match, but
there was more work to be done.
"I knew there was no way I
was going to let that singles
match get in the way of us per
forming the way I thought we
could in doubles," Burdette said.
Burdette eventually found
Gibbs to tell her how proud she
was and how excited she was for
doubles.
"I told her congratulations,
and I was like 'You can come in
side. I'm fine. I'm not going to
bite. You can come inside and sit
and hang out until we go on the
doubles court,'" Burdette said.
Gibbs certainly appreciated

the gesture, and their hard
fought battle in singles only
seemed to help their play on the
doubles court.
"She was such a professional
and such a great teammate ...
We were as close as teammates
as we have ever been playing for
the championship match in dou
bles," Gibbs said.
Just over an hour later, the
two paired up on the same side of
the court to win the doubles tro
phy. Gibbs and Burdette defeat
ed Georgia's Nadja Gilchrist and
Chelsey Gullickson 6-2,6-4.
ft was the second NCAA dou
bles championship in a row for
Burdette and the first for Gibbs
after entering this year's doubles
draw as the No. 2 seed. Stanford
has now won three straight
NCAA doubles titles and 15
overall.
"We played really well, super
solid, and I couldn't be more
proud," Burdette said.
