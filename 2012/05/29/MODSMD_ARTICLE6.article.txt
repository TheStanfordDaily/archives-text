# CARDINAL CLEANS UP AT NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
It was a historic day for Stanford women's
tennis at the NCAA Tennis Championships,
as an all-Cardinal final in the singles draw was
followed by a doubles title just hours later.
Sophomore Nicole Gibbs defeated junior
teammate Mallory Burdette for the individ
ual championship before the two joined
forces to take the doubles crown 6-2,6-4.
Gibbs became only the third Stanford
player to win both the singles and doubles ti

tles in the same year at the NCAA Champi
onships. Monday's win at the Dan Magill Ten
nis Complex in Athens, Ga., made Gibbs the
15th Stanford woman to win the collegiate
singles championship and the first since
Amber Liu in 2004.
Gibbs defeated Burdette, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3
in a mentally grueling match in which she was
once a set and three games behind. Gibbs
came back to force a second set tiebreak,
where she fell behind 5-2 and once again
found herself on the brink of elimination.
In the first set, Burdette was the more as

sertive player, as she came to net successfully
and took control of the match. Ahead 4-1 in
the second set, she looked poised to run away
with the trophy. Burdette had not lost more
than three games in a set in the entire tourna
ment, and she appeared set on continuing
that dominant streak.
"I had kind of resigned myself to losing to
someone who was playing by far the best ten
nis in all of college tennis," Gibbs said. "At
that point, I was just trying anything possible
