## Race plays role in juvenile sentencing, study finds 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
A new study by Stanford psychologists re

Aneeta Rattan, lead author of the study, to the
Stanford Report.

was white; the other half were told he was black.
This was the only difference.
Participants who were given a black offend

veniles convicted of violent crimes to life in
prison without parole, compared to respondents

who had in mind a white offender.
"The fact that imagining a particular target
could influence your perceptions of a policy that
would affect an entire class of people, we think,
is pretty important to know," said Jennifer Eber
hardt, senior author of the study and associate
professor of psychology.
The Supreme Court has banned the death
penalty for juveniles and ruled in 2010 that life
without parole for non-homicide crimes violates
the Constitutional ban on cruel and unusual
punishment.
The Supreme Court is currently considering
