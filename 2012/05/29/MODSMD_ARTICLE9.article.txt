# Researchers develop nanotubes to reduce battery costs

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Matt Bettonville 
Stanford researchers have
found that carbon nanotubes could
help replace platinum in future bat
teries, significantly reducing pro
duction costs.
A carbon nanotube is a synthet
ic sheet made of pure carbon rolled
up into tube shapes. According to a
report on Nanotechnology Now's

website, these nanotubes can be up
to 10,000 times thinner than a
human hair.
This technology could replace
platinum as a catalyst in batteries,
which is a major long-term goal in
developing affordable future bat
tery chemistries, including the lithi
um-air battery, which can have up to
10 times the energy density of cur
rent batteries.
"Platinum is very expensive and
thus impractical for large-scale
commercialization," said Hongjie
Dai, a chemistry professor and co
author of the study. "Developing a
low-cost alternative has been a
major research goal for several
decades."
Two properties allow carbon
nanotubes to be useful in batteries:
electrical conductivity and catalytic
activity. Previously, nanotubes had
not performed well in batteries be
cause the catalytic property de
pends on impurities and holes in the
nanotube structure and the electri
cal property depends on the integri
ty of the nanotube structure.
However, a group of researchers
led by postdoctoral fellow Yan
guang Li, working in conjunction
with researchers at Vanderbilt Uni
versity, created a nanotube model
with both properties. The model
consists of multiple nanotubes
wrapped concentrically around one
another, with the top layer shred
ded to enhance catalytic activity.
