# Connecting women in the workplace
## 
### LAUREN MCCUNE 
Who needs titles like chief execu
tive officer or marketing direc
tor when you can be chief
inspir/instig-ation officer, chief
elevation officer, director of big
deals or chief gregarious grammarian? For those
with a penchant for innovative titles, the Levo
League offers a chance for a unique business card,
and for consumers, it offers a niche service.
The Levo League is a network dedicated to
giving young, recently graduated female profes
sionals the support and resources they need to be
successful in the corporate world. Amanda Pou
chot and Caroline Ghosn 'OB created the Levo
League to fill a void they found in the support sys
tem for young women between college and the
business world. The network provides a social
arena to connect women with opportunities and
serves as a mentoring tool through which young
female professionals can learn from others with
experience.
Based in New York City, the Levo League has
been extremely influential in movements such as
Equal Pay Day a day created to raise awareness
of the pay gaps between the sexes and Ask 4
More Day, which seeks to equalize this income gap.
What was it that prompted two venture capital
ists from the Bay Area to quit their jobs and found
an institution dedicated to advancing women in the
workplace? The two met on their first day at con
sulting firm McKinsey and Company.They bonded
over sensing an absence of help for women in the
workplace during their young careers.
"Caroline [Ghosn] and I were so struck by how
we could support each other... we thought, why
can't we bring this to a larger group of people?"
Pouchot said.
The two women come from wildly different
backgrounds. Ghosn was born in Brazil, lived in the
United States, moved to France and then went to
high school in Japan before coming to Stanford as
a freshman, where she was a member of the Stan
ford Student Entrepreneurs.
Her freshman year of "real life" was a sudden
change from the linear, grade-based definition of
success she had been used to until graduation.
Pouchot grew up in a single-mother household

in Northern California before attending UC-
Berkeley, where she majored in sociology. The
communities to which she belonged her high
school basketball team and her college sorority,
among others influenced her heavily. Pouchot
said she chose sociology because of her fascination
with how the institutions and communities around
us help create our identity, and how we as individu
als in turn create these institutions.
But after college is over, what becomes of com
munity? Pouchot and Ghosn agreed: once you
leave college, there is suddenly no one left to help
you and no well-defined community to join.
"Entering the professional world is the first time
in your life where you don't really have a plan," she
said. "Before, the plan had been, 'You're in junior
high, you go to high school. You're in high school,
you go to college.'"
The Levo League continues to provide support
for young female entrepreneurs. Earlier this
month, the League launched a mentoring program
in which less experienced members are matched
with more seasoned mentors. The following day,
the Levo League launched a graduation microsite.
"It's basically going to be like, 'Hashtag oh shit,
we're 2013!'" Ghosn said with a laugh. "It's basical
ly going to have the answers to all the questions you
have when you graduate, so nobody ever has to ex
perience how awful it is not to have the answers to
those questions ever again."
The site also recently launched a new feature
called "The Lounge," which Pouchot described as
essentially a Facebook wall to serve as a safe space
for women to ask questions, get advice and share
their stories.
"Our ultimate goal is the service of that commu
nity," Ghosn said. "We 're in the service of whatever
is needed to get to that place of elevation profes
sionally."
The founders hope to inspire students to take
advantage of all the opportunities at their finger
tips to find solutions through personal experience.
"Just remember all the unique opportunities we
have at Stanford to interact with leaders," Ghosn
said. "Take classes in something absolutely new, get
involved with start-ups ... you never know where
your passion could end up lying, and you have a
tremendous opportunity to explore it."

Equal Pay Day a day created to raise awareness
of the pay gaps between the sexes and Ask 4
More Day, which seeks to equalize this income gap.
What was it that prompted two venture capital
ists from the Bay Area to quit their jobs and found
an institution dedicated to advancing women in the
workplace? The two met on their first day at con
sulting firm McKinsey and Company.They bonded
over sensing an absence of help for women in the
workplace during their young careers.
"Caroline [Ghosn] and I were so struck by how
we could support each other... we thought, why
can't we bring this to a larger group of people?"
Pouchot said.
The two women come from wildly different
backgrounds. Ghosn was born in Brazil, lived in the
United States, moved to France and then went to
high school in Japan before coming to Stanford as
a freshman, where she was a member of the Stan
ford Student Entrepreneurs.
Her freshman year of "real life" was a sudden
change from the linear, grade-based definition of
success she had been used to until graduation.
Pouchot grew up in a single-mother household

in Northern California before attending UC-
Berkeley, where she majored in sociology. The
communities to which she belonged her high
school basketball team and her college sorority,
among others influenced her heavily. Pouchot
said she chose sociology because of her fascination
with how the institutions and communities around
us help create our identity, and how we as individu
als in turn create these institutions.
But after college is over, what becomes of com
munity? Pouchot and Ghosn agreed: once you
leave college, there is suddenly no one left to help
you and no well-defined community to join.
"Entering the professional world is the first time
in your life where you don't really have a plan," she
said. "Before, the plan had been, 'You're in junior
high, you go to high school. You're in high school,
you go to college.'"
The Levo League continues to provide support
for young female entrepreneurs. Earlier this
month, the League launched a mentoring program
in which less experienced members are matched
with more seasoned mentors. The following day,
the Levo League launched a graduation microsite.
"It's basically going to be like, 'Hashtag oh shit,
we're 2013!'" Ghosn said with a laugh. "It's basical
ly going to have the answers to all the questions you
have when you graduate, so nobody ever has to ex
perience how awful it is not to have the answers to
those questions ever again."
The site also recently launched a new feature
called "The Lounge," which Pouchot described as
essentially a Facebook wall to serve as a safe space
for women to ask questions, get advice and share
their stories.
"Our ultimate goal is the service of that commu
nity," Ghosn said. "We 're in the service of whatever
is needed to get to that place of elevation profes
sionally."
The founders hope to inspire students to take
advantage of all the opportunities at their finger
tips to find solutions through personal experience.
"Just remember all the unique opportunities we
have at Stanford to interact with leaders," Ghosn
said. "Take classes in something absolutely new, get
involved with start-ups ... you never know where
your passion could end up lying, and you have a
tremendous opportunity to explore it."
