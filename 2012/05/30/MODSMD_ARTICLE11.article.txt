## EDITORIAL Egg donor wanted,"B" students need not apply 
### 
On May 18, The Daily fea
tured an ad from an alum
nus seeking a "genius egg
donor" who would receive "excel
lent compensation." The egg
donor must be high-achieving,
with high standardized test scores,
several awards from high school
and college and an A grade-point
average. The alumnus set forth
such exacting standards hoping
that his child will eventually at
tend Stanford or another top uni
versity. The Editorial Board be
lieves that these ads have trou
bling ethical ramifications. They
distort the appropriate financial
compensation for egg donation,
thereby violating ethical guide
lines of the fertility industry, and
perpetuate the "gene myth" that
capacity for achievement is trans
mitted genetically.
The first issue is compensa
tion. Though the ad does not list
how much the egg donor will be
paid, only saying that she will re
ceive "excellent compensation,"
other ads promise compensation
of up to $50,000 for well-qualified,
Ivy League donors. However, the
ethics committee of the American
Society of Reproductive Medi
cine (ASRM) argues that com
pensation should not be used as
an incentive to donate, but should
instead cover the "time, inconven
ience, and discomfort associated"
with the egg retrieval process. Ac
cording to the ASRM, donors
should be paid $5,000 at most, and
compensation above $lO,OOO is
explicitly "not appropriate."
Despite these guidelines, egg
donation has transformed into a
free market system that threatens
to distort women's perception of
the health risks involved in dona
tion. These risks stem from med
ication that stimulates the ovary
to produce more eggs than nor
mal and can range from moodi
ness and infection to ovarian hy
perstimulation syndrome, a seri
ous condition affecting approxi
mately 6 percent of women who
take the medication. Yet as finan
cial compensation increases,
women may become more in
clined to ignore the potential
health ramifications of egg dona
tion. Ads that promise excellent
compensation subvert the ASRM

guidelines, which are in place
partly to ensure that women are
not financially coerced into ignor
ing these risks. Although Stanford
women are intelligent enough to
assess these risks, even they may
discount the future risks in favor
of present reward. Sperm dona
tion, also frequently advertised in
The Daily, does not present the
same troubling mix of potential
health complications balanced
against financial profit.
The second issue raised by egg
donation ads is the perpetuation
of a crude view of genetics that
contributes to scientific illiteracy.
Complex traits such as "intelli
gence" and academic motivation
are only partly explained by ge
netics. Yet ads such as these con
tribute to the notion that the
"ideal" versions of these complex
traits are mostly attributable to
genetic factors. While some may
argue that the May 18 advertisers
may have only wanted to increase
their chances of having a "gifted"
child, the ad states that the
donor's passed-on genes will en
able the couple's child to have the
"same special gifts" that the
donor has. This cause and effect
relationship deeply simplifies and
distorts the messy reality of
human genetics, presenting a
troubling picture of phenotypic
variation that has been chal
lenged in scientific literature sev
eral times over.
Of course, women donate eggs
for many reasons; many do so not
to raise needed money, but altru
istically to help infertile couples.
However, if the egg donation is al
truistic, the donor should be com
fortable donating to a couple that
does not specify a stringent list of
academic requirements and does
not advertise excellent compen
sation. One should donate to a
couple that abides by the ethical
guidelines set forth by the profes
sional societies regulating fertility
clinics; first, that payment not ex
ceed $5,000 and second, that pay
ment not vary based on "oocyte
quality." We have long implicitly
tolerated these ads, expressing be
musement at their outlandish de
mands, but it is time to take a
more serious look at the troubling
values such ads promote.

tribute to the notion that the
"ideal" versions of these complex
traits are mostly attributable to
genetic factors. While some may
argue that the May 18 advertisers
may have only wanted to increase
their chances of having a "gifted"
child, the ad states that the
donor's passed-on genes will en
able the couple's child to have the
"same special gifts" that the
donor has. This cause and effect
relationship deeply simplifies and
distorts the messy reality of
human genetics, presenting a
troubling picture of phenotypic
variation that has been chal

Of course, women donate eggs
for many reasons; many do so not
to raise needed money, but altru
istically to help infertile couples.
However, if the egg donation is al
truistic, the donor should be com
fortable donating to a couple that
does not specify a stringent list of
academic requirements and does
not advertise excellent compen
sation. One should donate to a
couple that abides by the ethical
guidelines set forth by the profes
sional societies regulating fertility
clinics; first, that payment not ex
ceed $5,000 and second, that pay
ment not vary based on "oocyte
quality." We have long implicitly
tolerated these ads, expressing be
musement at their outlandish de
mands, but it is time to take a
more serious look at the troubling
values such ads promote.

On May 18, The Daily fea
tured an ad from an alum
nus seeking a "genius egg
donor" who would receive "excel
lent compensation." The egg
donor must be high-achieving,
with high standardized test scores,
several awards from high school
and college and an A grade-point
average. The alumnus set forth
such exacting standards hoping
that his child will eventually at
tend Stanford or another top uni
versity. The Editorial Board be
lieves that these ads have trou
bling ethical ramifications. They
distort the appropriate financial
compensation for egg donation,
thereby violating ethical guide
lines of the fertility industry, and
perpetuate the "gene myth" that
capacity for achievement is trans
mitted genetically.
The first issue is compensa
tion. Though the ad does not list
how much the egg donor will be
paid, only saying that she will re
ceive "excellent compensation,"
other ads promise compensation
of up to $50,000 for well-qualified,
Ivy League donors. However, the
ethics committee of the American
Society of Reproductive Medi
cine (ASRM) argues that com
pensation should not be used as
an incentive to donate, but should
instead cover the "time, inconven
ience, and discomfort associated"
with the egg retrieval process. Ac
cording to the ASRM, donors
should be paid $5,000 at most, and
compensation above $lO,OOO is
explicitly "not appropriate."
Despite these guidelines, egg
donation has transformed into a
free market system that threatens
to distort women's perception of
the health risks involved in dona
tion. These risks stem from med
ication that stimulates the ovary
to produce more eggs than nor
mal and can range from moodi
ness and infection to ovarian hy
perstimulation syndrome, a seri
ous condition affecting approxi
mately 6 percent of women who
take the medication. Yet as finan
cial compensation increases,
women may become more in
clined to ignore the potential
health ramifications of egg dona
tion. Ads that promise excellent
compensation subvert the ASRM

guidelines, which are in place
partly to ensure that women are
not financially coerced into ignor
ing these risks. Although Stanford
women are intelligent enough to
assess these risks, even they may
discount the future risks in favor
of present reward. Sperm dona
tion, also frequently advertised in
The Daily, does not present the
same troubling mix of potential
health complications balanced
against financial profit.
The second issue raised by egg
donation ads is the perpetuation
of a crude view of genetics that
contributes to scientific illiteracy.
Complex traits such as "intelli
gence" and academic motivation
are only partly explained by ge
netics. Yet ads such as these con
tribute to the notion that the
"ideal" versions of these complex
traits are mostly attributable to
genetic factors. While some may
argue that the May 18 advertisers

their chances of having a "gifted"
