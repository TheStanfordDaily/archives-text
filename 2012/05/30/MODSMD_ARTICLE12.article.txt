## How a dirt road in Iraq changed my life forever 
### 
Nothing is certain in war.
The night-vision goggles
cast the road in a soft green
glow, a familiar view of Iraq. To 26
Recon Marines, it's just an ordi
nary dirt road, marked by a few
potholes, weaving its way to a vil
lage. Inside the armored vehicles,
we sit cramped and drenched in
sweat, wishing for even the slight
est breeze.
We are a special operations
unit, sent on a reconnaissance
mission into unfriendly territory. I
can't help but think back to the
year before. Will we see as much
combat? During our briefings, we
were told that the insurgency had
subsided. But nothing is certain in
war.
With every rock and pothole
the Humvee hits, I bang against
the metal armor surrounding me.
The 100 pounds of gear and am
munition that I carry weigh more
heavily as the hours pass. The
M 249 squad automatic weapon
between my legs adds to my claus

I scan ahead and to our flank,
my vision limited by a dirty, bullet
proof window. I can't see much,
but we have escaped death before
because one person spotted
something out of place.

Around 2:00 a.m., we dis

gain a feel for the locals. They're
polite, but hardly forthcoming. By
nightfall, we pack up to leave with
no new intel on insurgent activity
in the area.
As my eyes again adjust to the
night-vision goggles, Iraq turns an
eerie green. Leaving the village,
we round a small bend that wasn't
entirely visible from our vantage
point the night before.
First there's a blinding flash,
then a deafening sound. My heart
jumps to my throat, and in that
split-second I know: A roadside
bomb. A pressure-plated lED
that, somehow, four vehicles
passed without detonating. Vehi
cle Five, about 15 feet behind us, is
hit hard, its entire front end gone.
Gunny, our platoon sergeant,
lies in a crater the size of a Volk
swagen, his legs blown apart.
Flesh and blood are scattered
across the road and paint the in
side of the wrecked vehicle.
Dazed Marines stumble
through the smoke and dust, un
