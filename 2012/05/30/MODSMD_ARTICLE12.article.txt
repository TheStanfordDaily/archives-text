## How a dirt road in Iraq changed my life forever 
### 
Nothing is certain in war.
The night-vision goggles
cast the road in a soft green
glow, a familiar view of Iraq. To 26
Recon Marines, it's just an ordi
nary dirt road, marked by a few
potholes, weaving its way to a vil
lage. Inside the armored vehicles,
we sit cramped and drenched in
sweat, wishing for even the slight
est breeze.
We are a special operations
unit, sent on a reconnaissance
mission into unfriendly territory. I
can't help but think back to the
year before. Will we see as much
combat? During our briefings, we
were told that the insurgency had
subsided. But nothing is certain in
war.
With every rock and pothole
the Humvee hits, I bang against
the metal armor surrounding me.
The 100 pounds of gear and am
munition that I carry weigh more
heavily as the hours pass. The
M 249 squad automatic weapon
between my legs adds to my claus
trophobia.
I scan ahead and to our flank,
my vision limited by a dirty, bullet
proof window. I can't see much,
but we have escaped death before
because one person spotted
something out of place.

Around 2:00 a.m., we dis
mount at a house on the outskirts
of a village. We sleep in shifts until
dawn and then begin a day of pa
trols and "knock-and-talks" to
gain a feel for the locals. They're
polite, but hardly forthcoming. By
nightfall, we pack up to leave with
no new intel on insurgent activity
in the area.
As my eyes again adjust to the
night-vision goggles, Iraq turns an
eerie green. Leaving the village,
we round a small bend that wasn't
entirely visible from our vantage
point the night before.
First there's a blinding flash,
then a deafening sound. My heart
jumps to my throat, and in that
split-second I know: A roadside
bomb. A pressure-plated lED
that, somehow, four vehicles
passed without detonating. Vehi
cle Five, about 15 feet behind us, is
hit hard, its entire front end gone.
Gunny, our platoon sergeant,
lies in a crater the size of a Volk
swagen, his legs blown apart.
Flesh and blood are scattered
across the road and paint the in
side of the wrecked vehicle.
Dazed Marines stumble
through the smoke and dust, un
sure if they're hit. Doc, our corps
man, is tying tourniquets to
Gunny's mangled legs as the
ground around them turns darker.
I run my team's trauma pack
to Doc and hear Gunny, his face
twisted in unimaginable pain, ask
Doc to kill him.
There should be shock and
emotion. I am staring at a man
near death, the corpsman who
tends him kneels on a gruesome
composite of turned earth and
flesh. No mind should take in
such horror. But in war, cruelty is
commonplace. There is calmness
in our movements. We have to
focus on staying alive. I join my
fellow Marines on security, as a
radioman requests an immediate
casualty evacuation.
The chopper arrives. We load
Gunny into the chopper, and the
bird takes off.
I dig in on the side of the road.
Through a sleepless night, I again
watch Iraq basked in a surreal
green. Marines about me quietly
shift their weapons and whisper
into radios. There is no movement
in the desert.
At daybreak it starts up again.
First come the mortar rounds and
50 cal. sniper fire, then the crack
ing of AK-475. I again wonder if I
will live to see the next day.
But I did, and so did Gunny.
Gunny was there to meet us when
the team's deployment was up
five months later, already mobile

on his new prosthetics.
That was five years ago. Now
I'm a senior at Stanford, studying
political science. There aren't
many veterans here, but there are
a few of us. They all have memo
ries like mine of Humvees and
craters and worse things. When
we talk about Iraq and
Afghanistan in class, we have a
different perspective from most
students.
As the wars draw down, more
and more young people return
home with memories like these.
We study, work, hang out with
friends and talk about politics like
everyone else. But we always re
member one thing, which sets us
apart: nothing is certain in war.
Not even an ordinary dirt road.

Sergeant Chris Clark 'l2 served
two tours in Iraq ending in 2007 as
a member of the Marine Corps
Reconnaissance Unit.

I run my team's
trauma pack to
Doc and hear
Gunny ask Doc
to kill him.
