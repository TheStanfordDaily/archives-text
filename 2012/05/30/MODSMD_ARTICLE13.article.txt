# RAVALATIONS
## Why you should have a column 
### Rave Reddy 
When I sat down to come
up with this week's col
umn topic, I came to a re
alization: this was going to be my
last column. Volume 241 of The
Stanford Daily was coming to an
end, and I had one last chance to
put something out there before
my weekly revelations came to an
end. After today, a round of
columnist applications stands be
tween me and another volume's
worth of my weekly thoughts
(brought to you in neat little 650-
800 word packages).
As I tried to come up with the
most profound (and cheesiest)
ending I could possibly come up
with, I realized that I did have one
piece of advice left that I wanted
to shout from the rooftops, some
thing I wanted to say to every sin
gle student on Stanford's campus:
You should write a column.
Yes, that's right, I'm talking to
you. Granted, I'm also talking to
your best friend, your roommate,
your lab partner and your signifi
cant other, but you fall into that
category as well. You, who are cur
rently reading this column, should
pick up a piece of paper, a note
book, a laptop or an iPad (what
ever floats your boat) and start to
draft your very own version of a
weekly opinions column. After
you finish reading this one, of
course.

Now, before you roll your eyes
and think, "Yeah, right," hear me
out.
This column you're reading is
my 15th column for The Daily.
That means that over the course
of the last five months, 15 of the
many random thoughts in my
head have stopped cluttering my
already busy mind. Having a col
umn has forced me to extract one
of those thoughts each week and
put it down in writing, and not in
an unintelligible manner that
only makes sense to me, but in an
actual, logical format that makes
sense to other people when they
read it.
Not only has my column
helped me clear my mind, but
having a column has provided me
with a platform to interact with
many new members of the Stan
ford community. Writing a col
umn for The Daily has allowed me
put my face, opinions and email
out there every week, and every
week has brought me new interac
tions with Stanford students and
alumni alike. The positive emails
that I have received have been
helpful, the constructive criticism
even better and the anonymous
negative comments have simply
fueled my desire to make each
and every column worth reading.
Now, this "column phenome
non," as I have decided to name it,

isn't limited to just me. Just ask
any of the columnists from this
volume or volumes past, and I'm
sure they'd all agree: writing a col
umn is a surprisingly cathartic ex
perience.
So do yourself a favor and
write a column. I promise you, the
first time you see your column in
print, you're going to be over
come with a sense of joy and ac
complishment that's unlike any
other, and putting something
that's on your mind out there
every week will help lead you to
great discussions, whether it's via
responding to an email from a
reader or talking to your best
friends to try to come up with
your next topic.
I can't make any promises for
anyone else, but I can guarantee
you that you'll have at least one
faithful reader in me (as long as
you have a punny title)!
