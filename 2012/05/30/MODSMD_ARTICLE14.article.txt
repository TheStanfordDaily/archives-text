# BURSTING THE BUBBLE
## Making freshman year better

|H best time of your life,"
-A. we are reminded. At
the end of high school, at NSO,
every Friday. "You're only a
freshman once."
This much is true. We probably
only have one chance to make
completely new impressions, air
dropped in late September into
this new and curious conglomer
ate of people and buildings. And
as this once-in-a-lifetime mile
stone comes to a close, perhaps it
is wise to pause and reflect on
how my friends and I approached
a whirlwind year.
Some of us wish we had met
more people. My friends wish
they had been to more events
during NSO, gone to more club
meetings, been more involved. I,
on the other hand, can't stand
that kind of surface networking.
"Hi, I'm Edward. I'm probably a
PoliSci major. I'm from Canada,
but not the cold part." Limp
handshake. Rinse, repeat.
I remember sitting on my bed
in September skipping meals be
cause I hated meeting people so
much. But perhaps wrongly
I don't consider myself antisocial.
Unlike some of my friends, I
don't wish I had met more people.
I wish I knew people better.
Take just one example, I'd con
sider myself pretty close with my
PHE, Mona, but I only asked her
about where she was from last
week. Not where she was from
her nametag will tell you that
but about where she was from.
Important difference.
And so we launched into a dis
cussion about race in urban cen
ters, changing demographics, po
litical implications, all based on
what was happening on the
ground in D.C., Mona's home
town. A real, interesting, mutual
ly educational conversation be
tween an urban studies major and
a sweaty, post-workout, protein
chugging freshman.
When I went to bed that night,

the difference between "Where
are you from?" and "What's
home like?" became starkly ap
parent to me. Too often, it seems,
freshmen forget to ask the second
question.
Some of my friends wish they
had taken harder classes, more
units, worked harder in general.
They swore they would keep fit,
pick up a hobby or learn a new
language.
Not me. By the end of June I
will have taken more than 60 units
of coursework, be really into if
not too great at beach volley
ball and be learning Chinese,
But like them, I wish I had
challenged myself more. Maybe I
should've gone to dinner with the
dorm at NSO. I should've gone
out with the rest of the third floor
to play IM softball. I've only been
to Terra Happy Hour once, liter
ally picked up a drink and then
left to hang out on Wilbur Field. I
probably should've stayed and
schmoozed. But it wasn't really
my (our) element, so I (we) left.
What a shame.
Finally, I wish I didn't hear
every waking moment how much
fun I was supposed to be having.
I've commented at length before
on how happy this campus is, or
seems to be. That's a good thing.
But what if this general happiness
just makes those who aren't
doing so hot feel worse? What if
we feel we have an obligation to
be happy here (we are so blessed,
after all) and we don't have an
outlet for our frustrations?
We all go through some not-so
great times. Some bad moments
are just due to unfortunate circum
stances, but some might be because
of deeply-held problems we have

with ourselves: insecurity, commit
ment problems, being scared of
being away from home for the first
time. And freshman year is the
time you figure it all out.
But Stanford students don't re
ally like to figure our lives out, at
least not in groups. We don't like to
talk about what keeps us up at
night; we prefer to force ourselves
to sleep by inhaling shots of hard
liquor.
As a result, some of my friends
are taking their search to other
places. They're transferring, tak
ing years off, joining the military.
Good on them. Freshman year
has shown them where they need
work, whether that work is aca
demic, athletic, artistic or social.
Freshman year at Stanford has
shown many of us how we must
improve ourselves and, simulta
neously, how Stanford is not the
place to do it.
There is little else we can ask
of our education.
Freshman year has undoubt
edly had a steep learning curve
that has been a great pleasure to
slide down. And in trying to make
the most of it, I wish I had done
three things. I wish I had gotten to
know people better. I wish I had
challenged myself more. And I
wish most of all that I had under
stood that we're all here on un
even footing. Some of us have
never been away from home be
fore, Some of us have just broke
up with a dear companion. Some
of us are intimidated, unprepared,
scared. Autumn wounds do not al
ways scab with the spring bloom.
Every fresh face has a differ
ent story. And until we are at
peace with our own stories and
identities, it's probably difficult
for us to really enjoy ourselves,
comfortable in our own skins.
A shame, really, because fresh
man year is the best time of your
life.
