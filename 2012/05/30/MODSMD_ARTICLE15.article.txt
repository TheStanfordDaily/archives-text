## THE 						PITCHER AND THE PERSON 
### Mosbacher Minute JACK MOSBACHER STAFF WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of the Stan
ford baseball team from 2008-2011. Each
week, he takes a look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College World Series.
For nearly a year, Stanford junior and
starting pitcher Mark Appel has been listed
among the elite prospects in this year's Major
League Baseball draft, which will begin on
June 4. Based on his overpowering stuff, pro
totypical build and strong performance while
wearing the red, white and blue for Team
USA this past summer, Appel is one of the
most sought-after athletes in the amateur
baseball ranks. Come draft day, he is sure to
hear his name called early perhaps as early
as first overall.
This year, the coveted number one pick in
the draft belongs to Appel's hometown team,
the Houston Astros. I'm not normally big in
the prediction business, but I feel comfortable
making one here: if the Astros don'ttakeMark
Appel, they'll be making a huge mistake.
Some experiences have away of solidify
ing a place in your mind, and I will never for

get the first time I saw Mark Appel throw a
baseball. To be clear, I had seen a few guys
throw as hard, but never before had I seen
such fluidity and grace coupled with such
power and torque. It was simply spectacular.
"That," I remember thinking, "is how it is
supposed to be done."
All scouts agree that Appel has the stuff
to make it to the big leagues, matching a
dominant fastball with a devastating slider
and quality changeup. More importantly,
Mark has never been injured a huge ad
vantage in a market that depends upon
shoulder and elbow health. Based on his
stuff and stamina, few doubt that he will be
come, at the least, a quality starter for a
Major League team.
That said, Appel's stuff alone al
though undeniably impressive has not
conclusively separated him from the rest of
the pack in his draft class. Admittedly, he still
has several areas in which he needs to im
prove. In my opinion, he needs to work a little
more deception into his Ã¼ber-smooth motion
and make better use of his overpowering stuff
in two-strike counts. Unlike the drafts of the
last two years, in which the Washington Na
tionals' Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper

were obvious runaways for the top pick, this
year's draft has no clear favorite. Some scouts
aren't even convinced that Appel is the best
pitcher in the college ranks, listing Louisiana
State University's Kevin Gausman and Uni
versity of San Francisco's Kyle Zimmer as his
top competitors.
I'm not here to argue that Mark's stuff is
superior to Gausman's or Zimmer's I've
only seen Gausman on TV and have never
seen Zimmer's stuff. However, I have one ad
vantage over all of the scouts: I know both
Mark Appel the pitcher and Mark Appel the
person, and when it comes to the latter, he is
simply peerless.
Mark Appel the person is a mixture of
seemingly contradictory elements. He is a
man of strong faith and unshakable competi
tiveness. He is a relentlessly aggressive ath
lete with an unfailingly warm heart. He's far
from perfect but perfectly honest about his
own faults. Simply put, he's an A-plus human
being.
And that is why I think that the Astros
would regret not making Mark Appel the first
pick next Monday. The organization has the
opportunity to bring back a hometown kid
Mark spent most of his childhood in Houston

before moving to the Bay Area and have
the type of player that most teams can only
dream about: a star player that children will
adore and fans will love to root for. He's a
winner, a competitor and a class act. Of
course, I am not writing from an unbiased po
sition as I consider Mark, a former teammate,
one of my best friends.
With that said, I feel obligated to warn the
Astros of Mark's one glaring flaw as a base
ball player: he is, without question, the worst
hitter I have ever seen. Playing in the Nation
al League, he will eventually have to hit for
himself if (and when) he makes it to the Ma
jors. Honestly, there is a conceivable chance
that he'll never get a hit.
So, let this be a formal endorsement of
Mark Appel by one member of the Stanford
community. The only reason I don't want
Mark to go number one overall is that Stan
ford will miss him so much on the Farm for
one more year. But if Mark is called first on
June 4, as I think he should be, hopefully his
career as a Cardinal can end a few weeks later
in Omaha with a title trophy in his hands.
