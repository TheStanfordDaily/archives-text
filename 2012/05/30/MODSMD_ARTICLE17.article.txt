# A 						column four years in the making
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
I've told the story a hundred
times. Applying to college in
the fall of 2007 with the limit
ed guidance of an over
worked public school coun
selor, I decided to make a funny and
conclude my paragraph on why
Stanford was the right fit for me by
saying, "I fully support any school
that embarrasses USC on the foot
ball field." I like to think I made it in
because Dick Shaw has an incredi
ble sense of humor.
In truth, my application was any
thing but conventional or ideal. But
the way I answered that final ques
tion was representative of every
thing listed on that digital form. I
was being completely honest. Stan
ford was my top choice for a million
reasons, but mostly because it had
kickass sports. Other highly regard
ed academic institutions didn't.
Fast-forward to the present.
After following Cardinal sports for
four years, this is my final column.
I've been a writer and a fan, an eter
nal optimist and a remote-throwing
pessimist, a student who has rou
tinely delayed last-minute assign
ments to attend early-season games
against mid-major schools that I still
can't locate on a labeled map.
In a few weeks, I'll be graduating
with perhaps the greatest college
quarterback of all time; the nation's
biggest number of past, present and
future Olympians; dozens of nation
al champions; and the smartest fan
base in the country. We've all en
dured our fair share of disappoint
ment wide lefts, "rebuilding
years," losses to Cal, etc. but it
would be a crime to say we're leav
ing disappointed.

If not for any other reason, I'm
proud of the way things have been
accomplished. In the current colle
giate athletics climate, going four
years without any sort of relevant
controversy is praiseworthy in itself.
Doing it while maintaining the top
all-around program in the nation
puts Stanford in a league of its own.
Every school has its imperfections,
some more public than others, but
the fact that there hasn't even been
a hint of significant negative specu
lation for a school that undoubtedly
has a target on its back is truly re
markable.
I shouldn't use what few words I
have left to convince you to enjoy
sports on the Farm as much as I do.
I'm crazy. I wouldn't be able to prop
erly survive at some D-111 school
that arrogantly boasts three confer
ence championships in ice hockey
since 2003.1 laugh at that. Stanford
has turned me into a sports elitist,
and a damn proud one at that.
What I can do is relay stories of
friends who came to Palo Alto with
out a clue that a football had laces
and now exit as diehard opponents
of the Wildcat formation. Sports at
this institution serve several purpos
es, but none more important than as
refuge from the frightening realiza
tion that we're being counted on as
the future of this planet. It's a task
most of us are aware of and relish,
but it's also one that can get a bit
overwhelming. There's nothing bet
ter than knowing that when life is
kicking your butt, you can head over
to the southeast corner of campus
and watch your team kick someone
else's.
The incoming freshmen will
graduate from Stanford with a com
pletely different sports landscape

than we have today. Players will be
paid, conferences will be condensed
and admission standards across the
country will continue to decrease.
It's a sick and twisted reality that
has been a long time coming, but
one that will hit the Farm long after
some of the more controversial uni
versities.
My only hope is that when that
time does come, this athletics pro
gram will still have enough appreci
ation from the student body to
thrive. I pray that kids leave their
iPhone apps and CS assignments
for a few hours a week to check out
any of the world-class athletes this

campus has to offer. Regardless of
whether you care at all about sports,
you must have admiration for peo
ple who have become the best on
the globe at what they do.
I've tried for years not to be too
much of a homer, to criticize Stan
ford athletics when appropriate and
to remain objective in my analysis.
That doesn't mean I haven't passion
ately rooted for the Cardinal during
every single play of my undergradu
ate career. Whether you have loved
or hated what I've had to say over
the years, thank you so much for
reading my column. I hope we beat
the hell out of USC on Sept. 15.

Despite this sappy farewell, Zach
Zimmerman wants to stay in touch.

I've tried for years not to be too

the years, thank you so much for
reading my column. I hope we beat
the hell out of USC on Sept. 15.

I've told the story a hundred
times. Applying to college in
the fall of 2007 with the limit
ed guidance of an over
worked public school coun
selor, I decided to make a funny and
conclude my paragraph on why
Stanford was the right fit for me by
saying, "I fully support any school
that embarrasses USC on the foot
ball field." I like to think I made it in
because Dick Shaw has an incredi
ble sense of humor.
In truth, my application was any
thing but conventional or ideal. But
the way I answered that final ques
tion was representative of every
thing listed on that digital form. I
was being completely honest. Stan
ford was my top choice for a million
reasons, but mostly because it had
kickass sports. Other highly regard
ed academic institutions didn't.
Fast-forward to the present.
After following Cardinal sports for
four years, this is my final column.
I've been a writer and a fan, an eter
nal optimist and a remote-throwing
pessimist, a student who has rou
tinely delayed last-minute assign
ments to attend early-season games
against mid-major schools that I still
can't locate on a labeled map.
In a few weeks, I'll be graduating
with perhaps the greatest college
quarterback of all time; the nation's
biggest number of past, present and
future Olympians; dozens of nation
al champions; and the smartest fan
base in the country. We've all en
dured our fair share of disappoint
ment wide lefts, "rebuilding
years," losses to Cal, etc. but it
would be a crime to say we're leav
ing disappointed.

If not for any other reason, I'm
proud of the way things have been
accomplished. In the current colle
giate athletics climate, going four
years without any sort of relevant
controversy is praiseworthy in itself.
Doing it while maintaining the top
all-around program in the nation
puts Stanford in a league of its own.
Every school has its imperfections,
some more public than others, but
the fact that there hasn't even been
a hint of significant negative specu
lation for a school that undoubtedly
has a target on its back is truly re
markable.
I shouldn't use what few words I
have left to convince you to enjoy
sports on the Farm as much as I do.
I'm crazy. I wouldn't be able to prop
erly survive at some D-111 school
that arrogantly boasts three confer
ence championships in ice hockey
since 2003.1 laugh at that. Stanford
has turned me into a sports elitist,
and a damn proud one at that.
What I can do is relay stories of
friends who came to Palo Alto with
out a clue that a football had laces
and now exit as diehard opponents
of the Wildcat formation. Sports at
