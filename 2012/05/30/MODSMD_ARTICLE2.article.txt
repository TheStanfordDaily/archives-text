# OAPE cites gains with Cardinal Nights
## New program supports 44 alcohol-free events in its first year, part of a larger effort to build community for non-drinkers 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
At the end of its first academic year, the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE) has declared its newest program,
Cardinal Nights, a success, despite a minor
uptick in the number of students transported
due to alcohol overconsumption this year.
OAPE launched the initiative last fall with
the goal of increasing alcohol-free program
ming offered to students on weekend nights.
According to its website, Cardinal Nights is
aimed at both reducing high-risk drinking on
campus and building a stronger community
for non-drinkers and light drinkers.
The program has been doing a better job
addressing the second part of that goal than
the first, according to Angelina Cardona 'll,
assistant director and community engage
ment coordinator for OAPE. Cardona said
that the number of students hospitalized for
overconsumption of alcohol was slightly
higher this year than last.
There were 64 transports during the 2010-
11 academic year. There have been 66 trans
ports thus far this year. According to Car
dona, more than 20 percent of this year's

transports resulted from just two events: Full
Moon on the Quad and Mausoleum Party.
"OAPE is leading a number of initiatives
that seek to decrease high-risk drinking,"
Cardona wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Cardinal Nights is just one part of our ap
proach."
Cardinal Nights has hosted or partnered
with student groups on 44 different events
this year, including Snowchella, comedy
shows, the Frost Revival concert, Fiesta Lati
na and many others, including dances.
At the beginning of this year, a sample of
Stanford students participated in the Core
survey, which polls students to assess nation
al trends involving alcohol and other drugs
on college campuses. According to the sur
vey, 21.7 percent of Stanford students said
they would not want alcohol to be present at
parties they attend.
Cardona said the program is dedicated to
representing the desires of this segment of
the Stanford population.
"Cardinal Nights seeks to challenge the
faulty normative belief that alcohol is needed
to have fun on a college campus," Cardona
said. "We also seek to reinforce healthy be
haviors and lifestyles for our students."

In order to evaluate the success of the
Cardinal Nights program, OAPE has sur
veyed students to gauge interest in various
types of events and used Facebook to seek
student feedback. More than 400 students
have filled out the survey that Cardinal
Nights created to get reviews about its e vents.
"One goal for this year with Cardinal
Nights was to try a lot of different types of
events out and assess what students most
enjoy," Cardona said.
Jack Trotter 'l2, a senior class president,
said in an email to The Daily that he thought
Cardinal Nights was successful in that goal.
"I think there has been much greater di
versity in terms of the types of events that
various student groups have offered," Trotter
said.
In addition to these measures, Cardona
said that when the program co-sponsors an
