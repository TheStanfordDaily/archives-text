# OAPE cites gains with Cardinal Nights
## New program supports 44 alcohol-free events in its first year, part of a larger effort to build community for non-drinkers 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
At the end of its first academic year, the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE) has declared its newest program,
Cardinal Nights, a success, despite a minor
uptick in the number of students transported
due to alcohol overconsumption this year.
OAPE launched the initiative last fall with
the goal of increasing alcohol-free program
ming offered to students on weekend nights.
According to its website, Cardinal Nights is
aimed at both reducing high-risk drinking on
campus and building a stronger community
for non-drinkers and light drinkers.
The program has been doing a better job
addressing the second part of that goal than
the first, according to Angelina Cardona 'll,
assistant director and community engage
ment coordinator for OAPE. Cardona said
that the number of students hospitalized for
overconsumption of alcohol was slightly
higher this year than last.
There were 64 transports during the 2010-
11 academic year. There have been 66 trans
ports thus far this year. According to Car
dona, more than 20 percent of this year's

transports resulted from just two events: Full
Moon on the Quad and Mausoleum Party.
"OAPE is leading a number of initiatives
that seek to decrease high-risk drinking,"
Cardona wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Cardinal Nights is just one part of our ap
proach."
Cardinal Nights has hosted or partnered
with student groups on 44 different events
this year, including Snowchella, comedy
shows, the Frost Revival concert, Fiesta Lati
na and many others, including dances.
At the beginning of this year, a sample of
Stanford students participated in the Core
survey, which polls students to assess nation
al trends involving alcohol and other drugs
on college campuses. According to the sur
vey, 21.7 percent of Stanford students said
they would not want alcohol to be present at
parties they attend.
Cardona said the program is dedicated to
representing the desires of this segment of
the Stanford population.
"Cardinal Nights seeks to challenge the
faulty normative belief that alcohol is needed
to have fun on a college campus," Cardona
said. "We also seek to reinforce healthy be
haviors and lifestyles for our students."

In order to evaluate the success of the
Cardinal Nights program, OAPE has sur
veyed students to gauge interest in various
types of events and used Facebook to seek
student feedback. More than 400 students
have filled out the survey that Cardinal
Nights created to get reviews about its e vents.
"One goal for this year with Cardinal
Nights was to try a lot of different types of
events out and assess what students most
enjoy," Cardona said.
Jack Trotter 'l2, a senior class president,
said in an email to The Daily that he thought
Cardinal Nights was successful in that goal.
"I think there has been much greater di
versity in terms of the types of events that
various student groups have offered," Trotter
said.
In addition to these measures, Cardona
said that when the program co-sponsors an


M.J MA/The Stanford Daily
event with a student group, OAPE
asks the group to fill out an assess
ment after the event takes place.
More than 95 percent of stu
dent groups surveyed by OAPE
reported that their events were
successful and that they would
partner with Cardinal Nights again
in the future.
Katie Rovelstad 'l4 worked
with Cardinal Nights when plan
ning a March 16 concert with
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. She
said her experience with Cardinal
Nights was positive.
"They [OAPE] wanted to
throw a concert that would re
mind students that college could
be fun without drinking," Rovel
stad wrote in an email to The
Daily. "They aren't there to be the
alcohol police they want
everybody to be safe and still have
fun."
Baffour Kyerematen 'l5
worked with OAPE and Cardinal
Nights this year for Frosh Coun
cil's "Glow Crazy" dance.
"All of [Frosh Council's]
events are alcohol-free, so we fig
ured we might as well partner with
Cardinal Nights to get more fund
ing so our events had more appeal
and so more people would go to
them," Kyerematen said.
Based on attendance and stu
dent experience, Cardinal Nights'
most successful events so far have
been two trips to Cirque du Soleil
performances, the Macklemore

and Ryan Lewis concert and the
Frost Revival Concert, according
to Cardona.
Cardinal Nights measured the
student energy level at an average
of 3.2 on a scale from one to
four at its events, and the total
number of attendees at Cardinal
Nights events this year was 11,129.
This number counts all attendees,
not unique attendees.
Although its plans for next
year are not definite, Cardona
said OAPE has been discussing
ways to improve Cardinal Nights
for the future. One idea is to host
more consistent events, such as a
movie night each Friday.
OAPE is also looking to imple
ment more personal and creative
marketing strategies to garner
publicity for its events with Cardi
nal Nights representatives in each
dorm, according to Cardona.
During a presentation on May
18 at the Student Affairs Poster
Fair where staff in the Student
Affairs division showcase their
on-campus projects OAPE
representatives said that they
hope Cardinal Nights will have
"greater partnership with high
risk social events," such as Full
Moon on the Quad and Mau
soleum Party, which had eight and
seven transports, respectively, this
year.
Kyerematen, rising sophomore
class president, said that the presi
dents are open-minded about
working with OAPE to plan Full
Moon on the Quad next year in an
effort to prevent transports.
