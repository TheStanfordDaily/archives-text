## Antioxidant may treat autism symptoms 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
A pilot trial at the Stanford School of
Medicine and the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital showed that the antioxi
dant supplement N-Acetylcysteine
(NAC) may be an effective treatment of
certain autism symptoms in children.
The study is part of an ongoing effort
by researchers to find alternative ways to
treat serious symptoms such as irritability
and repetitive behaviors, which can sig
nificantly affect a child's development, es
pecially in learning and vocational activi
ties.
Antonio Haden, primary author of
the study and associate professor of psy
chiatry and behavioral science, said in an
article in Stanford Medicine News that he
has high hopes that NAC could be one of
the first drugs to effectively treat serious
symptoms of autism.
The trial ran for 12 weeks with 31 chil
dren, who demonstrated over that time
period an average decrease in irritability
from 13.1 to 7.2, as measured on the
Aberrant Behavior Checklist scale. Addi
tionally, the study revealed that NAC has
significantly milder side effects on its pa
tients than current treatments.
The next step for the study is to test
NAC's effects in a larger group and to de
termine how it functions within the
human body.
Meanwhile, Stanford is currently filing
a patent for use of the antioxidant in
treating autism. According to Stanford
Medicine News, one of the study's au
thors "has a financial stake" in a company
that produces the antioxidant used in the
trial.
The full study and its results are ex
pected to be published in Biological Psy
chiatry on June 1.
