# Stanford to begin construction on Arastradero Trail
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
The University announced Tuesday
that it will soon begin construction on a
$1.05 million trail stretching from
Arastradero Road to the Arastradero
Preserve, after receiving approval from
the Los Altos Hills City Council earlier
this month.
Planning and discussion of the trail be
tween Los Altos Hills and Stanford start
ed in 2006, following agreements made
that year with Santa Clara County
under the University's General
Use Permit, which places a limit on
Stanford's expansion. The trail,
however, faced a postponement
due to a lawsuit from the Commit
tee for Green Foothills.
In 2010, Stanford won the case
and continued its collaboration
with Los Altos Hills, culminating in
the offer's acceptance on May 17.
The University will directly over
see the construction of the trail,
which will include a five-foot-wide

unpaved pedestrian walkway and
two full-sized bike lanes.
Los Altos Hills Town Council
Member Ginger Summit told the
Stanford Report that she is eager
for Stanford's renovations in the
designated area.
"Through the years, this stretch
of narrow road has become in
creasingly congested with com
muter traffic, bicycles and hikers,
creating a very dangerous chal
lenge," Summit said. "With the
Stanford involvement, at last we
have been able to find a workable
solution that addresses the safety
concerns of neighbors, pedestrians,
equestrians, bikers and the auto
traffic."
