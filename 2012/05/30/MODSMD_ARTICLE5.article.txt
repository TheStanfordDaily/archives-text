## CAB to become a'branch' of ASSU 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At its last meeting of the aca
demic year, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate endorsed the
nomination of almost 100 stu
dents to University committees,
established the Community Ac
tion Board (CAB) as a perma
nent institution of the ASSU
and approved the new elections
commissioner and Publications
Board chairs.
Nine of the 15 senators were
present at last night's meeting.
Those present unanimously
approved the ASSU operating
budget for next year despite not
having a bill drafted for the
budget legislation, thus violating
the Senate bylaws.

Almost 100 students were
nominated to 40 University
committees after being inter
viewed and selected by the in
terim Nominations Commission
(NomCom), which was made up
of ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff 'l2, Graduate Student
Council (GSC) Chair David
Hsu and members from last
year's NomCom who accepted
an invitation to return in the ab
sence of an established replace
ment for the Commission.
If they receive majority ap
proval from the GSC, these
nominated students will be pre
sented as recommendations to
the appropriate University com
mittees by June 1.
The Senate also approved
Brianna Pang 'l3, a former un

dergraduate senator, as ASSU
elections commissioner for the
upcoming year.
The Senate confirmed Kath
leen Chaykowski 'l3, former ed
itor in chief of The Daily, and
Kian Ameli 'l3 of the Stanford
Chaparral as co-chairs of the
Publications Board for the 2012-
13 academic year.
Approval of the budget
After receiving the most up
dated version of the GSC sec
tion of the ASSU budget from
GSC representatives. Senate
Chair Branden Crouch 'l4
shared the budget he had re
ceived from Naveen Mahmoud,
ASSU financial manager and
CEO of Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE), with his fellow sena
tors.
Despite not having a bill to es
tablish the budget as a piece of
legislation, the Senate unani
mously approved it as the official
ASSU budget for the next fiscal
year.
The previous Undergraduate
Senate had approved a budget for
the current Association during
the last meeting of its term after
revising a few provisions in the
GSC section of the budget. How
ever, the GSC rejected the bill be
cause it objected to the Senate's
revisions, according to former
GSC co-chair Addy Satija.
As a result, the ASSU was left
without a budget for the new
term.
The Senate suspended the
rules of order at Tuesday's meet
ing to vote on the budget without
previous notice.
The ASSU Constitution states
that the Senate must pass a budg
et before the end of this fiscal
year, which will occur during the
summer. According to the consti
tution, if the Senate and GSC do
not approve a budget by this
deadline, the budget for the new
fiscal year must be identical to the
budget from the previous fiscal
year. However, last year's Senate
passed its budget in October 2011
and did not abide by this clause.
When asked about the status
of the budget after the meeting,
neither ASSU Parliamentarian
Kimberly Bacon 'l5 nor Crouch
could provide an explanation re
garding the legitimacy of the vote.
"Our budget is now official,"
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 said
after the meeting.
Institutionalizing CAB
The Senate also unanimously
approved a bill institutionalizing
the Community Action Board
(CAB) as a "service project" of
the ASSU, defined by the bylaws
as a "semi-autonomous student
run agencfy], subject to the over
sight of the President of the Asso
ciation and the relevant Associa
tion legislative bodies."
"[CAB] guarantees away for
communities to really have that
lobbying and advocacy power
with the administrators ... and
facilitates dialogue between
those communities," said Aracely
Mondragon 'l3 of CAB's activi
ties this past year, initiated by the
previous ASSU Executive.
Mondragon listed CAB's re

sponse to the Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) report and establishment
of contacts in the administration
as the board's top accomplish
ments this year.
While several senators ex
plained that the bill's intent was
to ensure CAB's existence inde
pendent of executive discretion,
they could not give consistent an
swers about CAB's role in the
ASSU or its funding source.
"It's kind of like a new branch

it's a division," Crouch said
when asked after the meeting
about CAB's role in the ASSU.
"They'll still go through the Un
dergraduate Senate to get every
thing approved, so they'll still be
accountable to the legislative
branches."
The legislation did not delin
eate CAB's expected funding
source. Bacon was the only sena
tor to ask CAB representatives
about funding and policies.
CAB Chair Holly Fetter 'l3
said she doesn't feel that CAB
funding conflicts with general
funding in the ASSU, but did not
say explicitly from where the
money for CAB will or should
come. Last year, CAB received
ASSU discretionary funding.
Because the Senate had only
nine voting members present and
wanted a clear two-thirds sup
port, senators called in Senator
Janhavi Vartak 'l5, who had pre
viously been absent. Bacon
guessed that Vartak had been "at
her dorm."
The 10 present senators then
approved the new charter of
CAB unanimously, while funding
policies and internal review
mechanisms must still be drafted.
