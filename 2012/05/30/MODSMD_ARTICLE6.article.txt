## War policy offers edge for Obama Panelists assess role of foreign policy in 2012 elect ion 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Foreign policy will likely be a
"net plus" for President Barack
Obama in the upcoming 2012
election, Professor Emeritus of
History David Kennedy asserted
Tuesday evening to a packed
Bechtel Conference Room.
"There's some reason to think
that foreign policy will be a plus
for Obama in the 2012 campaign,"
Kennedy said. "He's delivered on
his promise to wind down the Iraq
War and has largely wound down
the Afghan War."
Kennedy was one of three pan
elists at the event, titled "The 2012
U.S. Presidential Election and
U.S. Foreign Policy." David Brady,
professor of political science and
senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution, and Michael Armacost, a
former U.S. ambassador and fel
low at the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies
(FSI), joined Kennedy in a discus
sion moderated by Coit Blacker,
FSI Director.
Kennedy opened the event by
arguing that a constitutional sepa
ration of foreign policy responsi
bilities — between the ability of
Congress to declare war and the
president's role as commander in
chief and treaty negotiator has
led to natural discord between the
branches of government.
"That division of power consti
tutes ... an invitation to conflict,"
Kennedy said.
He acknowledged that foreign
policy successes and setbacks
have historically tended to accrue
to the president rather than the
legislative branch.
In attempting to establish a
correlation between notable for
eign policy incidents and electoral
outcomes, Kennedy said he was
only able to establish positive cor
relation between winding down a
predecessor's conflict and an elec
toral benefit.
Brady followed Kennedy and
attributed less significance to for
eign policy in an electoral context.
He said instead that the health of
the economy —or voters' per
ception thereof —is the critical
factor in determining the incum
bent's chance of re-election.
He acknowledged, however,
that as demonstrated by elec
toral setbacks sustained by De
mocrats in 1952 and 1968 during
the Korean and Vietnam Wars,
foreign policy has historically
been the variable most likely to
distort the impact of a healthy
economy.
"In both cases, opposition to
[ongoing wars] was sufficient to
give victory to the Republicans,"
Brady noted, despite the relative
economic prosperity at the time.
According to Brady, the up
coming election may mark a re
versal in the two political par
ties' mastery of the foreign poli
cy issue, with Obama currently
enjoying a polling advantage
over presumptive Republican
nominee Mitt Romney on a sub
ject Republicans have tradition
ally dominated.
"Going into this election, for
eign policy is an Obama strength,"
Brady said. "Most Americans
favor [the Democrats'] policies, so
in the absence of some dramatic
event, as of today, the Democrats
have an advantage on foreign pol
icy worth two to three points in the
election."
Armacost cited his own expe
riences as a diplomat in detailing
the impact of the election
process on the conduct of for
eign policy.
"Domestic considerations al
ways intrude on making foreign
policy," Armacost said. "Elec
tions have an increasingly pow
erful effect because they start
earlier and last longer."
While acknowledging that
the time and political require
ments of campaigning have
often necessitated a relatively
diminished focus on foreign pol
icy by presidents seeking re
election, Armacost said that the
incumbent has a unique ability
to implement narrative-chang
ing foreign policy course correc

tions, citing as an example
Obama's recent "pivot" toward
Asia.
"Those are policies that have
rather widespread support, and
they represent good positioning
for the election," Armacost said.
Armacost, however, said
there is currently little chance of
a dramatic shift in U.S. policy to
ward contentious issues such as
Iran or North Korea, citing the
possibility of uncontrolled esca
lation.
"Crises can be beneficial be
cause people rally around the
flag," Armacost said. "It will only
be beneficial [ultimately] if he
manages it well."
Quizzed by Blacker about the
potential impact of Iran's nu
clear policy program on the up
coming election, all three pan
elists downplayed any advan
tage to be gained by either can
didate in escalating the issue but
noted that an eventual conflict
may become unavoidable.
"If the Israelis make the deci
sion to go after what they see as
an existential threat, the presi
dent would have to support
them," Armacost said.
Questioning from the audi
ence focused largely on contem
porary issues facing the presi

dential candidates in the run-up
to the election.
Responding to a question
posed by Political Science Pro
fessor Mike Tomz on the impact
of proposed defense cuts on the
2012 election, Armacost noted
that the issue may be politically
sensitive for both parties and
will likely occupy only a second
ary role in the campaign.
"They're going to talk about
the economy, and they're going
to talk about jobs,"Brady added.
"It's going to be a nasty cam
paign."
When asked by Matthew Col
ford 'l4 about potential criti
cisms of Obama's handling of
the Arab Spring and the subse
quent geopolitical scene in the
Middle East, Brady argued that
despite some Republican criti
cism of Obama's alleged timidity
on the movement, the issue will
gain little traction with the elec
torate.
"The American people are
happy we're getting out of Iraq
and Afghanistan," Brady said.
"Romney can push that view
point, but it's not where the
American people are."

eign policy incidents and electoral
outcomes, Kennedy said he was
only able to establish positive cor
relation between winding down a
predecessor's conflict and an elec
toral benefit.
Brady followed Kennedy and
attributed less significance to for
eign policy in an electoral context.
He said instead that the health of
the economy —or voters' per
ception thereof —is the critical
factor in determining the incum
bent's chance of re-election.
He acknowledged, however,
that as demonstrated by elec
toral setbacks sustained by De
mocrats in 1952 and 1968 during
the Korean and Vietnam Wars,
foreign policy has historically
been the variable most likely to
distort the impact of a healthy
economy.
"In both cases, opposition to
[ongoing wars] was sufficient to
give victory to the Republicans,"
Brady noted, despite the relative
economic prosperity at the time.
According to Brady, the up
coming election may mark a re
versal in the two political par
ties' mastery of the foreign poli
cy issue, with Obama currently
enjoying a polling advantage
over presumptive Republican
nominee Mitt Romney on a sub
ject Republicans have tradition
ally dominated.
"Going into this election, for
eign policy is an Obama strength,"
Brady said. "Most Americans
favor [the Democrats'] policies, so
in the absence of some dramatic
event, as of today, the Democrats
have an advantage on foreign pol
icy worth two to three points in the
election."
Armacost cited his own expe
riences as a diplomat in detailing
the impact of the election
process on the conduct of for
eign policy.
"Domestic considerations al
ways intrude on making foreign
policy," Armacost said. "Elec
tions have an increasingly pow
erful effect because they start
earlier and last longer."
While acknowledging that
the time and political require
ments of campaigning have
often necessitated a relatively
diminished focus on foreign pol
icy by presidents seeking re
election, Armacost said that the
incumbent has a unique ability
to implement narrative-chang
ing foreign policy course correc

tions, citing as an example
Obama's recent "pivot" toward
Asia.
"Those are policies that have
rather widespread support, and
they represent good positioning
for the election," Armacost said.
Armacost, however, said
there is currently little chance of
a dramatic shift in U.S. policy to
ward contentious issues such as
Iran or North Korea, citing the
possibility of uncontrolled esca
lation.
"Crises can be beneficial be
cause people rally around the
flag," Armacost said. "It will only
be beneficial [ultimately] if he
manages it well."
Quizzed by Blacker about the
potential impact of Iran's nu
clear policy program on the up
coming election, all three pan
elists downplayed any advan
tage to be gained by either can
didate in escalating the issue but
noted that an eventual conflict
may become unavoidable.
"If the Israelis make the deci
sion to go after what they see as
an existential threat, the presi
dent would have to support
them," Armacost said.
Questioning from the audi
ence focused largely on contem
porary issues facing the presi

dential candidates in the run-up
to the election.
Responding to a question
posed by Political Science Pro
fessor Mike Tomz on the impact
of proposed defense cuts on the
2012 election, Armacost noted
that the issue may be politically
sensitive for both parties and
will likely occupy only a second
ary role in the campaign.
"They're going to talk about
the economy, and they're going
to talk about jobs,"Brady added.
"It's going to be a nasty cam
paign."
When asked by Matthew Col
ford 'l4 about potential criti
cisms of Obama's handling of
the Arab Spring and the subse
quent geopolitical scene in the
Middle East, Brady argued that
despite some Republican criti
cism of Obama's alleged timidity
on the movement, the issue will
gain little traction with the elec
torate.
"The American people are
happy we're getting out of Iraq
and Afghanistan," Brady said.
"Romney can push that view
point, but it's not where the
American people are."

In a Tuesday panel, Professor Emeritus David Kennedy, Professor David
Brady and former Ambassador Michael Armacost analyzed the role foreign
policy may play in the upcoming U.S. presidential campaign.
Foreign policy will likely be a
"net plus" for President Barack
Obama in the upcoming 2012
election, Professor Emeritus of
History David Kennedy asserted
Tuesday evening to a packed
Bechtel Conference Room.
"There's some reason to think
that foreign policy will be a plus
for Obama in the 2012 campaign,"
Kennedy said. "He's delivered on
his promise to wind down the Iraq
War and has largely wound down
the Afghan War."
Kennedy was one of three pan
elists at the event, titled "The 2012
U.S. Presidential Election and
U.S. Foreign Policy." David Brady,
professor of political science and
senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution, and Michael Armacost, a
former U.S. ambassador and fel
low at the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies
(FSI), joined Kennedy in a discus
sion moderated by Coit Blacker,
FSI Director.
Kennedy opened the event by
arguing that a constitutional sepa
ration of foreign policy responsi
bilities — between the ability of
Congress to declare war and the
president's role as commander in
chief and treaty negotiator has
led to natural discord between the
branches of government.
"That division of power consti
tutes ... an invitation to conflict,"
Kennedy said.
He acknowledged that foreign
policy successes and setbacks
have historically tended to accrue
to the president rather than the
legislative branch.
In attempting to establish a
correlation between notable for
eign policy incidents and electoral
outcomes, Kennedy said he was
only able to establish positive cor
relation between winding down a
predecessor's conflict and an elec
toral benefit.
