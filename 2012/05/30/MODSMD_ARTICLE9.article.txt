## ANIMAL DOCTORS 
### ILEANA NAJARRO STAFF WRITER 
Like many other Stanford students,
Alexandria Hicks-Nelson 'l2
bikes to her job after class. Unlike
most Stanford students, once she
arrives at her job she readies her
self to handle a seven-and-a-half-foot boa
constrictor, dole out goose and duck food,
release a raccoon from its enclosure and
walk ferrets named Rufus and Tully on
their leashes.
Hicks-Nelson, co-president of the Stan
ford Undergraduate Pre-vet Club, has vol
unteered at the Palo Alto Junior Museum
and Zoo for the past two years to gain expe
rience for her future career in veterinary
science. Thanks to her experience with the
club, Hicks-Nelson will be working at the
Adobe Animal Hospital this summer in
preparation for applying to veterinary
school in October.
Founded on campus 11 years ago by
Donna Bouley, professor of comparative
science and pathology by courtesy, the pre
vet club is an opportunity for undergradu
ates, graduates and even postdoctoral fel
lows to network with current veterinarians
and alumni, learn about the necessary
coursework and steps toward veterinary
school and explore the wide range of fields
that fall under the category of veterinary
science aside from animal clinics and horse
medicine.
"We're trying to provide them with what
we're really good at, but it also gives them a
unique kind of a leg up in applying to vet
school as well," Bouley said.
Bouley started the club after some of
her students were admitted into veterinary
schools but were missing required course
work that Stanford did not offer, such as
lab-based microbiology. From there,
Bouley's goal was to find interested stu
dents and keep tabs on them so they could
be fully prepared for veterinary school and
have the necessary shadowing hours and
lab work completed on time.
The Department of Comparative Medi
cine, which co-funds the club along with the
Office of Undergraduate Advising and Re
search, now hosts a range of classes and re
search opportunities for club members. Next
year, three new introductory seminars will
be added: Introduction to Animal Behavior,
Comparative Hematology and a course on
anesthesia titled, Ouch! That Hurts.
Club members meet twice a quarter
over dinner, during which they hear presen
tations from faculty members and re
searchers at the Department of Compara
tive Medicine, club alumni and other club
members. The presentations include guide

lines to follow in applying to veterinary
school, previews of classes that students
should take for their specialized field and
research opportunities.
"A lot of times pre-vets will fall into the
trap of not really going for the internships
that would best suit their expertise or inter
ests, so we do a lot of sharing of that,"
Hicks-Nelson said.
Additionally, Bouley meets with the stu
dents one-on-one to advise them on their
progress. Bouley said she hopes the club
can also expose students to a wide range of
career opportunities they may not realize
exists.
"Clinical medicine is a great practice,
but a lot of students think that's all there is,"
Bouley said. "They don't realize that you
can get into board specialties, research,
public health and all of these different
things that veterinarians are crucial to in
today's world."
To draw in more members and create a
presence on campus, the club hosts a Pre-
Vet Club Expo every other year, in which
they invite speakers currently working in
the field, current vet school students and
Stanford alumni to host panels or work
shops and have lunch conversations with
visiting high school students and Bay Area
pre-vet college students.
The goal of the expo is to get students to
think about a career as veterinarians ahead
of time to ensure they plan their curriculum
accordingly. Because of the small number
of accredited veterinary schools in the
country, the application process is excep
tionally competitive.
"Nowadays for vet students to be com
petitive these kids have thousands of hours
of vet shadowing, and that's pretty hard to
do if you only started in your junior year of
college," Bouley said. "They need to be
thinking about this even in high school."
However, Bouley still encourages late
involvement both in the club and the career
path. She herself spent most of her early ca
reer as a gymnastics coach and judge until
she discovered an interest in pathology re
search.
"The message that I try to give to them
is that first of all, all experience is good ex
perience, even if it was a bad experience,
because you then know what you don't
want to do," Bouley said.
While Stanford has a record of nearly
100 percent acceptance of its students to
veterinary schools, club alumna Claudia
Chern 'll, who now works as a veterinary
assistant at a San Francisco clinic, said she
found it difficult being a pre-vet student at
a pre-med dominated school like Stanford.
"I still think that it's pretty hard to be
pre-vet at Stanford because the opportuni

ties are for human medicine, but it was
helpful for Dr. Bouley to mentor us be
cause she really helps everyone find places
to get needed experience at a place where
it's all human medicine," Chern said.
Hicks-Nelson said that if it weren't for
the club and its connection with the De
partment of Comparative Medicine, she
probably wouldn't have been able to attend
a summer internship at the New England
Wildlife Center. Only the Department of
Comparative Medicine would pay for the
necessary rabies vaccinations that the biol
ogy department couldn't offer.
"As much as I wish that there was a spe
cific animal sciences major, just being in the
biology department and being a pre-vet
have been different ways of helping me

out," Hicks-Nelson said.
By banding together in collaboration
with the Department of Comparative Med
icine, Stanford's small group of veterinari
an hopefuls said they have been supported
in chasing an unorthodox career path.
"We have had students [who] have gone
on to vet school and are currently in pathol
ogy residencies [or] Ph.D. programs, and
one of our alums is coming back as a lab an
imal resident," Bouley said. "It's a small
group, but I think we have a big impact rel
ative to the numbers of people that are
going on to these alternative types of vet
careers."
