## MODERN MANNERS End-of-year memos 
### Jeff Mandell 
The academic year is coming
to an end, which means that
this column is wrapping up
today. I have new respect for the
students at The Daily who pump
out publishable material day after
day, because it is hard enough to
make something worth reading
once a week, as I have tried to do.
Thank you to everyone who has
read any of my columns! There
are lots of things you could be
doing with your free time, and I'm
honored that you chose to spend
part of it reading my thoughts on
life at Stanford. Since this is my
last time on the soapbox, I would
like to tie up some loose ends and
throw out some opinions that
never quite justified their own
columns. In no particular order, I
now present a series of end-of
year memos.
Memo to Public Safety: Plant
ing police officers on Santa Teresa
Street has not conditioned me to
stop at stop signs; it has taught me
to look both ways for the police
before crossing an intersection. In
your favor, I'll admit that it would
be smarter if I watched out for
cross traffic instead of scanning
nearby bushes and parking lots
for hidden law enforcement.
Memo to People Who Think
"Avatar" Is Like Real Life: Last
week, I was sitting next to a young
woman having a deep conversa
tion with a male friend. At one
point, as the two were lamenting
the lost joys of a simpler life, the
woman said something like "It
would be really great if we could
just live off the land, like in
Avatar.' You know, the blue peo
ple." I think this thought says
more about the impact of the In
ternet age than any statistic about
how much we are plugged into
our phones and laptops. If you
want to learn about a less techno
logical existence, Willa Cather or
Laura Ingalls Wilder might be

more illuminating than a sci-fi
movie featuring a computer-gen
erated war between humans and
20-foot-tall aliens.
Memo to Pizza Lovers: My col
umn about the difficulty of finding
great pizza in the Bay Area got me
a lot of restaurant recommenda
tions. I haven't gone to all of them
yet, but I did find some good Ital
ian-style pizza. The point of my
column still stands, though, be
cause none of them are cheap
enough to be frequently enjoyed
on a student budget. The three
places I recommend are all sit
down restaurants, and the cheap
est option is to order take-out. In
Mountain View, there is Napole
tana Pizzeria, where a decent
margherita pizza costs $l5. The
other two places, which are defi
nitely superior, are Pizzeria Delfi
na and Al6, where the margherita
pizzas are $l3 and $l5, respective
ly. The pizzas are very good, and
they remind me of Italy. Unfortu
nately, Delfina and Al6 are both
in San Francisco, and their upscale
atmospheres would prevent them
from being everyday destinations
even if we were closer to Stanford.
Memo to the Suites Killdeer
Family: Congratulations to the
killdeer who nested in the tanbark
at Governor's Corner on the
hatching of their three precocious
chicks. I saw the fluffy little guys
running in the grass the day they
were born, smaller than tennis
balls. And special thanks to who
ever put yellow caution tape
around the nest to keep it safe!
