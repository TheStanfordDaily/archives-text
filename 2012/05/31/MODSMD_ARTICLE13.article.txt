# SEEING GREEN
## Giving solar its just deserts 
### Holly Moeller 
When I was small, the word
"desert" conjured im
ages of towering Saha
ran dunes: windswept sand punc
tuated by rare oases, the only sign
of life an occasional animal track
quickly buried by the next sand
storm. Then, when I was 13, my
parents took me to the Southwest.
We visited Saguaro, Joshua Tree
and other parts of the Mojave
Desert, chased tarantulas, and
watched cactus wrens build nests.
Since then, I've been hooked
on the desert and the quirky
plants and animals adapted to its
harsh conditions. I've returned
often: to glimpse the winter rains,
stand at the lowest point on the
continent and even track rare
desert tortoises. Though I will al
ways find my "home" in the damp
forests of the Pacific Northwest,
part of me is a born-again desert

rat.
Over the course of American
history, however, most of our
country's citizens have held my
childhood view: that deserts are
barren wastelands full of deadly
hazards. They have often been
correct; during the great westward
migration of the mid-1800s, many
would-be settlers lost their lives
on the hot, dry expanses. And with
no available irrigation water,
deserts have become mining
grounds or, where they lack min
eral value, military staging and
testing grounds. In general,
though, deserts have been consid
ered rather useless.
So it was with delight that we
turned to the deserts as the
prospective site of massive new
solar installations. The sun, so long
the bane of desert-goers, could be
come the cornerstone for the new
green economy by providing a po
tent, renewable source of electric
ity. As solar panel technology has
improved, installations have been
planned across America's deserts.
Many of these installations are
landing in California, where
extra-sunny environs are located
next to the high electricity de
mands of sprawling population
centers. And the state, which
hopes to produce a third of its
electricity from renewable
sources by 2020, has mostly wel
comed the industry. Today, Cali
fornia has the largest installed
solar capacity of any state
1,877 megawatts, with another
3,373 megawatts in the works.
Among the new installations
may be the McCoy Solar Energy
Project, slated to add 750
megawatts of capacity by 2016.
Last week, the Bureau of Land
Management released a prelimi
nary Environmental Impacts
Statement for the project, which
would cover 7,700 acres in the
Colorado Desert. For compari
son, Stanford's contiguous penin
sula property including the
Dish, SLAC, Jasper Ridge and
various shopping and business
complexes, totals 8,180 acres.
But the plan will doubtless
find critics in those who see
deserts as more than desolate
deathscapes. Past installations
have drawn criticism from Amer
ican Indian groups protecting cul
tural heritage sites, and from en
vironmental groups worried over
the fate of more than 70 threat
ened and endangered species in
the region.
In an attempt to be proactive,
Californian stakeholders have
spent the last two years drafting
the Desert Renewable Energy
Conservation Plan, which would
streamline permitting of renew
able energy across 22 million
acres of the Mojave and Col
orado deserts, while protecting
species like the Mojave ground
squirrel, burrowing owl and
desert tortoise. The plan, due out
next month, should help recon
cile conservation and preserva
tion aims with the larger environ
mental and economic concerns
driving the renewable energy sec
tor, but it won't arrive in time for
the McCoy Project decision.

For now, deserts represent the
low-hanging fruit for industry
members focused on centralized,
large-scale solar installations. Not
only is the light right, but compet
ing land uses are rare where
else in California would McCoy
find the space for enough solar
panels to power 260,000 homes?
Yet, the more of Earth's sur
face we commandeer for our own
purposes, the fewer of our co-in
habitants we'll share it with. No
matter how carefully installation
sites are selected or how many an
imals are relocated, an acre cov
ered by solar panels is an acre lost
from the desert ecosystem.
That's another good reason for
keeping solar energy supplies lo
calized. Solar panels are ideal for
distributed energy collection:
they can be (and are) placed on
roofs, alongside buildings and
atop streetlights.
Back in 2007, a National Re
newable Energy Laboratory re
port calculated the area of in
stalled solar panels needed to meet
the average American's electricity
needs. Using five-year-old technol
ogy, each person needs a photo
voltaic bank of 181 square meters
less than a lane and a half of an
Olympic-sized swimming pool
to meet both personal and indus
trial needs. That's the areal equiva
lent of 12 percent of our developed
area footprint, or 22 percent of our
urban area footprint.
Granted, we can't just enrobe
our cities in a bubble of solar pan
els. Day lighting, rooftop gardens
and a general desire to see the sky
preempt that. But as economics
and technological advances drive
renewable energy closer to viabil
ity, one can only hope that we take
serious steps towards integrating
solar panels into existing infra
structure needs.
Saving the deserts? Just an
added bonus.

Dish, SLAC, Jasper Ridge and
various shopping and business
complexes, totals 8,180 acres.
But the plan will doubtless
find critics in those who see
deserts as more than desolate
deathscapes. Past installations
have drawn criticism from Amer
ican Indian groups protecting cul
tural heritage sites, and from en
vironmental groups worried over
the fate of more than 70 threat
ened and endangered species in
the region.
In an attempt to be proactive,
Californian stakeholders have
spent the last two years drafting
the Desert Renewable Energy
Conservation Plan, which would
streamline permitting of renew
able energy across 22 million
acres of the Mojave and Col
orado deserts, while protecting
species like the Mojave ground
squirrel, burrowing owl and
desert tortoise. The plan, due out
next month, should help recon
cile conservation and preserva
tion aims with the larger environ
mental and economic concerns
driving the renewable energy sec
tor, but it won't arrive in time for
the McCoy Project decision.

For now, deserts represent the
low-hanging fruit for industry
members focused on centralized,
large-scale solar installations. Not
only is the light right, but compet
ing land uses are rare where
else in California would McCoy
find the space for enough solar
panels to power 260,000 homes?
Yet, the more of Earth's sur
face we commandeer for our own
purposes, the fewer of our co-in
habitants we'll share it with. No
matter how carefully installation
sites are selected or how many an
imals are relocated, an acre cov
ered by solar panels is an acre lost
from the desert ecosystem.
That's another good reason for
keeping solar energy supplies lo
calized. Solar panels are ideal for
distributed energy collection:
they can be (and are) placed on
roofs, alongside buildings and
atop streetlights.
Back in 2007, a National Re
newable Energy Laboratory re
port calculated the area of in
stalled solar panels needed to meet
the average American's electricity
needs. Using five-year-old technol
ogy, each person needs a photo
voltaic bank of 181 square meters
less than a lane and a half of an
Olympic-sized swimming pool
to meet both personal and indus
trial needs. That's the areal equiva
lent of 12 percent of our developed
area footprint, or 22 percent of our
urban area footprint.
Granted, we can't just enrobe
our cities in a bubble of solar pan
els. Day lighting, rooftop gardens
and a general desire to see the sky
preempt that. But as economics
and technological advances drive
renewable energy closer to viabil
ity, one can only hope that we take
serious steps towards integrating
solar panels into existing infra
structure needs.
Saving the deserts? Just an
added bonus.

California has
the largest
installed solar
capacity of
any state.

When I was small, the word
"desert" conjured im
ages of towering Saha
ran dunes: windswept sand punc
tuated by rare oases, the only sign
of life an occasional animal track
quickly buried by the next sand
storm. Then, when I was 13, my
parents took me to the Southwest.
We visited Saguaro, Joshua Tree
and other parts of the Mojave
Desert, chased tarantulas, and
watched cactus wrens build nests.
Since then, I've been hooked
on the desert and the quirky
plants and animals adapted to its
harsh conditions. I've returned
often: to glimpse the winter rains,
stand at the lowest point on the
continent and even track rare
desert tortoises. Though I will al
ways find my "home" in the damp
forests of the Pacific Northwest,
part of me is a born-again desert

rat.
Over the course of American
history, however, most of our
country's citizens have held my
childhood view: that deserts are
barren wastelands full of deadly
hazards. They have often been
correct; during the great westward
migration of the mid-1800s, many
would-be settlers lost their lives
on the hot, dry expanses. And with
no available irrigation water,
deserts have become mining
grounds or, where they lack min
eral value, military staging and
testing grounds. In general,
though, deserts have been consid
ered rather useless.
So it was with delight that we
turned to the deserts as the
prospective site of massive new
solar installations. The sun, so long
the bane of desert-goers, could be
come the cornerstone for the new
green economy by providing a po
tent, renewable source of electric
ity. As solar panel technology has
improved, installations have been
planned across America's deserts.
Many of these installations are
landing in California, where
extra-sunny environs are located
next to the high electricity de
mands of sprawling population
centers. And the state, which
hopes to produce a third of its
electricity from renewable
sources by 2020, has mostly wel
comed the industry. Today, Cali
fornia has the largest installed
solar capacity of any state
1,877 megawatts, with another
3,373 megawatts in the works.
Among the new installations
may be the McCoy Solar Energy
Project, slated to add 750
megawatts of capacity by 2016.
Last week, the Bureau of Land
Management released a prelimi
nary Environmental Impacts
Statement for the project, which
would cover 7,700 acres in the
Colorado Desert. For compari
son, Stanford's contiguous penin
sula property including the
Dish, SLAC, Jasper Ridge and
various shopping and business
complexes, totals 8,180 acres.
