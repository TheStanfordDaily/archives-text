# MLB lacks stars from Stanford
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
As the MLB draft ap
proaches and the
NCAA tournament
opens up this Friday, it's
easy to spend a lot of
time checking out the top prospects
who are hoping to spur their teams on
to victory in Omaha this June.
Every season, one star will saddle
up the rest of his team and carry
them along in the postseason, get
ting the big outs or hits when the
team needs it most, collect all the ac
colades he can hold, then go on to a
lucrative pro career.
But Stanford baseball's recent
postseason runs have had a distinct
lack of these stars at least, it's had a
distinct lack of any players that have
gone on to be real superstars at the
major league level. Since 1987, the
Cardinal has had 22 players picked in
the first round of the MLB draft, and
yet, the casual baseball fan would
probably only know one or two of
those 22 players.
Those two are Mike Mussina, a
five-time All-Star with the Orioles
and Yankees who compiled a 270-
153 record before retiring in 2008,
and Carlos Quentin, a two-time All-
Star with the White Sox before he
was traded to the Padres this season.
One is a potential Hall of Famer;the
other is a pretty good player who
might be the fourth outfielder on
your fantasy team.
When looking at the list of names
that haven't worked out (players like
Greg Reynolds, Jeff Austin, Danny
Putnam, Willie Adams and more), a
question springs to mind: Does Stan
ford baseball have a development
problem? Or, more specifically, why
exactly have Stanford's players never
quite taken the leap into stardom?
It's hard to answer this because it
does take a while before most players
make any real difference to their
clubs guys like Buster Posey and
Bryce Harper, who come in and
make an impact right away, are ex
traordinarily rare in pro baseball. So
for some former Stanford products
like Rick Helling and David McCar
ty, both of whom had 12-year MLB
careers, it's far too harsh to say they
didn't exactly pan out.
That said, Stanford baseball prod
ucts seem to hit a ceiling of good-but
not-great once they reach "The
Show." Does the college game some
how sap these players' potential be
fore they reach the big leagues? It's
hard to know. Every player is differ
ent, every farm system is different,
and the nature of the game of base
ball has changed a lot over the past 25
years, with the boom and bust of the
steroid era. Perhaps it just might
mean that the major league teams
that picked these players incorrectly
evaluated just how talented these
players really were. Future Hall of
Famer Albert Pujols was a 13th
round pick.
However checkered the Cardi
nal's past may have been, perhaps this
recent group of Cardinal minor and
major leaguers will buck that trend,
although the Cardinal's current crop
has been plagued by injuries.
Drew Storen, who was picked
10th overall in 2009, has been solid
for the Washington Nationals in his
role as a setup man and closer,
recording 43 saves a season ago be
fore an arm injury that has sidelined
him so far in 2012.
Catcher Jason Castro starts be
hind the plate just about every other
day for the Houston Astros, but he's
only hit a meager .216 this year after
missing all of last year with a torn
ACL.
Sean Ratliff a member of the2ooB
Cardinal CWS team and a fourth
round pick of the New York Mets,
was crushing his way through the mi
nors until he was hit in the eye with a
foul ball last season. Four eye surger
ies later, Ratliff is closer to being back
on track, but who knows where he
might be today or where he might
have been in the future —without
the unlucky and unfortunate injury?
Following them, current players
like Mark Appel, Stephen Piscotty.
Austin Wilson, Brian Ragira or Chris
Reed, the Cardinal closer who was
picked 16th overall by the Dodgers in
last year's draft, could break through
that ceiling and become Stanford's
next major league star.
Hopefully, one of those guys will
first take the 2012 Cardinal and lead it
to a win in the College World Series
this year then use that new hard
ware to spring himself into a super
star professional career.

future stars remember him before
they hit it big. Before you make mil

As the MLB draft ap
proaches and the
NCAA tournament
opens up this Friday, it's
easy to spend a lot of
time checking out the top prospects
who are hoping to spur their teams on
to victory in Omaha this June.
Every season, one star will saddle
up the rest of his team and carry
them along in the postseason, get
ting the big outs or hits when the
team needs it most, collect all the ac
colades he can hold, then go on to a
lucrative pro career.
But Stanford baseball's recent
postseason runs have had a distinct
lack of these stars at least, it's had a
distinct lack of any players that have
gone on to be real superstars at the
major league level. Since 1987, the
Cardinal has had 22 players picked in
the first round of the MLB draft, and
yet, the casual baseball fan would
probably only know one or two of
those 22 players.
Those two are Mike Mussina, a
five-time All-Star with the Orioles
and Yankees who compiled a 270-
153 record before retiring in 2008,
and Carlos Quentin, a two-time All-
Star with the White Sox before he
was traded to the Padres this season.
One is a potential Hall of Famer;the
other is a pretty good player who
might be the fourth outfielder on
your fantasy team.
When looking at the list of names
that haven't worked out (players like
Greg Reynolds, Jeff Austin, Danny
Putnam, Willie Adams and more), a
question springs to mind: Does Stan
ford baseball have a development
problem? Or, more specifically, why
exactly have Stanford's players never
quite taken the leap into stardom?
It's hard to answer this because it
does take a while before most players
make any real difference to their
clubs guys like Buster Posey and
Bryce Harper, who come in and
make an impact right away, are ex
traordinarily rare in pro baseball. So
for some former Stanford products
like Rick Helling and David McCar
ty, both of whom had 12-year MLB
careers, it's far too harsh to say they
didn't exactly pan out.
That said, Stanford baseball prod
ucts seem to hit a ceiling of good-but
not-great once they reach "The
Show." Does the college game some
how sap these players' potential be
fore they reach the big leagues? It's
hard to know. Every player is differ
ent, every farm system is different,
and the nature of the game of base
ball has changed a lot over the past 25
years, with the boom and bust of the
steroid era. Perhaps it just might
mean that the major league teams
that picked these players incorrectly
evaluated just how talented these
players really were. Future Hall of
Famer Albert Pujols was a 13th
round pick.
However checkered the Cardi
nal's past may have been, perhaps this
recent group of Cardinal minor and
major leaguers will buck that trend,
although the Cardinal's current crop
has been plagued by injuries.
Drew Storen, who was picked
10th overall in 2009, has been solid
for the Washington Nationals in his
role as a setup man and closer,
recording 43 saves a season ago be
fore an arm injury that has sidelined
him so far in 2012.
