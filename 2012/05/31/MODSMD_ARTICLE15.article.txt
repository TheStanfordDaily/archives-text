## LOOK BACK AT'87-'88 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
With the 2012 NCAA baseball tournament
opening up on Friday, it's the season to re
member when, 25 years ago, the Stanford
baseball team was the king of college baseball.
In a back-and-forth affair, the Cardinal
bested the Oklahoma State Cowboys 9-5 at
Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium to capture its
first College World Series title on June 7,
1987.
"It's the thrill of a lifetime," junior catcher
Doug Robbins told The Daily on the day
after the championship. "It's one of the great
est things that's ever happened in my life."
"I can't describe the feeling," said senior
leftfielder Ruben Amaro. "It's the best thing
in the world."
Buoyed by All-American starter Jack Mc-
Dowell, who pitched seven innings on only
two days rest in his third start in the double
elimination world series, the Cardinal rallied
from a 3-2 deficit in the fifth inning to pull
ahead 6-4, then tacked on three insurance
runs in the ninth before the final out. A
bouncing ball went straight back to closer
Steve Chitren, who tossed it to first base to se
cure the title.
The Cardinal also benefited from short
stop David Esquer, who turned four double
plays for the second consecutive game, and
once again from freshman rightfielder Paul
Carey, who continued his impressive hitting

in Omaha by going 3-for-5 with two RBI and
scoring two runs of his own en route to being
named the MVP of the College World Series.
In its run to the title, Stanford beat Geor
gia 3-2, beat Texas 6-1 and lost to Oklahoma
State, 6-2, forcing it into an elimination game
with Louisiana State.
That's where Carey, even before the final
game against the Cowboys, had made himself
the MVP of the series.
Down 5-2 in the 10th inning to the Tigers,
Carey, who was 2-for-13 so far in the series,
smashed an opposite-field grand slam over
the left-field fence to give the Cardinal a 6-5
win and eliminate LSU.
"After that one, I kind of knew, to be hon
est with you, I mean, to come back and win it
like that, maybe it is our year, and it proved to
be our year," Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess told ESPN after the title win.
With all the momentum in its favor, the
Cardinal bested Texas once again, 9-3, to
reach the final game against the Cowboys.
Stanford had never finished higher than
third in five previous trips to Omaha, and had
lost three straight to OSU over the last two
seasons, including the 6-2 loss the week be
fore, leading to some extra motivation for the
Cardinal well before the College World Se
ries.
"At the beginning of the season in January,
the team got together at my house for my 21st
birthday party, and we made a toast to a na
tional championship over Oklahoma State.

I'm not making this up," McDowell told The
Daily.
Carey, in his post-title game interview with
ESPN, said the team knew that it was finally
its year after the LSU victory.
"Yeah we felt destined, this is just an unbe
lievable feeling, we knew we could do it, we
had to do it against Texas when we played
them tonight, we knew we could do it, we just
had to go out and swing the bats the way we
could," a breathless Carey responded.
"I don't know if you know it, but you are
the most valuable player in this tournament,"
the reporter responded.
"I don't know about that, but this team,
this is the most valuable team by far," Carey
said in his heavy Boston accent. "We came
back, fought, everybody got big hits for us this
whole tournament."
The next year, the Cardinal would repeat
as College World Series champions, taking a
less dramatic route to the national title, win
ning every game in Omaha, including a 9-4
win over Arizona State in the championship
game. Perhaps the most impressive thing
about the repeat title run was that the Cardi
nal was without three of its stars from 1987
McDowell, Amaro and Esquer.
McDowell, who was picked fifth overall in
the draft by the White Sox in 1987, played in
the majors for 12 years and recorded a career
record of 127-87. The Van Nuys, Calif., native

Stanford baseball head coach Mark Marquess (above) has led the Cardinal for 36 years, but his two best seasons came back-to-back, when

went on to make three All-Star
teams, and captured the 1993
American League Cy Young
Award when he led the White Sox
to the ALCS against the eventual
world champion Toronto Blue
Jays.
Interestingly, series opponents
McDowell and Oklahoma State's
Robin Ventura, who had an
NCAA Division I record 58-
game hit streak in 1987, played to
gether on the Chicago White Sox
from 1989 to 1994.
Amaro, who led the Cardinal
in runs, triples and stolen bases as
a senior, went on to an eight-year
MLB career with the Angels, Indi
ans and Phillies. After his playing
career ended, Amaro joined the
Phillies as the assistant general
manager in 1998, and was promot
ed to general manager in 2008,
where he remains one of the most

influential executives in the MLB.

Esquer, who played three sea
sons in the minors, became an as
sistant coach at Stanford in 1991,
then became head coach of the
Cal Bears in 2000. In his 12 years
at Berkeley, Esquer has been
named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
in 2001 and NCAA Coach of the
Year in 2011, when he took the
Bears to the College World Series.
Meanwhile, Carey, the 1987
World Series hero, never found
any footing in the majors, playing
only 18 games with the Baltimore
Orioles in 1993.
Today, it's been 24 years since
the Cardinal held the College
World Series trophy aloft in
Omaha, despite making it to the
title game in 2000,2001 and 2003.
But perhaps the 2012 Cardinal
team, hosting a regional for the
first time since 2008, can return to
Omaha and finally return the title
to the Farm after more than two
decades away.

Stanford baseball head coach Mark Marquess (above) has led the Cardinal for 36 years, but his two best seasons came back-to-back, when
Stanford won the national title in both 1987 and 1988. A quarter-century after the first title, Marquess and Stanford look to do it again this year.
went on to make three All-Star
teams, and captured the 1993
American League Cy Young
Award when he led the White Sox
to the ALCS against the eventual
world champion Toronto Blue
Jays.
Interestingly, series opponents
McDowell and Oklahoma State's
Robin Ventura, who had an
NCAA Division I record 58-
game hit streak in 1987, played to
gether on the Chicago White Sox
from 1989 to 1994.
Amaro, who led the Cardinal
in runs, triples and stolen bases as
a senior, went on to an eight-year
MLB career with the Angels, Indi
ans and Phillies. After his playing
career ended, Amaro joined the
Phillies as the assistant general
manager in 1998, and was promot
ed to general manager in 2008,
where he remains one of the most

influential executives in the MLB.

Esquer, who played three sea
sons in the minors, became an as
sistant coach at Stanford in 1991,
then became head coach of the
Cal Bears in 2000. In his 12 years
at Berkeley, Esquer has been
named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
in 2001 and NCAA Coach of the
Year in 2011, when he took the
Bears to the College World Series.
Meanwhile, Carey, the 1987
World Series hero, never found
any footing in the majors, playing
only 18 games with the Baltimore
Orioles in 1993.
Today, it's been 24 years since
the Cardinal held the College
World Series trophy aloft in
Omaha, despite making it to the
title game in 2000,2001 and 2003.
But perhaps the 2012 Cardinal
team, hosting a regional for the
first time since 2008, can return to
Omaha and finally return the title
to the Farm after more than two
decades away.

With the 2012 NCAA baseball tournament
opening up on Friday, it's the season to re
member when, 25 years ago, the Stanford
baseball team was the king of college baseball.
In a back-and-forth affair, the Cardinal
bested the Oklahoma State Cowboys 9-5 at
Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium to capture its
first College World Series title on June 7,
1987.
"It's the thrill of a lifetime," junior catcher
Doug Robbins told The Daily on the day
after the championship. "It's one of the great
est things that's ever happened in my life."
"I can't describe the feeling," said senior
leftfielder Ruben Amaro. "It's the best thing
in the world."
Buoyed by All-American starter Jack Mc-
Dowell, who pitched seven innings on only
two days rest in his third start in the double
elimination world series, the Cardinal rallied
from a 3-2 deficit in the fifth inning to pull
ahead 6-4, then tacked on three insurance
runs in the ninth before the final out. A
bouncing ball went straight back to closer
Steve Chitren, who tossed it to first base to se
cure the title.
The Cardinal also benefited from short
stop David Esquer, who turned four double
plays for the second consecutive game, and
once again from freshman rightfielder Paul
Carey, who continued his impressive hitting

in Omaha by going 3-for-5 with two RBI and
scoring two runs of his own en route to being
named the MVP of the College World Series.
In its run to the title, Stanford beat Geor
gia 3-2, beat Texas 6-1 and lost to Oklahoma
State, 6-2, forcing it into an elimination game
with Louisiana State.
That's where Carey, even before the final
game against the Cowboys, had made himself
the MVP of the series.
Down 5-2 in the 10th inning to the Tigers,
Carey, who was 2-for-13 so far in the series,
smashed an opposite-field grand slam over
the left-field fence to give the Cardinal a 6-5
win and eliminate LSU.
"After that one, I kind of knew, to be hon
est with you, I mean, to come back and win it
like that, maybe it is our year, and it proved to
be our year," Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess told ESPN after the title win.
With all the momentum in its favor, the
Cardinal bested Texas once again, 9-3, to
reach the final game against the Cowboys.
Stanford had never finished higher than
third in five previous trips to Omaha, and had
lost three straight to OSU over the last two
seasons, including the 6-2 loss the week be
fore, leading to some extra motivation for the
Cardinal well before the College World Se
ries.
"At the beginning of the season in January,
the team got together at my house for my 21st
birthday party, and we made a toast to a na
tional championship over Oklahoma State.

I'm not making this up," McDowell told The
Daily.
Carey, in his post-title game interview with
ESPN, said the team knew that it was finally
its year after the LSU victory.
"Yeah we felt destined, this is just an unbe
lievable feeling, we knew we could do it, we
had to do it against Texas when we played
them tonight, we knew we could do it, we just
had to go out and swing the bats the way we
could," a breathless Carey responded.
"I don't know if you know it, but you are
the most valuable player in this tournament,"
the reporter responded.
"I don't know about that, but this team,
this is the most valuable team by far," Carey
said in his heavy Boston accent. "We came
back, fought, everybody got big hits for us this
whole tournament."
The next year, the Cardinal would repeat
as College World Series champions, taking a
less dramatic route to the national title, win
ning every game in Omaha, including a 9-4
win over Arizona State in the championship
game. Perhaps the most impressive thing
about the repeat title run was that the Cardi
nal was without three of its stars from 1987
McDowell, Amaro and Esquer.
McDowell, who was picked fifth overall in
the draft by the White Sox in 1987, played in
the majors for 12 years and recorded a career
record of 127-87. The Van Nuys, Calif., native
