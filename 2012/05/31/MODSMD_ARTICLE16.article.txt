## Appel, Piscotty named to All-Pac-12 team 
### 
Stanford's top pitcher and top hitter both
made the 25-man All-Pac-12 baseball team
after strong junior seasons.
Mark Appel, the conference's leader in
strikeouts with 116, has met the extraordinar
ily high expectations he has been given for his
third and likely final year on the Farm. Picked
by many to be the top overall pick in next
month's MLB draft, Appel has stepped up to
the challenge, going 9-1 with a 2.37 ERA as
Stanford's Friday starter. He has gone at least
seven innings in 13 of his 14 starts, and he has
given up two earned runs or fewer in 12 of

those starts.
Stephen Piscotty, another projected first
round draft pick, has been one of Stanford's
best hitters throughout his time on the Farm,
and this year he has had to take on an addi
tional load.The team's starting third baseman
at the start of the year, Piscotty has shifted to
left field and pitcher, where he has excelled as
both a starter and reliever. At the plate, Pis
cotty hit .319 with 54 RBI, good for third in
the conference. On the mound, Piscotty has
won all three of his weekend starts while
compiling a 2.28 ERA.
In addition, sophomores Brian Ragira and
Austin Wilson were named as honorable

mentions for the second straight year. Ragira
has started every game at first base and hit
.318, while Wilson has manned right field
every game and smashed a team-high nine
home runs. The duo has also combined for 93
RBI.

Junior Stephen Piscotty (above) has done it all for Stanford, leading the team in RBI while playing
third base and left field, and even becoming a key member of the Cardinal's pitching staff.
