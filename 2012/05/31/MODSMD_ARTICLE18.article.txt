# Men's golf struggles in second round of NCAAs
## 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford men's golf team had a day to
forget on Wednesday, shooting an 18-over
par 302 to drop from a tie for 13th to 22nd at
the 30-team NCAA Championships. With
only one round remaining before the field is
narrowed to eight teams, the Cardinal sits 11
strokes out of eighth place.
Freshman Patrick Rodgers once again led
Stanford, shooting a one-over 72 to end the
second round four strokes off the individual
lead, currently held by Illinois sophomore
Thomas Pieters. The problem for Stanford is
that no other Cardinal golfer is ranked in the
top 90 in the 155-player field.
Stanford will have one more chance to
keep its season alive, as the final round tees
off today from the Riviera Country Club in
Pacific Palisades, Calif.
