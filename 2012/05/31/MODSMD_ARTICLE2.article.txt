"The whole start-up world is sort of
like climbing Mount Doom," said Drew
Houston, CEO and co-founder of the
file hosting service Dropbox, to a
packed NVIDIA Auditorium on
Wednesday afternoon. "You don't real
ly know how tall it is, but there is a lot of
fire and things exploding around you.
There's a lot of smoke and it is very
steep."
Houston, invited as part of the DFJ
Entrepreneurial Thoughts Leader Sem
inar, used the metaphor to explain the
problems associated with starting a
company as a recent college graduate.
"Even if you know where you are
going right now, things are going to get
gnarly down the road," he said.
Rather than discouraging potential
entrepreneurs, however, Houston
sought instead to demystify the process
of bringing a concept all the way to com
mercial actualization.
Drawing on his experience with
Dropbox, which was created on a bus
ride to New York and which currently
enjoys a market valuation of billions of

dollars, he encouraged students to leave
the beaten path.
"People imagine that life is all about
filling checkboxes," Houston said.
"They think the right path to a start-up
is getting a bunch of graduate degrees,
be a really good engineer, get an MBA,
then work at a lot of different compa
nies, and finally, sometime around their
thirties, forties or fifties, they'll be pre
pared to start a company."
Houston emphasized that successful
start-ups have rarely followed that path.
"Empirically, so many companies
that you would think about in the hall of
fame were started by people who, basi
cally, didn't know what the hell they
were doing," he said.
Houston cited several of Silicon Val
ley's most successful companies such
as Facebook, Google and Apple as
examples of firms that were started by
first- or second-time entrepreneurs
learning how to run a successful busi
ness on the fly.
"Don't be too daunted if you don't
have all the answers," he advised the au
dience.
