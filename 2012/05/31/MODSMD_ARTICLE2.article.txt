## Dropbox co-founder talks start-ups, relays experience 
### FELIX BOYEAUX CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The whole start-up world is sort of
like climbing Mount Doom," said Drew
Houston, CEO and co-founder of the
file hosting service Dropbox, to a
packed NVIDIA Auditorium on
Wednesday afternoon. "You don't real
ly know how tall it is, but there is a lot of
fire and things exploding around you.
There's a lot of smoke and it is very
steep."
Houston, invited as part of the DFJ
Entrepreneurial Thoughts Leader Sem
inar, used the metaphor to explain the
problems associated with starting a
company as a recent college graduate.
"Even if you know where you are
going right now, things are going to get
gnarly down the road," he said.
Rather than discouraging potential
entrepreneurs, however, Houston
sought instead to demystify the process
of bringing a concept all the way to com
mercial actualization.
Drawing on his experience with
Dropbox, which was created on a bus
ride to New York and which currently
enjoys a market valuation of billions of

dollars, he encouraged students to leave
the beaten path.
"People imagine that life is all about
filling checkboxes," Houston said.
"They think the right path to a start-up
is getting a bunch of graduate degrees,
be a really good engineer, get an MBA,
then work at a lot of different compa
nies, and finally, sometime around their
thirties, forties or fifties, they'll be pre
pared to start a company."
Houston emphasized that successful
start-ups have rarely followed that path.
"Empirically, so many companies
that you would think about in the hall of
fame were started by people who, basi
cally, didn't know what the hell they
were doing," he said.
Houston cited several of Silicon Val
ley's most successful companies such
as Facebook, Google and Apple as
examples of firms that were started by
first- or second-time entrepreneurs
learning how to run a successful busi
ness on the fly.
"Don't be too daunted if you don't
have all the answers," he advised the au
dience.

Drew Houston, co-founderand CEO of file hosting service Dropbox, spoke Wednesday
afternoon about his experiences developing a multi-billion dollar firm. Houston
emphasized the importance of commitment and vision above business experience.
Houston emphasized the ben
efits of an environment such as
Stanford for furthering entrepre
neurial ambitions among fellow
students with shared desire to
change the world.
"Someone once said that you
are the average of your five clos
est friends," he said. "Being in an
environment where people are
also interested in start-ups and
where you are all pushing each
other can really be helpful."
Houston originally moved to
Silicon Valley, scrapping plans to
found an SAT test preparation
company when inspired by a
friend's ability to easily access
funding from investors.
"I thought a lot about what I
wanted to do next," Houston said.
"It had to be something deeply
technical. I also wanted some
thing that I could explain to peo
ple in a bar or a coffee shop and
have them vaguely know what I
was talking about and, finally, I
wanted something with a working
business model."
In 2006, according to Houston,
cloud storage was seen as the
"next big thing" a parallel he
drew with social networks and
mobile apps today but existing
products were largely inade
quate, with at least three items of
software needed to back up, store

and share data over the Internet.
"I can't really imagine Tom
Cruise in Minority Report log
ging in to his Gmail to pick up the
attachment he sent himself that
morning, or forgetting his thumb
drive," Houston emphasized.
In fact, Houston cited the ex
perience of forgetting his thumb
drive as his prompt to start coding
Dropbox out of frustration at the
lack of progress in cloud storage.
A subsequent trip to California
secured him a co-founder, Arash
Ferdowsi, and funding from a
number of venture capital firms.
"One thing you discover very
quickly as a technical co-founder
is that you know a lot about the
engineer, but very little about the
business side of things," Houston
said.
He added, however, that such
skills are rapidly acquired with
experience and pale in signifi
cance compared to being com
pletely invested in a project.
Audience member George
Burgess 'l5, chief operating offi
cer at E2.0, expressed a favorable
view of Houston's talk.
"I pay for Dropbox and use it
daily, so it was great to learn a bit
more about what they're working
on and their priorities," Burgess
said. "Drew offered great insight
into start-up life. It was particu
larly useful to hear about some of
the mistakes he made in the early
days of Dropbox."

environment where people are
also interested in start-ups and
where you are all pushing each
other can really be helpful."
Houston originally moved to
Silicon Valley, scrapping plans to
found an SAT test preparation
company when inspired by a
friend's ability to easily access
funding from investors.
"I thought a lot about what I
wanted to do next," Houston said.
"It had to be something deeply
technical. I also wanted some
thing that I could explain to peo
ple in a bar or a coffee shop and
have them vaguely know what I
was talking about and, finally, I
wanted something with a working
business model."
In 2006, according to Houston,
cloud storage was seen as the
"next big thing" a parallel he
drew with social networks and
mobile apps today but existing
products were largely inade
quate, with at least three items of
software needed to back up, store

and share data over the Internet.
"I can't really imagine Tom
Cruise in Minority Report log
ging in to his Gmail to pick up the
attachment he sent himself that
morning, or forgetting his thumb
drive," Houston emphasized.
In fact, Houston cited the ex
perience of forgetting his thumb
drive as his prompt to start coding
Dropbox out of frustration at the
lack of progress in cloud storage.
A subsequent trip to California
secured him a co-founder, Arash
Ferdowsi, and funding from a
number of venture capital firms.
"One thing you discover very
quickly as a technical co-founder
is that you know a lot about the
engineer, but very little about the
business side of things," Houston
said.
He added, however, that such
skills are rapidly acquired with
experience and pale in signifi
cance compared to being com
pletely invested in a project.
Audience member George
Burgess 'l5, chief operating offi
cer at E2.0, expressed a favorable
view of Houston's talk.
"I pay for Dropbox and use it
daily, so it was great to learn a bit
more about what they're working
on and their priorities," Burgess
said. "Drew offered great insight
into start-up life. It was particu
larly useful to hear about some of
the mistakes he made in the early
days of Dropbox."

"The whole start-up world is sort of
like climbing Mount Doom," said Drew
Houston, CEO and co-founder of the
file hosting service Dropbox, to a
packed NVIDIA Auditorium on
Wednesday afternoon. "You don't real
ly know how tall it is, but there is a lot of
fire and things exploding around you.
There's a lot of smoke and it is very
steep."
Houston, invited as part of the DFJ
Entrepreneurial Thoughts Leader Sem
inar, used the metaphor to explain the
problems associated with starting a
company as a recent college graduate.
"Even if you know where you are
going right now, things are going to get
gnarly down the road," he said.
Rather than discouraging potential
entrepreneurs, however, Houston
sought instead to demystify the process
of bringing a concept all the way to com
mercial actualization.
Drawing on his experience with
Dropbox, which was created on a bus
ride to New York and which currently
enjoys a market valuation of billions of

dollars, he encouraged students to leave
the beaten path.
"People imagine that life is all about
filling checkboxes," Houston said.
"They think the right path to a start-up
is getting a bunch of graduate degrees,
be a really good engineer, get an MBA,
then work at a lot of different compa
nies, and finally, sometime around their
thirties, forties or fifties, they'll be pre
pared to start a company."
Houston emphasized that successful
start-ups have rarely followed that path.
"Empirically, so many companies
that you would think about in the hall of
fame were started by people who, basi
cally, didn't know what the hell they
were doing," he said.
Houston cited several of Silicon Val
ley's most successful companies such
as Facebook, Google and Apple as
examples of firms that were started by
first- or second-time entrepreneurs
learning how to run a successful busi
ness on the fly.
"Don't be too daunted if you don't
have all the answers," he advised the au
dience.

Drew Houston, co-founderand CEO of file hosting service Dropbox, spoke Wednesday
afternoon about his experiences developing a multi-billion dollar firm. Houston
emphasized the importance of commitment and vision above business experience.
Houston emphasized the ben
efits of an environment such as
Stanford for furthering entrepre
neurial ambitions among fellow
students with shared desire to
change the world.
"Someone once said that you
are the average of your five clos
