# Campus crime stable, alcohol incidents rising
## SUDPS figures show rise in DUIs and alcohol transportations OAPE calls alcohol-free programming a success 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Campus crime figures for the 2011-12 aca
demic year show little overall divergence
from previous years, according to data com
piled by the Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS). Alcohol-related
incidents, however, did increase by a signifi
cant margin.
The Stanford campus experienced a 45
percent increase in medical alcohol trans
portations this school year as compared to
last year. Between September 2011 and April
2012,77 people were transported for alcohol
related medical reasons. There were 53 trans
ports during the same time frame last year, ac
cording to SUDPS records.
Despite the uptick in transports, the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE) re
cently declared the first year of the Cardinal
Nights alcohol-free entertainment initiative
to be a success in creating community on cam
pus for non-drinkers.
Forty-eight drivers were cited for being in
possession of alcohol during this academic
year, representing more than double the 23
cited during the same time frame last year.
Twenty-four citations were issued to minors
in possession of alcohol, only one more than
issued last year.
The rate of DUIs doubled to 16 from Sep
tember 2011 to April 2012 from the eight ar
rests made during that time frame last year.

Seven people were cited for possession of
a controlled substance this year, while 10
were cited for that offense during the same
months last year.
There were eight reported sex offenses
compared with five reports last year: two bat
teries, one incident of indecent exposure, two
rapes, one sexual assault and two unverified
report. Of the five reports from the previous
year, three were for incidents of rape.
Both vehicle and dorm burglaries de
creased this year. Fourteen vehicle burglaries
and 15 dorm burglaries were reported. Last

year, 34 and 19 reports were filed
for those crimes, respectively.
Petty theft during this time pe
riod rose by nearly 68 percent,
with 357 reported incidents this
year compared with 241 reported
incidents for the same time frame
last academic year.
Reported incidents of both
structural and vehicle vandalism
were cut in half, with 13 structur
al vandalism incidents and six ve
hicle vandalism incidents this
year compared with 26 and 11 last
year, respectively.
"People have asked through
out the year if there has been an
increase in the number of Alert-
SUs [emergency notifications]

and if there has been an increase
in crime," wrote Chief of Police
Taura Wilson '9l in an email to
The Daily. "What people may not
know is that the University is re
quired to send these according to
a federal law known as the Clery
Act. We have modified some of
our practices over the past year in
order to ensure that we are com
plying with the law to the fullest
extent possible."
Wilson also noted that her de
partment has received more com
munity requests for active shoot
er and active killer response
training sessions during this aca
demic year.
"These training sessions pro
vide people with information
about options they can take during
an active shooter incident as well
as the important steps the commu
nity can take to bring concerning
behavior to the attention of skilled
professionals in an effort to pre
clude violence," Wilson wrote,
Flowever, Wilson said that by
far the most prominent SUDPS
initiative during the 2011-12 aca
demic year has been its bicycle
safety program.
While acknowledging that stu
dents may not be happy with the
increased presence of SUDPS of
ficers near stop signs to issue tick
ets for traffic offences, Wilson
noted that members of the Stan
ford community have yet to pro
pose viable alternative solutions
to the bicycle safety problem on
campus other than increased en
forcement.

"What really became obvious
is that a tremendous amount of
educating and informing stu
dents had been done but educa
tion alone wasn't changing the
culture," Wilson wrote.
"Many people are not only ex
asperated by bicyclists failing to
stop at stop signs and riding at
night without proper lighting,
they are altering their behavior in
order to avoid the possibility of
being involved in a collision with
a bicyclist," Wilson wrote.
Wilson cited anecdotal evi
dence of greater cyclist caution at
the Campus Drive-Escondido
Road stop sign and an increased
number of bikers wearing helmets
at that intersection as potential
evidence of positive impact from
the escalated enforcement.
Yesterday, in "OAPE cites gains
with Cardinal Nights," The Daily
reported that there were 64 trans
ports last year and 66 this year.
This information came from An
gelina Cardona 'll of the Office
of Alcohol Policy Education; the
statistics in today's article came
from Laura Wilson, chief of po
lice and director of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Representatives from OAPE and
SUDPS were unreachable for
comment Wednesday evening.
The Daily is currently working to
explain the discrepancy between
the statistics.

ports during the same time frame last year, ac
cording to SUDPS records.
Despite the uptick in transports, the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE) re
cently declared the first year of the Cardinal
Nights alcohol-free entertainment initiative
to be a success in creating community on cam
pus for non-drinkers.
Forty-eight drivers were cited for being in
possession of alcohol during this academic
year, representing more than double the 23
cited during the same time frame last year.
Twenty-four citations were issued to minors
in possession of alcohol, only one more than
issued last year.
The rate of DUIs doubled to 16 from Sep
tember 2011 to April 2012 from the eight ar
rests made during that time frame last year.

Seven people were cited for possession of
a controlled substance this year, while 10
were cited for that offense during the same
months last year.
There were eight reported sex offenses
compared with five reports last year: two bat
teries, one incident of indecent exposure, two
rapes, one sexual assault and two unverified
report. Of the five reports from the previous
year, three were for incidents of rape.
Both vehicle and dorm burglaries de
creased this year. Fourteen vehicle burglaries
and 15 dorm burglaries were reported. Last

year, 34 and 19 reports were filed
for those crimes, respectively.
Petty theft during this time pe
riod rose by nearly 68 percent,
with 357 reported incidents this
year compared with 241 reported
incidents for the same time frame
last academic year.
Reported incidents of both
structural and vehicle vandalism
were cut in half, with 13 structur
al vandalism incidents and six ve
hicle vandalism incidents this
year compared with 26 and 11 last
year, respectively.
"People have asked through
out the year if there has been an
increase in the number of Alert-
SUs [emergency notifications]

and if there has been an increase
in crime," wrote Chief of Police
Taura Wilson '9l in an email to
The Daily. "What people may not
know is that the University is re
quired to send these according to
a federal law known as the Clery
Act. We have modified some of
our practices over the past year in
order to ensure that we are com
plying with the law to the fullest
extent possible."
Wilson also noted that her de
partment has received more com
munity requests for active shoot
er and active killer response
training sessions during this aca
demic year.
"These training sessions pro
vide people with information
about options they can take during
an active shooter incident as well
as the important steps the commu
nity can take to bring concerning
behavior to the attention of skilled
professionals in an effort to pre
clude violence," Wilson wrote,
Flowever, Wilson said that by
far the most prominent SUDPS
initiative during the 2011-12 aca
demic year has been its bicycle
safety program.
While acknowledging that stu
dents may not be happy with the
increased presence of SUDPS of
ficers near stop signs to issue tick
ets for traffic offences, Wilson
noted that members of the Stan
ford community have yet to pro
pose viable alternative solutions
to the bicycle safety problem on
campus other than increased en
forcement.

"What really became obvious
is that a tremendous amount of
educating and informing stu
dents had been done but educa
tion alone wasn't changing the
culture," Wilson wrote.
"Many people are not only ex
asperated by bicyclists failing to
stop at stop signs and riding at
night without proper lighting,
they are altering their behavior in
order to avoid the possibility of
being involved in a collision with
a bicyclist," Wilson wrote.
Wilson cited anecdotal evi
dence of greater cyclist caution at
the Campus Drive-Escondido
Road stop sign and an increased
number of bikers wearing helmets
at that intersection as potential
evidence of positive impact from
the escalated enforcement.
Yesterday, in "OAPE cites gains
with Cardinal Nights," The Daily
reported that there were 64 trans
ports last year and 66 this year.
This information came from An
gelina Cardona 'll of the Office
of Alcohol Policy Education; the
statistics in today's article came
from Laura Wilson, chief of po
lice and director of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety.
Representatives from OAPE and
SUDPS were unreachable for
comment Wednesday evening.
The Daily is currently working to
explain the discrepancy between
the statistics.

Campus crime figures for the 2011-12 aca
demic year show little overall divergence
from previous years, according to data com
piled by the Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS). Alcohol-related
incidents, however, did increase by a signifi
cant margin.
The Stanford campus experienced a 45
percent increase in medical alcohol trans
portations this school year as compared to
last year. Between September 2011 and April
2012,77 people were transported for alcohol
related medical reasons. There were 53 trans
ports during the same time frame last year, ac
cording to SUDPS records.
