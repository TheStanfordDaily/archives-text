# Campus crime stable, alcohol incidents rising
## SUDPS figures show rise in DUIs and alcohol transportations OAPE calls alcohol-free programming a success 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Campus crime figures for the 2011-12 aca
demic year show little overall divergence
from previous years, according to data com
piled by the Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS). Alcohol-related
incidents, however, did increase by a signifi
cant margin.
The Stanford campus experienced a 45
percent increase in medical alcohol trans
portations this school year as compared to
last year. Between September 2011 and April
2012,77 people were transported for alcohol
related medical reasons. There were 53 trans
ports during the same time frame last year, ac
cording to SUDPS records.
Despite the uptick in transports, the Office
of Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE) re
cently declared the first year of the Cardinal
Nights alcohol-free entertainment initiative
to be a success in creating community on cam
pus for non-drinkers.
Forty-eight drivers were cited for being in
possession of alcohol during this academic
year, representing more than double the 23
cited during the same time frame last year.
Twenty-four citations were issued to minors
in possession of alcohol, only one more than
issued last year.
The rate of DUIs doubled to 16 from Sep
tember 2011 to April 2012 from the eight ar
rests made during that time frame last year.

Seven people were cited for possession of
a controlled substance this year, while 10
were cited for that offense during the same
months last year.
There were eight reported sex offenses
compared with five reports last year: two bat
teries, one incident of indecent exposure, two
rapes, one sexual assault and two unverified
report. Of the five reports from the previous
year, three were for incidents of rape.
Both vehicle and dorm burglaries de
creased this year. Fourteen vehicle burglaries
and 15 dorm burglaries were reported. Last
