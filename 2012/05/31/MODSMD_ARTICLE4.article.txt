## Senior Gift awaits late spike 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
With two weeks left before graduation, the
Class of 2012 remains slightly behind last
year's record participation in Senior Gift do
nations. Gift organizers expressed optimism,
however, that seniors' contribution to the stu
dent-driven initiative will spike in the final
weeks.
"The goal is to break the 2011 participa
tion record and, since people tend to be very
last minute about everything, we do expect to
see a lot of people give in the next few weeks,"
wrote Felicity Meu, director of student and
young alumni development, in an email to
The Daily.
The Class of 2011 set an all-time participa

tion record with its Senior Gift, recording just
over 82 percent of seniors donating to an ini
tiative intended largely through The Stan
ford Fund —to support financial aid and
other undergraduate programs.
"This renewable, discretionary fund en
ables the president to respond to immediate
needs, unexpected opportunities and fresh
ideas," Meu wrote. "[Senior Gift donations]
are an essential complement to endowment
gifts. Every undergraduate at Stanford is
touched by the Fund in some way and the
Senior Gift is away to say 'thank you' and give
back."
As of May 29, more than half of the Class
of 2012 had contributed to this year's Senior
Gift. A month before graduation
last year, participation figures for
the Class of 2011 approached 60
percent.
"We do not want 2011 to be an
outlier we want their gift to be
the start of a trend," Meu wrote.
Meu noted that Senior Gift
committee members have organ
ized a number of events to in
crease turnout and senior partici
pation, including house and dorm
visits and in-person outreach as
the fundraising enters its final pe
riod.
"We know students love Stan
ford and we know many of them
believe it is important to support
the University," Meu wrote. "The
committee is working hard to
bring down any possible barriers

to giving."
"There's some social pressure
around it," said Kara Murray 'l2,
who recently donated. "Every
one gives so you sort of have to
give. Some people may not even
find out what it's used for until
later."
With matching donations, the
Class of 2011 exceeded $200,000
in its fundraising total. The Class
of 2012's donations will be
matched 2:1 by Peter Bing '55,
with the Parent Advisory Board
contributing a further $5,000 for
every 10 percent increase in par
ticipation among seniors.
Meu predicted that the vast
majority of Senior Gift dona
tions will be allocated to The
Stanford Fund's need-based fi
nancial aid program, which has
in recent years grown from ap
proximately half of the Fund's
expenditure to 81 percent in
2010-11 as a result of financial
aid policy changes and an inhos

pitable economic climate.
"As a direct result of the eco
nomic recession, this is likely to
continue for several years, with
student need surpassing the pay
out from endowed scholarship
funds," Meu wrote.
The Senior Gift has seen a
gradual rise in class participation
over the past decade. However,
peer institutions such as Harvard,
Princeton and Dartmouth have
consistently recorded even higher
levels of turnout. Meu acknowl
edged that work remains to be
done to ensure a consistently
comparable turnout from Stan
ford seniors.
"Our students chose Stanford
for the caliber of education but
also for the Stanford ethos," Meu
wrote. "I only hope that, moving
forward, that includes philanthro
py and gratitude."
