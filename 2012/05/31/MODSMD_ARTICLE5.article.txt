## Aspirin shows promise in treating skin cancer 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Aspirin and other non
steroidal, anti-inflammatory
painkillers may help protect
against skin cancer, according to
scientists at the School of Medi
cine, Aarhus University Hospital
and the Cancer Prevention Insti
tute in Fremont.
Researchers examined the
drugs' impact by evaluating 19
years of skin cancer records in
northern Denmark and comparing
the rates at which skin cancer ma
terialized in subjects who took one
or more drugs compared to those
who didn't.
Researchers subsequently
found that the risk of developing
squamous cell carcinoma or malig
nant melanoma two forms of
skin cancer fell by 15 and 13
percent respectively among peo
ple who had used aspirin-like
drugs. The lowered risk was more
pronounced among those who had
used the drugs for a longer period
or more intensively.
Aspirin and other non
steroidal, anti-inflammatory
painkillers may protect against
skin cancer by inhibiting the func
tion of two enzymes responsible
for the promotion of inflamma
tion and the formation of blood
vessels. Without such outlets for
expansion, tumors may be unable
to grow, according to researchers.
