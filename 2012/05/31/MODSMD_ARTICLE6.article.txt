Charged Particles, a jazz group featuring Communication Professor Jon Krosnick and Murray Low, director of the Afro-Latin Jazz program at Stanford, performed on campus
for the first time in the band's 20-year history on Wednesday evening. The band's work was recently described by This Week as 'a superb example of musical artistry.'
