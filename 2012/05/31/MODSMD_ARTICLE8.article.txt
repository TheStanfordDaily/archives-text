# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## Facing Michelangelo 
### â€” Ann Tyler Moses 
I stared for a long time at
Michelangelo's "Pieta"
before noticing that Jesus
was missing a leg. The
statue retains such a
grace, such a feeling of perfec
tion that it left me unconcerned
with such trivialities as the ab
sence of a limb. But the work is
decidedly unfinished the
figures grow out of rough, un
hewn stone and dark cracks run
along Jesus' shoulder where
Michelangelo attempted to
shatter it in anger.
This is not the famed "Pieta"
ensconced in St. Peter's Basili
ca, but a later work, begun when
Michelangelo was nearly 80. It
is now tucked in an alcove of
the Opera del Duomo museum
in Florence. The piece depicts
Nicodemus sculpted as a
self-portrait of Michelangelo
lowering the body of Jesus
into the arms of his mother
Mary and Mary Magdalene.
The artist took on this work not
on commission, but purely for
himself as he prepared for his
impending death.The piece was
intended to adorn his tomb.
Michelangelo was regarded
like a god even during his life
time. His style was praised as
theologically correct and an en
lire movement. Mannerism,
was built to emulate it. In his
youth, Michelangelo's talent
had been his intuition for the
sculpture that a block of marble
wanted to be: he could sense the
shape that it contained, and be
lieved it his task to bring that
shape out of the single block. In
this "Pieta" he failed adding

the leg would have thrown off
the balance, introduced a dan
gerously racy limb entangle
ment between Christ and
Madonna, and required addi
tional marble. According to his
contemporary biographer,
Giorgio Vasari, he had been
working on the sculpture by the
light of a single candle, which
must reasonably have con
tributed to the problem.
He was in the throes of an
end-of-life crisis, plagued by an
uncertainty with art itself and
his life's devotion to it. His
world was unsteady as well, still
reeling from the publication of
Martin Luther's 95 Theses some
30 years earlier. Doubt and dis
cord had shaken the founda
tions of the machine that had
made the very Renaissance.
Michelangelo's other works
are nearly reason enough to
study in Italy; I got a crick in my
neck from my inability to stop
staring at the Sistine Chapel
ceiling, and I am still awed by
the simplicity and perfection of
the "David." But this particular
work has stuck in my mind, and
the image of Michelangelo's
face looking upon death is one I
am not soon to forget. I cannot
stop thinking of the deepness of
its expression and the poignan
cy of the imperfect sculpture
that holds it, the human strug
gle that it depicts and that it
contained. Once I found it diffi
cult to imagine Michelangelo as
a human, but now I am begin
ning to understand.
