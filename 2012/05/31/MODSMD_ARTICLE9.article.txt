## PARENTS' CLUB More than a birthday gift delivery service 
### RAYMOND LUONG 
We know them as
the organization
of nice people
who hand-deliv
er flowers and
delicious cakes to homesick stu
dents craving some long-distance
family affection on birthdays and
special occasions. But the Parents'
Club is more than just a birthday
gift-delivery service it boasts a
long tradition of bringing Stan
ford parents together.
In 1924, a group of faculty
wives, Stanford alumnae and
mothers founded the Parents'
Club, originally called the Moth
ers' Club. They established the
three-fold mission that exists to
this day "to bring together its
members in social and intellectual
exchange, to keep in close touch
with the University life and, in all
practicable ways, aid the Universi
ty authorities in promoting the
welfare of the student body."
The Mothers' Club established
a speaker series and scholarship
program, both of which still exist
today. The Club also built a series
of Rest Homes to nurse sick stu
dents who did not require hospi
talization. These Rest Homes
were given to the University once
the Cowell Student Health Cen
ter now Vaden Health Center
was completed in 1962.
In 1997 the Mothers' Club
changed its name to the Parents'
Club to include all parents in the
organization. There are now
around 1,000 international and
300 local members.
The Parents' Club is active
throughout the year, but especial
ly active during New Student Ori
entation, Parents' Weekend and
Admit Weekend. Members of the
Parents' Club volunteer to coor
dinate speakers, facilitate check
in services, organize campus tours
and sell merchandise to raise

money for the scholarship fund. In
addition, during Parents' Week
end, the Parents' Club holds the
Entertainment Extravaganza,
which showcases student artistic
talent.
One of the more popular and
well-known services is the deliv
ery service through which par
ents can send their children
cakes, cookies, brownies, flowers,
balloons and plants. Cakes and
balloons are popular for birth
days, but the recently added
service of cookies and brownies
have become quite popular, es
pecially around exam time. Pres
ident-Elect Marcia Hansen
noted that deliveries overall
tend to peak around Valentine's
Day and finals.
"Students really appreciate
the deliveries," said Vice Presi
dent of Fundraising Maria Cara
no. "It's not embarrassing for
them at all. We are like an exten
sion of their family, not just deliv
ery people."
"Our services allow parents
who are not local to bring joy to
their children," added President
Sheree Williams.
Katherine Scavo 'l5 received a
surprise from the Parents' Club
for her 19th birthday. Scavo's
mother ordered a cake and bal
loons online and had them deliv
ered to her daughter's room on
her birthday.
"I was happy that my parents
were able to celebrate my birthday
with me from far away," Scavo said.
"It was a nice surprise because I
wasn't expecting anything."
One aspect Scavo appreciated
about the Parents' Club is that the
parents aren't just strangers who
drop off a cake. They add a person
al touch to all of their deliveries.
"The parent who delivered the
cake and balloons was really
friendly and nice, which made the
experience more personable,"
Scavo said. "She was like my mom

away from home. She was just as
excited as my mom would be."
According to the Parents' Club
website, the volunteers of the or
ganization make over 1,000 deliv
eries each academic year.
The money made from the
Parents' Club delivery service, as
well as the money raised through
the active fundraising efforts of
the members is used to support an
endowed scholarship program. In
the past 80 years, the Parents'
Club has granted over $1 million
in scholarship funds to under
graduates at Stanford.
A notable change in the past
few years is that the Parents' Club
has become increasingly tech
savvy. The Club has improved its
Facebook image and updated its
website. One huge achievement
was the creation of an automated
online ordering and purchasing
system.
In addition to its gift delivery
services, the Parents' Club offers a
mechanism for parents to meet
other parents and develop friend
ships. Parents can find others who
are in similar situations and en
gage in meaningful conversations.
"I like the people a lot,"
Hansen said. "It's an incredibly
fun and smart group that centers
on friendship and camaraderie."
"The Parents' Club is a very
social club with monthly meetings
and seasonal lunches," Carano
said.
President Williams noted that
through online communication,
parents who are in town for just a
weekend are able to find a warm
and welcoming community of
other parents.
"The Parents' Club exists and
is able to survive because of the
generosity of the volunteers and
their love of Stanford," Williams
added.

The Parents' Club is active
throughout the year, but especial
ly active during New Student Ori
entation, Parents' Weekend and
Admit Weekend. Members of the
Parents' Club volunteer to coor
dinate speakers, facilitate check
in services, organize campus tours
and sell merchandise to raise

money for the scholarship fund. In
addition, during Parents' Week
end, the Parents' Club holds the
Entertainment Extravaganza,
which showcases student artistic
talent.
One of the more popular and
well-known services is the deliv
ery service through which par
ents can send their children
cakes, cookies, brownies, flowers,
balloons and plants. Cakes and
balloons are popular for birth
days, but the recently added
service of cookies and brownies
have become quite popular, es
pecially around exam time. Pres
ident-Elect Marcia Hansen
noted that deliveries overall
tend to peak around Valentine's
Day and finals.
"Students really appreciate
the deliveries," said Vice Presi
dent of Fundraising Maria Cara
no. "It's not embarrassing for
them at all. We are like an exten
sion of their family, not just deliv
ery people."
"Our services allow parents
who are not local to bring joy to
their children," added President
Sheree Williams.
Katherine Scavo 'l5 received a
surprise from the Parents' Club
for her 19th birthday. Scavo's
mother ordered a cake and bal
loons online and had them deliv
ered to her daughter's room on
her birthday.
"I was happy that my parents
were able to celebrate my birthday
with me from far away," Scavo said.
"It was a nice surprise because I
wasn't expecting anything."
One aspect Scavo appreciated
about the Parents' Club is that the
parents aren't just strangers who
drop off a cake. They add a person
al touch to all of their deliveries.
"The parent who delivered the
cake and balloons was really
friendly and nice, which made the
experience more personable,"
Scavo said. "She was like my mom

away from home. She was just as
excited as my mom would be."
According to the Parents' Club
website, the volunteers of the or
ganization make over 1,000 deliv
eries each academic year.
The money made from the
Parents' Club delivery service, as
well as the money raised through
the active fundraising efforts of
the members is used to support an
endowed scholarship program. In
the past 80 years, the Parents'
Club has granted over $1 million
in scholarship funds to under
graduates at Stanford.
A notable change in the past
few years is that the Parents' Club
has become increasingly tech
savvy. The Club has improved its
Facebook image and updated its
website. One huge achievement
was the creation of an automated
online ordering and purchasing
system.
In addition to its gift delivery
services, the Parents' Club offers a
mechanism for parents to meet
other parents and develop friend
ships. Parents can find others who
are in similar situations and en
gage in meaningful conversations.
"I like the people a lot,"
Hansen said. "It's an incredibly
fun and smart group that centers
on friendship and camaraderie."
"The Parents' Club is a very
social club with monthly meetings
and seasonal lunches," Carano
said.
President Williams noted that
through online communication,
parents who are in town for just a
weekend are able to find a warm
and welcoming community of
other parents.
"The Parents' Club exists and
is able to survive because of the
generosity of the volunteers and
their love of Stanford," Williams
added.

We know them as
the organization
of nice people
who hand-deliv
er flowers and
delicious cakes to homesick stu
dents craving some long-distance
family affection on birthdays and
special occasions. But the Parents'
Club is more than just a birthday
gift-delivery service it boasts a
long tradition of bringing Stan
ford parents together.
In 1924, a group of faculty
wives, Stanford alumnae and
mothers founded the Parents'
Club, originally called the Moth
ers' Club. They established the
three-fold mission that exists to
this day "to bring together its
members in social and intellectual
exchange, to keep in close touch
with the University life and, in all
practicable ways, aid the Universi
ty authorities in promoting the
welfare of the student body."
The Mothers' Club established
a speaker series and scholarship
program, both of which still exist
today. The Club also built a series
of Rest Homes to nurse sick stu
dents who did not require hospi
talization. These Rest Homes
were given to the University once
the Cowell Student Health Cen
ter now Vaden Health Center
was completed in 1962.
In 1997 the Mothers' Club
changed its name to the Parents'
Club to include all parents in the
organization. There are now
around 1,000 international and
300 local members.
The Parents' Club is active
