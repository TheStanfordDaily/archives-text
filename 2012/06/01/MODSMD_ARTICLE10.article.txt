## EDITORIAL Choice for Three"Books" disappointing 
### 
As announced recently, the
Three Books Discussion
for incoming freshmen
will feature Chuck Klosterman's
memoir "Fargo Rock City: A
Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural
North Dakota," the DVD docu
mentary "My Kid Could Paint
That," and the suite of "Smule"
smartphone applications. Associ
ate professor of music Mark Ap
plebaum, who selected the works,
said these "texts" are intended to
motivate students "to ask broader
questions about where art is
made, what art is important and
who should decide." While we at
the Editorial Board believe that
encouraging students to think crit
ically about art is a fine goal, we
are disappointed with the selec
tion of a smartphone application
suite: not only does it alienate a
significant fraction of the incom
ing freshmen, it strays too far from
the purpose of the Three Books
program.

Most of all, owning a smart
phone should not be a prerequi
site to participate in the Three
"Books" program. Even if Under
graduate Advising and Research
(UAR) works out the logistics of
creating a website that hosts the
apps over the summer, five of the
seven apps make prominent use
of a touchscreen, a feature on only
a few laptops and personal com
puters. Anyone relying on this
website will therefore have an in
ferior experience. Even though
UAR promises to make smart
phone devices available for check
out during NSO, the organizers
have nevertheless implicitly creat
ed a classist norm for incoming
students that of owning a
smartphone. This is a troubling
standard, as there is a sizeable por
tion of incoming students that will
not own such a device for finan
cial, personal or other reasons.
These students will be made to in
stantly feel different (and likely in
ferior) for not owning what
amounts to a luxury device that
few Stanford students truly need.
Despite UAR's best intentions,
the message this selection sends
will inevitably lead to feelings of
exclusion during a time when the
administration should be focused
on smoothing the college transi
tion for students from all socioe
conomic classes.
In short, we hope that Apple -
baum and UAR will make the
smartphone application suite an
optional fourth "text" and in its
place send students a text
which need not be literary that
offers more opportunity for intel
lectual engagement. This is the
Class of 2016's first exposure to
Stanford intellectual life, and the
Three Books organizers should do
everything in their power to make
sure this opportunity is not wast
ed. In addition, this replacement
text should be something that all
incoming students can fully appre
ciate. One of the points of pride of
the Three Books program is pro
viding the texts free of charge so
that students from all financial
backgrounds can equally partici
pate. Including the smartphone
application suite breaks from this
ideal, and we hope UAR does
everything in its power to prompt
ly remedy the situation and send a
more inclusive message to incom
ing students.

Three Books is designed to in
troduce students to the intellectu
al atmosphere found at Stanford.
Yet we wonder if the inclusion of
an app suite will prompt this de
sired effect. This is not to say that
tactile learning is not useful under
any circumstances. Rather, we
have trouble pinpointing the in
tellectual potential of a set of apps
that lets you autotune your voice
or play an Ocarina. Even if the
smartphone apps do showcase an
intellectual component, will in
coming students draw the appro
priate conclusions? With three
physical books, readers have con
siderably more time and space to
reflect on various themes, draw
ing broader conclusions that link
the texts. With one book, one
movie, and one application suite,
we doubt that the intertext con
nections will be as deep, particu
larly given that students are un
likely to spend more than 20 min
utes with the apps and that the
app suite will not be distributed
until the chaos of New Student
Orientation (NSO). At most,
then, we believe the application
suite should have been included
as a fourth selection, perhaps as a
supplement to a text drawn from
the literature on "prosumers," de
fined as average consumers who
also produce high-quality art,
often through the use of digital
software.

stantly feel different (and likely in
ferior) for not owning what
amounts to a luxury device that
few Stanford students truly need.
Despite UAR's best intentions,
the message this selection sends
will inevitably lead to feelings of
exclusion during a time when the
administration should be focused
on smoothing the college transi
tion for students from all socioe
conomic classes.
In short, we hope that Apple -
baum and UAR will make the
smartphone application suite an
optional fourth "text" and in its
place send students a text
which need not be literary that
offers more opportunity for intel
lectual engagement. This is the
Class of 2016's first exposure to
Stanford intellectual life, and the
Three Books organizers should do
everything in their power to make
sure this opportunity is not wast
ed. In addition, this replacement
text should be something that all
incoming students can fully appre
ciate. One of the points of pride of
the Three Books program is pro
viding the texts free of charge so
that students from all financial
backgrounds can equally partici
pate. Including the smartphone
application suite breaks from this
ideal, and we hope UAR does
everything in its power to prompt
ly remedy the situation and send a
more inclusive message to incom
ing students.

Three Books is designed to in
troduce students to the intellectu
al atmosphere found at Stanford.
Yet we wonder if the inclusion of
an app suite will prompt this de
sired effect. This is not to say that
tactile learning is not useful under
any circumstances. Rather, we
have trouble pinpointing the in
tellectual potential of a set of apps
that lets you autotune your voice
or play an Ocarina. Even if the
smartphone apps do showcase an
intellectual component, will in
coming students draw the appro
priate conclusions? With three
physical books, readers have con
siderably more time and space to
reflect on various themes, draw
ing broader conclusions that link
the texts. With one book, one
movie, and one application suite,
we doubt that the intertext con
nections will be as deep, particu
larly given that students are un
likely to spend more than 20 min
utes with the apps and that the
app suite will not be distributed
until the chaos of New Student
Orientation (NSO). At most,
then, we believe the application
suite should have been included
as a fourth selection, perhaps as a
supplement to a text drawn from
the literature on "prosumers," de
fined as average consumers who
also produce high-quality art,
often through the use of digital
software.

As announced recently, the
Three Books Discussion
for incoming freshmen
will feature Chuck Klosterman's
memoir "Fargo Rock City: A
Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural
North Dakota," the DVD docu
mentary "My Kid Could Paint
That," and the suite of "Smule"
smartphone applications. Associ
ate professor of music Mark Ap
plebaum, who selected the works,
said these "texts" are intended to
motivate students "to ask broader
questions about where art is
made, what art is important and
who should decide." While we at
the Editorial Board believe that
encouraging students to think crit
ically about art is a fine goal, we
are disappointed with the selec
tion of a smartphone application
suite: not only does it alienate a
significant fraction of the incom
ing freshmen, it strays too far from
the purpose of the Three Books
program.

Most of all, owning a smart
phone should not be a prerequi
site to participate in the Three
"Books" program. Even if Under
graduate Advising and Research
(UAR) works out the logistics of
creating a website that hosts the
apps over the summer, five of the
seven apps make prominent use
of a touchscreen, a feature on only
a few laptops and personal com
puters. Anyone relying on this
website will therefore have an in
ferior experience. Even though
UAR promises to make smart
phone devices available for check
out during NSO, the organizers
have nevertheless implicitly creat
ed a classist norm for incoming
students that of owning a
smartphone. This is a troubling
standard, as there is a sizeable por
tion of incoming students that will
not own such a device for finan
cial, personal or other reasons.
These students will be made to in
stantly feel different (and likely in
ferior) for not owning what
amounts to a luxury device that
few Stanford students truly need.
Despite UAR's best intentions,
the message this selection sends
will inevitably lead to feelings of
