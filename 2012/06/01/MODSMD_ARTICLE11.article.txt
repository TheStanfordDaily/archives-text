# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIE
## Summer creation 
### Sebastain Gould 
I have had four summers since
coming to Stanford. The first
was spent in basic training for
the Marine Corps. The second
was spent in Ramadi, Iraq on de
ployment, where I turned 21. The
third was spent working on cam
pus at the libraries, and the
fourth was spent working for
Maps and Records at Stanford li
braries.

One thing that all the sum
mers had in common was the ne
cessity to make money to survive.

The summer I worked at the
libraries, I was down to eating
one meal a day some weeks, be
cause I could only get part-time
work, when I needed to make
enough money to save up for the
thousands of dollars needed for
the school year. I'd love to be
able to tell you the secret to mak
ing more money, but unfortu
nately I don't have one. Instead
I'm going to tell you that there
are more important things than
making money, and that your ed
ucation will be worth any suffer
ing that you undergo in seeking
it. Hopefully you can live at
home or find some chill homeless
people to hang out with to save
money.

As the financial state of your
summer is something that may
have already been decided, or is
something that you have little
control over other than trying
desperately hard and waiting on
others to respond to you, I think
you should take time to focus on
something that is more impor
tant than money: personal devel
opment. Generally little-to-no
academic learning will take place
during the summer, and so I en
courage you to use that time to
get to know yourself better.
Think about religion and read
the classics. Read the newspaper.
Try to realize the importance of
the mundane events that happen
every day. Develop a fascination
with the world around you; inves
tigate machines and structure,
the natural world. No matter
what your field of study, you can

always learn something by look
ing outside of yourself, be it an
engineering principle or a facet
of human psychology.
It is said that you don't know
something unless you can ex
plain it to others; at the same
time it is also said that you can
never fully express the real
truth. Whichever of these is true,
I encourage you to write. The
challenge of expression is an in
volved process that is a mind
shaping in itself. Creating mean
ing from nothing but a blank
page is difficult, and you can
learn about yourself in the
process. The combinations of
words that arise when an indi
vidual mind is brought to bear
on something are special be
cause they are unique. Don't
worry if what you come up with
doesn't seem interesting or in
sightful.
Stanford's Structured Liber
al Education (SLE) also taught
me the importance of surround

ing yourself with others who
share similar interests. This be
came quite acute while I was de
ployed; finding others whom
you can talk to about your inter
ests can be hard, but you will
learn a lot more with others con
stantly questioning your as
sumptions and conclusions than
you ever will by yourself. It is
one thing to read a book; you
will have a pleasant experience
or a negative one, and you may
or may not think that there is
some inherent value in what
you've read. It is another thing
to read a book with someone
else; by looking at the material
with two sets of eyes, you can
catch what someone else misses.
Human beings have a fairly
unique capacity in their ability to
create things in the world and
help shape who they are. I en
courage everyone this summer
to do just that: Take time to re
flect on what's important to you,
and then change yourself and the
world around you into the way
you want things to be.
