# EXISTENTIAL FORTUNE COOKIE
## Summer creation 
### Sebastain Gould 
I have had four summers since
coming to Stanford. The first
was spent in basic training for
the Marine Corps. The second
was spent in Ramadi, Iraq on de
ployment, where I turned 21. The
third was spent working on cam
pus at the libraries, and the
fourth was spent working for
Maps and Records at Stanford li
braries.

One thing that all the sum
mers had in common was the ne
cessity to make money to survive.

The summer I worked at the
libraries, I was down to eating
one meal a day some weeks, be
cause I could only get part-time
work, when I needed to make
enough money to save up for the
thousands of dollars needed for
the school year. I'd love to be
able to tell you the secret to mak
ing more money, but unfortu
nately I don't have one. Instead
I'm going to tell you that there
are more important things than
making money, and that your ed
ucation will be worth any suffer
ing that you undergo in seeking
it. Hopefully you can live at
home or find some chill homeless
people to hang out with to save
money.

As the financial state of your
summer is something that may
have already been decided, or is
something that you have little
control over other than trying
desperately hard and waiting on
others to respond to you, I think
you should take time to focus on
something that is more impor
tant than money: personal devel
opment. Generally little-to-no
academic learning will take place
during the summer, and so I en
courage you to use that time to
get to know yourself better.
Think about religion and read
the classics. Read the newspaper.
Try to realize the importance of
the mundane events that happen
every day. Develop a fascination
with the world around you; inves
tigate machines and structure,
the natural world. No matter
what your field of study, you can
