## Confronting the backstory 
### Miriam Marks 
By the end of spring quarter,
you can comfortably eat all
your meals outside. Who
wouldn't want to eat outside? The
sun is shining, the birds are chirping
and by dinnertime you know that
the rest of your day is doomed to be
spent crouched at a desk in front of
a computer. And so, earlier this
week I found myself at a picnic
table in a scenic little corner of
campus.
I was in the middle of telling
some fascinating anecdote, when
my dinner companion looked past
my head and gasped in excitement.
I hate being interrupted, so I was
immediately on-edge. Whatever
was causing her to lose interest in
my story had better be good. But
she was still staring past me, open
mouthed and smiling.
"What is it?" I asked, hoping the
annoyance in my voice wasn't too
obvious.
"A squirrel! Look, it's a squirrel
on the wire!"
Oh. Seriously? A squirrel? Like
the animal? On a wire, like the kind
that stretches across telephone
poles? I was totally unimpressed.
But I tried halfheartedly to be ex
cited too.
"Wow... a squirrel!" How ter
ribly exciting. The worst part was
that, by the time I turned around,
the squirrel had leapt into a tree
and was nowhere to be seen. If a
squirrel runs across a wire, and I'm
not there to see it, did it actually
happen? My brain was full of philo
sophical questions.
But my dinner companion
couldn't get enough. "Did you see
that squirrel? Crawling across the
wire? Whoa!"
I didn't see the squirrel. And I
didn't think it was a big deal that
squirrels can run across telephone
pole wires. Plus, I'd seen it happen a
million times before. I was ready to
be judgmental and mentally file
this girl away as a weirdo who
would interrupt people to stare at
squirrels running across wires.
And then it hit me maybe
this girl had never seen a squirrel
run across a wire before.
I grew up in a Midwestern sub
urb full of squirrels. In fact, there

were probably more squirrels than
people in my neighborhood, and
plenty of telephone poles and
wires. From my room, I could al
ways see a bunch of telephone
wires suspended over a street, and
so I'd pretty much grown up watch
ing squirrels prance across electric
wires.
All this is to say, I had seen a lot
of squirrels in my time before I came
to Stanford. And in an eye-opening
moment it occurred to me that, be
cause she didn't also grow up in my
hometown, she might not have
watched squirrels all her life. I had to
investigate further so several min
utes after the squirrel sighting, I
made my move.
"By the way, where are you
from?"
"Phoenix, Arizona."
Time to pop the question. "Just
wondering, are there squirrels in
Phoenix?"
She gave me the same "you are
weird" look that I had just given
her, and then she remembered the
squirrel episode and smiled.
"There aren't! I hadn't really seen a
lot of squirrels before I came to
California."
And it suddenly all made sense.
Something as small as a squirrel
running across a wire, a sight I had
completely learned to take for
granted, was apparently mind
blowing in the eyes of another per
son.
Naturally, this realization in the
context of squirrels running on
telephone poles has wider implica
tions. There are other things one
might not have the chance to see:
palm trees, mountains and vegan
Chinese food, for those of us from
the Chicago area. Other people
may have grown up without seeing
poverty, or wealth or inequality.
If we're not careful, we'll tend to
assume that other people have
seen the same things that we have,
that they must think the same
thoughts as we do. And when our
assumption is proven wrong, we'll
judge them.
Maybe you decided that your
friend with a huge house was
"rich," but then you learned about
real estate values in their area.

Maybe you laughed at your
friend's views regarding relation
ships and marriage before you
learned about their cultural tradi
tions. Maybe you belittled your
friend's political opinions before
exploring their context the
household they grew up in, the in
formation they could access, etc.
In all the situations above, the
key to less judgment lies in learning
more. You find out where some
one's from, what their background
is like and through asking ques
tions and hearing stories, you come
to understand the reasons for your
differences.
Coming to college has meant
that we meet people from very dif
ferent backgrounds. The only thing
we need is open minds a willing
ness to gather more information
from other people. Sure, it can be
time-consuming and even exhaust
ing, but if you take pleasure in new
stories, you'll always be rewarded.
And eventually, once you've heard
everyone's story, you may no
longer need to pass any judgments.

ment at melloram@stanford.edu.

By the end of spring quarter,
you can comfortably eat all
your meals outside. Who
wouldn't want to eat outside? The
sun is shining, the birds are chirping
and by dinnertime you know that
the rest of your day is doomed to be
spent crouched at a desk in front of
a computer. And so, earlier this
week I found myself at a picnic
table in a scenic little corner of
campus.
I was in the middle of telling
some fascinating anecdote, when
my dinner companion looked past
my head and gasped in excitement.
I hate being interrupted, so I was
immediately on-edge. Whatever
was causing her to lose interest in
my story had better be good. But
she was still staring past me, open
mouthed and smiling.
"What is it?" I asked, hoping the
annoyance in my voice wasn't too
obvious.
"A squirrel! Look, it's a squirrel
on the wire!"
Oh. Seriously? A squirrel? Like
the animal? On a wire, like the kind
that stretches across telephone
poles? I was totally unimpressed.
But I tried halfheartedly to be ex
cited too.
"Wow... a squirrel!" How ter
ribly exciting. The worst part was
that, by the time I turned around,
the squirrel had leapt into a tree
and was nowhere to be seen. If a
squirrel runs across a wire, and I'm
not there to see it, did it actually
happen? My brain was full of philo
sophical questions.
But my dinner companion
couldn't get enough. "Did you see
that squirrel? Crawling across the
wire? Whoa!"
I didn't see the squirrel. And I
didn't think it was a big deal that
squirrels can run across telephone
pole wires. Plus, I'd seen it happen a
million times before. I was ready to
be judgmental and mentally file
this girl away as a weirdo who
would interrupt people to stare at
squirrels running across wires.
And then it hit me maybe
this girl had never seen a squirrel
run across a wire before.
I grew up in a Midwestern sub
urb full of squirrels. In fact, there

were probably more squirrels than
people in my neighborhood, and
plenty of telephone poles and
wires. From my room, I could al
ways see a bunch of telephone
wires suspended over a street, and
so I'd pretty much grown up watch
ing squirrels prance across electric
wires.
All this is to say, I had seen a lot
of squirrels in my time before I came
to Stanford. And in an eye-opening
moment it occurred to me that, be
cause she didn't also grow up in my
hometown, she might not have
watched squirrels all her life. I had to
investigate further so several min
utes after the squirrel sighting, I
made my move.
"By the way, where are you
from?"
"Phoenix, Arizona."
Time to pop the question. "Just
wondering, are there squirrels in
Phoenix?"
She gave me the same "you are
weird" look that I had just given
her, and then she remembered the
squirrel episode and smiled.
"There aren't! I hadn't really seen a
lot of squirrels before I came to
California."
And it suddenly all made sense.
Something as small as a squirrel
running across a wire, a sight I had
completely learned to take for
granted, was apparently mind
blowing in the eyes of another per
son.
Naturally, this realization in the
context of squirrels running on
telephone poles has wider implica
tions. There are other things one
might not have the chance to see:
palm trees, mountains and vegan
Chinese food, for those of us from
the Chicago area. Other people
may have grown up without seeing
poverty, or wealth or inequality.
If we're not careful, we'll tend to
assume that other people have
seen the same things that we have,
that they must think the same
thoughts as we do. And when our
assumption is proven wrong, we'll
judge them.
Maybe you decided that your
friend with a huge house was
"rich," but then you learned about
real estate values in their area.

Maybe you laughed at your
friend's views regarding relation
ships and marriage before you
learned about their cultural tradi
tions. Maybe you belittled your
friend's political opinions before
exploring their context the
household they grew up in, the in
formation they could access, etc.
In all the situations above, the
key to less judgment lies in learning
more. You find out where some
one's from, what their background
is like and through asking ques
tions and hearing stories, you come
to understand the reasons for your
differences.
Coming to college has meant
that we meet people from very dif
ferent backgrounds. The only thing
we need is open minds a willing
ness to gather more information
from other people. Sure, it can be
time-consuming and even exhaust
ing, but if you take pleasure in new
stories, you'll always be rewarded.
And eventually, once you've heard
everyone's story, you may no
longer need to pass any judgments.
