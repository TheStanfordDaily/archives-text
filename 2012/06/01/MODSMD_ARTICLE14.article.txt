# INSIDE THE DAILY
## Billy Gallagher takes the lede 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
After a long, hard-fought cam
paign, Billy Gallagher 'l4 was
elected as editor in chief of Vol. 242
of The Daily on Thursday night.
Gallagher's campaign platform
was largely based on The Daily re
turning to antebellum labor prac
tices, eliminating the opinions sec
tion and adding a puppy as manag
ing editor of features. He began his
career as a lowly freshman fellow,
but quickly climbed the ranks,
often charming staff members with
his eloquent, politically correct
commentary and philosophical in
sights.
The man, the myth, the legend
A native of Bryn Mawr, Penn.,
Gallagher's patriotic upbringing
surrounded by hockey-crazed rel
atives has thoroughly prepared
him for his new role. Gallagher
brings an innocent, youthful ener
gy and a three-piece seersucker
suit to his new post.
The current co-managing edi
tor of news claims he was inspired
in his quest for power by former
President Reagan and the dapper
male leads of "Mad Men." While
he began his campaign mistakenly
believing he was running for
Kappa Sigma president, Gallagher
was pleasantly surprised when he
learned he would actually be in
charge of The Daily. Those present
for the announcement of the elec
tion results agreed that the eager
young gun has come a long way
since his time spent being stuffed
into lockers in middle school.
Fratstar
Managing Editor of Sports and
specimen of human achievement
Jack Blanchat 'l2 was so thrilled
with the election results that he

had a frat-gasm on the spot. Con
sidered by many to be the Bash to
Gallagher's Franklin, Blanchat
was understandably excited to see
his fellow fratstar at the helm of
The Daily.
"I know he's the right man to
lead us all into this postmodern
era," Blanchat said. "I just wish
he'd stop being so gender norma
tive."
Blanchat then proceeded to
celebrate by donning a red thong
and dougie-ing the night away as
his stripper alter-ego, Chadd
Steele.
No one was happier with the re
sults than Deputy Editor Brendan
O'Byrne 'l4, who promptly vomit
ed from excitement. In the throes
of his celebratory fit, O'Byrne fi
nally admitted his long-standing
affair with Gallagher, which came
as a surprise to no one.
But not all Daily staffers were
so ecstatic. When asked about her
failed write-in campaign, Opinions
Editor Amanda Ach 'l2 respond
ed that she was disappointed with
Billy as a candidate.
"He's not adorable, Jewish or
famous. Ummm, hello?" she said,
before storming out of the office.
Gallagher's co-managing edi
tor of news, Kurt Chirbas 'l4 came
audibly flip-flopping into the office
as Ach left and offered some ad
vice to the new leader, suggesting
that he spend his summer consult
ing the classics.
Managing Editor of Features
Marwa Farag 'l4 couldn't have
cared less about the results but was
insistent that she is not familiar
with caulk before she sped off in
her golf cart.
Staffers Nate Adams, Anna
Schuessler, Sam Svoboda and
Molly Vorwerck could not be
reached for comment and were

too busy to vote in the election.
Sports Desk Editor and former
Deputy Jake Jaffe 'l2 was charac
teristically drunk when the results
were released, but through slurred
words expressed his undying ap
proval of Gallagher's victory.
"I love porn!" he yelled, to no
one in particular.
Thanking the minions
In his victory speech, Gallagher
attributed his success to his former
mentor, Vol. 239 Editor in Chief
Zach Zimmerman 'l2, and Copy
Editor and College Championship
Jeopardy semi-finalist Matt Olson
'l4. Olson played a key role in Gal
lagher's campaign as his cult fol
lowing was critical in getting Gal
lagher the votes he needed for vic
tory. When asked for comment,
Olson muttered, "Fucking derby,"
and then starting reciting from
"Hamlet."
Departing EIC Margaret Raw
son 'l2 was excited about Gal
lagher's victory.
"I'm so glad to be done with this
organization," Rawson exclaimed,
temporarily forgetting from fa
tigue that she'll be indentured for
another year.
However, Gallagher's victory
was not without scandal. He will be
receiving a lower salary than for
mer EICs, as he still owes The
Daily a significant sum in fines for
damaging office property during
V 01.241.
"I don't even work here," Gal
lagher said when asked to com
ment on the fines and his election.
Still, Gallagher will serve as the
fresh face of The Daily moving for
ward, and most staffers couldn't be
happier. After all, as O'Byrne re
marked, "Having someone stick a
finger up your butthole can't be
that unpleasant."

In a fluke moment of maturity miraculously captured by The Daily lens,
Billy Gallagher '14 looked uncharacteristically composed following the
announcement that he will soon join the legacy of Daily editors in chief.
