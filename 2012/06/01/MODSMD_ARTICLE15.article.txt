## THE 						ROAD BEGINS HERE CARD KICKS OFF REGIONAL AGAINST FRESNO STATE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Don't sleep on Fresno State.
That's a lesson that the college baseball
world learned the hard way in 2008, when the
unheralded, 33-27 Bulldogs took their con
ference tournament by storm and never
stopped winning, staving off elimination six
times en route to the program's first NCAA
championship in a men's sport.
The Bulldogs (30-26,8-10 Western Athlet
ic Conference) will again play underdog this
year as the No. 4 seed in their regional, and it
will be top-seeded Stanford's job to quell an
other Cinderella run when the two teams
meet on the Farm tonight in the first home re
gional for the Cardinal (38-16,18-12 Pac-12)
in four years.
Also in town are No. 2 Pepperdine (34-21,

16-8 West Coast Conference) and No. 3
Michigan State (37-21,13-11 Big Ten), which
will meet at Sunken Diamond this afternoon
before Stanford and Fresno State face off at 6
p.m.
The 13th-ranked Cardinal may be the
odds-on favorite to win its regional, but it will
still be on upset alert all weekend long.
"There's so much more parity than there
ever used to be, and I think that's real healthy
for our game," said head coach Mark Mar
quess, who is coaching in a home regional for
the 15th time in 36 seasons. "It shows when
you don't have Texas making the field of 64.
"At this stage, if you make a couple of mis
takes at the wrong time or don't win a couple
of big spots as a pitcher, you get beat," he said.
"It's that equal. As I tell the players, a lot of
times it's not the best team that wins it's
the team that plays the best. And I think that's

very true this time of year."
Though the Cardinal also reached the Col
lege World Series in 2008, it never crossed
paths with the eventual-champion Bulldogs.
But Stanford is no stranger to their tendency
to play spoiler, as Fresno State was the first
team to beat the Cardinal this year after the
squad had opened the season at 8-0 against
the likes of Vanderbilt and Texas.
The Bulldogs beat up ace righty Mark
Appel (9-1) for his only loss of the season on
March 2, with sophomore centerfielder
Aaron Judge hitting two home runs in his
team's 7-4 victory. Appel's 11 strikeouts and
complete game were not enough to secure a
win.
Stanford responded dominantly the next
afternoon with a 16-0 victory and went on to
win the series on Sunday. But the squad won't
have the same chance to bounce back this
weekend, and if Fresno State can get to Appel
again Stanford could be on the brink of elim
ination by Saturday morning.
Marquess said that he isn't putting much
stock in the results of that early series.
"I think that would make a lot of differ
ence if we played them two, three, four weeks
ago," Marquess said. "But we played them the
third week of the season, so that's so long ago
that it's hard to say [if it matters], The thing I
do know about them is they're a young team,
they had a lot of freshmen who were playing,
and at this time of year they're probably not
freshmen anymore. They're probably [play
ing] like sophomores."
Regardless, Stanford holds a vast experi
ence advantage over all its opponents this
weekend, having swept its regional last sea
son and traveled to North Carolina for a
Super Regional.
Fresno State hasn't made it out of a re
gional since that magical 2008 run being
quickly eliminated in two games last year
and has only one player still on its roster from
that championship team. Two-seed Pepper
dine is playing in its eighth regional in 13 sea
sons under head coach Steve Rodriguez but
has never advanced over that time period.
Three-seed Michigan State, meanwhile, is
making its first NCAA Tournament appear
ance in 33 years.
"We have that experience going to Fuller
ton, winning a regional, going to North Car
olina with that Super Regional," said junior
catcher Eric Smith. "We now know what it
takes to win a Super Regional, and what it
takes to hopefully push our way into
Omaha."
To the man at the top step of the dugout
who has taken 16 of his teams to the College
World Series, that knowledge is priceless.
"Experience makes a big, big difference at
each step," Marquess said. "If you've never
been to Omaha before, it's hard to go there
and win; it's just so different."
To get past the Bulldogs tonight, Stanford is
going to need its role players to take center
stage. Junior outfielder Tyler Gaffney's emo
tional play helped propel the Cardinal past fa
vored Cal State-Fullerton in its 2011 regional,
while junior leftfielder and pitcher Stephen

Sophomore right fielder Austin Wilson (above) and the No. 13 Stanford baseball squad begin
their regional tonight by hosting Fresno State with junior ace pitcher Mark Appel slated to start.
Piscotty had seven hits of his own
that weekend.
Two of Stanford's wins 10-3
over Kansas State in the opener
and 14-2 over Illinois in the
clincher were powered by its
offense, but if the 1-0 nail-biter
over hometown Fullerton was
any indication, the Cardinal's
pitching will have to be at the top
of its game as well.
Perhaps the most concerning
is redshirt junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham (7-5), the Cardinal's
traditional Saturday starter.
Mooneyham bounced back from
a midseason slump with two
strong outings against Washing
ton State and Utah, but he strug
gled mightily in a 15-5 loss to Cal
at home this weekend and
seemed to have lost his command
yet again.

Piscotty (5-2) is also a question
mark on the mound. He was
named to the All-Pac-12 First
Team for his hitting and has
pitched admirably over the sec
ond half of the season, but has
never thrown on this kind of stage
before.

Marquess indicated that he
would be willing to switch
Mooneyham and Piscotty in the
order depending on their
matchups, not out of a lack of con
fidence in either.

"As far as the first game I think

it wouldn't be too wise for us to
not pitch Mark," he noted. "We're
not going to overlook Fresno
State."

It is still unclear as to which
Bulldog pitcher Appel will be fac
ing off against tonight. Fresno
State Friday starter Tyler Linehan
left his May 18 start against
Louisiana Tech after just four
pitches and missed his team's con
ference tournament, though he
has been replaced by fellow-lefty
Tom Harlan, a senior who has
started 15 games and compiled a
2.73 ERA. Though his 83 strike
outs on the season pale in com
parison to Appel's 116, Harlan
headlines the squad in that cate
gory, and the Bulldogs are eighth
in the nation in strikeouts per
nine innings (8.5).

Fresno State isn't as formida
ble at the plate, as its 5.1-run scor
ing average barely cracks the top
200 in the country. But the Bull
dogs have some dangerous
weapons in sophomore Aaron
Judge, with his .459 on-base per
centage, and junior catcher Austin
Wynns, who has 20 doubles this
year.

If Stanford can win tonight it
will face either the Spartans or the
Waves on Saturday evening.
Michigan State is impressive on
paper the Spartans are the
12th-best hitting team in the
country (628) and have the 26 th
lowest ERA (3.17) but has
amassed those stats in the rela
tively weak Big Ten. Pepperdine's
strength is in its defense, as the
Waves have turned 55 double

plays this season, but also boast a
strong all-around hitter in Joe
Sever, the WCC Player of the
Year winner.

If the Cardinal falls against the
Bulldogs, it will need to pull out
three straight wins on Sunday
afternoon, Sunday night and
Monday night to make it out
of the regional. Given the overall
quality of teams in the tourna
ment, Marquess said there's no
guarantee that heavily favored
Stanford will advance.

"Twenty-five years ago you
could've said one of these four or
five teams would win the nation
al championship, and you'd be
right," he said. "Now there's
probably 40 or 50 that can do it. I
think that Fresno State, which it's
ironic that we play, was indicative
of that when they won it. They
wouldn't have made the field of
64 if they didn't get the automat
ic [berth], and it's the same this
year."

If the Cardinal can survive the
weekend it would then likely play
No. 3 Florida State or No. 22 Mis
sissippi State, the overwhelming
favorites in Tallahassee regional
this weekend.

But first the squad has busi
ness to take care of, starting
tonight when Fresno State sets
foot in Sunken Diamond. The
Cardinal's postseason opener is
set for 6 p.m., with all of the week
end's games to be broadcasted
online at ESPN3.com.

The Cardinal baseball team (above) will play on its home field all throughout the regional. However, it cannot
overlook Fresno State, a dangerous team that defied the odds in 2008 by winning the College World Series.
