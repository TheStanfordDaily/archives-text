## THE
						ROAD BEGINS HERE CARD KICKS OFF REGIONAL AGAINST FRESNO STATE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Don't sleep on Fresno State.
That's a lesson that the college baseball
world learned the hard way in 2008, when the
unheralded, 33-27 Bulldogs took their con
ference tournament by storm and never
stopped winning, staving off elimination six
times en route to the program's first NCAA
championship in a men's sport.
The Bulldogs (30-26,8-10 Western Athlet
ic Conference) will again play underdog this
year as the No. 4 seed in their regional, and it
will be top-seeded Stanford's job to quell an
other Cinderella run when the two teams
meet on the Farm tonight in the first home re
gional for the Cardinal (38-16,18-12 Pac-12)
in four years.
Also in town are No. 2 Pepperdine (34-21,

16-8 West Coast Conference) and No. 3
Michigan State (37-21,13-11 Big Ten), which
will meet at Sunken Diamond this afternoon
before Stanford and Fresno State face off at 6
p.m.
The 13th-ranked Cardinal may be the
odds-on favorite to win its regional, but it will
still be on upset alert all weekend long.
"There's so much more parity than there
ever used to be, and I think that's real healthy
for our game," said head coach Mark Mar
quess, who is coaching in a home regional for
the 15th time in 36 seasons. "It shows when
you don't have Texas making the field of 64.
"At this stage, if you make a couple of mis
takes at the wrong time or don't win a couple
of big spots as a pitcher, you get beat," he said.
"It's that equal. As I tell the players, a lot of
times it's not the best team that wins it's
the team that plays the best. And I think that's

very true this time of year."
Though the Cardinal also reached the Col
lege World Series in 2008, it never crossed
paths with the eventual-champion Bulldogs.
But Stanford is no stranger to their tendency
to play spoiler, as Fresno State was the first
team to beat the Cardinal this year after the
squad had opened the season at 8-0 against
the likes of Vanderbilt and Texas.
The Bulldogs beat up ace righty Mark
Appel (9-1) for his only loss of the season on
March 2, with sophomore centerfielder
Aaron Judge hitting two home runs in his
team's 7-4 victory. Appel's 11 strikeouts and
complete game were not enough to secure a
win.
Stanford responded dominantly the next
afternoon with a 16-0 victory and went on to
win the series on Sunday. But the squad won't
have the same chance to bounce back this
weekend, and if Fresno State can get to Appel
again Stanford could be on the brink of elim
ination by Saturday morning.
Marquess said that he isn't putting much
stock in the results of that early series.
"I think that would make a lot of differ
ence if we played them two, three, four weeks
ago," Marquess said. "But we played them the
third week of the season, so that's so long ago
that it's hard to say [if it matters], The thing I
do know about them is they're a young team,
they had a lot of freshmen who were playing,
and at this time of year they're probably not
freshmen anymore. They're probably [play
ing] like sophomores."
Regardless, Stanford holds a vast experi
ence advantage over all its opponents this
weekend, having swept its regional last sea
son and traveled to North Carolina for a
Super Regional.
Fresno State hasn't made it out of a re
gional since that magical 2008 run being
quickly eliminated in two games last year
and has only one player still on its roster from
that championship team. Two-seed Pepper
dine is playing in its eighth regional in 13 sea
sons under head coach Steve Rodriguez but
has never advanced over that time period.
Three-seed Michigan State, meanwhile, is
making its first NCAA Tournament appear
ance in 33 years.
"We have that experience going to Fuller
ton, winning a regional, going to North Car
olina with that Super Regional," said junior
catcher Eric Smith. "We now know what it
takes to win a Super Regional, and what it
takes to hopefully push our way into
Omaha."
To the man at the top step of the dugout
who has taken 16 of his teams to the College
World Series, that knowledge is priceless.
"Experience makes a big, big difference at
each step," Marquess said. "If you've never
been to Omaha before, it's hard to go there
and win; it's just so different."
To get past the Bulldogs tonight, Stanford is
going to need its role players to take center
stage. Junior outfielder Tyler Gaffney's emo
tional play helped propel the Cardinal past fa
vored Cal State-Fullerton in its 2011 regional,
while junior leftfielder and pitcher Stephen
