# SPORTS BRIEF
## Men's golf wraps up third round of NCAA championship 
### â€” Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford men's golf team
shot a third-round score of 290
on Thursday at the NCAA cham
pionship, its best score of the
tournament, but not enough to

push the Cardinal into the final
eight-team match-play portion of
the tournament, played at Riv
iera Country Club in Pacific Pal
isades, Calif.
Stanford finished 19th overall
with a final score of 885 (+33),
tied with the University of Cen
tral Florida and 10 shots out of
the top eight.
Freshman Patrick Rodgers
continued his solid play once

again on Thursday, recording a
third-round 73 (+2) to leave him
tied for ninth place, Rodgers is six
shots behind leader Thomas
Pieters of 111., whose three-round
total of 208 (-5) is good enough
for a three-shot lead over Julien
Brun of TCU. Stanford junior
and Pac-12 individual champion
Andrew Yun had the Cardinal's
lowest score of the day with a
one-under 70.

The Cardinal's season now
ends in disappointing fashion,
without a Pac-12 or national
title. Stanford's last NCAA
championship victory was in
2007, before the tournament
moved to its current format,
where a match-play finale
among the top eight teams de
cides the winner.
