# Regional is a must-see event
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
The calendar has flipped to
June, meaning the world of
college sports is nearing its
annual hibernation period.
Almost every college sport
has ended because most college
school years have ended, so the ath
letics schedule is a little sparse.
But it's coming up on finals sea
son, which means you need some
thing to distract you from studying,
your last-second search for a sum
mer internship or, if you're like me,
your impending graduation and the
jobless, directionless, nebulous blob
known as the rest of your life.
Fear not! The sports world (and
the NCAA selection committee) has
given us all another gift: Stanford is
hosting a regional in the NCAA
baseball tournament this weekend.
The Cardinal will compete in a four
team, double-elimination bracket,
and the winner will go on to the
Super Regionals. From there, a best
of-three series will determine the
eight participants in the College
World Series.
In short, Stanford is beginning a
tournament to decide the national
champion, and in sports, there is
nothing better than a tournament.
Basketball's tournament captures
the nation's attention for a whole
month, while football's lack of a tour
nament has created such an uproar
that even Congress has gotten in
volved.

But for many, it doesn't get bet
ter than the road to Omaha. In
baseball, no game is a gimme, and
all four teams have a legitimate shot
at advancing from a regional. Take
the 2008 Fresno State team. The
Bulldogs barely got into the 64-
team tournament by winning the
WAC tournament, and as a No. 4
seed in their regional, they had the
equivalent chance of a No. 13 or 14
seed in basketball. Yet they beat the
odds, becoming the lowest seed
ever to make the College World Se
ries and then continuing their mag
ical journey all the way to winning
the national championship, the first
title in any men's sport in the
school's history.
This is particularly relevant this
year given the fact that Fresno State
is once again a No. 4 seed and, as
chance would have it, the Bulldogs
are starting the tournament against
none other than Stanford. To make
matters worse, Fresno State is the
only team that managed to defeat
Stanford's Friday starter Mark
Appel. So naturally, Appel and Fres
no State are set to face off once more
tonight.
Getting to watch Stanford in a
tournament like this is a treat, but
being able to head over to the ball
park and see it live is another thing
entirely. For the first time in four
years, the Cardinal gets to play its re
gional right here on the Farm, which
means that the team will get a home
field advantage, but also that we as
fans get a rare opportunity to watch
the tournament in person.
It is commonly said that baseball
is the best sport to watch in person,
and Sunken Diamond is as scenic a
spot for a game as you could ask for.
They say every time you go to a
game, you could see something
you've never seen before, and Stan
ford has helped support that state
ment of late, A week ago, the Cardi
nal played the longest game in school
history (18 innings and about six
hours), including the first time in my
life I've ever seen a walk-off win
overturned after an argument with
the umpires. What will happen this

In baseball, no
game is a
gimme, and
all four teams
have a
legitimate shot
at advancing.

weekend?
Finally, if you're really looking
for a reason to head on over to
Sunken Diamond this weekend,
here's the simplest one: There will
be some really good baseball. Stan

ford has as talented a team as any in
the country, and at least two Cardi
nal players will likely be first-round
draft picks in the majors. Appel and
Stephen Piscotty, Stanford's two
All-Pac-12 selections, are expected
to go in the first round this Monday
when the 2012 draft begins, and
there is a ton of talent behind them
on both sides of the ball. The Cardi
nal has been up and down this year,
but Stanford is solidly in the hunt

for the national championship with
a good shot to beat any team it
faces.
The road to Omaha begins
tonight, and I hope to see you there.

Jacob Jaffe hopes that Stanford
baseball will give him a good excuse
to road trip to Omaha. Let him

draft picks in the majors. Appel and
Stephen Piscotty, Stanford's two
All-Pac-12 selections, are expected
to go in the first round this Monday
when the 2012 draft begins, and
there is a ton of talent behind them
on both sides of the ball. The Cardi
nal has been up and down this year,
but Stanford is solidly in the hunt

for the national championship with
a good shot to beat any team it
faces.
The road to Omaha begins
tonight, and I hope to see you there.

The calendar has flipped to
June, meaning the world of
college sports is nearing its
annual hibernation period.
Almost every college sport
has ended because most college
school years have ended, so the ath
letics schedule is a little sparse.
But it's coming up on finals sea
son, which means you need some
thing to distract you from studying,
your last-second search for a sum
mer internship or, if you're like me,
your impending graduation and the
jobless, directionless, nebulous blob
known as the rest of your life.
Fear not! The sports world (and
the NCAA selection committee) has
given us all another gift: Stanford is
hosting a regional in the NCAA
baseball tournament this weekend.
The Cardinal will compete in a four
team, double-elimination bracket,
and the winner will go on to the
Super Regionals. From there, a best
of-three series will determine the
eight participants in the College
World Series.
In short, Stanford is beginning a
tournament to decide the national
champion, and in sports, there is
nothing better than a tournament.
Basketball's tournament captures
the nation's attention for a whole
month, while football's lack of a tour
nament has created such an uproar
that even Congress has gotten in
volved.

But for many, it doesn't get bet
ter than the road to Omaha. In
baseball, no game is a gimme, and
all four teams have a legitimate shot
at advancing from a regional. Take
the 2008 Fresno State team. The
Bulldogs barely got into the 64-
team tournament by winning the
WAC tournament, and as a No. 4
seed in their regional, they had the
equivalent chance of a No. 13 or 14
seed in basketball. Yet they beat the
odds, becoming the lowest seed
ever to make the College World Se
ries and then continuing their mag
ical journey all the way to winning
the national championship, the first
title in any men's sport in the
school's history.
This is particularly relevant this
year given the fact that Fresno State
is once again a No. 4 seed and, as
chance would have it, the Bulldogs
are starting the tournament against
none other than Stanford. To make
matters worse, Fresno State is the
only team that managed to defeat
Stanford's Friday starter Mark
Appel. So naturally, Appel and Fres
no State are set to face off once more
tonight.
Getting to watch Stanford in a
tournament like this is a treat, but
being able to head over to the ball
park and see it live is another thing
entirely. For the first time in four
years, the Cardinal gets to play its re
gional right here on the Farm, which
means that the team will get a home
field advantage, but also that we as
fans get a rare opportunity to watch
the tournament in person.
It is commonly said that baseball
is the best sport to watch in person,
and Sunken Diamond is as scenic a
spot for a game as you could ask for.
They say every time you go to a
game, you could see something
you've never seen before, and Stan
ford has helped support that state
ment of late, A week ago, the Cardi
nal played the longest game in school
history (18 innings and about six
hours), including the first time in my
life I've ever seen a walk-off win
overturned after an argument with
the umpires. What will happen this

In baseball, no
game is a
gimme, and
all four teams
have a
legitimate shot
at advancing.

weekend?
Finally, if you're really looking
for a reason to head on over to
Sunken Diamond this weekend,
here's the simplest one: There will
be some really good baseball. Stan

ford has as talented a team as any in
the country, and at least two Cardi
nal players will likely be first-round
draft picks in the majors. Appel and
Stephen Piscotty, Stanford's two
All-Pac-12 selections, are expected
to go in the first round this Monday
when the 2012 draft begins, and
there is a ton of talent behind them
on both sides of the ball. The Cardi
nal has been up and down this year,
