### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate approved
revised writing requirements for
undergraduates and heard an an
nual budget report at its penulti
mate meeting of the academic
year Thursday.
Acting President and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
opened the meeting by delivering
a personal statement in memory
of former University President
Richard Lyman.
Lyman, who served as the Uni
versity's seventh president from
September 1970 to August 1980,
died Sunday night of congestive
heart failure in Palo Alto. He was
88.

Etchemendy praised Lyman's
work at Stanford as both an ad
ministrator and faculty member,
noting that his time in office
spanned a period of sustained stu

dent protests and elevated ten
sions with administrators.

"It was a period unlike any
other in Stanford's history,"
Etchemendy said. "Dick not only
preserved Stanford during this
turbulent period, [but] he left us
stronger and better.... We owe
Dick Lyman a great debt for his
guidance of our university during
that time,"

The Senate observed a mo
ment of silence in Lyman's memo
ry.

Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP)
Chair Judy Goldstein then deliv
ered a report on minor revisions
to undergraduate writing require
ments.

Goldstein noted that C-USP's
recommendations on writing re
quirements would be "a little less
contentious" than previous C
