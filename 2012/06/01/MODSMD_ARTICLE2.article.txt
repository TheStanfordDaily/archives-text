# Faculty Senate revises writing requirements
## PWR classes to explicitly include oral, visual and digital modes of communication 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate approved
revised writing requirements for
undergraduates and heard an an
nual budget report at its penulti
mate meeting of the academic
year Thursday.
Acting President and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
opened the meeting by delivering
a personal statement in memory
of former University President
Richard Lyman.
Lyman, who served as the Uni
versity's seventh president from
September 1970 to August 1980,
died Sunday night of congestive
heart failure in Palo Alto. He was
88.

Etchemendy praised Lyman's
work at Stanford as both an ad
ministrator and faculty member,
noting that his time in office
spanned a period of sustained stu

dent protests and elevated ten
sions with administrators.

"It was a period unlike any
other in Stanford's history,"
Etchemendy said. "Dick not only
preserved Stanford during this
turbulent period, [but] he left us
stronger and better.... We owe
Dick Lyman a great debt for his
guidance of our university during
that time,"

The Senate observed a mo
ment of silence in Lyman's memo
ry.

Co-chair of SUES Susan McConnell spoke at Faculty Senate Thursday. The group focused on undergraduate
writing requirements and heard an annual budget report at its second to last meeting of the school year.
USP recommendations on sub
jects such as breadth require
ments which were debated
over multiple Senate meetings.

Under the C-USP recommen
dation, the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) would be
expanded to include "oral, visual
and digital communication," as
recommended by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report. The C
USP recommendation also added
an explicit stipulation that classes
fulfilling writing requirements be
taught by tenure-line faculty or
academic staff.
"We included that to assure
the quality of the classes, when
and if they're offered by depart
ments," Goldstein said.
"There is the overarching
goal of integrating the program
more fully into the departmental
life of the University," added As
sociate Professor of English
Nicholas Jenkins. "It's very im
portant that the program reflect

the full academic spectrum of
the University."
Susan McConnell, professor of
biology and co-chair of the SUES
committee, framed the increased
breadth in the writing require
ment as a reflection of ongoing
trends in communications.

"[ln recent years] the means of
communication have proliferat
ed," McConnell said. "What we
hoped was that students wouldn't
be prevented from exploring the
forms of communication that will
be most helpful for them in their
professional development."
The amended requirements
passed the Senate by unanimous
voice vote, bringing to an end a se
ries of reforms of Stanford's un
dergraduate education originat
ing with the SUES report.

"We've concluded the role of
the Senate in putting in place a
new vision for undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford," said Rose
mary Knight Ph.D. 'B5, professor
of geophysics and Senate chair,
thanking SUES and C-USP com
mittee members for their efforts.
"The next few years are going to
be really exciting."

The Senate then heard the an
nual budget report, delivered by

Vice Provost for Budget and Aux
iliaries Management Tim Warner
MBA '77.

"Our financial position is very
strong," Warner said. "We're run
ning surpluses.... Some of the
moves we made a few years ago to
cut budgets and reset the Univer
sity financially are really starting
to pay off."
Warner emphasized the role of
the strategic direction of the 2012-
13 budget, which focuses on en
suring faculty salary competitive
ness, strengthening budgetary
support for undergraduate finan
cial aid and otherwise responding
to University spending priorities.
He acknowledged, however,
that critical revenue sources
such as health care services, feder
al research funding and invest
ment income may come under
pressure in the year ahead.
Warner predicted a total rev
enue sum of $4.4 billion during
the upcoming academic year, up 4
percent from the 2011-12 fiscal
year. The projected University
surplus of approximately $220
million remains unchanged from
this year.

According to Warner, student
income will serve as a significant

contributor to increased revenue,
with the figure set to rise by 3.4
percent from this year even as the
University continues to increase
the amount of financial aid of
fered to both undergraduate and
graduate students.
From 2007 to 2012, University
expenditure on financial aid in
creased from $66 million to $127
million, with that figure projected
to rise to $152 million by 2017.

Nevertheless, Warner said
Stanford has seen a largely robust
recovery from the recession, not
ing a 3.6 percent annual growth
rate in total revenues from 2007
to 2012, despite falling levels of
federal research and financial aid
funding. University reserves have
grown by 6.8 percent per year
over the same period, while Stan
ford's endowment has nearly re
turned to pre-recession levels.

"We're not back to where we
were before the recession, but
we're close," Warner said. "We do
need to turn attention to some of
those revenue sources that may
be under pressure."

Warner also noted that the
2012-13 budget includes signifi
cant capital expenditure, with a
projected outlay of $529.5 million

contributing to a three-year Capi
tal Plan that will require approxi
mately $2.1 billion in total expen
ditures for completion.
The largest segment of capital
expenditure, totaling $134.2 mil
lion, will be allocated to the Stan
ford Energy Systems Innovation
(SESI), a renovation of Stanford's
central energy facility.
The Faculty Senate will hear
reports on the Emeriti Council
and the School of Medicine at its
final meeting of the year on June
14.

The Faculty Senate approved
revised writing requirements for
undergraduates and heard an an
nual budget report at its penulti
mate meeting of the academic
year Thursday.
Acting President and Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
opened the meeting by delivering
a personal statement in memory
of former University President
Richard Lyman.
Lyman, who served as the Uni
versity's seventh president from
September 1970 to August 1980,
died Sunday night of congestive
heart failure in Palo Alto. He was
88.

Etchemendy praised Lyman's
work at Stanford as both an ad
ministrator and faculty member,
noting that his time in office
spanned a period of sustained stu

dent protests and elevated ten
sions with administrators.

"It was a period unlike any
other in Stanford's history,"
Etchemendy said. "Dick not only
preserved Stanford during this
turbulent period, [but] he left us
stronger and better.... We owe
Dick Lyman a great debt for his
guidance of our university during
that time,"

The Senate observed a mo
ment of silence in Lyman's memo
ry.

Co-chair of SUES Susan McConnell spoke at Faculty Senate Thursday. The group focused on undergraduate
writing requirements and heard an annual budget report at its second to last meeting of the school year.
USP recommendations on sub
jects such as breadth require
ments which were debated
over multiple Senate meetings.

Under the C-USP recommen
dation, the Program in Writing
and Rhetoric (PWR) would be
expanded to include "oral, visual
and digital communication," as
recommended by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report. The C
USP recommendation also added
an explicit stipulation that classes
fulfilling writing requirements be
taught by tenure-line faculty or
academic staff.
"We included that to assure
the quality of the classes, when
and if they're offered by depart
ments," Goldstein said.
"There is the overarching
goal of integrating the program
more fully into the departmental
life of the University," added As
sociate Professor of English
Nicholas Jenkins. "It's very im
portant that the program reflect

the full academic spectrum of
the University."
Susan McConnell, professor of
biology and co-chair of the SUES
committee, framed the increased
breadth in the writing require
ment as a reflection of ongoing
trends in communications.

"[ln recent years] the means of
communication have proliferat
ed," McConnell said. "What we
hoped was that students wouldn't
be prevented from exploring the
forms of communication that will
be most helpful for them in their
professional development."
The amended requirements
passed the Senate by unanimous
voice vote, bringing to an end a se
ries of reforms of Stanford's un
dergraduate education originat
ing with the SUES report.

"We've concluded the role of
the Senate in putting in place a
new vision for undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford," said Rose
mary Knight Ph.D. 'B5, professor
of geophysics and Senate chair,
thanking SUES and C-USP com
mittee members for their efforts.
"The next few years are going to
be really exciting."

The Senate then heard the an
nual budget report, delivered by

Vice Provost for Budget and Aux
iliaries Management Tim Warner
MBA '77.

"Our financial position is very
strong," Warner said. "We're run
ning surpluses.... Some of the
moves we made a few years ago to
cut budgets and reset the Univer
sity financially are really starting
to pay off."
Warner emphasized the role of
the strategic direction of the 2012-
13 budget, which focuses on en
suring faculty salary competitive
ness, strengthening budgetary
support for undergraduate finan
cial aid and otherwise responding
to University spending priorities.
He acknowledged, however,
that critical revenue sources
such as health care services, feder
al research funding and invest
ment income may come under
pressure in the year ahead.
Warner predicted a total rev
enue sum of $4.4 billion during
the upcoming academic year, up 4
percent from the 2011-12 fiscal
year. The projected University
surplus of approximately $220
million remains unchanged from
this year.

According to Warner, student
income will serve as a significant

contributor to increased revenue,
with the figure set to rise by 3.4
percent from this year even as the
University continues to increase
the amount of financial aid of
fered to both undergraduate and
graduate students.
From 2007 to 2012, University
expenditure on financial aid in
creased from $66 million to $127
million, with that figure projected
to rise to $152 million by 2017.

Nevertheless, Warner said
Stanford has seen a largely robust
recovery from the recession, not
ing a 3.6 percent annual growth
rate in total revenues from 2007
to 2012, despite falling levels of
federal research and financial aid
funding. University reserves have
grown by 6.8 percent per year
over the same period, while Stan
ford's endowment has nearly re
turned to pre-recession levels.

"We're not back to where we
were before the recession, but
we're close," Warner said. "We do
need to turn attention to some of
those revenue sources that may
be under pressure."

Warner also noted that the
2012-13 budget includes signifi
cant capital expenditure, with a
projected outlay of $529.5 million

contributing to a three-year Capi
tal Plan that will require approxi
mately $2.1 billion in total expen
