## FLICKS TO CATCH THIS SUMMER 
### 
The countdown 'til summer is at
under two weeks, and what is
more summery than going to the
movies? Movie theater air condi
tioning provides a respite from
the heat, and producers are
counting on your retreat into the
dark cool, so they're saving their
best for this sunniest of seasons.
Here are five of the movies we'll
be watching this summer.

"Safety Not Guaranteed"
A man places a wanted ad
requesting someone to accom
pany him on his time-travel
expedition. A magazine writer
(Jake Johnson, "New Girl") and
two interns investigate the story,
with the fantastic Aubrey Plaza
("Parks and Recreation")
answering the man's ad. Look
for a task as interesting as this
one at your summer internship.
From the producers of "Little
Miss Sunshine," this has poten
tial to be a dysfunctional yet
charming romp with a hint of
magic.

"The Campaign"
Will Ferrell stars as a sleazy fifth
term incumbent for Congress
locked in a cutthroat campaign
against Zach Galifianakis, a
dweeby citizen with political
aspirations. The satirical look at
political game-play and promis
es made feels especially relevant
in an election year. This movie
could do for politicians what
Ferrell has done for anchormen
and figure skaters. That is to say,
make them even more quotable
and better dressed.

"Magic Mike"
Channing Tatum stars as a suc
cessful stripper who dreams of

designing furniture. Tatum was a
stripper before he was an actor,
which gives him both authentici
ty and authority in this role. He
proved his comedic skills in "21
Jump Street" and his dancing
skills in "Step Up." A combina
tion of hilarity and exotic danc
ing could make for Tatum's best
performance yet.

"The Dark Knight
Rises"
It's basically a classic before its
release. As the final installation
in Christopher Nolan's
"Batman" trilogy and the last to
cast the stern Christian Bale as
Bruce Wayne, "The Dark Knight
Rises" follows our superhero as
he returns from near-exile to
take down a terrorist leader.
With the cultural relevance of
terrorism and the ever-tanking
economy, not to mention the
obvious draw of another Nolan
masterpiece and superhero
flick, this film will be a block
buster worth seeing, if not just
for the reunion of almost the
entire "Inception" cast.

"Brave"
What's summer without a Pixar
film? "Brave" takes us back in
time to the Scotland Highlands
where Merida refuses to con
form to the expectations of
young women and ends up
invoking an awful curse that
turns her kingdom into a chaot
ic mess. But she is brave and
fixes it. Not only is this the first
Pixar film with a female star, but
"Brave" is also the first Pixar
film starring a redhead (unless
we count Nemo). Progressive
representations aside, this film is
sure to be a beautiful artistic
achievement.
