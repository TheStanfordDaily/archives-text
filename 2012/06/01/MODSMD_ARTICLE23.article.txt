-A- 1960s drama about
a pair of reporters determined to
revoke a prison inmate's death
sentence in small-town Florida is
more style than substance, fore
going a rich historical and cultur
al context for a messy adaptation
of Pete Braxton's novel that not
even a brave performance by vet

save.
In the summer of 1969,
Miami journalists Ward James
(Matthew McConaughey) and
Yardley Acheman (David
Oyelowo) return to Ward's
hometown to investigate the case
of death row inmate Hillary Van
Wetter (John Cusack), whose trial
appears to have been a harried
case of redneck justice. Desperate
to help them in any way she can is
Charlotte Bless (Kidman), a trou

who devotes her free time to writ
ing inmates; it is through this
exact correspondence that she
and Van Wetter become engaged.
Ward's younger brother Jack (Zac
Effon) tags along as well,
although his motivation lies more
in his infatuation with Charlotte
than any particular interest in the
case.
The deeper the investigation
gets, the more personalities and
interests clash. Whereas Ward

tackles the assignment from an
attitude of idealistic righteous
ness, Yardley only wants a sala

The townsfolk are vocally unhap
py about the intrusion into the
community's past, and talks with
Van Wetter in prison raise more
questions than they answer.
Determination to the point of
recklessness seems to run in the
family, as Ward decides to press
on without Yardley and Jack con

tinues to pursue Charlotte with
dangerous consequences for all.
Kidman delivers a mesmer
izing performance as the consci
entious Charlotte, the sort of
woman who sucks all the air out
of the room when she enters. The
rest of the cast is nowhere near as
on target, although it's difficult to
say whether the script or the
actors are to blame. Cusack's
