## 'COSMOPOLIS' UPDATES 'ULYSSES' 'dangerous method' director's modern 'odyssey' 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
Following in the dense intel
lectual style of last year's "A
Dangerous Method," David
Cronenberg's "Cosmopolis" is
heavily dialogue- and theory-driv
en, only this time the psychoanaly
sis has been replaced with econom
ic and financial jargon in an eerily
dystopian retelling of James Joyce's
"Ulysses." Adapted from Don
DeLillo's novel of the same name,
this riveting commentary on capi
talism could not have come at a
more appropriate time.
Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson)
is a 28-year-old Wall Street hotshot
whose determination to get a hair
cut across town turns into an
unexpected all-day ordeal.
Delaying his journey through
Manhattan is the president's visit
to the city, a celebrity funeral and
an anarchist protest that bears
strong resemblance to the Occupy

movement (although any similari
ty is purely coincidental since pro
duction ceased before Occupy Wall
Street became a phenomenon).
Isolated from the outside
world in his custom-built white
stretch limo, Eric's only real links to
reality are the brief interactions
with his employees, advisors, wife
and would-be assassins. Through
these conversations, much more of
Eric's character is revealed than his
cool, unaffected demeanor out
wardly belies. His refusal to heed
advice from both his workers, who
urge him not to bet against the
yuan, and his head of security, who
wants him to take threats against
his life more seriously, only hint at
Eric's simultaneous reckless ambi
tion and indifference to his own
destruction.
Eric's encounters with his new
wife Elise (Sarah Gadon), an aspir

ing poet from a wealthy family,
reveal a different side as well. Not
only is it evident that their loveless
marriage was essentially a business
merger, but also that, as the wealth
iest characters, they are both woe
fully out of touch with society. Eric

has his limo to shield him from the
outside, but even Elise, who
allegedly spends her free time wan
dering the city, remains equally
aloof and disengaged. Despite their
similarities, they simply cannot
relate to each other, making self
aware references that they know
that couples are supposed to com
municate and yet they are unable
to. Of course, Elise withholding sex
doesn't help the relationship either.
What are the true values of
time and money? This question
constantly rears its head as it
becomes increasingly apparent that
Eric cannot possibly make it to the
barber before closing and as he
watches his fortune dwindle thanks
to his stubborn investment deci
sions. Protestors brandishing dead
rats and vandalizing his limo don't
faze him, and it is only when a for
mer employee points a gun at his
head that Eric begins to show an
inkling of emotion.
"Cosmopolis" undoubtedly

has a lot to say about the current
state of society the economic
crisis, the self-interested business
culture, the unrest of the lower
classes but Cronenberg's
approach to the material has
already proved divisive. Early pro
motional footage emphasizes the
sex and action of the story but, like
"A Dangerous Method," the film
has a distinct literary sensibility
with much of the dialogue being
lifted straight from the book. It's a
thinking fan's film, but worth the
effort because, after all, how often
is it that life imitates art?
