# FESTIVALS
## 'I LOVE THIS CITY' AFTER ALL 
### – felix BOYEAUX contact felix: fboyeaux@stanford. edu 
It was last weekend in the arid hills of
Mountain View that the I Love This
City Music Festival perhaps better
dubbed I Love This Suburb after the
venue change from the AT&T Lot to the
local Shoreline Amphitheater took
place. Surprisingly enough, despite the
countless organizational blunders, the
festival managed to deliver a fantastic
experience to the thousands who attend
ed.

The outlook was not so good. Only
three weeks before the event was sched
uled, the organizers announced the
change of location, the lowering of the
age limit to 16-plus and, most surprising
ly, that the two-day passes were now $5O
cheaper than when people originally
bought them. As compensation, early
ticket-buyers got access to priority seat
ing. Fair enough.

Of course, these announcements

lead to many claiming reimbursements
or threatening Live Nation and Skills
the producers of the festival with law
suits. The tension on the Facebook page
was palpable. However, on the first day of
the event, 25,000 people still showed up.

Over 40 artists performed on

the three different stages, but
for fans of something other
than hardcore dubstep, the

main stage was the place to be.

After queuing up for
over 45 minutes to get into
the reserved seating area
in front of the main stage,
paying 10 dollars for a hot
dog and being informed
that we would not be able to
leave the reserved area
even for bathroom breaks

unless we were willing to give up
our spot on the fifth row right in
front of the stage, we were ready

for the night to start.
NERVO, the bubbling
Australian twin sisters, was
the first act we were able to
catch, closely followed by a
somewhat tired-looking i

Claude VonStroke, whose bass made
everyone's ears ring and chests vibrate
disturbingly.

The problem was that his set went
. on and on, way past Chuckie's
■ scheduled appearance time. As

the crowd
began to get
impatient and
VonStroke slowly

ran out of songs
to play, word start-

1 ed spreading that
Chuckie had missed
his flight from Las
Vegas.
k It was thus a
disappointed audi
ence that welcomed

Steve Aoki onstage right
before sunset. Luckily
enough, Aoki's showman
ship, cake-throwing and
crowd-surfing rubber boat
/managed to revive the atmos
phere right in time for Duck
Sauce's appearance. Everyone in
the audience was happily jumping

to the sound of "Barbra Streisand," wear
ing plastic duck noses tossed out by
stagehands just before the show.
Sebastian Ingrosso was next.
Ingrosso, a third of Swedish House Mafia,
started his set with the brand-new song
"Greyhound" and finished with what has
now become an EDM anthem, "Save The
World," which was sung in harmony by
all 15,000 people present at the main
stage. In the meantime, he managed to
set fire to the audience with his pumping
beats and laser show. Ingrosso's mix was
unequivocally the best performance of
the festival and left the amphitheater in a
state of buzzing happiness all through

Afrojack's set and until the doors opened

on Saturday.
Unfortunately, due to the fire mar
shals having to intervene to shut off the
already overfilled seating area early on
Saturday, I was a little irritated that we
entered the amphitheater with just
enough time to see Madeon perform his
two most famous songs. The young
Frenchman was overflowing with energy
an energy that he managed to trans
mit to the audience before giving over the

decks to Laidback Luke, who was fol
lowed by Tiesto.
David Guetta then opened his
performance with a remixed ver
sion of "Titanium," to which
everyone sang along. As Guetta
lowered the volume of the
music to hear the audience
sing, one could not help
but to get goosebumps
from the sense of unity
that all the performers
had managed to create.
This was even more
accentuated as Guetta
finished with
"Without You," dur
ing which the entire
crowd held on to
each other, sway
ing back and
forth, before
jumping as Guetta
dropped the bass
for the last time of the
weekend.
