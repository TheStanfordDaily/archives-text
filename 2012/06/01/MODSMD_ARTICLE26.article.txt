# VIDEO GAMES
## IN DEFENSE OF GAMING 
### – detonate adams contact nate: nadams@stanford. edu 
For as much joy as they've brought into
my life, video games seem to have an
inescapable place on the rhetorical hit
list of pundits, parents and pollsters alike.
The examples are endless, but here are some
modern highlights to set the stage: In 2010,
Fox News presumptuously lambasted Mass
Effect 2 for featuring "full digital nudity and
sex," two things the Bio Ware classic most
certainly did not contain. Just last week,
Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee
ignited Twitter during an interview when he
alluded to "all this violence, all this horrible

sexism" inherent to video games. Philip
Zimbardo, a professor emeritus in my very
own Stanford Psychology Department,

attempted to take a more scientific
approach to game criticism in a book he
released last week. He argues that young
males are being re-wired by porn and J
video games they're the same, I
apparently— to "demand constant
stimulation" and are "desensitized to

reality and real-life interactions with oth-

ers." (For whatever reason, he com
pletely fails to address the 42 percent
of all gamers who are women and the
50 percent of gamers over age 37.)

Well-articulated or not, attacks on video
games are nothing new. Even when our par
ents were playing Pong in their basements
and Pac-Man at Pizza Hut, they shirked off a
sizable population of player-haters.
The big surprise? After all these decades
of mashing buttons, the world is still spin
ning. Apples still fall down off the tree, not
up. Winter follows autumn. Young people
are still getting up to no good, falling in love,
tending to families and settling down the
same way they always have. Life marches on
in the video game era, and I daresay it's a
touch better because of them.

I won't pretend that I can scientifically
dismantle every argument against video
games not alone, at least, and not in a
newspaper column. But as a lifelong gamer
and a halfway-decent adult, I'm always eager
to throw my hat in the ring.

Let's start with
some facts. Video
games certainly
do "re-wire" our *

brains, but not always
in a bad way. According to independent
research from the University of Rochester,
for example, subjects who played action-ori
ented games made decisions 25 percent
faster than others without sacrificing accura
cy and more adept gamers can make
basic decisions up to four times faster than
others, again with no decline in accuracy.
Practiced gamers can also keep track of up

to six things at once, compared to four for
non-gamers. Another study found that
game-playing women were better able to
mentally manipulate 3D objects, a skill at
which men are generally more adept. A lon
gitudinal study by Linda Jackson on hun
dreds of Michigan middle schoolers found
that more time playing games correlated to
higher scores on a standardized assessment
of creativity, completely regardless of the
games' genres.

If you put on a headlamp and get your
hands dirty on Google, you can dig up plen
ty of fodder for the pro-game fire. Video
games can improve literacy in four- and
five-year-olds, help employees train at over
20 percent of Fortune 500 companies, ease
pain during medical operations, cure lazy

eyes and reduce surgical errors by nearly 40
percent. Two-thirds of gamers use them to
bond with friends, and nowadays, fitness
games can even teach us yoga and give us a
legitimate workout.

All that info is out there, waiting to be
found. I just wish more people would both
er to look for it before they make ignorant
claims about the world's largest entertain
ment industry.

But my personal love affair with video
games isn't grounded in statistics. At its core,
it rests on a lifetime of positive, formative
and moving experiences.

The Zelda series has

inspired my imagination,
ever more intensely, since
I was five. Pokemon Red
and Blue, simple as they
were, helped me learn to
read. Final Fantasy VII
drew out my first tears in
response to a story of love
and death you may
know the scene I'm

f referring to. Halo
LAN parties, and the

pizza that accompanied

them, brought me together with friends of
my youth. Even Grand Theft Auto 111, that
most egregious of transgressors, gave me a
safe and healthy outlet for the kind of boyish,
real-life trouble-making that any young man
needs to get out of his system. (I'm sure that,
like me, some of you reading this played GTA
or Halo in your friends' basements without
their parents having a clue. Naughty indeed,
but harmless.)
Since video games have undeniably
made a large impact on the world, I wish
people on both sides of the argument would
open their eyes to the more subtle nuances of
this intricate medium of expression and give
it the respect, if not admiration, that it
deserves.
