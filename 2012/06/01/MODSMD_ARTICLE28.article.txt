## PALO ALTO's GOT SOL In Good Taste 
### â€“ rachel ZARROW contact rachel: rjzarrow@stanford. edu 
I liked Palo Alto Sol before Mark
Zuckerberg did ... or at least
before last Friday's New York
Times reported that he did.
According to the Times article,
Palo Alto Sol was one of the restau
rants chosen to cater his wedding
to Priscilla Chan on May 19.
Palo Alto Sol, located on
California Avenue, offers diners a
wide selection of unique dishes
from Puebla, Mexico. Upon enter
ing Sol, one immediately feels
transported to another world or at
least to a lively fiesta. While it's
often difficult to get a table, diners
will find that Sol is worth the wait

especially since the wait often
includes chips, salsas and perhaps a
margarita at the bar.
After being welcomed by the
friendly servers, whether waiting at
the bar or seated at my table, 1 am
always pleased with the aforemen
tioned tortilla chips. The chips are
served with three salsas one
mild, one smoky and one zesty.
The fresh guacamole, also a per
sonal favorite, provides a mild
respite from the fiery yet addictive
salsas.
The Sopa Azteca, one of their
specialties, is a massive bowl of tor
tilla soup, loaded with avocado,
tomatoes, tortilla strips, cilantro,
cheese and chicken. Sopa Azteca is
the ultimate comfort food; while I
won't claim that it's a bottomless
bowl, a la Olive Garden, it is a
rather hefty and potentially share
able portion.
During my most recent visit,
what impressed me most was the
section of Sol's dinner menu
devoted sole-ly, (pun-intended) to
Enchiladas. I tried the Chipotle
Cheese Enchiladas, which were
drenched in a smoky and complex
sauce. Other popular items
include burritos, fajitas, and vari
ous combination platters.
After a satisfying dinner at Sol,
it's easy to see why the Facebook
billionaire chose this restaurant to
cater his wedding. It's that good.
