## ROXY SASS ROXY TECH 
### 
Stanford is deep inside Silicon
Valley, and Roxy (who gener
ally prefers it when people are
deep inside her) has learned a thing
or two about technology during her
time here, other than that teledil
donics lecture in the virtual people
class. Technology (when used prop
erly) can be a great tool not just
for changing the world, but equally
importantly, for getting people laid.
In the spirit of information sharing
and open communication, Roxy's
prepared some tips for using 21st
century tools to, ahem, get your sili
con into her valley.
Texting
Roxy's covered the art of booty tex
ting before, but she'd like to
remind everyone of one key point.
While Roxy doesn't always advocate
subtlety, Roxy also doesn't usually
leave evidence of her indiscretions
(sheets can be washed, cell phones
probably shouldn't be). At least early
on in the texting conversation, Roxy
recommends you keep your inten
tions close to the vest... once you
meet up, you can remove said vest
and, you know, all other clothing.
Pictures
Similar to but even more danger
ous than texting is sending naked
pictures. Unless you want to go the
way of Roxy's favoritely named
politician (a certain Mr. Weiner),
Roxy advises caution. Of course,
you may have heard of Snapchat,
since it's been covered extensively
by the media. The magic of
Snapchat is that while you may
have a number of pictures in
which you are ... uncovered exten
sively, you don't have to fear they'll

get anywhere near the media,
because the picture disappears in a
matter of seconds. You might say
Snapchat is the only time Roxy has
any patience for something that
stays up for fewer than 30 seconds.
Location tracking
They say knowledge is power (and
Roxy loves having the power in her
relationships), but sometimes
knowledge is also just plain creepy.
That's the case with apps that allow
you to see exactly where someone is.
If you're habitually taking note of
someone's location via Glassmap or
Find My Friends, you've crossed the
line into serious stalker territory — a
path that is scarier than the one that
leads to KA. Roxy recommends you
avoid involving these tools in your
pursuits entirely lest you end up in
handcuffs (and not in a kinky
way).
Technological Difficulties
Unfortunately, technology occa
sionally fails (Roxy's met men who
could last longer than her laptop
battery), and when that happens,
you have a few options. You can
always try spitting some good, old
fashioned game. Like meeting
someone who doesn't hope to one
day start a company, getting hit on
in person can be a refreshing
change. Of course, if you, like Roxy
(and allegedly quite a few freshman
girls), have something of a thing
for RCCs, tech failure can be your
perfect opportunity. "Excuse me, I
just can't seem to get my iPhone
onto the Stanford network. Maybe
I could get you off instead?"

more than just cables? Send them
