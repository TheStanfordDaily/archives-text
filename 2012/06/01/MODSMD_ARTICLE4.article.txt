these individuals do, and hopeful
ly it serves as inspiration for the

Imani Parker-Fong 'l5, one of the
event organizers.
Julie Lythcott-Flaims 'B9, as
sociate vice provost for under
graduate education and dean of
freshmen and undergraduate ad

featured performances by vari
ous student groups and the pres

the first time that all awards were
presented together.

ford Fund (TSF) Partnership
Program Award, the Deans'

The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center took home the last award.

"For us as an organization, it's
a nice way to communicate to
other groups that we want to be a
center for mental health on cam
pus, and be more of a center of
gravity than we are now," said

Devney Llamilton 'l3, a peer
counselor at The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center. "Flopefully
it'll get more people interested in
getting involved."
Parker-Fong and David Dindi
'l5 organized the gala, under the
mentorship of former ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and
former ASSU Executive Chief of

Staff Lina Hidalgo 'l3. Student
groups such as Fleet Street,
Mixed Company, Kayumanggi,
Mariachi Cardenal and the Stan
ford Orchestra performed at the
event.

By hosting a gala open to all of
the Stanford community, the or
ganizers said they aimed to be in
clusive to others beyond the

award recipients. In addition to
entertainment, the formal event
also offered free dinner for all
those attending.
"It was cool seeing what other
people are doing, taking time to
showcase a small sample of
what's going on around campus,"

On Thursday night, more than
100 students and faculty mem
bers attended Stanford's first an
nual Awards Gala and Dinner, a
celebration intended to recog
nize student achievements and
contributions to the community.
Event organizers said they hoped
the gala will become a permanent
fixture on campus.

"We want this to be a new
Stanford tradition an oppor
tunity for Stanford students to
recognize the hard work and
service to the community that
these individuals do, and hopeful
ly it serves as inspiration for the
rest of the Stanford body," said
Imani Parker-Fong 'l5, one of the
event organizers.
Julie Lythcott-Flaims 'B9, as
sociate vice provost for under
graduate education and dean of
freshmen and undergraduate ad
vising, hosted the event, which
featured performances by vari
ous student groups and the pres

entation of awards. While awards
are usually presented individual
ly by different organizations
for example, the Alumni Associa
tion and the ASSU this was
the first time that all awards were
presented together.

Awards include the The Stan
ford Fund (TSF) Partnership
Program Award, the Deans'
Award, the Lyons Award, the
Sterling Award, the Oustanding
Achievement Award, ASSU
Teacher of the Year, and ASSU
Voluntary Student Organization
(VSO) of the Year.
The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center took home the last award.

"For us as an organization, it's
a nice way to communicate to
other groups that we want to be a
center for mental health on cam
pus, and be more of a center of
gravity than we are now," said

Devney Llamilton 'l3, a peer
counselor at The Bridge Peer
Counseling Center. "Flopefully
it'll get more people interested in
getting involved."
Parker-Fong and David Dindi
'l5 organized the gala, under the
mentorship of former ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and
former ASSU Executive Chief of

Staff Lina Hidalgo 'l3. Student
groups such as Fleet Street,
Mixed Company, Kayumanggi,
Mariachi Cardenal and the Stan
ford Orchestra performed at the
event.

By hosting a gala open to all of
the Stanford community, the or
ganizers said they aimed to be in
clusive to others beyond the

award recipients. In addition to
entertainment, the formal event
also offered free dinner for all
those attending.
"It was cool seeing what other
people are doing, taking time to
showcase a small sample of
what's going on around campus,"

Remound Wright 'l5 attended
the gala to support friends.
"The gala was great," Wright
said. "It was nice seeing the per
formances, and honoring and see
ing people who do amazing things
here at Stanford."

Organizers said the event was
designed to inspire students to
take advantage of the opportuni
ties around them.
"Students can benefit because
it enlightens them to things that
they may not know about that are
going on around campus," Wright
said. "They may discover some
thing that they themselves want
to do, and wouldn't have known if
they hadn't attended. Plus, it's just
good to show support to fellow
students."
