## CDC predicts increased employment Choy cites resources available to grads still on the market 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Forty percent of Stanford students
obtain their post-graduation jobs
through friends, alumni, faculty and
family, according to Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) Director Lance
Choy, which he said demonstrates the
prevalence of traditional networking
strategies in the job search.
The CDC plans to survey seniors
during dead week to determine how
many have secured jobs and how many
are still searching for positions. Choy,
however, predicted that while some
members of the senior class have jobs
lined up, more members of the senior
class will find jobs in the months after
leaving Stanford. Expressing optimism
about an improved employment mar
ket, he cited in particular the increased
number of job listings on the CDC site
over the past two years.
