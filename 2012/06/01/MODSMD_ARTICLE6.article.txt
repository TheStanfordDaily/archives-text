## CDC predicts increased employment Choy cites resources available to grads still on the market 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Forty percent of Stanford students
obtain their post-graduation jobs
through friends, alumni, faculty and
family, according to Career Develop
ment Center (CDC) Director Lance
Choy, which he said demonstrates the
prevalence of traditional networking
strategies in the job search.
The CDC plans to survey seniors
during dead week to determine how
many have secured jobs and how many
are still searching for positions. Choy,
however, predicted that while some
members of the senior class have jobs
lined up, more members of the senior
class will find jobs in the months after
leaving Stanford. Expressing optimism
about an improved employment mar
ket, he cited in particular the increased
number of job listings on the CDC site
over the past two years.
The National Association of
Colleges and Employers' recent
Student Survey reinforces
Choy's assessment. According to
the association's research, about
26 percent of 2012 college grad
uates have a job lined up, com
pared to 24 percent last year.

"Seniors can use CDC servic
es up to 12 months after gradua
tion," Choy wrote in an email to
The Daily. "They can make ap
pointments with career coun
selors to review resumes, prac
tice interviewing skills and learn
various tips and strategies on
how to find jobs. New alumni can
use CDC job postings and at
tend career fairs. They are no
longer eligible for Cardinal Re
cruiting (on-campus recruiting)
once they graduate."
Choy explained that the job
search field is currently chang
ing due to the increased use of
social networking websites.
"More and more employers
are using Linkedln, a social net
working tool, to find candi
dates," Choy wrote. "There are a
number of efforts to use Face
book to find jobs, but that seems
to be an on-going developmen
tal effort."
However, traditional net
working can still be critical for
those seeking employment,
Choy added.
Andy Nguyen 'l2 will be
working at the National Insti
tutes of Health (NIH) in the
Gene Regulation and Develop
ment Section of The National In
stitute of Diabetes and Diges
tive and Kidney Diseases
(NIDDK) after graduation. He
took a more service-oriented ap
proach to his job search.

"I got some e-mails from the
CDC that were helpful, but my
interests are in public service, so
I received more assistance from
the Haas Center," Nguyen said.
"I chose the NIH because the
position is very learning- and
training-oriented."
Mia Shaw 'l2 had a similar
experience regarding her
search for job opportunities
post-graduation, and even
though she did not find her po
sition directly through the
CDC, she still made use of some
of the center's services. Shaw is
a human biology major with a
focus in adolescent health and
development. Next year, she
will teach middle school science
in the Las Vegas Valley with
Teach for America.
"I think the CDC is a valu
able resource, one that I did not
utilize enough during my time
here at Stanford," Shaw said.
"They have helped me with re
constructing my resume, and I
have enjoyed attending some of
the panels and presentations
they have held. Honestly, I prob
ably would have used them more
if I did not physically have to
walk to the CDC building as
often or if they had more job op
portunities in the humanities."
The Stanford Alumni Associ
ation's Alumni Career Services
program also offers resources to
recent graduates.
"The CDC provides free
counseling to students and
alums one year out," said Man
ager of Alumni Services Fedra
Pouideh. "We then provide a list
of career coaches available
across the nation for those inter
ested in additional services.
Members of the Stanford Alum
ni Association receive a free
