# Researchers use laser to gain image of lysozymes
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
Researchers at the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory re
cently used the Linac Coherent
Light Source (LCLS) laser to visu
alize crystallized biomolecules
such as lysozymes, which are small
proteins found in egg whites.
In the past, scientists have used
X-rays to analyze the structure of
biological molecules by observing
how a molecule scatters X-ray
beams. With the help of the LCLS,
SLAC led an international team of
researchers to use an imaging
technique called serial femtosec
ond crystallography, which gathers
an image by the emission of ultra
short, ultrabright X-ray laser puls
es lasting one femtosecond (10-15
seconds), to obtain a high-resolu
tion image of the molecule in
question.

The advantage of this high-res
olution technique is that scientists
can now use smaller crystals than
in X-ray refraction analysis and
can gain different insight into mo
lecular dynamics, according to a
SLAC press release.
Researchers said they used
lysozyme as their first research
sample because it is easily crystal
lized. However, the team plans to
use the same technique to image
more-complex proteins in the fu
ture.

This was the first study to use
the Coherent X-Ray Imaging
(CXI) instrument at SLAC. The
CXI device is a type of molecular

camera that can image biological
samples to a point of damage be
yond which other molecular cam
eras cannot produce images.
The results of the experiment
were published in Science,

The international team includ
ed researchers from Max Planck
Institutes, DESY, Arizona State
University, Cornell University,
SUNY Oswego, The Johns Hop
kins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, the Nikhef National
Institute for Subatomic Physics,
the European Synchrotron Radia
tion Facility, the University of
Gothenburg, the University of
Hamburg, the University of
Ltibeck and Uppsala University.
