## HISTORY CORNER Steinbeck at Stanford 
### â€” Taylor Grossman 
In 1925, during the sixth and final
year of John Steinbeck's time as
a Stanford student, the soon-to
be famous author moved off
campus to a one-room shack be
hind a larger house in Palo Alto. The
room was seven square feet and Stein
beck loved it.
"Steinbeck called the shack 'the
Den of Pegasus' after the mythologi
cal flying horse because it symbolized
[his and his writer friends'] soaring
ambitions," said Art Ring, a former
Steinbeck Collector's Club member.
An avid Steinbeck enthusiast, Ring
used to lead tours across the Stanford
campus that detailed Steinbeck's life
at the University.
"Several years later, Steinbeck
changed the symbol to a winged pig,
explaining ... 'I find I'm more a Piga
sus than a Pegasus; a lumbering soul
but trying to fly,"' Ring said. "To
Steinbeck, that summed up the
progress of his career at that point in
his life ... Steinbeck used that symbol
throughout his life. This is the Stein
beck persona."

Steinbeck had a colorful career at
Stanford. In the six years that he was
enrolled at the University, starting in
1919, he only accumulated 93 units
becoming equivalent in status to a
junior.

"He came to Stanford to mollify his
parents, primarily his mother," ex
plained Kevin Hearle 'BO, a visiting
scholar at the Bill Lane Center for the
American West. "He wasn't excited
about it. He didn't see why he needed
a college education to be a writer."
Steinbeck had no intention of grad
uating, according to Ring. Instead, the
future Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-win
ning author took a collection of cours
es that he thought would help him
hone his craft as a writer. His grades
were far from stellar, and he often
withdrew from classes before the final
if he found them uninteresting.
Despite his varied college career,
he did meet two English professors
who he came to respect greatly.
Margery Bailey 'l4 M.A. 'l6 and
Edith Mirrielees 'O7 would have a
formative impact on Steinbeck's
writing.

Mirrielees taught a class on the
short story, a form of literature in
which Steinbeck would become a her
alded voice.
"Edith Mirrielees was the first to
spot Steinbeck's talent," Ring said.
"She restored his ego, and gently and
quietly would fire him with hope."
