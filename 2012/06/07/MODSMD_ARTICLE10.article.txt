## HISTORY CORNER Steinbeck at Stanford 
### â€” Taylor Grossman 
In 1925, during the sixth and final
year of John Steinbeck's time as
a Stanford student, the soon-to
be famous author moved off
campus to a one-room shack be
hind a larger house in Palo Alto. The
room was seven square feet and Stein
beck loved it.
"Steinbeck called the shack 'the
Den of Pegasus' after the mythologi
cal flying horse because it symbolized
[his and his writer friends'] soaring
ambitions," said Art Ring, a former
Steinbeck Collector's Club member.
An avid Steinbeck enthusiast, Ring
used to lead tours across the Stanford
campus that detailed Steinbeck's life
at the University.
"Several years later, Steinbeck
changed the symbol to a winged pig,
explaining ... 'I find I'm more a Piga
sus than a Pegasus; a lumbering soul
but trying to fly,"' Ring said. "To
Steinbeck, that summed up the
progress of his career at that point in
his life ... Steinbeck used that symbol
throughout his life. This is the Stein
beck persona."

Steinbeck had a colorful career at
Stanford. In the six years that he was
enrolled at the University, starting in
1919, he only accumulated 93 units
becoming equivalent in status to a
junior.

"He came to Stanford to mollify his
parents, primarily his mother," ex
plained Kevin Hearle 'BO, a visiting
scholar at the Bill Lane Center for the
American West. "He wasn't excited
about it. He didn't see why he needed
a college education to be a writer."
Steinbeck had no intention of grad
uating, according to Ring. Instead, the
future Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-win
ning author took a collection of cours
es that he thought would help him
hone his craft as a writer. His grades
were far from stellar, and he often
withdrew from classes before the final
if he found them uninteresting.
Despite his varied college career,
he did meet two English professors
who he came to respect greatly.
Margery Bailey 'l4 M.A. 'l6 and
Edith Mirrielees 'O7 would have a
formative impact on Steinbeck's
writing.

Mirrielees taught a class on the
short story, a form of literature in
which Steinbeck would become a her
alded voice.
"Edith Mirrielees was the first to
spot Steinbeck's talent," Ring said.
"She restored his ego, and gently and
quietly would fire him with hope."
"In terms of his actual educa
tion and what he got out of it... at
first he probably didn't get much,"
Hearle said. "But he eventually
found a group of fairly like-minded
guys who were interested in writing
and who knew that they wanted to
be writers.
"Some of his best friends over
the years people he kept in
touch with his entire life were
Stanford guys," he added.

One such man was Carlton
Sheffield '23 M.A. '3O, affectionate
ly known to Steinbeck as Dook.
Dook would become Steinbeck's
lifelong companion until the latter's
death in 1968. Along with filling the
role of best man at Steinbeck's wed
ding to first wife Carol Henning,
Dook also once saved Steinbeck's
life during a camping trip.
Another was Ed Ricketts, a man
who would later be immortalized
as "Doc" in Cannery Row. Rickets
and Steinbeck later wrote "The
Log from the Sea of Cortez," a de
scription of their trip to the Gulf of
California.

Steinbeck met Ricketts at the
Hopkins Marine Station, Stan
ford's marine laboratory, during a
summer session.

According to Hearle, Stein
beck's time at the station in Pacific
Grove was pivotal to his work as an
author and granted him as aware
ness of biological and ecological
systems.

"He wound up becoming prob
ably the most scientifically, espe
cially biologically trained major
American novelist of his time,"
Hearle noted. "The Hopkins Ma

rine Lab also gave Steinbeck an
ecological perspective."
"Almost all of his works begin
with looking first at the setting, at
the environment... because of his
notion that people are part of an
environment," he added. "That as
pect of humans as animals and hu
mans as part of an ecosystem is cen
tral to Steinbeck's understanding
of the world."

In 1925, Steinbeck left Stanford
to pursue a writing career in New
York with neither a diploma nor an
intent to return. Although he re
mained close to several teachers
and friends he had met in Pacific
Grove and Palo Alto, he did not
keep up a relationship with the
University.
In a 1964 letter to his good
friend Dook, Steinbeck asked, "Do
you ever go near Stanford? I don't
think I would like to go. It would be
kind of embarrassing because I was
such a lousy student, I suppose.
Anyway, I have no call for the
Groves of Academe."

The Groves of Academe, how
ever, had housed him well in some
regards. In a 1962 letter to Mir
rielees, he wrote about her influ
ence on his writing.
"Although it must be a thousand
years ago that I sat in your class in
story writing at Stanford, I remem
ber the experience very clearly,"
Steinbeck said. "I was bright-eyed
and bushy-brained and prepared to
absorb from you the secret formula
for writing good short stories, even
great short stories. You canceled
this illusion very quickly."
