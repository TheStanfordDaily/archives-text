By his junior year at
Stanford, Ben Rattray
'O2 planned to be
come a banker, earn a
lot of money, then re
tire and enter politics. A double
major in economics and political
science, Rattray was well
equipped for such a career path.
But after returning home for
winter break that year, one of his
brothers revealed that he was
gay and everything changed for
Rattray.
"My brother said the thing
that was most painful when he
was younger wasn't the people
who were explicitly homopho
bic or anti-gay that he saw
around him, but that people
would refuse to stand up and
speak out against it, people like
me," Rattray said. "Frankly, I
was ashamed in a deep way for
the first time in my life,"
Over the following weeks,
Rattray realized that finance
was not his calling. He wanted to

somehow shed light on stories of
social injustice and help give a
voice to those who had been vic
timized. Eventually, these ideas
culminated in the launch of
Change.org in 2007.
The website, founded by Rat
tray and a former dormmate,
Mark Dimas 'O2, facilitates the
creation of online social peti
tions to address specific in
stances of social inequity. Peti
tions support a host of different
causes, including gay rights, the
environment, economic and
criminal justice, education and
immigration. Nearly 15,000 peti
tions are started each month on
the site a number that contin
ues to grow.

"My concern was that there
was a disconnect between gener
al interest in taking action and
the specific, practical ways to do
so effectively," Rattray said.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Rattray received a master's
degree from the London School
