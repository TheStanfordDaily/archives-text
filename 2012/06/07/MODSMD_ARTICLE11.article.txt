# CLICK FOR CHANGE
## BEN RATTRAY '02 founder of Change. org, discusses his popular social justice site 
### STEPHEN COBBE 
By his junior year at
Stanford, Ben Rattray
'O2 planned to be
come a banker, earn a
lot of money, then re
tire and enter politics. A double
major in economics and political
science, Rattray was well
equipped for such a career path.
But after returning home for
winter break that year, one of his
brothers revealed that he was
gay and everything changed for
Rattray.
"My brother said the thing
that was most painful when he
was younger wasn't the people
who were explicitly homopho
bic or anti-gay that he saw
around him, but that people
would refuse to stand up and
speak out against it, people like
me," Rattray said. "Frankly, I
was ashamed in a deep way for
the first time in my life,"
Over the following weeks,
Rattray realized that finance
was not his calling. He wanted to

somehow shed light on stories of
social injustice and help give a
voice to those who had been vic
timized. Eventually, these ideas
culminated in the launch of
Change.org in 2007.
The website, founded by Rat
tray and a former dormmate,
Mark Dimas 'O2, facilitates the
creation of online social peti
tions to address specific in
stances of social inequity. Peti
tions support a host of different
causes, including gay rights, the
environment, economic and
criminal justice, education and
immigration. Nearly 15,000 peti
tions are started each month on
the site a number that contin
ues to grow.

"My concern was that there
was a disconnect between gener
al interest in taking action and
the specific, practical ways to do
so effectively," Rattray said.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Rattray received a master's
degree from the London School

creation of online social petitions to address specific instances of social
inequity, in 2007 with former dormmate Mark Dimas '02.
of Economics (LSE), where he
weighed how best he could turn
his ideas on social change into ac
tion. He then traveled to Wash
ington, D.C., to work as a political
consultant, and later as co
founder of GFS, a social entrepre
neurship venture that provides
software to help nonprofits auto
mate the federal grant application
process.

During his time in Washington,
Rattray experienced firsthand
"how power works" and the many
barriers to galvanizing nation
wide change through the existing
political framework. But when he
learned of a new website called
TheFacebook (later Facebook),
he recognized the incredible po
tential for connecting large
groups of people with the Inter
net. While Mark Zuckerberg's
website centered on sharing pho
tos and friends, Rattray wanted a
website that would unite people
based on mutual grievances.
Change.org began as a social
networking website designed for
people with a common interest in
bringing about social change. It
shifted focus after Rattray wit
nessed the power of the online pe
tition in late 2010, when a South
African woman named Ndumie
Funda used Change.org to start a
petition to end the "corrective
rape" of lesbians. The petition,
which was launched from an In
ternet cafe in Cape Town, gath
ered over 171,000 signatures from
175 countries. In response, the
South African government
formed a special team to tackle
the problem.
Domestically, Change.org at
tempts to circumvent the political
process of lawmaking and debate
by focusing its attention only on
specific instances of a broader
issue.

"Right now, it's legal in 29
states to fire someone for being
gay. Because of that, there are lots
of people fighting this national
battle for equality around a bill
called the Employment Nondis
crimination Act but it won't
pass in Congress," Rattray said.

"But if you look at the way that
the issue manifests itself in local
communities, it's not as divisive."

A year and a half ago, Seth
Stambaugh, a teacher outside of
Portland, Oreg., was fired for
being gay. In response, angry par
ents and community members
started a Change.org petition
that opposed the firing. Support
ers sent thousands of emails to
the school district and protested
at school board meetings to de
mand Stambaugh's reinstate
ment. Eventually, the school dis
trict rehired the teacher, issued
an apology and passed a lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender
(LGBT) inclusive nondiscrimina
tion policy.

"An individual success like
that spawns dozens and eventual
ly hundreds of other campaigns of
people fighting the firing of gay
Americans in other circum
stances," Rattray said. "This in
turn starts to build overall mo
mentum such that it becomes
more likely that the national issue

will pass in the future because of
this aggregation of victories."

But the most widely felt
Change.org petition came in
March from the parents of
Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-
year-old boy who was shot and
killed by a neighborhood watch
man. The petition, which received
an unprecedented 2.2 million sig
natures, helped bring Travyon's
death to the national spotlight.
Charlotte Hill, communica
tions manager for Change.org, re
membered the atmosphere at the
organization's San Francisco
headquarters while the petition
was going viral.

"As excited as we were to see
the petition from Trayvon's par
ents taking off and gathering sup
port, we all knew that a victory
would only be a victory in a cer
tain sense; this kid had died and
there was no bringing him back,"
Hill said. "But there was also a
feeling of pride in our model that
it could serve Trayvon's parents in
this way, and that it could allow
their story to more easily spread
and resonate with people across
the country."

A number of causes affecting
the Stanford community have
also found a platform in
Change.org. The site hosted a pe
tition to the Israeli government to
free Stanford graduate Fadi
Quran 'lO in February of this
year, and is currently hosting a pe
tition to President Obama to
commute the 36-month jail sen
tence of Missouri businessman
Shakir Hamoodi, father of Sala
hodeen Abdul-Kafi 'l2.

While the majority of success
ful petitions succeed independ
ently of any help from
Change.org, the organization's
staff, which has grown from 20 to
almost 90 in little over a year,
plays a role in fostering the devel
opment of certain petitions by of
fering services like peer-to-peer
support, campaign advising and
media training.
"We look for petitions with an
incredible personal story that ap
peal to a broad swathe of people
and that aren't highly divisive,"
Rattray said.

Another part of the team fo
cuses on developing algorithms to
match petitions with the people
who are most likely to be passion
ate about the cause. Change.org's
emphasis on technological inno
vation is reflected in the many
rows of computers that fill the or
ganization's San Francisco office.
In fact, Rattray said that without
the team's chief technology offi
cer, Dimas, the organization
would not have succeeded.
"The most critical element in
the beginning stages of almost
any start-up is having someone
who is extremely technically com
petent," Rattray said. "The only
way we got through all the chal
lenges we faced was Mark
[Dimas] and his willingness to
wake up every day to code at
home for 14 hours in his under
wear, though he says he was

dressed."
Tyler Rattray, Ben's brother
and executive assistant of
Change.org, also made an impor
tant contribution to the organiza
tion in its early stages. As a college
freshman, he loaned his life sav
ings to help keep the organization
afloat in its first year.

Four years later, Change.org is
now profitable and on track to
bring in $lOO million in annual
revenue within three years by
running campaigns for a variety
of organizations such as Amnesty
International.

Tyler joined the Change.org
team after having a lengthy con
versation with his brother about
the direction in which his life was
headed.

"Ben always talked about the
importance of leaving a legacy no
matter what you're doing," he
said. "After our conversation, I re
alized that building a tool that
could give anyone the power to

leave their own legacy was such a
powerful thing and was some
thing that I wanted to be a part
of."

Looking toward the future,
Ben Rattray plans to further ex
pand into the international mar
ket and develop the website's mo
bile interface. Last year, mobile
phone activity accounted for 6
percent of Change.org's total traf
fic. This year, that number rose to
28 percent.

"The future's clearly in the
computer in your pocket so we're
spending a lot of time finding
more effective ways to engage
people through their cell phones

to allow for more responsive and
dynamic types of organizing,"

Rattray said.
When reflecting on his time at
Stanford, Rattray said he believes
that the culture of audacity that
permeates the campus was a key
inspiration for him.
"Instead of making it seem like
a scary thing, Stanford makes
quitting your job, raising money
and disrupting an industry you
have no experience with seem
like the most natural thing in the
world," he said.

process.

During his time in Washington,
Rattray experienced firsthand
"how power works" and the many
barriers to galvanizing nation
wide change through the existing
political framework. But when he
learned of a new website called
TheFacebook (later Facebook),
he recognized the incredible po
tential for connecting large
groups of people with the Inter
net. While Mark Zuckerberg's
website centered on sharing pho
tos and friends, Rattray wanted a
website that would unite people
based on mutual grievances.
Change.org began as a social
networking website designed for
people with a common interest in
bringing about social change. It
shifted focus after Rattray wit
nessed the power of the online pe
tition in late 2010, when a South
African woman named Ndumie
Funda used Change.org to start a
petition to end the "corrective
rape" of lesbians. The petition,
which was launched from an In
ternet cafe in Cape Town, gath
ered over 171,000 signatures from
175 countries. In response, the
South African government
formed a special team to tackle
the problem.
Domestically, Change.org at
tempts to circumvent the political
process of lawmaking and debate
by focusing its attention only on
specific instances of a broader
issue.

"Right now, it's legal in 29
states to fire someone for being
gay. Because of that, there are lots
of people fighting this national
battle for equality around a bill
called the Employment Nondis
crimination Act but it won't
pass in Congress," Rattray said.

"But if you look at the way that
the issue manifests itself in local
communities, it's not as divisive."

A year and a half ago, Seth
Stambaugh, a teacher outside of
Portland, Oreg., was fired for
being gay. In response, angry par
ents and community members
started a Change.org petition
that opposed the firing. Support
ers sent thousands of emails to
the school district and protested
at school board meetings to de
mand Stambaugh's reinstate
ment. Eventually, the school dis
trict rehired the teacher, issued
an apology and passed a lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender
(LGBT) inclusive nondiscrimina
tion policy.

"An individual success like
that spawns dozens and eventual
ly hundreds of other campaigns of
people fighting the firing of gay
Americans in other circum
stances," Rattray said. "This in
turn starts to build overall mo
mentum such that it becomes
more likely that the national issue

will pass in the future because of
this aggregation of victories."

But the most widely felt
Change.org petition came in
March from the parents of
Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-
year-old boy who was shot and
killed by a neighborhood watch
man. The petition, which received
an unprecedented 2.2 million sig
natures, helped bring Travyon's
death to the national spotlight.
Charlotte Hill, communica
tions manager for Change.org, re
membered the atmosphere at the
organization's San Francisco
headquarters while the petition
was going viral.

"As excited as we were to see
the petition from Trayvon's par
ents taking off and gathering sup
port, we all knew that a victory
would only be a victory in a cer
tain sense; this kid had died and
there was no bringing him back,"
Hill said. "But there was also a
feeling of pride in our model that
it could serve Trayvon's parents in
this way, and that it could allow
their story to more easily spread
and resonate with people across
the country."

A number of causes affecting
the Stanford community have
also found a platform in
Change.org. The site hosted a pe
tition to the Israeli government to
free Stanford graduate Fadi
Quran 'lO in February of this
year, and is currently hosting a pe
tition to President Obama to
commute the 36-month jail sen
tence of Missouri businessman
Shakir Hamoodi, father of Sala
hodeen Abdul-Kafi 'l2.

While the majority of success
ful petitions succeed independ
ently of any help from
Change.org, the organization's
staff, which has grown from 20 to
almost 90 in little over a year,
plays a role in fostering the devel
opment of certain petitions by of
fering services like peer-to-peer
support, campaign advising and
media training.
"We look for petitions with an
incredible personal story that ap
peal to a broad swathe of people
and that aren't highly divisive,"
Rattray said.

Another part of the team fo
cuses on developing algorithms to
match petitions with the people
who are most likely to be passion
ate about the cause. Change.org's
emphasis on technological inno
vation is reflected in the many
rows of computers that fill the or
ganization's San Francisco office.
In fact, Rattray said that without
the team's chief technology offi
cer, Dimas, the organization
would not have succeeded.
"The most critical element in
the beginning stages of almost
any start-up is having someone
who is extremely technically com
petent," Rattray said. "The only
way we got through all the chal
lenges we faced was Mark
[Dimas] and his willingness to
wake up every day to code at
home for 14 hours in his under
wear, though he says he was

dressed."
Tyler Rattray, Ben's brother
and executive assistant of
Change.org, also made an impor
tant contribution to the organiza
tion in its early stages. As a college
freshman, he loaned his life sav
ings to help keep the organization
afloat in its first year.

Four years later, Change.org is
now profitable and on track to
bring in $lOO million in annual
revenue within three years by
running campaigns for a variety
of organizations such as Amnesty
International.

Tyler joined the Change.org
team after having a lengthy con
versation with his brother about
the direction in which his life was
headed.

"Ben always talked about the
importance of leaving a legacy no
matter what you're doing," he
said. "After our conversation, I re
alized that building a tool that
could give anyone the power to

leave their own legacy was such a
powerful thing and was some
thing that I wanted to be a part
of."

Looking toward the future,
Ben Rattray plans to further ex
pand into the international mar
ket and develop the website's mo
bile interface. Last year, mobile
phone activity accounted for 6
percent of Change.org's total traf
fic. This year, that number rose to
28 percent.

"The future's clearly in the
computer in your pocket so we're
spending a lot of time finding
more effective ways to engage
people through their cell phones

to allow for more responsive and
dynamic types of organizing,"

Rattray said.
When reflecting on his time at
Stanford, Rattray said he believes
that the culture of audacity that
permeates the campus was a key
inspiration for him.
"Instead of making it seem like
a scary thing, Stanford makes
quitting your job, raising money
and disrupting an industry you
have no experience with seem
like the most natural thing in the
world," he said.

By his junior year at
Stanford, Ben Rattray
'O2 planned to be
come a banker, earn a
lot of money, then re
tire and enter politics. A double
major in economics and political
science, Rattray was well
equipped for such a career path.
But after returning home for
winter break that year, one of his
brothers revealed that he was
gay and everything changed for
Rattray.
"My brother said the thing
that was most painful when he
was younger wasn't the people
who were explicitly homopho
bic or anti-gay that he saw
around him, but that people
would refuse to stand up and
speak out against it, people like
me," Rattray said. "Frankly, I
was ashamed in a deep way for
the first time in my life,"
Over the following weeks,
Rattray realized that finance
was not his calling. He wanted to

somehow shed light on stories of
social injustice and help give a
voice to those who had been vic
timized. Eventually, these ideas
culminated in the launch of
Change.org in 2007.
The website, founded by Rat
tray and a former dormmate,
Mark Dimas 'O2, facilitates the
creation of online social peti
tions to address specific in
stances of social inequity. Peti
tions support a host of different
causes, including gay rights, the
environment, economic and
criminal justice, education and
immigration. Nearly 15,000 peti
tions are started each month on
the site a number that contin
ues to grow.

"My concern was that there
was a disconnect between gener
al interest in taking action and
the specific, practical ways to do
so effectively," Rattray said.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Rattray received a master's
degree from the London School

turn starts to build overall mo
mentum such that it becomes
more likely that the national issue

will pass in the future because of
this aggregation of victories."

But the most widely felt
Change.org petition came in
March from the parents of
Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-
year-old boy who was shot and
killed by a neighborhood watch
man. The petition, which received
an unprecedented 2.2 million sig
natures, helped bring Travyon's
death to the national spotlight.
Charlotte Hill, communica
tions manager for Change.org, re
membered the atmosphere at the
organization's San Francisco
headquarters while the petition
was going viral.

"As excited as we were to see
the petition from Trayvon's par
ents taking off and gathering sup
port, we all knew that a victory
would only be a victory in a cer
tain sense; this kid had died and
there was no bringing him back,"
Hill said. "But there was also a
feeling of pride in our model that
it could serve Trayvon's parents in
this way, and that it could allow
their story to more easily spread
and resonate with people across
the country."

A number of causes affecting
the Stanford community have
also found a platform in
Change.org. The site hosted a pe
tition to the Israeli government to
free Stanford graduate Fadi
Quran 'lO in February of this
year, and is currently hosting a pe
tition to President Obama to
commute the 36-month jail sen
tence of Missouri businessman
Shakir Hamoodi, father of Sala
hodeen Abdul-Kafi 'l2.

While the majority of success
ful petitions succeed independ
ently of any help from
Change.org, the organization's
staff, which has grown from 20 to
almost 90 in little over a year,
plays a role in fostering the devel
opment of certain petitions by of
fering services like peer-to-peer
support, campaign advising and
media training.
"We look for petitions with an
incredible personal story that ap
peal to a broad swathe of people
and that aren't highly divisive,"
Rattray said.

Another part of the team fo
cuses on developing algorithms to
match petitions with the people
who are most likely to be passion
ate about the cause. Change.org's
emphasis on technological inno
vation is reflected in the many
rows of computers that fill the or
ganization's San Francisco office.
In fact, Rattray said that without
the team's chief technology offi
cer, Dimas, the organization
would not have succeeded.
"The most critical element in
the beginning stages of almost
any start-up is having someone
who is extremely technically com
petent," Rattray said. "The only
way we got through all the chal
lenges we faced was Mark
[Dimas] and his willingness to
wake up every day to code at
home for 14 hours in his under
wear, though he says he was

dressed."
Tyler Rattray, Ben's brother
and executive assistant of
Change.org, also made an impor
tant contribution to the organiza
tion in its early stages. As a college
freshman, he loaned his life sav
ings to help keep the organization
afloat in its first year.

Four years later, Change.org is
now profitable and on track to
bring in $lOO million in annual
revenue within three years by
running campaigns for a variety
of organizations such as Amnesty
International.

Tyler joined the Change.org
team after having a lengthy con
versation with his brother about
the direction in which his life was
headed.

"Ben always talked about the
importance of leaving a legacy no
matter what you're doing," he
said. "After our conversation, I re
alized that building a tool that
could give anyone the power to

leave their own legacy was such a
powerful thing and was some
thing that I wanted to be a part
of."

Looking toward the future,
Ben Rattray plans to further ex
pand into the international mar
ket and develop the website's mo
bile interface. Last year, mobile
phone activity accounted for 6
percent of Change.org's total traf
fic. This year, that number rose to
28 percent.

"The future's clearly in the
computer in your pocket so we're
spending a lot of time finding
more effective ways to engage
people through their cell phones

to allow for more responsive and
dynamic types of organizing,"

Rattray said.
When reflecting on his time at
Stanford, Rattray said he believes
that the culture of audacity that
permeates the campus was a key
inspiration for him.
"Instead of making it seem like
a scary thing, Stanford makes
quitting your job, raising money
and disrupting an industry you
have no experience with seem
like the most natural thing in the
world," he said.

By his junior year at
Stanford, Ben Rattray
'O2 planned to be
come a banker, earn a
lot of money, then re
tire and enter politics. A double
major in economics and political
science, Rattray was well
equipped for such a career path.
But after returning home for
winter break that year, one of his
brothers revealed that he was
gay and everything changed for
Rattray.
"My brother said the thing
that was most painful when he
was younger wasn't the people
who were explicitly homopho
bic or anti-gay that he saw
around him, but that people
would refuse to stand up and
speak out against it, people like
me," Rattray said. "Frankly, I
was ashamed in a deep way for
the first time in my life,"
Over the following weeks,
Rattray realized that finance
was not his calling. He wanted to

somehow shed light on stories of
social injustice and help give a
voice to those who had been vic
timized. Eventually, these ideas
culminated in the launch of
Change.org in 2007.
The website, founded by Rat
tray and a former dormmate,
Mark Dimas 'O2, facilitates the
creation of online social peti
tions to address specific in
stances of social inequity. Peti
tions support a host of different
causes, including gay rights, the
environment, economic and
criminal justice, education and
immigration. Nearly 15,000 peti
tions are started each month on
the site a number that contin
ues to grow.

"My concern was that there
was a disconnect between gener
al interest in taking action and
the specific, practical ways to do
so effectively," Rattray said.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Rattray received a master's
degree from the London School

Ben Rattray '02 founded Change.org, a website that facilities the
creation of online social petitions to address specific instances of social
inequity, in 2007 with former dormmate Mark Dimas '02.
of Economics (LSE), where he
weighed how best he could turn
his ideas on social change into ac
tion. He then traveled to Wash
ington, D.C., to work as a political
consultant, and later as co
founder of GFS, a social entrepre
neurship venture that provides
software to help nonprofits auto
mate the federal grant application
process.

During his time in Washington,
Rattray experienced firsthand
"how power works" and the many
barriers to galvanizing nation
wide change through the existing
political framework. But when he
learned of a new website called
TheFacebook (later Facebook),
he recognized the incredible po
tential for connecting large
groups of people with the Inter
net. While Mark Zuckerberg's
website centered on sharing pho
tos and friends, Rattray wanted a
website that would unite people
based on mutual grievances.
Change.org began as a social
networking website designed for
people with a common interest in
bringing about social change. It
shifted focus after Rattray wit
nessed the power of the online pe
tition in late 2010, when a South
African woman named Ndumie
Funda used Change.org to start a
petition to end the "corrective
rape" of lesbians. The petition,
which was launched from an In
ternet cafe in Cape Town, gath
ered over 171,000 signatures from
175 countries. In response, the
South African government
formed a special team to tackle
the problem.
Domestically, Change.org at
tempts to circumvent the political
process of lawmaking and debate
by focusing its attention only on
specific instances of a broader
issue.

"Right now, it's legal in 29
states to fire someone for being
gay. Because of that, there are lots
of people fighting this national
battle for equality around a bill
called the Employment Nondis
crimination Act but it won't
pass in Congress," Rattray said.

"But if you look at the way that
the issue manifests itself in local
communities, it's not as divisive."

A year and a half ago, Seth
Stambaugh, a teacher outside of
Portland, Oreg., was fired for
being gay. In response, angry par
ents and community members
started a Change.org petition
that opposed the firing. Support
ers sent thousands of emails to
the school district and protested
at school board meetings to de
mand Stambaugh's reinstate
ment. Eventually, the school dis
trict rehired the teacher, issued
an apology and passed a lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender
(LGBT) inclusive nondiscrimina
tion policy.

"An individual success like
that spawns dozens and eventual
ly hundreds of other campaigns of
people fighting the firing of gay
Americans in other circum
stances," Rattray said. "This in
turn starts to build overall mo
mentum such that it becomes
more likely that the national issue

will pass in the future because of
this aggregation of victories."
