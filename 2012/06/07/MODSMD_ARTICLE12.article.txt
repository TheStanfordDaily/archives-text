## Co-founders of the Stanford Flipside reminisce about stunts, jokes and trickery

"World's Best Minds Gather at Exotic
Erotic."
"Student's Poor Midterm Grade Actual
ly Causes Apocalypse."
"Report: Stanford Student Too Busy To

Breathe."
"Center for Coming Up With Fancy
Names for Silly Things Announces New
Global Peace Summit for Prosperity and
Change."
These headlines come from none other
than the Stanford Flipside, a weekly satirical
news publication that combines pop culture,
social and political commentary and cam
pus-centered humor to entertain students.
Known for being one of the more unique
and quirky campus publications, the Flipside
also contains popular puzzles students typi
cally solve upon picking up the pamphlet in
the dining hall.
It all started more than four years ago,
when Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 and his high
school friends created a publication similar
to the Flipside at their high school. The Flip
side is still published at Deerfield High
School and Northwestern University.
"A few of my friends were really into The
Onion and satirical writing," Keeshin said. "I
brought it here to Stanford, doing it with

some
of the guys in my freshman dorm."
At Stanford, the Flipside started out as a
club, with a newspaper format and multiple
pages. Keeshin realized that this was not the
best format for easy consumption and adapt
ed the Flipside into a short, weekly format,
which increased readability, offered more
visibility and allowed for wider distribution.
"The distribution process has been pretty
much the same since the beginning," said
Zach Galant 'l2, Flipside co-founder. "We'd
say 'Let's go to dinner at Wilbur!' and we'd
eat dinner there and distribute it there and
the next night we'd be at Stern and we'd dis
tribute it there. It started out with just us dis
tributing it and we got some friends to do it
but it was pretty tough initially."
Even in the early years of the Flipside, the
growing readership met the distribution
with a mixture of excitement and anticipa
tion.
"It'd be like 'lt's the Flipside
guy!'" Galant said. "People come
to expect it on Mondays and if
there was a holiday and we distrib
uted on Tuesday, people would be
like 'Where were you yesterday?"

Distribution was difficult at first
because just Galant and Keeshin
were handing out copies, with
hopes to cover the entire campus.
Galant recalled bringing copies to
IHUM lecture and putting them
next to the lecture handouts.

"People would just come by
and take the Flipside along with
the handouts and I always thought
it was really cool seeing people
read it in lecture," Galant said.
As the Flipside grew, so did its
structure. The staff began having
weekly brainstorm and editorial
board meetings and added a "D-
Day" the group's name for
Distribution Day, on which the
Flipside staff walks around cam
pus, distributing copies of the Flip
side to various dining halls. They
also experimented with different
collaborative websites in hopes of
finding new ways to plan, struc
ture and organize the newspaper.
"We still have the same prob
lem that a lot of groups have of
keeping people involved, but it's
gotten easier," Keeshin said.
"We've started doing group
writes," Galant said. "We'd have a
Google Doc and a bunch of peo
ple would be working on an article
at the same time, building off of
each other. It made the process so
much better, getting a chance to
work with other people."
Along with articles and head
lines, the Flipside features weekly
cryptograms and Rebus puzzles.
"People get really excited
about the puzzles," Keeshin
added. "My main goal is to have
people read the articles but if
they're reading it for the puzzles,
then I think they'll also read it for
the articles."

"My favorite part is definitely
the cryptograms," said Katherine
Scavo 'l5. "One of my friends in
the dorm and I really like figuring
out the quotes and decoding
them."

The Flipside staff has added
more outside activities to the Flip
side over the years, including a

fake activities fair in White Plaza
during winter quarter to increase
campus awareness of the Flipside
and give the staff a chance to ac
tively satirize pop culture and
campus culture, instead of just
writing about it.

"I was the President of the Re
sume Building Club," Galant said.
"I wore a suit and had resume
looking flyers and handed them
out, asking students if they wanted
to join the Resume Building Club.
Jeremy was running the Stanford
7th Man Club, which was fans of
Stanford basketball fans, and
Dean Julie walked by and she
signed up for the Breakfast Club."

Another booth featured "the
TSA frat" Tau Sigma Alpha, a
play on the Transportation Securi
ty Administration and airport se
curity measures.

"They were wearing tanks that
said 'Frat Me Down' and had little

water bottles that you'd have to
chug because you can't bring them
on and they'd pat you down,"
Keeshin said.
The fair also included booths
devoted to the Gospel of Tim
Tebow and the Mile High Club.
"We blasted the mailing list
right before the fair with claims
that people knew were fake,"
Keeshin said. "But it got people
out to White Plaza [to come look
at our booths]."
While the articles in the Flip
side are written for the sake of
poking fun at relevant campus or
contemporary issues, some have
been offended by its content.

"We wrote an article once ti
tled 'Stanford Cutting Mechanical
Engineering It's Just Not
Working,"' Keeshin said. "Some
people thought it was a real article
and got upset."

"We also had a White Male

Community Center booth at the
activities fair and this girl just start
ing railing on us," Galant said,
laughing. "The guys stayed in char
acter though, saying they were
going to go to a Third Eye Blind
concert and shop at Trader Joe's."
According to Galant, the Flip
side has also had a lot of positive
responses from students, such as
people "screaming with joy"
whenever they walk into dining
halls carrying the stacks of copies
or getting excited about the "Flip
side guy!"

"We've have also had a lot of
success online," Galant added.
"The first article we had that real
ly went viral online was one called
"The Party Starts Before Kesha
walks in." It was right when 'Tik
Tok' was really popular and it got
more Facebook shares than any
other articles we'd had. It got post
ed to someone's Tumblr and got

600 reblogs."
"I think [the Flipside] is a real
ly good voice that a lot of people
can relate to but don't necessarily
have the venue to express it," said
Carlo Pasco 'l3.

As both founders will graduate
this spring, they bid their Flipside
creation a doleful farewell. Galant
and Keeshin plan to work together
on a start-up called CodeHS, which
will involve teaching computer sci
ence to high school students.
According to Keeshin, the fu
ture of the Flipside next year looks
promising.

"We have a really high bar for
quality for the Flipside and I hope
that the quality remains high," he
said. "I have one goal for the Flip
side and that is to be entertaining for
five or 10 minutes every Monday."
