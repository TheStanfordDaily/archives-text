"World's Best Minds Gather at Exotic

"Student's Poor Midterm Grade Actual

"Report: Stanford Student Too Busy To

Breathe."
"Center for Coming Up With Fancy
Names for Silly Things Announces New
Global Peace Summit for Prosperity and
Change."
These headlines come from none other
than the Stanford Flipside, a weekly satirical
news publication that combines pop culture,
social and political commentary and cam
pus-centered humor to entertain students.
Known for being one of the more unique
and quirky campus publications, the Flipside
also contains popular puzzles students typi
cally solve upon picking up the pamphlet in
the dining hall.
It all started more than four years ago,
when Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 and his high
school friends created a publication similar
to the Flipside at their high school. The Flip
side is still published at Deerfield High
School and Northwestern University.
"A few of my friends were really into The
Onion and satirical writing," Keeshin said. "I
brought it here to Stanford, doing it with

some
of the guys in my freshman dorm."
At Stanford, the Flipside started out as a
club, with a newspaper format and multiple
pages. Keeshin realized that this was not the
best format for easy consumption and adapt
ed the Flipside into a short, weekly format,
which increased readability, offered more
visibility and allowed for wider distribution.
"The distribution process has been pretty
much the same since the beginning," said
Zach Galant 'l2, Flipside co-founder. "We'd
say 'Let's go to dinner at Wilbur!' and we'd
eat dinner there and distribute it there and
the next night we'd be at Stern and we'd dis
tribute it there. It started out with just us dis
tributing it and we got some friends to do it
but it was pretty tough initially."
Even in the early years of the Flipside, the
growing readership met the distribution
with a mixture of excitement and anticipa
tion.
