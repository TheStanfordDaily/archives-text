# Growing up in college

Dashing from room to room in
Serra, in striped bathing suits
and with plastic water pistols
dangerously set in their palms,
six-year-old twins Aisling and
Sabha may be a surprising sight to most stu
dents who are accustomed to seeing a gener
al population over the age of 18. But for the
Serra freshmen, the formidable pint-sized
duo is part of the dorm community.
"For freshmen this is their first year away
from home," said Susan O'Hara, Serra resi
dent fellow (RF) and the twins' mother. "A
lot of them have younger brothers and sis
ters, so it triggers those automatic nurturing
kind of things."
Growing up on campus as a child is a
unique experience, with perhaps some pit
falls. How can six-year-olds fit into the col
lege world, a world of individuals on the cusp
of entering the workforce? According to
O 'Hara, the advantages of raising a family on
campus are what bring many RFs to the po
sition.

"Actually, one of the reasons we did it was
because of what we'd heard about, from
other RFs, about their kids," O'Hara said.
In fact, the children of RFs may gain an in
tellectual experience to which few of their
school peers have access, perhaps accelerat
ing their precociousness.
"They grow up having this very rich expe
rience of college life," said Marie-Louise Cat
salis, RF at Toyon and mother of two boys,
four-year-old Tobin and seven-year-old Kai.
"Just from being around college students, I
hear their vocabulary expanding, and they
use words and concepts that college students
are thinking about. Like, 'Oh, what will I do

next with my career?"'
A shifting vocabulary is a change noted
by the Serra RFs as well.
"They'll say,' What's up, dude?"' said Stu
art Bennett, O'Hara's husband. "And they'll
call me 'Stu.' They don't call me Daddy.
Everybody calls me 'Stu,' so they do, too ...

it's kind of funny because they're six years
old and they talk like they're eighteen."
To some students, the children take on a
younger sibling role. This, however, causes
some awkwardness for older RF kids. An
drea and Federico Clerici-Hermandinger,
who grew up in Cedro, found that as they

grew older these interactions became fewer
and fewer.

"I feel like we [hung out with students]
when we were younger," said Andrea, now a
sophomore at Palo Alto High School. "Now
there's such a close age difference it's a little
more awkward."

A high school senior, Federico Clerici-
Hermandinger will be leaving Palo Alto and
heading to Boston College.
"I didn't even think about applying to
Stanford because I've just been on campus
for so long," he said. "But it's still been a good
experience, and it's showed me a lot of what

college is about."
For the younger children, though, Stan
ford is still home. Living on a college campus
establishes a model of college life for the chil
dren, setting Stanford as the norm of what
follows high school.
"So a few months ago Kai started saying,
'I want to go to Stanford'... At the moment,
he likes Stanford; this is the place," Catsalis
said. "But as a seven-year-old, that's all he
knows ... Most teenagers are thinking, As
far away as I can get from my parents.' But at

Aisling and Sabha Bennett, six-year-old twin daughters of Serra Resident Fellows (RF) Susan O'Hara and Stuart Bennett, were caught
eating a chocolate cake in a student's room. The girls are among many RF children who grow up among undergraduates on the Farm.
