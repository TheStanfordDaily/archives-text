## EDITORIAL Dismantling the Stanford summer hierarchy 
### 
As spring quarter progress
es, a familiar refrain is re
peated with increasing
frequency, reaching a fever pitch
as May turns to June. From dining
halls to IHUM sections, students,
faculty, and well-meaning
strangers raise the inevitable
question: "So what are you doing
this summer?" The inquiry itself is
innocuous enough, yet it often car
ries with it implicit assumptions
about what a Stanford student's
summer should entail. Students
who brightly chirp about their
plans for international research,
consulting internships or Silicon
Valley start-up work are met with
approving nods, while students
whose plans are uncertain, or who
plan to go home and find a sum
mer job, may encounter confu
sion, condescending sympathy or
even derision. While the diverse
pursuits undertaken by under
graduates are impressive, the Edi
torial Board advocates a broader
understanding of what summer
undertakings are considered valu
able and important. The current
culture of the Stanford summer is
at best elitist and at worst classist,
and Stanford students may be re
luctant to pursue unconventional
summer paths due to the mentali
ty that the question "So what are
you doing this summer?" consis
tently reinforces.

tal value of the experience or per
spective it can provide, as another
tally toward personal develop
ment. Ask yourselves this: When
was the last time you had a sum
mer that didn't have to "count" for
anything?
The ramifications of this prob
lem extend far beyond the realm
of which students land a coveted
internship and which do not. In
deed, our attitude toward sum
mers strikes at the heart of what is
both extraordinary and stifling
about being at Stanford. Opportu
nities are numerous, but the sea of
possibilities can sometimes drown
out endeavors that don't fit the
prevailing wisdom of what a Stan
ford student should be doing. For
example, the hierarchy of sum
mertime activities may alienate
our peers who work during their
summers to support their families.
Furthermore, the high value
placed on internships often ob
scures the fact that many students
simply cannot afford to accept un
paid positions.
Imagine a Stanford communi
ty in which every impulse to ask
"What are you doing this sum
mer?" was instead replaced by
"What's the most interesting thing
you learned this week?"

We owe it to each other to be
more invested in the current expe
riences of our peers, rather than
placing arbitrary value on sum
mer plans. Summer, besides offer
ing an opportunity for career ad
vancement, is a chance for rejuve
nation, an escape from the pre
dictable schedule of papers and
midterms around which we or
ganize our lives, and in doing so
occasionally forsake or forget our
passions. It also presents an op
portunity to live away from the
norm of instrumentality that is so
often overly present on campus.
The Editorial Board hopes that
each of you finds a space for criti
cal engagement, from urban
boardrooms to rural ranches.
Until the fall, we wish you three
months of discovery and inquiry,
wherever your divergent paths
may lead you.

Students are asked about sum
mer plans as early as January,
when the gauntlet of interviews
and applications begins in earnest.
Summer, a time that was once oc
cupied by recreational pursuits or
creating memories with friends
and family, is now a precious and
pressing opportunity for career
advancement. This, in turn, has a
negative impact on campus men
tal health, as summer plans and
the social pressures that are asso
ciated with them can be enor
mous sources of stress. If a student
accepts an internship or research
position that ultimately proves
dull, will she view the experience
as a summer wasted? Even travel
or volunteer work is often dis
cussed in terms of the instrumen-

as May turns to June. From dining
halls to IHUM sections, students,
faculty, and well-meaning
strangers raise the inevitable
question: "So what are you doing
this summer?" The inquiry itself is
innocuous enough, yet it often car
ries with it implicit assumptions
about what a Stanford student's
summer should entail. Students
who brightly chirp about their
plans for international research,
consulting internships or Silicon
Valley start-up work are met with
approving nods, while students
whose plans are uncertain, or who
plan to go home and find a sum
mer job, may encounter confu
sion, condescending sympathy or
even derision. While the diverse
pursuits undertaken by under
graduates are impressive, the Edi
torial Board advocates a broader
understanding of what summer
undertakings are considered valu
able and important. The current
culture of the Stanford summer is
at best elitist and at worst classist,
and Stanford students may be re
luctant to pursue unconventional
summer paths due to the mentali
ty that the question "So what are
you doing this summer?" consis
tently reinforces.

tal value of the experience or per
spective it can provide, as another
tally toward personal develop
ment. Ask yourselves this: When
was the last time you had a sum
mer that didn't have to "count" for
anything?
The ramifications of this prob
lem extend far beyond the realm
of which students land a coveted
internship and which do not. In
deed, our attitude toward sum
mers strikes at the heart of what is
both extraordinary and stifling
about being at Stanford. Opportu
nities are numerous, but the sea of
possibilities can sometimes drown
out endeavors that don't fit the
prevailing wisdom of what a Stan
ford student should be doing. For
example, the hierarchy of sum
mertime activities may alienate
our peers who work during their
summers to support their families.
Furthermore, the high value
placed on internships often ob
scures the fact that many students
simply cannot afford to accept un
paid positions.
Imagine a Stanford communi
ty in which every impulse to ask
"What are you doing this sum
mer?" was instead replaced by
"What's the most interesting thing
you learned this week?"

We owe it to each other to be
more invested in the current expe
riences of our peers, rather than
placing arbitrary value on sum
mer plans. Summer, besides offer
ing an opportunity for career ad
vancement, is a chance for rejuve
nation, an escape from the pre
dictable schedule of papers and
midterms around which we or
ganize our lives, and in doing so
occasionally forsake or forget our
passions. It also presents an op
portunity to live away from the
norm of instrumentality that is so
often overly present on campus.
The Editorial Board hopes that
each of you finds a space for criti
cal engagement, from urban
boardrooms to rural ranches.
Until the fall, we wish you three
months of discovery and inquiry,
wherever your divergent paths
may lead you.

Students are asked about sum
mer plans as early as January,
when the gauntlet of interviews
and applications begins in earnest.
Summer, a time that was once oc
cupied by recreational pursuits or
creating memories with friends
and family, is now a precious and
pressing opportunity for career
advancement. This, in turn, has a
negative impact on campus men
tal health, as summer plans and
the social pressures that are asso
ciated with them can be enor
mous sources of stress. If a student
accepts an internship or research
position that ultimately proves
dull, will she view the experience
as a summer wasted? Even travel
or volunteer work is often dis
cussed in terms of the instrumen-
