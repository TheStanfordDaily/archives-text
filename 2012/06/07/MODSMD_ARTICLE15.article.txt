## Peace be with you 
### Nina Chung 
The most epic thing I have
ever learned is how similar
people are. Across time and
space, we're the same. We haven't
changed after centuries of civiliza
tional development, revolutions
and scientific movements; we
don't change according to birth
place or method of upbringing.
I'm convinced that our biggest
problems are the eternal ones, like
happiness, loneliness, power and
all of the other one-word bombs
our society can't seem to diffuse.
Everything springs from those.
Our toys may get shinier, but the
human condition does not.

The reason I majored in inter
national relations is that I see this
play out on the global stage. Every
foreign affair can be stripped
down to something remarkably
human. There are big players in
the European Union that break
the rules they enforce on others;
this starts on the school play
ground. North and South Korea
vie for a status with financial ben
efits; this happens in our families.
Our cultures and languages, too,
are just clothes for the same con
cerns. A "pie in the sky" in English
is the "picture of a rice cake" in
Korean. (Isn't that awesome? I
learned that last week.) Parallels
abound.There's a map in my head
of everything I've ever learned,
and everything on it leads right
back to a common human nature.

In away, the Stanford institu
tion supports this, because our
unity is emphasized through our

great diversity. Behind each com
munity center, ethnic theme house
and extracurricular is a purported
celebration of difference, also
printed in every promotional
booklet admitted students re
ceive. Many of us hear more a cap
pella, eat more South American
grains and are exposed to more
kinds of sexual self-identification
here on this campus than we ever
did before we came. As a result,
though, the loudest proclamation
we make to the world is that our
student body has, at least superfi
cially, digested the divides of eth
nicity, socioeconomic status, ideol
ogy, religion and appearance.
Hence, our sensitivity to political
correctness; we expect ourselves
to embody a universal embrace, as
if the idea were attached to our
Stanford degree.
And here my doubt lingers. For
as we tout big victories of accept
ance and toleration, what do we
do every day, privately? We specu
late about friends behind their
backs. We laugh at each others' ex
pense. Rant angrily about others'
achievements. Give people cold
