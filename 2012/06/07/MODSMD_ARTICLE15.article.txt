# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Peace be with you 
### Nina Chung 
The most epic thing I have
ever learned is how similar
people are. Across time and
space, we're the same. We haven't
changed after centuries of civiliza
tional development, revolutions
and scientific movements; we
don't change according to birth
place or method of upbringing.
I'm convinced that our biggest
problems are the eternal ones, like
happiness, loneliness, power and
all of the other one-word bombs
our society can't seem to diffuse.
Everything springs from those.
Our toys may get shinier, but the
human condition does not.

The reason I majored in inter
national relations is that I see this
play out on the global stage. Every
foreign affair can be stripped
down to something remarkably
human. There are big players in
the European Union that break
the rules they enforce on others;
this starts on the school play
ground. North and South Korea
vie for a status with financial ben
efits; this happens in our families.
Our cultures and languages, too,
are just clothes for the same con
cerns. A "pie in the sky" in English
is the "picture of a rice cake" in
Korean. (Isn't that awesome? I
learned that last week.) Parallels
abound.There's a map in my head
of everything I've ever learned,
and everything on it leads right
back to a common human nature.

In away, the Stanford institu
tion supports this, because our
unity is emphasized through our

great diversity. Behind each com
munity center, ethnic theme house
and extracurricular is a purported
celebration of difference, also
printed in every promotional
booklet admitted students re
ceive. Many of us hear more a cap
pella, eat more South American
grains and are exposed to more
kinds of sexual self-identification
here on this campus than we ever
did before we came. As a result,
though, the loudest proclamation
we make to the world is that our
student body has, at least superfi
cially, digested the divides of eth
nicity, socioeconomic status, ideol
ogy, religion and appearance.
Hence, our sensitivity to political
correctness; we expect ourselves
to embody a universal embrace, as
if the idea were attached to our
Stanford degree.
And here my doubt lingers. For
as we tout big victories of accept
ance and toleration, what do we
do every day, privately? We specu
late about friends behind their
backs. We laugh at each others' ex
pense. Rant angrily about others'
achievements. Give people cold

attitudes. Avoid our ex. Want re
venge. We think things like "How
could she say that!?" or "What a
jerk!" or "I could never be like
that." These statements don't start
world wars or mass murders, and
they aren't published in our jour
nals or academic papers. But they
are undoubtedly our cruelties of
choice, misleadingly casual for
how bitter they can become. They
are irrelevant to the humanitari
anism we herald ... right?
In my Italian film class last
week, we watched a biographical
drama about a highly controver
sial political figure. Millicent Mar

cus, an Italian film theorist, de
scribed the film character as pos
sessing the "attitude of detach
ment which licenses the most viru
lent actions at the level of history."
This is exactly the detachment,
however, that us supposedly good
people show through actions
against our own peers. Our own
gossipy statements and jabs of su
periority suggest irrevocable dif
ference. They are predictions that
we could never, in our entire lives,
empathize with the subject of our
criticism. Yet this emotional dis
tance, at its very root, is the same
as every -ism we decry in the
world.

The best example I can give is
my own. I used to very outspoken
ly judge all Christian people as
judgmental hypocrites. (Paradox.)
Then, when I came to faith during

sophomore year, I suddenly un
derstood that the fact was obvious.
I am hypocritical now, as I was
hypocritical then. Being human,
I'm actually implicated in every
crime I denounce in everyone
else. I condemn inconsiderate
mercilessness in history and polit
ical science, and get caught up in it
right after class.

With this in mind, I wish to re
scind a column I wrote last Octo
ber called "The Value of Divi
sion." I wrote it to justify my disre
gard for someone based on differ
ences, and also my condescension.
I now recognize this attitude as
the same one driving most world
wide conflicts. For someone who
believes in the power of small ges
tures and little things, surely I
should be recognizing that my at
titude toward people in my own

life may be yoked with the rest of
the world's.

To accept that someone else
has a heart is to accept that they
want the same basic things and
struggle with the same questions
as you do. It's to accept that they
were, in fact, created as equally as
beautifully as you. It's an ideal we
announce quite loudly on banners
and broadcasts, but means some
thing real only if we pursue it in
our social lives now.

Idealism, buzz words and insti
tutions for world peace aside, let's
be real. I believe in hope for us

an eternal kind. But I believe it's a
personal thing, above all.

I am hypocritical now, as I was
hypocritical then. Being human,
I'm actually implicated in every
crime I denounce in everyone
else. I condemn inconsiderate
mercilessness in history and polit
ical science, and get caught up in it
right after class.

With this in mind, I wish to re
scind a column I wrote last Octo
ber called "The Value of Divi
sion." I wrote it to justify my disre
gard for someone based on differ
ences, and also my condescension.
I now recognize this attitude as
the same one driving most world
wide conflicts. For someone who
believes in the power of small ges
tures and little things, surely I
should be recognizing that my at
titude toward people in my own

life may be yoked with the rest of
the world's.

To accept that someone else
has a heart is to accept that they
want the same basic things and
struggle with the same questions
as you do. It's to accept that they
were, in fact, created as equally as
beautifully as you. It's an ideal we
announce quite loudly on banners
and broadcasts, but means some
thing real only if we pursue it in
our social lives now.

Idealism, buzz words and insti
tutions for world peace aside, let's
be real. I believe in hope for us

an eternal kind. But I believe it's a
personal thing, above all.

Hey readers, Nina thanks you. And
if you haven't yet, you can find her

while longer.
The most epic thing I have
ever learned is how similar
people are. Across time and
space, we're the same. We haven't
changed after centuries of civiliza
tional development, revolutions
and scientific movements; we
don't change according to birth
place or method of upbringing.
I'm convinced that our biggest
problems are the eternal ones, like
happiness, loneliness, power and
all of the other one-word bombs
our society can't seem to diffuse.
Everything springs from those.
Our toys may get shinier, but the
human condition does not.

The reason I majored in inter
national relations is that I see this
play out on the global stage. Every
foreign affair can be stripped
down to something remarkably
human. There are big players in
the European Union that break
the rules they enforce on others;
this starts on the school play
ground. North and South Korea
vie for a status with financial ben
efits; this happens in our families.
Our cultures and languages, too,
are just clothes for the same con
cerns. A "pie in the sky" in English
is the "picture of a rice cake" in
Korean. (Isn't that awesome? I
learned that last week.) Parallels
abound.There's a map in my head
of everything I've ever learned,
and everything on it leads right
back to a common human nature.

In away, the Stanford institu
tion supports this, because our
unity is emphasized through our

great diversity. Behind each com
munity center, ethnic theme house
and extracurricular is a purported
celebration of difference, also
printed in every promotional
booklet admitted students re
ceive. Many of us hear more a cap
pella, eat more South American
grains and are exposed to more
kinds of sexual self-identification
here on this campus than we ever
did before we came. As a result,
though, the loudest proclamation
we make to the world is that our
student body has, at least superfi
cially, digested the divides of eth
nicity, socioeconomic status, ideol
ogy, religion and appearance.
Hence, our sensitivity to political
correctness; we expect ourselves
to embody a universal embrace, as
if the idea were attached to our
Stanford degree.
And here my doubt lingers. For
as we tout big victories of accept
ance and toleration, what do we
do every day, privately? We specu
late about friends behind their
backs. We laugh at each others' ex
pense. Rant angrily about others'
achievements. Give people cold

attitudes. Avoid our ex. Want re
venge. We think things like "How
could she say that!?" or "What a
jerk!" or "I could never be like
that." These statements don't start
world wars or mass murders, and
they aren't published in our jour
nals or academic papers. But they
are undoubtedly our cruelties of
choice, misleadingly casual for
how bitter they can become. They
are irrelevant to the humanitari
anism we herald ... right?
In my Italian film class last
week, we watched a biographical
drama about a highly controver
sial political figure. Millicent Mar

cus, an Italian film theorist, de
scribed the film character as pos
sessing the "attitude of detach
ment which licenses the most viru
lent actions at the level of history."
This is exactly the detachment,
however, that us supposedly good
people show through actions
against our own peers. Our own
gossipy statements and jabs of su
periority suggest irrevocable dif
ference. They are predictions that
we could never, in our entire lives,
empathize with the subject of our
criticism. Yet this emotional dis
tance, at its very root, is the same
as every -ism we decry in the
world.

The best example I can give is
my own. I used to very outspoken
ly judge all Christian people as
judgmental hypocrites. (Paradox.)
Then, when I came to faith during

sophomore year, I suddenly un
derstood that the fact was obvious.
