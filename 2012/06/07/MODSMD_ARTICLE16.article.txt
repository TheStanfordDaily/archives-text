## Keeping out of touch 
### Miriam Marks 
Graduating students, have
you found that all of your
interactions are plagued
by one question? As you remi
nisce about freshman year
dorms, late-night study sessions
and crazy parties, is your mind
overshadowed by one thought?
And do you feel vaguely anxious
because, whenever you interact
with someone, you're busy think
ing just one thing:
"Am I going to keep in touch
with this person after gradua
tion?"

Your parents may have told
you to invest in your future. Well,
now it's time to start investing in
your social future. It's time to
pick the people who will be your
lifelong companions, the people
you can point out to your grand
children as the "friends from col
lege." So look around at all the
people you've met and liked over
the past four (or five or more)
years.

Will you keep in touch with
everyone?
Probably not. Let's be honest:
after graduation, you won't see
some of these people ever again.
They'll go off to other cities,
states and countries. You can try
to keep in touch, but it probably
won't work anyway. In twenty
years, you'll walk by each other at
Trader Joe's, and you'll think,
"Oh, wow, that person looks like
a 45-year-old version of [name of
college acquaintance]!" But is it
your friend? It might be hard to
tell by then. Just in case, you'll
make sure to avoid eye contact.
Fortunately for us, we're grad
uating from college in the Face
book era. Even after graduation
you can continue to follow your
friends' Instagram uploads and
see what they're eating, where
they're shopping and who they're
hanging out with every weekend.
You'll know where they live and
what they look like for many
more years to come, which will
make that casual run-in at the

grocery store a little bit easier to
handle.

As for those friends you also
interact with outside of Face
book, there are ways to actively
keep in touch. Go ahead and
schedule Skype sessions and
phone dates it's a great way to
regularly check in with friends in
those faraway places. Letters?
Sure, you can write those too.
Google+? Some people use it.
Gchat? It's like it was invented
for people who are bored at work.
The thing is that when you
graduate, you'll have to figure
out how to keep communicating
with those friends in faraway
places. They won't be down the
hall, across the street or an incon
venient 10-minute bike ride
away. That's when you'll have to
decide not just whether to keep
in touch but how often to do it.
Would you Skype with someone
every day? Call someone every
hour? Gchat someone every
minute?

But keeping in touch requires
time, and keeping in touch with
more people will take up that
much more time. Especially
when these friends are in other
places, you may realize that
you're spending hours in front of
your computer or on your phone.
Your efforts to catch up with peo
ple cut into your opportunities to
explore a new place, to meet new
people or (if you're in grad
school) to study a lot more.
In one extreme scenario, you
might find that your entire social
life has turned into a never-end
ing cycle of keeping in touch with
people from college. Whether
you're making an effort to stay
connected with a lot of people, or
whether you're keeping up con
stant check-ins with just a few of
them, you're neglecting whatever
else it is that you could be doing
in the present.
Keeping in touch obviously
isn't bad, and you likely won't
find yourself in the situation

above. But it goes to show a larg
er point: you're only 23-ish, and
you're still changing. You have
many new things to see and do
and many new relationships to
make; keeping in touch with a
bunch of your college friends is
allowed to take a backseat.
Those of us who co-termed
this past year have had the luxury
of semi-acclimating to this new
environment. And it's not so bad
to keep a little bit out of touch.
Sometimes it's even fun to run
into those people who you
haven't seen in a while. At that
moment, when you end up chat
ting with some casual acquain
tance at your friend's BBQ, it
won't really matter if you've kept
in touch. Seeing a familiar face
will be fun, and talking to some
one after a few years will give you
a lot more to talk about.

All this is to say, don't worry if
you don't keep in touch with
everyone. You can't. There are
too many people graduating in
your class at Stanford, too many
other people in the world to meet

Will you keep
in touch with
everyone?
Probably not.
