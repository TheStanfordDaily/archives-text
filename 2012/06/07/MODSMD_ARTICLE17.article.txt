# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## What is this place? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
A high school teacher of
mine once observed that if
we truly wish to under
stand the soul of a society, we need
only look at what it builds. Public
architecture, he argued, gives ma
terial form to the abstract values
of the community that construct
ed it.

The peoples of medieval Eu
rope built their cities around im
mense cathedrals their own
humble homes dwarfed by the
house of God, its spires and pinna
cles pointed skyward to redirect
the eyes from the mundanity of
earth to the glories of heaven. The
Romans placed the enormous
Colosseum at the center of their
capital, an edifice of public enter
tainment in the heart of an empire
of "bread and circuses." Nazi Ger
many crushed its population
under the gargantuan weight of
an architecture of militantly
straight lines and implacable
granite immensity, subsuming the
individual man in the great mass
of "Volkisch" oneness.

As I prepare to leave this place
after four years, I cannot help but
wonder if we might locate at least
part of the elusive, hard-to-define
Stanford spirit the spirit the
New Yorker tried to capture this
year, the spirit that animates this
University's innumerable accom
plishments and triumphs, the spir
it that courses through the veins
of every student and alumnus

in our architecture as well.
Perhaps in the ever-flowing
stream of creative destruction
that razes old buildings and erects
bigger and better ones, we could
discern Stanford's dedication to
the intellectual cutting edge, to
the perpetual abandonment of
old ideas in the pursuit of new
knowledge. In the essential same
ness of the Main Quad, un
changed amid the unending up
heaval of the rest of campus, we
might see Stanford's dedication to
the core principles of a liberal ed
ucation given physical form a
recognition that as new technolo
gies change the world, the funda
mental questions of humanity
stay the same.
We have countless gyms for a
community driven by fitness and
appearance; an enormous new
business school to give concrete
form to our restless entrepre
neurialism; community centers
for a diverse student body that
hails from around the world and
from every corner of society,
economy and sexuality.
But some unanswered ques
tions remain. I cannot help but
wonder if our architecture might
symbolize our community's im
perfections as surely as it does our
successes.

There is, for example, no com
munity center, or any dedicated
space at all, for Stanford military
veterans. Might that symbolize a

troubling gap in our commitment
to diversity and inclusion on a
campus where, all too recently,
there were only seven undergrad
uate veterans out of a student
body of some 6,800?
Everywhere we see sandstone,
Spanish mission architecture, red
tiled roofs conformity. As rep
resented by the battle over Chi
Theta Chi this year, are we un
comfortable with true, as opposed
to superficial, human difference,
or deeply alternative notions of
what constitutes a life well lived?
What does it mean that at the
very heart of our thoroughly secu
lar campus lies a church? Is Mem-
Chu simply an paradox, a bizarre
antiquation out of place in and
unsuited for the rigors of an un
comfortable modernity? Or does
it reflect the unacknowledged
presence of an enduring faith in
universal progress, reason, the
fundamental and ineradicable
goodness of man?

Weekend this year, a particularly
