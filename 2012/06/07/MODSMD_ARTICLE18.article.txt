# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## A
						TASTE OF PORTUGAL 
### â€“ Rebecca Amato 
I knew next to nothing about
Portugal when I decided to
travel to Lisbon. My knowledge
of the country only went up to
about the 16th century and the
period of exploration. Even my
mom's insistence on the usefulness of
Spanish for basic conversations with
Romance language speakers did not
help me, and I was unable to have the
Spanish-Portuguese conversations I
believed I would.

Initially, I tried speaking Spanish. I
had signed a Spanish-only pledge for
the quarter and did not want to slip
into English when Spanish was so
similar to Portuguese. The language
barrier proved to be higher than I an
ticipated.
My fellow Stanford in Madrid stu
dents and I tried to order in Spanish.
Our waitress would not have that.
She helped each of us pronounce the
Portuguese words from the menu. We
quickly learned that speaking Span
ish only invited Portuguese lessons,
while English worked and got us
what we wanted the cost of an
item, directions, etc. Attempting Por
tuguese transformed us from travel
ers into friends. It was not long before
"obrigada" and "obrigado" fe
male and male versions of thank you
were added to our regular vocabu
laries.

In Portugal, I learned what pride
the Portuguese have for their lan

guage. More than anywhere else I
have visited, the locals wanted to
teach us. Whether it was a simple
"hello" or "thank you," they wanted
to share. This even rang true in com
mercial places, where employees
would take the time to explain cultur
al nuances, even if sacrificing efficien
cy to do so.
Once I got past the language bar
rier, Lisbon eased my homesickness,
due to its striking similarity to San
Francisco. We wandered through Lis
bon's hilly streets, populated by cable
cars, and stumbled upon a large flea
market. In the distance, a red suspen
sion bridge spanned the wide river.
The fresh coastal air even smelled
like San Francisco!

After nostalgically noting the sim
ilarities, I reminded myself that I was
in a foreign city and took in the city's
individuality. I admired all the ceram
ic tiles lining houses, churches and
fountains. Later I sat on a tiled bench
and sunk my teeth into Lisbon's deli
cacy, not sourdough bread, as is com
monly thought, but rather sweet egg
tart pastries called "paseis de nata."
A taste of Lisbon, a few lessons in
Portuguese and many new experi
ences later, I returned to Madrid with
my group for our last few weeks on
the Iberian Peninsula.
