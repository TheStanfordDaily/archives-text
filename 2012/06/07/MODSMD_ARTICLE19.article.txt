## UAR addresses Three Books selection 
### 
For the first time, Stanford's
Three Books program goes
beyond the book: a docu
mentary film, a suite of smart
phone applications described on a
website that includes articles and
video documentation, as well as a
book. It is hoped that the diversity
of format encourages students to
think about how ideas are ex
pressed differently by the written
word, in filmic presentation,
through music, or by using contem
porary social media.
In light of the opening of the
$ll2 million Bing Concert Hall,
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR) chose to focus
Three Books 2012 on the arts and
chose Professor Mark Applebaum
to select the texts. Professor Ap
plebaum believes the opening of
the concert hall begs the questions:
What is it for? Who gets to use it?
The issue of access that surrounds
the concert hall is deliberately par
alleled in the Three Books selec
tions: what ideas are worthy of our
attention (a book about heavy
metal): which people ought to
make art (a film about a 4-year
old); and who should have access
to tools (a discussion about smart
phone applications).

When the idea to examine
smartphone applications initially
surfaced, we were intrigued by the
possibility and conscientious
about the inclusion of a medium
that, at first glance, may seem divi
sive. We understand the initial re
action the Three Books announce
ment has generated from some in

our community because we share
these concerns. Because equity
and access are among our core val
ues in UAR, we have gone to great
lengths from the outset to make
this an inclusive, deliberate and
thought-provoking program for
all of our incoming students this
fall. In April, Professor Apple
baum met with the Resident Fel
lows (who will lead the dorm dis
cussions following the event) and
shared an extensive study guide.
Elements of this study guide are
presented in a video that will be
released to incoming students in
July. Although these materials
contextualize the program and
selections, the short announce
ment sent to The Daily last month
was instead a press release about
the texts and described neither
the plans for access nor the con
ceptual agenda of the program.
Given that a news brief ("Three
Books inspired by opening of
Bing Concert Hall," May 25) and
an editorial ("Choice for Three
Books disappointing," June 1) re
acted only to the press release,
wed like to elaborate on those is
sues here.

To be perfectly clear: there is
no expectation that students own
or buy a smartphone for this pro
gram. In a few weeks, students
will receive a mailing that in
cludes the book, DVD and a let
ter from Professor Applebaum
introducing them to the program
and a special Smule website set
up by Professor Ge Wang exclu
sively for incoming students.

The website (http://ccrma.stan
ford.edu/~ge/3-books/) provides
video demonstrations of the appli
cations, links to relevant articles
about the culture and meaning of
smartphone applications and ideas
for expanding on uses for this tech
nology. To fully engage in all of the
content offered, students will need
to dedicate several hours (not un
like reading a book). In some re
spects it is this website not the
apps themselves that is the
TTiree Books selection.

We want students to experience
the applications first hand and
have a plan for this. During New
Student Orientation (NSO), resi
dential staff will provide devices
with the apps pre-loaded so stu
dents can explore them in person,
make music with their dormmates
and go on a campus sonic scav
enger hunt together. This will be a
scheduled activity during NSO
not unlike a field trip to a percus
sion studio in which everyone can
use (but need not purchase) an in
strument.

Regardless, it is not the apps
themselves but rather a discussion
of them that offers an opportunity
to explore relevant issues such as
the digital divide, Stanford's Sili
con Valley identity and if Stanford
students should expect entrepre
neurial greatness. It is the content
of Professor Wang's website that,
coupled with the other texts,
evokes the larger questions we are
asking: What is important? Who
gets to decide? Why are things in
cluded or excluded? How are these

questions relevant to a liberal edu
cation ? What is the role of the stu
dent in actively shaping that educa
tion ? There are no right answers to
these questions, but they are good
starting points for the dialogue we
hope to cultivate with students this
fall and throughout their careers at
Stanford. As Professor Apple
baum states in his study guide, "We
hope for a class of open-minded,
joyful skeptics, not sleepwalking
academic sycophants."
Part of that dialogue, we are
certain, will address the Editorial
Board's opinion that the apps
don't offer an "opportunity for in
tellectual engagement." As an aca
demic community, we actively en
courage the expression of differ
ing opinions, and the Board's
questioning of the Three Books
program aligns with our intent.
However, we regret that the
Board did not take the time to first
learn about the logistical infra
structure and conceptual agenda
supporting our selection. We be
lieve, had the Board considered
the goals and care that went into
designing this year's program, it
would share our excitement about
what is sure to be a most thought
ful event. Even though the editori
al failed to tell the full story, it has
succeeded in sparking the very
questions the selections are in
tended to provoke.
