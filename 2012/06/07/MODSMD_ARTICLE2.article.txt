# Bid week prompts ResEd concerns
## Spike in alcohol incidents leads to meeting with Greek leaders 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Residential Education (ResEd)
officials met with leaders in the
Greek community last week to dis
cuss the dozens of alcohol-related in
cidents that occurred during the new
member education period, along
with steps fraternities and sororities
may take to alter the culture of bid
week in the future.

"I'm not naive to think that every
person in the room was holding
hands and singing 'Kumbaya,' but I
feel like most people there were hon
est, and most people were serious
about wanting to address these
things," Dean of ResEd Deborah
Golder said of the meeting.

Alcohol incidents during bid week
On May 17, Associate Dean of
ResEd Nate Boswell sent a letter to
all Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
and Inter-Sorority Council (ISC)
members expressing concern about a
spike in incidents involving the con
sumption and distribution of alcohol
during the recruitment period, citing
"a fundamental disconnect between
Stanford's stated expectations of re
sponsibility around alcohol and the
manner in which your chapters are
regulating your use."

The letter also directed the Greek
organizations on campus that they
must take steps to show that they are
about "far more than drinking" or
risk losing University recognition.
"If our current trajectory contin

ues, it would not be out of the realm
of possibility for the Stanford admin
istration and Board of Trustees to
consider serious changes to the
Greek community on this campus as
we know it," IFC President Ben
Laufer 'l2 wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Sororities were eliminated al
together once before, and it is not in
conceivable that Stanford will once
again reconsider the status of Greeks
here at Stanford."
Boswell's letter listed five areas of
concern: reports that recruits re
turned to freshman residences so
drunk they were vomiting and pass
ing out, reports of medical transports
because of alcohol poisoning, reports

that Greek organizations were
regularly serving alcohol to mi
nors, hazing allegations and re
ports from charter bus companies
that Greek formals were poorly
managed.
Reports came from Resident
Fellows (RFs), Resident Assis
tants (RAs), friends of new Greek
members and members of the
Greek organizations themselves,
Colder said.
"While we want very much to
work in collaboration around
these issues, the trends discussed
will not be tolerated moving for
ward," Boswell wrote in an email
to The Daily.
"I have no interest, and frankly
I don't think Stanford has an in
terest, in having a bunch of drink
ing clubs," Golder said.
The reports concerned both
housed and un-housed IFC and
ISC organizations, but Golder
noted that the time period in
question was separate from the
multicultural organization re
cruitment period.
"While the May 17th letter
may be construed by some as

harsh, given the seriousness of the
situation, I personally felt it was
appropriate," Laufer wrote.
ResEd and Greek community
response
At the meeting, Golder
stressed to Greek leaders that
their organizations tend to get
lumped together in the public eye,
regardless of which organization
is associated with particular inci
dents.
"Even if only half of the al
leged incidents occur, people
don't say it was this organization
or that," Golder said. "The Uni
versity just goes, 'Oh, it's fraterni
ties and sororities.'"
Golder noted that some re
ports from the period in question
have been confirmed while others
have been found not to have oc
curred.
"A lot of what we're trying to
determine is, 'Did something
occur that was egregious?'" Gold
er said. "If it did, what's the appro
priate follow-up that should
occur?"
Some fraternities and sorori
ties have internal judicial
processes that they use to deter
mine accountability for incidents,
a process some of the organiza
tions had already started before
meeting with ResEd, Golder
said. She added that other situa
tions are referred to the Organi
zational Conduct Board (OCB).
Incidents that are referred to the
OCB â€”an organization analo
gous to the Judicial Affairs board,
but for student groups are
University-level policy viola
tions.
In general, incidents involving
public disruption, as well as inci
dents that result in police reports,
end up on the desks of the Uni
versity President, the Provost and
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs, Golder said.
"I think that most of the peo
ple at the table were being really
honest, and I think that the reali
ty is the folks who are in the lead
ership roles in these fraternities
and sororities care about their or
ganizations, they care about the
members of their organizations
and they actually understand and
don't disagree for the most
part with where the Universi
ty is coming from," Golder said.

"They're in the tough position of
trying to get their membership to
understand it as well."

Laufer agreed that open com
munication between the Greek
community and ResEd is impor
tant, but added that sometimes
Res Ed's manner of approaching
a situation leads the Greek com
munity to shut down toward the
administration.

"The best way the IFC collec
tive can react to Res Ed's con
cerns is to remain open and will
ing to self-reflect on the actions
we have made that have resulted
in their concerns," Laufer wrote.
"Defensiveness is not construc
tive. However, I do think that
ResEd should keep in mind that
playing the blame game will lead
to said defensiveness."

This spring's spike in alcohol
related incidents comes in light of
progress on the part of the Greek
community since it came under
Res Ed's purview several years
ago.

"They've been doing really
well all year, frankly, in terms of
concerns around party manage
ment and other things," Colder
said of the Greek community.
"Organizations overall have been
doing really well."
Despite her generally positive
assessment of the year for the
Greek community, Golder said
that there are major areas for con
cern in the drinking culture, par
ticularly because fraternities and
sororities are accorded special
status by the University among
student groups. She said that she
holds housed fraternities and
sororities to particularly high
standards because they "get a
multi-million dollar house" due
to their affiliation as a Greek or
ganization.

"You've got to be better than
everybody else, not worse, be
cause it's a really special thing,"
Golder said. "If you can't do bet
ter, if you're teaching on purpose,
passively or actively, that all you
are is about drinking, then that's
not a theme I'm going to support
from Res Ed."

"We're not going to have the
'get drunk' house as a theme," she
added.

"A lot of what we're trying to
determine is, 'Did something
occur that was egregious?'" Gold
er said. "If it did, what's the appro
priate follow-up that should
occur?"
Some fraternities and sorori
ties have internal judicial
processes that they use to deter
mine accountability for incidents,
a process some of the organiza
tions had already started before
meeting with ResEd, Golder
said. She added that other situa
tions are referred to the Organi
zational Conduct Board (OCB).
Incidents that are referred to the
OCB â€”an organization analo
gous to the Judicial Affairs board,
but for student groups are
University-level policy viola
tions.
In general, incidents involving
public disruption, as well as inci
dents that result in police reports,
end up on the desks of the Uni
versity President, the Provost and
the Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs, Golder said.
"I think that most of the peo
ple at the table were being really
honest, and I think that the reali
ty is the folks who are in the lead
ership roles in these fraternities
and sororities care about their or
ganizations, they care about the
members of their organizations
and they actually understand and
don't disagree for the most
part with where the Universi
ty is coming from," Golder said.

"They're in the tough position of
trying to get their membership to
understand it as well."

Laufer agreed that open com
munication between the Greek
community and ResEd is impor
tant, but added that sometimes
Res Ed's manner of approaching
a situation leads the Greek com
munity to shut down toward the
administration.

"The best way the IFC collec
tive can react to Res Ed's con
cerns is to remain open and will
ing to self-reflect on the actions
we have made that have resulted
in their concerns," Laufer wrote.
"Defensiveness is not construc
tive. However, I do think that
ResEd should keep in mind that
playing the blame game will lead
to said defensiveness."

This spring's spike in alcohol
related incidents comes in light of
progress on the part of the Greek
community since it came under
Res Ed's purview several years
ago.

"They've been doing really
well all year, frankly, in terms of
concerns around party manage
ment and other things," Colder
said of the Greek community.
"Organizations overall have been
doing really well."
Despite her generally positive
assessment of the year for the
Greek community, Golder said
that there are major areas for con
cern in the drinking culture, par
ticularly because fraternities and
sororities are accorded special
status by the University among
student groups. She said that she
holds housed fraternities and
sororities to particularly high
standards because they "get a
multi-million dollar house" due
to their affiliation as a Greek or
ganization.

"You've got to be better than
everybody else, not worse, be
cause it's a really special thing,"
Golder said. "If you can't do bet
ter, if you're teaching on purpose,
passively or actively, that all you
are is about drinking, then that's
not a theme I'm going to support
from Res Ed."

"We're not going to have the
'get drunk' house as a theme," she
added.

Residential Education (ResEd)
officials met with leaders in the
Greek community last week to dis
cuss the dozens of alcohol-related in
cidents that occurred during the new
member education period, along
with steps fraternities and sororities
may take to alter the culture of bid
week in the future.

"I'm not naive to think that every
person in the room was holding
hands and singing 'Kumbaya,' but I
feel like most people there were hon
est, and most people were serious
about wanting to address these
things," Dean of ResEd Deborah
Golder said of the meeting.

Alcohol incidents during bid week
On May 17, Associate Dean of
ResEd Nate Boswell sent a letter to
all Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
and Inter-Sorority Council (ISC)
members expressing concern about a
spike in incidents involving the con
sumption and distribution of alcohol
during the recruitment period, citing
"a fundamental disconnect between
Stanford's stated expectations of re
sponsibility around alcohol and the
manner in which your chapters are
regulating your use."

The letter also directed the Greek
organizations on campus that they
must take steps to show that they are
about "far more than drinking" or
risk losing University recognition.
"If our current trajectory contin

ues, it would not be out of the realm
of possibility for the Stanford admin
istration and Board of Trustees to
consider serious changes to the
Greek community on this campus as
we know it," IFC President Ben
Laufer 'l2 wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Sororities were eliminated al
together once before, and it is not in
conceivable that Stanford will once
again reconsider the status of Greeks
here at Stanford."
Boswell's letter listed five areas of
concern: reports that recruits re
turned to freshman residences so
drunk they were vomiting and pass
ing out, reports of medical transports
because of alcohol poisoning, reports

that Greek organizations were
regularly serving alcohol to mi
nors, hazing allegations and re
ports from charter bus companies
that Greek formals were poorly
managed.
Reports came from Resident
Fellows (RFs), Resident Assis
tants (RAs), friends of new Greek
members and members of the
Greek organizations themselves,
Colder said.
"While we want very much to
work in collaboration around
these issues, the trends discussed
will not be tolerated moving for
ward," Boswell wrote in an email
to The Daily.
"I have no interest, and frankly
I don't think Stanford has an in
terest, in having a bunch of drink
ing clubs," Golder said.
The reports concerned both
housed and un-housed IFC and
ISC organizations, but Golder
noted that the time period in
question was separate from the
multicultural organization re
cruitment period.
"While the May 17th letter
may be construed by some as

harsh, given the seriousness of the
situation, I personally felt it was
appropriate," Laufer wrote.
ResEd and Greek community
response
At the meeting, Golder
stressed to Greek leaders that
their organizations tend to get
lumped together in the public eye,
regardless of which organization
is associated with particular inci
dents.
"Even if only half of the al
leged incidents occur, people
don't say it was this organization
or that," Golder said. "The Uni
versity just goes, 'Oh, it's fraterni
ties and sororities.'"
Golder noted that some re
ports from the period in question
have been confirmed while others
have been found not to have oc
curred.
