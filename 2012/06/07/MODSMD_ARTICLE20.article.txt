## LUCKY SEVEN 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
In the midst of a run to the
Super Regionals of the Col
lege World Series, seven Stan
ford baseball players were se
lected in the MLB's first
year player draft this
f Monday through
Wednesday.
The bevy of
Cardinal athletes en
tering the pro ranks
began on Monday,
t \J when star junior pitcher
Mark Appel was picked
eighth overall by the Pitts
burgh Pirates. Appel, one of
three finalists for the Golden
Spikes Award given annually
to the top player in college
baseball, has compiled a 10-1
record and a 2.27 ERA in 2012.
"I'm currently concentrat
ing on winning a national
championship and finishing

my academic endeavors at
Stanford," Appel told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
Monday, as he will be the Fri
day starter for the Cardinal's
Super Regional matchup with
Florida State. "I will address
the possibility of a professional
career in due time."
With his 6-foot-5, 220-
pound frame and 99-mile-per
hour fastball, many MLB ex
perts and scouts expected
Appel to be selected first over
all by the Houston Astros, who
instead selected 17-year-old
shortstop Carlos Correa with
the first pick. With the unex
pected slide, Appel ended up
being the third righthander
picked in the first eight picks
of the draft, and the third con
secutive righty that the Pirates
have selected with their first
pick in the draft.
In 2011, the Pirates selected
UCLA fireballer Gerrit Cole
