## LUCKY SEVEN 
### JACK BLANCHAT MANAGING EDITOR 
In the midst of a run to the
Super Regionals of the Col
lege World Series, seven Stan
ford baseball players were se
lected in the MLB's first
year player draft this
f Monday through
Wednesday.
The bevy of
Cardinal athletes en
tering the pro ranks
began on Monday,
t \J when star junior pitcher
Mark Appel was picked
eighth overall by the Pitts
burgh Pirates. Appel, one of
three finalists for the Golden
Spikes Award given annually
to the top player in college
baseball, has compiled a 10-1
record and a 2.27 ERA in 2012.
"I'm currently concentrat
ing on winning a national
championship and finishing

my academic endeavors at
Stanford," Appel told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
Monday, as he will be the Fri
day starter for the Cardinal's
Super Regional matchup with
Florida State. "I will address
the possibility of a professional
career in due time."
With his 6-foot-5, 220-
pound frame and 99-mile-per
hour fastball, many MLB ex
perts and scouts expected
Appel to be selected first over
all by the Houston Astros, who
instead selected 17-year-old
shortstop Carlos Correa with
the first pick. With the unex
pected slide, Appel ended up
being the third righthander
picked in the first eight picks
of the draft, and the third con
secutive righty that the Pirates
have selected with their first
pick in the draft.
In 2011, the Pirates selected
UCLA fireballer Gerrit Cole

with the first pick, just one year
after taking high schooler Jame
son Taillon with the second over
all pick. Altogether, the Pirates
look to have compiled a fearsome
young trio of arms that could help
turn around a team that has rou
tinely finished last in its division
over the past two decades.
Appel didn't have to wait long
to have another Cardinal join him
in the big leagues, as fellow junior
Stephen Piscotty was selected
36th overall by the St. Louis Car
dinals. The pair is just the fourth
duo of Cardinal players to be se
lected in the first round, and the
first since Justin Wayne and Joe
Borchard in 2000. Piscotty hit .318
this season and led the team with
55 RBI.
"I had a bunch of teammates
rooting for me today, and I'll be
rooting for them tomorrow," Pis
cotty said after being chosen by
the Cardinals. "It was pretty
nerve-racking ... I was very sur
prised when they called because I
was talking to a couple of teams
below them when they called."
Lefty Brett Mooneyham, the
Cardinal's number-two starter,
then followed Piscotty off the
board, as the Washington Nation
als took the Atwater, Calif., na
tive with the 111 th pick. Last
year, after he missed the entire
2011 season with a finger injury,
the Nationals selected the left
hander in the 38th round with the
1,147 th pick in the 2011 draft, but
thanks to a 7-5 record, a 4.26
ERA and 90 strikeouts this sea
son, Mooneyham was able to im
prove his draft stock 1,036 places.

Next to have his name called
was junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, who was picked by
the Kansas City Royals in the
fourth round. Coming out of

high school, Diekroeger was a
second-round pick of the Tampa
Bay Rays, but the Woodside,
Calif., has seen his draft stock
drift in the past few years after a
stellar first season where he was
named Pac-10 freshman of the
year. After moving back to short
stop in place of injured sopho
more Lonnie Kauppila,
Diekroeger hit only .269 this sea
son, but has played excellent de
fense, cutting his errors in half
from last season.

The Detroit Tigers made cen
terfielder Jake Stewart the next
Stanford player to be picked, se
lecting the junior in the ninth
round. Stewart, who was drafted
in the 14th round by the Phillies
coming out of high school,
showed some serious pop in his
junior campaign, hitting seven
home runs and 15 doubles while
batting .290 as the team's leadoff
hitter.

The Los Angeles Dodgers
were next, selecting catcher Eric
Smith in the 18th round. Smith,
who switched from the infield to
catcher before this season, hit an
impressive .330 with 32 RBI in his
first season as a starter.

Finally, the Pirates bookended
the Cardinal's drafted players
when they picked outfielder Tyler
Gaffney in the 24th round on
Wednesday. After a dominant
2011 campaign in which he hit
.327 and tallied 35 RBI, Gaffney
had a swoon in his junior year, hit
ting a meager .240 with just 17
RBI. Gaffney, a backup running
back on the Cardinal football
team, could potentially return to
school to play another year of
both sports.
For now, though, all the Cardi
nal players must refocus on the
task at hand, the Super Regionals
against Florida State in Tallahas
see, Fla., this weekend, just one
step away from the College World
Series.
