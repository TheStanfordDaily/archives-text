# A 						special four years on the Farm
## 
### Caroline Caselli Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
As I finish up my time
on the Farm, it's hard
not to look back and
think about my four
years here. All of a
sudden, I understand all of those
speeches we sat through during
Admit Weekend and NSO about
how fast this would go by, and since
Dean Julie is leaving, I'll try to tem
porarily fill-in as leader of nostalgia.
When I came to Stanford, I had
the fears that everyone else had
about college. Except I had all of
them. I wouldn't be able to fit in, I
wouldn't be smart enough and I
would make Stanford second-guess
its decision to let me in. As far as
classes go, I knew that I'd do some
thing techie, mostly because I hated
reading, writing and public speak
ing with a passion. I did not under
stand anything about literature,
writing an essay induced more tor-

ture for me than the machine from
Princess Bride and I became the
first person in memory at my high
school to refuse to give a gradua
tion speech as salutatorian.
Four years later, I have volun
tarily spent most of my collegiate
life reading, writing and speaking to
people. And it's all because of
sports.

During the activities fair my
freshman year at Stanford, I
walked all the way around looking
for something to catch my eye. In
typical fashion, I didn't like any
thing. As I was on the verge of walk
ing away, I realized that my mom
would get frustrated and start lec
turing me if I didn't at least try
something. Begrudgingly I went
back to the tables, where my friend
told me there were a couple adver
tising for sports fans. I've always
loved sports, and I figured it would
sound good if I said I had signed up
for a few things, so I wrote my name
down for The Stanford Daily and
KZSU. And the rest, as they say, is
history. Or at least, the rest has been
my life for the past four years.
They say that sports are a
metaphor for life. I've always hated
this, mostly because talking about
metaphors just reminds me how
much I hated analyzing literature. But
I suppose there is some truth to it.
In sports, the final outcome is
often the result of whether or not
you take advantage of opportuni
ties. Whether it's scoring a goal on
the counterattack, knocking down
the big putt, closing out a break
point or picking off the pass and
taking it to the house, you can make
up for a long period of being out
played as long as you take advan
tage of the opportunities that come
your way.

At Stanford, I got outplayed
big-time. I was never at the top of
my classes, never got prestigious in
ternships, never did research with
professors and never stood any
where close to the top of the social
scene. But in the Stanford sports
world, I took advantage of the op

portunities that came to me, and
that has made all the difference in
my life.

Of course, opportunities are in
some ways all about luck, and I got
incredibly lucky to get where I am
today. Stanford opened up such in
credible opportunities for me, such
as the ability to write this column
for four years and broadcast play
by-play of some of the best athletes
in the world without any prior ex
perience.

1 also got extraordinarily lucky
to come to Stanford at a time when
so many amazing people were here.
For instance, my freshman hallway
in Branner (the greatest hall of all
time) had four athletes in four dif
ferent sports who played at Stan
ford the full four years. One set a
school record and won a national
title in men's volleyball; one was a
first-team All-American and won a
national title in women's soccer;
one was an All-American three
times in singles and in doubles and
won the national men's tennis sin
gles title; and one is a 14-time All-
American and set multiple school
and American records in track.

What an amazing way to enter
college. And it kept going from
there. I got to see the best football
player, women's basketball player
and baseball player (it's ok, Mark
Appel, the Astros will soon realize
their mistake) in the country per
form here, I watched live from the
press box as Stanford went to the
only three bowl games it had been
to in a decade, including the pro
gram's first-ever BCS bowl victory
last year. I saw three straight Heis
man runners-up who easily could
have been winners. I saw four
straight Final Fours for the
women's basketball team and the
men's team start to reap the bene
fits of rebuilding with an NIT title. I
saw the men's volleyball team go
from worst to first right here at
Maples. I saw women's soccer final
ly break through, women's tennis
grind out a thrilling championship
and women's water polo go back
to-back.

The wonderful thing about
Stanford, though, is it isn't just
about that. At Stanford, you get to
meet some of the greatest athletes
in the world and you get to see

championships every year. But you
also get everything else that goes
with it. You don't need to work for
the newspaper or radio station to
get an up-close and personal look
at all these games. You don't need
to be in the right frat or sorority to
know the athletes personally, as
friends instead of just icons. And
you don't need to be in the
LSJUMB to have your blood
pumping when "All Right Now'"
plays.
Stanford sports are for every
one. They're for the sports fanatics
who check Twitter updates for ten
nis scores while they walk back
from the dining hall, but they're
also for the next Mark Zuckerbergs
on campus who want a break from
programming. They're for that girl
you want to ask out and that guy
you met at a party. They're for wide
eyed freshman and jaded grad stu
dents. They're even for professors
and school administrators.

Whatever your passion, Stan
ford gives you opportunities. My
passion happens to be sports, and
after four years, I can proudly say
that I took those opportunities. But
whether or not you're a sports nut
like me, take advantage of the un
believable sports scene on campus.
Meet athletes and learn about their
sports. Go to games that you know
nothing about and find new sports
to enjoy. Learn when to jump dur
ing "All Right Now" and force
everyone around you to do it. Get
wrapped up in the crazed fandom
of a student section and don't care
what the local senior citizens think
ofyourrowdiness.
That way, when you come back
for a reunion after making your
first billion (because as we all know,
a million dollars isn't cool any
more), you can smile fondly as you
reminisce about the football team's
glory years and the days when there
were buildings on campus not
named Arrillaga. And when the
band starts playing, you'll get
goosebumps as you instinctively
yell with the crowd.
Five, six, seven, eight.

They say that sports are a
metaphor for life. I've always hated
this, mostly because talking about
metaphors just reminds me how
much I hated analyzing literature. But
I suppose there is some truth to it.
In sports, the final outcome is
often the result of whether or not
you take advantage of opportuni
ties. Whether it's scoring a goal on
the counterattack, knocking down
the big putt, closing out a break
point or picking off the pass and
taking it to the house, you can make
up for a long period of being out
played as long as you take advan
tage of the opportunities that come
your way.

At Stanford, I got outplayed
big-time. I was never at the top of
my classes, never got prestigious in
ternships, never did research with
professors and never stood any
where close to the top of the social
scene. But in the Stanford sports
world, I took advantage of the op

portunities that came to me, and
that has made all the difference in
my life.

Of course, opportunities are in
some ways all about luck, and I got
incredibly lucky to get where I am
today. Stanford opened up such in
credible opportunities for me, such
as the ability to write this column
for four years and broadcast play
by-play of some of the best athletes
in the world without any prior ex
perience.

1 also got extraordinarily lucky
to come to Stanford at a time when
so many amazing people were here.
For instance, my freshman hallway
in Branner (the greatest hall of all
time) had four athletes in four dif
ferent sports who played at Stan
ford the full four years. One set a
school record and won a national
title in men's volleyball; one was a
first-team All-American and won a
national title in women's soccer;
one was an All-American three
times in singles and in doubles and
won the national men's tennis sin
gles title; and one is a 14-time All-
American and set multiple school
and American records in track.

What an amazing way to enter
college. And it kept going from
there. I got to see the best football
player, women's basketball player
and baseball player (it's ok, Mark
Appel, the Astros will soon realize
their mistake) in the country per
form here, I watched live from the
press box as Stanford went to the
only three bowl games it had been
to in a decade, including the pro
gram's first-ever BCS bowl victory
last year. I saw three straight Heis
man runners-up who easily could
have been winners. I saw four
straight Final Fours for the
women's basketball team and the
men's team start to reap the bene
fits of rebuilding with an NIT title. I
saw the men's volleyball team go
from worst to first right here at
Maples. I saw women's soccer final
ly break through, women's tennis
grind out a thrilling championship
and women's water polo go back
to-back.

The wonderful thing about
Stanford, though, is it isn't just
about that. At Stanford, you get to
meet some of the greatest athletes
in the world and you get to see

championships every year. But you
also get everything else that goes
with it. You don't need to work for
the newspaper or radio station to
get an up-close and personal look
at all these games. You don't need
to be in the right frat or sorority to
know the athletes personally, as
friends instead of just icons. And
you don't need to be in the
LSJUMB to have your blood
pumping when "All Right Now'"
plays.
Stanford sports are for every
one. They're for the sports fanatics
who check Twitter updates for ten
nis scores while they walk back
from the dining hall, but they're
also for the next Mark Zuckerbergs
on campus who want a break from
programming. They're for that girl
you want to ask out and that guy
you met at a party. They're for wide
eyed freshman and jaded grad stu
dents. They're even for professors
and school administrators.

Whatever your passion, Stan
ford gives you opportunities. My
passion happens to be sports, and
after four years, I can proudly say
that I took those opportunities. But
whether or not you're a sports nut
like me, take advantage of the un
believable sports scene on campus.
Meet athletes and learn about their
sports. Go to games that you know
nothing about and find new sports
to enjoy. Learn when to jump dur
ing "All Right Now" and force
everyone around you to do it. Get
wrapped up in the crazed fandom
of a student section and don't care
what the local senior citizens think
ofyourrowdiness.
That way, when you come back
for a reunion after making your
first billion (because as we all know,
a million dollars isn't cool any
more), you can smile fondly as you
reminisce about the football team's
glory years and the days when there
were buildings on campus not
named Arrillaga. And when the
band starts playing, you'll get
goosebumps as you instinctively
yell with the crowd.
Five, six, seven, eight.

As I finish up my time
on the Farm, it's hard
not to look back and
think about my four
years here. All of a
sudden, I understand all of those
speeches we sat through during
Admit Weekend and NSO about
how fast this would go by, and since
Dean Julie is leaving, I'll try to tem
porarily fill-in as leader of nostalgia.
When I came to Stanford, I had
the fears that everyone else had
about college. Except I had all of
them. I wouldn't be able to fit in, I
wouldn't be smart enough and I
would make Stanford second-guess
its decision to let me in. As far as
classes go, I knew that I'd do some
thing techie, mostly because I hated
reading, writing and public speak
ing with a passion. I did not under
stand anything about literature,
writing an essay induced more tor-

ture for me than the machine from
Princess Bride and I became the
first person in memory at my high
school to refuse to give a gradua
tion speech as salutatorian.
Four years later, I have volun
tarily spent most of my collegiate
life reading, writing and speaking to
people. And it's all because of
sports.

During the activities fair my
freshman year at Stanford, I
walked all the way around looking
for something to catch my eye. In
typical fashion, I didn't like any
thing. As I was on the verge of walk
ing away, I realized that my mom
would get frustrated and start lec
turing me if I didn't at least try
something. Begrudgingly I went
back to the tables, where my friend
told me there were a couple adver
tising for sports fans. I've always
loved sports, and I figured it would
sound good if I said I had signed up
for a few things, so I wrote my name
down for The Stanford Daily and
KZSU. And the rest, as they say, is
history. Or at least, the rest has been
my life for the past four years.
