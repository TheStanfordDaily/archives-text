# Seeking solace in sports
## 
### 
When faced with one
of the biggest deci
sions of my young
life back in 2008
choosing where I
would attend school for the next four
years I knew very few specifics
about what I wanted out of my college
experience. However, three things
were certain: I wanted to go to a
"good" school (whatever that
means), the weather had to be tolera
ble and sports were important. By de
fault, small liberal arts schools and the
Ivies were out, and my application list
quickly came to resemble the more
temperate half of the then-Pac-10
conference.
As inconsequential as my criteria
may seem, they reveal a great deal
about who I am and how I ended up
at Stanford. My mother, a Stanford
alumna herself (the great class of
77!), emphasized the importance of
academics throughout my upbring
ing and inspired longtime loves for
reading, writing and the arts loves
that first brought me to the Daily
building in the fall of 2008 for what
would ultimately become the most
defining activity of my college career.
Growing up in perhaps the nation's
most moderate climate, in the lovely
East Bay city of Alameda, Calif, I am
uncomfortable when the weather de
viates too far below 60 or above 80.
Neither snow nor the extreme heat
would see their ways into my under
graduate life.
And then there are sports. It's im
possible for me to describe when
sports became prominent in my life
because there was never a time that
they weren't there. My father, who
played football for a couple of years at
a certain East Bay university, was the
quintessential sports dad: the guy who
helped coach Little League baseball
and rec-league basketball, provided

running color commentary on every
home video and had to be restrained
by other dads when my brother was
violently taken down in a soccer
game. Photo albums from the first five
years of my life document a smatter
ing of Giants and A's games and great
retro Bay Area sports paraphernalia,
and many of my earliest memories in
volve traveling up and down Califor
nia (to glamorous hotspots like
Modesto and Morgan Hill) to watch
my older brother's various (and fre
quent) sporting events.
But in 1995, my family of four was
rocked by tragedy when my dad was
diagnosed with a brain tumor; nine
months later, he was gone. My broth
er, 11 at the time, sought solace in his
busy schedule of athletic commit
ments. A six-year-old girl now lacking
a father figure, I sought solace in my
brother.

From that point on, what my
brother liked, I liked, which meant
any team facing the Lakers, the World
Cup before it was trendy in the States
and Barry Bonds, despite his surly de
meanor and regardless of whether or
not he took steroids (ask either of us,
he didn't). When my brother chose to
attend Stanford in 2003,1 became a
Stanford sports enthusiast right
alongside him, celebrating the glori
ous 2004 basketball season (minus its
untimely end) and woefully enduring

zero Big Game victories during his
four-year tenure.

When I too became a Cardinal in
2008, our sports worlds converged still
further, and now, most Saturdays in
the fall are spent sharing drinks with
friends at Gate 10 followed by rau
cous cheering in Stanford Stadium.
Forever bonded by a passion for Stan
ford athletics, 1 have no doubt that our
future holds years of season tickets,
bowl game excursions and March
Madness brackets that optimistically
take Stanford farther than they'll go.
On Sunday, June 17 barring
any academic catastrophes I will
graduate from Stanford University.
My commencement falls squarely
upon Father's Day, and although my
dad won't be present alongside my
mom and brother in the stands to
watch me receive my diploma, I like
to think that he would be proud of the
daughter, and more specifically, the
sports writer, editor and enthusiast
that I have become in his absence.
And even though he was a Bear, I
know he'd be a closet Andrew Luck
fan.

that first brought me to the Daily
building in the fall of 2008 for what
would ultimately become the most
defining activity of my college career.
Growing up in perhaps the nation's
most moderate climate, in the lovely
East Bay city of Alameda, Calif, I am
uncomfortable when the weather de
viates too far below 60 or above 80.
Neither snow nor the extreme heat
would see their ways into my under
graduate life.
And then there are sports. It's im
possible for me to describe when
sports became prominent in my life
because there was never a time that
they weren't there. My father, who
played football for a couple of years at
a certain East Bay university, was the
quintessential sports dad: the guy who
helped coach Little League baseball
and rec-league basketball, provided

running color commentary on every
home video and had to be restrained
by other dads when my brother was
violently taken down in a soccer
game. Photo albums from the first five
years of my life document a smatter
ing of Giants and A's games and great
retro Bay Area sports paraphernalia,
and many of my earliest memories in
volve traveling up and down Califor
nia (to glamorous hotspots like
Modesto and Morgan Hill) to watch
my older brother's various (and fre
quent) sporting events.
But in 1995, my family of four was
rocked by tragedy when my dad was
diagnosed with a brain tumor; nine
months later, he was gone. My broth
er, 11 at the time, sought solace in his
busy schedule of athletic commit
ments. A six-year-old girl now lacking
a father figure, I sought solace in my
brother.

From that point on, what my
brother liked, I liked, which meant
any team facing the Lakers, the World
Cup before it was trendy in the States
and Barry Bonds, despite his surly de
meanor and regardless of whether or
not he took steroids (ask either of us,
he didn't). When my brother chose to
attend Stanford in 2003,1 became a
Stanford sports enthusiast right
alongside him, celebrating the glori
ous 2004 basketball season (minus its
untimely end) and woefully enduring

zero Big Game victories during his
four-year tenure.

When I too became a Cardinal in
2008, our sports worlds converged still
further, and now, most Saturdays in
the fall are spent sharing drinks with
friends at Gate 10 followed by rau
cous cheering in Stanford Stadium.
Forever bonded by a passion for Stan
ford athletics, 1 have no doubt that our
future holds years of season tickets,
bowl game excursions and March
Madness brackets that optimistically
take Stanford farther than they'll go.
On Sunday, June 17 barring
any academic catastrophes I will
graduate from Stanford University.
My commencement falls squarely
upon Father's Day, and although my
dad won't be present alongside my
mom and brother in the stands to
watch me receive my diploma, I like
to think that he would be proud of the
daughter, and more specifically, the
sports writer, editor and enthusiast
that I have become in his absence.
And even though he was a Bear, I
know he'd be a closet Andrew Luck
fan.
