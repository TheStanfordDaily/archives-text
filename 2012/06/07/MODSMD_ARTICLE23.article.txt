## CARDINAL RALLIES TWICE TO WIN REGIONAL AT HOME 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Three up, three down for the Cardinal
baseball team.
Stanford swept its regional for the second
straight year, beating Fresno State once and
Pepperdine twice at Sunken Diamond last
weekend to stay in contention for its first na
tional title since 1988.
It took two come-from-behind wins over
the Waves after junior righty Mark Appel
shut down the Bulldogs on Friday night, but
the Cardinal (41-16, 18-12 Pac-12) showed

why it deserved to host a regional for the first
time in four years with a weekend of solid
play.
"We battled, and at this stage of the year
you have to be able to do that," said head
coach Mark Marquess.

Besides Appel, Stanford's starters hit
some rough spots, but the bullpen gave up no
earned runs in its 9.1 innings of work.
The Cardinal did benefit from its oppo
nents' mistakes a combined seven errors,
20 walks and eight hit-by-pitches over the
three games, including a three-run wild pitch
that proved crucial in game two but its

best hitters also showed up on a big stage. Jun
ior catcher Eric Smith, sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, sophomore second base
man Danny Diekroeger and junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger were all named to the all
regional team, with Ragira reaching base 10
times in his 14 plate appearances.
"I'm just trying to get on, and we have a
bunch of run-producers throughout the line
up," Ragira said. "I know that the guys behind
me ... are going to come up big for us."

The Stanford baseball team downed Fresno State and Pepperdine over the weekend to take home a regional victory in the first round of the
College World Series. Now, the Cardinal travels cross-country to Tallahassee, Fla., to take on the Florida State Seminoles in a best-of-three
series in the Super Regionals. The winner will advance to Omaha, Neb., and the College World Series finals at TD Ameritrade Park.
the story of the weekend had it
not been for Appel's stellar Friday
night performance.

Fresno State came in as the
only team to have beaten Appel
(10-1), pounding his fastball and
getting two home runs from
sophomore centerfielder Aaron
Judge when the Bulldogs met the
Cardinal in March. That wouldn't
be the case in the regional open
er.

"We were pretty sure he was
going to come out and make an
adjustment this week," said Bull
dog head coach Mike Badesole.
"The kid is fantastic. He had the
answer. He had two great break
ing balls to go to.
"I'm pretty sure he could've
won a big-league game today,"
Badesole added.

Appel, the eventual tourna
ment MVP, tossed his fifth com
plete game of the season, striking
out 11 and allowing only four
hits, just three days before his
name was called eighth in the
MLB Draft.

"It's difficult for the juniors
that are draftable, and when they
tell you they're not thinking
about it, they're not being honest
with you," Marquess said. "You
can't help but think about it.
Everybody comes at you, every
which way ... it's just crazy. But
he's handled it well."

The Cardinal nearly got on
the board in the first frame when
Ragira was robbed of an RBI
double by a diving Jordan Lu
plow in right. The freshman ap
peared to drop the ball, but the
umpires ruled it a catch, quickly
evoking memories of Tyler
Gaffney's controversial snag in
last year's Fullerton Regional in
a 1-0 Stanford win.
Cardinal runners advanced to
third in each of the next three in
nings, but the squad was unable
to bring one home. After pitching
twice on short rest in the WAC
Tournament, righthander Justin
Haley held Stanford off the
scoreboard and got two-out
strikeouts with runners on third
in the third and fourth.

The spark finally came for the
Cardinal with two outs in the
fifth. Junior leftfielder and pitch
er Stephen Piscotty started the

rally with a double before sopho
more rightfielder Austin Wilson
singled with the count full to put
Stanford ahead 2-0.
"We left a lot of runners on
base and had a lot of opportuni
ties to score," Marquess said.
"But I thought Wilson's hit, get
ting two runs on the board, was
big."

Haley had struck out five Car
dinal batters at that point, but his
luck ran out in a three-run sixth.
Only one Stanford hit left the in
field, but three walks, a hit-by
pitch and an infield hit extended
the Cardinal cushion to five.

The Bulldogs got to Appel for
the first time in the next frame, as
an RBI double by redshirt junior
first baseman Trent Garrison
ended the shutout. The seventh
inning was the first one in which
Appel did not record a strikeout.
The Diekroeger brothers then
turned a 6-4-3 double-play to
help Appel get out of an eighth
inning jam, before two straight
hit-by-pitches in the eighth
scored Stanford's sixth run and a
Kenny Diekroeger single fol
lowed by an error made it 9-1.
With the win, Appel became
the first Cardinal pitcher to win 10
games in a season since Jeff
Gilmore in 2005.

Unfortunately, Stanford didn't
get the same starting performance
on Saturday from lefthander
Brett Mooneyham, who departed
after just 2.1 innings. Pepperdine
which had beaten Michigan
State 6-2 on Friday to enter the
winner's bracket scored two
runs to start the third and then
loaded the bases to force the red
shirt junior from the game.
"He got himself into trouble,"
Marquess said. "He really hadn't
pitched that poorly, but to their
credit, they followed it with a cou
ple of hits."
After junior righty Dean
McArdle replaced Mooneyham,
redshirt freshman Bryan Langlois
blasted a double off the left-field
wall to give the Waves an early 4-
0 lead.

Ragira revived Stanford's
hopes with a shot to dead-center,
his fifth home run of the year, to
lead off the top of the fourth; the
Cardinal was the away team on

Saturday afternoon, so it came to
the plate in the top half and com
mandeered the dugout on the
third-base side.

That quirk would come to the
forefront in the sixth, when, still
down 4-1, Stanford loaded the
bases for Gaffney with one out.
Sophomore righthander Scott
Frazier then bounced a curveball
several feet in front of the plate
and over the head of catcher
Miles Silverstein.

Ragira came around to score
while freshman third baseman
Alex Blandino moved to third
and Smith advanced to second.
Silverstein then tried to pump
fake to third, but the ball squirted
out of his hand and toward the
Cardinal dugout.
"Next thing I know, the ball is
rolling around and the pitcher is
around me," Ragira said. "We
were hustling, and the ball rolled
our way."
With Ragira and his team
mates celebrating in foul territory
and Blandino racing down the
third-base line, Frazier and Sil
verstein chased after the loose
ball, but it rolled through the
mass of humanity and into the
Stanford dugout.
After a quick discussion be
tween the umpires and an argu
ment with Pepperdine head
coach Steve Rodriguez, Smith
was awarded another base and
the game was suddenly tied at
four.

"My only problem was the
crowd control around the
dugout," Rodriguez said. "When
their whole team is out there and
the pitcher goes out there for the
ball that was probably the only
thing I could say was an issue."
McArdle would go scoreless
into the sixth before Marquess
turned the game over to sopho
more righty A.J. Vanegas with a
runner on third. Freshman cen
terfielder Matt Gelalich chopped
one to second, and Danny
Diekroeger nailed Langlois at
home to save a run.
That run would turn out to be
the difference, with Kenny
Diekroeger coming through late
again on an eighth-inning RBI
double that made it 5-4 for Stan
ford.

Then it would be up to Vane
gas (4-0), who came up with a ca
reer outing at just the right time.
In his 3.2 innings he struck out
eight batters, including five of the
last six he faced and four in a row
swinging to end the game.
"It was an unbelievable job by
A.J.," Marquess said of the all-re
gional team selection. "He had
great stuff and won big spots all
evening."
With Fresno State having
knocked out three-seed Michigan
State that afternoon, the Cardinal
knew it was set for a rematch with
either the Bulldogs or Waves in
Sunday's late game, where Pep
perdine redshirt senior designat
ed hitter Matt Forgatch kept his
career alive with a grand slam to
snatch an 8-5 advantage that the
Waves would not relinquish.

It was a short turnaround for
Pepperdine before its 6 p.m. elim
ination game with Stanford. Be
cause they had burned their top
three starters, the Waves' chances
seemed slim, especially given
their unreliable bullpen.

But it would be the Cardinal's
starter that was beat up early.
Senior rightfielder Tony Cooper
slapped a two-out, RBI single off
Stephen Piscotty in the first be
fore Pepperdine loaded the
bases. Blandino then dropped a
tricky flyout in foul territory that
would have ended the inning, and
the error led to the second 4-0
lead for the Waves over Stanford
in as many evenings.

"I thought it was going to be a
long night," Marquess said. "The
key for us was Piscotty settling
down."

"This is probably the biggest
game I've ever played in my life,"
Piscotty said. "And I got knocked
down, but I wasn't going to give up."
He went on to retire 11 straight
batters and put up five scoreless
innings in a row, giving Stanford
more than enough time to mount
a response.

A leadoff double by junior
centerfielder Jake Stewart got
things going in the first, before
Piscotty got the Cardinal on the
board with a single off the glove of
sophomore lefty Matt Maurer.
A Ragira double with two on
in the third made it 4-2, and Wil

son nearly tied it on a line drive
just foul of the leftfield line.

Blandino flew out to the warn
ing track to bring home Stanford's
third run in the same inning, but
with two on and two out, third
baseman Austin Davidson made
an acrobatic catch in foul ground,
in the same place that Blandino
had dropped one earlier, to end
the frame and preserve Pepper
dine's lead.

Just an inning later, Stanford
would complete the comeback
and on top of that, do some more
damage. Wilson singled with the
bases loaded to grab a 5-4 lead for
his team, bringing Blandino to the
plate with two on and two outs.
The freshman blasted a 1-0 pitch
over the leftfield wall to give the
Cardinal a four-run advantage, its
first comfortable lead over the
Waves all weekend.

Pepperdine wasn't done, how
ever, and four straight hits in the
top of the seventh spelled three
Waves runs and the end of Piscot
ty's night.
Junior righty Sahil Bloom
cleaned things up and got through
an uneventful eighth before lead
off hitter Zach Vincej came to the
plate to start the ninth. With the
count at 2-2 and the Cardinal's
lead at 8-7, the junior shortstop hit
a high fly ball down the leftfield
line that cleared the fences, but
just a few feet foul.
"It started to hook [foul] a lit
tle bit, and then it kind of went
straight," said Blandino, who had
perhaps the best view of anyone
from third base. "I knew it was
going to be foul, but I definitely
held my breath there for a couple
of seconds."

Vincej would eventually
ground out to second, and three
batters later Stanford was headed
to a Super Regional.

The Cardinal will travel to Tal
lahassee, Fla. to face No. 3 Florida
State, which also swept its home
regional. The series kicks off Fri
day night at 4 p.m. PDT and con
tinues Saturday at 3 p.m., with the
fourth game to be played at 4 p.m.
if necessary. All the action will be
televised on ESPN2.
