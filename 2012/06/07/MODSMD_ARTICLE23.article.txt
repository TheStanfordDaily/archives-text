## CARDINAL RALLIES TWICE TO WIN REGIONAL AT HOME 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Three up, three down for the Cardinal
baseball team.
Stanford swept its regional for the second
straight year, beating Fresno State once and
Pepperdine twice at Sunken Diamond last
weekend to stay in contention for its first na
tional title since 1988.
It took two come-from-behind wins over
the Waves after junior righty Mark Appel
shut down the Bulldogs on Friday night, but
the Cardinal (41-16, 18-12 Pac-12) showed

why it deserved to host a regional for the first
time in four years with a weekend of solid
play.
"We battled, and at this stage of the year
you have to be able to do that," said head
coach Mark Marquess.

Besides Appel, Stanford's starters hit
some rough spots, but the bullpen gave up no
earned runs in its 9.1 innings of work.
The Cardinal did benefit from its oppo
nents' mistakes a combined seven errors,
20 walks and eight hit-by-pitches over the
three games, including a three-run wild pitch
that proved crucial in game two but its

best hitters also showed up on a big stage. Jun
ior catcher Eric Smith, sophomore first base
man Brian Ragira, sophomore second base
man Danny Diekroeger and junior shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger were all named to the all
regional team, with Ragira reaching base 10
times in his 14 plate appearances.
"I'm just trying to get on, and we have a
bunch of run-producers throughout the line
up," Ragira said. "I know that the guys behind
me ... are going to come up big for us."
