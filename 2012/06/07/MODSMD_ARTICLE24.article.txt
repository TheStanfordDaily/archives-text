## Florida State stands in the way of Omaha 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The No. 13 Stanford baseball
team may have swept its regional
last weekend, but it still has a
cross-country trip up next.
That's a story that's all too fa
miliar to the Cardinal (41-16,18-
12 Pac-12), which was eliminated
at No. 7 North Carolina a season
ago after dominated the Fuller
ton regional. The Tar Heels shut

down Stanford's bats in the open
er before barely escaping a Cardi
nal comeback the following after
noon, which featured a three
hour-and-32-minute rain delay
right in the middle of a four-run
Stanford rally that fell just short.

Now the Cardinal must travel
to the Southeast once again, this
time to face No. 3 Florida State,
another experienced national
seed that will benefit from play
ing on its home turf against a jet

lagged Stanford squad. This time,
at least, all three games will be
played at night, a welcome depar
ture from the sweaty afternoon
opener that seemed to catch the
Cardinal off guard in Chapel Hill
last year.

"I just think we kind of got
overwhelmed going down there,"
said junior centerfielder Jake
Stewart, who was drafted by the
Detroit Tigers in the ninth round
of this week's MLB Draft. "It was

100 degrees with 100 percent hu
midity, and I think all those fac
tors got to us."

Stanford is also much more ex
perienced than last year's group,
which often started seven under
classmen in the field.

"I think in some ways we were
almost happy to be there," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "The expectation level last
year [was], Are we going to win a
regional?' Most of the players that
went [to the Super Regionals] last
year are back, and they're not just
happy to be there. They know
we're playing a great team, but it's
a different mindset."
That attitude is bound to make
for a competitive Super Regional
between two regional hosts; only
two of the eight Supers feature a
pair of top seeds, and the other, co
incidentally, is being played 150

miles down the road in
Gainesville, between Florida and
North Carolina State.

Florida State (46-15, 24-6 At
lantic Coast Conference) earned
its right to host a Super Regional
with one of the nation's top
records, fueled by three separate
win streaks of at least seven
games. The Seminoles didn't lose
a weekend series until mid-May,
though they entered the NCAA
tournament with a thud after fail
ing to win a game in the ACC
tournament for the first time in
school history.
But those struggles seemed
long behind them by the end of
the Tallahassee regional, with

Florida State sneaking by UAB in
the opener before taking control
in 8-1 and 5-2 wins over Samford.

On the season, the Seminoles
are an impressive 30-5 at home, so
the Cardinal will be going against
the odds when it ventures into
Dick Howser Stadium on Friday
night.

"They're used to winning, just
like any of the great programs,"
Marquess said. "Especially at
home."

Florida State is as good of an
all-around squad as can be found
in college baseball. Given its top
-50 scoring and pitching and lack of
any defensive malady, it's easy to
see why it spent a good chunk of

the season as the top-ranked team
in the country.
The Seminoles only have three
.300 hitters, but Stanford can't
quite match up with their top two
sluggers, junior Jayce Boyd (.390)
and senior James Ramsey (.385).
Ramsey, a 13-home-run hitter,
drove in six runs in the first two
games of the Seminoles' regional,
while Boyd had only three hits on
the weekend.
Florida State's two dominant
freshman starters, lefty Brandon
Leibrandt and righty Mike Comp
ton, have combined for a 18-4
record and a 2.78 ERA. But head
coach Mike Martin opted instead
to go with junior Scott Sitz

whose 3.99 ERA is, by compari
son, pedestrian to open the
ACC tournament and Florida
State's regional.

If Martin chooses to do so
again, Sitz (3-3) will face off
against Stanford righty Mark
Appel (10-1), who has not lost a
game in over three months.
"We're prepared and I think
we've performed under pressure
all year long," Appel said. "And we
know there's going to be a lot of
pressure out there this weekend."

The Cardinal's hitters be
sides just getting to Sitz are
going to have to put some signifi
cant pressure on either Leibrandt
or Compton if Stanford wants to
make it to Omaha.

Redshirt junior lefthander
Brett Mooneyham was unreliable
for the second week in a row last
Saturday, while junior leftfielder
and pitcher Stephen Piscotty gave
up four first-inning runs only
one of them earned in the even
tual clincher over Pepperdine.
Luckily for Mooneyham and
Piscotty, Stanford's bats had a fair
ly encouraging weekend against
Fresno State and Pepperdine,
Sophomore first baseman Brian
Ragira continued his solid sopho
more season by reaching base 10
times, while sophomore rightfield
er Austin Wilson knocked in five
runs in key situations. Struggling
juniors Kenny Diekroeger and
Tyler Gaffney also showed some
signs of life, even if they didn't
match that production.
Marquess expressed some con
cern that his team was stranding
too many runners in scoring posi
tion leaving 31 on base over the
course of the regional but two
comeback wins from identical 4-0
deficits against the Waves showed
that the Cardinal is on the right
track.

"There have been a couple of
times this year when we've gone
down early and haven't really
come back the way we wanted to,"
Stewart said. "I think this week
end really showed us that we
could come together and even if..
. we're down by four runs, we
could come back and have that
faith in each other and that faith in
the team.

"I think if we do that, we'll
compete with anybody," he added.
The Card will have to compete
this weekend if it wants to make its
first College World Series appear
ance since 2008.

Friday night's opener will be
played at 4 p.m. PDT and can be
seen on ESPN2, along with the
Super Regional. The teams then
square off Saturday at 3 p.m. and,
if necessary, Sunday at 4 p.m.

Freshman Alex Blandino (above), who was named a freshman Ail-American by Collegiate Baseball on Wednesday, helped spur the Stanford baseball
team to two comeback victories against Pepperdine over the weekend to keep the Cardinal in contention for its first national title since 1 988.
