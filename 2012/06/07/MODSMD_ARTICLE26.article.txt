## Card falters at NCAAs 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Weighed down by a poor second round, the Stan
ford men's golf team stumbled to a 19th-place finish
at the NCAA Championships at Riviera Country
Club in Los Angeles. After three rounds of stroke
play and three more rounds of match play, Texas won
the national championship, narrowly defeating Ala
bama.

"We obviously had higher expectations," said
head coach Conrad Ray. "The guys fought hard. We
had two really solid rounds, and then the middle
round kind of shot us out of the water. In a competi
tive field [with] as many good teams as there are, you
can't afford to have that bad round."

Although freshman Patrick Rodgers, a Ben
Hogan Award finalist and the nation's fourth-ranked
college golfer, shot rounds of 69-72-73 to finish in a tie
for ninth at one-over par, the rest of the Cardinal
struggled on the difficult Riviera course. Junior An
drew Yun was the Cardinal's second-lowest scorer,
finishing at +lO to tie for 69th.

"It's a tough golf course, I think we had a couple of
guys that were struggling to find some confidence out
there. It was difficult. There just weren't too many
places where you could really miss," Rodgers said.

"We knew all year that we had a good enough team
to win the national championship. It's just a matter of
putting it all together at the right time, and obviously
we don't have any tournaments left to do that, so it's
disappointing."

Ray said the breeze and tough pin locations made
the course especially difficult during the second
round of play. No Cardinal players broke par that day.
"We strung too many bad holes together," Ray
said. "I think our guys got off to maybe a little bit of a
slower start than they wanted, and then sometimes if
you're trying to make birdies, you can make bogies in
a hurry, especially at a course like Riviera. I think we
probably pressed a little bit too much. It was just one
of those days."

Yun said the team's poor performance could not
be attributed to a lack of effort.

"I definitely think that everyone was working re
ally hard. We didn't have any excuses for playing
badly we just didn't have our best stuff," he said.
Despite the team's disappointment, Ray said
there are a lot of positives to take from the season.
"Golf is very competitive and unpredictable," he
said. "For our team, being fairly young really ... to be
