# MEN'S GOLF
## Card falters at NCAAs 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Weighed down by a poor second round, the Stan
ford men's golf team stumbled to a 19th-place finish
at the NCAA Championships at Riviera Country
Club in Los Angeles. After three rounds of stroke
play and three more rounds of match play, Texas won
the national championship, narrowly defeating Ala
bama.

"We obviously had higher expectations," said
head coach Conrad Ray. "The guys fought hard. We
had two really solid rounds, and then the middle
round kind of shot us out of the water. In a competi
tive field [with] as many good teams as there are, you
can't afford to have that bad round."

Although freshman Patrick Rodgers, a Ben
Hogan Award finalist and the nation's fourth-ranked
college golfer, shot rounds of 69-72-73 to finish in a tie
for ninth at one-over par, the rest of the Cardinal
struggled on the difficult Riviera course. Junior An
drew Yun was the Cardinal's second-lowest scorer,
finishing at +lO to tie for 69th.

"It's a tough golf course, I think we had a couple of
guys that were struggling to find some confidence out
there. It was difficult. There just weren't too many
places where you could really miss," Rodgers said.

"We knew all year that we had a good enough team
to win the national championship. It's just a matter of
putting it all together at the right time, and obviously
we don't have any tournaments left to do that, so it's
disappointing."

Ray said the breeze and tough pin locations made
the course especially difficult during the second
round of play. No Cardinal players broke par that day.
"We strung too many bad holes together," Ray
said. "I think our guys got off to maybe a little bit of a
slower start than they wanted, and then sometimes if
you're trying to make birdies, you can make bogies in
a hurry, especially at a course like Riviera. I think we
probably pressed a little bit too much. It was just one
of those days."

Yun said the team's poor performance could not
be attributed to a lack of effort.

"I definitely think that everyone was working re
ally hard. We didn't have any excuses for playing
badly we just didn't have our best stuff," he said.
Despite the team's disappointment, Ray said
there are a lot of positives to take from the season.
"Golf is very competitive and unpredictable," he
said. "For our team, being fairly young really ... to be
in the top 10 in the national rank
ing most of the season and to have
won a big tournament in Chicago
[The Olympia Fields/Fighting Illi
ni Invitational] in the fall and be
competitive in a number of others,
I think there's a lot to be proud of
and a lot to build on."

In a welcome bit of good news,
sophomore Cameron Wilson
qualified for the U.S. Open, which
starts next Thursday at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco.
Rodgers and senior captain David
Chung also participated in sec
tional qualifying, but only Wilson
made the cut.

"If we get through our finals,
we're definitely going [to the U.S.
Open to support Wilson],"
Rodgers said. "We're all really
happy for him, and I'm going to
try to go up there at least one or
two days to watch some practice
rounds and just see how he's doing
and root him on ... we're all ex
cited for him."

Although the Cardinal won
only one tournament as a team on

the year, Yun won the Pac-12
Championships, and Rodgers, re
cently named a PING First Team
All-American, won two tourna
ments in his first year of college
golf.

Senior captain Chung is de
parting, but Stanford has signed
two new recruits for next year:
2010 Washington State Golf Asso
ciation Junior Boys Player of the
Year Dominick Franks and David
Boote, member of the Welsh Na
tional Men's Amateur Squad and
winner of the 2011 Welsh Boys
Golf Championship.
Yun and Steven Kearney, who
shot rounds of 74-77-73 to finish in
a tie for 77th at Riviera, are the
team's rising seniors, while Andre
DeDecker will be a redshirt jun
ior.

"Losing David [is] obviously
going to be a big loss and tough
shoes to fill," Rodgers said. "I
know he struggled this year, but
he's a great player and he played
great for Stanford for four years,
so he should be really proud of
what he's done. We're all really
thankful to have him here at Stan
ford."

Chung compiled an impressive
list of honors in his four years on
the team. He played in the 2011

Masters and U.S. Open and
helped the U.S. team defeat Eu
rope in the 2010 Palmer Cup. He
won the 2010 Western Amateur
and the 2010 Porter Cup, and in his
sophomore year, he was named a
Ben Hogan Award semifinalist
and a PING Third Team All-
American. He was also named to
the All-Pac-10 first team that year.
Over the summer, players will
compete regularly to stay sharp.
Rodgers and Yun will travel to
Northern Ireland to play for the
United States in the Palmer Cup,
which starts June 28 and pits top
American college golfers against
their European counterparts. Last
year, Yun went 4-0 in Palmer Cup
match play to lead the United
States to its second straight victory.
Rodgers said the team is highly
motivated to perform better next
year.

"Here at Stanford, the goal
never changes it's to win a na
tional championship and every
year you don't [win], you're going
to end the year disappointed," he
said. "We're going to work hard
and hopefully get back with a
chance to win next year."
