# Fathers, sons and sports

It's almost over. It's the fourth
quarter. It's the bottom of the
ninth. We're halfway up the
18th hole. In reality though, it's
the end of spring quarter, and
I've got a little more than one week
left on the Farm. I've found that sen
ior year is a good time to think about
memories and spend time swapping
stories about the last four' years, but
more importantly, it's a good time to
reflect on who we are, how we've
changed, how twists of fate and luck
brought us here today and why we do
what we do. And with this being my
final column in The Stanford Daily,
I've got just one last chance to reflect
on my time covering Stanford sports.
Last week, it struck me that my
graduation would occur in Stanford
Stadium, a place that's been im
mensely important to my time here.
I'll never forget watching Andrew
Luck complete a perfect 50-yard
pass in his first Cardinal-White game
or beating USC on a last-second field
goal in 2010. It's pretty easy for me to
say that many of my most unforget
table moments here have occurred in
various Stanford stadiums, and I'm
glad my last Stanford moment will
happen there.
But it also struck me that my
graduation would occur on Father's
Day, with my dad in the stands. And
for a somewhat mundane. Hallmark
card holiday, it's one that has a lot of
significance in my life.
My dad spent his first Father's
Daybehindaglasswall, watching me
in the neonatal intensive care unit in
Dallas, Texas, hobbled by pneumonia
that left me with just a 50 percent
chance to five. He'll spend his 23rd
watching me cross the stage at Stan
ford, his alma mater. And really,
there's no better way to explain what
brought me here than to start with
him.

In the course of those 23 years, I
have to attribute a lot of my charac
ter today to him, including my love of
sports, reading and writing that in
evitably drew me to Stanford and
The Daily.

over the weekend at the NCAA championships in Los Angeles, finishing in 19th place out of 30 teams.
