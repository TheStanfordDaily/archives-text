# Fathers, sons and sports
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
It's almost over. It's the fourth
quarter. It's the bottom of the
ninth. We're halfway up the
18th hole. In reality though, it's
the end of spring quarter, and
I've got a little more than one week
left on the Farm. I've found that sen
ior year is a good time to think about
memories and spend time swapping
stories about the last four' years, but
more importantly, it's a good time to
reflect on who we are, how we've
changed, how twists of fate and luck
brought us here today and why we do
what we do. And with this being my
final column in The Stanford Daily,
I've got just one last chance to reflect
on my time covering Stanford sports.
Last week, it struck me that my
graduation would occur in Stanford
Stadium, a place that's been im
mensely important to my time here.
I'll never forget watching Andrew
Luck complete a perfect 50-yard
pass in his first Cardinal-White game
or beating USC on a last-second field
goal in 2010. It's pretty easy for me to
say that many of my most unforget
table moments here have occurred in
various Stanford stadiums, and I'm
glad my last Stanford moment will
happen there.
But it also struck me that my
graduation would occur on Father's
Day, with my dad in the stands. And
for a somewhat mundane. Hallmark
card holiday, it's one that has a lot of
significance in my life.
My dad spent his first Father's
Daybehindaglasswall, watching me
in the neonatal intensive care unit in
Dallas, Texas, hobbled by pneumonia
that left me with just a 50 percent
chance to five. He'll spend his 23rd
watching me cross the stage at Stan
ford, his alma mater. And really,
there's no better way to explain what
brought me here than to start with
him.

In the course of those 23 years, I
have to attribute a lot of my charac
ter today to him, including my love of
sports, reading and writing that in
evitably drew me to Stanford and
The Daily.

In the final tournament of his college career, senior David Chung (above) and the Stanford golf team struggled
over the weekend at the NCAA championships in Los Angeles, finishing in 19th place out of 30 teams.
Together, through road trips to
catch SEC football games, hot after
noons spent trying to hook fish and
our fair share of nights watching the
double-A Arkansas Travelers at Ray
Winder Field, sports became the
huge part of my life that it is to this
day. Thanks to his near-obsessive
level of reading books and maga
zines, there was always plenty of
reading material to keep me occu
pied growing up. And thanks to his
stories about theTheta Delt house or
John Elway firing baseballs like rifle
shots from right field to home plate, I
always wanted to go to Stanford.
That said, the relationship be
tween a father and his son is often a
complicated one. At some point in
our lives, just about everybody has to
tangle with the marks that a father
(or the absence of a father) leaves on
us. Some of the things that we bear
from our fathers are easy to under
stand maybe you're a Packers fan
because your dad is from Wisconsin
but other times, there are things
that you never understand or don't
understand until years into the fu
ture. Like at the 2004 Masters golf
tournament, when my dad told me a

major business deal he'd been work
ing on had fallen through. Eight
years and three career changes later,
I now know just how significant that
small moment was for my dad, a mo
ment shared with a son through the
medium of sports.
It hasn't always been easy, but
eventually, I think most people real
ize that their fathers are, in many
ways, just like themselves real
people with hopes and disappoint
ments of their own. I know I've had
that realization in these last four
years, here at the same place my dad
went to school 25 years ago. And
without my father, I know I wouldn't
be here today, and I definitely would
n't be who I am today. So that's why,
in my last column for The Stanford
Daily.ljust wanted to make sure and
say thanks, Dad.
To my loyal readers, thank you
too. It's been one of the most pro
found pleasures of my life to write
for The Daily for the past two years.
And take some time today to thank
your dad and tell him you love him.
Or just go to a ballgame with him. In
many ways, it's the same thing.

Jack Blanchat looks forward to
being a dad himself â€” in the very
distant future. Send him your best
