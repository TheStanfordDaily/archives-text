# Need to rebuild at Daily, too

All good things must
come to an end, and so
it is that the Class of
2012 a group that
can name football
quarterback Andrew Luck and
women's basketball forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike among its
ranks â€”is finally leaving us. The
world of collegiate athletics is a
cruel one, and the life of a college
star is almost always shorter than it
is sweet. Both Luck and Ogwumike
leave as number one picks in their
respective drafts and with title and
school records to then names, but
with their ultimate college ambi
tions unrealized: neither managed
to get their hands on a national title.
Pro sports teams can build lega
cies on the shoulders of key players.
Manchester United, for example,
has won 12 out of the 20 seasons
since the inception of the Premier
League and throughout that time
has relied on the talents of midfield
ers Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.
Even now, with their youthful ener
gies fading, they remain key mem
bers of the club.

College teams, meanwhile, must
cope with losing their best players
every four years, and even more fre
quently when athletes jump ship
early to launch professional careers.
With such a rapid turnover of play
ers, it is incredibly hard to build mo
mentum and retain sufficient expe
rience and leadership in a team year
after year.
Luck and Ogwumike are impos
sibly fortunate individuals. Many
Stanford stars, legends in their own
backyard, must wake up from the
dream now. Perhaps their sport just
doesn't receive nearly the same sort
of monetary support in the profes
sional world as in the collegiate one,
or perhaps, regardless of the records
they may have set here or the im
portance they have held in their
team, they just don't have the right
physique or skills to get paid to do
what they love.
As each sport's season has come
