# Need to rebuild at Daily, too
## 
### Tom Taylor 
All good things must
come to an end, and so
it is that the Class of
2012 a group that
can name football
quarterback Andrew Luck and
women's basketball forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike among its
ranks —is finally leaving us. The
world of collegiate athletics is a
cruel one, and the life of a college
star is almost always shorter than it
is sweet. Both Luck and Ogwumike
leave as number one picks in their
respective drafts and with title and
school records to then names, but
with their ultimate college ambi
tions unrealized: neither managed
to get their hands on a national title.
Pro sports teams can build lega
cies on the shoulders of key players.
Manchester United, for example,
has won 12 out of the 20 seasons
since the inception of the Premier
League and throughout that time
has relied on the talents of midfield
ers Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.
Even now, with their youthful ener
gies fading, they remain key mem
bers of the club.

College teams, meanwhile, must
cope with losing their best players
every four years, and even more fre
quently when athletes jump ship
early to launch professional careers.
With such a rapid turnover of play
ers, it is incredibly hard to build mo
mentum and retain sufficient expe
rience and leadership in a team year
after year.
Luck and Ogwumike are impos
sibly fortunate individuals. Many
Stanford stars, legends in their own
backyard, must wake up from the
dream now. Perhaps their sport just
doesn't receive nearly the same sort
of monetary support in the profes
sional world as in the collegiate one,
or perhaps, regardless of the records
they may have set here or the im
portance they have held in their
team, they just don't have the right
physique or skills to get paid to do
what they love.
As each sport's season has come
to an end over the course of this last
year, many graduating seniors will
have been given a farewell at their
final home games on the Farm. As
students, though, most have stayed
around finishing up classes and,per
haps, finally getting to enjoy life
here without the punishing de
mands of being a college athlete.
Now, though, the end has finally ar
rived. Life just got real.
Beyond the athletic depart
ment, other students will be facing
the same fate. My own time on the
Farm is not yet over, but The Daily
itself will be a very different place
come fall quarter. Hardest hit will
be the sports department: the cur
rent managing editor, three out of
five desk editors and the same num
ber of regular columnists will be
gone.
I try not to name-check too
much in the opinions I write here,
but I hope you excuse me this indul
gence. Among those leaving are a
host of names that should be more
than familiar to regular followers of
Cardinal athletics: media stars who
have brought you the action in both
this newspaper and on KZSU over
the last few years, but who, unless
ESPN comes knocking, will now
have to learn how to be just fans

My first-ever sports managing
editor, the guy who first gave me a
chance writing on men's soccer,
Zach Zimmerman, and the current
incumbent, Jack Blanchat.The only
editor for whom I've completely
missed a deadline and failed to turn
in a story, Jacob "Jake" Jaffe
sorry! and the as-yet-unwilling
to-move-on Caroline Caselli (she'll

be working in the business office
next year).

Last but not least, I must men
tion Sam Svoboda why do all
good sports reporters' first and last
names begin with the same letter?

and Nate Adams. Both have
since flirted with other roles at this
paper Sam technically graduat
ed last year but hung around as vice
president of sales, and Nate has
floated around as "editor at large"
but will always be sportswriters
in my mind.
There are more of you, too. Peo
ple I should thank but I don't have
space to mention here because
that's not entirely the justification
for writing this column. What I real
ly wanted to do was draw an analo
gy to the very teams these folks
have written about.

None of these organizations are
going anywhere. There will still be a
football team, basketball teams and
even this newspaper on campus
next year. But they will look and
feel a lot different. Standards are al
ways high at Stanford, and, for ex
ample, Luck's position at quarter
back is going to be a very big hole to
fill.

Perhaps, though, this is what
makes life at university so interest
ing. Clearing out the seasoned tal
ent, space is left for new stars to rise
and others to step out of the shad
ows. Teams rebuild because they
must, and we fans never have
enough time to get bored with the
status quo. And as much as we'll
miss these seniors, by September
we'll be inspired, frustrated and
thrilled by those brand new fresh
men.

Tom Taylor is never, ever leaving
Stanford, or The Daily for that mat
ter. Tell him to make room for some
younger guns at tom.taylor@stan

ranks —is finally leaving us. The
world of collegiate athletics is a
cruel one, and the life of a college
star is almost always shorter than it
is sweet. Both Luck and Ogwumike
leave as number one picks in their
respective drafts and with title and
school records to then names, but
with their ultimate college ambi
tions unrealized: neither managed
to get their hands on a national title.
Pro sports teams can build lega
cies on the shoulders of key players.
Manchester United, for example,
has won 12 out of the 20 seasons
since the inception of the Premier
League and throughout that time
has relied on the talents of midfield
ers Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.
Even now, with their youthful ener
gies fading, they remain key mem
bers of the club.

College teams, meanwhile, must
cope with losing their best players
every four years, and even more fre
quently when athletes jump ship
early to launch professional careers.
With such a rapid turnover of play
ers, it is incredibly hard to build mo
mentum and retain sufficient expe
rience and leadership in a team year
after year.
Luck and Ogwumike are impos
sibly fortunate individuals. Many
Stanford stars, legends in their own
backyard, must wake up from the
dream now. Perhaps their sport just
doesn't receive nearly the same sort
of monetary support in the profes
sional world as in the collegiate one,
or perhaps, regardless of the records
they may have set here or the im
portance they have held in their
team, they just don't have the right
physique or skills to get paid to do
what they love.
As each sport's season has come
to an end over the course of this last
year, many graduating seniors will
have been given a farewell at their
final home games on the Farm. As
students, though, most have stayed
around finishing up classes and,per
haps, finally getting to enjoy life
here without the punishing de
mands of being a college athlete.
Now, though, the end has finally ar
rived. Life just got real.
Beyond the athletic depart
ment, other students will be facing
the same fate. My own time on the
Farm is not yet over, but The Daily
itself will be a very different place
come fall quarter. Hardest hit will
be the sports department: the cur
rent managing editor, three out of
five desk editors and the same num
ber of regular columnists will be
gone.
I try not to name-check too
much in the opinions I write here,
but I hope you excuse me this indul
gence. Among those leaving are a
host of names that should be more
than familiar to regular followers of
Cardinal athletics: media stars who
have brought you the action in both
this newspaper and on KZSU over
the last few years, but who, unless
ESPN comes knocking, will now
have to learn how to be just fans

My first-ever sports managing
editor, the guy who first gave me a
chance writing on men's soccer,
Zach Zimmerman, and the current
incumbent, Jack Blanchat.The only
editor for whom I've completely
missed a deadline and failed to turn
in a story, Jacob "Jake" Jaffe
sorry! and the as-yet-unwilling
to-move-on Caroline Caselli (she'll

be working in the business office
next year).

Last but not least, I must men
tion Sam Svoboda why do all
good sports reporters' first and last
names begin with the same letter?

and Nate Adams. Both have
since flirted with other roles at this
paper Sam technically graduat
ed last year but hung around as vice
president of sales, and Nate has
floated around as "editor at large"
but will always be sportswriters
in my mind.
There are more of you, too. Peo
ple I should thank but I don't have
space to mention here because
that's not entirely the justification
for writing this column. What I real
ly wanted to do was draw an analo
gy to the very teams these folks
have written about.

None of these organizations are
going anywhere. There will still be a
football team, basketball teams and
even this newspaper on campus
next year. But they will look and
feel a lot different. Standards are al
ways high at Stanford, and, for ex
ample, Luck's position at quarter
back is going to be a very big hole to
fill.

Perhaps, though, this is what
makes life at university so interest
ing. Clearing out the seasoned tal
ent, space is left for new stars to rise
and others to step out of the shad
ows. Teams rebuild because they
must, and we fans never have
enough time to get bored with the
status quo. And as much as we'll
miss these seniors, by September
we'll be inspired, frustrated and
thrilled by those brand new fresh
men.

Tom Taylor is never, ever leaving
Stanford, or The Daily for that mat
ter. Tell him to make room for some
