Karl Eikenberry's office
in Encina Hall's East
Wing holds hints of a
decorated, controver
sial and adventurous
past. Books on politics and history
line the shelves, pictures and certifi
cates hang on the walls and an
Afghan rug is laid out on the floor.
Eikenberry M.A. '94 has had a
distinguished military and diplo
matic career. Prior to his current
position as the Payne Distin
guished Lecturer at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies (FSI), he spent 35 years in
the United States Army. As U.S.
ambassador to Afghanistan from
May 2009 to June 2011, he led Pres
ident Obama's civilian surge, which
occurred in conjunction with a
30,000-troop surge.
Eikenberry, with his soft-spo
ken manner and friendly disposi
tion, recalled how his father would
discuss his World War II experi
ences in the Asia Pacific region
over dinner at his home in Golds
boro.N.C.
"I still consider Goldsboro
home," Eikenberry said, pulling
out the key to the city, which was
given to him by Goldsboro's mayor
in August 2007.
In 1969, Eikenberry left Golds
boro for the United States Military

Academy at West Point. He re
ceived a letter from the Dean of the
Department of Foreign Languages
requiring him to study two years of
a foreign language.
"I looked down the list and saw
French, but I was already studying
it," Eikenberry said. "I wanted
something new and exciting. I saw
Russian and that was the time of
the height of the Cold War but then
I saw Chinese and thought that was
the most exotic."
The decision led Eikenberry
down a path that would see the flu
ent Mandarin speaker form close
connections with China and the
Asia Pacific region.
On May 17,2012, Foreign Policy
magazine published an article by
Eikenberry titled "Stop Ignoring
Taiwan," in which he argued for re
vitalizing diplomatic and economic
relations between Taiwan and the
U.S. in the face of China's econom
ic and military ascendance.
"Over three decades we have
quite skillfully managed to balance
commitments to Taiwan and con
tinuing to evolve our complicated
relationship with China," he said.
"Going forward, with good
diplomacy skills we can maintain
this balance but... there's going to
be points in time where we have to
make difficult decisions," he added.
Eikenberry acknowledged
President Obama's "pivot" toward
Asia, citing China's growing mar

itime claims as a key issue.
"Since World War 11, the U.S.
had the assumption that we have
complete mastery of the military in
the Pacific Ocean. As China rises it
will challenge our assumption of
complete supremacy how to
manage this is the question," he
said.

Despite his connection to China
and Asia, it is Eikenberry's efforts
in Afghanistan that have been the
most noted. Before becoming am
bassador, he served two tours in
Afghanistan. His first tour was as
security coordinator and chief of
the Office of Military Cooperation
from September 2002 to Septem
ber 2003, and during his second,

from 2005 to 2007, he served as
commander of the American-led
coalition forces.

Eikenberry summarized his ex
perience as U.S. ambassador to
Afghanistan as "extraordinarily in
tense."

"The mission was complicated,
the expectations in Washington
were understandably very high and
in the strategy we were implement
ing, time mattered," he said.
Despite his intense focus on the
mission, the people of Afghanistan
left the most profound effect on
Eikenberry.
"These are a people that have
been through three decades of
unimaginable horror, conflict, war.

Some of the stories we heard from
them are almost untellable," he
said. "Yet here was a group of peo
ple who had still retained their
pride and a very strong, compelling
culture."

"There is a saying that when we
leave Afghanistan, we leave a part
of our hearts behind this was
certainly so for me and my wife," he
said.

According to Eikenberry, his
frequent walks through Afghan
bazaars with his wife, Ching, led
him to be dubbed as the "The
Afghan People's Ambassador" by
locals.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry now serves as the Payne Distinguished Lecturer at the
Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Eikenberry, whose military and diplomatic career has
spanned almost four decades, led President Obama's civilian surge in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011.
"Given the nature of the mis
sion, Afghans can get frustrated
with necessary military opera
tions," he said. "Putting the face of
the U.S. embassy out there was im
portant and helped mitigate the
frustration Afghans understand
ably felt with the international mil
itary forces."
The relationship between
Afghans and U.S. troops has been
tumultuous, with civilian deaths a
major issue of contention.
However, Eikenberry remains
adamant that the war was neces
sary after 9/11, stating that "the no
tion to just ignore Afghanistan was
not an option."
"I would have disagreements
with aspects of strategy in
Afghanistan but never questioned

whether we needed to be there," he
said.
Eikenberry stated that the core
of the mission was to "harden"
Afghanistan so that it would be
come a state with "a reliable gov
ernment, an accountable security
force, an appropriate justice sys
tem and a significant economy so
that it will no longer be a sanctuary
of international terrorism to attack
the U.S. and its allies."
"I don't classify this [the war in
Afghanistan] as winning or losing.
We are attempting to help the
Afghan people achieve progress
and make sure we will not be
threatened by international terror
ism," Eikenberry said.
Flere at Stanford, the sandstone
arches and palm trees put Eiken
berry in a world startlingly differ
ent from that of the bustling streets
of downtown Kabul or the rugged
terrain of the AfPak mountainous
border.
When not in his office, Eiken

berry can be seen at the gym seven
days a week, taking a break at the
CoHo and even recruiting poten
tial football players for Stanford.
Although he enjoys biking, he said
at Stanford, "biking sometimes
makes me think that I'm in Bei
jing-"
"What I love about the Stanford
campus is the combination of the
aesthetics and the sense of serious
ness and purpose," he said. "What I
see in terms of the caliber of students
is extraordinary these are the fu
ture leaders of our society."
He particularly enjoys speaking
to students about their future ca
reer paths, relying on advice his fa
ther once gave him.
"When it comes to the end of
the day in life's journey and what
you see in the mirror makes you
smile then you can say you did rea
sonably well," he said.
