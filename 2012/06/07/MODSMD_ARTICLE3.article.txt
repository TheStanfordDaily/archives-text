## Bing Concert Hall nears completion 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford hopes to use next year's opening
of the Bing Concert Hall as an opportunity to
better integrate the arts into campus life and
to engage with local communities, the Univer
sity announced Monday at an event that also
included the introduction of Stanford's re
branding of its four-decade-old performing
arts program.
Stanford Live will replace Stanford Lively
Arts, the previous organization tasked with
helping to cultivate the performing arts on
campus. Its inaugural season will begin Janu
ary 2013 when the Bing Concert Hall holds its
first performance.
"Engaging with surrounding communities
is going to be a priority for us," said Bing Con
cert Hall Managing Director Wiley Hausam.
"A second priority is to build new audiences."
The $111.9 million concert hall named
after the financial supporters of the project,
Helen and Peter Bing '55 is expected to
open on schedule and on budget, the Univer
sity announced. The theme of the opening
weekend's performances is a celebration of
the Bay Area.
"Bing Concert Hall is a shared facility,"
said Stephen Hinton, faculty director of the
Arts Initiative and the Stanford Institute for
Creativity and the Arts. "It doesn't belong ex
clusively to any groups on campus, but it's also

for local artists."
Hinton said that Stanford Live and the new
concert hall will help students complete the re
cently revised breadth requirements that in
clude courses in aesthetic and interpretive in
quiry and creative expression.
"The University is committed to integrat
ing the arts in its curriculum as an extension of
the classroom," Hinton said. "We will link the
[concert hall] schedule to other events on
campus. For example, I will be teaching a
freshman seminar next year, and we will use
the schedule as a cycle for our class."
Another plan for integrating the arts with
the rest of campus is the Beethoven Project.
Various groups' performances of all of
Beethoven's symphonies and piano concertos
in the 2013 season will coincide with a sympo

sium of international scholars called "Hero
ism in the Age of Beethoven."
Hausam added that this academic inter
twining is aimed to attract students who prob
ably would not otherwise be inclined to attend
a Beethoven concert.
"There is a sense of social exchange and dy
namic energy within the hall," said Jenny Bil
field, the artistic and executive director of
Stanford Lively Arts. "The University campus
is the performing arts center of the 21st centu
ry with its integrated and interdisciplinary ap
proach."
Bilfield also stressed the intimacy of the
venue, with its 844-person seating capacity and
unique "vineyard" shape designed by acousti-

Acoustics, who was also in charge
of the acoustics at the Disney Con
cert Hall in Los Angeles and the
New World Symphony in Miami.
Bilfield noted that not just the stage
itself which is sunken in the cen
ter of the hall but also practice
rooms, a recording studio and an
underground rehearsal hall were
designed with minimal right angles
for the ideal acoustic experience.

Ennead Architects, which was
contracted for the 1999 expansion
of the Cantor Arts Center, led the
overall design of the concert hall.
Though the concert hall is set to
be completed before the end of the
calendar year, this deadline does
not mean that development of the
venue will cease. Bilfield said that
performers will experiment with
different forms of presentation on
the hall's unique stage, which is sur
rounded by audience seating on all
sides, presenting a significant dif
ference from the traditional "box
stage."

"As we begin to work with this
space, we can develop its uses," Bil
field said. "It's up to the imagina
tion of the visitors and the perform
ers."

The schedule for the concert
hall's first season which will ex
tend from Jan. 11,2013, to June 1,
2013 includes more than 40 per
formances. The pre-season events,
Harmony for Humanity on Oct. 3
and Grammy Award winning
Chanticleer on Dec. 11, will be held
in Memorial Church this fall.

Featured performances in 2013
will include cellist Yo-Yo Ma with
pianist Kathryn Stott, violinist Mi
dori with pianist Ozgur Aydin, pi
anist Emanuel Ax and vocal groups
Cappella Romana and the New
York Polyphony.
Stanford student groups will
also appear at the venue through
out the season. In addition to inde
pendent student performances,
artists such as singer Vusi
Mahlasela, who has a history of
working with the a capella group
Stanford Talisman, will involve stu
dents with their appearances at the
concert hall.
