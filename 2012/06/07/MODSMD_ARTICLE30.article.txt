# Seminoles and travel make for tall task
## 
### Mosbacher Minute JACK MOSBACHER STAFF WRITER 
Jack Mosbacher was a member of
the Stanford baseball team from
2008-2011. Each week, he takes a
look at the Cardinal's ups and
downs on its road to the College
World Series.

This is was what I was afraid of
all along.
The good news is that the Stan
ford Cardinal easily won its re
gional and punched its ticket to
the Super Regionals, just one step
short of the coveted College
World Series in Omaha, Neb. The
bad news is that the Cardinal now
has to travel to Tallahassee and
face a Florida State team that
spent the majority of the 2012 sea
son as the country's top-ranked
team.

Those who have followed my
writing this season may have
grown weary of my constant talk
of the importance of obtaining
one of the top eight "national
seeds" for the postseason tourna
ment and, in doing so, securing the
right to host a Super Regional.
This weekend, my friends, is my
case in point. Super Regionals are
always tough the last 16 teams
alive in the tournament each year
are always talented and capable of
beating one another but win
ning on the road is an even more
daunting task.
First and foremost, Florida
State can flat-out play. This year's
team won the regular season At
lantic Coast Conference title be
fore getting knocked out early in
the conference's postseason tour
nament. The Seminoles spent a
large portion of the season as the
nation's top-ranked team, their

regular season performance high
lighted by sweeps of eventual
ACC postseason champions
Georgia Tech and future regional
hosts Miami and Virginia. Though
the Seminoles are a young team,
they had three players selected in
the top seven rounds of this
week's Major League Baseball
Draft. Simply put, they're loaded.
On top of their on-field talent,
the Seminoles boast one of the
country's great home-field advan
tages. Not only do Florida State
games attract almost 5,000 fans a
night (compared to roughly 1,500
on the Farm), but their fans are
also among the most knowledge
able and intense in the game. To
put it lightly, a game at Dick
Howser Stadium is a different ex
perience entirely than one at idyl
lic Sunken Diamond. When it
steps onto the field, the Cardinal is
going to feel much further away
from home than the 2,500 miles
that already separate Palo Alto
and Tallahasse e.
The heritage of Florida State's
fans is best exemplified by their
most famous tradition. The actual
origin of this tradition is still hotly
contested even among Semi
nole fans themselves so I'll just
tell it the way I first heard it.
Sometime in the 1980s a team
came to Tallahassee with a roster
including a pitcher from Canada,
and the Seminole fans had done
their research. When this pitcher
was called into the game in the
fifth inning, the entire crowd sere
naded him with a hearty a cappel
la rendition of Canada's national
anthem, "O Canada," repeating
the song several times as he tossed
his warm-up pitches. The Semi


ALISA ROYER/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford baseball team made short work of its home regional last
weekend, but the road ahead gets much more difficult for the Cardinal,
as it must travel across the country to take on the Florida State Seminoles,
a team that spent much of the season as the nation's top-ranked team.
nole offense subsequently put to
gether a huge rally against the
poor Canuck and won the game.
In every contest at Dick Howser
Stadium since that day, the Semi
nole fans have risen from their
seats in the fifth inning and sung
"O Canada." Made of equal parts
humor and intimidation, this tra
dition perfectly personifies the
lion's den into which the Cardinal
will descend this weekend.
This is what I was afraid of
when Stanford was swept by Ari
zona and lost a pair of crucial se
ries to Oregon and Oregon State.
This is why it was so important for
Stanford to secure home-field ad
vantage for the entire playoffs.
For the first time this year, and for
the most important series of the
year, Stanford has to play as an
underdog.
And this has all of the makings
of one heck of a story.
Before the season started,
everyone knew that the 2012
Stanford Cardinal was among the
most talented teams in school his
tory and among the deepest in the
country. In the first few series of
the year, the team displayed its
prodigious potential, swatting

away powerhouse programs like
flies and ascending to the top
ranking in the land.
Then, the Cardinal struggled. It
lost one series, and then another.
Key players fell to season-ending
injuries.The country's most potent
offense fell silent. Darkness had
descended. All seemed lost.
But it battled back. Stanford
showed remarkable resilience,
climbing into contention for the
Pac-12 title before a disappoint
ing series loss to Cal in the season
finale.
Today, as the Cardinal boards
a plane for Tallahassee, the play
ers know that they'll need to play
the best baseball of their lives if
they hope to pass through the last
gauntlet between here and
Omaha. They'll have to ignore the
deafening cheers and angry in
sults of college baseball's tough
est fans (and struggle through
what's guaranteed to be biased
home field umpiring). They'll
have to play hungry, relentless,
fearless baseball.
In short, the odds are stacked
against the Card. But the stage is
set for what could turn out to be
the dramatic, penultimate chap
ter of the greatest story of their
lives.
I, for one, can't wait to watch.
