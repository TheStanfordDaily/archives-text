## Execs to hire ASSU cabinet over summer Zimbroff, Wagstaff spend first five weeks on 'adminstrative' tasks 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
After five weeks in office, ASSU Pres
ident Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice Pres
ident William Wagstaff 'l2 have yet to
make cabinet staffing decisions. Accord
ing to Zimbroff, the two have been work
ing on completing administrative tasks
and will begin tackling larger initiatives
during the summer.
"I think something we were reluctant
to do is to rush into things just to say that
we have them done," Zimbroff said.

Zimbroff said he would assemble his
cabinet over the summer by communi
cating with and interviewing potential
candidates via Skype, phone calls and
email.

"We're just looking for people with
good heads on their shoulders and who
know generally how the campus oper
ates," he said.
In previous years, the ASSU
Executive team has chosen to an
nounce their cabinet selections
before the end of spring quarter.
Last year, former ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3 announced their cabinet selec
tions during the first week of June.
In 2010, former ASSU President
Angelina Cardona 'll and Vice
President Kelsei Wharton 'l2 an
nounced their picks during the
second week of May.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff both
said that they hope Stanford stu
dents understand that although
their administration has not been
sending out emails to alert stu
dents of their progress, they are
getting things done.
"We've been doing a lot of be
hind-the-scenes work," Zimbroff
said. "We have to get the less sexy,
more proscribed stuff out of the
way before we can do the real
work."
He said at the beginning of the
term " people dump a ton of stuff
on your plate,"
"You have to clear that stuff off
in order to move forward with
what you want to do," Zimbroff
said.
One of the projects that Zim
broff has been trying to "clear off
his plate" is the appointment of
students through the Nomina

tions Commission (NomCom),
which Zimbroff said his adminis
tration has now completed.
"I don't need to send a cam
pus-wide email saying what I've
accomplished," Zimbroff said. "I
think that's something students
don't like about the ASSU.
"The majority of Stanford stu
dents aren't going to be upset that
the ASSU isn't flooding their in
boxes," he added.
NomCom is responsible for
screening and appointing student
representatives to committees
and boards across campus. During
the previous ASSU administra
tion, no new NomCom members
were recruited because the ASSU
Executives assumed that an
amended constitution, which in
cluded a reformed NomCom
process, would pass, according to
Zimbroff. However, the constitu
tion did not pass, leaving the
ASSU with no way to appoint stu
dents to University committees.
"This wasn't something we
planned on or campaigned on, but
it was something we needed to
do," Zimbroff said of appointing
students through the NomCom
process.
The ASSU Executives will be
taking a break from ASSU activi
ties over Dead Week and exam
week in order to focus on their
studies. However, once their aca
demic obligations are over, the
pair plans on resuming planning
for the 2012-13 school year.
Zimbroff said that he and
Wagstaff plan on talking with ad
ministrators about how to prepare

for next school year while they are
on campus over the summer.
"We see this summer as a great
way to hit the ground running,"
Zimbroff said.
One specific plan that Zim
broff discussed for the upcoming
school year was to bring food
trucks to campus or have better
food-delivery options for students
late at night. He said that, over the
summer, he and Wagstaff will be
negotiating with campus adminis
trators and local restaurants in
order to get these options ready
for the fall.
The pair has also made a point
of saying that although they do
have plans that they want the
ASSU leadership to spearhead
for next school year, they also
want ASSU leaders to feel com
fortable in a supporting role on
campus.
"I don't feel compelled to roll
out a slew of sustainability initia
tives," Zimbroff said, citing one
example of the philosophy in
practice. "I think the ASSU should
play a supporting role for groups
who are already doing a great job
with sustainability initiatives on
campus."
Zimbroff stressed a need for
practicality in the job of ASSU ex
ecutive.
"You don't always have to
have a new revolutionary pro
gram and do it two weeks after
taking office," Zimbroff said.
"You just have to do what works."

pus-wide email saying what I've
accomplished," Zimbroff said. "I
think that's something students
don't like about the ASSU.
"The majority of Stanford stu
dents aren't going to be upset that
the ASSU isn't flooding their in
boxes," he added.
NomCom is responsible for
screening and appointing student
representatives to committees
and boards across campus. During
the previous ASSU administra
tion, no new NomCom members
were recruited because the ASSU
Executives assumed that an
amended constitution, which in
cluded a reformed NomCom
process, would pass, according to
Zimbroff. However, the constitu
tion did not pass, leaving the
ASSU with no way to appoint stu
dents to University committees.
"This wasn't something we
planned on or campaigned on, but
it was something we needed to
do," Zimbroff said of appointing
students through the NomCom
process.
The ASSU Executives will be
taking a break from ASSU activi
ties over Dead Week and exam
week in order to focus on their
studies. However, once their aca
demic obligations are over, the
pair plans on resuming planning
for the 2012-13 school year.
Zimbroff said that he and
Wagstaff plan on talking with ad
ministrators about how to prepare

for next school year while they are
on campus over the summer.
"We see this summer as a great
way to hit the ground running,"
Zimbroff said.
One specific plan that Zim
broff discussed for the upcoming
school year was to bring food
trucks to campus or have better
food-delivery options for students
late at night. He said that, over the
summer, he and Wagstaff will be
negotiating with campus adminis
trators and local restaurants in
order to get these options ready
for the fall.
The pair has also made a point
of saying that although they do
have plans that they want the
ASSU leadership to spearhead
for next school year, they also
want ASSU leaders to feel com
fortable in a supporting role on
campus.
"I don't feel compelled to roll
out a slew of sustainability initia
tives," Zimbroff said, citing one
example of the philosophy in
practice. "I think the ASSU should
play a supporting role for groups
who are already doing a great job
with sustainability initiatives on
campus."
Zimbroff stressed a need for
practicality in the job of ASSU ex
ecutive.
"You don't always have to
have a new revolutionary pro
gram and do it two weeks after
taking office," Zimbroff said.
"You just have to do what works."

After five weeks in office, ASSU Pres
ident Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice Pres
ident William Wagstaff 'l2 have yet to
make cabinet staffing decisions. Accord
ing to Zimbroff, the two have been work
ing on completing administrative tasks
and will begin tackling larger initiatives
during the summer.
"I think something we were reluctant
to do is to rush into things just to say that
we have them done," Zimbroff said.

Zimbroff said he would assemble his
cabinet over the summer by communi
cating with and interviewing potential
candidates via Skype, phone calls and
email.

"We're just looking for people with
good heads on their shoulders and who
know generally how the campus oper
ates," he said.
In previous years, the ASSU
Executive team has chosen to an
nounce their cabinet selections
before the end of spring quarter.
Last year, former ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3 announced their cabinet selec
tions during the first week of June.
In 2010, former ASSU President
Angelina Cardona 'll and Vice
President Kelsei Wharton 'l2 an
nounced their picks during the
second week of May.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff both
said that they hope Stanford stu
dents understand that although
their administration has not been
sending out emails to alert stu
dents of their progress, they are
getting things done.
"We've been doing a lot of be
hind-the-scenes work," Zimbroff
said. "We have to get the less sexy,
more proscribed stuff out of the
way before we can do the real
work."
He said at the beginning of the
term " people dump a ton of stuff
on your plate,"
"You have to clear that stuff off
in order to move forward with
what you want to do," Zimbroff
said.
One of the projects that Zim
broff has been trying to "clear off
his plate" is the appointment of
students through the Nomina

tions Commission (NomCom),
which Zimbroff said his adminis
tration has now completed.
"I don't need to send a cam
pus-wide email saying what I've
accomplished," Zimbroff said. "I
think that's something students
don't like about the ASSU.
