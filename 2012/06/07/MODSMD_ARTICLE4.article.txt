### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
After five weeks in office, ASSU Pres
ident Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice Pres
ident William Wagstaff 'l2 have yet to
make cabinet staffing decisions. Accord
ing to Zimbroff, the two have been work
ing on completing administrative tasks
and will begin tackling larger initiatives
during the summer.
"I think something we were reluctant
to do is to rush into things just to say that
we have them done," Zimbroff said.

Zimbroff said he would assemble his
cabinet over the summer by communi
cating with and interviewing potential
candidates via Skype, phone calls and
email.

"We're just looking for people with
good heads on their shoulders and who
know generally how the campus oper
ates," he said.
