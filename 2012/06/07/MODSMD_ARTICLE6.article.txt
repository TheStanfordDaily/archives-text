## Biodesign forges connections 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is a rarity as one of eight universi
ties in the United States with strong ties be
tween its medical and engineering schools, with
hundreds of pieces of research resulting from
the collaboration. Officials from the School of
Engineering and the School of Medicine said
that this collaboration is largely grass roots,
springing out of faculty familiarity and mutual

interests.
"The collaboration almost never comes
from top down from the administrative level,
but is rather based on individual faculty or stu
dents meeting each other, talking about what
they do and finding a common or complemen
tary interest," said Russ Altman, chair of the
Bioengineering Department.
Stanford does, however, offer some grant
programs, such as BioX, in which
the school specifically asks for
grant proposals that require a
team of two or more investigators
who have never worked together.
This requirement encourages in
teraction between faculty mem
bers of different departments.
Another such program is the
biodesign program, which trains
students from these different
fields in inventing and implement
ing new biomedical technologies.
"In our designed program, fel
lows come in for either one or two
academic years and are placed in
teams half comprised of engineers
that either have a master's or
Ph.D. degree as well as two years
of work experience and the other
half doctors that are at their resi
dency point," said Ari Chaney, ex
ecutive director for technology
translation for the biodesign pro
gram. "Our teams represent our
beliefs a combination of engi
neers and medicine skills leads to
the best patient impact."
The biodesign program, start
ed 11 years ago, is an example of
how the medical and engineering
disciplines recognize the values of
one another. Chaney said that the
most important part is the process
contributing teams undergo.
"Almost like a boot camp,"
Chaney said of the experience.
"We bring engineers and doctors
to a common denominator where
engineers know what issues there
are in the medical field as well as
the doctors understand the same
vice versa."

Through clinical immersion, the
biodesign program challenges the
teams to find and address clinical
needs. Altman said that it is key
that the collaborators have differ
ent specialties, each relevant to a
research question.There is no pro
fessor matching and a lot of col
laborative work comes from indi
vidual researchers' interest in the
work of others, he noted.
Altman calls this method "bot
tom-up" collaboration and often
encourages faculty to work with
others by recommending poten
tial collaborators.

"A close relationship between
engineering and medicine is very
natural," Altman said. "The med
ical doctor teams up with an engi
neer to make a product that could
help a patient."
According to Altman, working
with graduate students is another
way different faculty members get
to know each other.
"A graduate student's thesis
committee is made up of three or
four faculty members, and they get
to know and talk to one another,"
he said.
The student can serve as a vehi
cle of faculty interaction.
"Often one of the challenges is
that, though faculty may have a
collaboration idea, there is no one
available to do the work," Altman
said. "When a graduate student ar
rives, they're obviously the one
that is going to be doing the work
and learning techniques from dif
ferent departments."
Once collaboration is estab
lished, generally, the members
teaming up negotiate first, settling
on authorship and how to allocate
credit. This prevents researchers
from having the wrong expecta
tions entering into collaboration.
"A huge aspect of the collabo
ration is of personal compatibili
ty," said Altman, who compared

the process to dating. "In addition
to being a good match in expert
ise, it's important that the collabo
rators get along."
Altman attributes the produc
tive relationship partly to the
physical proximity of the School
of Medicine to the School of Engi
neering, since the move of the
School of Medicine from San
Francisco to Palo Alto in 1959.
"All the schools are on the
same campus, coming in from all
different parts of the University
operating at high levels of expert
ise," Altman said.

Chaney also recognized the
rich resources that being in Silicon
Valley offers to the collaborations.
"In the early stages of the proj
ects, entrepreneurs from the area
can provide funding or experi
enced managers," he said. "And ul
timately, the collaborations can
make a difference to patients and
to health."

In the future, Altman sees only

a closer interaction between the
two schools.

"There is going to be a new bio
engineering and chemical engi
neering building that will have an
animal facility that will be for the
engineering school," Altman
noted. "It's going to create an easy
gateway between engineers and
the medical school."

The building, which will host
teaching labs and lecture halls on
the first floor and offer shared fa
cilities in the basement, is expect
ed to be completed by the summer
of 2014. Altman predicted that all
the engineering departments in

general "are going to be seeing a
lot more biology."
Stanford Hospital is undergo
ing a major expansion campaign,
and while the new construction
doesn't directly impact the collab
oration between the School of
Medicine and School of Engineer
ing, Altman said that the best clin
ical fellows are likely to be attract
ed to the Stanford School of Med
icine and are likely to take advan
tage of the collaboration to inno
vate.
