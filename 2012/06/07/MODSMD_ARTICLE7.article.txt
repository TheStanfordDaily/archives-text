## Univ. revenue, expenses to rise next fiscal year 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The 2012-13 budget will reflect the
University's "very strong financial posi
tion" in the allocation of funds to aca
demic, administrative and auxiliary
units, according to University officials,
as both revenues and expenses are pro
jected to rise from previous years.
Vice Provost for Budget and Auxil
iaries Management Tim Warner MBA
'77 formally presented the budget plan
at the May 31 meeting of the Faculty
Senate. The budget will be submitted to
the Board of Trustees for approval in
June.

"We're in a strong financial position
not quite where we were prior to the
recession, but gaining back," Warner
wrote in an email to The Daily.
In composing the budget, Warner
emphasized continuity in spending pri
orities from previous years, with sus
tained focuses on strengthening budget
ary support for undergraduate financial
aid and boosting the University's com
petitive faculty salary position.
Warner also acknowledged the im
pact of a struggling economic recovery
and potential government cuts in the
budget plan. Federal direct research
funding of which the University (ex
cluding the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory) currently anticipates $478
million in 2012-13 constitutes over 10
percent of projected University rev
enues.

"These are both issues we are keep

ing a sharp eye on," Warner wrote.
"They are also why we are budgeting a
surplus next year in General Funds so
that we have some cushion in the event
of shortfalls in investment income and
research funding."
The University will also retain many
of the budget cuts made at the height of
the economic recession. While funding
for programs such as Overseas Semi
nars and Sophomore College has been
restored, Warner told the Faculty Senate
on May 31 that the program of cuts is
"really starting to pay off."
Consolidated expenses for the 2012-
13 fiscal year total $4,096.3 million and
are divided among expenses incurred by
the University's academic units in
cluding its seven schools and those
incurred by administrative and auxiliary
units.
Consolidated revenues for the 2012-
13 fiscal year will total $4,443.4 million.
Academic units
The University's academic units will
incur a projected $3,367.8 million in
consolidated expenses next year,
though the amounts disbursed to indi
vidual academic units vary greatly.
The School of Medicine will receive
43 percent of all academic unit expenses
next year, totaling $1,459.6 million. The
school expects an overall surplus of
$21.2 million next year, compared to this
year's $18.9 million surplus.
