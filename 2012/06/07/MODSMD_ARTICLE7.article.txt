## Univ. revenue, expenses to rise next fiscal year 
### MARSHALL WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The 2012-13 budget will reflect the
University's "very strong financial posi
tion" in the allocation of funds to aca
demic, administrative and auxiliary
units, according to University officials,
as both revenues and expenses are pro
jected to rise from previous years.
Vice Provost for Budget and Auxil
iaries Management Tim Warner MBA
'77 formally presented the budget plan
at the May 31 meeting of the Faculty
Senate. The budget will be submitted to
the Board of Trustees for approval in
June.

"We're in a strong financial position
not quite where we were prior to the
recession, but gaining back," Warner
wrote in an email to The Daily.
In composing the budget, Warner
emphasized continuity in spending pri
orities from previous years, with sus
tained focuses on strengthening budget
ary support for undergraduate financial
aid and boosting the University's com
petitive faculty salary position.
Warner also acknowledged the im
pact of a struggling economic recovery
and potential government cuts in the
budget plan. Federal direct research
funding of which the University (ex
cluding the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory) currently anticipates $478
million in 2012-13 constitutes over 10
percent of projected University rev
enues.

"These are both issues we are keep

ing a sharp eye on," Warner wrote.
"They are also why we are budgeting a
surplus next year in General Funds so
that we have some cushion in the event
of shortfalls in investment income and
research funding."
The University will also retain many
of the budget cuts made at the height of
the economic recession. While funding
for programs such as Overseas Semi
nars and Sophomore College has been
restored, Warner told the Faculty Senate
on May 31 that the program of cuts is
"really starting to pay off."
Consolidated expenses for the 2012-
13 fiscal year total $4,096.3 million and
are divided among expenses incurred by
the University's academic units in
cluding its seven schools and those
incurred by administrative and auxiliary
units.
Consolidated revenues for the 2012-
13 fiscal year will total $4,443.4 million.
Academic units
The University's academic units will
incur a projected $3,367.8 million in
consolidated expenses next year,
though the amounts disbursed to indi
vidual academic units vary greatly.
The School of Medicine will receive
43 percent of all academic unit expenses
next year, totaling $1,459.6 million. The
school expects an overall surplus of
$21.2 million next year, compared to this
year's $18.9 million surplus.
The school's budget plan notes, how-
ever, the potential revenue short
falls prompted by economic stag
nation and health care reform, em
phasizing the "continuing need to
plan creatively" in order to sustain
a strong fiscal position.

The SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory is projected to ob
tain 11 percent of consolidated ex
penses for 2012-13. SLAC, which
obtains 97 percent of its funding
from the Department of Energy,
anticipates an expansion in ex
penses from $362 million this year
to $384 million next year.

The School of Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) is slated to receive
12 percent of academic unit ex
penditures. H&S, which currently
has the largest faculty in the
school's history and which has
mounted an aggressive faculty re
tention campaign, anticipates an
operating surplus of $16.7 million
next year. After transfers to plant
and endowment payout capitaliza
tion, however, the school will run a
deficit of $7 million.

The School of Engineering will
occupy 10 percent of consolidated
expenditures, with a projected $4.7
million overall surplus next year.
Sponsored research will constitute
41 percent of the School's revenues,
down from 44 percent last year as
federal research funding contracts.

The Dean of Research will re
ceive 6 percent of consolidated ex
penses for 2012-13. The Office of
the Vice Provost and Dean of Re
search anticipates a deficit of $l.l
million, stemming from revenues
of $190.0 million, expenses total
ing $195.9 million and net trans
fers of $4.9 million.

The Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) is projected to pro
duce 6 percent of expenses while
generating an overall surplus of
$3.8 million. The GSB will contin
ue to rely extensively on endow

ment payouts as a revenue source,
with such transfers projected to
constitute 34 percent of the GSB's
total revenue of $190.2 million,
alongside private gifts, which will
provide a further 12 percent.

Stanford Libraries will be allot
ted 3 percent of consolidated aca
demic expenditures. The unit will
run a deficit of $2.6 million in 2012-
13, as the unit hires more specialist
staff and plans and implements
capital projects such as the reloca
tion of collections currently
housed in Meyer Library to the
former GSB South Building.
The Law School, the School of
Earth Sciences and the School of
Education will each receive 2 per
cent of total consolidated expens
es. Remaining expenses, which
total 3 percent, will be divided be
tween the Hoover Institution, the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and the Vice Provost
for Graduate Education.

Administrative and auxiliary units
Consolidated expenses for
University administrative and
auxiliary units will total $1,143.0
million for the 2012-13 fiscal year,
with the largest segment belong
ing to Land, Buildings and Real
Estate (LBRE).
LBRE will constitute 20 per
cent of total administrative and
auxiliary expenses next year.
While expenses for 2012-13 will
rise by 7.5 percent to reach $234.2
million, the unit will generate a
"small surplus" of $2.4 million
next year, according to the budget
plan.

Business Affairs and Informa
tion Technology will consume a
smaller portion of overall expens
es next year relative to this one,
with its share falling from 18 to 16
percent of total expenditures. The
unit, which has projected revenues
of $190.4 million and expenses of
$191.6 million, will run a small
deficit next year.

Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) will make up 15
percent of consolidated expenses

for administrative and auxiliary
units and will generate a small
deficit of $1.7 million for the up
coming fiscal year. Minimal ex
pense growth and a 2.7 percent
growth in revenues largely attrib
utable to planned room and board
increases will result in a smaller
deficit relative to this year.

The Office of Undergraduate
Admission (UGA) and the Finan
cial Aid Office (FAO) will receive
14 percent of total administrative
and auxiliary expenditures, with
almost all of the unit's $160.5 mil
lion in expenses constituted by an
outlay of $153.1 million on under
graduate need-based financial aid.
The Department of Athletics,
PE and Recreation (DAPER) will
receive 9 percent of consolidated
expenses, with a projected budget
balanced by $97.4 million in ex
penses and revenues alike.
Among the remaining units, the
Office of Development and Alum
ni will receive 9 percent of consol
idated expenses; the Office of the
President and Provost will receive
6 percent; the Office of Student
Affairs will receive 5 percent; and
the remaining 6 percent will be di
vided between the Stanford Man
agement Company, the Office of
the General Counsel, the Depart
ment of Public Safety and the Of
fice of Public Affairs.
Capital Budget
In addition to academic and
auxiliary and administrative ex
penses, Stanford will spend a fur
ther $529.5 million in 2012-13
through the University's Capital
Budget. The 2012/13-2014/15 Cap
ital Plan, which totals $2.1 billion
and is 14 percent larger than last
year's plan, will advance major
projects such as the construction
of the Stanford Energy Systems
Innovations (SESI) project and
the repurposing of the vacated, old
Graduate School of Business
Complex.

"small surplus" of $2.4 million
next year, according to the budget
plan.

Business Affairs and Informa

smaller portion of overall expens
es next year relative to this one,
with its share falling from 18 to 16
percent of total expenditures. The
unit, which has projected revenues
of $190.4 million and expenses of
$191.6 million, will run a small
deficit next year.

Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) will make up 15
percent of consolidated expenses

for administrative and auxiliary
units and will generate a small

increases will result in a smaller
deficit relative to this year.

The Office of Undergraduate
Admission (UGA) and the Finan

14 percent of total administrative
and auxiliary expenditures, with
almost all of the unit's $160.5 mil

outlay of $153.1 million on under
graduate need-based financial aid.
The Department of Athletics,
PE and Recreation (DAPER) will
receive 9 percent of consolidated
expenses, with a projected budget
balanced by $97.4 million in ex

Among the remaining units, the
Office of Development and Alum

Capital Budget
In addition to academic and
auxiliary and administrative ex
penses, Stanford will spend a fur
ther $529.5 million in 2012-13
through the University's Capital
Budget. The 2012/13-2014/15 Cap

M.J MJ/The Stanford Daily
The 2012-13 budget will reflect the
University's "very strong financial posi
tion" in the allocation of funds to aca
demic, administrative and auxiliary
units, according to University officials,
as both revenues and expenses are pro
jected to rise from previous years.
Vice Provost for Budget and Auxil
iaries Management Tim Warner MBA
'77 formally presented the budget plan
at the May 31 meeting of the Faculty
Senate. The budget will be submitted to
the Board of Trustees for approval in
June.

"We're in a strong financial position
not quite where we were prior to the
recession, but gaining back," Warner
wrote in an email to The Daily.
In composing the budget, Warner
emphasized continuity in spending pri
orities from previous years, with sus
tained focuses on strengthening budget
ary support for undergraduate financial
aid and boosting the University's com
petitive faculty salary position.
Warner also acknowledged the im
pact of a struggling economic recovery
and potential government cuts in the
budget plan. Federal direct research
funding of which the University (ex
cluding the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory) currently anticipates $478
million in 2012-13 constitutes over 10
percent of projected University rev
enues.

"These are both issues we are keep

ing a sharp eye on," Warner wrote.
"They are also why we are budgeting a
surplus next year in General Funds so
that we have some cushion in the event
of shortfalls in investment income and
research funding."
The University will also retain many
of the budget cuts made at the height of
the economic recession. While funding
for programs such as Overseas Semi
nars and Sophomore College has been
restored, Warner told the Faculty Senate
on May 31 that the program of cuts is
"really starting to pay off."
Consolidated expenses for the 2012-
13 fiscal year total $4,096.3 million and
are divided among expenses incurred by
the University's academic units in
cluding its seven schools and those
incurred by administrative and auxiliary
units.
Consolidated revenues for the 2012-
13 fiscal year will total $4,443.4 million.
Academic units
The University's academic units will
incur a projected $3,367.8 million in
consolidated expenses next year,
though the amounts disbursed to indi
vidual academic units vary greatly.
The School of Medicine will receive
43 percent of all academic unit expenses
next year, totaling $1,459.6 million. The
school expects an overall surplus of
$21.2 million next year, compared to this
year's $18.9 million surplus.
The school's budget plan notes, how-
ever, the potential revenue short
falls prompted by economic stag
nation and health care reform, em
phasizing the "continuing need to
plan creatively" in order to sustain
a strong fiscal position.

The SLAC National Accelera
tor Laboratory is projected to ob
tain 11 percent of consolidated ex
penses for 2012-13. SLAC, which
obtains 97 percent of its funding
from the Department of Energy,
anticipates an expansion in ex
penses from $362 million this year
to $384 million next year.

The School of Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) is slated to receive
12 percent of academic unit ex
penditures. H&S, which currently
has the largest faculty in the
school's history and which has
mounted an aggressive faculty re
tention campaign, anticipates an
operating surplus of $16.7 million
next year. After transfers to plant
and endowment payout capitaliza
tion, however, the school will run a
deficit of $7 million.

The School of Engineering will
occupy 10 percent of consolidated
expenditures, with a projected $4.7
million overall surplus next year.
Sponsored research will constitute
41 percent of the School's revenues,
down from 44 percent last year as
federal research funding contracts.

The Dean of Research will re
ceive 6 percent of consolidated ex
penses for 2012-13. The Office of
the Vice Provost and Dean of Re
search anticipates a deficit of $l.l
million, stemming from revenues
of $190.0 million, expenses total
ing $195.9 million and net trans
fers of $4.9 million.

The Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) is projected to pro
duce 6 percent of expenses while
generating an overall surplus of
$3.8 million. The GSB will contin
ue to rely extensively on endow

ment payouts as a revenue source,
with such transfers projected to
constitute 34 percent of the GSB's
total revenue of $190.2 million,
alongside private gifts, which will
provide a further 12 percent.

Stanford Libraries will be allot
ted 3 percent of consolidated aca
demic expenditures. The unit will
run a deficit of $2.6 million in 2012-
13, as the unit hires more specialist
staff and plans and implements
capital projects such as the reloca
tion of collections currently
housed in Meyer Library to the
former GSB South Building.
The Law School, the School of
Earth Sciences and the School of
Education will each receive 2 per
cent of total consolidated expens
es. Remaining expenses, which
total 3 percent, will be divided be
tween the Hoover Institution, the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and the Vice Provost
for Graduate Education.

Administrative and auxiliary units
Consolidated expenses for
University administrative and
auxiliary units will total $1,143.0
million for the 2012-13 fiscal year,
with the largest segment belong
ing to Land, Buildings and Real
Estate (LBRE).
LBRE will constitute 20 per
cent of total administrative and
auxiliary expenses next year.
While expenses for 2012-13 will
rise by 7.5 percent to reach $234.2

tention campaign, anticipates an
operating surplus of $16.7 million
next year. After transfers to plant
and endowment payout capitaliza
tion, however, the school will run a
deficit of $7 million.

The School of Engineering will
occupy 10 percent of consolidated
expenditures, with a projected $4.7
million overall surplus next year.
Sponsored research will constitute
41 percent of the School's revenues,
down from 44 percent last year as
federal research funding contracts.

The Dean of Research will re
ceive 6 percent of consolidated ex
penses for 2012-13. The Office of
the Vice Provost and Dean of Re
search anticipates a deficit of $l.l
million, stemming from revenues
of $190.0 million, expenses total
ing $195.9 million and net trans
fers of $4.9 million.

The Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) is projected to pro
duce 6 percent of expenses while
generating an overall surplus of
$3.8 million. The GSB will contin
ue to rely extensively on endow

ment payouts as a revenue source,
with such transfers projected to
constitute 34 percent of the GSB's
total revenue of $190.2 million,
alongside private gifts, which will
provide a further 12 percent.

Stanford Libraries will be allot
ted 3 percent of consolidated aca
demic expenditures. The unit will
run a deficit of $2.6 million in 2012-
13, as the unit hires more specialist
staff and plans and implements
capital projects such as the reloca
tion of collections currently
housed in Meyer Library to the
former GSB South Building.
The Law School, the School of
Earth Sciences and the School of
Education will each receive 2 per
cent of total consolidated expens
es. Remaining expenses, which
total 3 percent, will be divided be
tween the Hoover Institution, the
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education and the Vice Provost
for Graduate Education.

Administrative and auxiliary units
Consolidated expenses for
University administrative and
auxiliary units will total $1,143.0
million for the 2012-13 fiscal year,
with the largest segment belong
ing to Land, Buildings and Real
Estate (LBRE).
LBRE will constitute 20 per
cent of total administrative and
auxiliary expenses next year.
While expenses for 2012-13 will
rise by 7.5 percent to reach $234.2
million, the unit will generate a
"small surplus" of $2.4 million
next year, according to the budget
plan.

Business Affairs and Informa
tion Technology will consume a
smaller portion of overall expens
es next year relative to this one,
with its share falling from 18 to 16
percent of total expenditures. The
unit, which has projected revenues
of $190.4 million and expenses of
$191.6 million, will run a small
deficit next year.

Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) will make up 15
percent of consolidated expenses

for administrative and auxiliary
units and will generate a small
deficit of $1.7 million for the up
coming fiscal year. Minimal ex
pense growth and a 2.7 percent
growth in revenues largely attrib
utable to planned room and board
increases will result in a smaller
deficit relative to this year.

The Office of Undergraduate
Admission (UGA) and the Finan
cial Aid Office (FAO) will receive
14 percent of total administrative
and auxiliary expenditures, with
almost all of the unit's $160.5 mil
lion in expenses constituted by an
outlay of $153.1 million on under

and is 14 percent larger than last
year's plan, will advance major
projects such as the construction
of the Stanford Energy Systems
Innovations (SESI) project and
the repurposing of the vacated, old
Graduate School of Business
Complex.
