# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## China censors to prevent collective action, King says 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
The speech of Chinese citizens is
"individually free but collectively in
chains," said Gary King, director of
Harvard's Institute for Quantita
tive Social Science and a professor
in Harvard's Department of Gov
ernment.

King gave a presentation
Wednesday afternoon in Encina
Hall titled, "How Censorship in
China Allows Government Criti
cism but Silences Collective Ex
pression."

"There are many looming chal
lenges facing China ahead," said
Jean Oi, director of the Stanford in
China program and a senior fellow
at the Freeman Spogli Institute,
who introduced King and his proj
ect. "One of them is how China is
going to deal with the Internet and
the flow of information.

"People have a lot of assump
tions and speculations about cen
sorship in China," she added, "The
question is, what do they censor and
what are they trying to do?"
King's lecture centered on dis
proving conventional wisdom that
the goal of Chinese censorship is to
stop government criticism, instead
arguing through his empirical re
search that it is the threat or possi
bility of collective action that the
censors target.

King said that only two topics
pornography and criticism of the
censors themselves are always
blocked.
"We as observers often think
that the Chinese censorship system
is leaky and imperfect, but actually
it is our understanding of it that is
so," he said.

Although he acknowledged that
countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Vietnam also block sensitive
content, King stated, "China is the
largest effort to censor human ex
pression in history."

While exact numbers remain un
clear, King said censorship in China
is a "huge manual effort" involving
hundreds of thousands of people. He
divided the censorship into two
broad categories: search filtering,
which involves blocking certain
terms in search engines, and content
filtering, which involves removing
individual posts by hand.
According to King, websites like
Sina, China's largest infotainment
web portal, hire up to 1,000 people
to censor content.

With the help of Harvard gradu
ate students Jennifer Pan and Molly
Roberts, King undertook a six
month project, spanning from Jan.
2011toJune2011,touse automated

content analysis software he devel
oped and patented to download
over 3 million social media posts
from 1,400 Chinese social media
sites.

King then divided these posts
into 95 topics and, for each post, ex
amined the content, placed it on a
timeline and revisited the site to see
if it was censored.

According to King, 13 percent of
social media posts are censored
overall, even though there are sig
nificant differences across geo
graphic regions and topics.
Drawing from the data collect
ed, King showed that among some
of the most-censored events in the
earlier half of 2011 were protests in
Inner Mongolia, the arrest of dissi
dent Ai Weiwei and the rush to buy
salt following the Japanese earth
quake.

King referred to the last case as
an example of a topic that did not
criticize or threaten the govern
ment, but was characterized by col
lective action and was thus heavily
censored.

To provide more evidence for
this theory, King showed how criti
cism of key government policies, in
cluding the One Child Policy and
education policy, have low censor
ship percentages, arguing that this is
due to their lack of collective action
potential.
King also pointed out that in the
cases of the protests in Inner Mon
golia and Ai Weiwei's arrest, posts
were censored whether they sup
ported or criticized the state.
Citing cases such as the downfall
of politician Bo Xilai and a South
China Sea peace agreement, King
also suggested that his software and
findings can predict certain events
before they occur.
"With the Chinese government
leaving huge footprints and expos
ing themselves, we can tell what
they are going to do before they do
it," King said.

He also noted that Chinese cen
sorship is not ambiguous or hidden,
showing a picture of a blocked Chi
nese site that stated, "The page you
requested is temporarily down.
How about you go look at another
page?"

"I am not favorably impressed,
but nevertheless impressed, by the
Chinese censorship system," he
said. "This may be the optimal way
to have a censorship program, as
the government gets to see what
everyone thinks, eliminate collec
tive action potential and can meas
ure and deal with problems."

The speech of Chinese citizens is
"individually free but collectively in
chains," said Gary King, director of
Harvard's Institute for Quantita
tive Social Science and a professor
in Harvard's Department of Gov
ernment.

King gave a presentation
Wednesday afternoon in Encina
Hall titled, "How Censorship in
China Allows Government Criti
cism but Silences Collective Ex
pression."

"There are many looming chal
lenges facing China ahead," said
Jean Oi, director of the Stanford in
China program and a senior fellow
at the Freeman Spogli Institute,
who introduced King and his proj
ect. "One of them is how China is
going to deal with the Internet and
the flow of information.

"People have a lot of assump
tions and speculations about cen
sorship in China," she added, "The
question is, what do they censor and
what are they trying to do?"
King's lecture centered on dis
proving conventional wisdom that
the goal of Chinese censorship is to
stop government criticism, instead
arguing through his empirical re
search that it is the threat or possi
bility of collective action that the
censors target.

King said that only two topics
pornography and criticism of the
censors themselves are always
blocked.
"We as observers often think
that the Chinese censorship system
is leaky and imperfect, but actually
it is our understanding of it that is
so," he said.

Although he acknowledged that
countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Vietnam also block sensitive
content, King stated, "China is the
largest effort to censor human ex
pression in history."

While exact numbers remain un
clear, King said censorship in China
is a "huge manual effort" involving
hundreds of thousands of people. He
divided the censorship into two
broad categories: search filtering,
which involves blocking certain
terms in search engines, and content
filtering, which involves removing
individual posts by hand.
According to King, websites like
Sina, China's largest infotainment
web portal, hire up to 1,000 people
to censor content.

With the help of Harvard gradu
ate students Jennifer Pan and Molly
Roberts, King undertook a six
month project, spanning from Jan.
2011toJune2011,touse automated

content analysis software he devel
oped and patented to download
over 3 million social media posts
from 1,400 Chinese social media
sites.

King then divided these posts
into 95 topics and, for each post, ex
amined the content, placed it on a
timeline and revisited the site to see
if it was censored.

According to King, 13 percent of
social media posts are censored
overall, even though there are sig
nificant differences across geo
graphic regions and topics.
Drawing from the data collect
ed, King showed that among some
of the most-censored events in the
earlier half of 2011 were protests in
Inner Mongolia, the arrest of dissi
dent Ai Weiwei and the rush to buy
salt following the Japanese earth
quake.

King referred to the last case as
an example of a topic that did not
criticize or threaten the govern
ment, but was characterized by col
lective action and was thus heavily
censored.

To provide more evidence for
this theory, King showed how criti
cism of key government policies, in
cluding the One Child Policy and
education policy, have low censor
ship percentages, arguing that this is
due to their lack of collective action
potential.
King also pointed out that in the
cases of the protests in Inner Mon
golia and Ai Weiwei's arrest, posts
were censored whether they sup
ported or criticized the state.
Citing cases such as the downfall
of politician Bo Xilai and a South
China Sea peace agreement, King
also suggested that his software and
findings can predict certain events
before they occur.
"With the Chinese government
leaving huge footprints and expos
ing themselves, we can tell what
they are going to do before they do
it," King said.

He also noted that Chinese cen
sorship is not ambiguous or hidden,
showing a picture of a blocked Chi
nese site that stated, "The page you
requested is temporarily down.
How about you go look at another
page?"

"I am not favorably impressed,
but nevertheless impressed, by the
Chinese censorship system," he
said. "This may be the optimal way
to have a censorship program, as
the government gets to see what
everyone thinks, eliminate collec
tive action potential and can meas
ure and deal with problems."
