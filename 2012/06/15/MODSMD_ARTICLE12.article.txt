# "Work hard, play hard" not healthy

u "W TOrk hard, play hard" is somewhat of a
\yV / normative ideal at Stanford. When
V V asked to characterize Stanford stu
dents, many of us are proud to proclaim it; it's even
part of the official motto of Stanford's chapter of
Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity. Under this
mentality, all-nighters are viewed with awe and re
spect, as is winning a game of beer pong after pound
ing down ten shots.
One potential reason why the "work hard, play
hard" mindset is so popular is because it connotes
notions of a balanced life. But is it really a balance to
have two long nights of partying after averaging five
hours of sleep per night in the week beforehand?
Simply put, the "work hard, play hard" mentality
leaves little room for personal wellness. If anything,
it suggests that the stresses induced by intense aca
demic and extracurricular schedules can be over
come by partying, drinking and/or doing drugs. In
stead, these behaviors only serve to mask the reality
of the situation.
In 2001, David Brooks labeled Princeton students
as "Future Workaholics of America." Across the
country and eleven years later, this label still seems
appropriate. At Stanford, merely taking classes at

one of the most rigorous universities is not enough;
we pile on various other commitments: athletics,
part-time jobs, public service, performing arts, re
search, start-ups, you name it. Most of the time, we
decide to pursue these activities of our own accord,
out of genuine interest. As Brooks wrote, "promises
of enjoyable work abound." And yet, our myriad
commitments invariably add stress to our lives and,
quite often, a feeling of being overwhelmed.
But whereas it is relatively straightforward to
identify the excesses of playing hard, such as alcohol
induced vomiting and hangovers, it is not always as
easy to recognize the dangers of being overcommit
ted. For instance, studies show that sleep deprivation
and excessive stress are linked to increased rates of
heart disease, obesity and other effects that are only
apparent in the long run. And while the workaholic
lifestyle can be emotionally damaging in the short
term, these effects are subtle and hard to attribute to
any one cause. Even when a student is able to recog
nize that excessive work is having immediate effects
on his well-being, there is not always a simple solu
tion to the problem beyond riding out tough times.
Many common commitments on campus are diffi
cult to drop mid-year.
