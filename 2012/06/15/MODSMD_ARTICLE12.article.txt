# "Work hard, play hard" not healthy

u "W TOrk hard, play hard" is somewhat of a
\yV / normative ideal at Stanford. When
V V asked to characterize Stanford stu
dents, many of us are proud to proclaim it; it's even
part of the official motto of Stanford's chapter of
Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity. Under this
mentality, all-nighters are viewed with awe and re
spect, as is winning a game of beer pong after pound
ing down ten shots.
One potential reason why the "work hard, play
hard" mindset is so popular is because it connotes
notions of a balanced life. But is it really a balance to
have two long nights of partying after averaging five
hours of sleep per night in the week beforehand?
Simply put, the "work hard, play hard" mentality
leaves little room for personal wellness. If anything,
it suggests that the stresses induced by intense aca
demic and extracurricular schedules can be over
come by partying, drinking and/or doing drugs. In
stead, these behaviors only serve to mask the reality
of the situation.
In 2001, David Brooks labeled Princeton students
as "Future Workaholics of America." Across the
country and eleven years later, this label still seems
appropriate. At Stanford, merely taking classes at

one of the most rigorous universities is not enough;
we pile on various other commitments: athletics,
part-time jobs, public service, performing arts, re
search, start-ups, you name it. Most of the time, we
decide to pursue these activities of our own accord,
out of genuine interest. As Brooks wrote, "promises
of enjoyable work abound." And yet, our myriad
commitments invariably add stress to our lives and,
quite often, a feeling of being overwhelmed.
But whereas it is relatively straightforward to
identify the excesses of playing hard, such as alcohol
induced vomiting and hangovers, it is not always as
easy to recognize the dangers of being overcommit
ted. For instance, studies show that sleep deprivation
and excessive stress are linked to increased rates of
heart disease, obesity and other effects that are only
apparent in the long run. And while the workaholic
lifestyle can be emotionally damaging in the short
term, these effects are subtle and hard to attribute to
any one cause. Even when a student is able to recog
nize that excessive work is having immediate effects
on his well-being, there is not always a simple solu
tion to the problem beyond riding out tough times.
Many common commitments on campus are diffi
cult to drop mid-year.
For its part, the administration
has worked hard to address the
excesses of the play hard mental
ity, at least with regard to alcohol
consumption. Alcohol Edu, the
"open door practice," publicizing
the "social zone," and other en
deavors such as the OAPE's Car
dinal Nights program all aim to
ward this end. But while the ad
ministration has been very active
in promoting responsible drink
ing, we feel it has spent relatively
less time on the other side of the
equation: teaching students how
working hard, if done excessively,
can be hazardous to one's health.

Certainly, there are services on
campus, like The Bridge and
CAPS, designed to help students
deal with the effects of excess
stress. But little is done to address
the root of the problem. During

New Student Orientation (NSO),
for instance, we learn about many
of the opportunities available on
campus, but not how to prioritize
or say no to any of them. In fact,
some common orientation tradi
tions only encourage us to feel as
though we should do more. Take,
for instance, the first welcome at
Admit Weekend when we learn
about the amazing accomplish
ments of a select number of our
peers. This is inevitably followed
by some affirmation of how "we
all belong at Stanford." The over
all message, however, is concern
ing: You belong here, but work ex
tremely hard because these are
the kinds of people with which
you'll be taking classes.
We are not advocating for stu
dents to shirk all their commit
ments, or for administrators to en
courage such behavior. Working
hard, from our perspective, is bet
ter than hardly working, and it is
only natural for students to want
to take advantage of the many

opportunities Stanford offers.
\OTiat we view as problematic is
taking on too much, sleeping too
little, being too stressed and not
dialing back because "everyone
else does it too." In short, we hope
that students can start to better
understand the physical and men
tal consequences of their
lifestyles, and we ask that the ad
ministration play a more active
role in this regard.

u "W TOrk hard, play hard" is somewhat of a
\yV / normative ideal at Stanford. When
V V asked to characterize Stanford stu
dents, many of us are proud to proclaim it; it's even
part of the official motto of Stanford's chapter of
Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity. Under this
mentality, all-nighters are viewed with awe and re
spect, as is winning a game of beer pong after pound
ing down ten shots.
One potential reason why the "work hard, play
hard" mindset is so popular is because it connotes
notions of a balanced life. But is it really a balance to
have two long nights of partying after averaging five
hours of sleep per night in the week beforehand?
Simply put, the "work hard, play hard" mentality
leaves little room for personal wellness. If anything,
it suggests that the stresses induced by intense aca
demic and extracurricular schedules can be over
come by partying, drinking and/or doing drugs. In
stead, these behaviors only serve to mask the reality
of the situation.
In 2001, David Brooks labeled Princeton students
as "Future Workaholics of America." Across the
country and eleven years later, this label still seems
appropriate. At Stanford, merely taking classes at

one of the most rigorous universities is not enough;
we pile on various other commitments: athletics,
part-time jobs, public service, performing arts, re
search, start-ups, you name it. Most of the time, we
decide to pursue these activities of our own accord,
out of genuine interest. As Brooks wrote, "promises
of enjoyable work abound." And yet, our myriad
commitments invariably add stress to our lives and,
quite often, a feeling of being overwhelmed.
But whereas it is relatively straightforward to
identify the excesses of playing hard, such as alcohol
induced vomiting and hangovers, it is not always as
easy to recognize the dangers of being overcommit
ted. For instance, studies show that sleep deprivation
and excessive stress are linked to increased rates of
heart disease, obesity and other effects that are only
apparent in the long run. And while the workaholic
lifestyle can be emotionally damaging in the short
term, these effects are subtle and hard to attribute to
any one cause. Even when a student is able to recog
nize that excessive work is having immediate effects
on his well-being, there is not always a simple solu
tion to the problem beyond riding out tough times.
Many common commitments on campus are diffi
cult to drop mid-year.
For its part, the administration
has worked hard to address the
excesses of the play hard mental
ity, at least with regard to alcohol
consumption. Alcohol Edu, the
"open door practice," publicizing
the "social zone," and other en
deavors such as the OAPE's Car
dinal Nights program all aim to
ward this end. But while the ad
ministration has been very active
in promoting responsible drink
ing, we feel it has spent relatively
less time on the other side of the
equation: teaching students how
working hard, if done excessively,
can be hazardous to one's health.

Certainly, there are services on
campus, like The Bridge and
CAPS, designed to help students
deal with the effects of excess
stress. But little is done to address
the root of the problem. During

New Student Orientation (NSO),
for instance, we learn about many
of the opportunities available on
campus, but not how to prioritize
or say no to any of them. In fact,
some common orientation tradi
tions only encourage us to feel as
though we should do more. Take,
for instance, the first welcome at
Admit Weekend when we learn
about the amazing accomplish
ments of a select number of our
peers. This is inevitably followed
by some affirmation of how "we
all belong at Stanford." The over
all message, however, is concern
ing: You belong here, but work ex
tremely hard because these are
the kinds of people with which
you'll be taking classes.
We are not advocating for stu
dents to shirk all their commit
ments, or for administrators to en
courage such behavior. Working
hard, from our perspective, is bet
ter than hardly working, and it is
only natural for students to want
to take advantage of the many

opportunities Stanford offers.
\OTiat we view as problematic is
taking on too much, sleeping too
little, being too stressed and not
dialing back because "everyone
else does it too." In short, we hope
that students can start to better
understand the physical and men
tal consequences of their
lifestyles, and we ask that the ad
ministration play a more active
role in this regard.
