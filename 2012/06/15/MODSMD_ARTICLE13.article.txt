Originally published January 27,2012.

The Faculty Senate heard the culmination
of two years of work by the Study on Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES)
Thursday, a report of more than 100 pages
that examines the methods and goals of a
Stanford education. The study concluded
with 55 recommendations to improve under
graduate education, such as the replacement
of the Introduction to Humanities (IHUM)
program and a new, non-disciplinary system
of breadth requirements.
Co-chairs James Campbell, the Edgar E.
Robinson Professor in U.S. history, and Susan
McConnell, the Susan B. Ford Professor in bi
ology, led the 17-member committee and
presented the study's findings to the Senate.
Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing
SUES undertook an examination of the
breadth requirements of a current under
graduate education. The report recommends
a new system based primarily on seven skills
deemed essential for students: esthetic and
interpretive inquiry; social inquiry; scientific
analysis; formal and quantitative reasoning;
engaging difference; moral and ethical rea
soning; and creative expression. Under the
recommended plan, titled, "Ways of Think
ing, Ways of Doing," either one or two cours
es will be required for each skill.
"In conceiving breadth in a non-discipli
nary way, we are not suggesting that discipli
nary knowledge is unimportant," the report
reads. "We see knowledge and capacities as
inextricable and reciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both inte
grative and adaptive learning, with the for
mer exemplified by the fact that general edu
cation requirements, freshman-year Think
ing Matters courses and major requirements
will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current
system, students seem to view general educa
tion requirements as "tick boxes" and do not
consider the meaning behind the selected re
quirements.

"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing
all this, to condemn students for their cyni
cism, but the fault is more ours than theirs,"
the report reads. "If they choose general edu
cation courses with little thoughtfulness of
purpose, it is because we have failed to com
municate to them why we believe these
courses are important, what we hope they
will gain from them and how they relate to
the broader aims of a Stanford education."

Included in the report appendix is a com
parison of Stanford's breadth requirements
with those of Yale, Princeton and Harvard.

IHUM: Replaced, or rebranded?
The report recommends replacing the In
troduction to Humanities program, a year
long requirement for freshmen since 1996,
with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course.
"Few topics elicited as much discussion
with the SUES committee, and fewer still
provoked such ambivalent feelings," the
study said of its examination of the contro
versial IHUM series, which is currently
mandatory for all freshmen not enrolled in
the alternative program, Structured Liberal
Education (SEE).
The report initially compliments the
IHUM program and notes the resources that
have gone into its development, but quickly
changes tune due to student dissatisfaction.
"IHUM's sustained attention to student
learning and effective pedagogy makes it a
model not only for future freshman pro
grams, but also for other units in the Univer
sity," the report reads. "All these distinctions
only make the response of students more dis
appointing."
"We found a troubling pattern of student
alienation from IHUM, manifested in (rela
tively) low course evaluations, poor atten
dance at lectures and a widespread failure to
engage deeply with course materials."
The report comments on low student ap
proval of IHUM and described a phenome
non known as "IHUM kid" students
mocked by others for deep interest in the
course material.
"Paradoxically, the very program we in
tend to fire students' imaginations and awak
en them to the possibilities of university-level
learning has become the paradigmatic 'tick
box' requirement," the report reads.
As a result, the committee recommends
replacing IHUM with a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course, which would be devel
oped and overseen by a governance board
made up of faculty across the University. A
pilot program of these courses would begin
during the upcoming 2012 to 2013 academic
year.
"Our idea is that by taking a Thinking
Matters course, students can have some of
the experiences that are exemplified by fall
quarter IHUM," McConnell said. "But that
you can choose whether to do that in the hu
manities, the sciences, the social sciences. You
can choose the idea that you want to ex
plore."
The report lists possible Thinking Matters
courses such as "Evil" taught by philosophy
professor Chris Bobonich; "The Nature of
Law" with Dean of Stanford Law School
Larry Kramer; and a course entitled "Social
Animals, Social Revolutions, Social Revolu
tions," which would be co-taught by French
professor Dan Edelstein, biology professor
Deborah Gordon and professor of computer

science Eric Roberts. Faculty members have
not yet committed to these courses, accord
ing to the report.

The new courses would be smaller in size
than most IHUM classes and would not be
restricted to humanities-related topics. While
mandatory for freshman, Thinking Matters
would be open to all four classes.
"All students are required to take one, but
they have the incentive to take more if they
want because it will count towards breadth
requirements," said Aysha Bagchi 'll, one of
the two student members of the committee,
Bagchi, a recent recipient of the Rhodes
scholarship and a former Daily columnist,
said her own IHUM experience was mostly
positive, but could understand some of the
resentment directed at the program by stu
dents.
"It does take up a big part of your fresh
man year, and it does make it hard to ex
plore," she said.
Bagchi said that a minor recommenda
tion of the committee is to alter the grading
system that was previously used IHUM. The
report referenced, "the severity and seeming
arbitrariness of the grading system," and the
fact that "many students referred to the pro
gram as 'B-HUM.'"
Some have questioned whether the new
program will differ substantially from
IHUM. Many of the proposed courses are
current fall-quarter IHUM classes, such as
"The Poet Remaking the World," "Can the
People Rule?" and "Epic Journeys." Accord
ing to ASSU Senator Dan DeLong 'l3, some
students that he has talked to are worried
that the new program is simply an "IHUM
name-change."
English professor and SUES committee
member Jennifer Summit, who has previous
ly taught in the IHUM program, said that
Thinking Matters will focus less on specific
content and more on the learning process.
She added that instead of simply being an in
troduction to humanities, the curriculum
would be "an introduction to college-level
analysis."
Introductory Seminars
One of the most contentious recommen
dations of the report is to require each fresh
man to take at least one introductory semi
nar, to provide a variety of learning environ
ments to students in the first year of study.
"On one hand, we want every freshman to
get to know a faculty member, in all of our
quirkiness and our passion for what we do,"
McConnell said. "We think the advantages of
being in a seminar are really worth the re
quirement. That's a subset of the committee,
and a small majority. There is another set of
people both in the committee and in the Uni
versity who worry. They agree with the goals,
but they worry that by requiring the seminar

that the seminars will lose some of their at
tractiveness to students. And the last thing we
want to do is to damage a great program."
McConnell compared the proposed re
quirement to the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) which, while a requirement,
receives mostly positive feedback from stu
dents, McConnell said, due to a wide variety
of course options.
"We had a huge debate in the committee
about this issue," Bagchi said. "I think most
people were initially divided, so we had a re
ally open debate."
Bagchi noted that most committee mem
bers are very positive about IntroSems but
fear the effect of making them a require
ment.

A student representative of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Poli
cies (C-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3, voiced
his concerns on Thursday in an email sent to
the undergraduate ASSU Senate list.
"I worry that, no matter what, a require
ment will lead to people getting stuck in class
es that they don't want to take, which will ruin
the class for everyone else," Trusheim wrote,
arguing that the best aspect of IntroSems is
found in the enthusiasm of students to be
present and learn about a topic of interest in
a close setting.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam addressed an issue of supply
and demand concerning Introductory Semi
nars but said that he believes that shifting to
a requirement would be possible, both be
cause faculty members enjoy teaching the
seminars and being able to choose their stu
dents through applications. Elam said there
are currently 120 IntroSems offered per year.

Residential learning
McConnell noted in the Faculty Senate
meeting that there is a perceived "disconnect
between the academic and residential lives"
of Stanford students. The report heralded
SLE as "a model of integrated residential
learning," a program through which fresh
men students attend classes and discussions
in their East Florence Moore dormitory.
"The kind of moniker of 'IHUM kid' for
somebody that tries to bring up something
that he's learned in IHUM when we went
to SEE, we didn't find that," Campbell said.
"We found that students are living together.
They're learning together. They're arguing
about stuff over dinner."
While the report does not recommend
mandating SLE stating that the program
"flourishes precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students choose to
join" it does call for the creation of similar
programs where students can choose to learn
in their residential environments. The report
advises organizing these new resi
dential programs around a variety
of themes, so they would attract a
diverse body of students.
According to the report, one
possibility is to organize these
programs around the five themes
of the Stanford Challenge Initia
tive: human health, the environ
ment, international studies, edu
cation and the arts. The report
adds, however, that it is important
that these themes grow "organi
cally" out of student and faculty
interest.
The report also notes the diffi
culty of recruiting faculty mem
bers to serve as Residential Fel
lows (RFs), tasked with living in
undergraduate dormitories and
engaging with student residents.
According to the report, only 14
of the 62 RFs on campus are mem
bers of the Academic Council.
While the report did not conclude
that this was significant problem,
it did recommend finding new
ways to encourage faculty mem
bers to take on the post.
The committee recommended
that the University also explore
how faculty members could en
gage in residential life in other,
less time-intensive ways. One sug
gestion was for professors to give
talks, participate in discussions
and teach seminars in undergrad
uate residences.
Focusing on residential living
after freshman year, the report ex
pressed some concerns about the
trend of seniors choosing to live in
Row houses, a collection of stu
dent-run houses, noting that these
students "largely pass out of the
orbit of the Office of Residential
Education."
In his email to the public
ASSU Senate list-serve, Trusheim
took offense to the report's con
clusion that "for many seniors, the
appeal of the Row clearly has less
to do with self-government than

with the opportunity to host par
ties with less stringent supervision
than in non-Row houses."
"This is particularly insulting
because I think it expresses a de
sire to do away with self-ops/co
ops in favor of a much more cen
tralized program under tight con
trol of ResEd," Trusheim wrote.
Bagchi, who lived in the self-op
Xanadu last year, said the report
was not recommending any signif
icant changes to the Row pro
gram, but recognizing a possible
cultural issue to address.
"The recommendations don't
involve suddenly inserting faculty
members in Row houses that's
not going to happen," she said.
Instead, one solution that the
committee proposed was giving
seniors more housing options such
as a "residential research college,"
which would provide mentoring
for students completing a honors
theses or capstone project. Sum
mit said this idea was inspired by
the September Honors College.
What's next?
"The SUES report is a radical
document, less because it proposes
to redesign undergraduate educa
tion than because it tries to get at
the root of teaching and learning,"
wrote James J. Sheehan, chair of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) from 1993 to
1994, in the document's preface,
"The report is also a conservative
document because it is tightly con
nected to Stanford's distinctive
character and traditions."
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policies (C
-USP) will make recommendations
in response to the report at a Feb.
23 Faculty Senate meeting. The
Senate will then vote on the final
recommendations at its next meet
ing on March 8.

professor Dan Edelstein, biology professor
Deborah Gordon and professor of computer

science Eric Roberts. Faculty members have
not yet committed to these courses, accord
ing to the report.

The new courses would be smaller in size
than most IHUM classes and would not be
restricted to humanities-related topics. While
mandatory for freshman, Thinking Matters
would be open to all four classes.
"All students are required to take one, but
they have the incentive to take more if they
want because it will count towards breadth
requirements," said Aysha Bagchi 'll, one of
the two student members of the committee,
Bagchi, a recent recipient of the Rhodes
scholarship and a former Daily columnist,
said her own IHUM experience was mostly
positive, but could understand some of the
resentment directed at the program by stu
dents.
"It does take up a big part of your fresh
man year, and it does make it hard to ex
plore," she said.
Bagchi said that a minor recommenda
tion of the committee is to alter the grading
system that was previously used IHUM. The
report referenced, "the severity and seeming
arbitrariness of the grading system," and the
fact that "many students referred to the pro
gram as 'B-HUM.'"
Some have questioned whether the new
program will differ substantially from
IHUM. Many of the proposed courses are
current fall-quarter IHUM classes, such as
"The Poet Remaking the World," "Can the
People Rule?" and "Epic Journeys." Accord
ing to ASSU Senator Dan DeLong 'l3, some
students that he has talked to are worried
that the new program is simply an "IHUM
name-change."
English professor and SUES committee
member Jennifer Summit, who has previous
ly taught in the IHUM program, said that
Thinking Matters will focus less on specific
content and more on the learning process.
She added that instead of simply being an in
troduction to humanities, the curriculum
would be "an introduction to college-level
analysis."
Introductory Seminars
One of the most contentious recommen
dations of the report is to require each fresh
man to take at least one introductory semi
nar, to provide a variety of learning environ
ments to students in the first year of study.
"On one hand, we want every freshman to
get to know a faculty member, in all of our
quirkiness and our passion for what we do,"
McConnell said. "We think the advantages of
being in a seminar are really worth the re
quirement. That's a subset of the committee,
and a small majority. There is another set of
people both in the committee and in the Uni
versity who worry. They agree with the goals,
but they worry that by requiring the seminar

that the seminars will lose some of their at
tractiveness to students. And the last thing we
want to do is to damage a great program."
McConnell compared the proposed re
quirement to the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) which, while a requirement,
receives mostly positive feedback from stu
dents, McConnell said, due to a wide variety
of course options.
"We had a huge debate in the committee
about this issue," Bagchi said. "I think most
people were initially divided, so we had a re
ally open debate."
Bagchi noted that most committee mem
bers are very positive about IntroSems but
fear the effect of making them a require
ment.

A student representative of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Poli
cies (C-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3, voiced
his concerns on Thursday in an email sent to
the undergraduate ASSU Senate list.
"I worry that, no matter what, a require
ment will lead to people getting stuck in class
es that they don't want to take, which will ruin
the class for everyone else," Trusheim wrote,
arguing that the best aspect of IntroSems is
found in the enthusiasm of students to be
present and learn about a topic of interest in
a close setting.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam addressed an issue of supply
and demand concerning Introductory Semi
nars but said that he believes that shifting to
a requirement would be possible, both be
cause faculty members enjoy teaching the
seminars and being able to choose their stu
dents through applications. Elam said there
are currently 120 IntroSems offered per year.

Residential learning
McConnell noted in the Faculty Senate
meeting that there is a perceived "disconnect
between the academic and residential lives"
of Stanford students. The report heralded
SLE as "a model of integrated residential
learning," a program through which fresh
men students attend classes and discussions
in their East Florence Moore dormitory.
"The kind of moniker of 'IHUM kid' for
somebody that tries to bring up something
that he's learned in IHUM when we went
to SEE, we didn't find that," Campbell said.
"We found that students are living together.
They're learning together. They're arguing
about stuff over dinner."
While the report does not recommend
mandating SLE stating that the program
"flourishes precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students choose to
join" it does call for the creation of similar
programs where students can choose to learn
in their residential environments. The report
advises organizing these new resi
dential programs around a variety
of themes, so they would attract a
diverse body of students.
According to the report, one
possibility is to organize these
programs around the five themes
of the Stanford Challenge Initia
tive: human health, the environ
ment, international studies, edu
cation and the arts. The report
adds, however, that it is important
that these themes grow "organi
cally" out of student and faculty
interest.
The report also notes the diffi
culty of recruiting faculty mem
bers to serve as Residential Fel
lows (RFs), tasked with living in
undergraduate dormitories and
engaging with student residents.
According to the report, only 14
of the 62 RFs on campus are mem
bers of the Academic Council.
While the report did not conclude
that this was significant problem,
it did recommend finding new
ways to encourage faculty mem
bers to take on the post.
The committee recommended
that the University also explore
how faculty members could en
gage in residential life in other,
less time-intensive ways. One sug
gestion was for professors to give
talks, participate in discussions
and teach seminars in undergrad
uate residences.
Focusing on residential living
after freshman year, the report ex
pressed some concerns about the
trend of seniors choosing to live in
Row houses, a collection of stu
dent-run houses, noting that these
students "largely pass out of the
orbit of the Office of Residential
Education."
In his email to the public
ASSU Senate list-serve, Trusheim
took offense to the report's con
clusion that "for many seniors, the
appeal of the Row clearly has less
to do with self-government than

with the opportunity to host par
ties with less stringent supervision
than in non-Row houses."
"This is particularly insulting
because I think it expresses a de
sire to do away with self-ops/co
ops in favor of a much more cen
tralized program under tight con
trol of ResEd," Trusheim wrote.
Bagchi, who lived in the self-op
Xanadu last year, said the report
was not recommending any signif
icant changes to the Row pro
gram, but recognizing a possible
cultural issue to address.
"The recommendations don't
involve suddenly inserting faculty
members in Row houses that's
not going to happen," she said.
Instead, one solution that the
committee proposed was giving
seniors more housing options such
as a "residential research college,"
which would provide mentoring
for students completing a honors
theses or capstone project. Sum
mit said this idea was inspired by
the September Honors College.
What's next?
"The SUES report is a radical
document, less because it proposes
to redesign undergraduate educa
tion than because it tries to get at
the root of teaching and learning,"
wrote James J. Sheehan, chair of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) from 1993 to
1994, in the document's preface,
"The report is also a conservative
document because it is tightly con
nected to Stanford's distinctive
character and traditions."
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policies (C
-USP) will make recommendations
in response to the report at a Feb.
23 Faculty Senate meeting. The
Senate will then vote on the final
recommendations at its next meet
ing on March 8.

The Faculty Senate heard the culmination
of two years of work by the Study on Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES)
Thursday, a report of more than 100 pages
that examines the methods and goals of a
Stanford education. The study concluded
with 55 recommendations to improve under
graduate education, such as the replacement
of the Introduction to Humanities (IHUM)
program and a new, non-disciplinary system
of breadth requirements.
Co-chairs James Campbell, the Edgar E.
Robinson Professor in U.S. history, and Susan
McConnell, the Susan B. Ford Professor in bi
ology, led the 17-member committee and
presented the study's findings to the Senate.
Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing
SUES undertook an examination of the
breadth requirements of a current under
graduate education. The report recommends
a new system based primarily on seven skills
deemed essential for students: esthetic and
interpretive inquiry; social inquiry; scientific
analysis; formal and quantitative reasoning;
engaging difference; moral and ethical rea
soning; and creative expression. Under the
recommended plan, titled, "Ways of Think
ing, Ways of Doing," either one or two cours
es will be required for each skill.
"In conceiving breadth in a non-discipli
nary way, we are not suggesting that discipli
nary knowledge is unimportant," the report
reads. "We see knowledge and capacities as
inextricable and reciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both inte
grative and adaptive learning, with the for
mer exemplified by the fact that general edu
cation requirements, freshman-year Think
ing Matters courses and major requirements
will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current
system, students seem to view general educa
tion requirements as "tick boxes" and do not
consider the meaning behind the selected re
quirements.

"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing
all this, to condemn students for their cyni
cism, but the fault is more ours than theirs,"
the report reads. "If they choose general edu
cation courses with little thoughtfulness of
purpose, it is because we have failed to com
municate to them why we believe these
courses are important, what we hope they
will gain from them and how they relate to
the broader aims of a Stanford education."

Included in the report appendix is a com
parison of Stanford's breadth requirements
with those of Yale, Princeton and Harvard.

IHUM: Replaced, or rebranded?
The report recommends replacing the In
troduction to Humanities program, a year
long requirement for freshmen since 1996,
with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course.
"Few topics elicited as much discussion
with the SUES committee, and fewer still
provoked such ambivalent feelings," the
study said of its examination of the contro
versial IHUM series, which is currently
mandatory for all freshmen not enrolled in
the alternative program, Structured Liberal
Education (SEE).
The report initially compliments the
IHUM program and notes the resources that
have gone into its development, but quickly
changes tune due to student dissatisfaction.
"IHUM's sustained attention to student
learning and effective pedagogy makes it a
model not only for future freshman pro
grams, but also for other units in the Univer
sity," the report reads. "All these distinctions
only make the response of students more dis
appointing."
"We found a troubling pattern of student
alienation from IHUM, manifested in (rela
tively) low course evaluations, poor atten
dance at lectures and a widespread failure to
engage deeply with course materials."
The report comments on low student ap
proval of IHUM and described a phenome
non known as "IHUM kid" students
mocked by others for deep interest in the
course material.
"Paradoxically, the very program we in
tend to fire students' imaginations and awak
en them to the possibilities of university-level
learning has become the paradigmatic 'tick
box' requirement," the report reads.
As a result, the committee recommends
replacing IHUM with a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course, which would be devel
oped and overseen by a governance board
made up of faculty across the University. A
pilot program of these courses would begin
during the upcoming 2012 to 2013 academic
year.
"Our idea is that by taking a Thinking
Matters course, students can have some of
the experiences that are exemplified by fall
quarter IHUM," McConnell said. "But that
you can choose whether to do that in the hu
manities, the sciences, the social sciences. You
can choose the idea that you want to ex
plore."
The report lists possible Thinking Matters
courses such as "Evil" taught by philosophy
professor Chris Bobonich; "The Nature of
Law" with Dean of Stanford Law School
Larry Kramer; and a course entitled "Social
Animals, Social Revolutions, Social Revolu
tions," which would be co-taught by French
professor Dan Edelstein, biology professor
Deborah Gordon and professor of computer

science Eric Roberts. Faculty members have
not yet committed to these courses, accord
ing to the report.

than most IHUM classes and would not be
restricted to humanities-related topics. While

mandating SLE stating that the program
"flourishes precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students choose to
join" it does call for the creation of similar
programs where students can choose to learn
in their residential environments. The report
advises organizing these new resi
dential programs around a variety
of themes, so they would attract a
diverse body of students.
According to the report, one
possibility is to organize these
programs around the five themes
of the Stanford Challenge Initia
tive: human health, the environ
ment, international studies, edu
cation and the arts. The report
adds, however, that it is important
that these themes grow "organi
cally" out of student and faculty
interest.
The report also notes the diffi
culty of recruiting faculty mem
bers to serve as Residential Fel
lows (RFs), tasked with living in
undergraduate dormitories and
engaging with student residents.
According to the report, only 14
of the 62 RFs on campus are mem
bers of the Academic Council.
While the report did not conclude
that this was significant problem,
it did recommend finding new
ways to encourage faculty mem
bers to take on the post.
The committee recommended
that the University also explore
how faculty members could en
gage in residential life in other,
less time-intensive ways. One sug
gestion was for professors to give
talks, participate in discussions
and teach seminars in undergrad
uate residences.
Focusing on residential living
after freshman year, the report ex
pressed some concerns about the
trend of seniors choosing to live in
Row houses, a collection of stu
dent-run houses, noting that these
students "largely pass out of the
orbit of the Office of Residential
Education."
In his email to the public
ASSU Senate list-serve, Trusheim
took offense to the report's con
clusion that "for many seniors, the
appeal of the Row clearly has less
to do with self-government than

with the opportunity to host par
ties with less stringent supervision
than in non-Row houses."
"This is particularly insulting
because I think it expresses a de
sire to do away with self-ops/co
ops in favor of a much more cen
tralized program under tight con
trol of ResEd," Trusheim wrote.
Bagchi, who lived in the self-op
Xanadu last year, said the report
was not recommending any signif
icant changes to the Row pro
gram, but recognizing a possible
cultural issue to address.
"The recommendations don't
involve suddenly inserting faculty
members in Row houses that's
not going to happen," she said.
Instead, one solution that the
committee proposed was giving
seniors more housing options such
as a "residential research college,"
which would provide mentoring
for students completing a honors
theses or capstone project. Sum
mit said this idea was inspired by
the September Honors College.
What's next?
"The SUES report is a radical
document, less because it proposes
to redesign undergraduate educa
tion than because it tries to get at
the root of teaching and learning,"
wrote James J. Sheehan, chair of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) from 1993 to
1994, in the document's preface,
"The report is also a conservative
document because it is tightly con
nected to Stanford's distinctive
character and traditions."
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policies (C
-USP) will make recommendations
in response to the report at a Feb.
23 Faculty Senate meeting. The
Senate will then vote on the final
recommendations at its next meet
ing on March 8.

The Faculty Senate heard the culmination
of two years of work by the Study on Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES)
Thursday, a report of more than 100 pages
that examines the methods and goals of a
Stanford education. The study concluded
with 55 recommendations to improve under
graduate education, such as the replacement
of the Introduction to Humanities (IHUM)
program and a new, non-disciplinary system
of breadth requirements.
Co-chairs James Campbell, the Edgar E.
Robinson Professor in U.S. history, and Susan
McConnell, the Susan B. Ford Professor in bi
ology, led the 17-member committee and
presented the study's findings to the Senate.
Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing
SUES undertook an examination of the
breadth requirements of a current under
graduate education. The report recommends
a new system based primarily on seven skills
deemed essential for students: esthetic and
interpretive inquiry; social inquiry; scientific
analysis; formal and quantitative reasoning;
engaging difference; moral and ethical rea
soning; and creative expression. Under the
recommended plan, titled, "Ways of Think
ing, Ways of Doing," either one or two cours
es will be required for each skill.
"In conceiving breadth in a non-discipli
nary way, we are not suggesting that discipli
nary knowledge is unimportant," the report
reads. "We see knowledge and capacities as
inextricable and reciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both inte
grative and adaptive learning, with the for
mer exemplified by the fact that general edu
cation requirements, freshman-year Think
ing Matters courses and major requirements
will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current
system, students seem to view general educa
tion requirements as "tick boxes" and do not
consider the meaning behind the selected re
quirements.

"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing
all this, to condemn students for their cyni
cism, but the fault is more ours than theirs,"
the report reads. "If they choose general edu
cation courses with little thoughtfulness of
purpose, it is because we have failed to com
municate to them why we believe these
courses are important, what we hope they
will gain from them and how they relate to
the broader aims of a Stanford education."

Included in the report appendix is a com
parison of Stanford's breadth requirements
with those of Yale, Princeton and Harvard.

IHUM: Replaced, or rebranded?
The report recommends replacing the In
troduction to Humanities program, a year
long requirement for freshmen since 1996,
with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course.
"Few topics elicited as much discussion
with the SUES committee, and fewer still
provoked such ambivalent feelings," the
study said of its examination of the contro
versial IHUM series, which is currently
mandatory for all freshmen not enrolled in
the alternative program, Structured Liberal
Education (SEE).
The report initially compliments the
IHUM program and notes the resources that
have gone into its development, but quickly
changes tune due to student dissatisfaction.
"IHUM's sustained attention to student
learning and effective pedagogy makes it a
model not only for future freshman pro
grams, but also for other units in the Univer
sity," the report reads. "All these distinctions
only make the response of students more dis
appointing."
"We found a troubling pattern of student
alienation from IHUM, manifested in (rela
tively) low course evaluations, poor atten
dance at lectures and a widespread failure to
engage deeply with course materials."
The report comments on low student ap
proval of IHUM and described a phenome
non known as "IHUM kid" students
mocked by others for deep interest in the
course material.
"Paradoxically, the very program we in
tend to fire students' imaginations and awak
en them to the possibilities of university-level
learning has become the paradigmatic 'tick
box' requirement," the report reads.
As a result, the committee recommends
replacing IHUM with a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course, which would be devel
oped and overseen by a governance board
made up of faculty across the University. A
pilot program of these courses would begin
during the upcoming 2012 to 2013 academic
year.
"Our idea is that by taking a Thinking
Matters course, students can have some of
the experiences that are exemplified by fall
quarter IHUM," McConnell said. "But that
you can choose whether to do that in the hu
manities, the sciences, the social sciences. You
can choose the idea that you want to ex
plore."
The report lists possible Thinking Matters
courses such as "Evil" taught by philosophy
professor Chris Bobonich; "The Nature of
Law" with Dean of Stanford Law School
Larry Kramer; and a course entitled "Social
Animals, Social Revolutions, Social Revolu
tions," which would be co-taught by French
professor Dan Edelstein, biology professor
Deborah Gordon and professor of computer

science Eric Roberts. Faculty members have
not yet committed to these courses, accord
ing to the report.

The new courses would be smaller in size
than most IHUM classes and would not be
restricted to humanities-related topics. While
mandatory for freshman, Thinking Matters
would be open to all four classes.
"All students are required to take one, but
they have the incentive to take more if they
want because it will count towards breadth
requirements," said Aysha Bagchi 'll, one of
the two student members of the committee,
Bagchi, a recent recipient of the Rhodes
scholarship and a former Daily columnist,
said her own IHUM experience was mostly
positive, but could understand some of the
resentment directed at the program by stu
dents.
"It does take up a big part of your fresh
man year, and it does make it hard to ex
plore," she said.
Bagchi said that a minor recommenda
tion of the committee is to alter the grading
system that was previously used IHUM. The
report referenced, "the severity and seeming
arbitrariness of the grading system," and the
fact that "many students referred to the pro
gram as 'B-HUM.'"
Some have questioned whether the new
program will differ substantially from
IHUM. Many of the proposed courses are
current fall-quarter IHUM classes, such as
"The Poet Remaking the World," "Can the
People Rule?" and "Epic Journeys." Accord
ing to ASSU Senator Dan DeLong 'l3, some
students that he has talked to are worried
that the new program is simply an "IHUM
name-change."
English professor and SUES committee
member Jennifer Summit, who has previous
ly taught in the IHUM program, said that
Thinking Matters will focus less on specific
content and more on the learning process.
She added that instead of simply being an in
troduction to humanities, the curriculum
would be "an introduction to college-level
analysis."
Introductory Seminars
One of the most contentious recommen
dations of the report is to require each fresh
man to take at least one introductory semi
nar, to provide a variety of learning environ
ments to students in the first year of study.
"On one hand, we want every freshman to
get to know a faculty member, in all of our
quirkiness and our passion for what we do,"
McConnell said. "We think the advantages of
being in a seminar are really worth the re
quirement. That's a subset of the committee,
and a small majority. There is another set of
people both in the committee and in the Uni
versity who worry. They agree with the goals,
but they worry that by requiring the seminar

that the seminars will lose some of their at
tractiveness to students. And the last thing we
want to do is to damage a great program."
McConnell compared the proposed re
quirement to the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) which, while a requirement,
receives mostly positive feedback from stu
dents, McConnell said, due to a wide variety
of course options.
"We had a huge debate in the committee
about this issue," Bagchi said. "I think most
people were initially divided, so we had a re
ally open debate."
Bagchi noted that most committee mem
bers are very positive about IntroSems but
fear the effect of making them a require
ment.

A student representative of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Poli
cies (C-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3, voiced
his concerns on Thursday in an email sent to
the undergraduate ASSU Senate list.
"I worry that, no matter what, a require
ment will lead to people getting stuck in class
es that they don't want to take, which will ruin
the class for everyone else," Trusheim wrote,
arguing that the best aspect of IntroSems is
found in the enthusiasm of students to be
present and learn about a topic of interest in
a close setting.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam addressed an issue of supply
and demand concerning Introductory Semi
nars but said that he believes that shifting to
a requirement would be possible, both be
cause faculty members enjoy teaching the
seminars and being able to choose their stu
dents through applications. Elam said there
are currently 120 IntroSems offered per year.

Residential learning
McConnell noted in the Faculty Senate
meeting that there is a perceived "disconnect
between the academic and residential lives"
of Stanford students. The report heralded
SLE as "a model of integrated residential
learning," a program through which fresh
men students attend classes and discussions
in their East Florence Moore dormitory.
"The kind of moniker of 'IHUM kid' for
somebody that tries to bring up something
that he's learned in IHUM when we went
to SEE, we didn't find that," Campbell said.
"We found that students are living together.
They're learning together. They're arguing
about stuff over dinner."
While the report does not recommend
mandating SLE stating that the program
"flourishes precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students choose to
join" it does call for the creation of similar
programs where students can choose to learn
in their residential environments. The report
advises organizing these new resi
dential programs around a variety
of themes, so they would attract a
diverse body of students.

engaging difference; moral and ethical rea
soning; and creative expression. Under the
recommended plan, titled, "Ways of Think
ing, Ways of Doing," either one or two cours
es will be required for each skill.
"In conceiving breadth in a non-discipli
nary way, we are not suggesting that discipli
nary knowledge is unimportant," the report
reads. "We see knowledge and capacities as
inextricable and reciprocal."
The report discusses a need for both inte
grative and adaptive learning, with the for
mer exemplified by the fact that general edu
cation requirements, freshman-year Think
ing Matters courses and major requirements
will be permitted to overlap.
The report noted that under the current
system, students seem to view general educa
tion requirements as "tick boxes" and do not
consider the meaning behind the selected re
quirements.

"It is characteristic of faculty, on hearing
all this, to condemn students for their cyni
cism, but the fault is more ours than theirs,"
the report reads. "If they choose general edu
cation courses with little thoughtfulness of
purpose, it is because we have failed to com
municate to them why we believe these
courses are important, what we hope they
will gain from them and how they relate to
the broader aims of a Stanford education."

Included in the report appendix is a com
parison of Stanford's breadth requirements
with those of Yale, Princeton and Harvard.

IHUM: Replaced, or rebranded?
The report recommends replacing the In
troduction to Humanities program, a year
long requirement for freshmen since 1996,
with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course.
"Few topics elicited as much discussion
with the SUES committee, and fewer still
provoked such ambivalent feelings," the
study said of its examination of the contro
versial IHUM series, which is currently
mandatory for all freshmen not enrolled in
the alternative program, Structured Liberal
Education (SEE).
The report initially compliments the
IHUM program and notes the resources that
have gone into its development, but quickly
changes tune due to student dissatisfaction.
"IHUM's sustained attention to student
learning and effective pedagogy makes it a
model not only for future freshman pro
grams, but also for other units in the Univer
sity," the report reads. "All these distinctions
only make the response of students more dis
appointing."
"We found a troubling pattern of student
alienation from IHUM, manifested in (rela
tively) low course evaluations, poor atten
dance at lectures and a widespread failure to
engage deeply with course materials."
The report comments on low student ap
proval of IHUM and described a phenome
non known as "IHUM kid" students
mocked by others for deep interest in the
course material.
"Paradoxically, the very program we in
tend to fire students' imaginations and awak
en them to the possibilities of university-level
learning has become the paradigmatic 'tick
box' requirement," the report reads.
As a result, the committee recommends
replacing IHUM with a one-quarter Think
ing Matters course, which would be devel
oped and overseen by a governance board
made up of faculty across the University. A
pilot program of these courses would begin
during the upcoming 2012 to 2013 academic
year.
"Our idea is that by taking a Thinking
Matters course, students can have some of
the experiences that are exemplified by fall
quarter IHUM," McConnell said. "But that
you can choose whether to do that in the hu
manities, the sciences, the social sciences. You
can choose the idea that you want to ex
plore."
The report lists possible Thinking Matters
courses such as "Evil" taught by philosophy
professor Chris Bobonich; "The Nature of
Law" with Dean of Stanford Law School
Larry Kramer; and a course entitled "Social
Animals, Social Revolutions, Social Revolu
tions," which would be co-taught by French
professor Dan Edelstein, biology professor
Deborah Gordon and professor of computer

science Eric Roberts. Faculty members have
not yet committed to these courses, accord
ing to the report.

The new courses would be smaller in size
than most IHUM classes and would not be
restricted to humanities-related topics. While
mandatory for freshman, Thinking Matters
would be open to all four classes.
"All students are required to take one, but
they have the incentive to take more if they
want because it will count towards breadth
requirements," said Aysha Bagchi 'll, one of
the two student members of the committee,
Bagchi, a recent recipient of the Rhodes
scholarship and a former Daily columnist,
said her own IHUM experience was mostly
positive, but could understand some of the
resentment directed at the program by stu
dents.
"It does take up a big part of your fresh
man year, and it does make it hard to ex
plore," she said.
Bagchi said that a minor recommenda
tion of the committee is to alter the grading
system that was previously used IHUM. The
report referenced, "the severity and seeming
arbitrariness of the grading system," and the
fact that "many students referred to the pro
gram as 'B-HUM.'"
Some have questioned whether the new
program will differ substantially from
IHUM. Many of the proposed courses are
current fall-quarter IHUM classes, such as
"The Poet Remaking the World," "Can the
People Rule?" and "Epic Journeys." Accord
ing to ASSU Senator Dan DeLong 'l3, some
students that he has talked to are worried
that the new program is simply an "IHUM
name-change."
English professor and SUES committee
member Jennifer Summit, who has previous
ly taught in the IHUM program, said that
Thinking Matters will focus less on specific
content and more on the learning process.
She added that instead of simply being an in
troduction to humanities, the curriculum
would be "an introduction to college-level
analysis."
Introductory Seminars
One of the most contentious recommen
dations of the report is to require each fresh
man to take at least one introductory semi
nar, to provide a variety of learning environ
ments to students in the first year of study.
"On one hand, we want every freshman to
get to know a faculty member, in all of our
quirkiness and our passion for what we do,"
McConnell said. "We think the advantages of
being in a seminar are really worth the re
quirement. That's a subset of the committee,
and a small majority. There is another set of
people both in the committee and in the Uni
versity who worry. They agree with the goals,
but they worry that by requiring the seminar

that the seminars will lose some of their at
tractiveness to students. And the last thing we
want to do is to damage a great program."
McConnell compared the proposed re
quirement to the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) which, while a requirement,
receives mostly positive feedback from stu
dents, McConnell said, due to a wide variety
of course options.
"We had a huge debate in the committee
about this issue," Bagchi said. "I think most
people were initially divided, so we had a re
ally open debate."
Bagchi noted that most committee mem
bers are very positive about IntroSems but
fear the effect of making them a require
ment.

A student representative of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Standards and Poli
cies (C-USP), Stephen Trusheim 'l3, voiced
his concerns on Thursday in an email sent to
the undergraduate ASSU Senate list.
"I worry that, no matter what, a require
ment will lead to people getting stuck in class
es that they don't want to take, which will ruin
the class for everyone else," Trusheim wrote,
arguing that the best aspect of IntroSems is
found in the enthusiasm of students to be
present and learn about a topic of interest in
a close setting.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Harry Elam addressed an issue of supply
and demand concerning Introductory Semi
nars but said that he believes that shifting to
a requirement would be possible, both be
cause faculty members enjoy teaching the
seminars and being able to choose their stu
dents through applications. Elam said there
are currently 120 IntroSems offered per year.

Residential learning
McConnell noted in the Faculty Senate
meeting that there is a perceived "disconnect
between the academic and residential lives"
of Stanford students. The report heralded
SLE as "a model of integrated residential
learning," a program through which fresh
men students attend classes and discussions
in their East Florence Moore dormitory.
"The kind of moniker of 'IHUM kid' for
somebody that tries to bring up something
that he's learned in IHUM when we went
to SEE, we didn't find that," Campbell said.
"We found that students are living together.
They're learning together. They're arguing
about stuff over dinner."
While the report does not recommend
mandating SLE stating that the program
"flourishes precisely because it is a small, al
ternative program that students choose to
join" it does call for the creation of similar
programs where students can choose to learn
in their residential environments. The report
advises organizing these new resi
dential programs around a variety
of themes, so they would attract a
diverse body of students.
According to the report, one
possibility is to organize these
programs around the five themes
of the Stanford Challenge Initia
tive: human health, the environ
ment, international studies, edu
cation and the arts. The report
adds, however, that it is important
that these themes grow "organi
cally" out of student and faculty
interest.
The report also notes the diffi
culty of recruiting faculty mem
bers to serve as Residential Fel
lows (RFs), tasked with living in
undergraduate dormitories and
engaging with student residents.
According to the report, only 14
of the 62 RFs on campus are mem
bers of the Academic Council.
While the report did not conclude
that this was significant problem,
it did recommend finding new
ways to encourage faculty mem
bers to take on the post.
The committee recommended
that the University also explore
how faculty members could en
gage in residential life in other,
less time-intensive ways. One sug
gestion was for professors to give
talks, participate in discussions
and teach seminars in undergrad
uate residences.
Focusing on residential living
after freshman year, the report ex
pressed some concerns about the
trend of seniors choosing to live in
Row houses, a collection of stu
dent-run houses, noting that these
students "largely pass out of the
orbit of the Office of Residential
Education."
In his email to the public
ASSU Senate list-serve, Trusheim
took offense to the report's con
clusion that "for many seniors, the
appeal of the Row clearly has less
to do with self-government than

with the opportunity to host par
ties with less stringent supervision
than in non-Row houses."
"This is particularly insulting
because I think it expresses a de
sire to do away with self-ops/co
ops in favor of a much more cen
tralized program under tight con
trol of ResEd," Trusheim wrote.
Bagchi, who lived in the self-op
Xanadu last year, said the report
was not recommending any signif
icant changes to the Row pro
gram, but recognizing a possible
cultural issue to address.
"The recommendations don't
involve suddenly inserting faculty
members in Row houses that's
not going to happen," she said.
Instead, one solution that the
committee proposed was giving
seniors more housing options such
as a "residential research college,"
which would provide mentoring
for students completing a honors
theses or capstone project. Sum
mit said this idea was inspired by
the September Honors College.
What's next?
"The SUES report is a radical
document, less because it proposes
to redesign undergraduate educa
tion than because it tries to get at
the root of teaching and learning,"
wrote James J. Sheehan, chair of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) from 1993 to
1994, in the document's preface,
"The report is also a conservative
document because it is tightly con
nected to Stanford's distinctive
character and traditions."
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Standards and Policies (C
-USP) will make recommendations
in response to the report at a Feb.
23 Faculty Senate meeting. The
Senate will then vote on the final
recommendations at its next meet
ing on March 8.
