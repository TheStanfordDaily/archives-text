# STUDENT LIFE
## Responding to student mental health crises 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
This piece, originally published April 30,
2012, was the first in a four-part series on cri
sis response and mental health resources on
campus.
Following the death of sophomore stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat on March 25 and
reports of several attempted suicides on
campus this year, The Daily has undertaken
a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reac
tion in the days and weeks directly follow
ing Sam Wopat's suicide attempt and her
death, exploring questions about how the
University responds to student death, espe
cially in cases of suicide. Next, The Daily
will examine prevention, examining Uni
versity systems in place to identify and help
students in crisis and addressing reports of
additional suicide attempts in campus resi
dences. The Daily will then take a broader
look at widespread student experience with
mental health resources on campus and will
highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on
communicating the death of a student were
doubly present as Cady Hine, a junior Eng
lish major who worked to establish Stan

ford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigma
tize mental health and illness on campus,
died on April 1 in her Palo Alto residence,
within a week of Wo pat's death. The cause
of Hine's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily
has compiled details of the night of Wopat's
suicide attempt in her Suites residence and
how resident assistants (RAs) and Univer
sity officials responded that night and in the
following days. Several RAs in Suites felt
the University response following Wopat's
death was inadequate, while others ex
pressed gratitude for the University's guid
ance. In addition, the response or lack
thereof from the University to the larger
student body regarding student death has
been a source of tension between students
who want information and University offi
cials who seek to respect the privacy of vic
tims and their families.

University administrators cited federal
privacy laws, the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the
Health Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases
with The Daily and the general campus.
Crisis in Suites
Resident assistants in Suites were split
over the effectiveness of the University's

reaction on the night of Wopat's attempt
and during her weeklong hospitalization
prior to her death. Two RAs expressed frus
tration with a lack of explicit directives on
how to address resident questions and emo
tional responses to Wopat's hospitalization,
though the other Suites RAs said Universi
ty officials were very helpful throughout
the process.
"I don't feel like the University was
there to help us as RAs," said Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3, also a
Suites RA, commented that it was difficult
not to relay information since many resi
dents were present as ambulances arrived
on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all three floors of
Jenkins [the house adjacent to Wopat's res
idence] all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window looking,"
O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance the
sirens were going on outside," Wylie said.
"People were going to be like 'What's going
on?'"
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2, who said
that many students witnessed the presence
of EMTs, also said that very little informa
tion could be released because very little in
formation was available at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowledged that

Valentina del Olmo, the Residence Dean
responsible for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that having an
adult present on campus that night would
have been helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult presence in the
dorm following Wopat's hospitalization
would have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting nearby resident
fellows (RF) in the Sterling Quad or EAST,
Murray or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since Suites does
not have an RF. She added she did not feel
supported by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt, and that
she did not know how to respond to stu
dents as an RA and as a fellow student
following Wopat's hospitalization. In her
opinion, the University failed to give ade
quate directives to the Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what to do," she
said. "It felt very futile."
O'Rourke said she was told a few days
after Wopat's hospitalization not to convey
further information to students who did not
know what had happened, but to ensure
general resident well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to do the
personal thing because you're part of the
voice of the University almost," O'Rourke
added. "You don't want to act as
an RA without the University
backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they
would have appreciated having
more information about what
they could and could not say to
students.
"I didn't know what face I was
supposed to be wearing," Foust
said.
The Suites RAs announced a
vigil held for Wopat two days after
her hospitalization, mentioning
neither her name or what had oc
curred.
"Saturday was a hard night for
many members of our communi
ty," the RAs wrote to the Suites
mailing list. "If you would like to
send love/support for those in
volved, take a trip to Maples
Pavilion. At the entrance is a tree
from which we are hanging mes
sages, notes, drawings, etc. Materi
als should be in a brown bag near
the tree."
Some Suites residents attend
ed the vigil and left, without ever
knowing Wopat's name.
"They should have been going
around that night"
O'Rourke was uncomfortable
with an apparent hands-off ap
proach following Wopat's death,
especially when she was asked by
the Suites ResEd supervisor to
check up on the residences of
Griffin, Wopat's house within
Suites.
"We got an email one or two
days later saying, 'You have to go
around Griffin again and talk to
each room,'" O'Rourke said.
"And I was like 'Why am I going
around Griffin? I think a [Coun
seling and Pschological Services]
counselor should go around Grif
fin they should have been
going around that night.'"
"I think CAPS counselors
should have been here the day
after [Wopat attempted suicide]
going around Griffin," O'Rourke
said. Wylie agreed.
Communication between RAs
and the University also appeared
to be a problem. Both RAs ex
pressed frustration with limited

prior announcement of an aca
demic advising event held for
Suites residents to assess their op
tions for finishing winter quarter
coursework while dealing with
Wopat's hospitalization.
"We weren't even notified
about that," O'Rourke said.
All four Suites RAs said they
received emails from administra
tors commending them for their
work during such a difficult time.
Foust said the messages felt more
reactive than prescriptive.
Frazier said he felt the Univer
sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall I think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she understood
privacy concerns but got a differ
ent sense from the University.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder said she re
ceived feedback from Suites resi
dents about a lack of University
presence in the dorm, but stressed
that action by RAs is more mean
ingful than administrator pres
ence and that ResEd coordinated
with the Suites RAs.
"We got some feedback from
folks who live in Suites, saying 'the
University's not doing anything
for us,"' Golder said. "All of the
things that RAs were doing, etc.
were our involvement. It feels like
'the University is not involved,'
but of course we are. What's more
helpful to a student? Me? I think
a student who you know is more
accessible to you than I am.
Maybe those don't look public
enough. That's not the intention."
University communication
With the exception of an email
ResEd sent to the Suites residen
tial community following Wopat's
death, the University has not sent
any direct messages to the student
body announcing the deaths of
Wopat or Hine, memorial services
for the deceased students or exist
ing resources for grieving or
stressed students.
On April 2, Vice Provost of

Student Affairs Greg Boardman
published an op-ed in The Daily
announcing Wopat's death to
those who may not have known,
stating that the University would
likely not offer additional infor
mation in deference to family pri
vacy and communicating the
availability of campus mental
health resources.
On April 17, The Daily ran an
op-ed by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior associate dean
of the Office for Religious Life;
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of CAPS; and Jim
Cadena, director of the Arts in
Residential Education program,
about their work with Hine,
Still, several students have ex
pressed frustration with a lack of
communication about the student
deaths, while the University con
tinues to stress the importance of
maintaining the privacy of fami
lies during times of loss.
Stanford was not the only top
university to experience student
death in recent weeks. In compar
ison, the Dean of Harvard Col
lege and the Dean of Yale College
each sent messages to their entire
student populations announcing
student deaths that that occurred
on their respective campuses in
the past two weeks. Each Univer
sity relayed information about
the deaths, the availability of
mental health resources on cam
pus and details for vigils via cam
pus-wide emails on the same day
the students had died, though nei
ther included suicide as the cause
of death in communication to stu
dents.
"Harvard never acknowl
edged any cause of death," Har
vard sophomore Nicholas Rine
hart wrote in a Facebook message
to The Daily.
"People here are actually pret
ty upset that Harvard is not taking
this opportunity to talk about sui
cide and mental health in any real
way, instead pretending like [sui
cide] doesn't happen," Rinehart
wrote,
Stanford Dean of Student Af
fairs Chris Griffith responded to
The Daily about how the Univer
sity communicates news of stu
dent deaths, saying that Stanford
defers to the privacy concerns of
family members and does not
have a specific policy on broader
disemmination of the news.
"Our immediate response
when one of our students dies is to
support the student's family,
friends, and others who are im

pacted and to ensure that they
have access to University re
sources that provide help and
comfort," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Our response
does not require a specific notifi
cation to the community; but
rather we evaluate the circum
stances and consider the need for
privacy of family members and of
students and others who are im
pacted at Stanford as well as regu
lations that may prevent us from
releasing information."

Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote to
The Daily that he thinks the Uni
versity can balance the privacy
needs of families while having an
open dialogue about suicide.
"We always work hard to re
spect the privacy of individuals,"
Boardman said. "Each situation
poses its unique circumstances,
and, often there is much that the
University is unable to disclose.
Yet, we always engage with open
dialogue on the associated topics
on mental health and suicide,
broadly."
This policy has upset some stu
dents, and Ron Albucher, director
of CAPS, said he understands
where that frustration originates.
"I totally get why students feel
frustrated about this because
there seems to be a lack of com
munication from the University
to the student body about it," Al
bucher said. "The University
struggles with balancing the
needs of the students with the pri
vacy issues of the families in
volved. And that's where the Uni
versity has sided more."
Silence on Cady Hine
The silence surrounding
Wopat's death wasn't the only
cause of frustration for some stu

dents. Stanford lost another stu
dent on April 1, when Cady Hine,
a junior with a history of bipolar
disorder who worked to address
the stigma surrounding mental
health and mental illness on cam
pus, died while on spring break at
the age of 24. No additional news
of the circumstances of Hine's
death has been reported.
The Stanford Report an
nounced Cady Hine's death on
April 6, and The Daily printed an
obituary on April 17, along with
the previously mentioned op-ed.
No official University communi
cation was sent.
Helena Bonde, a fifth year sen
ior who befriended Hine when
they met in 2008, expressed frus
tration with how long and
through what channels news
about Hine's death and memorial
services traveled, especially at the
late response of both the Univer
sity and The Daily.
"I was pissed that there wasn't
more news about [Cady's] death,"
Bonde said." I mean, Cady was a
really wonderful member of our
community and there wasn't even
a Daily article until after her me
morial service which was two
weeks after her death."
Bonde said she did not find out
about Hine's death through ei
ther the Report or The Daily.
"I found out about it from a
friend emailing me because she'd
seen someone link to the Stanford
News update website-thing
that I'd never even looked at be
fore in my life," she said. "There
are probably quite a few people
who didn't even know about
Cady's death until after the me
morial."

tration with a lack of explicit directives on
how to address resident questions and emo
tional responses to Wopat's hospitalization,
though the other Suites RAs said Universi
ty officials were very helpful throughout
the process.
"I don't feel like the University was
there to help us as RAs," said Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3, also a
Suites RA, commented that it was difficult
not to relay information since many resi
dents were present as ambulances arrived
on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all three floors of
Jenkins [the house adjacent to Wopat's res
idence] all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window looking,"
O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance the
sirens were going on outside," Wylie said.
"People were going to be like 'What's going
on?'"
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2, who said
that many students witnessed the presence
of EMTs, also said that very little informa
tion could be released because very little in
formation was available at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowledged that

Valentina del Olmo, the Residence Dean
responsible for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that having an
adult present on campus that night would
have been helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult presence in the
dorm following Wopat's hospitalization
would have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting nearby resident
fellows (RF) in the Sterling Quad or EAST,
Murray or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since Suites does
not have an RF. She added she did not feel
supported by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt, and that
she did not know how to respond to stu
dents as an RA and as a fellow student
following Wopat's hospitalization. In her
opinion, the University failed to give ade
quate directives to the Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what to do," she
said. "It felt very futile."
O'Rourke said she was told a few days
after Wopat's hospitalization not to convey
further information to students who did not
know what had happened, but to ensure
general resident well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to do the
personal thing because you're part of the
voice of the University almost," O'Rourke
added. "You don't want to act as
an RA without the University
backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they
would have appreciated having
more information about what
they could and could not say to
students.
"I didn't know what face I was
supposed to be wearing," Foust
said.
The Suites RAs announced a
vigil held for Wopat two days after
her hospitalization, mentioning
neither her name or what had oc
curred.
"Saturday was a hard night for
many members of our communi
ty," the RAs wrote to the Suites
mailing list. "If you would like to
send love/support for those in
volved, take a trip to Maples
Pavilion. At the entrance is a tree
from which we are hanging mes
sages, notes, drawings, etc. Materi
als should be in a brown bag near
the tree."
Some Suites residents attend
ed the vigil and left, without ever
knowing Wopat's name.
"They should have been going
around that night"
O'Rourke was uncomfortable
with an apparent hands-off ap
proach following Wopat's death,
especially when she was asked by
the Suites ResEd supervisor to
check up on the residences of
Griffin, Wopat's house within
Suites.
"We got an email one or two
days later saying, 'You have to go
around Griffin again and talk to
each room,'" O'Rourke said.
"And I was like 'Why am I going
around Griffin? I think a [Coun
seling and Pschological Services]
counselor should go around Grif
fin they should have been
going around that night.'"
"I think CAPS counselors
should have been here the day
after [Wopat attempted suicide]
going around Griffin," O'Rourke
said. Wylie agreed.
Communication between RAs
and the University also appeared
to be a problem. Both RAs ex
pressed frustration with limited

prior announcement of an aca
demic advising event held for
Suites residents to assess their op
tions for finishing winter quarter
coursework while dealing with
Wopat's hospitalization.
"We weren't even notified
about that," O'Rourke said.
All four Suites RAs said they
received emails from administra
tors commending them for their
work during such a difficult time.
Foust said the messages felt more
reactive than prescriptive.
Frazier said he felt the Univer
sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall I think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she understood
privacy concerns but got a differ
ent sense from the University.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder said she re
ceived feedback from Suites resi
dents about a lack of University
presence in the dorm, but stressed
that action by RAs is more mean
ingful than administrator pres
ence and that ResEd coordinated
with the Suites RAs.
"We got some feedback from
folks who live in Suites, saying 'the
University's not doing anything
for us,"' Golder said. "All of the
things that RAs were doing, etc.
were our involvement. It feels like
'the University is not involved,'
but of course we are. What's more
helpful to a student? Me? I think
a student who you know is more
accessible to you than I am.
Maybe those don't look public
enough. That's not the intention."
University communication
With the exception of an email
ResEd sent to the Suites residen
tial community following Wopat's
death, the University has not sent
any direct messages to the student
body announcing the deaths of
Wopat or Hine, memorial services
for the deceased students or exist
ing resources for grieving or
stressed students.
On April 2, Vice Provost of

Student Affairs Greg Boardman
published an op-ed in The Daily
announcing Wopat's death to
those who may not have known,
stating that the University would
likely not offer additional infor
mation in deference to family pri
vacy and communicating the
availability of campus mental
health resources.
On April 17, The Daily ran an
op-ed by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior associate dean
of the Office for Religious Life;
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of CAPS; and Jim
Cadena, director of the Arts in
Residential Education program,
about their work with Hine,
Still, several students have ex
pressed frustration with a lack of
communication about the student
deaths, while the University con
tinues to stress the importance of
maintaining the privacy of fami
lies during times of loss.
Stanford was not the only top
university to experience student
death in recent weeks. In compar
ison, the Dean of Harvard Col
lege and the Dean of Yale College
each sent messages to their entire
student populations announcing
student deaths that that occurred
on their respective campuses in
the past two weeks. Each Univer
sity relayed information about
the deaths, the availability of
mental health resources on cam
pus and details for vigils via cam
pus-wide emails on the same day
the students had died, though nei
ther included suicide as the cause
of death in communication to stu
dents.
"Harvard never acknowl
edged any cause of death," Har
vard sophomore Nicholas Rine
hart wrote in a Facebook message
to The Daily.
"People here are actually pret
ty upset that Harvard is not taking
this opportunity to talk about sui
cide and mental health in any real
way, instead pretending like [sui
cide] doesn't happen," Rinehart
wrote,
Stanford Dean of Student Af
fairs Chris Griffith responded to
The Daily about how the Univer
sity communicates news of stu
dent deaths, saying that Stanford
defers to the privacy concerns of
family members and does not
have a specific policy on broader
disemmination of the news.
"Our immediate response
when one of our students dies is to
support the student's family,
friends, and others who are im

pacted and to ensure that they
have access to University re
sources that provide help and
comfort," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Our response
does not require a specific notifi
cation to the community; but
rather we evaluate the circum
stances and consider the need for
privacy of family members and of
students and others who are im
pacted at Stanford as well as regu
lations that may prevent us from
releasing information."

Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote to
The Daily that he thinks the Uni
versity can balance the privacy
needs of families while having an
open dialogue about suicide.
"We always work hard to re
spect the privacy of individuals,"
Boardman said. "Each situation
poses its unique circumstances,
and, often there is much that the
University is unable to disclose.
Yet, we always engage with open
dialogue on the associated topics
on mental health and suicide,
broadly."
This policy has upset some stu
dents, and Ron Albucher, director
of CAPS, said he understands
where that frustration originates.
"I totally get why students feel
frustrated about this because
there seems to be a lack of com
munication from the University
to the student body about it," Al
bucher said. "The University
struggles with balancing the
needs of the students with the pri
vacy issues of the families in
volved. And that's where the Uni
versity has sided more."
Silence on Cady Hine
The silence surrounding
Wopat's death wasn't the only
cause of frustration for some stu

dents. Stanford lost another stu
dent on April 1, when Cady Hine,
a junior with a history of bipolar
disorder who worked to address
the stigma surrounding mental
health and mental illness on cam
pus, died while on spring break at
the age of 24. No additional news
of the circumstances of Hine's
death has been reported.
The Stanford Report an
nounced Cady Hine's death on
April 6, and The Daily printed an
obituary on April 17, along with
the previously mentioned op-ed.
No official University communi
cation was sent.
Helena Bonde, a fifth year sen
ior who befriended Hine when
they met in 2008, expressed frus
tration with how long and
through what channels news
about Hine's death and memorial
services traveled, especially at the
late response of both the Univer
sity and The Daily.
"I was pissed that there wasn't
more news about [Cady's] death,"
Bonde said." I mean, Cady was a
really wonderful member of our
community and there wasn't even
a Daily article until after her me
morial service which was two
weeks after her death."
Bonde said she did not find out
about Hine's death through ei
ther the Report or The Daily.
"I found out about it from a
friend emailing me because she'd
seen someone link to the Stanford
News update website-thing
that I'd never even looked at be
fore in my life," she said. "There
are probably quite a few people
who didn't even know about
Cady's death until after the me
morial."

This piece, originally published April 30,
2012, was the first in a four-part series on cri
sis response and mental health resources on
campus.
Following the death of sophomore stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat on March 25 and
reports of several attempted suicides on
campus this year, The Daily has undertaken
a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reac
tion in the days and weeks directly follow
ing Sam Wopat's suicide attempt and her
death, exploring questions about how the
University responds to student death, espe
cially in cases of suicide. Next, The Daily
will examine prevention, examining Uni
versity systems in place to identify and help
students in crisis and addressing reports of
additional suicide attempts in campus resi
dences. The Daily will then take a broader
look at widespread student experience with
mental health resources on campus and will
highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on
communicating the death of a student were
doubly present as Cady Hine, a junior Eng
lish major who worked to establish Stan

ford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigma
tize mental health and illness on campus,
died on April 1 in her Palo Alto residence,
within a week of Wo pat's death. The cause
of Hine's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily
has compiled details of the night of Wopat's
suicide attempt in her Suites residence and
how resident assistants (RAs) and Univer
sity officials responded that night and in the
following days. Several RAs in Suites felt
the University response following Wopat's
death was inadequate, while others ex
pressed gratitude for the University's guid
ance. In addition, the response or lack
thereof from the University to the larger
student body regarding student death has
been a source of tension between students
who want information and University offi
cials who seek to respect the privacy of vic
tims and their families.

University administrators cited federal
privacy laws, the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the
Health Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases
with The Daily and the general campus.

over the effectiveness of the University's

backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they
would have appreciated having
more information about what
they could and could not say to
students.
"I didn't know what face I was
supposed to be wearing," Foust
said.
The Suites RAs announced a
vigil held for Wopat two days after
her hospitalization, mentioning
neither her name or what had oc
curred.
"Saturday was a hard night for
many members of our communi
ty," the RAs wrote to the Suites
mailing list. "If you would like to
send love/support for those in
volved, take a trip to Maples
Pavilion. At the entrance is a tree
from which we are hanging mes
sages, notes, drawings, etc. Materi
als should be in a brown bag near
the tree."
Some Suites residents attend
ed the vigil and left, without ever
knowing Wopat's name.
"They should have been going
around that night"
O'Rourke was uncomfortable
with an apparent hands-off ap
proach following Wopat's death,
especially when she was asked by
the Suites ResEd supervisor to
check up on the residences of
Griffin, Wopat's house within
Suites.
"We got an email one or two
days later saying, 'You have to go
around Griffin again and talk to
each room,'" O'Rourke said.
"And I was like 'Why am I going
around Griffin? I think a [Coun
seling and Pschological Services]
counselor should go around Grif
fin they should have been
going around that night.'"
"I think CAPS counselors
should have been here the day
after [Wopat attempted suicide]
going around Griffin," O'Rourke
said. Wylie agreed.
Communication between RAs
and the University also appeared
to be a problem. Both RAs ex
pressed frustration with limited

prior announcement of an aca
demic advising event held for
Suites residents to assess their op
tions for finishing winter quarter
coursework while dealing with
Wopat's hospitalization.
"We weren't even notified
about that," O'Rourke said.
All four Suites RAs said they
received emails from administra
tors commending them for their
work during such a difficult time.
Foust said the messages felt more
reactive than prescriptive.
Frazier said he felt the Univer
sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall I think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she understood
privacy concerns but got a differ
ent sense from the University.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder said she re
ceived feedback from Suites resi
dents about a lack of University
presence in the dorm, but stressed
that action by RAs is more mean
ingful than administrator pres
ence and that ResEd coordinated
with the Suites RAs.
"We got some feedback from
folks who live in Suites, saying 'the
University's not doing anything
for us,"' Golder said. "All of the
things that RAs were doing, etc.
were our involvement. It feels like
'the University is not involved,'
but of course we are. What's more
helpful to a student? Me? I think
a student who you know is more
accessible to you than I am.
Maybe those don't look public
enough. That's not the intention."
University communication
With the exception of an email
ResEd sent to the Suites residen
tial community following Wopat's
death, the University has not sent
any direct messages to the student
body announcing the deaths of
Wopat or Hine, memorial services
for the deceased students or exist
ing resources for grieving or
stressed students.
On April 2, Vice Provost of

Student Affairs Greg Boardman
published an op-ed in The Daily
announcing Wopat's death to
those who may not have known,
stating that the University would
likely not offer additional infor
mation in deference to family pri
vacy and communicating the
availability of campus mental
health resources.
On April 17, The Daily ran an
op-ed by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior associate dean
of the Office for Religious Life;
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of CAPS; and Jim
Cadena, director of the Arts in
Residential Education program,
about their work with Hine,
Still, several students have ex
pressed frustration with a lack of
communication about the student
deaths, while the University con
tinues to stress the importance of
maintaining the privacy of fami
lies during times of loss.
Stanford was not the only top
university to experience student
death in recent weeks. In compar
ison, the Dean of Harvard Col
lege and the Dean of Yale College
each sent messages to their entire
student populations announcing
student deaths that that occurred
on their respective campuses in
the past two weeks. Each Univer
sity relayed information about
the deaths, the availability of
mental health resources on cam
pus and details for vigils via cam
pus-wide emails on the same day
the students had died, though nei
ther included suicide as the cause
of death in communication to stu
dents.
"Harvard never acknowl
edged any cause of death," Har
vard sophomore Nicholas Rine
hart wrote in a Facebook message
to The Daily.
"People here are actually pret
ty upset that Harvard is not taking
this opportunity to talk about sui
cide and mental health in any real
way, instead pretending like [sui
cide] doesn't happen," Rinehart
wrote,
Stanford Dean of Student Af
fairs Chris Griffith responded to
The Daily about how the Univer
sity communicates news of stu
dent deaths, saying that Stanford
defers to the privacy concerns of
family members and does not
have a specific policy on broader
disemmination of the news.
"Our immediate response
when one of our students dies is to
support the student's family,
friends, and others who are im

pacted and to ensure that they
have access to University re
sources that provide help and
comfort," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Our response
does not require a specific notifi
cation to the community; but
rather we evaluate the circum
stances and consider the need for
privacy of family members and of
students and others who are im
pacted at Stanford as well as regu
lations that may prevent us from
releasing information."

Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote to
The Daily that he thinks the Uni
versity can balance the privacy
needs of families while having an
open dialogue about suicide.
"We always work hard to re
spect the privacy of individuals,"
Boardman said. "Each situation
poses its unique circumstances,
and, often there is much that the
University is unable to disclose.
Yet, we always engage with open
dialogue on the associated topics
on mental health and suicide,
broadly."
This policy has upset some stu
dents, and Ron Albucher, director
of CAPS, said he understands
where that frustration originates.
"I totally get why students feel
frustrated about this because
there seems to be a lack of com
munication from the University
to the student body about it," Al
bucher said. "The University
struggles with balancing the
needs of the students with the pri
vacy issues of the families in
volved. And that's where the Uni
versity has sided more."
Silence on Cady Hine
The silence surrounding
Wopat's death wasn't the only
cause of frustration for some stu

dents. Stanford lost another stu
dent on April 1, when Cady Hine,
a junior with a history of bipolar
disorder who worked to address
the stigma surrounding mental
health and mental illness on cam
pus, died while on spring break at
the age of 24. No additional news
of the circumstances of Hine's
death has been reported.
The Stanford Report an
nounced Cady Hine's death on
April 6, and The Daily printed an
obituary on April 17, along with
the previously mentioned op-ed.
No official University communi
cation was sent.
Helena Bonde, a fifth year sen
ior who befriended Hine when
they met in 2008, expressed frus
tration with how long and
through what channels news
about Hine's death and memorial
services traveled, especially at the
late response of both the Univer
sity and The Daily.
"I was pissed that there wasn't
more news about [Cady's] death,"
Bonde said." I mean, Cady was a
really wonderful member of our
community and there wasn't even
a Daily article until after her me
morial service which was two
weeks after her death."
Bonde said she did not find out
about Hine's death through ei
ther the Report or The Daily.
"I found out about it from a
friend emailing me because she'd
seen someone link to the Stanford
News update website-thing
that I'd never even looked at be
fore in my life," she said. "There
are probably quite a few people
who didn't even know about
Cady's death until after the me
morial."

This piece, originally published April 30,
2012, was the first in a four-part series on cri
sis response and mental health resources on
campus.
Following the death of sophomore stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat on March 25 and
reports of several attempted suicides on
campus this year, The Daily has undertaken
a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reac
tion in the days and weeks directly follow
ing Sam Wopat's suicide attempt and her
death, exploring questions about how the
University responds to student death, espe
cially in cases of suicide. Next, The Daily
will examine prevention, examining Uni
versity systems in place to identify and help
students in crisis and addressing reports of
additional suicide attempts in campus resi
dences. The Daily will then take a broader
look at widespread student experience with
mental health resources on campus and will
highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on
communicating the death of a student were
doubly present as Cady Hine, a junior Eng
lish major who worked to establish Stan

ford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigma
tize mental health and illness on campus,
died on April 1 in her Palo Alto residence,
within a week of Wo pat's death. The cause
of Hine's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily
has compiled details of the night of Wopat's
suicide attempt in her Suites residence and
how resident assistants (RAs) and Univer
sity officials responded that night and in the
following days. Several RAs in Suites felt
the University response following Wopat's
death was inadequate, while others ex
pressed gratitude for the University's guid
ance. In addition, the response or lack
thereof from the University to the larger
student body regarding student death has
been a source of tension between students
who want information and University offi
cials who seek to respect the privacy of vic
tims and their families.

University administrators cited federal
privacy laws, the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the
Health Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases
with The Daily and the general campus.
Crisis in Suites
Resident assistants in Suites were split
over the effectiveness of the University's

reaction on the night of Wopat's attempt
and during her weeklong hospitalization
prior to her death. Two RAs expressed frus
tration with a lack of explicit directives on
how to address resident questions and emo
tional responses to Wopat's hospitalization,
though the other Suites RAs said Universi
ty officials were very helpful throughout
the process.
"I don't feel like the University was
there to help us as RAs," said Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3, also a
Suites RA, commented that it was difficult
not to relay information since many resi
dents were present as ambulances arrived
on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all three floors of
Jenkins [the house adjacent to Wopat's res
idence] all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window looking,"
O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance the
sirens were going on outside," Wylie said.
"People were going to be like 'What's going
on?'"
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2, who said
that many students witnessed the presence
of EMTs, also said that very little informa
tion could be released because very little in
formation was available at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowledged that

Valentina del Olmo, the Residence Dean
responsible for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that having an
adult present on campus that night would
have been helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult presence in the
dorm following Wopat's hospitalization
would have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting nearby resident
fellows (RF) in the Sterling Quad or EAST,
Murray or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since Suites does
not have an RF. She added she did not feel
supported by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt, and that
she did not know how to respond to stu
dents as an RA and as a fellow student
following Wopat's hospitalization. In her
opinion, the University failed to give ade
quate directives to the Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what to do," she
said. "It felt very futile."
O'Rourke said she was told a few days
after Wopat's hospitalization not to convey
further information to students who did not
know what had happened, but to ensure
general resident well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to do the
personal thing because you're part of the
voice of the University almost," O'Rourke
added. "You don't want to act as
an RA without the University
backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they

sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall I think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she understood
privacy concerns but got a differ
ent sense from the University.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder said she re
ceived feedback from Suites resi
dents about a lack of University
presence in the dorm, but stressed
that action by RAs is more mean
ingful than administrator pres
ence and that ResEd coordinated
with the Suites RAs.
"We got some feedback from
folks who live in Suites, saying 'the
University's not doing anything
for us,"' Golder said. "All of the
things that RAs were doing, etc.
were our involvement. It feels like
'the University is not involved,'
but of course we are. What's more
helpful to a student? Me? I think
a student who you know is more
accessible to you than I am.
Maybe those don't look public
enough. That's not the intention."
University communication
With the exception of an email
ResEd sent to the Suites residen
tial community following Wopat's
death, the University has not sent
any direct messages to the student
body announcing the deaths of
Wopat or Hine, memorial services
for the deceased students or exist
ing resources for grieving or
stressed students.
On April 2, Vice Provost of

Student Affairs Greg Boardman
published an op-ed in The Daily
announcing Wopat's death to
those who may not have known,
stating that the University would
likely not offer additional infor
mation in deference to family pri
vacy and communicating the
availability of campus mental
health resources.
On April 17, The Daily ran an
op-ed by Rabbi Patricia Karlin-
Neumann, senior associate dean
of the Office for Religious Life;
Alejandro Martinez, senior asso
ciate director of CAPS; and Jim
Cadena, director of the Arts in
Residential Education program,
about their work with Hine,
Still, several students have ex
pressed frustration with a lack of
communication about the student
deaths, while the University con
tinues to stress the importance of
maintaining the privacy of fami
lies during times of loss.
Stanford was not the only top
university to experience student
death in recent weeks. In compar
ison, the Dean of Harvard Col
lege and the Dean of Yale College
each sent messages to their entire
student populations announcing
student deaths that that occurred
on their respective campuses in
the past two weeks. Each Univer
sity relayed information about
the deaths, the availability of
mental health resources on cam
pus and details for vigils via cam
pus-wide emails on the same day
the students had died, though nei
ther included suicide as the cause
of death in communication to stu
dents.
"Harvard never acknowl
edged any cause of death," Har
vard sophomore Nicholas Rine
hart wrote in a Facebook message
to The Daily.
"People here are actually pret
ty upset that Harvard is not taking
this opportunity to talk about sui
cide and mental health in any real
way, instead pretending like [sui
cide] doesn't happen," Rinehart
wrote,
Stanford Dean of Student Af
fairs Chris Griffith responded to
The Daily about how the Univer
sity communicates news of stu
dent deaths, saying that Stanford
defers to the privacy concerns of
family members and does not
have a specific policy on broader
disemmination of the news.
"Our immediate response
when one of our students dies is to
support the student's family,
friends, and others who are im

pacted and to ensure that they
have access to University re
sources that provide help and
comfort," Griffith wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Our response
does not require a specific notifi
cation to the community; but
rather we evaluate the circum
stances and consider the need for
privacy of family members and of
students and others who are im
pacted at Stanford as well as regu
lations that may prevent us from
releasing information."

Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman wrote to
The Daily that he thinks the Uni
versity can balance the privacy
needs of families while having an
open dialogue about suicide.
"We always work hard to re
spect the privacy of individuals,"
Boardman said. "Each situation
poses its unique circumstances,
and, often there is much that the
University is unable to disclose.
Yet, we always engage with open
dialogue on the associated topics
on mental health and suicide,
broadly."
This policy has upset some stu
dents, and Ron Albucher, director
of CAPS, said he understands
where that frustration originates.
"I totally get why students feel
frustrated about this because
there seems to be a lack of com
munication from the University
to the student body about it," Al
bucher said. "The University
struggles with balancing the
needs of the students with the pri
vacy issues of the families in
volved. And that's where the Uni
versity has sided more."
Silence on Cady Hine
The silence surrounding
Wopat's death wasn't the only
cause of frustration for some stu

dents. Stanford lost another stu
dent on April 1, when Cady Hine,
a junior with a history of bipolar
disorder who worked to address
the stigma surrounding mental
health and mental illness on cam
pus, died while on spring break at
the age of 24. No additional news
of the circumstances of Hine's
death has been reported.
The Stanford Report an
nounced Cady Hine's death on
April 6, and The Daily printed an
obituary on April 17, along with
the previously mentioned op-ed.
No official University communi
cation was sent.
Helena Bonde, a fifth year sen
ior who befriended Hine when
they met in 2008, expressed frus
tration with how long and
through what channels news
about Hine's death and memorial
services traveled, especially at the
late response of both the Univer
sity and The Daily.
"I was pissed that there wasn't
more news about [Cady's] death,"
Bonde said." I mean, Cady was a
really wonderful member of our
community and there wasn't even
a Daily article until after her me
morial service which was two
weeks after her death."
Bonde said she did not find out
about Hine's death through ei
ther the Report or The Daily.
"I found out about it from a
friend emailing me because she'd
seen someone link to the Stanford
News update website-thing
that I'd never even looked at be
fore in my life," she said. "There
are probably quite a few people
who didn't even know about
Cady's death until after the me
morial."

This piece, originally published April 30,
2012, was the first in a four-part series on cri
sis response and mental health resources on
campus.
Following the death of sophomore stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat on March 25 and
reports of several attempted suicides on
campus this year, The Daily has undertaken
a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reac
tion in the days and weeks directly follow
ing Sam Wopat's suicide attempt and her
death, exploring questions about how the
University responds to student death, espe
cially in cases of suicide. Next, The Daily
will examine prevention, examining Uni
versity systems in place to identify and help
students in crisis and addressing reports of
additional suicide attempts in campus resi
dences. The Daily will then take a broader
look at widespread student experience with
mental health resources on campus and will
highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on
communicating the death of a student were
doubly present as Cady Hine, a junior Eng
lish major who worked to establish Stan

ford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigma
tize mental health and illness on campus,
died on April 1 in her Palo Alto residence,
within a week of Wo pat's death. The cause
of Hine's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily
has compiled details of the night of Wopat's
suicide attempt in her Suites residence and
how resident assistants (RAs) and Univer
sity officials responded that night and in the
following days. Several RAs in Suites felt
the University response following Wopat's
death was inadequate, while others ex
pressed gratitude for the University's guid
ance. In addition, the response or lack
thereof from the University to the larger
student body regarding student death has
been a source of tension between students
who want information and University offi
cials who seek to respect the privacy of vic
tims and their families.

University administrators cited federal
privacy laws, the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the
Health Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases
with The Daily and the general campus.
Crisis in Suites
Resident assistants in Suites were split
over the effectiveness of the University's

reaction on the night of Wopat's attempt
and during her weeklong hospitalization
prior to her death. Two RAs expressed frus
tration with a lack of explicit directives on
how to address resident questions and emo
tional responses to Wopat's hospitalization,
though the other Suites RAs said Universi
ty officials were very helpful throughout
the process.
"I don't feel like the University was
there to help us as RAs," said Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3, also a
Suites RA, commented that it was difficult
not to relay information since many resi
dents were present as ambulances arrived
on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all three floors of
Jenkins [the house adjacent to Wopat's res
idence] all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window looking,"
O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance the
sirens were going on outside," Wylie said.
"People were going to be like 'What's going
on?'"
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2, who said
that many students witnessed the presence
of EMTs, also said that very little informa
tion could be released because very little in
formation was available at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowledged that

Valentina del Olmo, the Residence Dean
responsible for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that having an
adult present on campus that night would
have been helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult presence in the
dorm following Wopat's hospitalization
would have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting nearby resident
fellows (RF) in the Sterling Quad or EAST,
Murray or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since Suites does
not have an RF. She added she did not feel
supported by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt, and that
she did not know how to respond to stu
dents as an RA and as a fellow student
following Wopat's hospitalization. In her
opinion, the University failed to give ade
quate directives to the Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what to do," she
said. "It felt very futile."
O'Rourke said she was told a few days
after Wopat's hospitalization not to convey
further information to students who did not
know what had happened, but to ensure
general resident well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to do the
personal thing because you're part of the
voice of the University almost," O'Rourke
added. "You don't want to act as
an RA without the University
backing you up. You feel very lost
when you don't have an explicit
direction [about what informa
tion to reveal]."
Wylie and fellow RA Juan-
Carlos Foust 'l3 agreed they
would have appreciated having
more information about what
they could and could not say to
students.
"I didn't know what face I was
supposed to be wearing," Foust
said.
The Suites RAs announced a
vigil held for Wopat two days after
her hospitalization, mentioning
neither her name or what had oc
curred.
"Saturday was a hard night for
many members of our communi
ty," the RAs wrote to the Suites
mailing list. "If you would like to
send love/support for those in
volved, take a trip to Maples
Pavilion. At the entrance is a tree
from which we are hanging mes
sages, notes, drawings, etc. Materi
als should be in a brown bag near
the tree."
Some Suites residents attend
ed the vigil and left, without ever
knowing Wopat's name.
"They should have been going
around that night"
O'Rourke was uncomfortable
with an apparent hands-off ap
proach following Wopat's death,
especially when she was asked by
the Suites ResEd supervisor to
check up on the residences of
Griffin, Wopat's house within
Suites.
"We got an email one or two
days later saying, 'You have to go
around Griffin again and talk to
each room,'" O'Rourke said.
"And I was like 'Why am I going
around Griffin? I think a [Coun
seling and Pschological Services]
counselor should go around Grif
fin they should have been
going around that night.'"
"I think CAPS counselors
should have been here the day
after [Wopat attempted suicide]
going around Griffin," O'Rourke
said. Wylie agreed.
Communication between RAs
and the University also appeared
to be a problem. Both RAs ex
pressed frustration with limited

prior announcement of an aca
demic advising event held for
Suites residents to assess their op
tions for finishing winter quarter
coursework while dealing with
Wopat's hospitalization.
"We weren't even notified
about that," O'Rourke said.
All four Suites RAs said they
received emails from administra
tors commending them for their
work during such a difficult time.
Foust said the messages felt more
reactive than prescriptive.
Frazier said he felt the Univer
sity response to the RAs was both
supportive and appropriate.
"Because ResEd stepped in to
support [us] and the University
[did] overall I think there was
a lot of support," Frazier said.
"It seemed that they were very
busy but also highly supportive,"
Foust said.
"The University said it wasn't
a measure of keeping the situa
tion quiet as much as it was up to
the family on what they chose to
disclose or not," Frazier said.
O'Rourke said she understood
privacy concerns but got a differ
ent sense from the University.
"It seemed to me like they did
n't want us to tell people," she
said.
