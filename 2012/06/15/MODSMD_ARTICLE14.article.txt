# STUDENT LIFE
## Responding to student mental health crises 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
This piece, originally published April 30,
2012, was the first in a four-part series on cri
sis response and mental health resources on
campus.
Following the death of sophomore stu
dent-athlete Sam Wopat on March 25 and
reports of several attempted suicides on
campus this year, The Daily has undertaken
a survey of existing campus resources and
culture surrounding mental health.
Today, we take a look at University reac
tion in the days and weeks directly follow
ing Sam Wopat's suicide attempt and her
death, exploring questions about how the
University responds to student death, espe
cially in cases of suicide. Next, The Daily
will examine prevention, examining Uni
versity systems in place to identify and help
students in crisis and addressing reports of
additional suicide attempts in campus resi
dences. The Daily will then take a broader
look at widespread student experience with
mental health resources on campus and will
highlight efforts to adapt campus culture
for the future.
Questions about University policy on
communicating the death of a student were
doubly present as Cady Hine, a junior Eng
lish major who worked to establish Stan

ford Peace of Mind (SPOM) to destigma
tize mental health and illness on campus,
died on April 1 in her Palo Alto residence,
within a week of Wo pat's death. The cause
of Hine's death has not yet been reported.
After a month of interviews, The Daily
has compiled details of the night of Wopat's
suicide attempt in her Suites residence and
how resident assistants (RAs) and Univer
sity officials responded that night and in the
following days. Several RAs in Suites felt
the University response following Wopat's
death was inadequate, while others ex
pressed gratitude for the University's guid
ance. In addition, the response or lack
thereof from the University to the larger
student body regarding student death has
been a source of tension between students
who want information and University offi
cials who seek to respect the privacy of vic
tims and their families.

University administrators cited federal
privacy laws, the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the
Health Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPAA) when explaining why
they are unable to discuss specific cases
with The Daily and the general campus.
Crisis in Suites
Resident assistants in Suites were split
over the effectiveness of the University's

reaction on the night of Wopat's attempt
and during her weeklong hospitalization
prior to her death. Two RAs expressed frus
tration with a lack of explicit directives on
how to address resident questions and emo
tional responses to Wopat's hospitalization,
though the other Suites RAs said Universi
ty officials were very helpful throughout
the process.
"I don't feel like the University was
there to help us as RAs," said Kiera
O'Rourke 'l3.
O'Rourke and Jen Wylie 'l3, also a
Suites RA, commented that it was difficult
not to relay information since many resi
dents were present as ambulances arrived
on campus.
"When I came in, I saw all three floors of
Jenkins [the house adjacent to Wopat's res
idence] all the windows lighted and peo
ple were standing in the window looking,"
O'Rourke said.
"You could see the ambulance the
sirens were going on outside," Wylie said.
"People were going to be like 'What's going
on?'"
Suites RA Elijah Frazier 'l2, who said
that many students witnessed the presence
of EMTs, also said that very little informa
tion could be released because very little in
formation was available at the time.
O'Rourke, who acknowledged that

Valentina del Olmo, the Residence Dean
responsible for Suites, needed to be at the
hospital with Wopat, said that having an
adult present on campus that night would
have been helpful. All four Suites RAs
agreed that having an adult presence in the
dorm following Wopat's hospitalization
would have been helpful.
O'Rourke said alerting nearby resident
fellows (RF) in the Sterling Quad or EAST,
Murray or Yost houses could have solved
the lack of adult presence, since Suites does
not have an RF. She added she did not feel
supported by the University in the days fol
lowing Wopat's suicide attempt, and that
she did not know how to respond to stu
dents as an RA and as a fellow student
following Wopat's hospitalization. In her
opinion, the University failed to give ade
quate directives to the Suites RAs.
"We really didn't know what to do," she
said. "It felt very futile."
O'Rourke said she was told a few days
after Wopat's hospitalization not to convey
further information to students who did not
know what had happened, but to ensure
general resident well-being.
"As an RA you feel hesitant to do the
personal thing because you're part of the
voice of the University almost," O'Rourke
