Approximately 200 Stanford
and University of California-
Berkeley students gathered on
Sat., Nov. 19 at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center to march in oppo
sition to police action against Oc
cupy Cal student protesters.
Occupy Cal students protest
ing in support of the national Oc
cupy Wall Street movement and
against tuition hikes clashed with
Berkeley o campus police on
Nov. 9 when they refused to re
move their encampment in
Berkeley's Sproul Plaza.
Police used batons against pro
testers, who linked arms and
formed a wall around the tents.
The day's events resulted in 39 ar
rests, with an additional arrest the
next morning, and injuries to pro
testers' arms, heads and stomachs.
Stanford organizers publicized
Saturday's march, which took
place a few hours before this
year's Big Game, with the mes
sage "civil liberties have no rival
ries."
"This is a rally that will speak
to the character of students at
both schools," read a publicity
email circulated by Stanford stu
dents before the march. "It will
send a message that even the
strongest rivals have the capacity
to come together."
Protesters marched the streets
surrounding the alumni center
with signs, including one that read,
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere," referencing
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s letter
from Birmingham Jail. Group
chants included, "It's our reality.
Stop police brutality!"
The march ended at Cobb
Track and Angell Field, where the
crowd heard a few prepared
speeches before an open-mic ses
sion.
"I see a bunch of smart, young
people who want to fight for a bet
ter world," said Zachary Aslan
ian- Williams, a Berkeley transfer
student, in his speech.
Robert Slaughter, a senior at
St. Mary's College, described the
events of the Nov. 9 protest. He re
called witnessing police using a
baton against a woman to "stab
her in the stomach five, six times."
"The police department is
doing this to defenseless young
people who are the future,"
Slaughter said.
"At this I'm wondering, what
the hell is going to happen to
me?" he said. Slaughter was
arrested Nov. 9 and has been
charged with three misde
meanors. He said he was held the
longest of those who were arrest
ed and described the nights he
spent in the Oakland County Jail
and Santa Rita Jail, where he was
subjected to a strip search. He is
awaiting a Dec. 12 arraignment.
Shawn Dye 'l4, ASSU senator
and political action co-chair of the
Stanford NAACP, said in an inter
view with The Daily that he, "was
wondering if people would attack
me like that."

This, along with a personal in
terest in the Occupy movement,
prompted him to take a lead role
in organizing Saturday's march.
"The police brutality I felt was
uncalled for," Dye said. "Looking

at the video evidence alone, we
didn't see any of the students pro
voking the police. As students, we
have so much power that police
see that as a threat."
"The goal here is change and
seeking justice," said Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, vice president of
the Stanford NAACP.
The Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS) saw the march as an op
portunity for outreach. SUDPS
Chief Laura Wilson was present
and stood on the side, listening to
the student speeches.
"I appreciate the way in which
all of the participants have han
dled themselves today," Wilson
said, calling the protest "peaceful
and productive."
"Some of the videos I have
seen certainly were disturbing,"
she said of the events in Sproul
Plaza, though she added that she
was not there in person.
"It looks like us versus them,"
Wilson said of what she sees as an
unfortunate situation in which
people "feel the police are not
part of their community."
"My message would be that we
do need to come together," she
said, noting opportunities such as
police ride-alongs for Stanford
community members to become
more connected to SUDPS.
Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson also
commented positively on the
march, which she helped students
including Dye organize.
"I'm very proud of our stu
dents," Dickson said. "What hap
pened at Cal from what I saw from
the videos was tragic."
Some protesters were clear to
draw a line between the Occupy
movement as a whole and Satur
day's march against police brutal
ity.
"It's not a matter of the Occu
py situation but more about car
ing when people get hurt and mo
tivating Stanford students to
stand up for what is right," said
Rafael Vazquez 'l2, chair of the
ASSU Senate. "I'm really happy
to see so many people who do
care."
Student groups that helped or
ganize Saturday's march included
the ASSU Executive and ASSU
senators, MEChA de Stanford,
the Stanford Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Stanford
Asian American Activism Com
mittee, the Stanford Black Stu
dent Union, the Stanford Muslim
Student Awareness Network, the
Stanford National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP), the Stanford
Pilipino American Students Asso
ciation, the Stanford Vietnamese
Student Association and the Stan
ford Students of Color Coalition.
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, political
action co-chair of Stanford
NAACP and former ASSU vice
president, described the march as
an effort in "raising our collective
consciousness."
"When people hear Occupy on
this campus now, they're not feel
ing it," he said of Stanford's per
ception. He described the issue as
one of "trying to connect the dots
together."
"You have to meet people
where they are and be inclusive,"
Wharton said of attracting stu
dents with a wide set of beliefs to
the march. "You can't have Stan
ford students tuned out."
"The way in which Occupy Cal
has specific aims adds credence to
the movement," said ASSU Sen
ate Deputy Chair Dan Ashton
'l4, who also participated in the
protest. "Hopefully, moving for
ward, the conversation at Stan
ford can be rooted in actionable
change."
Maria Rohani, a senior at
Berkeley, commented on the
issue at the heart of Occupy Cal
concern that tuition may in
crease up to 81 percent over the
next four years.
"Occupy is about working
against the system that takes ad
vantage of those under it," Ro
hani said, who was present at the
Nov. 9 protest. "The UC system
has been taking advantage of stu
dents for years now."
Rohani compared the con
cerns of protesters at Stanford
and Berkeley.
"You cannot have an Occupy
movement at Cal without [tuition

increases] being a focus," she said.
"When you go somewhere like
Stanford, it may not be as tangi
ble, but it's still part of your

world."

St. Mary's College, described the
events of the Nov. 9 protest. He re
called witnessing police using a
baton against a woman to "stab
her in the stomach five, six times."
"The police department is
doing this to defenseless young
people who are the future,"
Slaughter said.
"At this I'm wondering, what
the hell is going to happen to
me?" he said. Slaughter was
arrested Nov. 9 and has been
charged with three misde
meanors. He said he was held the
longest of those who were arrest
ed and described the nights he
spent in the Oakland County Jail
and Santa Rita Jail, where he was
subjected to a strip search. He is
awaiting a Dec. 12 arraignment.
Shawn Dye 'l4, ASSU senator
and political action co-chair of the
Stanford NAACP, said in an inter
view with The Daily that he, "was
wondering if people would attack
me like that."

This, along with a personal in
terest in the Occupy movement,
prompted him to take a lead role
in organizing Saturday's march.
"The police brutality I felt was
uncalled for," Dye said. "Looking

at the video evidence alone, we
didn't see any of the students pro
voking the police. As students, we
have so much power that police
see that as a threat."
"The goal here is change and
seeking justice," said Milton
Achelpohl 'l3, vice president of
the Stanford NAACP.
The Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS) saw the march as an op
portunity for outreach. SUDPS
Chief Laura Wilson was present
and stood on the side, listening to
the student speeches.
"I appreciate the way in which
all of the participants have han
dled themselves today," Wilson
said, calling the protest "peaceful
and productive."
"Some of the videos I have
seen certainly were disturbing,"
she said of the events in Sproul
Plaza, though she added that she
was not there in person.
"It looks like us versus them,"
Wilson said of what she sees as an
unfortunate situation in which
people "feel the police are not
part of their community."
"My message would be that we
do need to come together," she
said, noting opportunities such as
police ride-alongs for Stanford
community members to become
more connected to SUDPS.
Associate Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Sally Dickson also
commented positively on the
march, which she helped students
including Dye organize.
"I'm very proud of our stu
dents," Dickson said. "What hap
pened at Cal from what I saw from
the videos was tragic."
Some protesters were clear to
draw a line between the Occupy
movement as a whole and Satur
day's march against police brutal
ity.
"It's not a matter of the Occu
py situation but more about car
ing when people get hurt and mo
tivating Stanford students to
stand up for what is right," said
Rafael Vazquez 'l2, chair of the
ASSU Senate. "I'm really happy
to see so many people who do
care."
Student groups that helped or
ganize Saturday's march included
the ASSU Executive and ASSU
senators, MEChA de Stanford,
the Stanford Asian American Stu
dents Association, the Stanford
Asian American Activism Com
mittee, the Stanford Black Stu
dent Union, the Stanford Muslim
Student Awareness Network, the
Stanford National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP), the Stanford
Pilipino American Students Asso
ciation, the Stanford Vietnamese
Student Association and the Stan
ford Students of Color Coalition.
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, political
action co-chair of Stanford
NAACP and former ASSU vice
president, described the march as
an effort in "raising our collective
consciousness."
"When people hear Occupy on
this campus now, they're not feel
ing it," he said of Stanford's per
ception. He described the issue as
one of "trying to connect the dots
together."
"You have to meet people
where they are and be inclusive,"
Wharton said of attracting stu
dents with a wide set of beliefs to
the march. "You can't have Stan
ford students tuned out."
"The way in which Occupy Cal
has specific aims adds credence to
the movement," said ASSU Sen
ate Deputy Chair Dan Ashton
'l4, who also participated in the
protest. "Hopefully, moving for
ward, the conversation at Stan
ford can be rooted in actionable
change."
Maria Rohani, a senior at
Berkeley, commented on the
issue at the heart of Occupy Cal
concern that tuition may in
crease up to 81 percent over the
next four years.
"Occupy is about working
against the system that takes ad
vantage of those under it," Ro
hani said, who was present at the
Nov. 9 protest. "The UC system
has been taking advantage of stu
dents for years now."
Rohani compared the con
cerns of protesters at Stanford
and Berkeley.
"You cannot have an Occupy
movement at Cal without [tuition

increases] being a focus," she said.
"When you go somewhere like
Stanford, it may not be as tangi
ble, but it's still part of your

world."

Stanford and Cal students marched together before the Big Game to
protest police brutality against Occupy Cal protesters. The group ultimately
gathered on Angell Field, where activists delivered speeches.
Originally published Nov. 28,
2011.

Approximately 200 Stanford
and University of California-
Berkeley students gathered on
Sat., Nov. 19 at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center to march in oppo
sition to police action against Oc
cupy Cal student protesters.
Occupy Cal students protest
ing in support of the national Oc
cupy Wall Street movement and
against tuition hikes clashed with
Berkeley o campus police on
Nov. 9 when they refused to re
move their encampment in
Berkeley's Sproul Plaza.
Police used batons against pro
testers, who linked arms and
formed a wall around the tents.
The day's events resulted in 39 ar
rests, with an additional arrest the
next morning, and injuries to pro
testers' arms, heads and stomachs.
Stanford organizers publicized
Saturday's march, which took
place a few hours before this
year's Big Game, with the mes
sage "civil liberties have no rival
ries."
"This is a rally that will speak
to the character of students at
both schools," read a publicity
email circulated by Stanford stu
dents before the march. "It will
send a message that even the
strongest rivals have the capacity
to come together."
Protesters marched the streets
surrounding the alumni center
with signs, including one that read,
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere," referencing
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s letter
from Birmingham Jail. Group
chants included, "It's our reality.
Stop police brutality!"
The march ended at Cobb
Track and Angell Field, where the
crowd heard a few prepared
speeches before an open-mic ses
sion.
"I see a bunch of smart, young
people who want to fight for a bet
ter world," said Zachary Aslan
ian- Williams, a Berkeley transfer
student, in his speech.
