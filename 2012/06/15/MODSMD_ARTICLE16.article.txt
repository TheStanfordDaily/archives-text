## Stanford moves to end Chi Theta Chi lease

Stanford moved Wednesday to
revoke the lease of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX), one of two non-University
operated houses on campus, citing
lease violations, liability concerns
and "pressing life safety issues."
"Stanford hereby elects to ter
minate the lease pursuant to the
termination right set forth in...the
Lease," read a letter delivered to
the Alpha Epsilon Alumni Associ
ation of Theta Chi Fraternity, Inc.
The University will take control
of the house on April 2, due to "the
Lessee's failure to adequately re
spond to multiple and chronic
breaches of the Lease," read the let
ter, signed by Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs Greg Boardman and
Senior Associate Vice Provost of
Residential and Dining Enterpris
es Shirley Everett.
Chi Theta Chi, a house known
for its independent spirit, began
functioning as a co-operative in 1973
but did not officially split from Theta
Chi Fraternity until the late 'Bos.
XOX is one of two houses, the
other being Sigma Chi, that are not
operated directly by Stanford Uni
versity, but rather have lease-hold
agreements. The University owns
the land on which XOX sits, but
rents the plot on a long-term con
tract with a land-use fee. In the past,
this agreement has allowed stu
dents more autonomy regarding
administrative decisions. A May
1990 report on "Co-operative Liv
ing at Stanford" describes the
house as "a haven for groups seek
ing to avoid University red tape."
"We are confused and saddened by
the University's attempt to remove
ownership of the property from the
house's alumni board, which has
controlled the property for
decades," said a press release from
Chi Theta Chi. "This transfer of
ownership would directly under
mine the diversity of the living op
tions available to to undergradu
ates - counter to the University's
stated goal."
Boardman, Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder, Exec
utive Director of Student Housing
Rodger Whitney and other admin
istrators attended a regularly
scheduled meeting between XOX
representatives and Stanford
Housing Wednesday.

Former XOX Resident Assistant
(RA) Bear Douglas 'O9 M.A. 'lO
and former Resident Computer
Consultant Abel Allison 'OB, both
members of the XOX alumni
board, described the meeting as an
"ambush" in an email to a XOX
alumni email list.
The administrators informed
XOX that after deliberation, the
University decided not to renew
the house's lease for this coming
fall and to take control of the house
on the first day of spring quarter.
Students will begin paying rent to
the University at the start of spring
quarter this year. The house, which
normally remains open, will be
closed this coming summer to allow
for University renovations.
According to XOX student
staff, the University provided sev
eral reasons for its decision. Uni
versity officials cited that XOX has
been using the tax identification
number of Theta Chi Fraternity, de
spite the receipt of a cease-and-de
sist letter from the organization.
Both Allison and Douglas denied
any knowledge of this violation or
such a letter.
According to the email by Alli
son and Douglas, administrators
expressed concerns that XOX has
failed multiple fire safety inspec
tions, is both financially and admin
istratively incapable of avoiding
default and has failed to maintain
corporate status in California.
Administrators also cited con
cerns that the University is ulti
mately responsible in the event of
any lawsuits against the house, ac
cording to the email. A portion of
students living in XOX are as
signed to the house through the
University draw, a factor that cre
ates additional concerns for admin
istrators worried about the experi
ence of students who did not active
ly choose to live in the house.
The University is "committed to
working with the [XOX] alumni
board and the residents of the
house to continue a co-op in the
Chi Theta Chi house," Whitney
said, emphasizing that the Univer
sity is concerned foremost with en
suring the well-being of students
and "the long and short-term stew
ardship of the house."
