Proclaiming that "we will not
forget and we will not go quietly,"
approximately 70 Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) residents and members of
the Stanford community marched
on the Office of the Vice Provost
of Student Affairs (VPSA) on
Monday morning in protest of the
University's decision to terminate
the house's lease.
Led by drums and bearing
placards with slogans such as
"Home is where the lease is," pro
testers walked from XOX to the
Tresidder Union office of Student
Affairs, where they called on Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman to engage in a direct
dialogue with residents about the
house's future.
"We are distraught by the fail
ure of [University administrators]
to acknowledge our repeated at

tempts to demonstrate the value
of our student-owned and man
aged community," said Kelsey
Grousbeck 'l2, a XOX kitchen
manager, reading from a state
ment signed by all XOX residents
and eating associates.
XOX residents have expressed
concern in recent weeks at the
lack of input they've been granted
in ongoing negotiations between
the University and the XOX
Alumni Board, a sentiment
echoed in the statement. Stanford
officials voted to let XOX's lease
lapse for at least two years, during
which time Stanford and XOX
will jointly manage the house.
"Since the announcement on
February 8 to revoke Chi Theta
Chi's lease, the administration has
failed to treat Chi Theta Chi's res
idents as valued undergraduate
students," Grousbeck said. "The
administration has demonstrated
a lack of consideration for the
character, creativity and family of
Chi Theta Chi."

"I think that it's important for
students to have an outlet," said
Abel Allison 'OB, president of the
Alumni Board, in advance of the
march. "Until recently, we hadn't
really been able to communicate
the details of what's being dis
cussed. I trust that they'll be re
spectful."
Grousbeck argued that the in
troduction of joint oversight
between the University and the
Alumni Board of the house for
an interim period lasting "a mini
mum of two years" would jeop
ardize the house 's culture of inde
pendent living and the institution
al memory of that experience
among students.
"Without the knowledge of the
level of responsibility required to
run the house and maintain our
community values, the lease
would fall into ineffective hands,"
Grousbeck said.
