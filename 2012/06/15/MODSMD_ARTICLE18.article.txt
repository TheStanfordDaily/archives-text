## Faculty Senate says farewell to IHUM FacSen reviews report by Committee on Undergraduate Standards and Policies

Originally published March 9,2012.
Concluding a multi-year review of the methods
and goals of a Stanford education, the Faculty Senate
voted Thursday in favor of replacing the current In
troduction to Humanities (IHUM) program. Fresh
men will instead be required to take a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course starting this upcoming ac
ademic year.
The Senate will reconsider a recommendation to
require freshmen seminars after the 2015-16 academ
ic year.
Earlier in the meeting, the Senate also voted on
two revisions to the University's policies governing
faculty conflicts of interest and outside consulting,
which were prompted by new federal regulations.
These measures, which had been discussed at the Sen
ate's Feb. 23 meeting, were unanimously approved
without floor discussion.
C-USP recommendations
The Senate reviewed a report by the Committee
on Undergraduate Standards and Polices (C-USP)
for a second time. C-USP issued the report in re
sponse to proposed changes to the freshman academ
ic experience made in the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) report.
Judy Goldstein, C-USP chair, opened the discus
sion by highlighting the most significant aspects of
Thinking Matters, noting that while the School of

Humanities & Sciences was in charge of the IHUM
program responsibility for Thinking Matters will
be spread across the University. Goldstein added that
freshmen will be able to choose Thinking Matters
courses in away similar to normal lecture classes,
rather than being bound to a particular class or quar
ter.
Goldstein also emphasized the reduced time com
mitments suggested by the C-USP report, which rec
ommended requiring freshman to enroll in two
courses one Thinking Matters course and one
freshman seminar instead of the current three
quarter IHUM sequence. Freshmen would still take a
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) class as a re
quirement.
Senate Chair Rosemary Knight, professor of geo
physics, reminded the Senate of concerns about the
freshman seminar requirement expressed in the Sen
ate's previous meeting.
Senators had expressed skepticism that the Uni
versity would be able to preserve the character of
seminars if they were made mandatory citing is
sues with scheduling, inadequate seminar numbers
and student and faculty enthusiasm.
Amending requirements
Acknowledging Knight's concerns, Russell
Berman, director of the IHUM and Introductory
Seminar programs, put an amended version of C
USP's recommendations before the Senate for its
consideration.
While the amendment preserved the role of
Thinking Matters as a requirement, it removed the
freshman seminar requirement. Instead, Berman

Following the SUES report, the Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the Introduction to Humanities program from
the freshman curriculum, replacing IHUM with a "Thinking Matters" course.
