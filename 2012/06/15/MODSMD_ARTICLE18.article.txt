## Faculty Senate says farewell to IHUM FacSen reviews report by Committee on Undergraduate Standards and Policies 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
Originally published March 9,2012.
Concluding a multi-year review of the methods
and goals of a Stanford education, the Faculty Senate
voted Thursday in favor of replacing the current In
troduction to Humanities (IHUM) program. Fresh
men will instead be required to take a one-quarter
"Thinking Matters" course starting this upcoming ac
ademic year.
The Senate will reconsider a recommendation to
require freshmen seminars after the 2015-16 academ
ic year.
Earlier in the meeting, the Senate also voted on
two revisions to the University's policies governing
faculty conflicts of interest and outside consulting,
which were prompted by new federal regulations.
These measures, which had been discussed at the Sen
ate's Feb. 23 meeting, were unanimously approved
without floor discussion.
C-USP recommendations
The Senate reviewed a report by the Committee
on Undergraduate Standards and Polices (C-USP)
for a second time. C-USP issued the report in re
sponse to proposed changes to the freshman academ
ic experience made in the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES) report.
Judy Goldstein, C-USP chair, opened the discus
sion by highlighting the most significant aspects of
Thinking Matters, noting that while the School of

Humanities & Sciences was in charge of the IHUM
program responsibility for Thinking Matters will
be spread across the University. Goldstein added that
freshmen will be able to choose Thinking Matters
courses in away similar to normal lecture classes,
rather than being bound to a particular class or quar
ter.
Goldstein also emphasized the reduced time com
mitments suggested by the C-USP report, which rec
ommended requiring freshman to enroll in two
courses one Thinking Matters course and one
freshman seminar instead of the current three
quarter IHUM sequence. Freshmen would still take a
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) class as a re
quirement.
Senate Chair Rosemary Knight, professor of geo
physics, reminded the Senate of concerns about the
freshman seminar requirement expressed in the Sen
ate's previous meeting.
Senators had expressed skepticism that the Uni
versity would be able to preserve the character of
seminars if they were made mandatory citing is
sues with scheduling, inadequate seminar numbers
and student and faculty enthusiasm.
Amending requirements
Acknowledging Knight's concerns, Russell
Berman, director of the IHUM and Introductory
Seminar programs, put an amended version of C
USP's recommendations before the Senate for its
consideration.
While the amendment preserved the role of
Thinking Matters as a requirement, it removed the
freshman seminar requirement. Instead, Berman

Following the SUES report, the Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the Introduction to Humanities program from
the freshman curriculum, replacing IHUM with a "Thinking Matters" course.
proposed that the Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education work
to expand seminar availability
and encourage student participa
tion in seminars. The Senate
would reconsider the require
ment of freshmen seminars after
the 2015-16 academic year.
"I'm making these amend
ments in the spirit of endorsing the
SUES report," Berman said.
Maintaining that increased semi
nar participation remains a princi
pal objective, Berman emphasized
that he wants to make sure that
available seminars offer sufficient
breadth and depth before any such
requirement is implemented.
"We're asking for several years
in which we can pursue this strate
gy aggressively," Berman said. "It
could be the case that there are
good reasons for students not to
do it... Let's leave open the pos
sibility that some students are
making wise choices."
Faculty discussion of the
amendment focused on the ade
quacy of requiring only one
course alongside PWR, citing
IHUM as providing a common
experience for all Stanford fresh
man that might not be adequately
replaced.

Dissenting opinions
Carolyn Lougee Chappell,
professor of history, argued that a
freshman requirement should aim
to bridge the gap for students be
tween high school and university
education.
"IHUM, in the course of a
year, builds the skills that students
will need for their whole universi
ty education," Lougee Chappell
said. "I'm skeptical that one quar
ter is sufficient."
Berman acknowledged that
any freshman requirement should
ease the transition to university
classes, but said that he'd encoun
tered a majority of faculty that felt
three quarters was excessive. He
also expressed doubt that an ex
tended freshman requirement
would resonate academically with
students.
"I don't think the way to solve
the learning issues is by com
pelling students into courses they
wouldn't take otherwise,"

Berman said.
Noting the continued growth
in the number of units demanded
by majors, Chris Edwards, profes
sor of mechanical engineering,
emphasized the significance of en
suring that reduced requirements
translates into greater freedom
for freshmen to explore, rather
than allowing departments to stip
ulate course requirements earlier
in students' academics careers.
Jeremy Weinstein, professor of
political science, also spoke out
against the amendment. Contrast
ing the amendment's "wait-and
see" attitude toward seminars
with the original recommenda
tion's mandate for requiring it, he
expressed doubt that faculty
would engage with the initiative at
the level required.
"The amendment is set up to
fail, as departments don't have a
strong incentive to offer more
courses," Weinstein said.
"Just at the start"
Vice Provost of Undergradu
ate Education Harry Elam noted
that his office, department chairs
and the Office of the Provost will
commence a discussion next week
concerning compensation for fac
ulty participation in seminars.
Elam said that thirty more semi
nars would be required to accom
modate the entirety of the fresh
man class.
"I actually think we can [ac
commodate the added semi
nars]," said Provost and Acting
President John Etchemendy
Ph.D. 'B2. "I don't think it's a for
gone conclusion that it'll be hard
to do."
Expressing concern that re
quiring freshman seminars might
result in Thinking Matters becom
ing a "dumping ground" for stu
dents unable to find a seminar of
interest, James Campbell, co-chair
of the SUES committee, endorsed
the amendment.
"We're just at the start of a re
ally long conversation," Campbell
said. "I hope people will remem
ber that as we implement a whole
series of innovations."
The Senate voted by a margin
of 27 to eight votes to accept
Berman's amendments, and by 27
to six votes with two absten
tions in favor of the amended
motion.
