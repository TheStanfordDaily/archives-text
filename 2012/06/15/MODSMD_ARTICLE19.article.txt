Kappa Sigma fraternity will be
reinstated to its former house at
1035 Campus Drive for the 2012-
13 academic year, announced
Deborah Golder, Dean of Resi
dential Education (ResEd), Fri
day afternoon.
The decision comes nine
months after ResEd removed
Kappa Sigma from the house, fol
lowing two years of behavior that
Golder called "dangerous," in an
interview with The Daily last
March.
"They have more work to do
and they're not done yet, but we
were very impressed with the
amount of work they've done and
want to show good faith in their
projected trajectory," Golder said.
"We were really looking for a pro
found shift in attitude and cul
ture."
"The guys have put in a lot of
work over the past couple of
months," said incoming Kappa
Sigma President Malcolm Mc-
Gregor 'l3. "We've been taking a
critical look at ourselves and cre
ating an organization that reflects
what we want as members of the
fraternity and what the campus
wants from us."
"It's a decision we've worked
hard for," said Brian Barnes 'l2,
outgoing Kappa Sigma president.
"We're happy to be back."
ResEd actions
ResEd gave Kappa Sigma a
yearlong hiatus from its house in
March 2011, after the fraternity vi
olated its alcohol and party proba
tion and students complained
about feeling unsafe in the house.
ResEd also gave Kappa Sigma
a list of seven criteria for improve
ment last March. The criteria
were: "1) vision and organization
al identity; 2) shared accountabili
ty and responsibility; 3) steward
ship and financial responsibility;
4) role of alcohol in the house and
organization; 5) partnerships; 6)
community membership and re
sponsible citizenship; and 7)
learning and engagement," ac
cording to a ResEd document.
Res Ed's actions against the or
ganization came just months after
the group came under review
from the national Kappa Sigma
Supreme Executive Committee
(SEC).
Along with an advisory panel
of faculty, administrators and stu
dents, ResEd judged Kappa
Sigma based on a rubric of these
criteria, in addition to a two-hour
"formal relevancy presentation"
that 10 members of the fraternity
gave Thursday night.
The review panel consisted of:
ResEd staff; Robinson Flouse
Resident Fellow Rod Taylor; An
gela Exson, assistant dean of the
Office of Sexual Assault and Re
lationship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion and Response; and student
representatives from the Greek
community. Golder, ResEd Asso
ciate Dean Nate Boswell and
ResEd Greek Advisor Amanda
Rodriguez also contributed to the
process.
Fraternity progress
Since losing its house in March,
Kappa Sigma has reorganized its
internal structure and partnered
with University offices and cam
pus groups on community-based
projects.
"Some of the weaknesses we
identified with the former struc
ture of Kappa Sigma was the lack
of internal accountability and that
our lack of a concrete vision
stemmed from a lack of organiza
tional structure," McGregor said.
According to McGregor,

Kappa Sigma has replaced a pre
vious structure that included
loosely-defined executives and
non-executive roles with little
oversight.
The fraternity now has four ex
ecutive positions in addition to
the president, he said. Together,
these five roles will provide over
sight for non-executive positions.
"In this new structure, each of
[ResEd's] seven criteria to ad
dress corresponded with the job
description of one of those execu
tive members," McGregor said.
"The criteria are things we'll be
incorporating into our daily oper
ations for years to come."
'Divide and conquer'
The fraternity took a 'divide
and conquer approach,' to ad
dress issues of accountability and
improvement, according to
Barnes.
Barnes split the fraternity's 60
members into 11 groups, each fo
cused on a different facet of fra
ternal life. Topics included com
munity outreach, the pledge
process, the treatment of women
and the role of alcohol in the
house. He tasked each group with
completing a proposal for what
the best practices in each of those
fields would look like, and the fra
ternity presented these projects to
the review panel Thursday.
Additionally, Kappa Sigma will
host a themed-service project
each quarter, McGregor said.
"Every winter we have decided
to focus on 'Student Awareness
Events,"' wrote Kappa Sigma
community service chair Danny
Organ 'l3 in an email to The
Daily.
Last winter, the fraternity host
ed the Kappa Sigma Save the
Music Benefit Concert, as well as
a Safe and Open Spaces at Stan
ford (SOSAS) panel. The events
raised money for music education
in public schools and awareness
for issues facing LGBT students
and their allies, respectively.
"This quarter, we are partner
ing with SARA to co-sponsor an
event hosting Kevin Powell to
speak about issues of masculinity
and relationship abuse aware
ness," Organ said.
According to McGregor,
Kappa Sigma may also co-host a
SOSAS event for the entire
Greek community.
The fraternity plans to host one
lecture by an alumnus every fall as
part of 'The Stanford Family'
theme and to do service off the
Farm every spring in an effort to
go 'Beyond the Stanford Campus.'
As a result of the program
ming, U.S. Ambassador to Japan
John Roos '77 J.D. 'BO came to
campus in the fall to discuss the
implications of the March 2011
tsunami.
Kappa Sigma is also looking to
host a more Stanford-specific ver
sion of the 'Say Something' pro
gram that works to discourage by
stander apathy in situations of
high-risk drinking.
The Office of Alcohol Policy &
Education (OAPE) first hosted a
'Say Something' event in Septem
ber that was largely attended by
Kappa Sigma members, according
to Barnes.
Barnes said he views these re
lationships as beneficial to Kappa
Sigma, partnering organizations
and the University at-large,
"We'd like to use OAPE and
SARA to build a partnership be
cause they are much more special
ized than we are," Barnes said.
"We'd like to bring up our level of
understanding and to give them
the manpower to put on bigger
events."
