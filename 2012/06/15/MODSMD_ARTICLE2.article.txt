Fadi Quran 'lO a Palestin
ian-American Stanford alumnus
who was arrested by Israeli sol
diers in the West Bank on Friday,
will be brought to trial Monday
morning in Jerusalem, his sister,
Semma Qura'an, told The Daily.
As reported by Stanford alum
nus PolicyMic reporter Jake
Horowitz, Quran is being held in
A1 Maskubiyeh Prison in
Jerusalem, not Ofer Prison in the
West Bank, as previously report
ed by several sources, including
The Daily. Hurriyah Ziada, a stu
dent at Birzeit Unviersity in
Palestine, who was with Quran
moments before his arrest, con
firmed this information.
Quran's release and trial are
not guaranteed, according to his
sister.
"We do not know if he will be
released today. We only hope for
it," Semma Qura'an wrote in a

Facebook message to The Daily
from the West Bank. "No one is al
lowed contact with him other than
his lawyer even he has limited
access."
Quran, a Palestinian Ameri
can from Hebron, West Bank,
graduated from Stanford with a
double major in international re
lations and physics and returned
home to work in the alternative
energy field while advocating
nonviolent resistance to the Is
raeli occupation of the West
Bank. Quran served as president
of Stanford Students for Palestin
ian Equal Rights (SPER) during
the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 aca
demic years.
He was arrested Friday in He
bron, West Bank, for allegedly
pushing an Israeli soldier during a
protest against the 18-year Israeli
enforced closure of Hebron's
main street to Palestinian citizens.
Stanford students and gradu
ates quickly organized around

supporting Quran.
Imran Akbar 'O7, a SPER co
founder, wrote to the group late
Saturday morning that he alerted
the American consulate of Quran's
detainment.
"I've spoken to the American
consulate in Jerusalem," Akbar
wrote. "I gave them Fadi's informa
tion, told them what happened and
asked for a consular officer to visit
him in prison and ensure that he's
safe and has access to his lawyer.
The duty officer said he'd pass the
information along to the consular
tomorrow and get back to me."
Akbar said in an email to The
Daily that the consulate cannot give
him more information about the
case because he is not a family mem
ber. The American consulate was
closed and unavailable for comment
at the time of publication.
Assaf Sharon Ph.D 'O9, an or
ganizer of the Sheikh Jarrah Soli
darity Movement a "grassroots
organization working towards civil
equality within Israel and an end to
the Israeli occupation of Palestine,"
according to the group's site en
couraged the group in an email to
mobilize the Stanford community
to spread the story of Fadi's arrest
and of the larger conflict in Pales
tine.
The Israeli Defense Force and Is
rael Ministry of Foreign Affairs did
not answer requests for comment.
Video footage
Journalists and activists partici
pating in Friday's demonstrations
uploaded photos, videos and tweets
of Quran's arrest to Facebook,
You Tube and Twitter.
There are currently two videos
online one posted on Friday that
shows the protesters' interactions
with Israeli forces before and after
Quran's arrest and a second, re
leased on Sunday, that concentrates
solely on Quran's encounter from a
new camera angle.
The first video demonstrates a
visibly and audibly upset Quran
gesticulating and speaking to Israeli
soldiers before being grabbed by
multiple soldiers and pushed to
ward a police van. The clip then
shows an officer pepper spraying
Quran's face, followed by Quran's
head and abdomen hitting the rear
bumper of the van as soldiers at
tempt to arrest him.
Quran is then briefly shown
lying in the street behind the van as
journalists and soldiers stand
around him. The videographer of
the original video then retreats
from the scene with his camera, as
his footage shows soldiers shooing
the press away.
The last footage of Quran shows
him still lying in the street.
The second video was shot from
behind Quran, showing him yelling
and motioning at officers, being
grabbed and pepper sprayed.
Members of the press block
footage of Quran's body hitting the
vehicle, and the video culminates
with Quran lying in the street, sur
rounded by soldiers and journalists.
Stanford support
In addition to posting and shar
ing links to the photos, tweets and
videos, members of the Stanford
community initiated a petition to
the Israeli government demanding
Quran's release.
Stanford graduate Lila Kalaf 'lO
created the petition Saturday after
noon.
"Fadi should not be detained for
an indefinite period of time on false
charges," the petition reads. "It is
imperative that the Israeli govern
ment release Fadi so that he may
continue to speak for his people and
PEACEFULLY push for basic
human rights."
Members of SPER, the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) and other community
members forwarded the petition to
campus mailing lists and to specific
members of the faculty and admin
istration.
"We emailed [professors] who had
previously signed SPER's petition, as
well as those in the physics depart
ment," wrote Mohammed Ali 'lO
M.A. 'lO in an email to The Daily. "I
also emailed Provost Etchemendy
and Professor [Allen] Weiner, whose
class Fadi took as an undergrad. Oth
ers emailed other professors that he
may have known."
Ali was an ASSU Undergraduate
Senator during the 2009 to 2010
school year and also served as pres
ident of MSAN. He worked with
Quran on Campaign Restore
Hope.
Among the signatories on
Kalaf's petition are Clayborne
Carson, director of the Martin
Luther King, Jr., Research and Ed
ucation Institute: Weiner, co-direc
tor of the Stanford Center on In
ternational Conflict and Negotia
tion; Joel Beinin, professor of his
tory; Khalil Barhoum, lecturer in
Arabic; Eva Silverstein, professor
of physics; Rega Wood, professor
emerita of philosophy; Shamit
Kachru, professor of physics; and
Franco Moretti, professor of com
parative literature.
Carson wrote in an email to The
Daily that Quran was one of his stu

dents during a 2008 Overseas Sem
inar trip to India, co-taught with
Linda Hess, senior lecturer in reli
gious studies.
"I had many opportunities to
talk with him about Gandhian con
cepts of nonviolent resistance and
about how Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and other African-American ac
tivists adapted these ideas for use in
the southern civil rights campaigns
of the 19605," Carson wrote. "I was
impressed by his seriousness and his
interest in talking with contempo
rary social justice activists in India
who were seeking to address the ex
plosive issue of Hindi-Muslim rela
tions in India."
Carson wrote that he then trav
eled to Quran's hometown in Ra
mallah, West Bank, in March 2010,
met Quran's family and witnessed
Quran participate in a hunger strike
and demonstration.
Moretti, who said in an email to
The Daily that he had never inter
acted with Quran personally, wrote,
"I have never met Fadi; but I have
watched a video, and I believe what
I see with my own eyes."
At the time of publication, the
petition had over 1,400 signatories.
Akbar and Bek Baymuradov, a
graduate student in civil and envi
ronmental engineering, created
freefadi.org on Sunday, which fea
tures the names of Stanford faculty
who signed the petition, an embed
ded copy of the video documenting
Quran's arrest, links to past media
coverage about Quran, current arti
cles on his arrest and a link to the
petition.
Current ASSU Undergraduate
Senators are working on legislation
to mobilize community support for
Quran.
Senators Samar Alqatari 'l4,Alon
Elhanan'l4 and Janani Ramachan
dran 'l4 and ASSU Executive Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2 met Sunday
evening in Old Union to draft a bill in
support of Quran, [see , page ]
Quran in the Middle East
Quran was arrested Friday dur
ing a protest against the Israeli-en
forced closure of Shuhada Street,
the main thoroughfare in Hebron
that has been closed to Palestinians
since the 1994 Ibrahimi Mosque
Massacre, in which an Israeli gun
man killed 29 Palestinian Muslims
and injured 125.
According to the website of the
International Solidarity Movement
(ISM) a Palestinian-led move
ment committed to "resisting the Is
raeli apartheid in Palestine by using
nonviolent, direct-action methods
and principles" Quran was
protesting along with the "Youth
Against Settlements" movement,
though he is not a member. Six
demonstrators were arrested Fri
day, including Quran, according to
ISM.
Youth Against Settlements is a
Hebron-based movement that is "a
national Palestinian non-partisan
activist group which seeks to end Is
raeli colonization activities in Pales
tine (building and expanding settle
ments) through non-violent popu
lar struggle and civil disobedience,"
according to its website.
Upon graduating from Stan
ford, Quran became part of a loose
ly associated group of activists. He
identified the group as a collection
of "bubbles" waiting to congeal in a
March 2010 Time Magazine feature
on him.
Time Magazine called Quran
"the face of the new Middle East,"
describing his allegiance to broader
movements organized around so
cial-networking sites, rather than to
the two largest Palestinian factions,
Hamas and Fatah.
Quran has been interviewed b
Al-Jazeera, The Guardian and The
New York Times for his work.
Quran at Stanford
Quran was an active participant
in campus dialogue and action sur
rounding the Israel-Palestine con
flict during his undergraduate ca
reer.
He was an organizer for Cam
paign Restore Hope (CRH), a
coalition of students who worked
to raise awareness about per
ceived human rights violations in
Israel and Palestine and encour
age divestment from four specific
companies: Elbit Systems Ltd.,
Hadiklaim Ltd.,Tarifi Cement Ltd.
and Dar Alnashr Lilhaya'a Masria
lilijaz Alllmi.
With CRH, Quran distributed
petitions across campus to encour
age the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate to pass legislation urging the
University to divest from the four
companies.
CRH eventually dropped its
campaign for student legislation,
with Quran saying in an interview
with The Daily,"Going through the
Senate led to too much emotional
backlash, so we changed direc
tion."
Quran encouraged collabora
tive efforts and person-to-person
dialogue to address issues of injus
tice, which he expressed in an op-ed
to The Daily.
"One of the things I learned at
Stanford, an intrinsic American
value, is that we should never turn
our backs to an issue because it's
too complex, difficult or divisive,"
he wrote.
