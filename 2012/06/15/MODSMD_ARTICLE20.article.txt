On Dec.ls,the United States of
ficially ended the Iraq War,
withdrawing the last U.S.
forces over the Kuwaiti bor
der. At the peak of the U.S. en
gagement, 170,000 U.S. troops were sta
tioned in Iraq; now, only 157 soldiers and a
small number of Marines remain.
The exit, after over eight and a half years
of engagement, left 4,485 American service
members dead, according to the New York
Times.
As the future of Iraq hangs in the bal
ance, Stanford service members reflected
on the Iraq withdrawal.
Corporal Gavriel Jacobs J.D. 'l3 served
two combat tours in Iraq as a tank crew
man. On his second tour in 2007, he was
wounded by an lED ambush.
"Success in Iraq is not something you
can put a price tag on," Jacobs said. "I feel
that we have done a disservice, by pulling
out as fast as we have, to the effort that we
have all put in."
"We put so much time, energy and blood
into that country," he added. "You really
want it to be successful; you want all the
things you did to be worth something, to
have a happy ending."
At the same time, "if the Iraqis tell us
they want us to leave, there may only be so
much we can do," he said.
The departure came much later than the
Bush Administration publicly predicted.
As BBC News reported in 2003, former
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
said combat operation in Iraq "could last
six days, six weeks. I doubt six months."
"The fundamental mistake was not un
derstanding how significant a political dis
ruption removing that regime was," said
Colonel Charlie Miller, visiting fellow at
the Center for International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC), who served two
tours in Iraq and was White House director
for Iraq.
"I am not sure we had a good grasp on
how long it would take them to work
through the political system," he said.
The current Iraqi government is based

on a fragile power-sharing agreement, and
Miller hopes for a "continued balance of
power among the different sects and eth
nicities."
This setup was tested just a day after U.S.
troops left Iraq. On Dec. 19, Iraq's Higher
Judicial Council issued an arrest warrant
for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, the
highest-ranking Sunni official in Iraq, for
organizing hit squads and bombings. He

promptly accused Shia Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki of trumping up the charges
and then fled to Kurdistan, where he re
sides as of Jan. 2.
Despite political complications, some
veterans believe the Iraqi army will be able
to support a stable government.
Sergeant Chris Clark 'l2 served two
tours in Iraq ending in 2007 as a member of
the Marine Corps Reconnaissance Unit.

In 2005, the Iraqi army "couldn't con
duct the most basic military operations let
alone be able to provide security at any rea
sonable level for the entire country," Clark
said. By 2007, "they had vastly improved in
their capabilities."
Given the progress that he saw in two
years, Clark is willing to "defer to the mili
tary leadership's opinion that Iraq is capa
ble of providing their own security."
Navy Lieutenant lan Aucoin J.D. 'l4
goes further, suggesting that the U.S. mili
tary's withdrawal is necessary to speed up
the improvement in the Iraqi military's ca
pabilities.
Aucoin served as a combat engineer in
Iraq from 2008 to 2009. He was in Iraq
when he heard about the full details of the
exit plan in 2008.
"My initial reaction was that we had hit
a plateau in what we were able to do over
there in terms of establishing security, and it
was time to turn things over to the Iraqi
government," he said.
"As long as American forces are still
there and [lraqis] are relying on them for
not just military tactical aid but for logisti
cal aid ... there is not as much incentive to
develop those resources and capabilities on
[their] own," he added.
Captain Anne Hsieh J.D. 'l2, who joined
the army in 2001 and was deployed to Iraq
from 2005 to 2006, expressed concerns that
progress gained in Iraq could be "easily
erased."
"Most of us who've been out there, we
try to think in terms of what it means for the
Iraqis; and I'm really not sure what it's
going to look like without a U.S. presence,"
Hsieh said.
The fear of regression cuts deeply be
cause of the many sacrifices given to get
Iraq to this point.
"I don't think the Iraqi people have a
strong sense of confidence that in the fu
ture the government will be able to survive
different political and security challenges,"
said Marine Captain Gabriel Ledeen J.D.
'l2, who served two tours in Iraq between
2006 and 2008.
Despite his fears, Ledeen is optimistic.
"Under Saddam [Hussein] they didn't

have a chance for the future, they
knew that the future would be
just as miserable as the present,"
he said. "There was not hope that
they could have an impact on
their children's lives, and now
they have the opportunity. So I
would hope that if things start to
slide back, the Iraqi people
would stand up and not let that
happen."
The possibility for a better fu
ture for Iraqis is what many vet
erans at Stanford consider the
legacy of U.S. troops in Iraq.
"The memories of those we
have lost echoes with every vote
that is cast, every decision made
by political deliberation and
every child who grows up freer
than their parents," wrote Ser
geant William Treseder 'l2, a U.S.
Marine Corps Iraq and
Afghanistan veteran, in an email
to The Daily.
Ledeen described how on his
second deployment from 2007 to
2008, his unit worked with Iraqis
who led a project that reopened
the market center of a town
called Al-Karmah.
"All of a sudden, this was an
area that was functioning again,"
Ledeen said. "They knew how to
live, how to do their stuff they
just needed a place to do it and
the security ... [so] they could
bring in crops from the field
without being shot at or without
someone from al-Qaeda in Iraq
cutting off their hands because
they were selling cucumbers and

tomatoes."
Iraq also has resources that
may provide an economic life
line.
"Iraqis are going to have suf
ficient revenue from their oil
[fields]... as they develop those
and the infrastructure to better
extract [oil] and export [it],"
Miller said. "They are going to
have plenty of money to pour
into their public services and
people."
This independence could
come at a cost for the United
States, as Colonel Joe Felter
Ph.D. 'O5, a senior research fel
low at CISAC who served in
both Iraq and Afghanistan, ar
gued.
"Prime Minster al-Maliki has
domestic constituent interests
that are not perfectly aligned
with ours," he said. "As we leave,
you are going to see they are
going to make decisions based
on their national interests and
domestic politics."
Yet Marine Corps Captain
Sam Jacobson J.D. 'l4, called the
focus on the withdrawal itself
"misguided."
"The military troops are leav
ing, but it is not the end by any
means," he said. "It is important
for us to remember that on Jan. 1,
Iraqis will be dying . . . We espe
cially need to remember [that]
the war continues, not for us but
for somebody."
"The war goes on in other
ways, and we need to be aware of
this," he added. "That is what it
means to be engaged citizens in a
participatory democracy."

The current Iraqi government is based

on a fragile power-sharing agreement, and
Miller hopes for a "continued balance of

Iraqis; and I'm really not sure what it's
going to look like without a U.S. presence,"
Hsieh said.
The fear of regression cuts deeply be
cause of the many sacrifices given to get
Iraq to this point.
"I don't think the Iraqi people have a
strong sense of confidence that in the fu
ture the government will be able to survive
different political and security challenges,"
said Marine Captain Gabriel Ledeen J.D.
'l2, who served two tours in Iraq between
2006 and 2008.
Despite his fears, Ledeen is optimistic.
"Under Saddam [Hussein] they didn't

have a chance for the future, they
knew that the future would be
just as miserable as the present,"
he said. "There was not hope that
they could have an impact on
their children's lives, and now
they have the opportunity. So I
would hope that if things start to
slide back, the Iraqi people
would stand up and not let that
happen."
The possibility for a better fu
ture for Iraqis is what many vet
erans at Stanford consider the
legacy of U.S. troops in Iraq.
"The memories of those we
have lost echoes with every vote
that is cast, every decision made
by political deliberation and
every child who grows up freer
than their parents," wrote Ser
geant William Treseder 'l2, a U.S.
Marine Corps Iraq and
Afghanistan veteran, in an email
to The Daily.
Ledeen described how on his
second deployment from 2007 to
2008, his unit worked with Iraqis
who led a project that reopened
the market center of a town
called Al-Karmah.
"All of a sudden, this was an
area that was functioning again,"
Ledeen said. "They knew how to
live, how to do their stuff they
just needed a place to do it and
the security ... [so] they could
bring in crops from the field
without being shot at or without
someone from al-Qaeda in Iraq
cutting off their hands because
they were selling cucumbers and

tomatoes."
Iraq also has resources that
may provide an economic life
line.
"Iraqis are going to have suf
ficient revenue from their oil
[fields]... as they develop those
and the infrastructure to better
extract [oil] and export [it],"
Miller said. "They are going to
have plenty of money to pour
into their public services and
people."
This independence could
come at a cost for the United
States, as Colonel Joe Felter
Ph.D. 'O5, a senior research fel
low at CISAC who served in
both Iraq and Afghanistan, ar
gued.
"Prime Minster al-Maliki has
domestic constituent interests
that are not perfectly aligned
with ours," he said. "As we leave,
you are going to see they are
going to make decisions based
on their national interests and
domestic politics."
Yet Marine Corps Captain
Sam Jacobson J.D. 'l4, called the
focus on the withdrawal itself
"misguided."
"The military troops are leav
ing, but it is not the end by any
means," he said. "It is important
for us to remember that on Jan. 1,
Iraqis will be dying . . . We espe
cially need to remember [that]
the war continues, not for us but
for somebody."
"The war goes on in other
ways, and we need to be aware of
this," he added. "That is what it
means to be engaged citizens in a
participatory democracy."
