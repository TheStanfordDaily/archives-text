# Game Day
## Out in fuĺ force 
### PEPITO ESCARCE 
Originally published on Nov. 16,2012.

Somehow I convinced myself to
roll out two hours before the
rest of the campus. It was 3:30
a.m. on Saturday, and for the
first time in its 18 years broad
casting live from college campuses,
ESPN College Game Day was hosting
its national pre-game show at Stan
ford.
Mitch Sherman, an ESPN blogger,
feared a mediocre turnout.
"There's talk that the crowd Satur
day for ESPN's College Game Day
may actually set a record low for atten
dance, what with the early morning
start and apathetic nature toward foot
ball of the Stanford students," he wrote
in a Nov. 10 blog post.
Maybe it was because Stanford stu
dents don't necessarily live and die
with the football team's successes and
failures. Maybe it was because Stan
ford has such a small student fan base.
Or maybe it was because Game Day
starts at 6 a.m. on the West Coast.
But despite the media's doubts, I
walked over to the Oval with a few
dorm mates eager to grab a spot in the
front row, only to run into a long line of
people with the same idea.
There was still hours to go before
dawn, so the stage lights were on at full
force. As we waited for the gates to
open, I looked around at the signs stu

dents held.
Some were random.
"SMU beat Navy."
"I Hate Leßron."
A cutout of a random man's face
blown up to 10 times life-size.
Some were original:
"Tim Tebow - God + Talent = An
drew Luck."
"LaMichael James Can't Smoke
This Tree."
Before I knew what was happening,
my group started entering a section
closed off from the rest of the crowd
near the stage, Chris Fowler, Desmond
Howard and Kirk Herbstreit came and
went from the stage. Erin Andrews
stood on a stage to the side while the
live ESPN telecast was broadcast on a
JumboTron behind her.
Students were densely packed near
the stage. Cameras ran on wires over
head, filming the crowd. Stanford
males yelled out catcalls to Andrews.
Between all the signs, the students
hoisted on each other's shoulders and
the sheer enormity of the crowd, I felt
much farther from the stage than I ac
tually was.
Mitch Sherman could not have
been more wrong.
"At 5:30,1 was at the front of the pit,
and a guy from ESPN turned around
and told me, 'You guys have already
exceeded our attendance expecta
tions,'" said Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9,
dean of freshmen and undergraduate
advising. "About half of the crowd had
yet to come."

Lisa Lapin, assistant vice president
of university communications, echoed
these sentiments.
"ESPN loved being at Stanford,"
Lapin said. "They were incredibly im
pressed with the turnout and the be
havior of everybody in the crowd."
After Fowler's brief admonition to
the student crowd not to yell obsceni
ties, the Hoover Tower's appearance
on the JumboTron signaled the begin
ning of the telecast. The crowd roared.
The majority of the crowd was
made up of students, but there were
also Oregon students, fans and families
from the Bay Area.
The "truly incomparable" Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band stood in juxtaposition to its uni
formed and precise Oregon counter
part. Both bands started to play at
around 6:30 a.m., shortly after the sun
finally came up.
As it became light outside, time be
came insignificant. Lost in the huge
crowd and white noise of the raucous
students, I took it all in while hardly
processing it at any level. Maybe it was
just sleep deprivation, but it was a sur
real experience.
The two most memorable moments
involved the venerable —to college
football fans, anyway Lee Corso.
During a commercial break, he held up
a Stanford helmet, prompting a deaf
ening roar.Then he held up the Oregon


Students braved the early morning chill and created elaborate signs to support the Cardinal football team at ESPN Game-
Day. ESPN broadcaster Lee Corso donned a tree hat and predicted a Stanford win over Oregon.
