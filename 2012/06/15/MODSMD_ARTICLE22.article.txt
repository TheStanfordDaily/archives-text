## The 						transformation of the humanities at Stanford

The Faculty Senate closed the book on the Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) program by
voting on March 8 in favor of replacing the pro
gram with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course, scheduled to launch this coming fall. Al
though IHUM was a quintessential fixture of the Stanford
experience for recent students, it was only the latest edition
in Stanford's history of freshman liberal arts programs, an
undergraduate tradition that is nearly 90 years old.
Pioneering liberal arts
For the first three decades following the University's
founding in 1891, there was no freshman liberal arts core
program in place. In 1920, a yearlong course, The Problems
of Citizenship, became a requirement for all freshmen.
Partly influenced by the passage of the 19th Amend
ment, The Problems of Citizenship course endeavored to
teach students the necessary skills to become informed
citizens cognizant of their political environments. Topics
on the syllabus included Citizenship in a Democratic
World and Scientific Method and Attitude. In addition to
weekly lectures taught by faculty from various depart
ments, students also had one-on-one sessions with the in
structors.
The Problem of Citizenship program lasted until 1934,
when dwindling student interest and shaky faculty support
led to its termination.
The golden age of the Great Books
Unlike its predecessor, The History of Western Civiliza
tion program (Western Civ), launched in 1935, was taught
only by the History Department. Based on the Great Books
programs of Columbia University and the University of
Chicago, Western Civ was a single-track, three-quarter
course that used a core list of fifteen "Great Books" to trace
the development of European thought from the classical
age to modernity. The course reflected a trend in American
universities to rediscover European roots and affirm new
prominence in global politics after the chaotic confusion
and loss of identity during the decades following World War
I.
Western Civ was an immensely well-received program
and lasted well into the 19605. Although the course was an
tiquated in the sense that its reading list was composed of
works by white European males, many alumni have cited
the program as one of the best academic experiences they
had at Stanford.
"It helped me become a historian," said John Reider, '67
Ph.D. 'B3, former senior associate director of admission at
Stanford and former Structured Liberal Education (SLE)
director. "Many people of my ancient era look back on the
course with great fondness."
Challenging western thought: a humanities free-for-all
Swept up by the volatile political atmosphere that pro
pelled campus disturbances in the latter half of the 19605,
Western Civ, along with many other liberal arts pro
gram requirements at other American universities,
succumbed to the pressure of protesting students and
faculty who condemned the antiquated rigidity of a
structured liberal arts program. The dominating ra
tionale was that students could only flourish if they
were free from the constraints of specific require
ments.
"The reigning idea among Stanford students was
that everything was equal and students should deter
mine what they needed to know," Reider said. "The
world was their oyster. The faculty was very happy
with that because they could teach what they wanted
to teach."
Beginning in 1969, there was no liberal arts require
ment to bind Stanford students. Where course selec
tion outside their majors of study was concerned, stu
dents were given only a loose set of requirements and
mostly left to their own devices on how to complete
them.
A return to structure: To a different CIV
In the middle of the '7os, it became clear to Stan
ford faculty that the courses students chose outside of
their major disciplines were more than often haphaz
ard and collectively lacked unity. In an attempt to rem
edy the situation by establishing a new set of liberal
arts requirements, a new Western Culture require
ment was introduced. Western Culture was a course
that aimed to renew the University's commitment to
Western intellectual thought and tradition.
While the material in Western Culture shared many
similarities with Western Civ, what set Western Culture
apart from its predecessor was its multiple-emphases
structure, a compromise between the single-track na
ture of Western Civ and the total absence of tracks in
the '7os. Western Culture included eight different
tracks created by different departments to cater to a di
versity of student intellectual interests. While tracks
such as Literature and Arts stuck more closely to Eu
ropean intellectual tradition, other tracks such as Val
ues, Technology, Science and Society offered reading
material that emphasized the role of technology and
science, which appealed to the engineering-inclined.
Given the choice to select from a set of academic
tracks, Western Culture initially showed promise for
success. Yet the course was crippled by the program's
lack of a coherent reading list. Although each individ
ual track had its own tailored reading list, in an effort
to maintain the semblance of a common reading expe
rience, the Western Culture program required all
tracks to also follow a list of core texts. The imposition
of a core reading list proved difficult as many tracks,
particularly the Values, Technology, and Science track,
could not coherently incorporate the core texts into
the lessons.
At the same time, the student population experi
enced a demographic shift resulting in an increased
presence of minority groups, including African-Amer
ican, Asian and Latino students.
Disturbed by the Euro-centric nature of the tracks,
the Black Student Union, later joined by campus fem
inists and other minority groups, spoke out against
racism and sexism in the Western Culture curriculum.
"The Western culture program as it is presently
structured around a core list and an outdated philoso
phy of the West being Greece, Europe, and Euro-
America is wrong," said Bill King, chairman of the
Black Student Union in his 1988 address to the Facul
ty Senate, "And worse, it hurts people mentally and
emotionally in ways that are not even recognized."
Western Culture was replaced by Culture, Ideas
and Values (CIV). While retaining the multi-track
structure of Western Culture, the CIV track reading
lists were diversified to include representative works
from women and ethnic minorities alongside some
traditional readings. More importantly, the core read
ing list binding all tracks together was dropped.
The birth of IHUM
Surprisingly, CIV, in comparison to its predeces
sors, was a relatively short-lived program. The Com
mission on Undergraduate Education study in 1994
revealed that many students found that the tracks
were too diverse not only in content, but also in
workload and grading policy. Professors also felt that
there were too many books to cover in a single year.
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gradually re
placed CIV in the late 19905, the University's tonic to
clarify the CIV curriculum. The number of books des
ignated for each track was reduced and tracks were
modified to center around the universality of ideas.
According to the IHUM website, IHUM courses dealt
with the "issues, themes, ideas and values of human
identity and existence," rather than following a tradi
tional canon.
SLE, the "Great Books" haven
While the main freshman liberal arts sequences
have cycled through several incarnations, one residen
tially based program for freshmen has endured the
test of time. Unlike IHUM and its predecessors, the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) program has re
mained largely unchanged since its founding. SLE de
veloped from an evening seminar series titled "Social
Thoughts and Institutions," in which professors and
students from various departments, as equals, read and
discussed Great Books.
SLE became a fully-fledged residential program in
1974. With only minor modifications to its Great

Books reading list, SLE's Great Books approach has
been rated consistently high in student evaluations.
The self-selecting nature of SLE, which freshmen opt
into in place of IHUM, is one of the main contributors
to the program's enduring success.
"It's very simple they were voluntary," Reider
said. "They wanted to be there,"
Thinking Matters and the future of the humanities
Although the findings of the 2011 Study of Under
graduate Education at Stanford (SUES) on the luke
warm student enthusiasm toward the IHUM program
may be a recent development, the student voices
speaking out against the constraint of requirements
echo the spirit of the '6os, when pressure from students
to direct their own liberal arts experiences was the
strongest.
Thinking Matters, a one-quarter course slated to
replace the three-quarter IHUM program starting in
the academic year 2012-2013, came from a SUES rec
ommendation to increase the freedom freshmen, par
ticularly those enrolled in major programs with high
unit requirements, will have to explore courses outside
their major fields of study.
Thinking Matters will also break from the tradi
tional mold of humanities instruction with its develop
ment of innovative course themes. Proposed topics in
clude Brain, Behavior and Evolution; Energy; Evil;
and The Physics of One. Many of these courses will
draw upon a diverse variety of disciplines, including
those not traditionally studied alongside the humani
ties.
As reported by The Daily in March, the Faculty
Senate approved the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP) report supporting the
SUES recommendation on March 8.
Given the speed with which the Faculty Senate ap
proved Thinking Matters only two months after the
SUES recommendation some faculty are skeptical
of the success of the proposed course, or view the
amorphous, multi-disciplinary suggested course topics
as a sign of the atrophying presence of the humanities
at Stanford.
"It wasn't really that broken," said Greg Watkins,
assistant director of SLE. "The evaluations of IHUM
from students were quite favorable, more favorable
than student reputation. What the University has
caved into is the demand for choice."
"Not that there's something wrong with that but
students were feeling the yoke of that requirement,"
Watkins added. "I feel that it's like giving up on taking
responsibility for teaching in the humanities and re
quiring our students a certain level of education."
Other faculty members however are more opti
mistic, seeing Thinking Matters as a means of reviving
declining student interest in the humanities.
"I think it's plausible for us to speculate that the hu
manities in the future will no longer be a burdensome
requirement that everyone has to go through but it will
be one among many different opportunities," said
Russell Berman, director of the IHUM and Introduc
tory Seminars programs. "I say that if we are con
cerned that students will no longer take humanities,
we should just be more imaginative in the kind of hu
manities courses that we offer."
