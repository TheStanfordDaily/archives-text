The Faculty Senate closed the book on the Intro
duction to the Humanities (IHUM) program by
voting on March 8 in favor of replacing the pro
gram with a one-quarter "Thinking Matters"
course, scheduled to launch this coming fall. Al
though IHUM was a quintessential fixture of the Stanford
experience for recent students, it was only the latest edition
in Stanford's history of freshman liberal arts programs, an
undergraduate tradition that is nearly 90 years old.
Pioneering liberal arts
For the first three decades following the University's
founding in 1891, there was no freshman liberal arts core
program in place. In 1920, a yearlong course, The Problems
of Citizenship, became a requirement for all freshmen.
Partly influenced by the passage of the 19th Amend
ment, The Problems of Citizenship course endeavored to
teach students the necessary skills to become informed
citizens cognizant of their political environments. Topics
on the syllabus included Citizenship in a Democratic
World and Scientific Method and Attitude. In addition to
weekly lectures taught by faculty from various depart
ments, students also had one-on-one sessions with the in
structors.
The Problem of Citizenship program lasted until 1934,
when dwindling student interest and shaky faculty support
led to its termination.
The golden age of the Great Books
Unlike its predecessor, The History of Western Civiliza
tion program (Western Civ), launched in 1935, was taught
only by the History Department. Based on the Great Books
programs of Columbia University and the University of
Chicago, Western Civ was a single-track, three-quarter
course that used a core list of fifteen "Great Books" to trace
the development of European thought from the classical
age to modernity. The course reflected a trend in American
universities to rediscover European roots and affirm new
prominence in global politics after the chaotic confusion
and loss of identity during the decades following World War
I.
Western Civ was an immensely well-received program
and lasted well into the 19605. Although the course was an
tiquated in the sense that its reading list was composed of
works by white European males, many alumni have cited
the program as one of the best academic experiences they
had at Stanford.
"It helped me become a historian," said John Reider, '67
Ph.D. 'B3, former senior associate director of admission at
Stanford and former Structured Liberal Education (SLE)
director. "Many people of my ancient era look back on the
course with great fondness."
Challenging western thought: a humanities free-for-all
Swept up by the volatile political atmosphere that pro
pelled campus disturbances in the latter half of the 19605,
