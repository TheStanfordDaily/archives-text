At 10 p.m. on a Wednesday night,
Michael Tubbs 'l2 sits behind a
computer in the Black Communi
ty Services Center, working and
occasionally checking Facebook.
Standing next to him is a portable white
board with an essay outline. After turning in
the essay, Tubbs erases the board and fills it
once more with his thoughts. He writes most
of his papers about how to fix the problems
plaguing his hometown, Stockton, Calif.,
which Forbes called "America's most miser
able city."
Stockton faces looming bankruptcy, an
unemployment rate of 16.6 percent, a failing
education system and a high homicide rate.
According to ABC News, 56 people were
murdered in Stockton last year alone.
To help fix these problems and reinvigo
rate Stockton,Tubbs decided to run for City
Council, declaring his candidacy on Feb. 20
of this year. The election will take place on
June 15.
"I don't like politics I like impact,"
Tubbs said. "I like making a difference for
people, and the best way to do that in Stock
ton now, in my opinion, is through the polit
ical system.
"When I was thinking about what I
wanted to do post-Stanford, to me it was re
ally important to do something that might
not be glamorous or easy, but I could go to
bed at night thinking, 'l'm doing something
that's making a difference,"' he added.
Tubbs said a long train of experiences led
him to his decision to enter the political fray.
His long involvement in community efforts
in Stockton remained strong throughout his
years at Stanford.
As a rising sophomore, he founded a
youth advocacy group, Save Our Stockton,
in the summer of 2009 with some friends. In
May of his sophomore year, five murders in
Stockton stirred him to found the Stockton
Summer Success and Leadership Academy
to help stem violence in the area.
During the fall of 2010, Tubbs worked at
the White House under senior adviser Va
lerie Jarrett researching the most effective
practices implemented by mayors and city
councils around the United States to solve
problems similar to those faced by Stock
ton.

Then, in November, Stockton's struggles
hit Tubbs on a more personal level when his
cousin was murdered. He was not satisfied
by the community and political response to
the homicide.

"I was looking at the response from the
person elected to represent my district, and
it just was lackluster in my opinion," he said.
"I just saw the need, the lack of hope."
Recently, Tubbs has returned home on a
weekly basis to campaign, chat with mem
bers of the community and make his week
ly Saturday walk through the district. His
home is campaign headquarters, and his
family, after some initial trepidation, strong
ly supports his campaign.
Cameron Henry 'l2, Tubbs' close friend,
campaign marketing director and student
organizer, said Tubbs' engagement with the
community makes him a strong candidate.

"[You can tell he is a good candidate by]
looking at the man and the love he's shown
for this town," Henry said. "Literally every
paper and every class he's taken have been
looking at how he can help Stockton."

"I think he has the natural talent and
charisma, as well as a real vision of what he's
trying to accomplish," said Jim Steyer, a
comparative studies in race and ethnicity
(CSRE) lecturer who has worked closely
with Tubbs.

Heading into his last quarter of his senior
year, Tubbs said he hasn't had much time for
nostalgia. He's simply been too busy.
In addition to running for city council
and completing his bachelor's degree in
CSRE, he is working toward his co-terminal
master's degree in policy, organization and
leadership studies, serving as a Resident As
sistant (RA) in Ujamaa and running his var
ious programs and initiatives.

These include the Phoenix Scholars Pro
gram, a program he founded in March 2010
that provides college counseling and men
torship to over-200 low-income, first gener
ation and/or minority high school students.
"Today I looked at the Oval, and I
[thought] 'Yo, this is so pretty!'" he said. "It
was the first time I had stopped to do that..
. I think I'm just going to get really sad in
June. [Stanford] has been home."
Although Tubbs regrets the lack of time
he has had to reflect on his Stanford experi
ence, he continues to pile his schedule with
new activities. Instead of taking time off to
relax over spring break or head home to
campaign, he led a civil rights-focused Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) service trip
to Washington D.C.
"[Going on the trip] makes no sense in
the middle of the campaign, but hey, this is
what we do," he said.
Even though he immerses himself in
multiple activities, Tubbs still has time for
fun. He has even missed classes to coach the
Ujamaa basketball team in intramural play
offs and makes sure to find time to go out on
the weekends.
While he is confident and optimistic
about his City Council bid, Tubbs said he is
concerned with keeping his energy, identity
and commitment to the community admidst

what he sees as the murkiness of politics.
"I'm not a politician; I'm a public ser
vant," he said. "I don't want to be one of
those public servants who sound great on
the campaign trail, but then sit there and oc
cupy space."
He hopes to stay focused by setting aside
time to interact with members of his com
munity, particularly by taking time out of his
schedule to read to Stockton children.
"If you're only talking to political peo
ple, you lose sight of the regular people, the
people you are doing it for," he said. "Talk
ing to kids, playing with kids, reading to kids,
working with groups, just having tea with
someone that's what gives me energy."
If elected, Tubbs says his priorities will be
threefold: to promote public safety, to stim
ulate economic development and to jump
start Stockton's floundering education sys
tem, which Stockton parents call a "dead
end."
He believes an important step in com
bating all three of these problems is to pro
mote civic pride in Stockton.
"When you have a city that's been
kicked down almost as the black sheep of
California, hope and civic pride is a huge
thing that's lacking," Tubbs said. "In situa
tions like these, government can't solve
everything. It takes communal sacrifice,
communal love and civic pride."
According to Tubbs, citizens of Stockton
who have never before been involved in
politics are walking, donating and running
phone banks to support him. In the first
three weeks of the campaign, he collected
$B,OOO in donations.
"I feel like we're starting to fire up a lot
of the home base and other people in Stock
ton who haven't been engaged in local gov
ernment in a long time," Henry said.
When asked who inspires him, Tubbs
lists his mother, his aunt, his grandmother
and historical figures such as the Freedom
Riders. But above all, Tubbs said he is in
spired by the children of Stockton.
"We did a lesson in our summer program
about the Freedom Riders... and then a
week later there was a shooting and one of
the kids posted on Facebook, 'I don't care if
I get beaten, I don't care if I get stomped on,
I don't care if I get spit on. Just like the Free
dom Riders, I'm going to make a change in
my community,"' Tubbs said.
Two weeks ago, in the middle of finals
week, Tubbs went home to participate in a
reading event at two local elementary
schools. He was shocked by the familiarity
the children had with violence.

"I read a book about Martin Luther King
... towards the end, when he gets shot, it
was actually harrowing in away because al
most every kid in that room knew someone
that was shot, like it was normal, like 'Oh,
my uncle got shot in the head,"' he said.
Yet Tubbs left feeling inspired after hav
ing an emotional talk with the children
about their dreams.
"They said, 'I dream of a community with
no guns, with no violence, with no bad peo
ple, with more cops,'" he said. "Even a six
year-old understands that it's time to rein
vent Stockton and change course."

the campaign trail, but then sit there and oc
cupy space."
He hopes to stay focused by setting aside
time to interact with members of his com
munity, particularly by taking time out of his
schedule to read to Stockton children.
"If you're only talking to political peo
ple, you lose sight of the regular people, the
people you are doing it for," he said. "Talk
ing to kids, playing with kids, reading to kids,
working with groups, just having tea with
someone that's what gives me energy."
If elected, Tubbs says his priorities will be
threefold: to promote public safety, to stim
ulate economic development and to jump
start Stockton's floundering education sys
tem, which Stockton parents call a "dead
end."
He believes an important step in com
bating all three of these problems is to pro
mote civic pride in Stockton.
"When you have a city that's been
kicked down almost as the black sheep of
California, hope and civic pride is a huge
thing that's lacking," Tubbs said. "In situa
tions like these, government can't solve
everything. It takes communal sacrifice,
communal love and civic pride."
According to Tubbs, citizens of Stockton
who have never before been involved in
politics are walking, donating and running
phone banks to support him. In the first
three weeks of the campaign, he collected
$B,OOO in donations.
"I feel like we're starting to fire up a lot
of the home base and other people in Stock
ton who haven't been engaged in local gov
ernment in a long time," Henry said.
When asked who inspires him, Tubbs
lists his mother, his aunt, his grandmother
and historical figures such as the Freedom
Riders. But above all, Tubbs said he is in
spired by the children of Stockton.
"We did a lesson in our summer program
about the Freedom Riders... and then a
week later there was a shooting and one of
the kids posted on Facebook, 'I don't care if
I get beaten, I don't care if I get stomped on,
I don't care if I get spit on. Just like the Free
dom Riders, I'm going to make a change in
my community,"' Tubbs said.
Two weeks ago, in the middle of finals
week, Tubbs went home to participate in a
reading event at two local elementary
schools. He was shocked by the familiarity
the children had with violence.

"I read a book about Martin Luther King
... towards the end, when he gets shot, it
was actually harrowing in away because al
most every kid in that room knew someone
that was shot, like it was normal, like 'Oh,
my uncle got shot in the head,"' he said.
Yet Tubbs left feeling inspired after hav
ing an emotional talk with the children
about their dreams.
"They said, 'I dream of a community with
no guns, with no violence, with no bad peo
ple, with more cops,'" he said. "Even a six
year-old understands that it's time to rein
vent Stockton and change course."

Michael Tubbs is running for City Council in
his hometown of Stockton, the city Forbes
deemed "America's most miserable." He
was successful in the June primary.
Originally published April 3, 2012.

At 10 p.m. on a Wednesday night,
Michael Tubbs 'l2 sits behind a
computer in the Black Communi
ty Services Center, working and
occasionally checking Facebook.
Standing next to him is a portable white
board with an essay outline. After turning in
the essay, Tubbs erases the board and fills it
once more with his thoughts. He writes most
of his papers about how to fix the problems
plaguing his hometown, Stockton, Calif.,
which Forbes called "America's most miser
able city."
Stockton faces looming bankruptcy, an
unemployment rate of 16.6 percent, a failing
education system and a high homicide rate.
According to ABC News, 56 people were
murdered in Stockton last year alone.
To help fix these problems and reinvigo
rate Stockton,Tubbs decided to run for City
Council, declaring his candidacy on Feb. 20
of this year. The election will take place on
June 15.
"I don't like politics I like impact,"
Tubbs said. "I like making a difference for
people, and the best way to do that in Stock
ton now, in my opinion, is through the polit
ical system.
"When I was thinking about what I
wanted to do post-Stanford, to me it was re
ally important to do something that might
not be glamorous or easy, but I could go to
bed at night thinking, 'l'm doing something
that's making a difference,"' he added.
Tubbs said a long train of experiences led
him to his decision to enter the political fray.
His long involvement in community efforts
in Stockton remained strong throughout his
years at Stanford.
As a rising sophomore, he founded a
youth advocacy group, Save Our Stockton,
in the summer of 2009 with some friends. In
May of his sophomore year, five murders in
Stockton stirred him to found the Stockton
Summer Success and Leadership Academy
to help stem violence in the area.
During the fall of 2010, Tubbs worked at
the White House under senior adviser Va
lerie Jarrett researching the most effective
practices implemented by mayors and city
councils around the United States to solve
problems similar to those faced by Stock
ton.

Then, in November, Stockton's struggles
hit Tubbs on a more personal level when his
cousin was murdered. He was not satisfied
by the community and political response to
the homicide.

"I was looking at the response from the
person elected to represent my district, and
it just was lackluster in my opinion," he said.
"I just saw the need, the lack of hope."
Recently, Tubbs has returned home on a
weekly basis to campaign, chat with mem
bers of the community and make his week
ly Saturday walk through the district. His
home is campaign headquarters, and his
family, after some initial trepidation, strong
ly supports his campaign.
Cameron Henry 'l2, Tubbs' close friend,
campaign marketing director and student
organizer, said Tubbs' engagement with the
community makes him a strong candidate.

"[You can tell he is a good candidate by]
looking at the man and the love he's shown
for this town," Henry said. "Literally every
paper and every class he's taken have been
looking at how he can help Stockton."

"I think he has the natural talent and
charisma, as well as a real vision of what he's
trying to accomplish," said Jim Steyer, a
comparative studies in race and ethnicity
(CSRE) lecturer who has worked closely
with Tubbs.

Heading into his last quarter of his senior
year, Tubbs said he hasn't had much time for
nostalgia. He's simply been too busy.
In addition to running for city council
and completing his bachelor's degree in
CSRE, he is working toward his co-terminal
master's degree in policy, organization and
leadership studies, serving as a Resident As
sistant (RA) in Ujamaa and running his var
ious programs and initiatives.

These include the Phoenix Scholars Pro
gram, a program he founded in March 2010
that provides college counseling and men
torship to over-200 low-income, first gener
ation and/or minority high school students.
"Today I looked at the Oval, and I
[thought] 'Yo, this is so pretty!'" he said. "It
was the first time I had stopped to do that..
. I think I'm just going to get really sad in
June. [Stanford] has been home."
Although Tubbs regrets the lack of time
he has had to reflect on his Stanford experi
ence, he continues to pile his schedule with
new activities. Instead of taking time off to
relax over spring break or head home to
campaign, he led a civil rights-focused Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) service trip
to Washington D.C.
"[Going on the trip] makes no sense in
the middle of the campaign, but hey, this is
what we do," he said.
Even though he immerses himself in
multiple activities, Tubbs still has time for
fun. He has even missed classes to coach the
Ujamaa basketball team in intramural play
offs and makes sure to find time to go out on
the weekends.
While he is confident and optimistic
about his City Council bid, Tubbs said he is
concerned with keeping his energy, identity
and commitment to the community admidst

what he sees as the murkiness of politics.
"I'm not a politician; I'm a public ser
vant," he said. "I don't want to be one of
those public servants who sound great on
the campaign trail, but then sit there and oc
cupy space."
He hopes to stay focused by setting aside
time to interact with members of his com
munity, particularly by taking time out of his
schedule to read to Stockton children.
"If you're only talking to political peo
ple, you lose sight of the regular people, the
people you are doing it for," he said. "Talk

hit Tubbs on a more personal level when his
cousin was murdered. He was not satisfied
by the community and political response to
the homicide.

"I was looking at the response from the
person elected to represent my district, and
it just was lackluster in my opinion," he said.
"I just saw the need, the lack of hope."
Recently, Tubbs has returned home on a
weekly basis to campaign, chat with mem
bers of the community and make his week
ly Saturday walk through the district. His
home is campaign headquarters, and his
family, after some initial trepidation, strong
ly supports his campaign.
Cameron Henry 'l2, Tubbs' close friend,
campaign marketing director and student
organizer, said Tubbs' engagement with the
community makes him a strong candidate.

"[You can tell he is a good candidate by]
looking at the man and the love he's shown
for this town," Henry said. "Literally every
paper and every class he's taken have been
looking at how he can help Stockton."

"I think he has the natural talent and
charisma, as well as a real vision of what he's
trying to accomplish," said Jim Steyer, a
comparative studies in race and ethnicity
(CSRE) lecturer who has worked closely
with Tubbs.

Heading into his last quarter of his senior
year, Tubbs said he hasn't had much time for
nostalgia. He's simply been too busy.
In addition to running for city council
and completing his bachelor's degree in
CSRE, he is working toward his co-terminal
master's degree in policy, organization and
leadership studies, serving as a Resident As
sistant (RA) in Ujamaa and running his var
ious programs and initiatives.

These include the Phoenix Scholars Pro
gram, a program he founded in March 2010
that provides college counseling and men
torship to over-200 low-income, first gener
ation and/or minority high school students.
"Today I looked at the Oval, and I
[thought] 'Yo, this is so pretty!'" he said. "It
was the first time I had stopped to do that..
. I think I'm just going to get really sad in
June. [Stanford] has been home."
Although Tubbs regrets the lack of time
he has had to reflect on his Stanford experi
ence, he continues to pile his schedule with
new activities. Instead of taking time off to
relax over spring break or head home to
campaign, he led a civil rights-focused Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) service trip
to Washington D.C.
"[Going on the trip] makes no sense in
the middle of the campaign, but hey, this is
what we do," he said.
Even though he immerses himself in
multiple activities, Tubbs still has time for
fun. He has even missed classes to coach the
Ujamaa basketball team in intramural play
offs and makes sure to find time to go out on
the weekends.
While he is confident and optimistic
about his City Council bid, Tubbs said he is
concerned with keeping his energy, identity
and commitment to the community admidst

what he sees as the murkiness of politics.
"I'm not a politician; I'm a public ser
vant," he said. "I don't want to be one of
those public servants who sound great on
the campaign trail, but then sit there and oc
cupy space."
He hopes to stay focused by setting aside
time to interact with members of his com
munity, particularly by taking time out of his
schedule to read to Stockton children.
"If you're only talking to political peo
ple, you lose sight of the regular people, the
people you are doing it for," he said. "Talk
ing to kids, playing with kids, reading to kids,
working with groups, just having tea with
someone that's what gives me energy."
If elected, Tubbs says his priorities will be
threefold: to promote public safety, to stim
ulate economic development and to jump
start Stockton's floundering education sys
tem, which Stockton parents call a "dead
end."
He believes an important step in com
bating all three of these problems is to pro
mote civic pride in Stockton.
"When you have a city that's been
kicked down almost as the black sheep of
California, hope and civic pride is a huge
thing that's lacking," Tubbs said. "In situa
tions like these, government can't solve
everything. It takes communal sacrifice,
communal love and civic pride."
According to Tubbs, citizens of Stockton
who have never before been involved in
politics are walking, donating and running
phone banks to support him. In the first
three weeks of the campaign, he collected
$B,OOO in donations.
"I feel like we're starting to fire up a lot
of the home base and other people in Stock
ton who haven't been engaged in local gov
ernment in a long time," Henry said.
When asked who inspires him, Tubbs
lists his mother, his aunt, his grandmother
and historical figures such as the Freedom
Riders. But above all, Tubbs said he is in
spired by the children of Stockton.
"We did a lesson in our summer program
about the Freedom Riders... and then a
week later there was a shooting and one of
the kids posted on Facebook, 'I don't care if
I get beaten, I don't care if I get stomped on,
I don't care if I get spit on. Just like the Free
dom Riders, I'm going to make a change in
my community,"' Tubbs said.
Two weeks ago, in the middle of finals
week, Tubbs went home to participate in a
reading event at two local elementary
schools. He was shocked by the familiarity
the children had with violence.

"I read a book about Martin Luther King
... towards the end, when he gets shot, it
was actually harrowing in away because al
most every kid in that room knew someone
that was shot, like it was normal, like 'Oh,
my uncle got shot in the head,"' he said.
Yet Tubbs left feeling inspired after hav
ing an emotional talk with the children
about their dreams.
"They said, 'I dream of a community with
no guns, with no violence, with no bad peo
ple, with more cops,'" he said. "Even a six
year-old understands that it's time to rein
vent Stockton and change course."
