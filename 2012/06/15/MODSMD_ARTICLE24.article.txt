Having a fistful of
magenta powder
thrown at you
upon entering a
festival might
seem threatening at first. But at
Holi, a Hindu celebration
heralding the coming of spring
and a new harvest, it is actually
away of saying "Happy Holi!"
This past weekend, on Sat

urday and Sunday from If a.m.
to 3 p.m., Stanford's Asha for
Education put on its annual
Holi celebration at Sand Hill
Fields.
The celebration comes from
an Indian legend in which the
son of a tyrannical king sur
vives a fire through the power
of his devotion to the god Vish
nu. Typically celebrated on
March 8, Asha postponed the
celebration festival by a month
in hopes of warmer weather.

The color-throwing component of Holi may derive from Krishna
and Radha, two lovers from Hindu lore who started the practice
when revelling with young villagers on earth.
