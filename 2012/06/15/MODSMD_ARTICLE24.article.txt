Having a fistful of
magenta powder
thrown at you
upon entering a
festival might
seem threatening at first. But at
Holi, a Hindu celebration
heralding the coming of spring
and a new harvest, it is actually
away of saying "Happy Holi!"
This past weekend, on Sat

urday and Sunday from If a.m.
to 3 p.m., Stanford's Asha for
Education put on its annual
Holi celebration at Sand Hill
Fields.
The celebration comes from
an Indian legend in which the
son of a tyrannical king sur
vives a fire through the power
of his devotion to the god Vish
nu. Typically celebrated on
March 8, Asha postponed the
celebration festival by a month
in hopes of warmer weather.

The color-throwing component of Holi may derive from Krishna
and Radha, two lovers from Hindu lore who started the practice
when revelling with young villagers on earth.
This weekend, the 5,500
pounds of blue, red, yellow, green
and orange powder at Holi repre
sented the ashes from this myth.
The tradition of throwing colors is
also attributed to the blossoming
colors of spring, from a past in
which India was predominantly
an agrarian society following the
seasonal crop table.
"Holi is now seen as a Hindu
cultural tradition that transcends
religious boundaries," said Asha
projects coordinator Arvind Kr
ishna, a fifth year Ph.D. candidate.
Not only does Holi transcend
religious boundaries, but it also
focuses on breaching class and so
cial structures.
"Holi is an event open to peo
ple from different races, religions
and classes who are able to come
together and let go of social inhi
bitions," said Amruta Hardikar,
Holi media coordinator.
The experience of attendees
echoed these remarks.
"It was my first time attending
Holi, and I was surprised by how
freely old and young people lost
themselves in the powder," said
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5.
Stanford's Asha chapter,
founded in 1992, started hosting
Holi in 1999. Asha, meaning
'hope,' is a non-profit organiza
tion founded at the University of
California, Berkeley in 1991.
Since then, it has expanded to in
clude more than 50 chapters
throughout the United States,
Europe and India.
Correspondingly, Asha's Holi
at Sand Hill Fields has grown
from a small event with around
200 participating students to a
widely anticipated event with
more than 7,500 attendees. As the
biggest Holi party in the Bay
Area, Stanford Holi attracts a mix
of students and families from
miles around.
Along with water and color
fights, participants can enjoy Bol
lywood and pop music from DJ
Tanveer, performances by dance
groups such as Dance Identity
and Stanford Dil Se, and fresh In
dian food.
Asha for Education's mission
is to fundraise for the education
of underprivileged children in
India.
"Each year, we feature a par
ticular project to put a face on the
kind of work we do," Krishna
said.
Specifically, Asha has funded
the creation of eco-friendly
schools in rural India in coopera

tion with Steve Blank, a lecturer
in the Department of Manage
ment Science and Engineering
(MS&E). The project seeks to
combine education, energy and
economics to improve the quality
of government schools. Using en
ergy-efficient building designs
that run on low-cost solar power
systems, the project leaders plan
to educate villagers on energy-ef
ficient agricultural practices.
"This is done to help the econ
omy and to help villagers by giv
ing them access to technical
knowledge," Krishna said.
Asha has also raised funds for
a school for handicapped children
in India. This school focuses on
addressing problems that physi
cally handicapped children face
on a daily basis by offering fea
tures such as accessible ramps
and concentrated teacher atten
tion. According to Krishna, even
100 dollars can make a huge dif
ference in the life of a blind stu
dent through the purchase of a
text-to-speech converter.
By addressing problems that
are endemic to certain regions in
India, both rural and urban, Asha
is able to provide opportunities to
children who do not have educa
tional options or privileges.
"At the end of the day, my ef
forts make it possible for Asha to
put a few thousand kids in
school," Hardikar said. "I think in
the long run this will probably
lead to the emergence of a better
India."
In addition to providing finan
cial support, Asha also aids
schools by putting them in touch
with officials to inform them of
the progress of their government
funds, a right guaranteed by
India's Right to Information Act.
"Raising money, of course, is
one thing that we do, but our goal
is not just to raise money but also
help [disadvantaged students] in
any way we can," Krishna said.
While Holi at Stanford allows
students to let loose by tossing
colored powder at friends and
strangers alike, dancing freely to
music blasting over Sand Hill
Fields, it also presents an oppor
tunity to help students thousands
of miles away receive a good edu
cation.
"I felt carefree and able to let
go of inhibitions and just enjoy
spring while having fun with my
friends," said Guadalupe
Ramirez 'l5. "You could throw
powder at people you didn't even
know, like the water fight my
friends and I had with little kids. It
was also nice knowing it went to a
good cause."

of underprivileged children in
India.
"Each year, we feature a par
ticular project to put a face on the
kind of work we do," Krishna
said.
Specifically, Asha has funded
the creation of eco-friendly
schools in rural India in coopera

tion with Steve Blank, a lecturer
in the Department of Manage
ment Science and Engineering
(MS&E). The project seeks to
combine education, energy and
economics to improve the quality
of government schools. Using en
ergy-efficient building designs
that run on low-cost solar power
systems, the project leaders plan
to educate villagers on energy-ef
ficient agricultural practices.
"This is done to help the econ
omy and to help villagers by giv
ing them access to technical
knowledge," Krishna said.
Asha has also raised funds for
a school for handicapped children
in India. This school focuses on
addressing problems that physi
cally handicapped children face
on a daily basis by offering fea
tures such as accessible ramps
and concentrated teacher atten
tion. According to Krishna, even
100 dollars can make a huge dif
ference in the life of a blind stu
dent through the purchase of a
text-to-speech converter.
By addressing problems that
are endemic to certain regions in
India, both rural and urban, Asha
is able to provide opportunities to
children who do not have educa
tional options or privileges.
"At the end of the day, my ef
forts make it possible for Asha to
put a few thousand kids in
school," Hardikar said. "I think in
the long run this will probably
lead to the emergence of a better
India."
In addition to providing finan
cial support, Asha also aids
schools by putting them in touch
with officials to inform them of
the progress of their government
funds, a right guaranteed by
India's Right to Information Act.
"Raising money, of course, is
one thing that we do, but our goal
is not just to raise money but also
help [disadvantaged students] in
any way we can," Krishna said.
While Holi at Stanford allows
students to let loose by tossing
colored powder at friends and
strangers alike, dancing freely to
music blasting over Sand Hill
Fields, it also presents an oppor
tunity to help students thousands
of miles away receive a good edu
cation.
"I felt carefree and able to let
go of inhibitions and just enjoy
spring while having fun with my
friends," said Guadalupe
Ramirez 'l5. "You could throw
powder at people you didn't even
know, like the water fight my
friends and I had with little kids. It
was also nice knowing it went to a
good cause."

Having a fistful of
magenta powder
thrown at you
upon entering a
festival might
seem threatening at first. But at
Holi, a Hindu celebration
heralding the coming of spring
and a new harvest, it is actually
away of saying "Happy Holi!"
This past weekend, on Sat

urday and Sunday from If a.m.
to 3 p.m., Stanford's Asha for
Education put on its annual
Holi celebration at Sand Hill
Fields.
The celebration comes from
an Indian legend in which the
son of a tyrannical king sur
vives a fire through the power
of his devotion to the god Vish
nu. Typically celebrated on
March 8, Asha postponed the
celebration festival by a month
in hopes of warmer weather.

The color-throwing component of Holi may derive from Krishna
and Radha, two lovers from Hindu lore who started the practice
when revelling with young villagers on earth.
This weekend, the 5,500
pounds of blue, red, yellow, green
and orange powder at Holi repre
sented the ashes from this myth.
The tradition of throwing colors is
also attributed to the blossoming
colors of spring, from a past in
which India was predominantly
an agrarian society following the
seasonal crop table.
"Holi is now seen as a Hindu
cultural tradition that transcends
religious boundaries," said Asha
projects coordinator Arvind Kr
ishna, a fifth year Ph.D. candidate.
Not only does Holi transcend
religious boundaries, but it also
focuses on breaching class and so
cial structures.
"Holi is an event open to peo
ple from different races, religions
and classes who are able to come
together and let go of social inhi
bitions," said Amruta Hardikar,
Holi media coordinator.
The experience of attendees
echoed these remarks.
"It was my first time attending
Holi, and I was surprised by how
freely old and young people lost
themselves in the powder," said
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5.
Stanford's Asha chapter,
founded in 1992, started hosting
Holi in 1999. Asha, meaning
'hope,' is a non-profit organiza
tion founded at the University of
California, Berkeley in 1991.
Since then, it has expanded to in
clude more than 50 chapters
throughout the United States,
Europe and India.
Correspondingly, Asha's Holi
at Sand Hill Fields has grown
from a small event with around
200 participating students to a
widely anticipated event with
more than 7,500 attendees. As the
biggest Holi party in the Bay
Area, Stanford Holi attracts a mix
of students and families from
miles around.
Along with water and color
fights, participants can enjoy Bol
lywood and pop music from DJ
Tanveer, performances by dance
groups such as Dance Identity
and Stanford Dil Se, and fresh In
dian food.
