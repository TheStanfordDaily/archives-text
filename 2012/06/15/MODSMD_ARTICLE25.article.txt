Of the many Stanford myths
repeated to freshmen, one of
the most common is that up
to 70 percent of Stanford stu
dents meet their life partners
at the Farm.
According to the Stanford Alumni As
sociation and as reported by The Daily, in
fact no more than 15 to 20 percent of Stan
ford students marry fellow trees.The Daily
spoke with Stanford couples of all ages
about romance on the Farm.
Barbara Beck Garton '79 was on the
swim team with her husband-to-be Dan
Garton as an undergraduate at Stanford.
The couple met through the team during
their freshman year, although they did not
know each other very well at the time be
cause, as Barbara put it, "I was in the fast
[swimmers'] lane and he was in the slow
[swimmers'] lane."
In their senior year, the pair became
better acquainted. By chance, they lived in
the same house, where Dan was the presi
dent.
"He was the one who assigned the
rooms," Barbara said. "He remembered
me from swimming and put me around the
corner from himself."
Their courtship began, but was not an
immediate success. During fall quarter
their house put on a medieval party, in
which Dan's actions put a strain on their
budding relationship. Dan went dressed as
Prince Charming while Barbara dressed as
the Lady of the Lake from the Arthurian
legends.
"He had a big crush on me, but unfortu
nately he overindulged and ended up
stripping down to his tights," Barbara said.
"It took a few more months to repair the
damage he did at that party."
Eventually, however, Dan managed to
win his future wife over. According to Bar
bara, he impressed her with his ingenious
method of stocking the house vending ma
chine with beer, despite it being against the
rules.
Claiming that her case is not unique,
Barbara recalled that there were two mar-

riages from her freshman dorm
alone. Both couples remain mar
ried today, including her hallmate
who was also her best friend on
the swimming team and her
best friend from freshman year.
The marriage trend has contin
ued even in Garton's family.
"A girl from Dan's freshman
dorm became my sister-in-law by
marrying Dan's brother Michael,
a Business School student."
Keeping the Cardinal tradition
strong, all three of the Garton's
daughters attended Stanford.
One, a graduate of the class of
2007, met her husband at Stan
ford.
Some students, however, meet
their spouses years after their
time at Stanford, as was the case
for Hilary Lieberman Link '9l.
Link and her friends hosted a
Passover Seder in April 1989,
which her future husband attend
ed with a group of friends.
"We met that one night and
never saw each other again," Link
said. But 10 years later in New
York, a mutual friend set them up
on what was supposed to be a
blind date.
"I called my friend and asked if
Jeff Link was the guy from Hawaii
who came to our Passover Seder,"
Link said. "She said 'Yes, it was
and he was cute. You should go.'"
Although their relationship
didn't start until years after they
had both left the Farm, Link said
she feels that their shared connec
tion to the school played a large
role in the formation of their rela
tionship.

"[The Stanford connection]
runs through our relationship,"
she said. "I think the fact that we
met here had a huge impact.
When we re-met, that was sort of
it from then on."
While hook-ups and flings are
prominent on campus, there are
many couples that envision being
together for the long-term. Such is
the case with Megan O'Brien 'l4,
who met boyfriend Michael
Crayne 'l2 through the archery
team at the beginning of her fresh
man year.
Between schoolwork and ex
tracurricular activities, many Stan
ford students feel they are too
busy for a relationship. O'Brien
said she doesn't think this is reason
not to commit to one.
"Ideally, you'll both be in
volved in some of the same activi
ties, so you can spend that time
with them," she said.
Both O'Brien and Crayne are
members of the archery team and
share their Catholic faith.
"You should be helping each
other do what you already do bet
ter, not hindering them or taking
over their life," she said.
For O'Brien and many other
students who find love at Stan
ford, the connection they make
with their partners is more than
good chemistry, but something
that is deep and profound.
"To most, love is a warm, fuzzy
feeling that you have when you're
close to a person and want to be
with them a lot and enjoy spend
ing time with them," O'Brien said.
"Love is, above all, a choice to be
with someone and care for them
and give yourself up entirely for
them."
