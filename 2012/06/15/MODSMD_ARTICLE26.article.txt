The familiar tones of the Westminster Chimes
melody float across campus, followed by a
short pause. At this time, Stanford students
of the early 1900s would have pulled out
their pocket watches, ready to set at the im
minent stroke of the hour.
The tower clock can trace its history back to 1899
when Jane Stanford ordered it from the Seth Thomas
Clock Company, the same company that manufactured
the famous clock at Grand Central Station in New York
City. The clock originally resided on top of Memorial
Church, but the 1906 earthquake damaged the tower in
which it was installed.The clock was then transferred to
a new home, a shingled wooden structure, behind the
church a move that was intended to be temporary
but lasted for over 50 years.
Over the years, engineering students added a motor
to turn the dial so that the clock would continue to keep
accurate time, but the chimes fell completely out of se
quence. The clock stood as a relic of Stanford Universi
ty's earlier days sentimental but not particularly use
ful. By the 19605, the clock and its bells had disappeared
into storage and, for a time, into oblivion.
Henry Fuchs, professor of mechanical engineering,
took on the task of bringing the clock back to life in the
1980s, placing it in the Terman Engineering Building for
a few years. He discovered Dorian Clair, an expert in
antique clock restoration, who had a shop located in
Palo Alto. Clair had restored and maintained the Ferry
Building and Ghirardelli Square clocks in San Francis
co and the San Jose Museum of Art clock.
William Kimball '4l, after whom Kimball Hall is
named, donated enough money to build a clock tower
to house the old mechanism and chime bells.
Clair returned the clock to its original mechanical
functions, and in 1983 it took up its current residence at
the corner of the quad by the roundabout often called
the "Circle of Death." The clock is the most complete
mechanical clock displayed in the Bay Area.
"It's not only one of the best maintained tower
clocks," said Gibson Anderson '67, a Bonair Siding em
ployee who volunteers to set the clock and helps Clair
service it. "It's also one of the best displayed."
Through the glass walls of the clock tower, one can
view most of the mechanisms that make the clock run.
The pendulum runs on gravity. Weights pull on cables
that turn drums that are attached to gears that turn
other gears. Every 15 minutes, a stop releases the
chimes. Although complicated in assembly, the individ
ual parts that make up the clock follow simple rules, op
erating completely through mechanical processes.
"There have been no revolutionary changes in clock
design in a thousand years," Anderson said.

Digital wristwatches and smartphones may have re
placed pocket watches, but the principles on which the
tower clock runs harnessing the forces of gravity,
tension and basic machinery remain elegantly sim
ple.
The clock's timeless design helps it keep time re
markably well. A few weeks ago, its running six minutes
behind caused a minor stir on campus. But this delay
had been caused by human neglect in adjusting the
clock rather than any fault in its mechanism.
The clock itself is subject to the same natural laws on
which it runs. In dry weather, the pendulum loses mass
in the form of moisture, changing its effective length
and causing it to run behind time. The clock, however,
was built with gross and fine adjusting mechanisms to
compensate for climatic influences.
"As long as you keep it wound and set, it's going to
keep on going," Clair said. "The life expectancy of that
clock is several hundred more years if it's taken care
of."
The clock embodies Stanford's history not only in its

classic appearance, but also in the
efforts that Stanford students and
community affiliates have put into
it over the years. After its install
ment in 1983, Professor Dave
Beach's mechanical engineering
students made some modifications
to compensate for the effects of
weather, including a new tempera
ture-compensating pendulum.
Clair rearranged the weight as
sembly so that in the event of an
earthquake, the weights would land
in the pit below the tower rather
than potentially destroying the
clock by crashing into it. This im
provement proved itself useful in
the earthquake of 1989, and bash
marks from the weights can still be
seen on the tower's walls.
Anderson came up with an ex
ternal adjustment mechanism,
adding and removing small
weights to the pendulum weight in
order to compensate for tempera
ture-related weight fluctuations.
Bill Boiler '6B redesigned the bell

hammer mounting mechanism,
which had been improperly strik
ing and damaging the bells. For all
of these individuals, the clock
played a touching role in their
Stanford experiences.
"The clock and I followed each
other across the campus," Boiler
said. "When I was in graduate
school, the clock bells were visibly
sitting under a tree next door to the
Fire Station... it seemed natural to
respond to the request to help en
sure their future."
In 1994, Rob Bernier M.S. '96
Ph.D. 'Ol began maintaining the
clock, winding it up and checking its
accuracy weekly. In an interview
with The Stanford Report, he de
scribed the clock as "a mechanical
thing in a computerized world."
The tower clock's history is not
only mechanical. During its
restoration in 1982, Clair would put
together some of the parts on the
stairway of the engineering build
ing for show. To teach students not
to touch the clockwork on display,
Fuchs applied a layer of Moly Coat,
a black substance used on metal
that stains hands and clothes.
The night before the new
tower's opening ceremony in 1983,

an unidentified student put Mickey
Mouse hands on the clock face.
When it started at midnight, Mick
ey's minute hand bent over and
grasped the other hand, stopping
the clock. Clair had to go to the top
of the tower and pull them off be
fore it could run again.
Today, Clair, Anderson and a
number of graduate students and
Stanford affiliates maintain the
clock, winding it up every four days,
checking its accuracy, recalibrating
it when necessary and occasionally
cleaning its bells.
Having invested in the clock's
fate for over 25 years, Clair hopes it
will have a long future.
"Don't let it run down," he en
treated. "It's capable of keeping
pretty good time, and you can tell
just looking through the window if
it needs anything."
The clock occupies its stately
spot today and runs on time
through the efforts of students, fac
ulty and alumni over dozens of
years. Passing by, visitors can be
hold a living and ticking
record of Stanford's illustrious past.
