The familiar tones of the Westminster Chimes
melody float across campus, followed by a
short pause. At this time, Stanford students
of the early 1900s would have pulled out
their pocket watches, ready to set at the im
minent stroke of the hour.
The tower clock can trace its history back to 1899
when Jane Stanford ordered it from the Seth Thomas
Clock Company, the same company that manufactured
the famous clock at Grand Central Station in New York
City. The clock originally resided on top of Memorial
Church, but the 1906 earthquake damaged the tower in
which it was installed.The clock was then transferred to
a new home, a shingled wooden structure, behind the
church a move that was intended to be temporary
but lasted for over 50 years.
Over the years, engineering students added a motor
to turn the dial so that the clock would continue to keep
accurate time, but the chimes fell completely out of se
quence. The clock stood as a relic of Stanford Universi
ty's earlier days sentimental but not particularly use
ful. By the 19605, the clock and its bells had disappeared
into storage and, for a time, into oblivion.
Henry Fuchs, professor of mechanical engineering,
took on the task of bringing the clock back to life in the
1980s, placing it in theTerman Engineering Building for
a few years. He discovered Dorian Clair, an expert in
antique clock restoration, who had a shop located in
Palo Alto. Clair had restored and maintained the Ferry
Building and Ghirardelli Square clocks in San Francis
co and the San Jose Museum of Art clock.
William Kimball '4l, after whom Kimball Hall is
named, donated enough money to build a clock tower
to house the old mechanism and chime bells.
Clair returned the clock to its original mechanical
functions, and in 1983 it took up its current residence at
the corner of the quad by the roundabout often called
the "Circle of Death." The clock is the most complete
mechanical clock displayed in the Bay Area.
"It's not only one of the best maintained tower
clocks," said Gibson Anderson '67, a Bonair Siding em
ployee who volunteers to set the clock and helps Clair
service it. "It's also one of the best displayed."
Through the glass walls of the clock tower, one can
view most of the mechanisms that make the clock run.
The pendulum runs on gravity. Weights pull on cables
that turn drums that are attached to gears that turn
other gears. Every 15 minutes, a stop releases the
chimes. Although complicated in assembly, the individ
ual parts that make up the clock follow simple rules, op
erating completely through mechanical processes.
"There have been no revolutionary changes in clock
design in a thousand years," Anderson said.

Digital wristwatches and smartphones may have re
placed pocket watches, but the principles on which the
tower clock runs harnessing the forces of gravity,
tension and basic machinery remain elegantly sim
ple.
The clock's timeless design helps it keep time re
markably well. A few weeks ago, its running six minutes
behind caused a minor stir on campus. But this delay
had been caused by human neglect in adjusting the
clock rather than any fault in its mechanism.
The clock itself is subject to the same natural laws on
which it runs. In dry weather, the pendulum loses mass
in the form of moisture, changing its effective length
and causing it to run behind time. The clock, however,
was built with gross and fine adjusting mechanisms to
compensate for climatic influences.
"As long as you keep it wound and set, it's going to
keep on going," Clair said. "The life expectancy of that
clock is several hundred more years if it's taken care
of."
The clock embodies Stanford's history not only in its
