# STUDENT LIFE
## Band reacts to alcohol suspension

The Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) was placed on
alcohol suspension Feb. 6 by the Office for
Student Affairs, following incidents sur
rounding the abuse of alcohol at the Fiesta
Bowl, according to band manager Brian
Kooiman 'l2.
"There were several alcohol-related in
cidents at the Fiesta Bowl that led to alco
hol suspension," Kooiman said in an email
to The Daily.
Kooiman denied, however, that the
LSJUMB has had an unusual amount of al
cohol-related accidents or hospitalizations
this year. When asked how the
LSJUMB has responded to the incidents in
order to prevent similar ones from occur
ring in the future, Kooiman said, "We are
currently following our alcohol suspen
sion."
University policy for alcohol suspension
requires that all organization activities and
events be alcohol-free, according to Chris
Griffith, associate vice provost and dean of
student life.
"Other than events planned by the or
ganization for its members, it can be diffi
cult for non-housed groups to define what
activities constitute an organization event,"
Griffith said in an email to The Daily. "We
trust that they will abide by expectations
and will consult with us if they have ques
tions."
This is not the first time that the Office
of Student Affairs has imposed an alcohol
suspension on the LSJUMB. Griffith said
that the Band was placed on indefinite pro
visional status including alcohol suspen

sion in 2006 after band members vandal
ized and destroyed the Band Shak.
Griffith said that the current alcohol
suspension will be reviewed at the end of
Spring Quarter.

Band Member Reaction
Citing directions from LSJUMB staff
that discouraged non-staff members from
talking to the press, several band members
declined to speak to The Daily.
Responding to the imposition of the al
cohol suspension, however, one member
sent out an email to the Band's email list ex
pressing frustration with the LSJUMB
staff's non-resistance to University regula
tions. Noting their tradition of irreverence,
the student argued that the Band should
challenge the University's judgments
rather than comply with them.
The email thread received over 100 re
sponses in one night.
The imposition of the alcohol suspen
sion has unintentionally coincided with the
University terminating the independent
lease of Chi Theta Chi, a co-op which one
band member said has traditionally housed
an unusually high proportion of band par
ticipants. With this development along
with separate regulations the University
has recently placed upon band operations
related to transportation, field show regula
tions and the Band's internal disciplinary
management other band members said
they felt frustrated with the University in
more ways than one.
Alleged hijinks
The abuse of alcohol was not been the
only controversy involving the LSJUMB's
behavior at the Fiesta Bowl.
Following Stanford's defeat in the foot-

ball game, the former drum major
continued to call songs during the
presentation of the trophy and the
playing of Oklahoma State's alma

mater, disrupting the awards cer
emony and riling fans of both
teams. Several members of the
audience tweeted about the
Band's interference, and many
posted complaints online.
Although OSU fan Mark
Lash acknowledged the joviality
of the halftime show's "trash-

talk," Lash wrote on his blog that "
the post-game behavior of the
LSJUMB was "offensive, disre
spectful and way out of line."

Lash posted a letter that he had
written to the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment, saying that he had heard that mem
bers of the band mimed a plane crash
during the halftime show, a reference to
the crash that killed the coach and assistant
coach of OSU's women's basketball team
this November.
However, one LSJUMB member, who
wished to remain anonymous, gave an op
posing account, saying that a few band
members ran onto the field with extended
arms, like they do at every halftime show
before getting into formation, and that they
did not intend any such allusion.
"Running onto the fields with your arms
out is a lot different than mimicking a plane
crash," the source said.
According to the band member, Lash's
complaint about the Band's conduct at the
Fiesta Bowl was one of about 80 received
by the University. Griffith, however, said
that the exact count is unknown due to the
dispersion of complaints among adminis
trative departments and offices.

"We replied and expressed our apologies
for disrupting the award ceremony," Grif
fith said of the University's response. "We
are working closely with the Band leader
ship to develop protocols that will alleviate
the possibility of similar occurrences in the
future."
A band member also set off small explo
sives at the Phoenix Zoo preceding the
Band's Fiesta Bowl performance, accord
ing to two other band members who also
wished to remain anonymous.
LSJUMB staff declined to comment
about delaying the award ceremony and
about the alleged use of small explosives at
the Phoenix Zoo.

trust that they will abide by expectations
and will consult with us if they have ques
tions."
This is not the first time that the Office
of Student Affairs has imposed an alcohol
suspension on the LSJUMB. Griffith said
that the Band was placed on indefinite pro
visional status including alcohol suspen

sion in 2006 after band members vandal
ized and destroyed the Band Shak.
Griffith said that the current alcohol
suspension will be reviewed at the end of
Spring Quarter.

Band Member Reaction
Citing directions from LSJUMB staff
that discouraged non-staff members from
talking to the press, several band members
declined to speak to The Daily.
Responding to the imposition of the al
cohol suspension, however, one member
sent out an email to the Band's email list ex
pressing frustration with the LSJUMB
staff's non-resistance to University regula
tions. Noting their tradition of irreverence,
the student argued that the Band should
challenge the University's judgments
rather than comply with them.
The email thread received over 100 re
sponses in one night.
The imposition of the alcohol suspen
sion has unintentionally coincided with the
University terminating the independent
lease of Chi Theta Chi, a co-op which one
band member said has traditionally housed
an unusually high proportion of band par
ticipants. With this development along
with separate regulations the University
has recently placed upon band operations
related to transportation, field show regula
tions and the Band's internal disciplinary
management other band members said
they felt frustrated with the University in
more ways than one.
Alleged hijinks
The abuse of alcohol was not been the
only controversy involving the LSJUMB's
behavior at the Fiesta Bowl.
Following Stanford's defeat in the foot-

ball game, the former drum major
continued to call songs during the
presentation of the trophy and the
playing of Oklahoma State's alma

mater, disrupting the awards cer
emony and riling fans of both
teams. Several members of the
audience tweeted about the
Band's interference, and many
posted complaints online.
Although OSU fan Mark
Lash acknowledged the joviality
of the halftime show's "trash-

talk," Lash wrote on his blog that "
the post-game behavior of the
LSJUMB was "offensive, disre
spectful and way out of line."

Lash posted a letter that he had
written to the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment, saying that he had heard that mem
bers of the band mimed a plane crash
during the halftime show, a reference to
the crash that killed the coach and assistant
coach of OSU's women's basketball team
this November.
However, one LSJUMB member, who
wished to remain anonymous, gave an op
posing account, saying that a few band
members ran onto the field with extended
arms, like they do at every halftime show
before getting into formation, and that they
did not intend any such allusion.
"Running onto the fields with your arms
out is a lot different than mimicking a plane
crash," the source said.
According to the band member, Lash's
complaint about the Band's conduct at the
Fiesta Bowl was one of about 80 received
by the University. Griffith, however, said
that the exact count is unknown due to the
dispersion of complaints among adminis
trative departments and offices.

"We replied and expressed our apologies
for disrupting the award ceremony," Grif
fith said of the University's response. "We
are working closely with the Band leader
ship to develop protocols that will alleviate
the possibility of similar occurrences in the
future."
A band member also set off small explo
sives at the Phoenix Zoo preceding the
Band's Fiesta Bowl performance, accord
ing to two other band members who also
wished to remain anonymous.
LSJUMB staff declined to comment
about delaying the award ceremony and
about the alleged use of small explosives at
the Phoenix Zoo.

The Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) was placed on
alcohol suspension Feb. 6 by the Office for
Student Affairs, following incidents sur
rounding the abuse of alcohol at the Fiesta
Bowl, according to band manager Brian
Kooiman 'l2.
"There were several alcohol-related in
cidents at the Fiesta Bowl that led to alco
hol suspension," Kooiman said in an email
to The Daily.
Kooiman denied, however, that the
LSJUMB has had an unusual amount of al
cohol-related accidents or hospitalizations
this year. When asked how the
LSJUMB has responded to the incidents in
order to prevent similar ones from occur
ring in the future, Kooiman said, "We are
currently following our alcohol suspen
sion."
University policy for alcohol suspension
requires that all organization activities and
events be alcohol-free, according to Chris
Griffith, associate vice provost and dean of
student life.
"Other than events planned by the or
ganization for its members, it can be diffi
cult for non-housed groups to define what
activities constitute an organization event,"
Griffith said in an email to The Daily. "We
trust that they will abide by expectations
and will consult with us if they have ques
tions."
This is not the first time that the Office
of Student Affairs has imposed an alcohol
suspension on the LSJUMB. Griffith said
that the Band was placed on indefinite pro
visional status including alcohol suspen

sion in 2006 after band members vandal

Griffith said that the current alcohol
suspension will be reviewed at the end of
