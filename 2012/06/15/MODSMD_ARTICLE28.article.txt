Members of Occupy Stanford
spent Thursday demonstrating in
Berkeley and Oakland in support
of Occupy Education, a move
ment protesting funding cuts of
public education and tuition hikes
in the University of California sys
tem.
The rallies, which were part of a
nationwide Day of Action to sup
port public education, kicked off a
five-day march in Northern Cali
fornia to the Capitol building in
Sacramento, where demonstra
tors plan to begin occupying the
Capitol on Monday.
"This movement won't stop,"
said Laura Wells, the Green Party
candidate for governor in 2010, to
The Daily. "You can't deal the
next generation a lack of opportu
nity and expect them to sit there
and take it."
After smaller teach-ins and
discussions under the rafters of
the UC-Berkeley Martin Luther
King Jr. Student Union building,
Thursday's main action began at
noon in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza,
under drizzling rain.
The 16 Stanford demonstrators
led off the rally, taking turns read
ing an enthusiastically received
statement of solidarity to a hud
dled group of about 150 UC-
Berkeley students and staff and
city locals.
"An education like one re
ceives at Stanford should not be
'elite,' and you should not have to
be 'lucky' to get an education," the

statement read. "We won't accept
a future where access to education
is a privilege, and not a right."
Students drafted the statement
in Meyer Library Wednesday
evening.
"I know California is in a budg

et crisis," said Josh Schott 'l4 to
The Daily before the event, "but
education should always be a No.
1 priority because it's a key ingre
dient of democracy."
The hour-long rally featured
speakers whose various demands

reflected the diversity of the audi
ence.
Andrea Barrera, a senior at
UC-Berkeley, called for the
restoration of affirmative action,
while Joshua Clover, an English
professor from UC-Davis, said a

protection of union rights. Deco
rating the plaza were murals
painted by local high school stu
dents for the occasion.

"Don't close the colleges," one
painting read. "We're coming."
After the rally, with the weath
er clearing up, about 100 protest
ers gathered to make the six-mile
march to Oakland's Oscar Grant
Plaza, where Occupy Oakland
and students from other area col
leges were meeting. To chants of
"No cuts, no fees, education must
be free," the crowd fanned across
the breadth of Telegraph Avenue.
The public they met along the
way matched their enthusiasm,
for the most part. The marchers
were met with many honks of ap
preciation, but also a few obscene
gestures. One motorist was so in
censed he got out of his car,
punched a demonstrator and sped
away.
Though the rally and march
were smaller than previous
demonstrations, the atmosphere
among the protesters remained
hopeful.
Edwin Okongo, a lecturer in
Swahili at UC-Berkeley, said he
was marching for his nine-month
old daughter, whom he used to
bring to Occupy Oakland
protests.
"She's part of that, the
protest," he said, "and [it's impor
tant] to know that you can't just sit

back and wait for things to be
handed to you. You have to fight
for them."

It helps that he also lives in
Oakland, Okongo added.
"If this runs into any trouble or
anything, I'll just say I was walking
home," he laughed.
Another marcher, Paul Bloom
said he has been a resident of
Berkeley for almost 40 years and
has been involved in activism for
even longer.
"You make your path by walk
ing, and this is kind of consciously
doing that," Bloom said. "This is
just one day, and a rainy day at
that... I don't think you can take
a quick measurement and say
we're doing well because we have
a thousand people or we're not
doing so well because we have 200
or this or that."

After two hours of walking,
during which the number of
marchers dwindled to about 80,
the crowd arrived at Oscar Grant
Plaza, chanting, "Here comes
Berkeley."
Joined with the protesters al
ready there, the size of the whole
crowd swelled to just under 200, as
it prepared to begin the "99 Mile
March for Education and Social
Justice" to Sacramento. Though
about 80 people were committed
to walking at least part of the way,
organizers said they expect thou
sands at the protest that on March

5.
Here the group from Stanford
parted ways with one of its mem
bers, Peter McDonald 'll, who is
walking the entire distance to the
Capitol. Other Occupy Stanford
members will join him when he
gets there.
McDonald explained why he
decided to make the "99-mile
march," saying that Stanford stu
dents are usually too concerned
with academics.
"[At Stanford], everyone's al
ways so focused on the class in
front of them that it's hard to en
gage," he said. "Marching 80 miles
is a really important statement."
Occupy Stanford expanded
the scope of its operations this
quarter, participating in Occupy
Wall Street West in January and
coordinating with Occupy move
ments around the Bay Area.
The group has faced questions
on campus about the size and
strength of its movement, but Oc
cupy members said they believe
their involvement in demonstra
tions such as Thursday's proves
otherwise.
"You can always criticize peo
ple for shouting," said Emma
Wilde Botta 'l4. "But this is more
doing something concrete."

leges were meeting. To chants of
"No cuts, no fees, education must
be free," the crowd fanned across
the breadth of Telegraph Avenue.
The public they met along the
way matched their enthusiasm,
for the most part. The marchers
were met with many honks of ap
preciation, but also a few obscene
gestures. One motorist was so in
censed he got out of his car,
punched a demonstrator and sped
away.
Though the rally and march
were smaller than previous
demonstrations, the atmosphere
among the protesters remained
hopeful.
Edwin Okongo, a lecturer in
Swahili at UC-Berkeley, said he
was marching for his nine-month
old daughter, whom he used to
bring to Occupy Oakland
protests.
"She's part of that, the
protest," he said, "and [it's impor
tant] to know that you can't just sit

back and wait for things to be
handed to you. You have to fight
for them."

It helps that he also lives in
Oakland, Okongo added.
"If this runs into any trouble or
anything, I'll just say I was walking
home," he laughed.
Another marcher, Paul Bloom
said he has been a resident of
Berkeley for almost 40 years and
has been involved in activism for
even longer.
"You make your path by walk
ing, and this is kind of consciously
doing that," Bloom said. "This is
just one day, and a rainy day at
that... I don't think you can take
a quick measurement and say
we're doing well because we have
a thousand people or we're not
doing so well because we have 200
or this or that."

After two hours of walking,
during which the number of
marchers dwindled to about 80,
the crowd arrived at Oscar Grant
Plaza, chanting, "Here comes
Berkeley."
Joined with the protesters al
ready there, the size of the whole
crowd swelled to just under 200, as
it prepared to begin the "99 Mile
March for Education and Social
Justice" to Sacramento. Though
about 80 people were committed
to walking at least part of the way,
organizers said they expect thou
sands at the protest that on March

5.
Here the group from Stanford
parted ways with one of its mem
bers, Peter McDonald 'll, who is
walking the entire distance to the
Capitol. Other Occupy Stanford
members will join him when he
gets there.
McDonald explained why he
decided to make the "99-mile
march," saying that Stanford stu
dents are usually too concerned
with academics.
"[At Stanford], everyone's al
ways so focused on the class in
front of them that it's hard to en
gage," he said. "Marching 80 miles
is a really important statement."
Occupy Stanford expanded
the scope of its operations this
quarter, participating in Occupy
Wall Street West in January and
coordinating with Occupy move
ments around the Bay Area.
The group has faced questions
on campus about the size and
strength of its movement, but Oc
cupy members said they believe
their involvement in demonstra
tions such as Thursday's proves
otherwise.
"You can always criticize peo
ple for shouting," said Emma
Wilde Botta 'l4. "But this is more
doing something concrete."

Members of Occupy Stanford
spent Thursday demonstrating in
Berkeley and Oakland in support
of Occupy Education, a move
ment protesting funding cuts of
public education and tuition hikes
in the University of California sys
tem.
The rallies, which were part of a
nationwide Day of Action to sup
port public education, kicked off a
five-day march in Northern Cali
fornia to the Capitol building in
Sacramento, where demonstra
tors plan to begin occupying the
Capitol on Monday.
"This movement won't stop,"
said Laura Wells, the Green Party
candidate for governor in 2010, to
The Daily. "You can't deal the
next generation a lack of opportu
nity and expect them to sit there
and take it."
After smaller teach-ins and
discussions under the rafters of
the UC-Berkeley Martin Luther
King Jr. Student Union building,
Thursday's main action began at
noon in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza,
under drizzling rain.
The 16 Stanford demonstrators
led off the rally, taking turns read
ing an enthusiastically received
statement of solidarity to a hud
dled group of about 150 UC-
Berkeley students and staff and
city locals.
"An education like one re
ceives at Stanford should not be
'elite,' and you should not have to
be 'lucky' to get an education," the

statement read. "We won't accept
a future where access to education
is a privilege, and not a right."
Students drafted the statement
in Meyer Library Wednesday
evening.
"I know California is in a budg

et crisis," said Josh Schott 'l4 to
The Daily before the event, "but
education should always be a No.
1 priority because it's a key ingre
dient of democracy."

speakers whose various demands
