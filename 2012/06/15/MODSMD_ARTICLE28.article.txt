Members of Occupy Stanford
spent Thursday demonstrating in
Berkeley and Oakland in support
of Occupy Education, a move
ment protesting funding cuts of
public education and tuition hikes
in the University of California sys
tem.
The rallies, which were part of a
nationwide Day of Action to sup
port public education, kicked off a
five-day march in Northern Cali
fornia to the Capitol building in
Sacramento, where demonstra
tors plan to begin occupying the
Capitol on Monday.
"This movement won't stop,"
said Laura Wells, the Green Party
candidate for governor in 2010, to
The Daily. "You can't deal the
next generation a lack of opportu
nity and expect them to sit there
and take it."
After smaller teach-ins and
discussions under the rafters of
the UC-Berkeley Martin Luther
King Jr. Student Union building,
Thursday's main action began at
noon in Berkeley's Sproul Plaza,
under drizzling rain.
The 16 Stanford demonstrators
led off the rally, taking turns read
ing an enthusiastically received
statement of solidarity to a hud
dled group of about 150 UC-
Berkeley students and staff and
city locals.
"An education like one re
ceives at Stanford should not be
'elite,' and you should not have to
be 'lucky' to get an education," the

statement read. "We won't accept
a future where access to education
is a privilege, and not a right."
Students drafted the statement
in Meyer Library Wednesday
evening.
"I know California is in a budg

et crisis," said Josh Schott 'l4 to
The Daily before the event, "but
education should always be a No.
1 priority because it's a key ingre
dient of democracy."
The hour-long rally featured
speakers whose various demands

reflected the diversity of the audi
ence.
Andrea Barrera, a senior at
UC-Berkeley, called for the
restoration of affirmative action,
while Joshua Clover, an English
professor from UC-Davis, said a

wholesale restructuring of capital
ism is necessary.
Others recounted previous
protest experiences or asked for
