## Campus ROTC unlikely

A Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC) unit on Stanford's
campus is unlikely in the near fu
ture, according to University ad
ministrators.
The Faculty Senate voted 28 to 9
with three abstentions last spring to
extend an invitation to the military
to bring ROTC back onto campus.
However, it remains unlikely that
any military branch will take the
University up on the offer. The
lack of progress is primarily due to
low levels of student interest and
concerns about financial sustain
ability, according to Senior Assis
tant to the President Jeff Wachtel.
The University was free to
pursue discussions with the mili
tary about ROTC returning to
campus immediately following
the approval vote. However, the
Faculty Senate has not formed a
subcommittee to advise Presi
dent John Hennessy on ROTC is
sues, or to consider granting
course credit for ROTC classes,
Wachtel said.
Obstacles to establishing an
ROTC unit
For the military to be able to
justify the cost of establishing a
full-blown unit, approximately 15
to 20 students would need to
graduate per year from any par
ticipating branches of the mili
tary, according to Scott Calvert,
Director of Finance & Adminis
tration in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation.
Once attrition is accounted
for, as many as 100 students
would need to participate in
whichever ROTC unit was sta
tioned on campus.
"That's a very large number,"
Wachtel said. "Once we learned

that, we realized that there has to
be another approach to putting a
program together."
That alternative will likely
take the form of further collabo
ration with nearby universities
that already have ROTC units,
such as San Jose State University,
Santa Clara University and UC-
Berkeley, with whom Stanford
currently has cross-town agree
ments to allow for Stanford stu
dent participation. This alterna
tive could include anything from
allowing other ROTC units to
hold events on campus to hosting
ROTC courses taught by Stan
ford faculty for ROTC students
from Stanford and the partner
universities.
Calvert added that such collab
oration would compensate for the
fact that a relatively large number
of students, when compared to the
handful of Stanford ROTC partici
pants, is needed to facilitate many
of ROTC's leadership training ob
jectives.
"The federal government is
going through belt-tightening on
their budgets, and the military is not
exempt from that," Wachtel said.
"They're concerned about the cost
of any program they put in place,
but they're still enthusiastic about
doing something at Stanford."
The Naval ROTC proposal
Calvert sent Stanford's propos
al for a Naval ROTC unit to the
military more than one month ago,
but he expressed doubt that the
Navy will establish a unit on cam
pus.
"I think we presented a good
and viable case, and in different
economic times it might look more
attractive," he said. "We have not
heard back, but we're not putting
all of our eggs in that basket."
Calvert said Stanford focused
its efforts on the Navy because
both the Army and Air Force al

ready have a presence on the
peninsula at Santa Clara Universi
ty and San Jose State, respectively.
The number of Stanford ROTC
participants in the Naval program
was also highest at the time
Calvert wrote the proposal, and
those students must travel the far
thest of ROTC participants, to
UC-Berkeley.
"It doesn't make sense for the
Army to put two units 10,12 miles
apart from each other," Calvert
said.
Course credit for ROTC
According to Calvert, it is un
likely that any course credit will be
awarded for ROTC classes before
the fall of 2012.
"We're not close to actually
having details of the program,"
Wachtel said. "We're not really at
the point of having a program for
the faculty committee to approve."
Both the Army and the Navy
expressed interest in having their
curricula approved for course
credit. Wachtel said he plans to for
ward the curricula to the yet-to-be
formed Faculty Senate subcom
mittee to determine if the classes
merit Stanford credit.
"You can get activity credit for a
lot of things at Stanford," Calvert
said. "You can get it for yoga. And
that has a place in our education,
physical fitness and well-being. But
it's hard to imagine that some of
the activities and coursework that
they do in ROTC can't meet some
kind of threshold where we can see
the benefit of giving some tran
script credit."
Stanford's agreements with
other universities' ROTC pro
grams contain the necessary legal
framework for Stanford students
to receive academic credit for
ROTC classes, but for that credit to
be awarded, the Committee on
University Standards and Policies
(C-USP) must first evaluate the

classes. Hennessy pointed to this
possibility in last Thursday's Facul
ty Senate meeting.
"So far, none of our faculty has
even started to consider the mate
rial that is taught in those courses,
the credentials of the people that
teach them and so forth," Calvert
said.
Each branch of the military has
a unique ROTC curriculum that is
uniform at the national level.
Calvert said that Stanford plans to
work with a national ROTC staff
member to bring those curricula
before C-USP, but that the issue of
ROTC course credit is not yet on
C-USP's agenda.
"Curricular change certainly
takes awhile here," Calvert said.
The military has been receptive
to assisting in the process of getting
course credit for Stanford ROTC
participants, despite its apparent
reticence to commit to establishing
an ROTC unit on campus, Calvert
added.

"They think of the students that
participate as their students, too,"
he said. "They would love to see
transcript credit for the course
work that [ROTC students] are
doing."
Fiscal implications
If Stanford were to secure a full
ROTC unit on campus, the Univer
sity would share some of the cost
by providing furnished offices to
the unit, as well as assigning a Stan
ford administrator to the unit to
ensure continuity between the pro
gram and Stanford, Calvert said.
However, due to ROTC tuition
scholarships, he said that the net
monetary flow would be into the
University.
"Right now, without a unit com
ing, the financial obligation on
Stanford is pretty low," Calvert
said.

(C-USP) must first evaluate the

classes. Hennessy pointed to this
possibility in last Thursday's Facul
ty Senate meeting.
"So far, none of our faculty has
even started to consider the mate
rial that is taught in those courses,
the credentials of the people that
teach them and so forth," Calvert
said.
Each branch of the military has
a unique ROTC curriculum that is
uniform at the national level.
Calvert said that Stanford plans to
work with a national ROTC staff
member to bring those curricula
before C-USP, but that the issue of
ROTC course credit is not yet on
C-USP's agenda.
"Curricular change certainly
takes awhile here," Calvert said.
The military has been receptive
to assisting in the process of getting
course credit for Stanford ROTC
participants, despite its apparent
reticence to commit to establishing
an ROTC unit on campus, Calvert
added.

"They think of the students that
participate as their students, too,"
he said. "They would love to see
transcript credit for the course
work that [ROTC students] are
doing."
Fiscal implications
If Stanford were to secure a full
ROTC unit on campus, the Univer
sity would share some of the cost
by providing furnished offices to
the unit, as well as assigning a Stan
ford administrator to the unit to
ensure continuity between the pro
gram and Stanford, Calvert said.
However, due to ROTC tuition
scholarships, he said that the net
monetary flow would be into the
University.
"Right now, without a unit com
ing, the financial obligation on
Stanford is pretty low," Calvert
said.

A Reserve Officer Training
Corps (ROTC) unit on Stanford's
campus is unlikely in the near fu
ture, according to University ad
ministrators.
The Faculty Senate voted 28 to 9
with three abstentions last spring to
extend an invitation to the military
to bring ROTC back onto campus.
However, it remains unlikely that
any military branch will take the
University up on the offer. The
lack of progress is primarily due to
low levels of student interest and
concerns about financial sustain
ability, according to Senior Assis
tant to the President Jeff Wachtel.
The University was free to
pursue discussions with the mili
tary about ROTC returning to
campus immediately following
the approval vote. However, the
Faculty Senate has not formed a
subcommittee to advise Presi
dent John Hennessy on ROTC is
sues, or to consider granting
course credit for ROTC classes,
Wachtel said.
Obstacles to establishing an
ROTC unit
For the military to be able to
justify the cost of establishing a
full-blown unit, approximately 15
to 20 students would need to
graduate per year from any par
ticipating branches of the mili
tary, according to Scott Calvert,
Director of Finance & Adminis
tration in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation.
Once attrition is accounted
for, as many as 100 students
would need to participate in
whichever ROTC unit was sta
tioned on campus.
"That's a very large number,"
Wachtel said. "Once we learned

that, we realized that there has to
be another approach to putting a
program together."
That alternative will likely
take the form of further collabo
ration with nearby universities
that already have ROTC units,
such as San Jose State University,
Santa Clara University and UC-
Berkeley, with whom Stanford
currently has cross-town agree
ments to allow for Stanford stu
dent participation. This alterna
tive could include anything from
allowing other ROTC units to
hold events on campus to hosting
ROTC courses taught by Stan
ford faculty for ROTC students
from Stanford and the partner
universities.
Calvert added that such collab
oration would compensate for the
fact that a relatively large number
of students, when compared to the
handful of Stanford ROTC partici
pants, is needed to facilitate many
of ROTC's leadership training ob
jectives.
"The federal government is
going through belt-tightening on
their budgets, and the military is not
exempt from that," Wachtel said.
"They're concerned about the cost
of any program they put in place,
but they're still enthusiastic about
doing something at Stanford."
The Naval ROTC proposal
Calvert sent Stanford's propos
al for a Naval ROTC unit to the
military more than one month ago,
but he expressed doubt that the
Navy will establish a unit on cam
pus.
"I think we presented a good
and viable case, and in different
economic times it might look more
attractive," he said. "We have not
heard back, but we're not putting
all of our eggs in that basket."
Calvert said Stanford focused
its efforts on the Navy because
both the Army and Air Force al

ready have a presence on the
peninsula at Santa Clara Universi
ty and San Jose State, respectively.
The number of Stanford ROTC
participants in the Naval program
was also highest at the time
Calvert wrote the proposal, and
those students must travel the far
thest of ROTC participants, to
UC-Berkeley.
"It doesn't make sense for the
Army to put two units 10,12 miles
apart from each other," Calvert
said.
Course credit for ROTC
According to Calvert, it is un
likely that any course credit will be
awarded for ROTC classes before
the fall of 2012.
"We're not close to actually
having details of the program,"
Wachtel said. "We're not really at
the point of having a program for
the faculty committee to approve."
Both the Army and the Navy
expressed interest in having their
curricula approved for course
credit. Wachtel said he plans to for
ward the curricula to the yet-to-be
formed Faculty Senate subcom
mittee to determine if the classes
merit Stanford credit.
"You can get activity credit for a
lot of things at Stanford," Calvert
said. "You can get it for yoga. And
that has a place in our education,
physical fitness and well-being. But
it's hard to imagine that some of
the activities and coursework that
they do in ROTC can't meet some
kind of threshold where we can see
the benefit of giving some tran
script credit."
Stanford's agreements with
other universities' ROTC pro
grams contain the necessary legal
framework for Stanford students
to receive academic credit for
ROTC classes, but for that credit to
be awarded, the Committee on
University Standards and Policies
(C-USP) must first evaluate the

classes. Hennessy pointed to this
possibility in last Thursday's Facul
ty Senate meeting.
