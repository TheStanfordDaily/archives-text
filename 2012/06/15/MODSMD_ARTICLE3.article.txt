## Stanford submits NYC proposal 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Originally published Oct. 27,2011

Stanford University submitted
its proposal today to build a $2.5
billion, 1.9 million square-foot
graduate school of applied sciences
and engineering in New York City.
If the New York City Economic
Development Corporation
(NYCEDC) selects Stanford's pro
posal, the city will grant the Uni
versity land on Roosevelt Island

and $lOO million to develop its
campus over the next 30 years.
Once completed, "Stanford-
NYC" is expected to be home to
more than 200 faculty members
and 2,000 graduate students study
ing engineering, applied sciences,
technology and entrepreneurship.
The University is committing an
initial $2OO million toward Stan
fordNYC to cover startup costs
and an initial endowment for re
search. If the proposal is selected,
Stanford will begin a $1.5 billion,

10-year fundraising campaign to fi
nance the new campus and its en
dowment.
"StanfordNYC will bring Stan
ford's unparalleled track record in
research, innovation and entrepre
neurship to New York City, the
world's capital of finance, arts and
culture," President John Hennessy
wrote in the submission letter to
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg."StanfordNYC has the

potential to help catapult New
York City into a leadership posi
tion in technology, to enhance its
entrepreneurial endeavors and
outcomes, diversify its economic
base, enhance its talent pool and
help our nation maintain its glob
al lead in science and technology."
The school will have an em
phasis on transferring discoveries
to the marketplace, as it is expect
ed to serve as a catalyst for new
jobs in New York.
If StanfordNYC can produce
just 50 percent of the Stanford
startups in Silicon Valley, over
100,000 new jobs could be created
in the first 20 to 30 years on Roo
sevelt Island, University officials
said in a press release Wednesday.
They also claimed that Silicon
Valley venture capitalists have in
dicated they would follow Stan
ford to New York.
A faculty committee designed
StanfordNYC's academic pro
gram, which will focus heavily on
programs in engineering, comput
er science, entrepreneurship,
graduate business and technology
management.

"We can create a community
of scholars in an entirely new en
vironment, generating the next
wave of ideas and break
throughs," said Jim Plummer,
dean of Stanford's School of En
gineering, in the press announce
ment. "Innovation happens when
you are challenged by new prob
lems and look at solutions from
new perspectives. Our faculty is
very excited about the possibili
ties of New York City."
Hennessy noted that he sees
the program expanding over the
years to the undergraduate popu
lation.
"Over time, we can also devel

op programs for undergraduates
in New York," Hennessy said in a
late September joint interview
with the Stanford Report, Stan
ford magazine and The Daily. "I
can imagine a program potential
ly larger than our Washington,
D.C. program or any of our over
seas programs where students
can spend a quarter or more in the
city. The cultural richness of New
York in the visual arts, drama,
music offers benefits both to
students and to the departments
here on campus."
This submission marks the be
ginning of the final stage of a year
long process. Bloomberg and the
NYCEDC launched Applied Sci
ences NYC last December with a
request for proposals (RFP).
Hennessy discussed the idea
with the Faculty Senate and led
Stanford in submitting a formal
"expression of interest" in March;
a New York campus was also the
center of focus in April's Aca
demic Council meeting.
In July, Bloomberg requested
specific plans from the 27 institu
tions and others that met cer
tain criteria that responded to
the RFP. Since then, Stanford has
been working on its formal sub
mission: a 600-page proposal that
includes detailed academic, finan
cial, design and legal documents.
The Board of Trustees approved
the proposal in a meeting early
this month.
Final proposals are due by Fri
day; after that point, NYC offi
cials will begin the process of re
view.
Stanford officials are expect
ing to travel to New York City
after Thanksgiving to discuss the
proposal. The city plans to make a
decision by the end of the year.
However, there has been spec
ulation that Bloomberg may end
up picking multiple winners. Co

lumbia University and New York
University have proposed in
creasing the size and scope of
their existing programs in the city,
while Carnegie Mellon Universi
ty is proposing a school in Brook
lyn. Since none of these proposals
involve Roosevelt Island, there is
the possibility that the city could
award Roosevelt Island to one
group and a second site to anoth
er group.

"I want a new player here,"
said NYU President John Sexton
to Crains New York. "I've been
encouraging Stanford since Feb
ruary to come into this. I'm de
lighted Cornell is in this. We have
different ideas that aren't in com
petition with each other. They
complement each other."
One potential complication to
awarding multiple schools the
$lOO million and land grant is
Bloomberg's term, which expires
in 2013. Bloomberg's administra
tion has moved very quickly to se
lect a school in just one year to
break ground while Bloomberg is
still in office. Accomplishing this
with two different groups could
prove difficult.
Many of the 27 institutions
that expressed interest have
dropped their bid for considera
tion; Purdue, a public university,
decided to stop pursuing the ap
plied sciences campus in late Sep
tember, citing insufficient finan
cial backing from New York.
Cornell continues to be Stan
ford's main contender for the

Roosevelt Island bid. The two
universities are widely considered
to be the favorites to be selected
and have been making similar
moves since the competition
began.
Cornell reportedly hired a lob
byist and a public relations firm
for its pitch, and University Presi
dent David Skorton made a pitch
in a July 11 You Tube video. Stan
ford has hired public relations
firm Edelman and political con
sulting firm Tusk and most recent
ly had Google co-founders Larry
Page M.S. '9B and Sergey Brin
M.S. '95 expressing their support
for Stanford's bid on Stanford's
new Tumblr site.
Most importantly, both schools
have gained partners in their bids
since the initial proposals. Earlier
this month, Cornell declared that
it would partner with The Tech
nion Israel Institute of Tech
nology. A week before Cornell
announced the partnership, Stan
ford declared the creation of
"Stanford@CCNY," a collabora
tion with the City University of
New York (CUNY) and City Col
lege of New York (CCNY). If
Stanford's proposal is accepted,
Stanford@CCNY will offer joint
CCNY-Stanford 8.A./M.S. and
8.5./ M.S. degree programs, giving
City College students a unique
opportunity to pursue an ad
vanced degree at Stanford as un
dergraduates.
"One of the evaluation criteria
is community engagement and

community outreach," said Stan
ford spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"Our partnership with CCNY is
going to help us get a jumpstart on
a campus there and give us an ac
ademic location while we build a
new campus."
Lapin noted that the collabo
ration with CCNY is "not directly
related" to Stanford's proposal,
noting that New York's criteria
does not require a partnership
with any in-city organization.
Lapin said the collaboration
would allow Stanford to have fac
ulty and students in New York in
2013, before the permanent facili
ties would be completed on Roo
sevelt Island.

Hennessy sees the proposed
campus as a great opportunity for
not only Stanford and New York,
but also the entire nation.
"We are an American universi
ty, founded to do things for the
people and this country," Hen
nessy said in his joint interview
with Stanford new sources.
"That's certainly embedded in the
Founding Grant language. I'm
convinced that this country's
leadership position in science and
technology will be jeopardized if
we cannot grow more major insti
tutions and produce more gradu
ates in science and technology."
