Campus has erupted over the
past 36 hours in a firestorm of com
mentary on the actions and subse
quent criticisms-turned-attacks on
ASSU Vice President and Executive
candidate Stewart MacGregor-Den
nis 'l3.
Following news Wednesday that
MacGregor-Dennis spent over
$2,000 on various online services, in
cluding scraping student email ad
dresses from MyGroups and hiring a
social media manager to earn him
Facebook likes and Twitter followers,
criticism of MacGregor-Dennis
began to circulate on Facebook and
over email. Students reacted in
protest Thursday when the criticisms
shifted to attacks against MacGre
gor-Dennis.
The most controversial writing re
garding MacGregor-Dennis came in
the form of an anonymous, widely
circulated email sent late Wednesday
night from a person identifying as
Senator Palpatine, the name of the
"Star Wars" antagonist that has been
used in recent ASSU elections as a
non-partisan, write-in candidate for
the Undergraduate Senate.
The long, scathing email began by
criticizing MacGregor-Dennis, quot
ing articles and opinion pieces from
The Daily and Stanford Review. As
the email progressed, it descended
into a vitriolic attack on the personal
character and mental health of Mac-
Gregor-Dennis, calling him mentally
unstable and unfit to run for ASSU
Executive by quoting, without attri
bution, an anonymous comment on
The Daily website.
Another widely distributed email
sent Thursday morning from an
anonymous account (justice@stan
ford.edu) claimed to know Palpa
tine's identity through means requir
ing access to Stanford computing re
served for student resident computer
consultants (RCCs).The Daily could
not confirm this claim.
According to an RCC, an admin
istrator sent an email to the campus
RCC list asking Justice to step for
ward, and administrators later re
ported to RCCs that Justice has
come forward.
Campus administrators ex
pressed disappointment regarding
the email attacks, which likely violate
the Fundamental Standard.
"I'm writing to the student com
munity regarding the recent distribu
tion of unsolicited bulk emails and
campus blogs regarding current
ASSU election candidates," said
Nand Flowe, director of Student Ac
tivities and Leadership, in an email to
The Daily. "Hurtful claims that may
not be true diminish all of us and sup
press open, respectful and honest di
alogue. As a responsible and caring

community, we embrace vigorous
debate while respecting our individ
ual members. The recent communi
cations are contrary to these values."
Howe confirmed that the Univer
sity has opened an investigation of
the anonymous emails.
Criticism of MacGregor-Dennis
took several forms in addition to the
campus-wide emails.
MemeChu, the Stanford meme
group on Facebook, posted an info
graphic mocking MacGregor-Den
nis' Facebook cover photo and his so
cial media following, as well as apply
ing a "scumbag Steve" hat to the can
didate. The post garnered almost 200
likes.
Ralph Nguyen, one of the
founders of MemeChu, did not re
spond for comment.
"Static," a blog started last fall
quarter that describes itself as a site
for Stanford activists to meet and
talk, posted a poem titled "The White
Man's Dirty Work" decrying Mac-
Gregor-Dennis' outsourcing of work
to people of color, especially women
in developing countries. The final line
of the poem, which was co-written by
Holly Fetter 'l3 and Aracely Mon
dragon 'l3, reads "Your slave I will no
longer be."
It remains to be seen what effect
the shift in campus atmosphere will
have on election results. Polls close
Friday at 11:59 p.m. and election re
sults will be announced at 5 p.m. on
Saturday. Voters may edit their bal
lots until polls close.
"They have negatively impacted
the election," said Elections Com
missioner Adam Adler 'l2 of the
anonymous emails. "I've received
emails from people who are basically
turned off from voting because of
those things."
Adler said he believes the "in
tegrity of the election" has not been
compromised, but the student body
may look less favorably on the elec
tion process due to the Palpatine
email.
"People don't like it," he said, re
ferring to the situation as a whole and
the use of the Senator Palpatine gim
mick for partisan purposes.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and William
Wagstaff 'l2, MacGregor-Dennis'
main competitors for ASSU Execu
tive, released a video commenting
upon the attacks.
"A lot of what we've been seeing,
to us, goes beyond this scope of this
election," said Zimbroff in the video
posted on Facebook early Thursday
morning. "For the next few days, and
for the rest of the race, we just ask
people to be respectful, and to treat
people like [they] want to be treat
ed."
MacGregor-Dennis declined to
comment for this article.
