## Ogwumike goes No. 1 to WNBA

The LA Sparks selected senior for
ward Nnemkadi Ogwumike, the face
of Stanford women's basketball, as
the No. 1 pick in Monday's 2012
WNBA draft.
Ogwumike becomes the first Car
dinal player to be taken first overall in
school history and the 10th to be
picked in the first round. Five of those
first round picks are active WNBA
players, including three of her former
teammates: forward Jayne Appel 'lO
(San Antonio Silver Stars), forward
Kayla Pedersen 'll (Tulsa Shock) and
guard Jeanette Pohlen 'll (Indiana
Fever). The other two are guard Can
dice Wiggins 'OB (Minnesota Lynx)
and forward Nicole Powell 'O4 (New
York Liberty).
Ogwumike had a stellar career at
Stanford, joining the exclusive 2,000-
point and 1,000-rebound club, but
perhaps stands out most for her senior
season. Ogwumike set the single-sea
son scoring record with 809 points and
placed second behind Wiggins on the
career-scoring list with 2,491 points.
She also was named the Pac-12 Player
of the Year, the second time she won
the conference's top honor, and was
selected to the All-America teams of
the WBCA Coaches, Associated
Press, USBWA and John R. Wooden
Award. She also took home the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.

"I think I realized that, as the com
petition and the challenges in basket
ball in college got harder, I needed to
do more, and I had a lot to learn
from," Ogwumike said. "I learned
from Kayla, Jayne and even Candice.
I didn't get to play with her, but every
year my coaches and my teammates
have really helped me make myself a
better player."
Barely a month after the disap
pointment of losing to Baylor at the
NCAA Final Four in Denver, Ogwu
mike may soon be back in action, as
the Sparks are due to take on the Chi
nese and Japanese national teams in
preseason games in early May before
launching the 2012 season on the road
against the Seattle Storm on May 13.
With star forward Candace Parker
sidelined for much of the season, the
Sparks finished second to last in the
Western Conference last year and did
not qualify for the playoffs. Although
head coach Carol Ross will be starting
her first year at the helm, the team,
with two stars in Parker and Ogwu
mike, will be expected to perform.
"I know for one that coach Carol
Ross is an amazing coach," Ogwu
mike said of her new team.'Tve heard
so many good things about her. Obvi
ously you have Candace [Parker],
Ebony Floffman and so many other
people on that team, and I just want to
come in and contribute. Pm not look
ing to do too much; I'm just looking to
do me."
Back on the Farm, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer must now
plan for a future without this season's
star player. Ogwumike won four
straight Pac-12 conference and tour
nament titles, went to four straight
NCAA Final Fours, never lost at
Maples Pavilion and dropped just a
single game to Pac-12 opponents, a
contest against Cal in January of
2009.
With the standard set by recent
Stanford classes, there will be some
big shoes to fill by returning and in
coming players. One of those players,
Nneka's younger sister Chiney Og
wumike, will be counted on to handle
the scoring and rebounding load after
averaging 15.0 points and 11.2 boards
in her sophomore season. Fortunately
for the Cardinal, Pac-12 opponents
will still have to contend with at least
half of the sister act.

against the Seattle Storm on May 13.
With star forward Candace Parker
sidelined for much of the season, the
Sparks finished second to last in the
Western Conference last year and did
not qualify for the playoffs. Although
head coach Carol Ross will be starting
her first year at the helm, the team,
with two stars in Parker and Ogwu
mike, will be expected to perform.
"I know for one that coach Carol
Ross is an amazing coach," Ogwu
mike said of her new team.'Tve heard
so many good things about her. Obvi
ously you have Candace [Parker],
Ebony Floffman and so many other
people on that team, and I just want to
come in and contribute. Pm not look
ing to do too much; I'm just looking to
do me."
Back on the Farm, Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer must now
plan for a future without this season's
star player. Ogwumike won four
straight Pac-12 conference and tour
nament titles, went to four straight
NCAA Final Fours, never lost at
Maples Pavilion and dropped just a
single game to Pac-12 opponents, a
contest against Cal in January of
2009.
With the standard set by recent
Stanford classes, there will be some
big shoes to fill by returning and in
coming players. One of those players,
Nneka's younger sister Chiney Og
wumike, will be counted on to handle
the scoring and rebounding load after
averaging 15.0 points and 11.2 boards
in her sophomore season. Fortunately
for the Cardinal, Pac-12 opponents
will still have to contend with at least
half of the sister act.
