Two missed field goals in the Fiesta Bowl. A
sublime triple-overtime victory against USC.
The final season for one of the supreme talents
in Stanford and college football history.
The 2011 Stanford football season is un
likely to be forgotten by any Stanford fan for a
long time, and now that the college football
season is over, it's time to take stock of what
exactly fans will remember and will want to
forget from this season.
The Good: 1) Andrew Luck. Of course, the
list has to start with the best player in college
football. Luck was expected to be spectacular
this entire season after bypassing the NFL
draft for another shot at the national title and
Heisman trophy, and he lived up to all of those
expectations. While he won't be taking home a
crystal football or a Fleisman, he shattered
records, made some truly incredible plays (like
his one-handed catch, clutch 4th quarter and
overtime performance against USC and his
near-flawless game against Oklahoma State)
and assured himself the No. 1 pick in the draft
once again. While Colts fans are deeply fond of
Peyton Manning, Luck should certainly have
little trouble finding a warm welcome in Indi
anapolis next year.
2) 56-48,30 T. In one of the wildest games
in the entirety of college football this season,
two of the most talented teams in the nation
battled out an instant classic. And of course,
the good guys won.
3) Stepfan Taylor. The junior running back
became just the third player in Stanford histo
ry to have back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing
seasons, a testament not only to his skill as a
runner but also to his ability to stay healthy de
spite carrying the ball 242 times this season.

Taylor averaged a solid 5.5 yards a carry and
was in the top 25 nationally in rush yards per
game. If he weren't so overshadowed by An
drew Luck, Taylor likely would be hailed as
one of the most talented, well-rounded run
ning backs in the country. But he's likely to fi
nally earn some of that well-deserved praise as
the centerpiece of the Cardinal offense in its
2012 campaign.
4) Tree's Company. The Cardinal's trio of

tight ends was easily one of the best in the en
tire country this season, as Zach Ertz, Levine
Toilolo and Coby Fleener combined to score
20 receiving touchdowns. While each one did
miss game time with injuries, the production
from these three dynamic players was instru
mental in helping the Cardinal offense be so
dominant. Other than one underwhelming


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior running back Stepfan Taylor, who finished with more than 1,000 rushing yards in back-to-back
seasons, was a bright spot in the Cardinal's 2011 campaign. With Luck's departure,
he is poised to be the focal point of Stanford's offense in 2012.
