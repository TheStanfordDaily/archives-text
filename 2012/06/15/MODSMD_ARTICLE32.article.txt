Two missed field goals in the Fiesta Bowl. A
sublime triple-overtime victory against USC.
The final season for one of the supreme talents
in Stanford and college football history.
The 2011 Stanford football season is un
likely to be forgotten by any Stanford fan for a
long time, and now that the college football
season is over, it's time to take stock of what
exactly fans will remember and will want to
forget from this season.
The Good: 1) Andrew Luck. Of course, the
list has to start with the best player in college
football. Luck was expected to be spectacular
this entire season after bypassing the NFL
draft for another shot at the national title and
Heisman trophy, and he lived up to all of those
expectations. While he won't be taking home a
crystal football or a Fleisman, he shattered
records, made some truly incredible plays (like
his one-handed catch, clutch 4th quarter and
overtime performance against USC and his
near-flawless game against Oklahoma State)
and assured himself the No. 1 pick in the draft
once again. While Colts fans are deeply fond of
Peyton Manning, Luck should certainly have
little trouble finding a warm welcome in Indi
anapolis next year.
2) 56-48,30 T. In one of the wildest games
in the entirety of college football this season,
two of the most talented teams in the nation
battled out an instant classic. And of course,
the good guys won.
3) Stepfan Taylor. The junior running back
became just the third player in Stanford histo
ry to have back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing
seasons, a testament not only to his skill as a
runner but also to his ability to stay healthy de
spite carrying the ball 242 times this season.

Taylor averaged a solid 5.5 yards a carry and
was in the top 25 nationally in rush yards per
game. If he weren't so overshadowed by An
drew Luck, Taylor likely would be hailed as
one of the most talented, well-rounded run
ning backs in the country. But he's likely to fi
nally earn some of that well-deserved praise as
the centerpiece of the Cardinal offense in its
2012 campaign.
4) Tree's Company. The Cardinal's trio of

tight ends was easily one of the best in the en
tire country this season, as Zach Ertz, Levine
Toilolo and Coby Fleener combined to score
20 receiving touchdowns. While each one did
miss game time with injuries, the production
from these three dynamic players was instru
mental in helping the Cardinal offense be so
dominant. Other than one underwhelming

Junior running back Stepfan Taylor, who finished with more than 1,000 rushing yards in back-to-back
seasons, was a bright spot in the Cardinal's 2011 campaign. With Luck's departure,
he is poised to be the focal point of Stanford's offense in 2012.
performance from the three
against Oregon, the trio continual
ly made big plays at critical mo
ments throughout the season. One
can assume that Ertz and Toilolo
will be major factors in the Stan
ford offense next season, and
Fleener has been receiving a lot of
praise from NFL Draft scouts, as
many expect him to be taken in the
first three rounds this April.
5) Fresh faces. After some
major injuries forced the Cardinal
to reshuffle its lineup midway
through the season, one can very
safely say that those players who
were asked to step in did so in im
pressive fashion. On defense,
Jarek Lancaster and AJ Tarpley
both played extremely well in the
stead of Shayne Skov, with Lan
caster leading the team with 70
tackles and Tarpley notching the
third-most tackles on the team
with 57, despite starting only seven
games. On offense, freshman wide
receiver Ty Montgomery stepped
in for Chris Owusu and made him
self a vital part of the offense.
Montgomery had 120 yards and a
touchdown to lead all Cardinal re
ceivers in the Fiesta Bowl, and the
Texas native also had a rushing
touchdown against Cal and a kick
off return for a score against Wash
ington State. The early success of
Lancaster, Tarpley and Mont
gomery proves that the Cardinal
coaching staff knows what it's
doing when it hits the recruiting
trail.
6) Shaw and the coaching staff.
In his first season at the helm,
Shaw crafted an experienced, pro
fessional staff of coaches that kept
the Cardinal in the national title
hunt for most of the year. Of
course, there were moments
where Shaw and company fell into
the category of "not so good," but
on the whole, the group did a great
job of making sure the Cardinal
achieved almost all of the goals it
was expected to achieve in the pre
season.

The Not-so-good: 1) The kick
ing game. It's not entirely fair to
put Jordan Williamson into this
category he was having a bril
liant year before a midseason in
jury but unfortunately, you
can't look past the missed kicks in
the Fiesta Bowl. Additionally, the
team struggled with kicking the
ball out of bounds on kickoffs.
2) Injuries. Watching Chris
Owusu fall to the turf several
times this season after a blow to
the head was a terrifying reminder
of just how costly the game of foot
ball can be and how thankful
Owusu and the Cardinal should be
that those injuries were not any
worse. Also, the loss of Shayne
Skov in the fourth game of the
year was obviously a major blow
to the Cardinal this season it's
never a good thing to lose your
best defensive player, even though
Lancaster and Tarpley filled in
well in his spot.
3) The Oregon debacle. At
every turn, the Ducks fully domi
nated the Cardinal's most-hyped
game of the season. The loss ended
any hopes Stanford had for a na
tional title, and being blown off the
field by more than 20 points in
your own house is something that
should not happen to any top-ten
team.
4) The tragic death of defen
sive assistant coach Chester Mc-
Glockton. A rising star on the
Stanford coaching staff, Mc-
Glockton was just 42 years old
when he passed away on Nov. 30.
One only had to look at the out
pouring of emotions from fellow
coaches and his players on Twitter
to see that McGlockton was well
respected and admired through
out the Stanford family, and that
he will be missed.
Next week, we'll take a look
ahead to what 2012 will bring for
the Cardinal including a top
tier recruiting class and a rebuilt
offense and defense but for
now, it's good to take one last mo
ment and reflect on an unforget
table 2011, for both its good and
bad.
