It was a historic day for Stan
ford women's tennis at the
NCAA Tennis Championships,
as an all-Cardinal final in the sin

gles draw was followed by a dou
bles title just hours later. Sopho
more Nicole Gibbs defeated jun
ior teammate Mallory Burdette
for the individual championship
before the two joined forces to
take the doubles crown 6-2,6-4.
Gibbs became only the third
Stanford player to win both the

singles and doubles titles in the
same year at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Monday's win at the
Dan Magill Tennis Complex in
Athens, Ga., made Gibbs the
15th Stanford woman to win the
collegiate singles championship
and the first since Amber Liu in
2004.

Gibbs defeated Burdette, 2-6,
7-6 (5), 6-3 in a mentally grueling
match in which she was once a set
and three games behind. Gibbs
came back to force a second set
tiebreak, where she fell behind 5-
2 and once again found herself
