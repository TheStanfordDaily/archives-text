It was a historic day for Stan
ford women's tennis at the
NCAA Tennis Championships,
as an all-Cardinal final in the sin

gles draw was followed by a dou
bles title just hours later. Sopho
more Nicole Gibbs defeated jun
ior teammate Mallory Burdette
for the individual championship
before the two joined forces to
take the doubles crown 6-2,6-4.
Gibbs became only the third
Stanford player to win both the

singles and doubles titles in the
same year at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Monday's win at the
Dan Magill Tennis Complex in
Athens, Ga., made Gibbs the
15th Stanford woman to win the
collegiate singles championship
and the first since Amber Liu in
2004.

Gibbs defeated Burdette, 2-6,
7-6 (5), 6-3 in a mentally grueling
match in which she was once a set
and three games behind. Gibbs
came back to force a second set
tiebreak, where she fell behind 5-
2 and once again found herself

on the brink of elimination.
In the first set, Burdette was
the more assertive player, as she
came to net successfully and took
control of the match. Ahead 4-1 in
the second set, she looked poised
to run away with the trophy. Bur
dette had not lost more than three
games in a set in the entire tour
nament, and she appeared set on
continuing that dominant streak.
"I had kind of resigned myself
to losing to someone who was
playing by far the best tennis in all
of college tennis," Gibbs said. "At
that point, I was just trying any
thing possible to stay in points."
Gibbs' persistence paid off.
She won three straight games as
Burdette began making unforced
errors and double faulted on a
crucial point. The set evened out
at 4-4, and after trading breaks
they went into a tiebreak.
Burdette again looked poised
to win the match, needing just two
points to clinch after jumping out
to a 5-2 lead. But Gibbs hung on
to win five straight points and
take the set. At that point, ah of
the momentum and confidence
belonged to the sophomore, and
she got an early break on her way
to a 6-3 third-set win.
The teammates would later
share the joy of winning a cham
pionship together, but that would
have to wait. As Gibbs stood on
her side looking at the sky with a
smile, Burdette sat down on her
side of the court and stared off in
disbelief.
Head coach Lele Forood
summed up how it must have felt
for her top two players.
"It's difficult. It's even difficult
for the winner because they are

really excited, but also they feel
bad for their teammate," she said.
Gibbs and Burdette gave each
other time apart to soak up the
emotions from the match, but
there was more work to be done.
"I knew there was no way I
was going to let that singles match
get in the way of us performing
the way I thought we could in
doubles," Burdette said.
Burdette eventually found
Gibbs to tell her how proud she
was and how excited she was for
doubles.
"I told her congratulations,
and I was like 'You can come in
side. I'm fine. I'm not going to
bite. You can come inside and sit
and hang out until we go on the
doubles court,'" Burdette said.
Gibbs certainly appreciated
the gesture, and their hard-fought
battle in singles only seemed to
help their play on the doubles
court.
"She was such a professional
and such a great teammate ...
We were as close as teammates as
we have ever been playing for the
championship match in doubles,"
Gibbs said.
Just over an hour later, the two
paired up on the same side of the
court to win the doubles trophy.
Gibbs and Burdette defeated
Georgia's Nadja Gilchrist and
Chelsey Gullickson 6-2,6-4.
It was the second NCAA dou
bles championship in a row for
Burdette and the first for Gibbs
after entering this year's doubles
draw as the No. 2 seed. Stanford
has now won three straight
NCAA doubles titles and 15
overall.
"We played really well, super
solid, and I couldn't be more
proud," Burdette said.

It was a historic day for Stan
ford women's tennis at the
NCAA Tennis Championships,
as an all-Cardinal final in the sin

gles draw was followed by a dou
bles title just hours later. Sopho
more Nicole Gibbs defeated jun
ior teammate Mallory Burdette
for the individual championship
before the two joined forces to
take the doubles crown 6-2,6-4.
Gibbs became only the third
Stanford player to win both the

singles and doubles titles in the
same year at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Monday's win at the
Dan Magill Tennis Complex in
Athens, Ga., made Gibbs the
15th Stanford woman to win the
collegiate singles championship
and the first since Amber Liu in
2004.

Gibbs defeated Burdette, 2-6,
7-6 (5), 6-3 in a mentally grueling
match in which she was once a set
and three games behind. Gibbs
came back to force a second set
tiebreak, where she fell behind 5-
2 and once again found herself

on the brink of elimination.
In the first set, Burdette was
the more assertive player, as she
came to net successfully and took
control of the match. Ahead 4-1 in
the second set, she looked poised
to run away with the trophy. Bur
dette had not lost more than three
games in a set in the entire tour
nament, and she appeared set on
continuing that dominant streak.
"I had kind of resigned myself
to losing to someone who was
playing by far the best tennis in all
of college tennis," Gibbs said. "At
that point, I was just trying any
thing possible to stay in points."
Gibbs' persistence paid off.
She won three straight games as
Burdette began making unforced
errors and double faulted on a
crucial point. The set evened out
at 4-4, and after trading breaks
they went into a tiebreak.
Burdette again looked poised
to win the match, needing just two
points to clinch after jumping out
to a 5-2 lead. But Gibbs hung on
to win five straight points and
take the set. At that point, ah of
the momentum and confidence
belonged to the sophomore, and
she got an early break on her way
to a 6-3 third-set win.
The teammates would later
share the joy of winning a cham
pionship together, but that would
have to wait. As Gibbs stood on
her side looking at the sky with a
smile, Burdette sat down on her
side of the court and stared off in
disbelief.
Head coach Lele Forood
summed up how it must have felt
for her top two players.
"It's difficult. It's even difficult
for the winner because they are

really excited, but also they feel
bad for their teammate," she said.
Gibbs and Burdette gave each
other time apart to soak up the
emotions from the match, but
there was more work to be done.
"I knew there was no way I
was going to let that singles match
get in the way of us performing
the way I thought we could in
doubles," Burdette said.
Burdette eventually found
Gibbs to tell her how proud she
was and how excited she was for
doubles.
"I told her congratulations,
and I was like 'You can come in
side. I'm fine. I'm not going to
bite. You can come inside and sit
and hang out until we go on the
doubles court,'" Burdette said.
Gibbs certainly appreciated
the gesture, and their hard-fought
battle in singles only seemed to
help their play on the doubles
court.
"She was such a professional
and such a great teammate ...
We were as close as teammates as
we have ever been playing for the
championship match in doubles,"
Gibbs said.
