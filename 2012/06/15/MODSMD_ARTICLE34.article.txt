# CHAMPS AT LAST

NCAA title number 102 made its way to
the Farm this week, but for the undefeated
Stanford women's soccer team, its run at
the College Cup meant much more than
the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin found
midfielder Teresa Noyola waiting at the
back post and Noyola headed in the first
ever goal in a College Cup final for the Car
dinal (25-0-1), the two seniors put a conclu
sively positive stamp on careers that had
been marked by three years of postseason
disappointment.
Women's soccer has been one of the few
national titles that has seemed to just elude
Stanford. Four times in 1993,2008,2009
and 2010 the Cardinal reached the Final
Four only to meet heartbreak. Two years in
a row, eventual Hermann Trophy winners
were silenced in the College Cup final. And
even as the Stanford squad demonstrated
its national relevance year-in and year-out
under head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status given to
perennial champions North Carolina and
Notre Dame.
That all changed Sunday.

"This team deserves it," Noyola said.
"We've worked extremely hard but have
also shown great character to not let the
heartbreaks of the last two seasons catch up
[to us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threateningly
at times in the final, but solid play from the
back line and another perfect performance
from sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliver
between the pipes propelled Stanford to
victory and the first undefeated season in
school history.
"We didn't think about any other game
this year," Levin said. "It was about this
game. We knew we had to come out and
keep possession and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that against
the Blue Devils early on and had several
close misses in the first half. A header from
junior midfielder Mariah Nogueira went
just wide right in the third minute; fresh
man forward Chioma Übogagu nearly
drew a penalty kick with her evasiveness in
the 22nd minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.

Stemming the tide, Duke countered
with chances of its own and nearly snuck
one by Oliver late in the half on a mis
played ball by the Stanford defense. For-

Card's only goal in a 1-0 win over Duke.
ward Molly Lester missed high,
however, and the back-and-forth
match was scoreless entering the
half.
Though the Cardinal was con
trolling the tempo, the match still
had the potential of turning into
another close loss, like the consec
utive 1-0 defeats Stanford had suf
fered in the two previous finals. In
each, the Cardinal's leading scorer
Kelley O'Hara in 2009 and
Christen Press in 2010 was
held to three or fewer shots; on
Sunday, 20-goal-scorer senior for
ward Lindsay Taylor entered the
half with just one attempt.
But this time around, Ratcliffe
wasn't necessarily expecting the
scoring to come from his top of
fensive players.
"[Duke has] a great defense,"
he said. "They're very hard to
break down and score 0n... It
was a very tight match."
"I thought our outside backs
were going to be the difference in
the game," Ratcliffe added later.
"Duke's back four is very solid.
Their three in the midfield are
hard-working players and we
needed to get our outside backs
forward to create a numerical ad
vantage outside and try to get in
crosses."
Indeed, it was Levin and her
fellow outside defender, Rachel
Quon, who would define the sec
ond half. Quon drew a foul to set
up a dangerous Noyola free kick
two minutes into the half, al
though the Cardinal couldn't cap
italize. After a missed Stanford
corner just a minute later, Blue
Devil freshman sensation Kelley
Cobb raced upfield, just one
woman Quon —to beat. But
the junior held her own, and Levin
swooped in from behind the play
to end Cobb's promising rush.
Then Levin made the play that
Stanford soccer fans won't soon
forget. Taking a 53rd-minute feed
from Übogagu to the high right
side of the box, Levin battled by
two defenders as she moved to
wards the end line. Running out of
real estate, she tried to cross to
Noyola who played youth soc
cer with Levin but a Blue Devil
defender blocked the attempt as
Levin slipped to the turf. She
scrambled to get to her feet, fed in
another ball, and the rest is histo
ry-
"You've got to feel sorry for
Duke because that's unstop
pable," Ratcliffe noted. "They
blocked her cross twice and she
still got back up and crossed it to
the back post."
Noyola had already scored
perhaps the biggest goal of the
regular season for the Cardinal,
an overtime header to beat Wash
ington. And on a strikingly similar
play Sunday, she added the
biggest goal in Stanford soccer
history to her resume.

"You don't get that many op
portunities at this stage," Noyola
said. "Camille played a great ball
and that shows how connected we
are. I knew exactly what she was
going to do."
The squad hadn't lost a game
in six years when scoring a goal,
but after Oklahoma State tied up
a similar game in the quarterfinals
and took the Cardinal to sudden
death overtime, Stanford knew it
still had its work cut out for it after
Noyola's tally.
An energized Molly Pathman,
coming off a two-goal perform
ance in the semifinals, re-entered
the game for Duke in the 67th
minute and made an instant im
pact. Taken down in the box just
three minutes later, Pathman
begged for a penalty but was not
given one after Übogagu had
been similarly spurned in the first
half. A minute later, Pathman
found an open Laura Weinberg in
the box but her left-footed deflec
tion sailed high.
The barrage continued into the
73rd minute, when Kaitlyn Kerr
pounced on a loose ball and forced
Oliver to make a leaping save on
her roaring shot from outside the
box. On the ensuing corner, Wein
berg almost found an opening but
had her low strike blocked by
Nogueira. Hanging by a thread, the
Cardinal got the clear it needed.
"It was the longest 20 minutes
of my life," Oliver said, referring to
the end of the game. "Everyone's
hearts were beating out of their
ears."
And they would keep doing so
late into the match. Taylor and
senior midfielder Kristy Zur
muhlen helped burn the clock
with strong plays on the Blue
Devils' side of midfield, yet Duke
fed the ball back into the final
third time and time again. It
looked like they had a shot even
into the 89th minute, when the
Blue Devils drew two corner
kicks.
The Cardinal fended them
both off, the same way it had fend
ed off the heartbreak that's been
building up since 2008, and just
minutes later the team was wear
ing NCAA Champion hats and T
shirts.
"This win caps off four tremen
dous years at Stanford," Ratcliffe
said. "The last four years, this team
has been incredible, and they've
shown such great character to
have all those setbacks and come
back and fight through and
achieve our goal of winning a na
tional championship."
And when the most accom
plished senior class in Stanford soc
cer history Taylor, Noyola,
Levin and Zurmuhlen walked
off the field wearing cardinal and
white for the last time on Sunday,
they did so with more than just a 95-
4-4 career record and four trips to
the College Cup behind them. This
time, they took home a trophy.
And so much more.

NCAA title number 102 made its way to
the Farm this week, but for the undefeated
Stanford women's soccer team, its run at
the College Cup meant much more than
the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin found
midfielder Teresa Noyola waiting at the
back post and Noyola headed in the first
ever goal in a College Cup final for the Car
dinal (25-0-1), the two seniors put a conclu
sively positive stamp on careers that had
been marked by three years of postseason
disappointment.
Women's soccer has been one of the few
national titles that has seemed to just elude
Stanford. Four times in 1993,2008,2009
and 2010 the Cardinal reached the Final
Four only to meet heartbreak. Two years in
a row, eventual Hermann Trophy winners
were silenced in the College Cup final. And
even as the Stanford squad demonstrated
its national relevance year-in and year-out
under head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status given to
perennial champions North Carolina and
Notre Dame.
That all changed Sunday.

"This team deserves it," Noyola said.
"We've worked extremely hard but have
also shown great character to not let the
heartbreaks of the last two seasons catch up
[to us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threateningly
at times in the final, but solid play from the
back line and another perfect performance
from sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliver
between the pipes propelled Stanford to
victory and the first undefeated season in
school history.
"We didn't think about any other game
this year," Levin said. "It was about this
game. We knew we had to come out and
keep possession and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that against
the Blue Devils early on and had several
close misses in the first half. A header from
junior midfielder Mariah Nogueira went
just wide right in the third minute; fresh
man forward Chioma Übogagu nearly
drew a penalty kick with her evasiveness in
the 22nd minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.

Stemming the tide, Duke countered
with chances of its own and nearly snuck
one by Oliver late in the half on a mis
played ball by the Stanford defense. For-

goal in Stanford soccer history Sunday, heading in

Card's only goal in a 1-0 win over Duke.
ward Molly Lester missed high,
however, and the back-and-forth
match was scoreless entering the
half.
Though the Cardinal was con
trolling the tempo, the match still
had the potential of turning into
another close loss, like the consec
utive 1-0 defeats Stanford had suf
fered in the two previous finals. In
each, the Cardinal's leading scorer
Kelley O'Hara in 2009 and
Christen Press in 2010 was
held to three or fewer shots; on
Sunday, 20-goal-scorer senior for
ward Lindsay Taylor entered the
half with just one attempt.
But this time around, Ratcliffe
wasn't necessarily expecting the
scoring to come from his top of
fensive players.
"[Duke has] a great defense,"
he said. "They're very hard to
break down and score 0n... It
was a very tight match."
"I thought our outside backs
were going to be the difference in
the game," Ratcliffe added later.
"Duke's back four is very solid.
Their three in the midfield are
hard-working players and we
needed to get our outside backs
forward to create a numerical ad
vantage outside and try to get in
crosses."
Indeed, it was Levin and her
fellow outside defender, Rachel
Quon, who would define the sec
ond half. Quon drew a foul to set
up a dangerous Noyola free kick
two minutes into the half, al
though the Cardinal couldn't cap
italize. After a missed Stanford
corner just a minute later, Blue
Devil freshman sensation Kelley
Cobb raced upfield, just one
woman Quon —to beat. But
the junior held her own, and Levin
swooped in from behind the play
to end Cobb's promising rush.
Then Levin made the play that
Stanford soccer fans won't soon
forget. Taking a 53rd-minute feed
from Übogagu to the high right
side of the box, Levin battled by
two defenders as she moved to
wards the end line. Running out of
real estate, she tried to cross to
Noyola who played youth soc
cer with Levin but a Blue Devil
defender blocked the attempt as
Levin slipped to the turf. She
scrambled to get to her feet, fed in
another ball, and the rest is histo
ry-
"You've got to feel sorry for
Duke because that's unstop
pable," Ratcliffe noted. "They
blocked her cross twice and she
still got back up and crossed it to
the back post."
Noyola had already scored
perhaps the biggest goal of the
regular season for the Cardinal,
an overtime header to beat Wash
ington. And on a strikingly similar
play Sunday, she added the
biggest goal in Stanford soccer
history to her resume.

"You don't get that many op
portunities at this stage," Noyola
said. "Camille played a great ball
and that shows how connected we
are. I knew exactly what she was
going to do."
The squad hadn't lost a game
in six years when scoring a goal,
but after Oklahoma State tied up
a similar game in the quarterfinals
and took the Cardinal to sudden
death overtime, Stanford knew it
still had its work cut out for it after
Noyola's tally.
An energized Molly Pathman,
coming off a two-goal perform
ance in the semifinals, re-entered
the game for Duke in the 67th
minute and made an instant im
pact. Taken down in the box just
three minutes later, Pathman
begged for a penalty but was not
given one after Übogagu had
been similarly spurned in the first
half. A minute later, Pathman
found an open Laura Weinberg in
the box but her left-footed deflec
tion sailed high.
The barrage continued into the
73rd minute, when Kaitlyn Kerr
pounced on a loose ball and forced
Oliver to make a leaping save on
her roaring shot from outside the
box. On the ensuing corner, Wein
berg almost found an opening but
had her low strike blocked by
Nogueira. Hanging by a thread, the
Cardinal got the clear it needed.
"It was the longest 20 minutes
of my life," Oliver said, referring to
the end of the game. "Everyone's
hearts were beating out of their
ears."
And they would keep doing so
late into the match. Taylor and
senior midfielder Kristy Zur
muhlen helped burn the clock
with strong plays on the Blue
Devils' side of midfield, yet Duke
fed the ball back into the final
third time and time again. It
looked like they had a shot even
into the 89th minute, when the
Blue Devils drew two corner

the game for Duke in the 67th
minute and made an instant im
pact. Taken down in the box just
three minutes later, Pathman
begged for a penalty but was not
given one after Übogagu had
been similarly spurned in the first
half. A minute later, Pathman
found an open Laura Weinberg in
the box but her left-footed deflec
tion sailed high.
The barrage continued into the
73rd minute, when Kaitlyn Kerr
pounced on a loose ball and forced
Oliver to make a leaping save on
her roaring shot from outside the
box. On the ensuing corner, Wein
berg almost found an opening but
had her low strike blocked by
Nogueira. Hanging by a thread, the
Cardinal got the clear it needed.
"It was the longest 20 minutes
of my life," Oliver said, referring to
the end of the game. "Everyone's
hearts were beating out of their
ears."
And they would keep doing so
late into the match. Taylor and
senior midfielder Kristy Zur
muhlen helped burn the clock
with strong plays on the Blue
Devils' side of midfield, yet Duke
fed the ball back into the final
third time and time again. It
looked like they had a shot even
into the 89th minute, when the
Blue Devils drew two corner
kicks.
The Cardinal fended them
both off, the same way it had fend
ed off the heartbreak that's been
building up since 2008, and just
minutes later the team was wear
ing NCAA Champion hats and T
shirts.
"This win caps off four tremen
dous years at Stanford," Ratcliffe
said. "The last four years, this team
has been incredible, and they've
shown such great character to
have all those setbacks and come
back and fight through and
achieve our goal of winning a na
tional championship."
And when the most accom
plished senior class in Stanford soc
cer history Taylor, Noyola,
Levin and Zurmuhlen walked
off the field wearing cardinal and
white for the last time on Sunday,
they did so with more than just a 95-
4-4 career record and four trips to
the College Cup behind them. This
time, they took home a trophy.
And so much more.
