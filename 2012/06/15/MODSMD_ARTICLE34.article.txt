# CHAMPS AT LAST

NCAA title number 102 made its way to
the Farm this week, but for the undefeated
Stanford women's soccer team, its run at
the College Cup meant much more than
the trophy it brought home.
When defender Camille Levin found
midfielder Teresa Noyola waiting at the
back post and Noyola headed in the first
ever goal in a College Cup final for the Car
dinal (25-0-1), the two seniors put a conclu
sively positive stamp on careers that had
been marked by three years of postseason
disappointment.
Women's soccer has been one of the few
national titles that has seemed to just elude
Stanford. Four times in 1993,2008,2009
and 2010 the Cardinal reached the Final
Four only to meet heartbreak. Two years in
a row, eventual Hermann Trophy winners
were silenced in the College Cup final. And
even as the Stanford squad demonstrated
its national relevance year-in and year-out
under head coach Paul Ratcliffe, it could
never attain the dynasty status given to
perennial champions North Carolina and
Notre Dame.
That all changed Sunday.

"This team deserves it," Noyola said.
"We've worked extremely hard but have
also shown great character to not let the
heartbreaks of the last two seasons catch up
[to us]."
Duke (22-4-1) pressured threateningly
at times in the final, but solid play from the
back line and another perfect performance
from sophomore goalkeeper Emily Oliver
between the pipes propelled Stanford to
victory and the first undefeated season in
school history.
"We didn't think about any other game
this year," Levin said. "It was about this
game. We knew we had to come out and
keep possession and play our game."
The Cardinal was doing just that against
the Blue Devils early on and had several
close misses in the first half. A header from
junior midfielder Mariah Nogueira went
just wide right in the third minute; fresh
man forward Chioma Ãœbogagu nearly
drew a penalty kick with her evasiveness in
the 22nd minute, but the referee held on to
his whistle.

Stemming the tide, Duke countered
with chances of its own and nearly snuck
one by Oliver late in the half on a mis
played ball by the Stanford defense. For-

Senior midfielder Teresa Noyola scored the biggest
goal in Stanford soccer history Sunday, heading in
a cross from senior defender Camille Levin for the
Card's only goal in a 1-0 win over Duke.
