## 2012 Pac-12 schedule disappoints

Big Game? Oct.2o.Top-5 ranked
USC visiting the Farm? Before stu
dents are on campus. Once students
are back? Arizona, Washington
State and Oregon State. That's it.
The 2012 football schedule is an
unusual one, due to Pac-12 schedul
ing complications and a vote that did
not go Stanford's way.
Every year, Stanford football
plays the entire Pac-12 North (Cal,
Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
and Washington State) as well as the
California schools in the Pac-12
South (USC and UCLA). The Car
dinal also plays two additional Pac
-12 South teams, on a two-year round
robin cycle (Arizona and Colorado
last year and this year). Stanford has
multi-year obligations with San Jose
State, Notre Dame and Duke, which
put all three on the schedule this
year.
There are several factors that
complicate the Pac-12's schedule.
Some years, the league has 14 weeks
to complete the schedule —deter-
mined by the calendar —other years
allow 15 weeks. The 2011 and 2012
seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league
championship game, these 14 weeks
do not leave much flexibility in the
schedule. The Pac-12's new lucrative
television deals, as well as playing oc
casional Thursday and Friday night
games, further complicate the sched
uling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado
and Utah to the league last year, but
did not affect Stanford much in the
2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 cam
paign with three straight home
games: Sept. 1 against San Jose State,
Sept. 8 against Duke and Sept. 15
against USC. The USC Trojans, with
star quarterback Matt Barkley re
turning for his senior season, have
been predicted to finish as high as
No. 2 in the nation for the 2012 sea
son.
Classes for the 2012 to 2013
school year begin on Sept. 24 for un

dergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with
USC in week three, that's not unusu
al," wrote Pac-12 Vice President of
Public Affairs Kirk Reynolds in an
email to The Daily. "Stanford
opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week
two at UCLA."
Stanford and USC are the only
Pac-12 teams to start conference
play in week three, Washington will
not start Pac-12 play until Sept. 27,
with all other Pac-12 teams begin
ning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week
Sept. 22, followed by a Thursday
night game on Sept. 27 at Washing
ton to face the Huskies and quarter
back Keith Price, whose 477 yard,
seven TD performance in the
Alamo bowl raised some early Heis
man speculation.
The 2012 schedule includes four
Thursday night games, described as
"specialty dates for ESPN and
FOX" in a Pac-12 press release.
Every school that plays a Thursday
night game is required to have a bye
week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first
home game with the student body
on campus on Oct. 6 against the Ari
zona Wildcats and new head coach
Rich Rodriguez's offense before
heading to Notre Dame for the an
nual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.
The Cardinal will then travel
across the Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for
the Big Game before hosting Wash
ington on Oct. 27, traveling to Col
orado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its sea
son on the road against three-time
defending conference champion
Oregon and UCLA, on Nov. 17 and
Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big
Game is older than the Pacific Coast
Conference, the earliest predecessor
of the Pac-12, which was formed in
1915, and has been played 114
times—with the earliest previous
date coming on Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment

with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our first
choice but the conference is gov
erned by the will of the majority and
we have a duty to respect the out
come of the vote," said Stanford's
Director of Athletics Bob Bowlsby
in a press release. "We will work with
California and the Pac-12 Office to
advocate for the Big Game and all ri
valry games to be scheduled toward
the end of the season in future
years."
This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game has
previously been moved to the first
week of December, as was the case
in 2006 and 2007, to avoid conflicts.
However, now that the conference
has expanded to 12 teams and in
cludes a championship game —
scheduled for Nov. 30 —that is no
longer possible,
"The Pac-12 Conference values
the importance of our historic rival
ry games and the importance of
scheduling them in traditional end
of-season dates," said Pac-12 com
missioner Larry Scott in a statement.
"However, with the addition of our
Championship Football Game the
last week of the season, and new tel
evision agreements commencing in
2012, there will be additional priori
ties that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will mean
occasional date adjustments to rival
ry games.
"In this case, we made every ef
fort to create a schedule that would
allow the Big Game to be played at
the end of the season. Cal and Stan
ford were clear that they did not
want to play the Big Game Thanks
giving week so we presented addi
tional options to our member insti
tutions for discussion and a vote. Ul
timately the majority vote deter
mined the schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the con
ference considers initial input from
every member school on dates they
prefer, specific issues, and other re
quests before drafting initial sched-
ules. Several possible schedules are
then put out for discussion before
they are narrowed to three finalists.
The member schools then vote on
the three final proposals.
The three final proposals slotted
the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov. 17
and the Friday after Thanksgiving.
Both Cal and Stanford favored the
Nov. 17 date and lobbied for its ac
ceptance.

"While this version kept the Big
Game on a more traditional Satur
day late in the season, other dates for
conference games were significantly
impacted," said a Cal press release.
"In line with conference policy, the
schedules were put to a vote among
the 12 athletic directors, and the ma
jority vote favored schedule A—
which slots the Stanford-Cal game
on Oct. 20."
The Pac-12 would not elaborate
further on the voting process. Offi
cials from the athletic departments
at Arizona State,UCLA,USC,Utah
and Washington declined to com
ment on the voting process. Officials
from the athletic departments at
Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
could not be reached for comment
by the time of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart
ment source confirmed that the
other Pac-12 presidents voted in
favor of the Oct. 20 date.
Officials from Stanford and Cal
repeatedly pointed to the many Big
Game week traditions held by both
schools and their alumni to reasons
why the Friday after Thanksgiving
date would not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun
dreds, of events on both campuses
that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with

the Mercury News. "With both
schools on break, Thanksgiving
week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule will
still impact many Stanford tradi
tions.
Farm effects
Richard Muschell, Stanford as
sistant athletic director and director
of ticket sales, said his office has re
ceived calls from alumni and season
ticket holders about the Big Game
date.
"People aren't happy about the
break in tradition for Big Game,"
Muschell said. "And that's to be ex
pected. Hell, we weren't happy. We
weren't happy about it either. But
you kind of play with the cards
you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec
tion, which was about 5,000 seats this
past season, will be smaller for the
first three home games when stu
dents are not on campus. Muschell
noted that there will be room for all
students who wish to sit in the Red
Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd have
the entire [home] schedule after the
students got back," Muschell said.
"The students add so much electric
ity to it.That's enormous."
The early home games, lack of an
obvious "road trip" date and early
Big Game could also affect the
Band, according to LSJUMB Public
Relations officer Brian Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band typ
ically uses the NSO football game
followed by a mid-October road trip
to recruit freshmen and new mem
bers. However, there will be no
game during NSO this year, and the
away games between the start of
classes and Thanksgiving Break are
in Colorado and Washington —too
far for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email to

The Daily. "For band, Big Game is
not just a game, but there is an entire
week of events preceding the game.
.. Big Game week is probably the
most important week of the fall for
band, and this earlier date could af
fect some of our traditional e vents."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week of
school in the fall, which allows for six
to seven full weeks of rehearsal and
set-building before three nights of
performances leading up to the Big
Game, In 2012, Gaieties will have a
little over three weeks between the
first day of class and the traditional
first night of performances.

"Because of the earlier date of
Big Game the staff and cast will
have much less time during the fall
quarter to produce the show,"
wrote 2011 Gaieties producer Nora
Martin 'l2 in an email to The Daily.
"Because of the scale and length of
the production, our timeline for hir
ing the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the ma
terial and building the set will have
to be adjusted. While no concrete
decisions have been made, the
show is called Big Game Gaieties
and it is our priority to stay true to
the 100+ year old tradition. I will be
working with next year's producer,
Ram's Head and the University ad
ministration to create an abbreviat
ed schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game against
Cal."
The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected by
the 2012 football schedule. Students,
alumni, season ticket holders and,
most importantly, the players will all
have to adjust to a different schedule
this year. How will the team adjust?
Tune in Sept. 1.

repeatedly pointed to the many Big
Game week traditions held by both
schools and their alumni to reasons
why the Friday after Thanksgiving
date would not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun
dreds, of events on both campuses
that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with

the Mercury News. "With both
schools on break, Thanksgiving
week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule will
still impact many Stanford tradi
tions.

Richard Muschell, Stanford as
sistant athletic director and director
of ticket sales, said his office has re
ceived calls from alumni and season
ticket holders about the Big Game
date.
"People aren't happy about the
break in tradition for Big Game,"
Muschell said. "And that's to be ex
pected. Hell, we weren't happy. We
weren't happy about it either. But
you kind of play with the cards
you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec
tion, which was about 5,000 seats this
past season, will be smaller for the
first three home games when stu
dents are not on campus. Muschell
noted that there will be room for all
students who wish to sit in the Red
Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd have
the entire [home] schedule after the
students got back," Muschell said.
"The students add so much electric
ity to it.That's enormous."
The early home games, lack of an
obvious "road trip" date and early
Big Game could also affect the
Band, according to LSJUMB Public
Relations officer Brian Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band typ
ically uses the NSO football game
followed by a mid-October road trip
to recruit freshmen and new mem
bers. However, there will be no
game during NSO this year, and the
away games between the start of
classes and Thanksgiving Break are
in Colorado and Washington —too
far for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email to

The Daily. "For band, Big Game is
not just a game, but there is an entire
week of events preceding the game.
.. Big Game week is probably the
most important week of the fall for
band, and this earlier date could af
fect some of our traditional e vents."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week of
school in the fall, which allows for six
to seven full weeks of rehearsal and
set-building before three nights of
performances leading up to the Big
Game, In 2012, Gaieties will have a
little over three weeks between the
first day of class and the traditional
first night of performances.

"Because of the earlier date of
Big Game the staff and cast will
have much less time during the fall
quarter to produce the show,"
wrote 2011 Gaieties producer Nora
Martin 'l2 in an email to The Daily.
"Because of the scale and length of
the production, our timeline for hir
ing the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the ma
terial and building the set will have
to be adjusted. While no concrete
decisions have been made, the
show is called Big Game Gaieties
and it is our priority to stay true to
the 100+ year old tradition. I will be
working with next year's producer,
Ram's Head and the University ad
ministration to create an abbreviat
ed schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game against
Cal."
The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected by
the 2012 football schedule. Students,
alumni, season ticket holders and,
most importantly, the players will all
have to adjust to a different schedule
this year. How will the team adjust?

Big Game? Oct.2o.Top-5 ranked
USC visiting the Farm? Before stu
dents are on campus. Once students
are back? Arizona, Washington
State and Oregon State. That's it.
The 2012 football schedule is an
unusual one, due to Pac-12 schedul
ing complications and a vote that did
not go Stanford's way.
Every year, Stanford football
plays the entire Pac-12 North (Cal,
Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
and Washington State) as well as the
California schools in the Pac-12
South (USC and UCLA). The Car
dinal also plays two additional Pac
-12 South teams, on a two-year round
robin cycle (Arizona and Colorado
last year and this year). Stanford has
multi-year obligations with San Jose
State, Notre Dame and Duke, which
put all three on the schedule this
year.
There are several factors that
complicate the Pac-12's schedule.
Some years, the league has 14 weeks
to complete the schedule —deter-
mined by the calendar —other years
allow 15 weeks. The 2011 and 2012
seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league
championship game, these 14 weeks
do not leave much flexibility in the
schedule. The Pac-12's new lucrative
television deals, as well as playing oc
casional Thursday and Friday night
games, further complicate the sched
uling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado
and Utah to the league last year, but
did not affect Stanford much in the
2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 cam
paign with three straight home
games: Sept. 1 against San Jose State,
Sept. 8 against Duke and Sept. 15
against USC. The USC Trojans, with
star quarterback Matt Barkley re
turning for his senior season, have
been predicted to finish as high as
No. 2 in the nation for the 2012 sea
son.
Classes for the 2012 to 2013
school year begin on Sept. 24 for un

dergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with
USC in week three, that's not unusu
al," wrote Pac-12 Vice President of
Public Affairs Kirk Reynolds in an
email to The Daily. "Stanford
opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week
two at UCLA."
Stanford and USC are the only
Pac-12 teams to start conference
play in week three, Washington will
not start Pac-12 play until Sept. 27,
with all other Pac-12 teams begin
ning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week
Sept. 22, followed by a Thursday
night game on Sept. 27 at Washing
ton to face the Huskies and quarter
back Keith Price, whose 477 yard,
seven TD performance in the
Alamo bowl raised some early Heis
man speculation.
The 2012 schedule includes four
Thursday night games, described as
"specialty dates for ESPN and
FOX" in a Pac-12 press release.
Every school that plays a Thursday
night game is required to have a bye
week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first
home game with the student body
on campus on Oct. 6 against the Ari
zona Wildcats and new head coach
Rich Rodriguez's offense before
heading to Notre Dame for the an
nual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.
The Cardinal will then travel
across the Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for
the Big Game before hosting Wash
ington on Oct. 27, traveling to Col
orado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its sea
son on the road against three-time
defending conference champion
Oregon and UCLA, on Nov. 17 and
Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big
Game is older than the Pacific Coast
Conference, the earliest predecessor
of the Pac-12, which was formed in
1915, and has been played 114
times—with the earliest previous
date coming on Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment

with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our first
choice but the conference is gov
erned by the will of the majority and
we have a duty to respect the out
come of the vote," said Stanford's
Director of Athletics Bob Bowlsby
in a press release. "We will work with
California and the Pac-12 Office to
advocate for the Big Game and all ri
valry games to be scheduled toward
the end of the season in future
years."
This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game has
previously been moved to the first
week of December, as was the case
in 2006 and 2007, to avoid conflicts.
However, now that the conference
has expanded to 12 teams and in
cludes a championship game —
scheduled for Nov. 30 —that is no
longer possible,
"The Pac-12 Conference values
the importance of our historic rival
ry games and the importance of
scheduling them in traditional end
of-season dates," said Pac-12 com
missioner Larry Scott in a statement.
"However, with the addition of our
Championship Football Game the
last week of the season, and new tel
evision agreements commencing in
2012, there will be additional priori
ties that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will mean
occasional date adjustments to rival
ry games.
"In this case, we made every ef
fort to create a schedule that would
allow the Big Game to be played at
the end of the season. Cal and Stan
ford were clear that they did not
want to play the Big Game Thanks
giving week so we presented addi
tional options to our member insti
tutions for discussion and a vote. Ul
timately the majority vote deter
mined the schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the con
ference considers initial input from
every member school on dates they
prefer, specific issues, and other re
quests before drafting initial sched-
ules. Several possible schedules are
then put out for discussion before
they are narrowed to three finalists.
The member schools then vote on
the three final proposals.
The three final proposals slotted
the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov. 17
and the Friday after Thanksgiving.
Both Cal and Stanford favored the
Nov. 17 date and lobbied for its ac
ceptance.

"While this version kept the Big
Game on a more traditional Satur
day late in the season, other dates for
conference games were significantly
impacted," said a Cal press release.
"In line with conference policy, the
schedules were put to a vote among
the 12 athletic directors, and the ma
jority vote favored schedule A—
which slots the Stanford-Cal game
on Oct. 20."
The Pac-12 would not elaborate
further on the voting process. Offi
cials from the athletic departments
at Arizona State,UCLA,USC,Utah
and Washington declined to com
ment on the voting process. Officials
from the athletic departments at
Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
could not be reached for comment
by the time of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart
ment source confirmed that the
other Pac-12 presidents voted in
favor of the Oct. 20 date.
Officials from Stanford and Cal
repeatedly pointed to the many Big
Game week traditions held by both
schools and their alumni to reasons

ington on Oct. 27, traveling to Col
orado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its sea
son on the road against three-time
defending conference champion
Oregon and UCLA, on Nov. 17 and
Nov. 24, respectively.

The Big Game
First played in 1892, the Big
Game is older than the Pacific Coast
Conference, the earliest predecessor
of the Pac-12, which was formed in
1915, and has been played 114
times—with the earliest previous
date coming on Nov. 8.
Both Stanford and Cal officials
expressed their disappointment

with the 2012 Big Game date.
"The October 20 date for Big
Game is 2012 is certainly not our first
choice but the conference is gov
erned by the will of the majority and
we have a duty to respect the out
come of the vote," said Stanford's
Director of Athletics Bob Bowlsby
in a press release. "We will work with
California and the Pac-12 Office to
advocate for the Big Game and all ri
valry games to be scheduled toward
the end of the season in future
years."
This will be only the fifth time
that the Big Game has not been
played in November. The game has
previously been moved to the first
week of December, as was the case
in 2006 and 2007, to avoid conflicts.
However, now that the conference
has expanded to 12 teams and in
cludes a championship game —
scheduled for Nov. 30 —that is no
longer possible,
"The Pac-12 Conference values
the importance of our historic rival
ry games and the importance of
scheduling them in traditional end
of-season dates," said Pac-12 com
missioner Larry Scott in a statement.
"However, with the addition of our
Championship Football Game the
last week of the season, and new tel
evision agreements commencing in
2012, there will be additional priori
ties that need to be balanced when
making the schedule that will mean
occasional date adjustments to rival
ry games.
"In this case, we made every ef
fort to create a schedule that would
allow the Big Game to be played at
the end of the season. Cal and Stan
ford were clear that they did not
want to play the Big Game Thanks
giving week so we presented addi
tional options to our member insti
tutions for discussion and a vote. Ul
timately the majority vote deter
mined the schedule."

The majority vote
According to the Pac-12, the con
ference considers initial input from
every member school on dates they
prefer, specific issues, and other re
quests before drafting initial sched-
ules. Several possible schedules are
then put out for discussion before
they are narrowed to three finalists.
The member schools then vote on
the three final proposals.
The three final proposals slotted
the Big Game for Oct. 20, Nov. 17
and the Friday after Thanksgiving.
Both Cal and Stanford favored the
Nov. 17 date and lobbied for its ac
ceptance.

"While this version kept the Big
Game on a more traditional Satur
day late in the season, other dates for
conference games were significantly
impacted," said a Cal press release.
"In line with conference policy, the
schedules were put to a vote among
the 12 athletic directors, and the ma
jority vote favored schedule A—
which slots the Stanford-Cal game
on Oct. 20."
The Pac-12 would not elaborate
further on the voting process. Offi
cials from the athletic departments
at Arizona State,UCLA,USC,Utah
and Washington declined to com
ment on the voting process. Officials
from the athletic departments at
Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Ore
gon State and Washington State
could not be reached for comment
by the time of publication.
A Stanford Athletics Depart
ment source confirmed that the
other Pac-12 presidents voted in
favor of the Oct. 20 date.
Officials from Stanford and Cal
repeatedly pointed to the many Big
Game week traditions held by both
schools and their alumni to reasons
why the Friday after Thanksgiving
date would not work.

"There are dozens, if not hun
dreds, of events on both campuses
that are tied to the Big Game,"
Bowlsby said in an interview with

the Mercury News. "With both
schools on break, Thanksgiving
week won't work."
However, the 2012 schedule will
still impact many Stanford tradi
tions.
Farm effects
Richard Muschell, Stanford as
sistant athletic director and director
of ticket sales, said his office has re
ceived calls from alumni and season
ticket holders about the Big Game
date.
"People aren't happy about the
break in tradition for Big Game,"
Muschell said. "And that's to be ex
pected. Hell, we weren't happy. We
weren't happy about it either. But
you kind of play with the cards
you're dealt."
Muschell said the student sec
tion, which was about 5,000 seats this
past season, will be smaller for the
first three home games when stu
dents are not on campus. Muschell
noted that there will be room for all
students who wish to sit in the Red
Zone.
"If we had our druthers, I'd have
the entire [home] schedule after the
students got back," Muschell said.
"The students add so much electric
ity to it.That's enormous."
The early home games, lack of an
obvious "road trip" date and early
Big Game could also affect the
Band, according to LSJUMB Public
Relations officer Brian Flamm 'l3.
Flamm noted that the Band typ
ically uses the NSO football game
followed by a mid-October road trip
to recruit freshmen and new mem
bers. However, there will be no
game during NSO this year, and the
away games between the start of
classes and Thanksgiving Break are
in Colorado and Washington —too
far for an effective road trip, accord
ing to Flamm.
"The big disadvantage of the
schedule is having Big Game so
early," Flamm wrote in an email to

The Daily. "For band, Big Game is
not just a game, but there is an entire
week of events preceding the game.
.. Big Game week is probably the
most important week of the fall for
band, and this earlier date could af
fect some of our traditional e vents."

The early Big Game will also
present unique challenges to the
production of Gaieties. Gaieties
usually casts during the first week of
school in the fall, which allows for six
to seven full weeks of rehearsal and
set-building before three nights of
performances leading up to the Big
Game, In 2012, Gaieties will have a
little over three weeks between the
first day of class and the traditional
first night of performances.

"Because of the earlier date of
Big Game the staff and cast will
have much less time during the fall
quarter to produce the show,"
wrote 2011 Gaieties producer Nora
Martin 'l2 in an email to The Daily.
"Because of the scale and length of
the production, our timeline for hir
ing the staff, writing the script, cast
ing the show, rehearsing all the ma
terial and building the set will have
to be adjusted. While no concrete
decisions have been made, the
show is called Big Game Gaieties
and it is our priority to stay true to
the 100+ year old tradition. I will be
working with next year's producer,
Ram's Head and the University ad
ministration to create an abbreviat
ed schedule that will still allow the
show to be performed during the
week leading up to our game against
Cal."
The Band and Gaieties are not
the only student groups affected by
the 2012 football schedule. Students,
alumni, season ticket holders and,
most importantly, the players will all
have to adjust to a different schedule
this year. How will the team adjust?
Tune in Sept. 1.

Big Game? Oct.2o.Top-5 ranked
USC visiting the Farm? Before stu
dents are on campus. Once students
are back? Arizona, Washington
State and Oregon State. That's it.
The 2012 football schedule is an
unusual one, due to Pac-12 schedul
ing complications and a vote that did
not go Stanford's way.
Every year, Stanford football
plays the entire Pac-12 North (Cal,
Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
and Washington State) as well as the
California schools in the Pac-12
South (USC and UCLA). The Car
dinal also plays two additional Pac
-12 South teams, on a two-year round
robin cycle (Arizona and Colorado
last year and this year). Stanford has
multi-year obligations with San Jose
State, Notre Dame and Duke, which
put all three on the schedule this
year.
There are several factors that
complicate the Pac-12's schedule.
Some years, the league has 14 weeks
to complete the schedule —deter-
mined by the calendar —other years
allow 15 weeks. The 2011 and 2012
seasons are both "14 week" years.
With a 12-team league and a league
championship game, these 14 weeks
do not leave much flexibility in the
schedule. The Pac-12's new lucrative
television deals, as well as playing oc
casional Thursday and Friday night
games, further complicate the sched
uling process. Many of these factors
arose from the addition of Colorado
and Utah to the league last year, but
did not affect Stanford much in the
2011 season.
Stanford's schedule
Stanford will open its 2012 cam
paign with three straight home
games: Sept. 1 against San Jose State,
Sept. 8 against Duke and Sept. 15
against USC. The USC Trojans, with
star quarterback Matt Barkley re
turning for his senior season, have
been predicted to finish as high as
No. 2 in the nation for the 2012 sea
son.
Classes for the 2012 to 2013
school year begin on Sept. 24 for un

dergraduates.
"As for Stanford starting with
USC in week three, that's not unusu
al," wrote Pac-12 Vice President of
Public Affairs Kirk Reynolds in an
email to The Daily. "Stanford
opened the Pac-12 season this past
season in week three at Arizona and
opened the 2010 schedule in week
two at UCLA."
Stanford and USC are the only
Pac-12 teams to start conference
play in week three, Washington will
not start Pac-12 play until Sept. 27,
with all other Pac-12 teams begin
ning on Sept. 22.
The Cardinal has a bye week
Sept. 22, followed by a Thursday
night game on Sept. 27 at Washing
ton to face the Huskies and quarter
back Keith Price, whose 477 yard,
seven TD performance in the
Alamo bowl raised some early Heis
man speculation.
The 2012 schedule includes four
Thursday night games, described as
"specialty dates for ESPN and
FOX" in a Pac-12 press release.
Every school that plays a Thursday
night game is required to have a bye
week the week before.
Stanford will then play its first
home game with the student body
on campus on Oct. 6 against the Ari
zona Wildcats and new head coach
Rich Rodriguez's offense before
heading to Notre Dame for the an
nual battle with the Fighting Irish on
Oct. 13.
The Cardinal will then travel
across the Bay to Cal on Oct. 20 for
the Big Game before hosting Wash
ington on Oct. 27, traveling to Col
orado on Nov. 3, playing Oregon
State on Nov. 10 and finishing its sea

the 2012 football schedule. Students,
alumni, season ticket holders and,
most importantly, the players will all
have to adjust to a different schedule
this year. How will the team adjust?
Tune in Sept. 1.
