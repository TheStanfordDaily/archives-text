# BOWLSBY LEAVES FOR BIG 12 JOB

On Friday, Stanford Athletic Di
rector Bob Bowlsby was introduced
as the new commissioner of the Big
12 Conference, officially making his
move away from the Farm after six
years at Stanford.
Bowlsby's successful tenure at
Stanford was marked by 10 national
titles as well as the hiring of coaches
Jim Harbaugh, David Shaw and
Johnny Dawkins, but now the lowa
native takes over a conference that
has been in turmoil for the past
three years.
The Big 12 has lost four of its
members in the last two years
Nebraska to the Big Ten, Colorado
to the Pac-12 and Texas A&M and
Missouri to the SEC all of which
led to the firing of former commis
sioner Dan Beebe in 2011. But the
man hired to replace Beebe told re
porters at his introductory press
conference that the Big 12 is in a
good place for the future, as it
added TCU and West Virginia to
the conference this year to replace
recent departures A&M and Mis
souri.
"I, like many people, had a vision
of this conference as unstable,"
Bowlsby said Friday in Irving, Tex.
"What I found instead was a group
of chief executive officers that were
very committed to one another and
very committed to the best princi
ples of intercollegiate athletics. I was
very quickly put at ease relative to
the stability of the group and the on
going commitment to one another."
Bowlsby, who will take over as
commissioner on June 15, was seen
as the ideal candidate for the Big 12
job because of his exceptionally suc
cessful tenures at Stanford and at
the University of lowa, where he
worked from 1991-2005. He also
contributed significantly to the lu
crative media deals of both of those
schools' conferences, particularly
the Pac-12's current $3 billion, 12-
year television contract with ESPN
and Fox. Additionally, Bowlsby was
present for the birth of both of those
conferences' television networks
the Big Ten Network, which
launched in 2007, and the Pac-12
Network, which will launch in Au
gust 2012.
Bowlsby's role in the media net
work expansion of the Big Ten and
Pac-12 was critical to his hiring as
Big 12 commissioner because the
turbulent conference is currently
working on a new television deal of
its own.
"He's been very involved in the
television aspects of conferences he
has served, from the formation of

the Big Ten network to the Pac-12
network and, of course, the related
television agreements," Burns Har
gis, the president of Oklahoma
State, told ESPN. "Obviously that's
a very valuable talent that we intend
to take full advantage of."
Bowlsby's other challenge will
be determining if the conference
needs to expand, as the Big 12's
major quirk is that it currently only
has ten member schools, which pre
vents it from staging a conference
championship game. Conference
championship games generally re
quire 12 teams, and they serve as
major boons to any conference's
pocketbooks; the SEC, ACC, Big
Ten, and Pac-12 all have title games.
However, Bowlsby said he current
ly didn't know where exactly the
conference would go with its mem
bership.
"I'm not going to presume a di
rection that we would go," he said.
"There's nothing magic about 11 or
12.1 come in with no preconceived
notions of what the right number is .
.. I'm pretty excited about the 10 in
stitutions that we have."
And while the move was a no
brainer for Bowlsby, as he will
quickly become one of he most
powerful and influential people in
all of college sports, Stanford is now
forced to try and find a successor to
replace him as athletic director.
For now, the list of candidates
whose names have been mentioned
includes Yale athletic director
Thomas Beckett, Kraft Fight
Hunger Bowl executive director
Gary Cavalli, UC-Irvine athletic di
rector Mike Izzi, West Coast Con
ference Commissioner Jamie Zani
novich, Utah athletic director Chris
Hill and West Virginia athletic direc
tor Oliver Luck, father of former
Stanford quarterback Andrew
Luck. All of these candidates have
major connections to the Farm, as
Beckett, Cavalli, Izzi and Zani
novich have all previously worked
for the Stanford athletic depart
ment.
Additionally, former Secretary
of State and Stanford political sci
ence professor Condoleeza Rice
has been suggested as a potential
wild-card candidate to replace
Bowlsby, as she is a dedicated Stan
ford sports fan and has said that her
dream job would be commissioner
of the NFL.
The athletic department has not
yet suggested a timetable for finding
a new athletic director or intimated
whether it would hire an interim
commissioner when Bowlsby packs
up for the Big 12.
