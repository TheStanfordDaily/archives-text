# Water polo goes back to back

The last time that the Stanford and
USC women's water polo teams met at
Aztec Aquaplex in San Diego, the Trojans
swam away with a 10-9 victory over the
top-seeded Cardinal in the 2010 national
championship game.
But when the two squads met yester
day with another title on the line, No. 1
Stanford wasn't going to let another title
slip away.
The defending-champion Cardinal
(26-2) got a late goal from senior driver
Pallavi Menon and 15 saves from junior
goalie Kate Baldoni to edge the Trojans 6-
4 and capture Stanford's third national
championship in women's water polo and
103 rd overall. Baldoni's 29 saves to just
nine goals allowed over the tournament
won her MVP honors, while Menon
capped her Stanford career with seven
goals over the weekend.
"We definitely have some bad memo
ries from being here two years ago, but
this group, this team has an incredible
spirit about them and this amazing atti
tude," said head coach John Tanner. "They
were relentless today."
Neither squad led by more than a goal
before Menon's bad-angle shot found the
back of the cage with just 1:11 left in the
game. Menon and sophomore driver
Kaley Dodson each had two goals, with
Trojan goalie Flora Bolonyai stifling
Menon on a late breakaway in the first
half.
"We were really frustrated with some
of our missed opportunities," Tanner said.
"We thought Owe could've gotten our
selves a two, three, four-goal cushion, and
we just struggled to stay up by one. But
Kate was absolutely phenomenal, and fi
nally Pallavi with that last goal to give us
some breathing room at a critical time."
Despite the adversity it faced in the fi
nals, the Cardinal's road to Sunday's
showdown was a relatively smooth one.
Stanford opened its weekend with a 17-5
win over No. 8 Pomona-Pitzer on Friday
and a 12-3 victory over fourth-seeded
UC-Irvine in the semifinals on Saturday.

Against the Anteaters, freshman Ash
ley Grossman had a hat trick while
Menon and freshman Cory Dodson each
tacked on two goals of their own, and the
Cardinal held the Anteaters scoreless
over a 12:56 stretch of the first half after
they had taken an early 1-0 lead.
Trailing for the first time in the tourna
ment, the Cardinal grabbed a 7-2 halftime
advantage with a 6-0 run over that same
time period, and the squad was perfect on
its three penalty shots and went 6-for-10
on the power-play to advance to the final.
USC scored 5:12 minutes into the
game to take its only lead, but Menon
struck back with a power-play goal just 33
seconds later. Freshman Kiley Neushul,
the MPSF Newcomer of the Year, added
her third tally of the weekend to grab a 2-
1 advantage for Stanford.
Each team tallied in the final minute of
the first period, but the back-and-forth af
fair gave way to a scoreless second frame
that saw both goalies make key saves and
several Troj an shots bounce safely off the
goal post.
The Trojans drew even a minute into
the second hall) but Kaley Dodson re
sponded with a goal of her own just 10 sec
onds later to grab a 4-3 lead for Stanford.
A minute into the final period USC tied
the game again, and yet again it was Kaley
Dodson who came up in the clutch with a
power-play goal at the 4:13 mark that
would end up being the game-winner.
Then it was up to Menon to seal the
deal in the final minute and a half
"I had taken that lob earlier from five
[meters], and I was pleased with it, so I just
fired it in and really just threw it as hard as
I could," she said. "I saw a little opening,
and I was so happy. I looked back and the
first person I saw was Kate, out to her
waist, so excited. It was great to see that
energy from everybody."

The Cardinal's senior class of Menon,
driver Alyssa Lo, driver Cassie Churnside
and defender Monica Coughlan was in
strumental in setting the tone for the re
peat champions all season long.
"There's so much vitality," Tanner
said. "Usually the seniors are looking at
grad school or their career, and the fresh
men add the energy. Our freshmen did
have a whole lot of energy, believe me, but
our seniors are every bit exuberant, and
that really is uncommon in my experi
ence."
And while the seniors' contributions
were certainly remarkable, Stanford will
likely the odds-on favorite to win a third
straight national championship next sea
son. Along with a strong class of incoming
freshmen, the Cardinal will get back jun
ior Annika Dries and senior Melissa Sei
demann, who both redshirted this season
to in order to train with the U.S. National
Team before this summer's Olympics.
After the game, Menon was asked
how good this team could be in the grad
uating seniors' absence.
"Oh my gosh, unstoppable," she said.
"They're only getting better. I'm so excit
ed to watch this team flourish, there's so
much talent."
Until the 2013 campaign, though, Stan
ford can rest its laurels on the team's third
national title.
"What I'll remember is just the excite
ment that these guys created every work
out, every chance to be around each
other," Tanner said. "We're looking for
ward to the fact that we're not flying home
until tomorrow. We get to spend another
evening together."
And what's even better they get to
spend it with a brand new trophy.

goals over the weekend.
"We definitely have some bad memo
ries from being here two years ago, but
this group, this team has an incredible
spirit about them and this amazing atti
tude," said head coach John Tanner. "They
were relentless today."
Neither squad led by more than a goal
before Menon's bad-angle shot found the
back of the cage with just 1:11 left in the
game. Menon and sophomore driver
Kaley Dodson each had two goals, with
Trojan goalie Flora Bolonyai stifling
Menon on a late breakaway in the first
half.
"We were really frustrated with some
of our missed opportunities," Tanner said.
"We thought Owe could've gotten our
selves a two, three, four-goal cushion, and
we just struggled to stay up by one. But
Kate was absolutely phenomenal, and fi
nally Pallavi with that last goal to give us
some breathing room at a critical time."
Despite the adversity it faced in the fi
nals, the Cardinal's road to Sunday's
showdown was a relatively smooth one.
Stanford opened its weekend with a 17-5
win over No. 8 Pomona-Pitzer on Friday
and a 12-3 victory over fourth-seeded
UC-Irvine in the semifinals on Saturday.

Against the Anteaters, freshman Ash
ley Grossman had a hat trick while
Menon and freshman Cory Dodson each
tacked on two goals of their own, and the
Cardinal held the Anteaters scoreless
over a 12:56 stretch of the first half after
they had taken an early 1-0 lead.
Trailing for the first time in the tourna
ment, the Cardinal grabbed a 7-2 halftime
advantage with a 6-0 run over that same
time period, and the squad was perfect on
its three penalty shots and went 6-for-10
on the power-play to advance to the final.
USC scored 5:12 minutes into the
game to take its only lead, but Menon
struck back with a power-play goal just 33
seconds later. Freshman Kiley Neushul,
the MPSF Newcomer of the Year, added
her third tally of the weekend to grab a 2-
1 advantage for Stanford.
Each team tallied in the final minute of
the first period, but the back-and-forth af
fair gave way to a scoreless second frame
that saw both goalies make key saves and
several Troj an shots bounce safely off the
goal post.
The Trojans drew even a minute into
the second hall) but Kaley Dodson re
sponded with a goal of her own just 10 sec
onds later to grab a 4-3 lead for Stanford.
A minute into the final period USC tied
the game again, and yet again it was Kaley
Dodson who came up in the clutch with a
power-play goal at the 4:13 mark that
would end up being the game-winner.
Then it was up to Menon to seal the
deal in the final minute and a half
"I had taken that lob earlier from five
[meters], and I was pleased with it, so I just
fired it in and really just threw it as hard as
I could," she said. "I saw a little opening,
and I was so happy. I looked back and the
first person I saw was Kate, out to her
waist, so excited. It was great to see that
energy from everybody."

The Cardinal's senior class of Menon,
driver Alyssa Lo, driver Cassie Churnside
and defender Monica Coughlan was in
strumental in setting the tone for the re
peat champions all season long.
"There's so much vitality," Tanner
said. "Usually the seniors are looking at
grad school or their career, and the fresh
men add the energy. Our freshmen did
have a whole lot of energy, believe me, but
our seniors are every bit exuberant, and
that really is uncommon in my experi
ence."
And while the seniors' contributions
were certainly remarkable, Stanford will
likely the odds-on favorite to win a third
straight national championship next sea
son. Along with a strong class of incoming
freshmen, the Cardinal will get back jun
ior Annika Dries and senior Melissa Sei
demann, who both redshirted this season
to in order to train with the U.S. National
Team before this summer's Olympics.
After the game, Menon was asked
how good this team could be in the grad
uating seniors' absence.
"Oh my gosh, unstoppable," she said.
"They're only getting better. I'm so excit
ed to watch this team flourish, there's so
much talent."
Until the 2013 campaign, though, Stan
ford can rest its laurels on the team's third
national title.
"What I'll remember is just the excite
ment that these guys created every work
out, every chance to be around each
other," Tanner said. "We're looking for
ward to the fact that we're not flying home
until tomorrow. We get to spend another
evening together."
And what's even better they get to
spend it with a brand new trophy.
