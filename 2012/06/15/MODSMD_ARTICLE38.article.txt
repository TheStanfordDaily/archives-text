# Day in the life: Bradley Klahn

It's 9:30 a.m. on a cool Thursday morn
ing, and Bradley Klahn is setting out traf
fic cones on a tennis court.
"My serve's been such a rollercoaster
lately," he says, placing 10 cones from left
to right across the service line, five in each
box.
Klahn, the 2010 NCAA men's singles
tennis champion and the number one
player on the Stanford men's tennis team,
is preparing for the upcoming NCAA
championship next week.
His third serve smacks the red cone in
the left service box, knocking it off the
court.
"The problem with the big cones is, if I
hit the top of them, the serve's going out,"
he says.
The senior from Poway, Calif., is used to
balancing his prodigious tennis career and
school, but now, it's all tennis, all the time.
Six feet tall, dressed from head to toe in red
and black dri-fit, the economics major
graduated from school in the winter and
now spends his days preparing for the final
hurrah of his college career and the be
ginning of his budding professional career.
The lefty pulls a serve and smacks a
cone in the wrong service box.
"Aw, that doesn't count."
Now, the only thing on Klahn's sched
ule is to play tennis, practice tennis, work
out and rehab sometimes for 12 hours a
day. Most days, he rises at 6:30 and goes to
bed before 11.
"Without any schoolwork, I go to bed a
lot earlier. Trying to get on a more profes
sional routine, I guess."
He finds his rhythm when he switches
to the other side of the baseline, hitting
three cones in rapid succession.

"Target practice," he says.
This year's NCAA title is in Athens,
Ga., the site of Klahn's 2010 singles win,
where he crushed Louisville's Austin
Childs, 6-1, 6-2, in the final to capture a
championship ring. Those memories
and his memories after from the 2011
NCAA tournament in front of a rowdy
home crowd at Stanford drive him to
wake up and hit ball after ball every morn
ing.
"The [2Oll quarterfinal] match against
Texas A&M was a wild one ... that was
fun. [The semifinal match against] Virginia
was fun, too. Virginia was the most absurd
thing I've ever seen, let alone been a part
of."
"And I can't say I've got bad memories
[about Athens] after winning there," he
adds.
However, if Klahn hopes to add a
championship coda to his days at Stan
ford, he'll have to overcome his two neme
ses this season: USC and a balky back.
The Trojans have won three consecu
tive team titles behind the powerful play of
senior Steve Johnson, last year's NCAA
singles champion, who is riding a 60-match
winning streak coming into the tourna
ment.
"He's been a lock.They're always start
ing 2-0 in every match, or at least 1-0,"
Klahn says. The No. 1 Trojans also cap
tured the Pac-12 title this year and blanked
the Cardinal 7-0,7-0 and 4-0 in their three
matchups this season.
Klahn also still battles the effects of a
herniated disc in his back, an injury that
forced him out of competition for half the
school year and still affects his mobility
and strength, he says. He takes the time to
stretch his back during every pause in his
practice schedule.
"I had the same injury that [Orlando
Magic forward] Dwight Howard has," he

says. "It's just stiff, more than anything else.
The surgical site was painful right after, but
the hardest thing for a while was just get
ting in and out of bed."
After finishing his morning session of
serves, Klahn gets a necessary back mas
sage, eats lunch and returns to the Taube
Tennis Center courts to hit with assistant
coach Brandon Coupe.
A light drizzle forces the two of them
to the underground indoor court the
team refers to as "the dungeon," where
Coupe gives Klahn pointers on his back
hand and volleys. Coupe's strokes are
short and direct when compared to
Klahn's nimble, smooth backhands
Coupe is leathered from 10 years spent
on the professional tennis tour. He gives
Klahn tips that will serve him well when he
moves along to the professional ranks
right after graduation.
Klahn will train in Carson, Calif, a sub
urb of Los Angeles, after his time at Stan
ford is up and could possibly begin playing
in professional events as early as June 2, at
the Sacramento USTA Futures tour event
a step below the ATP tour of Roger
Federer and Rafael Nadal.
"It kind of depends on how I feel de
pending on where my fitness is. But really,
I haven't planned it out too far in ad
vance," he confesses.
The bigger question, he says, comes
down the road, when he'll need sponsors
to help him jumpstart his pro career.
"I haven't had any agent interest so far.
I don't know if people will sign me or not,"
he says. "I'd obviously like to sign with an
agent; it'd be cool, and they can help out
with deals and money and stuff, but I'm
sure any agent is going to have their reser
vations about signing a guy who had back
