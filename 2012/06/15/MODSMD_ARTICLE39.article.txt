# The 						high price of just a free throw

Andy Brown stood at the free-throw line on Jan. 14,
2012, waiting to take two foul shots. Stanford led Col
orado 82-61, and less than a minute remained. These two
free throws wouldn't impact the game. As the 6-foot-7
junior forward stepped to the line and dribbled three
times, he didn't even notice the crowd, the bench or any
thing else around him. All that Brown focused on were
the 15 feet between him and the basket.
Brown's trip to the foul line began well before he
snatched an offensive rebound and was fouled by Col
orado forward Damiene Cain. In fact, his trip to the line
had begun three years before, when Brown was still a
senior in high school.
In high school, Brown was a two-time state champi
on while playing for Southern California powerhouse
Mater Dei. Mater Dei sustained just 10 losses during
Brown's four years, with a few of them coming against
the teams that boasted future NBA stars like Kevin
Love and Jeremy Lin. Brown's high school coach used
to refer to him as "The Iceman" for his ability to handle
pressure late in games.
In January 2009, during Brown's senior year. Mater
Dei was undefeated and the top-ranked high school
basketball team in the nation. In the second half of a ri
valry game against Servite High School, Mater Dei led
by more than 20 points. Brown stole the ball in the open
court and sprinted across the hardwood to hammer in a
breakaway slam dunk.
"When I came down [from the dunk]," Brown said,
"I landed awkwardly and my knee just kind of popped."
At first, Brown thought the pop he heard was only a
sprain. He later learned that he had torn the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee, ending his high school
career. Initially upset that he would miss the rest of his
senior season, Brown quickly refocused for the next
step in his career: playing college basketball for Stan
ford.
After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery in
February 2009, Brown underwent an intense regimen
of physical therapy designed to help him redevelop his
range of motion and strengthen his knee. Eight months
later, Brown returned to the court and began practicing
with Stanford on Oct. 16.
During his first college practice. Brown felt a little
slower than normal, but his left knee felt strong. About
half an hour into practice, Brown soared into the air to
grab a rebound.
"I jumped in off one foot," Brown said. "I landed on
one foot, and my knee popped out again."
Right away, Brown knew he had torn his ACL
again his left knee. After being forced to miss the end of
his last season of high school basketball, Brown would be
forced to miss his entire first season of college basketball.
Yet Brown remained positive in the face of his latest
setback. The injury forced him to medically redshirt,
which allowed him to take a year to figure out college,
both on and off the court.
In order to improve himself as a player, Brown spent
his freshman year getting stronger in the weight room
and learning about the college game from his mentor,
then-senior Landry Fields. Off the court, Brown's injury

to three ACL tears in his left knee, but the 6-foot-7

not only gave him more time to
focus on his studies; it assisted him
socially as well. Brown met other
students via physical therapy, as
well as by virtue of his golf cart, as
students repeatedly asked him for
rides.
While Brown looked at his sec
ond ACL tear as a blessing in dis
guise, he still itched to get back on
the court. He underwent the same
regimen of physical therapy as be
fore, and it took him 10 months to
return to the court.
In August 2010, Brown was
back on the court playing a series
of pick-up games with his team
mates. It was the most basketball
he had played since high school.
During the games, Brown felt like
his old self again, draining six
three-pointers. Toward the end of
the open-court session, Brown and
his teammates were playing a short
game to five when Brown went
down yet again.
"I caught the ball on the left
wing and I dribbled baseline,"
Brown said. "I got cut off and I
went to spin. I planted with my left
foot and my knee gave out again."
The all-too-familiar pop and
shooting pain let Brown know im
mediately that he had torn the
ACL in his left knee for the third
time. According to Dr. Marc
Safran, who conducted Brown's
second and third ACL surgeries,
there is about a 4- to 15-percent
chance that a patient with an ACL
tear will tear the ACL a second
time. According to Safran, Brown
tearing his ACL three times was
"definitely out of the norm."
"That killed me," Brown said.
"It was tough because it wasn't
about my passion for the game
anymore but if my body and my
knee would actually allow me to
play."
For the third time, Brown un
derwent reconstructive knee sur
gery. This time, however, Safran
used a different, older procedure

on Brown's knee. The surgery in
volved tightening Brown's lateral
collateral ligament to provide
more support for his ACL. This
older procedure was the same pro
cedure that Brown's college coach,
Johnny Dawkins, underwent while
he played in the NBA.
After nearly two years of rehab
and physical therapy, Brown was
back to square one. He would only
get one more shot to play college
basketball: a fourth knee injury
wouldn't heal before Brown grad
uated. Brown went back to his old
regimen, but this time he had to
rehab for more than a year.
Having endured three surgeries
and nearly three years of rehab,
Brown finally suited up for the
Cardinal on Nov. 23, 2011. He
logged his first minute of action
that night against Oklahoma State
in Madison Square Garden.
Brown's knee still hurt at that
point, though, so he just stood near
half court and waited for the clock
to run out.
As the season progressed,
Brown's knee continued to heal. On
Jan. 14, he entered his first-ever
home game at Maples Pavilion.
After being fouled while grabbing
an offensive rebound, Brown went
to the foul line, where he'd have the
chance to score his first college point.
Once called The Iceman, a nerv
ous Brown stepped to the line.
He took three dribbles, bent his
rehabilitated knee, rose up and
fired his first in-game shot in years.
As the ball swished through the
hoop, the Maples Pavilion crowd
and Stanford bench lost control,
cheering wildly as they witnessed
Brown's three-year struggle finally
pay off.
"It was an awesome feeling,"
Brown said. "I honestly couldn't
care less about the second one."
Brown missed the second free
throw, but it didn't matter. After
three years at Stanford, Brown had
three surgeries, a knee littered with
dark surgery scars and discol
orations from cortisone shots, and,
finally, one point.

of physical therapy designed to help him redevelop his
range of motion and strengthen his knee. Eight months
later, Brown returned to the court and began practicing
with Stanford on Oct. 16.
During his first college practice. Brown felt a little
slower than normal, but his left knee felt strong. About
half an hour into practice, Brown soared into the air to
grab a rebound.
"I jumped in off one foot," Brown said. "I landed on
one foot, and my knee popped out again."
Right away, Brown knew he had torn his ACL
again his left knee. After being forced to miss the end of
his last season of high school basketball, Brown would be
forced to miss his entire first season of college basketball.
Yet Brown remained positive in the face of his latest
setback. The injury forced him to medically redshirt,
which allowed him to take a year to figure out college,
both on and off the court.
In order to improve himself as a player, Brown spent
his freshman year getting stronger in the weight room
and learning about the college game from his mentor,
then-senior Landry Fields. Off the court, Brown's injury

to three ACL tears in his left knee, but the 6-foot-7

not only gave him more time to
focus on his studies; it assisted him
socially as well. Brown met other
students via physical therapy, as
well as by virtue of his golf cart, as
students repeatedly asked him for
rides.
While Brown looked at his sec
ond ACL tear as a blessing in dis
guise, he still itched to get back on
the court. He underwent the same
regimen of physical therapy as be
fore, and it took him 10 months to
return to the court.
In August 2010, Brown was
back on the court playing a series
of pick-up games with his team
mates. It was the most basketball
he had played since high school.
During the games, Brown felt like
his old self again, draining six
three-pointers. Toward the end of
the open-court session, Brown and
his teammates were playing a short
game to five when Brown went
down yet again.
"I caught the ball on the left
wing and I dribbled baseline,"
Brown said. "I got cut off and I
went to spin. I planted with my left
foot and my knee gave out again."
The all-too-familiar pop and
shooting pain let Brown know im
mediately that he had torn the
ACL in his left knee for the third
time. According to Dr. Marc
Safran, who conducted Brown's
second and third ACL surgeries,
there is about a 4- to 15-percent
chance that a patient with an ACL
tear will tear the ACL a second
time. According to Safran, Brown
tearing his ACL three times was
"definitely out of the norm."
"That killed me," Brown said.
"It was tough because it wasn't
about my passion for the game
anymore but if my body and my
knee would actually allow me to
play."
For the third time, Brown un
derwent reconstructive knee sur
gery. This time, however, Safran
used a different, older procedure

on Brown's knee. The surgery in
volved tightening Brown's lateral
collateral ligament to provide
more support for his ACL. This
older procedure was the same pro
cedure that Brown's college coach,
Johnny Dawkins, underwent while
he played in the NBA.
After nearly two years of rehab
and physical therapy, Brown was
back to square one. He would only
get one more shot to play college
basketball: a fourth knee injury
wouldn't heal before Brown grad
uated. Brown went back to his old
regimen, but this time he had to
rehab for more than a year.
Having endured three surgeries
and nearly three years of rehab,
Brown finally suited up for the
Cardinal on Nov. 23, 2011. He
logged his first minute of action
that night against Oklahoma State
in Madison Square Garden.
Brown's knee still hurt at that
point, though, so he just stood near
half court and waited for the clock
to run out.
As the season progressed,
Brown's knee continued to heal. On
Jan. 14, he entered his first-ever
home game at Maples Pavilion.
After being fouled while grabbing
an offensive rebound, Brown went
to the foul line, where he'd have the
chance to score his first college point.
Once called The Iceman, a nerv
ous Brown stepped to the line.
He took three dribbles, bent his
rehabilitated knee, rose up and
fired his first in-game shot in years.
As the ball swished through the
hoop, the Maples Pavilion crowd
and Stanford bench lost control,
cheering wildly as they witnessed
Brown's three-year struggle finally
pay off.
"It was an awesome feeling,"
Brown said. "I honestly couldn't
care less about the second one."
Brown missed the second free
throw, but it didn't matter. After
three years at Stanford, Brown had
three surgeries, a knee littered with
dark surgery scars and discol
orations from cortisone shots, and,
finally, one point.

Andy Brown stood at the free-throw line on Jan. 14,
2012, waiting to take two foul shots. Stanford led Col
orado 82-61, and less than a minute remained. These two
free throws wouldn't impact the game. As the 6-foot-7
junior forward stepped to the line and dribbled three
times, he didn't even notice the crowd, the bench or any
thing else around him. All that Brown focused on were
the 15 feet between him and the basket.
Brown's trip to the foul line began well before he
snatched an offensive rebound and was fouled by Col
orado forward Damiene Cain. In fact, his trip to the line
had begun three years before, when Brown was still a
senior in high school.
In high school, Brown was a two-time state champi
on while playing for Southern California powerhouse
Mater Dei. Mater Dei sustained just 10 losses during
Brown's four years, with a few of them coming against
the teams that boasted future NBA stars like Kevin
Love and Jeremy Lin. Brown's high school coach used
to refer to him as "The Iceman" for his ability to handle
pressure late in games.
In January 2009, during Brown's senior year. Mater
Dei was undefeated and the top-ranked high school
basketball team in the nation. In the second half of a ri
valry game against Servite High School, Mater Dei led
by more than 20 points. Brown stole the ball in the open
court and sprinted across the hardwood to hammer in a
breakaway slam dunk.
"When I came down [from the dunk]," Brown said,
"I landed awkwardly and my knee just kind of popped."
At first, Brown thought the pop he heard was only a
sprain. He later learned that he had torn the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee, ending his high school
career. Initially upset that he would miss the rest of his
senior season, Brown quickly refocused for the next
step in his career: playing college basketball for Stan
ford.
