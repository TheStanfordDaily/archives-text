Andy Brown stood at the free-throw line on Jan. 14,
2012, waiting to take two foul shots. Stanford led Col
orado 82-61, and less than a minute remained. These two
free throws wouldn't impact the game. As the 6-foot-7
junior forward stepped to the line and dribbled three
times, he didn't even notice the crowd, the bench or any
thing else around him. All that Brown focused on were
the 15 feet between him and the basket.
Brown's trip to the foul line began well before he
snatched an offensive rebound and was fouled by Col
orado forward Damiene Cain. In fact, his trip to the line
had begun three years before, when Brown was still a
senior in high school.
In high school, Brown was a two-time state champi
on while playing for Southern California powerhouse
Mater Dei. Mater Dei sustained just 10 losses during
Brown's four years, with a few of them coming against
the teams that boasted future NBA stars like Kevin
Love and Jeremy Lin. Brown's high school coach used
to refer to him as "The Iceman" for his ability to handle
pressure late in games.
In January 2009, during Brown's senior year. Mater
Dei was undefeated and the top-ranked high school
basketball team in the nation. In the second half of a ri
valry game against Servite High School, Mater Dei led
by more than 20 points. Brown stole the ball in the open
court and sprinted across the hardwood to hammer in a
breakaway slam dunk.
"When I came down [from the dunk]," Brown said,
"I landed awkwardly and my knee just kind of popped."
At first, Brown thought the pop he heard was only a
sprain. He later learned that he had torn the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee, ending his high school
career. Initially upset that he would miss the rest of his
senior season, Brown quickly refocused for the next
step in his career: playing college basketball for Stan
ford.
After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery in
February 2009, Brown underwent an intense regimen
of physical therapy designed to help him redevelop his
range of motion and strengthen his knee. Eight months
later, Brown returned to the court and began practicing
with Stanford on Oct. 16.
During his first college practice. Brown felt a little
slower than normal, but his left knee felt strong. About
half an hour into practice, Brown soared into the air to
grab a rebound.
"I jumped in off one foot," Brown said. "I landed on
one foot, and my knee popped out again."
Right away, Brown knew he had torn his ACL
again his left knee. After being forced to miss the end of
his last season of high school basketball, Brown would be
forced to miss his entire first season of college basketball.
Yet Brown remained positive in the face of his latest
setback. The injury forced him to medically redshirt,
which allowed him to take a year to figure out college,
both on and off the court.
In order to improve himself as a player, Brown spent
his freshman year getting stronger in the weight room
and learning about the college game from his mentor,
then-senior Landry Fields. Off the court, Brown's injury
