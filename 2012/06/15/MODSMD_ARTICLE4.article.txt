Luck and a horseshoe. Some things just go
together perfectly.
After months of waiting, the Indianapolis
Colts finally made Andrew Luck's NFL dream
official on Thursday night, selecting Luck with
the first overall pick in the NFL draft.
While Indianapolis general manager Ryan
Grigson had already announced that the Colts
would select Luck earlier in the week, the Stan
ford star said the moment he?d been anticipat
ing for over two years was still an exciting one.
It was great. It was everything I ever though
it would be, Luck told ESPN. I can?t wait to
start with the Colts.?
Proudly displaying a blue Colts hat and

horseshoe lapel pin, Luck's message to Indi
anapolis fans was to hope for the best and
promised that he would come in and work hard
for his new team.
I feel so honored, so grateful to represent
this city now and be a part of the team, he said.
Luck is the fourth No. 1 overall draft pick to
come out of Stanford, following Bobby Gar
rett, the first pick of the Cleveland Browns in
1954, Jim Plunkett, the Oakland Raiders
choice in 1971, and John Elway, who garnered a
trade to the Denver Broncos after being picked
first by the Baltimore Colts in 1983.
For now, Luck will be tasked with taking
over a team that went 2-14 last year, as well as
replace future Hall of Fame quarterback Pey
ton Manning, who was released by the team
