Luck and a horseshoe. Some things just go
together perfectly.
After months of waiting, the Indianapolis
Colts finally made Andrew Luck's NFL dream
official on Thursday night, selecting Luck with
the first overall pick in the NFL draft.
While Indianapolis general manager Ryan
Grigson had already announced that the Colts
would select Luck earlier in the week, the Stan
ford star said the moment he?d been anticipat
ing for over two years was still an exciting one.
It was great. It was everything I ever though
it would be, Luck told ESPN. I can?t wait to
start with the Colts.?
Proudly displaying a blue Colts hat and

horseshoe lapel pin, Luck's message to Indi
anapolis fans was to hope for the best and
promised that he would come in and work hard
for his new team.
I feel so honored, so grateful to represent
this city now and be a part of the team, he said.
Luck is the fourth No. 1 overall draft pick to
come out of Stanford, following Bobby Gar
rett, the first pick of the Cleveland Browns in
1954, Jim Plunkett, the Oakland Raiders
choice in 1971, and John Elway, who garnered a
trade to the Denver Broncos after being picked
first by the Baltimore Colts in 1983.
For now, Luck will be tasked with taking
over a team that went 2-14 last year, as well as
replace future Hall of Fame quarterback Pey
ton Manning, who was released by the team

after missing the entirety of the
2011-2012 season with a neck in
jury.
I realize you could go crazy try
ing to just measure yourself to Pey
ton Manning every day, Luck told
the Colts official website. I don't
think that would be a sane way to
live ... I'll just try and put my best
foot forward and work hard every
day. One day, if I can be mentioned
alongside Peyton Manning as one
of the quarterback greats, that
would be a football dream come
true.
The redshirt junior quarterback
was the 19th Stanford player to
ever be picked in the first round,
and the first Cardinal player to be
picked in the first round since the
49ers selected offensive tackle
Kwame Harris with the 26th pick
in 2003.
Luck is expected to sign a four
year, $22 million deal with the
Colts later this week, a contract
comparable to that of last year's
number one pick, the Carolina
Panthers? Cam Newton.
After Luck finally put on the

Colts? blue and white, he didn't
have to wait long to see one of his
Cardinal teammates join him in
the NFL, as the Pittsburgh Steelers
selected guard David DeCastro
with the 24th pick.
Pittsburgh general manager
Kevin Colbert said it was a no
brainer pick that late in the draft,
as the tough, physical guard was
expected to be picked in the mid
dle of the first round.
Really, we didn't think David
would be there at [the 24th pick].
We valued him very high, Colbert
told the Steelers' official website.
As we said the other day, there
were a few special players in this
group that we thought would be
easy to evaluate and he was one of
them.
I went into the thing with no ex
pectations, DeCastro said of his
unexpected slide. The draft has so
many variables. You don't know
what's going to happen. I am just
thankful that I am on a great team
and a great franchise. I am just ex
cited.
Luck and DeCastro both going

in the first round marks the first
time since 1982 that two Stanford
players were selected in the first
round since 1982, when the At
lanta Falcons picked tackle Bob
Whitfield with the eighth pick, and
the Browns took fullback Tommy
Vardell with the ninth pick.
But while Luck and DeCastro
now know where they'll be playing
for the next few seasons, fellow
Cardinal teammates Coby Fleener
and Jonathan Martin must wait
until this evening to have their
names called, as the two highly
rated prospects both slipped out of
the trade-filled first round.
While both Fleener and Martin
should go in the first 10 or 15 picks
of the second round, a first round
that could have been filled with
four Stanford players was instead
left curiously devoid of Cardinal,
as several teams reached for
prospects that were far less highly
regarded than either Fleener or
Martin.
