Three up, three down for the Cardi
nal baseball team.
Stanford swept its regional for the
second straight year, beating Fresno
State once and Pepperdine twice at
Sunken Diamond last weekend to stay
in contention for its first national title
since 1988.
It took two come-from-behind
wins over the Waves after junior righty
Mark Appel shut down the Bulldogs
on Friday night, but the Cardinal (41-
16, 18-12 Pac-12) showed why it de
served to host a regional for the first
time in four years with a weekend of
solid play.
"We battled, and at this stage of the
year you have to be able to do that,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
Besides Appel, Stanford's starters
hit some rough spots, but the bullpen
gave up no earned runs in its 9.1 in

nings of work.
The Cardinal did benefit from its
opponents' mistakes a combined
seven errors, 20 walks and eight hit-by
pitches over the three games, including
a three-run wild pitch that proved cru
cial in game two but its best hitters
also showed up on a big stage. Junior
catcher Eric Smith, sophomore first
baseman Brian Ragira, sophomore
second baseman Danny Diekroeger
and junior shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger were all named to the all
regional team, with Ragira reaching
base 10 times in his 14 plate appear
ances.
"I'm just trying to get on, and we
have a bunch of run-producers
throughout the lineup," Ragira said. "I
know that the guys behind me ... are
going to come up big for us."
Stanford's team offense would
have been the story of the weekend
had it not been for Appel's stellar Fri
day night performance.
Fresno State came in as the only

team to have beaten Appel (10-1),
pounding his fastball and getting two
home runs from sophomore center
fielder Aaron Judge when the Bull
dogs met the Cardinal in March. That
wouldn't be the case in the regional
opener.
"We were pretty sure he was going
to come out and make an adjustment
this week," said Bulldog head coach
Mike Badesole. "The kid is fantastic.
He had the answer. He had two great
breaking balls to go to.
"I'm pretty sure he could've won a
big-league game today," Badesole
added.
Appel, the eventual tournament
MVP, tossed his fifth complete game of
the season, striking out 11 and allow
ing only four hits, just three days be
fore his name was called eighth in the
MLB Draft.
"It's difficult for the juniors that are
draftable, and when they tell you
