## Leaders weigh Alternative Review Process 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
Originally published May 1,2012.

The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
will debate whether to approve the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs Alternative Re
view Process (ARP) for cases of sexual
assault, relationship violence and stalk
ing at tonight's meeting. The ARP, insti
tuted in 2010, is facing its two-year re
view and requires approval from the Un
dergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) to continue.
The ARP includes two significant
changes: shifting the standard of proof
from "beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"preponderance of evidence," meaning
jury members must be 51 percent certain
of guilt to convict, and shrinking review
panel juries from six members to four.
These changes have raised concerns that
the current system of convicting based
on a majority is not sufficient, and both
student representatives and alumni have
recommended moving to requiring
unanimous agreement on review panels.
The Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
initiated the ARP as a pilot program in
2010 with the objective of making the ju
dicial process more accessible and less
intimidating for victims of sexual assault.
Its development was partially in re
sponse to OJA data indicating that in the
13 years preceding 2010, there were 104
reports of sexual assault at Stanford, yet
only 16 of those cases were reported to
the Judicial Office and only three went to
hearing. In comparison, statistics from a
two-year study from the National Insti
tute of Justice, cited in the 2011 Dear
Colleague Letter from the Office for
Civil Rights, predicted that over 650 fe
male and 200 male students at Stanford
have been sexually assaulted, a number
far higher than report and trial rates.
"There was concern that the Judicial
Process was a de terrent to victims of sex
ual assault, sexual harassment, dating vi
olence and stalking," Jamie Pontius-
Hogan, assistant dean of the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs, said in an email to The
Daily.
"It surprises me that Stanford stu
dents would want to consent to a change
in the rules that gives them less rights in
a University disciplinary hearing," said
David Barton, who has been a criminal
law attorney for 23 years and has defend
ed Stanford students in judicial proceed

ings. "People... have confidence that
the University will use that power wisely
and that they'll never be on the wrong
side of it. And that's a delusion."
Since the establishment of the ARP,
there have been 21 cases of sexual as
sault reported on campus, 13 transferred
to ARP and 12 tried. Of the 12 hearings
in the past two years, 10 plaintiffs were
found responsible, though one verdict
was reversed in appeal. Pontius-Hogan
said that the OJA has not found a higher
proportion of students responsible since
the burden of proof was lowered to a
preponderance of evidence standard;
she attributed the increase to the success
of the ARP. The burden of proof was
lowered midway through the ARP trial
period.
"Of course they are going to get more
cases if they don't have to have the same
level of certainty," Barton said, "but peo
ple do get falsely accused. If there is a
preponderance of evidence test, people
will be falsely convicted, falsely suspend
ed, falsely expelled. That's the cost of a
system that appears more efficient."

The Dear Colleague Letter
On April 12,2011, six days after he re
ceived a letter from the Office of Civil
Rights, President Hennessy employed
his authority to override the existing Ju
dicial Affairs charter and ASSU Consti
tution both of which protect the rights
of the accused to face their accusers, be
free from double jeopardy and remain
innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt to revise the ARP
and accord it with the federal guidelines.
According to the Office of Judicial
Affairs, Stanford was one of only two or
three universities to still use a burden of
"beyond a reasonable doubt" in cases in
volving sexual assault. Even so, concerns
remain over the ARP guidelines.
"Many of the Stanford sexual assault
cases are cases that are very ambiguous
and involve confusion and alcohol, and
are cases that are very hard to prove be
yond a reasonable doubt standard," Bar
ton said. "Most of the cases that are
charged with sexual assault on campus
end up being rejected by the police and
the district attorney, but they are proper
ly rejected ... because you shouldn't be
imposing either a criminal sanction or an
exclusion from the University unless
there is a reliable way of determining
what occurred."

ASSU Senator Dan Ashton 'l4 also
voiced opposition at the Senate's April
24 meeting to the ARP's protections for
the accused. He noted that only six of the
twelve rights of the accused currently
guaranteed in the ASSU Constitution
are protected by the ARP.
"I feel that you have a right to call wit
nesses and have your witnesses heard,"
Ashton said. "I don't understand why
they would say you are not obligated to
meet with witnesses they want to call.
That doesn't make sense for our legal
system."
Proposed changes to the ARP
Recent Senate meetings have been
dominated by extensive debate about
the Alternative Review Process (ARP)
and its approval. Since the ARP has only
been operating as a pilot program, it
must be approved by both the Senate
and GSC in order to continue.
The first proposed change voiced by
undergraduate senators concerns in
creasing the number of reviewers on a
panel from four back to six. While all
other OJA proceedings have six sitting
re viewers, the ARP has only four.
"If you're going to decrease the pan
elist number from six to four, I think ...
because of that reduction, there should
be an increased level of requirements,"
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 said in support of
a larger panel. "I don't know if having
two more people would really dissuade
people from taking action. I think there
is, at least in my mind, a big difference be
tween having 3-1 and 4-0."
"[We chose four] out of concern for
the comfort of both parties, and extreme
concern for [their] privacy and confiden
tiality," Pontius-Hogan said. "Also, most
people on the board felt strongly that it
should be student centered and having
four we were able to have three students
and one faculty or staff member, which
felt like a good balance."
Disagreement exists within the
Board on Judicial Affairs as to the prop
er size of the review panels.
"Because we're all presumed to be in
nocent, I don't think you should force
any responding student to have to over
come that burden on a 3-1 vote, to force
him on the first round to convince two
out of four people, I don't think that's
fair," said Timothy Lau J.D. 'l2, member
of the Board on Judicial Affairs.
The second proposed change,
which the OJA decided not to en
dorse after extensive discussion, is
requiring a unanimous rather than
majority vote to find a student re
sponsible. According to the OJA,
no other disciplinary process at
Stanford requires a more-than-ma
jority vote, but, as The Daily previ

ously reported, more than twice as
many states require unanimous
agreement for civil cases than re
quire three-quarters agreement.
Law Professor Michele Dauber
said that she thought the language
of those supporting unanimity
seemed to run contrary to the in
tent of the Office of Civil Rights.
"It's been said with a high de
gree of explicitness ... that it looks
like Stanford is trying ... to evade
what the Department of Justice is
trying to accomplish," she said at an
April 18 gathering of student legis
lators.

Dauber and members of the
Office of Judicial Affairs, who said
that the ARP is "data driven," also
oppose the change because they
believe that, coupled with the re
cent changes to accord with the
Dear Colleague Letter, the effects
of policy change cannot be distin
guished if the variables are not
changed incrementally.
"It's not like a typical civil suit
where you are just paying dam
ages, or just like refrained from see
ing someone," Lau said. "When
you get suspended for two/three
years from Stanford ... and you

are labeled ... a perpetrator of
sexual assault by Stanford, it is
something that goes with you for
life. The punishment itself, while
not entirely civil, has a criminal di
mension to it. I think Stanford
ought to be very careful before put
ting something like this on some
one, that we do this process fairly."
GSC representative Sjoerd de
Ridder emailed the GSC list early
Tuesday morning urging UGS and
GSC members to take more time to
weigh the ARP before approving it.
"Agreeing with the ARP as is
basically states it is perfect," de Rid

der wrote.
"Amending it, on the fly, when
approving it, is nonconstructive, be
cause many bodies need to agree
on the ARP. Providing a set of opin
ions is the responsible thing to do, as
it would give the BJA resources and
incentives to carefully review the
document... There is time to raise
issues, because the Faculty Senate
will not take this up till fall, and the
pilot study has been extended till
then."
