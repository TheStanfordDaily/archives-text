## Stanford memes a hit on Facebook

Ralph Nguyen 'l2 started the Stanford Meme Face
book page at 2 a.m. Wednesday. A few hours later, the
page had one hundred "likes." By 5 p.m., 15 hours after
it began, the page had over 1,000 likes and most Stan
ford students' Facebook pages were littered with
friend's reposting and liking the images.
The memes poke fun at various stereotypes and as
pects of Stanford life, often referencing popular inside
jokes or Stanford-specific phenomena. Originally pop
ular primarily on Internet message boards such as
Reddit and 4chan, memes have increasingly leaked
into mainstream social sites, and in recent months have
become more commonplace on Facebook.
While Nguyen has been receiving calls from friends
congratulating him, he said he is more surprised by
calls from potential investors.
"It's kinda like a fucked-up version of a start-up,"
Nguyen said. "Kids are showing their parents, parents
do the whole investment thing, and now they're giving
me calls." University meme pages mark a sig
nificant shift to a hyper-local form of this type of com
edy and satire, narrowing the memes' audience and
often playing on issues much more personal or unique.
This is by no means a Stanford-specific phenome
non-many students at other universities have started
pages in recent days and weeks. Discussions on Reddit
serve as forums for the more sophisticated to complain
about people misusing memes on Facebook pages.
The response to the Stanford meme page has been
overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic. Near the
end of Wednesday, dozens of new memes were being
posted every hour with topics ranging from head foot
ball coach David Shaw ("Has best QB in country: field
goal") to University President John Hennessy ("Rais
es $4.3 billion: announces 3% tuition hike same day.")
Many of the memes sport hundreds of likes and dozens
of shares, the type of social engagement any corpora
tion would drool over.
"I've used the Internet for these types of purposes
for several years now and worked this summer as a
viral consultant, but to take initiative and have your
own stuff blow-up is really liberating," Nguyen said.
Several of the memes play off of potentially offen
sive stereotypes, such as an always-disappointed Asian
father who has trouble understanding English
("CSIO6B teach you C++? Why CSIO6A no teach you
A++?"). While several complaints have been voiced on
the Facebook page, so far responses have mostly been
complimentary.

Many of the memes serve as interesting and unique
insights into aspects of life at Stanford not always vo
calized by students. One student suggested Nguyen
make an account on the popular micro-blogging site
Tumblr to gather all the pictures in the same place
(which they later did), and Nguyen has been contacted
about putting all the pictures on Pinterest, a popular
photo-blogging site.
Nguyen has reached out to several of his internet
savvy friends to help him handle the page. Shane Sav
itsky 'l2 (a Daily staffer) and Kazuma Gunning 'l2 are
helping create memes and set up the Twitter and Tum
blr accounts.
It's been a good year for Nguyen so far. His "Shit
College Freshmen Say" video garnered over one mil-
