# SENIOR REFLECTIONS FROM DAILY EDITORS
## 
### 
KATE ABBOTT
DEPUTY EDITOR, VOL. 239

The world is changing every day,
a fact easy to overlook as we
buried our heads in the library,
studying literature, theorems
and ancient history. My four
years spent at The Daily provided an edu
cation outside of the classroom that I
could never have imagined. I entered col
lege wanting to be a journalist, and found
myself sitting in The Daily's office on
weeknights, meekly asking senior staff
writers for advice on anything but AP
Style.
The changes at The Daily reflect
greater campus changes in the last four
years: we moved buildings, we thought
about website improvement. We
fundraised through special fees, and com
municated more and more via email. But
much like the rest of Stanford, we also
watched countless hours of Sports Ce
nter, drank way too much coffee and had
dance parties until 2 a.m. I learned how to
write better, but I also learned how to
lighten up.
Newspapers may not physically exist
for much longer, but the skills they teach
us can be applied anywhere. If you want to
know how your community is changing,
look at what's happening to your newspa
per, not just what's in it. Most memorable
were the people I encountered while re
porting: through interviews or editing with
young writers at the office. These are the
people who are creating today's headlines
don't overlook them.
The Daily is a great place to learn
about journalism, but it's an even better
place to learn about life.

NATE ADAMS
DEPUTY EDITOR, VOL. 240

As a starry-eyed 17-year-old,
The Daily was a means to an
end: an all-access pass to the
sports and the school I grew
up loving. With equal parts
caution and confidence, I made the brave
descent into our dingy old office on my
very first day of school and submitted my
inaugural women's soccer recap before
turning in my first Stanford problem set. I
looked forward to seeing that first article
in the paper more than almost anything
else about college. But I could never have
guessed that, eight volumes later, The
Daily would also be the one thing I'm
most reluctant to leave behind.
As I once told my parents, it sometimes
felt that the main reason I was located
here in zip code 94305 was not to attend
school oh no but to put out a damn
newspaper every night. Like my friends
whose names you see across this page, I
poured myself into The Daily because it
gave so much back. I flew across the coun
try for women's basketball. I pontificated,
perhaps too much, about Zelda and Mass
Effect. I scrubbed out the static from an
interview with Jack Dorsey. I stumbled
and soared through half a dozen roles at
The Daily, but across all of them, I made
tough decisions and lived with the conse
quences. No class, at any school, can give
you quite that kind of experience.
But what would that be without those
friends I mentioned? I laughed, sang and
danced on tables with plenty of fine peo
ple at The Daily. I survived a car crash
CRASH CREW! and had cheap bot
tles of champagne duct-taped to my
hands. It's been hard work, harder parties
and no regrets. Thanks, Daily.

JACOB JAFFE
DEPUTY EDITOR, VOL. 238

During my four years at The
Daily, I pulled all-nighters
waiting for editing software
to work, got tackled during
flag football, won awards for
having no friends and criticizing people,
got mercilessly teased for being lactose in
tolerant and even got in a car accident that
brought five of us (Crash Crew!) within
feet of serious injury or death.

And damn it if it wasn't the best time of
my life.
When I started as a scared freshman
who hated writing, The Daily was simply a
way for me to appear busy. As time went
on, it became away to keep up with Stan
ford sports, and then away to channel my
hatred of USC (my first ever column), and
then a place to work on something impor
tant, and then a place to have a good time
while working and finally, the most mem
orable and meaningful part of my four
years at Stanford.
From forcing the office to watch Jeop
ardy, Wheel of Fortune and tons of sports
to winning three straight Ink Bowls to
stalling on homework with quiz bowl
questions to actually managing to churn
out five papers a week, The Daily gave me
everything I could have hoped for and
more.
Most of all, The Daily gave me a bunch
of awesomely weird people that could tol
erate my weirdness. And for that, I thank
each and every person that I've worked
with over the past four years. In particular,
thanks to Zach for convincing me to join
and sticking with it all four years as a
friend, coworker and ridiculous nickname
generator. Special thanks also to Wyndam
for helping me get started, Duran for
being hands-down the coolest person on
the Stanford campus (and the main reason
The Daily functions), Ellie for trusting me
with more than just sports scores and
everyone involved with the sports section
for helping it remain far and away the best
section in the paper. Lastly, thanks to my
family and Karl for being so supportive
and loyally reading despite not caring
about the majority of my article topics.
Thanks for being so awesome, Daily.
I'll miss you.

Mathematically, it seems im
possible that the whole can
ever be greater than the
sum of its parts. But, as I
have learned over the past
four years, if anything can actually defy
the odds and do the impossible, it is The
Stanford Daily.
Four years ago, when I stepped foot
into this very building to edit my first arti
cle, I had no idea that The Daily would
ever come to mean more to me than just
another student-run publication or col
lege newspaper. But all it took was one
copy editing stint, one night for me to
enter The Stanford Daily family and
the rest, as they say, is history. I fell in love.
I spent countless late nights scrambling
to finish last-minute stories before pro
duction, fretting over Oxford commas and
praying that a misspelling of something
like President Hennessy's name (don't
worry, it's two e's, two n's, and twos's) had
n't somehow slipped through the cracks
under my watch. But truth be told. The
Daily was the place where I grew up at
Stanford. Beyond the deadlines, projects
and extracurricular activities, the one area
of my Stanford experience that has consis
tently stuck out at me is the friendships I
have made over the past four years and
the ones that have made me a better per
son.
Through those late nights, I met an
amazing group of individuals who have
become my best friends. I traded countless
hours of sleep (and, to my mother's cha
grin, a couple of GPA percentage points)
for invaluable life experiences at The
Daily and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
I learned the value of dedication to the
common cause and what it means to be a
part of something larger than the individ
ual. And as an added bonus (because we
often forget to take ourselves seriously
here), I honed my a cappella skills, com
mitted way too many SNL digital shorts to
memory, learned how to shoot boba balls
at my friends through a straw with deadly
accuracy and refined the art of working
under pressure and on deadline down to a
science. I danced, I cried, I laughed and
had a really, really, really good time.
Words can't express how thankful I am
for my four years at this incredible institu
tion or how much I'll miss this place.
What an honor, what a ride.

Most people will tell you that
I'm a pretty weird guy.
They'll probably tell you
that I'm funny, too. (Or at
least I hope so.) Naturally, I
always thought that having a column in
The Daily would be a great way to show
off my weirdness and humor. It took me
two years to even work up the courage to
apply, but when I finally did, I was gifted
with 750 weekly words of my own in The
Daily for the whole of my junior year. I
managed to produce 26 pieces of writing
that I remain incredibly proud of, but the
job was even more than that. Somewhere
in between making fun of sororities and
telling the whole campus about my love
for Taylor Swift, I realized that The Daily
was a great community filled with even
greater people.
Since that first writing experience, my
work has become a little more diversified.
Over the past year, I've been a copy editor
and managing editor of opinions. I even
gave last summer to The Daily, trying to
convince businesses to buy some ads. I've
had a range of experiences that I wouldn't
have thought possible a few years ago. So
while my activities at the Daily lately have
drifted away from humor writing and
more toward wondering whether "start
up" requires a hyphen, I wouldn't change
a thing.
In addition, I have to thank my parents,
my family and my friends for their support
over these past four years. Stanford has
been a dream come true, and I couldn't
have done it by myself. It's been a great
ride.

ANNA SCHUESSLER
CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER,
2011-12

As this year's business manag
er and a former writer for
The Daily with an especially
brief career, I'm aware that a
reflection on my time at The
Daily has to be less of a careful considera
tion of the many memories I've had here,
and more of a rumination on taking the
yearlong dive into an organization I re
mained blissfully ignorant of for much of
my undergraduate career. Despite my sta
tus as an outsider to this organization a
year ago, I've found it very difficult to re
sist a full submersion into the ebbs and
flows of the witty, quirky bunch that fills
The Daily's offices every day and night.
These are the individuals who are capable
of ruffling feathers with their writing. They
are responsible for closing deals with ad
vertising clients who use our paper as a
means for near-perfect offspring. They are
also the students, account executives, edi
tors and friends who make the production
of a daily newspaper possible. In my expe
rience, these are pre-professionals who
take their jobs more seriously than many
professionals do. So much so that several
professionals take The Daily seriously in
return, pouring hours into the daily distri
bution, layout, accounting and guidance
for a community that provides a service
much bigger than any individual. I can
safely say I was unaware of 99 percent of
this when I started as business manager
last summer. But lifting the lid of this pot
to find a messy, colorful, ambitious and
amazingly dedicated concoction has been
more than rewarding.

SAM SVOBODA
VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES,
2011-12

I joined the Daily way back in the fall
of 2007, writing my first sports col
umn just a few weeks after NSO. It
was the first student group that I
joined at Stanford, and now, nearly
five years later, it will be the final student
group that I participate in. I've held a vari
ety of jobs in that timeframe, from sports
writer/editor to staff development to my
current position as advertising manager.
These jobs have been much more than just

a source of income: I've improved skills
varying from writing to personnel man
agement, learned a ton about journalism
and gained a deep respect for the work
that goes into putting out a paper, and for
the people that put in that work.
But apart from those official titles that
I held, what I'll really remember are the
unofficial ones. Daily Churro Chef (on the
nights that I along with our layout
manager, Duran would make churros
for the office while blasting soul music).
Crash Crew Survivor (long story). One
half of an off-key but energetic office
singing duo. The list goes on and on, and as
much as I'd like to fill this space with in
side jokes and references, I'll stop there
for brevity's sake.
None of these "positions" will go on my
resume, but they've been the things that
have defined my experience at the Daily.
Being a part of the Daily community has
easily been one of the best and most re
warding parts of my longer-than-usual
time at Stanford. And even though I'm
about to leave the actual office behind
with the amount of friends the Daily com
munity has given me, I know it will contin
ue to be a large part of my life well into the
future.

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
EDITOR IN CHIEF, VOL. 239

Of all the deadlines I've faced
in four years on the Farm,
this one has been the hard
est to meet. Articulating my
appreciation for The Daily is
impossible, I joined initially as away to
rationalize my love for sports. The fact of
the matter was that I didn't know what I
wanted from this school.There seemed to
be so much to offer, but the breadth of
choices only complicated matters. Conse
quentially, I thought finding myself
would be a complex process full of dead
ends and dramatic turns. It was, but The
Daily was the one constant along the way.
I knew from the beginning that I want
ed to use my words to further myself aca
demically and professionally. I learned
quickly that this was easier said than done.
Here in Silicon Valley, it's often hard to
recognize brilliance as an entity that exists
outside of engineering. The art of written
communication in this landscape is under
appreciated, with the vast majority of the
attention being focused on tremendous
technological achievement. This harsh re
alization was tough to swallow. There were
times during my undergraduate career
when I felt unskilled for the rapidly evolv
ing workforce, my abilities as a writer
overshadowed by my shortcomings as a
programmer.
But I kept doing what I loved, even
though I needed all the support I received
to stay grounded. I'm humbled to be grad
uating with this group of seniors, as they
have been and will forever be a refreshing
reminder that all is not hopeless. This col
lection of diverse students are among the
most intelligent, funny and thoughtful
people I have ever met, and I cannot
begin to count the ways I have learned
from each and every one of them. Devel
oping as writers, reporters and editors has
been a fantastic journey, and I can only
hope that it means as much to them as it
does to me.
I'm also grateful for everyone I have
worked with, especially the amazing crew
that was assembled during my volume as
editor in chief. The obstacles we were able
to overcome as a group of young adults
showcased the power of motivated youth.
And although I now understand that lis
tening to mashups and subpar jokes for six
hours each night is probably not the aver
age person's paradise, they put up with me
long enough to make Volume 239 a price
less six-month period.
I came into the world of newspapers
naive, anxious and inexperienced. I'm
leaving as a proud journalist, still naive
and anxious, but with an immeasurable
amount of positive experience that will
make the real world a little less daunting.
The Stanford Daily has been my home
away from home during the most impor
tant time of my life. My days spent here
will never be forgotten.
