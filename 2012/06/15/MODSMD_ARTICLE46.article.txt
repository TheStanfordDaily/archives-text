## Frost fills for Modest Mouse in concert

Modest Mouse headlined the
Frost Revival Music and Arts Fes
tival on Saturday afternoon at the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater,
marking the first time the venue
had been used for this large of an
event since the 1980s.
The festival was planned by
the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) and featured musical per
formances by Modest Mouse,
Eyes Lips Eyes and Benjamin
Francis Leftwich. In addition to
the musical performers, Frost
Amphitheater also housed nu
merous large-scale student art
projects.
According to SCN co-director
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, organizers
sold 4,500 tickets in presale. The
amphitheater has a capacity of
5,400.
Katie Chabolla, SCN's finan
cial officer, confirmed there was a
profit from ticket sales.
"All profits will go into a fund
for next year's festival," she said.
Frost was open not only to
Stanford students and affiliates,
but also the general public.
"The crowd that the musical
artists drew is really fun," Eliza
beth Matus 'l4 said at the show.
"Lots of people from the city
showed up, and I really don't feel
like I'm at school at all."
Attendees came not just for
the music, but the atmosphere, as
well. Frost is a renowned venue
that has had an illustrious history

of visiting artists, and its revival
was long anticipated.
"I had never heard of the first
two artists but I was still really ex
cited to come enjoy them," said
Emily Kizzia, 'l2. "I would have
come for any artist. I really came
for the incredible vibes."
For most students, Frost had
been mostly forgotten, as very
few events are held there and
none come close to filling its huge
capacity.
"The biggest event I've been to
at Frost before this was senior
wine tasting," Kizzia said. "That's
how I realized how incredible this
event was going to be. I didn't real
ly know it was there before. And
the fact that you can't see any part
of campus from inside makes me
really feel like I'm not on campus."
During the past two New Stu
dent Orientations (NSO), Gram
my Award-winning bassist Victor
Wooten has entertained new stu
dents in concerts at Frost.
"I feel like I got introduced to
Frost right away because of the
Victor Wooten concert during
NSO," Matus said. "It was so se
cluded yet open at the same time,
and I thought, 'What is this place?
It's absolutely beautiful: I was
also excited because I had heard
they were giving out these art
grants so that students could
showcase their art."
Attendees were greeted at the
gate by a 15-foot high octopus
made entirely of bamboo that
protruded from the ground. As
guests made their way around the
outer perimeter of Frost, they en

countered forests of head-high
mushrooms, tie-dye banners filled
with poetry and a wall of clocks
called "the Wishing Wall."
"Every five minutes, one of the
clocks on the Wishing Wall strikes
11:11, and you are supposed to
make a wish," said Tina Miller 'l4,
the student who spearheaded the
Wishing Wall project. "The idea
behind the wishing wall started
with Japanese Omamori prayer
lines, but instead of praying to a
god, the Frost wishing wall was
just away to share your wish with
the community. Guests are meant
to make a wish and take a wish."
As attendees exited, 18-foot

high neon Truffula Trees with me
chanically rotating feather palm
heads stood along the pathway,
accompanied by a sign that ex
plained they were a tribute to Dr.
Seuss' story "The Lorax," whose
protagonist speaks for trees af
fected by pollution at a nearby
factory. At the base of the trees in
Frost there was a basket of seeds
with a sign instructing guests to
plant the seed on their way out.
The student art projects were
funded through grants distrib
uted by Aroeste. Beginning three
weeks before spring break, SCN
began distributing flyers around
campus for art project proposals.

Soon after spring break, the
group had narrowed their choic
es.
"For a while, a lot of the art
projects seemed impossibly
daunting, but we were able to pull
them all together with a lot of
help from our volunteers, and
they all turned out great,"
Aroeste said.
SCN is already planning the
next Frost Festival.
"We are working to make
Frost even bigger and better for
next year," Chabolla said.

the music, but the atmosphere, as
well. Frost is a renowned venue
that has had an illustrious history

of visiting artists, and its revival
was long anticipated.
"I had never heard of the first
two artists but I was still really ex
cited to come enjoy them," said
Emily Kizzia, 'l2. "I would have
come for any artist. I really came
for the incredible vibes."
For most students, Frost had
been mostly forgotten, as very
few events are held there and
none come close to filling its huge
capacity.
"The biggest event I've been to
at Frost before this was senior
wine tasting," Kizzia said. "That's
how I realized how incredible this
event was going to be. I didn't real
ly know it was there before. And
the fact that you can't see any part
of campus from inside makes me
really feel like I'm not on campus."
During the past two New Stu
dent Orientations (NSO), Gram
my Award-winning bassist Victor
Wooten has entertained new stu
dents in concerts at Frost.
"I feel like I got introduced to
Frost right away because of the
Victor Wooten concert during
NSO," Matus said. "It was so se
cluded yet open at the same time,
and I thought, 'What is this place?
It's absolutely beautiful: I was
also excited because I had heard
they were giving out these art
grants so that students could
showcase their art."
Attendees were greeted at the
gate by a 15-foot high octopus
made entirely of bamboo that
protruded from the ground. As
guests made their way around the
outer perimeter of Frost, they en

countered forests of head-high
mushrooms, tie-dye banners filled
with poetry and a wall of clocks
called "the Wishing Wall."
"Every five minutes, one of the
clocks on the Wishing Wall strikes
11:11, and you are supposed to
make a wish," said Tina Miller 'l4,
the student who spearheaded the
Wishing Wall project. "The idea
behind the wishing wall started
with Japanese Omamori prayer
lines, but instead of praying to a
god, the Frost wishing wall was
just away to share your wish with
the community. Guests are meant
to make a wish and take a wish."
As attendees exited, 18-foot

high neon Truffula Trees with me
chanically rotating feather palm
heads stood along the pathway,
accompanied by a sign that ex
plained they were a tribute to Dr.
Seuss' story "The Lorax," whose
protagonist speaks for trees af
fected by pollution at a nearby
factory. At the base of the trees in
Frost there was a basket of seeds
with a sign instructing guests to
plant the seed on their way out.
The student art projects were
funded through grants distrib
uted by Aroeste. Beginning three
weeks before spring break, SCN
began distributing flyers around
campus for art project proposals.

Soon after spring break, the
group had narrowed their choic
es.
"For a while, a lot of the art
projects seemed impossibly
daunting, but we were able to pull
them all together with a lot of
help from our volunteers, and
they all turned out great,"
Aroeste said.
SCN is already planning the
next Frost Festival.
"We are working to make
Frost even bigger and better for
next year," Chabolla said.

Frost Revival, sponsored by the Stanford Concert Network, aimed to bring large-scale concerts back to Frost
Amphitheater. The event, with nearly 5,000 attendees, was the first of its size for Frost since the 1980s.
Originally published May 21,
2012.
Modest Mouse headlined the
Frost Revival Music and Arts Fes
tival on Saturday afternoon at the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater,
marking the first time the venue
had been used for this large of an
event since the 1980s.
The festival was planned by
the Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) and featured musical per
formances by Modest Mouse,
Eyes Lips Eyes and Benjamin
Francis Leftwich. In addition to
the musical performers, Frost
Amphitheater also housed nu
merous large-scale student art
projects.
According to SCN co-director
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, organizers
sold 4,500 tickets in presale. The
amphitheater has a capacity of
5,400.
Katie Chabolla, SCN's finan
cial officer, confirmed there was a
profit from ticket sales.
"All profits will go into a fund
for next year's festival," she said.
Frost was open not only to
Stanford students and affiliates,
but also the general public.
"The crowd that the musical
artists drew is really fun," Eliza
beth Matus 'l4 said at the show.
"Lots of people from the city
showed up, and I really don't feel
like I'm at school at all."

the music, but the atmosphere, as
well. Frost is a renowned venue
