## Stanford officials reflect on NYC negotiations 
### CAROLINE CHEN 
This piece, originally published January 30,
2012, was the first in a series of articles by The
Daily News Staff exploring Stanford's bid
and subsequent withdrawal from the compe
tition for an applied sciences and engineering
campus in New York City.
Stanford withdrew its bid for a New York
applied sciences and engineering campus
because the city repeatedly revised the terms
of its offer and could not be trusted as a reli
able partner, said Stanford administrators,
responding to media reports that Stanford
was not adequately prepared for the tough
negotiation style of New York officials.
Stanford's sudden withdrawal on Dec. 16
surprised many, as the University was con
sidered a frontrunner in the competition.
The University press release announced that
Stanford had decided, "it would not be in the
best interests of the University to continue
to pursue the opportunity," but did not pro
vide any details or explanation.
Cornell, Stanford's main competitor and
the ultimate competition winner, announced
a $350 million gift hours after Stanford's
withdrawal, prompting speculations that
Stanford had pulled out after hearing about
Cornell's donation in advance, an allegation
that Stanford administrators have denied.
Meanwhile, The New York Times report
ed that "the University, with no experience
building in New York, recoiled at meeting
terms laid down by the city after its proposal
was submitted, while Cornell, with extensive
experience in the city its medical school is
in Manhattan expected such negotia
tions."The New York Times quoted a city of
ficial as saying, "Stanford could not or would
not keep up."
Up until now, Stanford officials have not
spoken publicly about specific details of the
failed negotiations.
Last Thursday, President John Hennessy
discussed his decision with the Faculty Sen
ate. "The city made a set of requirements
which from our perspective, would increase
the risk and cost, and decrease some of the
long term benefits," he said. "While we be
lieved we could win the proposal, it would
require us to make concessions which would
reduce future opportunities for the core
campus ... and compromise the university
campus."
Officials at both the New York Mayor's
office and the New York City Economic De

velopment Corporation refused to comment
on the negotiation process and whether they
had played a "bait and switch" game with
Stanford.
"All schools were competing on the same
terms and all of the terms were outlined
specifically in the RFP (Request for Propos
al). It's that simple," said one city official,
who asked to remain anonymous and de
clined to comment further.
"Nothing about the RFP was firm," said
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin. "The
city was making changes to all of the terms of
the project."
For instance, Lapin said that the city re
quired Stanford to proceed with the project
even if the city revoked the $lOO million it
promised to the competition winner.
"There were issues about liability for ...
the environmental risks involved in the site,"
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 told The
Daily. "They wanted us to indemnify them
for anything they had done, anything that
had happened. So for example, if somebody
sued about exposure to chemicals 20 years
ago, we would have been liable; and that's an
example."
Flennessy added that the city also back
tracked on the amount of land they had
promised. Originally, Stanford believed they
would be granted land from shore to shore
on Roosevelt Island. But New York cut back
the land offer, which meant that Stanford
would have to pay to buy additional land if
they wanted to build the campus for which
they originally planned.
Finally, Hennessy said Stanford could not
see eye to eye with the city on how quickly
the campus could scale up.
"We would not compromise our faculty
hiring standards," Hennessy said. "Particu
larly when many faculty already believe they
live in Nirvana ... [that] increased some of
the issues for us in terms of how to scale up."
Hennessy and the faculty committee re
sisted the city's push to ramp up quickly.
"This needs to be one university, two cam
puses, not an A campus and a B campus,"
Hennessy said. "Clearly, a smaller campus
but it can't be different quality-wise. And that
I think was a real point of differentiation be
tween Stanford and what the city wanted."
Besides the changing terms of the RFP, it
seems that Stanford was turned off by the
tone of the negotiations, which led the Uni
versity to feel that it could not work success
fully with the city.
"I think Stanford wanted very much to do

this, if we had a willing partner in New York
City," said Jim Plummer, dean of the School
of Engineering. "I think that it became clear
as we went through the negotiations that it
was more of a city talking to a land develop
er kind of discussion, rather than a partner
talking to a partner."
All together, these aspects made Stan
ford feel that success could not be guaran
teed.
"If we could not succeed in achieving
everything that NYC wanted, then we would
have had a campus 3,000 miles away that
would end up being an albatross around our
neck," Etchemendy said.
In New York, Roosevelt Islanders said
they were shocked to hear that Stanford was
withdrawing.
"Everybody was completely stunned be
yond imagination; the news flew through the
community like wildfire," said Denise Shull,
a common councilor on Roosevelt Island's
Residents Association Silicon Island Sub
committee.

Schull said she was disappointed that
Stanford dropped their bid.
"From my perspective ... the island was
much more in support of Stanford. They just
have a fabulous reputation. There's just no
two ways about it," she said.
On the other hand, residents have also
welcomed Cornell enthusiastically.
"In reflection, now that Cornell is going
to be here, New York is going to be able to do
it's own thing, rather that be a satellite to Sil
icon Valley," said Jonathan Kalkin, former
director of the Roosevelt Island Operating
Corporation.
At the end of the day, Stanford maintains
that the bid was worthwhile, even though the
proposal cost the University $3 million.
"The saying 'nothing ventured, nothing
gained' is most apt," read the University
press release at the time of Stanford's with
drawal.

Stanford withdrew its proposal for a New York campus on Dec. 16. In reflecting on the negotiation
process within the competition for the applied sciences campus, Stanford officials
said that the city repeatedly revised the terms of its offer, making an agreement untenable.
This piece, originally published January 30,
2012, was the first in a series of articles by The
Daily News Staff exploring Stanford's bid
and subsequent withdrawal from the compe
tition for an applied sciences and engineering
campus in New York City.
Stanford withdrew its bid for a New York
applied sciences and engineering campus
because the city repeatedly revised the terms
of its offer and could not be trusted as a reli
able partner, said Stanford administrators,
responding to media reports that Stanford
was not adequately prepared for the tough
negotiation style of New York officials.
Stanford's sudden withdrawal on Dec. 16
surprised many, as the University was con
sidered a frontrunner in the competition.
The University press release announced that
Stanford had decided, "it would not be in the
best interests of the University to continue
to pursue the opportunity," but did not pro
vide any details or explanation.
Cornell, Stanford's main competitor and
the ultimate competition winner, announced
a $350 million gift hours after Stanford's
withdrawal, prompting speculations that
Stanford had pulled out after hearing about
Cornell's donation in advance, an allegation
that Stanford administrators have denied.
Meanwhile, The New York Times report
ed that "the University, with no experience
building in New York, recoiled at meeting
terms laid down by the city after its proposal
was submitted, while Cornell, with extensive
experience in the city its medical school is
in Manhattan expected such negotia
tions."The New York Times quoted a city of
ficial as saying, "Stanford could not or would
not keep up."
Up until now, Stanford officials have not
spoken publicly about specific details of the
failed negotiations.
Last Thursday, President John Hennessy
discussed his decision with the Faculty Sen
ate. "The city made a set of requirements
which from our perspective, would increase
the risk and cost, and decrease some of the
long term benefits," he said. "While we be
lieved we could win the proposal, it would
require us to make concessions which would
reduce future opportunities for the core
campus ... and compromise the university
campus."
Officials at both the New York Mayor's
office and the New York City Economic De

velopment Corporation refused to comment
on the negotiation process and whether they
had played a "bait and switch" game with
Stanford.
"All schools were competing on the same
terms and all of the terms were outlined
specifically in the RFP (Request for Propos
al). It's that simple," said one city official,
who asked to remain anonymous and de
clined to comment further.
"Nothing about the RFP was firm," said
University spokesperson Lisa Lapin. "The
city was making changes to all of the terms of
the project."
For instance, Lapin said that the city re
quired Stanford to proceed with the project
even if the city revoked the $lOO million it
promised to the competition winner.
"There were issues about liability for ...
the environmental risks involved in the site,"
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 told The
Daily. "They wanted us to indemnify them
for anything they had done, anything that
had happened. So for example, if somebody
sued about exposure to chemicals 20 years
ago, we would have been liable; and that's an
example."
Flennessy added that the city also back
tracked on the amount of land they had
promised. Originally, Stanford believed they
would be granted land from shore to shore
on Roosevelt Island. But New York cut back
the land offer, which meant that Stanford
would have to pay to buy additional land if
they wanted to build the campus for which
they originally planned.
Finally, Hennessy said Stanford could not
see eye to eye with the city on how quickly
the campus could scale up.
"We would not compromise our faculty
hiring standards," Hennessy said. "Particu
larly when many faculty already believe they
live in Nirvana ... [that] increased some of
the issues for us in terms of how to scale up."
Hennessy and the faculty committee re
sisted the city's push to ramp up quickly.
"This needs to be one university, two cam
puses, not an A campus and a B campus,"
Hennessy said. "Clearly, a smaller campus
but it can't be different quality-wise. And that
I think was a real point of differentiation be
tween Stanford and what the city wanted."
Besides the changing terms of the RFP, it
seems that Stanford was turned off by the
tone of the negotiations, which led the Uni
versity to feel that it could not work success
fully with the city.
"I think Stanford wanted very much to do

this, if we had a willing partner in New York
City," said Jim Plummer, dean of the School
of Engineering. "I think that it became clear
as we went through the negotiations that it
was more of a city talking to a land develop
er kind of discussion, rather than a partner
talking to a partner."
All together, these aspects made Stan
ford feel that success could not be guaran
teed.
"If we could not succeed in achieving
everything that NYC wanted, then we would
have had a campus 3,000 miles away that
would end up being an albatross around our
neck," Etchemendy said.
In New York, Roosevelt Islanders said
they were shocked to hear that Stanford was
withdrawing.
"Everybody was completely stunned be
yond imagination; the news flew through the
community like wildfire," said Denise Shull,
a common councilor on Roosevelt Island's
Residents Association Silicon Island Sub
committee.

Schull said she was disappointed that
Stanford dropped their bid.
"From my perspective ... the island was
much more in support of Stanford. They just
have a fabulous reputation. There's just no
two ways about it," she said.
On the other hand, residents have also
welcomed Cornell enthusiastically.
"In reflection, now that Cornell is going
to be here, New York is going to be able to do
it's own thing, rather that be a satellite to Sil
icon Valley," said Jonathan Kalkin, former
director of the Roosevelt Island Operating
Corporation.
