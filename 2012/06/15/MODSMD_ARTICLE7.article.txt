# OPINIONS
## EDITOR'S FAREWELL On the place I called home 
### Sincerely, MARGARET RAWSON President Editor in Chief, Vol. CCXLI 
First, please read what I have
to say here only after you're
forced, having already ex
amined the rest of this hefty Daily
Commencement issue. The pages
you are holding are a testament to
the talent and dedication of my
peers, coworkers and friends. The
articles selected from this year's
work are just a glimpse of the val
ues of The Daily as an institution
and the characters of the students
who make it happen: independent,
always questioning, collaborative,
inspired and sometimes fueled by a
bit too much caffeine.
Now, you may be reading this as
you sit in the stands waiting for the
Commencement festivities to
begin with Wacky Walk. Someone
special to you is graduating from
Stanford. Congratulations.
As the rare senior serving as
spring editor in chief and with the
prospect of writing this letter
hanging over my head, I've been
thinking about graduation speeches
lately and how to say goodbye.
And so I'm happy to share with
you some life lessons I've picked
up at The Daily.
It's very important to get things
right, but know that you will make
mistakes along the way. There's
never enough time. It's the people
who matter. Find a mentor. Just as
important, be a mentor. Be kind
and patient. Stay hungry. Friend
ship is the fabric of our lives.
Okay, I'm fairly certain that last
one is cotton. And the one before
that was said by Steve Jobs in his
2005 Commencement address.
The point is, for those of us
lucky enough to have worked for
The Daily, this is where we have
grown during our college years and
learned our first important life les
sons. We've been tested by the rig
ors of putting a paper out each day,
the code of ethics we choose to fol
low, a rapidly changing industry
and the honor of shaping the cam
pus dialogue.
Over the past four months, the
campus conversation has touched
on issues of deep importance to

each of us. We debated a heated
student government election and
changes to the Judicial Affairs
process. We examined what law
and order mean, home and abroad,
with the arrests of a top student
athlete and an alumnus in the West
Bank. We considered what makes
a Stanford education as the Faculty
Senate voted on landmark curricu
lum changes. We discussed what
kind of living environment we
cherish as the University moved
to revoke Chi Theta Chi's lease
despite student and alumni
protest.
We experienced loss.
This led to an essential conver
sation about suicide and an exami
nation of mental health resources
on campus.
In these tough times, communi
ty members look to The Daily for
dependable information and
thoughtful reporting.
Being at the helm of such an
organization has been a privilege
beyond what I could have imag
ined. And I'm not blind to how
lucky I have been. I've found some
thing that I love even in its most
painful moments. Sometimes espe
cially in its most painful moments.
Journalism, I've learned the
thrill ofreporting and the joy ofpass
ing it on to others â€”sticks with you.
I cannot thank the dedicated
Daily family enough. Few realize
the expansive team, with almost
200 contributors each year, that is
required to make the paper hap
pen.To our professional staff mem
bers, our business staff, the Board
of Directors, alumni, writers, artists,
photographers and the crazy
bunch of editors who joined me
this volume and suffered through
my jokes: Thank you.
I have confidence that our new
leadership will take us to even
greater heights and the conversa
tion with continue. I can't wait.
So much for patience.
