# The
						founder's syndrome at Stanford

Recall, if you will, your first
visit to Stanford. Perhaps
you were an ambitious,
awkward high school junior shuf
fling starry-eyed through an offi
cial tour. Maybe you were fleeing
the stresses of impending AP tests
by attending Admit Weekend.
Regardless, it's a safe bet that
somewhere along the way, some
one excitedly told you about the
diverse opportunities available to
undergraduates, epitomized by
the 600-plus student groups on
campus. Yet how many student
groups are active and adding
value to Stanford? A tenth? A
third? The sheer number of stu
dent groups created every quarter
raises questions about whether
each group truly serves a well-de
fined and unique purpose.
Though Stanford students like
to brag about the humility of cam
pus culture, the abundance of vol
untary student organizations
(VSOs) seems to challenge this
ideal. No amount of tanning on
the Oval can undo the ambitious
mentality of achievement that led
many of us to Stanford. Students
who apply for prestigious post
graduate scholarships or employ
ment know that selection com
mittees look favorably upon indi
viduals who have founded new
organizations. As a result, the
campus framework for entrepre
neurship tends to reify initiatives
that are new and revolutionary,
fitting neatly into the rhetoric of
innovation.
Part of the problem lies in the
way new VSOs are often founded;
a great deal of focus is placed on
launching the initiative, but com
paratively little time is invested in
building a sustainable organiza
tional infrastructure. As a result,
once the enthusiastic founders
graduate.many VSOs decline and
eventually become inactive. Cre

ating new student groups is not in
herently problematic, but the im
pulse to found new organizations
often leads to groups that dupli
cate each others' missions. This
problem is not unique to Stanford
indeed, it is common in non
profits all over the world, and it
stems from the hubris inherent in
a founding mentality. By being
more cognizant about the dynam
ics of sustainable versus unsus
tainable student groups, VSO
leaders can mitigate this problem.
Resolving this issue is difficult,
as it means shifting the focus of
Stanford culture from one that ex
alts the founders of new entities to
one that gives credit to those who
breathe new life into existing or
ganizations a far less glam
orous role. Yet while entrepre
neurship, as embodied in the cur
rent campus mentality, is the
source of the problem, it may also
be the solution. Reviving strug
gling student groups requires en
trepreneurial skills at the highest
level aggressive fundraising
and recruiting, adept manage
ment and passionate vision. A
truly entrepreneurial campus
would place as much emphasis
and value on sustaining and reviv
ing existing student groups as it
does upon founding new ones.
This means having the humility to
recognize the value in realizing
other people's ideas, as well as
one's own.
Stanford students are infatuat
ed with the rhetoric of entrepre
neurship, but this means that en
trepreneurship is defined in dan
gerously narrow terms. The Edito
rial Board recommends that the
ASSU execute a comprehensive
review of VSOs, identifying areas
where student groups can com
bine or collaborate. This process
would allow the ASSU to conduct
a needs assessment of student
group resource needs, as well as
