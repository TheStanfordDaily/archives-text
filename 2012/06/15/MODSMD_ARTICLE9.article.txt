# The 						value of a liberal education

Students' anticipation of the
opening of winter quarter en
rollment this past weekend
undoubtedly prompted some stu
dents to express fmstration over
Stanford's General Education Re
quirements (GERs). The non-
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) students are required to take
three IHUM courses, two PWR
classes and classes that cover five
Disciplinary Breadth areas (Hu
manities, Social Sciences, Mathe
matics, Natural Sciences and Ap
plied Sciences and Engineering)
and two of four Education for Citi
zenship requirements. In practice,
this amounts to around eight to 10
courses outside of one's major (the
Foreign Language requirement,
not technically a GER, requires up
to three additional classes).
Although the GERs fall under
criticism, the theory underlying
their existence that values a lib
eral education, or an education in
volving study in all the major sub
fields is sound. Although a liber
al education might once have been
valued for the purpose of educating
the future elite in upper-class social
norms, such as an understanding of
Greek, in the 21st Century a more
practical justification is in order.
There are at least two such justifica
tions. One is that, in exposing all stu
dents to a wide range of fields, re
quiring a liberal education can help
students find new intellectual pas
sions. Given that many Stanford
students ultimately major in some
thing completely different from
what they originally intended, this
benefit cannot be ignored. Howev
er, we must also justify the liberal

education for those students who
are completely certain of their
major and future career. A com
mon question asked by critiques of
a liberal education goes something
like this: why should an English
major, dead set on writing for a liv
ing, need to take classes in math, sci
ence and engineering?
But the fact that college educa
tion is becoming increasingly spe
cialized further warrants liberal ed
ucation requirements. We are en
tering a workforce and society
where having knowledge in just
one field will not suffice. The Na
tional Academy of Engineering, for
instance,recognizes the importance
of a liberal education. In its 2004 re
port on the "Engineer of 2020," the
NAE stated that "learning discipli
nary technical subjects to the exclu
sion of a selection of humanities,
economics, political science, lan
guage and/or interdisciplinary tech
nical subjects is not in the best inter
est of producing engineers able to
communicate with the public, able
to engage in a global engineering
marketplace, or trained to be life
long learners." And in an increas
ingly technology-dependent world,
it is important that those majoring
in the humanities and social sci
ences have college-level exposure
to math, science and engineering if
their major does not already re
quire it.
Yet despite the fantastic class of
ferings across many disciplines at
Stanford, the Study on Undergrad
uate Education at Stanford found
that students often fall under the
misguided impression that their
major represents the entirety of
their relevant college education.
High unit counts in certain majors

are likely somewhat responsible for
this trend, although also at play is
the fact that some students may not
take GERs seriously. In its extreme
form, some students see little to no
value in being required to take
classes outside their primary disci
pline. This is a particularly short
sighted belief; the concept of a liber
al education, for instance, is widely
endorsed among Stanford faculty
and in the professional world.
These students, however, are not
entirely to blame for negative per
spectives on the GER system; the
current requirements have some
serious flaws. Though well inten
tioned, the IHUM requirement en
grains many freshmen with a belief
that future GERs are to be resent
ed, not welcomed. Furthermore, for
those who want an easy way out of
the requirements, Course√üank
makes it simple to find the approxi
mately 7 percent of Disciplinary
Breadth classes that reportedly
have fewer than five hours of work
per week. Although it is impossible
to expect all students to challenge
themselves in fulfilling GERs, a
University that values its require
ments should not aid students who
want to shirk them. Accordingly,
classes that fulfill GER require
ments should have to pass a certain
rigor. They should also have to be
relevant to Stanford's mission in
providing a practical liberal educa
tion. As it stands, the application of
which classes fulfill the breadth re
quirement and which do not is inco
herent. It is hard to understand why
History 257 C (LGBT History in
the United States) cannot fulfill one
of the five breadth GERs while
Music 21 (Elements of Music I)
can fulfill the Humanities require
ment. And, if the University wants
it students to appreciate the value
of its requirements, professors in
GER-fulfilling classes should be
required to explain why their class
is relevant to non-majors.
These are just some of the first
steps the University needs to take
if it wants every student to view
the GERs as a fundamental piece
of his or her Stanford education.
However, some of the onus is on
students as well. It is easy to com
plain about GERs given high
workloads, but that fact should not
prevent us from embracing the
notion of a liberal education. It is
easy to complain about being
forced to take classes outside a
field of interest, but let us remem
ber that sometimes requirements

are there for our own benefit. Yes,
there are legitimate problems with
the GER system. But let us not
allow the University to confuse
these criticisms with those of stu
dents who simply do not value a
liberal education.
