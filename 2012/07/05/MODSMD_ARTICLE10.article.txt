# A
						SEASON IN REVIEW
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
Twenty-five days ago, the cruel
Southeast sun set on another Stan
ford baseball season, the 24th in a
row that has ended without a third
national championship trophy mak
ing its way to the Farm.

And as Cardinal fans watched
another Pac-12 school, Arizona,
erase a 25-year title drought of its
own last Monday, they must have
been shaking their heads that such a
promising season ended with anoth
er floundering effort in the Super
Regionals.
This year's squad (41-18, 18-12
Pac-12), which ends its season
ranked No. 12 in the country, was a
near-copy of its No. 13 counterpart
from a season ago. Seven of eight
position players returned and ace
righty Mark Appel remained a Fri
day stalwart, yet for the second year
in a row, high conference expecta
tions gave way to a middle-of-the
pack finish and a disappointing
Super Regional in the Southeast.
An experienced lineup and the
return of junior lefthander Brett
Mooneyham from injury prompted
a preseason No. 2 ranking for Stan

ford, which still was set to host No.
10 Vanderbilt, No. 13 Texas and No.
6 Rice in its first month of play.

"We're No. 2 now but we won't
be ranked No. 2 in four weeks, be
cause somebody's going to be unde
feated," said head coach Mark Mar
quess in advance of the opener.
"We're not going to be undefeated
after four weeks with the teams that
we're playing."
The Cardinal nearly proved its
venerated skipper wrong. Unlike in
2011, when Stanford struggled to a
6-5 start, the Cardinal swept the
Commodores and Longhorns while
roaring out to a 13-2 record.
By that point, Stanford had al
ready claimed the No. 1 ranking,
Mooneyham was at 4-0 and junior
third baseman Stephen Piscotty had
amassed 23 RBI in 15 games. The
Cardinal was committing just one
error per contest and had found a
reliable third starter in freshman
lefty John Hochstatter, who posted
a 1.09 ERA through four outings.
The squad picked by every
Pac-12 coach but Marquess to win
the conference swept a double
header at USC to keep things going,
but then the wheels came off on
Stanford's spotless season. A series

ending loss to the Trojans was fol
lowed by a sweep at Arizona, cap
ping a five-game stretch that saw the
Cardinal commit 14 errors and get
just 10 hits from the top three spots
in its order.

A five-run rally in the bottom of
the ninth in a midweek win against
St. Mary's provided the emotional
boost to pull Stanford out of that
hole.

"As far as the momentum, I
think we've got that now," Piscotty
said.

And the Cardinal had proof of
something else: its star hitter could
pitch. Piscotty tossed 3.2 scoreless
innings against the Gaels for the win
and moved to 2-0 with another relief
victory in the decisive rubber game
at Washington that weekend.
After winning midweek games
against Cal and Pacific by a com
bined 27-9 margin, Stanford's
prospects were good as it prepared
to host No. 16 Oregon. Leading the
charge was junior catcher Eric
Smith, a converted infielder who
had a .360 batting average through
27 games.
But the Ducks, much like even
tual Pac-12 co-champion Arizona,
proved to be the Cardinal's kryp

tonite as they nabbed 5-0 and 4-2
wins to open the series. Before Stan
ford got a 4-2 victory of its own on
Sunday, junior reliever Sahil Bloom
took stock of the team's season at
the midway point.
"We've just got to start playing a
little more consistent baseball,"
Bloom said. "We can't be on a roller
coaster. We can't score 19 against
Cal and then come out and do this."

There was nothing inconsistent
about the next two weeks for Stan
ford. Freshman Alex Blandino
earned national player of the week
honors after powering a Cardinal
sweep of Arizona State with three
homers. In light of a season-ending
injury to sophomore shortstop Lon
nie Kauppila, Blandino added some
much-needed hitting, and Piscotty
moved to left field to accommodate
him.

A series win at UCLA the next
weekend moved the Cardinal back
within striking distance of Oregon,
but yet again it struggled to keep up
its high level of play. Two losses in a
neck-and-neck series at Oregon
State left Stanford in a three-way tie
for fifth place with three weeks to
play.

After Appel notched his eighth
win to open a home tilt with Wash
ington State, Piscotty made his first
career pitching start in place of a
struggling Hochstatter, and he
earned a victory to secure the series.
A grand slam by freshman Dominic
Jose that Sunday capped the sweep
and kept Stanford alive in the Pac
-12 race.

"That's really going to serve us
well as we go down the road, [get
ting] contributions from a lot of
guys," Marquess said of Piscotty
and Jose.

An unsurprising sweep of Utah
and a two-homer midweek effort by
junior centerfielder Jake Stewart
sent the Cardinal into its final series
against Cal on an eight-game win
streak.

Two games back of the confer
ence lead, Stanford's outright title
hopes were shattered by the Bears
in the opener, an 18-inning epic.
Mooneyham then struggled in a 15-
5 loss to end an up-and-down regu
lar season for the shell-shocked
southpaw.

Star player Stephen Piscotty (above) was one of the biggest contributors for the Cardinal on the diamond
this past season. The First Team ALL-Pac-l2 player was a vital presence both at the plate and on the mound.
