Thud. That's perhaps the only
way to describe how the Stan
ford baseball team ended its
season.
The Cardinal got beat by a No. 3
Florida State team that flat-out de
served its national seed. But 17-1?
18-7? What away to go, especially
when a Mark Marquess-coached
team hadn't lost by 10 or more runs
once much less twice since
April 2009.

Stanford's bats fell silent for 10
straight innings and 21 Cardinal run
ners were stranded over the course
of the Super Regional, but you can't
reasonably expect a team to come
back from the kinds of deficits the
squad faced in Tallahassee. This one
was on the pitchers.
The humidity and raucous crowd
surely played their part, but above
all, the Seminoles brought out weak
nesses in Stanford's pitching staff
that had been lurking all season long
the same weaknesses that led to a
fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 and
kept the Cardinal from hosting a
Super Regional of its own.
The unexpected disappointment
of the weekend was ace righty Mark
Appel. By the time he escaped a
seven-run fourth inning on June 8,
the Super Regional opener was, for
all intents and purposes, over.
But can you really blame Appel,
who still finished with a 10-2 record
and a 3.33 strikeout-to-walk ratio,
for a lost season?

I'm not one to target the guy that
Marquess had faith in all year long.
That faith, however, kept Appel in
the fateful fourth inning through
four hits, three walks, a hit batter and
a wild pitch. Why didn't Marquess
yank Appel when he was clearly off
his game?

It wasn't the first time that Appel
was on a surprisingly long leash
he threw 149 pitches in a Friday
night start against Oregon but
that inning revealed just how little
Marquess had going for him in the
bullpen. Freshman lefties John
Hochstatter and Spenser Linney
struggled for much of the season,
while rookie righty David Schmidt
just wasn't ready for the full-time
closer role. Redshirt sophomore
Garrett Hughes and junior Sahil
Bloom had some impressive out
ings, but both went flat in the Super
Regional, combining for six earned
runs and only four outs.
The loss of senior righthander
Brian Busick, who posted a 2.79
ERA in 2011 despite the elbow in
jury that would eventually limit
him to two innings this season,
seems pretty significant in hind
sight, considering that only one
Cardinal reliever posted a better

ERA this season.
And that reliever, sophomore
righty A .J. Vanegas (2.62), probably
should have been a starter in the first
place.

After Hochstatter lost the Sun
day job, Vanegas started in the se
ries finales against Washington and
Oregon, giving up just two earned
runs in 11.2 innings. Stanford won
both games.
Then Marquess began experi
menting with Hochstatter and
Bloom on Sundays admittedly
with some success before settling
on traditional third baseman
Stephen Piscotty as Stanford's final
starter.

Purely in terms of pitching, the
move made sense. Piscotty had gut
ted out some tough wins in long re

lief and deserved a shot at the start
ing job, where he excelled, winning
all four games. It seemed that Stan
ford's best slugger would be its sav
ing grace on the mound.
That added responsibility, how
ever, took its toll on Piscotty's hitting
numbers. As a pure fielder he start
ed his season on a tear, hitting .334
with 24 RBI in the team's first 18
games. In games 19 through 45

when Piscotty came out of the pen
he actually hit .355, with his run
production dropping down to a
more human one RBI per game.
But in the 15 games between Piscot
ty's first start on May 12 and the end
of the season, he went a pedestrian
17-for-62 (.274) with a measly six
RBI.

Marquess really had no other

choice but to start Piscotty; he need
ed Vanegas in the bullpen, where
the sophomore shined in the second
game of the regional. Still, Stanford
could've used Piscotty's missing of
fense in a series loss to Cal (2-for-17)
and two close regional games
against Pepperdine (2-for-8).

Meanwhile, the Cardinal's sec
ond starter, lefty Brett Mooneyham,
had a tough redshirt junior season.
A 5-0 start gave way to a two-month
winless streak between March 26
and May 13, and two dominant
showings against Washington State
and Utah gave way to three outings
that didn't last into the fifth inning.
If the bullpen and Mooneyham
had each earned Stanford two more
conference victories (see one-run
defeats in series losses to Arizona,

Oregon State and Cal), it would
have won the Pac-12 with two games
to spare and hosted a Super Region
al. With those arms going you've got
to think the Cardinal would have
made it to Omaha, or, at least, con
tended on its home field in going
out.

So here we are in the first week of
July, already almost a month re
moved from Stanford baseball,
looking back at another potential
championship season thrown away.
Emphasis on the "thrown."
