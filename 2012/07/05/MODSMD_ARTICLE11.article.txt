Thud. That's perhaps the only
way to describe how the Stan
ford baseball team ended its
season.
The Cardinal got beat by a No. 3
Florida State team that flat-out de
served its national seed. But 17-1?
18-7? What away to go, especially
when a Mark Marquess-coached
team hadn't lost by 10 or more runs
once much less twice since
April 2009.

Stanford's bats fell silent for 10
straight innings and 21 Cardinal run
ners were stranded over the course
of the Super Regional, but you can't
reasonably expect a team to come
back from the kinds of deficits the
squad faced in Tallahassee. This one
was on the pitchers.
The humidity and raucous crowd
surely played their part, but above
all, the Seminoles brought out weak
nesses in Stanford's pitching staff
that had been lurking all season long
the same weaknesses that led to a
fourth-place finish in the Pac-12 and
kept the Cardinal from hosting a
Super Regional of its own.
The unexpected disappointment
of the weekend was ace righty Mark
Appel. By the time he escaped a
seven-run fourth inning on June 8,
the Super Regional opener was, for
all intents and purposes, over.
But can you really blame Appel,
who still finished with a 10-2 record
and a 3.33 strikeout-to-walk ratio,
for a lost season?

I'm not one to target the guy that
Marquess had faith in all year long.
That faith, however, kept Appel in
the fateful fourth inning through
four hits, three walks, a hit batter and
a wild pitch. Why didn't Marquess
yank Appel when he was clearly off
his game?

It wasn't the first time that Appel
was on a surprisingly long leash
he threw 149 pitches in a Friday
night start against Oregon but
that inning revealed just how little
Marquess had going for him in the
bullpen. Freshman lefties John
Hochstatter and Spenser Linney
struggled for much of the season,
while rookie righty David Schmidt
