# THE 						CARD DYNASTY

### George Chen 
They say that all roads lead to
Omaha in college baseball.
Well, Omaha certainly was a
busy destination during the past
week andnotjustforcollege base
ball. Last Monday night, while South
Carolina and Arizona were duking it
out at TD Ameritrade Park in Game
2 of the College World Series final,
Olympic stars Michael Phelps and
Ryan Lochte were battling stroke for
stroke right across the street at the
Qwest Center in the 400-meter indi
vidual medley race of the U.S. Swim
ming Olympic Trials.
Baseball and swimming are two
sports that couldn't possibly be more
different from each other. Give base
ball players a typical swim workout
and most of them would probably
drown. Put swimmers at the plate and
most of them would probably swing
the bat the wrong way. If you're not
convinced, just imagine C.C. Sabathia
wearing a Speedo or Michael Phelps
trying to pitch a slider.
But on that Monday night in
Omaha, it wasn't the difference be
tween the two sports that mattered. It
was the outcomes that counted. The
results of both the South Carolina-
Arizona finale and the Phelps-
Lochte showdown shared the same

important lesson for all athletes,
teams, coaches and fans: In sports,
staying dominant at the highest level
might be the single hardest task to ac
complish.

South Carolina arrived in Omaha
seeking an improbable third consec
utive national title. The Gamecocks
were only the sixth team in college
baseball history to have won back-to
back national championships. Their
recent historic postseason campaigns
saw them setting records for the most
consecutive postseason wins with 22
and the most consecutive College
World Series wins with 12. Taking
home a third national title would
have cemented the team's status as
one of the most dominant dynasties
in college baseball history.
But Arizona, carried by both its
lights-out pitching and explosive hit
ting, dashed South Carolina's hopes
with a two-game sweep to clinch its
first CWS title in almost 30 years.
In a similar story, Michael Phelps
headed into the 2012 Olympic trials
as arguably the greatest Olympian of
all time. His iconic, jaw-dropping
eight Olympic gold medals in Beijing
four years ago went down as one of
the greatest performances in sports
history. Of course, there were talks
before the race about how Phelps
hadn't been training seriously until a
year and a half ago. But regardless of
the circumstances, you probably
wouldn't want to bet against Phelps
in anything that has to do with water.
Ryan Lochte clearly had other
things in mind. It seemed only fitting
that Lochte beat Phelps in the 400 in

dividual medley by the same exact
margin that Phelps beat Lochte four
years ago in the same event and in the
same pool. Granted, Phelps bounced
back by beating Lochte later in the
trials, but the aura of invincibility sur
rounding Phelps was shredded.

It's not that South Carolina and
Phelps should be criticized for failing
to maintain their dominance. It's the
exact opposite. Both the Gamecocks
and Phelps should be appreciated for
staying dominant as long as they have
been. Regardless of what happened
last week, neither South Carolina's
storied postseason success nor
Phelps's historic performances will
be forgotten.
We all love the upset stories in
sports. The U.S. hockey team's mag
ical victory over the Soviet Union in
the 1980 Miracle on Ice. George
Mason's incredible March Madness
run in 2006. Fresno State's improba
ble CWS title in 2008. Chelsea's
tremendous upset over heavily fa
vored Barcelona and Bayern Mu
nich to claim the Champions League
title just a couple months ago. Those
will always be unforgettable mo
ments.

But as sports fans, we should also
appreciate the teams that have
stayed dominant for absurd lengths
of time. In many ways, those dynas
ties defied the odds just as much as
the Cinderella teams did. The Boston
Celtics claiming 11 NBA titles in 13
seasons. The UCLA basketball team
amassing 10 NCAA championships
over the span of 12 years. The New
York Yankees winning 11 World Se

ries in 16 years. The North Carolina
women's soccer team collecting 16
national titles over 19 seasons. Those
were no easy feats. One injury, one
unlucky bounce or one-tenth of a sec
ond could have all shattered those
teams' legendary dominance.

So why does all of this matter, es
pecially when most of these dynasties
are long gone? It matters because a
special kind of dynasty in sports is
happening right now in front of our
eyes, right here at Stanford. Last
week, the day after South Carolina
was swept by Arizona, the day after
Phelps was beaten by Lochte, Stan
ford was awarded the Directors'
Cup, given annually to the top overall
collegiate athletics program, for the
18th consecutive year.
Sure, the Directors' Cup might
not be as prestigious as the Lombardi
Trophy or the Stanley Cup. But in a
way, it means just as much, if not
more. The fact that the Cardinal has
won this award every time except for
the cup's inaugural year in 1993
speaks volumes about the overall
dominance of the Stanford athletics
program.

The Cardinal has maintained an
incredibly high level of performance
for a long period of time. To do that,
all the pieces have to come together:
motivated student-athletes, world
class coaches, talented recruits and
countless other factors. And that's
just for one sport.

Even in a year where our baseball
team might have performed below
our own high expectations, our top
two women's tennis players also hap
pened to be the top two collegiate
players in the nation. And that might
be the best thing about Stanford ath
letics. There's always a great level of
overall consistency. There's always
something to be excited about.
Stanford's current reign over in
tercollegiate sports might not grab
national headlines every week, but
the 18 Directors' Cups that we have
shows that, if nothing else, the
longevity of Stanford dominance is
undeniable.
Here's to the Cardinal dynasty.

George Chen is beginning a colum
nist dynasty of his own with this
piece. Cheer him on to (at least) 18 in
a row at gchenls@stanford.edu.
