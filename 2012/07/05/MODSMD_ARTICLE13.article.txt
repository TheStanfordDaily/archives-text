# Olympic Trials
## DREAMS OF LONDON CARDINAL FACES TOUGH TRIALS 
### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS EDITOR 
With the 2012 Summer
Olympics in London fast ap
proaching, a host of Stanford ath
letes have been competing in the
trials for various sports in the
hopes of fulfilling their Olympic
dreams.

At the U.S. Olympic Track &
Field Trials, Jillian Camarena-
Williams earned her second
straight berth in the shot put
event. The 2004 Stanford gradu
ate beat out the competition with
a toss of 62 feet, 10.5 inches, giving
her the de facto national title.
After winning a bronze medal at
the 2011 World Championships in
the shot put, she will be vying for a
place on the podium in London.
Also heading to London will be
Arantxa King, an All-American
fifth-year senior and graduate stu
dent this past season. King will
take part in the long jump, an
event that she also competed in
four years ago in Beijing.
On the men's side, recent grad
uate Chris Derrick narrowly
missed a U.S. Olympic team berth
by placing fourth in the 10,000 me
ters with a time of 27:40.23. Der
rick got off to a strong start and
pushed the leaders for much of the
race but could not hold on for the
top-three finish that was needed
to earn a trip to London. His gutsy
performance came less than two
months after he set a new colle
giate record in the 10,000 at the
Pay ton Jordan Invitational.
In women's volleyball, former
Cardinal players middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo and outside
hitter Logan Tom were named to
the 12-member U.S. team, current
ly the top-ranked team in the world.
In 2008, Akinradewo was the Vol
leyball Magazine Co-National Play-
er of the Year while Tom was the American
Volleyball Coaches Association National
Player of the Year.
On the diving board, rising sophomore

Kristian Ipsen
will be heading
to London to
compete in
3-meter syn
chronized event
with his partner,
Troy Dumais,'
after they won
the event at th<
trials. Ipsen
barely missed
qualifying for a

second event the 3-meter individual
dive when he finished third, just 1.25
points short of second place. Joining
Ipsen will be 2007 graduate Cassidy
Krug, who won the women's 3-meter in
dividual event to clinch her first Olympic
berth.

Both Ipsen and Krug will have a famil
iar face guiding them during the Games,
as Stanford diving head coach Rick
Schavone will be the assistant women's
and men's diving coach of the U.S.
Olympic team. This marks the first time
that the veteran skipper, who has been at
the helm of Stanford diving for 34 years,
will be on an Olympic coaching staff.
The Cardinal came agonizingly close
to sending some of its swimmers to Lon
don. In the 200-meter butterfly, recently
graduated Bobby Bollier was less than
seven-tenths of a second from landing a
spot on the U.S. team. Bollier swam the
top time in both the preliminary and
semifinal heats, beating defending
Olympic champion Michael Phelps in the
semifinal race. Chad La Tourette, also a
2012 graduate, likewise finished third in
the 1,500-meter freestyle and missed the
team by just one spot. The experienced
distance swimmer led the race for the en
tire first 1,250 meters but faded in the
final laps.
Rising junior Maya Dißado also came
close to grabbing a spot on the U.S.
women's swimming team. The Cardinal
standout placed fourth in both the 200
and 400 individual medley events.
In gymnastics, rising sophomore Krish
na Vaculik will be representing Canada in
London after she won on the uneven bars
and took second in both the beam and all
around program events at the Canadian
Olympic Trials. Vaculik had a strong fresh
man campaign for the Cardinal this past
season, including scoring 9.875 on the bars
at the NCAA Ann Arbor Regional.

event. The 2004 Stanford gradu
ate beat out the competition with
a toss of 62 feet, 10.5 inches, giving
her the de facto national title.
After winning a bronze medal at
the 2011 World Championships in
the shot put, she will be vying for a
place on the podium in London.
Also heading to London will be
Arantxa King, an All-American
fifth-year senior and graduate stu
dent this past season. King will
take part in the long jump, an
event that she also competed in
four years ago in Beijing.
On the men's side, recent grad
uate Chris Derrick narrowly
missed a U.S. Olympic team berth
by placing fourth in the 10,000 me
ters with a time of 27:40.23. Der
rick got off to a strong start and
pushed the leaders for much of the
race but could not hold on for the
top-three finish that was needed
to earn a trip to London. His gutsy
performance came less than two
months after he set a new colle
giate record in the 10,000 at the
Pay ton Jordan Invitational.
In women's volleyball, former
Cardinal players middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo and outside
hitter Logan Tom were named to
the 12-member U.S. team, current
ly the top-ranked team in the world.
In 2008, Akinradewo was the Vol
leyball Magazine Co-National Play-
er of the Year while Tom was the American
Volleyball Coaches Association National
Player of the Year.
On the diving board, rising sophomore

Kristian Ipsen
will be heading
to London to
compete in
3-meter syn
chronized event
with his partner,
Troy Dumais,'
after they won
the event at th<
trials. Ipsen
barely missed
qualifying for a

second event the 3-meter individual
dive when he finished third, just 1.25
points short of second place. Joining
Ipsen will be 2007 graduate Cassidy
Krug, who won the women's 3-meter in
dividual event to clinch her first Olympic
berth.

Both Ipsen and Krug will have a famil
iar face guiding them during the Games,
as Stanford diving head coach Rick
Schavone will be the assistant women's
and men's diving coach of the U.S.
Olympic team. This marks the first time
that the veteran skipper, who has been at
the helm of Stanford diving for 34 years,
will be on an Olympic coaching staff.
The Cardinal came agonizingly close
to sending some of its swimmers to Lon
don. In the 200-meter butterfly, recently
graduated Bobby Bollier was less than
seven-tenths of a second from landing a
spot on the U.S. team. Bollier swam the
top time in both the preliminary and
semifinal heats, beating defending
Olympic champion Michael Phelps in the
semifinal race. Chad La Tourette, also a
2012 graduate, likewise finished third in
the 1,500-meter freestyle and missed the
team by just one spot. The experienced
distance swimmer led the race for the en
tire first 1,250 meters but faded in the
final laps.
Rising junior Maya Dißado also came
close to grabbing a spot on the U.S.
women's swimming team. The Cardinal
standout placed fourth in both the 200
and 400 individual medley events.
In gymnastics, rising sophomore Krish
na Vaculik will be representing Canada in
London after she won on the uneven bars
and took second in both the beam and all
around program events at the Canadian
Olympic Trials. Vaculik had a strong fresh
man campaign for the Cardinal this past
season, including scoring 9.875 on the bars
at the NCAA Ann Arbor Regional.
