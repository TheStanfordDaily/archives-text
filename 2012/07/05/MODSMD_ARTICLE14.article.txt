## Stanford wins 18th consecutive Directors' Cup 
### â€“ George Chen 
Stanford was awarded the Learfield
Sports Directors' Cup last Tuesday, mark
ing the 18th consecutive year that Stanford
has received the accolade. The Directors'
Cup, presented by the National Associa
tion of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, is
given annually to the top overall college
athletics program in the nation.
The Cardinal has won the cup every year
except for the award's inaugural season,
1993-1994, when Stanford finished second
to the University of North Carolina.

The award takes into account a school's
top ten men's and top ten women's sports
performances. In the point standings, Stan
ford led with 1,448.25 points, well ahead of
runner-up Florida (1,314) and third-place
finisher UCLA (1,142.75). Ohio State
(1,104.25) and Florida State (1,061) fin
ished fourth and fifth, respectively. The
cup rankings are based on the aggregated
points from the fall, winter and spring
sports seasons. The Cardinal was atop the
standings for all three seasons.
The Pac-12 as a whole had a strong
showing, as three schools from the confer
ence were in the top 10 and six schools
were among the top 25.
The Cardinal's dominance was paced by
national titles in three sports: women's soc
cer, women's water polo and women's
lightweight rowing eights. The three na
tional team championships this season ex
tended Stanford's record of consecutive
seasons with at least one national team title
to 36. Stanford currently has 103 NCAA
team championships, second in the nation
behind UCLA's 108.

Out of Stanford's 35 total sports pro
grams, 17 finished their seasons this year
with a top-10 national ranking.
The trophy presentation for the 2011-
2012 Learfield Sports Directors' Cup took
place last Tuesday in Dallas, Texas.
