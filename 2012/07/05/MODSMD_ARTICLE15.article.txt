## 
### 
Stanford women's swimming and diving
head coach Lea Maurer announced her
resignation on Tuesday, citing her wish to
devote more time to her family as the rea
son for her departure.

The former Stanford swimmer took
over the head coach position during the
2005-2006 season. Since then, the Cardinal
has finished in the top five at the NCAA
Championships and in the top three at the
Pac-10/12 Championships every year.

Maurer also led Stanford to three unde

feated dual-meet regular seasons in the
seven seasons she coached. With Maurer at
the helm, the Cardinal has lost only five
times out of the 71 total dual meets that it
has competed in, amassing a regular season
record of 66-5.
During this past season, Stanford gar
nered 36 All-America honors and pro
duced two NCAA champions. The team
also finished second at the Pac-12 Champi
onships, on the heels of winning two con
secutive conference championships in 2010
and 2011. Maurer leaves after having
coached a total of 13 NCAA champions
and 37 conference champions.
Outside of coaching at Stanford, Maur
er was part of the U.S. team's coaching
staff for the 2007 Pan American Games.
Maurer's resignation came less than two
months after men's swimming and diving
head coach Skip Kenney announced his re
tirement.
