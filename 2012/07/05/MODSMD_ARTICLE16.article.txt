Stanford baseball outfielder and foot
ball running back Tyler Gaffney signed
with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Stanford offi
cially confirmed on Monday.
Gaffney could have played one more
season of football next fall as a senior but
instead chose to forgo his eligibility in
order to pursue a professional career in
baseball.

"Stanford has been amazing. I can't say
enough. Brotherhood on each team. But
I'm going to pursue a dream. I can't pass
this up," announced Gaffney on his Twit
ter account.

Gaffney was drafted in the 24th round
of the 2012 MLB Draft last month.
Over his three seasons with the Cardi
nal, he batted .301 and amassed eight home
runs. During this past season, he hit .245,
drove in 17 runs and scored 48. Gaffney
earned All-Pac-10 honorable mentions
during both his freshman and sophomore
campaigns.

On the football field last fall, Gaffney
rushed for 449 yards and scored seven
touchdowns as a junior. Gaffney started
out the 2011-2012 season as the third run
ning back on the depth chart behind Step
fan Taylor and Anthony Wilkerson but
gradually moved up to the number-two
spot, and was featured in wildcat forma
tions. He leaves the Farm with 815 career
rushing yards and 12 touchdowns.
Gaffney could be joining his teammate
Mark Appel, the Stanford ace who was se
lected eighth overall by the Pirates in the
draft. Appel, however, has not officially
signed with the Pirates yet.
