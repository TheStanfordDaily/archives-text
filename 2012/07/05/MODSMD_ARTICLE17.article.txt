## MOVIES THE 						AMAZING SPIDER-MAN New actor draws clear line between good and evil 
### â€“ natasha AVERY contact natasha: navery@stanford. edu 
Complete with gratuitous 3-D, CGI villains and
magic science, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is
just the movie that America needs around the
Fourth of July. Shedding the thematic darkness of the
comic books' previous incarnations, Andrew Garfield as
Spider-Man takes a younger, fresher and cleaner take on
the tale.
Since the conclusion of the last "Spider-Man" trilo
gy, the graphics have gotten better and the spandex has
gotten tighter. The feisty Mary Jane has been replaced
with a sweeter Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Things
explode, buildings crumble and (spoiler alert!) justice
prevails. "The Amazing Spider-Man" is all fun and
games and no subtlety, and for the most part, that's
okay.
The acting saves this movie from mediocrity.
"Spider-Man's" lackluster script is carried by the
strength of its cast, bringing solid performances from
leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as well as Sally
Field and Martin Sheen, who play Parker's relatives,
without falling into caricature.
Garfield has surprising charisma for probably the
least eloquent superhero of all time. His take on the
character is unique; Garfield's Parker is friendless but not
lonely, smart but not nerdy. His Spider-Man remains
endearing, and his comical attempts at trash talk as he
adjusts to his vigilante lifestyle make it easy to root for
him.
However, when Peter Parker's distinguishing trait is
his youthful gracelessness, you lose some of the ethical
complications the series prided itself on; Parker the
goofy skateboarder doesn't the same carry moral weight
as Parker the cage fighter does. Garfield takes a shorter
route to self-discovery, portraying a more black-and
white relationship with the criminal underworld.
The prize for effort goes to Emma Stone. "She's
