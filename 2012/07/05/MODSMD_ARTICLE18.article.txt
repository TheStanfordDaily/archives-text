## Turning FACEBOOK STALKING into an art form 
### 
Between sketchy housemates and sorority sis
ters, my Facebook-stalking skills have
become as finely tuned as those of the CIA.
Too bad my penchant for pot-stirring cancels out
any secret-finding ability with secret-telling. Perhaps
investigative journalism will make a nice compro
mise, but that's a different article. So, have you ever
Facebook-stalked anyone?
I have, but I still fact-check every detail I find. I
imagine that if I ever realized I was interested in the
same sex, I would still double-check during a date,
too, just to make sure. "Wait, wait... you're a les
bian, right? Okay, cool, that's totally what I thought,
just makin' sure." I would ask then for the same rea
son I ask now, and it's not simply for the sake of
fact-checking. I'm scared of rejection, and of not
knowing what to say. Yes, we all are, but none of us
admit it.
It's almost impossible to effectively introduce
things these days if you're not the host of an awards
show or a corporate bro making the rounds, which
is why FB stalking can take the edge off things
you'll already know exactly what to talk about.
Today, I'll be trying to introduce you not only
to this article, but to this little regular piece I'll be
writing, a column if you will, because the only thing
worse than making introductions is when people go
ranting off to you without stating their existence. So
here it is.

I am Sasha and I will on occasion write this col
umn to you, faithful (existent?) reader. I am
presently residing in Sash Angeles (what they call
Los Angeles when I'm in town) and am soon mov-
ing to join my FroSo roommate
and our fellow Larkin lover to live
in Westwood. Actually, I am incre
mentally moving there because, by
some clown-car trick, I managed to
fit more in my Murray dorm room
than I can manage to fit into my
SUV in two trips. But a couple
days ago, I was lucky enough to
exchange awkward introductions
with my neighbor, thea hottie.
My introduction with Hot
Neighbor was awkward, yes, but
what I lacked in charisma due to
personality-stunting medication,
he made up for in plucked grins

and Nordic bone structure. Palms
clammed, pulses quickened, hearts
swooned (all mine). And, of
course, Facebook stalking ensued.
And what did I discover of Hot

Neighbor? He's a model.
I guess I shouldn't be sur
prised given that this is L.A., where
models roam the streets looking
for billboard opportunities like

post-apocalyptic zombies search
for human brains. Plus he's just
really hot. But there goes any hope
of this being a summer sex column
and me being the next Carrie
Bradshaw. And yet, I couldn't help
but wonder...

So that's my introduction to
you. Just one girl in the big city,
moving to pretty-close-to-Bel-Air
but-still-quite-modest. Also, did I
mention that I pay my own rent?
With money that I earned myself?
Seriously, someone get me an
introsem to teach.

Sasha started her writing career with
notes under the pen name "Mom."
She did not live in FroSoCo, but the

term "FroSo roommate" is more

succinct than "roommate from fresh
man and sophomore year." Make
your introductions with her at
