## SUMMERTIME SINGLES Chris Brown delivers, Maroon 5 falls flat

Now that we're all done
vegetating after the dead
day/finals one-two
punch, a.k.a. the worst exam
schedule known to mankind, we
can get back to the important
things in life, like waking up at
the crack of dawn to jam to
Maroon 5 performing on the
Today Show (incredibly awkward
if no one else did this ...). The
beginning of summer always
brings a wave of album releases;
here are a couple of the more
memorable ones that
Intermission missed over the
break.
Chris Brown "Fortune"
There's a pretty clear shift in
hip-hop/R&B from smooth sub
tlety toward maximum blatancy;
for instance, compare "Baby Got
Back" (1992) to "Ms. New
Booty" (2006) to "Dance (Ass)"
(2011), and things may become
clear. Chris Brown is a more
innocuous culprit looking at
Big Sean's song titles at least gives
you a certain expectation for the

next four minutes. But Brown, on
the other hand, throws in songs
like "Sweet Love," which might
sound like it would be a romantic
ballad but actually belies a track
that literally begins, Baby, let's get
naked

From a more objective
standpoint, though, Brown

became famous for his sexy
crooning, and "Fortune" delivers
more of the same. The album

doesn't contain many singles
aside from "Turn Up the Music,"
but maybe that represents Brown
going in a more mature direction.
Where his two previous albums,
"Exclusive" and "F.A.M.E.," were
largely name-calling, now that
Brown has everyone's attention
for all the right reasons, songs like
"Strip" feat. Kevin McCall and
"Bassline" show that he's back to
doing what he does best: making
R&B more club-friendly than
ever. Or maybe he just has better
management.
