## SUMMERTIME SINGLES Chris Brown delivers, Maroon 5 falls flat 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Now that we're all done
vegetating after the dead
day/finals one-two
punch, a.k.a. the worst exam
schedule known to mankind, we
can get back to the important
things in life, like waking up at
the crack of dawn to jam to
Maroon 5 performing on the
Today Show (incredibly awkward
if no one else did this ...). The
beginning of summer always
brings a wave of album releases;
here are a couple of the more
memorable ones that
Intermission missed over the
break.
Chris Brown "Fortune"
There's a pretty clear shift in
hip-hop/R&B from smooth sub
tlety toward maximum blatancy;
for instance, compare "Baby Got
Back" (1992) to "Ms. New
Booty" (2006) to "Dance (Ass)"
(2011), and things may become
clear. Chris Brown is a more
innocuous culprit looking at
Big Sean's song titles at least gives
you a certain expectation for the

next four minutes. But Brown, on
the other hand, throws in songs
like "Sweet Love," which might
sound like it would be a romantic
ballad but actually belies a track
that literally begins, Baby, let's get
naked

From a more objective
standpoint, though, Brown

became famous for his sexy
crooning, and "Fortune" delivers
more of the same. The album

doesn't contain many singles
aside from "Turn Up the Music,"
but maybe that represents Brown
going in a more mature direction.
Where his two previous albums,
"Exclusive" and "F.A.M.E.," were
largely name-calling, now that
Brown has everyone's attention
for all the right reasons, songs like
"Strip" feat. Kevin McCall and
"Bassline" show that he's back to
doing what he does best: making
R&B more club-friendly than
ever. Or maybe he just has better
management.
Maroon 5 "Overexposed"
Maroon 5 hasn't, unfortu
nately, aged like a fine wine. This is
not to say that their individual tal
ents have dwindled, even consider
ing the band's recent personnel
changes in fact, judging by live
performances, Adam Levine's
voice has almost certainly grown
more powerful in the past few
years. However, they put their best
foot forward a decade ago with
"Songs about Jane," and every
Maroon 5 fan over the age of 15
(which is to say, most of them) still
awaits an equally high-quality
compilation that will almost cer
tainly never come.

"Overexposed" is the latest in
the band's tired rock-to-bubble-

gum-pop transition. There are a
couple gems; the two lead singles,

which also kick off the album, are
certainly not poignant but get the
job done as far as catchiness is

concerned. However, the effort

must have expended all their cre-

ative genius, since the eargasms are
few and far between throughout
the other dozen songs. Some are
great (which these days is synony
mous with "reminiscent of' Songs
About Jane'"), such as "Tickets"
and, particularly, "Wasted Years."
Others are actually terrible ( One in
a million/My lucky strike?

Seriously? Also, let's not talk about
the cover of Prince's "Kiss.")
"Overexposed" is worth a lis
ten; the generous ear will hear an
album with vague leanings towards
universal appeal. But don't be sur
prised if all you can make out is a

passive-aggressive attempt at cater

ing to the "new generation" a
move that wound up being swing
and a miss, since they're already
way too busy listening to Justin
Bieber's new album.
