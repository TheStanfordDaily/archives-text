## EVENTS ICC prosecutor talks justice 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
"Law is the power we have to
protect the weak and oppressed
against the strong," Fatou Ben
souda, chief prosecutor for the
International Criminal Court
(ICC) of the United Nations, told
a crowded Hewlett Auditorium
on Wednesday, June 27.
As chief prosecutor for the
ICC, Bensouda serves in a divi
sion of the United Nations that
prosecutes international crimi
nals for offenses such as geno
cide, mass rape and crimes
against humanity. She is only the
second chief prosecutor in the
court's history and the first
woman to hold the position.
The ICC seeks to provide
"one standard for all states, par
ties and the people under its pro
tection," Bensouda said.
"Wars and conflicts are no
longer the opposition of two
states or two armies," she said.
"We are no longer confined to
our town or regional or national
borders."
Originally from Gambia, Ben
souda studied and practiced law
in her home country, and was
elected deputy prosecutor of the
ICC in 2004. She was named one
of Time Magazine's 100 most in
fluential people for 2012.
The United States has had a
"schizophrenic" relationship
with the ICC, according to Helen
Stacey, a senior fellow at Stan
ford's Center for Democracy,
Development and the Rule of
Law. Stacey introduced Bensou
da and asked several questions
after her presentation.
Former President Bill Clinton
signed the treaty establishing the
ICC as he was leaving office, but
the decision was quickly reversed
when George W. Bush withdrew
in 2002. Barack Obama has pur
sued "engagement" with the ICC,
but the United States has yet to

join as a member state. Member
ship is a contentious issue, as the
ICC has jurisdictional authority
to investigate and prosecute citi
zens or residents of member na
tions for international crimes.

While taking strong stances on
issues such as criminal prosecu
tions and international justice,
Bensouda tactfully replied to
questions about the United
States' involvement.

"As an officer of the court, I
do not question why any govern
ment or any state would not join
the ICC," Bensouda said. "I think
that even without the United
States joining the ICC, I think the
ICC has already come to be one
of the relevant players in the
world in settling these interna
tional conflicts and bringing ac
countability for these crimes."

Bensouda's reluctance to
enter the political debate sur
rounding member states is part of
a wider mission to remain apolit
ical, which Bensouda said is crit
ical to the ICC's integrity.
"The ICC is a powerful new
tool to prevent crime, deter
crimes and promote national pro
ceedings," Bensouda said, "but it
will only be successful if we never
yield to political considerations."
The issue is complicated, how
ever, because the ICC has no en
forcement power and relies on
the armies and police forces of
member countries to take actions
on warrants.

Bensouda praised the now-fa
mous "Kony 2012" video several
times for the contribution it made
to raising awareness about the
crimes of Joseph Kony. The ICC
issued a warrant for Kony's arrest
in 2005, but Bensouda said it was
not until Invisible Children's
video came out that people began
to know who he was and what
crimes he had committed.

Stacey pointed out the inaccu
racies in the video, and Bensouda
readily acknowledged it was not

perfect
but said she

felt the positive impact
outweighed the negative.
Several audience members
asked about atrocities the ICC
wasn't currently investigating in
China, Syria and Mexico. While
Bensouda acknowledged the
massacre and atrocities in Syria,
she said the ICC has no authority
to investigate non-member coun
tries such as Syria and China un
less asked to do so by the United
Nations Security Council.
Unlike those two countries,
Mexico is a full member of the
ICC and thus subject to investiga
tion. In November 2011, the ICC
was asked by Mexican human
rights activists to investigate
then-President Felipe Calderon
for his actions in the war against
drug cartels. Bensouda's prede

cessor and former boss said
the ICC would not hear the com
plaint.
When asked by an audience
member whether crimes were
being investigated in Mexico,
Bensouda said the court is moni
toring the situation but no current
investigation is underway.
"We have not started actively
engaging, but we also are receiv
ing information," she said. "We
have been receiving a lot of infor
mation from everywhere about
Mexico."
"I think that's code for 'watch
this space,"' Stacey added.
The presentation was the
keynote address for the Stanford
Summer Human Rights Pro
gram's lecture series.
