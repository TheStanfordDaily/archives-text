## AMERICA THE LAND OF THE FREE (REFILLS)

If you've been keeping up with "The Newsroom,"
passed by a newsstand or even filled up your tank
in the last six to eight years, you know that
America has had its share of missteps. Sometimes we
may even feel that the only thing we've got going for
us is our extensive value menus and our can-do atti
tude, but we also have another policy in this great
nation of ours: When it's your birthday, you get a free
pass.

Why is the Fourth of July different from all other
days? On this day we truly love America. So in case
your memory has faded or you're foreign to the won
ders of this oft-woeful country, remember this: free
refills.

Yes, Europe may have a slightly better exchange
rate, less gun violence and no sales tax, but we have
free refills so that when you order your Coke for
$1.50, you know that's all you'll pay to not see the

bottom of your plastic cup until all the hot wings are
finished. The constantly flowing high fructose corn
syrup may seem a triviality, but when the heat is hot
and you've got a date to impress at the local barbecue,
that stream of ice-cold comfort is all you've got. And
that's America.

This country is almost always there for you, but
sometimes it's not. We were raised to think America
was all apple pie and handjobs, and we got to college
and realized how messed up this country can be. I
don't need to rattle off statistics to make the point that
when you dreamed of being president as a kinder
gartener, you probably weren't thinking about the fact
that when you finally turned 18, your vote wouldn't
even count that much anyway. Sometimes the Coke is
flat.

But they'll keep bringing it as long as you'll keep
drinking. And that's America. There's always room
for improvement in this great country of ours, as with
many things. And if Advanced Placement U.S.
History taught you anything, it's that the only thing
we can do about this country is change it. And we
can, and we will. As sure as the sight of that topped
off, buzzy Cola marching towards our table, we can
change America.

Excuse me, that first-person plural implied that
we are all cut of the red-white-and blue, star-spangled
and stripe-sodden cloth. Perhaps you were raised that
America was just bland, the enemy or the jock in the
locker room who thinks he can tape your buns

together with no punishment. Indeed America is all of
those, but your internationality grants you no exemp
tion. "I let my haters be my motivators," as America

always says.
What makes this night different from all another
nights? We are not black. We are not white. We are
American. We are not Christians or Jews, not Sikhs or
FSMers. We are only American. We are not
Republicans or Democrats, we are not fiscally conser
vative and socially liberal. We are Americans. We are
not even Stanford students. We are Americans.

And so what if you can see the Great Wall of
China from space? Don't forget who put the first man
there (America). So swallow up, senors, and enjoy
another one from the tap.
