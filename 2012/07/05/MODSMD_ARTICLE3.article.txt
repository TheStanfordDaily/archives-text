## Cory Booker speaks at graduation Newark mayor shares lessons from family 
### BILLY GALLAGHER EDITOR IN CHIEF 
"This University and this mo
ment fills me with a sense of grat
itude. Today is not just a day of
celebration but a day of appreci
ation," Mayor of Newark, N.J.,
Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92 said
during his keynote address to the
class of 2012 at Stanford's 121 st
Commencement.
Booker's personal speech fo
cused on his father and grandfa
ther. He also shared extensively
from his experiences in Newark.
"They taught me what it
means to be a man," Booker said
about the two men, commenting
on the overlap of Commence
ment and Father's Day. Booker
shared a joke his grandfather
told him on Booker's Stanford
graduation day.
"The tassel is worth the has
sle," he remembered, to the
crowd's laughter.
Booker framed his speech
around an idea he called "the
conspiracy of love," tying it to his
family, personal experiences,
American unity and the 2012
graduates.
He spoke about his father
growing up poor and receiving fi
nancial help from his community
to pay for his first semester at
North Carolina Central Univer
sity, and his parents' struggles to
be hired and buy a home as
African Americans in the 19605,

He explained how his father
would keep Booker's high
school success from going to his
head.

"Don't you dare walk around
this house like you hit a triple,
when you were born on third
base," Booker recalled.
While at Stanford, Booker re
ceived All Pac-10 honors
while playing tight end for the
varsity football team, volun
teered with kids in East Palo
Alto, was elected to the ASSU
Council of Presidents
and earned the James W. Lyons
Award for Service.

Booker graduated from Stan
ford in 1991 with a bachelor's de
gree in political science. He re
turned the next year to earn a
master's degree in sociology be
fore studying history at Oxford
as a Rhodes Scholar and attend
ing Yale Law School.
Booker made light of his edu
cation, by quoting his grandfa
ther on his own graduation.
"Boy you've got more de
grees than the month of July," he
quoted. "And you ain't hot! Get
a job."

Booker has served as mayor
of Newark since 2006. He was
named one of Time Magazine's
100 most influential people in
the world in 2011. He moved on
to discuss working with a tenant
leader in Newark to reform their
community.

'"The world you see outside
of you is a reflection of what's in
side of you,"' Booker recalled
her saying, as a reminder to stu
dents to recognize potential for
change.
He observed people strategiz
ing how to take care of children
in their community and help
families who missed rent pay
ments. Booker spoke about the
courage, spirit and love of these
citizens, again referring to the
"conspiracy of love."
"They embraced discomfort,"
Booker said. "They did not seek
comfort and convenience. They
went to where the challenges
were."
Booker shared an anecdote of
a community member who did

n't like the appearance of an
overgrown lot full of weeds so he
went out and spent paychecks on
a lawn mower and made the lot
look "like the White House
lawn."

"Democracy is not a specta
tor sport," he said. "It is a diffi
cult, hard, full-contact, participa
tory endeavor. This is critical.
People who get comfortable in
their spirit miss what they were
created for. They were created
to magnify the glory of the
world."
Booker then discussed dark
er parts of his time in Newark,
specifically a time when he held
a child who had been shot and
tried to help him. The child
died in Booker's arms. He
spoke about how the event
broke him as he went home and
tried to scrub the blood off his
hands.

"Of all the lessons of conspir
ators, this is the hardest for me
personally," Booker explained.
"To stay faithful in a world that
can be so cruel. I have seen
things in my life that have bro
ken me in spirit."
He then shared a more light
hearted example of making the
best of uncomfortable seating
arrangements on a flight.
"In life you get one choice
over and over again," Booker
said. "That is to take conditions
as they are or take responsibility
for changing them."
Booker closed by revealing
why the two people he framed
his speech around his father
and grandfather weren't able
to be at Commencement. His fa
ther is struggling with Parkin
son's disease and his grandfather
passed away ten years ago after
fighting with cancer. Again, he
used these personal anecdotes to
direct the class of 2012 to better
the world.

"I say to you to join the con
spiracy," Booker urged. "To be a
class of people that rejects cyni
cism ... Be lovers. Join the con
spiracy and love with all of your
heart."

According to President John
Hennessy's remarks at com
mencement, 1,763 bachelor's de
grees, 2,302 master's degrees and
1,026 doctoral degrees were con
ferred at commencement.

"To stay faithful in a world that
can be so cruel. I have seen
things in my life that have bro
ken me in spirit."
He then shared a more light
hearted example of making the
best of uncomfortable seating
arrangements on a flight.
"In life you get one choice
over and over again," Booker
said. "That is to take conditions
as they are or take responsibility
for changing them."
Booker closed by revealing
why the two people he framed
his speech around his father
and grandfather weren't able
to be at Commencement. His fa
ther is struggling with Parkin
son's disease and his grandfather
passed away ten years ago after
fighting with cancer. Again, he
used these personal anecdotes to
direct the class of 2012 to better
the world.

"I say to you to join the con
spiracy," Booker urged. "To be a
class of people that rejects cyni
cism ... Be lovers. Join the con
spiracy and love with all of your
heart."

According to President John
Hennessy's remarks at com
mencement, 1,763 bachelor's de
grees, 2,302 master's degrees and
1,026 doctoral degrees were con
ferred at commencement.

"This University and this mo
ment fills me with a sense of grat
itude. Today is not just a day of
celebration but a day of appreci
ation," Mayor of Newark, N.J.,
Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92 said
during his keynote address to the
class of 2012 at Stanford's 121 st
Commencement.
Booker's personal speech fo
cused on his father and grandfa
ther. He also shared extensively
from his experiences in Newark.
"They taught me what it
means to be a man," Booker said
about the two men, commenting
on the overlap of Commence
ment and Father's Day. Booker
shared a joke his grandfather
told him on Booker's Stanford
graduation day.
"The tassel is worth the has
sle," he remembered, to the
crowd's laughter.
Booker framed his speech
around an idea he called "the
conspiracy of love," tying it to his
family, personal experiences,
American unity and the 2012
graduates.
He spoke about his father
growing up poor and receiving fi
nancial help from his community
to pay for his first semester at
North Carolina Central Univer
sity, and his parents' struggles to
be hired and buy a home as
African Americans in the 19605,

He explained how his father
would keep Booker's high
school success from going to his
head.

"Don't you dare walk around
this house like you hit a triple,
when you were born on third
base," Booker recalled.
While at Stanford, Booker re
ceived All Pac-10 honors
while playing tight end for the
varsity football team, volun
teered with kids in East Palo
Alto, was elected to the ASSU
Council of Presidents
and earned the James W. Lyons
Award for Service.

Booker graduated from Stan
ford in 1991 with a bachelor's de
gree in political science. He re
turned the next year to earn a
master's degree in sociology be
fore studying history at Oxford
as a Rhodes Scholar and attend
ing Yale Law School.
Booker made light of his edu
cation, by quoting his grandfa
ther on his own graduation.
"Boy you've got more de
grees than the month of July," he
quoted. "And you ain't hot! Get
a job."

Booker has served as mayor
of Newark since 2006. He was
named one of Time Magazine's
100 most influential people in
the world in 2011. He moved on
to discuss working with a tenant
leader in Newark to reform their
community.

'"The world you see outside
of you is a reflection of what's in
side of you,"' Booker recalled
her saying, as a reminder to stu
dents to recognize potential for
change.
He observed people strategiz
ing how to take care of children
in their community and help
families who missed rent pay
ments. Booker spoke about the
courage, spirit and love of these
citizens, again referring to the
"conspiracy of love."
"They embraced discomfort,"
Booker said. "They did not seek
comfort and convenience. They
went to where the challenges
were."
Booker shared an anecdote of
a community member who did

n't like the appearance of an
overgrown lot full of weeds so he
went out and spent paychecks on
a lawn mower and made the lot
look "like the White House
lawn."

"Democracy is not a specta
tor sport," he said. "It is a diffi
cult, hard, full-contact, participa
tory endeavor. This is critical.
People who get comfortable in
their spirit miss what they were
created for. They were created
to magnify the glory of the
world."
Booker then discussed dark
er parts of his time in Newark,
specifically a time when he held
a child who had been shot and
tried to help him. The child
died in Booker's arms. He
spoke about how the event
broke him as he went home and
tried to scrub the blood off his
hands.

"Of all the lessons of conspir
ators, this is the hardest for me
personally," Booker explained.
"To stay faithful in a world that
can be so cruel. I have seen
things in my life that have bro
ken me in spirit."
He then shared a more light
