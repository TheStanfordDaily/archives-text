## Summer Session bans hard alcohol on campus 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students who moved into the
dorms for the summer were wel
comed back with an email in
forming them that a new alcohol
policy would be enforced during
the duration of this year's Stan
ford Summer Session.

The email, sent by Assistant
Dean of Stanford Summer Ses
sion Jess Matthews, warned stu
dents that the storage or con
sumption of hard liquor would
not be tolerated in dorms during
the summer. The new policy de
fines hard liquor as "any alcoholic
beverage with an alcohol content
20 percent or greater (40 proof or
above). Examples include vodka,
rum and whiskey." The policy ap
plies to all summer residents, re
gardless of age.
Those over the legal drinking
age of 21 are allowed to be in pos
session of beer and wine but are
subject to the same consequences
as their underage dormmates if
they are found with hard alcohol.
This differs from the alcohol pol

icy enforced during the regular
academic year, which does not
place restrictions on students
who are 21 and older.

"This change is a product of
several factors," Matthews said.
"Summer Session is a short, in
tensive academic experience,
which means that we implement
unique policies in order to foster
an academic environment and
support students so that they can
be successful."
Students who are found to be in
possession of hard alcohol will be
asked to pour it out immediately
and will be subject to a conversa
tion with residential staff regarding
ways in which they can avoid fur
ther policy violations. Additional
repercussions will be determined
on a case-by-case basis.

While summer resident assis
tants are expected to enforce the
policy, they are not being told to
search specifically for hard
liquor, Matthews said.
The new policy, which was de
veloped in conjunction with the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Ed
ucation (OAPE), stems from the

concern that most of the negative
consequences associated with al
cohol during the school year are
recorded as having been the di
rect result of hard liquor con
sumption. The email that was
sent to students cites hard alcohol
as the primary contributor to 100
percent of emergency room
transports and 80 percent of be
havioral issues and police cita
tions during the academic year.
According to data compiled
by the Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS), the Stanford campus
saw a 45 percent increase in med
ical alcohol transports this school
year over to last year, resulting in
a total of 77 alcohol transports be
tween September 2011 and April
2012. Data on the number of
Summer Session transports has
not been tracked by the OAPE.
The shortened length of the
summer session in comparison to
the rest of the academic school
year is also being cited as a reason
for the change in policy.

"We don't have the same
amount of time in which to do

community norming," Matthews
said, "so our policy changes can
be perceived as more top-down
than those that occur during the
other three quarters."
Despite the OAPE's advisory
role in constructing this new poli
cy, there are no plans to imple
ment the change during the regu
lar school year.
"This is only a Summer Ses
sion policy," confirmed Associ
ate Dean of Student Affairs
Ralph Castro in an email to The
Daily.

Dean Castro is, however, in
terested in seeing how the policy
plays out over the course of the
summer. He plans on discussing
its outcome with the Summer
Session staff and would like to
hear from students regarding
their thoughts on the policy and
its effectiveness.

Students with further ques
tions or concerns can speak with
their RAs, house directors or Jess
Matthews for more information.
