# STUDENT LIFE
## Habla facilitates language learning between students, janitors 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The mention of Stanford often
calls to mind great weather, care
free undergrads on bikes and
world-class professors. But there's
another group of people who work
hard to make sure the University is
as clean as its image, and the janito
rial staff here rarely gets much at
tention.

One student-led organization is
working to change that.

For two hours a week, Stanford
janitorial staff members attend an
English-language literacy class run
by the student organization Habla.
There, they practice their conversa
tional skills and build confidence in
their English-speaking abilities.
Supported by the Building Skills
Partnership and in collaboration
with the Palo Alto Adult School,
Habla hopes to empower adult jan
itors and other low-income workers
at Stanford by teaching them Eng

lish-language literacy and conver
sational skills.
Habla offers two sessions of the
class, intended to accommodate the
two shifts of janitorial staff that
work on campus during the acade
mic year: Nocrie, or "night" in Span
ish, and D/a, "day." Tutoring ses
sions are held twice per week for an
hour at a time. The Noche session is
held late at night and Dfa at
lunchtime in El Centro Chicano,
near Old Union, but Habla has also
started to offer a smaller session on
the Row.

The unique program is built on a
model for one-on-one tutoring be
tween Stanford students and the
janitorial staff who participate, pair
ing the volunteers with interested
staff on campus. Student volunteers
aren't required to have any tutoring
experience, just basic Spanish lan
guage and comprehension skills.

"One-on-one interaction is the
core part of Habla," said Adelaide
Oneal 'l2, the outreach and com

munity events coordinator for
Habla. Oneal has been tutoring for
Habla since her freshman year in
the spring of 2008.
"It's very helpful for the workers
to learn one-to-one and go at their
own pace," she said.
Developing a meaningful
friendship through the teaching
process between the Stanford stu
dents and janitors is highly encour
aged, and tutors often learn a great
deal about one another's interests,
families, backgrounds and stories.
"Habla has provided a really
unique experience to get to know
Stanford janitors, a community that
most people don't interact with,"
said Oneal, who still maintains a
good relationship with a member of
the janitorial staff and past tutee.
"Even after I went to study
abroad and he switched to a differ
ent tutor, we still kept in touch," she
said. "He was like a fatherly figure
who checked up on me to see if I
was doing okay and calling my par

ents."
Oneal explained that she joined
Habla because she was interested in
an organization that made a differ
ence to the unsung heroes of Stan
ford campus. She believes that her
work is significant because it pro
vides students with an opportunity
to engage with these staff while
leaving a positive impact on their
lives, since many of them struggle
with English.
"A lot of them don't feel pre
pared to use English," she said.
"Speaking English might not seem
too intimidating but it's different
when you don't have a grasp of the
language, and it's great that Habla
is trying to help people with some
thing that is really concrete."

However, the tutors are not the
only learning support provided for
the janitorial staff-turned-students;
group instruction and structured
activities are also held during these
one-hour sessions. Each class starts
with a 15-minute introductory les
son by Sara Tevis, a teacher from the
Palo Alto Adult School who has
taught English to adult learners
since 2001. Following this short
group lesson, tutor-tutee pairs break
up into smaller groups, later coming
back together to conclude the les
son.

Classes are mostly focused
around workplace English but can
also be applied in other situations,

such as parent-teacher interviews
and doctors' visits. Tutors and tutees
have a great deal of flexibility in
what and how they learn; they talk
about music, sports, politics or even
the weather.

Aside from these group ses
sions, Flabla seeks to connect the
student and the janitorial commu
nities at Stanford, fostering inte
gration of all on campus and bridg
ing the divides. Habla events have
included potluck brunches, a
Valentine's Day card-making
party and even a small graduation
party at the end of the year.
"A program of this nature is not
without its unique set of chal
lenges," said Nick Cariello 'l3, a Dia

coordinator. "English learning can
be a frustrating and difficult process,
but the tenacity, patience and posi
tive attitudes of both our workers
and tutors continue to amaze me."

Both Oneal and Cariello agree
that it is truly the people that have
made Habla such a rewarding pro
gram for both Stanford students and
janitorial staff.

"You learn so much some of
them are working multiple jobs,
have families to take care of," Oneal
said. "Yet they still commit two
hours every week to practice Eng
lish. It's so inspiring."
