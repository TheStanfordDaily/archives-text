# OPINIONS
## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Respect ROTC's commitment 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Yesterday marked the 236 th
year of this nation's indepen
dence, a day celebrated, in
true American style, by loud explo
sions and cheap beer. But another
milestone went by this spring, less
widely remarked but of great impor
tance to this campus: it has been a lit
tle more than one year since the Fac
ulty Senate voted to allow the return
of ROTC, or Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps, to Stanford for the first
time since 1970.

One year later, we have made lit
tle progress toward recognizing and
appreciating the students on this
campus all too few who have
chosen to serve their country by en
listing in the armed forces. We owe
them better than that.
Zero. Seven. Zero. Four. The
month and day we loudly celebrate
this country's freedom every year.
But also, in that order: the number
of buildings on this campus dedicat
ed to military veterans or military
personnel; the recent number of un
dergraduate campus veterans, out
of a student body of some 6,600; the
number of ROTC classes cadets can
currently take at Stanford; and the
number of tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan one particularly elo

quent veteran told me about, in har
rowing detail.
Instead of recognizing the
unique contribution members of the
military make to our community, we
have long exiled their programs and
training from campus and fought a
bitter battle to keep them out. In
stead of giving them a community
and dedicated space, we have pick
eted their 7 a.m. morning workouts
with denunciations of imperialism.
There are very good reasons to
oppose military action abroad. This
is not the time for me to list them.
But soldiers volunteer to protect
and defend their country; they don't
get to decide when or where.
I don't know everything about
the growing disconnect between cit
izen and soldier. But in my spring
quarter class on global justice two
years ago, it was a military veteran
who spoke most perceptively and
most thoughtfully about the ethics
of war and humanitarian interven
tion. And I do know that in my his
tory class on the background of cur
rent global problems, it was an
ROTC cadet who delivered a pre
sentation on crucial military aspects
of the U.S.-China diplomatic rela
tionship that the rest of us knew

nothing about.
I do know that this year.
Sergeant Chris Clark wrote one of
the best op-eds I have ever read,
about his experience on a dirt road
somewhere in Iraq. I do know that
our Stanford military personnel are
people I would be proud to see lead
ing my country, in war or in peace, I
do know that I cannot truly know
the sacrifice it takes to leave one's
family and board a plane, never
knowing if you'll see them again.
So let's argue about the ethics of
humanitarian intervention. Let's
oppose American global imperial
ism. Let's take as many steps as pos
sible toward the world peace we all
seek.

But let's also remember, recog
nize and appreciate the men and
women on this campus who contin
ue to ensure that we can celebrate
the Fourth of July and the liber
ties and freedoms it represents to us
all next year, and the year after
that, and after that. We owe our fel
low students no less.
