Is Spain the new Germany? Is
Germany the new Spain? When
Germany played the Nether
lands back at the start of Euro 2012, a
Germany-supporting friend asked
why I refused to cheer for his team,
especially since I don't have any
Dutch friends. The answer isn't any

rolling down her cheeks, evoked a
touch of empathy. In its guise as ei

country has three World Cups and
three European Championships to
its name, but it hasn't won a single
title for the last sixteen years even
