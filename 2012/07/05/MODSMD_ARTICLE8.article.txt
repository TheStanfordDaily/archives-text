## ROLE REVERSAL 
### Tom Taylor 
Is Spain the new Germany? Is
Germany the new Spain? When
Germany played the Nether
lands back at the start of Euro 2012, a
Germany-supporting friend asked
why I refused to cheer for his team,
especially since I don't have any
Dutch friends. The answer isn't any
lasting prejudice against Germans
over the two major wars fought
against them last century. We Euro
peans have spent millennia fighting
each other, so it's hard to hold some
thing as insignificant as a couple of
wars against them.
No, apart from some resentment
at the regularity with which Germany
knocks England out of international
tournaments, the reason is that Ger
man fans simply don't know what it
feels like. They don't understand
what it is like to put all of your coun
try's hopes and dreams into a soccer
game and fail, again and again. Or, at
least, they didn't.

The Dutch understand. I'm not
convinced they feel it quite as painful
ly as the English; they didn't invent
the game, and though they have
never won a World Cup, they were
European champions as recently as
1988 and ranked No. 1 by FIFA last
summer. Nonetheless, I know the
way their team crashed out of this
year's tournament must cut deeply.
However, as I gleefully watched
the highlights of Italy's 2-1 win over
Germany last Thursday, I began to
feel a little guilty. The image of a Ger
man fan, decked out in her national
colors, looking distraught, with tears
rolling down her cheeks, evoked a
touch of empathy. In its guise as ei
ther West Germany or Germany, the
country has three World Cups and
three European Championships to
its name, but it hasn't won a single
title for the last sixteen years even
though it has reached three semifi
nals and two finals in that time. The
young and exciting team that hinted
at a bright future a few years ago still
has time to turn this around, but the
clock has started ticking. Could Ger
many's golden generation end up
with nothing more than silver or
bronze?

Spain used to know the feeling.
We English used to be able to com
miserate with our Iberian cousins.
Though the Spanish had often boast
ed talent, a lone European Champi
onship in 1964 had been their only
success until 2008. The team had al
ways flattered to deceive, reaching
just a single final in that period.
Not anymore, though. By win
ning the final of Euro 2012 on Sun
day, Spain took its winning streak to
three tournaments, coming on the
heels of its victories in Euro 2008 and
the 2010 World Cup. In doing so, it
becomes the first country to win
three consecutive international titles.
Note that, even though the Copa
America is played more frequently
than the European Championship,
no South American team has yet
managed to achieve this not even
the holy trinity of Argentina, Brazil
and Uruguay, with their combined
total of nine World Cups and 37
Copa Americas.
Eveiyone loves rooting for an un
derdog, but Spain is certainly not that
anymore. In fact, the current group of

players can make a serious claim to be
the best team in soccer history. The
style they play is hard to classify as ex
citing, but it is breathtakingly good.
Some teams are more aggressive and
rain down shots on goal. Spain just
takes its time, carefully retaining pos
session while looking for that perfect
chance, spurning opportunities that
lesser teams would kill for. Faced with
this, some of the worlds best players
are completely neutralized, unable to
even touch the ball.

I'm not quite sure I can yet start
openly cheering for Germany. After
all, it is only on a short 16-year streak
of international failure and can still
count on having won six trophies.
Compared to England's 46-year title
drought and lone World Cup, that
hardly seems like a bad run. It's also
hard to shake the image of Germany
ending English dreams at countless
tournaments.

But I'm not sure I can keep sup
porting Spain. For a start, it probably
doesn't need my help. It's probably
going to win the World Cup in Brazil
in two years regardless of who I root
for. And while it hasn't yet managed
to cross over and join the axis-of-evil
of Germany and Argentina, all this
success just seems a bit distasteful. At
the very least they could take a leaf
out of France's book and hit the self
destruct button from time to time.

Sorry Spain, you're on your own
now.

Tom Taylor can only dream that
England will somehow win a major
tournament in his lifetime. Sympa

heels of its victories in Euro 2008 and
the 2010 World Cup. In doing so, it
becomes the first country to win
three consecutive international titles.
Note that, even though the Copa
America is played more frequently
than the European Championship,
no South American team has yet
managed to achieve this not even
the holy trinity of Argentina, Brazil
and Uruguay, with their combined
total of nine World Cups and 37
Copa Americas.
Eveiyone loves rooting for an un
derdog, but Spain is certainly not that
anymore. In fact, the current group of

players can make a serious claim to be
the best team in soccer history. The
style they play is hard to classify as ex
citing, but it is breathtakingly good.
Some teams are more aggressive and
rain down shots on goal. Spain just
takes its time, carefully retaining pos
session while looking for that perfect
chance, spurning opportunities that
lesser teams would kill for. Faced with
this, some of the worlds best players
are completely neutralized, unable to
even touch the ball.

I'm not quite sure I can yet start
openly cheering for Germany. After
all, it is only on a short 16-year streak
of international failure and can still
count on having won six trophies.
Compared to England's 46-year title
drought and lone World Cup, that
hardly seems like a bad run. It's also
hard to shake the image of Germany
ending English dreams at countless
tournaments.

But I'm not sure I can keep sup
porting Spain. For a start, it probably
doesn't need my help. It's probably
going to win the World Cup in Brazil
in two years regardless of who I root
for. And while it hasn't yet managed
to cross over and join the axis-of-evil
of Germany and Argentina, all this
success just seems a bit distasteful. At
the very least they could take a leaf
out of France's book and hit the self
destruct button from time to time.

Sorry Spain, you're on your own
now.

Tom Taylor can only dream that
England will somehow win a major
tournament in his lifetime. Sympa

Is Spain the new Germany? Is
Germany the new Spain? When
Germany played the Nether
lands back at the start of Euro 2012, a
Germany-supporting friend asked
why I refused to cheer for his team,
especially since I don't have any
Dutch friends. The answer isn't any
lasting prejudice against Germans
over the two major wars fought
against them last century. We Euro
peans have spent millennia fighting
each other, so it's hard to hold some
thing as insignificant as a couple of
wars against them.
No, apart from some resentment
at the regularity with which Germany
knocks England out of international
tournaments, the reason is that Ger
man fans simply don't know what it
feels like. They don't understand
what it is like to put all of your coun
try's hopes and dreams into a soccer
game and fail, again and again. Or, at
least, they didn't.

The Dutch understand. I'm not
convinced they feel it quite as painful
ly as the English; they didn't invent
the game, and though they have
never won a World Cup, they were
European champions as recently as
1988 and ranked No. 1 by FIFA last
summer. Nonetheless, I know the
way their team crashed out of this
year's tournament must cut deeply.
However, as I gleefully watched
the highlights of Italy's 2-1 win over
Germany last Thursday, I began to
feel a little guilty. The image of a Ger
man fan, decked out in her national
colors, looking distraught, with tears
rolling down her cheeks, evoked a
touch of empathy. In its guise as ei
ther West Germany or Germany, the
country has three World Cups and
three European Championships to
its name, but it hasn't won a single
title for the last sixteen years even
though it has reached three semifi
nals and two finals in that time. The
young and exciting team that hinted
at a bright future a few years ago still
has time to turn this around, but the
clock has started ticking. Could Ger
many's golden generation end up
with nothing more than silver or
bronze?

Spain used to know the feeling.
We English used to be able to com
miserate with our Iberian cousins.
Though the Spanish had often boast
ed talent, a lone European Champi
onship in 1964 had been their only
success until 2008. The team had al
ways flattered to deceive, reaching
just a single final in that period.
Not anymore, though. By win
ning the final of Euro 2012 on Sun
day, Spain took its winning streak to
three tournaments, coming on the
heels of its victories in Euro 2008 and
the 2010 World Cup. In doing so, it
becomes the first country to win
three consecutive international titles.
