# BIG QUAKES
## San Jose defeats L.A. 4-3 in Saturday's tightly contested match at Stanford Stadium 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday night, Stanford
Stadium played host to a different
sort of football.

Though the yard lines were still
clearly visible under green paint, the
stands were packed with soccer fans
massed to watch the San Jose Earth
quakes defeat the Los Angeles
Galaxy 4-3 in a heated rivalry game.

That the Quakes went into the
break trailing the Galaxy 2-3 seemed
against the run of play for much of
the first half. San Jose made several
scything runs and passes through the
Southern Califomian team's de
fense, with Quakes striker Steven
Lenhart scoring the first goal of the
contest and threatening more. Mis
takes, though, almost proved costly.

A dangerous free kick conceded
just outside the box allowed L.A.
midfielder David Beckham to level
the match, and an own goal by de
fender Jason Hernandez gave the
Galaxy the lead. Confusion and a
poor back pass then led to L.A.'s
third tally, as striker Landon Dono
van pounced and the vocal San Jose
fans were silenced.
For the second time this year,
though, the Quakes came back from
a two-goal deficit against the Galaxy.
A goal either side of halftime, thanks
to defender Victor Bernardez and
midfielder Sam Cronin, brought
them level before striker Chris Won
dolowski's deft back heel in the 61st
minute sealed the contest.

The win gives the Quakes a four
point lead in the Western Division
and opens a 16-point gap over the
Galaxy, the reigning MLS Cup
champions.

More than that, though, the con
test reinforced perhaps the MLS's
biggest rivalry, the California Qasi
co. These two teams have faced each
other more than any other teams in
the league, but a two-year hiatus
broke the NorCal/SoCal battle when
San Jose's original franchise was
moved to Houston.

"I think the rivalry's back," said
Los Angeles Galaxy left back Todd
Dunivant 'O2. "Both teams are com
petitive for the championship again,
and I think that's a big part of it. The
Earthquakes obviously left for a cou
ple of years and as an expansion
team kind of built their team back
up. And now they're at the top of the
table, so I think that's going to add a
lot of heat to the rivalry and as we
continue to climb the standings, you
know it'll be a good matchup."
He should know, too. Since grad
uating from the Farm, Dunivant has
played for both teams.

Returning to Stanford, he was
greeted by 50391 mostly hostile fans
in a sold-out Stanford Stadium, al
most double the capacity of L.A.'s
home field.

"It's amazing," Dunivant said. "It
was a great night for soccer in the Bay
Area and particularly for Stanford. I
saw the women's soccer team, the
Stanford women's team, at the na

tional championship on the side. It
made me a little jealous we didn't
quite get that on the men's side. I was
happy for them and it's great to see
this here at Stanford and it's a great
event. I wish we could come back
again this year."
