## Going the distance 
### KAREN FENG DAILY INTERN 
Chris Derrick has had a good
run. The 2012 graduate received a
degree in economics with a focus
in law and has become one of the
most decorated distance runners
in Stanford history.
But it wasn't always that way.
Until high school, Derrick played
basketball and baseball but found
that his lack of ability left him at a
dead end. Fearing that he would
n't participate in any activities in
high school, his parents forced
him to take part in a cross-country
summer camp. One practice later,
he knew he had found his sport.
He improved drastically
throughout his high-school career
at Neuqua Valley High School in
Naperville, 111., to become the
2007 Gatorade National Boys
Cross-Country Runner of the
Year, the 2008 Nike Cross Na
tionals individual and team cham
pion and the 2008 Illinois cross
country state champion. Derrick
broke the record for the high
school-only 5,000 meters with a
time of 13:55.96.

Derrick solidified his place in
Stanford lore with records of
13:19.58 in the indoor 5,000,
7:46.81 in the indoor 3,000 and
27:31.38 in the 10,000. Additional
ly, he is a 14-time All-American in
cross-country and track and field,

a three-time NCAA runner-up
and one of only six men to place in
the top 10 at the NCAA Cross
country Championship for four
consecutive years.

At the beginning of his final
year at Stanford, he considered
making the U.S. Olympic team as
a possibility but never thought
that he would get as close as he
did. Derrick's bid for a spot on the
team soon became an attainable
reality, as he ran two Olympic
qualifying "A" times early in the
season for the 5,000 and 10,000, at
the Millrose Games in February
and the Pay ton Jordan Cardinal
Invitational in May, respectively.
His 10,000 time of 27:31.38 made
him a favorite to make the U.S.
team, as it set an American colle
giate record and was the fastest
time run by an American going
into the Olympic trials this sea
son.

Despite his early successes,
Derrick's hectic schedule as a
graduating senior, coupled with a
heavy running regimen and foot
injury late in the season, began to
wear on his performance. He fin
ished his collegiate career running
the 10,000 at the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships
on June 6 at Drake Stadium in
Des Moines, lowa. He put up a
fight with leaders Cam Levins and
