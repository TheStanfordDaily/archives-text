## Going the distance 
### KAREN FENG DAILY INTERN 
Chris Derrick has had a good
run. The 2012 graduate received a
degree in economics with a focus
in law and has become one of the
most decorated distance runners
in Stanford history.
But it wasn't always that way.
Until high school, Derrick played
basketball and baseball but found
that his lack of ability left him at a
dead end. Fearing that he would
n't participate in any activities in
high school, his parents forced
him to take part in a cross-country
summer camp. One practice later,
he knew he had found his sport.
He improved drastically
throughout his high-school career
at Neuqua Valley High School in
Naperville, 111., to become the
2007 Gatorade National Boys
Cross-Country Runner of the
Year, the 2008 Nike Cross Na
tionals individual and team cham
pion and the 2008 Illinois cross
country state champion. Derrick
broke the record for the high
school-only 5,000 meters with a
time of 13:55.96.

Derrick solidified his place in
Stanford lore with records of
13:19.58 in the indoor 5,000,
7:46.81 in the indoor 3,000 and
27:31.38 in the 10,000. Additional
ly, he is a 14-time All-American in
cross-country and track and field,

a three-time NCAA runner-up
and one of only six men to place in
the top 10 at the NCAA Cross
country Championship for four
consecutive years.

At the beginning of his final
year at Stanford, he considered
making the U.S. Olympic team as
a possibility but never thought
that he would get as close as he
did. Derrick's bid for a spot on the
team soon became an attainable
reality, as he ran two Olympic
qualifying "A" times early in the
season for the 5,000 and 10,000, at
the Millrose Games in February
and the Pay ton Jordan Cardinal
Invitational in May, respectively.
His 10,000 time of 27:31.38 made
him a favorite to make the U.S.
team, as it set an American colle
giate record and was the fastest
time run by an American going
into the Olympic trials this sea
son.

Despite his early successes,
Derrick's hectic schedule as a
graduating senior, coupled with a
heavy running regimen and foot
injury late in the season, began to
wear on his performance. He fin
ished his collegiate career running
the 10,000 at the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships
on June 6 at Drake Stadium in
Des Moines, lowa. He put up a
fight with leaders Cam Levins and

runners in both Stanford and NCAA history as a 14-time All-American.
Stephen Sambu and stayed with
the front of the pack with one lap to
go but was outkicked mentally and
physically, falling back as Levins
and Sambu finished in 28:07.14 and
28:09.52, respectively. Derrick's
disappointing third-place finish
with a time of 28:17.28 capped his
streak of never winning an NCAA
championship.

Following the race. Levins high
lighted Derrick's success and apol
ogized in an interview with Flo
track.

"I'm sorry to Chris," Levins
said. "It's his last race; he's definite
ly the best collegiate to never win
an NCAA title. I'm sorry to have
taken that away from him. I know
he wanted it so badly."
But Derrick's loss didn't pre
vent him from trying to reach his
ultimate goal. On the rainy evening
of June 22, Derrick surged back to
run the 10,000-meter final at the
Olympic track and field trials at

Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore.
"I just wanted to do the type of
race that would get me an 'A' stan
dard and go fast and hope that I
would get in the top three," Derrick
said. "But I didn't run too different
ly from normal. I just stayed with
the leaders as long as possible."
The race began according to
plan: He moved from the back of
the pack to fifth and planned to
battle it out with Matt Tegenkamp
as they ran 5,000 meters together.
With 10 laps to go, however,
Tegenkamp picked up the pace
and made a bid for third, creating a

gap that Derrick struggled to fill, as
he finally came in fourth with a
time of 27:40.23, behind Galen
Rupp (27:25.33), Tegenkamp
(27:33.94) and Dathan Ritzenhein
(27:36.09).
"I felt like it was a pretty good
race, given the chances at the end
of a very long collegiate season,"
Derrick said. "My body was pretty
worn down and my foot was in
jured, but it was a good effort. It
still was a bit of a lost opportunity,
but I'm not too disappointed."
Despite not making the
Olympic team and having an ag

gravated foot injury that kept him
out of the 5,000, Derrick remains
optimistic. He is the main alternate
for the U.S. team if any of the top
three finishers are unable to com
pete at London, and he plans to go
professional and get a sponsorship
following this season. And the 21-
year-old has not given up on the
Olympics yet.
"I plan to run and train and
hopefully be around in another
four, eight years," Derrick said.

did. Derrick's bid for a spot on the
team soon became an attainable
reality, as he ran two Olympic
qualifying "A" times early in the
season for the 5,000 and 10,000, at
the Millrose Games in February
and the Pay ton Jordan Cardinal
Invitational in May, respectively.
His 10,000 time of 27:31.38 made
him a favorite to make the U.S.
team, as it set an American colle
giate record and was the fastest
time run by an American going
into the Olympic trials this sea
son.

Despite his early successes,
Derrick's hectic schedule as a
graduating senior, coupled with a
heavy running regimen and foot
injury late in the season, began to
wear on his performance. He fin
ished his collegiate career running
the 10,000 at the NCAA Outdoor
Track and Field Championships
on June 6 at Drake Stadium in
Des Moines, lowa. He put up a
fight with leaders Cam Levins and

runners in both Stanford and NCAA history as a 14-time All-American.
Stephen Sambu and stayed with
the front of the pack with one lap to
go but was outkicked mentally and
physically, falling back as Levins
and Sambu finished in 28:07.14 and
28:09.52, respectively. Derrick's
disappointing third-place finish
with a time of 28:17.28 capped his
streak of never winning an NCAA
championship.

Following the race. Levins high
lighted Derrick's success and apol
ogized in an interview with Flo
track.

"I'm sorry to Chris," Levins
said. "It's his last race; he's definite
ly the best collegiate to never win
an NCAA title. I'm sorry to have
taken that away from him. I know
he wanted it so badly."
But Derrick's loss didn't pre
vent him from trying to reach his
ultimate goal. On the rainy evening
of June 22, Derrick surged back to
run the 10,000-meter final at the
Olympic track and field trials at

Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore.
"I just wanted to do the type of
race that would get me an 'A' stan
dard and go fast and hope that I
would get in the top three," Derrick
said. "But I didn't run too different
ly from normal. I just stayed with
the leaders as long as possible."
The race began according to
plan: He moved from the back of
the pack to fifth and planned to
battle it out with Matt Tegenkamp
as they ran 5,000 meters together.
With 10 laps to go, however,
Tegenkamp picked up the pace
and made a bid for third, creating a

gap that Derrick struggled to fill, as
he finally came in fourth with a
time of 27:40.23, behind Galen
Rupp (27:25.33), Tegenkamp
(27:33.94) and Dathan Ritzenhein
(27:36.09).
"I felt like it was a pretty good
race, given the chances at the end
of a very long collegiate season,"
Derrick said. "My body was pretty
worn down and my foot was in
jured, but it was a good effort. It
still was a bit of a lost opportunity,
but I'm not too disappointed."
Despite not making the
Olympic team and having an ag

gravated foot injury that kept him
out of the 5,000, Derrick remains
optimistic. He is the main alternate
for the U.S. team if any of the top
three finishers are unable to com
pete at London, and he plans to go
professional and get a sponsorship
following this season. And the 21-
year-old has not given up on the
Olympics yet.
"I plan to run and train and
hopefully be around in another
four, eight years," Derrick said.

Chris Derrick has had a good
run. The 2012 graduate received a
degree in economics with a focus
in law and has become one of the
most decorated distance runners
in Stanford history.
But it wasn't always that way.
Until high school, Derrick played
basketball and baseball but found
that his lack of ability left him at a
dead end. Fearing that he would
n't participate in any activities in
high school, his parents forced
him to take part in a cross-country
summer camp. One practice later,
he knew he had found his sport.
He improved drastically
throughout his high-school career
at Neuqua Valley High School in
Naperville, 111., to become the
2007 Gatorade National Boys
Cross-Country Runner of the
Year, the 2008 Nike Cross Na
tionals individual and team cham
pion and the 2008 Illinois cross
country state champion. Derrick
broke the record for the high
school-only 5,000 meters with a
time of 13:55.96.

Derrick solidified his place in
Stanford lore with records of
13:19.58 in the indoor 5,000,
7:46.81 in the indoor 3,000 and
27:31.38 in the 10,000. Additional
ly, he is a 14-time All-American in
cross-country and track and field,

a three-time NCAA runner-up
and one of only six men to place in
the top 10 at the NCAA Cross
country Championship for four
consecutive years.

At the beginning of his final
year at Stanford, he considered
making the U.S. Olympic team as
a possibility but never thought
that he would get as close as he
did. Derrick's bid for a spot on the
team soon became an attainable
