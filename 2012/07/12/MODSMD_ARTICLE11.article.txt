## Gibbs falls to Serena Williams; Burdette to face Marion Bartoli 
### KAREN FENG DAILY INTERN 
This year's Bank of the West
Classic features the top two Amer
ican collegiate tennis players play
ing on their home court. Earlier this
season, rising junior Nicole Gibbs
and rising senior Mallory Burdette
established themselves as top con

tenders in a historic Cardinal sweep
of the NCAA Championships final
in May. Gibbs and Burdette won
the doubles draw and placed as
champion and runner-up, respec
tively, in singles.

Both earned wild-card berths
for the Classic. On Tuesday, Gibbs
faced qualifier Noppawan
Lertcheewakarn of Thailand (No.

162 in the world) at 11 a.m. After
trailing 2-0, Gibbs recovered to
take the first set 6-4 and battled
through consecutive ties to take the
second set 6-4 for her first Women's
Tennis Association win.

That evening at 7 p.m., Burdette
took on No. 77 Anne Keothavong
of Britain. She lost the first set 6-2
but bounced back to battle out the

second and third set 7-5 and 6-4, re
spectively, for another Cardinal
win.

With their singles wins, both
qualified for the second round, with
Gibbs facing first-seeded Serena
Williams (No. 4 in the world)
Wednesday and Burdette facing
second-seeded Marion Bartoli (No.
10 in the world) Thursday. Both
were also selected to play in the dou
bles draw against third-seeded team
Natalie Grandin and Vladimira Uh
lirova on Wednesday afternoon.
At 3:25 p.m., Gibbs and defend
ing champion Serena Williams,
fresh off her fifth Wimbledon title
this past Saturday, walked onto the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium hard
courts to thunderous applause.
Williams easily took a 4-0 lead in the
first set with her signature powerful
serves and groundstrokes, but
Gibbs held on to take a game from
Williams to move the set to 4-1 as
the crowd roared. Williams took the
next game, but then two straight er
rors by the favorite made it 5-2.
There were cheers of "Go Gibbsy!"

as groups of Stanford fans were refu
eled by Gibbs's potential comeback.
One more back-and-forth game
closed the first set 6-2 in favor of
Williams.

In the second set, Williams took
five straight games as Gibbs strug
gled against her power and started
making unforced errors near the
end of games. In a dramatic sixth
game served by Williams, Gibbs
took the lead 40-15 and almost lost it
as a frustrated and rejuvenated
Williams took the advantage. Two
unforced errors, however, gave
Gibbs her first break of the match. A
final Williams-dominated game
earned her a 6-1 victory. Both sets
took 62 minutes.

At the post-game press confer
ence, Williams seemed impressed.
"It's good to see promising
young American players coming
up," Williams said. "She's a fighter,
and that's important."

Gibbs moved on after her loss to
compete in the doubles match with

Burdette at 5:40 p.m. on Court 6.
The first set featured extremely
close games, with the teams tied at 6-
6. The tiebreaker, too, was tied at 3-
3 untO Grandin and Uhlirova made
a break for it, leading 6-3 and even
tually winning it 7-5.
The second set featured an early
2-0 lead by Burdette and Gibbs,
though they would eventually give
back ground as Grandin and Uhliro
va puUed up to tie the set at 3-3.
Three straight games by Burdette
and Gibbs gave them the second set
6-3, evening the match and sending
it to a decisive final set.

The third set was dominated by
Grandin and Uhlirova, who won the
deciding set 10-6, defeating the Car
dinal duo 7-6(5), 3-6,10-6.

Burdette will face the No. 2 seed
of the tournament, Marion Bartoli,
this afternoon in the singles draw at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
