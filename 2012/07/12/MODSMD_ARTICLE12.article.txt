# LOYALTY STILL EXISTS

Devastation. If you're a
Celtics or Suns fan, that's
probably the best word to
describe what happened last week.
As you watched your beloved stars
announce their decisions to join
teams that you've no doubt grown
to hate with a violent passion, all
you could do was shake your head
in disbelief.

Ray Allen to the Heat. Steve
Nash to the Lakers. Even if you're
not a Celtics or Suns fan, you still
must have asked, "How the hell
did that happen?"
So how the hell did it happen?
In June, Nash wasn't even sure
that he would be leaving Phoenix.
But on Independence Day, three
days after Lakers general manager
Mitch Kupchak contacted Nash,
the 38-year-old veteran point
guard's move to the City of Angels
was finalized. A mere two days
later, Allen agreed to a two-year,
$6.3 million contract with the
Heat, despite the fact that the
Celtics offered twice as much.
The sudden nature of these
moves made them all the more
baffling. Nash is joining a long
standing conference foe with
which he's had a heated playoff
history. Likewise, Allen is signing
with a team that ended his NBA
playoff run the past two seasons.
And I can't be the only one who
thinks that Allen in a Heat jersey
doesn't even look right.
I'm not saying that the players
should bear the blame. Every ath
lete wants to win. In terms of per
sonal career moves, Allen and
Nash both made good, if not great,
decisions.

Had Allen stayed with the
Celtics, he would've most likely
had to battle with up-and-comer
