# LOYALTY STILL EXISTS
## 
### George Chen 
Devastation. If you're a
Celtics or Suns fan, that's
probably the best word to
describe what happened last week.
As you watched your beloved stars
announce their decisions to join
teams that you've no doubt grown
to hate with a violent passion, all
you could do was shake your head
in disbelief.

Ray Allen to the Heat. Steve
Nash to the Lakers. Even if you're
not a Celtics or Suns fan, you still
must have asked, "How the hell
did that happen?"
So how the hell did it happen?
In June, Nash wasn't even sure
that he would be leaving Phoenix.
But on Independence Day, three
days after Lakers general manager
Mitch Kupchak contacted Nash,
the 38-year-old veteran point
guard's move to the City of Angels
was finalized. A mere two days
later, Allen agreed to a two-year,
$6.3 million contract with the
Heat, despite the fact that the
Celtics offered twice as much.
The sudden nature of these
moves made them all the more
baffling. Nash is joining a long
standing conference foe with
which he's had a heated playoff
history. Likewise, Allen is signing
with a team that ended his NBA
playoff run the past two seasons.
And I can't be the only one who
thinks that Allen in a Heat jersey
doesn't even look right.
I'm not saying that the players
should bear the blame. Every ath
lete wants to win. In terms of per
sonal career moves, Allen and
Nash both made good, if not great,
decisions.

Had Allen stayed with the
Celtics, he would've most likely
had to battle with up-and-comer
Avery Bradley and newly signed
Jason Terry for playing time, not
to mention rumors of his deterio
rating relationship with Raj on
Rondo. For Nash, it was about
putting himself in the best position
to win a championship while stay
ing close to his family. Both Allen
and Nash wanted to add at least
one more championship to their
already illustrious careers. The
two veterans followed the old say
ing to the letter: If you can't beat
'em, join 'em.
If you can't really blame the
players, then that leaves the
league to be the scapegoat for al
lowing these kinds of trades and
signings to happen in the first
place. Add that to the already end
less list of things you hate about
the NBA.

But as it turns out, the NBA
isn't only the professional sports
league that's seen its fair share of
eye-popping trades and signings.
In the NFL, we saw Brett Favre
going from the Packers to the
Vikings. In the MLB, it was John
ny Damon from the Red Sox to
the Yankees. In the NHL, it was
Eric Lindros from the Flyers to the
Rangers. In the eyes of devastated
fans, those players were sports
traitors. Well, they probably were.
But the fact that these athletes
were even allowed to jump from
one rival team to another is a tes
tament to how some professional
leagues can be excruciating to fol
low.

And that's why college sports,
for me at least, will always be infi
nitely better to watch and follow
than professional sports.
In the pros, it's never safe for
fans to get too attached to any
player. At any given moment, the
star player on your favorite team
could sign with or be traded to an
archrival. Only a few franchise
players are somewhat immune.
Kobe Bryant would probably
rather pass the ball than be
shipped to the Celtics. Derek
Jeter would probably rather re
tire than wear a Red Sox hat. Tom
Brady would probably rather lose
both Rob Gronkowski and Wes
Welker than play for Rex Ryan.
But you can't say for sure that
even those transactions can't ever

happen. After all, most Packers
fans believed that Favre would
end his career on Lambeau Field
after being at Green Bay for 16
seasons, but they got a slap in the
face two years later when Favre
reappeared in a purple uniform.
In college, there's no such
thing as quitting one team to join
a Big Three or any kind of dream
team. When Andrew Luck came
back last season, he didn't trans
fer to Oklahoma State so that he
would have Justin Blackmon to
throw to. He came back to play
with his teammates and made the
best of what he had. And if the
end result was losing to Okla
homa State in the Fiesta Bowl,
then so be it. It's easy to take that
kind of loyalty in college athletics
for granted, but that doesn't
mean it's not there. Loyalty is
what defines college sports.
It's true that many college ath
letes will go pro before playing
out their four years. But if they do
elect to return, it's with the same
teams. Transfers certainly hap
pen, but they're nowhere near as
prolific as the trades that occur in
the pros. Most college athletes
will never win a national champi
onship, but they still stick it out at
their schools. They'd rather go
down fighting with their team
mates than find a shortcut to win
ning. As a fan, you have to respect
that.

And the appreciation that you
develop for college athletes goes
far beyond their college careers.
I'm a Boston sports fan, which
means that I'm never going to like
the Colts. But when Andrew
Luck takes the field against the
Pats in November, I'll still root
for him. As for Ray Allen, I'll al
ways respect him, but I certainly
won't be cheering him on when
the Celtics and the Heat meet
next year.

"There's no loyalty in sports,"
Nash told ESPN in an interview
explaining how he came to sign
with the Lakers. Nash could very
well make it to the NBA Finals
with Kobe next season, but that
won't mean what he said was cor
rect.

In professional sports, loyalty
might be non-existent. But in col
lege sports, loyalty is everything.

George Chen better not be ques
tioning his loyalty to The Stanford
Daily. Make sure he stays put at
