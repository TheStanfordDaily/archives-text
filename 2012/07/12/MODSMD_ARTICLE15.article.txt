# NEVER UPON A TIME
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The cruel truth about sports
is that, unlike Hollywood
blockbusters, there are
rarely any fairy-tale endings.
Hard work is often just that, with
no deserved payoff, and the un
derdog is normally crushed by
bigger and better opponents.
Now, before I get accused by
fans of Roger Federer of bias and
bitterness because yes, I am
talking about last Sunday's Wim
bledon final here I want to
make this clear: Federer out
played Andy Murray and deserv
ingly won his record-equaling
seventh Wimbledon title. There
were no poor decisions or refer
eeing favoritism that led to the
result. Federer won fair and
square, no complaints.
But Federer's victory was no
fairy-tale ending. A player who
spent a hefty chunk of his life as
world No. 1 regained his crown
and etched his name once again
in the history books. Yet a play
er who was the odds-on favorite
to win this match not in the four
sets it finally took, but in just
three, can't be our Hollywood
hero.

Everyone has to start from the
beginning, so when Federer first
rose up the ATP rankings it must
have felt like a dream to him. But

those days are long gone. A
record 17 Grand Slam titles and
286 weeks spent as world No. 1
later, many though not the
modest Federer himself re
gard him as the greatest player of
all time. Federer is undoubtedly a
legend, but he is also clearly Go
liath.

Murray, meanwhile, is the
perennial underdog, David. Fie
has finished the last four years
ranked No. 4 and been denied
time and again in Grand Slam
tournaments by the trio above
him: Federer, Rafael Nadal and
Novak Djokovic. Unfortunately
for Murray, both of the other two
Roger rivals have already done
enough to be counted among the
best of all time. Nadal has 11
Grand Slam titles and has spent
102 weeks at No. 1, and Djokovic
has five and has held the top spot
for 53 weeks.

That being said, Federer is
five years older than Murray, so
the Scot can hope for a window of
opportunity when the great Swiss
player decides to hang up his
racket. As for the other two,
Nadal is just a year older, and
Djokovic is actually a week
younger.

Should Murray ever walk
away with the top prize from any
of the world's four Grand Slams,
no one will be able to say didn't
earn it. To do so, he will almost
certainly have to find away past
one or more of the Big Three
along the way. Not just in a regu
lar match, but probably also in
the final. The last 30 straight
Grand Slam finals have featured
at least one of the trio, and Mur
ray's four losses at that stage
have come against Djokovic and
Federer.

A player who grew up in a tiny
Scottish town under the cloud of
an unspeakable tragedy (one of
the United Kingdom's worst
ever gun crimes, in which 16 chil
dren and one adult were mur
dered, took place at his primary
school while he attended class),
Murray has been anything but a
failure. He has won 22 singles ti
tles, beating the entire top three
in the process, been ranked as
highly as No. 2 and become the
first Brit to reach the final of
Wimbledon since 1938.

Through him, Dunblane has
become known not for a tortured
past, but as the hometown of
probably the greatest British ten
nis player of all time.
But Sunday's final made it
clear how fiercely his ambition
burns, and that his success to
date is not enough. Willed on by
60 million Brits, and especially
by 8,000 old neighbors who see
in his achievements away to heal
the wounds that still cut so
deeply, he was brought to tears
by the sheer emotion of it all. He
has sometimes had a mixed rela
tionship with British fans, but he
surely won over those last hearts
and minds with his passion and
performance in the final.
If Andy Murray wins a
Grand Slam title, and especial
ly if that title is Wimbledon, the
spiritual home of tennis, maybe,
just maybe we'll finally have our
fairy-tale ending.

in sports almost as much as he loves
fairy-tale endings in cheesy Holly
wood blockbusters. Send him a list
of cheesy movies with heartwarm
ing endings at tom.taylor@stan

The cruel truth about sports
is that, unlike Hollywood
blockbusters, there are
rarely any fairy-tale endings.
Hard work is often just that, with
no deserved payoff, and the un
derdog is normally crushed by
bigger and better opponents.
Now, before I get accused by
fans of Roger Federer of bias and
bitterness because yes, I am
talking about last Sunday's Wim
bledon final here I want to
make this clear: Federer out
played Andy Murray and deserv
ingly won his record-equaling
seventh Wimbledon title. There
were no poor decisions or refer
eeing favoritism that led to the
result. Federer won fair and
square, no complaints.
But Federer's victory was no
fairy-tale ending. A player who
spent a hefty chunk of his life as
world No. 1 regained his crown
and etched his name once again
in the history books. Yet a play
er who was the odds-on favorite
to win this match not in the four
sets it finally took, but in just
three, can't be our Hollywood
hero.

Everyone has to start from the
beginning, so when Federer first
rose up the ATP rankings it must
have felt like a dream to him. But

those days are long gone. A
record 17 Grand Slam titles and
286 weeks spent as world No. 1
later, many though not the
modest Federer himself re
gard him as the greatest player of
all time. Federer is undoubtedly a
legend, but he is also clearly Go
liath.

Murray, meanwhile, is the
perennial underdog, David. Fie
has finished the last four years
ranked No. 4 and been denied
time and again in Grand Slam
tournaments by the trio above
him: Federer, Rafael Nadal and
Novak Djokovic. Unfortunately
for Murray, both of the other two
Roger rivals have already done
enough to be counted among the
best of all time. Nadal has 11
Grand Slam titles and has spent
102 weeks at No. 1, and Djokovic
has five and has held the top spot
for 53 weeks.

That being said, Federer is
five years older than Murray, so
the Scot can hope for a window of
opportunity when the great Swiss
player decides to hang up his
racket. As for the other two,
Nadal is just a year older, and
Djokovic is actually a week
younger.

Should Murray ever walk
away with the top prize from any
of the world's four Grand Slams,
no one will be able to say didn't
earn it. To do so, he will almost
certainly have to find away past
one or more of the Big Three
along the way. Not just in a regu
lar match, but probably also in
the final. The last 30 straight
Grand Slam finals have featured
at least one of the trio, and Mur
ray's four losses at that stage
have come against Djokovic and
Federer.

A player who grew up in a tiny
Scottish town under the cloud of
an unspeakable tragedy (one of
the United Kingdom's worst
ever gun crimes, in which 16 chil
dren and one adult were mur
dered, took place at his primary
school while he attended class),
Murray has been anything but a
failure. He has won 22 singles ti
tles, beating the entire top three
in the process, been ranked as
highly as No. 2 and become the
first Brit to reach the final of
Wimbledon since 1938.

Through him, Dunblane has
become known not for a tortured
past, but as the hometown of
probably the greatest British ten
nis player of all time.
But Sunday's final made it
clear how fiercely his ambition
burns, and that his success to
date is not enough. Willed on by
60 million Brits, and especially
by 8,000 old neighbors who see
in his achievements away to heal
the wounds that still cut so
deeply, he was brought to tears
by the sheer emotion of it all. He
has sometimes had a mixed rela
tionship with British fans, but he
surely won over those last hearts
and minds with his passion and
performance in the final.
If Andy Murray wins a
Grand Slam title, and especial
ly if that title is Wimbledon, the
spiritual home of tennis, maybe,
just maybe we'll finally have our
fairy-tale ending.
