# REMEMBERING PETER SAUER
## Stanford's fundamentally unselfish' forward of the '90s led by example and set the tone for Cardinal basketball's golden era

u rpwo Arizona fans stood outside
the McKale center," began an
.1. article in the Feb. 26,1999 issue
of The Stanford Daily, "smoking their ciga
rettes during halftime of last month's Cardi
nal-Wildcat basketball game,
'I just can't stand Stanford,' one ex
claimed to a friend. 'And I can't stand Peter
Sauer. Sauer's an asshole.'
When asked how he came to his colorful
conclusion, a strange look a mix that
showed he was both angered that such an
inquiry was made and confused at trying to
find the answer crossed his face.
'What do you mean? Fie just is! Look at
him!"'
Peter Sauer '99,35, died on Sunday night
when he collapsed due to an enlarged heart
and hit his head on a concrete basketball
court, fracturing his skull. A former Bank of
America executive with a wife and three
kids, Sauer led squads that featured some of
Stanford's best scorers of all time: Brevin
Knight, Arthur Lee, Kris Weems and Mark
Madsen.
Called "quietly aggressive," "smother
ing" and "a pest" in that 1996 Daily article,
Sauer managed to get under opposing
crowds' skin with his apparently laid-back
demeanor and solid all-around play. Even
his hair, straight off the head of Kramer
from "Seinfeld," was a source of annoy
ance.

"The student body really liked him
though, because he was so scrappy, because
he would get on other teams' nerves," re
calls Jim Tankersley 'OO, a former men's
basketball columnist for The Daily and its
Volume 215 Editor In Chief. "The Sixth-
Man Club loved guys who got on other
teams' nerves, and absolutely, Sauer."
Sauer was never a top-three scorer, but
he was a key part of teams that made four
NCAA tournament appearances, reached
the Final Four in 1998 and won the Cardi
nal's first ever Pac-10 title its final season.

"The way his friends described him as a
person," Tankersley said, "was very similar
to what his game was like: fundamentally
unselfish."

Both a small and power forward for the
Cardinal, Sauer started 96 times over his
final three seasons, including in each of his
last 95 collegiate games, captaining the
team in his junior and senior seasons.
"He was the heart and soul of our pro-

gram in terms of leadership and mentoring other
players," said Madsen, a three-year teammate of
Sauer's, after his death. "Pete was so well-loved.
He was a leader among men and you know he
cared about you."

Sauer's career truly began at the end of his
freshman year, during the 1996 NCAA tourna
ment. As Stanford lost a 79-74 heartbreaker
against top-ranked Massachusetts, a clutch per
former was born.

Down by three points late in the game, Stan
ford needed a big perimeter shot to keep its sea
son alive. Things went Sauer.
"Head coach Mike Montgomery knew that
his sharpshooter would not get a clean look,"
reads the April 1,1996 edition of The Daily. "So
the play went to the second option, freshman
Peter Sauer fading back on the left wing to the
three-point line.
'We'd been running that play a lot down the
stretch for 10-15 footers, but we needed the
three,' Sauer said. 'That made it a lot harder a
fade-away 20-footer.'
Sauer got a clean look at the basket but shot
off-balance. The trajectory of the shot reflected
its hurried nature, as the ball ricocheted hard off
the glass and rim."
"I remember thinking at the time, 'Wow, a
classmate of mine is taking this big shot real
ly?'" remembers Ed Guzman '99, a Stanford
freshman that year who is now the Sports Copy
Chief at The Washington Post. "He just kind of
shook it off and kept going."
Instead of crushing the young freshman,
Sauer's trial-by-fire reinforced a work ethic that
would pay dividends several times over the next
three years.
'"The veterans all acknowledged that I played
hard, and that's how we look at it in our pro
gram,' Sauer said. 'lf you play hard off the bench,
you'll get no words from the coach for not having
shots fall.'"

His days coming off the bench were short
lived, and the next time Stanford's postseason
fate rested on Sauer, he wouldn't miss.

Sauer quickly established himself as the 1997
Cardinal's starting power forward, and the
sophomore was a quiet spark plug in Pac-10 play;
a week after Stanford had been swept by in-state
rivals Cal, USC and UCLA, Sauer helped keep
the Cardinal in the hunt for the conference title
with a double-double against Oregon.
Still a perfect 10-0 at home but on the bubble
for the NCAA tournament, the Cardinal trailed
a favored Arizona team at halftime of a must-win
game. In a packed house of 7,391 at Maples Pavil-

ion, Tankersley, a freshman at the
time, took in the action from an
overflow student section behind
one of the baskets.

"That Arizona team was really
good," he recalled of the No. 12
Wildcats. "They were better than
us. They were more athletic, they
made more shots, but Brevin he
was Brevin, and he got up for big
games.

"I remember it being very back
and-forth, and being like no sporting
event I had ever attended. I mean,
just the tension was enormous.
Every possession, from about mid
way through the second half, it felt
like the game depended on it, which
is pretty amazing for a regular-sea
son game."
With Stanford down by two
points in the final moments, it was
time for Sauer's redemption.
"It's not often that a college bas
ketball player gets a chance to play
hero by making the last-minute shot
in a big game," began The Daily's
March 7,1997 recap. "For Stanford
sophomore Peter Sauer, it's already
happened twice.''
"The last play, you could feel it,
everyone in the building expected
Brevin to take that shot every
one," Tankersley remembered.
"And he drove, and they collapsed
on him... he did the exact right
thing for a point guard.

"He found Sauer, and Sauer was
wide freaking open. We knew, as
soon as he caught the ball, not even
when he shot but as soon as he
caught it, that it was going in."
"Last night, Sauer got a second
chance," the story continued, "and
this time the 6-foot-7 forward deliv
ered.

'l've been thinking about that
ever since that happened,' Sauer said
of his missed shot against UMasss.
'So it's nice to get one in.'
Sauer's shot was merely the fin
ishing touch to one of the most
thrilling games in Maples Pavilion
history."
"I remember being on the court
bouncing up and down," Tankersley
said, "and feeling like I had never
jumped higher in my life, because
everybody's going and the floor was
really, really springy. The players
were just elated and bouncing

around, and it was the first time you
really thought, 'You know, these
guys could have a run in them.'"

The Cardinal made it to the
Sweet Sixteen that year behind two
late Sauer jumpers in a 72-66 win
over Wake Forest, but its tourna
ment ended in overtime against
Utah.

"Probably the Sweet Sixteen
wouldn't have happened without
that Sauer shot," Guzman said of the
Arizona game. "That seems hyper
bolic, but I really believe that, be
cause that was a huge stepping stone
to what they would go on and be
come.

"The Final Four run wouldn't
have happened [either]," he added.

But even the Final Four run
would have its roots in a disappoint
ing, second-place conference finish.
Sauer, ever in the background, was
one of the Cardinal's most reliable
options as a junior.

That year, Stanford was unex
pectedly riding a school-record 18-
garne winning streak without the
graduated Knight when Arizona
rolled back into Maples Pavilion for
a huge, top-10 tilt. Sauer's 23 points
against the Wildcats were a career
best, but the undefeated Cardinal let
things slip away in the second half
and was embarrassed at home, 93-
75.

Overshadowed by Lee and Mad
sen, Sauer's performance wasn't
even mentioned in The Daily's recap
of that game until its second-to-last
paragraph. (Tankersley and Guz
man were the two sports editors that
night.)

"It almost feels like a relic of col
lege basketball right now, because
you don't think of a lot of teams that
are like this today, but what made
those teams work well was that they
had some really well-defined role
players," Tankersley said. "Sauer
was just there leading the team, giv
ing them energy, doing all the little
things. Everybody had these great
roles and as a captain, he sort of was
the orchestrator of a lot of those
roles."

His absence from the limelight
was explored later that year in a fea
ture by Cardinal Today, a game-day
program published by The Daily.
"If you remember him only as the
man who sank the game-winning
shot against Arizona last season,
you've missed quite a bit," opened
the article.
"Junior forward Peter Sauer's

contributions to Stanford's success
[are] substantial, but his actual value
to the team may escape the notice of
the average fan.
..."He's very vocal he's a
leader,' said junior guard Arthur
Lee. 'lf he sees someone on the team
that needs encouragement, he'll go
up to the guy and give him all the en
couragement he needs.'"
Guzman, The Daily's Head
Sports Managing Editor at the time,
happened to be rooming with senior
center Tim Young in Roble Hall that
year.

"Tim really kind of deferred to
Pete Sauer," Guzman said. "[Sauer
would] always come to our room and
was checking in on Tim and seeing
how he was doing. To me, that spoke
volumes about his leadership abili
ties, that even guys who were slightly
older than him were willing to turn to
him and look to him to set that tone
for the team as a whole."

Sauer's on-the-court intensity
translated into his best collegiate sea
son, as he went on to average 9.2
points and 4.6 rebounds per game as
a junior. But despite the Cardinal's
15-3 finish in Pac-10 play, 17-1 Ari
zona grabbed the crown and extend
ed Stanford's conference-title
drought to 35 seasons.

Despite the Pac-10 disappoint
ment, the Cardinal still earned a
three-seed in the 1998 tournament
and was poised for one of the best
postseason runs in school history.
"Along the way [through the
NCAA tournament]," the March 11
Cardinal Today story concluded,
"the Card can expect some close
games, and some wonder who will
have the ball if Stanford needs the
bucket in crunch time.
'I definitely feel comfortable in
that situation,' Sauer said. 'l'm will
ing and ready to take that shot.'
It's not like he hasn't done it be
fore."
Sauer only played for about a half
in each of the team's five tournament
games. In St. Louis where Sauer's
dad Mark worked as an executive
with the Blues hockey organization
—he watched from the bench as
Stanford grabbed an emotional Elite
Eight win over Rhode Island thanks
to a late-game slam dunk, and-one,
by Madsen, clinching the Cardinal's
only Final Four berth since its 1942
national title.

Sauer injured his knee the next
week in practice, just four days be

fore the looming semifinal against
Kentucky, forcing him to join the
team in San Antonio late. After an
MRI and a fitting for a brace, Sauer
still made the start.

Down four in overtime, Sauer
sunk a long three-pointer with 9.2
seconds cut Stanford's deficit to one,
86-85. The Cardinal was forced to
foul and the Wildcats' Wayne Turn
er missed both shots.

Sauer grabbed the rebound, but
with just two seconds to work with he
could only launch a long heave at the
buzzer. It went wide right.
"Just give us five more seconds,"
he said after the game. "That's all I
was asking for."
"He really kind of brought an air
of optimism to the team and to the
school ," Guzman said. "The
point he was trying to make was, you
know, we more or less left it all on the
floor there, and yeah, it hurts, but
we'll be alright.
"I'll always remember seeing this
picture in Stanford Magazine not too
long after the Final Four run," Guz
man recalled. "Sauer had his arms
around Art Lee, I think, as they're
walking offthefloor after what to me
was just an agonizing one-point
overtime loss. But he's smiling. And
it was like, 'Wow, that just shows you
the difference between him and
most of the rest of us who are just
fans.'"

Undeterred, the Cardinal set its
sights back on the Pac-10 title for the
1998-9 season, Sauer's second as a
small forward.

Though he would reach double
figures 14 times as a senior, Sauer
continued to embrace his standing as
a role player on a team stacked with
offensive talent. On Jan. 12, The
Daily named Sauer one of its two
"Athletes of the Week" after a 71-
62 win over Cal and not just be
cause of his 13 points in that game.
"More importantly," the graphic
read, "his solid defense and all
around hustle kept the Cardinal in
the game when the starting guards
struggled from the perimeter in the
first half."
That was the role Sauer carved
out for himself, always hustling,
playing for the team and not for
himself. "Fundamentally un
selfish."

Following a series of victories
that year, the Cardinal faced the
fearsome Wildcats at Maples Pavil
ion on Feb. 28, another chapter in
that heated rivalry. The Cardinal

was just a win away from clinching
its first outright conference champi
onship in 57 years.
"It was probably the one time in
my life I scalped tickets," Guzman
said. "Coming off that Final Four
year, tickets were impossible. It was
the hot ticket.

"The thing that I remember for
that game was just how loud it got
for all the pregame stuff, for all the
ovations," he added. "They were
just drowning out the PA announc
er... My ears were ringing for quite
a while after that game."
No. 6 Stanford grabbed a 20-
point lead in the first half and never
looked back, dominating its No. 7
foes 98-83.

"All four of the original mem
bers of the Stanford basketball
Class 0f1999 stood heroically on the
Maples hardwood," reported The
Daily on March 1, "and watched the
scoreboard clock tick to zeroes for
the last time.

... Sauer was the first to jump
on top of the scorers table, an island
in the seas of humanity that spilled
onto the floor."

Sauer's Stanford career, like his
life, would come to an end far too
early.

The second-seeded Cardinal
eased by Alcorn State in the first
round of the tournament but was
upset by lOth-seeded Gonzaga,
which never trailed after erasing
Stanford's early 1-0 lead.
Though "the Cardinal climbed
to within four points at the half on a
phenomenal basket by Peter Sauer
as time expired," as the March 29
recap in The Daily read, it was sim
ply not meant to be for Stanford
that year.

"Peter Sauer formed a huddle at
half court with Lee and Weems. He
didn't want to let go just yet. There
was time for one last memory al
beit a painful one.
'I really can't believe this is all
over now,' Sauer said in the locker
room after the game. 'What makes
this all so fun is the relationships
with these guys.'
'The good times on the road
trips, the chemistry we had off the
court and all the times we hung out
... that is what I will always remem
ber. It seems impossible that I just
took that jersey off for the last
time.'"
