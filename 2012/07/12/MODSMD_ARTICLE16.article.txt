# REMEMBERING PETER SAUER
## Stanford's fundamentally unselfish' forward of the '90s led by example and set the tone for Cardinal basketball's golden era

u rpwo Arizona fans stood outside
the McKale center," began an
.1. article in the Feb. 26,1999 issue
of The Stanford Daily, "smoking their ciga
rettes during halftime of last month's Cardi
nal-Wildcat basketball game,
'I just can't stand Stanford,' one ex
claimed to a friend. 'And I can't stand Peter
Sauer. Sauer's an asshole.'
When asked how he came to his colorful
conclusion, a strange look a mix that
showed he was both angered that such an
inquiry was made and confused at trying to
find the answer crossed his face.
'What do you mean? Fie just is! Look at
him!"'
Peter Sauer '99,35, died on Sunday night
when he collapsed due to an enlarged heart
and hit his head on a concrete basketball
court, fracturing his skull. A former Bank of
America executive with a wife and three
kids, Sauer led squads that featured some of
Stanford's best scorers of all time: Brevin
Knight, Arthur Lee, Kris Weems and Mark
Madsen.
Called "quietly aggressive," "smother
ing" and "a pest" in that 1996 Daily article,
Sauer managed to get under opposing
crowds' skin with his apparently laid-back
demeanor and solid all-around play. Even
his hair, straight off the head of Kramer
from "Seinfeld," was a source of annoy
ance.

"The student body really liked him
though, because he was so scrappy, because
he would get on other teams' nerves," re
calls Jim Tankersley 'OO, a former men's
basketball columnist for The Daily and its
Volume 215 Editor In Chief. "The Sixth-
Man Club loved guys who got on other
teams' nerves, and absolutely, Sauer."
Sauer was never a top-three scorer, but
he was a key part of teams that made four
NCAA tournament appearances, reached
the Final Four in 1998 and won the Cardi
nal's first ever Pac-10 title its final season.

"The way his friends described him as a
person," Tankersley said, "was very similar
to what his game was like: fundamentally
unselfish."

Both a small and power forward for the
Cardinal, Sauer started 96 times over his
final three seasons, including in each of his
last 95 collegiate games, captaining the
team in his junior and senior seasons.
"He was the heart and soul of our pro-

gram in terms of leadership and mentoring other
players," said Madsen, a three-year teammate of
Sauer's, after his death. "Pete was so well-loved.
He was a leader among men and you know he
cared about you."

Sauer's career truly began at the end of his
freshman year, during the 1996 NCAA tourna
ment. As Stanford lost a 79-74 heartbreaker
against top-ranked Massachusetts, a clutch per
former was born.

Down by three points late in the game, Stan
ford needed a big perimeter shot to keep its sea
son alive. Things went Sauer.
"Head coach Mike Montgomery knew that
his sharpshooter would not get a clean look,"
reads the April 1,1996 edition of The Daily. "So
the play went to the second option, freshman
Peter Sauer fading back on the left wing to the
three-point line.
'We'd been running that play a lot down the
stretch for 10-15 footers, but we needed the
three,' Sauer said. 'That made it a lot harder a
fade-away 20-footer.'
Sauer got a clean look at the basket but shot
off-balance. The trajectory of the shot reflected
its hurried nature, as the ball ricocheted hard off
the glass and rim."
"I remember thinking at the time, 'Wow, a
classmate of mine is taking this big shot real
ly?'" remembers Ed Guzman '99, a Stanford
freshman that year who is now the Sports Copy
Chief at The Washington Post. "He just kind of
shook it off and kept going."
Instead of crushing the young freshman,
Sauer's trial-by-fire reinforced a work ethic that
would pay dividends several times over the next
three years.
'"The veterans all acknowledged that I played
hard, and that's how we look at it in our pro
gram,' Sauer said. 'lf you play hard off the bench,
you'll get no words from the coach for not having
shots fall.'"

His days coming off the bench were short
lived, and the next time Stanford's postseason
fate rested on Sauer, he wouldn't miss.

Sauer quickly established himself as the 1997
Cardinal's starting power forward, and the
sophomore was a quiet spark plug in Pac-10 play;
a week after Stanford had been swept by in-state
rivals Cal, USC and UCLA, Sauer helped keep
the Cardinal in the hunt for the conference title
with a double-double against Oregon.
Still a perfect 10-0 at home but on the bubble
for the NCAA tournament, the Cardinal trailed
a favored Arizona team at halftime of a must-win
game. In a packed house of 7,391 at Maples Pavil-
