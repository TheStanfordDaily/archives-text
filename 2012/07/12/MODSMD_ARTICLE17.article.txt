# Undrafted & Undeterred

### BILLY GALLAGHER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF 
£ A Tith the first pick in the 2012 NFL
\/\/ Draft, the Indianapolis Colts se-
V V lect Andrew Luck, quarter
back, Stanford..."

Luck strides across the Radio City Music
Hall stage in a dark-blue suit and a tie with lilac
and lavender stripes, his normally shaggy hair
groomed for the occasion. He bear hugs the
league commissioner and flashes a goofy smile
for the rows of cameras.

Back at Stanford, in the Rains apartment he
shares with Luck, Griff Whalen is also beam
ing. It's early in the evening on Thursday, April
26, and Whalen has a math midterm at 7. He
sits on a couch with Luck's girlfriend, anxious
ly reviewing his math notes while glancing at
the 36-inch TV in the corner of their living
room.

Whalen has been roommates with Luck
and David DeCastro, Stanford's All-Ameri
can guard who would also be drafted in the first
round, for the past three years. He doesn't want
to leave before DeCastro is selected, but 7 o'-
clock quickly approaches and he has a linear al

gebra and vector calculus test to take.
On this day, much more than their
wardrobes and the 3,000 miles between Palo
Alto and Manhattan separate Whalen from his
best friend.

For Luck, and even for DeCastro, the draft
is both a coronation of a blue-chip college ca
reer and the road to riches. For Whalen, who
has been advised that he's a late-round pick at
best, it is a reminder that life after football could
come sooner than he'd prefer.
"It was pretty awesome to see one of my
best friends up there," he recalls. "It wasn't a
surprise, but at the same time, I don't think that
diminished it at all."

Two days later. Luck is back in their Rains
apartment. He's eager to see where Whalen
will end up. The quarterback sits alone because
his favorite receiver, the quiet senior from Syl
vania, Ohio, is holed up with family in a nearby
hotel room.
Back in the Palo Alto hotel room with his
family, Whalen watches as the draft passes and
eventually realizes he will be an undrafted play
er. After switching positions twice before his
freshman season began and fighting his way to
both a scholarship and a starting spot, Whalen

will have to again fight for a spot.
Minutes after the draft ends, the Colts call to
offer him a chance to reunite with Luck and
Stanford tight end Coby Fleener. Other teams
call, but he has made up his mind.
"We talked to each other every couple
hours, just texting to see if he'd heard any
thing," Luck says. "I knew if he wasn't drafted,
I definitely wanted him in Indianapolis, so I'm
glad it worked 0ut...t0 have Griff sign with
them as well, that was special."
Under NFL rules, players still taking classes
cannot participate in the 10-day organized
team activities (OTAs). For the Colts, that
means Luck, Whalen and Ohio wide receiver
LaVon Brazill need to stay away.
For Whalen, it does not bode well that he is
missing one of the rare opportunities to make
an impression on coaches. However, he has a
maj or advantage over the other wide receivers.
While they're playing catch with less-heralded
quarterbacks in Indianapolis, Whalen will be
working out with Luck at Stanford.

On an unusually windy Friday morning,
three weeks after rookie minicamp, Whalen
meets up with Luck and cornerback Johnson

Bademosi, who recently signed with the Cleve
land Browns, on an empty practice field on
campus. Their classmates are busy in class, in
the library or sleeping in after Thursday's se
nior pub night.
TTiey all don Stanford gear, except for
Luck's white Colts hat. Fleener and Luck play
catch and joke as they warm up. Whalen
stretches and runs quick sprints nearby with a
scowl-like focus.

Luck warms up more by throwing routes to
Whalen and Bademosi. Several balls sail past
Bademosi or miss him; on every throw the ball
seems to drop into Whalen's hands perfectly.
Only one throw appears a bit off target.
Whalen extends his right hand and pulls it in
easily.
"Its like one and one," Bademosi says, talk
ing about Whalen and Luck's chemistry.
"Aw, don't come too flat," Luck grimaces
after he and Whalen miss for the first time of
the day. "We've gotta do that again."
They practice the route three more times
before moving on.
Fleener and Luck tower over Whalen as

they circle up in a miniature huddle
to discuss a play.
Luck takes a snap and drops
back. Whalen comes out of his
stance hard, breaks crisply and
sprints past Bademosi, snagging the
perfect ball out of the air.
"Did you think I could've gone
like one deeper or was that good?"
he says, panting as he jogs back.
"No, I liked that," Luck re
sponds.
The three discuss Colts practices,
which Fleener can attend, but Luck
and Whalen are relegated to watch
ing on tape.
"Who's done with school?"
Fleener mocks, raising his hand and
looking at Luck and Whalen. Luck
and Fleener joke between plays.
Whalen barely speaks if it isn't about
a route or play.
"That was perfect," Luck says
after a throw to Fleener.
"That's what she said," Fleener
retorts.

Whalen and Luck had a whirl
wind end to their Stanford careers

finishing finals on June 8, flying to
Indianapolis for a week of mini
camp, flying back to Stanford for

commencement and then flying
right back to Indianapolis for more
minicamp.

Luck, DeCastro and Whalen
leave behind three years of living to
gether, and four of competing and
taking classes. The casual observer
will notice that they leave Stanford
with three straight bowl appear
ances, two BCS bowls and a #4 rank
ing in their senior season.
But they also leave behind a host
of memories not seen by the public:
the football team's ultra-competitive
soccer games with the national
champion women's soccer team,
swimming in the Luck family's near
by pool and cracking jokes in the
California sunshine and eating casu
al dinners with fellow senior and pro
golfer Michelle Wie.

Luck's immediate future is clear
cut. He'll be trying to step into the
shoes of one of the greatest quarter
backs of all time, Peyton Manning.
Whalen's future is much more tenu
ous. He moves to a new city fighting
to earn a job. And if that doesn't
work out, he'll look for opportunities
outside of football.

"There's so many different things
you can do with product design,"
Whalen says. "Stuff in the engineer
ing field is changing so quickly,
things that were relevant four years
ago are no longer relevant at all.
Whatever I might be doing might
not even exist right now."

The Colts current roster stands at
85 players and needs to be pared
down to 53 by the end of preseason,
in late August. Most of the 15 un
drafted free agents will be cut.
Whalen is one of 10 receivers on the
list; most teams only take six, maybe
seven into the season. He will have to
impress on special teams and out
work other rookies and journeyman
receivers to make the roster.

Luck isn't the type of person to
use his clout to suggest Colts man
agement give Whalen a spot.
Whalen isn't the kind to ask for a
helping hand.

ing. It's early in the evening on Thursday, April
26, and Whalen has a math midterm at 7. He
sits on a couch with Luck's girlfriend, anxious
ly reviewing his math notes while glancing at
the 36-inch TV in the corner of their living
room.

Whalen has been roommates with Luck
and David DeCastro, Stanford's All-Ameri
can guard who would also be drafted in the first
round, for the past three years. He doesn't want
to leave before DeCastro is selected, but 7 o'-
clock quickly approaches and he has a linear al

gebra and vector calculus test to take.
On this day, much more than their
wardrobes and the 3,000 miles between Palo
Alto and Manhattan separate Whalen from his
best friend.

For Luck, and even for DeCastro, the draft
is both a coronation of a blue-chip college ca
reer and the road to riches. For Whalen, who
has been advised that he's a late-round pick at
best, it is a reminder that life after football could
come sooner than he'd prefer.
"It was pretty awesome to see one of my
best friends up there," he recalls. "It wasn't a
surprise, but at the same time, I don't think that
diminished it at all."

Two days later. Luck is back in their Rains
apartment. He's eager to see where Whalen
will end up. The quarterback sits alone because
his favorite receiver, the quiet senior from Syl
vania, Ohio, is holed up with family in a nearby
hotel room.
Back in the Palo Alto hotel room with his
family, Whalen watches as the draft passes and
eventually realizes he will be an undrafted play
er. After switching positions twice before his
freshman season began and fighting his way to
both a scholarship and a starting spot, Whalen

will have to again fight for a spot.
Minutes after the draft ends, the Colts call to
offer him a chance to reunite with Luck and
Stanford tight end Coby Fleener. Other teams
call, but he has made up his mind.
"We talked to each other every couple
hours, just texting to see if he'd heard any
thing," Luck says. "I knew if he wasn't drafted,
I definitely wanted him in Indianapolis, so I'm
glad it worked 0ut...t0 have Griff sign with
them as well, that was special."
Under NFL rules, players still taking classes
cannot participate in the 10-day organized
team activities (OTAs). For the Colts, that
means Luck, Whalen and Ohio wide receiver
LaVon Brazill need to stay away.
For Whalen, it does not bode well that he is
missing one of the rare opportunities to make
an impression on coaches. However, he has a
maj or advantage over the other wide receivers.
While they're playing catch with less-heralded
quarterbacks in Indianapolis, Whalen will be
working out with Luck at Stanford.

On an unusually windy Friday morning,
three weeks after rookie minicamp, Whalen
meets up with Luck and cornerback Johnson

Bademosi, who recently signed with the Cleve
land Browns, on an empty practice field on
campus. Their classmates are busy in class, in
the library or sleeping in after Thursday's se
nior pub night.
TTiey all don Stanford gear, except for
Luck's white Colts hat. Fleener and Luck play
catch and joke as they warm up. Whalen
stretches and runs quick sprints nearby with a
scowl-like focus.

Luck warms up more by throwing routes to
Whalen and Bademosi. Several balls sail past
Bademosi or miss him; on every throw the ball
seems to drop into Whalen's hands perfectly.
Only one throw appears a bit off target.
Whalen extends his right hand and pulls it in
easily.
"Its like one and one," Bademosi says, talk
ing about Whalen and Luck's chemistry.
"Aw, don't come too flat," Luck grimaces
after he and Whalen miss for the first time of
the day. "We've gotta do that again."
They practice the route three more times
before moving on.
Fleener and Luck tower over Whalen as

they circle up in a miniature huddle
to discuss a play.
Luck takes a snap and drops
back. Whalen comes out of his
stance hard, breaks crisply and
sprints past Bademosi, snagging the
perfect ball out of the air.
"Did you think I could've gone
like one deeper or was that good?"
he says, panting as he jogs back.
"No, I liked that," Luck re
sponds.
The three discuss Colts practices,
which Fleener can attend, but Luck
and Whalen are relegated to watch
ing on tape.
"Who's done with school?"
Fleener mocks, raising his hand and
looking at Luck and Whalen. Luck
and Fleener joke between plays.
Whalen barely speaks if it isn't about
a route or play.
"That was perfect," Luck says
after a throw to Fleener.
"That's what she said," Fleener
retorts.

Whalen and Luck had a whirl
wind end to their Stanford careers

finishing finals on June 8, flying to
Indianapolis for a week of mini
camp, flying back to Stanford for

commencement and then flying
right back to Indianapolis for more
minicamp.

Luck, DeCastro and Whalen
leave behind three years of living to
gether, and four of competing and
taking classes. The casual observer
will notice that they leave Stanford
with three straight bowl appear
ances, two BCS bowls and a #4 rank
ing in their senior season.
But they also leave behind a host
of memories not seen by the public:
the football team's ultra-competitive
soccer games with the national
champion women's soccer team,
swimming in the Luck family's near
by pool and cracking jokes in the
California sunshine and eating casu
al dinners with fellow senior and pro
golfer Michelle Wie.

Luck's immediate future is clear
cut. He'll be trying to step into the
shoes of one of the greatest quarter
backs of all time, Peyton Manning.
Whalen's future is much more tenu
ous. He moves to a new city fighting
to earn a job. And if that doesn't
work out, he'll look for opportunities
outside of football.

"There's so many different things
you can do with product design,"
Whalen says. "Stuff in the engineer
ing field is changing so quickly,
things that were relevant four years
ago are no longer relevant at all.
Whatever I might be doing might
not even exist right now."

The Colts current roster stands at
85 players and needs to be pared
down to 53 by the end of preseason,
in late August. Most of the 15 un
drafted free agents will be cut.
Whalen is one of 10 receivers on the
list; most teams only take six, maybe
seven into the season. He will have to
impress on special teams and out
work other rookies and journeyman
receivers to make the roster.

Luck isn't the type of person to
use his clout to suggest Colts man
agement give Whalen a spot.
Whalen isn't the kind to ask for a
helping hand.
