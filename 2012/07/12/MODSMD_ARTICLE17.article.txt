Â£ A Tith the first pick in the 2012 NFL
\/\/ Draft, the Indianapolis Colts se-
V V lect Andrew Luck, quarter
back, Stanford..."

Luck strides across the Radio City Music
Hall stage in a dark-blue suit and a tie with lilac
and lavender stripes, his normally shaggy hair
groomed for the occasion. He bear hugs the
league commissioner and flashes a goofy smile
for the rows of cameras.

Back at Stanford, in the Rains apartment he
shares with Luck, Griff Whalen is also beam
ing. It's early in the evening on Thursday, April
26, and Whalen has a math midterm at 7. He
sits on a couch with Luck's girlfriend, anxious
ly reviewing his math notes while glancing at
the 36-inch TV in the corner of their living
room.

Whalen has been roommates with Luck
and David DeCastro, Stanford's All-Ameri
can guard who would also be drafted in the first
round, for the past three years. He doesn't want
to leave before DeCastro is selected, but 7 o'-
clock quickly approaches and he has a linear al

gebra and vector calculus test to take.
On this day, much more than their
wardrobes and the 3,000 miles between Palo
Alto and Manhattan separate Whalen from his
best friend.

For Luck, and even for DeCastro, the draft
is both a coronation of a blue-chip college ca
reer and the road to riches. For Whalen, who
has been advised that he's a late-round pick at
best, it is a reminder that life after football could
come sooner than he'd prefer.
"It was pretty awesome to see one of my
best friends up there," he recalls. "It wasn't a
surprise, but at the same time, I don't think that
diminished it at all."

Two days later. Luck is back in their Rains
apartment. He's eager to see where Whalen
will end up. The quarterback sits alone because
his favorite receiver, the quiet senior from Syl
vania, Ohio, is holed up with family in a nearby
hotel room.
Back in the Palo Alto hotel room with his
family, Whalen watches as the draft passes and
eventually realizes he will be an undrafted play
er. After switching positions twice before his
freshman season began and fighting his way to
both a scholarship and a starting spot, Whalen

will have to again fight for a spot.
Minutes after the draft ends, the Colts call to
offer him a chance to reunite with Luck and
Stanford tight end Coby Fleener. Other teams
call, but he has made up his mind.
"We talked to each other every couple
hours, just texting to see if he'd heard any
thing," Luck says. "I knew if he wasn't drafted,
I definitely wanted him in Indianapolis, so I'm
glad it worked 0ut...t0 have Griff sign with
them as well, that was special."
Under NFL rules, players still taking classes
cannot participate in the 10-day organized
team activities (OTAs). For the Colts, that
means Luck, Whalen and Ohio wide receiver
LaVon Brazill need to stay away.
For Whalen, it does not bode well that he is
missing one of the rare opportunities to make
an impression on coaches. However, he has a
maj or advantage over the other wide receivers.
While they're playing catch with less-heralded
quarterbacks in Indianapolis, Whalen will be
working out with Luck at Stanford.

On an unusually windy Friday morning,
three weeks after rookie minicamp, Whalen
meets up with Luck and cornerback Johnson

Bademosi, who recently signed with the Cleve
land Browns, on an empty practice field on
campus. Their classmates are busy in class, in
the library or sleeping in after Thursday's se
nior pub night.
TTiey all don Stanford gear, except for
Luck's white Colts hat. Fleener and Luck play
catch and joke as they warm up. Whalen
stretches and runs quick sprints nearby with a
scowl-like focus.

Luck warms up more by throwing routes to
Whalen and Bademosi. Several balls sail past
Bademosi or miss him; on every throw the ball
seems to drop into Whalen's hands perfectly.
Only one throw appears a bit off target.
Whalen extends his right hand and pulls it in
easily.
"Its like one and one," Bademosi says, talk
ing about Whalen and Luck's chemistry.
"Aw, don't come too flat," Luck grimaces
after he and Whalen miss for the first time of
the day. "We've gotta do that again."
They practice the route three more times
before moving on.
Fleener and Luck tower over Whalen as
