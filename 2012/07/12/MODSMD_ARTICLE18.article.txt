## MUSIC SMOOTH SAILING Frank Ocean talks heartbreak, history and healing in eloquent debut 
### â€“ natasha AVERY contact natasha: navery@stanford. edu 
Frank Ocean is 24 years
old. It's easy to forget this
given that he has written
for Beyonce, sung on "Watch
The Throne" and released the
most important and critically
acclaimed mixtape of 2011. The

youthful ambition of "channel
ORANGE," however, gives him
away. It's bold, both musically
and thematically, and the enthu
siasm with which Ocean throws
himself into each of his songs
sometimes in vain is a point-

Ed reminder that this long-await
ed album is a debut, albeit an
excellent one.
After the opening track,
"Start," which contains a smat
tering of the household and elec
tronic noises that Ocean is

already known for, "channel"
presents a revamped "Thinkin
Bout You." Whereas Ocean's
stripped-down, Tumblr-released
demo echoed the conversational
sprezzatura of the lyrics, the
album version, complete with
multi-tracked vocals and an
echoed drumbeat, sounds almost
over-thought.
After the bedroom slow jam
"Sierra Leone," Ocean toys with
the idea of disillusionment on
"Sweet Life," a Pharrell Williams
co-write that shows just what
upscale production can do.
Complete with The Neptunes
style instrumentation, "Sweet
Life" is smart and crisp. " Wliy
see the world / When you've got
the beach?" Ocean asks as he
fleshes out the question of privi
lege, setting the stage for "Super
Rich Kids," a standout track fea
turing Earl Sweatshirt of Odd
Future, the hip-hop collective of
which Ocean is also a member.
The combination of Ocean's
silky vocals and Earl's spot-on
matter-of-factness ("Too many

bottles of this wine we can't pro
nounce") captures the voices of
jaded Los Angeles youth.
Ocean gets ahead of himself
with "Pilot Jones" and "Crack
Rock," the most overtly topical
songs on the album. Tired tropes
such as "My brother get popped /
And don't no one hear the sound"
are unnatural coming from
Ocean; his songwriting strength
lies in moments, not generalities.
"Pyramids" serves as the
centerpiece of the album.
Clocking in at 10 minutes,
"Pyramids" is an epic in three
parts, showcasing Ocean's lyrical
talents as he tells the story of
Cleopatra and her modern-day
counterpart, beautifully juxta
posing images of opulence and
poverty.
The second half of the
album is much smoother: From
the summery "Lost" to the sen
suous "White," Ocean packs his
tracks with small yet exquisite

surprises. "Monks" explores the
higher end of Ocean's vocal reg
ister, drawing inevitable Stevie
Wonder comparisons, while
"Pink Matter" pairs soulful con
templation with an excellent
guest verse from Andre 3000.

Where "Crack Rock" fails,
"Bad Religion" succeeds. Ocean
tackles the issues of religion and
self-discovery through the cre
ation of a nuanced, sympathetic
character on a wonderfully bare
track. "Bad Religion" threatens

to erupt into spectacle several
times but holds back, exposing a
rare vulnerability in the vocals.

Frank Ocean is credited on
his album as a musician, vocalist
and producer, but above all,
Ocean emerges from "channel

ORANGE" as a storyteller. His
name is absent from the album
cover, indicative of his approach
and dedication to his craft.
"Channel ORANGE"
deserves to be attended to with
the lyrics sheet in hand. And best

of all, Frank Ocean is only 24,
promising to be around for years
to come.
