## MARINA AND THE DIAMONDS Welcome to the life of ELECTRA HEART 
### â€“ heidi SIGUA contact heidi: hsigua3l@stanford. edu 
There comes a point in every post-breakup rit
ual when a girl gets angry, changes her hair
color and becomes vocal about vengeance.
During an era of Adele withdrawals, Marina and the
Diamonds' second album, "Electra Heart," and I
met at this particular intersection. Together, we've
survived botched pixie cuts, peroxide-blonde dye

jobs, the transition from student to unemployment
and a bevy of Mr. Not-So-Rights. The concept
album "Electra Heart" summons Marina's alter ego

a shadow sister called Electra Heart who has
chopped and screwed her long dark locks for a

Madonna-like hairstyle and sound. No longer the
quirky alterna-girl who asked, " Why woidd you want
to be a Hollywood wife?" in her 2010 single

"Hollywood," the new Marina has assumed the cari
cature of "housewife, beauty queen, home-wrecker,
idle teen," but she does so as a sacrificial model to
the wreckage of male expectations.
In her opening track, "Bubblegum Bitch,"
Marina welcomes you to the life of Electra Heart in
true power-punk fashion, with an upbeat tempo and
diabetic-sweet lyrics like " Candy vest, sweetie pie,
wanna be adored / I'm the girl you die for." However,
her lemonade lyrics aren't without bite, as she fol
lows that stanza with lyrics on the reality of an
unhealthy love: "I chew you up and I spit you out /
'Cause that's what your love is all about."
The insatiable lead single "Primadonna" follows
with an orchestra of the disco-house beat and synth
that overpopulates radio today, but she revamps it
to create a more original, operatic sound a la

Florence Welch. Essentially, this homage to high
maintenance diva status doesn't make me want to
duct-tape my ears shut like Lana del Rey does with
her melancholy belting. For those unable to translate
my hyperboles, "Primadonna" is pretty great as far
as generic catchy singles go.
"Radioactive" has a similar synth and house
vibe, but with a more powerful urgency to remove
pleasantries and approach darker sentiments with
out the satirical guise. She confronts her ex-lover's
duplicity with an accusatory directness: "In the night
your heart is full / And by the morning empty / Well
baby, I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who
left me." If that isn't a scorned woman's anthem,

then Alanis Morissette has always been lucky in love.
(Hint: she hasn't been.)
Both self-destructive and fiercely honest, "Electra
Heart" is a dialogue of the post-breakup rage and
"man-sanity" that has inspired testaments of talent
throughout music history (Joan Jett, the godmother of
punk, would not approve of this kind of blasphemy).
If this hyperbole seems overwrought with fan-girl
worship, Marina and the Diamond's "Electra Heart"
can at least be designated as a great soundtrack for ex
boyfriend effigy burning, mixed martial arts training
and target practice. Save your internship money from
Katy Perry's watered-down electro-pop on the big
screen and download "Electra Heart" instead.
