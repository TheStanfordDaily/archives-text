## STUDENT LIFE Learning how to be a mentor Students use their summer breaks to find and become teachers to others

From developing open platforms for educational
start-ups to helping empower at-risk youth in Red
wood City, several Stanford students working at
Stanford or in the Bay Area this summer are foster
ing close mentorships as part of their summer work.
Joseph Abbott 'l4, a computer science major cur
rently living in Crothers, hopes to hone in on his inter
ests in computer science and education through an in
ternship with Root-1, an educational start-up based
in Mountain View. He complements this internship
with tutoring on the side.
Just one year since its founding, Root-1 has tested
new platforms for education with charter schools
around the Bay Area. The start-up focuses on mid
dle- and high school-level content and creates appli
cations with an open platform for teachers to add
original or available content to games. Subjects range
from vocabulary and sentence structure to mathe
matics.

One of the most definitive aspects of Abbott's ex
perience this summer is his close work with several
ex-Google engineers in his company.
"We found out that every engineer had one intern
matched up," Abbott said, adding that because of
this, his learning experience so far has much more en
riching and demanding than previous summer jobs.
Last summer, Abbott tutored in his hometown in
Texas.

"My appointed engineer and I actually have a lot
in common, and I think that's why we were paired
up," he said. "He is extremely thorough and pays
great attention to detail. That is something I really ap
preciate as a novice in programming who is just trying
to get a feel for how industry-quality code looks and
works."

For Patrick Lee 'l4, an intended chemistry major,
his summer job performing research for the Depart
ment of Chemistry is his first real job. Lee received a
Bing Grant to work in Professor Chaitan Khosla's
chemistry lab doing research on inhibitors of bacteria
with a Type 111 secretion system, such as salmonella,
yersinia and chlamydia. Lee says the project is vital
