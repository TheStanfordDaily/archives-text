## STUDENT LIFE Learning how to be a mentor Students use their summer breaks to find and become teachers to others 
### EDITH PRECIADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From developing open platforms for educational
start-ups to helping empower at-risk youth in Red
wood City, several Stanford students working at
Stanford or in the Bay Area this summer are foster
ing close mentorships as part of their summer work.
Joseph Abbott 'l4, a computer science major cur
rently living in Crothers, hopes to hone in on his inter
ests in computer science and education through an in
ternship with Root-1, an educational start-up based
in Mountain View. He complements this internship
with tutoring on the side.
Just one year since its founding, Root-1 has tested
new platforms for education with charter schools
around the Bay Area. The start-up focuses on mid
dle- and high school-level content and creates appli
cations with an open platform for teachers to add
original or available content to games. Subjects range
from vocabulary and sentence structure to mathe
matics.

One of the most definitive aspects of Abbott's ex
perience this summer is his close work with several
ex-Google engineers in his company.
"We found out that every engineer had one intern
matched up," Abbott said, adding that because of
this, his learning experience so far has much more en
riching and demanding than previous summer jobs.
Last summer, Abbott tutored in his hometown in
Texas.

"My appointed engineer and I actually have a lot
in common, and I think that's why we were paired
up," he said. "He is extremely thorough and pays
great attention to detail. That is something I really ap
preciate as a novice in programming who is just trying
to get a feel for how industry-quality code looks and
works."

For Patrick Lee 'l4, an intended chemistry major,
his summer job performing research for the Depart
ment of Chemistry is his first real job. Lee received a
Bing Grant to work in Professor Chaitan Khosla's
chemistry lab doing research on inhibitors of bacteria
with a Type 111 secretion system, such as salmonella,
yersinia and chlamydia. Lee says the project is vital
because natural inhibitors of
these bacteria are slow, inefficient
and difficult to isolate.

For Lee, mentorships have
also played a key role in shaping
his success to date in his fellow
ship. A postdoctoral mentor has
been overseeing Lee's project,
giving him tips on safety and
teaching him relevant techniques,
such as how to use nuclear mag
netic resonance spectroscopy.
"I have a huge amount of re
spect for how he is able to attend
to his own projects and help me
out at the same time," Lee said,
adding that he found the general
aura of excitement produced by
the older mentors in the lab moti
vating.

"I really admire the enthusi
asm and dedication of the gradu
ate students and postdoctoral fel
lows in the lab," said Lee. "It's
truly exciting to know you're in
the midst of cutting-edge re
search, and it's inspiring to see
such commitment from the lab
members day in and day out."

Michael Celentano 'l4 is a re
search assistant for Physics Pro
fessor Giorgio Gratta, doing re
search on radiation oncology. Ce
lentano is studying how tumor
motions affect radiation.

Celentano says he is excited
about his summer research this
year, which is much more fast
paced than his physics research in
summers past.
"The potential to help cancer
patients is very exciting," Celen
tano said.

He added that the products he
is working on might be imple
mented in treatments in Stanford
Hospital and Clinics.

For other Stanford students

doing work in the area, mentor
ship is part of the job description
itself.

Alemar Brito 'l5 plans to pur
sue a career in education. He finds
his community service work-study
internship with Sequoia High
School in Redwood City this sum
mer well suited to that end.

Among his several roles at Se
quoia, Brito teaches leadership
and English-language develop
ment classes for at-risk ninth
graders and English-language
learner (ELL) students, respec
tively. He also works for a pro
gram that helps motivate trou
blesome students.

As one of his projects, Brito
guides students in creating a doc
umentary to help empower them
through self-expression. He also
heads resume and interview
workshops for ELL students.
"[These students] have so
much to offer," Brito said.
"[They have] experiences that
many people do not have, but
they feel that their lack of Eng
lish skills hinders them from
reaching their dreams. It is my
job to help them realize they can
do it."

Brito's family background has
encouraged his passion for ser
vice work and his affinity for fos
tering close mentorship positions
with underprivileged youth.
"I come from a family where
helping those who cannot help
themselves is emphasized more
than anything else," Brito said.
"My experience so far has been
amazing. This is not my first time
teaching kids, but this is the first
time I have [taught] material that
I find to be extremely crucial to
the students' development and
identity creation."

These student mentees and
mentors urge other Stanford stu
dents looking into research or in
ternship positions in the area to
take advantage of opportunities
by scoping out best-fit on-campus
research opportunities and in
ternships. They also recommend
fostering links with co-workers,
who can often become close men
tors or mentees.

"I would advise to be proac
tive and as dedicated as possible,"
Lee said. "With these research
experiences, you get out what you
put in."

quoia, Brito teaches leadership
and English-language develop
ment classes for at-risk ninth
graders and English-language
learner (ELL) students, respec
tively. He also works for a pro
gram that helps motivate trou
blesome students.

As one of his projects, Brito
guides students in creating a doc
umentary to help empower them
through self-expression. He also
heads resume and interview
workshops for ELL students.
"[These students] have so
much to offer," Brito said.
"[They have] experiences that
many people do not have, but
they feel that their lack of Eng
lish skills hinders them from
reaching their dreams. It is my
job to help them realize they can
do it."

Brito's family background has
encouraged his passion for ser
vice work and his affinity for fos
tering close mentorship positions
with underprivileged youth.
"I come from a family where
helping those who cannot help
themselves is emphasized more
than anything else," Brito said.
"My experience so far has been
amazing. This is not my first time
teaching kids, but this is the first
time I have [taught] material that
I find to be extremely crucial to
the students' development and
identity creation."

These student mentees and
mentors urge other Stanford stu
dents looking into research or in
ternship positions in the area to
take advantage of opportunities
by scoping out best-fit on-campus
research opportunities and in
ternships. They also recommend
fostering links with co-workers,
who can often become close men
tors or mentees.

"I would advise to be proac
tive and as dedicated as possible,"
Lee said. "With these research
experiences, you get out what you
put in."

From developing open platforms for educational
start-ups to helping empower at-risk youth in Red
wood City, several Stanford students working at
Stanford or in the Bay Area this summer are foster
ing close mentorships as part of their summer work.
Joseph Abbott 'l4, a computer science major cur
rently living in Crothers, hopes to hone in on his inter
ests in computer science and education through an in
ternship with Root-1, an educational start-up based
in Mountain View. He complements this internship
with tutoring on the side.
Just one year since its founding, Root-1 has tested
new platforms for education with charter schools
around the Bay Area. The start-up focuses on mid
dle- and high school-level content and creates appli
cations with an open platform for teachers to add
original or available content to games. Subjects range
from vocabulary and sentence structure to mathe
matics.

One of the most definitive aspects of Abbott's ex
perience this summer is his close work with several
ex-Google engineers in his company.
"We found out that every engineer had one intern
matched up," Abbott said, adding that because of
this, his learning experience so far has much more en
riching and demanding than previous summer jobs.
Last summer, Abbott tutored in his hometown in
Texas.

"My appointed engineer and I actually have a lot
in common, and I think that's why we were paired
up," he said. "He is extremely thorough and pays
great attention to detail. That is something I really ap
preciate as a novice in programming who is just trying
to get a feel for how industry-quality code looks and
works."

For Patrick Lee 'l4, an intended chemistry major,
his summer job performing research for the Depart
ment of Chemistry is his first real job. Lee received a
Bing Grant to work in Professor Chaitan Khosla's
chemistry lab doing research on inhibitors of bacteria
with a Type 111 secretion system, such as salmonella,
yersinia and chlamydia. Lee says the project is vital
because natural inhibitors of
these bacteria are slow, inefficient
and difficult to isolate.

For Lee, mentorships have
also played a key role in shaping
his success to date in his fellow
ship. A postdoctoral mentor has
been overseeing Lee's project,
giving him tips on safety and
teaching him relevant techniques,
such as how to use nuclear mag
netic resonance spectroscopy.
"I have a huge amount of re
spect for how he is able to attend
to his own projects and help me
out at the same time," Lee said,
adding that he found the general
aura of excitement produced by
the older mentors in the lab moti
vating.

"I really admire the enthusi
asm and dedication of the gradu
ate students and postdoctoral fel
lows in the lab," said Lee. "It's
truly exciting to know you're in
the midst of cutting-edge re
search, and it's inspiring to see
such commitment from the lab
members day in and day out."

Michael Celentano 'l4 is a re
search assistant for Physics Pro
fessor Giorgio Gratta, doing re
search on radiation oncology. Ce
lentano is studying how tumor
motions affect radiation.

Celentano says he is excited
about his summer research this
year, which is much more fast
paced than his physics research in
summers past.
"The potential to help cancer
patients is very exciting," Celen
tano said.

He added that the products he
is working on might be imple
mented in treatments in Stanford
Hospital and Clinics.

For other Stanford students

doing work in the area, mentor
ship is part of the job description
itself.

Alemar Brito 'l5 plans to pur
sue a career in education. He finds
his community service work-study
internship with Sequoia High
School in Redwood City this sum
mer well suited to that end.
