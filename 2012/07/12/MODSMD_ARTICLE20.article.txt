## MARKET RESEARCH Tea parties at Yale with Ludacris, and how Stanford and Hogwarts don't mix SASH ANGELES

Stanford is the only school I ever
wanted to go to before I knew it
was hard to get in to, before I knew it
was even a good school. I just thought it
was cute. Like most things in life, I was
attracted to the packaging. Call me shallow
but it worked out, amirite?

I have this theory that unless you're in
a market, it's really hard to gauge the prag
matic dynamics within it. For me one of
these foreign markets is alcohol. You see, I
don't drink, and I've realized only in
recent months I may never fully under
stand the brand value of most alcoholic
beverages. I thought Smirnoff was good
but apparently it's the Pontiac of vodka. I

was fooled by all the "Mad Men" integra
tions. This isn't terribly sad, save for the
reality that when my friend Paco says Delta
Dude* is the Popov of fraternities, I have
to phone a friend or Google it to decipher
any meaning.

But markets don't exclusively refer to
products. Take, for example, the populari
ty matrix of a grade above or below you in
school. You can try to use heuristics like

friend groups and attractiveness to deter
mine the relationships and/or hierarchy,
but it doesn't always work. In high school
that phenomenon helped out a kid in my
year named Tom, who, though awkward
and dweebish to most of my grade, was
empirically fit and so was desired by many
a younger lady and even the occasional lad.
And yet the most pressing example of
this phenomenon, the faulty advertising, is
what occurs when I try to understand
schools other than Stanford.

Because I never wanted to go any
where else, I never really considered what
it would be like to go there, the one excep
tion being that when I pictured myself at
Yale, I was always wearing a constricting
blue V-neck with accent-white stripe and

giant Y, sometimes in reverse colors, seat
ed Indian-style in a crowded college at the
feet of Ludacris and an anonymous white
male moderator while we all threw our

heads back in laughter and sipped tea from
fine china. This fantasy/expectation is the
direct result of a Yale tour group in which
the guide described a recent visit from
Luda to a "tea party" which he concluded
by saying, and I quote, "Ludacris loves
Yale." This savory admissions nugget
would go on to be my mother's key

ammunition to try to convince me to go to
Yale. If nothing else, let that seemingly
tangential anecdote illustrate how easily
distorted are the workings of university
marketing. Aha! Aristotelian I am!
Now, being away from Stanford and
in the thick of things at UCLA's unofficial
campus, Westwood, combined with the

fact that I'm an Alabama native and know
only Alabama (good) and Auburn (evil),
I'm confronted with the difficulty of
understanding anything about other uni
versities. Not just the prestige, but actually
