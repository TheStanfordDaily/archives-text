## UNCAGED Zac Brown Band explores the lighter side of country 
### â€“ margaret LIN contact margaret: margaretglin@gmail. com 
In the past few years, Zac
Brown Band has been best
known for its sad but touch
ing acoustic singles that consistent
ly achieve the top spot on the
Billboard country charts. However,
its latest album, "Uncaged," con
nects more with the band's roots:
relaxed and upbeat music that
brightens the soul.
Brown's fifth album,
"Uncaged," released on fuly 10
by Atlantic Records, Home
Grown and Bigger Picture,
reveals an almost tropical side of
the traditional western country
artist. While all the songs ooze
this relaxed mood, the one song
that fully exudes it is "Island
Song." As the song's name
implies, the lyrics concentrate
mostly on relaxing at a beach

with music, drinks and dance. By
exaggerating the r's in rum and
using a ukulele in place of a gui
tar, it's easy to imagine relaxing
on a beach in a hammock while
a nearby band plays this light,
upbeat song.
Despite displaying this new
style, the band stays close to its
western roots with its lead single
"The Wind." A fast, upbeat love
song, "The Wind" contrasts with
the band's past hit singles, which
focused more on the tragedies of
life. It serves as a good example of
Zac Brown Band's ability to convey
any mood through song, whether
it's depression or jubilation.
The one fault in this almost
perfect country album is the
third song on the album,
"Goodbye In Her Eyes." Not

only is it reminiscent of almost
every other country break-up

song, but the song also drags on
far too long to capture the short
term interest of today's audience.
It repeats the line "I saw goodbye

in her eyes" enough to make
someone never want to hear
those words again.
However, in all, Zac Brown
Band has released yet another
solid record that is sure to put

many more No. 1 country sin
gles under this band's belt.
