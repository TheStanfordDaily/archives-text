# STUDENT LIFE
## Students frustrated by lines at Arrillaga dining 
### RACHEL BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
It's 6 p.m. on a Thursday.
High school students in suits
surround the doors of the Ar
rillaga Family Dining Com
mons business conference
attendees.

Inside the building, the
stairs are crammed with stu
dents dodging dozens of sum
mer campers traveling up and
down. The line extends down
the stairs, but today is not as
bad as when it extends outside
or wraps around to Escondido
Road. As I move farther up
the line, a whiteboard with a
colorfully written schedule on
it becomes visible: Eight sum
mer programs are scheduled
to dine at Arrillaga between 5
p.m. and 6:15 p.m.
With most dining halls re
served for summer confer
ences or closed for renova
tions, Arrillaga is the only din
ing hall open to students, fac
ulty and staff this summer.
With The Axe and Palm
closed, Olives staying open for
shorter hours and Lagunita
Dining only serving students
living in certain residences,

students are left with limited
summer dining options.
Once through the crowd, I
swipe through, only to be met
with many shorter lines to
brave. In the background of a
loud sea of voices, I hear dish
es fall to the floor. Lines form
up behind the silverware, the
drink machine and the frozen
yogurt, and even French fries
require a wait.

After finally getting my
food, I meet the next obstacle:
seating. High school students
fill the tables, with the occa
sional Stanford student scat
tered about. A girl passes me,
complaining to her friend that
there is nowhere to sit. I look
around and see she's right. I
check outside on the balcony,
with no luck. I take a peek at
the other side of the dining
hall. Also full. Finally, some
one gets up to leave, and I take
his spot.
"It's super crowded and
they run out of food quickly,"
said Jessica Waldman 'l5. "I'm
spending my whole paycheck
on this meal plan, but the place
is being taken over by high
