## The 						humble beginnings of a sandwich superstar 
### DAVID ENG DAILY INTERN 
Ike Shehadeh had reached his break
ing point.
The 29-year-old San Francisco native
had dropped out of college to start a super
market business, only to see it fall apart a
few years later. He was sleeping anywhere
he could, including in vans and on friends'
couches pretty much anywhere he

could find shelter. For months, he even
called an abandoned warehouse without
electricity his home.
"I felt terrible," Shehadeh said, reflect
ing on the experience. "I needed to get out
of there. I wanted to make sure that I was
going to at least try my business."
So on Halloween in 2007, just three
months after he was bagging groceries at a
local Trader Joe's grocery store, Shehadeh
opened up shop in San Francisco's Castro

neighborhood a modest 400-square
foot hole-in-the-wall sandwich eatery. He
called it Ike's Place.
That first night, Shehadeh didn't sell a
single sandwich.
"It was one of the worst days of my
life," he said.
Nearly five years later, customers who
gorge themselves on one of the 20,000
mouth-watering sandwiches that
Ike's Place sells every week may be
surprised by the restaurant's hum
ble beginnings. Far more remark
able, however, is the journey of its
owner.

"I remember a moment, about
three months before I opened up
Ike's, I thought about all of the
things that I thought about growing
up about being something spe
cial," he said. "I realized that maybe
none of it was ever going to happen,
maybe I wasn't going to be anything,
maybe I wasn't meant to be any
thing."
Since hitting that emotional
"rock bottom" in July of 2007, She
hadeh has taken steps to rebuild his
life through his burgeoning busi
ness. Although he does not dwell on
those times much anymore, She
hadeh derives a sense of sustained
motivation from his experiences.
"Right now, I don't really look
back upon my past as a negative at
all. I find it inspiring, he said. "I find
it humorous. I find it refreshing
that I was able to be in all those
places and still have the ability to not
let it keep me."
Having escaped from those
places, Ike started his own Place,
and revisited his childhood in the
process.

"When I was eight years old, I re
member I would always turn my
leftover meals into sandwiches," he
said. "So when I was looking to get
into the food industry, I just wanted
to open up a sandwich place."

And Shehadeh made sandwich
es. Lots of them.

The eclectic menu, which fea
tures hundreds of distinct offerings,
indirectly resulted from Shehadeh's
lack of spending money as a young
restaurateur. When he first opened

Ike's Place, Shehadeh could only af
ford to "eat in" at his own restau
rant.

"Eating three to five sandwiches
a day, I was definitely looking for
some more variety, so the menu
started expanding," he said.

Shehadeh claims to have eaten
1,000 of his own sandwiches in 2008,
including the #1 Elvis Kieth (halal
chicken, teriyaki sauce, wasabi
mayo and Swiss cheese) sandwich
for 90 consecutive days.
An avid sports enthusiast, She
hadeh has also invented sandwiches
representing some of the San Fran
cisco Giants pitchers, such as the
"Matt Cain," which was named
ESPN's greatest sports sandwich in
the country for 2011. This past year,
he developed a sandwich in the like
ness of a San Francisco 49ers player
in exchange for NFC Championship
tickets.

"It was a good trade... for both
of us," Shehadeh chuckled.
Apart from the variety present in
the menu, many other elements of
Shehadeh's life before fame have re
vealed themselves in Ike's Place, in
cluding the one ingredient slathered
onto all of his sandwiches: his secret
"dirty sauce." The "especially deli

cious" mayonnaise-based spread is
a variation of a sauce he invented by
accident while still the manager of
his supermarket business.
"A customer came in and they
wanted me to make them garlic
bread, but I didn't have the ingredi
ents to make garlic bread I didn't
have garlic," he said. "And so we
mixed this sauce. It was a little bit of
every single spice we had in the
deli."

When he is not managing one of
his eight Ike's Place locations, She
hadeh enjoys studying neuro-lin
guistic programming (a branch of
psychotherapy), acupuncture, Chi
nese herbs and leadership. "Wher
ever it is I perceive I have a weak
ness, I study that," he said.
With two new Bay Area store
fronts opened in the past two weeks,
business is booming. But how far
will Shehadeh take it?

"As long as there's a demand,
there's going to be a next store; I'm
really taking it location by location,"
he said. "And if it stops today, I'd
still feel blessed with a wonderful
life."

have garlic," he said. "And so we
mixed this sauce. It was a little bit of
every single spice we had in the
deli."

When he is not managing one of
his eight Ike's Place locations, She
hadeh enjoys studying neuro-lin
guistic programming (a branch of
psychotherapy), acupuncture, Chi
nese herbs and leadership. "Wher
ever it is I perceive I have a weak
ness, I study that," he said.
With two new Bay Area store
fronts opened in the past two weeks,
business is booming. But how far
will Shehadeh take it?

"As long as there's a demand,
there's going to be a next store; I'm
really taking it location by location,"
he said. "And if it stops today, I'd
still feel blessed with a wonderful
life."

Ike Shehadeh, owner of the Ike's Place sandwich franchise, stands outside his shop in the Huang Engineering Center at Stanford.
Ike Shehadeh had reached his break
ing point.
The 29-year-old San Francisco native
had dropped out of college to start a super
market business, only to see it fall apart a
few years later. He was sleeping anywhere
he could, including in vans and on friends'
couches pretty much anywhere he

could find shelter. For months, he even
called an abandoned warehouse without
electricity his home.
"I felt terrible," Shehadeh said, reflect
ing on the experience. "I needed to get out
of there. I wanted to make sure that I was
going to at least try my business."
So on Halloween in 2007, just three
months after he was bagging groceries at a
local Trader Joe's grocery store, Shehadeh
opened up shop in San Francisco's Castro

neighborhood a modest 400-square
foot hole-in-the-wall sandwich eatery. He
called it Ike's Place.
That first night, Shehadeh didn't sell a
single sandwich.
"It was one of the worst days of my
life," he said.
Nearly five years later, customers who
gorge themselves on one of the 20,000
mouth-watering sandwiches that
Ike's Place sells every week may be
surprised by the restaurant's hum
ble beginnings. Far more remark
able, however, is the journey of its
owner.

"I remember a moment, about
three months before I opened up
Ike's, I thought about all of the
things that I thought about growing
up about being something spe
cial," he said. "I realized that maybe
none of it was ever going to happen,
maybe I wasn't going to be anything,
maybe I wasn't meant to be any
thing."
Since hitting that emotional
"rock bottom" in July of 2007, She
hadeh has taken steps to rebuild his
life through his burgeoning busi
ness. Although he does not dwell on
those times much anymore, She
hadeh derives a sense of sustained
motivation from his experiences.
"Right now, I don't really look
back upon my past as a negative at
all. I find it inspiring, he said. "I find
it humorous. I find it refreshing
that I was able to be in all those
places and still have the ability to not
let it keep me."
Having escaped from those
places, Ike started his own Place,
and revisited his childhood in the
process.

"When I was eight years old, I re
member I would always turn my
leftover meals into sandwiches," he
said. "So when I was looking to get
into the food industry, I just wanted
to open up a sandwich place."

And Shehadeh made sandwich
es. Lots of them.

The eclectic menu, which fea
tures hundreds of distinct offerings,
indirectly resulted from Shehadeh's
lack of spending money as a young
restaurateur. When he first opened

Ike's Place, Shehadeh could only af
ford to "eat in" at his own restau
rant.

"Eating three to five sandwiches
a day, I was definitely looking for
some more variety, so the menu
started expanding," he said.

Shehadeh claims to have eaten
1,000 of his own sandwiches in 2008,
including the #1 Elvis Kieth (halal
chicken, teriyaki sauce, wasabi
mayo and Swiss cheese) sandwich
for 90 consecutive days.
An avid sports enthusiast, She
hadeh has also invented sandwiches
representing some of the San Fran
cisco Giants pitchers, such as the
"Matt Cain," which was named
ESPN's greatest sports sandwich in
the country for 2011. This past year,
he developed a sandwich in the like
ness of a San Francisco 49ers player
in exchange for NFC Championship
tickets.

"It was a good trade... for both
of us," Shehadeh chuckled.
Apart from the variety present in
the menu, many other elements of
Shehadeh's life before fame have re
vealed themselves in Ike's Place, in
cluding the one ingredient slathered
onto all of his sandwiches: his secret
"dirty sauce." The "especially deli

cious" mayonnaise-based spread is
a variation of a sauce he invented by
accident while still the manager of
his supermarket business.
"A customer came in and they
wanted me to make them garlic
bread, but I didn't have the ingredi
ents to make garlic bread I didn't
have garlic," he said. "And so we
mixed this sauce. It was a little bit of
every single spice we had in the
