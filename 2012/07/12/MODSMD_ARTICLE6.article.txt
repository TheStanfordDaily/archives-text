## SLAC scientists react to Higgs 
### AMRUTHA DORAI DAILY INTERN 
Although the July 3 announcement regard
ing the discovery of the Higgs boson particle
was made in Geneva, Switzerland, physicists at
the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in
Menlo Park were anything but distanced from
the discovery.
Some Stanford researchers were there in
Geneva. Ten Stanford-affiliated physicists
were on location working for CERN at the Eu
ropean Laboratory for Particle Physics, some
were in attendance at the International Confer
ence of High Energy Physics in Melbourne,
Australia, and some 25 theorists and six experi
mentalists waited until midnight to watch the
announcement from SLAC itself.
The announcement revealed the findings of
two independent research projects based at the
Large Hadron Collider in Geneva Compact
Muon Solenoid (CMS) and ATLAS which
confirmed the existence of a particle that fit the
profile constructed for the Higgs boson after
years of speculation. Several SLAC physicists
played a role in the ATLAS project.
"We saw the ... reconstructed mass from
the two experiments was roughly the same, 125
to 126 gigaelectron volts," said SLAC experi
mental physicist Tim Barklow. "They both saw
roughly the same signal and the same decay
modes and roughly the same mass. And they

both achieved that independently, so it was just
absolute confirmation that a new particle had
been seen."

The important discovery of the particle re
sulted in an outpouring of praise and awe from
scientists across the globe. The Higgs boson
would explain the origin of mass through the es
tablishment of a Higgs field, a Ã¼biquitous quan
tum field responsibly for giving elementary par
ticles their mass.

"What's important is this thing called the
Higgs field... and that's what makes things
have mass, that's what makes things even
exist," said Andy Freeberg, director of media
relations for SLAC. "So finding this Higgs
boson, this particle, is sort of evidence for the
fact that the Higgs field exists."
Freeberg compares the Higgs field to a mag
netic field. While in a magnetic field, objects are
acted upon based on their mass, and a Higgs
field would in and of itself determine this mass.
The mass would be decided based on the extent
to which the Higgs field interacts with different
types of particles.
"The Higgs boson confirms what has been a
crucial part of our understanding of subatomic
particles for several decades," Barklow said.
"[lt] has been theorized to give mass to all the
fundamental particles in nature. And... the
particle associated with this Higgs field has now
been discovered after decades of searching."
On top of the 40-odd SLAC physicists who

played a direct role in the ATLAS project, re
search conducted at SLAC in the 1990s also
paved the way for the discovery of the particle.
Although SLAC's particle collider is no longer
in use, it facilitated research on the Z boson, an
other elementary particle. The understanding of
the Z boson "helped determined where to look
for the Higgs boson," according to Freeburg.
Despite this landmark discovery in physics,
however, both Barklow and Freeberg say that
there is still much more ground to cover. The
complexities of the Higgs boson and Higgs field
still need to be mapped out. Their hope is that
pinning down these specifics will allow the
world of physics to apply this knowledge to
other pressing questions, such as the existence
of supersymmetry.
"This really key model, the standard model
of physics, works," Freeburg said, "and all of
the major pieces are potentially now in place."
