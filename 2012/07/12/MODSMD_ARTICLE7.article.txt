## ASSU Executive plans to shrink cabinet, give less in stipends 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
The 2012-2013 ASSU Executive cabinet
will be significantly smaller and cost less
money, according to incoming ASSU Presi
dent Robbie Zimbroff 'l2.

"This year's cabinet is going to be much
leaner than last year's," Zimbroff said in an
email to The Daily. "The target number is
around three or four people." That's a signif
icant cut from the 19 appointed by 2011-2012
ASSU Executive Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.
"[The change] also coincides with a shift
in philosophy," he said. "The main impetus
for change is ... common sense, just doing
what will work ... instead of having a 'Chair
of Food' or a 'Chair of Social Entrepreneur
ship.'"

Noting the need for greater diversity,
Zimbroff and his vice president, William
Wagstaff 'l2, have not designated specific
cabinet roles on the application. "We are
looking for people that come from diverse

academic and co-curricular backgrounds,"
Zimbroff said.

"Our cabinet members will have experi
ence interacting with administrators and the
resourcefulness to handle student issues in
several different areas," Wagstaff said. "One
of the best things cabinet members can do is
have a sense of 'the bigger picture,' how all
the moving parts of student life fit together."
Along with fewer cabinet members,
salaries are expected to change as well.
$7,000 was set aside for the executive cabinet
from the past fiscal year's budget, and Zim
broff believes the full amount will not be
used this year because of the changes.
"How much of [the budget] we actually
use to pay our cabinet depends on the [exact]
number of people we end up hiring," he said.
"The money unused for ... stipends will be
allocated back to student activities during
the year."

"Generally, the cabinet members will be
paid more, because there are fewer of them,"
he added.

A third change that will occur is the sepa-

ration of the Community Action Board
(CAB) from the ASSU Executive. Accord
ing to Wagstaff, the CAB will now function
as an ASSU-chartered organization under
the advisement of Tommy Lee Woon, asso
ciate dean of educational resources.

"The idea behind this change was to make
the CAB a stable body at Stanford, indepen
dent of the changing priorities of the ASSU
Executive, and to increase the institutional
knowledge with support from administra
tors," Wagstaff said.
With the changes to the CAB, decreasing
salary payout across the cabinet and a de
crease in the number of people involved,
Zimbroff and Wagstaff hope to stress team
work and create a streamlined, balanced Ex
ecutive.

"The goal is to create a tight-knit team,"
Zimbroff said. "Strong teams work well bal
ancing individual and group efforts, and
that's what we're shooting for here."
