## Woods Institute funds interdisciplinary projects 
### CYNTHIA MAO DAILY INTERN 
The Woods Institute for the
Environment awarded $833,000
in Environmental Venture Pro
ject (EVP) grants on June 25,
adding to the $7.2 million total it
has given to fund research pro
jects since 2004. Grants are
awarded to projects that seek to
solve environmental and sustain
ability problems.
"What we want are proposals
that are high risk, transformative
and have the potential to pro
duce solutions to major environ
mental challenges," said EVP
program manager Kelly Dayton.
This year, the faculty commit
tee received 26 letters of intent
that were narrowed down to 11
before an executive committee
selected the final five projects to
receive funding.
Dayton said projects should
also show intellectual merit, in
novation and "sizzle," the com
mittee's indicator of how exciting
the research is and how it pushes
the boundaries of science.

"The name of the game is in
terdisciplinary," said James
Jones, senior fellow at the Woods
Institute and co-chair of the EVP
faculty committee. "We have to
have proposals that have a real
sense of interdisciplinary ap
proaches to environmental prob
lems. ... One requirement of the
program is that you have two
principal investigators from dif
ferent departments. Ideally, they
do really different things."
According to Dayton, the
program brings diverse facul
ties together, particularly those
that have not collaborated be
fore, and introduces new schol
arly communities to the Woods
Institute.

"It's really... to encourage
the cross-pollination of the disci
plines," Dayton said. "That's re
ally where new discoveries are
made; it's not deep within a disci
pline, but at the intersection of
disciplines."
Neil Malhotra, associate pro
fessor at the Graduate School of

Business, was awarded a grant
along with Michael Tomz, associ
ate professor of political science,
and Benoit Monin, professor of
psychology. Their project on cor
porate responsibility seeks to de
termine whether environmental
practices are profitable for cor
porations.

"We want to look at... dif
ferent ways in which people in
teract with firms," Malhotra said.
"We want to see if corporate en
vironmentalism is profitable and
the conditions under which
they're possible."
According to Malhotra, there
has been an increasing amount of
pressure on corporations to help
the environment in the past few

decades, but corporations don't
know what kind of impact envi
ronmental practices can have on
the behavior of consumers.

"These environmental ques
tions are important things for so
ciety to solve," he said, "and it
looks very unlikely that the gov
ernment is going to be the way
for these problems to be solved."
Another project that received
funding from the EVP aims to
speed up the detection of bacte
ria in water.

"One of the gaps in ensuring
public health and safety is being
able to detect water quality very
quickly," said Sindy Tang, assis

Ideally, [the
projects] do
really different
things.
JAMES JONES
tant professor at the School of En
gineering and the project's princi
pal investigator. "If you have to
take 24 hours, people will have
died or at least gotten very sick be
fore the lab [results] will tell you
that the [water] is actually dirty."
The process she's developing
uses a technology called microflu
idics, the manipulation of fluids at
the micro scale. Rather than test a
liter of water for the presence of a
few bacteria, Tang will break up a
sample into millions of nanoliter
sized droplets. Only then will she
add an indicator, which changes
color based on the concentration
of bacteria. Because she will be
testing a much smaller volume of
water, bacteria concentration will
be higher and the indicator will
change color far more quickly.
Both Malhotra and Tang hope
their research will have important
environmental impact. Malhotra
plans on sharing his research with
corporations, and Tang hopes her
technology can be put in place as
soon as possible in water-scarce
areas.

Other grant recipients include
Craig Criddle, a civil and environ
mental engineering professor, and
his colleagues at the School of En
gineering Oliver Fringer and Eliz
abeth Sattely.
