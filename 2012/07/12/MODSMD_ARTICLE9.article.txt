## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Olympics shouldn't erase gender lines 
### Miles Unterreiner 
With the Summer
Olympics set to begin
July 27 in London, the
International Olympic Commit
tee (IOC) has ruled that women
with hyperandrogenism a con
dition in which the body produces
excessively high levels of andro
gens, "male" hormones with per
formance-enhancing effects
may be declared ineligible for
competition.

Prompted by several high-pro
file cases of gender ambiguity in in
ternational athletic competition
among them the controversy sur
rounding South African middle
distance runner Caster Semenya,
the 2009 world champion at 800
meters who was later found to have
unusually high levels of testos
terone and both male and female
organs the lOC's ruling has
frustrated intersex activists who
advocate for an identity-based,
rather than biology-based, classi
fication of athletes. People who
identify as women, such advo
cates have suggested, ought to be
allowed to compete as women,
regardless of their physical char
acteristics. As Barbara King
wrote at npr.org, "Excluding ath
letes who have trained and com
peted as women from the
Olympics on the basis of naturally
occurring hormones in their blood
inappropriately reduces athletic
ability to hormone levels, and gen
der to biology."
This type of argument makes
some excellent points. First, the
lOC ruling held that androgen
levels falling into the "male
range" might render hyperandro
genic female athletes ineligible.
Androgens, however, occur natu
rally in both males and females,
and just as some women are taller
than some men, some women
have higher androgen levels than
some men. It is therefore unclear
precisely why the term "male

range" should be used to describe
androgen levels, any more than
heights between 5-foot-8 and 6-
foot-5 should be called the "male
range."

Furthermore, the ruling ap
pears discriminatory on its face
male athletes with abnormally
high but naturally occurring levels
of testosterone are not subject to
expulsion from the Games. Why
should women with abnormally
high levels of androgens be subject
to regulations while men with sim
ilarly unusual levels are not?
But I ultimately disagree with
the idea that gender classifications
in competitive sport should be
made on the basis of self-defined
identity rather than biological in
dicators. Reasons unique to the
nature of athletic competition dic
tate that we decide otherwise.

First and most simply, there is a
very important purpose for draw
ing lines yes, sometimes arbi
trary and sometimes apparently
irrational between men and
women in the arena of sports that
do not exist in society at large.
That purpose is ensuring that
women have a safe, productive
and fruitful arena in which to com
pete on an equal playing field, just
as men do.

Completing the fight began
with Title IX. Without a distinc
tion between men and women on
the playing field in other
words, in a world in which the only
deciding factor was absolute per
formance there would not be a
single woman at the Olympics,
and few in college or professional
sports, today.
If we accept the necessity of
drawing some sort of line, it also
follows that there will be some
people hopefully as few as pos
sible — who fall unfairly on the
wrong side of it, much as some
teenagers are mature enough to
drink at 17 and some 30-year-olds

are not, or some 15-year-olds are
intelligent and well-informed
enough to vote and some 50-year
olds are not. Our goal should
therefore be minimizing the error
zone of a clearly necessary line,
not eliminating it altogether.

Last, unlike matters of human
rights or political equality, athletic
competition is a zero-sum game.
Gains for one at least in terms
of places, medals and points, the
primary indicators of Olympic
success are necessarily made at
the expense of another. If Athlete
A wins gold, Athlete B by defini
tion cannot. While allowing inter
sex or high-androgen individuals
to, for example, participate fully
in society, to vote and to hold jobs
on the basis of their self-identity
expands the pie of rights and abil
ities available to all, allowing in
tersex individuals with abnormal
ly high levels of male hormones to
compete as women unfairly disad
vantages other women.
Ultimately, changes to lOC
policy should certainly be made.
The science behind the logic
needs updating, more thought
should be given to defining a "nor
mal male range" and the lOC
should consider what to do with
hyperandrogenic men.

But that is insufficient reason
to do away with the concept of a
line between men and women in
sports a line that works to the
benefit of both women and the
athletic world at large.

in competitive sport should be
made on the basis of self-defined

dicators. Reasons unique to the
nature of athletic competition dic

First and most simply, there is a
very important purpose for draw
ing lines yes, sometimes arbi
trary and sometimes apparently
irrational between men and
women in the arena of sports that
do not exist in society at large.
That purpose is ensuring that
women have a safe, productive
and fruitful arena in which to com
pete on an equal playing field, just
as men do.

Completing the fight began
with Title IX. Without a distinc
tion between men and women on
the playing field in other
words, in a world in which the only
deciding factor was absolute per
formance there would not be a
single woman at the Olympics,
and few in college or professional
sports, today.
If we accept the necessity of
drawing some sort of line, it also
follows that there will be some
people hopefully as few as pos
sible — who fall unfairly on the
wrong side of it, much as some
teenagers are mature enough to
drink at 17 and some 30-year-olds

are not, or some 15-year-olds are
intelligent and well-informed
enough to vote and some 50-year
olds are not. Our goal should
therefore be minimizing the error
zone of a clearly necessary line,
not eliminating it altogether.

Last, unlike matters of human
rights or political equality, athletic
competition is a zero-sum game.
Gains for one at least in terms
of places, medals and points, the
primary indicators of Olympic
success are necessarily made at
the expense of another. If Athlete
A wins gold, Athlete B by defini
tion cannot. While allowing inter
sex or high-androgen individuals
to, for example, participate fully
in society, to vote and to hold jobs
on the basis of their self-identity
expands the pie of rights and abil
ities available to all, allowing in
tersex individuals with abnormal
ly high levels of male hormones to
compete as women unfairly disad
vantages other women.
Ultimately, changes to lOC
policy should certainly be made.
The science behind the logic
needs updating, more thought
should be given to defining a "nor
mal male range" and the lOC
should consider what to do with
hyperandrogenic men.

But that is insufficient reason
to do away with the concept of a
line between men and women in
sports a line that works to the
benefit of both women and the
athletic world at large.

With the Summer
Olympics set to begin
July 27 in London, the
International Olympic Commit
tee (IOC) has ruled that women
with hyperandrogenism a con
dition in which the body produces
excessively high levels of andro
gens, "male" hormones with per
formance-enhancing effects
may be declared ineligible for
competition.

Prompted by several high-pro
file cases of gender ambiguity in in
ternational athletic competition
among them the controversy sur
rounding South African middle
distance runner Caster Semenya,
the 2009 world champion at 800
meters who was later found to have
unusually high levels of testos
terone and both male and female
organs the lOC's ruling has
frustrated intersex activists who
advocate for an identity-based,
rather than biology-based, classi
fication of athletes. People who
identify as women, such advo
cates have suggested, ought to be
allowed to compete as women,
regardless of their physical char
acteristics. As Barbara King
wrote at npr.org, "Excluding ath
letes who have trained and com
peted as women from the
Olympics on the basis of naturally
occurring hormones in their blood
inappropriately reduces athletic
ability to hormone levels, and gen
der to biology."
This type of argument makes
some excellent points. First, the
lOC ruling held that androgen
levels falling into the "male
range" might render hyperandro
genic female athletes ineligible.
Androgens, however, occur natu
rally in both males and females,
and just as some women are taller
than some men, some women
have higher androgen levels than
some men. It is therefore unclear
precisely why the term "male

range" should be used to describe
androgen levels, any more than
heights between 5-foot-8 and 6-
foot-5 should be called the "male
range."

Furthermore, the ruling ap
pears discriminatory on its face
male athletes with abnormally
high but naturally occurring levels
of testosterone are not subject to
expulsion from the Games. Why
should women with abnormally
high levels of androgens be subject
to regulations while men with sim
ilarly unusual levels are not?
