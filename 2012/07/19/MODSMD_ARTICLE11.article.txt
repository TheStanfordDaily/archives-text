## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Obamacare lacks incentives 
### Miles Unterreiner 
"V Tith the vast majority of the
\A/ Affordable Care Act up-
Y Y held by the Supreme
Court, Obamacare or what
Paul Begala justly called "a policy
conceived by the Heritage Foun
dation, midwifed by Newt Gin
grich, raised by Mitt Romney, and
then adopted in adulthood by
Barack Obama" is set to be
come the law of the land.
That is largely a positive devel
opment: for the tens of millions of
previously uninsured Americans
who will now have access to a
physician, for health insurance
companies granted millions of
new customers and for an Ameri
ca whose care outcomes have per
sistently ranked last among devel
oped-world nations.
But more can be done. To curb
skyrocketing costs already
twice as high as those in other de
veloped countries policymak
ers should remove damaging re
strictions on incentivizing healthy
behavior by health care con
sumers and allow insurance com
panies to price-discriminate based
on lifestyle choices.
Health insurance is in this re
gard a uniquely restricted market.
Car insurance companies, for in
stance, are allowed (as they should
be) to charge unsafe drivers more
for car insurance. You cause a
crash, your premiums go up. Life
insurance companies, meanwhile,
are allowed to charge people who
smoke and older, unhealthier cus
tomers more for end-of-life insur
ance policies.
This all makes intuitive sense.
There is no reason why people
who drive safely or don't smoke
should be forced to subsidize the
poor choices of other people by
paying equal prices for these kinds
of insurance. And they're not.
Health insurance, however, is
different. As Jon Stewart noted in
a segment last November, nation

al lawmakers struck down Penn
sylvania Rep. Kathleen Dahlkem
per's HR 3472, which would have
"given people a financial incentive
to make health improvements" by
"allowing health insurance com
panies to raise or lower premiums
based on blood pressure, smoking
status, cholesterol levels, body
weight, or blood glucose control."
Many health insurance compa
nies have proposed offering lower
prices to people who join gyms,
lose weight, join a running club or
meet a certain set of medically de
termined health standards all
activities that have been shown to
improve health, lower the inci
dence of chronic disease and re
duce the need for expensive after
the-fact care (the carrot). Others
have proposed charging smokers,
overeaters and the sedentary
more, both to cover company costs
and to provide negative incentives
to improve personal health (the
stick).

Under current law, however,
many of these options are off the
table. That should change, on both
grounds of efficiency and grounds
of fairness.

First, a market in which insur
ance companies are allowed to
price-discriminate would reduce
health care costs by incentivizing
behaviors proven to reduce the in
cidence of disease, much as road
safety is improved by incentivizing
drivers not to crash. (Our current
health care market is more akin to
a world in which everyone pays the
same flat rate to fix everyone else's
cars when they crash, regardless of
our own driving quality a world
that would be neither efficient nor
fair.) In an America far unhealthi
er and more obese than most Eu
ropean countries, and an America
that spends outlandishly on health
care while achieving discouraging
ly poor outcomes, such cost-cut
ting would go a long way.

Second, regardless of overall
market efficiency, it is unjust to
force consumers who consciously
take care of themselves to subsi
dize the poor health choices of
other consumers by paying the
same rate for far less expected
care. Genetic or congenital prob
lems, of course, are a different
matter and should be covered by
the state (or by private insurance
operating under a mandate from
the state).
All of these changes should
also be coupled with healthy eat
ing programs and food vouchers
for kids who have limited access to
high-quality meals, a reduction in
cuts to physical education pro
grams in schools and incentives for
employers to offer employees ex
ercise options before, during or
after work. Not everyone current
ly has the same opportunity to stay
healthy, and we should strive to
create a level playing field for all.
James Madison famously ob
served in "Federalist No. 51" that
"if men were angels, no govern
ment would be necessary" —in
other words, that no higher power
is required to govern the decisions
of perfect men. Quite nearly the
same could be said of health care:
perfectly healthy citizens need no
doctors.
No extension of coverage al
though it is a huge step in the right
direction can be fiscally sustain
able in a society that is permanent
ly sick, overweight and sedentary.
What we need now is a system that
incentivizes preventative, healthy
choices a system that encour
ages us to become the gym-class
versions of James Madison's an
gels.

are allowed to charge people who
smoke and older, unhealthier cus
tomers more for end-of-life insur
ance policies.
This all makes intuitive sense.
There is no reason why people
who drive safely or don't smoke
should be forced to subsidize the
poor choices of other people by
paying equal prices for these kinds
of insurance. And they're not.
Health insurance, however, is
different. As Jon Stewart noted in
a segment last November, nation

al lawmakers struck down Penn
sylvania Rep. Kathleen Dahlkem
per's HR 3472, which would have
"given people a financial incentive
to make health improvements" by
"allowing health insurance com
panies to raise or lower premiums
based on blood pressure, smoking
status, cholesterol levels, body
weight, or blood glucose control."
Many health insurance compa
nies have proposed offering lower
prices to people who join gyms,
lose weight, join a running club or
meet a certain set of medically de
termined health standards all
activities that have been shown to
improve health, lower the inci
dence of chronic disease and re
duce the need for expensive after
the-fact care (the carrot). Others
have proposed charging smokers,
overeaters and the sedentary
more, both to cover company costs
and to provide negative incentives
to improve personal health (the
stick).

Under current law, however,
many of these options are off the
table. That should change, on both
grounds of efficiency and grounds
of fairness.

First, a market in which insur
ance companies are allowed to
price-discriminate would reduce
health care costs by incentivizing
behaviors proven to reduce the in
cidence of disease, much as road
safety is improved by incentivizing
drivers not to crash. (Our current
health care market is more akin to
a world in which everyone pays the
same flat rate to fix everyone else's
cars when they crash, regardless of
our own driving quality a world
that would be neither efficient nor
fair.) In an America far unhealthi
er and more obese than most Eu
ropean countries, and an America
that spends outlandishly on health
care while achieving discouraging
ly poor outcomes, such cost-cut
ting would go a long way.

Second, regardless of overall
market efficiency, it is unjust to
force consumers who consciously
take care of themselves to subsi
dize the poor health choices of
other consumers by paying the
same rate for far less expected
care. Genetic or congenital prob
lems, of course, are a different
matter and should be covered by
the state (or by private insurance
operating under a mandate from
the state).
All of these changes should
also be coupled with healthy eat
ing programs and food vouchers
for kids who have limited access to
high-quality meals, a reduction in
cuts to physical education pro
grams in schools and incentives for
employers to offer employees ex
ercise options before, during or
after work. Not everyone current
ly has the same opportunity to stay
healthy, and we should strive to
create a level playing field for all.
James Madison famously ob
served in "Federalist No. 51" that
"if men were angels, no govern
ment would be necessary" —in
other words, that no higher power
is required to govern the decisions
of perfect men. Quite nearly the
same could be said of health care:
perfectly healthy citizens need no
doctors.
No extension of coverage al
though it is a huge step in the right
direction can be fiscally sustain
able in a society that is permanent
ly sick, overweight and sedentary.
What we need now is a system that
incentivizes preventative, healthy
choices a system that encour
ages us to become the gym-class
versions of James Madison's an
gels.

"V Tith the vast majority of the
\A/ Affordable Care Act up-
Y Y held by the Supreme
Court, Obamacare or what
Paul Begala justly called "a policy
conceived by the Heritage Foun
dation, midwifed by Newt Gin
grich, raised by Mitt Romney, and
then adopted in adulthood by
Barack Obama" is set to be
come the law of the land.
That is largely a positive devel
opment: for the tens of millions of
previously uninsured Americans
who will now have access to a
physician, for health insurance
companies granted millions of
new customers and for an Ameri
ca whose care outcomes have per
sistently ranked last among devel
oped-world nations.
But more can be done. To curb
skyrocketing costs already
twice as high as those in other de
veloped countries policymak
ers should remove damaging re
strictions on incentivizing healthy
behavior by health care con
sumers and allow insurance com
panies to price-discriminate based
on lifestyle choices.
Health insurance is in this re
gard a uniquely restricted market.
Car insurance companies, for in
stance, are allowed (as they should
be) to charge unsafe drivers more
for car insurance. You cause a
crash, your premiums go up. Life
insurance companies, meanwhile,
are allowed to charge people who
smoke and older, unhealthier cus
tomers more for end-of-life insur
ance policies.
This all makes intuitive sense.
