						LEGEND CONTINUES Serena Williams defends her Bank of the West Classic singles title while Gibbs and Burdette impress on their home court 
### KAREN FENG DAILY INTERN 
The Bank of the West Classic, the old
est women's-only tournament in the
world, kicked off the U.S. Open Series
last week from July 9 to 15 on the Taube
Family Tennis Stadium outdoor hard
courts. In addition to featuring tennis
legends such as defending champion re
cent Wimbledon winner No. 4 Serena
Williams and France's No. 10 Marion
Bartoli, the Classic gave wild-card berths
to Stanford players Nicole Gibbs and
Mallory Burdette.
Last Tuesday, the two teammates
won their first-round matches. Gibbs de
feated Thailand's No. 162 Noppawan
Lertcheewakarn in straight sets 6-4, 6-4,
while Burdette defeated Britain's No. 77
Anne Keothavong 2-6,7-5,6-4.
Both Cardinal players were defeated
in the second-round singles and doubles
matches. On July 11, Williams overpow
ered Gibbs 6-2, 6-1 in the singles day
match, while Burdette failed to take a
couple of set points against Bartoli on
July 12 despite an early lead of 5-2 and
40-15 in the eighth game of the first set.
Bartoli eventually beat the Cardinal se
nior 7-5, 6-0, and the Stanford pair was
also defeated during that evening's dou
bles match by third-seeded Natalie
Grandin and Vladimira Uhlirova 7-6(5),
3-6,10-6.

During the July 14 semifinal singles
day matches, No. 120 Coco Vandeweghe
played in her first ever WTA semifinal
after defeating No. 29 Jelena Jankovic, a
former world No. 1, in the second round.
Vandeweghe had originally failed to
qualify for the tournament but entered
the main draw when Bojana Jovanovski
withdrew with an injury, making Van
deweghe a so-called "lucky loser."

A strong start to the Vandeweghe in
the semifinal gave her the advantage as
she took the first set against fifth-seeded
Belgian Yanina Wickmayer, the world
No. 31,6-2. Despite losing the second set
3-6, Vandeweghe gained momentum
with powerful serves and consistent
groundstrokes, while a frustrated Wick
mayer drew a warning for swearing, giv
ing away the last set 2-6 with a double
fault at set point. Vandeweghe walked
away from the match which lasted
over two hours with a total of 12 aces
and a serve over 120 mph.
With her win, Vandeweghe became
the first lucky loser ever to advance to the
final at the Bank of the West Classic.

During the evening match, first-seed
ed Williams decisively defeated ninth
seeded Romanian Sorana Cirstea 6-1,6-2
in e 60 minutes, despite making just 37
percent of her first serves. Williams strug
gled early against Cirstea's powerful
serves but was also more successful with
ball control, facing only one break point
as Cirstea committed 32 unforced errors.

In the doubles day match, the No. 9
team of Australian Jarmila Gajdosova
and American Vania King defeated sis
ters Yung-Jan Chan and Hao-Ching
Chan from Taipei in straight sets, 6-3,6-3.
During the evening match, third seeds
Natalie Grandin of South Africa and
Vladimira Uhlirova of the Czech Repub
lic struggled in a close match against first
time partners Marina Erakovic of New
Zealand and Heather Watson of Britain.
Erakovic and Watson took just over two
hours to win 7-5, 6-7(6), 10-7, with Wat
son advancing to her first ever WTA final.
Watson and Erakovic went on to play
King and Gajdosova at 5 p.m. on July 15.
Watson and Erakovic broke three times
