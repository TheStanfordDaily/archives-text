# THE 						OLYMPIC STATE

### Tom Taylor 
Though it is incredibly close, Stanford Uni
versity is not quite at the absolute top of
the list academically. However, it is host
to unquestionably the best college sports pro
gram in the country.

Dissenting voices will point to the fact that
Stanford is not the reigning football national
champion, but perhaps they don't realize that
there are other sports played at the college level.
The Cardinal's strength is in breadth; it is home
to one of the largest and most equally funded
athletics programs in the nation.
This fact is evident in the 18 straight Directors'
Cups it has won and even in the creation of the
Capital One Cup a couple years ago. The latter
prize notably rewards success more highly in a
handful of more popular sports, something that
clearly benefits those schools that concentrate
solely on the most lucrative disciplines and hurts
those with a broader outlook. These adjustments
perhaps serve to break the Cardinal's strangle
hold. Even with this handicap, though, Stanford
has won both Capital One Cup women's trophies
so far awarded.

But is the best in the United States the best in
the world?

It is difficult to make fair comparisons with
many overseas universities because the very
concept of semi-professional varsity athletics
doesn't really exist in most countries. In the
U.K., for example, there is maybe only one case
that comes close to the professionalism, impor
tance and funding of U.S. college sports: the Ox
ford vs. Cambridge boat race. In major sports,
talented athletes will go professional far before
they reach college age, and without the guaran
teed income source from these popular sports,
there is no money for athletics programs.
Surprisingly, the better comparison comes
not with universities in other countries, but with
the very countries themselves. When the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games kick off in a couple of
weeks, the U.S. and China are pretty much guar
anteed to be squaring off against each other for
the honor of top dog. Even wildly optimistic and
patriotic citizens of the host nation realize this;
coming in third overall is the goal for everyone
else.

But if the Farm declared independence from
the Union tomorrow and I hope you forgive
my extreme artistic license here where would
it stand? Could it come in third?

First, some simple demographics: Last year
about 1,700 were born into Cardinal country as
undergraduates, and 2,500 deserted their alma
mater to become naturalized graduate Stanford
citizens. Assuming a similar life expectancy for
the average American, we can claim that the
rough population of the Farm and
its diaspora is around 230,000.
In comparison, the total num
ber of Berkeley students and alum
ni works out to about 420,000, and
the population of San Francisco is
800,000. Stanford wouldn't,
though, be the smallest nation rec
ognized by the International
Olympic Committee; that honor
would fall to either Tuvalu or
Nauru, each home to about 10,000
people.
If Stanford had competed inde
pendently at Beijing 2008, it would
have finished an impressive ninth
in the medal count, just behind
Japan and just ahead of Italy. Cal
would have come in 17th.

Even more revealing, though, is
a measure of the number of people
per medal. By this statistic, the Ba
hamas would have earned the top
ranking (as the least athletic) after
the Games in China, with 300,000
people per medal. Stanford: a stag
gering 9,400. Berkeley: an almost

as-impressive 25,000.
However, the Bay Area doesn't
have a monopoly on Olympic suc
cess. Stanford's total of 115 golds is
beaten by USC's 123, and the Tro
jans would have come two places
higher than the Cardinal in the
medal table at Beijing in 2008. In
fact, USC has the best Olympic
record of any U.S., and likely
world, university. With a signifi
cantly larger student body, though,
it has a larger number of people per
medal, around 33,000.
Without even having men
tioned UCLA (110 golds) or any of
the other eight Pac-12 schools, it is
clear how much of an Olympic
breeding ground both California
and the Pac-12 conference are.
Though often underrated in the big
sports throughout the academic
year, the West Coast is an athletic
powerhouse that dominates Amer
ican Olympic success.
From a U.S. perspective, it is cer
tainly a good thing that the Golden
State isn't independent.

Tom Taylor sounds like he might
be starting to support USC. Make
sure he doesn't join the dark side at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.

have finished an impressive ninth
in the medal count, just behind
Japan and just ahead of Italy. Cal
would have come in 17th.

Even more revealing, though, is
a measure of the number of people
per medal. By this statistic, the Ba
hamas would have earned the top
ranking (as the least athletic) after
the Games in China, with 300,000
people per medal. Stanford: a stag
gering 9,400. Berkeley: an almost

as-impressive 25,000.
However, the Bay Area doesn't
have a monopoly on Olympic suc
cess. Stanford's total of 115 golds is
beaten by USC's 123, and the Tro
jans would have come two places
higher than the Cardinal in the
medal table at Beijing in 2008. In
fact, USC has the best Olympic
record of any U.S., and likely
world, university. With a signifi
cantly larger student body, though,
it has a larger number of people per
medal, around 33,000.
Without even having men
tioned UCLA (110 golds) or any of
the other eight Pac-12 schools, it is
clear how much of an Olympic
breeding ground both California
and the Pac-12 conference are.
Though often underrated in the big
sports throughout the academic
year, the West Coast is an athletic
powerhouse that dominates Amer
ican Olympic success.
From a U.S. perspective, it is cer
tainly a good thing that the Golden
State isn't independent.

Though it is incredibly close, Stanford Uni
versity is not quite at the absolute top of
the list academically. However, it is host
to unquestionably the best college sports pro
gram in the country.

Dissenting voices will point to the fact that
Stanford is not the reigning football national
champion, but perhaps they don't realize that
there are other sports played at the college level.
The Cardinal's strength is in breadth; it is home
to one of the largest and most equally funded
athletics programs in the nation.
This fact is evident in the 18 straight Directors'
Cups it has won and even in the creation of the
Capital One Cup a couple years ago. The latter
prize notably rewards success more highly in a
handful of more popular sports, something that
clearly benefits those schools that concentrate
solely on the most lucrative disciplines and hurts
those with a broader outlook. These adjustments
perhaps serve to break the Cardinal's strangle
hold. Even with this handicap, though, Stanford
has won both Capital One Cup women's trophies
so far awarded.

But is the best in the United States the best in
the world?

It is difficult to make fair comparisons with
many overseas universities because the very
concept of semi-professional varsity athletics
doesn't really exist in most countries. In the
U.K., for example, there is maybe only one case
that comes close to the professionalism, impor
tance and funding of U.S. college sports: the Ox
ford vs. Cambridge boat race. In major sports,
talented athletes will go professional far before
they reach college age, and without the guaran
teed income source from these popular sports,
there is no money for athletics programs.
Surprisingly, the better comparison comes
not with universities in other countries, but with
the very countries themselves. When the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games kick off in a couple of
weeks, the U.S. and China are pretty much guar
anteed to be squaring off against each other for
the honor of top dog. Even wildly optimistic and
patriotic citizens of the host nation realize this;
coming in third overall is the goal for everyone
else.

But if the Farm declared independence from
the Union tomorrow and I hope you forgive
my extreme artistic license here where would
it stand? Could it come in third?

First, some simple demographics: Last year
about 1,700 were born into Cardinal country as
undergraduates, and 2,500 deserted their alma
mater to become naturalized graduate Stanford
citizens. Assuming a similar life expectancy for
the average American, we can claim that the
rough population of the Farm and
its diaspora is around 230,000.
In comparison, the total num
ber of Berkeley students and alum
ni works out to about 420,000, and
the population of San Francisco is
800,000. Stanford wouldn't,
though, be the smallest nation rec
ognized by the International
Olympic Committee; that honor
would fall to either Tuvalu or
Nauru, each home to about 10,000
people.
If Stanford had competed inde
pendently at Beijing 2008, it would
have finished an impressive ninth
in the medal count, just behind
Japan and just ahead of Italy. Cal
would have come in 17th.
