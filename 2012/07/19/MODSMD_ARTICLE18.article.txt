Though it is incredibly close, Stanford Uni
versity is not quite at the absolute top of
the list academically. However, it is host
to unquestionably the best college sports pro
gram in the country.

Dissenting voices will point to the fact that
Stanford is not the reigning football national
champion, but perhaps they don't realize that
there are other sports played at the college level.
The Cardinal's strength is in breadth; it is home
to one of the largest and most equally funded
athletics programs in the nation.
This fact is evident in the 18 straight Directors'
Cups it has won and even in the creation of the
Capital One Cup a couple years ago. The latter
prize notably rewards success more highly in a
handful of more popular sports, something that
clearly benefits those schools that concentrate
solely on the most lucrative disciplines and hurts
those with a broader outlook. These adjustments
perhaps serve to break the Cardinal's strangle
hold. Even with this handicap, though, Stanford
has won both Capital One Cup women's trophies
so far awarded.

But is the best in the United States the best in
the world?

It is difficult to make fair comparisons with
many overseas universities because the very
concept of semi-professional varsity athletics
doesn't really exist in most countries. In the
U.K., for example, there is maybe only one case
that comes close to the professionalism, impor
tance and funding of U.S. college sports: the Ox
ford vs. Cambridge boat race. In major sports,
talented athletes will go professional far before
they reach college age, and without the guaran
teed income source from these popular sports,
there is no money for athletics programs.
Surprisingly, the better comparison comes
not with universities in other countries, but with
the very countries themselves. When the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games kick off in a couple of
weeks, the U.S. and China are pretty much guar
anteed to be squaring off against each other for
the honor of top dog. Even wildly optimistic and
patriotic citizens of the host nation realize this;
coming in third overall is the goal for everyone
else.

But if the Farm declared independence from
the Union tomorrow and I hope you forgive
my extreme artistic license here where would
it stand? Could it come in third?

First, some simple demographics: Last year
about 1,700 were born into Cardinal country as
undergraduates, and 2,500 deserted their alma
mater to become naturalized graduate Stanford
citizens. Assuming a similar life expectancy for
the average American, we can claim that the
