## ACADEMICS Shoven seeks solutions with econ SIEPR director applies economics to global issues 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
The word "economics" can bring to
mind different images. Wall Street.
Men and women in grey suits. Views of
towering skyscrapers, stock prices and
fluctuating lines of the Dow and NAS
DAQ coasting up and down large
monitors.

But those images intense and
colorless on their own fail to fully
paint economics or, for that matter,
John Shoven: a man whose passion for
economics has stretched across an il
lustrious 39-year career at Stanford
University.

The Charles R. Schwab Professor
of Economics and Wallace R. Elawley
Director of the Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research (SIEPR),
Shoven has dedicated much of his life
to economics. Even much of his office
space is dedicated to pictures of and
gifts from previous classes and advis
ers.

"Economics is about efficiently
using the resources that you have,"
Shoven said, "as a country or, for that
matter, as a globe."
According to Shoven, economics
can help solve many of the problems
facing the next generation. For in
stance, Shoven is currently working on
a research project that provides a
model by which individuals can maxi
mize both their private savings and So
cial Security after retirement.
According to Shoven, most people
immediately apply for Social Security
when they're eligible, which he calls
"leaving money on the table." Instead,
Shoven suggests that people use pri
vate savings to put off, rather than sup
plement, their Social Security.
"Say they retire at 62," he said.
"Maybe they should start their Social
Security at 68 and use those first six
years and live off their pension, sav
ings and assets. And the reason they
should defer Social Security and
some people should defer it to 70 is
that the government gives you larger
monthly benefits if you start later than
if you start early, and the difference
between starting late and starting early

is actually quite significant."
Another problem Shoven believes
can be solved through economics is de
ciding when to retire given the increas
ing life expectancy in America. In his
opinion, people will soon have to work
until at least age 70 in order to be able
to support themselves after their re
tirement. He highlights this as a factor
that contributes to the poor U.S. econ
omy, since the government can't af
ford to support the mass of retiring
baby boomers living well into old age.
"What is at the heart of it, or at least
a big part of it, is the retirement bene
fits that [the government] just can't af
ford," Shoven said. "The good news is
we're living a lot longer. The bad news
is we have not adjusted our finances
and our retirement [policies] for that
fact."

In addition to Social Security and
retirement, issues such as global
warming and health care costs are also
what Shoven calls "economic prob
lems," and he argues they can be
solved using economic incentives.
