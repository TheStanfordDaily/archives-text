## ACADEMICS Shoven seeks solutions with econ SIEPR director applies economics to global issues 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
The word "economics" can bring to
mind different images. Wall Street.
Men and women in grey suits. Views of
towering skyscrapers, stock prices and
fluctuating lines of the Dow and NAS
DAQ coasting up and down large
monitors.

But those images intense and
colorless on their own fail to fully
paint economics or, for that matter,
John Shoven: a man whose passion for
economics has stretched across an il
lustrious 39-year career at Stanford
University.

The Charles R. Schwab Professor
of Economics and Wallace R. Elawley
Director of the Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research (SIEPR),
Shoven has dedicated much of his life
to economics. Even much of his office
space is dedicated to pictures of and
gifts from previous classes and advis
ers.

"Economics is about efficiently
using the resources that you have,"
Shoven said, "as a country or, for that
matter, as a globe."
According to Shoven, economics
can help solve many of the problems
facing the next generation. For in
stance, Shoven is currently working on
a research project that provides a
model by which individuals can maxi
mize both their private savings and So
cial Security after retirement.
According to Shoven, most people
immediately apply for Social Security
when they're eligible, which he calls
"leaving money on the table." Instead,
Shoven suggests that people use pri
vate savings to put off, rather than sup
plement, their Social Security.
"Say they retire at 62," he said.
"Maybe they should start their Social
Security at 68 and use those first six
years and live off their pension, sav
ings and assets. And the reason they
should defer Social Security and
some people should defer it to 70 is
that the government gives you larger
monthly benefits if you start later than
if you start early, and the difference
between starting late and starting early

is actually quite significant."
Another problem Shoven believes
can be solved through economics is de
ciding when to retire given the increas
ing life expectancy in America. In his
opinion, people will soon have to work
until at least age 70 in order to be able
to support themselves after their re
tirement. He highlights this as a factor
that contributes to the poor U.S. econ
omy, since the government can't af
ford to support the mass of retiring
baby boomers living well into old age.
"What is at the heart of it, or at least
a big part of it, is the retirement bene
fits that [the government] just can't af
ford," Shoven said. "The good news is
we're living a lot longer. The bad news
is we have not adjusted our finances
and our retirement [policies] for that
fact."

In addition to Social Security and
retirement, issues such as global
warming and health care costs are also
what Shoven calls "economic prob
lems," and he argues they can be
solved using economic incentives.

has held many administrative
roles, such as chairman of the De
partment of Economics from
1986 to 1989, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences and
director of SIEPR, a position he
currently holds.
Yet despite his dedication to
economics, Shoven majored in
physics with a minor in economics
at UC-San Diego. He attributes
his decision to major in physics to
Sputnik, a satellite launched in
1957 by the Soviet Union.

At that time "there was this
tremendous emphasis on science
and engineering, and I thought,
'Well, science is cool so I'll do sci
ence,"' he said.
At UCSD, Shoven worked in a
lab that focused on satellite
based experiments for almost
three years. However, weighty,
long science projects and a desire
to help the faltering 70s economy
pushed Shoven toward econom
ics and consequently toward a
graduate degree in economics be
fore accepting a job at Stanford.
His involvement in economics,
however, extends beyond Stan
ford to include work with compa
nies in the Silicon Valley and the
National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER). NBER, a
non-profit research group, allows
Shoven to interact with other
economists who study similar
topics.

"It's just away for me to con
nect with a large group of scholars
that are doing similar work, and I
find it very valuable," Shoven
said of NBER.

Shoven also organizes and lec
tures at a workshop for high
school economics teachers every
summer in the Bay Area.
Despite having many respon
sibilities, Shoven never regrets
accepting them. He voluntarily
chooses his workload, even
teaching more classes than neces
sary.

And it is with his teaching that
he has impacted his students.

Former student Susan
Meaney'B2 remembers Shoven as
a mentor who really strove to
share his passion for economics
with his students.

"He had away of making you

understand how [economics] was
important and how it applied to
your life," Meaney said.
John Pencavel, an economics
professor and a colleague of
Shoven's for 39 years, also gave
high praise for Shoven's teaching
and research.
"He is distinctive in that al
most anything he does, he does
very well," Pencavel said.
Despite his lifelong passion for
economics, Shoven participates
in a multitude of other activities.
For one, he is an avid Stanford
sports fan and wears a step
counter that regularly flashes
"Beat Cal."

"I think Stanford is really
unique in combining top athletics
and top academics," Shoven said.
"There's nowhere else that does
it as well as we do it."

Shoven also loves traveling,
which he considers lucky since his
job requires traveling to confer
ences from New York to Iceland.

And he doesn't plan on retir
ing anytime soon. Shoven jokes
that he will "lead by example"
those he believes will have to
work longer to sustain themselves
after retirement.

After all, Shoven says there is
still much to do.
"We should be humble as
economists," Shoven said.
"We've got millions of people
who want jobs in the United
States who can't get jobs. There is
a lot of important work to be
done so that we can manage this
economy better."

summer in the Bay Area.
Despite having many respon
sibilities, Shoven never regrets
accepting them. He voluntarily
chooses his workload, even
teaching more classes than neces
sary.

And it is with his teaching that
he has impacted his students.

Former student Susan
Meaney'B2 remembers Shoven as
a mentor who really strove to
share his passion for economics
with his students.

"He had away of making you

understand how [economics] was
important and how it applied to
your life," Meaney said.
John Pencavel, an economics
professor and a colleague of
Shoven's for 39 years, also gave
high praise for Shoven's teaching
and research.
"He is distinctive in that al
most anything he does, he does
very well," Pencavel said.
Despite his lifelong passion for
economics, Shoven participates
in a multitude of other activities.
For one, he is an avid Stanford
sports fan and wears a step
counter that regularly flashes
"Beat Cal."

"I think Stanford is really
unique in combining top athletics
and top academics," Shoven said.
"There's nowhere else that does
it as well as we do it."

Shoven also loves traveling,
which he considers lucky since his
job requires traveling to confer
ences from New York to Iceland.

And he doesn't plan on retir
ing anytime soon. Shoven jokes
that he will "lead by example"
those he believes will have to
work longer to sustain themselves
after retirement.

After all, Shoven says there is
still much to do.
"We should be humble as
economists," Shoven said.
"We've got millions of people
who want jobs in the United
States who can't get jobs. There is
a lot of important work to be
done so that we can manage this
economy better."

The word "economics" can bring to
mind different images. Wall Street.
Men and women in grey suits. Views of
towering skyscrapers, stock prices and
fluctuating lines of the Dow and NAS
DAQ coasting up and down large
monitors.

But those images intense and
colorless on their own fail to fully
paint economics or, for that matter,
John Shoven: a man whose passion for
economics has stretched across an il
lustrious 39-year career at Stanford
University.

The Charles R. Schwab Professor
of Economics and Wallace R. Elawley
Director of the Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research (SIEPR),
Shoven has dedicated much of his life
to economics. Even much of his office
space is dedicated to pictures of and
gifts from previous classes and advis
ers.

"Economics is about efficiently
using the resources that you have,"
Shoven said, "as a country or, for that
matter, as a globe."
According to Shoven, economics
can help solve many of the problems
facing the next generation. For in
stance, Shoven is currently working on
a research project that provides a
model by which individuals can maxi
mize both their private savings and So
cial Security after retirement.
According to Shoven, most people
immediately apply for Social Security
when they're eligible, which he calls
"leaving money on the table." Instead,
Shoven suggests that people use pri
vate savings to put off, rather than sup
plement, their Social Security.
"Say they retire at 62," he said.
"Maybe they should start their Social
Security at 68 and use those first six
years and live off their pension, sav
ings and assets. And the reason they
should defer Social Security and
some people should defer it to 70 is
that the government gives you larger
monthly benefits if you start later than
if you start early, and the difference
between starting late and starting early

is actually quite significant."
Another problem Shoven believes
can be solved through economics is de
ciding when to retire given the increas
ing life expectancy in America. In his
opinion, people will soon have to work
until at least age 70 in order to be able
to support themselves after their re
tirement. He highlights this as a factor
that contributes to the poor U.S. econ
omy, since the government can't af
ford to support the mass of retiring
baby boomers living well into old age.
"What is at the heart of it, or at least
a big part of it, is the retirement bene
fits that [the government] just can't af
ford," Shoven said. "The good news is
we're living a lot longer. The bad news
is we have not adjusted our finances
and our retirement [policies] for that
fact."

In addition to Social Security and
retirement, issues such as global
warming and health care costs are also
what Shoven calls "economic prob
lems," and he argues they can be
solved using economic incentives.

has held many administrative
roles, such as chairman of the De
partment of Economics from
1986 to 1989, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences and
director of SIEPR, a position he
currently holds.
Yet despite his dedication to
economics, Shoven majored in
physics with a minor in economics
at UC-San Diego. He attributes
his decision to major in physics to
Sputnik, a satellite launched in
1957 by the Soviet Union.

At that time "there was this
tremendous emphasis on science
and engineering, and I thought,
'Well, science is cool so I'll do sci
ence,"' he said.
At UCSD, Shoven worked in a
lab that focused on satellite
based experiments for almost
three years. However, weighty,
long science projects and a desire
to help the faltering 70s economy
pushed Shoven toward econom
ics and consequently toward a
graduate degree in economics be
fore accepting a job at Stanford.
His involvement in economics,
however, extends beyond Stan
ford to include work with compa
nies in the Silicon Valley and the
National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER). NBER, a
non-profit research group, allows
Shoven to interact with other
economists who study similar
topics.

"It's just away for me to con
nect with a large group of scholars
that are doing similar work, and I
find it very valuable," Shoven
said of NBER.

Shoven also organizes and lec
tures at a workshop for high
school economics teachers every
summer in the Bay Area.
