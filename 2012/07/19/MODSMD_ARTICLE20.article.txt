### David Eng 
UT A T hat's your favorite
\/\ / sports team?" re-
V V cent high school
graduate nearing many first ex
changes this autumn, I figured I
should at least somewhat flesh out
a response to this common inquiry
after all, knowing someone's
name, major and hometown can
only sustain a conversation for so
long.

So I thought about it. Giants?
Too standard. Niners? Too band
wagon. Sharks? Too obscure.
Sabercats? Well let's be honest, no
body actually watches arena foot
ball for the football.
"The Warriors."

This response figures to elicit a
certain measure of sympathy from
my new acquaintance. Expected
responses include "Oh," coupled
with the "sorry I asked" face or an
immediate topic switch (note to
self: need a backup plan in case the
individual comes from Charlotte).
Despite this superficial benefit,
I would much prefer an end to the
mediocrity and I'm sure any
sports enthusiast can relate.
Haven't we all, on some level,
stayed devoted to a franchise
which has qualified for the playoffs
once in our lifetimes? And isn't
every general management office
susceptible to a few draft busts now
and then? Cough. Joe Barry Car
roll. Cough. Joe Smith. Cough.
Patrick O'Bryant. Cough. Ike
Diogu. Cough. OK, I'll stop before
I hack up a lung.
In light of the woes of my "fa
vorite sports team," I set out to de
mystify the formula for NBA suc
cess ...

You didn't have to be a "round
mound" reading a teleprompter to
have seen the script of the most re
cent finals one roster construct
ed from big-name free-agent ac
quisitions pitted against another
built, by and large, from draft picks
and beards. So I suppose that
leaves one of two options for the
Warriors.

Option 1: hoard free agent su
perstars. This worked for an injury-
ridden Miami team that compiled
a worse record (15-67) in 2007-08
than Golden State has experienced
in its four decades west of South
Beach.

I see this working out. After all,
why wouldn't the league's top free
agents want to join the Warriors?
You have the fortune of playing in
one of the least volatile cities in
America. And just think if
Dwight Howard joined the War
riors, it would be the first (and
probably only) time he wouldn't
have the ugliest free throw shot on
his team!

Option 2: draft developing su
perstars. This worked for an Okla
homa City franchise that erupted
from four consecutive years of sub
.soo mediocrity (a consistency
which hardly rivals Golden State's)
to rapidly ascend into contention.
It only made a few haters in the
process.

Three consecutive years of top
four lottery picks and voilal Right?

Well, perhaps.
The problem? The Warriors
have not had a top-four lottery
pick since selecting Mike Dun
leavy third (over No. 8 Amare
Stoudemire) in a particularly weak
2003 draft class. Perennially on the
cusp of mediocrity in other
words, bad but not bad enough
Golden State should know by now
that mid-lottery picks won't propel
them into contention. I secretly
hope Golden State acquired An
drew Bogut last season to solidify
an early lottery pick and not, as it
claims, to "contend."
But in all honesty, there's a bet
ter chance that Andris Biedrins
shoots over 90 percent from the
charity stripe than either of these
options occurring.

Perhaps a final, broader insight
regarding a commonality among
nearly all NBA champions will be
of greater value: Every champi
onship contender has a superstar
and usually not its point guard.
Leßron's Heat. Nowitzki's Mavs.
Kobe's Lakers. The only exception
to this rule in the past couple of
decades seems to be the 2004 De
troit Pistons. And even more in
triguing is that no champion's su

perstar has been its point guard
since Magic Johnson's Lakers in
1988 (sorry. Clips, Bulls and Nets).
To put this in perspective, there
hasn't even been a point-guard-led
team to reach the NBA Finals since
Jason Kidd's Nets in 2002-03.
The Warriors have a difficult
task before them. It won't be
David Lee. It won't be Andrew
Bogut. It won't be Andris Biedrins.
It may be Stephen Curry, but it's
never a good idea to place stock in
an injury-prone guard especial
ly given the aforementioned histo
ry.

Of course, there's no sure-fire
formula to winning in the NBA;
there will always be the intangible
events that dictate the course of a
team's season. However, at least
for Warriors fans, the future gives
us hope.
So yes, I am losing patience. But
for now, I still believe.

David Eng might have to wait a life
time for the Warriors to win the
NBA Finals, but in the meantime
he'll soon have a new team to root
for as a freshman at Stanford. Wel
come him to the Farm at david_eng

team's season. However, at least
for Warriors fans, the future gives
us hope.
So yes, I am losing patience. But
for now, I still believe.

David Eng might have to wait a life
time for the Warriors to win the
NBA Finals, but in the meantime
he'll soon have a new team to root
for as a freshman at Stanford. Wel

UT A T hat's your favorite
\/\ / sports team?" re-
V V cent high school
graduate nearing many first ex
changes this autumn, I figured I
should at least somewhat flesh out
a response to this common inquiry
after all, knowing someone's
name, major and hometown can
only sustain a conversation for so
long.

So I thought about it. Giants?
Too standard. Niners? Too band
wagon. Sharks? Too obscure.
Sabercats? Well let's be honest, no
body actually watches arena foot
ball for the football.
"The Warriors."

This response figures to elicit a
certain measure of sympathy from
my new acquaintance. Expected
responses include "Oh," coupled
with the "sorry I asked" face or an
immediate topic switch (note to
self: need a backup plan in case the
individual comes from Charlotte).
Despite this superficial benefit,
I would much prefer an end to the
mediocrity and I'm sure any
sports enthusiast can relate.
Haven't we all, on some level,
stayed devoted to a franchise
which has qualified for the playoffs
once in our lifetimes? And isn't
every general management office
susceptible to a few draft busts now
and then? Cough. Joe Barry Car
roll. Cough. Joe Smith. Cough.
Patrick O'Bryant. Cough. Ike
Diogu. Cough. OK, I'll stop before
I hack up a lung.
In light of the woes of my "fa
vorite sports team," I set out to de
mystify the formula for NBA suc
cess ...

You didn't have to be a "round
mound" reading a teleprompter to
have seen the script of the most re
cent finals one roster construct
ed from big-name free-agent ac
quisitions pitted against another
built, by and large, from draft picks
and beards. So I suppose that
leaves one of two options for the
Warriors.

Option 1: hoard free agent su
perstars. This worked for an injury-
ridden Miami team that compiled
a worse record (15-67) in 2007-08
than Golden State has experienced
in its four decades west of South
Beach.

I see this working out. After all,
why wouldn't the league's top free
agents want to join the Warriors?
You have the fortune of playing in
one of the least volatile cities in
America. And just think if
Dwight Howard joined the War
riors, it would be the first (and
probably only) time he wouldn't
have the ugliest free throw shot on
his team!

Option 2: draft developing su
perstars. This worked for an Okla
homa City franchise that erupted
from four consecutive years of sub
.soo mediocrity (a consistency
which hardly rivals Golden State's)
to rapidly ascend into contention.
It only made a few haters in the
process.

Three consecutive years of top
four lottery picks and voilal Right?

Well, perhaps.
The problem? The Warriors
have not had a top-four lottery
pick since selecting Mike Dun
leavy third (over No. 8 Amare
Stoudemire) in a particularly weak
2003 draft class. Perennially on the
cusp of mediocrity in other
words, bad but not bad enough
Golden State should know by now
that mid-lottery picks won't propel
them into contention. I secretly
hope Golden State acquired An
drew Bogut last season to solidify
an early lottery pick and not, as it
claims, to "contend."
But in all honesty, there's a bet
ter chance that Andris Biedrins
shoots over 90 percent from the
charity stripe than either of these
options occurring.

Perhaps a final, broader insight
regarding a commonality among
nearly all NBA champions will be
of greater value: Every champi
onship contender has a superstar
and usually not its point guard.
Leßron's Heat. Nowitzki's Mavs.
Kobe's Lakers. The only exception
to this rule in the past couple of
decades seems to be the 2004 De
troit Pistons. And even more in
triguing is that no champion's su

perstar has been its point guard
since Magic Johnson's Lakers in
1988 (sorry. Clips, Bulls and Nets).
To put this in perspective, there
hasn't even been a point-guard-led
team to reach the NBA Finals since
Jason Kidd's Nets in 2002-03.
The Warriors have a difficult
task before them. It won't be
David Lee. It won't be Andrew
Bogut. It won't be Andris Biedrins.
It may be Stephen Curry, but it's
never a good idea to place stock in
an injury-prone guard especial
ly given the aforementioned histo
ry.

Of course, there's no sure-fire
formula to winning in the NBA;
there will always be the intangible
events that dictate the course of a
team's season. However, at least
for Warriors fans, the future gives
us hope.
So yes, I am losing patience. But
