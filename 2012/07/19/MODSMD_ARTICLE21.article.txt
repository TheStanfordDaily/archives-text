## Six Stanford baseball players sign pro contracts 
### 
Ace righthander Mark Appel
was the only member of Stanford
baseball's 2012 draft class to re
turn to school, as six former Car
dinal players inked deals and
began minor-league play in re
cent weeks.

Supplementary first-round
pick Stephen Piscotty, who signed
with the St. Louis Cardinals for
$1.4 million, has played in 19
games with their Class-A affiliate,
the Quad Cities River Bandits.
Piscotty has hit .292 as the River
Bandits' starting third baseman
and has played alongside former
Stanford teammate Colin Walsh,
who has missed time recently with
an injury.

After being chosen in the third
round, southpaw Brett Mooney
ham signed with the Washington
Nationals for $428,500. The lefty,
who passed up a seven-figure
offer from the Padres before de
ciding to come to Stanford, has
done well in his first two pro out
ings, going 4.2 shutout innings
and making his first professional

start.
Fourth-round selection Kenny
Diekroeger signed with Kansas
City for $500,000, also a bit of a
step down for the former second
round choice out of high school.
Fie has jumped out to five home
runs in just 15 games with the
Royals' rookie affiliate in
Burlington, N.C.
Jake Stewart has done just as
well with the Connecticut Tigers,
as the ninth-round pick has three
homers and six doubles in his 18
appearances.

Eighteenth-round pick Eric
Smith and 24th-round pick Tyler
Gaffney have also signed with the
Dodgers and Pirates, respectively.
