# Nonconference series with Big Ten called off
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The series of football games
between the Pac-12 and Big Ten
that was to begin in 2017 was sud
denly cancelled Friday after sev
eral Pac-12 schools raised sched
uling concerns.
The original plan called for a
multi-year round-robin between

the two conferences, but the Pac
12's nine-game conference sched
ule compared to the eight
played by its Rose Bowl counter
part made the arrangement
impractical. For some schools in
volved in long-term contracts
with other nonconference teams
Stanford and USC, for exam
ple, play Notre Dame every year
adding yet another required
contest to their yearly slate did
not provide enough flexibility.

An additional series with a
BCS conference would also have
made it harder for struggling
teams to qualify for postseason
play, as they would have one
fewer nonconference game
against a weak, non-BCS squad.
