# TURNING DOWN THE MILLIONS
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
uarterback U" is
I lonce again making
as "Com
ing-back U."
When Mark Appel pulled an
Andrew Luck on Friday, an
nouncing that he was returning
for his senior season and turning
down $3.8 million from the Pitts
burgh Pirates, he bought the Car
dinal at least a few games it just
couldn't have won with another
pitcher on the mound.
They say baseball's all about
winning the second game of a
three-game series, and now Stan

ford has two starters who can do
that consistently: Appel and ris
ing junior A.J. Vanegas. Last sea
son, a couple more series wins
would have meant the difference
between hosting a Super Region
al and traveling to Tallahassee.
Next year, they could be Stan
ford's lifeline for any sort of post
season berth.

Appel is that lifeline. He's that
good, that important to a Cardi
nal pitching staff that's seen bet
ter days. And his talents are stay
ing on the Farm for another year.
Even more encouraging to
Stanford than how much its base
ball team's stock suddenly shot up
for next year, its athletes' contin
ued dedication to the University
has got to make it most proud.
But it's a head-scratcher, al
beit a commendable one, that
Appel values the final $60,000 of
his Stanford education at nearly
$4 million. Ballplayers come back
in the offseason to finish off their
degrees all the time, and there's
no real urgency for him to gradu

ate before he begins his pro ca
reer.

Then again, Appel is a man
agement science and engineering
major, so who's to doubt him
when it comes to money?
And make no mistake; money
was a major player here. Had
Appel been the first overall pick
—as was expected —he would
have been offered over twice this
much and likely would be wearing
a minor-league uniform right
now. Luck didn't have the same
luxury of testing the draft waters,
since football and basketball play
ers can't renege on the pros once
they decide to enter the draft.
In an injury sense, Appel's de
cision is also much less risky than
the one made by Luck, who was
just one big hit away from never
making it to the NFL. Pitchers
suffer hand, elbow and shoulder
injuries all the time, but at a
young age they're not usually of
the career-ending variety.

When it comes to unfinished
business, at first, I'm not really

sure I buy the "coming back to
win a national championship" ar
gument here. Where Luck's se
nior season was another glittering
opportunity at a BCS bowl,
Appel's final year will be spent
without the core of a roster that
struggled in conference play and
looked asleep in two straight
Super Regionals.
Then again, anything can hap
pen in baseball, and if Appel had
pitched better against Florida
State, the Cardinal would have
been a win away from Omaha.
And therein lies Appel's moti
vation for returning. I'll be
darned if that seven-run fourth in
ning didn't leave a sour taste in his
mouth, and Appel's hoping an
other year on the Farm will be just
the breath mint to erase those
memories.

Chances are that Appel will
make enough of a name for him
self in the pros and nobody out
side Palo Alto will care in 10 years
what he did (or didn't do) at Stan
ford. But if he's working to im
prove his legacy here nonethe
less, that shows real dedication to
his fans, his teammates and, most
importantly, his school.
It's far too early to predict an
other 10-win season for the ace

again, he'll have a depleted
roster playing behind him but
our lasting image of Appel is not
going to be the sweating, ex
hausted righty getting shelled in
Tallahassee. He's going to im
press us yet again, and this time,
3.8 million George Washingtons
will be turning their heads as
well.

Joseph Beyda wouldn't leave The
Stanford Daily for $3.8 million.
Really, he wouldn't. But he's al
ways open to donations, so let him
know how much you can donate to
the Beyda Bank at jbeyda@stan
ford.edu.
