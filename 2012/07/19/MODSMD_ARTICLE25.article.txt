CC A merica is not the greatest country in the world
/\ anymore," proclaims news anchor Will McAvoy.
A. A. So begins "The Newsroom," the latest series from
writer Aaron Sorkin, who took a hiatus from his usual TV
series ("West Wing," "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip") to pen
films "The Social Network" and "Moneyball." Sorkin has a his
tory of creating behind-the-scenes looks at different institu
tions from the White House to late-night comedy TV
but this time he focuses on an unlikely target: the evening
news. "The Newsroom" features his standard "Sorkinese"
(characters talking in super-fast, facts-laced dialogue), but
adopts a preachy tone as Will McAvoy and crew lament the
demise of real news in favor of ratings-hungry, 24-hour cable
network stories.
The story begins in 2010, allowing Sorkin to reinterpret cover
age of recent major news stories, beginning with the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill and continuing with the rise of the Tea Party. The
argument is that recent news coverage, in an endless quest for rat
ings, has sacrificed quality for catchiness, and that this fictional
broadcast represents how good the news can really be. Even though
it can feel very sanctimonious, getting a fresh take on old stories is
fun, especially when the team tries to take down the Tea Party in
episode three.
Aside from the series' preachy, sometimes-shrill tone,
much has been made in the media of Sorkin's treatment of
women, especially in light of his "Hey, Internet girl" comment
that has become infamous, not to mention the way female
roles were marginalized in "The Social Network." And indeed,
the female character in "The Newsroom," notably Mackenzie
(Emily Mortimer) and Maggie (Alison Pill), are often prone to
hysterics and storylines focused more around their love lives
than their work, despite the fact that all the characters work in
the same newsroom.
But what is more frustrating than the general typecasting of
emotional, needy women is the so-far wasted potential in terms of
characterization. We are told numerous times of Mackenzie's brav
ery covering war stories in Iraq and Afghanistan, but instead of

showing the viewer any of that history, we're instead presented with
a woman who struggles to send an email and spends most of her
time fighting with Will over their past history together. Aside from
being offensive, it just makes for less interesting television.
Despite this, Sorkin as ever writes compelling char
acters. Jeff Daniels, as Will McAvoy, grounds the cast with a
surly presence that often leads to temper tantrums but is equal
ly prone to random acts of kindness and a newfound commit
ment to good journalism. Meanwhile, the incredible chemistry
between Maggie and producer Jim Harper (played by John
Gallagher Jr.) works to form the best will-they-or-won't-they

TV relationship since fim and Pam on "The Office."
If you're a fan of Sorkin, "The Newsroom" will satisfy
your craving for rapid-fire dialogue and characters standing
proudly on soapboxes. But even if you're not and you
can get past the hysterics and the sermons it makes for an
entertaining hour and a thought-provoking rewrite of recent
history.
