Woody Allen's latest film, "To
Rome With Love," doesn't
evoke as many laughs as last
year's "Midnight in Paris," but it's still an
entertaining, if fleeting, piece. As the title
suggests, the film takes place in Rome,
telling several unconnected stories of both
Italians and rich Americans in the capital.
The common theme across the stories is
the perplexing nature of celebrity and idol
atry and what better place to do this
than in the town that gave us the term
"paparazzi," from Fellini's "La Dolce Vita"?
After hearing his brother-in-law
singing in the shower, Jerry (Woody Allen),
a retired opera director, thinks he's found
the next operatic genius. The trouble is, he
can only sing well in the shower. The solu
tion: put a shower on stage and have the

man sing while bathing to maintain the

integrity of his voice. In another storyline,
Allen satirizes celebrity when Leopoldo
(Roberto Benigni), an average, middle-class
Roman, suddenly becomes famous because
the media arbitrarily decides to make him
so. He unexpectedly finds himself an icon,
constantly surrounded by cameras and
interrogated about the minutiae of his life
how he shaves, boxers or briefs and
what he had for breakfast.
No Woody Allen film is complete
without a bit of mockery of pseudo-intel
lectuals. A young man, Jack (Jesse
Eisenberg), falls madly for flighty actress
Monica (Ellen Page), who happens to be
the best friend of his live-in girlfriend
(Greta Gerwig). Monica knows just enough
