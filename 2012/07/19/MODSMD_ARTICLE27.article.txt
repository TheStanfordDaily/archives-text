In memory of writer-director Nora
Ephron, the master of intelligent
romantic comedies who died on June
26, Intermission presents a list of Ephron's
greatest achievements in entertainment.

"When Harry Met Sally"
"When Harry Met Sally" is indubitably
Ephron's screenwriting masterpiece. It was
made over 20 years ago but still feels con
temporary. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally
(Meg Ryan) hate each other when they first
meet after college, but become friends and
ultimately fall in love after a decade. From
Sally's fake orgasm in a restaurant and

hilariously detailed way of ordering food to
Harry's odd pronunciation of "pecan pie,"
the film is full of memorable character

details. It's this richness and genuinely wise
observations about relationships one of
the characters, for instance, points out the
usefulness of a romantic partner: "You have
someone to go places with!" that keeps

me coming back to it year after year.
"When Harry Met Sally" is a touching and
witty story about two smart people and a
film that certainly transcends its genre.

"You've Got Mail"

"You've Got Mail," which Ephron
wrote and directed, is probably her most
under-appreciated film, easily but incor
rectly dismissed as a remake of her earlier
work, "Sleepless in Seattle." Both tell stories
of couples that fall in love based on letters
from strangers and both star Ryan and
Tom Hanks, but the similarities stop there.
"You've Got Mail" is more than just pure
unapologetic sappiness; it's genuinely
funny, with unparalleled break-up scenes
and non-stop witty repartee. Ryan and
Hanks are at war in the workplace; she
owns the small children's bookshop in the

Upper East Side; he, the big chain book
store opening across the street, threatening
to put her out of business. Meanwhile, they
are anonymous AOL email buddies, falling
madly in love with each other. Yes, you can
guess where this one's going, but it has
some magnificent lines and a whole slew of
unforgettable characters: from Ryan's

boyfriend, who is in love with his type
writer to the point of writing a panegyric
extolling it; to Hanks' aunt, who is a quar
ter of his age; to the cast of characters that

work in Ryan's shop.
"Julie and Julia"
"Julie and Julia" was also
written and directed by Ephron
and explores food and feminism
in the 21st century, and it does
wonders to dissociate cooking
from patriarchal oppression. It's a
film about two strong women
New Yorker Julie (Amy Adams)
and Julia Child (played perfectly
by Meryl Streep) who have a
culinary passion that gives them
power: Their forays in the kitchen
aren't domestic requirements but
a source of joy, pride and, often,

stress. Refreshingly, they also
have supportive husbands not
pushovers to stand by them,
played by Stanley Tucci and Chris
Messina, and the food they cook
undoubtedly leave you craving
French desserts by the end of the
film.

Ephron's published writings
These may get less publicity
than her films, but they assuredly
place Ephron as the wisecracking
Dorothy Parker of her time
(minus the drama). Ephron start
ed out in the newspaper business
and eventually developed a knack

for writing features and confes
sional essays, where she discussed
everything from divorce to food
to the strange parting in her hair
that she wishes people would
point out to her when it goes
awry. Her writing is personal,
funny, insightful and wonderfully
addictive. Her memoir "I
Remember Nothing," published
in 2010 with excerpts printed in
The New Yorker, was certainly
one of the books of the year.
