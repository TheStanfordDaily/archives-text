## WHY THE
						DARK KNIGHT' ISN'T THAT GOOD SASH ANGELES

I was recently caught off-guard
this past Saturday night when,
in the middle of talking to a guy
not un-cute, I might add for my
own vanity —he suddenly stopped
with a look of epiphany mixed with
suspicious disgust in just the right
ratio that I may have mistaken it for
awkward flirting. Until he asked,
with such a look, "Are you the girl
who doesn't like 'The Dark
Knight?'" So, what, this is now a
stigma to describe me by? A marker
of my cultural pariah status?
Fine. I don't like "The Dark
Knight." In fact, I will say that I hate
"The Dark Knight," if only because
everyone else is so utterly, blindly
and unquestioningly in love with
"The Dark Knight," Christopher
Nolan and matte black that I just
can't take it anymore. I'm coming

out of my reticent party corner to
dispel these ridiculous misconcep
tions of what could and should have
been the greatest movie of our time,
and why it spiraled so delicately
into a pile of simply written dia
logue and morally lofty set pieces.
So here it is: a list of the three
reasons why "The Dark Knight"
just isn't that great not to prove
a point or administer a tirade
against the lionized film, but
because I seriously wonder if people
are that bad at movies or if they're
willfully blinding themselves to the
creaky screws of the "Dark Knight"
machinery...
The Joker
We'll start here because it's
most obvious that if there's any
thing good about this movie, it's the

Joker. From his eerily dapper digs
to Heath Ledger's lip-licking utter
ances, the Joker is the perfect villain
... just not a comic-book villain.
But why is he such a devil without a
cause? Oh yeah, there's no reason.
Over the course of the Batman
franchise history, the Joker has had
several backstories, the most preva
lent of which has him as an aspiring
comedian who quits his engineer
ing gig only to tumble into a brew
of nuclear waste. With his pregnant
wife and unborn baby dead
household accident, whodathunk?
the deformed goon goes all the
way to loony land. Now, isn't that
satisfying?
Our beloved "Dark Knight"
Joker has no interesting backstory,
and that was on purpose. Chris
Nolan and company elided the
Joker's origin story so that the char
acter would be presented as
"absolute." Pure, irrational evil,
however, is only relevant during a
horror movie or a biblical tale.
What makes a character interesting
is the tale of how they came to be
("Batman Begins," anyone?) and
the inner conflict the audience
experiences upon realizing that
there is no good and evil but only
motivations and desires, of which
the Joker has none. Even Regina
George had depth.
Hell, that's the whole appeal of

Bruce Wayne/Batman; he's a
spoiled rich kid in a corrupted city
who can't decide whether to use his
resources to buttress the failing law
or just take it over himself. Dil
emm-a!

I'd almost forgive the mind
lessness of the Joker's craziness, but
Nolan decides to limply create
dimension by having the Joker
spout a few contradicting litde
"daddy killed mommy" backstories
that occur too infrequendy to paint
the portrait of a conniving or delu
sional mastermind. Maybe the
other origin stories got relayed to
the deleted scenes.

Moral dilemmas... ?
While we appreciate the mag
nitude and gravity of most comic
book tests of strength, we'd prefer
them without a simplified moral
conundrum to oh-my-gosh com
plicate our heroes' paths. The first
of these comes as a delightful love
triangle trolley dilemma as Batman
must choose his true love, Rachel

Dawes, or the one district attorney
who can maybe save Gotham City,
Harvey Dent. The one he loves or
the potential many Dent could
