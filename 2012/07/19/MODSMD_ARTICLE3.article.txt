## Treharne brings medieval flair to English Department 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
For Elaine Treharne, the Stan
ford English Department's
newest addition, it's all about the
past or in Treharne's case, me
dieval studies, her discipline of
choice.

"For me, [medieval studies] is
about connecting with people
from the past, and also recogniz
ing that people from the past are
affected the same as us, even if the
things around them and the envi
ronment in which we live is so dif
ferent."

Treharne, who has been in the
field for over 20 years, specializes
in the cultural contexts, contents
and languages of early English
manuscripts and as a result has
become an expert on medieval
texts and teachings.
Treharne, 47, was born in
Aberystwyth, a small town in
Wales. She grew up as an active
member of her congregation at St.
Peter's Church in Carmarthen,
along with the rest of her family,
including her stepfather, who
played organ during church and
served as choirmaster. Treharne's
mother and brother were in the

church choir too, and so the fami
ly spent much time performing at
church services, weddings and
Christmas specials.

Treharne recalls that most of
her childhood was spent cycling
around her neighborhood with
her friends, adventuring all day
long with only biscuits and orange
juice and returning at night to tea
with her family.
"I had a busy childhood
that's the best way to put it," Tre
harne said.

Reading was also a cherished
pastime for the budding academ
ic. She read everything from

Edith Blyton to any classic novel
she could get her hands on. Be
tween pursuing a vibrant intellec
tual life and performing in her
church choir, Treharne led an ac
tive life.

Treharne's mother, a history
teacher, profoundly influenced
her interest in medieval studies.
She had always been fond of writ
ing, but it was the numerous me
dieval cathedrals and the monas
teries her mother took her to as a
young child that really piqued
Treharne's interest.
