## Treharne brings medieval flair to English Department 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
For Elaine Treharne, the Stan
ford English Department's
newest addition, it's all about the
past or in Treharne's case, me
dieval studies, her discipline of
choice.

"For me, [medieval studies] is
about connecting with people
from the past, and also recogniz
ing that people from the past are
affected the same as us, even if the
things around them and the envi
ronment in which we live is so dif
ferent."

Treharne, who has been in the
field for over 20 years, specializes
in the cultural contexts, contents
and languages of early English
manuscripts and as a result has
become an expert on medieval
texts and teachings.
Treharne, 47, was born in
Aberystwyth, a small town in
Wales. She grew up as an active
member of her congregation at St.
Peter's Church in Carmarthen,
along with the rest of her family,
including her stepfather, who
played organ during church and
served as choirmaster. Treharne's
mother and brother were in the

church choir too, and so the fami
ly spent much time performing at
church services, weddings and
Christmas specials.

Treharne recalls that most of
her childhood was spent cycling
around her neighborhood with
her friends, adventuring all day
long with only biscuits and orange
juice and returning at night to tea
with her family.
"I had a busy childhood
that's the best way to put it," Tre
harne said.

Reading was also a cherished
pastime for the budding academ
ic. She read everything from

Edith Blyton to any classic novel
she could get her hands on. Be
tween pursuing a vibrant intellec
tual life and performing in her
church choir, Treharne led an ac
tive life.

Treharne's mother, a history
teacher, profoundly influenced
her interest in medieval studies.
She had always been fond of writ
ing, but it was the numerous me
dieval cathedrals and the monas
teries her mother took her to as a
young child that really piqued
Treharne's interest.

As depicted in this elementary
school sketch, Treharne had early
writing and teaching ambitions.
"I had a clear idea that I want
ed to work with literature and
writing and teaching when I was
extremely young, and it has to be
because my mother was a history
teacher," she said.
By the age of 12, Treharne
knew that she wanted to work
with medieval records.

"[Medieval texts give me] a
chance to connect with people
who lived more than a thousand
years ago in away that is very dif
ficult to do other than through ex
amining texts," she said.
To pursue her passion, Tre
harne attended the University of
Manchester, where she majored
in medieval studies and met her
future husband, Andy, to whom
she's been married for 21 years.
From there, she was awarded a
Procter Fellowship at Princeton
University for her third year of
doctoral studies, where she ob
tained her master's, also in me
dieval studies, before returning to
the United Kingdom to attend the
University of Manchester and
then the University of Liverpool
to finish her Ph.D.

After attending college, Tre
harne got married, moved to
Cambridge and taught at the
University of Leicester, one of
the United Kingdom's top uni
versities, for what Treharne de
clared to be 15 "glorious years."
She went from being a lecturer to
a professor to a dean, and it was
then that she realized she wanted
to take her talents elsewhere,
and so in 2005-2006 she and her
family of four moved across the
pond.

that the real jewel in Stanford's
crown is that it is the top-rated
university in the world for arts
and humanities, something she
feels people often overlook due
to its renown in the sciences.
Although she's eager to start
her new teaching job, Treharne is
also looking forward to enjoying
her new home's proximity to cam
pus.
"I'm excited that I can walk to
work, because it's the first time
ever I've been able to do that,"
she said. "It was a 50-mile drive
when I worked at Leicester."
Gavin Jones, head of the Eng
lish Department, is just as eager
to welcome Treharne to campus.
"We hired Elaine because she
is quite simply the best Medieval
ist for Stanford," Jones said in an

Upon arriving to the United
States, Treharne secured a job
teaching in the English Depart
ment at Florida State University.
While at Florida State, Treharne
continued to write and edit books
on medieval teachings. To date,
she has worked on 23 academic
texts, which have won a number
of awards.
When Treharne was offered a
teaching job at Stanford in early
2012, she and her husband were
thrilled that she had reached the
big time, due to Stanford's "repu
tation for brilliance."

However, Treharne believes

email to The Daily. "She is also an
astoundingly fine teacher who
will reach out to undergraduates
by bringing to life materials that
can sometimes seem difficult and
inaccessible. Elaine is, in this
sense, a Stanford Thinker
through and through."
Treharne will drive to Stanford
from Tallahassee starting Aug. 1
in two cars with her husband, her
two children, their two black lab
mixes and their "lunatic" black cat
named Jack Sparrow.
And come fall, Treharne will
continue to teach the past while
focusing on crafting a future at
Stanford one medieval text at
a time.

Treharne's mother, a history

her interest in medieval studies.

young child that really piqued
Treharne's interest.

As depicted in this elementary
school sketch, Treharne had early
writing and teaching ambitions.
"I had a clear idea that I want
ed to work with literature and
writing and teaching when I was
extremely young, and it has to be
because my mother was a history
teacher," she said.
By the age of 12, Treharne
knew that she wanted to work
with medieval records.

"[Medieval texts give me] a
chance to connect with people
who lived more than a thousand
years ago in away that is very dif
ficult to do other than through ex
amining texts," she said.
To pursue her passion, Tre
harne attended the University of
Manchester, where she majored
in medieval studies and met her
future husband, Andy, to whom
she's been married for 21 years.
From there, she was awarded a
Procter Fellowship at Princeton
University for her third year of
doctoral studies, where she ob
tained her master's, also in me
dieval studies, before returning to
the United Kingdom to attend the
University of Manchester and
then the University of Liverpool
to finish her Ph.D.

After attending college, Tre
harne got married, moved to
Cambridge and taught at the
University of Leicester, one of
the United Kingdom's top uni
versities, for what Treharne de
clared to be 15 "glorious years."
She went from being a lecturer to
a professor to a dean, and it was
then that she realized she wanted
to take her talents elsewhere,
and so in 2005-2006 she and her
family of four moved across the
pond.

that the real jewel in Stanford's
crown is that it is the top-rated
university in the world for arts
and humanities, something she
feels people often overlook due
to its renown in the sciences.
Although she's eager to start
her new teaching job, Treharne is
also looking forward to enjoying
her new home's proximity to cam
pus.
"I'm excited that I can walk to
work, because it's the first time
ever I've been able to do that,"
she said. "It was a 50-mile drive
when I worked at Leicester."
Gavin Jones, head of the Eng

to welcome Treharne to campus.

is quite simply the best Medieval

Upon arriving to the United
States, Treharne secured a job
teaching in the English Depart
ment at Florida State University.
While at Florida State, Treharne
continued to write and edit books
on medieval teachings. To date,
she has worked on 23 academic
texts, which have won a number
of awards.
When Treharne was offered a
teaching job at Stanford in early
2012, she and her husband were
thrilled that she had reached the
big time, due to Stanford's "repu

astoundingly fine teacher who
will reach out to undergraduates

through and through."
Treharne will drive to Stanford
from Tallahassee starting Aug. 1

two children, their two black lab

continue to teach the past while

For Elaine Treharne, the Stan
ford English Department's
newest addition, it's all about the
past or in Treharne's case, me
dieval studies, her discipline of
choice.

"For me, [medieval studies] is
about connecting with people
from the past, and also recogniz
ing that people from the past are
affected the same as us, even if the
things around them and the envi
ronment in which we live is so dif
ferent."

Treharne, who has been in the
field for over 20 years, specializes
in the cultural contexts, contents
and languages of early English
manuscripts and as a result has
become an expert on medieval
texts and teachings.
Treharne, 47, was born in
Aberystwyth, a small town in
Wales. She grew up as an active
member of her congregation at St.
Peter's Church in Carmarthen,
along with the rest of her family,
including her stepfather, who
played organ during church and
served as choirmaster. Treharne's
mother and brother were in the

church choir too, and so the fami
ly spent much time performing at
church services, weddings and
Christmas specials.

Treharne recalls that most of
her childhood was spent cycling
around her neighborhood with
her friends, adventuring all day
long with only biscuits and orange
juice and returning at night to tea
with her family.
"I had a busy childhood
that's the best way to put it," Tre
harne said.

Reading was also a cherished
pastime for the budding academ

Edith Blyton to any classic novel
