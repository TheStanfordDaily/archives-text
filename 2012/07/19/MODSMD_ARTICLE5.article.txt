## ID scanners, alarms to be added in Row houses 
### KLAIRE TAN DAILY INTERN 
Starting next semester, resi
dents of the Row will begin using
ID card readers instead of house
keys to unlock their front doors.
Installation of locks and alarm
systems will begin in September
and is expected to continue into
the academic year.

Once card readers are in
stalled at Row houses, residents
will enter houses with their Stan
ford IDs instead of keys. Accord
ing to Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing, par
ticipants in courses held at Row
houses, eating associates and
other authorized visitors can be
programmed into the system for
meals or classes without checking
out another key or having a resi
dent open the door.

"The [building access system]
allows a great deal of flexibility in
terms of access for residents and
guests," Whitney told The Daily
in an email.

Row houses don't appear con
vinced, and the project has gar

nered many complaints from stu
dents living on the Row. Less
than a day after the news was sent
to the more than 300 co-op resi
dents of the Row, students were
already writing back to Co-op
Living Peer Advisor Steven
Crane 'll with strong opinions
about the project.

"One student thought this
might be a good thing," but the
rest of the student email reactions
"ranged from the concerned to
the adamantly opposed to the
profanely enraged," Crane said.
The decision to update house
entry on the Row is part of a
much larger. University-wide
plan to reform building access.
The project proposes that all res
idential and academic facilities
will have alarm systems installed.
Discussion of the project began in
2006, and Student Housing is cur
rently in the process of adding
card readers to all undergraduate
residences.

According to the initial pro
posal, updating the Row's securi
ty was slated for later in the multi
year, University-wide project.

However, following an analysis of
public safety that showed the ma
jority of campus thefts and break
ins occurred on the Row, plans
there were prioritized. Row hous
es are located on the outskirts of
campus and often have fire es
capes that allow easy entry. Im
plementing alarm systems to
monitor building access is intend
ed to help prevent theft, break
ins and unwelcome visitors.
"The use of door alarms has
enabled a higher security level for
residents," Whitney said. "Doors
are no longer accidentally or in
tentionally left open, which
means that individuals who do
not belong in a residence are pre

eluded or have a much harder
time gaining access."
While many students thought
that alarm systems will give Row
houses an impersonal feel, the
main source of student discontent
is not the implementation of door
alarms but the lack of student
input in the decision, according to
Crane.

"[Housing] make[s] [their de
cisions] in their own best inter
ests, and the interests of the stu
dents that are impacted by this
policy are an afterthought, an as
pect of implementation," Crane
said. "We are not asked about

these things from the start."
However, according to Whit
ney, Student Housing has made
sure to communicate with stu
dents living in residences that have
previously undergone the imple
mentation of card readers
"Students have played a major
role in all of Student Housing's
card access projects since the be
ginning," he said. "Resident fel
lows and students have been sur
veyed as part of the decision-mak

ing and implementation process
es. We have also maintained com
munication with the residents of
each house as the installations
have progressed."
Both Whitney and Crane agree
that a thorough discussion should
take place during the implementa
tion of the program on the Row.
"It is my understanding, and
hope, that decisions that affect the
daily life of thousands of students
[are] ones that [happen] with
transparency, with explanation
and with copious student input,"
Crane said.
