# Stanford professors make progress in race to cure HIV

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Amrutha Dorai 
Recent research conducted by the Wen
der Group, consisting of 19 chemists as well as
Stanford professor Paul Wender, could point
to the existence of potential cure for HIV.
Although highly active antiretroviral ther
apy (HAART) has prevented HIV from hav
ing a fatal effect for almost 20 years, it is bur
dened with a number of problems. The neces
sity for the treatment to be regularly adminis
tered not only brings about a number of neg-
ative side effects, but also makes
HAART impractical for usage in
Third World countries.
These issues arise from the
fact that HAART does not suc
ceed at eradicating the full virus;
certain dormant forms are left
behind, threatening to re
emerge if not constantly pushed
back by the treatment.
The Wender Group's goal
was to synthesize a compound
that would activate an enzyme
called kinase C, which would in
turn activate the latent forms of
the virus and allow HAART to
eliminate it entirely.
This synthetic compound
called a bryolog was modeled
after two naturally occurring com

pounds called prostratin and
bryostatin 1, both of which were
either too impotent or too difficult
to obtain.

The group has now succeeded
at this goal of creating a bryolog.
This new compound has no ap
parent toxic effects and has a po
tency that is 25 to 1,000 times
greater than that of prostratin.
However, it is still in its prelimi
nary stages and needs to undergo
further development before it is
ready to use on human subjects.
