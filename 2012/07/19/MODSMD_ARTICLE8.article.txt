## CS becomes most popular major 
### KYLIE JUE DAILY INTERN 
Two hundred twenty students declared as
computer science majors in the 2011-2012
school year, making it the most popular un
dergraduate major at Stanford.
Interest in the major over the last few
years has had its ups and downs, said Mehran
Sahami, a computer science professor and as
sociate chair for the department's education
program.
"The enrollment during the past decade
has been on a little bit of a roller coaster. [En
rollment] peaked in 2000 at the height of the
dot-com bubble, and during the next five
years ... they dropped by about 50 percent.
More recently, in the last few
years . . . we've seen a pretty
strong increase in enrollment. We
have the largest number of com
puter science major declarations
[in 2011-2012] that we've ever
had," he said.

He attributes a lot of this re
cent growth to a significant over
haul of the computer science cur
riculum in 2009. During that aca
demic year, Sahami and a com
mittee of his colleagues re-invent
ed the program, changing major
requirements and making it more
interdisciplinary. Following that
change, the computer science
program saw an 83 percent in
crease in enrollment within the
first two years.
"[The new program] was a sig
nificant revamp of the previous
major requirements, which pretty
much existed with some modifi
cations here and there for the pre
vious 20 years," Sahami said.
"[The new curriculum] reduced
the number of core classes every
one was required to take, and
we've put in a track structure
where students can select the
track they are most interested in."
The tracks include systems,
graphics, theory, biocomputation
and more. Of the six core courses,
three have a theoretical focus,
while the others emphasize pro
gramming and systems. The new
multidisciplinary electives in
clude options outside the Com
puter Science Department and
range from biology to studio art.
With its greater flexibility, the
new program's goal is to allow
students to apply their knowledge
outside the field.

Professor Eric Roberts, who
began teaching computer science
at Stanford in 1990, emphasized
the plethora of options within the
major today and contrasted them
with the much stricter require
ments of the program when he
first started teaching.
"The change that's critically
important is that... we have in
creased the flexibility of the un
dergraduate program," he said.
"[Twenty years ago], the comput
er science major was entirely
specified. Every course that you
had to submit for your degree was

required. The track program has
even more flexibility, and that, of
course, makes it more attractive
to a broader range of students."
Of course, computer science
has also undergone a comeback
since the last dot-com bubble.
Technology companies, especial
ly in the Silicon Valley, continue
to hire and pay graduates in the
field.

"There's no question that the
Valley will soar with students.
Each time ... I've been there,
I've talked with industry people
about the Stanford program,"
Roberts said. "They're very excit
ed about what we teach, but they
can't understand why we're
teaching so few."
The problem, according to
both professors, is that faculty
hiring necessarily lags behind the
incredible growth in the depart
ment over the last few years. "If
the enrollment is going up by 35
percent a year, there's no way we
can keep pace ... the class size
will go up," Roberts said.
Finally, the fact that technolo
gy is playing an increasingly im
portant role in our everyday lives
has meant that more and more
students are choosing to take
classes in computer science.

"I think with more consumer
applications that people grow up
using, they're much more familiar
and comfortable with technolo
gy," Sahami said. "So there are
more people interested in finding
out how to be not only consumers
of technology but also producers
of technology."

change, the computer science
program saw an 83 percent in
crease in enrollment within the
first two years.
"[The new program] was a sig
nificant revamp of the previous
major requirements, which pretty
much existed with some modifi
cations here and there for the pre
vious 20 years," Sahami said.
"[The new curriculum] reduced
the number of core classes every
one was required to take, and
we've put in a track structure
where students can select the
track they are most interested in."
The tracks include systems,
graphics, theory, biocomputation
and more. Of the six core courses,
three have a theoretical focus,
while the others emphasize pro
gramming and systems. The new
multidisciplinary electives in
clude options outside the Com
puter Science Department and
range from biology to studio art.
With its greater flexibility, the
new program's goal is to allow
students to apply their knowledge
outside the field.

Professor Eric Roberts, who
began teaching computer science
at Stanford in 1990, emphasized
the plethora of options within the
major today and contrasted them
with the much stricter require
ments of the program when he
first started teaching.
"The change that's critically
important is that... we have in
creased the flexibility of the un
dergraduate program," he said.
"[Twenty years ago], the comput
er science major was entirely
specified. Every course that you
had to submit for your degree was

required. The track program has
even more flexibility, and that, of
course, makes it more attractive
to a broader range of students."
Of course, computer science
has also undergone a comeback
since the last dot-com bubble.
Technology companies, especial
ly in the Silicon Valley, continue
to hire and pay graduates in the
field.

"There's no question that the
Valley will soar with students.
Each time ... I've been there,
I've talked with industry people
about the Stanford program,"
Roberts said. "They're very excit
ed about what we teach, but they
can't understand why we're
teaching so few."
The problem, according to
both professors, is that faculty
hiring necessarily lags behind the
incredible growth in the depart
ment over the last few years. "If
the enrollment is going up by 35
percent a year, there's no way we
can keep pace ... the class size
will go up," Roberts said.
Finally, the fact that technolo
gy is playing an increasingly im
portant role in our everyday lives
has meant that more and more
students are choosing to take
classes in computer science.

"I think with more consumer
applications that people grow up
using, they're much more familiar
and comfortable with technolo
gy," Sahami said. "So there are
more people interested in finding
out how to be not only consumers
of technology but also producers
of technology."

The enrollment
during the past
decade has been
on a little bit of a
roller coaster.
