### KYLIE JUE DAILY INTERN 
Two hundred twenty students declared as
computer science majors in the 2011-2012
school year, making it the most popular un
dergraduate major at Stanford.
Interest in the major over the last few
years has had its ups and downs, said Mehran
Sahami, a computer science professor and as
sociate chair for the department's education
program.
"The enrollment during the past decade
has been on a little bit of a roller coaster. [En
rollment] peaked in 2000 at the height of the
dot-com bubble, and during the next five
years ... they dropped by about 50 percent.
