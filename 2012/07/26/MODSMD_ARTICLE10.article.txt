The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) has contacted
Margaret Collins, director of the
Center for Research on Women here, in
its effort to recruit women to become
astronauts in its space shuttle prog
ram. Collins has not recommended
any specific person, but she has for
warded the request to other people and
organizations.
"We are using a sex blind selection
process," said a public information of
ficer at the Lyndon R. fohnson Space
Center in Houston, Texas. NASA is
conducting a year-long search ending
June 30, 1977 for applicants to its as
tronaut training program. To date they
have received more than 1000 applica
tions. Roughly 10 per cant of these
have been from women.
A spokesman for Ames Research <
Center in Mountain View said that an

female cosmonaut, Valentina Tenssh
kova. She flew a mission, Voslok Six,
on June 16,1963. No women have gone
into space since.
The space shuttle flights for which
NASA is stepping up i ts rflcru i tment of
women will carry a crew of three
NASA trained people: a commander, a
pilot and e mission specialist NASA
will choose at least 15 people for pilot
training and at least 15 for the mission
specialist position.
Three different jobs
Pilots will fly the shuttle and be re
sponsible for its maintenance. Mission
specialists will coordinate the com
mand of the shuttle with the particular
project of each flight. The shuttle will
be used to jxerform missions ranging
from the upkeep of satellites to the per
forming of experiments in many fields
of science.

According to Fred Crawford, elec
trical engineering professor here, who
NASA consulted about the spa ce shut
tle program, experiments to be done on
shuttle flights are still in the planning
Stages. One to four people will be on
each flight to operate these projects.
These people will need only limited
training, probably a few months, said
Crawford.
Crawford forecasts the first shuttle
flights wilfbo fn 1979 or 1980. Suc
cessful applicants fur the astronaut
positions will begin training in July
1978, according to NASA. "Oiey will
train for two years after which pilots
and mission specialists will be chosen
for the different flights.
However, the federal government
has not made any final commitment or
budgetary allocations for future space
programs.
