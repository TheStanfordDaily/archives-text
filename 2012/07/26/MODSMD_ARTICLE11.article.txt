### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Edward Ngai 
Sally Ride '73 M.S. '75 Ph.D. '7B,
an astronaut and physicist with
deep ties to the Stanford communi
ty, passed away today at 61 after a
long battle with pancreatic cancer.
While at Stanford studying for
her doctorate in physics, Ride came
across an ad for NASA "mission
specialists" in The Daily. She would
eventually become the youngest
American and first American
woman in space.

Ride logged more than 300 hours
on Space Shuttle Challenger and
later served on the committee in
vestigating the Challenger disaster
in 1986. She then returned to Stan
ford and became a fellow at what
was then the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control
(CISAC).
In 1989, Ride became a physics
professor at the University of Cali
fornia, San Diego and served as di
rector of the California Space Insti
tute.

Ride's presence is still on campus,
though, as Stanford continues to
host her summer program for girls
interested in science. Participants in
the 2012 Sally Ride Science Camps
arrive next week.

The encouragement of young
women to enter math and science
fields had been one of Ride's life
long passions and she authored or

Co-authored seven science books
for children.

At Stanford, Ride played for the
varsity tennis team and completed
four degrees: concurrent bachelor's
degrees in English and physics and
an M.S. and Ph.D. in physics.
"Sally was a national hero and a
powerful role model," President
Barack Obama said today in
a statement. "She inspired genera
tions of young girls to reach for the
stars."
