## Eric Roberts: king of computers Longtime Stanford computer science professor Eric Roberts reflects on his storied career 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
From a very early age, Stanford
Computer Science Professor Eric
Roberts had a ready answer when
ever people asked him what he
wanted to be when he grew up.
"I always knew that I wanted to
be a professor," Roberts said.
"When everyone else wanted to
be a fireman, I wanted to be a pro
fessor."

He's realized his dream. Now
one of Stanford's most prominent
professors, he has received several
university-level teaching awards,
been active in professional organi
zations dedicated to computer sci
ence education and promoted so
cially responsible use of science
and technology.
"My greatest interest lies in
drawing people to the field. I have
a special interest in broadening
it," he said.
Born to a father who taught po
litical science at the University of
Nevada, he grew up saturated in
academic intensity. "There were
books everywhere in the house,"
Roberts remembers, describing a
childhood of intellectual vitality.
As early as middle school,
Roberts began tinkering with
electronic sets and old radios. He
became fascinated with electrical
engineering and grew to love com
puting soon after, learning how to
program in 1965 barely a
decade after the initial develop
ment of the computer. He was 13
at the time.

Then, when Roberts was in
high school, an unexpected turn of
events planted him firmly on the
track of computer science. The
space race, the United States' su
perpower arms race with the Sovi
et Union during the Cold War, re
sulted in the Soviet Union's
launch of Sputnik and the first
man into space. Upon losing the
technological race, the United
States poured a great deal of

money into improving science ed
ucation. Roberts reaped the bene
fits.

"Universities were given con
tracts to have special science train
ing programs for high school scien
tists, and I went to one on comput
er science after my junior year," he
said. "That was where I really be
came expert in computing."
It wasn't possible to major in
computer science during his un
dergraduate years at Harvard, so
Roberts turned to applied mathe
matics instead. (The first comput
er science majors at Harvard were
in the '9os; the first at Stanford was
in 1986). In his computer science
classes, however, he had the op
portunity to witness firsthand
some of the earliest developments
in the field.

"A lot of times I remember my
professors would be telling me
about results that today would
seem like part of the foundation of
the field, but at the time they had
just happened," he said. "It would
fly around in the classroom, so it
was really being there in the be
ginning. It was really exciting."
Now, nearly 30 years later,
Roberts has risen through the ed
ucational hierarchy himself. He

cites his greatest contribution to
the field not as any concrete
breakthrough though through
the years he has developed an
original form of parsing, run the
first Dungeons and Dragons
game, helped create Karel the
Robot, a robot that teaches stu
dents how to program, and written
four acclaimed textbooks but
instead his contributions to the ed
ucation of computer science.
"I think a lot about how to get
people excited about [computer
science], how to teach people
about it," Roberts said. "I've been
very interested in broadening its
exposure to include more women,
to include people who don't ordi
narily think about it."
From 1998 to 2005, for exam
ple, Roberts was the principal in
vestigator for the Bermuda Pro
ject, a project that built the com
puter science curriculum for
Bermuda's public high schools.
"Through [the project], we
were able to get a lot of the
Bermudian public school popula
tion into the high-tech industry,"
he said. "It was great. It's had
enormous impact."
Additionally, in his mission to
expand computer science expo
sure to more women, he mentored
Marissa Mayer '97 M.S. '99, one of
the leading women in computer
science. Formerly a Google exec
utive, she was named Yahoo's
new CEO last week.

In "Making it Big in Software:
Get the Job. Work the Org. Be
come Great." by Sam Lightstone ,
Mayer cited Roberts as a teacher
who had a pivotal effect on her ca
reer.

"He's been a big proponent of
women in technology throughout
his career, so he sort of scooped
me up and really encouraged me,"
she said.

In addition to championing
computer science exposure to the
underrepresented, Roberts has a
teaching method some may con
sider unique. He has taught Stan
ford's Introduction to the Human
ities, finding connections on how
technology affects Utopian visions.

that his passion for technology
was influced by the Space Race
and his desire to contribute to the
burgeoning field of technology.
