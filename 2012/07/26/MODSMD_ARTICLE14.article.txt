## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN On freedom and fizzy things 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The New York City Board of
Health will vote September
13 on whether to implement
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's pro
posed ban on sugary soda in con
tainers larger than 16 ounces.
Rather than having a pragmatic, de
tail-oriented, empirically-based dis
cussion about the merits of
Bloomberg's proposal, however,
New Yorkers have, in true Ameri
can style, elevated the debate into
nothing less than a blood-and-tears
struggle for freedom against the op
pressive forces of tyrannical statism.
City Councilman Daniel Hallo
ran invoked Martin Niemoller and
resurrected the threatening specter
of Nazism. "When they came for
the cigarettes, I didn't say anything.
I didn't smoke. When they came for
the MSG, I really didn't care be
cause I didn't order it very often.
I'm not a big salt eater, so I didn't
mind when you guys regulated salt.
But what will the government be
telling me next?"

Eight-year-olds grabbed Big
Gulps and slurped them provoca
tively at a 200-person mass protest
outside City Hall. Soda company
spokesmen wailed loudly about the
impending demise of personal lib
erty. And City Councilman Oliver
Koppell denounced the ban as "a
clear overreaching of government
into people's everyday lives." "This
infringement on the rights of New
Yorkers," lamented Koppell,
"leads us to ask: what will be
banned next?"
Oddly, it would have been a bet
ter idea for Koppell et al. to ditch
the high-minded rhetoric and stick
with the empirics. Because practi
cally speaking, the plan is unlikely
to work. People will buy two small
er drinks at one store, go next door
and buy another or make up the
calories with a Big Mac and a beer.
But it is precisely on the princi
ple that each man has the right to
eat and drink as he likes the
grounds on which the anti-anti-soda

people have staked their argument
that the pro-gastronomic-free
dom crowd is wrong. Such an argu
ment might once have made ethical
sense in a world in which each indi
vidual bore the whole cost of her
poor decisions. But in a post-Af
fordable Care Act world of mutual
dependence and interconnected
costs, there can be no expected right
to other people's money without
the expected responsibility to use it
wisely or face the consequences.
As I briefly argued in my last col
umn, a world in which some people
have the right to eat, drink and
smoke themselves into oblivion at
the legally mandated expense of
everyone else would be neither effi
cient nor fair. It would be inefficient
because there would be little incen
tive to treat oneself well if society
bears the costs of not doing so, min

imizing the chance that individuals
will make healthy lifestyle choices.
And it would be unfair because no
one should have to pay for his
neighbor's irresponsibility one
reason our society is so rightly fed
up with bank bailouts and golden
parachutes for the creators of toxic
derivatives.

Rights especially so-called
positive rights, or rights to some
thing of value provided by the gov
ernment generally entail re
sponsibilities, regulations or con
ditions on the use of the item of
value. One can drive as he likes on
his own private raceway; on the
public roads, he is subject to stop
lights and speed limits. When one

makes money, he may spend it as
he likes; when he receives food
stamps, he must spend it on food.
One may use his own money to
purchase plastic surgery, but
Medicare covers only medically
necessary procedures and drugs.
In short, we can have personal
freedom or we can have govern
ment generosity, but we ought not
to have both. Eat and drink as you
like, but don't expect everyone
else to pay for the consequences.
Or vote as we have to care
for the public with taxpayer
money and accept the practical re
strictions on personal behavior
that are likely to follow. We can
not expect a fiscally sustainable,
fair and just society to do other
wise in New York or anywhere
else.

ment might once have made ethical
sense in a world in which each indi
vidual bore the whole cost of her
poor decisions. But in a post-Af
fordable Care Act world of mutual
dependence and interconnected
costs, there can be no expected right
to other people's money without
the expected responsibility to use it
wisely or face the consequences.
As I briefly argued in my last col
umn, a world in which some people
have the right to eat, drink and
smoke themselves into oblivion at
the legally mandated expense of
everyone else would be neither effi
cient nor fair. It would be inefficient
because there would be little incen
tive to treat oneself well if society
bears the costs of not doing so, min

imizing the chance that individuals
will make healthy lifestyle choices.
And it would be unfair because no
one should have to pay for his
neighbor's irresponsibility one
reason our society is so rightly fed
up with bank bailouts and golden
parachutes for the creators of toxic
derivatives.

Rights especially so-called
positive rights, or rights to some
thing of value provided by the gov
ernment generally entail re
sponsibilities, regulations or con
ditions on the use of the item of
value. One can drive as he likes on
his own private raceway; on the
public roads, he is subject to stop
lights and speed limits. When one

makes money, he may spend it as
he likes; when he receives food
stamps, he must spend it on food.
One may use his own money to
purchase plastic surgery, but
Medicare covers only medically
necessary procedures and drugs.
In short, we can have personal
freedom or we can have govern
ment generosity, but we ought not
to have both. Eat and drink as you
like, but don't expect everyone
else to pay for the consequences.
Or vote as we have to care
for the public with taxpayer
money and accept the practical re
strictions on personal behavior
that are likely to follow. We can
not expect a fiscally sustainable,
fair and just society to do other
wise in New York or anywhere
else.
