## Confronting the poverty gap in Cairo, Egypt 
### Fatima Wagdy 
As I walk the streets of Cairo
this summer, barefoot chil
dren begging me for a few
Egyptian pounds confront me.
Their mothers shower me with reli
gious pleas; they tell me that God
will bless me, that I will be reward
ed, that it's Ramadan. It's not as
though I haven't ever been asked to
spare some change on University
Avenue or in San Francisco; we've
all seen this. But these appeals are
different. The sheer number of poor
people in the street is saddening.
For every poor person who asks me
for money, I see several more just
lounging about on the ground.

The gap between the rich and
the poor is so blatantly obvious
here, as is the severity of the pover
ty. Day after day, I witness the scale
of the inequalities as I encounter
people trying to sell me a pack of
gum or a packet of tissues for just a
pound (literally less than 20 cents).
They are desperate to make a small
profit on the stash of cheap little tis
sue packets they managed to buy.
They aren't even trying to rip me
off; they just want to sell something
in the hopes that they will get
enough money to buy some food. I
guess these are people who will not
"succumb" to begging, but I can
sense they are extremely eager to
know what they can sell me to make
me part with just a few of the
pounds tucked tightly in my purse. I
can see the dirt on their faces, their
clothes and their feet. Many times, I

can see that their teeth have more
than rotted away.

It saddens me even more to
know that many people who are
much better off than those selling
tissues or begging on the street still
live in substandard conditions.
When the elevator in my apartment
building is broken, I am forced to
hop over a flat, dirty mattress that
blocks the path to the last flight of
stairs. Apparently this is where the
bawab, the doorman, sleeps, right
outside the apartment on the sec
ond floor.

Over 20 percent of the people in
this country are below the poverty
line, and over 30 percent are illiter
ate. And I know that many of the
people who are officially above the
poverty line struggle to survive on
their measly paychecks. Even those
with a university education struggle
to find jobs as the unemployment
rate soars. What's worse is that
there are countries much poorer
than Egypt.
This poverty plagues me with
guilt and a million questions as I
continue in my very comfortable
lifestyle. Will randomly handing
some people a few pounds here
and there help at all? What do I do
when I've already got two packs of
gum and several tissue packs in my
purse? What about when I've
bought all the fruits I need from
the fruit seller on the street corner?
What do I do? What should I do?
Why isn't what's currently being
done by these experts out there
working? Was it always like this?
I see this poverty here and feel
like something is broken. I know
that things shouldn't be this way
and wonder if I am part of the prob
lem. It is uncomfortable to be con
fronted by my relative privilege
every single day. It is unnerving to
feel like I'm a jerk if I don't give
more money to the poor people on
the street. But perhaps that's what
we all need a bit more discom
fort in our daily lives. Perhaps we

all need to feel as though having
people below the poverty line at all
is intolerable to the point where we
absolutely cannot ignore it. Maybe
then it would become a bigger pri
ority. But what if the public policy
shirts are right? What if caring a lot
is not enough to start to alleviate
poverty?
Many people at Stanford,
whether it's professors or stu
dents, do care a lot. And some de
vote their work and their lives to
addressing these problems in a va
riety of ways. In the Bay Area,
there are a myriad of foundations
that invest millions of dollars to at
tack these problems. Yet these
problems remain; I still see deep
inequalities every single day. I
wonder what is necessary to elimi
nate a large chunk of the poverty
in the world. I wonder what must
happen for it to disappear. What
should we be doing, individually
and collectively, as people in one
of the wealthiest countries on
earth?

As I ponder the complexity of
global poverty, I remember that it
is not a new problem; we know from
history that it is an age-old problem
encountered by every generation. I
wonder why we haven't figured it
out by now, and part of me feels the
answers are simpler than we think.

Why isn't what's currently being
done by these experts out there
working? Was it always like this?
I see this poverty here and feel
like something is broken. I know
that things shouldn't be this way
and wonder if I am part of the prob
lem. It is uncomfortable to be con
fronted by my relative privilege
every single day. It is unnerving to
feel like I'm a jerk if I don't give
more money to the poor people on
the street. But perhaps that's what
we all need a bit more discom
fort in our daily lives. Perhaps we

all need to feel as though having
people below the poverty line at all
is intolerable to the point where we
absolutely cannot ignore it. Maybe
then it would become a bigger pri
ority. But what if the public policy
shirts are right? What if caring a lot
is not enough to start to alleviate
poverty?
Many people at Stanford,
whether it's professors or stu
dents, do care a lot. And some de
vote their work and their lives to
addressing these problems in a va
riety of ways. In the Bay Area,
there are a myriad of foundations
that invest millions of dollars to at
tack these problems. Yet these
problems remain; I still see deep
inequalities every single day. I
wonder what is necessary to elimi
nate a large chunk of the poverty
in the world. I wonder what must
happen for it to disappear. What
should we be doing, individually
and collectively, as people in one
of the wealthiest countries on
earth?

As I ponder the complexity of
global poverty, I remember that it
is not a new problem; we know from
history that it is an age-old problem
encountered by every generation. I
wonder why we haven't figured it
out by now, and part of me feels the
answers are simpler than we think.

As I walk the streets of Cairo
this summer, barefoot chil
dren begging me for a few
Egyptian pounds confront me.
Their mothers shower me with reli
gious pleas; they tell me that God
will bless me, that I will be reward
ed, that it's Ramadan. It's not as
though I haven't ever been asked to
spare some change on University
Avenue or in San Francisco; we've
all seen this. But these appeals are
different. The sheer number of poor
people in the street is saddening.
For every poor person who asks me
for money, I see several more just
lounging about on the ground.

The gap between the rich and
the poor is so blatantly obvious
here, as is the severity of the pover
ty. Day after day, I witness the scale
of the inequalities as I encounter
people trying to sell me a pack of
gum or a packet of tissues for just a
pound (literally less than 20 cents).
They are desperate to make a small
profit on the stash of cheap little tis
sue packets they managed to buy.
They aren't even trying to rip me
off; they just want to sell something
in the hopes that they will get
enough money to buy some food. I
guess these are people who will not
"succumb" to begging, but I can
sense they are extremely eager to
know what they can sell me to make
me part with just a few of the
pounds tucked tightly in my purse. I
can see the dirt on their faces, their
clothes and their feet. Many times, I

can see that their teeth have more
than rotted away.

It saddens me even more to
know that many people who are
much better off than those selling
tissues or begging on the street still
live in substandard conditions.
When the elevator in my apartment
building is broken, I am forced to
hop over a flat, dirty mattress that
blocks the path to the last flight of
stairs. Apparently this is where the
bawab, the doorman, sleeps, right
outside the apartment on the sec
ond floor.

Over 20 percent of the people in
this country are below the poverty
line, and over 30 percent are illiter
ate. And I know that many of the
people who are officially above the
poverty line struggle to survive on
their measly paychecks. Even those
with a university education struggle
to find jobs as the unemployment
rate soars. What's worse is that
there are countries much poorer
than Egypt.
This poverty plagues me with
guilt and a million questions as I
continue in my very comfortable
lifestyle. Will randomly handing
some people a few pounds here
and there help at all? What do I do
when I've already got two packs of
gum and several tissue packs in my
purse? What about when I've
bought all the fruits I need from
the fruit seller on the street corner?
What do I do? What should I do?
