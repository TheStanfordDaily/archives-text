## Confronting the poverty gap in Cairo, Egypt 
### Fatima Wagdy 
As I walk the streets of Cairo
this summer, barefoot chil
dren begging me for a few
Egyptian pounds confront me.
Their mothers shower me with reli
gious pleas; they tell me that God
will bless me, that I will be reward
ed, that it's Ramadan. It's not as
though I haven't ever been asked to
spare some change on University
Avenue or in San Francisco; we've
all seen this. But these appeals are
different. The sheer number of poor
people in the street is saddening.
For every poor person who asks me
for money, I see several more just
lounging about on the ground.

The gap between the rich and
the poor is so blatantly obvious
here, as is the severity of the pover
ty. Day after day, I witness the scale
of the inequalities as I encounter
people trying to sell me a pack of
gum or a packet of tissues for just a
pound (literally less than 20 cents).
They are desperate to make a small
profit on the stash of cheap little tis
sue packets they managed to buy.
They aren't even trying to rip me
off; they just want to sell something
in the hopes that they will get
enough money to buy some food. I
guess these are people who will not
"succumb" to begging, but I can
sense they are extremely eager to
know what they can sell me to make
me part with just a few of the
pounds tucked tightly in my purse. I
can see the dirt on their faces, their
clothes and their feet. Many times, I

can see that their teeth have more
than rotted away.

It saddens me even more to
know that many people who are
much better off than those selling
tissues or begging on the street still
live in substandard conditions.
When the elevator in my apartment
building is broken, I am forced to
hop over a flat, dirty mattress that
blocks the path to the last flight of
stairs. Apparently this is where the
bawab, the doorman, sleeps, right
outside the apartment on the sec
ond floor.

Over 20 percent of the people in
this country are below the poverty
line, and over 30 percent are illiter
ate. And I know that many of the
people who are officially above the
poverty line struggle to survive on
