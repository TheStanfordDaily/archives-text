## They will not be forgotten 
### ETHAN KESSINGER '15 
After years of going to mid
night premieres for the
biggest movies of the
summer, there was no other
place my brother and I would be
for the last premiere of the Bat
man trilogy. The theater in Den
ver was packed with people I
knew, and everyone was excited.
This included many people who
were way too old to be dressing
up but did so anyway.
While the audience in my the
ater watched with bated breath
to see if Gotham would be saved,
hell was breaking loose in our
own city, just 20 minutes away.
A crazed gunman, who does
not deserve to be named on the
same page as his victims, entered
the Aurora Century 16 multiplex
and began a rampage. As the
movie continued to play, 12 inno
cent victims were killed and 59
others were wounded. These
people were neither in a bad
neighborhood nor in a city that is
a target for terrorist attacks. The
shooting, one of worst mass mur
ders in American history, rocked
all of America because it truly
could have happened anywhere.

This is not the first senseless
tragedy that Colorado has expe
rienced. In 1999, two students at
Columbine High School in Jef
ferson County forever changed
our world by bringing guns to
school and killing 13 people.
Their act has come to define our
generation. We were the first
generation whose parents had to
fear sending us to school, the first
generation that practiced lock
down drills for gun attacks, the
first generation to know that this
would never stop being a reality.
The July 20 movie shooting is
similar. Security will increase at
movie theaters, and many other

precautions will be taken. The
magical experience of escaping
our world for a few hours will for
ever be accompanied by at least a
little fear every time someone
comes back from the bathroom.

My city feels like an incredibly
big place, but this tragedy helped
remind me how connected we all
are. Gordon Cowden, a loving fa
ther, and Jessica Ghawi, an aspir
ing sports journalist and great
friend, were two fellow Col
oradans killed that night who had
profound impacts on my friends
and family. Inspiring stories have
come out in the past week that
shed light on the wonderful lives
all 12 victims lived. I see broken
hearts all over the city; it is diffi
cult to imagine that it will ever be
the same. In an opinion article
printed in the Denver Post, a
Colorado state senator tried to
answer the questions the entire
country is facing: what can we do
and how can we fight back?
"The answer is we love back,"
Michael Johnston wrote. "We
live back. We deepen our com
mitments to all the unnumbered
acts of kindness that make
America an unrendable fabric.
We respond by showing that we
will play harder, and longer. We
will serve more meals, play more
games, eat more food, listen to
more jazz, go to more movies,
give more hugs, and say more
'thank yous' and 'I love yous'
than ever before."

While words can bring some
comfort to those close to the vic
tims, we have a duty to those af
fected to act. The shooter legally
purchased four guns in the last 60
days, including an AR-15 assault
weapon. Additionally, he was
