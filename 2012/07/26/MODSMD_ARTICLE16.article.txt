## They will not be forgotten 
### ETHAN KESSINGER '15 
After years of going to mid
night premieres for the
biggest movies of the
summer, there was no other
place my brother and I would be
for the last premiere of the Bat
man trilogy. The theater in Den
ver was packed with people I
knew, and everyone was excited.
This included many people who
were way too old to be dressing
up but did so anyway.
While the audience in my the
ater watched with bated breath
to see if Gotham would be saved,
hell was breaking loose in our
own city, just 20 minutes away.
A crazed gunman, who does
not deserve to be named on the
same page as his victims, entered
the Aurora Century 16 multiplex
and began a rampage. As the
movie continued to play, 12 inno
cent victims were killed and 59
others were wounded. These
people were neither in a bad
neighborhood nor in a city that is
a target for terrorist attacks. The
shooting, one of worst mass mur
ders in American history, rocked
all of America because it truly
could have happened anywhere.

This is not the first senseless
tragedy that Colorado has expe
rienced. In 1999, two students at
Columbine High School in Jef
ferson County forever changed
our world by bringing guns to
school and killing 13 people.
Their act has come to define our
generation. We were the first
generation whose parents had to
fear sending us to school, the first
generation that practiced lock
down drills for gun attacks, the
first generation to know that this
would never stop being a reality.
The July 20 movie shooting is
similar. Security will increase at
movie theaters, and many other

precautions will be taken. The
magical experience of escaping
our world for a few hours will for
ever be accompanied by at least a
little fear every time someone
comes back from the bathroom.

My city feels like an incredibly
big place, but this tragedy helped
remind me how connected we all
are. Gordon Cowden, a loving fa
ther, and Jessica Ghawi, an aspir
ing sports journalist and great
friend, were two fellow Col
oradans killed that night who had
profound impacts on my friends
and family. Inspiring stories have
come out in the past week that
shed light on the wonderful lives
all 12 victims lived. I see broken
hearts all over the city; it is diffi
cult to imagine that it will ever be
the same. In an opinion article
printed in the Denver Post, a
Colorado state senator tried to
answer the questions the entire
country is facing: what can we do
and how can we fight back?
"The answer is we love back,"
Michael Johnston wrote. "We
live back. We deepen our com
mitments to all the unnumbered
acts of kindness that make
America an unrendable fabric.
We respond by showing that we
will play harder, and longer. We
will serve more meals, play more
games, eat more food, listen to
more jazz, go to more movies,
give more hugs, and say more
'thank yous' and 'I love yous'
than ever before."

While words can bring some
comfort to those close to the vic
tims, we have a duty to those af
fected to act. The shooter legally
purchased four guns in the last 60
days, including an AR-15 assault
weapon. Additionally, he was
able to obtain 6,000 rounds of
ammunition, a drum magazine
that could fire 50 to 60 rounds
per minute and military-grade
armor online without anyone
questioning it. It is unbelievable
that one can purchase these
items online without any back
ground checks; it is even more
unbelievable that this quantity of
purchase happened so frequent
ly and that it went unquestioned.
Gun lobbies, including the
National Rifle Association
(NRA), proclaim that the Sec
ond Amendment allows for citi
zens to have weapons to shoot 71
people in two minutes. In 2008,
the NRA spent $lO million to
make sure that there is the least
bit of regulation possible on all
gun sales. The NRA is right in
saying that the Constitution al
lows citizens to bear arms, but
there is a big difference between
guns that are used for hunting
and protection and military
grade weapons with extended
magazines that are only used for
mass murder.

In the wake of this shooting, it
is up to Americans to demand a
change to the status quo. This

starts with reauthorizing the
1994 Federal Assault Weapons
Ban and continues with outlaw
ing online purchases of ammuni
tion and body armor without
proper background checks.
These restrictions may not have
prevented the movie massacre in
Aurora, but they are still the
right changes to implement. Gun
lobbyists in the next election
may target politicians who sup
port these modest regulations,
but I hope that supporting poli
cies that would save lives is more
important to them than winning
an election.
Colorado and the entire Unit
ed States of America mourn for
the families and friends of 12
wonderful people who were
killed for going to a movie:
Jonathan Blunk, 26; A.J. Boik,
18; Jesse Childress, 29; Gordon
Cowden, 51; Jessica Ghawi, 24;
John Larimer, 27; Matt Mc-
Quinn, 27; Micayla Medek, 23;
Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6;
Alex Sullivan, 27; Alex Teves,
24; and Rebecca Wingo, 32. For
those looking to contribute, Col
orado Gov. John Flickenlooper,
in partnership with the Commu
nity First Foundation, estab
lished the Aurora Victim Relief
Fund, which is now taking dona
tions at www.givingfirst.org.
