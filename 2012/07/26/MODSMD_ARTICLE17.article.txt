## MAD DOG IN THE HOUSE Former Stanford power forward Mark Madsen makes his return to the Farm as assistant coach 
### DAVID ENG DAILY INTERN 
A man walks into a
restaurant. The restau
rant is just another
landmark enduring
the frigid Minnesota winter. The
man, a car-drive away from his
Minneapolis home, has recently
decided to return to his under
graduate alma mater for business
school. He's rather plainly
clothed, apart from a cardinal
red cap emblazoned with a varsi
ty letter S.
Another man steps into the
restaurant. This one, Mike
Schrage, is a five-hour plane fight
from the prestigious Bay Area in
stitution where he works. He's in
the town on recruiting business
Schrage is an assistant coach
for the Stanford men's basketball
team.

It was then only by coinci
dence that Schrage crossed paths
with the man in the cap. He had
already seen the teenage talent
he traveled thousands of miles to
scout. But he couldn't help but
also recruit the man in the cap
Mark Madsen.

Nearly two and a half years
after the chance encounter, the
former Cardinal power forward
Madsen, now 36, plans to work
alongside Schrage on Stanford's
coaching staff.
"I had other options," said
Madsen, referring to a potential
career in business after having
earned his MBA from Stanford
this past June. "But, really, it was
a no-brainer. I get to coach at

Stanford, I get to learn under
[head] coach Johnny Dawkins,
and I get to be around these great
players. Okay. Check the box.
I'm in."

Returning to coach college
basketball may have ultimately
been a "no-brainer" for Madsen,
but he hasn't felt so resolute since
his days as a student-athlete. As a
graduating senior with a degree
in economics from Stanford in
2000, the two-time All-American
had been set on returning to
coach college basketball after a
professional career.
'"They Call Me Coach' [by
John Wooden]," Madsen said. "I
read it in college, and I read it in
high school too. I loved the book.
In the back of my mind, I thought
I wanted to be a basketball coach
in college."

However, ambivalence has
characterized the better half of
the past two years. Since retiring
from professional basketball in
2009 a nine-year career which
included two championships with
the three-peat Lakers Madsen
had seriously considered coach
ing at the junior college and even
high-school levels, which were
more "obscure" and required less
traveling.
In the end, it was not his exist
ing ties to Stanford but rather his
newly formed ones that proved to
be the determining factor.
"Over the past two years, basi
cally, the relationship between
coach Dawkins and me has flow
ered," Madsen said. "My rela
tionship with the program has
continued to grow and build."

Last summer, Dawkins invited
Madsen to join the team on an 11-
day exhibition circuit to Spain,
only the Cardinal's second tour in
the past decade.
"I think it was on that trip that
I really just felt the passion for
the game, how much I love Stan
ford and how much I love basket
ball," Madsen said.
Nearly two months into his
new role, Madsen anticipates his
responsibilities to be threefold: to
"push the guys," to share basket

ball insights and to foster a dually
fun and professional atmosphere.
Although the man known as
"Mad Dog" is remembered as a
player for his competitive energy
and aggressive play, he believes
he will not need to impart this
mentality to any of his players.
According to him, they already
have it.

"We have a lot of guys who are
already extremely aggressive,
who are already extremely in
tense when the game starts," he

said. "In terms of raw talent and
raw ability, I would take our guys
any day. Talent-wise, I would
take our guys. Heart-wise, I
would take our guys. For their
ability to compete, I'm taking
Stanford guys every day."

Under Dawkins, whom Mad
sen considers his coaching men
tor, the assistant coach hopes to
emphasize defense, rebounding
and communication. These three
