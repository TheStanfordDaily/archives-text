# PLUMER'S RUN
## Assistant coach PattiSue Plumer reflects on both her Stanford and Olympic experiences 
### KAREN FENG DAILY INTERN 
PattiSue Plumer 'B5 J.D.
'B9 isn't just the associ
ate cross country coach
and assistant track and
field coach; she's one of the most
accomplished long-distance run
ners in Stanford history.

A Stanford Hall of Fame
member, nine-time All-Ameri
can, two-time NCAA track and
field champion, former record
holder in the 5,000 meters and
two-time Olympian, Plumer
holds a wide range of experi
ences from collegiate meets to
elite international competi
tions.

Her experience is more rele
vant than ever this year as 37
Stanford-affiliated athletes
including five current student
athletes representing eight
countries head to London to
participate in the Games of the
XXX Olympiad.
Much like other Olympic
level athletes, Plumer is no
stranger to hardship. Through
out her professional career, she
experienced injuries and set
backs, such as a broken leg
after being hit by a taxi, several
bouts with pneumonia, food
poisoning at the Seoul
Olympics, pregnancy and a dog
bite at the 1991 World Champi
onships.

Yet she believes that her
challenges began far before she
went pro and that her expe
rience at Stanford was key to
her success.

"Having to manage being a
student and an athlete was a
challenge for sure. Especially
as a Stanford student on the
quarter system, all of the track
and field NCAAs were always
around finals," Plumer said. "It
just wears on you as a college
student; there are the chal
lenges of sleeping and eating
right. When you're a pro ath

lete, you have to deal with jet
lag and living in hotels ... but
being a Stanford student pre
pares you for that pretty well,
because they give you a skill set
that you can carry on to your
life as a professional athlete."
Despite the prestige of com
peting in the Olympics, Plumer
believes that her stressful expe
riences competing regularly at
the collegiate level as a Stan
ford student-athlete helped her
succeed on the elite circuit.

"My dream when I was six

years old was to make the
Olympic team," Plumer said.
"But if I had to choose, I could
n't not have taken up the Stan
ford team and winning two
NCAA titles. I competed regu
larly throughout all four years,
so I obviously thought it was
pretty demanding, regardless of
the fact that it wasn't as de
manding as the Olympics. As an
18- to 19-year-old, it was pretty
much all I could handle. It pre
pared me well for my post-colle
giate athletic experience."

Although the challenges of
being a college athlete were
somewhat different from those
of a professional athlete,
Plumer learned to use the fun
damental skill sets she had built
up as a Stanford student.
"When you're a profession
al athlete, you travel all over
the world and the competition
is much greater and the chal
lenges as an athlete are
greater," she said. "There are
some real changes.
"For example, as a distance
runner at Stanford, there's so
many big meets and you really
don't have an extended period
of training," Plumer added. "So
it's really difficult as an athlete
at Stanford to balance that, but
you don't have to think about
what you have to run. When
you go pro, you really have to
think about what races you
have to run and make good
choices. But I think you're pre
pared to compete and Stanford
prepares you well to compete at
this [professional] level."
Although Plumer will not be
in London this summer in order
to prepare for the upcoming
cross country season, she will
be watching the Games to keep
her eye on two current student
athletes.

"I'm definitely looking for
ward to the athletes that are
currently on our team like
Amaechi Morton, who I think
has a great chance of making
the finals. He's a great competi
tor and a lot of fun to watch,"
Plumer said. "Also Katerina
Stefanidi, who's competing for
Greece, I think has a great
chance of making the finals in
the pole vault. I'm a little jeal
ous of them, but it's just so ex
citing. Because they love track
in Europe, having it there is
going to be such a great, great
experience."

of a professional athlete,
Plumer learned to use the fun
damental skill sets she had built
up as a Stanford student.
"When you're a profession
al athlete, you travel all over
the world and the competition
is much greater and the chal
lenges as an athlete are
greater," she said. "There are
some real changes.
"For example, as a distance
runner at Stanford, there's so
many big meets and you really
don't have an extended period
of training," Plumer added. "So
it's really difficult as an athlete
at Stanford to balance that, but
you don't have to think about
what you have to run. When
you go pro, you really have to
think about what races you
have to run and make good
choices. But I think you're pre
pared to compete and Stanford
prepares you well to compete at
this [professional] level."
Although Plumer will not be
in London this summer in order
to prepare for the upcoming
cross country season, she will
be watching the Games to keep
her eye on two current student
athletes.

"I'm definitely looking for
ward to the athletes that are
currently on our team like
Amaechi Morton, who I think
has a great chance of making
the finals. He's a great competi
tor and a lot of fun to watch,"
Plumer said. "Also Katerina
Stefanidi, who's competing for
Greece, I think has a great
chance of making the finals in
the pole vault. I'm a little jeal
ous of them, but it's just so ex
citing. Because they love track
in Europe, having it there is
going to be such a great, great
experience."

Former Stanford track star and current assistant coach PattiSue
Plumer was an NCAA champion in the 5,000 meters and a two
time Olympian. She is currently in the Stanford Hall of Fame.
PattiSue Plumer 'B5 J.D.
'B9 isn't just the associ
ate cross country coach
and assistant track and
field coach; she's one of the most
accomplished long-distance run
ners in Stanford history.

A Stanford Hall of Fame
member, nine-time All-Ameri
can, two-time NCAA track and
field champion, former record
holder in the 5,000 meters and
two-time Olympian, Plumer
holds a wide range of experi
ences from collegiate meets to
elite international competi
tions.

Her experience is more rele
vant than ever this year as 37
Stanford-affiliated athletes
including five current student
athletes representing eight
countries head to London to
participate in the Games of the
XXX Olympiad.
Much like other Olympic
level athletes, Plumer is no
stranger to hardship. Through
out her professional career, she
experienced injuries and set
backs, such as a broken leg
after being hit by a taxi, several
bouts with pneumonia, food
poisoning at the Seoul
Olympics, pregnancy and a dog
bite at the 1991 World Champi
onships.

Yet she believes that her
challenges began far before she
went pro and that her expe
rience at Stanford was key to
her success.

"Having to manage being a
student and an athlete was a
challenge for sure. Especially
as a Stanford student on the
quarter system, all of the track
and field NCAAs were always
around finals," Plumer said. "It
just wears on you as a college
student; there are the chal
lenges of sleeping and eating
right. When you're a pro ath

lete, you have to deal with jet
lag and living in hotels ... but
being a Stanford student pre
pares you for that pretty well,
because they give you a skill set
that you can carry on to your
life as a professional athlete."
Despite the prestige of com
peting in the Olympics, Plumer
believes that her stressful expe
riences competing regularly at
the collegiate level as a Stan
ford student-athlete helped her
succeed on the elite circuit.

"My dream when I was six

years old was to make the
Olympic team," Plumer said.
"But if I had to choose, I could
n't not have taken up the Stan
ford team and winning two
NCAA titles. I competed regu
larly throughout all four years,
so I obviously thought it was
pretty demanding, regardless of
the fact that it wasn't as de
manding as the Olympics. As an
18- to 19-year-old, it was pretty
much all I could handle. It pre
pared me well for my post-colle
giate athletic experience."

Although the challenges of
being a college athlete were
somewhat different from those
of a professional athlete,
Plumer learned to use the fun
damental skill sets she had built
up as a Stanford student.
"When you're a profession
al athlete, you travel all over
the world and the competition
is much greater and the chal
lenges as an athlete are
greater," she said. "There are
some real changes.
"For example, as a distance
