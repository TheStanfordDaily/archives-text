# BARKLEY ISN'T LUCK
## 
### George Chen 
The last days of July are finally
here, which means that there
are three important things to
do: turn on the fan in your
room to full blast, watch "Breaking
Bad," and get caught up with the pre
season media hype surrounding col
lege football.
At the center of all the hype stands
USC senior quarterback Matt
Barkley, the new golden boy of college
football.

As much as I enjoy bashing any
thing USC-related, it's hard to deny
that Barkley is a special quarterback.
Barkley is carrying all the momentum
in the world into this upcoming season.
His monster 2011-2012 campaign con
cluded with 3,528 passing yards and a
69.1 percent completion rate. Just as
impressive was his 39:7 touchdown-to
interception ratio. Not only that, but
Barkley looked more deadly and sur

Barkley is the both the Heisman fa
vorite and projected first overall pick
of the 2013 NFL Draft.

wide receiving corps that includes
Robert Woods and Marqise Lee cer
tainly helps. The thought of USC hav
ing both the nation's best quarterback
and the best wide receiver is itself
enough to make me sick. That being
said, I'm still not buying the claim that
Barkley wouldn't be an elite college
quarterback without his talented tar
gets.

Barkley's fundamentals are very
polished to say the least. He reads
through his progressions like no
body's business, has a solid pocket
presence coupled with excellent foot
work and is especially dangerous
throwing off of play-action.

Quarterback coach Steve Clark
son, who mentored the likes of Ben
Roethlisberger and Matt Leinart,
dubbed Barkley a "cross between Joe
Montana and Tom Brady." Okay,
maybe I wouldn't go that far with the
praises, but at the end of the day, the
message is the same: Barkley is the real
deal.

By now you're probably wondering
if you're actually reading the Daily
