# BARKLEY ISN'T LUCK
## 
### George Chen 
The last days of July are finally
here, which means that there
are three important things to
do: turn on the fan in your
room to full blast, watch "Breaking
Bad," and get caught up with the pre
season media hype surrounding col
lege football.
At the center of all the hype stands
USC senior quarterback Matt
Barkley, the new golden boy of college
football.

As much as I enjoy bashing any
thing USC-related, it's hard to deny
that Barkley is a special quarterback.
Barkley is carrying all the momentum
in the world into this upcoming season.
His monster 2011-2012 campaign con
cluded with 3,528 passing yards and a
69.1 percent completion rate. Just as
impressive was his 39:7 touchdown-to
interception ratio. Not only that, but
Barkley looked more deadly and sur
gical with each game as the season pro
gressed. It's no wonder then that
Barkley is the both the Heisman fa
vorite and projected first overall pick
of the 2013 NFL Draft.

Yes, having one of the nation's best
wide receiving corps that includes
Robert Woods and Marqise Lee cer
tainly helps. The thought of USC hav
ing both the nation's best quarterback
and the best wide receiver is itself
enough to make me sick. That being
said, I'm still not buying the claim that
Barkley wouldn't be an elite college
quarterback without his talented tar
gets.

Barkley's fundamentals are very
polished to say the least. He reads
through his progressions like no
body's business, has a solid pocket
presence coupled with excellent foot
work and is especially dangerous
throwing off of play-action.

Quarterback coach Steve Clark
son, who mentored the likes of Ben
Roethlisberger and Matt Leinart,
dubbed Barkley a "cross between Joe
Montana and Tom Brady." Okay,
maybe I wouldn't go that far with the
praises, but at the end of the day, the
message is the same: Barkley is the real
deal.

By now you're probably wondering
if you're actually reading the Daily
Trojan instead of The Stanford
Daily, but rest assured, I'm not let
ting Barkley off the hook that easi
ly. The fact of the matter is despite
his undoubted talents, Barkley still
has a lot left to prove.

Andrew Luck was at the center
of the media's attention last season,
regardless of whether he wanted it.
Few college athletes in the country
were as heavily scrutinized as he
was. During the preseason, he was
in a similar position that Barkley is
in right now. Fresh off his an
nouncement to forgo millions of
dollars to finish school, Luck was
the media's college football darling.
But as the season went on, the
pressure cranked up. What was
considered extraordinaiy soon be
came expected. People started to
criticize his "bland" stats sheets
while completely ignoring more
important aspects of his play, like
his off-the-charts football IQ or un
derappreciated ability to throw ac
curately on the run.
Barkley remained well protect
ed under Luck's shadow. As the
top quarterback going into the
2012-2013 season, however,
Barkley can no longer avoid the at
tention. He'll be forced to face what
Luck had to go through, and while
Luck managed to block out the
pressure well, there's no guarantee
that Barkley will be able to do the
same.

And let's not forget that for the
past two seasons, USC was bowl
ineligible. I'm not saying that there
wasn't anything on the line for
Barkley last year, but having a BCS
bowl bid at stake adds a consider
able amount of pressure.
While Luck was putting on a
clinic at the Fiesta Bowl last year,
Barkley was sitting at home, more
than a month removed from his last
game. Sure, in that last game, the
Trojans torched UCLA 50-0.
Barkley could've shredded the
Bruins secondary if he was blind
folded, but it was rather anticlimac
tic, with no postseason implications
on the line.

This time around, Barkley will
have to bear the weight of USC's
national title hopes on his shoul
ders. If he manages to fulfill presea

son expectations and carry the Tro
jans into the national champi
onship, Barkley will in all likeli
hood end up facing the iron-curtain
defense of some SEC team a
formidable task that even Luck
didn't have to deal with. But USC's
tough schedule won't pave an easy
road for him by any means. His first
real test will, fittingly enough, come
against the Cardinal in a critical
week three matchup.

Make no mistake: USC will cer
tainly be favored to win that game.
Whether it's Brett Nottingham or
Josh Nunes starting for us, neither
one will be expected to go pass for
pass against Barkley. But I doubt
that the fearsome linebacker duo of
Shayne Skov and Chase Thomas
won't have anything to say before
the game is over.

That leaves with us with the final
inevitable comparison between
this upcoming season's Barkley
and last season's Luck.

They're certainly similar. Both
quarterbacks are dangerously effi
cient and rarely make costly mis
takes. Barkley had flashes of bril
liance last season, including his
four-touchdown performance
against Oregon, that were compa
rable to Luck's level of play. The
one knock against Barkley is his
arm strength, which interestingly
enough was the same criticism that
Phil Simms directed at Luck last
year before Luck completely put
that comment to shame by throw
ing a 70-yard bomb at Stanford's
pro day.

But last season's Luck is still on a
completely different level. Luck had
absolute control of the offense on
every down even if he wasn't
passing by calling his own plays
and audibles at the line. And Luck
took all of the pressure in stride.
Even when USC fans were prema
turely celebrating his late fourth
quarter interception in the epic
triple-overtime game last year, he
coolly and methodically led his of
fense on the next drive to tie up the
score. That's what made Luck a truly
once-in-a-generation quarterback.
I'm not saying that Barkley
can't reach that level, but it'll be a
challenging task even with his tal
ents. And if Lane Kiffin doesn't
start trusting him more with the
playbook, I don't know if it will
happen.
Is Matt Barkley the best quar
terback in college football going
into this season? Yes.

Will he put up numbers similar
to, if not better, than his stats last
year? I don't see why not.
But can he play at an unprece
dented level in the face of constant
pressure and scrutiny the level
that defined Luck's quarterbacking
abilities? I'm not quite sold on that
one just yet.

George Chen thinks that saying Matt
Barkley is almost as good as Andrew
Luck is the same as saying the Daily
Trojan is almost as good as The Stan
ford Daily. Let him know what you
