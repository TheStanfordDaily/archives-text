## RESEARCH New research may help eradicate HIV Professor Wender pushes bounds of HIV research 
### KYLIE JUE DAILY INTERN 
Stanford Chemistry Professor
Paul Wender partnered with
UCLA Professor Jerry Zack to
publish their most recent break
through toward eradicating the
HIV virus: the synthesis of a set of
compounds that successfully tack
le the latent, or dormant, virus for
the first time.

The research, published in the
July 15 issue of Nature Chemistry,
discusses the creation of synthetic
compounds, or bryologs, that can
more effectively activate the dor
mant HIV virus. Currently, an
AIDS patient undergoing highly
active antiretroviral therapy

(HAART) can reduce the active
virus to undetectable levels, but
the latent virus remains hidden in
certain cells.

"And the current therapeutics
cannot touch that [latent] virus,"
said Jerry Zack, co-director of the
UCLA AIDS Center. "But if the
individual goes off the medica
tions, this latent [virus] rekindles
infection, and the disease pro
gresses again."
There are many HIV drugs on
the market now, but Wender be
lieves that the key to eradicating
AIDS is actually in the latent
virus. Current antiretrovirals can
target only the active virus, and it
is the latent virus that is the source
of continuing infection. If it is
flushed out of the system through
bryologs, the rest of the virus can
be taken care of with medication
