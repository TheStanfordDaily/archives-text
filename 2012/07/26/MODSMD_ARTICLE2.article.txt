## RESEARCH New research may help eradicate HIV Professor Wender pushes bounds of HIV research 
### KYLIE JUE DAILY INTERN 
Stanford Chemistry Professor
Paul Wender partnered with
UCLA Professor Jerry Zack to
publish their most recent break
through toward eradicating the
HIV virus: the synthesis of a set of
compounds that successfully tack
le the latent, or dormant, virus for
the first time.

The research, published in the
July 15 issue of Nature Chemistry,
discusses the creation of synthetic
compounds, or bryologs, that can
more effectively activate the dor
mant HIV virus. Currently, an
AIDS patient undergoing highly
active antiretroviral therapy

(HAART) can reduce the active
virus to undetectable levels, but
the latent virus remains hidden in
certain cells.

"And the current therapeutics
cannot touch that [latent] virus,"
said Jerry Zack, co-director of the
UCLA AIDS Center. "But if the
individual goes off the medica
tions, this latent [virus] rekindles
infection, and the disease pro
gresses again."
There are many HIV drugs on
the market now, but Wender be
lieves that the key to eradicating
AIDS is actually in the latent
virus. Current antiretrovirals can
target only the active virus, and it
is the latent virus that is the source
of continuing infection. If it is
flushed out of the system through
bryologs, the rest of the virus can
be taken care of with medication
we have today.
In fact, the molecule that acti
vates the ever-important latent
virus has been a natural remedy
for a long time. Healers in West
ern Samoa used the bark of the
mamala tree to make tea to cure
hepatitis. It turns out that the bark
is rich in a molecule called pros
tratin, which can induce the ex
pression of the normally dormant
HIV virus. Antiretroviral drugs
can then be used to treat the pa
tient.

Wender's research led to a syn
thesis of bryologs, synthetic com
pounds with a similar structure to
prostratin molecules, which can
activate the dormant HIV virus

much more cheaply and effective
ly. He is enthusiastic about the po
tential application of his new com
pound to the HIV virus.
"[Prostratin] is the lead clinical
candidate for targeting the latent
virus," he said. "We report [new
synthetic] compounds that are
1,000-fold better [at activating la
tent HIV] than prostratin."
That is not to say that a perma
nent cure for AIDS can be expect
ed in the near future. Much more
work remains before Wender's
research can be applied to AIDS
patients. The next stage for bry
olog research will include in vivo
studies (which occur in living or
ganisms) and preclinical testing.
That will pose a new set of chal
lenges for researchers.
"What's coming down the road
is a challenge to develop in vivo
methods to test the drugs... in a
model that isn't in people since it

could be harmful," Zack said.
"You can't infect mice with HIV,
but if you humanize them, you can
infect the human cells with HIV,
and you can test the drugs on
that."

Both scientists emphasized
that their bryolog research still
has a long way to go before it can
be considered a practical solution
to AIDS. But it has given some
hope for the permanent eradica
tion of HIV.

"Since the story broke, I've
been flooded with emails, and
they're pretty remarkable," Wen
der said. These people are .. .
sharing with me that our article,
our research, brought them a ray
of hope ... this is what keeps me
up late at night and gets me up
every morning."
