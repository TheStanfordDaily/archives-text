# LEARNING FROM PSU

In light of the recent child sex
ual abuse scandal at Penn
State, there are two reactions
that come to my mind: I have
no reason to believe that any
thing like the abuse committed by
Jerry Sandusky is currently taking
place within Stanford's athletic pro
gram, and I also have no reason to
believe the Farm is completely im
mune from such atrocities.

Earlier this week, the sports
world was sent reeling by the
NCAA's sanctions on Penn State.
It's hard to imagine being an alum
nus of a school that won't be al
lowed to go to a bowl game or even
field a full team for four years, and
with the Nittany Lions unable to ap
pear on TV either, that team is
going to be practically impossible to
follow.

But it's even harder to imagine
that those sanctions would be
prompted by atrocities at State Col
lege, Penn., home to a school that
was, as recently as a year ago, be
lieved to have one of the last "clean"
athletic programs in the country.
Last June, the Wall Street Journal
reported that only four major-con
ference schools Penn State,
Boston College, Northwestern and,
yes, Stanford had never received
sanctions from the NCAA for a
major rules violation. Now, after at
least 15 years of abuse by Sandusky,
that distinction is a lot harder to take
pride in.

What we do know for sure is that
this scandal is going to change the
way we look at college sports, on the
Farm and elsewhere. Take this ex
ample: just over two months ago, I
wrote that Stanford needed a foot
ball coach or athletic director who
would stick around for the long haul
and become the face of the Cardinal
athletic program. Flow does that
thought seem now, after the NCAA
concluded that an overwhelming

"hero-worship" of longtime head
coach Joe Paterno was at the heart
of the Penn State scandal?
It would be fair to say that An
drew Luck inspired some "hero
worship" at Stanford, but not of the
same variety. Since athletes stick
around for only a few years, they
don't inspire the same intimidation
as generation-spanning figures like
Paterno.

Another way to gauge an athlet
ic program's ability to prevent ille
gal actions is through its compliance
office. In condemning Penn State's
administration, the Freeh Report
also noted that the athletic depart
ment's compliance office was "sig
nificantly understaffed," and the
Nittany Lions' website lists just one
dedicated compliance employee on
its athletic department directory.

Athletic compliance offices gener
ally focus on maintaining NCAA
and conference regulations, but the
Freeh Report implies that depart
mental offices still must "oversee in
stitutional compliance with laws,"
especially in the absence of a cen
tralized university entity to that end.
Similarly, even though the abuse
at Penn State is a much more severe
form of evil than any NCAA viola
tion that has occurred to date, the
cover-up that took place within that
university demonstrated a danger
ous dedication to winning, not all
that different than the fallout of
major recruiting infractions in the
past. Accordingly, the strength of a
compliance office can tell us a lot
about the likelihood of criminal ac
tions within an athletic department.
So how strong is ours?

Stanford does have a campus
wide Institutional Compliance Pro
gram, and there are five Depart
ment of Athletics employees devot
ed to compliance; according to their
respective online staff directories,
the average size of athletic compli
ance offices at other Pac-12 schools
is just slightly larger, at 5.5. Yet with
35 Cardinal varsity teams, there are
seven Stanford squads for each
compliance employee, which is the
largest such figure in the conference
and twice the average.
Still, keep in mind that Stanford
is the sole Pac-12 program without a
major NCAA violation and one of
only four schools in the conference
that has been clean since 2000.
USC, whose 11-employee compli
ance office is the largest in the Pac
-12, has been through its fair share of

trouble with the NCAA in recent
years, so larger compliance staffs
can also be an indicator of past mis
deeds bigger isn't always better.
But given that Stanford's com
pliance group larger than Penn
State's minimal staff, the Cardinal's
clean record seems to hint at the
staff's effectiveness at educating
coaches and players and casts doubt
on any suggestion of maj or adminis
trative negligence. Though we
should always be wary, the protec
tions seem to be in place here to pre
vent a cover-up of Penn State's pro
portions.

Joseph Bey da has tremendous faith
in the Stanford community and
hopes that no such evil will ever hap
pen at Stanford. Share your hope
