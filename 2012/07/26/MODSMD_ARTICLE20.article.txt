In light of the recent child sex
ual abuse scandal at Penn
State, there are two reactions
that come to my mind: I have
no reason to believe that any
thing like the abuse committed by
Jerry Sandusky is currently taking
place within Stanford's athletic pro
gram, and I also have no reason to
believe the Farm is completely im
mune from such atrocities.

Earlier this week, the sports
world was sent reeling by the
NCAA's sanctions on Penn State.
It's hard to imagine being an alum
nus of a school that won't be al
lowed to go to a bowl game or even
field a full team for four years, and
with the Nittany Lions unable to ap
pear on TV either, that team is
going to be practically impossible to
follow.

But it's even harder to imagine
that those sanctions would be
prompted by atrocities at State Col
lege, Penn., home to a school that
was, as recently as a year ago, be
lieved to have one of the last "clean"
athletic programs in the country.
Last June, the Wall Street Journal
reported that only four major-con
ference schools Penn State,
Boston College, Northwestern and,
yes, Stanford had never received
sanctions from the NCAA for a
major rules violation. Now, after at
least 15 years of abuse by Sandusky,
that distinction is a lot harder to take
pride in.

What we do know for sure is that
this scandal is going to change the
way we look at college sports, on the
Farm and elsewhere. Take this ex
ample: just over two months ago, I
wrote that Stanford needed a foot
ball coach or athletic director who
would stick around for the long haul
and become the face of the Cardinal
athletic program. Flow does that
thought seem now, after the NCAA
concluded that an overwhelming

"hero-worship" of longtime head
coach Joe Paterno was at the heart
of the Penn State scandal?
It would be fair to say that An
drew Luck inspired some "hero
worship" at Stanford, but not of the
