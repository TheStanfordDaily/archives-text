# VYING FOR GOLD
## STANFORD ATHLETES READY FOR LONDON 
### TOM TAYLOR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thirty-seven Stanford stu
dents and alumni will be compet
ing in the next couple of weeks in
the London 2012 Olympic
Games, leading to hopes of yet
another large medal haul for the
Cardinal. Here we present some
of the potential highlights for
Stanford fans, focusing on the
teams and athletes most likely to
be able to bring home gold based
on past success:

Women's rowing:
Elle Logan 'lO won gold in
the eights for Team USA at Bei
jing 2008 and finished second in
the pairs in the first two rounds

of the World Rowing Cup in
2012. She will compete in the
eights again at London 2012,
hoping to relive the success of
four years ago.
The women's eights competi
tion starts on July 29.

Men's swimming:
Markus Rogan 'O4 currently
holds the world record in the
200-meter backstroke for the
short course format (1:47.84)
and won silver for Austria in
both the 100 and 200 back
stroke at Athens in 2004. He
was originally set to retire in
2008 when he won gold at the
World Championships in Man
chester in the 200 backstroke,
but changed his plans to pursue
his medal hopes in the men's
200 individual medley and
4x200 freestyle relay. Rogan
will also have the honor of
being Austria's flag bearer in
London.

The preliminary heats of the
men's 200 individual medley
start on Aug. 1, and the 4x200
freestyle relay is slated to begin
on July 31.

Women's soccer:

Four former Cardinal play
ers will play in the Olympic
Games: goalkeeper Nicole
Barnhart 'O4, defender Rachel
Buehler 'O7, forward Kelley
O'Hara 'lO and defender/mid
fielder Ali Riley 'lO. Barnhart,
Buehler and O'Hara are all on
the No.l-ranked U.S. national
team and will be favorites to
win gold, as Team USA has
won the last two Olympic titles
and three out of the four ever

played. Barnhart may have to
sit on the sidelines for the ma
jority of the time like she did in
Beijing 2008, as fellow goal
keeper Hope Solo is the team's
regular starter at that position.
Riley, meanwhile, will be play

ing for New Zealand, which,
ranked No. 23 in the world, will
be considered an outsider.
The action began yesterday,
with New Zealand falling to
Great Britain 1-0 in the opening
game and the U.S. dismantling
France 4-2. Both teams will next
play on July 28, when New
Zealand will face Brazil and the
U.S. will face Colombia.
Women's volleyball:
The U.S. national team is
ranked No. 1 and sealed a hat
trick of titles in the annual World
Grand Prix at the beginning of
this month. Middle blocker
Foluke Akinradewo 'O9 and out
sider hitter Logan Tom 'O3
should have a great chance of
going one better than at Beijing
2008, where the U.S. won silver.
The women's volleyball tour
nament starts July 28, when the
U.S. will play against the Repub
lic of Korea.
Women's beach volleyball:
Kerri Walsh 'OO is perhaps
one of Stanford's most famous

current Olympians, having won
the gold for Team USA at both
Beijing 2008 and Athens 2004
with her teammate Misty May-
Treanor. Currently ranked No.
3 in the world behind the leading
Brazilian and Chinese teams,
Walsh's quest for a third straight
gold medal is far from guaran
teed. But given their achieve
ments so far, Walsh and May-
Treanor will be tough for any
duo to beat.
The beach volleyball tourna
ment beings on July 28.
Men's and women's water
polo:
In the men's competition, at
tackers Tony Azevedo 'O5 and
Peter Varellas 'O6 and defenders
Layne Beaubien '99 and Peter
Hudnut 'O3 walked away with sil
ver for the U.S. in 2008.
On the women's side, the re
sult was the same for attacker
Brenda Villa 'O3, defender Jessi
ca Steffens 'lO and the rest of the
U.S. team. Villa will be looking to

Twins Bob and Mike Bryan will
be competing in the men's doubles draw in London. The Bryan
brothers were the world No. 1
duo for nearly six years.

Stanford junior defender Melissa Seidemann, a three-time 50-goal
scorer, redshirted last season to prepare for the Olympics. The U.S.
women's water polo team will begin its play July 30 against Hungary.
add another medal to her collec
tion, which already consists of a sil
ver from Athens and a bronze
from Sydney in 2000. This year the
women are joined by junior center
Annika Dries, junior defender
Melissa Seidemann and freshman
to-be Maggie Steffens.
Both teams will be hoping to go
one better in London, but it may be
a tough task even to repeat the sil
ver medals of four years ago
against higher-ranked competi
tion.

The men's water polo tourna
ment begins on July 29, when the
U.S. will face Montenegro, and the
women's starts on July 30, with the
U.S. opening its tournament cam
paign against Hungary.
