# LONDON AT LAST
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Flying into the U.K. last
week, the capital lay
mostly hidden beneath a
bank of cloud and mist.
Occasional breaks in the
gray hinted at green fields and brick
houses, but nothing really out of the
ordinary. No sign that just a week
later, it would be host to one of the
world's biggest sports events: the
Summer Olympics.
Well, maybe just one sign. As
the plane started its final approach
I glimpsed a clever piece of garden
ing through the swirling clouds: five
large interlocking rings the
iconic logo of the Games cut
into a grassy field, as if the country
had been branded from above.

Once we touched down, more
and more clues appeared that
something was happening.
Throughout the terminal there
were signs and volunteers directing
members of the Olympic commu
nity, and beyond the airport British
flags and team jerseys began to
sprout up everywhere.
Having been in the U.S. for the
last year 1 had missed the buildup
to the Olympics. Most of all, I had
missed the long journey of the
Olympic flame through the U.K.,
seeing it only through photos post
ed on Facebook, but upon hitting
home soil I began my own little
torch relay. I passed from friend to
friend, first visiting Birmingham
where I spotted a handful members
of Team USA wandering down a
nondescript street and then
moving on to Oxford and Reading.
Then finally, a few days ago, 1 made
it to London proper.

When I wrote this I could actu
ally see ground zero, the Olympic
stadium, poking up above the sky
line on the north bank of the River
Thames from the window of a
friend's apartment in Greenwich;
lights from a dry run of the Open
ing Ceremony flickered in the
darkness. I had also just made my
first visit to one of the Olympic
venues, the Horse Guards Parade.
For the next couple of weeks I
will be based there, working as a
volunteer at the beach volleyball
tournament. I was lucky enough
to get an early behind-the-scenes
peek at the stadium that sits just
outside the gates of Buckingham
Palace. Unfortunately, I'm not re
ally allowed to go into the details
of the site yet, but having the
beach volleyball court and start
and finish line of the marathon
sandwiched between some of the
most famous and historic loca
tions in London makes for a pret
ty impressive venue. Another rea
son for tuning in, if Kerri Walsh
'OO potentially winning her third
straight gold medal wasn't
enough justification.
Elsewhere in the capital,
whether they want to be or not,
Londoners are face-to-face with
the Games wherever they go, from
the stadiums themselves to the ex
haustive TV and newspaper cover
age to both signs and advertise
ments filling up the available visu
al space.

Some of my friends have es
caped the madness, having run
away up north or even across the
English Channel to France. I can
understand why. With the moun
tain of tourists, it seems hard to be
lieve that the city won't be brought
to a standstill; on my way back from
Horse Guards Parade, just the nor

mal commuting rush packed the
train to bursting point.
My friends are clearly wrong,
though. We'll only have this mad
ness once. It seems next to impos
sible that anywhere else in the
U.K. will host another Olympic
Games in my lifetime. Being
crammed into a hot and stuffy
Tube train and suffering with long
travel delays won't be fun, but in a
few years' time, when my grand
kids ask where we were for the
Games, I'm not so sure the story of
how we ran away to find some
peace and solace will really en
thrall them.
The next two and a bit weeks
I can't quite believe the window
between the Opening and Closing
Ceremonies is just 17 days will
flash past in a blur of athletic activ
ity, and pretty soon, after the Para
lympic Games, London and the
U.K. will return to normal. In fact,
the biggest local soccer league, the
English Premiership, kicks off in
just over three weeks, so the
Games are under pressure to finish
on time.

It is going to be a little crazy to
squeeze everything in, and amid
the summer heat and the bustle of
tourists it will surely be a little
cramped and uncomfortable. But
you don't often get a chance to be
part of history. Bring it on.

Tom Taylor loves his homeland so
much that he might not be coming
back. Make sure he does return at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
