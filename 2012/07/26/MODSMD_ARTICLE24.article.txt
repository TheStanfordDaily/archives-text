# Coach Shaw, Stanford players speak at Pac-12 football media day
## 
### 
Coach David Shaw, senior
running back Stepfan Taylor and
senior outside linebacker Chase
Thomas represented Stanford at
the Pac-12 football media day in

Los Angeles on Tuesday.
The media opened up the
press conference by asking Shaw
to give an update on senior inside
linebacker Shayne Skov's reha
bilitation.

"He's not ready to play a foot
ball game yet, but he's physically
ready to do everything in the
weight room and everything we
will ask him to do," Shaw said.
"He won't play the first game, but
come that game against Duke, we
believe he will be there."

The one question directed to
Taylor was concerned with the
possibility of feeling increased
pressure for the upcoming sea
son.

"I don't feel the pressure. I feel
we have to just go out there and
play our best game, every game,"
Taylor responded.

Thomas was asked how he felt
about Stanford's defensive front
seven.

"I think the front seven are as
good as anybody in the nation,"
said Thomas. "We have all the
linebackers returning and Shayne
Skov. ... It helps out with the
same defense installed over the
last three years, so it lets us play

faster, more aggressively, and
overall it makes us a better de
fense."
The annual conference media
poll picked the Cardinal to finish
second in the Pac-12 North Divi
sion, the same place that Stanford
finished in last season. Oregon
was the predicted champion of
the North Division and collected
732 points to edge out Stanford's
533.

The conference media poll,
however, has often been inaccu
rate in projecting Stanford's per
formance. Despite being picked
to finish eighth in the 1999-2000
season, the Cardinal wound up
playing in the Rose Bowl.
In the Pac-12 South Division,
USC came in first in the poll
standings. The Trojans were also
picked to win the Pac-12 Champi
onship, earning 102 of the 123
total votes.
