Those who've never watched "Suits," the hour
long legal drama on USA Network, can
expect a fast pace and snappy office banter.
Main character Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) is a
successful attorney known for operating "in the
gray," using tactics of questionable legality. Harvey's
decision to hire his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J.
Adams) is a perfect example. Prior to working at
Pearson Hardman, Mike, who has a photographic
memory, took the LSAT for students looking to get
into Harvard Law School.
Season one dealt primarily with Mike, his dubi
ous background, his on-and-off relationship with
Rachel the paralegal (Meghan Markle) and his job as
an associate without a legitimate college degree
(from any school, not just Harvard). He's the nice
guy caught in a bad situation who makes the deci
sion to go from shabby apartments and marijuana to

gleaming New York skyscrapers and 50th-floor
offices. Each episode focused on one specific lawsuit
where Harvey used some sort of clever ruse to crack
the case a similar format to shows like "House
M.D."

Season two, on the other hand, is more intrigu
ing for the less legally inclined. Macht and Adams
still toss around words like pro bono, subpoena and
affidavit, but each episode is less formulaic and
delves deeper into the complexities of each character.
Harvey was the slick lawyer dude with the tough

exterior, but we learn that there's more to him than
his $2,000 suit. Admittedly, his characterization isn't
really breaking any stereotypes, but it's certainly
more exciting to watch.
Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), a junior partner and
Harvey's rival at the firm, is per
haps the most human of all the
characters. He and Harvey started
at the firm as equals, but Harvey
received the promotion both had
been gunning for. Louis' snarky

humor which is the most enter
taining of all the characters' and
contentious attitude are the results
of feeling unappreciated and
unwanted, which is why he's espe
cially susceptible to office bribery.
The second season begins
with Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres),

Co-founder and managing partner
of the firm, discovering Mike's
secret. After witnessing a surprising
display of compassion from
Harvey, Jessica chooses not to fire
either of them. As the season pro
gresses, a long story arc develops:
Harvey is accused of burying evi
dence, and the firm comes under
fire.
The character of Donna
Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) under
goes the greatest transformation in
the most recent few episodes. In
season one, she was Harvey's
amusing and self-assured secretary.
Now we see her playing a larger,
and possibly detrimental, role at
the firm. Episode four ends with a
shot of Donna's date stamp on the
evidence Harvey had been accused
of burying.
The preview for the next
episode features a confrontation
between the firm's lawyer and
Donna:
"Where do you see yourself in
five years?" asks the firm's lawyer.
"Well, actually— "
"Because where I see you is in
jail."
The intricacies of each charac

ter are really what give the show
depth and intrigue. Season one
was engaging, but if the case-by
case format continues, "Suits" can
easily fall into a bland routine. If
the show's creator, Aaron Korsh,
wants to avoid stagnation, we need
to see more. The plotlines need

complexity, and characters' back
stories need to influence the pro
gression of the story. Viewers
won't settle for another run-of
the-mill legal drama.
When a consultant comes to
see the associates, Louis tells them,
"I want you to convince this

woman that Pearson Hardman
makes you shit rainbows." If the
structure of season two is main
tained, that should be the general
consensus.
