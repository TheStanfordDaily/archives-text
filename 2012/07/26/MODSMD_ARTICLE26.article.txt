Those who've never watched "Suits," the hour
long legal drama on USA Network, can
expect a fast pace and snappy office banter.
Main character Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) is a
successful attorney known for operating "in the
gray," using tactics of questionable legality. Harvey's
decision to hire his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J.
Adams) is a perfect example. Prior to working at
Pearson Hardman, Mike, who has a photographic
memory, took the LSAT for students looking to get
into Harvard Law School.
Season one dealt primarily with Mike, his dubi
ous background, his on-and-off relationship with
Rachel the paralegal (Meghan Markle) and his job as
an associate without a legitimate college degree
(from any school, not just Harvard). He's the nice
guy caught in a bad situation who makes the deci
sion to go from shabby apartments and marijuana to

gleaming New York skyscrapers and 50th-floor
offices. Each episode focused on one specific lawsuit
where Harvey used some sort of clever ruse to crack
the case a similar format to shows like "House
M.D."

Season two, on the other hand, is more intrigu
ing for the less legally inclined. Macht and Adams
still toss around words like pro bono, subpoena and
affidavit, but each episode is less formulaic and
delves deeper into the complexities of each character.
Harvey was the slick lawyer dude with the tough

exterior, but we learn that there's more to him than
his $2,000 suit. Admittedly, his characterization isn't
really breaking any stereotypes, but it's certainly
more exciting to watch.
