## PASSION PIT Sophomore success 'Gossamer' tackles heartbreak, anxiety

To all those who have been
patiently waiting since
2009, Passion Pit's
"Manners" was a faulty compass.
The album promised youthful,
hedonistic abandon, but
"Gossamer" instead addresses
fear, anxiety and drug abuse, even
enlisting the help of a minor
chord or two. The band's sopho
more effort still evokes streamers
and confetti, but now it's the
morning after, and your head is
pounding. Brimming with point
ed self-awareness, "Gossamer" is
the perfect album to both dance
to and sulk to.
This looking-glass approach
leads to some formidable success
es near the beginning of the
record. "I'll Be Alright" is
Gossamer's first stick of dyna
mite, bursting with energy and a
wide-sweeping assortment of
musical textures. Between tin
kling bells and sugary female
backup vocals, "Carried Away"
embodies the dreamy power pop

Passion Pit is known for. "Let's
just keep pretending to befriends,"
lead man Michael Angelakos sug
gests over the 'Bos synth line, but
he says this in a playful manner
rather than a mean one.

"Constant Conversations"
stands out as the album's most
accomplished and complex piece.
On "Conversations," Angelakos
is unlikable and selfish, yet spec
tacularly real. The R&B chords
and warm bass line capture the
intimacy of a late-night-lovers'
spat so well that listening almost
feels intrusive, but the song is so
catchy you can almost hear the
festival audiences barging in at
the chorus.
For the most part,
"Gossamer's" introspective
endeavor is thoughtful and well
executed "Cry Like a Ghost"
revisits the topic of addiction,
while "Love Is Greed" and "It's

Not My Fault, I'm Happy" are
heartbreaking but sweet-sound
ing songs, their titles belying the
lyrical intricacy within.
However, Passion Pit's music
walks the line between exuber
ance and caricature, and when
"Gossamer" teeters off it falls
straight into self-mockery.

"Mirrored Sea" attempts to com
pensate for its blandness with vol
ume and urgency; the chorus is
doubled by the keys but still
remains forgettable. "On My
Way" suffers a similar fate, its
grandiose instrumentation remi
niscent of a Showtime Christmas
movie. Although even the weak

est tracks contain darling details,
such as the 8-bit progression on
"Mirrored Sea," the songs remain
too campy for comfort.
The album closes with the
delicate "Where We Belong,"
peeling away some of the musical
wrapping to reveal a deeply pri
vate story of a suicide attempt.

The bubbly synth fades out before
the verse, presenting an "xx"-style
minimalism unexpected from a
band known for exaggeration.
A simple, quiet rebirth is just
the way for Passion Pit to end
"Gossamer" and embark on their
next musical journey. With such
a brutally honest second album

under its belt, Passion Pit
deserves to pat itself on the back,
pack up its synthesizers and move
forward, keeping us guessing for
another three years.
