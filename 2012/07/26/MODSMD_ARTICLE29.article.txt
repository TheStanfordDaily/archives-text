## THE
						99 PERCENT Stanford Summer Theater roots for the middle-class man in Sam Shepard's 'Curse of the Starving Class' 
### â€“ margaret LIN contact margaret: margaretglin@gmail. com 
On the surface, "Curse of the
Starving Class," written by Pulitzer
Prize winner Sam Shepard, is the
story of an American family that slowly
deteriorates thanks to a fraudulent land
speculator who toys with their lives in the
countryside. However, the play also
addresses many deeper, modern issues, such
as poverty, overbearing corporations and
alcoholism.
The play is directed by Rush Rehm,
who also serves as a professor of drama at
Stanford. Consisting of only eight actors,
the talented Stanford Summer Theater cast
managed to pull off this play with only four
weeks of rehearsal, although they were noti
fied of their roles last year in the fall. The
play is held at the small but cozy Pigott
Theater; the set is quite impressive and not
put to waste, as almost every inch is used
during the play.
The main character, Wesley, played by
Max Sosna-Spear 'll M.A. 'l2, is one of the
most memorable roles in the entirety of the
play. At first, Wesley is determined to suc
ceed; he dresses well, speaks with conviction
and is eager about the years to come. In the
end, however, Wesley wears his father's
dirty old clothes, acts as if danger is con
stantly lurking around the corner and
expects nothing more than a bleak future.
It is easiest to spot Sosna-Spear's excel

lent characterization in the last act. Only he
and Wesley's mother, Ella (Courtney
Walsh), are left on the stage when they
begin to fearfully recall a story about a raven
that Wesley's father, Weston (Marty
Pistone), used to tell as a hopeful story
about never giving up. However, in the
scene, the story is twisted into a dark and
sinister tale about the total and complete
loss of hope.
In addition, Jessica Waldman 'l5 is
wonderful as Wesley's younger sister
Emma, a sweet but spunky Southern girl
who learns how cruel the real world is. The
play presents the challenge of developing
such a young character into a rebellious and
hard-hearted criminal in a short time, but
Waldman acts out the role beautifully and
poetically.
Whether you're searching for a dark
but-humorous play or a famous play
wright's work in these upcoming weeks,
"Curse of the Starving Class" will satisfy
your curiosity.
"Curse of the Starving Class" runs through
Aug. 12 with showings at Bp.m. Thursday -
Saturday and 2p.m. Sunday at Pigott
Theater.
