## Students react poorly to summer alcohol policy 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Several students and resident as
sistants (RAs) disagree with the
University's newest alcohol policy,
which bans the storage and con
sumption of hard alcohol during the
Summer Session, regardless of age.
Two administrators have confirmed
that there are no plans to implement
this policy during the academic
school year.

Despite administrators' claims
that the new policy will lead to a safer
environment for students to live in,
there is fear the policy is doing the
exact opposite.

Several RAs who spoke on the
condition of anonymity told The
Daily they believe that the new poli
cy is leading to the demise of Stan
ford's unofficial "open-door" policy,
in which house staff members en
courage students to leave their doors
open when drinking so staff mem
bers can check in from time to time.
This unofficial rule exists to foster a
greater sense of trust between stu
dents and staff members, resulting in
more honest conversations about
substance usage.

"It's a bad idea I've seen noth
ing but closed doors this summer,"
said one Summer Session RA in an
email. "It's unsafe (and exactly why
schools with harsh alcohol policies
have so many problems) and does
nothing to foster dorm community."
Despite these concerns, howev
er, Assistant Dean of Summer Ses
sion Jess Matthews stated that the
statistics relating hard liquor to inci
dents such as emergency-room
transports negate the effectiveness
of the open-door policy during the
shortened Summer Session.

"On the one hand, we very much
respect the open-door culture and
see how it can enable a safe drinking
environment," Matthews said. "On
the other hand, we know that at
Stanford, as well as at our peer insti
tutions, consumption of hard alcohol
is involved in almost 100 percent of
serious drinking incidents."
It is unclear, however, whether
Summer Session has had alcohol-re
lated problems in the past. Adminis
trators say they do not track alcohol
transport data during summer.
RAs have also expressed concern
about the negative effects that the
hard liquor policy appears to be hav
ing on the relationship between stu
dents and summer staff members.

"I think [the policy] is really detri
mental to the staff-resident relation
ship," said one Summer Session RA
who also serves on house staff during
the academic year. "Our residents
don't want to get to know us, which
sucks because I'm used to my fresh
men loving me."

In addition to the Stanford stu
dents and staff members who are on
campus this summer, this year's
Summer Session is home to 550 vis
iting students, said Matthews.
She said that many of these visi
tors are taking eight to 12 units and
are not familiar with how alcohol
and discipline policies work on cam
pus, despite living with Stanford stu
dents. She cited this intermingling of
students as part of the reason for the

new policy.
"Given the very short duration
of Summer Session and the pres
ence of hundreds of visiting stu
dents, we are not able to build the
kind of nuanced and carefully craft
ed consensual culture that prevails
during the academic year," said
Matthews. "So for this summer, we
chose the path of caution."
Many have questioned adminis
trators' decision to enforce the poli
cy among students over the legal
drinking age. The original email sent
out by Matthews stated that only
"beer and wine are permissible
under legal guidelines for 21+." The
consequences of violating the sum
mer's hard alcohol ban are applica
ble for all students, regardless of age.
"Regardless if a student is over or
under 21, drinking hard alcohol in
creases the risks inherent in alcohol
consumption, including blacking
out, and more severely, police cita
tions or ER transports," Matthews
said.

According to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Ralph Castro,
roughly 28 percent of alcohol-relat
ed emergency-room transports over
the last four years are for students 21
and older. In comparison, at any
given time, roughly 38 percent of the
student population is over the legal
drinking age.
Matthews was also quick to point
out that it wouldn't make sense if the
policy wasn't enforced for those over
the age of 21, and that failing to do so
would present the idea that Stanford
condones underage drinking.
"It is important to remember that
students who consume alcohol
under the age of 21 are breaking the
law, as Stanford follows federal
laws," said Matthews. "A policy that
excluded 21+ would give the mes
sage that we are accepting of under
age students violating the legal
drinking age."

Assistant Dean Matthews con
firmed that the policy has been en
forced at least once this summer, but
Summer Session RAs do not appear
to be the ones doing the enforcing.

"I've heard of house directors
breaking up parties because of alco
hol, but not RAs doing it," said one
RA. "We dealt with alcohol differ
ently [during the school year], and
that's what I signed up for. And
every RA I've talked to is uncom
fortable with the new policy."
