Admit it: when you think
of Japanese street style,
the first thing that pops
into your head are the Harajuku
girls. Popularized in America
during Gwen Stefani's stint as a
solo artist, Harajuku, a trendy
shopping neighborhood in Japan,
became synonymous with quirky
youth fashion think elaborate
maid outfits, wigs and false eye
lashes.
Or so I thought. I'm intern
ing in Tokyo this summer as part
of the Bing Overseas Study
Program. The first chance I got, I
journeyed to Harajuku to see the
world-famous street fashion.
Turns out, the most ostentatious
of the Harajuku girls seem to
have moved on, leaving several
disappointed tourists in their
wake.
I admit, during my time in
Japan I've seen some quirky fash

ion, but in less expected places
like at a summer festival or while
visiting temples. But outside of

the more outlandish fashion
choices, Japanese style is fascinat
ing.
Although I was expecting
some style shock before I came to
Japan everyone always goes on
about how well put-together peo
ple are here there were still
plenty of surprises. For example, I
though Toms, which have
exploded in popularity in the US
recently, would at least have
made a dent in Japan. Wrong,
but Minnetonka moccasins are
huge here.
Also, as someone who comes
from a place where jeans are the
clothing of choice for most peo
ple daily, I found myself intrigued
by the skirts here, which many
women wear daily. The maxi skirt
is big with teenagers, often done

in pastel pleats or layers of tulle,
paired with heels and a jean jack
et. Flared mid-length skirts run
prevalent among office workers
a popular outfit is said skirt,
simple black top, and heels. And
the mini skirt is everywhere,
sometimes shockingly short (it is
a style taboo to show much of
your shoulders or chest in Japan,
but skirts can be as short as physi
cally possible).

But the accessories are what
really make Japanese style so
unique. Take socks, for example.

In America, socks and tights are
often an afterthought: I, for
instance, tend to favor any socks
that can be hidden in a boot shaft
to hide the fact that I think
matching socks are only for spe
cial occasions. Women in Japan
take the opposite tack socks,
like bags, shoes and belts, are key
parts of an outfit. Flats are often
pared with lacy, colorful liners
that play up the shape of the
shoe. Heels and Mary Janes (yes,
women here are still wearing
Mary Janes) go with pale socks
that feature lacy trim around the
ankle, and the more daring girls
wear mini-skirts with knee-high
stockings and heels.
Japanese women don't stop at
accessorizing their outfits they
accessorize their bags and phones
as well. While in the U.S., cell
phone charms are mostly relegat
ed to middle school girls, such
trinkets are übiquitous in Japan.
Stores and souvenir shops have a
huge collection of cell phone
charms, and even the most aus
tere-looking businessmen deco
rate their smartphones.
On the male side, fashion
ranges from the standard "work
er" look a navy suit to
something more fashionable and
boy-band inspired: think skinny
pants, layered shirts, hair teased
with gel and shoes with a thick
sole for extra height.
What I love most about the
style here is the fact that everyone
always seems at their most put
together every time you see them.
Crowded subway rides become
much more bearable when there
are so many interesting looks to
see. I know I'll miss the creativity
when I am back in lecture halls,
back to the usual undergraduate
sea of jeans and sweatpants.
