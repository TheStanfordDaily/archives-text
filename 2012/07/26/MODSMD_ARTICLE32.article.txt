## Perspectives on violence in 'THE DARK KNIGHT RISES' SASH ANGELES 
### â€“ sasha ARIJANTO contact sasha: sasha.arijanto@stanford. edu 
With the very real death of
"The Dark Knight" star
Heath Ledger, the
Batman movie franchise was des
tined to find itself at the center of
speculation and controversy link
ing fictional content to real life
consequences. Unfortunately for
the films and for the victims of a
shooting in Aurora, Colo., the line
between fantasy and reality blurred
again as a gunman opened fire on
a crowded theater of buzzing fans
at a midnight screening of the
third and final installment of the
Nolan Batman trilogy, "The Dark
Knight Rises."
Sources report that gunman
James Holmes told authorities he
"was the Joker," and the suspect
"had died his hair like the Joker,"
the fictional villain of the trilogy's
second piece. With a military-style
AR-15 assault rife, a shotgun and
two handguns, the article reports,
Holmes committed the massacre
after months of planning in a fash
ion not dissimilar to the Joker's
senseless assaults on Gotham City.
The media has pounced on
the shooting from all angles, with

full pages
dedicated to
the event,
the victims
and the
effect on
"The Dark

Knight Rises." Media voices have
been quick to defend the film, a
violent action movie based on a
comic book, against blame for
having influenced or caused this
senseless massacre. And though in
the end, the film truly can't be
blamed for recent events, the rela
tionship between the shooting and
the violence depicted in the film
certainly needs to be examined.
The film takes a hard-line
stance against violence and orga
nized crime, particularly weapons
dealing and acts of terrorism. But
as the principal character straddles
his roles of hero and vigilante
criminal, and as virtually all media
consumers continually glorify the
Joker, perhaps the movie's anti
violence message falls on deaf ears.
The films' overarching attitude
against crime and violence recedes
in the frames of cinematographi

cally grand visuals.
What's more and this is no
fault of the audience the movie
takes an often-ambivalent
approach to portraying violence.
In this third installment, merce
naries (the bad guys) wear cos
tumes reminiscent of media por
trayals of Middle Eastern militants;
they don khaki cargo pants and
military vests, strap huge bullets to
themselves and tote chunky
weaponry suitable for guerillas.
They are even swathed in scarves
with scruff and suntanned skin as
if they have been roughing it in a
desert, despite the snowy setting of

the film and the mercenaries'
access to resources. Google "Iraqi
militant" and you'll basically find
the Gotham mercenary, only with
a pulled-down headscarf.
Watching this, one cannot help
but consider the thinly veiled asso
ciation of these bad guys with
depictions of Middle Eastern
"rebels," the American media ver
sion of comic-book bad guys.
By contrast, the police officers
wear navy caps and uniforms, pris
tine and complete despite having
lived in a cave for three months.
Not a scratch or stain mars the
look of the American "hero." They

courageously wield civilized pistols
against brute force.
The film may not be outward
ly pro-violence or racist, but lean
ing on these stereotypes to conjure
a sense of fear and antagonism
towards these "foreign" mercenar
ies invading Gotham City is not
only simplistic profiling, but poor
storytelling. Even out of the con
text of the violent shooting, these
stereotypical tropes of good and
evil contribute to a subtle form of
ideologizing not unlike the racist

and sexist ideas Disney princess
movies have suffered criticism for.

But beyond even this per
haps esoteric reading of the film,
and regardless of my personal
opinion of the movie, even an
uncritical viewer will notice the
militarization of Gotham City
a central tenet of the plot as
an all-too-real parallel to events
that have occurred in America
and American-occupied states,
though this is perhaps out of the
mind of most of the film's audi
ence. Even if Batman saves the
day and the film's point is to
stamp out the evils that cause

these wars, the victory the audi
ence savors is not the moment a
mayor reveals an honorary statue
or bestows a military medal.
They cheer and clap when big
guns fire and missiles explode
like Fourth-of-luly fireworks and
heat-seeking missiles in enemy
territory. Violence that plays on
stereotypes and big bangs is easi
er to digest than a lofty moral
message against that violence that
entertains so engagingly.
The fact that we as a society
are entertained by watching
events of suffering speaks volumes
about the state of our country.

But good art, like Nolan's films,
holds a mirror up to nature, and
unfortunately our nature is one
that has grown increasingly
obsessed with violence.
I saw "Rises" at 12:15 a.m.
Friday and didn't sleep for two
days. Of course there are the
"What if there had been a shoot
ing in my theater?" thoughts, the
concerns for Coloradan friends I
have, the simple sadness for the
lives taken and mourning families
and bystanders. But even after all
the criticism I could hurl at the
violence depicted in "Rises," the
way that the media and even fans

have drawn conclusions that a
movie could ca use someone to do
this is both immature and offen
sive. In Christopher Nolan's offi
cial statement on the shooting, the
director laments that someone
would "violate" such an "innocent
and hopeful place in such an
unbearably savage way." And just
so, those who accuse a film, a
piece of literature that at most
reflects our society, of creating a
massacre, violate the sanctity of the
theater.
What happened in that the
ater was truly a tragedy, but we are
blind to blame our societal prob

lems on the creative stuff of
Hollywood.
Yes, we should turn a critical
eye to our gun laws and our enter
tainment. But, no, "The Dark
Knight Rises" cannot be blamed
for the violence caused by a killer.
This is not a time for blame or
accusation, but for mourning and
reflection. And perhaps audiences
absorbing the film's grandiose vio
lence will consider the troubling
stems in reality.
