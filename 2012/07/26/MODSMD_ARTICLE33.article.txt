## The 						fairest of them all SF Playhouse's new take on 'My Fair Lady' a must-see 
### â€“ alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The SF Playhouse, a small
theater company that has
been consistently producing
some of the best productions in
the Bay Area, does it again with
director Bill English's reinterpreta
tion of the classic Broadway musi
cal "My Fair Lady." English's ver
sion is stripped down: There is no
pit orchestra, multiple lavish sets
or large ensemble dances. Instead,
there are efficient sets, two pianos
and 12 actors, each often playing
multiple supporting characters.
But what "Lady" lacks in extrava
gance it makes up for with great
originality, entirely reinventing
most of the musical numbers.

"My Fair Lady" is the story of
a poor Cockney flower girl, Eliza
Doolittle (Monique Hafen), who
learns to speak proper English

from phonetician and man-child
Henry Higgins (Johnny Moreno),
thus securing her upward mobility
and trapping her in the throes of
middle-class morality. Eliza has
always been a brash young

woman, but English's production
takes her characterization one step
further: It puts her in pants. In
English's version, the song
"Wouldn't It Be Loverly" becomes
Eliza's solo melancholic lament,
sung sadly and quietly while fend
ing off lecherous men with a knife.
Johnny Moreno looks like a
cross between Robert Downey Jr.
and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and
English has him play Higgins with
virility and sexuality, a bold choice
for Higgins, who often comes off
as asexual in the original work. His
relationship with Eliza, often

played as somewhat ambiguous, is
teeming with sexual tension here.
He also finds himself the seeming
object of affection of his colleague
and friend, Colonel Pickering
(Richard Frederick), who in this
version is a not-quite-upstanding
example of a perfect gentleman
more of a polite, closeted suitor for
Higgins. It seems a radical inter
pretation of the Higgins/Pickering
partnership, but the script has a
wealth of dialogue that could easily
be interpreted as innuendo given
our modern sensibilities.
Perhaps the biggest surprise is
how likable Alfred P. Doolittle
(Charles Dean) is. Eliza's unmar
ried father, he is always after her
money for drink and is often char
acterized as a simple, drunken
lout. But Dean oozes charm, and
as he winks at the audience to get
us in on the jokes, you can't help
but like him. When he finally gets
forced into marrying his mistress,
the number "I'm Getting Married
in the Morning," usually a fairly
jovial lament, becomes a dirge,
with Doolittle's friends hoisting
him up into the air as if they were
carrying a coffin.
As with any radical reinterpre
tation, not everything works.
Instead of being surrounded by
household staff, Higgins is sur
rounded by graduate students in
white lab coats, an absurd costume
choice, though the interpretation is
otherwise valid. English's decision
to fill "Ascot Gavotte" with sexual
innuendo to explain why the
upper-class spectators "have never
been so keyed up" deprives the
show of what should have been

one of its biggest laughs. And
although the British accents of the
cast are usually key to a produc
tion's success, as a play about
accents, here I'm almost inclined
to argue that they could have been
Americanized and simplified. It's
not that the dialects are bad
they are good enough to be unob
trusive but they interfere with
the actors' vocal work, causing
them to tighten their voices and
inhibiting expression.
But these are minor flaws in
what is otherwise an entertaining

and unique production of this
classic. English's rendition offers
something so entirely new that any
failures to live up to pre-existing
standards for productions of "My
Fair Lady" can be easily over
looked. The SF Playhouse produc
tion of "My Fair Lady" is easily the
single must-see play of the sum
mer in the Bay Area, with some
thing to offer both old and new
fans of the musical.
