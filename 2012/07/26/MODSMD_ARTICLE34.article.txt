Now that it's summer, the
cinemas are filled with
blockbuster action films
and not much else. If you're look
ing for a cheap alternative, here's a
list of four films from the last year
that you may have missed in the
aters but ought to catch on
Netflix.

"Weekend"
The 2011 British film
"Weekend" is similar to the 1995
drama "Before Sunrise," but with
two men falling in love in the U.K.
After meeting at a bar, Russell (Tom
Cullen) brings Glen (Chris New)
home, ostensibly for a one-night
stand, but they spend the day after

their tryst having one long, engaging
and deeply personal conversation
about everything from past relation
ships to their coming out experi
ences. In some ways, the confessional
nature of their discussion is facilitated
by their unfamiliarity. The romantic
and unabashedly realistic film is a
smart and touching story about our
universal need for intimacy and the
often-rampant fear of commitment.
"Tomboy"
While Celine Sciamma's
directorial debut, "Water Lilies"
(also on Netflix), was a film about
the complexities of adolescent sex
uality, her sophomore film,
"Tomboy," explores pre-pubescent
gender roles. When 10-year-old,
pixie-haired Laure (Zoe Heran)
and her loving family move into a
new neighborhood, she introduces
herself to her neighbors as
Michael, plays outside with the
boys and flirts with the girl next
door. Whether she does this
because she knows she will be
more easily accepted into her new
friend group as a boy or because
she identifies as one and should
instead be referred to as "he"
remains ambiguous throughout
the film. Laure is at an age when
gender roles are so firmly estab
lished in school and by her parents
that any kind of fluidity is feared

or downright dismissed. The film
grounds the complex treatment of
gender roles in a simple but touch
ing story of the burdens and joys
of being a child: the idyllic sum
mers, the responsibility of taking
care of her little sister, the need for
comfort and affection from her
parents, their simultaneous love
and small-mindedness and the fact
that she still often feels terrified
because her parents don't under
stand what she's going through
and nor does she. It's a film that
understands that being a kid is
hard work and often painful.
"Cave of Forgotten Dreams"
Werner Herzog's latest docu
mentary, "Cave of Forgotten
Dreams," takes us inside the
Chauvet Cave in Southern France
to see the world's oldest known
cave paintings. Access to the area is
strictly controlled it's closed to
the public but Herzog was able
to get limited access for over a
week to capture it on film. The
movie is one of the best examples
of using 3-D technology to its full
potential making you feel like
you're actually in the cave, some
thing 2-D would never be able to
really do but despite its 2-D
rendering on Netflix, "Dreams"
remains engaging and educational.
Herzog is eccentric, always finds a

way to humanize his subjects and
manages to find interesting charac
ters to interview, including a man
who literally sniffs his way around
in search of caves.
"The Trip"
Steve Coogan and Rob
Bryden play fictionalized versions
of themselves in Michael
Winterbottom's comedy "The
Trip." When Steve gets a gig touring
and reviewing posh restaurants in
the English countryside and his girl
friend can't accompany him, Rob
tags along for a weekend of gourmet
food and bonding. Steve and Rob,
both comedians, amuse themselves
over meals by doing hilarious
impressions of everyone from
Michael Caine to Woody Allen.
While on the surface the film is light
comedic entertainment, it holds
darker undertones on loneliness and
growing older. Steve is divorced and
struggles in his relationship with his
son and his long-distance girlfriend,
while Rob is happily married but
missing his wife. As they part ways,
Winterbottom juxtaposes Steve's
loneliness with Rob's blissful life,
elevating the movie above mere
farce.
