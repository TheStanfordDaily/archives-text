## Human rights 'both fluid and constant,' says Milani 
### RACHEL BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
"The concept of human
rights is both fluid and con
stant," author and Iran expert
Abbas Milani explained to
around 200 people in Braun Au
ditorium on July 24 as part of
the Stanford Summer Human
Rights Program.

Milani is the author of ten
books on Iran, including "A
Tale of Two Cities: A Persian
Memoir" and a biography of
Mohammad Reza Shah
Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran. He
is also the director of Iranian
Studies at Stanford and a co
founder of the Iran Democracy
Project.

According to Milani, there is
increasing global understanding
that certain rights are "inalien
able to every human being."
However, the Iranian govern
ment continues to breach
human rights by picking only
certain rights to defend instead
of supporting human rights in
their entirety.
"Can you beat women and

say 'this is my culture'?" Milani
asked.
The current Iranian Consti
tution states that women, Jews
and Christians are worth only
half of a man. It also provides no
right of privacy and allows peo
ple to be arrested arbitrarily.
The result is the most execu
tions per capita of any country,
ahead of even China.

"As a Chinese [citizen], Mi
lani's explanations made me re
consider the human rights in my
own country," said audience
member Jason Mao.

According to Milani, the
Iranian Revolution of 1979 has
made even Iranians realize that
human rights go beyond politi
cal rights; the idea of human
rights as a Western concept, he
argues, was concocted by
"racists in the West and despots
in the East."

"The complexity of our time
is that we have realized the con
tingency of our beliefs. Truths
have become relative," Milani
said.
