## Human rights 'both fluid and constant,' says Milani 
### RACHEL BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
"The concept of human
rights is both fluid and con
stant," author and Iran expert
Abbas Milani explained to
around 200 people in Braun Au
ditorium on July 24 as part of
the Stanford Summer Human
Rights Program.

Milani is the author of ten
books on Iran, including "A
Tale of Two Cities: A Persian
Memoir" and a biography of
Mohammad Reza Shah
Pahlavi, the last shah of Iran. He
is also the director of Iranian
Studies at Stanford and a co
founder of the Iran Democracy
Project.

According to Milani, there is
increasing global understanding
that certain rights are "inalien
able to every human being."
However, the Iranian govern
ment continues to breach
human rights by picking only
certain rights to defend instead
of supporting human rights in
their entirety.
"Can you beat women and

say 'this is my culture'?" Milani
asked.
The current Iranian Consti
tution states that women, Jews
and Christians are worth only
half of a man. It also provides no
right of privacy and allows peo
ple to be arrested arbitrarily.
The result is the most execu
tions per capita of any country,
ahead of even China.

"As a Chinese [citizen], Mi
lani's explanations made me re
consider the human rights in my
own country," said audience
member Jason Mao.

According to Milani, the
Iranian Revolution of 1979 has
made even Iranians realize that
human rights go beyond politi
cal rights; the idea of human
rights as a Western concept, he
argues, was concocted by
"racists in the West and despots
in the East."

"The complexity of our time
is that we have realized the con
tingency of our beliefs. Truths
have become relative," Milani
said.

Professor and author Abbas Milani speaks at Braun Auditorium on
July 24 as part of the Stanford Summer Human Rights Program.
When asked by an audience
member about the possibility of a
rebellion by the growing youth
three-fifths of the Iranian popula
tion is under 30 Milani ex
plained the difficulty of organizing
and mobilizing in Iran. He empha
sized that they do not want a
charismatic leader to head a rebel
lion.

"Heroes always fail them," Mi
lani said.

Hesitant to respond to ques
tions about the United States' im
pact on human rights in Iran, Mi
lani was confident in saying that
there is no military solution. He
criticized the United States, specif
ically the electronics company
Siemens, for providing the Iranian
government with technology that
has enabled censorship. He also
pointed out the United States
made a mistake giving Iran mis
siles during the Reagan adminis
tration in return for hostages.
"The United States can't bring
democracy to Iran," Milani said.
"Iranian people, and only Iranian
people, can."
