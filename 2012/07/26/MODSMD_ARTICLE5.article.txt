# STUDENT LIFE
## Old Union finals error explained 
### ANNA QIN DAILY INTERN 
During finals week of spring
quarter, Old Union hosted Digi
tal Media Academy (DMA), a
technology camp for high school
students, rather than accommo
dating Stanford students hoping
to study for exams. All rooms
were closed to students from June
8 to June 15, and Stanford stu
dents were unable to access Old
Union to study.
According to Jeanette Smith-
Laws, director of operations and
student unions, accommodating
outside requests for the use of Old
Union is not usual for operations
during the school year. Summer
programs and camps that start
early are usually deferred to other

buildings.
"Summer conference pro
grams always start after Com
mencement," she said. "Because
[DMA] started earlier, it should
have been scheduled at Tresidder
Union." In response to DMA's
placement in Old Union, which is
against what is considered stan
dard policy, Smith-Laws ex
plained that "it was a hiccup, a
glitch in the date, and it will not
happen again in the future."

However, Stanford adminis
tration does not have direct con
trol over room reservations made
in Old Union spaces. Reserva
tions for meeting rooms in the
Old Union are ultimately coordi
nated through the ASSU room
reservation system, which the
ASSU Executive manages. Any
one with a Stanford ID can re
serve meeting spaces, and the sys
tem does not actively report stu
dent reservations to the adminis
tration.

The administration only real
ized DMA's reservation conflict
ed with finals week after the pro
gram's use of the building had al
ready been confirmed. According
to Smith-Laws, when the mistake
was brought to her attention, the
University immediately sent out
an email notifying students of the
situation and attempted to reme
dy the loss of space by making
other buildings available for stu
dents to use as an alternative.
"That's the situation we were
faced with, and we tried to open
Tresidder for later hours," Smith-
Laws said. "We tried to offer
things like free coffee and snacks;
we tried to make it right in some
way."

Smith-Laws further stresses
that Old Union's policy to oper

ate in the interest of students will
not change in the future, especial
ly when planning for the use of
the building during the school
year. She emphasizes that the
building will prioritize student in
terest and activities.

"Since 2007, this has never
happened. It wasn't because we
changed policies," she said.
According to former ASSU
Senator Dan DeLong 'l3, the
onus is on the ASSU to take mea
sures to reform the room reserva
tion system that controls the use
of student spaces in Old Union.
"A lot of people thought that it
was strange, that [Old Union]
rooms were blocked off, especial
ly given that it was finals week,"
he said. "I hope that this year's
ASSU Executive will make it a
priority to make changes to the
room reservation system."
"It's part of my job to protect
the interest of the students, and
we apologize for making this mis
take," Smith-Laws said. "It won't
happen again."
