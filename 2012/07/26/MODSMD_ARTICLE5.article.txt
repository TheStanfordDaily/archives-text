# STUDENT LIFE
## Old Union finals error explained 
### ANNA QIN DAILY INTERN 
During finals week of spring
quarter, Old Union hosted Digi
tal Media Academy (DMA), a
technology camp for high school
students, rather than accommo
dating Stanford students hoping
to study for exams. All rooms
were closed to students from June
8 to June 15, and Stanford stu
dents were unable to access Old
Union to study.
According to Jeanette Smith-
Laws, director of operations and
student unions, accommodating
outside requests for the use of Old
Union is not usual for operations
during the school year. Summer
programs and camps that start
early are usually deferred to other

buildings.
"Summer conference pro

mencement," she said. "Because
[DMA] started earlier, it should
have been scheduled at Tresidder
Union." In response to DMA's
placement in Old Union, which is
against what is considered stan
dard policy, Smith-Laws ex
plained that "it was a hiccup, a
glitch in the date, and it will not
happen again in the future."

However, Stanford adminis

in Old Union spaces. Reserva

Old Union are ultimately coordi

reservation system, which the
ASSU Executive manages. Any
