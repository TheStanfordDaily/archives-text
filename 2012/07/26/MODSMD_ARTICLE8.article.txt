# STUDENT LIFE
## Poetry group voices the page on stage 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
Sometimes on a campus
widely known for technology
and science, it's easy to overlook
its vibrant, but at times lesser
known, arts community, partic
ularly within the student body.
Cue the Spoken Word Col
lective, Stanford's student-run
poetry group. For the poets, the
group is all about cultivating
emotion and generating explo
sive written and spoken poetry.
A decade ago the collective
didn't exist. It wasn't until 2002
that Mark Otuteye 'O5 M.A.'O6
founded the Spoken Word Col
lective because he felt as though
poets needed a place to come to
gether on campus.
"I think it's a safe space for
honest expression, whatever it
may be," said Raina Sun 'l3, the
director of the group. "Honest
ly, these types of spaces are
rare."

Since its founding, the collec
tive has assumed a role as cam
pus creative outlet, particularly
for writers who feel as though
their words are better suited for
the stage as opposed to the page.
From hosting quarterly cam
pus-wide shows, biweekly poet
ry workshops and open mics, to
competing in the College
Unions Poetry Slam, the largest
poetry slam in the country (last
year it placed fourth), the collec
tive ensures that there are many
opportunities to give student
poetry a voice.

The quarterly shows, accord
ing to Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, a
fourth-year member of the
group, attract over 200 people.
He says that the writing work
shops are also very popular.
"Every year I coordinate an
erotic poetry workshop in Feb
ruary called 'Snap & Moan,'"
Vaid-Menon said. "We invite
the Stanford community to
learn how to write and perform
erotic poetry with us it's al
ways a blast."

Although the group puts on
many events for the student
community, there are only a few
actual members of the collec
tive. Last year there were 11,
and this year there are a guaran
teed eight so far, plus the new
students they accept after audi
tions, which take place in the be
ginning of fall quarter. The audi
tions consist of poets of all dif
ferent skill levels reading one
original poem. After auditions,
the collective must unanimously
decide whom to accept into their
organization.

"We accept poets who we be
lieve can contribute something
new or fresh to the group and
grow as writers and performers
with us," Vaid-Menon said, "We
also like to choose people who
we know will vibe well socially
with the group, because we do
hang out a lot."
Vaid-Menon says that over
time, the group has become a
close-knit bunch of friends who
enjoy picnics, parties and exclu
sive bonding retreats. In addi
tion to friendship, he feels as
though the collective provides a
place for nurturing a communal
artistic growth.
"I've stayed an active mem
ber of Spoken Word these past
three years because it gives me
the progressive and artistic com
munity I find lacking in a lot of
other spaces at Stanford," he
said. "We try our best to use art
as a form of social cohesion and
transformation in our group."

Another member of the
group, Tina Miller 'l4, agrees
that the community aspect of
the group is really what makes
the collective special.
"We have some amazing
people in the collective, and
when we meet once a week, it's a
way of kind of checking in on
each other," Miller said. "Be
cause otherwise the writing life
can get lonely. We're talking
about the depths of our feelings
