# A
						HIKE 'R OUND THE DISH
## 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
When I'm up where I can see the
entire bay, I notice the silence.
There is no iPod music or angry dri
vers searching for parking up here.
There are no dogs barking or babies
crying.

Instead, there's the hum of in
sects emanating from the hay-col
ored fields, the swish of wind and
light chatter that floats through the
air. It's not complete silence, but
the sounds blend together to cre
ate a quiet atmosphere. And it is
the resulting orchestration of sim
ple harmonies that reminds me that
I'm standing on one of the lesser
known symbols of Stanford Univer
sity.

A Palo Alto local, I walk the
Dish hiking trail every Saturday.
Today isn't Saturday, but the slop
ing path at the very beginning of the
hike, guarded on both sides by rows
of tan plants, remains the same. This
hill is my least favorite part of the
walk and my calves ache and pinch
by the time I reach the top of the hill.
The Dish, built by the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) in 1966, is
a radio reflector antenna built for
the U.S. Department of Defense
to study the atmospheric composi
tion. It served different purposes in
the past, like studying spacecrafts,
but remains in use today for acade
mic reasons. The reason walkers
can see it from almost any point on
the trail is because it's huge: 150 feet
in diameter.

In front of me, a young couple
stops mid-jog to take a picture of a
squirrel reclining in the shade of a
fence. Although the squirrels are

adorable, I'm not excited when I see
them. Because they're everywhere,
I can always expect them to fearless
ly run across the trail and chew the
plants growing on the sides of the
road whenever I visit the Dish.
Once, I tried to keep count of how
many of these rodents there actual
ly were, One. Two. Three. I stopped
when I realized that I still had half
the trail to finish and I had already
reached 80.

I'm a little more surprised when
I notice a white heron standing
serenely by the trail. But seeing the
animals is all part of the experience
of walking. On my many visits, I've
seen white and blue-grey speckled
herons, predatory birds, lizards,
hares, a coyote, a deer and ground
squirrels so many squirrels. I've
even been traumatized by a dead
snake.

The only animal I've never seen
is a mountain lion, even though the
large warning sign reminding walk
ers and runners of their existence
nearby is the first thing that greets
me at the gate to the trail. I suppose
that's a good thing.
Even without the animals, the
trail is one of the most picturesque
places around Palo Alto, especially
when I reach the top. Today, I peer
down and see Hoover Tower stab
bing through the sea of red buildings
and the bay, adorned by clouds. It's
fit for a postcard. Around me, the
air is smooth and refreshing, even
though the midday sun is growing
stronger.

After I reach the top of the in
cline, the road grows flat, making it
perfect for conversation. My friend
and I chat about our summer vaca
tions (she went to the Arctic then

South Carolina; I went to New
Zealand) as we stroll down the path.
Joggers, sweating and breathing
heavily, thunder by.
Reaching the Dish marks, for
me, the halfway point in the trail.
Not everyone would call the actual
Dish artistic, but I wonder if people
appreciate the history behind what
they walk by. For years, I didn't.
Panting, I'd give one or two glances
at the hulking blue and white ma
chine and then keep walking. But in
retrospect, it deserved more respect
from my young self.
In May 2000, former Stanford
President Gerhard Casper released
a statement detailing conservation
plans for the Dish. In 2010, the plan
was refined to conserve at least five
species native to the area surround
ing the trail, including the California
tiger salamander. Currently, the
Dish is undergoing both habitat
conservation and restoration of na
tive flora. Even so, I don't notice
anything that distracts from the nat
ural beauty of the trail.
Toward the end of my walk, sur
rounded by a breathtaking view
that includes both Stanford archi
tecture and the natural environ
ment, I cannot find the words to ex
press myself. But at that moment, a
little girl walking past me says what
is really just on the tip of my tongue.
"You were right!" she crows to a
woman standing next to her, bend
ing down and looking around." You
can see everything from up here,"
And in away, she's right. Up
here, there's a view, an environ
ment, a community, a history.
