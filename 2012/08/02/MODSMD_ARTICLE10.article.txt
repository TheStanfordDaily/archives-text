## Benefits of uncertainty 
### Fatima Wagdy 
Many first-generation kids
(children of immigrant
families) know all too
well about the back-and-forth
dance that surrounds any invita
tion. These kids know that if of
fered a glass of juice in the home
of a guest, they must first refuse.
The host will continue to offer,
and the guest must continue to
refuse. Somehow, it is under
stood when it is appropriate to
concede to the offer. It is also un
derstood when the invitation is
insincere (i.e., when you are sup
posed to firmly say no till the
end).

I suppose it's a skill that peo
ple here in Egypt, and in many
other countries, have. In the
United States, things are usually
much more straightforward;
people, for the most part, mean
what they say when they invite
you over for dinner. Life is just
easier that way.
In the past few weeks, I have
made many missteps in this so

cial dance. I didn't offer to pay
enough times when I should
have and accepted offers that I
should have refused a few more
times. I realized it just takes
being a bit more aware of the
context of a situation, but I still
don't really understand what's
appropriate. I suppose it is a
sense developed over time and I
just missed out.
Strangely enough, I think the
same skill needed in these situa
tions is needed in crossing the
street. Crossing busy streets in
Cairo is unavoidable; the street
will never become completely
free of cars so people can safely
cross. Crosswalks are nowhere to
be found here in Egypt, and if
there are lanes painted on the
street, they are mere decora
tions. Pedestrians must have an
acute understanding of how to
deal with the drivers in each new
situation. They must have a
sense for how to stick their hand out, look a
driver in the eye, wait in the middle and
then, at the right second, make their move.

This summer, I have been nearly run over
several times; once, I was sure my life was
over (I caused a bit of a scene in the street in
this near-death experience). Meanwhile, I
saw kids no older than 10 casually walk
across the street I thought impossible to
cross. Driving is the same story, but worse.
I suppose what these things come down to
is uncertainty. People here seem very com
fortable with uncertainty and prepared to
deal with it. The people here cannot trust
some flashing sign to tell them when to cross
the street. So they learn from a young age to

deal with the randomness and just go with
the flow.

Maybe we need more uncertainty in our
lives here in the U.S. as well. There is a de
gree of adaptability and understanding that
comes with these and many other situations.
Perhaps by having any easy answer,
whether it is a crosswalk or a stoplight, we
lose these skills. Maybe that's why when we
come to Stanford, we ride our bikes around
campus like maniacs (myself included).

I don't envy the disorder of the crazy
Cairo streets, but at the end of the day, there
is a particular equilibrium here that works.
It's a bad equilibrium, but through it, peo
ple adapt in ways many of us at Stanford
might think impossible. I think we might ac
tually learn a lot from having to navigate a
busy street without dying.
