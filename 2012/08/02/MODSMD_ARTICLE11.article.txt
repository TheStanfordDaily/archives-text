## Stanford professor wins Fundamental Physics Prize 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Haelin Cho 
On July 31, Stanford physics professor
Andrei Linde became one of the inaugural
recipients of the Fundamental Physics Prize.
The Milner Foundation in Russia recognized
eight physicists in addition to Linde, and
founder Yuri Milner personally chose Linde
to receive the award for his work on cosmic
inflation.
Originally proposed by fellow Fundamen
tal Physics Prize recipient Alan Guth of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cos
mic inflation is a modification of the Big Bang
theory that explains how the universe was
formed from a tiny, rapidly inflating piece of
space.
Linde has been developing his theory since
the early 1980s, and he has watched his work
transform from apparent science fiction into a
cosmologic model. His versions of the infla
tion model correctly predicted observations
of the sky and were supported by multiple ex
periments testing inflation and other alterna
tive theories.
The Fundamental Physics Prize is one of
the highest paying academic prizes: instead of
splitting the reward, each recipient was given
$3 million. In the future, the Milner Founda
tion plans to give the award to one scientist
each year, and Linde and the other eight win
ners will form the selection committee.
"We now have the ability to say these peo
ple are doing something fantastic," Linde said
in an article in the Stanford News Service.
"They might not get wide scientific recogni
tion until there is experimental proof, but that

is maybe 10 years from now, so let's do some
thing good for them right away if we all agree
that what they're doing is great."
