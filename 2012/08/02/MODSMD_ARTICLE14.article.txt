## MAKING AN IMPACT Redshirt freshman outside linebacker Kevin Anderson finally gets the chance to play on game day after a year of hard work 
### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS EDITOR 
It's 8 a.m. on a sunny, brisk Monday
morning in mid-July. Most of the
Stanford campus is fast asleep at this
time of the morning during the
school year. In the summer, it's eeri
ly silent. But on the practice football field,
redshirt freshman outside linebacker
Kevin Anderson is already an hour into
the team run, with half an hour still re
maining.

Immediately following the run, he and
his Cardinal teammates dive straight into
a weight lifting session that lasts for anoth
er hour and a half. It's barely 10 a.m. and
Anderson has already completed three
hours of conditioning on the day.
After lunch he gets a little bit of time to
unwind, maybe sneak in a quick nap if he
is lucky. He returns to the weight room at
four, in time for another lift workout. This
one is optional, but Anderson rarely skips.
By the time he is done, he will have just
enough time to grab dinner before head
ing out back onto the field at seven for the
two-hour captain's practice. Held twice a
week, these pad-less practices are meant
for the players to hone their on-field skills
and run the playbook to perfection. The
focus is on repetition with precision.
At 9 p.m., Anderson is finally done for
the day, after six and a half hours of train
ing. He goes back to his home in Palo Alto
with his teammates, classmates and close
friends J.B. Salem and Anthony Hayes,
who are staying with him over the sum
mer. They are tired, sore and fully aware
that they will have to wake up in time for
tomorrow's 7 a.m. team run yet again.
This grueling daily summer routine is
nothing new for the Palo Alto native, who
went through a similar schedule at last
year's preseason conditioning as an in
coming freshman. But while the practices
may not have changed all that much, he
knows that this upcoming season will be
very different for one important reason:
no longer redshirting, Anderson will final
ly have a chance to make an impact on

game day.
The experience that a player gains
from redshirting might be one of the most
overlooked and underappreciated aspects
of college football. Because redshirts are
not eligible to compete in games, they are
virtually unmentioned in media coverage
during the season. But for Anderson, his
past redshirt season was critical in terms of
maturing both on and off the field.
"A lot of people think of redshirt as
time off, but it really ends up being work
ing extra hard," said Anderson. "Because
you're not playing in games, you can get in
three lifts per day sometimes. There's
more practicing and scrimmaging to get
bigger, faster and stronger. It's a lot of
work, but it's definitely worthwhile red
shirting."
Much of Anderson's progress in im
proving his physical abilities and on-field
skill set has come under the steady guid
ance of outside linebacker coach Lance
Anderson, who was named the 2012 Na
tional Recruiter of the Year for his huge
role in landing four five-star prospects in
Stanford's best recruiting class of all time.
The player credits his coach with helping
him greatly improve his footwork as well
as develop his coverage skills.
Given Anderson's rapid development
as an outside linebacker, it might come as
a surprise that he played defensive end
during his remarkable high school career.
Anderson became a local superstar at
Palo Alto High School, where his ability
to elude blockers and wreak havoc in the
backfield propelled him to monster junior
and senior seasons. He ended his break
out junior year with 68 tackles â€”lB of
which were for a loss along with 6.5
sacks and was named Santa Clara Valley
Athletic League's Defensive Lineman of
the Year. After receiving a considerable
amount of attention from college re
cruiters, he followed through with an even
more impressive senior campaign that saw
him garner first-team all-state honors and

record 113 tackles with 11.5 sacks.
The most important accomplishment for
Anderson wasn't his individual accolades or
statistics, though. He will be the first to tell
you that the most memorable moment was
playing a key role in his team's improbable
state title run. Prior to his senior season, the
Vikings were not considered to be in con
tention for the league and section crowns,
much less the state championship. But An
derson's leadership on both the offensive
and defensive line helped Paly find away to
win week after week all the way to the state
championship, where the Vikings upset
powerhouse Centennial 15-13 and secured
their first perfect season in school history.
Yet despite his success playing defensive
end in high school, Anderson constantly had
to force himself to gain the weight needed to
meet the physical demands of playing on the
defensive line. When he arrived on the
Farm, he knew something had to change.

"I came in last summer as a defensive
end," he explained. "[The coaches] wanted
me to gain a lot of weight, but I can't gain
weight very well. So they put me in as out
side linebacker at last year's preseason
camp, and I played well. I've stayed there
ever since then. I don't have to force myself
to gain weight now; I just need to get
stronger and faster. At that position, it's
kind of like being a glorified pass rusher. I
drop back a third of the time, but I pass rush
the rest of the time. I love playing at the out
side linebacker position."
Even after the position switch, Ander
son's 6-foot-4, 225-pound frame still isn't
considered imposing for an outside line
backer in college football. With size as a pos
sible disadvantage, technique and speed
two aspects of his game that Anderson con
stantly emphasizes in practice become all
the more important.
"If you lack size [as a defender], you have
to make it up in speed," he said. "On some
plays I'm not going to be able to overpower
someone, which means I'll have to run
around them. You have to have your
strengths overshadow your weaknesses."

Anderson's redshirt season was not an
easy road by any means.
Despite his status as a local star in the
Bay Area, Anderson was a three-star re
cruit, not as heavily recruited as some of the
other prospects in the nation. Yet none of it
deterred him from working as hard as the
next guy, whether it was on the practice field
or in the weight room. Anderson gave it his
all starting from day one.
"I just felt like I had something to prove
to myself because I wasn't coming in as a

highly touted recruit," said Anderson. "I felt
like I had a chip on my shoulder. There's a
lot of politics that go into the recruit rank
ings. But for me, I just want to play football.
Once you're at the college level, it doesn't
matter who's a five-star recruit and who's
not. If I can outwork them, it doesn't matter.
That's my philosophy."

As Stanford ended its season with a loss
in the Fiesta Bowl, Anderson faced yet an
other obstacle, albeit a completely different
one. He suffered a bone spur injury in his
ankle that forced him to undergo surgery in
late January. The operation sidelined him
for two months, during which the team was
going through conditioning workouts in
preparation for spring ball.
"The overgrowth of the bone affected
my ankle ability," said Anderson. "After the
season was done, I had surgery to have them
removed. And then there was rehab and a
lot of physical therapy. That set me back a
little bit, but it wasn't too bad."
Despite missing a month and a half of runs
and another two weeks of spring ball, Ander
son saw a sizable chunk of playing time at
Stanford's Cardinal and White Spring Game
in mid-April. His steady performance over
three quarters caught the attention of both
the coaching staff and the media.
"It was nice knowing that the hard work
finally paid off and helped the team, espe
cially after recovering from my injury." said
Anderson. "Hopefully it'll help the team in
the fall as well."

Stanford will have one of the top defen
sive front sevens in the nation for the upcom
ing season. With departures of key offensive
pieces that included Andrew Luck, David
DeCastro, Coby Fleener and Jonathan Mar
tin, the Cardinal will now rely even more on
the ability of its defense to shut down oppo
nents and force turnovers. Between the fear
some trio of Shayne Skov, Chase Thomas
and Trent Murphy at the linebacker posi
tions and the pass rushing attack of Ben
Gardner and incoming five-star recruit Aziz
Shittu in the trenches, the team's strong de
fensive core has a great chance of living up to
those high expectations.
With last year's starters Thomas and
Murphy returning at the outside linebacker
slots, Anderson understands that he will not
be a starter right away. But that is the least
of the redshirt freshman's concerns; instead,
he relishes the chance of seeing some play
ing time on the field. The last time he com
peted in an official game, he was in the green
and white uniform of his high school team.
With the Aug. 31 season opener against San
Jose State less than a month away, he will
soon be finally donning cardinal and white.

Anderson is currently enjoying some
time off in Hawaii with his family, during
one of the only four to five weeks that
football players have off each year. When
he returns from his vacation, preseason
camp will begin in earnest on Aug. 5
this time, practices will be in full pads and
full contact. There is no doubt that the in
tensity level will be cranked up a notch as
the season opener draws closer. Anderson
knows that the atmosphere will be differ
ent than last year's with his chance to be
out there on the field on game day finally
arriving.

But Anderson fully embraces the intensi
ty. Given his relentless work ethic, presea
son camp will just be another stepping-stone
for him as he keeps on trying to improve and
contribute to his team's success in any way

that he can. It's a process of preparation that
he is all too familiar with.

"My ability to keep going and never
stopping," said Anderson. "That's my
strongest attribute as a player. My motor."

With his redshirt season behind him at
last, Anderson's motor has been fully fu
eled and shifted to an even higher gear.
Soon he'll be given the opportunity to ex
pand upon his successes and prove himself
on the collegiate level.
"I'm excited to have the chance to play
after sitting out for so long," he said. "I
haven't played an official game since the
high school state championship. I'm excited
to just go out and play the game."
