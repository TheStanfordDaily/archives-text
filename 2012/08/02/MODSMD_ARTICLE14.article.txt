## MAKING AN IMPACT Redshirt freshman outside linebacker Kevin Anderson finally gets the chance to play on game day after a year of hard work 
### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS EDITOR 
It's 8 a.m. on a sunny, brisk Monday
morning in mid-July. Most of the
Stanford campus is fast asleep at this
time of the morning during the
school year. In the summer, it's eeri
ly silent. But on the practice football field,
redshirt freshman outside linebacker
Kevin Anderson is already an hour into
the team run, with half an hour still re
maining.

Immediately following the run, he and
his Cardinal teammates dive straight into
a weight lifting session that lasts for anoth
er hour and a half. It's barely 10 a.m. and
Anderson has already completed three
hours of conditioning on the day.
After lunch he gets a little bit of time to
unwind, maybe sneak in a quick nap if he
is lucky. He returns to the weight room at
four, in time for another lift workout. This
one is optional, but Anderson rarely skips.
By the time he is done, he will have just
enough time to grab dinner before head
ing out back onto the field at seven for the
two-hour captain's practice. Held twice a
week, these pad-less practices are meant
for the players to hone their on-field skills
and run the playbook to perfection. The
focus is on repetition with precision.
At 9 p.m., Anderson is finally done for
the day, after six and a half hours of train
ing. He goes back to his home in Palo Alto
with his teammates, classmates and close
friends J.B. Salem and Anthony Hayes,
who are staying with him over the sum
mer. They are tired, sore and fully aware
that they will have to wake up in time for
tomorrow's 7 a.m. team run yet again.
This grueling daily summer routine is
nothing new for the Palo Alto native, who
went through a similar schedule at last
year's preseason conditioning as an in
coming freshman. But while the practices
may not have changed all that much, he
knows that this upcoming season will be
very different for one important reason:
no longer redshirting, Anderson will final
ly have a chance to make an impact on

game day.
The experience that a player gains
from redshirting might be one of the most
overlooked and underappreciated aspects
of college football. Because redshirts are
not eligible to compete in games, they are
virtually unmentioned in media coverage
during the season. But for Anderson, his
past redshirt season was critical in terms of
maturing both on and off the field.
"A lot of people think of redshirt as
time off, but it really ends up being work
ing extra hard," said Anderson. "Because
you're not playing in games, you can get in
three lifts per day sometimes. There's
more practicing and scrimmaging to get
bigger, faster and stronger. It's a lot of
work, but it's definitely worthwhile red
shirting."
Much of Anderson's progress in im
proving his physical abilities and on-field
skill set has come under the steady guid
ance of outside linebacker coach Lance
Anderson, who was named the 2012 Na
tional Recruiter of the Year for his huge
role in landing four five-star prospects in
Stanford's best recruiting class of all time.
The player credits his coach with helping
him greatly improve his footwork as well
as develop his coverage skills.
Given Anderson's rapid development
as an outside linebacker, it might come as
a surprise that he played defensive end
during his remarkable high school career.
Anderson became a local superstar at
Palo Alto High School, where his ability
to elude blockers and wreak havoc in the
backfield propelled him to monster junior
and senior seasons. He ended his break
out junior year with 68 tackles â€”lB of
which were for a loss along with 6.5
sacks and was named Santa Clara Valley
Athletic League's Defensive Lineman of
the Year. After receiving a considerable
amount of attention from college re
cruiters, he followed through with an even
more impressive senior campaign that saw
him garner first-team all-state honors and
