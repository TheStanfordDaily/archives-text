# LIFE ON THE BEACH
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Apparently there are a
lot of sporting events
taking place across
London at the mo
ment from cycling
to canoeing, horse riding to field
hockey, swimming to soccer.
Being here, though, and especial
ly being involved, I really have no
idea what is going on.
I'm lucky enough to be volun
teering at the London 2012
Olympic Games and even luckier
to have a relatively interesting
role in press operations. Unfortu
nately, I'm not really supposed to
go into too much detail about this
right now, due to both general se
curity concerns and exclusive
deals that the International
Olympic Committee has with var
ious media organizations. I am,
however, getting to watch a lot of
beach volleyball.
The whole city is of course
busy. Traveling to and from work,
there are crowds of spectators and
tourists meandering their way
across town and asking me, in my
lovely red and purple uniform, all
sorts of questions that I don't
know the answer to. Flick on a TV

or glance at a newspaper and the
news is dominated by Olympic
coverage, especially dealing with
the frustrations so far of the local
medal favorites.

But with the Games lasting just
over two weeks and including
such a huge variety of sports,
there is just too much going on.
Even sitting at home in front of
the TV and computer, it would be
impossible to be up to date with
every twist and turn, and I don't
have that luxury.
I don't have a smart phone,
and even if I did, there wouldn't
be much time to make use of it.
Apart from being able to look up
at the sky and see the swarming
helicopters tracking down some
newsworthy item, most days I
have to wait to get home to dis
cover what has happened. And
when I'm not too exhausted to
tune in and catch some of the ac
tion, I find myself surfing through
to check the latest on the beach
volleyball.
I have to admit knowing next
to nothing about this sport before
I got randomly assigned to it; I
wasn't even hugely knowledge
able about who two-time
Olympic gold medalist and Car
dinal legend Kerri Walsh Jen
nings 'OO was. But after sitting
around for a few days watching
game after game and poring over
the competition's media guide,
I'm now a little bit enthralled. On
the days I get to come home
early, it feels hard to tear myself
away.

Beach volleyball is loud, a bit
brash and perhaps best known
for the skimpy bikinis worn by
the female athletes. It has attract
ed quite a lot of attention from
both enthusiastic locals and in

trigued politicians the tempo
rary stadium sits right in the heart
of the iconic center of London,
just a stone's throw from most
government buildings. But be
hind the dancers and the music
lies a real sport.
To quote Walsh Jennings,
"Sometimes it's just the beer and
the bikinis that get people to
come and watch, but it's the com
petition that's keeping them
there."

On my first day off, I headed
across to visit the Olympic Park,
where several of the main
venues, including the Olympic
Stadium, are located. It was a
weird experience, as my friends
and I had tickets to the park but
not to any of the stadiums inside.
It was a little bit like spending a
day at a theme park but not being
allowed on any of the rides.
Worse still, there were a few big
screens showing us exactly how
much fun those with real tickets
were having.
But even being at ground
zero, it was hard to get a real feel

ing for what was going on. If you
watch one event, you miss anoth
er. Perhaps when the athletics
starts it will be possible to sit back
in your seat in the stadium as
suming you are lucky enough to
have one and see a host of si
multaneous events, but even then
it just isn't possible to focus on
everything at once.
And especially not now. Not
with a new sport occupying my
waking thoughts. This won't last,
though, because the beach vol
leyball tournament will come to a
close in just a week. When it does,
it will surely fade away as the big
ger sports come crowding back
into my consciousness.

Or will it? It seems that
women's beach volleyball, under
the name of "sand volleyball," is
now an NCAA sport. Perhaps it
one day follow me back to Stan
ford.

and I had tickets to the park but
not to any of the stadiums inside.
It was a little bit like spending a
day at a theme park but not being
allowed on any of the rides.
Worse still, there were a few big
screens showing us exactly how
much fun those with real tickets
were having.
But even being at ground
zero, it was hard to get a real feel

ing for what was going on. If you
watch one event, you miss anoth
er. Perhaps when the athletics
starts it will be possible to sit back
in your seat in the stadium as
suming you are lucky enough to
have one and see a host of si
multaneous events, but even then
it just isn't possible to focus on
everything at once.
And especially not now. Not
with a new sport occupying my
waking thoughts. This won't last,
though, because the beach vol
leyball tournament will come to a
close in just a week. When it does,
it will surely fade away as the big
ger sports come crowding back
into my consciousness.

Or will it? It seems that
women's beach volleyball, under
the name of "sand volleyball," is
now an NCAA sport. Perhaps it
one day follow me back to Stan
ford.

Apparently there are a
lot of sporting events
taking place across
London at the mo
ment from cycling
to canoeing, horse riding to field
hockey, swimming to soccer.
Being here, though, and especial
ly being involved, I really have no
idea what is going on.
I'm lucky enough to be volun
teering at the London 2012
Olympic Games and even luckier
to have a relatively interesting
role in press operations. Unfortu
nately, I'm not really supposed to
go into too much detail about this
right now, due to both general se
curity concerns and exclusive
deals that the International
Olympic Committee has with var
ious media organizations. I am,
however, getting to watch a lot of
beach volleyball.
The whole city is of course
busy. Traveling to and from work,
there are crowds of spectators and
tourists meandering their way
across town and asking me, in my
lovely red and purple uniform, all
sorts of questions that I don't
know the answer to. Flick on a TV

or glance at a newspaper and the
news is dominated by Olympic
coverage, especially dealing with
the frustrations so far of the local
medal favorites.

But with the Games lasting just
over two weeks and including
such a huge variety of sports,
there is just too much going on.
Even sitting at home in front of
the TV and computer, it would be
impossible to be up to date with
every twist and turn, and I don't
have that luxury.
I don't have a smart phone,
and even if I did, there wouldn't
be much time to make use of it.
Apart from being able to look up
at the sky and see the swarming
helicopters tracking down some
newsworthy item, most days I
have to wait to get home to dis
cover what has happened. And
when I'm not too exhausted to
tune in and catch some of the ac
tion, I find myself surfing through
to check the latest on the beach
volleyball.
I have to admit knowing next
to nothing about this sport before
I got randomly assigned to it; I
wasn't even hugely knowledge
able about who two-time
Olympic gold medalist and Car
dinal legend Kerri Walsh Jen
nings 'OO was. But after sitting
around for a few days watching
game after game and poring over
the competition's media guide,
I'm now a little bit enthralled. On
the days I get to come home
early, it feels hard to tear myself
away.

Beach volleyball is loud, a bit
brash and perhaps best known
for the skimpy bikinis worn by
the female athletes. It has attract
ed quite a lot of attention from
both enthusiastic locals and in

trigued politicians the tempo
rary stadium sits right in the heart
of the iconic center of London,
just a stone's throw from most
government buildings. But be
hind the dancers and the music
lies a real sport.
To quote Walsh Jennings,
"Sometimes it's just the beer and
the bikinis that get people to
come and watch, but it's the com
petition that's keeping them
there."

On my first day off, I headed
across to visit the Olympic Park,
where several of the main
venues, including the Olympic
Stadium, are located. It was a
weird experience, as my friends
and I had tickets to the park but
not to any of the stadiums inside.
