# CROWNING OF A NEW KING
## 
### George Chen 
The latest chapter of the
Michael Phelps-Ryan
Lochte rivalry, the 400-
meter individual medley
race on Saturday, was
supposed to be one of the greatest
showdowns in Olympic history. In
stead, it will be remembered as the
dramatic matchup that was not to
be.

Things seemed awry right off the
bat, when Phelps barely managed to
squeak into the final with an unchar
acteristically uncomfortable swim
in the preliminary heats. When the
finals did come, the improbable
happened; not only was Phelps
blown out of the water by his Amer
ican teammate by over four sec
onds, but the 14-time Olympic gold
medalist failed to even score a spot
on the medal podium.
Phelps' fourth-place finish in
deed may have been shocking, but
Lochte's victory wasn't. The cool,
collected Lochtenator didn't win
because Phelps had a bad day. He
won because his disciplined work
ethic and grind-it-out mentality
over the past four years finally paid
off. Lochte's victory over Phelps in
the opening event of the 2012 Sum
mer Olympics swimming segment
showed that, if nothing else, there's
no substitute for hard work.

Having swum in Phelps' shadow
for the past eight years, it isn't diffi
cult to see where Lochte's motiva
tion to push himself beyond mental
and physical limits in training comes
from. Lochte was a star in his own
right at Beijing 2008, winning two
gold medals and a pair of bronzes,
but all of that was overshadowed
and understandably so —by
Phelps' historic haul of eight gold
medals.

Lochte's training for London
began the day after he competed in
his last event at Beijing. That was
the day when he decided he was no
longer going to be the second best
swimmer in the world. With coach
Greg Troy always finding new ways
to break down his swimmer, Lochte
cranked up both the yardage and in
tensity of his practices.

The resolute swimmer started a
dryland regimen that was similar to
the Strongman competition events

and also paid closer attention to his
nutrition intake. His laid-back atti
tude outside of the pool balanced
his fierce competitiveness in the
water to fuel a drive that didn't burn
out. His carefree nature and injury
prone hobbies outside of the pool
constantly had his coach and fans on
pins and needles (he fractured a foot
in a skateboarding accident and a
shoulder while playing hide-and
seek). But as Lochte would proba
bly say in his nonchalant tone,
"Dude, it's no big deal."
Phelps, meanwhile, took a well
deserved extended break from
swimming after Beijing. He was his
dominant self at the 2009 World
Championships, but his inconsistent
practice schedule led to subpar per
formances at major international
meets over the next two years. Both
Phelps and his coach, Bob Bow
man, admitted that for a while the
Olympic star wouldn't show up at
the training facility for days, and
when he did, he was just going
through the motions at practice.
To be fair, Phelps certainly did
his own share of equally intensive
training for the eight years prior to
Beijing. I can't blame Phelps for not
training these past four years the
way he did for the last two
Olympics, especially when he's ac
complished everything there is to
accomplish in the sport. What moti
vation is left once you've already
won 16 Olympic medals and ce
mented your status as the greatest
swimmer that ever lived?

But the sport of swimming does
n't make exceptions for even the
greatest swimmer of all time, espe
cially not when it comes to having
the necessary training to compete in
the 400IM, one of the most grueling
races in the sport and an ultimate
test of a swimmer's form. Lochte
started training for the event four
years ago while Phelps didn't begin
training for it until nine months ago
(he actually didn't think he'd ever
even swim it after Beijing). In swim
ming, the times don't he and the dif
ference in their training input was
clearly shown on Saturday as
Lochte was the better swimmer in
every aspect of the race from start to
finish: speed, power, endurance, un

derwater kicks and transition turns,

Phelps' loss doesn't take away
from what he's already accom
plished by any means. He wasn't
kidding when he said that this sum
mer would be about how many top
pings he could add to his sundae. On
Tuesday, Phelps became the most
decorated Olympian of all time by
winning the 19th Olympic medal of
his career. Judging by his reaction
after being touched out by five hun
dredths of a second in the 200 fly, no
one was more disappointed in his
silver medal in his signature event
than the swimmer himself. But in
the grand scheme of things, a sec
ond-place finish isn't nearly enough
for anyone to claim that Phelps isn't
the greatest Olympian ever.

It's too early to tell whether
Phelps will actually retire or not
after the Olympics, regardless of
what he has announced publicly.
My hope is that Phelps will come
back after these Games and have
another go at it. He hates the bitter
taste of losing even more than he
loves the sweet joy of winning.
That's what makes him so great;
that's why the idea of him coming
back isn't so far-fetched.

And let's not forget that the
Phelps-Lochte rivalry isn't over
just yet. The two best swimmers in
the world will square off once again
starting on Thursday in the 200IM
a shorter event where Phelps
has a better chance of beating
Lochte. Their fierce competition in
the pool and close friendship out
side epitomize the ideal sports ri
valry that few competitors are capa
ble of embodying.
Rivalries aside, enough can't be
said about how both Phelps and
Lochte have changed the face of
swimming. They've brought an un
precedented amount of media pub
licity (see the cover of the newest
issue of Time magazine) and fan at
tention to the sport.
Phelps should be credited first
and foremost for paving the way
with his past record-breaking per
formances. Between 2000 and 2010,
participation in competitive swim
ming increased by 29.6 percent.
Michael Phelps was a huge reason
behind that. What he's done for
swimming is comparable to what
Michael Jordan did for basketball,
Wayne Gretzky for hockey,
Muhammad Ali for boxing and
Pele for soccer.
But Lochte's moment to shine
has come at last, and there's noth
ing that can stop it from happening.
It's been a long time coming for the
27-year-old swimmer, but the hard
work has finally paid off.
In the end, what we need to
come away from all of this is that
Phelps' loss shouldn't overshadow
Lochte's win. Lochte found away
to swim every lap with a purpose
driven focus every day for the last
four years. That's why he deserves
all the credit for his victory on Sat
urday. That's also why right now
there's a new undisputed king in
the world of swimming. All hail
King Lochte.

George Chen still can't believe that
Phelps was on the losing end of the
touch out in the 200 fly today.

and physical limits in training comes
from. Lochte was a star in his own
right at Beijing 2008, winning two
gold medals and a pair of bronzes,
but all of that was overshadowed
and understandably so —by
Phelps' historic haul of eight gold
medals.

Lochte's training for London
began the day after he competed in
his last event at Beijing. That was
the day when he decided he was no
longer going to be the second best
swimmer in the world. With coach
Greg Troy always finding new ways
to break down his swimmer, Lochte
cranked up both the yardage and in
tensity of his practices.

The resolute swimmer started a
dryland regimen that was similar to
the Strongman competition events

and also paid closer attention to his
nutrition intake. His laid-back atti
tude outside of the pool balanced
his fierce competitiveness in the
water to fuel a drive that didn't burn
out. His carefree nature and injury
prone hobbies outside of the pool
constantly had his coach and fans on
pins and needles (he fractured a foot
in a skateboarding accident and a
shoulder while playing hide-and
seek). But as Lochte would proba
bly say in his nonchalant tone,
"Dude, it's no big deal."
Phelps, meanwhile, took a well
deserved extended break from
swimming after Beijing. He was his
dominant self at the 2009 World
Championships, but his inconsistent
practice schedule led to subpar per
formances at major international
meets over the next two years. Both
Phelps and his coach, Bob Bow
man, admitted that for a while the
Olympic star wouldn't show up at
the training facility for days, and
when he did, he was just going
through the motions at practice.
To be fair, Phelps certainly did
his own share of equally intensive
training for the eight years prior to
Beijing. I can't blame Phelps for not
training these past four years the
way he did for the last two
Olympics, especially when he's ac
complished everything there is to
accomplish in the sport. What moti
vation is left once you've already
won 16 Olympic medals and ce
mented your status as the greatest
swimmer that ever lived?

But the sport of swimming does
n't make exceptions for even the
greatest swimmer of all time, espe
cially not when it comes to having
the necessary training to compete in
the 400IM, one of the most grueling
races in the sport and an ultimate
test of a swimmer's form. Lochte
started training for the event four
years ago while Phelps didn't begin
training for it until nine months ago
(he actually didn't think he'd ever
even swim it after Beijing). In swim
ming, the times don't he and the dif
ference in their training input was
clearly shown on Saturday as
Lochte was the better swimmer in
every aspect of the race from start to
finish: speed, power, endurance, un

derwater kicks and transition turns,

Phelps' loss doesn't take away
from what he's already accom
plished by any means. He wasn't
kidding when he said that this sum
mer would be about how many top
pings he could add to his sundae. On
Tuesday, Phelps became the most
decorated Olympian of all time by
winning the 19th Olympic medal of
his career. Judging by his reaction
after being touched out by five hun
dredths of a second in the 200 fly, no
one was more disappointed in his
silver medal in his signature event
than the swimmer himself. But in
the grand scheme of things, a sec
ond-place finish isn't nearly enough
for anyone to claim that Phelps isn't
the greatest Olympian ever.

It's too early to tell whether
Phelps will actually retire or not
after the Olympics, regardless of
what he has announced publicly.
My hope is that Phelps will come
back after these Games and have
another go at it. He hates the bitter
taste of losing even more than he
loves the sweet joy of winning.
That's what makes him so great;
that's why the idea of him coming
back isn't so far-fetched.

And let's not forget that the
Phelps-Lochte rivalry isn't over
just yet. The two best swimmers in
the world will square off once again
starting on Thursday in the 200IM
a shorter event where Phelps
has a better chance of beating
Lochte. Their fierce competition in
the pool and close friendship out
side epitomize the ideal sports ri
valry that few competitors are capa
ble of embodying.
Rivalries aside, enough can't be
said about how both Phelps and
Lochte have changed the face of
swimming. They've brought an un
precedented amount of media pub
licity (see the cover of the newest
issue of Time magazine) and fan at
tention to the sport.
Phelps should be credited first
and foremost for paving the way
with his past record-breaking per
formances. Between 2000 and 2010,
participation in competitive swim
ming increased by 29.6 percent.
Michael Phelps was a huge reason
behind that. What he's done for
swimming is comparable to what
Michael Jordan did for basketball,
Wayne Gretzky for hockey,
Muhammad Ali for boxing and
Pele for soccer.
But Lochte's moment to shine
has come at last, and there's noth
ing that can stop it from happening.
It's been a long time coming for the
27-year-old swimmer, but the hard
work has finally paid off.
In the end, what we need to
come away from all of this is that
Phelps' loss shouldn't overshadow
Lochte's win. Lochte found away
to swim every lap with a purpose
driven focus every day for the last
four years. That's why he deserves
all the credit for his victory on Sat
urday. That's also why right now
there's a new undisputed king in
the world of swimming. All hail
King Lochte.

George Chen still can't believe that
Phelps was on the losing end of the
touch out in the 200 fly today.

The latest chapter of the
Michael Phelps-Ryan
Lochte rivalry, the 400-
meter individual medley
race on Saturday, was
supposed to be one of the greatest
showdowns in Olympic history. In
stead, it will be remembered as the
dramatic matchup that was not to
be.

Things seemed awry right off the
bat, when Phelps barely managed to
squeak into the final with an unchar
acteristically uncomfortable swim
in the preliminary heats. When the
finals did come, the improbable
happened; not only was Phelps
blown out of the water by his Amer
ican teammate by over four sec
onds, but the 14-time Olympic gold
medalist failed to even score a spot
on the medal podium.
Phelps' fourth-place finish in
deed may have been shocking, but
Lochte's victory wasn't. The cool,
collected Lochtenator didn't win
because Phelps had a bad day. He
won because his disciplined work
ethic and grind-it-out mentality
over the past four years finally paid
off. Lochte's victory over Phelps in
the opening event of the 2012 Sum
mer Olympics swimming segment
showed that, if nothing else, there's
no substitute for hard work.

Having swum in Phelps' shadow
for the past eight years, it isn't diffi

tion to push himself beyond mental
and physical limits in training comes
