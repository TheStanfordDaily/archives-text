## Kristian Ipsen '15 wins bronze medal in Olympic synchronized diving 
### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS DESK EDITOR 
Rising sophomore Kristian
Ipsen won a bronze medal at the
London 2012 Olympic Games in
the men's synchronized diving 3-
meter springboard event with part
ner Troy Dumais on Wednesday.

The U.S. duo finished with
446.70 points, good enough for
third place behind China's Luo
Yutong and Qin Kai, who struck
gold with 477 points, and Russia's
Ilya Zakharov and Evgeny
Kuznetsov, who took silver with
459.63 points.
Ipsen and Dumais got off to a
slow start when an average score
of 8.6 on a lower degree of diffi
culty dive left them in seventh
place after the first dive. Howev
er, the pair gradually climbed up
to fourth by the halfway point of
the event and vaulted into second
when they collected 90.09 points
on the crucial fourth dive. They
were unable to hold off the Russ
ian duo on the last two dives and
fell back down to third as the
event concluded.

Ipsen, widely touted as an up
and-coming U.S. diving star,
competed in his first Olympics.
For Dumais, London is his fourth
Olympics, but it also marks the
first time that he has managed to
win an Olympic medal. Despite
their gap in experience, the pair
was successful in major competi
tion prior to the Olympics, win
ning the 3-meter springboard
event at the 2011 U.S. National
Championships and taking silver
at the same event at the 2009
World Aquatics Championships.
During the 2011-2012 colle
giate season, Ipsen captured the
NCAA title in the individual 3-
meter springboard event and fin
ished second on the 1-meter
springboard. Ipsen became the
first Stanford diver in 82 years to
win an event at the NCAA cham
pionships. He also went unde
feated in dual meet competition.
