## ACADEMICS New program showcases strength of humanities 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
The Stanford Summer Humanities In
stitute, a faculty-run program geared to
ward high school students interested in the
humanities, ended on July 13. It was the
program's first year, and organizers are
hopeful that it can help address a perceived
"pipeline problem" in humanities at Stan
ford: the declining number of incoming un
dergraduates that have an interest in hu
manities majors.
The program, which accepted 50 rising
high school juniors and seniors from a rig
orous application process involving a writ
ing sample, letter of recommendation,
transcript and standardized exam score,
aimed to increase awareness of the
strengths of Stanford humanities both
among high schoolers and more broadly in
the community.
Debra Satz, senior associate dean of the
humanities and arts, introduced the idea of
a summer humanities program to address

the perception that Stanford is exclusively a
math and science powerhouse.
"The percentage of our applicants who
express a strong interest in the humanities
is low, only about 10 percent. One reason
for this I think is that Stanford is closely as
sociated with Silicon Valley, and many high
school students with humanities interest
look elsewhere," Satz said in an email to
The Daily. "This program is part of an ef
fort to showcase Stanford's excellent hu
manities faculty."
History Professor Caroline Winterer
and French Professor Dan Edelstein were
the program's lead faculty. In addition to
lectures, seminars and group discussions,
students went on weekly field trips to places
like the Cantor Arts Center and the San
Francisco Opera.
The institute was designed to be a col
lege-level program, and after two weeks
of lectures and discussions, students were
given a week to write a 10-page paper,
helped by undergraduate resi
dential counselors (RCs) and
graduate teaching assistants
(TAs). According to Kathryn
Vanderboll, an RC, undergradu
ates lived in the dormitories with
the students and attended their
lectures. TAs led discussion ses
sions, and both groups assisted
the students with the demanding
course load.

"I was really impressed by the
level of intellectual commitment
the professors demanded of the
students," Vanderboll said. "Pro

fessors Edelstein and Winterer re
ally expected [the students] to
think and work like college stu
dents."

Both Edelstein and Winterer
were similarly impressed with the
students' level of dedication to the
humanities.

"The really memorable experi
ence for me was how good the stu
dents got at asking questions,"
Winterer said. "By the third week,
they had just formed this wonder
ful group of really inquisitive
young scholars to a degree that re
ally surprised us."
Some students, like Jae Shin
from Temecula, Calif., found the
college-like experience invaluable
and appreciated the elevated in
tensity of the program.

"The classroom experience was
really great because it's not like the
traditional high school setting
where you just sit down and do a
lecture and go home and do home
work," she said. "You actually dis
cuss your ideas with other students
and get input from the professors."

Shin added that her favorite
part of camp was meeting new
friends, commenting on the skills
of her peers.
"All the people [here] are so
smart," Shin said. "You can talk to
them and get ideas from them, and
it's just a great place to be for inquir
ing people."
Due to its smooth first run, both
Edelstein and Winterer hope to ex
pand the program beyond the two
classes they currently offer.

"Really what we hope to do for
next year is to build, to offer more
courses in the other disciplines of the
humanities," Winterer said.
Satz agreed that the program was
an overall success in providing an
educational experience for the stu
dents. But as this was only the pro
gram's first year, the jury is still out
on whether it elevates the percep
tion of Stanford's humanities pro
gram.
"The real test of the success of
the program will depend on
whether or not its reputation grows
and we have more applicants with
humanities interests applying to
Stanford," she said.

ence for me was how good the stu
dents got at asking questions,"
Winterer said. "By the third week,
they had just formed this wonder
ful group of really inquisitive
young scholars to a degree that re
ally surprised us."
Some students, like Jae Shin
from Temecula, Calif., found the
college-like experience invaluable
and appreciated the elevated in
tensity of the program.

"The classroom experience was
really great because it's not like the
traditional high school setting
where you just sit down and do a
lecture and go home and do home
work," she said. "You actually dis
cuss your ideas with other students
and get input from the professors."

Shin added that her favorite
part of camp was meeting new
friends, commenting on the skills
of her peers.
"All the people [here] are so
smart," Shin said. "You can talk to
them and get ideas from them, and
it's just a great place to be for inquir
ing people."
Due to its smooth first run, both
Edelstein and Winterer hope to ex
pand the program beyond the two
classes they currently offer.

"Really what we hope to do for
next year is to build, to offer more
courses in the other disciplines of the
humanities," Winterer said.
Satz agreed that the program was
an overall success in providing an
educational experience for the stu
dents. But as this was only the pro
gram's first year, the jury is still out
on whether it elevates the percep
tion of Stanford's humanities pro
gram.
"The real test of the success of
the program will depend on
whether or not its reputation grows
and we have more applicants with
humanities interests applying to
Stanford," she said.
