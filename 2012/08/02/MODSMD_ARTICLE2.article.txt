## ACADEMICS New program showcases strength of humanities 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
The Stanford Summer Humanities In
stitute, a faculty-run program geared to
ward high school students interested in the
humanities, ended on July 13. It was the
program's first year, and organizers are
hopeful that it can help address a perceived
"pipeline problem" in humanities at Stan

transcript and standardized exam score,
aimed to increase awareness of the
strengths of Stanford humanities both

the community.
Debra Satz, senior associate dean of the
humanities and arts, introduced the idea of
a summer humanities program to address

the perception that Stanford is exclusively a
math and science powerhouse.

express a strong interest in the humanities
is low, only about 10 percent. One reason
for this I think is that Stanford is closely as
sociated with Silicon Valley, and many high
school students with humanities interest
look elsewhere," Satz said in an email to
The Daily. "This program is part of an ef
fort to showcase Stanford's excellent hu
manities faculty."
History Professor Caroline Winterer
and French Professor Dan Edelstein were
the program's lead faculty. In addition to
lectures, seminars and group discussions,
students went on weekly field trips to places
like the Cantor Arts Center and the San
Francisco Opera.
The institute was designed to be a col
lege-level program, and after two weeks
of lectures and discussions, students were
given a week to write a 10-page paper,
