# INTERMISSION
## ART HIDDEN GEMS In repose, guards make lasting impression

At first glance, the life-sized
photograph suggests that
the woman in the painting
is modeled after the woman seated
next to the painting, and further
inspection only supports this con
clusion. The similarities are uncan
ny: same white shirt, same peri-

winkle coat, same cropped, cop
per-colored hair. Even their facial
structures seem to correlate.
Of course, it's impossible. The
photograph one of 16 by Andy
Freeberg that constitute the Cantor
Arts Center's new exhibit,
"Guardians: Photographs by

Andy Freeberg, an Exhibition in
Three Parts" is titled
"Altman's Portrait of I.P. Degas,
State Tretyakov Gallery." The
woman portrayed in the painting
is I.P. Degas; the woman sitting
beside the painting is a nameless
guard at the Russian State

Tretyakov Gallery.
When Freeberg traveled to
Russia in 2008, his goal was to cap
ture the way in which capitalism
had transformed the formerly
communist nation. Upon visiting,
however, he changed his focus to
rest on the elderly women who
serve as museum security guards,
who appear to possess a deep pas
sion for their work despite long
hours and little pay.
Their passion as well as
Freeberg's— is apparent in
"Guardians." The photographs,
shot on a 35-millimeter digital
camera, are elegantly composed,
with gorgeous use of shadows and
negative space. But although
Freeberg, a San Francisco-based
photojournalist, has tremendous
talent, it's also inarguable that he
was given some compelling mater
ial to work with. The guards, sit
ting by the paintings entrusted to
them, are beautiful. Freeberg does
them justice.
The exhibit is divided into
three portions, with the first two,
"Antiquity to the Enlightenment"
and "19th & Early 20th Century,"
focusing on specific time periods
and the last featuring photographs
by Freeberg of Cantor's own secu
rity staff. While these images fall
short of the breathtaking beauty of
the first two sets no doubt hin
dered by the fact that, unlike the
Russian guards, Cantor's guards
are required to wear uniforms

they are nonetheless a sight to
behold. Also, it's pretty exciting
when you recognize a face (as the
woman standing next to me so
astutely noted when she asked,
"Hey, isn't that the girl from the
lobby?").
This last portion of the exhibit
is accompanied by a five-minute
documentary on Cantor's security
staff, directed by Josie Johnson 'l3
and produced by Justin Warren
'O9. The brief video has Cantor
guards reflect on their favorite
pieces of art at the museum, a
question that prompts the subjects
to launch into amusing anecdotes
on everything from Sunday school
to childhood vacations in England.
As delightful as "Guardians"
is, however, be warned: the three
parts of the exhibit are located in
three different portions of the
Cantor Arts Center, leading to
much confusion. This difficulty in
navigation is only exacerbated by
the fact that the building is current
ly undergoing some remodeling.
Arm yourself with a map, but even
so, expect to have to ask one of
Cantor's helpful guards for advice.
How fitting.
"Guardians" will be on display at
the Cantor Arts Center until Jan. 6,
2013.
