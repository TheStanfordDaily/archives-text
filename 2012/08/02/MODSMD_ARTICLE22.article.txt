						META MEDIA ANALYSIS

You know that
feeling when
you're watching
"Keeping Up with the
Kardashians" and you
really just want Kim
and Kourt to apologize

to Khloe, by far the funniest and
most verbally abused one in the
family, but that little part of you
creepily hopes Kim will leave her a
scathing voicemail, just to keep the
tension soaring? That's just like
watching the 2012 London
Olympic Games.
It all started when that Greek
triple jumper, Voula Papachristou,
posted that racist tweet and was
given the boot, apparently without
so much as an email from the
International Olympic Committee
(IOC) before or after an official
press release.
The lOC has a bunch of social
media rules, but that hasn't kept
the Twitter community at bay.
With only five days behind us,
there have already been at least
two viral hashtag uprisings, two
athletes kicked out, a fan arrested
and a (wo)mano a (wo)mano feud
not to mention that irate cam
paign against broadcast monopo
list NBC when the streaming went
awry all over Twitter. They're
starting to call it the Social Media
Olympics. And just as we waited
for the day that scandal would
fracture the seemingly impreg
nable RobSten (pun intended), so
too do we await the eruption that
is the ticking time bomb of the
2012 Olympics.
This is what makes all the
press coverage of the Social Media
Olympics so absurd. The Olympics
are not just a sporting event;
they're apparently a magical sum
mer solstice by which the hallowed
rings of ancient Olympia touch

down onto our terra firma, sus
pending all global alliances, unath
leticism, broadband service and,
above all, sense of propriety. This
is not a sporting event; it's a spec
tacle. So if you don't want to see
Kim call Khloe a fat bitch and you
think that the Olympic athletes
should shut up and just stick the
landing, you clearly don't under
stand the genre.
Yeah, you might cheer for a
gladiator, but you're really watch
ing to see a lion bite off a torso.
Now, in our civilized society, we
want social pariahs and public
intra-national rivalries. This is
what we watch for. We want to see
athletes as enemies Michael
Phelps giving Ryan Lochte a
loaded, evil grin, or a huge
women's gymnastics upset. We
want to see the photo of that sad
South Korean fencer fighting
because a timer got reset. And we
want Usain Bolt to be pissed
even just a little that he got beat
out by none other than his own
teammate, Yohan Blake. And if
not that, at least for him to stop
trying to say they aren't nemeses in
a Professor Xavier/Magneto used
to-play-for-the-same-team-but-
are-now-enemies-unless-the-bat-

tle-is-against-everyone-else way.
And here, "everyone else" should
mean the Bolt/Yohan trash talking,
victory dancing against all those
other measly runners but
instead they're taking it out on us!
The loyal, cable-provider-paying
fans who just want to see a good
show!

Because, news flash to the ath
letes, the lOC, NBC, etc. this is
what makes the Olympics happen!
Yeah, we watch for sports, but
these idolized, sensationalized cele
brathletes are what make it an

event. It's what pays the bills, gets

an over $l4 billion budget for
London to lay a track down and
blocks programming across NBC
for an entire week. So stop com
plaining and play your characters!
If we wanted silent athletes with no
mouths and no glory, we would
have watched jai alai or competi
tive backgammon.
Even reaching back to the
ancient Greek Olympics, excite
ment was all in the subtle dramas
of the nations. For the Olympic
Games, countries would call a
truce so that their players could
journey to the games without fear
of ambush, and the winners were
considered heroes in their home
lands. These bragging rights are
what make all those McDonald's
commercials worthwhile (not the
P&G mom one though that
one gets us every time). And the
way America managed to make it
American to root for both the

hegemonic champion (Phelps)
and the semi-underdog (Lochte)
in just one event is a PR/athletic
gold medal right there.
So keep doing what you're
doing, Olympic athletes! Win
races, pump iron and get yourself
involved in a tweeting scandal or
announce your virginity. Or better
yet both.

for the first time since the 2010
Winter Olympics, has not watched
any Olympic programming except
an early round of women's indoor
volleyball.
