## TUMBLING DOWN 'Jericho' starts strong, stumbles by end of show

There's not a lot of summer
TV that I keep up with reg
ularly, so the break is a
good chance to catch up on my
backlog. Despite the amount of TV
I watch, there are always many very
popular, critically-acclaimed shows
that manage to slip through the
cracks, including "The Wire,"
"Game of Thrones" and "Breaking
Bad." What caught my attention
first this summer, however, was
"Jericho," a show from 2006 whose
fan base did what few manage to do
get the show renewed after it
was already canceled (albeit only
for a very abbreviated second and
final season).
Set in the fictional town of
Jericho, Kan., the show takes place
shortly after a series of nuclear
explosions devastate the country.
Isolated from most of civilization,
the people of Jericho deal with the
fallout (both literal and metaphori
cal) of the bombs, as one disaster
after another threatens their lives.
At the center of the series is the
Green family, made up of

Johnston, the father and mayor of
the town; his wife, Gail; and their
two sons, Eric and Jake, the latter of

whom left Jericho years ago under
tense circumstances but manages to
take charge when the bombs strand
him back home. They're surround
ed by a fairly believable cast of char
acters who either join them in tak
ing charge or let their panic and

worry take over their lives.
At the risk of hyperbole, I hon
estly think the first few episodes are
just short of flawless. There's an
interesting tension at work here

between the characters' relation
ships and more immediate cata
strophes, and the writers walk this
balance with finesse rarely seen in
TV writing. In some respects, it
reminds me a lot of early "Lost"
episodes (the only "Lost" I've seen)
the pressing need to survive
pushes the characters forward but
weaves in and out seamlessly with
inter- and intrapersonal conflicts,
each serving as a backdrop to the
other. When handled well, it's a
compelling combination and it's
certainly handled well here.
Unfortunately, as some of the
more pressing ramifications of the
