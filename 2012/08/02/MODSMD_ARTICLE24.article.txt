If you're looking for some clever but easy
and upbeat viewing, here's a list of five
great comedies from throughout the
ages from the 1930s to the last couple of
years on Netflix that should be moved up
to the top of your queue.
"Gregory's Girl"
Bill Forsyth's 1981 film "Gregory's Girl"
still holds its own in the canon of great teen

comedies, and it predates all the John
Hughes classics. It takes place in a small
Scottish town where gangly, gawky 16-year
old Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) thinks
he has fallen in love with the latest addition
to his previously all-boys school soccer team,
Dorothy (Dee Hepburn). While he suffers
through love, we meet delightful characters:
Steve, his enterprising friend who cooks deli
cious treats for the school principal and sells

them to the students; his driving instructor
father who offers Gregory lessons "after he
masters the walking bit"; his wise-beyond
her-years younger sister who explains to him
the importance of color; the lecherous teach
ers; and Susan, the brunette that all the boys
like but who is smitten with Gregory's awk
ward charm. When Gregory finally lands a
date with Dorothy, it goes and ends in a very
unexpected way, leading his sister to pro
nounce, "It's hard work being in love, espe
cially when you don't know which girl it is."

"Kissing Jessica Stein"
"Kissing Jessica Stein" is somewhat of a
cross between "When Harry Met Sally" and
"Annie Hall" if both of the romantic
leads were women. Neurotic, high-strung

Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) has been having
a rough time on the dating scene, and we see
her go through a series of unworthy suitors.
One calis himself a "pretty self-defecating
guy"; another divides up their bill by cost of
salad ingredients and amount of cheese
eaten and then requests to be her boyfriend
and accountant. When Helen's (Heather
Juergensen) woman-seeking-woman ad uses
Jessica's favorite quote, Jessica finds herself
answering it and awkwardly pursuing a
same-sex relationship. They are clearly kin
dred spirits from the start, but the fact that
Jessica is very, very straight gets in the way:
there's a hilarious scene on one of their first
dates where Jessica pulls out a stack of pam
phlets on same-sex sex, declaring "I didn't
know lesbians accessorized!" When the film

came out in 2001, it was seen as racy subject
matter, but the movie handles it all with
class and wit and can safely hold its own
among the best romantic comedies.

"In the Loop"
The uproariously funny 2009 political
satire "In the Loop" passed largely under the
radar, but this British black comedy is a

must-see. When Simon Foster (Tom
Hollander), the British minister for interna
tional development makes the incendiary
statement that war in the Middle East is

"unforeseeable," followed by a slip that "we
have to climb the mountain of conflict," the
prime minister's foul-mouthed enforcer
Malcolm (Peter Capaldi) is called in to
defuse the situation. Meanwhile, members
of the U.S. State Department are visiting the
U.K., and Simon's comments cause U.S.

Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy Karen
Clark (Mimi Kennedy) to send her aid
(Anna Chlumsky) to discover the secret war
committee: "Just find the one with the most
boring name." In the end, everyone starts
using Simon's misbegotten words for their
own agenda, and absurdist comedy so
long as you don't think too much about
how very real it is ensues with high-speed
dialogue.

"His Girl Friday"
Howard Hawks' screwball comedy "His
Girl Friday" may have been made in the
19305, but it features some of the quickest
and best banter ever put on screen and has
stood the test of time. Cary Grant and
Rosalind Russell star as a pair of divorced
lovers and newspapermen who can't help
loving each other despite their animosity.
When Russell shows up at Grant's office to

let him know she is getting remarried and
leaving New York, he hatches a plan to
remind her that she can't live without the
newspaper business and, by extension, him.
It's clear from the beginning that Russell's
fiance is no intellectual match for her, nor is
he capable of handling her spirit she is
modern by today's standards so even
though we know where this is going, it's a
brilliant and hilarious ride to get there.
"Much Ado About Nothing"
Kenneth Branagh's rendition of the
Bard's light comedy "Much Ado About
Nothing" comes close to perfection.

Branagh stars as Benedick alongside Emma
Thompson's Beatrice, as the warring duo
falls out of hate and into love. Along with
the flawless banter between Branagh and
Thompson, the film is perfectly cast with
now-famous actors like Denzel Washington,
who exudes charm and class, the perfect
combination for Don Pedro; Kate Beckinsale
as the bashful Hero; Robert Sean Leonard as
her doting suitor Claudio; Imelda Staunton
as the wanton maid Margaret; and Michael
Keaton as the rascal Dogberry.

It's clear from the beginning that Russell's
fiance is no intellectual match for her, nor is
he capable of handling her spirit she is
modern by today's standards so even
though we know where this is going, it's a
brilliant and hilarious ride to get there.
"Much Ado About Nothing"
Kenneth Branagh's rendition of the
Bard's light comedy "Much Ado About
Nothing" comes close to perfection.

Branagh stars as Benedick alongside Emma
Thompson's Beatrice, as the warring duo
falls out of hate and into love. Along with
the flawless banter between Branagh and
Thompson, the film is perfectly cast with
now-famous actors like Denzel Washington,
who exudes charm and class, the perfect
combination for Don Pedro; Kate Beckinsale
as the bashful Hero; Robert Sean Leonard as
her doting suitor Claudio; Imelda Staunton
as the wanton maid Margaret; and Michael
Keaton as the rascal Dogberry.

Mimi Kennedy as Karen and James Gandolfini as General Miller in "In the Loop,"
a political satire centered around events leading up to the Iraq War.
If you're looking for some clever but easy
and upbeat viewing, here's a list of five
great comedies from throughout the
ages from the 1930s to the last couple of
years on Netflix that should be moved up
to the top of your queue.
"Gregory's Girl"
Bill Forsyth's 1981 film "Gregory's Girl"
still holds its own in the canon of great teen

comedies, and it predates all the John
Hughes classics. It takes place in a small
Scottish town where gangly, gawky 16-year
old Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) thinks
he has fallen in love with the latest addition
to his previously all-boys school soccer team,
Dorothy (Dee Hepburn). While he suffers
through love, we meet delightful characters:
Steve, his enterprising friend who cooks deli
cious treats for the school principal and sells

them to the students; his driving instructor
father who offers Gregory lessons "after he
masters the walking bit"; his wise-beyond
her-years younger sister who explains to him
the importance of color; the lecherous teach
ers; and Susan, the brunette that all the boys
like but who is smitten with Gregory's awk
ward charm. When Gregory finally lands a
date with Dorothy, it goes and ends in a very
unexpected way, leading his sister to pro
nounce, "It's hard work being in love, espe
cially when you don't know which girl it is."

"Kissing Jessica Stein"
"Kissing Jessica Stein" is somewhat of a
cross between "When Harry Met Sally" and
"Annie Hall" if both of the romantic
leads were women. Neurotic, high-strung

Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) has been having
a rough time on the dating scene, and we see
her go through a series of unworthy suitors.
One calis himself a "pretty self-defecating
guy"; another divides up their bill by cost of
salad ingredients and amount of cheese
eaten and then requests to be her boyfriend
and accountant. When Helen's (Heather
Juergensen) woman-seeking-woman ad uses
Jessica's favorite quote, Jessica finds herself
answering it and awkwardly pursuing a
same-sex relationship. They are clearly kin
dred spirits from the start, but the fact that
Jessica is very, very straight gets in the way:
there's a hilarious scene on one of their first
dates where Jessica pulls out a stack of pam
phlets on same-sex sex, declaring "I didn't
know lesbians accessorized!" When the film

came out in 2001, it was seen as racy subject
matter, but the movie handles it all with
class and wit and can safely hold its own
among the best romantic comedies.

"In the Loop"
The uproariously funny 2009 political
satire "In the Loop" passed largely under the
radar, but this British black comedy is a

must-see. When Simon Foster (Tom
Hollander), the British minister for interna
tional development makes the incendiary
statement that war in the Middle East is

"unforeseeable," followed by a slip that "we
have to climb the mountain of conflict," the
prime minister's foul-mouthed enforcer
Malcolm (Peter Capaldi) is called in to
defuse the situation. Meanwhile, members
of the U.S. State Department are visiting the
U.K., and Simon's comments cause U.S.

Assistant Secretary of Diplomacy Karen
Clark (Mimi Kennedy) to send her aid
(Anna Chlumsky) to discover the secret war
committee: "Just find the one with the most
boring name." In the end, everyone starts
using Simon's misbegotten words for their
own agenda, and absurdist comedy so
long as you don't think too much about
how very real it is ensues with high-speed
dialogue.

"His Girl Friday"
Howard Hawks' screwball comedy "His
Girl Friday" may have been made in the
19305, but it features some of the quickest
and best banter ever put on screen and has
stood the test of time. Cary Grant and
Rosalind Russell star as a pair of divorced
lovers and newspapermen who can't help
loving each other despite their animosity.
When Russell shows up at Grant's office to

let him know she is getting remarried and
leaving New York, he hatches a plan to
remind her that she can't live without the
newspaper business and, by extension, him.
It's clear from the beginning that Russell's
fiance is no intellectual match for her, nor is
he capable of handling her spirit she is
modern by today's standards so even
though we know where this is going, it's a
brilliant and hilarious ride to get there.
