If you're looking for some clever but easy
and upbeat viewing, here's a list of five
great comedies from throughout the
ages from the 1930s to the last couple of
years on Netflix that should be moved up
to the top of your queue.
"Gregory's Girl"
Bill Forsyth's 1981 film "Gregory's Girl"
still holds its own in the canon of great teen

comedies, and it predates all the John
Hughes classics. It takes place in a small
Scottish town where gangly, gawky 16-year
old Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) thinks
he has fallen in love with the latest addition
to his previously all-boys school soccer team,
Dorothy (Dee Hepburn). While he suffers
through love, we meet delightful characters:
Steve, his enterprising friend who cooks deli
cious treats for the school principal and sells

them to the students; his driving instructor
father who offers Gregory lessons "after he
masters the walking bit"; his wise-beyond
her-years younger sister who explains to him
the importance of color; the lecherous teach
ers; and Susan, the brunette that all the boys
like but who is smitten with Gregory's awk
ward charm. When Gregory finally lands a
date with Dorothy, it goes and ends in a very
unexpected way, leading his sister to pro
nounce, "It's hard work being in love, espe
cially when you don't know which girl it is."

"Kissing Jessica Stein"
"Kissing Jessica Stein" is somewhat of a
cross between "When Harry Met Sally" and
"Annie Hall" if both of the romantic
leads were women. Neurotic, high-strung

Jessica (Jennifer Westfeldt) has been having
a rough time on the dating scene, and we see
her go through a series of unworthy suitors.
One calis himself a "pretty self-defecating
guy"; another divides up their bill by cost of
salad ingredients and amount of cheese
eaten and then requests to be her boyfriend
and accountant. When Helen's (Heather
Juergensen) woman-seeking-woman ad uses
Jessica's favorite quote, Jessica finds herself
answering it and awkwardly pursuing a
same-sex relationship. They are clearly kin
dred spirits from the start, but the fact that
Jessica is very, very straight gets in the way:
there's a hilarious scene on one of their first
