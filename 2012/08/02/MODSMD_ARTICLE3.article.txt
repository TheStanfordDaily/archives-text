### KLAIRE TAN DAILY INTERN 
145 senior executives have gathered to par
ticipate in the 60th annual Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), a six-week management pro
gram at the Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB).
SEP costs $58,000 per student and fea
tures a general management curriculum that
covers a wide variety of topics. According to
GSB Director of Programs and Marketing
Kriss Craig, SEP connects senior executives
from global companies, government agen
cies and nonprofit organizations spanning 40
different countries and 30 different indus
tries.
"Classes take place in classrooms and audi
toriums on the Knight Management Center
Graduate School of Business campus," Craig
said. "All of the executives in SEP are housed
at the Schwab Residential Center. With the
exception of special off-site events, all meals
are served there as well."
In a matter of six weeks, SEP quickly covers
a wide range of topics, including finance, orga
nizational behavior, risk management and cor
porate governance. According to Craig, execu
tives are engaged in program activities for five
to seven hours a day. Participants also spend
time outside of classroom sessions reviewing
and preparing material in study groups.
Even by a professor's standards, the vast
amount of course material makes the program
challenging. According to GSB finance pro
fessor Iyla Strebulaev, this course's breadth is

necessary for the growth of participants.
"What's really important is the well-round
ed approach we take that allows [participants]
to develop a change in themselves in so many
ways," Strebulaev said. "Participants get the
most recent and fundamental insights in so
many subjects that are directly relevant to
what they do. It enables them to broaden their
perspectives."
SEP's curriculum also helps executives re
evaluate and better understand the strategies
which they have used for years in their fields,
according to program participant Carlos Ter
res, the commercial director of Holcim, a
building materials company.
"When you come to the program, you've
usually already been working for 15 years,"
Terres said. "We often don't know the why be
hind what we work on and develop. The con
tent exposes us to the theory and science be
hind what we do and helps us push our strate
gies forward in a much more effective way."
The program also hosts guest speakers like
former Intel CEO Andrew Grove and former
Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and
George P. Shultz.
"Our guest speakers are experts in their
fields or top executives in their organizations;
they bring relevant and immediate insight to
the participants," Craig said.
While Terres attests to the quality and effi
cacy of the program, it is not just the content
that gives SEP its high reputation in the corpo
rate world, he said. According to Terres, the
