## TeachAIDS uses animation to educate the world about HIV 
### KYLIE JUE DAILY INTERN 
"They say when you find work that you
love, you never work a day in your life.
That's what it's like for me."
When founder and CEO of
TeachAlDS, Piya Sorcar M.A. 'O6 Ph.D.
'O9, describes her job, the passion in her
voice is unmistakable.

Started in 2005, TeachAlDS is a non
profit organization that grew from Sorcar's
graduate research here at Stanford. Having
earned her master's degree in Learning,
Design and Technology and her Ph.D. in
the fields of Learning Science and Technol
ogy Design and International Comparative
Education, she used her interdisciplinary
background to solve a problem from her

native country, India: HIV/AIDS educa
tion and prevention.
"Millions of dollars were poured into ef
forts [in India], but... it turned out that
sex education was banned in some states,
and even in states where it was not explicit
ly banned, educators were afraid to teach
it," Sorcar said. "We wanted to look at
ways to teach AIDS education without
covering [such] taboo topics of death and
sex."

When Sorcar began posting her work
online, she received a huge response from
the global community saying that AIDS
education was a problem everywhere. As a
result, TeachAlDS started to develop ma
terials for countries other than India.

"The idea was to create the best, most
comprehensive AIDS education while by

passing those problems [of social stigmas]
and making the teaching software available
for free," she said. "We work with govern
ments to get it into the school systems,
NGOs and corporations. And [these
groups] don't have to get [government]
permission to use them. They're available
under a creative common license."
After Sorcar finished her studies at
Stanford, TeachAlDS formally partnered
with the University, and now the organiza
tion conducts all of its research on the
Farm. Sorcar has formed a team of diverse
members, some of whom are Stanford affil
iates, to figure out different ways to edu
cate individuals across the world about
AIDS prevention. For example, co
founder of TeachAlDS and Stanford Com
munication professor Clifford Nass spe

cializes on the psychology of how people
use technology, a field of research that pro
vided him with the tools to test how people
respond to different types of AIDS educa
tion. Nass says that Sorcar employed the
help of a multitude of individuals to focus
on specific aspects of the project.
"I was involved in a lot of the design de
cisions," said Nass. "She had separate peo
ple who specialized in the content, [and]
she got people from the medical school to
help with all the science and to make sure
everything was accurate."
Through easy-to-understand anima
tions tailored to specific cultures and eth
nicities, Teach AIDS focuses on AIDS pre
vention education. With comprehensive
testing, the organization en
sures that kids understand
every aspect of the animated
curriculum, including the char
acters, analogies and
metaphors involved in the
media.
TeachAlDS' success stems
from its animations' unique ap
proach toward AIDS educa
tion, namely coupling biology
based explanations with cultur
al euphemisms.
"Every single piece of the
process is research-based," Sor
car said. "In the pilot versions,
we used voices in the right ac
cents of people from those areas.
[Nass'] research on voice inter
faces shows that people learn
more when they're listening to
voices that they can relate to."
The final productions of the
animations, however, use voic
es of celebrities local to the
countries in which the videos
will be shown. Recruiting these
stars has been a huge accom
plishment for the organization,
and the software's "2-D, Dis
ney-style characters" often re
semble the celebrities.
"When I first heard about
TeachAlDS, I knew it was ex
actly what our country needed
to fight against the tremendous
HIV plague we are facing," said
"Idols East Africa" judge
Thato "Scar" Matlhabaphiri.
"Launching these animations
and making them available for
free is a huge step in increasing
knowledge and curbing infec
tion rates. I feel honored to be
part of this historical moment."
Still, despite the progress the
group has made in its work pro
moting AIDS education, Sor

car insists that it's no easy task.
"At the end of the day, it's
not easy to teach about this
topic," she said. "The charac
ters have to feel like they're
from that cultural context, and
the language can't be too book
ish. Even when we're dissemi
nating the materials, we work
with all these organizations that
people trust and that are al
ready in those countries."
Although the original target
audience had been young peo
ple, the program has since ex
panded to include individuals
of all ages and walks of life.
From military doctors educat
ing soldiers to corporations ed
ucating employees, individuals
of all ages and backgrounds
have watched the animations;
even prisons and rehabilitation
centers have used them.

"It works even in places
where it isn't taboo," Nass said.
"It's an extremely well-de
signed and effective program."

In fact, the program is so
well-designed that Sorcar was
recognized in 2011 by the MIT
Technology Review, which
gives 35 awards each year to in
novators under the age of 35 for
transforming technology.
The company's next goal is
to create versions of its anima
tions in more than 80 lan
guages; if successful, it will be
able to account for the lan
guages of individuals from
more than 90 percent of the
world's HIV and AIDS cases.
The company has also been
asked about creating similar tu
torials for topics like tuberculo
sis and malaria.

"When I graduated [from
Stanford] in 2009,
[TeachAlDS] was in five coun
tries," Sorcar said. "Now the
materials are used in 72 coun
tries. The growth is incredible."

Piya Sorcar, a Stanford grad, is the founder of TeachAIDS, an organization that creates animations to teach others about AIDS.
"They say when you find work that you
love, you never work a day in your life.
That's what it's like for me."
When founder and CEO of
TeachAlDS, Piya Sorcar M.A. 'O6 Ph.D.
'O9, describes her job, the passion in her
voice is unmistakable.

Started in 2005, TeachAlDS is a non
profit organization that grew from Sorcar's
graduate research here at Stanford. Having
earned her master's degree in Learning,
Design and Technology and her Ph.D. in
the fields of Learning Science and Technol
ogy Design and International Comparative
Education, she used her interdisciplinary
background to solve a problem from her

native country, India: HIV/AIDS educa
tion and prevention.
"Millions of dollars were poured into ef
forts [in India], but... it turned out that
sex education was banned in some states,
and even in states where it was not explicit
ly banned, educators were afraid to teach
it," Sorcar said. "We wanted to look at
ways to teach AIDS education without
covering [such] taboo topics of death and
sex."

When Sorcar began posting her work
online, she received a huge response from
the global community saying that AIDS
education was a problem everywhere. As a
result, TeachAlDS started to develop ma
terials for countries other than India.

"The idea was to create the best, most
comprehensive AIDS education while by

passing those problems [of social stigmas]
and making the teaching software available
for free," she said. "We work with govern
ments to get it into the school systems,
NGOs and corporations. And [these
groups] don't have to get [government]
permission to use them. They're available
under a creative common license."
After Sorcar finished her studies at
Stanford, TeachAlDS formally partnered
with the University, and now the organiza
tion conducts all of its research on the
Farm. Sorcar has formed a team of diverse
members, some of whom are Stanford affil
iates, to figure out different ways to edu
cate individuals across the world about
AIDS prevention. For example, co
founder of TeachAlDS and Stanford Com
munication professor Clifford Nass spe

cializes on the psychology of how people
use technology, a field of research that pro
vided him with the tools to test how people
respond to different types of AIDS educa
tion. Nass says that Sorcar employed the
help of a multitude of individuals to focus
on specific aspects of the project.
"I was involved in a lot of the design de
cisions," said Nass. "She had separate peo
ple who specialized in the content, [and]
she got people from the medical school to
help with all the science and to make sure
everything was accurate."
Through easy-to-understand anima
tions tailored to specific cultures and eth
nicities, Teach AIDS focuses on AIDS pre
vention education. With comprehensive
testing, the organization en
sures that kids understand
every aspect of the animated
curriculum, including the char
acters, analogies and
metaphors involved in the
media.
TeachAlDS' success stems
from its animations' unique ap
proach toward AIDS educa
tion, namely coupling biology
based explanations with cultur
al euphemisms.
"Every single piece of the
process is research-based," Sor
car said. "In the pilot versions,
we used voices in the right ac
cents of people from those areas.
[Nass'] research on voice inter
faces shows that people learn
more when they're listening to
voices that they can relate to."
The final productions of the
animations, however, use voic
es of celebrities local to the
countries in which the videos
will be shown. Recruiting these
stars has been a huge accom
plishment for the organization,
and the software's "2-D, Dis
ney-style characters" often re
semble the celebrities.
"When I first heard about
TeachAlDS, I knew it was ex
actly what our country needed
to fight against the tremendous
HIV plague we are facing," said
"Idols East Africa" judge
Thato "Scar" Matlhabaphiri.
"Launching these animations
and making them available for
free is a huge step in increasing
knowledge and curbing infec
tion rates. I feel honored to be
part of this historical moment."
Still, despite the progress the
group has made in its work pro
moting AIDS education, Sor

car insists that it's no easy task.
"At the end of the day, it's
not easy to teach about this
topic," she said. "The charac
ters have to feel like they're
from that cultural context, and
the language can't be too book
ish. Even when we're dissemi
nating the materials, we work
with all these organizations that
people trust and that are al
ready in those countries."
Although the original target
audience had been young peo
ple, the program has since ex
panded to include individuals
of all ages and walks of life.
From military doctors educat
ing soldiers to corporations ed
ucating employees, individuals
of all ages and backgrounds
have watched the animations;
even prisons and rehabilitation
centers have used them.

"It works even in places
where it isn't taboo," Nass said.
"It's an extremely well-de
signed and effective program."

In fact, the program is so
well-designed that Sorcar was
recognized in 2011 by the MIT
Technology Review, which
gives 35 awards each year to in
novators under the age of 35 for
transforming technology.
The company's next goal is
to create versions of its anima
tions in more than 80 lan
guages; if successful, it will be
able to account for the lan
guages of individuals from
more than 90 percent of the
world's HIV and AIDS cases.
The company has also been
asked about creating similar tu
torials for topics like tuberculo
sis and malaria.

"When I graduated [from
Stanford] in 2009,
[TeachAlDS] was in five coun
tries," Sorcar said. "Now the
materials are used in 72 coun
tries. The growth is incredible."
