"They say when you find work that you
love, you never work a day in your life.
That's what it's like for me."
When founder and CEO of
TeachAlDS, Piya Sorcar M.A. 'O6 Ph.D.
'O9, describes her job, the passion in her
voice is unmistakable.

Started in 2005, TeachAlDS is a non
profit organization that grew from Sorcar's
graduate research here at Stanford. Having
earned her master's degree in Learning,
Design and Technology and her Ph.D. in
the fields of Learning Science and Technol
ogy Design and International Comparative
Education, she used her interdisciplinary
background to solve a problem from her

native country, India: HIV/AIDS educa
tion and prevention.
"Millions of dollars were poured into ef
forts [in India], but... it turned out that
sex education was banned in some states,
and even in states where it was not explicit
ly banned, educators were afraid to teach
it," Sorcar said. "We wanted to look at
ways to teach AIDS education without
covering [such] taboo topics of death and
sex."

When Sorcar began posting her work
online, she received a huge response from
the global community saying that AIDS
education was a problem everywhere. As a
result, TeachAlDS started to develop ma
terials for countries other than India.

"The idea was to create the best, most
comprehensive AIDS education while by

passing those problems [of social stigmas]
and making the teaching software available
for free," she said. "We work with govern
ments to get it into the school systems,
NGOs and corporations. And [these
groups] don't have to get [government]
permission to use them. They're available
under a creative common license."
After Sorcar finished her studies at
Stanford, TeachAlDS formally partnered
with the University, and now the organiza
tion conducts all of its research on the
Farm. Sorcar has formed a team of diverse
members, some of whom are Stanford affil
iates, to figure out different ways to edu
cate individuals across the world about
AIDS prevention. For example, co
founder of TeachAlDS and Stanford Com
munication professor Clifford Nass spe

cializes on the psychology of how people
use technology, a field of research that pro
vided him with the tools to test how people
respond to different types of AIDS educa
tion. Nass says that Sorcar employed the
help of a multitude of individuals to focus
on specific aspects of the project.
"I was involved in a lot of the design de
cisions," said Nass. "She had separate peo
ple who specialized in the content, [and]
she got people from the medical school to
help with all the science and to make sure
everything was accurate."
Through easy-to-understand anima
tions tailored to specific cultures and eth
nicities, Teach AIDS focuses on AIDS pre
vention education. With comprehensive
