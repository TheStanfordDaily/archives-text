## A 						guide to Stanford startups 
### AMRUTHA DORAI DAILY INTERN 
Stanford University, with its array
of resources and location in Silicon
Valley, is a breeding ground of stu
dent creativity and technological in
novation. Not surprisingly, it has
been home to a number of startups
over the past several years. Twenty
four of these have been helped along
the way by StartX, or the Stanford
Student Startup Accelerator, which
provides Stanford student entrepre
neurs with advice and resources to
get their organizations off the
ground. Here, we take a look at a few
of the most recent of these StartX-in
cubated startups.
WiFiSLAM
By 2011, WiFiSLAM co
founders Joseph Huang M. A. 'll and
Dave Millman M.A. 'lO had already
nearly founded their startup. During
their graduate studies at Stanford,
they developed an indoor positioning
technology able to pinpoint an indi
vidual's exact location in order to find
coupons for various nearby vendors.
The only question was how to com
mercialize their idea.
With the help of co-founders Jes
sica Tsoong M.A. 'll, whom Huang
had met through a class on tech ven
ture formation, and Darin Tay, one
of Huang's classmates from his un
dergraduate education at the Univer
sity of Waterloo and a current
Google employee, WiFiSLAM was
launched.
"We decided to start the company
as we were all finishing our master's
programs, and our goal was to com
mercialize [this] indoor positioning
technology," Tsoong said in an email.
According to WiFiSLAM's web
site, it provides users with a variety of
functions, including indoor naviga
tion, location-based coupons and
gaming, automated check-ins and in
store product search.
"We have made significant
progress to date â€”we have released
our indoor positioning API and have
begun integrations with a variety of
mobile applications," Tsoong said.
"We have essentially built a location
platform for any mobile application
to use our indoor positioning."
6Dot

For 6Dot co-founder Karina
Pikhart M. A.'l 2, the assignment was
this: solve a problem at home. The
prompt was that unspecific and open
ended.

Pikhart, at the time taking a de
sign class during her senior year at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, found it eye-opening.
"[ln this class,] we came across
this experience that many blind indi
viduals have, which is trouble locat
ing or identifying or distinguishing
between very common items, like
medication or canned foods,"
Pikhart said. "A lot of the tools that
are available to attempt to solve
those problems are pretty dissatisfy
ing to use."

Her in-class team designed and
prototyped a product that would
hopefully solve this problem more ef
fectively: a Braille labeler. After
moving to Palo Alto to attend gradu
ate school at Stanford, Pikhart
teamed up with Silicon Valley-based
engineers and fellow 6Dot co
founders Robert Liebert and
Raphael Hyde to create a startup that
would make the Braille labeler wide
ly available.
"[Our] aim is to provide tools or
bring independence to the blind and
people with other disabilities, and
help people reach their full potential

through developing innovative tech
nology," Pikhart said.
It hasn't been an easy road,
though; 6Dot has faced numerous
difficulties, from assembling the right
team to creating a sustainable busi
ness plan to actually making the jump
from prototyping their idea to manu
facturing it. After years of work,
6Dot put out its first Braille labelers
in 2012. However, Pikhart is still hes
itant to say that they've reached their
goals.

"We're a long way off from being
successful at meeting that goal,"
Pikhart said. "The vision of wanting
disability to not be seen as a disabili
ty, the vision of wanting assisted tech
nology to just look like any other
technology is a long ways out."
Jetlore

We use it as a verb now: "Google "
this, "Google" that, "Google" any
thing and everything.

If Eldar Sadikov, a Stanford
Ph.D. candidate in computer science,
has his way, "Google" may soon be
replaced with the name of his compa
ny: Jetlore.
Sadikov and his co-founder,
Montse Medina, a Stanford Ph.D.
candidate in mathematical engi
neering, founded Jetlore in January
2011 in order to create a smarter
search engine for consumers. Jet
lore, by using a social content aggre
gator called Qwhisper, personalizes
results according to user's activities
on social networking sites such as
Facebook and Twitter.

"The big vision from the very be
ginning was that we wanted to help
any consumer out there... be able
to [use] social content in decision
making," Sadikov said.
While this vision may have re
mained unwavering since Jetlore's
initial launching, their methodology

has changed drastically. At first,
Sadikov and Medina created a pro
totype that would refer you to
someone likely to have the desired
information. The example Sadikov
provides is of someone wanting to
purchase tickets to a Giants game
but wondering where to find the
best seats. The prototype would dig
through previous Facebook or
Twitter posts to pinpoint the friend
most likely to have answers. But
then the startup's staff originally
composed of just Sadikov and Medi
na but now extended to include six
others had a revelation.

"Rather than having people pro
vide the information, a lot of the in
formation is already out there, al
ready among the Facebook posts
and the Twitter posts," Sadikov said.
"And we can show the existing in
formation rather than helping peo
ple find the [right] person. We start-

Ed working on really understanding
content."

Other companies have attempt
ed similar feats before, but it's not an
easy task: much of the content on so
cial networking sites is so colloquial
and unstructured that designing an
algorithm capable of decoding it re
quires a herculean effort. But Jet
lore has thus far been successful, and
it hopes to extend this success in the
future.
"I think that's where our future
is, sort of making companies' con
sumer services smarter, allowing
them to personalize the experience
for users and bring in the context
they need that's really the future
of search," Sadikov said. "And I
think that's why we see ourselves as
the next big search company."
