## Carbon-neutral methane produced 
### JACQUELINE GU DAILY INTERN 
Stanford Microbiology professor Alfred
Spormann has partnered with Penn State Uni
versity professor Bruce Logan to find a ground
breaking me thod of creating carbon-neutral, re
newable methane gas. The process, which uses
microbes as a catalyst, only requires electricity to
convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into pure
methane, the primary ingredient in natural gas.

To conduct this research, Spormann's lab is
raising colonies of bacteria, called methanogens,
which use electrical energy to transform atmos
pheric carbon dioxide into methane. According
to Spormann, there is potential to develop a new
technology based on the activity of microbial
factories converting electrical energy to chemi
cal energy.

"It has significant implications for green en
ergy technologies," Spormann said. "It's a tech
nology that allows [us] to substitute fossil chem
icals, chemicals derived from fossil fuels, which
the chemical industry heavily relies on, with
chemicals synthesized from atmospheric carbon
dioxide."

This process of converting electricity to
methane involves bacteria that can generate
electrical currents in microbial fuel cells, which
are fuel cells that use bacteria instead of hydro

gen and precious metals like platinum, elements
needed to catalyze regular fuel cells.
"The entire process is cyclical," Spormann
explained. "The carbon dioxide used to make
methane is derived from the atmosphere, and
once you combust methane, you release the car
bon dioxide again."

Because the carbon dioxide is recycled, the
process is entirely carbon-neutral. The
methanogens dine on atmospheric carbon diox
ide and electricity, converting them efficiently
into methane.

"When you're using chemical catalysts [to
generate methane] you tend to get a lot of side
product, and the system isn't self-sustaining; it
needs high temperatures or precious metal cata
lysts," Logan said. "Here the microbes are the
catalysts and they make only methane."
The researchers envision a cost-effective sys

tem that will be able to produce clean methane
used to fuel ships, airplanes and other vehicles.
Ideally, cultures of methanogens would be fed
electricity as they metabolized carbon dioxide
into methane.

"The goal is to turn a source of reusable elec
trical power into methane it's away of either
creating a fuel that would be used in vehicles or
storing energy in the form of methane," Logan
said. "The idea is to create something useful in
our current energy infrastructure."
Currently, Spormann and Logan are work
ing on cultivating the methanogens and optimiz
ing the process. They are trying to engineer the
system to maximize its effect and understand the
fundamentals of the process.

"We need to understand the fundamental
science behind the process and then
see how we can scale it up to a process
where we can produce cubic meters
of methane every day," Spormann
said.

Logan emphasizes the need to
build on their research before renew
able methane becomes a part of our
everyday lives.
"Weknowhowto [create carbon
neutral methane], but we don't know
how to economically do it or how to
optimize the process," Logan said.
"We need to make it work better and
we need to make it work cheaper. We
need to make this inexpensive and
useful."
