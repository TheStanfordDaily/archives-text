## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN The
						faith calculator 
### Miles Unterreiner 
For the devoutly religious, faith
is an unadulterated good. It
needs no explanation, no justi
fication, no quantification. For the
rest of us, however, the question re
mains: how should we measure,
evaluate and judge the nature of re
ligious belief?
A friend of mine once suggested
that the essential character of reli
gions can be located in their founda
tional texts that we can under
stand Christianity by reading the
Bible, Islam by interpreting the
Quran and Judaism by investigating
the Tanakh and Talmud. In my
friend's formulation, there is a tex
tual core at the center of each and
every faith that exists regardless of
the actions of that faith's adherents.
Thus a Christian who fails to help
his neighbor in times of need can be
said to be a poor Christian, or a
Hindu who eats beef a poor Hindu.
If only it were that simple. Cen
turies of post-Reformation experi
ence have taught the world that

texts can be twisted and moral man
dates made malleable. We know
that faith can be used to justify
peace as often as war, charity as
often as selfishness, inclusion as
often as intolerance.

Such it was that for every North
ern abolitionist preacher in 1860
there was a Southern counterpart
quoting Colossians 3:22: "Slaves,
obey your earthly masters in every
thing; and do it, not only when their
eye is on you and to win their favor,
but with sincerity of heart and rev
erence for the Lord." Thus for
every Mother Teresa there seems
to be a Jerry Falwell, for every
Eboo Patel an Osama bin Laden or
an Anwar al-Awlaki.

Christians struggling to find reli
gious grounding for their opinions
on welfare or the social safety net
might well be confused by the word
of God. For on the one hand we
hear, "He who does not work, nei
ther shall he eat" (2 Thessalonians
3:10), and on the other, "If a man
shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
he too will cry out and not be an
swered" (Proverbs 21:13).
And likewise a Muslim looking
for guidance in establishing rela
tionships with people of other
faiths might be confused by the ap
parent contradiction between Sura
9:5 ("Fight and slay the pagans
wherever ye find them") and Sura
5:32 ("Whoever kills an innocent, it
is as if he has killed all mankind; and
whoever saves a person, it is as if he
has saved all mankind").

So how are secular evaluators of
religion to respond to such an inter
pretive quandary, especially given
canonical texts that frequently
seem to offer contradictory an
swers to the same timeless ques
tions?

Matthew gives us one possible
answer in 7:16: "Ye shall know
them by their fruits. Do men gather
grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
This utilitarian test of the character
of religion works in re verse, extrap
olating the essential nature of a re-

ligion from the acts of its believers.
Thus purveyors of good works
(grapes and figs) show their reli
gion to be essentially good, while
doers of evil demonstrate their
faith to be essentially thorny and
thistly.
This also is a tempting route to
take. We could simply tally up the
charity dollars given and Good
Samaritans created, subtract the
number of suicide bombers and
bigots and divide by the number of
believers per religion to get some
sort of essential goodness quotient.
Religion, then, would simply be as
good or bad as its believers make it.
But this also is ultimately unsat
isfactory. It would be pleasant and
comforting to say that texts don't
matter, and that all religions have
equal potential for good or for evil,
shaped only by the actions of ratio
nal men and women seeking the
universal good. But as Douglas
Murray once put it in the course of
a debate on the nature of Islam,
that would be to foolishly "elevate
hope into truth." Simple utilitarian
calculations fail to take into account
the complex histories behind and
intricate differences between faiths

differences that human beings
who subscribe to those faiths cannot
entirely escape by doing whatever
they think is rationally right.
Unsurprisingly, I have no defini
tive answer. I don't know whether
religion is a net loss or a net gain for
secular society, nor am I sure if it is
possible to say that some religions
are "better" than others. In my next
column, however, I'll attempt to
elaborate on this one by outlining a
few brief thoughts on the intersec
tion between secular ethics and reli
gious thought and what each can
learn from the other.
