# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Sport, space and the nation 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Every four years, just as
America is at its most di
vided, we have a chance to
come together again through
sport. This election year, there is
more to divide us than usual.
Thankfully, there is more to unite
us as well.

I write primarily about poli
tics, and the more I read and
write, the more discouraged I
tend to become. Every day seems
much like the next: another Is
raeli-Palestinian peace plan fallen
through, another shooting at a
cinema or temple, another bomb
ing in Iraq, another squabble over
health care or tax returns or fried
chicken, another fight between
the 1 percent and the 99 percent

over, in Lasswell's famous defini
tion, who gets what, when and
how.

That's why I so treasure those
few truly politics-free moments
the moments when we are no
longer Republicans or Democ
rats, upper-crust or lower-class,
black or white or brown, but sim
ply Americans. Those moments
don't come often, and most of
them seem to come at the
Olympics.
It was impossible to feel cyni
cal about much of anything when
Gabby Douglas' smile lit up the
world after winning the all
around. The furor around Mitt
Romney's comments about
Britain's preparedness for the
Games disappeared from memo
ry when Britain's Mo Farah and
our very own Galen Rupp, train
ing partners in Oregon, embraced
after going 1-2 in the 10,000 meter
final two men of different
faiths, different ethnicities and
different countries, united
through shared, brutal effort in
the service of sport. Politics lay
forgotten as the entire country
watched Alex Morgan put a bril
liant finish past a horrified Cana
dian squad in the final minute of
extra time, snapping 122 minutes

of tension in one final moment of
glorious victory. To paraphrase
Barack Obama: At that moment
we were no longer divided into
red states and blue states, but
united as fifty red, white and blue
states.

When I'm watching NBC's
wonderfully nationalistic cover
age of the Games, swamped in pa
triotic slow-motion montages of
American athletes overcoming
tremendous adversity to run,
jump, swim and, in Ryan Lochte's
case, give disastrous interviews
for the stars and stripes, I forget
for a moment all the things that
need fixing about our country and
remember everything we've done
right.

And among those things is
continuing to support the Ameri
can space program, which recent
ly landed the cutting-edge Curios
ity rover on Mars after a ridicu
lously complex landing proce
dure involving parachutes, rock
ets and, in the final moments of
the so-called "seven minutes of
terror," delicate landing cables.

These are the moments that
make us remember why we live in
this country, the moments when
we can honestly and unflinchingly
celebrate collective national
achievements, the moments
where rancor and bitterness have
no place.
They are also the moments on
which it is most difficult to place a
price tag. Who knows what will
come of our distant exploration of
a mysterious planet, or which
child will be inspired to do great
things by watching Missy
Franklin or Michael Phelps?
Already, however, critics on
both sides of the partisan divide
have raised complaints that we
ought not to spend the time and
money to explore space when
there are pressing problems here
on Earth; that pure government
funded research without a direct
and immediate impact on human

welfare is inherently useless; that
Olympic athletes get too much at
tention, earn too much money
and divert our attention from
more important problems.
Those complaints constitute a
dangerous narrowing of our vi
sion and a frightening lowering of
our ambitions for humanity. Con
fining our discussions of the pub
lic welfare to narrow questions of
self-interest, division and distrib
ution robs the nation of its ability
to enjoy a good life that cannot be
captured by recourse to numbers,
facts and figures.
There is a time and place for
everything, and the problems of
our nation and the world cannot
be solved by feel-good heroics
alone. But as far as it is in our
power, we ought to continue to
support the projects, people and
ideas that transcend our small,
man-made boundaries and enrich
the sum of this human experience
we all share.
