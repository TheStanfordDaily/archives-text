## A 						NEW ERA Cardinal women's soccer undaunted by high expectations 
### DAVID ENG DAILY INTERN 
It was this time nearly a year ago.
A battle-tested Stanford women's
soccer team had set out to capture the
school's first national championship,
having faltered in the Final Four in each
of the past three seasons and in the title
match in each of the past two.
Redshirt junior Courtney Verloo re
members one of those lazy summer
days quite well.
A returning starter at central de
fense entering her junior year, Verloo
remembers feeling her left knee "blown
out" after a "weird plant" during an in
trasquad match last preseason. Having
sustained both a small meniscal tear
and a tibial plateau fracture in her left
knee injuries associated with ex
tended recovery time she watched
from the sideline for the entire 2011
season, supporting the teammates she
started 24 games with during her sopho
more year.

"It was different just having to sit
back and watch," Verloo said, referring
to Stanford's unprecedented domi
nance (25-0-1, 11-0 Pac-12) en route to
the program's first NCAA champi
onship. "But it was amazing to watch."
Now fully recovered, Verloo figures
to play a key role in her team's title de
fense. But she'll no longer be playing
defense like she did her sophomore sea
son. The Cardinal will need her to
score.
"I think it will be a fine transition,"
said the speedy Verloo, who played for
ward during her freshman year on the
Farm and for her entire high school and
youth careers. "I'm comfortable up
front, and I'm excited to play up there
again."

Verloo returns to a perennially po
tent Stanford attack recently ravaged
by the graduations of key players, in
cluding the loss of last season's top fe
male college soccer player in Teresa
Noyola, a midfielder who has led Stan

ford in assists in each of the past two
seasons.

"More of the younger players are
going to step it up this year," Verloo
said. "But we definitely still have a
great amount of talent."
Losing a Hermann Trophy winner to
graduation has become almost standard
for the Cardinal, which has lost one in
each of the past three seasons. While
the program maintained its dominance
after the graduations of Kelley O'Hara
in 2010 and Christen Press in 2011, re
covering from the most recent string of
graduations may be slightly more chal
lenging.
This season, not only will the team
be without Noyola; it must also contend
without four of its top six point scorers
from last season players who ac
counted for nearly 60 percent of the
Cardinal's goals. Furthermore, one of
Stanford's top two returning scorers,
sophomore forward Chioma Übogagu,
will miss as many as six preseason
matches while playing on the United
States under-20 national team in the
FIFA U-20 World Cup.
"We're going to really miss Chi just
because she adds so much to an attack,"
Verloo said. "But I think it will be good
for other players to get a chance to play
up there and hopefully make a big im
pact, so we can just have a more dynam
ic attack overall."

Despite the apparent exodus of an
attacking talent that outshot the oppo
sition by 142 shots on goal and scored
more than eight times as often as its op
ponents did in 2011, lOth-year head
coach Paul Ratcliffe remains excited by
the "extreme talent" of his team and its
chance to compete for a fourth consec
utive Pac-12 championship and second
consecutive national title.

"We control our own destiny," Rat
cliffe said. "We have to train hard and
improve with every training session and
find the right chemistry among the play-

ers and get a little bit of luck
down the line."

Übogagu, for one, has been
training for the entire offseason
saying she has "never had an
offseason training that hard or
that physical." She is poised to be
one of the primary weapons for
the Cardinal during conference
play after tallying 10 goals and 10
assists in 25 starts during her
freshman year.
"Just being with the Stanford
team ... everyone wants to get
better every day," she said. Übo
gagu hopes her offseason work
outs will only add to her greatest
strength as a scorer "attacking
afpeople."

With the return of Verloo and
the continued emergence of Übo
gagu, Stanford seems poised for
another deep run in the NCAA
tournament. UCLA and Oregon
State provide tough competition
in conference play, says Verloo.
Duke and Wake Forest are poised
to dethrone the Cardinal in the
national title hunt, says Übogagu.
But both women acknowledge
that any team could contend.

"We need to realize we're a
target. Never relax. Never get
complacent," Verloo said. "We
need to make sure we're always
preparing right and staying com
petitive every day."

Ratcliffe reiterated this senti
ment; he believes that repeating in
the "very challenging Pac-12 con
ference" will be difficult because

"there's more and more parity in
women's soccer." However, no
one can discount the Cardinal's
experience. The sophomores
have won a national champi
onship. The juniors have compet
ed in the title game for two con
secutive years, the seniors for
three. All the while, none of these
current players may have carried
the team for an entire season
not yet, at least.
"Having the experience helps
us; it doesn't hurt us," Verloo
said. "I think it will help having
the experience. Knowing what it's
like to win, everybody just wants
it more again."
Stanford returns eight starters
from last season: Übogagu, senior
forward Marjani Hing-Glover, ju
nior forward Sydney Payne, se
nior midfielder Mariah Nogueira,
senior defender Alina Garcia
mendez, senior defender Rachel
Quon, redshirt sophomore
Kendall Romine and junior goal
keeper Emily Oliver.
However, carving out an iden
tity distinct from the champi
onship teams of past years may be
the most daunting task that lies
ahead not simply for the indi
vidual players, but also for the
team.

"We're proud of what we ac
complished last year, but this is a
new team," Ratcliffe said. "This
team wants to prove they're the
best team out there. Last year,
they proved that they were the
best team in the history of Stan
ford women's soccer, and this
team wants to prove the same."
