## A NEW ERA Cardinal women's soccer undaunted by high expectations
### DAVID ENG DAILY INTERN 
It was this time nearly a year ago.
A battle-tested Stanford women's
soccer team had set out to capture the
school's first national championship,
having faltered in the Final Four in each
of the past three seasons and in the title
match in each of the past two.
Redshirt junior Courtney Verloo re
members one of those lazy summer
days quite well.
A returning starter at central de
fense entering her junior year, Verloo
remembers feeling her left knee "blown
out" after a "weird plant" during an in
trasquad match last preseason. Having
sustained both a small meniscal tear
and a tibial plateau fracture in her left
knee injuries associated with ex
tended recovery time she watched
from the sideline for the entire 2011
season, supporting the teammates she
started 24 games with during her sopho
more year.

"It was different just having to sit
back and watch," Verloo said, referring
to Stanford's unprecedented domi
nance (25-0-1, 11-0 Pac-12) en route to
the program's first NCAA champi
onship. "But it was amazing to watch."
Now fully recovered, Verloo figures
to play a key role in her team's title de
fense. But she'll no longer be playing
defense like she did her sophomore sea
son. The Cardinal will need her to
score.
"I think it will be a fine transition,"
said the speedy Verloo, who played for
ward during her freshman year on the
Farm and for her entire high school and
youth careers. "I'm comfortable up
front, and I'm excited to play up there
again."

Verloo returns to a perennially po
tent Stanford attack recently ravaged
by the graduations of key players, in
cluding the loss of last season's top fe
male college soccer player in Teresa
Noyola, a midfielder who has led Stan

ford in assists in each of the past two
seasons.

"More of the younger players are
going to step it up this year," Verloo
said. "But we definitely still have a
great amount of talent."
Losing a Hermann Trophy winner to
graduation has become almost standard
for the Cardinal, which has lost one in
each of the past three seasons. While
the program maintained its dominance
after the graduations of Kelley O'Hara
in 2010 and Christen Press in 2011, re
covering from the most recent string of
graduations may be slightly more chal
lenging.
This season, not only will the team
be without Noyola; it must also contend
without four of its top six point scorers
from last season players who ac
counted for nearly 60 percent of the
Cardinal's goals. Furthermore, one of
Stanford's top two returning scorers,
sophomore forward Chioma Ãœbogagu,
will miss as many as six preseason
matches while playing on the United
States under-20 national team in the
FIFA U-20 World Cup.
"We're going to really miss Chi just
because she adds so much to an attack,"
Verloo said. "But I think it will be good
for other players to get a chance to play
up there and hopefully make a big im
pact, so we can just have a more dynam
ic attack overall."

Despite the apparent exodus of an
attacking talent that outshot the oppo
sition by 142 shots on goal and scored
more than eight times as often as its op
ponents did in 2011, lOth-year head
coach Paul Ratcliffe remains excited by
the "extreme talent" of his team and its
chance to compete for a fourth consec
utive Pac-12 championship and second
consecutive national title.

"We control our own destiny," Rat
cliffe said. "We have to train hard and
improve with every training session and
find the right chemistry among the play-

Redshirt junior Courtney Verloo looks to become a major contributor in the Cardinal offensive
attack after being sidelined by injuries for the entire 2011 national title season.
