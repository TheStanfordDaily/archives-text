# Koroleva '12 makes big waves in her Olympic debut
## 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER 
It is mid-afternoon at the London Aquatics
Centre, and the focus has shifted on Day 11
of the Olympics from speed to artistic swim
ming.

Twelve pairs of swimmers competing for their
respective countries will now combine elements
of ballet, gymnastics and aquatics in three-minute
routines in which duos in perfect unison perform
carefully choreographed swims. It is as though the
gymnastics floor exercise has been moved into the
water, as an international panel of judges scores
the artistic and technical merit of the swimming
pairs.

Team USA came close to not even sending a
team to compete in this event, but a Stanford stu
dent, Mariya Koroleva 'l2, has made the sacrifices
to train eight to 10 hours a day and has qualified to
compete in this event. Koroleva and Mary Kill
man will be the only synchronized swimming ath
letes the United States is sending to the 2012
Olympics. Although she has only been paired
with Killman for less than a year, Koroleva's duet
has surpassed expectations and made the cut in
the preliminaries. As I watch them in the surreal
atmosphere of the Aquatics Centre, they now

compete in the finals for the gold medal.
As Koroleva and Killman prance out to the
platform to begin their routine, polite applause
greets them. There is a small contingent of flag
waving Americans in the audience and even some
diehard Stanford students and alumni proudly
displaying their cardinal and white along with
their red, white and blue. Yet, for the most part,
this international audience is comprised of fans
rooting for the heavily favored Russian, Chinese
and Spanish duos. The cheers are also loud for the
hometown British team, which is, of course, the
crowd favorite. Unlike the American pair, the
other duos have been swimming together for
years.

It is humid and warm in the Aquatics Centre
an atmosphere clearly designed for swimmers
rather than spectators. The synchronized swim
mers compete in the same venue that Michael
Phelps and Ryan Lochte raced in.
Resplendent in their zebra-motif outfits, Ko
roleva and Killman gracefully dive into the water
to the strains of "The Bugler's Dream" the
now-familiar Olympic theme song. They will not
be able to breathe for two out of the three minutes

they will perform, and their feet must never touch
the bottom of the pool.

The enthusiasm of the American swimmers is
palpable as Koroleva and Killman effortlessly
perform a stunning combination of lifts, verticals,
dolphin arches and knight variants. It is like water
based gymnastics or aquatic ballet. These are not
stressed-out swimmers, not the diva athletes
whose histrionics have made other Olympic
events border on melodrama. Rather, they are
students having enormous fun and showing it.
The largely non-American audience senses the
swimmers' j oie de vivre and high energy levels and
gets behind the Americans.
The spirit of Stanford has momentarily taken
over the Aquatics Centre. The only thing missing
is the Band.

Now the eclectic musical score changes from
John Philip Sousa to Beethoven's Ninth Sympho
ny, and the American pair shows that they can
swim as well as the best Olympians in this arena.
When they gracefully form the pattern of a flower
and mimic the opening and closing of its petals
several times, the multinational audi
ence cheers.
Everything in synchronized
swimming is artistic, down to the exit
from the pool after the conclusion of
the performance. As Koroleva and
Killman make their synchronized
exit, the audience gives them a well
earned sustained ovation.
Koroleva and her duet partner
score a combined total of 176.670
points, earningB7.77ofor the free rou
tine and 87.800 for the technical. For
the moment, this puts them in second
place overall. Although the Russian,
Spanish and Chinese teams will sur
pass them and earn the gold, silver
and bronze medals, respectively, the
Americans have clearly won the gold
medal for enthusiasm and energy.
The pool rippled with hundreds of
concentric circular waves, a sight of
beauty that cannot be seen and appre
ciated from a television camera.

If Koroleva and Killman can per
form this brilliantly after so little time
together as a pair, it augurs well for
the United States and Stanford's
Olympic prospects once they have
the benefit of more extensive train
ing together. With Koroleva and
Killman performing, America's syn
chronized swimming prospects are
bright.

The brilliant artistry of Maty Ann
Toman-Miller's writing perfor
mance suggests she would do a bet
ter job than a host of Olympic
broadcasters. Nominate her for Rio
2016 at tomanmil@stanford.edu.

It is mid-afternoon at the London Aquatics
Centre, and the focus has shifted on Day 11
of the Olympics from speed to artistic swim
ming.

Twelve pairs of swimmers competing for their
respective countries will now combine elements
of ballet, gymnastics and aquatics in three-minute
routines in which duos in perfect unison perform
carefully choreographed swims. It is as though the
gymnastics floor exercise has been moved into the
water, as an international panel of judges scores
the artistic and technical merit of the swimming
pairs.

Team USA came close to not even sending a
team to compete in this event, but a Stanford stu
dent, Mariya Koroleva 'l2, has made the sacrifices
to train eight to 10 hours a day and has qualified to
compete in this event. Koroleva and Mary Kill
man will be the only synchronized swimming ath
letes the United States is sending to the 2012
Olympics. Although she has only been paired
with Killman for less than a year, Koroleva's duet
has surpassed expectations and made the cut in
the preliminaries. As I watch them in the surreal
atmosphere of the Aquatics Centre, they now

compete in the finals for the gold medal.
As Koroleva and Killman prance out to the
platform to begin their routine, polite applause
greets them. There is a small contingent of flag
waving Americans in the audience and even some
diehard Stanford students and alumni proudly
displaying their cardinal and white along with
their red, white and blue. Yet, for the most part,
this international audience is comprised of fans
rooting for the heavily favored Russian, Chinese
and Spanish duos. The cheers are also loud for the
hometown British team, which is, of course, the
crowd favorite. Unlike the American pair, the
other duos have been swimming together for
years.

It is humid and warm in the Aquatics Centre
an atmosphere clearly designed for swimmers
rather than spectators. The synchronized swim
mers compete in the same venue that Michael
Phelps and Ryan Lochte raced in.
Resplendent in their zebra-motif outfits, Ko
roleva and Killman gracefully dive into the water
to the strains of "The Bugler's Dream" the
now-familiar Olympic theme song. They will not
be able to breathe for two out of the three minutes

they will perform, and their feet must never touch
the bottom of the pool.

The enthusiasm of the American swimmers is
palpable as Koroleva and Killman effortlessly
perform a stunning combination of lifts, verticals,
dolphin arches and knight variants. It is like water
based gymnastics or aquatic ballet. These are not
stressed-out swimmers, not the diva athletes
whose histrionics have made other Olympic
events border on melodrama. Rather, they are
students having enormous fun and showing it.
The largely non-American audience senses the
swimmers' j oie de vivre and high energy levels and
gets behind the Americans.
The spirit of Stanford has momentarily taken
over the Aquatics Centre. The only thing missing
is the Band.

Now the eclectic musical score changes from
John Philip Sousa to Beethoven's Ninth Sympho
ny, and the American pair shows that they can
swim as well as the best Olympians in this arena.
When they gracefully form the pattern of a flower
and mimic the opening and closing of its petals
several times, the multinational audi
ence cheers.
Everything in synchronized
swimming is artistic, down to the exit
from the pool after the conclusion of
the performance. As Koroleva and
Killman make their synchronized
exit, the audience gives them a well
earned sustained ovation.
Koroleva and her duet partner
score a combined total of 176.670
points, earningB7.77ofor the free rou
tine and 87.800 for the technical. For
the moment, this puts them in second
place overall. Although the Russian,
Spanish and Chinese teams will sur
pass them and earn the gold, silver
and bronze medals, respectively, the
Americans have clearly won the gold
medal for enthusiasm and energy.
The pool rippled with hundreds of
concentric circular waves, a sight of
beauty that cannot be seen and appre
ciated from a television camera.

If Koroleva and Killman can per
form this brilliantly after so little time
together as a pair, it augurs well for
the United States and Stanford's
Olympic prospects once they have
the benefit of more extensive train
ing together. With Koroleva and
Killman performing, America's syn
chronized swimming prospects are
bright.
