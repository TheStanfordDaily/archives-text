# RUSH D ENOUGH
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Say what you want about
special teams, but Stan
ford's pass defense cost it
the Fiesta Bowl.

On that fateful night in January,
the Cardinal executed its game
plan to perfection in the three
other phases of the game: it rushed
for 243 yards and three touch
downs, allowed practically nothing
from Oklahoma State on the
ground and benefited from a 27-
for-31, 347-yard effort from An
drew Luck in his final collegiate
game. But with Cowboys quarter
back Brandon Weeden throwing
for 399 yards of his own, Stanford
couldn't close things out the way it
would have wanted to, and Okla
homa State came out on top in
overtime.

So as the Cardinal opened its
fall training camp Sunday without
the three graduated members of its
2011 starting secondary, it makes
sense that pass defense would be
the squad's greatest concern after
the quarterback position. Defense
wins championships, of course.
But as it turns out, to succeed in
the best passing conference in the
nation, the strength a Pac-12 de
fense needs the least is ... an air
tight secondary.
This conclusion, counterintu
itive as it may seem, is made readi
ly apparent by studying the correla
tion between the defensive stats of
each Pac-12 team and how many
games the individual teams won for
a single season. For the non-stats
majors in the crowd, correlation
(with a magnitude ranging from
zero to one) is a simple measure of
the interrelatedness of two vari
ables. A perfect correlation of one
indicates that, when these data
points are plotted, they form a per
fectly straight line; a correlation
close to zero means that the data
points are spread randomly. For
example, you would expect a pret
ty high correlation between a
team's wins and the number of
points it scores, but a much lower
correlation between its wins and,
say, the number of fair catches it
