# RUSH D ENOUGH
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Say what you want about
special teams, but Stan
ford's pass defense cost it
the Fiesta Bowl.

On that fateful night in January,
the Cardinal executed its game
plan to perfection in the three
other phases of the game: it rushed
for 243 yards and three touch
downs, allowed practically nothing
from Oklahoma State on the
ground and benefited from a 27-
for-31, 347-yard effort from An
drew Luck in his final collegiate
game. But with Cowboys quarter
back Brandon Weeden throwing
for 399 yards of his own, Stanford
couldn't close things out the way it
would have wanted to, and Okla
homa State came out on top in
overtime.

So as the Cardinal opened its
fall training camp Sunday without
the three graduated members of its
2011 starting secondary, it makes
sense that pass defense would be
the squad's greatest concern after
the quarterback position. Defense
wins championships, of course.
But as it turns out, to succeed in
the best passing conference in the
nation, the strength a Pac-12 de
fense needs the least is ... an air
tight secondary.
This conclusion, counterintu
itive as it may seem, is made readi
ly apparent by studying the correla
tion between the defensive stats of
each Pac-12 team and how many
games the individual teams won for
a single season. For the non-stats
majors in the crowd, correlation
(with a magnitude ranging from
zero to one) is a simple measure of
the interrelatedness of two vari
ables. A perfect correlation of one
indicates that, when these data
points are plotted, they form a per
fectly straight line; a correlation
close to zero means that the data
points are spread randomly. For
example, you would expect a pret
ty high correlation between a
team's wins and the number of
points it scores, but a much lower
correlation between its wins and,
say, the number of fair catches it
records.
Since allowing fewer passing or
rushing yards is a good thing, the
correlation between either of these
stats and wins is expected to be neg
ative, but keep in mind that it's the
magnitude that counts here. A
comparison of these correlations is
a strong indicator of which is more
"important" to a team's success
essentially, whether a solid sec
ondary should be valued over a for
midable front seven or vice versa.
Take 2011. Believe it or not, in a
season full of pass-happy offenses
led by top-rate quarterbacks An
drew Luck, Matt Barkley, Nick
Foles, Brock Osweiler and Keith
Price, to name a few there was
only a correlation of -0.07 between
the number of passing yards allowed
per game by Pac-12 teams and how
many wins they recorded. This fig
ure emerges from the fact that none
of the conference's 10-win teams
had a top-five secondary (in terms of
yards allowed through the air), and
the best pass-stopper in the Pac-12,
Cal, finished a mediocre 7-6.
The number of yards allowed
per game on the ground, on the
other hand, was a much more accu
rate predictor of how many victo

ries a team recorded, as demon
strated by the -0.80 correlation be
tween wins and rushing defense in
2011. Twelve-win Oregon, 11-win
Stanford and 10-win USC finished
5-1-2 in this regard, and no bowl-el
igible team in the top five in rush
ing yards allowed failed to qualify
for the postseason last year.
The 2011 season was no fluke,
either. In each of the past five sea
sons, the correlation between rush
defense and wins has been stronger
than that between pass defense
and wins; since 2007, when the two
measures were nearly the same,
the rush defense mark has never
risen above -0.69 and the pass de
fense mark has never slipped
below -0.29. (Remember, larger
negatives indicate a stronger rela
tion in this case.) The same general
trend repeats itself in terms of just
Pac-12 records.
Over that same five-year span,
top-three finishers in the Pac-12
average the third-best rush defense
in the conference but just the fifth
best pass defense. On the national
scale, just one 10-win squad (Ari
zona in 2007) also finished in the
top 10 in Division I for passing
yards allowed, but Oregon has
reached double-digit wins and
boasted a top-10 rush defense for
each of the last four years.
There's an argument to be
made that, when comparing front
sevens with secondaries, yards al

lowed are not the only (or even the
best) stat to use. A sack or inter
ception can turn the tide of a close
game, and bend-but-don't-break
schemes aren't afraid to give up a
few yards on shorter passes as
suming the timely stop comes.
There's some data to support
this assertion: the conference
champion has recorded the most
sacks in the league three of the last
five seasons, and in 2010 the Pac
e's three top finishers Oregon,
Stanford and USC recorded the
first-, second- and third-most picks,
in that order.

But not all big plays are made
equal, and again, the front seven
reigns supreme. There has been a
decent correlation between sacks
and wins over the past four years,
as this measure has always fallen
between 0.51 and 0.72 since 2008.
But when it comes to interceptions,
things are much less predictable. A
0.71 correlation between picks and
wins in 2008 gave way to a mark of
essentially zero in 2009, yet in 2010
the correlation was stronger than
ever at 0.82. And in 2011, when sec
ond-place Stanford had the fewest
interceptions (seven) in the Pac-12,
the correlation had plummeted
back to 0.19.

The moral of the story is that if
you're looking for a playmaker in
the Pac-12, a strong pass rusher is a
much more reliable bet to im
prove your team's fortunes than
an electrifying cover guy.
This season you can expect the
Cardinal to finish in the top three
in the conference in both rushing
yards allowed and sacks, and the
six Pac-12 teams that have done
that in the last five years have av
eraged 9.67 wins. So while the rest
of the world worries about how
the Cardinal's young but talented
defensive backs Wayne Lyons,
Terrence Brown, Barry Brown
ing, Devon Carrington, Ed
Reynolds and others will define
their roles ins a secondary that had
its fair share of struggles last sea
son, I'm just going to sit back and
relax while Shayne Skov, Chase
Thomas and the rest of Stanford's
dominant front seven do their
work.

Don't forget, I have math on my
side.
