# PISTORIUS PUSHING THE LIMITS

### Tom Taylor 
Congratulations Ameri
ca. You've done your
very best to steal Lon
don's thunder of host
ing the 2012 Olympic
Games by landing yet another rover
on the surface of Mars. It is all very
impressive, I'll admit that, though I
wonder if you couldn't have waited
just a couple of weeks and let us
Brits have our time in the limelight.
My friends in the States, a mix
ture of engineers and Americans, all
seem very excited and inspired right
now, if their Facebook statuses are
anything to go by. Though the pic
tures posted are mostly grainy
black-and-white images, I have to
admit that what NASA just

human feat.
I should be transfixed by it too

coming an astronaut but my own
attention right now is firmly on the
Olympics. Aside from a few articles
on that extraterrestrial achieve

GB is having as I write this it lies
third in the medals table behind two
sports superpowers, the U.S. and
China.

And don't be put off by the
shameless commercialization of the
competition and the arrogant, over
the-top posturing of athletes such as
the men's 100-meter finalists on the
track last Sunday. There are those
unfortunate sides of the Games, yes,
but there is still a lot that is more in
keeping with the real, original spirit
of the Olympics. Take, for example,
South African sprinter Oscar Pisto
rius, also known as the "Blade Run
ner."

A double below-knee amputee,
Pistorius is a four-time gold-medal
winner at the Paralympics, using
