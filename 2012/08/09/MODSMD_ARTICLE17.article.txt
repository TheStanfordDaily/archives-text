# PISTORIUS PUSHING THE LIMITS

### Tom Taylor 
Congratulations Ameri
ca. You've done your
very best to steal Lon
don's thunder of host
ing the 2012 Olympic
Games by landing yet another rover
on the surface of Mars. It is all very
impressive, I'll admit that, though I
wonder if you couldn't have waited
just a couple of weeks and let us
Brits have our time in the limelight.
My friends in the States, a mix
ture of engineers and Americans, all
seem very excited and inspired right
now, if their Facebook statuses are
anything to go by. Though the pic
tures posted are mostly grainy
black-and-white images, I have to
admit that what NASA just
achieved is a pretty impressive
human feat.
I should be transfixed by it too
I did, after all, once dream of be
coming an astronaut but my own
attention right now is firmly on the
Olympics. Aside from a few articles
on that extraterrestrial achieve
ment, British media is concentrat
ing on the festival of sport in our na
tion's capital. And it should be, con
sidering the great success that Team
GB is having as I write this it lies
third in the medals table behind two
sports superpowers, the U.S. and
China.

And don't be put off by the
shameless commercialization of the
competition and the arrogant, over
the-top posturing of athletes such as
the men's 100-meter finalists on the
track last Sunday. There are those
unfortunate sides of the Games, yes,
but there is still a lot that is more in
keeping with the real, original spirit
of the Olympics. Take, for example,
South African sprinter Oscar Pisto
rius, also known as the "Blade Run
ner."

A double below-knee amputee,
Pistorius is a four-time gold-medal
winner at the Paralympics, using
flexible carbon fiber blade prosthet
ics to allow him to run relatively nor
mally. After being banned in 2007,
he was eventually given permission
to race in International Association
of Athletics Federations (lAAF)
competitions against able-bodied
athletes in May 2008, and he quali
fied for this summer's Games last
year.

Some are vehemently opposed
to Pistorius' participation, arguing
as the lAAF did in 2007 that his ar
tificial lower legs give him a signifi
cant advantage over other runners,
and that allowing him to compete
sets a dangerous precedent for al
lowing future athletes to use similar
equipment to gain an edge over oth
ers.

They are wrong, of course. We
already live in a world in which top
athletes employ science and tech
nology to get them over the finish
line first, from detailed analysis of
biomechanics that change a run
ner's gait to ultra-low-weight bicy
cles to high-tech clothing fabrics to
cutting-edge running shoes to drugs
yes, drugs.
As every athlete at the Olympic
Games leaves the field of play, they
are faced with giving urine samples
so that any use of illegal medication
can be identified. But there is also a
huge range of legal drugs; athletes
don't just eat salads and drink
water. Vitamins supplement their
diets, isotonic drinks improve per
formance and anti-inflammatory
painkillers speed recovery from in
jury. That we can investigate and
regulate these medications
hopefully catching the vast majority
of cheats implies that we should
surely be able to do the same with
Pistorius' blades.

The idea that he gains a serious
advantage or that others may follow
his lead seems crazy. In case you
haven't been paying attention, re
gardless of the technology he is
using, Pistorius is a double am
putee. Life has surely not been easy,
and neither has his training or com
petition. No one would ever want to
replace his or her lower limbs with
carbon-fiber blades just to win an
athletic competition; no one would
risk major surgery on a perfectly
healthy body just for that. But ath
letes who have had parts of them
selves replaced in surgery, such as
ACL replacements, are allowed to

compete, so why not Pistorius?
The biggest justification for al
lowing Pistorius to compete,
though, is what his inclusion means.
Simply put, he has an inspiring
story, a tale of someone who simply
refused to give up in the face of seri
ous disability. It may not have quite
the interplanetary reach of NASA's
latest mission, but it too is a perfect
example of what can be achieved
with hard work and technology.
You might argue about whether or
not he gains an advantage from his
prosthetic limbs, but you cannot
argue about whether or not he em
bodies the Olympic Games.
In the end, while Pistorius made
it into the semifinals of the 400 me
ters, he went no further than that in
the competition. But the most
telling moment came just after that
race was run. The winner, reigning
world champion Kirani James of
Grenada, immediately went to
swap race numbers with Pistorius,
and the whole field embraced the
double-amputee. It was clear that
this South African sprinter inspired
not only the viewing public, but also
his athletic peers.

Tom Taylor burst into tears of joy
when Great Britain's Jessica Ennis
won gold in the heptathlon. Ask
him how long it took to stop crying
at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
