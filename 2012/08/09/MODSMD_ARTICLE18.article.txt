## MUSIC LOLLAPALOOZA The 						Bay Area meets Chi-town in three-day music festival 
### – isaac HALYARD contact isaac: ihalyard@stanford. edu 
The Bay is replaced by Lake
Michigan, and the fog
trapped in the foothills gives
way to oven-like humidity. Deep
dish becomes the only pizza crust,
while Derrick Rose jerseys of every
color replace Giants caps. E-40's
"Function" is a mere afterthought
to any tune by hometown favorite
Kanye West. This is no "Yay Area."
This is Chicago. And on Aug. 3-5,
the city played host to one of the
nation's largest music festivals:
Lollapalooza.
Founded in 1991 by Jane's
Addiction front man Perry Farrell,
Lollapalooza has morphed quite a
bit in its 21 years. After a handful

of hiatuses following its beginnings
as a traveling festival, Lollapalooza
has recurred annually in Grant
Park since 2005. The acts have
grown with the crowds, morphing
Lollapalooza into an annual pil
grimage for thousands of fans who
have fallen in love with the event.
For Stanford students, however,
making the lengthy trip to Lolla
can prove to be rather difficult. To
offer some insight into the festival,
Intermission made the journey to
Chicago to see what Lolla's all
about.
Evanston
Like many Stanford Lolla-

goers, Intermission's adventure
began each morning north of
downtown Chicago in Evanston, a
neighborhood simultaneously part
of the 'burbs and the city. Evanston
is the home of Northwestern
University, a Midwestern academic
powerhouse where a Stanford stu
dent is likely to have one or two
friends willing to let him crash on a
futon for the weekend.
When students wake on the
hot Friday morning (or, more like
ly, early afternoon), they slowly
make the journey downtown.
Trains are packed with countless
neon tank tops, Camelßaks and
high-waisted jean shorts. All the
commotion, combined with the
growing frequency of late-morning
handle pulls scattered about the
train, immediately triggers memo
ries of early-morning insanity on
the Bay to Breakers Caltrain.
When the train arrives, hordes
of festivalgoers take to the streets
of Chicago, charging toward Grant
Park. Thousands of people fill the
sidewalks, funneling toward the
famous Michigan Avenue, the
heart of shopping in Chicago.
Century-old buildings deemed
worthy of Christopher Nolan's
Gotham cast massive shadows on
the crowds below.
Heading south on Michigan,
skyscrapers eventually reveal the
green, tree-scattered expanse of

Grant Park, cuddled up next to
Lake Michigan. The fans have
amassed at the park, and late
Friday morning the gates open.
For the next 60 hours, Grant
Park will play host to 270,000 peo
ple and 150 musical acts perform
ing on eight separate stages. In

2011, Lollapalooza reportedly
injected $lOO million into the
Chicago economy, a number likely
matched this year, given the record
attendance.

Friday
Fridays lineup started the
weekend off with a bang. Daytime
performances included Passion Pit,
The Shins, Dev and MB3. One of
the most impressive lineups of the
day could be felt emanating from
Perry's Stage, tucked in the corner
of Grant. Named after Lolla's
founder, Perry's Stage has played
host to some of the most exhilarat
ing electronic, house and dubstep
music the world has to offer. Once
a covered venue, the tent was
popped off this year to allow for
greater attendance. On Friday,
Perry's featured The White Panda,
Zedd, Porter Robinson and Nero,
who blasted bass loud enough to be
heard stages away. To finish the
day off, Bassnectar headlined at
Perry's on Friday night, attracting a
crowd more than prepared to rage
to dubstep.
Outside of the moshing frivo
lity of Perry's were some equally
phenomenal headliners. Wale
rapped on the Play Station Stage,
while The Black Keys and Black
Sabbath exhibited Lolla's rock ori
gins. All headliners, however, were
cut at 10 p.m. due to city noise
ordinances. Although a sore point
for many fans, the early end time

allowed for festivalgoers to experi
ence aspects of Lolla that make it
unique to other festivals: it's in the
city. Fans flocked to bars, hotels,
deep-dish pizzerias or one of the
more than 35 official after-shows to
cap off a wonderful day with some
downtown Chicago nightlife.
Saturday
With a somewhat groggy start
from the day before, Lolla-goers
got after it again on Saturday— for
a while, at least. In the late after
noon, the event organizers chose to
evacuate the park due to severe
weather warnings. Soon after the
evacuation, a powerful thunder
storm rolled through, pummeling
the park with rain, hail and wind.
However, as the storm gave way,
the festival reopened to spectacu
larly muddy shows by Calvin
Harris, Bloc Party, The Weeknd
and Franz Ferdinand, among many
others.
As the sun set, fans made the
tough decision of which headliner
to see. However, it was impossible
to make a wrong choice. Frank
Ocean's smooth R&B melted
hearts, Avicii melted faces and
Santigold eliminated all worries. All
the while, The Red Hot Chili
Peppers played a phenomenal show

to thousands of forever-loyal fans.
Sunday
On Sunday, people in Lolla
wristbands filled coffee shops and
diners to order breakfast at 1 p.m.
It was Lolla Sunday, and it was
time to rally. On the festival's final
day, committed fans flocked to J.
Cole, Sigur Ros, Toro Y Moi,
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Miike
Snow and At the Drive-in.
Although Zed's Dead kept the liter
al pulse of Lolla at Perry's, Florence
+ the Machine may have captured
the soul of the festival. Retro
Hollywood movie-set spotlights
glowed at the crowd, and simple
silver fans blew Florence's flowing
red gown, transforming Florence +
the Machine's stunning voice and
beautiful instrumentation into a
spectacle to behold.
As dusk gave way to night,
Justice took over Florence's stage,
while Jack White played at the
other end of the park. Kaskade
brought a powerful set to cap off
an electrifying weekend at Perry's.
Comedian-turned-rapper (or vice
versa) Childish Gambino lyricized
his way through an incredible set
while his fans rapped right along
with him.

At the crux of shipping lanes
and interstates in the heartland of
the nation, Chicago is a literal
crossroads. In a spectacular,
exhausting three days of musical
mayhem, Lollapalooza and its over
270,000 attendees further amplified
this definition. Friends from the
Farm had midsummer reunions,
while friends from high school met
each other's new college compan
ions. For three days, the third

largest city in America was trans
formed into a venue to enjoy
music, weather, food, fun and
company. It may not be the Bay
Area or Indio (the home of
Coachella), but with Lollapalooza,
Chicago shows it has something
truly special to offer.
