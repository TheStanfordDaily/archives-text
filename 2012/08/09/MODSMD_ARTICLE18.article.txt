## MUSIC LOLLAPALOOZA The Bay Area meets Chi-town in three-day music festival

The Bay is replaced by Lake
Michigan, and the fog
trapped in the foothills gives
way to oven-like humidity. Deep
dish becomes the only pizza crust,
while Derrick Rose jerseys of every
color replace Giants caps. E-40's
"Function" is a mere afterthought
to any tune by hometown favorite
Kanye West. This is no "Yay Area."
This is Chicago. And on Aug. 3-5,
the city played host to one of the
nation's largest music festivals:
Lollapalooza.
Founded in 1991 by Jane's
Addiction front man Perry Farrell,
Lollapalooza has morphed quite a
bit in its 21 years. After a handful

of hiatuses following its beginnings
as a traveling festival, Lollapalooza
has recurred annually in Grant
Park since 2005. The acts have
grown with the crowds, morphing
Lollapalooza into an annual pil
grimage for thousands of fans who
have fallen in love with the event.
For Stanford students, however,
making the lengthy trip to Lolla
can prove to be rather difficult. To
offer some insight into the festival,
Intermission made the journey to
Chicago to see what Lolla's all
about.
Evanston
Like many Stanford Lolla-

goers, Intermission's adventure
began each morning north of
downtown Chicago in Evanston, a
neighborhood simultaneously part
of the 'burbs and the city. Evanston
is the home of Northwestern
University, a Midwestern academic
powerhouse where a Stanford stu
dent is likely to have one or two
friends willing to let him crash on a
futon for the weekend.
When students wake on the
hot Friday morning (or, more like
ly, early afternoon), they slowly
make the journey downtown.
Trains are packed with countless
neon tank tops, Camelßaks and
high-waisted jean shorts. All the
commotion, combined with the
growing frequency of late-morning
handle pulls scattered about the
train, immediately triggers memo
ries of early-morning insanity on
the Bay to Breakers Caltrain.
When the train arrives, hordes
of festivalgoers take to the streets
of Chicago, charging toward Grant
Park. Thousands of people fill the
sidewalks, funneling toward the
famous Michigan Avenue, the
heart of shopping in Chicago.
Century-old buildings deemed
worthy of Christopher Nolan's
Gotham cast massive shadows on
the crowds below.
Heading south on Michigan,
skyscrapers eventually reveal the
green, tree-scattered expanse of

Grant Park, cuddled up next to
Lake Michigan. The fans have
amassed at the park, and late
Friday morning the gates open.
For the next 60 hours, Grant
Park will play host to 270,000 peo
ple and 150 musical acts perform
ing on eight separate stages. In

2011, Lollapalooza reportedly
injected $lOO million into the
Chicago economy, a number likely
matched this year, given the record
attendance.
