## PERSPECTIVES ON BRAND LOYALTY How to wrap your head around political statements SASH ANGELES 
### â€“ sasha ARIJANTO contact sasha: sasha.arijanto@stanford. edu 
The world of progressive, meat-eat
ing Southerners was rocked weeks
ago when our beloved anointed,
even Chick-fil-A announced its horribly
backwards stance on gay marriage (it's
against it). Not only is this a blow because
of the general anti-free-love vibes which
are just harshing my mellow, but also
because I love Chick-fil-A. I mean, I want
to boycott the restaurant, but it's just so
good. (But is it too good?) This is no new
conundrum; people have been conflicted
with whether to buy or boycott since the
less-than-glamorous Boston Tea Party
though we'd like to believe that that self
inflicted embargo was because of the sub
jugation of India and not high tea prices.
(Get it, high tea?)
So how do we anguished aesthetes
grapple with such a seemingly inextricable
net of political incorrectness, desire, brand
image, taste and pressure from our social
networks? Well, friends, free yourself of this
inner turmoil with some tips on how to
deal when your favorite brands forget social
corporate responsibility, back the wrong
political party or just plain screw up.
Put it out of your mind
The most basic and probably most used
tactic of the woeful consumer: ignorance. It's
not for real! These peeps just feign it, don't
talk about it and politely dismiss it like a
mother looking past her eldest son's growing
cocaine addiction. Confronting the fact that
Louis Vuitton doesn't actually make its bags
by hand, that they're in fact made mostly by
machine, makes that label markup hit hard
er. This one's easier when the corporate
crime is more chill (like being unfairly

priced) and harder when it's something evil

(like ignoring sexual assault).
Rationalize
Like a next step in the Twelve, this one
allows you to still indulge in the forbidden
fruit of a fallen company, but with the men
tal backing of some justified rationale. You
might cringe, for example, to learn that
Target gave money to support a candidate
against gay marriage but hey, they proba
bly supported him for other reasons, too,
right? One issue can't be the only thing. And
boycotting only hurts those nice ladies at the
register with long nails and two mortgages.
They need me to buy fairly priced generic
brand over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. I
ha ve friends who have worked there.

Conscientious objector
This one is a deep rationalization. A
conscientious objector does not abstain but
instead partakes in the fun, and copes by
projecting some morally correct scheme
onto the consumption. I will not deny
myself (entirely) the tender-fried-goodness
of Chick-fil-A upon my nearing pilgrimage
back to the South, not because I support not
supporting the union of gay people I do
support their union but because I will
create change from withinl I will fill out
cards, send emails, comment on FB statuses.
And it's not for naught.
Think about it. If there were no consci
entious objectors, the world would be totally

bereft of sweet uniformed-kisses photos and
the tales of gay Marine fathers that both
break the mold and inspire. That's not only
a shame; it's a disservice (no pun intended).
If all those strong gay LGBT men and
women just said "up yours" to the Army,
the Boy Scouts, the football teams and all the
other downers out there and packed it up
for theater camp, we'd have no change at all.
And that's worse than slow, painful, no
chicken change.
Find a similar substitute
Naaahh.
Rally behind the ones that are great
It's a struggle that every well-meaning
hypocrite faces: I hate when companies use
their corporate power to support
political/social agendas I don't like, but I am
all for it when it's a good one. So total bum
mer about Wal-Mart, Chick-fil-A and Boy
Scouts of America, but on the flip side, think
about how great Apple, Google and Microsoft
which all support equal rights are every
time you make a call or listen to iTunes. Heck,
just watch Ellen and feel good about it!
Boycott them completely
For only the most hardcore of princi
pled people, the boycott is an option,
though often ineffective and saddening.
Sometimes you've got to do it; sometimes it
makes no difference like my refusal to
listen to any Chris Brown song, even
though my literally quiet defiance of a frat
house iPod will affect no one. Sometimes
it's an excuse to not like something you
already think is gross but for other, less
social reasons. This photo was enough for
me to hate all things Gap, Banana Republic
and Old Navy.

Over 200 people braved 100-degree temperatures to stand in line for a Chick-fil-A
meal at the chain's restaurant in Wichita, Kan., on Aug. 1, 2012. The crowd was
buying meals to show their support for the company that's currently embroiled in a
controversy over same-sex marriage.

er. This one's easier when the corporate
crime is more chill (like being unfairly

priced) and harder when it's something evil

(like ignoring sexual assault).
Rationalize
Like a next step in the Twelve, this one
allows you to still indulge in the forbidden
fruit of a fallen company, but with the men
tal backing of some justified rationale. You
might cringe, for example, to learn that
Target gave money to support a candidate
against gay marriage but hey, they proba
bly supported him for other reasons, too,
right? One issue can't be the only thing. And
boycotting only hurts those nice ladies at the
register with long nails and two mortgages.
They need me to buy fairly priced generic
brand over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. I
ha ve friends who have worked there.

Conscientious objector
This one is a deep rationalization. A
conscientious objector does not abstain but
instead partakes in the fun, and copes by
projecting some morally correct scheme
onto the consumption. I will not deny
myself (entirely) the tender-fried-goodness
of Chick-fil-A upon my nearing pilgrimage
back to the South, not because I support not
supporting the union of gay people I do
support their union but because I will
create change from withinl I will fill out
cards, send emails, comment on FB statuses.
And it's not for naught.
Think about it. If there were no consci
entious objectors, the world would be totally

bereft of sweet uniformed-kisses photos and
the tales of gay Marine fathers that both
break the mold and inspire. That's not only
a shame; it's a disservice (no pun intended).
If all those strong gay LGBT men and
women just said "up yours" to the Army,
the Boy Scouts, the football teams and all the
other downers out there and packed it up
for theater camp, we'd have no change at all.
And that's worse than slow, painful, no
chicken change.
Find a similar substitute
Naaahh.
Rally behind the ones that are great
It's a struggle that every well-meaning
hypocrite faces: I hate when companies use
their corporate power to support
political/social agendas I don't like, but I am
all for it when it's a good one. So total bum
mer about Wal-Mart, Chick-fil-A and Boy
Scouts of America, but on the flip side, think
about how great Apple, Google and Microsoft
which all support equal rights are every
time you make a call or listen to iTunes. Heck,
just watch Ellen and feel good about it!
Boycott them completely
For only the most hardcore of princi
pled people, the boycott is an option,
though often ineffective and saddening.
Sometimes you've got to do it; sometimes it
makes no difference like my refusal to
listen to any Chris Brown song, even
though my literally quiet defiance of a frat
house iPod will affect no one. Sometimes
it's an excuse to not like something you
already think is gross but for other, less
social reasons. This photo was enough for
me to hate all things Gap, Banana Republic
and Old Navy.

Over 200 people braved 100-degree temperatures to stand in line for a Chick-fil-A
meal at the chain's restaurant in Wichita, Kan., on Aug. 1, 2012. The crowd was
buying meals to show their support for the company that's currently embroiled in a
controversy over same-sex marriage.
The world of progressive, meat-eat
ing Southerners was rocked weeks
ago when our beloved anointed,
even Chick-fil-A announced its horribly
backwards stance on gay marriage (it's
against it). Not only is this a blow because
of the general anti-free-love vibes which
are just harshing my mellow, but also
because I love Chick-fil-A. I mean, I want
to boycott the restaurant, but it's just so
good. (But is it too good?) This is no new
conundrum; people have been conflicted
with whether to buy or boycott since the
less-than-glamorous Boston Tea Party
though we'd like to believe that that self
inflicted embargo was because of the sub
jugation of India and not high tea prices.
(Get it, high tea?)
So how do we anguished aesthetes
grapple with such a seemingly inextricable
net of political incorrectness, desire, brand
image, taste and pressure from our social
networks? Well, friends, free yourself of this
inner turmoil with some tips on how to
deal when your favorite brands forget social
corporate responsibility, back the wrong
political party or just plain screw up.
Put it out of your mind
The most basic and probably most used
tactic of the woeful consumer: ignorance. It's
not for real! These peeps just feign it, don't
talk about it and politely dismiss it like a
mother looking past her eldest son's growing
cocaine addiction. Confronting the fact that
Louis Vuitton doesn't actually make its bags
by hand, that they're in fact made mostly by
machine, makes that label markup hit hard
er. This one's easier when the corporate
crime is more chill (like being unfairly

priced) and harder when it's something evil

(like ignoring sexual assault).
