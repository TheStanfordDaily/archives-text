## STUDENT LIFE Escondido Village residents postpone chemical spray 
### EDWARD NGAI NEWS EDITOR 
A group of Escondido Village (EV) res
idents have successfully delayed the pro
posed treatment of EV family courtyard
lawns with herbicides. The plan, which
would have seen the grass in all seven fami
ly courtyards sprayed with weed-killer
today, is now postponed indefinitely.
The family courtyards, home to around
250 families, underwent a renovation fi
nanced by John Arrillaga three and a half
years ago, when all the existing grass was
dug up and replaced. According to an email
sent to family courtyard subletters, the her
bicide spray was necessary to "maintain the
donor's gift."
However, Stanford Housing is adamant
that Arrillaga was never involved in the de

cision to treat the family courtyards with
herbicides.

"John Arrillaga has nothing to do with
this," said Michael VanFossen, senior asso
ciate director of graduate housing. "Colony
[Flousing's landscaping contractor]
brought the weeds to our attention, saying,
'We have done the best we can over the last
three or four years not introducing chemi
cals, but [the weeds] are really getting
bad.'"

Since the renovation, landscaping staff
have been weeding the family courtyards by
hand. However, the crabgrass and clover
had grown to the point where Colony felt
they no longer were fulfilling their land
scaping contract with the University, which
requires them to perform "high-quality
grounds/landscape maintenance." Both
Colony and Housing had agreed that herbi

cidal treatment was the best way to satisfy
their agreement.
The herbicides proposed for use in the
family courtyards are Speed Zone and Tur
flon, whose material safety data sheets cat
egorize them as hazardous to health when
inhaled. To prevent this. Housing request
ed that family courtyard residents stay in
doors and seal their windows for 48 hours
while the chemicals dry.
"I thought it was a ludicrous idea," said
Nitzan Waisberg, a professor at the design
school and family courtyard resident. "It's
mid-August, hot, and expecting people to
keep their windows and doors shut in apart
ments that don't have air conditioning or
proper ventilation except for windows ... it
was not a practical idea."
Additionally, many EV residents in the
summer are subletters and did not receive

the email notifying them of the spray and
the necessary precautions to protect them
selves and their families from the toxic ef
fects.
"I was going to flier the entire neighbor
hood to ensure everyone [knows about the
spray]," VanFossen said. "We only know
who the [original] subletters are."
Many residents, however, were not con
vinced Housing was doing enough to con
sider the potential adverse effects of the
herbicide. At a hastily-convened town hall
last week, several families expressed a lack
of confidence that the fliers would be ade
quate and were concerned about the long
lasting health effects of the chemicals.
VanFossen, insisted, however, that the
herbicides were safe.
