## 'War Horse' shines in artistry, not storytelling 
### – alexandra HEENEY contact alexandra: aheeney@stanford. edu 
The new SHN production of "War
Horse" in San Francisco is all specta
cle: amazing lights, sounds, sets, song
and staging, as well as some impressive life
sized horse puppets operated by multiple
puppeteers. "War Horse" is the epic story of
a boy and his horse before and during
World War I and tells of how both sides
took turns caring for and loving the horse; if
you saw the Spielberg film last year, this is a
less polished version of the story. The play,
however, equals, if not exceeds, the extrava
gance and drama of the film.
The "War Horse" of the tide is Joey, a
masterpiece of puppetry, with enough joints
and areas of manipulation and some
great voiced sound effects by his three pup
peteers (Jon Riddleberger, Patrick Osteen
and Jessica Krueger) to create a real,
emoting character. Though the puppeteers
are very visible on stage, which is particularly

distracting in the foal version of Joey, you
get used to ignoring them and watching the
horse itself.
Joey, a riding horse, is bought by a farm
owner (Tedd Cerveris) whose son Albert
(Brian Keane) takes charge of his training
and upkeep, including teaching him the
impossible task of pulling a plow, a skill that
will later save the horse's life. The burgeon
ing friendship between Albert and Joey is the
slowest part of the play, as it was in the film,
and exposes Keane's weak acting the most,
in large part because the dialogue he's given
to work with is so poor.
The play truly gets going when Albert's
father surreptitiously decides to sell off Joey,
for a pretty penny, to become the titular
War Horse. The stakes for Joey get higher,
and the atrocities of war expose humanity in
both sides. Albert, in turn, enlists in an effort
to find his horse.

Yes, World War I was fought with both
horses and tanks, and there's a devastating
scene when the British cavalry storm a
German camp and are surprised and obliter
ated by machine guns. The storming of the
camp feels real; multiple horses are on stage,
and the devastation is heightened by the
sounds, flashing lights and pounding score.
Waiting for the play to begin, the audi
ence can see only an empty stage with a
long, white banner present. The banner is
used to project backgrounds of the various
locations where the play takes place from
the idyllic English countryside, to the battle
field and trenches, to the war-torn French
lands and it works remarkably well,
allowing for quick and seamless transitions
between vastly different locales.
The sets are all very portable: the fence
in the marketplace where Joey is first sold to
our hero is held up by the cast but looks
entirely real; the farmhouse consists of noth
ing but a window, door and backdrop, just
enough to create the illusion of more; and
the supports for the ramp seen in the first
act become a great stand-in for the trenches
in the second.

The most impressive part of the specta
cle is the use of lights and sound. The play

has its own score by Adrian Sutton, which is
both affecting and effective, and is sung by
John Milosich, who acts as our guide. To its
credit, the emotional and sometimes har
rowing music increases the drama signifi
cantly. The terrifying battle scenes includ
ing one with a very large tank that plows
through the stage are often darkly lit,
with bright lights used sporadically for shock
factor from things like explosions, along
with very loud sound effects and scores.
These are as sophisticated as you would
expect from a polished war film, which is
highly impressive.
The play, however, differs from the
film: It is all about how to tell this continent
spanning story, with so many characters and
so much drama and war, on a stage and
make it seem real, frightening, emotional
and cohesive. The production does all of this
and more, making the highly imperfect
script forgivable. This isn't a play about
words; it's a magical and visceral experience.
"War Horse" runs through Sept. 9 at the SHN
Curran Theatre in San Francisco.

get used to ignoring them and watching the
horse itself.
Joey, a riding horse, is bought by a farm
owner (Tedd Cerveris) whose son Albert
(Brian Keane) takes charge of his training
and upkeep, including teaching him the
impossible task of pulling a plow, a skill that
will later save the horse's life. The burgeon
ing friendship between Albert and Joey is the
slowest part of the play, as it was in the film,
and exposes Keane's weak acting the most,
in large part because the dialogue he's given
to work with is so poor.
The play truly gets going when Albert's
father surreptitiously decides to sell off Joey,
for a pretty penny, to become the titular
War Horse. The stakes for Joey get higher,
and the atrocities of war expose humanity in
both sides. Albert, in turn, enlists in an effort
to find his horse.

Yes, World War I was fought with both
horses and tanks, and there's a devastating
scene when the British cavalry storm a
German camp and are surprised and obliter
ated by machine guns. The storming of the
camp feels real; multiple horses are on stage,
and the devastation is heightened by the
sounds, flashing lights and pounding score.
Waiting for the play to begin, the audi
ence can see only an empty stage with a
long, white banner present. The banner is
used to project backgrounds of the various
locations where the play takes place from
the idyllic English countryside, to the battle
field and trenches, to the war-torn French
lands and it works remarkably well,
allowing for quick and seamless transitions
between vastly different locales.
The sets are all very portable: the fence
in the marketplace where Joey is first sold to
our hero is held up by the cast but looks
entirely real; the farmhouse consists of noth
ing but a window, door and backdrop, just
enough to create the illusion of more; and
the supports for the ramp seen in the first
act become a great stand-in for the trenches
in the second.

The most impressive part of the specta
cle is the use of lights and sound. The play

has its own score by Adrian Sutton, which is
both affecting and effective, and is sung by
John Milosich, who acts as our guide. To its
credit, the emotional and sometimes har
rowing music increases the drama signifi
cantly. The terrifying battle scenes includ
ing one with a very large tank that plows
through the stage are often darkly lit,
with bright lights used sporadically for shock
factor from things like explosions, along
with very loud sound effects and scores.
These are as sophisticated as you would
expect from a polished war film, which is
highly impressive.
The play, however, differs from the
film: It is all about how to tell this continent
spanning story, with so many characters and
so much drama and war, on a stage and
make it seem real, frightening, emotional
and cohesive. The production does all of this
and more, making the highly imperfect
script forgivable. This isn't a play about
words; it's a magical and visceral experience.
