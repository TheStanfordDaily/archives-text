Keep your expectations low
and enter with caution,
and you just may be some
what impressed by "Total Recall";
otherwise, the movie simply flops.

Directed by Len Wiseman,
"Total Recall" is yet another
Hollywood remake that has suc
ceeded at nothing but crashing
and burning. The film revolves
around Douglas Quaid (Colin
Farrell), an Australian factory
worker who lives with his wife Lori
(Kate Beckinsale). In this futuristic
dystopia, chemical warfare has
destroyed most of the world, leav
ing only two inhabitable countries:
the United Federation of Britain,
which includes the United
Kingdom as well as much of

Europe, and Australia, known as
The Colony.
Quaid decides to go to Rekall,
a company that uses chemicals to
provide false memories, after feel
ing as if there is something missing
from his life. After policemen raid
Rekall and Quaid manages to fight
his way out, he soon discovers that
he is really an ex-spy who turned
against the government to work
for the Resistance, an equality
focused group. With the help of
his former partner Melina (Jessica
Biel), Quaid begins to find his true
self again as well as try to beat
Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan
Cranston), who plans on destroy

ing The Colony.
While the acting and casting
for each character was well done,
the roles are one-dimensional. A
notable example of this is
Cohaagen, who plays a typical cap
italistic, money-hungry leader.

There's little to no dimensionality
to his character, and while it can
be argued that this is because he
plays a secondary role, his charac
ter is significant enough to deserve
more depth.

In addition, the movie stum
bles in several places. To begin, the
foreshadowing is blatant and awk
ward. For example, before Quaid
finds out about his true self, he sees
a pianist in a bar and notes how he
wishes he knew how to play the
piano. Fast-forward to halfway
through the movie and you see
him miraculously playing a piano
by sense memory to decode a mes
sage he left for his future self. In
addition, the plot drags at the
beginning with slow and unneces
sary scenes, then rushes at the very
end by attempting to annihilate all
of the major enemies within the

last five minutes of the film. While
the plot itself has no problems, it
moves at an unstable pace and in a
way that makes viewing the movie
extremely difficult.
The one notable part of this
film is its "coolness" factor. The
movie's location is extremely
futuristic, and the fight scenes are
choreographed and shot in engag
ing ways. In addition, the lighting,
costumes and settings are all con
sistent in terms of color and style,

which helps give a cohesive feel to
the film.
If you're simply looking for a
short, two-hour escape from your
day-to-day life, this movie is the
one for you. However, don't be
alarmed if you find that within 24
hours, "Total Recall" has become
no more than just an insignificant
memory.
