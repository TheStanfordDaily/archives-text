## THE
						FIRST DATE FORMULA 
### â€“ heidi SIGUA contact heidi: hsigua@stanford. edu 
As the self-proclaimed presi
dent of the Forever Alone
Society, I have had my fair
share of kissing my mom at mid
night on New Year's and organiz
ing singles-only Valentine's Day
sleepover parties, where I wake up
alone with obscene things drawn
on my face and the menu screen
of "Bring It On" playing in the
background. So when a sexy
Scottish fitness trainer (let's call
him "Braveheart") asked me out
for coffee, I took full advantage
and planned a date that was unlike
any he'd ever been on, which
sparked this new summer dating
series.
I decided to take on the new
journalistic project of experiment
ing with various date ideas and
chronicling these misadventures in
an article. It is my fondest hope
that you ditch your drab movie -
and-dinner date plans and opt for
an outing that has a second-date
guarantee.
As a brave dater myself, and
with my previous amateur com
petitive eating experience, I decid
ed to take Braveheart to watch me
tackle the Hellfire Challenge at the
Smoke Eaters wing bar in
Cupertino: 12 hot wings coated in
black inferno hot sauce in 10 min
utes without water or napkins.
You do need to sign a waiver
releasing all your legal rights to sue
the restaurant for any unexpected
bleeding of orifices or accidental
contamination of your eyes with
the sauce, but it is definitely worth
it for an extra-large victory T-shirt.
Unfortunately, after a wing
and a bite of Hellfire, I started
bawling in a restaurant full of
spectators who laughed at my

defeat and then resumed watching
La Liga on the high-definition
TVs. However, this is the perfect
opportunity for brave date-goers
to lick hot sauce off each other's
fingers and experience a hot sum
mer night unknown to the likes of
Northern California. Braveheart
received extra points for bringing
me a lifetime's supply of Pepto
Bismol and running to the nearest
convenience store for milk.
The perfect follow-up to the
hot-and-heavy Hellfire Challenge
is a cool-down nighttime swim at
Half Moon Bay. The journey, a
mere 45-minute drive from
Cupertino, provides a romantic
interlude for a million conversa
tions to unfold. Listen to Frank
Ocean's sweet crooning on his new
album "channel ORANGE" and
let the serenade set an atmosphere
for the late night. On the walk
down to the beach, it is essential
that you guide your date down the
rocky pathway and take the
opportunity to hold her hand. I
offered Braveheart a piggyback
ride and won him over with my
bravado. If you're feeling particu
larly adventurous, go skinny-dip
ping and reenact that honeymoon
scene in "Breaking Dawn."
Afterward, keep each other
warm on the beach with proximity
and conversation. Be kind to each
other; the NorCal summer nights
are Siberia brutal.
It's the formula for a winning
first date and a guaranteed second.
Braveheart is already planning our
next outing.
