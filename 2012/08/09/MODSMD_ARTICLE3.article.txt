## Notes from abroad: exploring India 
### ANNA SCHICKELE 
Although I have learned many things while
interning abroad in India this summer, one of
the most unique and important, in my opin
ion is the ability to discern between differ
ent types of stares.
There 's the standard double take; I get that
from everyone in Chennai, the city in which
I'm working. There's also the way auto-rick
shaw drivers widen their eyes when they catch
sight of a moneymaking opportunity, the dis
approving glares from older women and the I
just-spotted-a-Western-sex-goddess ogles
from young men.
Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu, is one
of India's most conservative and least touristy
cities. It's got the heat of the tropics and the
world's second longest beach a strange
boast, but Chennai is proud of its garbage
lined coastline. However, even if they clean up
the beach, the 60 percent alcohol tax and early
to-bed bars (most close at 11 p.m.) are going to
prevent this city from becoming a spring break
destination. The city is sometimes described as
India's Detroit, as it's an auto-manufacturing
hub. Everyone is here because it's where the
jobs are, not because they like the city.

The same goes for me. I'm an intern for the
Institute for Financial Management and Re
search, a company that runs rural financial insti
tutions. I make 300 rupees a day, which is about
six dollars. Food is cheap, the company is also
paying for housing and Stanford bought my
plane ticket, so it really isn't as much of a terri
ble economic situation as it seems.

The three other American interns (two
from Stanford, one from Dartmouth) and I
spend our workdays on the 10th floor of an air
conditioned office building. But to get to that
office building, we walk along a refuse-filled
canal and cross four directions of traffic to
reach the company shuttle. The distance cov
ered is fairly small, but the walk can take any
where from five to 20 minutes, depending on
the level of aggression in your street-crossing
technique.
The sights, sounds and smells of the street
are overwhelming: passengers hanging out of
buses, beggars curled up and fast asleep, the
stench of human excrement, honking cars and
motorbikes and trash everywhere. Though
they are rarer, there are pleasant sensations in
the streets as well: the smell of sambar (spicy
lentil stew served with every meal), windows
full of Indian sweets, the scent of the jasmine

flowers in women's hair and the semi-silence
that fills the streets before 7 a.m. or after 9 p.m.
To Chennai's credit, it's the safest place I've
visited in the developing world. There's the
risk of getting hit by a motorcycle, but I don't
feel as if someone is looking for the opportuni
ty to seize my purse. I walked home with an
other female intern at 10 p.m. a few nights ago,
and though three different people stopped us

to tell us it was unsafe to be out so late, the fact
that they seemed so legitimately concerned for

our safety was reassuring.
But no matter what I do wear kurtis
(long tunics) instead of Western clothes,
straighten my curly hair, learn a few words of
Tamil I will attract gapes and stares. And in
this country there are enough surprising,
amusing and cringe-inducing scenes to make
me forget my manners and stare back at them.

Stanford students are making an impact abroad over the summer, some even as faraway
as India. Working in "India's Detroit," Schickele recounts her experiences this summer.
