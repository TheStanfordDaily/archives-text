"Just because you are smart
and deeply knowledgeable about
something does not mean you will
be an excellent teacher," said
Kirstin Milks Ph.D. 'O9 M.A. 'lO.

Milks, a current high school sci
ence teacher at Bloomington High
School South in Bloomington,
Ind., is a former student of the
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP). After completing
her doctorate in biochemistry.
Milks looked into teaching as a
means of bringing together her
love of collaborative learning and
science. She decided to enroll with
STEP to explore these combined
interests.

"I knew I wanted the time and
resources to develop integrated
understandings of teaching, learn
ing, students and science," she said
of choosing the program.
STEP, established in 1959, is an
intensive, yearlong masters pro
gram at the Stanford University
School of Education (SUSE) that
offers teaching credentials for as
piring K-12 teachers like Milks.
"We are preparing elementary

and secondary teachers, and we
are preparing them to do their best
to serve students, their families
and the communities in which they
live," said Rachel Lotan M.A. 'Bl
'B3 Ph.D. 'B5, director of STEP.

The overarching program in
cludes STEP Elementary and
STEP Secondary the elemen
tary program for aspiring teachers
interested in educating multiple
subject classes in elementary
schools and the secondary pro
gram for teachers interested in in
structing single-subject classes in
high school.

Classes are taught based on re
search and techniques developed
by SUSE, which investigates areas
such as the use of technology in
teaching and how society con
tributes to what kids do in schools.
"We use state-of-the-art theo
ries and findings to support the
work that we do," Lotan said. "We
want to prepare the teacher candi
dates to support their students in
learning."

Admission to the program is
highly selective, and STEP looks
for a pool of diverse candidates
who have experience with youth
and strong academic backgrounds.

not exclusively Stanford gradu
ates.

In addition, Ira Lit '9O M.A. '9l
Ph.D. 'O3, assistant professor of
teaching at STEP, says that 50 per
cent of the program's admits are
students of color, and a large num
ber of them are first-generation
college admits in their families.

"We welcome and are excited
by a diverse pool of applicants of
all cultures, races, religions and
ethnic origins, with wide-ranging
interests and experiences," he said.
However, the most important
characteristic for any prospective
STEP student is, without a doubt, a
genuine love for teaching. For
STEP professor Maren Aukerman,
educating youth should be any
prospective student's main priority
when considering the program.
"[You] really [need to] think
about what is exciting to you about
engaging with kids and really
make it about kids rather than
about you," she said. "I think that
if the focus is really on what kids
are doing and what kids are able to
do, and if that gets you excited,
STEP'S the place for you."
For Lotan, this dedication and
focus is also what makes STEP stu

dents and, eventually, STEP
teachers stand out.

"[The students] are an incredi
ble group of people who can do
anything they want to do, and they
choose to become teachers," she
said. "Basically, they choose the
profession that makes all the other
professions possible."
In STEP classrooms, not only
do students learn about current re
search and education techniques,
but a large emphasis is also put on
having students reflect concretely
on their practice and the teaching
techniques that they have devel
oped.

"We have students videotape
themselves, generate transcripts
and analyze [their work]," Auker
man said. "There is an emphasis on
looking at what the students them
selves are doing in the classroom
and trying to make sense of it to
improve instruction."
Furthermore, Aukerman sees
the attention that the program puts
into educating its students and
preparing them for their futures in
the classroom as the largest con
tributing factor to her success and
