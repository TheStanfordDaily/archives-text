## Cheriton's investments fuel Valley 
### KYLIEJUE DAILY INTERN 
A musician, windsurfer and Stan
ford computer science professor,
David Cheriton has many interests.
However, as the 19th-richest Canadi
an and a successful investor, he is best
known for his interest in startups.
"I get very excited about the no
tion of doing new and different
things," Cheriton said.
Born in Vancouver, Canada,
Cheriton was the third of six children.
After moving to Edmonton at the
age of five, he developed a passion for
music while attending public school.
He studied musical theater at the
Banff School of Fine Arts for two
summers and has performed in mul
tiple opera choruses and musical pro
ductions.

"I look back and think that
[music] was a good way to keep sane.
Otherwise, I was quite involved in
more mathematical and technical
things," Cheriton said.

Cheriton remembers his first in
troduction to computers during the
"prehistoric times" of his late high
school years.
"I recall my math teacher bringing
up the topic of computers... but I'm
not sure I had ever seen one before,"
Cheriton said. "It was the first time it
was really brought to my attention,
and it wasn't until the first year at my
university that I actually used a com
puter."

He went on to pursue his interest
in mathematics and later computer
science as an undergraduate at the
University of British Columbia. He
then received his master's and doc
torate at the University of Waterloo.
In 1981, after being hired at Stanford,
Cheriton came to the school "to try
something different."
"Stanford had a worldwide repu
tation in computing, so it felt like an
opportunity to 'run with the big boys,'
so to speak," Cheriton said. "I
thought I'd give it a try and see
whether I could measure up."
But the turning point of Cheri
ton's career came in 1995 when he be

came involved with a startup called
Granite Systems. Cisco would later
purchase the company for $220 mil
lion, only 14 months after Granite
had been established. The sale of
Granite Systems provided Cheriton
with the capital necessary to test his
luck with other business ventures.
"For the longest time when I was
a professor, I didn't really have any
money to invest," Cheriton said.
"Kind of overnight, more or less, I
went from worrying about how to
pay the mortgage to posing whether I
should just pay off the mortgage and
not think about it ever again."
Since then, Stanford students
have come to Cheriton to ask him to
invest in their companies or simply
give advice. After Granite Systems,
he contributed to a wide variety of Sil
icon Valley startups. His most well
known investment remains the
$lOO,OOO check he gave to Stanford
Ph.D. students Larry Page M.S. '9B
and Sergey Brin '95 M.S. '9B, the
founders of Google.
"I started having people come to
me that were interested in starting a
company and looking for financial
support," Cheriton said. "I felt com
pelled to help them because other
people had helped me out along the
way to get to where I was."
Besides investing, Cheriton has
also served on advisory boards or the
boards of directors for the companies
he has helped. With his expertise in
both computer science and business,
