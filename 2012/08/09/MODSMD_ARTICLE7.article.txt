## Cheriton's investments fuel Valley 
### KYLIEJUE DAILY INTERN 
A musician, windsurfer and Stan
ford computer science professor,
David Cheriton has many interests.
However, as the 19th-richest Canadi
an and a successful investor, he is best
known for his interest in startups.
"I get very excited about the no
tion of doing new and different
things," Cheriton said.
Born in Vancouver, Canada,
Cheriton was the third of six children.
After moving to Edmonton at the
age of five, he developed a passion for
music while attending public school.
He studied musical theater at the
Banff School of Fine Arts for two
summers and has performed in mul
tiple opera choruses and musical pro
ductions.

"I look back and think that
[music] was a good way to keep sane.
Otherwise, I was quite involved in
more mathematical and technical
things," Cheriton said.

Cheriton remembers his first in
troduction to computers during the
"prehistoric times" of his late high
school years.
"I recall my math teacher bringing
up the topic of computers... but I'm
not sure I had ever seen one before,"
Cheriton said. "It was the first time it
was really brought to my attention,
and it wasn't until the first year at my
university that I actually used a com
puter."

He went on to pursue his interest
in mathematics and later computer
science as an undergraduate at the
University of British Columbia. He
then received his master's and doc
torate at the University of Waterloo.
In 1981, after being hired at Stanford,
Cheriton came to the school "to try
something different."
"Stanford had a worldwide repu
tation in computing, so it felt like an
opportunity to 'run with the big boys,'
so to speak," Cheriton said. "I
thought I'd give it a try and see
whether I could measure up."
But the turning point of Cheri
ton's career came in 1995 when he be

came involved with a startup called
Granite Systems. Cisco would later
purchase the company for $220 mil
lion, only 14 months after Granite
had been established. The sale of
Granite Systems provided Cheriton
with the capital necessary to test his
luck with other business ventures.
"For the longest time when I was
a professor, I didn't really have any
money to invest," Cheriton said.
"Kind of overnight, more or less, I
went from worrying about how to
pay the mortgage to posing whether I
should just pay off the mortgage and
not think about it ever again."
Since then, Stanford students
have come to Cheriton to ask him to
invest in their companies or simply
give advice. After Granite Systems,
he contributed to a wide variety of Sil
icon Valley startups. His most well
known investment remains the
$lOO,OOO check he gave to Stanford
Ph.D. students Larry Page M.S. '9B
and Sergey Brin '95 M.S. '9B, the
founders of Google.
"I started having people come to
me that were interested in starting a
company and looking for financial
support," Cheriton said. "I felt com
pelled to help them because other
people had helped me out along the
way to get to where I was."
Besides investing, Cheriton has
also served on advisory boards or the
boards of directors for the companies
he has helped. With his expertise in
both computer science and business,

he has not only interacted with
other investors but has also
brought in customers and
worked on product ideas.
Sam Liang M.S. '99 Ph.D.
'O3, founder of technology
startup Alohar Mobile, really
appreciates what Cheriton
taught him. Having complet
ed his doctorate in electrical
engineering under Cheriton,
Liang asked him for advice re
garding a technology startup
he was considering founding,
which would create more ad
vanced mobile location tech
nology. Even 10 years after his
graduation, Liang values
Cheriton's high standards and
harsh criticism.

"[Cheriton] is the shaipest
person I've ever met," Liang
said. "He thinks differently,
and he taught us to think dif
ferently: don't just follow the
herd or the fad. He wants his
students to think big and try to
figure out away to change the
world."

When it comes to invest
ing, Cheriton explained that
he prefers to contribute to

companies that offer products
or services that he would per
sonally like to use, such as
Google's high-end search en
gine. In addition, he certainly
never feels pressured to follow
the crowd.

"I have always really ap
preciated his almost complete
disregard for what is fashion
able or politically correct or
conventional wisdom," said
one of Cheriton's first doctoral
students, Willy Zwaenepoel
M.S. 'BOPh.D. 'B5. Zwaenepoel
now works at Ecole Polytech
nique Federate de Lausanne, a
Swiss engineering school.
"In the beginning I was
completely flabbergasted by
his irreverence for what I
thought were well-accepted
principles," Zwaenepoel said.
"But over time I came to see
how it really opens one's eyes
to new ways of addressing
problems."
Yet despite his success in
the industry, Cheriton values
the changes he has made to
the field of computer science
over the money he has earned
through his investments.
"I don't really find the
money element that interest
ing," he said. "It's sort of a nec
essary evil to make new things
a success."

Through his research at
Stanford, Cheriton has worked
toward improving today's
technology. He is known for
helping to introduce multicast,
which allows a single source to
deliver information to multiple
places, to the Internet, and he is
currently studying snapshot
isolation in relation to building
distributed applications. The
idea involves creating applica
tions that will run across multi
ple computers based on a con
sistent "snapshot." For exam
ple, Google runs across a large
number of computers at once,
and even though some might
fail, the software uses snapshot
isolation so that those failures
are not seen by any of the users.
"I viewthat I'm just one lit
tle piece of all the research
going on in computer sci
ence," Cheriton said.

No matter what he studies
or invests in, Cheriton contin
ues to enjoy his work and har
bors no plans for his retire
ment, despite his 30-plus years
on the Farm.

"I really like what I'm
doing," Cheriton said. "I'm
working harder than I ever
have."

garding a technology startup
he was considering founding,
which would create more ad
vanced mobile location tech
nology. Even 10 years after his
graduation, Liang values
Cheriton's high standards and
harsh criticism.

"[Cheriton] is the shaipest
person I've ever met," Liang
said. "He thinks differently,
and he taught us to think dif
ferently: don't just follow the
herd or the fad. He wants his
students to think big and try to
figure out away to change the
world."

When it comes to invest
ing, Cheriton explained that
he prefers to contribute to

companies that offer products
or services that he would per
sonally like to use, such as
Google's high-end search en
gine. In addition, he certainly
never feels pressured to follow
the crowd.

"I have always really ap
preciated his almost complete
disregard for what is fashion
able or politically correct or
conventional wisdom," said
one of Cheriton's first doctoral
students, Willy Zwaenepoel
M.S. 'BOPh.D. 'B5. Zwaenepoel
now works at Ecole Polytech
nique Federate de Lausanne, a
Swiss engineering school.
"In the beginning I was
completely flabbergasted by
his irreverence for what I
thought were well-accepted
principles," Zwaenepoel said.
"But over time I came to see
how it really opens one's eyes
to new ways of addressing
problems."
Yet despite his success in
the industry, Cheriton values
the changes he has made to
the field of computer science
over the money he has earned
through his investments.
"I don't really find the
money element that interest
ing," he said. "It's sort of a nec
essary evil to make new things
a success."

Through his research at
Stanford, Cheriton has worked
toward improving today's
technology. He is known for
helping to introduce multicast,
which allows a single source to
deliver information to multiple
places, to the Internet, and he is
currently studying snapshot
isolation in relation to building
distributed applications. The
idea involves creating applica
tions that will run across multi
ple computers based on a con
sistent "snapshot." For exam
ple, Google runs across a large
number of computers at once,
and even though some might
fail, the software uses snapshot
isolation so that those failures
are not seen by any of the users.
"I viewthat I'm just one lit
tle piece of all the research
going on in computer sci
ence," Cheriton said.

No matter what he studies
or invests in, Cheriton contin
ues to enjoy his work and har
bors no plans for his retire
ment, despite his 30-plus years
on the Farm.

"I really like what I'm
doing," Cheriton said. "I'm
working harder than I ever
have."

A musician, windsurfer and Stan
ford computer science professor,
David Cheriton has many interests.
However, as the 19th-richest Canadi
an and a successful investor, he is best
known for his interest in startups.
"I get very excited about the no
tion of doing new and different
things," Cheriton said.
Born in Vancouver, Canada,
Cheriton was the third of six children.
After moving to Edmonton at the
age of five, he developed a passion for
music while attending public school.
He studied musical theater at the
Banff School of Fine Arts for two
summers and has performed in mul
tiple opera choruses and musical pro
ductions.

"I look back and think that
[music] was a good way to keep sane.
Otherwise, I was quite involved in
more mathematical and technical
things," Cheriton said.

Cheriton remembers his first in
troduction to computers during the
"prehistoric times" of his late high
school years.
"I recall my math teacher bringing
up the topic of computers... but I'm
not sure I had ever seen one before,"
Cheriton said. "It was the first time it
was really brought to my attention,
and it wasn't until the first year at my
university that I actually used a com
puter."

He went on to pursue his interest
in mathematics and later computer
science as an undergraduate at the
University of British Columbia. He
then received his master's and doc
torate at the University of Waterloo.
In 1981, after being hired at Stanford,
Cheriton came to the school "to try
something different."
"Stanford had a worldwide repu
tation in computing, so it felt like an
opportunity to 'run with the big boys,'
so to speak," Cheriton said. "I
thought I'd give it a try and see
whether I could measure up."
But the turning point of Cheri
ton's career came in 1995 when he be

came involved with a startup called
Granite Systems. Cisco would later
purchase the company for $220 mil
lion, only 14 months after Granite
had been established. The sale of
Granite Systems provided Cheriton
with the capital necessary to test his
luck with other business ventures.
"For the longest time when I was
a professor, I didn't really have any
money to invest," Cheriton said.
"Kind of overnight, more or less, I
went from worrying about how to
pay the mortgage to posing whether I
should just pay off the mortgage and
not think about it ever again."
Since then, Stanford students
have come to Cheriton to ask him to
invest in their companies or simply
give advice. After Granite Systems,
he contributed to a wide variety of Sil
icon Valley startups. His most well
known investment remains the
$lOO,OOO check he gave to Stanford
Ph.D. students Larry Page M.S. '9B
and Sergey Brin '95 M.S. '9B, the
founders of Google.
"I started having people come to
me that were interested in starting a
company and looking for financial
support," Cheriton said. "I felt com
pelled to help them because other
people had helped me out along the
way to get to where I was."
Besides investing, Cheriton has
also served on advisory boards or the
boards of directors for the companies
he has helped. With his expertise in
both computer science and business,

he has not only interacted with
other investors but has also
brought in customers and
worked on product ideas.

startup Alohar Mobile, really
appreciates what Cheriton
taught him. Having complet
ed his doctorate in electrical
engineering under Cheriton,
