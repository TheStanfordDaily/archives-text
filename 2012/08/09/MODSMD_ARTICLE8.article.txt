# STUDENT LIFE
## RISE opens doors to science careers 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
Despite the early morning car
pools and two-hour bus rides,
Deng-Tung Wang makes the long
commute to Stanford University
four times a week. Previously, a
"normal" summer for him involved
teaching younger kids at his moth
er's summer camp. But this sum
mer, Wang's work environment
was a little bit different; he took
part in the Raising Interest in Sci
ence and Engineering (RISE) sum
mer internship.
RISE, recognizing the lack of
opportunities for underrepresent
ed or underprivileged youth, aims
to help students further their inter
ests and careers in the sciences
through a seven-week, hands-on in
ternship. The program targets high
schoolers who are historically not
well-represented in the science,
technology, engineering and math
ematics (STEM) pipeline or are
from low-income families. Many
are the first in their family to attend
college.
"RISE has a focus on students

who may not have other opportuni
ties and resources available to
them," said Kaye Storm, director of
the program's Office of Science
Outreach. "They all have good
grades, good academic records, but
they don't necessarily have a net
work or family support to help
them explore a career in science
and engineering."

RISE students are Bay Area
high schoolers paired with a mentor
and, in some cases, a professor, to
work on research projects. Some
are from underrepresented back
grounds; others are from low-in
come families.

Wang is one of the 25 students
interning at RISE this summer. A
rising senior at Leigh High School
in San Jose, Wang worked on a pro
ject involving biomolecules with
mentor Michael Keeney, a post
doctoral research fellow, and Fan
Yang, a biomedical engineering
professor. Wang worked very
closely with his postdoctoral men
tor, but he also met with Yang once
a week for a scheduled meeting and
discussion of the data.

According to Storm, most RISE

students work mainly with their
postdoctoral mentors. For their re
search, they are compensated with
a $2,500 stipend funded by family
and corporate foundations like
Genentech and Microsoft. Accord
ing to Storm, these corporations'
generosity is crucial to the program.
"The reason that we even pay
them and don't just have them
come as volunteers is because ...

most of them need to work during
the summer, either because they're
saving for college or, in some cases,
just to help support the family,"
Storm said. "I mean, it's great to
have volunteer programs, but you
are then closing yourself off to the
lowest income kids who just can't
afford to be a volunteer for the
summer."

Despite what seem to be long
odds for many of these students, all
RISE alumni have gone on to col
lege and most, around 80 percent,
major in the sciences.
For Wang, RISE'S opportunity
exposed him to opportunities in
the sciences. With his school
facing financial difficulties,
high-tech experiments like
those at Stanford were not
options open for Wang until
RISE. Consequently,
Wang said that the experi
ence helped him narrow his
broad interest in biology to
a more specific field cur
rently, bioengineering. But
the challenges of lab sci
ence were not lost on him.

"One thing I really got
out of this entire experience
was how hard and how diffi
cult science can be and how
important careful proce
dure or precise data analysis
proved to be when it comes
to presentations or the actu
al, overall project experi

ence," he said. "[Until now],
I really had no idea what sci
ence in a lab setting was re
ally about."

This sort of hands-on sci
ence education is the prima
ry goal of RISE, according
to Storm. With the United
States facing more interna
tional competition than
ever before in the fields of
science and technology,
Storm is convinced that sci
ence programs for under
represented youth can im
pact far more than just the
youth involved.
"I think for our country's
global competitiveness, we
need a workforce that is
very strong in science and
engineering, and if we can
do that in a more home
grown way... that's all the
better," she said.
