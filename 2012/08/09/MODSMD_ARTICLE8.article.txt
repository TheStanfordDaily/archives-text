# STUDENT LIFE
## RISE opens doors to science careers 
### HAELIN CHO DAILY INTERN 
Despite the early morning car
pools and two-hour bus rides,
Deng-Tung Wang makes the long
commute to Stanford University
four times a week. Previously, a
"normal" summer for him involved
teaching younger kids at his moth
er's summer camp. But this sum
mer, Wang's work environment
was a little bit different; he took
part in the Raising Interest in Sci
ence and Engineering (RISE) sum
mer internship.
RISE, recognizing the lack of
opportunities for underrepresent
ed or underprivileged youth, aims
to help students further their inter
ests and careers in the sciences
through a seven-week, hands-on in
ternship. The program targets high
schoolers who are historically not
well-represented in the science,
technology, engineering and math
ematics (STEM) pipeline or are
from low-income families. Many
are the first in their family to attend
college.
"RISE has a focus on students

who may not have other opportuni
ties and resources available to
them," said Kaye Storm, director of
the program's Office of Science
Outreach. "They all have good
grades, good academic records, but
they don't necessarily have a net
work or family support to help
them explore a career in science
and engineering."

RISE students are Bay Area
high schoolers paired with a mentor
and, in some cases, a professor, to
work on research projects. Some
are from underrepresented back
grounds; others are from low-in
come families.

Wang is one of the 25 students
interning at RISE this summer. A
rising senior at Leigh High School
in San Jose, Wang worked on a pro
ject involving biomolecules with
mentor Michael Keeney, a post
doctoral research fellow, and Fan
Yang, a biomedical engineering
professor. Wang worked very
closely with his postdoctoral men
tor, but he also met with Yang once
a week for a scheduled meeting and
discussion of the data.

According to Storm, most RISE

students work mainly with their
postdoctoral mentors. For their re
search, they are compensated with
a $2,500 stipend funded by family
and corporate foundations like
Genentech and Microsoft. Accord
ing to Storm, these corporations'
generosity is crucial to the program.
"The reason that we even pay
them and don't just have them
come as volunteers is because ...

most of them need to work during
the summer, either because they're
saving for college or, in some cases,
just to help support the family,"
Storm said. "I mean, it's great to
have volunteer programs, but you
are then closing yourself off to the
lowest income kids who just can't
afford to be a volunteer for the
summer."

Despite what seem to be long
odds for many of these students, all
RISE alumni have gone on to col
lege and most, around 80 percent,
major in the sciences.
For Wang, RISE'S opportunity
