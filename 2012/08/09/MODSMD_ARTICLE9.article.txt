## BETWEEN EAST AND WEST The
						price of produce 
### Fatima Wagdy 
Imagine buying a pound of
tomatoes for only 15 cents. I did
just that yesterday here in
Cairo. At a farmers' market, I
could have bargained down to just
8 cents per pound for tomatoes that
taste much better, in my opinion,
than the ones in the U.S. The aver
age price of regular tomatoes in
America was $1.28 per pound in
2011, according to the USDA. I
learned over time that not only are
many fruits and vegetables much
cheaper here in Egypt, but they are
often more affordable than
processed and packaged foods.
And I think that's the way it should
be for the sake of a healthier society.
I noticed that while a pound of
green peppers normally costs
around 30 cents, a big bag of chips
costs around 50 cents and a box of
cereal could easily cost at least $2.
In poorer areas, it is difficult to
even find processed foods or "junk
food" to purchase; here, it is the rel
atively wealthier families who eat
at McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut.
Cheaper produce means that low
income families can have a relative
ly healthy diet and avoid many of
the health problems that result
from the overconsumption of nu
trient-deficient processed foods.
The USDA promotes a bal
anced diet that consists of several
fruit and vegetable servings per
day. However, it is evident after a
quick stroll through Safeway that
fruits and vegetables are very ex
pensive compared to chips, soda
and Twinkies. Students on a bud
get often buy ramen noodles and
other snacks not just because they
are quick and easy to make, but
also because they are cheap. Stud
ies have shown that price is in fact
a barrier to eating more fruits and
vegetables for low-income families
in the U.S. This tells us that low-in
come families buy fewer fruits and
vegetables and usually have a less
balanced diet, in part because of

the cost of buying fresh produce.

The stark contrast between the
cost of produce in Egypt and that
in the U.S. suggests that maybe the
U.S. should focus on making fruits
and vegetables more affordable.
There are countless campaigns
aimed at getting children to eat
healthy and to get their daily serv
ings of fruits and vegetables, but
until it makes financial sense for
families to buy fruits and vegeta
bles, they are unlikely to do so.
And maybe after eating so much
processed food day after day, peo
ple forget why they were buying it
in the first place; they buy certain
things out of habit. This conclusion
is not new; it is quite obvious, to
some economists at least, that the
relatively high price of produce is
related to lower levels of fruit and
vegetable consumption among
low-income families in America.

Perhaps it is likely that if pro
duce had been as cheap as
processed alternatives for the past
few decades, more people would
be eating their daily-recommend
ed servings of fruits and vegeta
bles. Maybe we wouldn't have
such a high rate of obesity and
other conditions that result from
unhealthy diets?
All of this suggests that, right
now in the U.S., produce is too ex
pensive and many people do not
have a healthy diet as a result. My
experience in Egypt suggests that
this country does not have such a
problem, and 1 wonder why. Why
is it almost a luxury to eat fruits and
vegetables in the U.S. whereas it is
the norm in a less de veloped coun
try? Shouldn't the country that is
theoretically more advanced have
solved such a problem earlier on?
Perhaps we are not as advanced
in some ways as we might think.
