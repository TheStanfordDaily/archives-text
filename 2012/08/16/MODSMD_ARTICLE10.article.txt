# On mental health
## 
### SARAH ALLEN CASSANEGO '04 
I recently learned of the
tragic death of Saman
tha Wopat 'l4. Shocked
by the death of a current
student, I turned to Google
and The Stanford Daily to
learn more about Saman
tha. I was devastated to find
out that she died one week
after attempting suicide. I
was also disheartened to
discover that many in the
Stanford community feel
that the University does
not effectively communi
cate about or address men
tal illness on campus.
During my senior year
at Stanford (2003-04), I
was diagnosed with de
pression. I struggled to
stay interested in anything
but sleeping and spent
hours crying without
knowing why. Added to
the sense of hopelessness
were feelings of shame and
embarrassment how
could I possibly feel sad on
the Farm? Everyone else
around me (I thought) was
accomplished and happy,
reveling in the California
sunshine and the dynamic
academic environment.
What was wrong with me?
In April of that year, I
wrote a letter to the editor
of The Daily about an in
sensitive ad the paper ran
that referenced mental ill
ness. Writing the letter
was cathartic and empow
ering, but I was nervous
about what the reaction
would be from people I
knew. However, I only re
member one person even
mentioning the letter to
me, looking incredibly em
barrassed as he did so.
I'm sad to learn that

eight years later, Stanford
is still struggling to get this
right.

Stanford is an amazing
place. I would not trade
my four years there for
anything. But entering
freshmen, all high achiev
ers in some way, can find it
hard to adjust when they
arrive on campus and dis
cover that at Stanford,
they are ordinary. Some
might read this and think I
am a snob, or somehow
ungrateful, or completely
lacking in perspective. I
thought all of those things
about myself as I struggled
to rediscover my sense of
self-worth in a university
community where I was
surrounded by some of the
smartest and most accom
plished people on the
planet. I knew I was so
lucky to be at Stanford. I
knew I was surrounded by
amazing people. I knew I
should be happy. And that
kind of pressure con
tributed significantly to
my depression.
Everyone has heard
the cliche about Stanford
students and the duck syn
drome. I've heard count
less students and alumni
(myself included) de
scribe it with pride. But it
perpetuates the expecta
tion that if you aren't
happy, you are supposed
to figure out how to fake
it. Keep up the image of
the brilliant but relaxed
Stanford student. The
tragedy of Samantha
Wopat's death demon
strates how truly damag
ing this expectation can
be. Struggling to be
happy, to fit in, to find
your niche, to discover
your passion is not fail
ure and should not be
something students feel
pressured to hide.
I'll close the same way I
closed my letter eight
years ago: if you are read
ing this and are struggling
with depression, please get
help. I promise things
really can and will get better.
