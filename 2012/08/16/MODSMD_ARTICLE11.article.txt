## FOOTBALL WORKLOAD ONLY GROWS FOR HEWITT 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford football's "Mr. Do Everything" is
going to have to do even more this season.
Redshirt junior fullback Ryan Hewitt more
than earned that label from head coach David
Shaw in 2011. He blocked dominantly for the
one of the nation's top 20 rushing attacks,
pounded the ball forward in short-yardage sit
uations and averaged three receptions a game
out of the backfield.

Despite the exodus of four top offensive
players to the NFL, the Cardinal's offensive
scheme has remained mostly intact but all
the small changes will fall squarely in Hewitt's
lap. Without Luck's passing talent to buoy the
offense, Hewitt's run blocking will be in higher
demand; without departed running backs Jere
my Stewart and Tyler Gaffney, Hewitt is likely
to pick up a few more carries; and without an
other game-tested player to fill Coby Fleener's
slot in the Cardinal's triple-tight-end forma
tions, Hewitt could be called on to catch even
more passes.

Shaw may have to limit his go-to guy more
than in the past to keep him healthy.
"We've got a great rotation there," he said.
"Ryan absolutely hates it because he hates
coming off the field. He wants to take every
rep in practice. He gets mad when we pull him
out, but we have to preserve him to a certain
degree."

"We're one of the few teams in college foot
ball that has three fullbacks," Shaw added.
Besides helmet-popping junior Geoff
Meinken, who is not practicing due to injury,
the Cardinal will benefit from redshirt sopho
more Lee Ward, who played in eight games
last season, and talented redshirt freshman
Patrick Skov.

"All the fullbacks have their specialties,"
Hewitt said.

Hewitt's specialty is his pass-catching abili-
ty. A tight end in high school, he
was third on the team in touch
downs with five last year, many of
his receptions coming on the infa
mous "Spider 3 Y Banana" play
featured in Jon Gruden's QB
Camp session with Luck on
ESPN.

"A lot of the times we call
those on third downs, third-and
shorts or fourth downs and
they're crucial situations when
you need to covert," Hewitt said.
"So I just do my best, if I'm open,
to catch the rock and get upfield."
Those receptions, however,
add to the heavy physical strain
already placed on a fullback,
making the contributions from
Meinken, Ward and Skov an

abundance of wealth at a position
that has declined in college with
the rise of spread-option offenses

all the more important for this
season. But the slot has paid divi
dends enormously for Stanford's
pro-style scheme in recent years,
starting with current Cleveland
Browns fullback Owen Marecic,
who paved the way for Toby Ger
hart's Heisman Trophy runner
up campaign in 2009.
Like the pass-catching Hewitt,
Marecic was a workhorse, dou
bling as a linebacker his senior
year to garner several Heisman
votes and earn the national Paul
Hornung Award for his versatili
ty. It's a trait that Hewitt has also
worked to embody, albeit entire
ly on the offensive side of the
ball.

"The more versatile you are,
the more you can play, and the
more slots you fit in," Hewitt
said. "I had a pretty good pedi

gree for catching the ba11... it's
helped me play and it helped me
have a good year last year."

His transition at fullback went
as well as hoped for in 2011. Stan
ford's run production stayed
steady (dipping from 2,779 to
2,738 yards) and Hewitt's 317 all
purpose yards nearly doubled
Marecic's total (160) from the
year before. Even Hewitt's curly
yellow hair seems to continue, if
not one-up, his predecessor's
work; Marecic sported his own
distinctive mane until he joined
the Browns.

"It'll be here for the season,
that's a guarantee," Hewitt said
of his own hair. "We'll see about
after though."
