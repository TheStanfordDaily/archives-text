## FOOTBALL WORKLOAD ONLY GROWS FOR HEWITT 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SUMMER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford football's "Mr. Do Everything" is
going to have to do even more this season.
Redshirt junior fullback Ryan Hewitt more
than earned that label from head coach David
Shaw in 2011. He blocked dominantly for the
one of the nation's top 20 rushing attacks,
pounded the ball forward in short-yardage sit

"We've got a great rotation there," he said.
"Ryan absolutely hates it because he hates
coming off the field. He wants to take every
rep in practice. He gets mad when we pull him

Besides helmet-popping junior Geoff
Meinken, who is not practicing due to injury,
the Cardinal will benefit from redshirt sopho
more Lee Ward, who played in eight games
last season, and talented redshirt freshman
Patrick Skov.

"All the fullbacks have their specialties,"
Hewitt said.

Hewitt's specialty is his pass-catching abili-
