# The
						Decision Awaits

### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS EDITOR 
When the Cardinal football players trot
ted off the University of Phoenix field in Jan
uary, two different blows were dealt to the
Stanford faithful. Losing the Fiesta Bowl to
Oklahoma State was the immediate sting,
but losing once-in-a-generation quarterback
Andrew Luck to the NFL was, in the big pic
ture, the deeper wound. The inevitable ques
tion that no one was concerned with sudden

ly surfaced as one of the most pressing dilem
mas for the future of Stanford football: Who's
going to replace number 12 at starting quar
terback?

Fast-forward to August, and that all-im
portant question remains unanswered with
the season opener against San Jose State just
over two weeks away. But decision time is
looming. After Saturday's open practice that
consisted of a short scrimmage, head coach
David Shaw stated that the starting quarter
back would hopefully be chosen sometime

this week.

"I didn't want to make a quick decision,"
Shaw said. "I wanted to go as long as possible,
as long as prudent, because that way we get to
see as much data as possible. I wanted to
make sure the quarterbacks worked hard all
summer knowing that they were coming in
with competition and give them at least two
weeks to get after it and show us everything
they have."

competition for the starting quarterback role. Coach David Shaw stated that a decision would hopefully be made some time this week.
