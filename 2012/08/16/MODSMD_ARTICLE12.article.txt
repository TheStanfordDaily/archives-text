# The 						Decision Awaits
## 
### GEORGE CHEN SPORTS EDITOR 
When the Cardinal football players trot
ted off the University of Phoenix field in Jan
uary, two different blows were dealt to the
Stanford faithful. Losing the Fiesta Bowl to
Oklahoma State was the immediate sting,
but losing once-in-a-generation quarterback
Andrew Luck to the NFL was, in the big pic
ture, the deeper wound. The inevitable ques
tion that no one was concerned with sudden

ly surfaced as one of the most pressing dilem
mas for the future of Stanford football: Who's
going to replace number 12 at starting quar
terback?

Fast-forward to August, and that all-im
portant question remains unanswered with
the season opener against San Jose State just
over two weeks away. But decision time is
looming. After Saturday's open practice that
consisted of a short scrimmage, head coach
David Shaw stated that the starting quarter
back would hopefully be chosen sometime

this week.

"I didn't want to make a quick decision,"
Shaw said. "I wanted to go as long as possible,
as long as prudent, because that way we get to
see as much data as possible. I wanted to
make sure the quarterbacks worked hard all
summer knowing that they were coming in
with competition and give them at least two
weeks to get after it and show us everything
they have."

Redshirf junior Josh Nunes (left) and redshirt sophomore Brett Nottingham (right) are the frontrunners in the closely contested
competition for the starting quarterback role. Coach David Shaw stated that a decision would hopefully be made some time this week.
Redshirt sophomore Brett Not
tingham and redshirt junior Josh
Nunes are the two front-runners in
the tightly contested race.
Nottingham played in six games
last season, mostly performing mop
up duty behind Luck. In those ap
pearances, he completed five of eight
pass attempts for 78 yards and a
touchdown. While playing under
center for Monte Vista High School
in Danville, Calif., he was a four-star
prospect and one of the top high
school, pro-style quarterbacks in the
country ranked as high as fourth
by Rivals.com.

Nunes saw action in four games
during the 2010 season as the prima
ry backup quarterback on the depth
chart, completing one of two passes
for seven yards against Wake Forest.
The 6-foot-4 Upland, Calif., native,
who be will be entering his fourth
collegiate season, was also a four-star
recruit and ranked the 13th-best pro
style quarterback in high school by
Rivals.com.

As former backups, both players
voiced great appreciation for the
valuable learning experience of play
ing behind Luck.
"That's the beauty of what we
have," Nunes said. "I was behind
Andrew for three years, which is one
of the biggest blessings you can have.
Seeing how he handled it from a
mental standpoint as well as a physi
cal standpoint was huge. You can
look at these drills [in practice] and
see what kind of attitude he had

coming in, and you try to replicate
that."

"I tell myself if I don't think about
what Andrew did these past two
years, I would've taken them for
granted," Nottingham noted. "I
learned so much from sitting behind
him and I try to play through him vic
ariously. I saw all the amazing things
he did. So when I'm preparing now, I
try to think about what he would've
done."

Given that the Stanford offense
contains nearly 300 plays, master
ing the voluminous playbook is a
quarterback skill that is as impor
tant as it is challenging. But both
quarterbacks expressed confidence
in their understanding of the plays.
Nunes believes that knowing the
playbook is one of his "strong
points" as he has it "pretty down
pat." Although Nottingham has
one less season under his belt than
Nunes, the redshirt sophomore
"feels leaps and bounds more im
proved" from where he was last
year and has become "very com
fortable" with the playbook.
With the quarterback race going
right down to the wire, the intensity
of the atmosphere can hardly be
downplayed. Yet the competition
also hinges on a tremendous sense of
mutual respect between the two
players.
"It's been healthy competition,"
Nottingham said. "We all under
stand at this school we want to be
competitive, not combative. We
know not to take anything personal
ly. I don't want to be tense because if
you play the quarterback position,
you can't be tense. You try to control
the things you can control."
"Brett's a great competitor and

it's a really great opportunity,"
Nunes said. "It's made us better
competitors on the field and made us
that much more focused in the meet
ing room. It's like what [former Stan
ford head coach Jim] Harbaugh
would tell us: Iron sharpens iron.
That's the attitude that we've
taken."

Both players have also shown a
great level of humility throughout
preseason camp. Nottingham ac
knowledges that he hasn't "arrived"
as an "established player" yet, while
Nunes recognizes the importance of
improving on timing routes with his
wide receivers and tight ends. And
though they are the two favorites in
the pursuit for the starting role, red
shirt freshman Kevin Hogan has re
cently emerged as a dark-horse can
didate.

"Hogan is trying to make it a
three-man race," Shaw said. "I
wouldn't say he's quite there yet, but
he's not too far behind. He's making
it more cloudy, which is good."
When asked who he thought had
a better command of the offense,
Shaw said, "I would've said Josh
early, but 1 think in the last couple
days, all three guys have shown great
command of what we need to do."
Shaw made it clear that the Car
dinal will not adopt a rotation system
for the position, which would involve
the quarterbacks splitting playing
time, at least early in the season.
Picking one quarterback remains a
difficult task, but time is running out.
"The decision is going to be
tough," he said. "But we'll weigh all
the information and look at the film
and the notes. And when it's time,
we'll make a decision and move on."
Regardless of which player will

be chosen to start, he won't be ex
pected to control plays at the line of
scrimmage to the same extent that
Luck did as master of the offense.

"That last 25 percent where An
drew could do whatever he wanted
at the line of scrimmage, [the new
starter] won't have that," Shaw said.
"We're going to set parameters and
progressions for him to follow."

But even with those limitations in
place, the coaching staff is still hold
ing the competing quarterbacks to a
high standard during the preseason
and beyond.
"It's about executing the of
fense," Shaw said. "We can't shrink
the offense. We're not going to put
on our starter whoever it is
what we put on Andrew. But at the
same time, that guy has to be able to
run the offense. He has to get us to
the right protection, to the right run
ning play, and when a [receiver] is
open in a passing play he has to hit
hrm. The combination has to be con
sistent."

The starting quarterback this
season might not be the next num
ber 12, but he will be the player cho
sen through the methodical selec
tion process that Shaw and the
coaching staff have implemented.
Whether it's Nottingham, Nunes or
Hogan who's named as the succes
sor, the reins of the Cardinal offense
will assuredly be passed to a quar
terback who has already been heav
ily tested by the intense competition
for the job.
That gives Stanford football as
good a chance as any to win come
game day.

uary, two different blows were dealt to the
Stanford faithful. Losing the Fiesta Bowl to
Oklahoma State was the immediate sting,
but losing once-in-a-generation quarterback
Andrew Luck to the NFL was, in the big pic
ture, the deeper wound. The inevitable ques
tion that no one was concerned with sudden

ly surfaced as one of the most pressing dilem
mas for the future of Stanford football: Who's
going to replace number 12 at starting quar
terback?

Fast-forward to August, and that all-im
portant question remains unanswered with
the season opener against San Jose State just
over two weeks away. But decision time is
looming. After Saturday's open practice that
consisted of a short scrimmage, head coach
David Shaw stated that the starting quarter
back would hopefully be chosen sometime

this week.

"I didn't want to make a quick decision,"
Shaw said. "I wanted to go as long as possible,
as long as prudent, because that way we get to
see as much data as possible. I wanted to
make sure the quarterbacks worked hard all
summer knowing that they were coming in
with competition and give them at least two
weeks to get after it and show us everything
they have."

Redshirf junior Josh Nunes (left) and redshirt sophomore Brett Nottingham (right) are the frontrunners in the closely contested
competition for the starting quarterback role. Coach David Shaw stated that a decision would hopefully be made some time this week.
Redshirt sophomore Brett Not
tingham and redshirt junior Josh
Nunes are the two front-runners in
the tightly contested race.
Nottingham played in six games
last season, mostly performing mop
up duty behind Luck. In those ap
pearances, he completed five of eight
pass attempts for 78 yards and a
touchdown. While playing under
center for Monte Vista High School
in Danville, Calif., he was a four-star
prospect and one of the top high
school, pro-style quarterbacks in the
country ranked as high as fourth
by Rivals.com.

Nunes saw action in four games
during the 2010 season as the prima
ry backup quarterback on the depth
chart, completing one of two passes
for seven yards against Wake Forest.
The 6-foot-4 Upland, Calif., native,
who be will be entering his fourth
collegiate season, was also a four-star
recruit and ranked the 13th-best pro
style quarterback in high school by
Rivals.com.

As former backups, both players
voiced great appreciation for the
valuable learning experience of play
ing behind Luck.
"That's the beauty of what we
have," Nunes said. "I was behind
Andrew for three years, which is one
of the biggest blessings you can have.
Seeing how he handled it from a
mental standpoint as well as a physi
cal standpoint was huge. You can
look at these drills [in practice] and
see what kind of attitude he had

coming in, and you try to replicate
that."

"I tell myself if I don't think about
what Andrew did these past two
years, I would've taken them for
granted," Nottingham noted. "I
learned so much from sitting behind
him and I try to play through him vic
ariously. I saw all the amazing things
he did. So when I'm preparing now, I
try to think about what he would've
done."

Given that the Stanford offense
contains nearly 300 plays, master
ing the voluminous playbook is a
quarterback skill that is as impor
tant as it is challenging. But both
quarterbacks expressed confidence
in their understanding of the plays.
Nunes believes that knowing the
playbook is one of his "strong
points" as he has it "pretty down
pat." Although Nottingham has
one less season under his belt than
Nunes, the redshirt sophomore
"feels leaps and bounds more im
proved" from where he was last
year and has become "very com
fortable" with the playbook.
With the quarterback race going
right down to the wire, the intensity
of the atmosphere can hardly be
downplayed. Yet the competition
also hinges on a tremendous sense of
mutual respect between the two
players.
"It's been healthy competition,"
Nottingham said. "We all under
stand at this school we want to be
competitive, not combative. We
know not to take anything personal
ly. I don't want to be tense because if
you play the quarterback position,
you can't be tense. You try to control
the things you can control."
"Brett's a great competitor and

it's a really great opportunity,"
Nunes said. "It's made us better
competitors on the field and made us
that much more focused in the meet
ing room. It's like what [former Stan
ford head coach Jim] Harbaugh
would tell us: Iron sharpens iron.
That's the attitude that we've
taken."

Both players have also shown a
great level of humility throughout
preseason camp. Nottingham ac
knowledges that he hasn't "arrived"
as an "established player" yet, while
Nunes recognizes the importance of
improving on timing routes with his
wide receivers and tight ends. And
though they are the two favorites in
the pursuit for the starting role, red
shirt freshman Kevin Hogan has re
cently emerged as a dark-horse can
didate.

"Hogan is trying to make it a
three-man race," Shaw said. "I
wouldn't say he's quite there yet, but
he's not too far behind. He's making
it more cloudy, which is good."
When asked who he thought had
a better command of the offense,
Shaw said, "I would've said Josh
early, but 1 think in the last couple
days, all three guys have shown great
command of what we need to do."
Shaw made it clear that the Car
dinal will not adopt a rotation system
for the position, which would involve
the quarterbacks splitting playing
time, at least early in the season.
Picking one quarterback remains a
difficult task, but time is running out.
"The decision is going to be
tough," he said. "But we'll weigh all
the information and look at the film
and the notes. And when it's time,
we'll make a decision and move on."
Regardless of which player will

be chosen to start, he won't be ex
pected to control plays at the line of
scrimmage to the same extent that
Luck did as master of the offense.

"That last 25 percent where An
drew could do whatever he wanted
at the line of scrimmage, [the new
starter] won't have that," Shaw said.
"We're going to set parameters and
progressions for him to follow."

But even with those limitations in
place, the coaching staff is still hold
ing the competing quarterbacks to a
high standard during the preseason
and beyond.
"It's about executing the of
fense," Shaw said. "We can't shrink
the offense. We're not going to put
on our starter whoever it is
what we put on Andrew. But at the
same time, that guy has to be able to
run the offense. He has to get us to
the right protection, to the right run
ning play, and when a [receiver] is
open in a passing play he has to hit
hrm. The combination has to be con
sistent."

The starting quarterback this
season might not be the next num
ber 12, but he will be the player cho
sen through the methodical selec
tion process that Shaw and the
coaching staff have implemented.
Whether it's Nottingham, Nunes or
Hogan who's named as the succes
sor, the reins of the Cardinal offense
will assuredly be passed to a quar
terback who has already been heav
ily tested by the intense competition
for the job.
That gives Stanford football as
good a chance as any to win come
game day.
