Over the 19 days of competition at the
2012 Olympic Games in London, current
Stanford athletes and alumni took 16
medals equivalent to 17th in the world
amongst participating country. The Cardi-

nal won 12 gold, two
silver and two
bronze medals at
the London Games,
with gold medals
earned in the sports
of beach volleyball,
women's rowing
women's soccer,
men's tennis and
women's water polo.

Stanford finished third in the collegiate
Olympic medal count behind USC and Cal,
and tied USC for earning the most gold
medals. Here are some Cardinal highlights
of the last week of Olympic competition:

Women's soccer:

Rachel Buehler 'O7, Kelley O'Hara 'lO
and Nicole Barnhart 'O4 helped Team USA
win its third consecutive gold in the
Olympics on Aug. 9. With Buehler at cen
tral defense, O'Hara at left back and Barn
hart as the backup goalkeeper, the Ameri
cans redeemed themselves in the final at
Wembley Stadium with a 2-1 victory over
Japan, which beat Team USA in the 2011
World Cup final. The United States gained
a 2-0 lead in the 54th minute but needed
goalkeeper Hope Solo's diving save in the
final minutes to stave off Japan's come
back.

Track and field:

Idara Otu 'O9 ran the second leg of the
4x400-meter relay qualifier on Aug. 10 to
help Nigeria take fourth in the first heat
and eighth overall to make the final with a
time of 3:26.29. She did not compete in the
Aug. 11 final, during which Nigeria crossed
the finish line seventh but was disqualified.
Ryan Hall 'O5 ran in his second Olympic
marathon on Aug. 12 but pulled out at the
11-mile mark due to a right hamstring
strain. This marks the first time in his career
that he has not finished a race.

Women's volleyball:

The No. 1-ranked U.S. team, including
Foluke Akinradewo 'O9 and Logan Tom
'O3, advanced to the gold-medal match for
the second straight Olympics with a 25-20,
