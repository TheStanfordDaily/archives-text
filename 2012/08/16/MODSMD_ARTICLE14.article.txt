# LEGACY IN QUESTION

### Tom Taylor 
It's fair to say that beach vol
leyball was a hit at the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games. I
am biased, since I spent my
summer working as a volun
teer at Horse Guards Parade, this
Games' venue for beach volleyball.
But the sellout crowds truly created
a great atmosphere at most match
es, even those starting at 9 a.m. and
11 p.m. The sport's governing body,
the FIVB, has interpreted this as a
strong sign that the Olympic
Games will leave a big legacy in the
U.K., that the country is both build
ing up a fan base and encouraging
people to take up the sport.
But I'm not so sure.

The sand of the center court as
well as the practice and warm-up
courts is going to be used to build
recreational courts around the capi
tal. But that philanthropic act is a
consequence of a harsher reality:
Beach volleyball's presence in the
heart of London was only going to be
temporary. Within hours of the final
ball being hit over the net, the
process of disassembling the main
stands had started. Within days, the
Horse Guards Parade and nearby St.
James's Park will be back to normal,
save for a few patches of grass
scarred by tents and heavy machin
ery that will take a little longer to re
cover.

Now, I will hold up my hands
and readily admit that I didn't know
my side-outs from my bump passes
two weeks ago. I have been lucky,
though. Instead of standing outside
venues directing human traffic like
some Olympic volunteers, I was as
signed to press operations and
given the enviable task of being one
of the first people to interview the
athletes as they came off the court
after their matches. This also meant
that it was effectively in my job de
scription to sit in the stadium and
watch hour after hour of the sport
so that I could ask the right ques
tions when the time came.

Bit by bit, then, I picked up the
sport. I learned not just the key
rules, but also the tactics, the char
acters and backgrounds of the top
