# LEGACY IN QUESTION
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's fair to say that beach vol
leyball was a hit at the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games. I
am biased, since I spent my
summer working as a volun
teer at Horse Guards Parade, this
Games' venue for beach volleyball.
But the sellout crowds truly created
a great atmosphere at most match
es, even those starting at 9 a.m. and
11 p.m. The sport's governing body,
the FIVB, has interpreted this as a
strong sign that the Olympic
Games will leave a big legacy in the
U.K., that the country is both build
ing up a fan base and encouraging
people to take up the sport.
But I'm not so sure.

The sand of the center court as
well as the practice and warm-up
courts is going to be used to build
recreational courts around the capi
tal. But that philanthropic act is a
consequence of a harsher reality:
Beach volleyball's presence in the
heart of London was only going to be
temporary. Within hours of the final
ball being hit over the net, the
process of disassembling the main
stands had started. Within days, the
Horse Guards Parade and nearby St.
James's Park will be back to normal,
save for a few patches of grass
scarred by tents and heavy machin
ery that will take a little longer to re
cover.

Now, I will hold up my hands
and readily admit that I didn't know
my side-outs from my bump passes
two weeks ago. I have been lucky,
though. Instead of standing outside
venues directing human traffic like
some Olympic volunteers, I was as
signed to press operations and
given the enviable task of being one
of the first people to interview the
athletes as they came off the court
after their matches. This also meant
that it was effectively in my job de
scription to sit in the stadium and
watch hour after hour of the sport
so that I could ask the right ques
tions when the time came.

Bit by bit, then, I picked up the
sport. I learned not just the key
rules, but also the tactics, the char
acters and backgrounds of the top
players. Would I watch it again,
even pay to attend? Yes. Do I
want to hit the sand courts when I
get back to the Farm? Yes.
I do, however, lack one impor
tant ingredient that may be re
quired: a ball. After the event
treated the crowds to exciting
world-class action on the courts
and talked repeatedly about the
legacy that beach volleyball want
ed to leave in the U.K., the official
shop within the venue didn't actu
ally sell balls. In fact, I think only
one of the London 2012 shops did.
Not only was the shop miles away,
but since it was in the Olympic
Park it required a ticket just to
visit. (I could be wrong, though; it
might just be that no Olympic
shop sold balls.) None of the newly
inducted beach volleyball fans
were going to leave the event with
the sole piece of equipment that
would allow them to start playing
immediately.
I'm not so sure, though,
whether they would have started
playing even if they had been able
to buy a ball. I'm not so sure that
they really came to watch the ac
tion or even left understanding it.
The presence of skimpily
dressed players, especially the
women, is often seen as the main
reason that people show up to
watch this sport for the first time,
and it undoubtedly helped pack
the stadium in London. While that
might not be the best way to build

up a serious beach volleyball fol
lowing, it does serve the most basic
need to get people in the stands
and expose them to this sport.
From that point on, though, the
organizers missed a trick. Instead
of the odd piece of informative
commentary between points
even just stating the score might
have helped spectators were
treated to music and the occasion
al troupe of dancers. They were
encouraged, too, to join in with
Mexican waves or conga lines
while the match went on unob
served below. At first this was un
doubtedly fun, but as time went by
it began to grate more and more.
(If I have to watch one more per
son do the conga in the next few
weeks I might just lose the will to
live.) The antics left the impres
sion that it wasn't the action on
court that was capturing people's
hearts and minds.

Maybe I've got this wrong,
though. The very last match be
tween the gold-medal-winning
German team of Julius Brink and
Jonas Reckermann and the
Brazilian duo of Emanuel Rego
and Alison Cerutti was a perfect
example of everything that is right
with beach volleyball. For a gold
en hour all the other distractions
became irrelevant and you could
feel 15,000 sets of eyes focused on
the sand. And hopefully, the mem
ories of that match will last long
after the sand is gone.

tal. But that philanthropic act is a
consequence of a harsher reality:
Beach volleyball's presence in the
heart of London was only going to be
temporary. Within hours of the final
ball being hit over the net, the
process of disassembling the main
stands had started. Within days, the
Horse Guards Parade and nearby St.
James's Park will be back to normal,
save for a few patches of grass
scarred by tents and heavy machin
ery that will take a little longer to re
cover.

Now, I will hold up my hands
and readily admit that I didn't know
my side-outs from my bump passes
two weeks ago. I have been lucky,
though. Instead of standing outside
venues directing human traffic like
some Olympic volunteers, I was as
signed to press operations and
given the enviable task of being one
of the first people to interview the
athletes as they came off the court
after their matches. This also meant
that it was effectively in my job de
scription to sit in the stadium and
watch hour after hour of the sport
so that I could ask the right ques
tions when the time came.

Bit by bit, then, I picked up the
sport. I learned not just the key
rules, but also the tactics, the char
acters and backgrounds of the top
players. Would I watch it again,
even pay to attend? Yes. Do I
want to hit the sand courts when I
get back to the Farm? Yes.
I do, however, lack one impor
tant ingredient that may be re
quired: a ball. After the event
treated the crowds to exciting
world-class action on the courts
and talked repeatedly about the
legacy that beach volleyball want
ed to leave in the U.K., the official
shop within the venue didn't actu
ally sell balls. In fact, I think only
one of the London 2012 shops did.
Not only was the shop miles away,
but since it was in the Olympic
Park it required a ticket just to
visit. (I could be wrong, though; it
might just be that no Olympic
shop sold balls.) None of the newly
inducted beach volleyball fans
were going to leave the event with
the sole piece of equipment that
would allow them to start playing
immediately.
I'm not so sure, though,
whether they would have started
playing even if they had been able
to buy a ball. I'm not so sure that
they really came to watch the ac
tion or even left understanding it.
The presence of skimpily
dressed players, especially the
women, is often seen as the main
reason that people show up to
watch this sport for the first time,
and it undoubtedly helped pack
the stadium in London. While that
might not be the best way to build

up a serious beach volleyball fol
lowing, it does serve the most basic
need to get people in the stands
and expose them to this sport.
From that point on, though, the
organizers missed a trick. Instead
of the odd piece of informative
commentary between points
even just stating the score might
have helped spectators were
treated to music and the occasion
al troupe of dancers. They were
encouraged, too, to join in with
Mexican waves or conga lines
while the match went on unob
served below. At first this was un
doubtedly fun, but as time went by
it began to grate more and more.
(If I have to watch one more per
son do the conga in the next few
weeks I might just lose the will to
live.) The antics left the impres
sion that it wasn't the action on
court that was capturing people's
hearts and minds.

Maybe I've got this wrong,
though. The very last match be
tween the gold-medal-winning
German team of Julius Brink and
Jonas Reckermann and the
Brazilian duo of Emanuel Rego
and Alison Cerutti was a perfect
example of everything that is right
with beach volleyball. For a gold
en hour all the other distractions
became irrelevant and you could
feel 15,000 sets of eyes focused on
the sand. And hopefully, the mem
ories of that match will last long
after the sand is gone.

It's fair to say that beach vol
leyball was a hit at the Lon
don 2012 Olympic Games. I
am biased, since I spent my
summer working as a volun
teer at Horse Guards Parade, this
Games' venue for beach volleyball.
But the sellout crowds truly created
a great atmosphere at most match
es, even those starting at 9 a.m. and
11 p.m. The sport's governing body,
the FIVB, has interpreted this as a
strong sign that the Olympic
Games will leave a big legacy in the
U.K., that the country is both build
ing up a fan base and encouraging
people to take up the sport.
But I'm not so sure.

The sand of the center court as
well as the practice and warm-up
courts is going to be used to build
recreational courts around the capi
tal. But that philanthropic act is a
