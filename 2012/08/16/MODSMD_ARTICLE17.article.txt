# FACE THE DREAM

It was one of those impossible
media questions. "Could
Team USA beat the Dream
Team?" Although reporters
fielded responses from sever
al Team USAers and subtly framed
these elite players as cocky
wannabes in their rather sensation
al headlines, I agree with the most
recent gold medalists.
Team USA could emerge victo
rious in a game against its Olympic
predecessor. This doesn't mean
they would win a seven-game series.
It doesn't even mean they would

would be the underdog in such a
matchup. The Dream Team fea

15 MVP awards, 23 NBA champi

dan has been awarded more MVP
awards than the entire current
Team USA roster collectively. The
front line of the original Dream
Team (the Admiral, the Round
Mound and the Mailman) would, in
theory, obliterate the front line of
this recent Olympic squad (Tyson
Chandler, Kevin Love and Antho

Charles Barkley believes that Kobe,
Le√üron and Kevin Durant would
be the only players from the current
Olympic team to even make the
original one.
This may be true. But the same
thing could be said about the con
tenders for Olympic gold in Lon
don. From Spain's unimpressive
roster of NBA riffraff, only the
Gasol brothers (and maybe Serge
