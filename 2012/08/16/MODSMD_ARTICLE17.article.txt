# FACE THE DREAM
## 
### David Eng 
It was one of those impossible
media questions. "Could
Team USA beat the Dream
Team?" Although reporters
fielded responses from sever
al Team USAers and subtly framed
these elite players as cocky
wannabes in their rather sensation
al headlines, I agree with the most
recent gold medalists.
Team USA could emerge victo
rious in a game against its Olympic
predecessor. This doesn't mean
they would win a seven-game series.
It doesn't even mean they would
win a winner-take-all contest.

Kobe said it best: "Well, we
could. We could. It would be a
tough matchup to say the least."
To prevent my mailing address
from being distributed among the
basketball community for the ap
parent heresy I have just committed
(although somehow receiving hate
mail seems strangely alluring),
allow me to explain myself.

There's no doubt Team USA
would be the underdog in such a
matchup. The Dream Team fea
tured 11 eventual Hall of Fame in
ductees who cumulatively accrued
15 MVP awards, 23 NBA champi
onships and 116 all-star appear
ances. To put these impressive acco
lades into perspective, Michael Jor
dan has been awarded more MVP
awards than the entire current
Team USA roster collectively. The
front line of the original Dream
Team (the Admiral, the Round
Mound and the Mailman) would, in
theory, obliterate the front line of
this recent Olympic squad (Tyson
Chandler, Kevin Love and Antho
ny Davis). In fact, Dream Teamer
Charles Barkley believes that Kobe,
Leßron and Kevin Durant would
be the only players from the current
Olympic team to even make the
original one.
This may be true. But the same
thing could be said about the con
tenders for Olympic gold in Lon
don. From Spain's unimpressive
roster of NBA riffraff, only the
Gasol brothers (and maybe Serge
Ibaka) would have avoided Coach
K's Las Vegas cuts yet Spain
only lost by seven points in the title
game.

Olympic competition rein
forces the importance of team bas
ketball, seemingly more so than
professional basketball, and al
most downplays individual contri
bution. Perhaps this is a factor of
fewer isolation plays and more mo
tion offenses. Even though the
Dream Team may be more deco
rated, this doesn't necessarily
make them the hands-down win
ner. Need we revisit the 2004 Lak
ers — a star-studded assembly of
individual veteran talent (Bryant,
Karl Malone, Gary Payton and
Shaq) who lost to a superstar

deficient Pistons team 4-1 in the
NBA Finals? In sports, hoarding
talent doesn't necessarily translate
to victories.

Since we're talking in the hypo
thetical anyway, it's worth noting a
few of the "what-ifs." What if
Team USA experienced an offen
sive surge like it did against Nige
ria, shooting 63 percent from be
yond the arc and assisting on 41 of
59 made field goals? What if Scot
tie Pippen got into foul trouble

then who'd be left to guard Leßron
or Kevin Durant? (Remember
by 1992, Magic was presumably
weakened by his HIV condition,
and Larry Bird was a 35-year-old
with back pain.) In these circum
stances, Team USA's talent deficit
could surely be overcome.
Put another way, if a team start
ing Kwame Brown at center could
top the eventual NBA champion
(see Golden State Warriors versus
Miami Heat, Jan. 10, 2012), Team

USA could certainly defeat the
Dream Team. On paper, the origi
nal Dream Team is better. In reali
ty, the original Dream Team is bet
ter. It's hard to refute either of those
claims.

Even so, can anyone say with
complete certainty that the 1992
Dream Team would win? No. This
is what my assertion rests on. This is
most likely what the assertions of
Kobe and Leßron rest on as well
(although they have both been
known to make media statements
without much deliberation in the
past).
This is the uncertainty that forms
the foundation of professional
sports. On any given day, an under
dog could win.
