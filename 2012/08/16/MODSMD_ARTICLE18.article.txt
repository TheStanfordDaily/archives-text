Since the beginning of sum
mer, I have intended to write
an article on what I call the
Stanford Perception Syndrome: an
effect I've observed that occurs when
people treat Stanford students/alum
ni according to a preconceived
notion of them. Sometimes
thankfully, usually—this has posi
tive consequences, like assuming a
level of capability or know-how. But
sometimes it feels challenging,
almost hostile, and sometimes
not to go all Gretchen Wieners-levels
of "Sorry I'm popular" and fall into
a crowd of un-extended arms it

feels bitter.
This previous
ly planned
article would
have been

aptly timed
and relevant, given recent experi
ences as an intern, in the workforce
and the rest. But instead of writing
an article about other people and
how they treat me (us), I've decided
instead to write about me (us), and
how we got this way.
They might call the flip side of
the Stanford Perception Syndrome
the Stanford Duck Syndrome
when you're freaking out below the
surface but calm as Bugs Bunny up
top. That's one half of it. From any
NSO meeting you'll surely find pro
fessors, deans and parents assuring
the newly official Stanford students
that they've got something great,
that it wasn't an admissions mistake

and that they're one of the lucky
ones. Hurrah!
Funny, isn't it, how NSO is all
reassurance that each student
deserves to be there, but Admit
Weekend is all about being so proud
and so confident for getting in? So
what changed between the sales
pitch and handing over the keys?
Why the switch from "You're the
best, we're the best, Stanford's the
best!" to "Don't worry, Little Lotte,
and don't rustle those feathers"?
It makes sense, at least to me, a
delicate fuzzy scorned by parents
and belittled by engineers, that we
Stanford students ride a wave of
highs and lows, elated at our admis
sion then bashed to humility by the
accomplishments of our peers, and
made guilty by those who fall by the
