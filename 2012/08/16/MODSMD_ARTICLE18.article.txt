## LIFESTYLE ADMIT IT SASH ANGELES

Since the beginning of sum
mer, I have intended to write
an article on what I call the
Stanford Perception Syndrome: an
effect I've observed that occurs when
people treat Stanford students/alum
ni according to a preconceived
notion of them. Sometimes
thankfully, usually—this has posi
tive consequences, like assuming a
level of capability or know-how. But
sometimes it feels challenging,
almost hostile, and sometimes
not to go all Gretchen Wieners-levels
of "Sorry I'm popular" and fall into
a crowd of un-extended arms it

feels bitter.
This previous
ly planned
article would
have been

aptly timed
and relevant, given recent experi
ences as an intern, in the workforce
and the rest. But instead of writing
an article about other people and
how they treat me (us), I've decided
instead to write about me (us), and
how we got this way.
They might call the flip side of
the Stanford Perception Syndrome
the Stanford Duck Syndrome
when you're freaking out below the
surface but calm as Bugs Bunny up
top. That's one half of it. From any
NSO meeting you'll surely find pro
fessors, deans and parents assuring
the newly official Stanford students
that they've got something great,
that it wasn't an admissions mistake

and that they're one of the lucky
ones. Hurrah!
Funny, isn't it, how NSO is all
reassurance that each student
deserves to be there, but Admit
Weekend is all about being so proud
and so confident for getting in? So
what changed between the sales
pitch and handing over the keys?
Why the switch from "You're the
best, we're the best, Stanford's the
best!" to "Don't worry, Little Lotte,
and don't rustle those feathers"?
It makes sense, at least to me, a
delicate fuzzy scorned by parents
and belittled by engineers, that we
Stanford students ride a wave of
highs and lows, elated at our admis
sion then bashed to humility by the
accomplishments of our peers, and
made guilty by those who fall by the

wayside.
A few weeks ago I misguidedly read an
article on the Washington Post Social Reader
whose title, "Why getting into Harvard is no
longer an honor," seemed sure to stoke the
cross-coast rivalry that broils within me. Nope.
Instead, education columnist Jay Mathews
introduced and published an anonymous let
ter complaining about the college admissions
process. Aside from unjustified conclusions
about admissions criteria and assumptions
about accepted students, the article suffered
from a lack of meaningful argument or any
analysis that could hold across the higher edu
cation spectrum. As I finished this frustrating

missive, I scanned the comments hoping to
find a word from a fellow Stanford student (I
did; it was good). Not just any school or even
an Ivy League, but a Stanfordian it's as if
only we understand.
We as Stanford students have to con
stantly navigate this space between defending
ourselves against those who challenge what our
admission means and believing in ourselves
enough to survive the stresses of our institu
tion's/parents'/own expectations, all while
managing to maintain some modicum of
humility. Surely some people picture us stand
ing around in rugby shirts laughing at the 93
percent of rejected students while sloshing

whiskey around in a racket club. Our Stanford
admission is a tricky beast.
We aren't allowed to feel like we deserve
it. No more than anyone else, anyway. Maybe
we worked for it, earned it, achieved it, but we
don't deserve it. So what do we do with an
admission we have to rise up to but can't
champion?
I propose, without dipping too deep into
sentimentalism, that we shouldn't treat our
admission like a thing. Our admission isn't a
validation of our intelligence or initiation into
some boys' club of elites. It's not a talisman of
achievement; we do not hang it on a wall to tell
the world of our adequacy—maybe we dis-

play a diploma, but even such flimsy totems as
a diploma mean little when propped up
against the possibility our admission provides.
We should treat our admission as a
chance, a challenge to prove ourselves. Because
we as Stanford students are constantly tested,
constantly asked to prove why we deserve our
diploma, if not our admission, and we must
excel beyond getting in by making something
out of the education we got when we made it
through Montag Hall.
