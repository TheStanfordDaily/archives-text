## DEUS EX MACHINA 'Eureka' finale goes to extremes to wrap up loose ends

I hate resolution.
I've joked with my
friends that in my ideal
world, every series finale would
end with an abrupt, mid-scene cut
to black. A good TV show is a
window into a living, breathing,
persistent world one that con
tinues even after the credits roll.
When a finale has the gall to put a
bow on every situation, it just
reminds me that as soon as the
episode ends, the characters' lives

are over. Closure is good, but
complete resolution feels artificial.
Unfortunately, that's the trap
Syfy's "Eureka" falls into with its
series finale.
As the episode title, "Just
Another Day," suggests, the plot is
a bit by-the-numbers for "Eureka":
the Department of Defense has
decided to shut the town down (as
the main character Jack points out,
it's surprising they've waited this
long, what with the weekly world

ending catastrophes), but right as
everyone's either packing up or
protesting, wormholes start
appearing, threatening to tear the
town apart. The scientists throw
out a little technobabble, Jack does
something foolhardy and the day
is saved. It's exactly what you
expect from "Eureka," which is
comforting in a way, and it man

ages to hit some nice callbacks
throughout the episode.
But wait! Allison, Jack's wife,
is pregnant! And Holly, having
lost her memory just last episode,
remembers that she loves Fargo!
And at the eleventh hour, a char
acter we haven't seen in over a
year saves Eureka! And... and...
And it's all just a little too
perfect.
The last 10 minutes of the
episode are dedicated to reveals of
this sort. Jo's proposal to Zane was
the rare thing that really felt gen

uine; not only did it cap off that
relationship beautifully, but it
served as a strong character

moment, a counterpoint to Zane's
(rejected) proposal two years ago
and a mark of how Jo has grown
emotionally since the lead charac
ters accidentally changed the time
line and reset their relationship to
zero. But everything else felt con
trived, like an attempt to give
everyone a happy ending even if it
hadn't been earned yet.
This was especially true for
Holly and Fargo. I'm sure the

writers had a much bigger plan for
these two they only found out
about their cancellation after the
season had already been filmed
and were only given one extra
episode to wrap it all up but
the constant back-and-forth
seemed almost silly. I don't want
to be on the record as having
asked for yet another character
played by Felicia Day to die, but
when it happened, it was com
pletely unexpected and emotional
ly powerful. Bringing Holly back
cheapened that, even though I

eventually decided that the writers
used the circumstances of her exis-

tence in interesting ways. Wiping
her memory could have been the
start of something great some
thing that happened off-screen,
that implied a life beyond what we
saw on-screen but instead they
redacted it so quickly it was mean
ingless.

Eureka is a goofy show with
an emotional core that seems to
intimidate its writers. They delve
into feelings when it's appropriate,
but they only stay there as long as

they have to. Even if the writers
were rushed into this finale, they
didn't have to rush out of it,

quickly tying up every loose end
they found. It would have been
more apt to end with Jack and
Henry the two strong forces
that hold the town together sit
ting and talking about the town of
Eureka, an uncertain future ahead
of them. Cut to black.
