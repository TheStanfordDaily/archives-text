## STUDENT LIFE EPGY fosters broad student growth 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
As the sun sets over Wilbur Field,
there is an electricity in the air. Com
peting shouts of "TRIDELT,"
"TERRA," and "ZAP" ring out as
500 high school students compete in
the Olympics the House
Olympics, held at the end of every
session of EPGY, the Education
Program for Gifted Youth.

The EPGY Summer Institutes
are academically intensive residen
tial summer programs for high
school and middle school students.
Each student must go through a rig
orous application process; however,
students apply to study in a single
subject area and are chosen based on
their talent and motivation for their
selected course. According to EPGY
Summer Institutes Director Rick
Sommer, around 1,300 students will
be on campus during the course of

the summer, from 45 states and 40
countries.

Once on campus, students live in
student houses like Terra and Yost,
grouped together by course of study.
For example, math and physics stu
dents are often housed together.
Stanford undergraduates serve as
resident counselors the combined
responsibilities of resident assistants
and teaching assistants and play a
critical role in running the program.
According to Sarahi Padilla 'll,
who took her first job at EPGY four
years ago, she wasn't originally look
ing for too much from the job. "I did
n't want to sit at home over the sum
mer, and I needed a job," she said
about her first year. After having
worked at EPGY every summer
since, however, she has learned the
value of teaching and mentoring
these students.
For others, like Dustin Fink 'l4,

who participated in the now-defunct
EPGY Istanbul program in high
school, it was the fond memories
from their time as EPGY students
that drew them back.

"With the summer coming up this
past year, I knew I wanted to work
on campus, and once I remembered
EPGY ... I knew from experience
that it would be perfect for me," he
said.

Indeed, a common theme
emerged among EPGY counselors:
They all wanted to become better
teachers. According to Sommer, the
residential nature of the program is
meant to facilitate an environment of
shared learning between students
and staff with common talents and
interests in away that wouldn't hap
pen in the students' usual school and
home settings.
Although there is a purpose
fully low student-counselor ratio,
a majority of teaching is in a
group setting.
"I knew I would be working
with very bright students, and an
ticipated some of the problems I
would encounter overachiev
ers, students who doubt their
abilities, classroom competi
tion," Fink recalled. "I learned
less about how to tutor individu
ally and more about how to han
dle a class as a whole how to
manage a range of personalities,
learning curves and abilities."
The opportunity to mentor
students and help them focus on
their interests in a rigorous acad
emic environment is often cited
by counselors as one of the most
rewarding aspects of the pro
gram. There is a strong emphasis
on preparing students for the
shock that comes with moving
away from home and into an un
familiar setting; Padilla recounts
the first week as being "pure hell"
for many. But just like freshmen,
the EPGY students adapted once
the tumultuous first week passed.
The rewards of teaching can
also extend to counselors them
selves. For Sabi Vega 'l4, who
only recently started coursework
in computer science, the opportu
nity to teach has improved her
understanding and appreciation

of the principles of CS.
"Absolutely I'm a better pro
grammer," she said. "Teaching
has forced me to understand
what I'm talking about so I don't
confuse the kids."
Due to the challenges inher
ent in supervising and teaching
high school students, the coun
selors form very tight bonds with

each other. "We spend almost all
our time together," Vega said.
Sitting outside as the warring
chants across Wilbur Field begin to
die and students go to eat their final
meal at EPGY, Padilla explains the
impact of participating in EPGY
on her life as succinctly as possible.

"The passion that I realized I
have for watching kids grow in

tellectually and socially, observ
ing how they form bonds, how
they interact with the world
around them, is all thanks to my
involvement with EPGY," she
said. "The experience has shaped
me profoundly."
