## STUDENT LIFE EPGY fosters broad student growth 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
As the sun sets over Wilbur Field,
there is an electricity in the air. Com
peting shouts of "TRIDELT,"
"TERRA," and "ZAP" ring out as
500 high school students compete in
the Olympics the House
Olympics, held at the end of every
session of EPGY, the Education
Program for Gifted Youth.

The EPGY Summer Institutes
are academically intensive residen
tial summer programs for high
school and middle school students.
Each student must go through a rig
orous application process; however,
students apply to study in a single
subject area and are chosen based on
their talent and motivation for their
selected course. According to EPGY
Summer Institutes Director Rick
Sommer, around 1,300 students will
be on campus during the course of

the summer, from 45 states and 40
countries.

Once on campus, students live in
student houses like Terra and Yost,
grouped together by course of study.
For example, math and physics stu
dents are often housed together.
Stanford undergraduates serve as
resident counselors the combined
responsibilities of resident assistants
and teaching assistants and play a
critical role in running the program.
According to Sarahi Padilla 'll,
who took her first job at EPGY four
years ago, she wasn't originally look
ing for too much from the job. "I did
n't want to sit at home over the sum
mer, and I needed a job," she said
about her first year. After having
worked at EPGY every summer
since, however, she has learned the
value of teaching and mentoring
these students.
For others, like Dustin Fink 'l4,

who participated in the now-defunct
EPGY Istanbul program in high
school, it was the fond memories
from their time as EPGY students
that drew them back.

"With the summer coming up this
past year, I knew I wanted to work
on campus, and once I remembered
EPGY ... I knew from experience
that it would be perfect for me," he
said.

Indeed, a common theme
emerged among EPGY counselors:
They all wanted to become better
teachers. According to Sommer, the
residential nature of the program is
meant to facilitate an environment of
shared learning between students
and staff with common talents and
interests in away that wouldn't hap
pen in the students' usual school and
home settings.
