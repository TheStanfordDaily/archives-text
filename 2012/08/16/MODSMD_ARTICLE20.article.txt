## The 						Odd Life of Timothy Green' Disney film avoids realistic situations

Peter Hedges' new film, "The
Odd Life of Timothy
Green," features characters
similar to those of his last film,
"Dan in Real Life": clueless but
well-meaning parents and children
that are wise beyond their years.
Whereas as "Dan in Real Life" was
a breath of fresh air, including an
all-star cast and modern themes,
the characters in "Timothy Green"
are plain and hackneyed and play
out a story so simple-minded and
quaint that it could have been
written 30 years ago.
When the film opens, we
meet the lackluster Jim (Joe
Edgerton) and Cindy Green
(Jennifer Garner), a perfectly nice
couple who are vying to adopt a
child after failing to conceive. In
their interview with the adoption
agency, they insist on telling the
unlikely story of Timothy Green
(C.J. Adams), the adorable and

resilient boy who crawled his way
out of their garden so they could
make all their parenting mistakes
on him.
When Timothy shows up at
the ripe age of 10 allowing them
to skip all those inconvenient parts
of parenting like screaming babies
and changing diapers we slowly
discover he has all the qualities the
Greens dreamed of. He is Picasso
with a pencil, but he is also, as
they had hoped, "honest to a
fault," and he leaves in the plenti
ful chin hair of his mother's boss
when drawing her portrait. He
helps his parents discover and live
out their professional dreams, and
he even teaches a local girl to be
proud of her one charming imper
fection: an ill-placed birthmark. In
short, Timothy is there to save his
parents, not to be an entity of his
own with agency: He gets no say
in the decision to be signed up for

soccer, since this is necessary for
his father to overcome his own
daddy issues.
The film is so intent on
remaining chipper that Timothy's
only real fault is a quirky one: He
has leaves growing out of his
calves, shedding them with every
good deed he does. Afraid that he
will be ridiculed for this, his par
ents try to hide and remove the
leaves with the best intentions,

of course before realizing they
have to love him just the way he is.
The leaves, of course, work as a
shallow metaphor for other blem
ishes children might have and be
made ashamed of by their parents.
If you replace the Greens' plea of
"don't let anybody see your leaves"
with "don't let anyone find out

you're gay," these are the kinds of
well-meaning parenting mistakes
that can turn into deeply embed

ded problems for children. But
unlike many of the very real issues
kids and parents these days have to
deal with sexual identity, physi
cal and mental disabilities, racism,
religious intolerance there are
no real challenges or complexities
to Timothy's slight imperfection.
It's not much of a plight.

Jennifer Garner, C.J. Adams and Joe Edgerton star in "The Odd Life of Timothy Green."
But this is a Disney movie, so
if you can suspend your disbelief
for this simplistic world, "Green"
does have some nice touches. The
Greens live in a pencil factory
town full of lush colors and in an
idyllic Southern home; it's the
perfect setting for a fanciful tale.

Garner and Edgerton exude
wholesomeness and good inten
tions, even if they lack star-power
charisma.
Hedges deals with the magic
in the film in a very real and
straightforward way: We meet
Timothy when Jim is getting a

midnight snack and sees shadows
moving in the kitchen. There's no
smoke and mirrors, and the reac
tions the Greens have are human
and realistic. When the doorbell
rings the next day the Greens
are to host a family barbecue
we watch Jim remove his socks

without discussion to hand to

Timothy to cover his leaves; there
is no discussion, but it's an
instinctive, beautiful image of par
enting. Above all, where "The
Odd Life of Timothy Green" real
ly succeeds is in creating charac
ters that are people imperfect,

kind-hearted, well-meaning and
realistic people. They just aren't
people dealing with 21st-century
problems.
