## 'BLITHE SPIRIT' DELIVERS LAUGHS, EXUDES LUXURY

Noel Coward's hilarious
play "Blithe Spirit" has
been revived with gusto
and skill at the California
Shakespeare Theater (Cal Shakes)
in the East Bay. The production
has an impressive combination of
clever dialogue and actors with
precise comic timing who accentu
ate the wit. Like Oscar Wilde's
plays, Coward's are full of banter
and silliness, and just as Rupert
Everett seems born to perform
Wilde, the Cal Shakes cast is per
fect for the play.
The play's premise is admit
tedly ridiculous: When doing
research for his book, Charles
Condomine (Anthony Fusco) finds
himself, with the help of dinner
guest Madame Arcati (Domenique
Lozano), raising the spirit of his
dead wife Elvira (fessica Kitchens),
who makes it her mission to wreak
havoc with his new wife, Ruth
(Rene Augesen). Yet the characters
are grounded. Arcati is more con
cerned about her digestion than the
trouble she's caused through
magic. There's genuine affection
and bickering between Charles
and his two wives. And for the

most part, the play answers just
enough questions and creates mini
mal spectacle from the mystical,
allowing you to suspend your disbe

lief for the plot device driving the
action.
Coward wrote "Blithe Spirit" in
1941 to lift British spirits during the
war, with an initial production hill
of American Conservatory Theater
(A.C.T.) veterans. It was written in
the same era as other great screwball
comedy classics like "The
Philadelphia Story," and they all
share the same fast-paced dialogue
and surprisingly modern female
characters who are every bit as witty

and gutsy as the men. Although the
costumes, set and the ever-present
Irving Berlin song "Always" evoke
the past, the play feels neither dated
nor like a period piece.
A.C.T.'s Rene Augesen, a Bay
Area treasure, is a vision as Ruth
sharp, cool and tightly wound
and as usual, she frequently steals
the stage. Kitchens as Elvira, Ruth's
foil and predecessor, is a volup
tuous blond bombshell, full of
audacity and so crafty as to keep up
the appearance of innocence while
causing a lot of trouble. Fusco, as
their husband, is the resident
straight man who clearly loves and
loved each of his wives. He fre
quendy gets into scrapes when cas
tigating his former wife for the mis
chief she's causing; unable to see
Elvira, Ruth assumes Charles'
unprovoked scolding is directed at
her. Lozano plays Arcati as an
eccentric, plucky old lady who rides
her bicycle everywhere and is sur
prisingly real. The rest of the sup
porting cast is somewhat forget
table: the housemaid Alice is some
times a bit over-the-top, and the
Condomines' friends (Kevin

Rolston and Melissa Smith) are rel
atively plain, though a good con
trast with the vivacious

Condomines.
Director Mark Rucker, anoth
er A.C.T. veteran, chose to have the
play spoken in British accents,
which lends the perfect pitch and
meter to the dialogue. With any
other cast, this could have been a
risky move, as few actors can pull
off a believable accent, let alone do
so without interfering with the
quality of their voice work; here, it
works perfectly.
The rustic, outdoor Bruns
Amphitheater in Orinda is the per
fect setting: It's an intimate space,
and sitting outside on a beautiful
summer night you feel like you've
been transported to rural England,
where the play takes place. The
magic is all the more exciting in the
dark. It is outdoor theater at its
best: There is no sacrifice in stag-

ing, as the very location enhances
the elements of the play. It's also a
wonderfully upscale experience
indoor plumbing, comfortable
seats and fleece blankets are pro
vided that allows the audience
to experience the country in the
same luxury as the wealthy charac
ters would.
"Blithe Spirit" is a light, buoy
ant comedy with nothing profound
to say, but like "The Importance of
Being Earnest" or "Much Ado
About Nothing," it is a very clever
show. The Cal Shakes production
is true to the script a nonstop
laugh riot making this two
hour-and-40-minute production fly
by like a summer breeze.
