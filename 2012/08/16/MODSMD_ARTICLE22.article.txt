## The
						best MIXTAPES of the summer 
### – natasha AVERY contact natasha: navery@stanford. edu 
The music world has been generous
this summer as more and more
artists have turned to free releases.
Mixtape culture, previously a rap phenome
non, has expanded to include a variety of
genres that can use online releases to estab
lish new artists or please old fans. Here are
some of the summer's most interesting hap
penings in rap, hip-hop, dance and dubstep.
Azealia Banks "Fantasea"
After months of anticipation, hip-hop's
hipster darling Azealia Banks delivered a 19-
track mixtape that was well worth the wait.
Azealia Banks has tried a variety of musical
directions since she released "212" last year,
but "Fantasea's" greatest successes fall into
the same category of audacious rap-dance.
The best part of the record is its instant and
indisputable "quoteability"; "Fantasea" is full
of Azealia's brilliant and not-safe-for-print
one-liners.

Essential tracks: "F*ck up the Fun" (pro
duced by Diplo), "LBR"
The Magician "Magic Tape Twenty-
Four"
Riding the wave of disco revival, Belgian
producer and D.J. The Magician mixes the
smoothest ideas in house and disco on
"Magic Tape Twenty-Four." What makes
"Magic Tape Twenty-Four" so enjoyable is
the predictability of the Magician's game
bait the listener with a catchy synth line or
vocal lick, build to a pleasant but not ecstatic
high, let the track settle and switch it out for
the next. Repeat nine or 10 times works
like a charm.
Essential tracks: None (the mixtape is 45
minutes of continued play).
Cocaine 80s "Erxpress_og"
Cocaine 80s' collective of musicians dis
play a unique blend of talents on
"Erxpress_og," creating a summery sonic
smoothie. The EP moves from straight hip
hop to RBcß to guitar-driven pop, excelling
at each attempted genre. "Erxpress_og" also
feels no need to rely on its star power (the
collective's Common only appears on one
track, and Nas is featured on the excellent
track "Chainglow"), instead coming togeth
er to produce a solid, cohesive record.
Essential tracks: "This Can't Be A Crime,"
"Chainglow"

Dom Kennedy "Yellow Album"
If you haven't tired of hearing about
fame and females, Dom Kennedy's "Yellow
Album" provides 13 new takes on the sub
ject. Bringing in a variety of producers,
"Yellow Album" owes a lot of its success to
the varied backing tracks. Between tracks
like the chill "1:25" and groovy "Lately,"
Dom Kennedy's release is a great cruising
record.
Essential tracks: "Lately," "Gold Alpinas (feat.
Rick Ross)"
Starkey "Nucleus"
Clocking in at 16 minutes, Starkey's
grimy four-track EP "Nucleus" is a versatile
exploration of new ideas in dubstep. Starkey
cuts right to the chase with the opening
track, "Fantasy," featuring hard-hitting per
cussion and hefty amounts of street bass.
This space-inspired EP may not be very bar
becue-friendly, but it's definitely worth lis
tening to in the darkness of your room late
at night.
Essential tracks: "Nucleus," "Fresh"
Childish Gambino "ROYALTY"
An Independence Day gift for his fans,
Childish Gambino's "R O Y A L T Y" is an
energetic star-studded release that further
confirms his knack for wordplay. His eccen
tric list of guest artists includes Ghostface
Killah, Tina Fey (yes, Tina Fey) and Beck.

Childish Gambino's willingness to relin
quish creative control is what ultimately ren
ders "R O Y A L T Y" a very successful col
laborative project.
Essential tracks: "We Ain't Them," "Won't
Stop (feat. Danielle Haim of HAIM)"
