## New global health course finishes first run 
### JACQUELINE GU DAILY INTERN 
From July 30 to Aug. 10, the in
augural Global Health Intensive
Summer Course for medical resi
dents and fellows at Stanford Hos
pital was held in the Li Ka Shing
Center for Learning and Knowl
edge. The course featured a class ti
tled "Global Health: Beyond Dis
eases and International Organiza
tions," which aimed to broaden its
students' horizons and address the
overarching themes of global
health.
"It's not a medical or disease
based course," said Saraswati
Kache, clinical associate professor
of pediatrics and co-director of the
course. "Focusing on health issues
alone isn't enough.... They have
to understand context and its im
pact on health care."

According to Kache, the
course's student body is made up of
residents and fellows from various
training backgrounds, including pe
diatrics, medicine, surgery and
anesthesia.

Kache's partner, co-director Cy
bele Renault, a clinical associate
professor in internal medicine, says
that many of the lectures were
taught by individuals with innova
tive ideas but perhaps no medical
experience.

"[Saraswati] and I would leave
lectures by people who have noth
ing at all to do with medicine and
feel so inspired," she said. "Part of
the fun of doing this was drawing on
all the resources in the University
and integrating that into the course
structure."

In addition to its diverse array
of lecturers, the course was unique
in that it provided an interactive

model for post-graduate medical
education.

"Everything is as interactive as it
can be," Renault said. "This is not a
passive learning environment;
every lecture has been case-based.
They try to get students to imagine
that they're in a certain scenario
and ask them, 'How would you treat
this?'"

Several students, including Dr.
Meghana Gadgil, a second-year
medical resident in internal medi
cine, cited the interactive panels of
physicians as their favorite aspect of
the course.
"I was thrilled to have some of
the panels," Gadgil said. "They
were a unique opportunity to see
people talk very candidly about
how they got into what they're
doing, because there's no clear path
