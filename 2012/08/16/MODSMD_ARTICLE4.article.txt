## Mary Elizabeth Magill takes helm of law school 
### SAMANTHA GILBERT DAILY INTERN 
Like any good lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Magill is ready to
face the facts.
Magill, an acclaimed professor and former vice dean of the
University of Virginia School of Law, is taking the reigns as
the new law school dean on the Farm.
Born the fourth of six children in small-town North Dako
ta, Magill led a childhood straight out of a wholesome chil
dren's book.
"I don't even remember how cold it was [in North Dakota],
so that must have been a very happy childhood," Magill said.

Fargo, where she cultivated an in
terest in history. After high
school, she attended Yale Uni
versity and graduated in 1988 as a
history major with a focus on
19th-century American history.
While in college, Magill was in
volved in local politics and stu
dent government.
After graduating, she worked
on Capitol Hill as senior legisla
tive assistant for U.S. Sen. Kent
Conrad, a Democrat from North
Dakota, until the summer of
1992. Under Conrad's tutelage,
Magill got a bird's-eye view of
politics, which allowed her to nur
ture a love of the law.

"I worked on a variety of do
mestic policy issues," she said. At
one point, "I did the senator's
work related to the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee."

Her combined love of history
and politics made her decide to
return to school, this time to get a
law degree so as to become a pro
fessor. Magill's father and half
siblings were all lawyers, and she
says that their love of their ca
reers encouraged her to follow
suit.

She graduated from the UVA
School of Law in 1995 and then
clerked for U.S. Court of Appeals
Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 111
and, later. Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After
working for Justice Ginsburg, she
joined the faculty at UVA Law in
1997.

While at UVA, Magill met and
married her husband, Leon Fran
cis Szeptycki, an environmental
lawyer. They have two children,
ages 14 and 11.
Now preparing for her role as
dean of Stanford Law School,
Magill is eager to take her experi
ence and passion for the law to
new heights.
"[Stanford Law School] is, and
has always been, a superb law
school with wonderful students
and a faculty that is widely ad
mired for its teaching scholar
ship," she said. "In the last five or
six years it's taken some innova
tive steps, so it's a particularly ex
citing place to be right now."
Along with managing the

school and overseeing adminis
trative and institutional policies,
she also hopes to teach constitu
tional and administrative law.

Though eager, she admits that
she's also a bit daunted to fill the
shoes of Larry Kramer, the
school's former dean, who made
a number of innovative reforms,
including enhancing the clinical
education program to promote
reflective law practices.
"He's led some significant
changes that benefited the insti
tution, and he is also loved by all
the people who work with him
and for him," Magill said. "It's
hard to be widely admired."
Although filling Kramer's
shoes is no easy task, Magill says
she will focus her efforts as dean
on assessing how the school
should tailor its education to the
changing legal market.
Despite this challenge, Mag
ill's former dean at the UVA
School of Law, Paul Mahoney, is
sure she will prove successful.
"[Magill] is incredibly smart
and has a rare talent for building
consensus among groups of
headstrong people," Mahoney
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"She is able to do this because
she is both an honest and
straightforward communicator
and a great listener."
With the facts in tow, Magill is
ready to make her case known by
forging her own path on the
Farm.

return to school, this time to get a
law degree so as to become a pro
fessor. Magill's father and half
siblings were all lawyers, and she
says that their love of their ca
reers encouraged her to follow
suit.

She graduated from the UVA
School of Law in 1995 and then
clerked for U.S. Court of Appeals
Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 111
and, later. Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After
working for Justice Ginsburg, she
joined the faculty at UVA Law in
1997.

While at UVA, Magill met and
married her husband, Leon Fran
cis Szeptycki, an environmental
lawyer. They have two children,
ages 14 and 11.
Now preparing for her role as
dean of Stanford Law School,
Magill is eager to take her experi
ence and passion for the law to
new heights.
"[Stanford Law School] is, and
has always been, a superb law
school with wonderful students
and a faculty that is widely ad
mired for its teaching scholar
ship," she said. "In the last five or
six years it's taken some innova
tive steps, so it's a particularly ex
citing place to be right now."
Along with managing the

school and overseeing adminis
trative and institutional policies,
she also hopes to teach constitu
tional and administrative law.

Though eager, she admits that
she's also a bit daunted to fill the
shoes of Larry Kramer, the
school's former dean, who made
a number of innovative reforms,
including enhancing the clinical
education program to promote
reflective law practices.
"He's led some significant
changes that benefited the insti
tution, and he is also loved by all
the people who work with him
and for him," Magill said. "It's
hard to be widely admired."
Although filling Kramer's
shoes is no easy task, Magill says
she will focus her efforts as dean
on assessing how the school
should tailor its education to the
changing legal market.
Despite this challenge, Mag
ill's former dean at the UVA
School of Law, Paul Mahoney, is
sure she will prove successful.
"[Magill] is incredibly smart
and has a rare talent for building
consensus among groups of
headstrong people," Mahoney
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"She is able to do this because
she is both an honest and
straightforward communicator
and a great listener."
With the facts in tow, Magill is
ready to make her case known by
forging her own path on the
Farm.
