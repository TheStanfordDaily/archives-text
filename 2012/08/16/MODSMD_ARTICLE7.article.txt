## Thinking Matters next up in 'cycle' 
### RACHEL BEYDA DAILY INTERN 
As of this fall, the yearlong Introduction to the Hu
manities sequence will no longer be a requirement for
freshmen. Instead, the Class of 2016 will choose from
over 35 different quarter-long Thinking Matters
courses.

A wide variety of classes will be offered, every
thing from The Science of "Myth√üusters," which in
vestigates the popular TV show, to How Do You
Build a Nation? Inclusion and Exclusion in the Mak
ing of Modern Iran, a look into the nation's rich cul
ture and history. According to Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education Harry Elam Jr., the classes
are not necessarily humanities courses, but they will
teach humanities through "aesthetic inquiry, moral
and ethical reasoning and creative expression" as a
part of new breadth requirements voted on by the Fac
ulty Senate.

"Thinking Matters courses ask students to ponder
questions and issues that are vital to human existence,
past and present," Elam wrote in an email to The Daily.
"They look at these questions from an intellectual per
spective that illustrates the ways in which 'thinking
matters."'

Every class, whether it's Rules of War or The
Water Course, will be based around asking questions
and finding different ways to answer them.
Ellen Woods, the director of Thinking Matters, ex
plains that the courses are meant to provide a transi
tion to college-level learning. Thinking Matters is in
tended to help students develop analytical and inquiry
skills while learning about a topic that interests them.

"Students are now asked to exercise more inde
pendently responsible choices in their education and
are expected to build a solid liberal education that
works for them," Woods said.

Aside from allowing students to explore their inter
ests, Thinking Matters is appealing to students because
of its quarter-long length. The requirements for some
majors are so large that it is difficult for students to have
time for general education courses. According to pro
fessor Jack Rakove, the faculty looked for a place to cut
general education requirements and decided on
IHUM because it wasn't popular among many stu
dents.

"Stanford is a great place to be humanist, but what
makes Stanford Stanford is really its excellence in sci
ences, engineering, social sciences, stuff like that,"
Rakove said.

With computer science as Stanford's new most pop
ular major, followed by biology and engineering, the
yearlong humanities requirement was a lightning rod
for campus criticism.

Elam, though, is quick to emphasize that the change
in requirements is not entirely due to the so-called di
vide between "techies" and "fuzzies" at Stanford.

"All students come to Stanford having taken cours
es across this supposed divide," Elam said. "We hope
they will continue to do this at Stanford. In fact, we
hope that techie students can discover their inner fuzzi
ness and vice versa."

Though Elam feels IHUM was a valuable course, he
explains that it was meant to fade out eventually. Its
predecessor, Cultures, Ideas and Values, was in place
for about a decade, as was the Western Culture re
quirement before that.

"IHUM's course of utility had simply come to an
end," Elam said. "Introductory courses tend to be cycli
cal at Stanford."

In fact, complaints about Stanford's humanities re
quirements have been around since the 1980s. Al9BB
New York Times article notes that "Hey hey, ho ho,
Western Culture's got to go!" was a popular slogan at
Stanford, where students were eager to see their fresh
man humanities requirement changed. Fast-forward
eight years and negative columns were being written
about the updated Cultures, Ideas, and Values require
ment. In 1997, the Faculty Senate enthusiastically de
cided to require IHUM instead.

Now, even IHUM has run its course, and, according
to Woods, Thinking Matters better achieves the Uni
versity's current goals.

"Each revision in the freshman required curricu
lum, which began almost 100 years ago at Stanford with
Education for Citizenship, represents the dynamic so
cial conditions of the time," she said. "The faculty's
commitment is to a particular educational philosophy
and approach to knowledge and the learning needs of
the freshmen at the beginning of their undergraduate
education."
