## OP-EDS Canada's immigration measure doesn't protect against human trafficking 
### 
On Wednesday, July 4, Cana
da's immigration minister,
Jason Kenney, announced
new immigration rules targeting
temporary foreign workers in sex
trade-related jobs. The measures
target strip clubs, escort services
and massage parlors, which will no
longer have access to temporary
foreign workers. This might be an
important and timely step toward
preventing human trafficking, and
through measures viewed favor
ably by most governments: legisla
tion and policy that tightens immi
gration.

But critics of the measure be
lieve it discriminates against sex
workers and pushes foreign
dancers and potential victims into
a more vulnerable situation.

Canada's Temporary Foreign
Worker Program (TFWP) was
created to fill immediate skills and
labor shortages when Canadians
and permanent residents are not
available. The TFWP supports
economic growth by recruiting for
eign workers into lawful occupa
tions and regulating employer and
worker compliance. The program
also monitors working conditions
and salaries. But according to the
findings of the joint program of
two Canadian agencies the
Criminal Intelligence Unit of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
and the Human Trafficking Na
tional Coordination Center or
ganized crime networks have been
exploiting these temporary visas to
facilitate the illegal entry of for
eign women to work in escort ser
vices, exotic dance clubs, massage
parlors and even residential broth
els that may operate as legitimate
businesses. As such, according to

the Canadian authorities, restrict
ing visas for work in these fields
will address the problem of sex
trafficking in Canada.

If these women face the risk of
sexual exploitation, and if denying
them visas will keep them away
from unscrupulous employers,
then the new regulations should be
cause to celebrate. Unfortunately,
there is reason to doubt their effi
cacy. The main issue that needs to
be confronted is not immigration
status but rather the problem of
differentiating between workers
who are exploited and those who
are not. While the identification of
human-trafficking victims among
sex workers may be difficult for
law enforcement authorities, iden
tifying control tactics employed by
traffickers to retain victims in ex
ploitative situations is not. Such
tactics include isolation from
workers' social networks, forcible
confinement, withholding of iden
tification documents, imposition
of strict rules, limitation of move
ment, threats, force, coercion, de
ceit and violence. All these prac
tices committed against any indi
vidual are unacceptable.
While they may strike many as
useful (while scoring points with
those opposed to liberal immigra
tion policies), the new measures
also fail to address the root causes
of human trafficking and dodge a
painful reality that most Canadi
ans, and elected authorities as well,
would like to avoid: the fact that
Canada, like many other countries,
is rife with structures and practices
that facilitate and tolerate gender
based discrimination and violence.
