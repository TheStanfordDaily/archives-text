# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## What to do about Chick-fil-A? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
In an odd sort of way, I'm glad
Dan Cathy said what he said.
Because the messy public de
bate that has swirled around the
Chick-fil-A corporate empire
over the past month is one we
should be having, and one that
adds an important new set of voic
es to the defining civil rights issue
of our time.

But the public needs to be a
great deal more precise about
what exactly we're arguing about.
This isn't really one big argument;
it's actually a series of smaller,
more specific debates, and it's
vital that the American public
clearly define each one before
coming to a reasoned, informed
conclusion.

The first argument we could
have, I suppose, is whether Mr.
Cathy ought to be allowed, as the
chief operating officer of a family
owned business, to publicly state
his opposition to the legalization
of same-sex marriage. I hope
you'll agree with me that the First
Amendment case is pretty clear
cut and doesn't need addressing
here.

The second argument we
could have is one about whether
Cathy's comments make good
business sense. This is an empiri
cal argument that (a) needs to be
backed up by facts and figures,
and (b) isn't over yet, since the
total financial impact on Chick
fil-A has yet to be determined.
It's therefore not a particularly
useful argument to address seri
ously in this column.
The third argument we could
have is a debate about whether
local governments and munici
palities, distressed by Mr. Cathy's
comments, in fact have the power
to ban Chick-fil-A from opening
or maintaining franchises within
their jurisdiction. This is essen
tially a legal question, and the an
swer is an apparently clear "no."
UCLA law professor Eugene

Volokh has pointed out that
"denying a private business per
mits because of such speech by its
owner is a blatant First Amend
ment violation." Cornell law pro
fessor Michael C. Dorf has ob
served that "the First Amend
ment to the U.S. Constitution for
bids government officials from
discriminating against a person or
business based on the viewpoints
expressed by the person or by a
representative of the business."
And Adam Schwartz, senior at
torney for the American Civil
Liberties Union, has declared
that "the government can regu
late discrimination in employ
ment or against customers, but
what the government cannot do is
to punish someone for their
words." One doesn't need to be a
legal expert to see why: Today's
Boston Chick-fil-A could just as
easily become tomorrow's Birm
ingham Starbucks.
This leaves us with only one
fruitful debate to actually have:
whether you, as an individual, will
eat at Chick-fil-A. This is essen
tially a moral question that only
individuals are equipped to an
swer, based on the convictions
about marriage equality each per
son is entitled to have. Unlike
marriage equality itself, this isn't
a question of rights or legal and
political obligations, a problem
that the courts or the legislature
can solve for us. This is a question
we must all answer for ourselves.
I've never eaten at a Chick-fil-
A, and Mr. Cathy's comments
have now ensured that I never
will. I won't send my dollars to a
corporation only to see my money
turned around and donated to po
litical lobbies dedicated to pre
venting gays and lesbians from
entering into the same fulfilling,
long-term relationships, protect
ed and sanctioned by the state,
that everyone else is allowed to
enjoy. And I'm confident that in

the long term, the tide of history
will sweep away opinions like Mr.
Cathy's, and that the Americans
of 50 years from now will look
back on us and wonder what the
hell took us so long.
But until that time, let's enjoy
one thing about this debate: the
chance to glimpse the soul of
America through the free and
voluntary choices of its people. If
you don't like what Mr. Cathy
said, make Chick-fil-A hurt. And
if you do, go get a chicken sand
wich there every day this week.
There's not really anything
else we have to talk about.
