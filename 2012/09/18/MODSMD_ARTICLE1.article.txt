## FOUR MORE YEARS Defense carries Stanford past No. 2 USC in stunning 21-14 upset 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
It was an upset for the ages.
So much for Matt Barkley's Heisman
hopes. So much for USC's title aspira
tions. And so much for Stanford's sup
posed decline after the Andrew Luck era.

In front of a sellout crowd of
50,360 on Saturday night, No. 21 Stanford
(3-0,1-0 Pac-12) took down powerhouse
No. 2 USC (2-1,0-1 Pac-12), gutting it out
for a stunning 21-14 upset.
"We have a talented bunch," said sen
ior inside linebacker Shayne Skov.
"When you have a group of guys like that
â€”22 guys and they play lights out,
they trust one another and they play
together like that, it's something special.
We came out to play today, and we
showed that we could do this, and that
the showdown was going to be on the
field."

In what will go down as an unforget
table moment in school history, the victo
ry marks the fourth season in a row that
Stanford has managed to defeat the Men
of Troy. No. 2 USC is the highest-ranked
opponent that the Cardinal has beaten
since 2007, when Stanford, fittingly
enough, shocked the Trojans in the
"Biggest Upset Ever."
"This was a great team effort, and that
is what we talked about," said head coach
David Shaw. "First and foremost, Derek
Mason and our defensive staff were phe
nomenal."
The Cardinal got off to an auspicious
start when sophomore Ty Montgomery
returned the opening kickoff for 64 yards,
all the way out to the USC 33. But after
Jordan Williamson's 47-yard field goal
attempt bounced off the left upright, it
was the Trojans who struck first on
Barkley's 49-yard pass to wideout Ryan
Henderson, setting up Penn State trans
fer Silas Redd's 1-yard touchdown run.
Midway through the first quarter, sen
ior running back Stepfan Taylor respond
ed with an assertive answer, exploding
past helpless Trojan defenders for a 59-
yard score that tied the game 7-7.

"Our offensive line was great, our full
back was back with Ryan Hewitt and
then Stepfan Taylor," Shaw said. "We
were going to keep giving him the ball.
He never gets tired, he drags people, he
breaks tackles.... We typically like to
rest him, but when we need him I told
him this two years ago we are going to
put a saddle on him and ride him."
Barkley was effective enough in the
first quarter, airing it out for 105 yards,
although his 6-of-12 stat line indicated
right off the bat that he wasn't in his
usual flawless form. His passing yards
were also inflated by his dangerous wide
receivers especially Marqise Lee, who
finished with a game-high 100 receiving
yards and their abilities to gain yards
after the catch.
But it was Stanford quarterback Josh
Nunes who was frighteningly inaccurate
in the early going, completing 2-of-8 pass
es for just 19 yards in the first quarter.
"One thing that is great about having
a quarterback like [Nunes] is that he can
come to the sideline and tell you exactly
where everyone was," Shaw commented.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Outside linebacker Chase Thomas and defensive end Ben Gardner sack Trojan quarterback Matt Barkley in one of the four
takedowns of the night en route to Stanford's 21-14 victory over USC. Barkley was sacked only eight times in all of 2011.
"Even if he missed the throw, he
knew what to do and will make
the play the next time."
After the two teams traded a
few inconsequential possessions,
the Trojans tacked on seven more
points via a 15-play, 58-yard drive
that was sustained by a question
able defensive pass interference
call. Cardinal fans could only
watch in disbelief as wide receiv
er Robert Woods singlehandedly
converted a fourth-and-19, right
before Redd punched it in once
again on a 1-yard carry that gave
USC a 14-7 lead with 11:19
remaining in the second quarter.
A baffling series of intercep
tions three consecutive and
four over nine plays would
close out the first half. Barkley
was intercepted first by safety
Jordan Richards, and Nunes fol
lowed suit when linebacker Dion
Bailey came down with the ball
on the next snap. As if things
weren't strange enough already,
the Trojan quarterback threw
another pick as soon as USC got
the ball back. And by the time
Nunes threw his second intercep
tion a few plays later, halftime
had arrived and the Cardinal
headed into the locker room still
down 14-7.
Despite being down by just a
touchdown, Stanford committed
a slew of costly mistakes in the
first half, including three missed
field goals and a wasted first-and
goal opportunity at the USC 2-
yard line, that prevented it from
possibly taking the lead by half
time. Just as concerning were
Nunes' ongoing struggles, high
lighted by his dismal numbers: 6-
of-17 passing for 78 yards and
two interceptions. To be fair, the
Heisman favorite also threw two
picks, but with 11-of-20 passing
for 150 yards under his belt,
Barkley looked poised to show
his true colors in the second half.
Surely the Trojans were going
to open the floodgates when the
third quarter started. But they
never did. Surely the Cardinal
wouldn't be able to shut out the
Trojans for the entire second half.
But the unlikely soon happened.
"We heard the talk all week
about Barkley and Woods, and
rightfully so," said junior defen
sive end Ben Gardner, who post
ed a sack and two tackles for loss
in Stanford's victory. "They're a
talented bunch, but we were real
ly confident about playing them
all week. We felt good about what
we had and the way that guys
were practicing. We knew that if
we came out there with a lot of
energy and played our hardest at
every snap, good things would
happen."
Guided by defensive coordi

nator Derek Mason, the Cardinal
defense did the unthinkable by
actually encouraging Barkley to
throw the ball. Other teams
might have called it a suicide mis
sion, but for Stanford, it was the
perfect recipe to halt the Trojan
attack, as USC was held scoreless
for the final 41:19 of the game.
"We were playing a great team
and those guys made some plays,
but we tried to make them one
dimensional and throw the ball,"
Shaw explained. "That sounds
crazy to put it in the hands of that
quarterback and those receivers,
but we knew we could play smart,
sound football and keep those
receivers in front of us and rally
to the ball to make tackles."
Barkley, who was sacked four
times in the second half, repeat
edly failed in finding away to
unlock an impenetrable Cardinal
defense. Adding to his nightmare,
the Trojan offensive line's protec
tion, feeling the absence of veter
an center Khaled Holmes, broke
down against the relentless
Stanford defensive line. The com
bination of the front seven's
fierce pass rush and the sec
ondary's mistake-free coverage
prevented Barkley from firing
accurate throws to rarely-open
receivers. It became clear that the
best quarterback in college foot

ball simply had no answer for a
Stanford defense that inexplica
bly got stronger as the game pro
gressed.
"If you sit back there, the
quarterback is too good," Shaw
said. "Regardless of what hap
pened tonight, that is the best
quarterback in the country. If you
give him too much time, he will
kill you. You have to get after
him. We had to mix it up. Some
plays we came after him, and
some plays we sat back. Our sec
ondary made all the tackles."
Then the scoring started.
Except it was the Cardinal that
was putting up points on the
board, not the lethal Trojan
offense that everyone had
expected to open things up by
now. In the waning moments of
the third quarter, Nunes found
Taylor on a short pass that,
thanks to some meticulously exe
cuted blocking, resulted in a 23-
yard touchdown.
"I cannot say enough about
Josh Nunes," Shaw commented.
"Josh is never rattled. He is a
fighter. You don't see a lot of
emotions with him. He doesn't
have ups and downs. Josh is even
keeled and is the same when he
makes a play as when he doesn't
make a play."
The Stanford offense wasn't

finished yet, as it scored the go
ahead touchdown on the opening
drive of the fourth quarter.
Nunes connected with tight end
Zach Ertz for a 37-yard score,
capping a 10-play, 79-yard drive
that gave the Cardinal a 21-14
lead. In that series, when the
rookie quarterback couldn't
make a play with his arm, he hurt
the Trojans with his surprisingly
nifty feet a 12-yard scamper
on third-and-10 at midfield kept
the drive alive. Even Shaw was
impressed by the amount of
toughness and heart Nunes
showed in picking up the first
down.
"Shocking is what it was,"
Shaw said. "Shocking. I would say
that if he was right next to me
because he is not a runner. He
broke tackles tonight and it was
just the desire to make plays for
his teammates. He is a very self
less individual."
While Nunes completed the
game with 215 passing yards and
a pair of touchdowns, there's no
doubt that the game ball belongs
to Taylor, who took over the
game in the fourth quarter as he
chewed huge chunks of time off
the clock with his determined
runs. The senior captain was
responsible for two of Stanford's
three scores and finished with

153 rushing yards on 29 carries
along with 60 receiving yards on
four receptions.
"Coach [Shaw] basically told
us to trust this game," Taylor said.
"That's what we did: trust this
game. We were going to go down
the stretch, going to get tired. We
were just going to keep chugging
at it.
After Nunes barely overthrew
Ertz on a failed third-down con
version attempt, Barkley and Co.
got the ball back on their own 11-
yard line with 2:44 left in the
game, looking up at one last
chance to tie up the game.
But Barkley choked it away.
The Men of Troy drove down
to the Stanford 46, made possible
when the ruling on Barkley's
incomplete pass to Lee on
fourth-and-5 was overturned. A
Curtis McNeal carry didn't fool
anyone, causing the Trojans to
lose three yards on the play and
burn their last timeout.
And then for the first time this
season, it became clear that
Barkley, distraught and clueless,
could not ever win against the
Cardinal. For the first time this
season, it became clear that
USC's prophesied national
championship was far from cer
tain.
Second-and-13 at the Stanford
49. Incomplete pass and a 10-
yard offensive holding penalty.
Second-and-23 at the USC 41.
Barkley sacked by Trent Murphy.
Third-and-28 at the USC 36.
Trojans self-destruct with a false
start. Third-and-33 at the USC
31. Barkley punished by Chase
Thomas for a 6-yard sack.
With Heisman and national
title hopes fading away from his
sight, Barkley heaved one last
desperate throw to T.J.
McDonald on fourth-and-39,
only to have the pass broken up
by a swarm of Cardinal defend
ers. The upset was complete.
In his final year as the quarter
back for the Trojans, Barkley
once again came away empty
handed against the Cardinal.
Four exciting games only pro
duced four bitter losses. After
amassing 10 touchdowns through
the first two games this year, he
couldn't throw a single one
against Stanford.
"We have talked about not
being a flash in the pan," Shaw
said. "We don't want to be a team
that is known for one victory; we
want to be known for victory
after victory. We want to be con
sistent, stacking wins on top of
wins."
Stanford's message to the rest
of college football rang loud and
clear on Saturday night: the team
can win huge games without
Luck. Just ask USC.

Captain tailback Stepfan Taylor (left) celebrated his touchdown reception that tied the game at 14 with 10 seconds remaining in the third
quarter. Taylor burned many Trojans on the play, including cornerback Nickell Robey (right), known for his interception return in 2011's game.

Redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes was inaccurate in the early going but turned it around in part with his legs. The signal caller rushed three
times for 33 yards, "shocking" coach Shaw and the rest of the team. Not normally known for his quickness, Nunes picked up critical yards,
including a 12-yard scramble on third-and- 10 to keep the winning drive alive. He later hit Zach Ertz in stride for a 37-yard touchdown pass.
