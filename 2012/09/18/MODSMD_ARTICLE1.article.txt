## FOUR MORE YEARS Defense carries Stanford past No. 2 USC in stunning 21-14 upset 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
It was an upset for the ages.
So much for Matt Barkley's Heisman
hopes. So much for USC's title aspira
tions. And so much for Stanford's sup
posed decline after the Andrew Luck era.

In front of a sellout crowd of
50,360 on Saturday night, No. 21 Stanford
(3-0,1-0 Pac-12) took down powerhouse
No. 2 USC (2-1,0-1 Pac-12), gutting it out
for a stunning 21-14 upset.
"We have a talented bunch," said sen
ior inside linebacker Shayne Skov.
"When you have a group of guys like that
â€”22 guys and they play lights out,
they trust one another and they play
together like that, it's something special.
We came out to play today, and we
showed that we could do this, and that
the showdown was going to be on the
field."

In what will go down as an unforget
table moment in school history, the victo
ry marks the fourth season in a row that
Stanford has managed to defeat the Men
of Troy. No. 2 USC is the highest-ranked
opponent that the Cardinal has beaten
since 2007, when Stanford, fittingly
enough, shocked the Trojans in the
"Biggest Upset Ever."
"This was a great team effort, and that
is what we talked about," said head coach
David Shaw. "First and foremost, Derek
Mason and our defensive staff were phe
nomenal."
The Cardinal got off to an auspicious
start when sophomore Ty Montgomery
returned the opening kickoff for 64 yards,
all the way out to the USC 33. But after
Jordan Williamson's 47-yard field goal
attempt bounced off the left upright, it
was the Trojans who struck first on
Barkley's 49-yard pass to wideout Ryan
Henderson, setting up Penn State trans
fer Silas Redd's 1-yard touchdown run.
Midway through the first quarter, sen
ior running back Stepfan Taylor respond
ed with an assertive answer, exploding
past helpless Trojan defenders for a 59-
yard score that tied the game 7-7.

"Our offensive line was great, our full
back was back with Ryan Hewitt and
then Stepfan Taylor," Shaw said. "We
were going to keep giving him the ball.
He never gets tired, he drags people, he
breaks tackles.... We typically like to
rest him, but when we need him I told
him this two years ago we are going to
put a saddle on him and ride him."
Barkley was effective enough in the
first quarter, airing it out for 105 yards,
although his 6-of-12 stat line indicated
right off the bat that he wasn't in his
usual flawless form. His passing yards
were also inflated by his dangerous wide
receivers especially Marqise Lee, who
finished with a game-high 100 receiving
yards and their abilities to gain yards
after the catch.
But it was Stanford quarterback Josh
Nunes who was frighteningly inaccurate
in the early going, completing 2-of-8 pass
es for just 19 yards in the first quarter.
"One thing that is great about having
a quarterback like [Nunes] is that he can
come to the sideline and tell you exactly
where everyone was," Shaw commented.
