## Program offers glimpse of U.S. 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Not many people think it possible to get a crash
course on American culture in just a month, but
the American Language and Culture (ALC) sum
mer program comes close.
Since 1977, ALC has offered international
undergraduate and graduate students from Asian
universities the opportunity to live the American
college life by taking summer courses led by
Stanford student coordinators.
"It's one of the few opportunities in life where
there are so many different cultures all at once, and
to live together and learn together," said Ivy
Nguyen 'l5, a student coordinator for ALC.
Two 70-student sessions were offered during
the month of August, both of which were divided
into seven groups of 10 students with one student
coordinator, according to the program's outline.
During their stay, the students live just like any
Stanford student. They sleep in dorms, eat at
Arrillaga, have access to the gym, can use the
libraries or computer clusters and, as displayed on
the program's online calendar, also have very busy
agendas.
English classes take up the students' mornings,
where they can build communication skills, and the
rest of the time is spent on discussions and writing
assignments geared toward exploring contempo
rary cultural themes in the United States, including
diversity, race, gender, sexuality and religion.
Additionally, since the program aims to develop
appreciation of the cultural backgrounds among
all participants, small dorm events are also held.
For student coordinators like Vy Tran 'l5, the
experience of leading sessions and dorm activities
replicated the dorm staff routine combined
with that of an instructor.
"It's like being an RA and TA at the same
time," Tran said. "You're the person they go to if
they have any problems, and you create dorm spir
it. But you also have office hours and go over
homework with them."
The 14 student coordinators, selected from a
pool of applicants, were required to go through a
week of training very similar to RA training, Tran
said. Exercises included practicing scenarios, such
as what to do if a participant strays from the group,
and spending an entire day in San Francisco to get
to know the ins and outs of the city for field trips.
According to Nguyen, working as a student
coordinator also allowed for an introspective look
at what American culture means.
"You don't really think about [culture] and you
take it for granted," Nguyen said. "But when the
students come and ask you,' Why do you people do
this?' and they treat it so foreign-ly, you think
about why you do the things you do."
The program isn't all work, as participants get
to partake in field trips across the San Francisco
Bay Area: going to Silicon Valley to learn about
startups, volunteering in local community centers
and even riding roller-coasters in Great America.
Traditional Stanford pastimes are also
explored, including fountain-hopping, ice cream
socials and a cappella concerts.
While the program intends to offer a unique
personal experience for its international partici
pants, staffers reap rewards as well.
"I grew up in a neighborhood where there
weren't so many Asians around, so through this
program I got to reconnect with the Asian culture,
like part of my identity was discovered," Tran said.
Tlie participants, despite their diverse cultural
backgrounds, bond closely in the mere month on
the West Coast, and the student coordinators are in
integral part of it all.
Additionally, since ALC is a program under the
Volunteers in Asia exchange programs between
Asia and the United States, there can be an
"exchange" in the future where student staff are
given $l,OOO stipends to travel to Asia to reconnect
with their newly made friends.
"The connections you make with each student
create a network, and when they leave, they leave
with a tight-knit group of international friends
from all over the world," Tran said.
