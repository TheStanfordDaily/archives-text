## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Five, Six, Seven, Eight On the importance of sports to the Stanford experience 
### 
On Saturday night, as I'm
sure you know by now, the
No. 21 Cardinal tackled
No. 2 USC in an epic game at
Stanford Stadium.
The game and team's ability
to attract students and alumni to
return to campus is the stuff
administrators can only dream
of. In January, when the football
schedule came out, I wrote
about the challenges USC pre
sented both to the players and to
students trying to attend the
game, which was scheduled a
week before classes start and
before most students have hous
ing.
I've never been happier to be
wrong. Memories of sprinting out
onto the field and bear-hugging
some of my best friends, from stu
dents and players to recent alum
ni, will stay with me far longer
than manufactured dorm-bond
ing events.
And this isn't a dig at alumni
outreach efforts or community
building measures by the
University. Those are very neces
sary and, in my opinion, pretty
good here. It's just that nothing
artificially created to make you
connect with the community and
love Stanford can come even
close to cheering with every last
breath for your friends on the
field to win, then joining them
there in an incredible celebra
tion.
Whether it was the start of
another special football season or
just a great moment in time, on
Saturday night everything was
"All Right Now."
It's the song that played
when we got our acceptance
emails from Stanford. LSJUMB

plays it at Admit Weekend,
Commencement and just about every
chance in between.
It embodies the Stanford
carefree spirit that we all try to
emulate but often fail to. While
we wish everything were always
all right now, the fast-paced
quarter system and pressures we
put on ourselves create a lot of
stress in our lives. We often don't
take coach Shaw's pregame
words, "Live in the moment," to
heart.
But at the end of the game,
everything really was all right.
Like one extended, carefree
jump following "five, six, seven,
eight," we stormed the field glee
fully shouting and celebrating.
And we have the football
team to thank for that: the play
ers, the coaches, the athletic pro
gram, the administration as a
whole and the community (yes,
pat yourself on the back) for
understanding that sports are an
integral part of Stanford, and
without them our experience
would be for the worse.
Athletics, for all their glory
and excitement, are just another
expression of excellence at this
great school. But what an expres
sion they are. The grueling work
behind the scenes that went into
this victory is no different in spir
it from all of the dirty work we do
in the classroom. But the end
result is much more visible and
climactic. And when that hard
work pays off, we all reap the
benefits.
So, five hundred words in, let
me say the only two words of this
letter that really matter: thank
you.

All Right Now,

BILLY GALLAGHER
