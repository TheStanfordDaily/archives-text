## The 						Proposition Games: Will Prop 35 help curb human trafficking? 
### 
If you vote in California,
chances are that in November,
in addition to national, state
and local elective races, you will
encounter a host of propositions
on the ballot. Among these is
Proposition 35, or the
Californians Against Sexual
Exploitation Act (known as the
CASE Act). Proposition 35 hopes
to raise awareness of human traf
ficking and deter traffickers with
higher penalties and fines.
Human trafficking is a horrific
and growing problem nationally
and globally. It constitutes a vio
lation of the most basic human
rights to which between four and
27 million people (according to
the U.S. Department of State's
2007 Trafficking in Persons
Report), are subjected every
year. So an effort to increase
penalties for offenders should be
viewed as a universal good.
But there is not a consensus
on Proposition 35, even among
organizations and institutions
fighting human trafficking in
California. Critics of Proposition
35 argue that stiffer sentencing
will not address the core of this
complex problem. Civil libertari
ans raise concerns over provi
sions that require offenders to
register with law enforcement
officials long after they have
served their sentences. Of course,
penalties should reflect the sever
ity of any crime. And when penal
ties are patently incommensurate
with the severity of the offense,
they signal a lack of commitment
by the state and may fail to deter
potential violators. However,
focus on increased sentencing
can often mask the lack of mean
ingful effort to address a prob
lem. In the case of human traf
ficking, this may well be what is
happening with Proposition 35.
One of our main challenges is
the identification of instances of
human trafficking. For example,
not all prostitution involves
human trafficking, and not all
human trafficking involves pros
titution. Police and prosecutors
are not adequately trained to
identify cases of human traffick
ing, nor are they generally able to
investigate potential situations of
trafficking proactively. Poor iden
tification of trafficking and vic
tims leads to a weak or no case
against perpetrators.

Often, those brought to court
are not prosecuted under the
existing trafficking laws, but
under some other crime or some
minor offence. Many times, cases
of human trafficking are dis
missed because of lack of evi
dence (which is based almost
exclusively on the testimony of
the victims). In addition, some
judges and prosecutors seem to
fail to understand the phenome
non of human trafficking and the
psychological effects it causes on
victims. Prosecutors rely too
often on the testimony of victims,
which, given their extreme vul
nerability, is difficult, at best, to
obtain. Authorities also fail to
enable post-trafficking assis
tance, long-term protection and
support. Worse still, some author
ities direct prosecutorial efforts
at the victims-trafficked persons.
Efforts to reorient the work of
authorities are more likely to
produce the kind of changes
needed than stronger penalties.
By initiative of the Program
on Human Rights (PHR) and its
Student Advisory Board, on Oct.
17, the Stanford Police will offer
training for its law enforcement
agents on a victims-based
approach to human trafficking.
The training will include the
Human Trafficking Task Forces
from the San Francisco and San
Jose Police Departments. On Oct.
23, PHR is organizing a discus
sion panel on Proposition 35
bringing together prosecutors,
police officers, service providers
and activists to help move the
debate toward the needs of vic
tims. Disputes and debates about
tangential issues should not be a
distraction, nor should they
divert the efforts of those who
fight human trafficking. We risk
undermining the progress and
achievements of anti-trafficking
legislation and policy while traf
fickers continue to pursue their
criminal trade, very often with
impunity.
