# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## To the Class of 2016 
### Miles Unterreiner 
It has become traditional for
Daily columnists to offer each
year's incoming freshman
class a bit of advice accumulated
from the wisdom that flows from
time and experience. I'm not
going to do that.
I'm not going to do that
because time and experience
have taught me that failure
forges us into stronger thinkers,
citizens and friends. It is struggle,
not success, that reveals and
changes for the better who we
are. So I'm not going to help you
avoid it.
Because even if I wanted to, I
couldn't. The only people who
don't make mistakes at Stanford
are the people working in the
admissions office at 355 Galvez
Street. As much as you may get
wrong, always remember this:
they got you right.
They got you right. That will
be easy to remember this week,
and easy to forget by the end of
the year. Never lose sight of
where you came from and who
you are the person you'll be
during the sun and new friends
and pageantry of NSO, the per
son who worked hard for four
years to get here, the person who
shone and stood out and
impressed no matter what
happens in Chem 33 or Math 51
or the Humßio Core.
But don't be afraid to leave
that person behind either. Don't
be afraid to be uncomfortable.
Don't fear the transformation
that comes with defeat.
That's part of why we're here
at The Daily's new Opinions sec

tion. We are proud to represent,
to listen and, yes, to challenge
you especially as you learn
and change in the crucible that is
this place we call home together.
In this space over the coming
weeks, you'll see columns and
editorials on student mental
health, on campus culture and
politics, on the November elec
tion, on sexuality and art and the
environment. You'll see columns
you love, columns you profound
ly disagree with, columns you
can't stand and, if we do our job
well, columns that inspire or
change you.
But whatever you read in this
space, know this: we will not take
our job for granted.
Early last week, rioters
burned down the Libyan con
sulate in Benghazi, taking the
lives of four American diplomats,
including Ambassador Chris
Stevens. The ostensible cause: an
amateur film mocking the
Prophet Muhammad.
The tragic deaths underscore
the importance of both our rights
and responsibilities as journalists
rights and responsibilities we
take seriously. We at The
Stanford Daily are proud to
defend the right to free speech - a
right not granted or understood
in many parts of the world. We
are also committed to exercising
that right fairly, respectfully and
with the force of reason, logic
and intellectual rigor.
Along the way, we, like you,
will make mistakes. We, like you,
will seek to learn from them. And
we, like you, will grow and

change.
In short, we are your paper,
and this is your Opinions section.
Like you, we will always do our
very best. When we fall short, we
expect you to hold us account
able via op-eds, emails, or letters
to the editor. And we will remain
committed to our core principles
rational argument, respectful
debate and fair dialogue even
as we adapt to the changing real
ity of campus culture and the
world around us.
Welcome to campus. We look
forward to working with you.
