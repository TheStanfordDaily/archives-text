To the Stanford community,

As students return to cam
pus for fall quarter, we
realize that there may be
questions about what took place
during the summer months
regarding the Chi Theta Chi Row
House. We'd like to take this
opportunity to explain what hap
pened and what decisions were
reached.
First, a brief recap of the situa
tion. In February, the University
made a decision to terminate the
lease on the house (an option
available to either party on an
annual basis) based on serious
concerns about long-term man
agement, financial viability and
life safety issues in the house.
Among the concerns were dis
abled smoke alarms, code compli
ance issues in the kitchen, need
for substantial physical plant cap
ital improvements and a lack of
sustained alumni involvement in
management oversight of the
house.
Following an outpouring of
support for Chi Theta Chi and a
compelling argument from both
the Alumni Board and students
that independence is an essential
part of the Chi Theta Chi culture,
the University reconsidered its
decision to permanently termi
nate the lease. Between March
and August, we were working
toward giving the Chi Theta Chi
Alumni Association the inde
pendence it sought.
The University outlined a
clear plan whereby it would be
willing to turn management of
the house back to Chi Theta Chi,
as long as the Alumni Association
demonstrated through an interim
period a sustained commitment

to manage the house safely and
consistently. We can say with con
fidence that throughout our dis
cussions, we have been steadfast
in our efforts to reach an agree
ment with Chi Theta Chi accord
ing to the proposed terms.
Our good faith efforts contin
ued through the summer. A num
ber of staff invested their time
and effort in ongoing conversa
tions with the Alumni
Association, just as the members
of the Alumni Board worked dili
gently to find a solution.
On Aug. 20, the Alumni
Association notified the
University of its decision to no
longer seek independence and to
transition the house back to the
University. The Alumni Board
concluded that it did not have the

long-term involvement of its
membership, nor the financial
wherewithal to fund requisite
capital improvements (even with
the University willing to have the
expense paid back over time).
Additionally, the Alumni
Association questioned whether
it could fill the house with resi
dents without the benefit of the
University Draw. It was not possi
ble for Chi Theta Chi to remain in
the Draw without some
University oversight of the house.
Within days, Rodger Whitney,
executive director of Student
Housing, and Deborah Golder,
dean of Residential Education,
wrote to incoming Chi Theta Chi
residents, assuring them that the
house would remain a co-op and
reaffirming the University's com
mitment "to working closely with
(residents) to preserve as much of
the traditional Chi Theta Chi
experience as possible this year.
The Alumni Association is still
actively involved during this tran
sition period, and all of us share
the common goal of insuring that
Chi Theta Chi remains a safe
haven for its residents and a
dynamic living environment
retaining many of the unique pro
gram elements that are important
to students in the house. We
thank everyone involved for their
earnest efforts over the past
months.
Regards,

It was not possible
for Chi Theta Chi
to remain in
the Draw without
some University
oversight of
the house.
