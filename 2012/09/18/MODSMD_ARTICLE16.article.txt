## SOCCER MIXED SUNDAY Late run falls just short 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The men's soccer program has
fallen on tough times in recent
years, qualifying for the NCAA
Tournament just once in the past
nine seasons. A few early season
struggles aside, new head coach
Jeremy Gunn's squad seems
determined to make 2012 the
beginning of a new era, as long as
the Mayans are wrong.
Signs of encouragement were
plenty in Stanford's home opener
last weekend against San Jose
State a 2-1 overtime win as
well as in a 2-1 loss to Santa Clara
on Sunday.

While currently unranked, the
Cardinal (3-3) looks to be
improved over last year's team,
with a new rotation of personnel
and an added boost from its new
coach aimed at sustaining success
through what figures to be a
tough upcoming Pac-12 schedule.
Against the Broncos (2-4),
Stanford once again came out a
little flat, among the biggest com
plaints Gunn has had about his
team thus far this season.
"I was really disappointed
how we were outcompeted at the
beginning of the game," Gunn
said after the match. "Give credit
to Santa Clara; they were sharper
to the ball early on. They won
firsts, they won seconds and they
scored a couple of really good
goals. I am really happy with how
we outplayed our opponent in
the second half and had so many
great chances. The simple lesson
is that we have to start the game
in the right fashion, and we didn't
do that tonight."
Santa Clara's Ryan Masch
netted a fantastic goal just four
minutes into the match, as
Stanford's defense was slow to
close him down at the top of the
box and he rifled in an almost
unstoppable volley. He scored his
second of the match to put the
Cardinal behind the 8-ball 35
minutes after the opening whis
tle.
But as opposed to years past,
when Stanford's offensive attack
was often predicated on counter
attacks, Gunn's side continued to

press and dominate possession
and the game in the second half.
After outshooting Santa Clara
11-7 in the first half, the Cardinal
held a 13-2 edge after the break.
A nice bit of skill from senior
forward Adam Jahn gave him
enough space to turn and find the
net from inside the box, cutting
the deficit to one goal with 15
minutes remaining.
Jahn has been scoring at a tor
rid pace with four goals
already this season, last year's
second-team All-Pac-12 selection
has matched his career high and
is two goals away from the high
est single-season total for
Stanford in 10 years.
But it has been the philosoph
ical change in tactics that has the
team excited about its chances
this season. Through six games,
Stanford has scored only seven
goals but is outshooting oppo
nents 103-53, as well as earning
42 corner kicks while giving up
just 12.
Redshirt sophomore Austin
Meyer has been one of several
attacking players to see more
field time this year and made the
most of it against San Jose State
with the overtime game-winner.
His thought-process before
the goal exemplifies one of the
changes in mentality compared
to years past.
"All week in practice we'd
been talking about when you get
it in the midfield, have a look, see
if you can get a shot on frame
because you never know what
can happen," Meyer said.
The team's opening road trip
wasn't as successful from a results
perspective, as Stanford dropped
two matches in the College of
Charleston Tournament. But a
resounding 2-0 win over No. 11
UC-Irvine was a sign of the talent
currently on the Cardinal roster.
The defensive foursome of
seniors Hunter Gorskie and Eric
Anderson, sophomore Tyler
Conklin and freshman Brandon
Vincent looked to be comfort
able with each other in the sec
ond half against Santa Clara.
With Gunn still mixing and
matching to find the right combi
nation in the midfield, Stanford's
offense has been close to break
ing a few games open and figures
to improve as the season goes on
and the new system becomes
more familiar to the personnel.
The Cardinal hopes that
comes sooner rather than later,
however, as it continues its home
stand with four more games in
the next two weeks. First up is
Loyola Marymount on Friday,
Sept. 16, at 4 p.m. The game will
be the first Stanford men's soccer
game to be broadcast on the
newly created Pac-12 Networks.

we outplayed our opponent in
the second half and had so many
great chances. The simple lesson
is that we have to start the game
in the right fashion, and we didn't
do that tonight."
Santa Clara's Ryan Masch
netted a fantastic goal just four
minutes into the match, as
Stanford's defense was slow to
close him down at the top of the
box and he rifled in an almost
unstoppable volley. He scored his
second of the match to put the
Cardinal behind the 8-ball 35
minutes after the opening whis
tle.
But as opposed to years past,
when Stanford's offensive attack
was often predicated on counter
attacks, Gunn's side continued to

press and dominate possession
and the game in the second half.
After outshooting Santa Clara
11-7 in the first half, the Cardinal
held a 13-2 edge after the break.
A nice bit of skill from senior
forward Adam Jahn gave him
enough space to turn and find the
net from inside the box, cutting
the deficit to one goal with 15
minutes remaining.
Jahn has been scoring at a tor
rid pace with four goals
already this season, last year's
second-team All-Pac-12 selection
has matched his career high and
is two goals away from the high
est single-season total for
Stanford in 10 years.
But it has been the philosoph
ical change in tactics that has the
team excited about its chances
this season. Through six games,
Stanford has scored only seven
goals but is outshooting oppo
nents 103-53, as well as earning
42 corner kicks while giving up
just 12.
Redshirt sophomore Austin
Meyer has been one of several
attacking players to see more
field time this year and made the
most of it against San Jose State
with the overtime game-winner.
His thought-process before
the goal exemplifies one of the
changes in mentality compared
to years past.
"All week in practice we'd
been talking about when you get
it in the midfield, have a look, see
if you can get a shot on frame
because you never know what
can happen," Meyer said.
The team's opening road trip
wasn't as successful from a results
perspective, as Stanford dropped
two matches in the College of
Charleston Tournament. But a
resounding 2-0 win over No. 11
UC-Irvine was a sign of the talent
currently on the Cardinal roster.
The defensive foursome of
seniors Hunter Gorskie and Eric
Anderson, sophomore Tyler
Conklin and freshman Brandon
Vincent looked to be comfort
able with each other in the sec
ond half against Santa Clara.
With Gunn still mixing and
matching to find the right combi
nation in the midfield, Stanford's
offense has been close to break
ing a few games open and figures
to improve as the season goes on
and the new system becomes
more familiar to the personnel.
The Cardinal hopes that
comes sooner rather than later,
however, as it continues its home
stand with four more games in
the next two weeks. First up is
Loyola Marymount on Friday,
Sept. 16, at 4 p.m. The game will
be the first Stanford men's soccer
game to be broadcast on the
newly created Pac-12 Networks.

STANFORD 1
SANTA CLARA 2
9/16, Cagan Stadium


The Stanford Daily File Photo
Sophomore forward Zach Batteer and the Stanford men's soccer team
fell to Santa Clara 2-1 at Cagan Stadium on Sunday evening. The loss
dropped the Cardinal to 3-3 on the season after its first homestand.
The men's soccer program has
fallen on tough times in recent
years, qualifying for the NCAA
Tournament just once in the past
nine seasons. A few early season
struggles aside, new head coach
Jeremy Gunn's squad seems
determined to make 2012 the
beginning of a new era, as long as
the Mayans are wrong.
Signs of encouragement were
plenty in Stanford's home opener
last weekend against San Jose
State a 2-1 overtime win as
well as in a 2-1 loss to Santa Clara
on Sunday.

While currently unranked, the
Cardinal (3-3) looks to be
improved over last year's team,
with a new rotation of personnel
and an added boost from its new
coach aimed at sustaining success
through what figures to be a
tough upcoming Pac-12 schedule.
Against the Broncos (2-4),
Stanford once again came out a
little flat, among the biggest com
plaints Gunn has had about his
team thus far this season.
"I was really disappointed
how we were outcompeted at the
beginning of the game," Gunn
said after the match. "Give credit
to Santa Clara; they were sharper
to the ball early on. They won
firsts, they won seconds and they
scored a couple of really good
goals. I am really happy with how
we outplayed our opponent in
the second half and had so many
great chances. The simple lesson
is that we have to start the game
in the right fashion, and we didn't
do that tonight."
