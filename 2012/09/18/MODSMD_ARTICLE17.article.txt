### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
A shutout is a soccer
team's holy grail. The hat
trick is flashier, the blowout
win might be more entertain
ing, but winning a game with
out allowing the opponent to
score means the team and its
defense did its job to perfec
tion.
Holding an opponent a
Division I opponent who beat
No. 13 North Carolina in an
exhibition match and scored
two goals against Santa Clara
without even a shot? Well
that's just unheard of, unless
you're the No. 3 Stanford
women's team, who contin
ued to roll through noncon
ference play with a dominat
ing 4-0 victory over the
University of North Carolina-
Greensboro on Sunday.

On the heels of winning
the 2011 NCAA
Championship, the Cardinal
(6-1-1) is once again off to an
impressive start despite an
extremely rare letdown early
in the season. Fresh off a
thrilling 3-2 victory over No. 6
Penn State on the road in
front of 5,000 fans, Stanford
was upset by unranked West
Virginia, 1-0.
It was the team's first
defeat in 28 matches after last
season's 25-0-1 record, and
first loss in 64 regular season
games dating back to October
2008, when the current sen
iors were in high school.
Stanford coach Paul
Ratcliffenoted that streaks
come and go with the season.
"It's a new team, it's a new
year," he said. "To me, any
streak we have is over at the
end of each season. This is a
new squad, and they've got to
create their own legacy."
It didn't take long for the
Cardinal to start a new streak,
as they have gone 4-0-1 since
that loss and are back up to
No. 3 in the national rankings
thanks to a shutout streak
that stands at 413 minutes.
The Card is getting closer
to being back at full strength
after some injuries and other
commitments forced Ratcliffe
to get more creative with his
roster. Redshirt junior
Courtney Verloo has

returned to her position at
forward after missing all of
last season with an injury and
spending 2010 shoring up the
back line. She has a team-high
five assists to go along with
two goals in the first eight
matches.
In addition, Stanford wel
comed back the return of
sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu last season's
leading scorer after
Übogagu helped the U.S.
team win the FIFA Under-20
World Cup in Japan.
But one of the most
notable absences has been
junior goalkeeper Emily
Oliver. The returning first
team All-Pac-12 honoree is
widely considered to be one
of the most accomplished
goalies in the country, and is
fifth on Stanford's all-time
shutout list with 22 her
career goals-against average
is a miniscule 0.27.
Out with an undisclosed
injury, Oliver has been a large
part of Stanford's success in
the postseason, making sever
al key saves in the NCAA
Championship and earning
the NCAA College Cup
Defensive MVP.
But filling in admirably
thus far has been redshirt jun
ior Aly Gleason, receiving the
first extended action of her
career.
"It's been three years," she
said. "I feel like I've earned a
little bit of time, and here it is.
It's good to be playing well.
There's no greater feeling
than coming up with a big
save. It's just fun."
Gleason has done quite
well for herself, making 18
saves and allowing just four
goals, but will need to contin
ue making big plays if the
Cardinal is to make a deep
postseason run without
Oliver.
That certainly is Stanford's
goal at this point, having
played in the last three
NCAA Championship
matches and reaching the
College Cup four straight
years. Losing four starters to
graduation including play
er of the year Lindsay Taylor
and All-American midfielder
Teresa Noyola leaves sen
ior captains Mariah Nogueira,
Alina Garciamendez and
Rachel Quon beating the
drum to keep the Cardinal
pressing.
"It will be a personal dis
appointment if it [winning a
national championship] does
n't happen," Nogueira said. "I
hold my team to a high stan
dard, so I expect that."
Stanford opens Pac-12
play this Sunday at home
against Arizona State. Kickoff
from Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
will be at 2 p.m.

No. 3 in the national rankings
thanks to a shutout streak
that stands at 413 minutes.
The Card is getting closer
to being back at full strength
after some injuries and other
commitments forced Ratcliffe
to get more creative with his
roster. Redshirt junior
Courtney Verloo has

returned to her position at
forward after missing all of
last season with an injury and
spending 2010 shoring up the
back line. She has a team-high
five assists to go along with
two goals in the first eight
matches.
In addition, Stanford wel
comed back the return of
sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu last season's
leading scorer after
Übogagu helped the U.S.
team win the FIFA Under-20
World Cup in Japan.
But one of the most
notable absences has been
junior goalkeeper Emily
Oliver. The returning first
team All-Pac-12 honoree is
widely considered to be one
of the most accomplished
goalies in the country, and is
fifth on Stanford's all-time
shutout list with 22 her
career goals-against average
is a miniscule 0.27.
Out with an undisclosed
injury, Oliver has been a large
part of Stanford's success in
the postseason, making sever
al key saves in the NCAA
Championship and earning
the NCAA College Cup
Defensive MVP.
But filling in admirably
thus far has been redshirt jun
ior Aly Gleason, receiving the
first extended action of her
career.
"It's been three years," she
said. "I feel like I've earned a
little bit of time, and here it is.
It's good to be playing well.
There's no greater feeling
than coming up with a big
save. It's just fun."
Gleason has done quite
well for herself, making 18
saves and allowing just four
goals, but will need to contin
ue making big plays if the
Cardinal is to make a deep
postseason run without
Oliver.
That certainly is Stanford's
goal at this point, having
played in the last three
NCAA Championship
matches and reaching the
College Cup four straight
years. Losing four starters to
graduation including play
er of the year Lindsay Taylor
and All-American midfielder
Teresa Noyola leaves sen
ior captains Mariah Nogueira,
Alina Garciamendez and
Rachel Quon beating the
drum to keep the Cardinal
pressing.
"It will be a personal dis
appointment if it [winning a
national championship] does
n't happen," Nogueira said. "I
hold my team to a high stan
dard, so I expect that."
Stanford opens Pac-12
play this Sunday at home
against Arizona State. Kickoff
from Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
will be at 2 p.m.

9/16, Santa Clara, Calif.
A shutout is a soccer
team's holy grail. The hat
trick is flashier, the blowout
win might be more entertain
ing, but winning a game with
out allowing the opponent to
score means the team and its
defense did its job to perfec
tion.
Holding an opponent a
Division I opponent who beat
No. 13 North Carolina in an
exhibition match and scored
two goals against Santa Clara
without even a shot? Well
that's just unheard of, unless
you're the No. 3 Stanford
women's team, who contin
ued to roll through noncon
ference play with a dominat
ing 4-0 victory over the
University of North Carolina-
Greensboro on Sunday.

On the heels of winning
the 2011 NCAA
Championship, the Cardinal
(6-1-1) is once again off to an
impressive start despite an
extremely rare letdown early
in the season. Fresh off a
thrilling 3-2 victory over No. 6
Penn State on the road in
front of 5,000 fans, Stanford
was upset by unranked West
Virginia, 1-0.
It was the team's first
defeat in 28 matches after last
season's 25-0-1 record, and
first loss in 64 regular season
games dating back to October
2008, when the current sen
iors were in high school.
Stanford coach Paul
Ratcliffenoted that streaks
come and go with the season.
"It's a new team, it's a new
year," he said. "To me, any
streak we have is over at the
end of each season. This is a
new squad, and they've got to
create their own legacy."
It didn't take long for the
Cardinal to start a new streak,
as they have gone 4-0-1 since
that loss and are back up to
No. 3 in the national rankings
thanks to a shutout streak
that stands at 413 minutes.
