# Win not without mistakes

### Joseph Beyda 
I've never been so happy to
scream like a little girl. A very
little girl. After another upset
for the ages against No. 2
USC, I can't exactly talk.
Which makes it even more impor
tant that I can type, because, my
friends, we have a new nickname to
coin.
"Biggest Upset Ever" made for
great T-shirts in 2007. "What's Your
Deal" made for great ticket plans in
2009. And since we've been a bit
lazy after the last two thrilling wins
over the Trojans, such an iconic
game deserves to be forever
remembered by another iconic
name. I hereby submit: "The One
that Almost Got Away."
Cliche, I know, but there were
just too many times on Saturday
night where Stanford looked down
and out, so many reasons the
Cardinal shouldn't have won —if
this was any other game. It left way
too many points on the field in the
first half, it took costly penalties at
the wrong time and it completed
less than half its passes.
The Cardinal had an outside
chance to pull this one off from the
get-go. USC center Khaled Holmes
was injured, which looked to be a
huge hole for Stanford's front
seven to exploit. Just through the
gates I ran into a friend and former
high-school quarterback; he could
n't emphasize enough the impor
tance of chemistry at center,
reminding me, "The quarterback's
rubbing up against the guy's nuts 70
or 80 times."
The USC offensive line still held
strong in the first half and gave
Matt Barkley time to throw —just
what the Cardinal couldn't afford.
Barkley only had to complete one
big pass to get USC into scoring
position and, soon after, onto the
board.
Stepfan Taylor tied it with a
skillful 59-yard touchdown run, but
the final 20 minutes of the first half
were a head-scratcher. The
Cardinal hit Barkley and started
celebrating, not realizing that it had
forced a fumble; the Trojans recov
ered, converted on fourth-and-19
and soon made it 14-7. In the sec
ond quarter, Stanford had a first
and-goal at the two and couldn't
punch it in, leaving a kick to Jordan
Williamson. He had missed an early
field goal admittedly, hitting that
47-yarder off the post on a bad snap
was nothing to be blamed for
but Williamson went wide again on
the 23-yard chip shot. When
Barkley threw a pick late in the first
half, Josh Nunes gave the ball back
on the very next play; when
Barkley threw another pick, Nunes
again returned the favor (this time,
seven plays later).
A 14-7 deficit against the pre
season No. 1 was respectable
maybe commendable but if you
thought at halftime that this was
Stanford's night, you weren't
watching the same game as
me. Nunes was 6-for-17
through 30 minutes and the
Cardinal still hadn't record
ed a sack; to make matters
worse, USC running backs
Curtis McNeal and Silas
Redd both played out of the
locker room after first-half
injuries. And, of course, the
third quarter had been
Stanford's worst period all
season.
A Trojan three-and-out
to start the half was encour
aging, but all that set up was
Williamson's third missed
field goal of the evening.
Barkley now had a short
field to work with and was
ready to put the Cardinal
away. Fie nearly did just that,
marching into the red zone
before setting up a fourth
and-2 at the Stanford 13.
Then came the turning
point.
Barkley rolled right and
lobbed one up to the corner
of the end zone for freshman
fullback Soma Vainuku, who
hauled in a touchdown catch
and then dropped it, with
a whole lot of help from
sophomore defender
Ronnie Harris.
The dagger deflected,
Stanford put together a nine
play drive that stalled just
across midfield. With a Josh
Mauro sack prompting one
more Trojan three-and-out,
the Cardinal had the ball
back. The Cardinal had life.

The Cardinal had Stepfan
Taylor, scoring on a 23-yard
screen.
14-14, fourth quarter,
another three-and-out, and
for the first time all night, the
Cardinal was in the driver's
seat. Nunes was quite the
driver.
Perhaps he channeled
Andrew Luck, who had out
dueled Barkley the three
previous years. An 11-yard
completion to Ty
Montgomery escaped a
third-and-5, and Nunes
deked around defenders in
the open field for a 12 yard
dash on third-and-10. Two
plays later, he delivered the
37-yard slant strike to Ertz
that put Stanford ahead
once and for all.
Stanford Stadium was
rocking. I only wish I could've
contributed to that a little
more; there wasn't much left
in my vocal gas tank.
USC had the ball back,
but the vaunted Trojan
offense seemed impotent. I
wouldn't believe it if I hadn't
seen it. Barkley was rattled,
out of sync with his receivers
and being flat-out shown up
by Nunes. Barkley had the
perfect spirals; Nunes had
the clutch timing. I know
which I prefer.
Williamson saved a
touchdown by tripping up
Marqise Lee on the ensuing
kick return. Stanford's front
seven was in Barkley's face,
and its oft-maligned defen
sive backs were breaking up
completions with crushing
hits. Yet another Trojan
three-and-out.
After a one-yard run,

Nunes completed a 10-
yarder to Zach Ertz; from
there on out, it was Taylor
Time. He had seven carries
on the next nine plays. Just as
the Cardinal coaching staff
has been drawing it up since
2007: USC linemen with
hands on hips as Stanford lit
erally ran out the clock.
But this was "The One
that Almost Got Away," so
of course, an untimely false
start threw a wrench into the
Cardinal's perfect strategy,
and Stanford stalled at the
33 with three minutes for the
Trojans to work with.
Soon enough it was
fourth-and-5. Barkley
lobbed it to the left sideline
for Lee, who hauled it in
without much room to spare.
The call: out of bounds. Still,
on this night it just couldn't
be over yet; it wasn't, as
video review gave Barkley
and Lee their game-saving
completion.
A 20-yard catch put the
Trojans just inside Stanford
territory, but with the clock
ticking down USC called a
run play that went nowhere.
A holding penalty and two
straight sacks set up fourth
and-40; all Barkley could

muster was a heave into
double-coverage that was
out of reach on the sideline.
Fully futile for a No. 2 team,
the epitome of a night when
the Trojans rushed for 26
yards on 28 attempts, com
mitted four turnovers and
couldn't hold back a rookie
quarterback.
FOX stayed on air for
two full minutes as Cardinal
Nation conquered the field.
The series was Stanford's
Barkley, it seemed, would
never beat the Card.
On the way out of the
parking lot, a pair of USC
fans on foot took it upon
themselves to stop in front of
our car and block us for a
while. "Go f*** yourself,"
one of them shouted
through the windshield.
I've never been so happy
to hear those words directed
at me. Fight on, buddy.

Joseph Beyda was about to
confront the sore USC loser,
but decided that getting out of
the car wasn't worth the effort.
The USC fan should reveal
how thankful he is to be "The
One That Got Away" at jbey
