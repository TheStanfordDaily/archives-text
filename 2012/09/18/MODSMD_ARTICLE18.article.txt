# Win not without mistakes

### Joseph Beyda 
I've never been so happy to
scream like a little girl. A very
little girl. After another upset
for the ages against No. 2
USC, I can't exactly talk.
Which makes it even more impor
tant that I can type, because, my
friends, we have a new nickname to
coin.
"Biggest Upset Ever" made for
great T-shirts in 2007. "What's Your
Deal" made for great ticket plans in
2009. And since we've been a bit
lazy after the last two thrilling wins
over the Trojans, such an iconic
game deserves to be forever
remembered by another iconic
name. I hereby submit: "The One
that Almost Got Away."
Cliche, I know, but there were
just too many times on Saturday
night where Stanford looked down
and out, so many reasons the
Cardinal shouldn't have won —if
this was any other game. It left way
too many points on the field in the
first half, it took costly penalties at
the wrong time and it completed
less than half its passes.
The Cardinal had an outside
chance to pull this one off from the
get-go. USC center Khaled Holmes
was injured, which looked to be a
huge hole for Stanford's front
seven to exploit. Just through the
gates I ran into a friend and former
high-school quarterback; he could
n't emphasize enough the impor
tance of chemistry at center,
reminding me, "The quarterback's
rubbing up against the guy's nuts 70
or 80 times."
The USC offensive line still held
strong in the first half and gave
Matt Barkley time to throw —just
what the Cardinal couldn't afford.
Barkley only had to complete one
big pass to get USC into scoring
position and, soon after, onto the
board.
Stepfan Taylor tied it with a
skillful 59-yard touchdown run, but
the final 20 minutes of the first half
were a head-scratcher. The
Cardinal hit Barkley and started
celebrating, not realizing that it had
forced a fumble; the Trojans recov
ered, converted on fourth-and-19
and soon made it 14-7. In the sec
ond quarter, Stanford had a first
and-goal at the two and couldn't
punch it in, leaving a kick to Jordan
Williamson. He had missed an early
field goal admittedly, hitting that
47-yarder off the post on a bad snap
was nothing to be blamed for
but Williamson went wide again on
the 23-yard chip shot. When
Barkley threw a pick late in the first
half, Josh Nunes gave the ball back
on the very next play; when
Barkley threw another pick, Nunes
again returned the favor (this time,
seven plays later).
A 14-7 deficit against the pre
season No. 1 was respectable
maybe commendable but if you
thought at halftime that this was
Stanford's night, you weren't
