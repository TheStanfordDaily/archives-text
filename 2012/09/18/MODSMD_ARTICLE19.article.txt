## Cardinal squeaks past Cal 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The underclassmen are
already taking command.
Led by a trio of young gun
ners freshmen drivers Bret
Bonanni and B.J. Churnside
along with sophomore utility
Alex Bowen Stanford took
third place in the NorCal
Invitational this weekend at the
Ai7Qri7 A mintio I anlar

On Sunday, Stanford (3-1)
defeated No. 3 California 9-8 in
the third-place game after los
ing 10-9 in overtime to No. 1
USC in the semifinal. No. 3
Stanford also beat No. 5 UC-
Santa Barbara 8-7 on Saturday
after romping to a 19-1 victory
over Santa Clara.
Bowen continued his suc
cess from last year, leading
Stanford with 11 goals in the
four games this weekend.
Bowen was the Cardinal's top
goal-scorer last year, when he

won Newcomer of the Year and
first team All-American hon
ors.
But the bigger story on this
inaugural weekend was the
performance of the highly
touted freshman Bret Bonanni.
He lived up to expectations in
Stanford's first games of the
season, scoring 10 goals
including the deciding goals
against both UC-Santa
Barbara and California.
His fellow freshman
Churnside was just as clutch,
scoring with only four seconds
left against USC to force over
time. Churnside finished the
tournament with six goals.
Another key player making his
first starts was redshirt junior
goalie Scott Platshon, who is
taking the place of graduated
goalie Brian Pingree. Platshon
sat out the first game but ended
the weekend with 23 saves,
including nine in the overtime
loss to USC.
In the first of three close
games, Stanford used a strong
defensive fourth quarter to slip
past UC-Santa Barbara. Tied 4-
4 at halftime, and then 7-7 after
the third quarter, Stanford's

defense shut out the Gauchos
in the final frame to hold on for
an 8-7 win.
Stanford and USC played a
tight game throughout, with
Stanford holding the lead for
much of the contest until the
final quarter. The Cardinal
took a 4-3 lead into halftime,
which they extended to 5-3
early in the third. The Trojans
fought back, though, taking a 6-
5 lead early in a crazy fourth
quarter that saw nine total
goals.
Down a goal with four sec
onds to play, Stanford drew a
kick-out, and Churnside took a
shot from outside of four
meters and fired home past
USC's goalie to tie it up at 9-9
with three seconds on the clock
and send the game to overtime.
The scoring did not carry
over into extra time, and USC's
Jeremy Davie scored the even
tual game-winner 2:41 into the
second period after a scoreless
first session.
After a quick turnaround
between the semifinals and the
consolation game, Stanford

STANFORD 9
CALIFORNIA 8
9/16, Avery Aquatic Center
found itself ahead 7-1 in
the first half against
California. But what
looked like a routine
walkover turned tense as
California mounted a
comeback.
Cal cut the lead to 8-3
at halftime and came all
the way back only to
eventually lose by one

goal. Stanford's lone goal
of the second half, which
turned out to be a pivotal
one, came on a bizarre
play where California's
goalie was ejected and
Bonanni alertly scored
the ball on an empty net.
Stanford's next games
are in two weeks, when it
travels to Santa Barbara
for the SoCal tournament
featuring the same lineup
of the nation's top teams.
