# A 						LOOK AT STANFORD'S NFL PEDIGREE
## NEXT IN LINE 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Bob and Kodi Whitfield share a
last name, a passion for football
and a school. The obvious similar
ities between father and son
pretty much end there.
'Big Bob' was once a Pro-Bowl offen
sive lineman who spent 15 years as a ter
rorizing, 310-pound force in the National
Football League, Kodi is a sure-handed,
188-pound receiver of the future who is
still looking for his first collegiate catch.
But Bob and Kodi have something

new in common: When they made plans
to come to Stanford for the summer, nei
ther had much say in the matter.
Bob still had to make good on a 20-
year-old promise to his mother to earn
his degree. After three years at Stanford,
he left as the eighth pick in the 1992 NFL
Draft, and went on to start consistently in
his decade-and-a-half in Atlanta,
Jacksonville and New York before
returning to complete his final classes.
"You can't miss Big Bob driving
across campus," joked a former Stanford
teammate, Cardinal head coach David
Shaw, in August. "I wish he had some eli

gibility left."
Kodi, meanwhile, had caught the eye
of Pac-12 coaches as one of the 20 best
receivers playing high-school football.
Bob was the Cardinal's top recruiter.
"I told him, 'You have no choice,
you're going to Stanford,"' Bob said.
Of course, Kodi already had his sights
set on the Farm "Parents can be per
suasive and all that," Bob said, "but it's
better when the kids realize it for them
selves and grasp it" but his dad's
strong advice exemplifies an unmistak-

Barry J. Sanders, Kodi Whitfield and Andrus Peat are among the 10 players on the Stanford football squad whose fathers played in
the National Football League. Kodi's father, Bob, also starred on the Farm from 1989-1991 before leaving for the NFL Draft.
able trend in Cardinal recruiting.
Stanford now has 10 sons of
former NFL players on its roster,
accounting for a combined 927
games of pro football experience.
Both are the highest figures for
any Pac-12 team; the rest of the
conference averages about three
players per squad. And of those
10 Stanford players with NFL
pedigrees, seven are freshmen
and members of the best recruit
ing class in school history.
Recruiting coordinator Mike
Sanford remembers when, not
too long ago, Stanford's academic
prowess was its only real shot at
attracting young football
prospects. Parents have always
been hooked on the school first,
he says. But as the Cardinal
established itself as a football
powerhouse by winning 23 games
over the last two seasons, it began
to attract more prominent
recruits and more prominent
parents.
For safety Ed Reynolds and
running back Ricky Seale, all it
took to choose Stanford was their
NFL fathers' education-first
mindset plus a little bit of
advice late in the game.
"I couldn't go anywhere else,"
Reynolds said. "The only thing
[my dad] said was, 'When you
pick a school, pick a school where
you're going to have a decent
quarterback for the next couple
years.' It just happened to be
Andrew Luck."
Luck started the trend in more
ways than one; his father, Oliver,
was a pro quarterback with the
Houston Oilers before parenting
one of the best passers in college
football history.
Sanford insists that his staff
doesn't specifically recruit based
off an NFL bloodline, instead giv
ing the answer that has come to
define Stanford recruiting: "We
look for the best football players
that also happen to be the best
students in the country." For
whatever reason, many NFL
players' sons fit the bill perfectly,
and for whatever reason, many of
them have ended up at Stanford.

Kodi Whitfield's path to the
Farm is perhaps the easiest to
trace. He was around for all but
two of Bob's 15 pro seasons and
remembers "falling in love with
the sport" through his dad's
career.
Still, Bob downplays the role
his own success has played in his
son's development. If anything,
he had to make sure Kodi would
n't become complacent.
"The sport is so demanding
that, for all my greatness, that's
not going to make him that
great," Bob said. "[I remember]
saying to him,'Yo, it's not an easy
life. Kid, you've got to go earn it,
you've got to work hard to be a
good player and it's just not
going to be given to you, regard
less of your last name or your lin
eage.'"
The last name Whitfield car
ries special weight at Stanford,
where Bob was twice named an
All-American lineman blocking
for 'Touchdown Tommy' Vardell
and playing alongside Shaw, then
a wide receiver. Just a year after
Bob's retirement from pro foot
ball, Kodi began looking into
Stanford when it memorably
upset 41-point favorite USC in
2007.
The Cardinal staff looked into
Kodi as well, and he eliminated
any suspense by committing to
Stanford in June 2011, more than
six months before many top
prospects in his class would
decide.
"We just had to reaffirm how
much we wanted him here,"
Sanford said. "We don't want you
here because of your dad, we
don't want you here because of
the significance of having anoth
er Whitfield here. We want Kodi
Whitfield here Kodi himself."

But when Kodi walked onto
the Stanford campus, he was
hardly the most-hyped freshman
around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest
career total in NFL history.
Barry J., as he likes to be
called to distinguish himself from
his father, began to make a name
for himself in high school, help
ing Oklahoma's Heritage Hall
win two state titles and earning a
listing by ESPN as the ninth-best
tailback in the country.
By late 2011 he was choosing
between Stanford and
Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet
in the Fiesta Bowl. Many in
Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap
pened to be his father's alma
mater. On the other hand, aca
demics had long been a priority
in the Sanders family.
"[His parents] were so
tremendous in just guiding him
along the way academically, giv
ing him the best possible oppor
tunity to go to the best school in
the state in Oklahoma, and
encouraging him to not settle for
just being an average student
there," Sanford said.
The Cardinal lost the Fiesta
Bowl 41-38 in overtime, but man
aged to outrush the Cowboys
243-13. Five days later, Sanders
committed to Stanford.
When he was asked recently
whether the Cardinal's huge
advantage on the ground that
night had any effect on the
recruiting process, Sanford
smiled and said, "We had a big
leg up before that game."
"The first time I came out
here," Sanders told the San
Francisco Chronicle recently, "I
knew this was the place I wanted
to be."

Stanford's campus and team
atmosphere are also cited by
Seale and Reynolds, who both
say that their fathers left the col
lege decision mostly up to them.
But even if the Farm is a perfect
fit for some of these recruits,
what makes so many NFL sons
the all-around student-athletes
Sanford and his staff were look
ing for?
From the start of training
camp, Shaw raved about Kodi
Whitfield's ball-catching skills
and bragged that he had picked
up the Cardinal's sophisticated
offense faster than any receiver
he had ever seen, an achieve
ment that earned Kodi playing
time in each of Stanford's first
two games.
"My old boss Jon Gruden
used to talk about hiring coach
es' sons, hiring guys who have
lived in the profession before,"
Shaw said during fall camp.
"They don't go through the highs
and lows. You can trust them
when times are hard because
they've been through it.
"There's something to be said
for players' kids, in particular,
players who went to school
here," he added. "Kodi's been on
this campus a bunch. Kodi under
stands the culture here, it's been
a goal of Kodi's to get here ...
now his dream's been realized.
So he's one of those guys that
walked onto this campus and
didn't blink."
Even those recruits who were
too young to remember their
dads' playing days have access to
a first-hand perspective on the
grueling, unpredictable life of an
NFL player. Nobody could
understand better the impor

tance of education when a career
came to an end, whether that
resulted from injury or age.
"Back when our dads were
playing it was really all about
football," Kodi said. "But now
our dads are telling us, you know,
to get an education and think
about life after football."
Their fathers' experience also
pays dividends on the playing
field. Of Stanford's 10 NFL sons,
six most notably, Sanders
play the same positions that their
fathers thrived at professionally.
Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand
outs demonstrate anything, it's
that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.
Reynolds, whose dad of the
same name played 10 NFL sea
sons, has quickly impressed as a
Cardinal safety in 2012, intercept
ing three passes in his first two
collegiate starts and returning
one of them for a 71-yard touch
down against Duke.
"I know [that me playing] was
his dream," said Reynolds, a red
shirt sophomore. "Just having
him to help my football IQ
helped me tremendously."
The Cardinal coaching staff
has noticed that players like
Reynolds, surrounded by football
from an early age, arrive with a
different kind of work ethic.
"They grew up watching the
game not just on TV, but in
person and seeing training
camp," Sanford said. "They
understand how it's supposed to
be done at the highest level."
That mental perspective is
often the most valuable thing a
former football player can pass
on to his son, especially when
physical tools are less relevant.
Seale, whose father Sam played
for 10 years as an NFL defensive
back, has watched film of his dad
before but not in search of
pointers.
"We make fun of each other,"
Seale said. "We always talk about
who is better, if I would have
played against him, if I would
beat him or he would beat me."
Ricky hasn't seen much of the
field in his two seasons, but he
often reflects on his dad's advice
to "always be ready." You could
never know when an injury
would bump you up the depth
chart the Cardinal's is espe
cially lengthy at tailback or
whether any given play would be
a big one.
"He was just going to be there
for advice," said Seale, whose dad
would only coach him for one
season. "He just always told me
that if I wanted it, he couldn't be
the one to make me do it; I have
to want it myself."
That hands-off approach, even
from a former NFL player, makes
things much easier for coaches.
"They do such a great job of
encouraging their kids, coaching
them, but also realizing that this
is their opportunity and we're

their coaches and we're going to
bring them along," Sanford said.
"And the parents tell them to lis
ten to their coaches."

Besides Sanders and
Whitfield, Stanford recruiters
would nab five others of NFL
parentage last offseason: offen
sive linemen Andrus Peat, Josh
Garnett and Nick Davidson, cor
ner and kick returner Alex
Carter and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Of the seven, Sanders is per
haps the least likely to play this
season because of the Cardinal's
depth in the backfield; regardless,
his name has attracted so much
hype that the coaching staff was
forced to cut off the media's
access to the young tailback by
the end of training camp. Shaw
joked that Sanders was the only
player being asked about more
than Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham, who were locked in
a fierce competition to succeed
Luck at quarterback.
Though Sanders may not play
on Saturdays in 2012, many
Stanford fans already have him
tabbed as the next great Cardinal
star. They expect him to carry the
torch that Jim Harbaugh lit, Toby
Gerhart brought to the postsea
son and Andrew Luck elevated
to two straight BCS bowls.
"[Those men] just cemented
the type of quality football that
you did not see at Stanford," Bob
Whitfield said. "You know that
your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still
real living, and it doesn't change
things just because people know
your name," Whitfield said. "The
biggest thing is just the general
conversation [with your child] of
you've got a task at hand, you've
got opportunity in front of you.
Take advantage of that opportu
nity. Study hard, work hard, just
do all the things that you need to
do right... That comes from any
pro, where it's fourth down and
you've got to score on this last
play. You know you have to do
your assignment to be success
ful."
Sanford and his staff have
been very successful on the
recruiting trail. The seven players
of pro football progeny in this
year's incoming class outnumber
10 other Pac-12 teams' total sup
ply not just their freshmen.
Those NFL bloodlines are a
reflection of one thing: In the
football world, the Farm is trend
ing up.
"As we walk into living rooms,
the actual prospects themselves
are more excited about the foot
ball," Sanford said. "Players have
said, 'Hey, they play great foot
ball and it's a really good school,'
and in the past it was, 'This is a
great school, I'm looking for the
academics, but I've got to find the
best football fit for me.' We really
feel like we have the ability to
hopefully corner the market in
the elite academic and football
player type kids."
Sanford thinks that the biggest
factor in attracting NFL players'
sons is actually out of the hands
of the Cardinal coaching staff.
The recruiting process really
dates back to their fathers' play
ing days.
"They might have come
across a Stanford guy at one
point in their career in the NFL,
and they notice something differ
ent about those guys," he said.
"Along the way they all had a
chance to play with a Stanford
guy, and they said, 'Hey, I want
my kid to go to that place.'"
As it turns out, there's some
truth to that theory. Of the 10
NFL players whose sons now
wear cardinal and white, nine of
them that's each and every
one who stayed in the league for
more than a season once
shared an NFL locker room with
a former Cardinal.
Bob Whitfield understands
first-hand how significant that is.
"Whenever Stanford's men
tioned, it's mentioned with the
reverence of a great school," he
said of his one-time teammates.
"When they understand you're a
Stanford man, they greet you
accordingly. I always said it's
good in the film room, but they
knock down Stanford people too
on that field.
"You know, football is still
going to be football. But I think
that what happens is that people
understand that you're more than
just a football player when you
have Stanford behind you."

your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still
real living, and it doesn't change
things just because people know
your name," Whitfield said. "The
biggest thing is just the general
conversation [with your child] of
you've got a task at hand, you've
got opportunity in front of you.
Take advantage of that opportu
nity. Study hard, work hard, just
do all the things that you need to
do right... That comes from any
pro, where it's fourth down and
you've got to score on this last
play. You know you have to do
your assignment to be success
ful."
Sanford and his staff have
been very successful on the
recruiting trail. The seven players
of pro football progeny in this
year's incoming class outnumber
10 other Pac-12 teams' total sup
ply not just their freshmen.
Those NFL bloodlines are a
reflection of one thing: In the
football world, the Farm is trend
ing up.
"As we walk into living rooms,
the actual prospects themselves
are more excited about the foot
ball," Sanford said. "Players have
said, 'Hey, they play great foot
ball and it's a really good school,'
and in the past it was, 'This is a
great school, I'm looking for the
academics, but I've got to find the
best football fit for me.' We really
feel like we have the ability to
hopefully corner the market in
the elite academic and football
player type kids."
Sanford thinks that the biggest
factor in attracting NFL players'
sons is actually out of the hands
of the Cardinal coaching staff.
The recruiting process really
dates back to their fathers' play
ing days.
"They might have come
across a Stanford guy at one
point in their career in the NFL,
and they notice something differ
ent about those guys," he said.
"Along the way they all had a
chance to play with a Stanford
guy, and they said, 'Hey, I want
my kid to go to that place.'"
As it turns out, there's some
truth to that theory. Of the 10
NFL players whose sons now
wear cardinal and white, nine of
them that's each and every
one who stayed in the league for
more than a season once
shared an NFL locker room with
a former Cardinal.
Bob Whitfield understands
first-hand how significant that is.
"Whenever Stanford's men
tioned, it's mentioned with the
reverence of a great school," he
said of his one-time teammates.
"When they understand you're a
Stanford man, they greet you
accordingly. I always said it's
good in the film room, but they
knock down Stanford people too
on that field.
"You know, football is still
going to be football. But I think
that what happens is that people
understand that you're more than
just a football player when you
have Stanford behind you."

LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
Stanford has more sons of NFL players than any other team in the Pac- 12.
Seven of the Cardinal's 10 legacy players are new to the squad as
true freshmen and are poised to make an impact in the near future.
Bob and Kodi Whitfield share a
last name, a passion for football
and a school. The obvious similar
ities between father and son
pretty much end there.
'Big Bob' was once a Pro-Bowl offen
sive lineman who spent 15 years as a ter
rorizing, 310-pound force in the National
Football League, Kodi is a sure-handed,
188-pound receiver of the future who is
still looking for his first collegiate catch.
But Bob and Kodi have something

new in common: When they made plans
to come to Stanford for the summer, nei
ther had much say in the matter.
Bob still had to make good on a 20-
year-old promise to his mother to earn
his degree. After three years at Stanford,
he left as the eighth pick in the 1992 NFL
Draft, and went on to start consistently in
his decade-and-a-half in Atlanta,
Jacksonville and New York before
returning to complete his final classes.
"You can't miss Big Bob driving
across campus," joked a former Stanford
teammate, Cardinal head coach David
Shaw, in August. "I wish he had some eli

gibility left."
Kodi, meanwhile, had caught the eye
of Pac-12 coaches as one of the 20 best
receivers playing high-school football.
Bob was the Cardinal's top recruiter.
"I told him, 'You have no choice,
you're going to Stanford,"' Bob said.
Of course, Kodi already had his sights
set on the Farm "Parents can be per
suasive and all that," Bob said, "but it's
better when the kids realize it for them
selves and grasp it" but his dad's
strong advice exemplifies an unmistak-

Barry J. Sanders, Kodi Whitfield and Andrus Peat are among the 10 players on the Stanford football squad whose fathers played in

able trend in Cardinal recruiting.
Stanford now has 10 sons of
former NFL players on its roster,
accounting for a combined 927
games of pro football experience.
Both are the highest figures for
any Pac-12 team; the rest of the
conference averages about three
players per squad. And of those
10 Stanford players with NFL
pedigrees, seven are freshmen
and members of the best recruit
ing class in school history.
Recruiting coordinator Mike
Sanford remembers when, not
too long ago, Stanford's academic
prowess was its only real shot at
attracting young football
prospects. Parents have always
been hooked on the school first,
he says. But as the Cardinal
established itself as a football
powerhouse by winning 23 games
over the last two seasons, it began
to attract more prominent
recruits and more prominent
parents.
For safety Ed Reynolds and
running back Ricky Seale, all it
took to choose Stanford was their
NFL fathers' education-first
mindset plus a little bit of
advice late in the game.
"I couldn't go anywhere else,"
Reynolds said. "The only thing
[my dad] said was, 'When you
pick a school, pick a school where
you're going to have a decent
quarterback for the next couple
years.' It just happened to be
Andrew Luck."
Luck started the trend in more
ways than one; his father, Oliver,
was a pro quarterback with the
Houston Oilers before parenting
one of the best passers in college
football history.
Sanford insists that his staff
doesn't specifically recruit based
off an NFL bloodline, instead giv
ing the answer that has come to
define Stanford recruiting: "We
look for the best football players
that also happen to be the best
students in the country." For
whatever reason, many NFL
players' sons fit the bill perfectly,
and for whatever reason, many of
them have ended up at Stanford.

Kodi Whitfield's path to the
Farm is perhaps the easiest to
trace. He was around for all but
two of Bob's 15 pro seasons and
remembers "falling in love with
the sport" through his dad's
career.
Still, Bob downplays the role
his own success has played in his
son's development. If anything,
he had to make sure Kodi would
n't become complacent.
"The sport is so demanding
that, for all my greatness, that's
not going to make him that
great," Bob said. "[I remember]
saying to him,'Yo, it's not an easy
life. Kid, you've got to go earn it,
you've got to work hard to be a
good player and it's just not
going to be given to you, regard
less of your last name or your lin
eage.'"
The last name Whitfield car
ries special weight at Stanford,
where Bob was twice named an
All-American lineman blocking
for 'Touchdown Tommy' Vardell
and playing alongside Shaw, then
a wide receiver. Just a year after
Bob's retirement from pro foot
ball, Kodi began looking into
Stanford when it memorably
upset 41-point favorite USC in
2007.
The Cardinal staff looked into
Kodi as well, and he eliminated
any suspense by committing to
Stanford in June 2011, more than
six months before many top
prospects in his class would
decide.
"We just had to reaffirm how
much we wanted him here,"
Sanford said. "We don't want you
here because of your dad, we
don't want you here because of
the significance of having anoth
er Whitfield here. We want Kodi
Whitfield here Kodi himself."

But when Kodi walked onto
the Stanford campus, he was
hardly the most-hyped freshman
around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest
career total in NFL history.
Barry J., as he likes to be
called to distinguish himself from
his father, began to make a name
for himself in high school, help
ing Oklahoma's Heritage Hall
win two state titles and earning a
listing by ESPN as the ninth-best
tailback in the country.
By late 2011 he was choosing
between Stanford and
Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet
in the Fiesta Bowl. Many in
Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap
pened to be his father's alma
mater. On the other hand, aca
demics had long been a priority
in the Sanders family.
"[His parents] were so
tremendous in just guiding him
along the way academically, giv
ing him the best possible oppor
tunity to go to the best school in
the state in Oklahoma, and
encouraging him to not settle for
just being an average student
there," Sanford said.
The Cardinal lost the Fiesta
Bowl 41-38 in overtime, but man
aged to outrush the Cowboys
243-13. Five days later, Sanders
committed to Stanford.
When he was asked recently
whether the Cardinal's huge
advantage on the ground that
night had any effect on the
recruiting process, Sanford
smiled and said, "We had a big
leg up before that game."
"The first time I came out
here," Sanders told the San
Francisco Chronicle recently, "I
knew this was the place I wanted
to be."

Stanford's campus and team
atmosphere are also cited by
Seale and Reynolds, who both
say that their fathers left the col
lege decision mostly up to them.
But even if the Farm is a perfect
fit for some of these recruits,
what makes so many NFL sons
the all-around student-athletes
Sanford and his staff were look
ing for?
From the start of training
camp, Shaw raved about Kodi
Whitfield's ball-catching skills
and bragged that he had picked
up the Cardinal's sophisticated
offense faster than any receiver
he had ever seen, an achieve
ment that earned Kodi playing
time in each of Stanford's first
two games.
"My old boss Jon Gruden
used to talk about hiring coach
es' sons, hiring guys who have
lived in the profession before,"
Shaw said during fall camp.
"They don't go through the highs
and lows. You can trust them
when times are hard because
they've been through it.
"There's something to be said
for players' kids, in particular,
players who went to school
here," he added. "Kodi's been on
this campus a bunch. Kodi under
stands the culture here, it's been
a goal of Kodi's to get here ...
now his dream's been realized.
So he's one of those guys that
walked onto this campus and
didn't blink."
Even those recruits who were
too young to remember their
dads' playing days have access to
a first-hand perspective on the
grueling, unpredictable life of an
NFL player. Nobody could
understand better the impor

tance of education when a career
came to an end, whether that
resulted from injury or age.
"Back when our dads were
playing it was really all about
football," Kodi said. "But now
our dads are telling us, you know,
to get an education and think
about life after football."
Their fathers' experience also
pays dividends on the playing
field. Of Stanford's 10 NFL sons,
six most notably, Sanders
play the same positions that their
fathers thrived at professionally.
Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand
outs demonstrate anything, it's
that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.
Reynolds, whose dad of the
same name played 10 NFL sea
sons, has quickly impressed as a
Cardinal safety in 2012, intercept
ing three passes in his first two
collegiate starts and returning
one of them for a 71-yard touch
down against Duke.
"I know [that me playing] was
his dream," said Reynolds, a red
shirt sophomore. "Just having
him to help my football IQ
helped me tremendously."
The Cardinal coaching staff
has noticed that players like
Reynolds, surrounded by football
from an early age, arrive with a
different kind of work ethic.
"They grew up watching the
game not just on TV, but in
person and seeing training
camp," Sanford said. "They
understand how it's supposed to
be done at the highest level."
That mental perspective is
often the most valuable thing a
former football player can pass
on to his son, especially when
physical tools are less relevant.
Seale, whose father Sam played
for 10 years as an NFL defensive
back, has watched film of his dad
before but not in search of
pointers.
"We make fun of each other,"
Seale said. "We always talk about
who is better, if I would have
played against him, if I would
beat him or he would beat me."
Ricky hasn't seen much of the
field in his two seasons, but he
often reflects on his dad's advice
to "always be ready." You could
never know when an injury
would bump you up the depth
chart the Cardinal's is espe
cially lengthy at tailback or
whether any given play would be
a big one.
"He was just going to be there
for advice," said Seale, whose dad
would only coach him for one
season. "He just always told me
that if I wanted it, he couldn't be
the one to make me do it; I have
to want it myself."
That hands-off approach, even
from a former NFL player, makes
things much easier for coaches.
"They do such a great job of
encouraging their kids, coaching
them, but also realizing that this
is their opportunity and we're

their coaches and we're going to
bring them along," Sanford said.
"And the parents tell them to lis
ten to their coaches."

Besides Sanders and
Whitfield, Stanford recruiters
would nab five others of NFL
parentage last offseason: offen
sive linemen Andrus Peat, Josh
Garnett and Nick Davidson, cor
ner and kick returner Alex
Carter and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Of the seven, Sanders is per
haps the least likely to play this
season because of the Cardinal's
depth in the backfield; regardless,
his name has attracted so much
hype that the coaching staff was
forced to cut off the media's
access to the young tailback by
the end of training camp. Shaw
joked that Sanders was the only
player being asked about more
than Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham, who were locked in
a fierce competition to succeed
Luck at quarterback.
Though Sanders may not play
on Saturdays in 2012, many
Stanford fans already have him
tabbed as the next great Cardinal
star. They expect him to carry the
torch that Jim Harbaugh lit, Toby
Gerhart brought to the postsea
son and Andrew Luck elevated
to two straight BCS bowls.
"[Those men] just cemented
the type of quality football that
you did not see at Stanford," Bob
Whitfield said. "You know that
your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still

things just because people know

biggest thing is just the general

Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand
outs demonstrate anything, it's
that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.
Reynolds, whose dad of the
same name played 10 NFL sea
sons, has quickly impressed as a
Cardinal safety in 2012, intercept
ing three passes in his first two
collegiate starts and returning
one of them for a 71-yard touch
down against Duke.
"I know [that me playing] was
his dream," said Reynolds, a red
shirt sophomore. "Just having
him to help my football IQ
helped me tremendously."
The Cardinal coaching staff
has noticed that players like
Reynolds, surrounded by football
from an early age, arrive with a
different kind of work ethic.
"They grew up watching the
game not just on TV, but in
person and seeing training
camp," Sanford said. "They
understand how it's supposed to
be done at the highest level."
That mental perspective is
often the most valuable thing a
former football player can pass
on to his son, especially when
physical tools are less relevant.
Seale, whose father Sam played
for 10 years as an NFL defensive
back, has watched film of his dad
before but not in search of
pointers.
"We make fun of each other,"
Seale said. "We always talk about
who is better, if I would have
played against him, if I would
beat him or he would beat me."
Ricky hasn't seen much of the
field in his two seasons, but he
often reflects on his dad's advice
to "always be ready." You could
never know when an injury
would bump you up the depth
chart the Cardinal's is espe
cially lengthy at tailback or
whether any given play would be
a big one.
"He was just going to be there
for advice," said Seale, whose dad
would only coach him for one
season. "He just always told me
that if I wanted it, he couldn't be
the one to make me do it; I have
to want it myself."
That hands-off approach, even
from a former NFL player, makes
things much easier for coaches.
"They do such a great job of
encouraging their kids, coaching
them, but also realizing that this
is their opportunity and we're

their coaches and we're going to
bring them along," Sanford said.
"And the parents tell them to lis
ten to their coaches."

Besides Sanders and
Whitfield, Stanford recruiters
would nab five others of NFL
parentage last offseason: offen
sive linemen Andrus Peat, Josh
Garnett and Nick Davidson, cor
ner and kick returner Alex
Carter and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Of the seven, Sanders is per
haps the least likely to play this
season because of the Cardinal's
depth in the backfield; regardless,
his name has attracted so much
hype that the coaching staff was
forced to cut off the media's
access to the young tailback by
the end of training camp. Shaw
joked that Sanders was the only
player being asked about more
than Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham, who were locked in
a fierce competition to succeed
Luck at quarterback.
Though Sanders may not play
on Saturdays in 2012, many
Stanford fans already have him
tabbed as the next great Cardinal
star. They expect him to carry the
torch that Jim Harbaugh lit, Toby
Gerhart brought to the postsea
son and Andrew Luck elevated
to two straight BCS bowls.
"[Those men] just cemented
the type of quality football that
you did not see at Stanford," Bob
Whitfield said. "You know that
your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still
real living, and it doesn't change
things just because people know
your name," Whitfield said. "The
biggest thing is just the general
conversation [with your child] of
you've got a task at hand, you've
got opportunity in front of you.
Take advantage of that opportu
nity. Study hard, work hard, just
do all the things that you need to
do right... That comes from any
pro, where it's fourth down and
you've got to score on this last
play. You know you have to do
your assignment to be success
ful."
Sanford and his staff have
been very successful on the
recruiting trail. The seven players
of pro football progeny in this
year's incoming class outnumber
10 other Pac-12 teams' total sup
ply not just their freshmen.
Those NFL bloodlines are a
reflection of one thing: In the
football world, the Farm is trend
ing up.
"As we walk into living rooms,
the actual prospects themselves
are more excited about the foot
ball," Sanford said. "Players have
said, 'Hey, they play great foot
ball and it's a really good school,'
and in the past it was, 'This is a
great school, I'm looking for the
academics, but I've got to find the
best football fit for me.' We really
feel like we have the ability to
hopefully corner the market in
the elite academic and football
player type kids."
Sanford thinks that the biggest
factor in attracting NFL players'
sons is actually out of the hands
of the Cardinal coaching staff.
The recruiting process really
dates back to their fathers' play
ing days.
"They might have come
across a Stanford guy at one
point in their career in the NFL,
and they notice something differ
ent about those guys," he said.
"Along the way they all had a
chance to play with a Stanford
guy, and they said, 'Hey, I want
my kid to go to that place.'"
As it turns out, there's some
truth to that theory. Of the 10
NFL players whose sons now
wear cardinal and white, nine of
them that's each and every
one who stayed in the league for
more than a season once
shared an NFL locker room with
a former Cardinal.
Bob Whitfield understands
first-hand how significant that is.
"Whenever Stanford's men
tioned, it's mentioned with the
reverence of a great school," he
said of his one-time teammates.
"When they understand you're a
Stanford man, they greet you
accordingly. I always said it's
good in the film room, but they
knock down Stanford people too
on that field.
"You know, football is still
going to be football. But I think
that what happens is that people
understand that you're more than
just a football player when you
have Stanford behind you."

LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
Stanford has more sons of NFL players than any other team in the Pac- 12.
Seven of the Cardinal's 10 legacy players are new to the squad as
true freshmen and are poised to make an impact in the near future.
Bob and Kodi Whitfield share a
last name, a passion for football
and a school. The obvious similar
ities between father and son
pretty much end there.
'Big Bob' was once a Pro-Bowl offen
sive lineman who spent 15 years as a ter
rorizing, 310-pound force in the National
Football League, Kodi is a sure-handed,
188-pound receiver of the future who is
still looking for his first collegiate catch.
But Bob and Kodi have something

new in common: When they made plans
to come to Stanford for the summer, nei
ther had much say in the matter.
Bob still had to make good on a 20-
year-old promise to his mother to earn
his degree. After three years at Stanford,
he left as the eighth pick in the 1992 NFL
Draft, and went on to start consistently in
his decade-and-a-half in Atlanta,
Jacksonville and New York before
returning to complete his final classes.
"You can't miss Big Bob driving
across campus," joked a former Stanford
teammate, Cardinal head coach David
Shaw, in August. "I wish he had some eli

gibility left."
Kodi, meanwhile, had caught the eye
of Pac-12 coaches as one of the 20 best
receivers playing high-school football.
Bob was the Cardinal's top recruiter.
"I told him, 'You have no choice,
you're going to Stanford,"' Bob said.
Of course, Kodi already had his sights
set on the Farm "Parents can be per
suasive and all that," Bob said, "but it's
better when the kids realize it for them
selves and grasp it" but his dad's
strong advice exemplifies an unmistak-

Barry J. Sanders, Kodi Whitfield and Andrus Peat are among the 10 players on the Stanford football squad whose fathers played in

able trend in Cardinal recruiting.
Stanford now has 10 sons of
former NFL players on its roster,
accounting for a combined 927
games of pro football experience.
Both are the highest figures for
any Pac-12 team; the rest of the
conference averages about three
players per squad. And of those
10 Stanford players with NFL
pedigrees, seven are freshmen
and members of the best recruit
ing class in school history.
Recruiting coordinator Mike
Sanford remembers when, not
too long ago, Stanford's academic
prowess was its only real shot at
attracting young football
prospects. Parents have always
been hooked on the school first,
he says. But as the Cardinal
established itself as a football
powerhouse by winning 23 games
over the last two seasons, it began
to attract more prominent
recruits and more prominent
parents.
For safety Ed Reynolds and
running back Ricky Seale, all it
took to choose Stanford was their
NFL fathers' education-first
mindset plus a little bit of
advice late in the game.
"I couldn't go anywhere else,"
Reynolds said. "The only thing
[my dad] said was, 'When you
pick a school, pick a school where
you're going to have a decent
quarterback for the next couple
years.' It just happened to be
Andrew Luck."
Luck started the trend in more
ways than one; his father, Oliver,
was a pro quarterback with the
Houston Oilers before parenting
one of the best passers in college
football history.
Sanford insists that his staff
doesn't specifically recruit based
off an NFL bloodline, instead giv
ing the answer that has come to
define Stanford recruiting: "We
look for the best football players
that also happen to be the best
students in the country." For
whatever reason, many NFL
players' sons fit the bill perfectly,
and for whatever reason, many of
them have ended up at Stanford.

Kodi Whitfield's path to the
Farm is perhaps the easiest to
trace. He was around for all but
two of Bob's 15 pro seasons and
remembers "falling in love with
the sport" through his dad's
career.
Still, Bob downplays the role
his own success has played in his
son's development. If anything,
he had to make sure Kodi would
n't become complacent.
"The sport is so demanding
that, for all my greatness, that's
not going to make him that
great," Bob said. "[I remember]
saying to him,'Yo, it's not an easy
life. Kid, you've got to go earn it,
you've got to work hard to be a
good player and it's just not
going to be given to you, regard
less of your last name or your lin
eage.'"
The last name Whitfield car
ries special weight at Stanford,
where Bob was twice named an
All-American lineman blocking
for 'Touchdown Tommy' Vardell
and playing alongside Shaw, then
a wide receiver. Just a year after
Bob's retirement from pro foot
ball, Kodi began looking into
Stanford when it memorably
upset 41-point favorite USC in
2007.
The Cardinal staff looked into
Kodi as well, and he eliminated
any suspense by committing to
Stanford in June 2011, more than
six months before many top
prospects in his class would
decide.
"We just had to reaffirm how
much we wanted him here,"
Sanford said. "We don't want you
here because of your dad, we
don't want you here because of
the significance of having anoth
er Whitfield here. We want Kodi
Whitfield here Kodi himself."

But when Kodi walked onto
the Stanford campus, he was
hardly the most-hyped freshman
around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest
career total in NFL history.
Barry J., as he likes to be
called to distinguish himself from
his father, began to make a name
for himself in high school, help
ing Oklahoma's Heritage Hall
win two state titles and earning a
listing by ESPN as the ninth-best
tailback in the country.
By late 2011 he was choosing
between Stanford and
Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet
in the Fiesta Bowl. Many in
Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap
pened to be his father's alma
mater. On the other hand, aca
demics had long been a priority
in the Sanders family.
"[His parents] were so
tremendous in just guiding him
along the way academically, giv
ing him the best possible oppor
tunity to go to the best school in
the state in Oklahoma, and
encouraging him to not settle for
just being an average student
there," Sanford said.
The Cardinal lost the Fiesta
Bowl 41-38 in overtime, but man
aged to outrush the Cowboys
243-13. Five days later, Sanders
committed to Stanford.
When he was asked recently
whether the Cardinal's huge
advantage on the ground that
night had any effect on the
recruiting process, Sanford
smiled and said, "We had a big
leg up before that game."
"The first time I came out
here," Sanders told the San
Francisco Chronicle recently, "I
knew this was the place I wanted
to be."

Stanford's campus and team
atmosphere are also cited by
Seale and Reynolds, who both
say that their fathers left the col
lege decision mostly up to them.
But even if the Farm is a perfect
fit for some of these recruits,
what makes so many NFL sons
the all-around student-athletes
Sanford and his staff were look
ing for?
From the start of training
camp, Shaw raved about Kodi
Whitfield's ball-catching skills
and bragged that he had picked
up the Cardinal's sophisticated
offense faster than any receiver
he had ever seen, an achieve
ment that earned Kodi playing
time in each of Stanford's first
two games.
"My old boss Jon Gruden
used to talk about hiring coach
es' sons, hiring guys who have
lived in the profession before,"
Shaw said during fall camp.
"They don't go through the highs
and lows. You can trust them
when times are hard because
they've been through it.
"There's something to be said
for players' kids, in particular,
players who went to school
here," he added. "Kodi's been on
this campus a bunch. Kodi under
stands the culture here, it's been
a goal of Kodi's to get here ...
now his dream's been realized.
So he's one of those guys that
walked onto this campus and
didn't blink."
Even those recruits who were
too young to remember their
dads' playing days have access to
a first-hand perspective on the
grueling, unpredictable life of an
NFL player. Nobody could
understand better the impor

tance of education when a career
came to an end, whether that
resulted from injury or age.
"Back when our dads were
playing it was really all about
football," Kodi said. "But now
our dads are telling us, you know,
to get an education and think
about life after football."
Their fathers' experience also
pays dividends on the playing
field. Of Stanford's 10 NFL sons,
six most notably, Sanders
play the same positions that their
fathers thrived at professionally.
Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand

that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.

around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest
career total in NFL history.
Barry J., as he likes to be
called to distinguish himself from
his father, began to make a name
for himself in high school, help
ing Oklahoma's Heritage Hall
win two state titles and earning a
listing by ESPN as the ninth-best
tailback in the country.
By late 2011 he was choosing
between Stanford and
Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet
in the Fiesta Bowl. Many in
Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap
pened to be his father's alma
mater. On the other hand, aca
demics had long been a priority
in the Sanders family.
"[His parents] were so
tremendous in just guiding him
along the way academically, giv
ing him the best possible oppor
tunity to go to the best school in
the state in Oklahoma, and
encouraging him to not settle for
just being an average student
there," Sanford said.
The Cardinal lost the Fiesta
Bowl 41-38 in overtime, but man
aged to outrush the Cowboys
243-13. Five days later, Sanders
committed to Stanford.
When he was asked recently
whether the Cardinal's huge
advantage on the ground that
night had any effect on the
recruiting process, Sanford
smiled and said, "We had a big
leg up before that game."
"The first time I came out
here," Sanders told the San
Francisco Chronicle recently, "I
knew this was the place I wanted
to be."

Stanford's campus and team
atmosphere are also cited by
Seale and Reynolds, who both
say that their fathers left the col
lege decision mostly up to them.
But even if the Farm is a perfect
fit for some of these recruits,
what makes so many NFL sons
the all-around student-athletes
Sanford and his staff were look
ing for?
From the start of training
camp, Shaw raved about Kodi
Whitfield's ball-catching skills
and bragged that he had picked
up the Cardinal's sophisticated
offense faster than any receiver
he had ever seen, an achieve
ment that earned Kodi playing
time in each of Stanford's first
two games.
"My old boss Jon Gruden
used to talk about hiring coach
es' sons, hiring guys who have
lived in the profession before,"
Shaw said during fall camp.
"They don't go through the highs
and lows. You can trust them
when times are hard because
they've been through it.
"There's something to be said
for players' kids, in particular,
players who went to school
here," he added. "Kodi's been on
this campus a bunch. Kodi under
stands the culture here, it's been
a goal of Kodi's to get here ...
now his dream's been realized.
So he's one of those guys that
walked onto this campus and
didn't blink."
Even those recruits who were
too young to remember their
dads' playing days have access to
a first-hand perspective on the
grueling, unpredictable life of an
NFL player. Nobody could
understand better the impor

tance of education when a career
came to an end, whether that
resulted from injury or age.
"Back when our dads were
playing it was really all about
football," Kodi said. "But now
our dads are telling us, you know,
to get an education and think
about life after football."
Their fathers' experience also
pays dividends on the playing
field. Of Stanford's 10 NFL sons,
six most notably, Sanders
play the same positions that their
fathers thrived at professionally.
Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand
outs demonstrate anything, it's
that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.
Reynolds, whose dad of the
same name played 10 NFL sea
sons, has quickly impressed as a
Cardinal safety in 2012, intercept
ing three passes in his first two
collegiate starts and returning
one of them for a 71-yard touch
down against Duke.
"I know [that me playing] was
his dream," said Reynolds, a red
shirt sophomore. "Just having
him to help my football IQ
helped me tremendously."
The Cardinal coaching staff
has noticed that players like
Reynolds, surrounded by football
from an early age, arrive with a
different kind of work ethic.
"They grew up watching the
game not just on TV, but in
person and seeing training
camp," Sanford said. "They
understand how it's supposed to
be done at the highest level."
That mental perspective is
often the most valuable thing a
former football player can pass
on to his son, especially when
physical tools are less relevant.
Seale, whose father Sam played
for 10 years as an NFL defensive
back, has watched film of his dad
before but not in search of
pointers.
"We make fun of each other,"
Seale said. "We always talk about
who is better, if I would have
played against him, if I would
beat him or he would beat me."
Ricky hasn't seen much of the
field in his two seasons, but he
often reflects on his dad's advice
to "always be ready." You could
never know when an injury
would bump you up the depth
chart the Cardinal's is espe
cially lengthy at tailback or
whether any given play would be
a big one.
"He was just going to be there
for advice," said Seale, whose dad
would only coach him for one
season. "He just always told me
that if I wanted it, he couldn't be
the one to make me do it; I have
to want it myself."
That hands-off approach, even
from a former NFL player, makes
things much easier for coaches.
"They do such a great job of
encouraging their kids, coaching
them, but also realizing that this
is their opportunity and we're

their coaches and we're going to
bring them along," Sanford said.
"And the parents tell them to lis
ten to their coaches."

Besides Sanders and
Whitfield, Stanford recruiters
would nab five others of NFL
parentage last offseason: offen
sive linemen Andrus Peat, Josh
Garnett and Nick Davidson, cor
ner and kick returner Alex
Carter and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Of the seven, Sanders is per
haps the least likely to play this
season because of the Cardinal's
depth in the backfield; regardless,
his name has attracted so much
hype that the coaching staff was
forced to cut off the media's
access to the young tailback by
the end of training camp. Shaw
joked that Sanders was the only
player being asked about more
than Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham, who were locked in
a fierce competition to succeed
Luck at quarterback.
Though Sanders may not play
on Saturdays in 2012, many
Stanford fans already have him
tabbed as the next great Cardinal
star. They expect him to carry the
torch that Jim Harbaugh lit, Toby
Gerhart brought to the postsea
son and Andrew Luck elevated
to two straight BCS bowls.
"[Those men] just cemented
the type of quality football that
you did not see at Stanford," Bob
Whitfield said. "You know that
your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still
real living, and it doesn't change
things just because people know
your name," Whitfield said. "The
biggest thing is just the general
conversation [with your child] of
you've got a task at hand, you've
got opportunity in front of you.
Take advantage of that opportu
nity. Study hard, work hard, just
do all the things that you need to
do right... That comes from any
pro, where it's fourth down and
you've got to score on this last
play. You know you have to do
your assignment to be success
ful."
Sanford and his staff have
been very successful on the
recruiting trail. The seven players
of pro football progeny in this
year's incoming class outnumber
10 other Pac-12 teams' total sup
ply not just their freshmen.
Those NFL bloodlines are a
reflection of one thing: In the
football world, the Farm is trend
ing up.
"As we walk into living rooms,
the actual prospects themselves
are more excited about the foot
ball," Sanford said. "Players have
said, 'Hey, they play great foot
ball and it's a really good school,'
and in the past it was, 'This is a
great school, I'm looking for the
academics, but I've got to find the
best football fit for me.' We really
feel like we have the ability to
hopefully corner the market in
the elite academic and football
player type kids."
Sanford thinks that the biggest
factor in attracting NFL players'
sons is actually out of the hands
of the Cardinal coaching staff.
The recruiting process really
dates back to their fathers' play
ing days.
"They might have come
across a Stanford guy at one
point in their career in the NFL,
and they notice something differ
ent about those guys," he said.
"Along the way they all had a
chance to play with a Stanford
guy, and they said, 'Hey, I want
my kid to go to that place.'"
As it turns out, there's some
truth to that theory. Of the 10
NFL players whose sons now
wear cardinal and white, nine of
them that's each and every
one who stayed in the league for
more than a season once
shared an NFL locker room with
a former Cardinal.
Bob Whitfield understands
first-hand how significant that is.
"Whenever Stanford's men
tioned, it's mentioned with the
reverence of a great school," he
said of his one-time teammates.
"When they understand you're a
Stanford man, they greet you
accordingly. I always said it's
good in the film room, but they
knock down Stanford people too
on that field.
"You know, football is still
going to be football. But I think
that what happens is that people
understand that you're more than
just a football player when you
have Stanford behind you."

LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
Stanford has more sons of NFL players than any other team in the Pac- 12.
Seven of the Cardinal's 10 legacy players are new to the squad as
true freshmen and are poised to make an impact in the near future.
Bob and Kodi Whitfield share a
last name, a passion for football
and a school. The obvious similar
ities between father and son
pretty much end there.
'Big Bob' was once a Pro-Bowl offen
sive lineman who spent 15 years as a ter
rorizing, 310-pound force in the National
Football League, Kodi is a sure-handed,
188-pound receiver of the future who is
still looking for his first collegiate catch.
But Bob and Kodi have something

new in common: When they made plans
to come to Stanford for the summer, nei
ther had much say in the matter.
Bob still had to make good on a 20-
year-old promise to his mother to earn
his degree. After three years at Stanford,
he left as the eighth pick in the 1992 NFL
Draft, and went on to start consistently in
his decade-and-a-half in Atlanta,
Jacksonville and New York before
returning to complete his final classes.
"You can't miss Big Bob driving
across campus," joked a former Stanford
teammate, Cardinal head coach David
Shaw, in August. "I wish he had some eli

gibility left."
Kodi, meanwhile, had caught the eye
of Pac-12 coaches as one of the 20 best
receivers playing high-school football.
Bob was the Cardinal's top recruiter.
"I told him, 'You have no choice,
you're going to Stanford,"' Bob said.
Of course, Kodi already had his sights
set on the Farm "Parents can be per
suasive and all that," Bob said, "but it's
better when the kids realize it for them
selves and grasp it" but his dad's
strong advice exemplifies an unmistak-

Barry J. Sanders, Kodi Whitfield and Andrus Peat are among the 10 players on the Stanford football squad whose fathers played in
the National Football League. Kodi's father, Bob, also starred on the Farm from 1989-1991 before leaving for the NFL Draft.
able trend in Cardinal recruiting.
Stanford now has 10 sons of
former NFL players on its roster,
accounting for a combined 927
games of pro football experience.
Both are the highest figures for
any Pac-12 team; the rest of the
conference averages about three
players per squad. And of those
10 Stanford players with NFL
pedigrees, seven are freshmen
and members of the best recruit
ing class in school history.
Recruiting coordinator Mike
Sanford remembers when, not
too long ago, Stanford's academic
prowess was its only real shot at
attracting young football
prospects. Parents have always
been hooked on the school first,
he says. But as the Cardinal
established itself as a football
powerhouse by winning 23 games
over the last two seasons, it began
to attract more prominent
recruits and more prominent
parents.
For safety Ed Reynolds and
running back Ricky Seale, all it
took to choose Stanford was their
NFL fathers' education-first
mindset plus a little bit of
advice late in the game.
"I couldn't go anywhere else,"
Reynolds said. "The only thing
[my dad] said was, 'When you
pick a school, pick a school where
you're going to have a decent
quarterback for the next couple
years.' It just happened to be
Andrew Luck."
Luck started the trend in more
ways than one; his father, Oliver,
was a pro quarterback with the
Houston Oilers before parenting
one of the best passers in college
football history.
Sanford insists that his staff
doesn't specifically recruit based
off an NFL bloodline, instead giv
ing the answer that has come to
define Stanford recruiting: "We
look for the best football players
that also happen to be the best
students in the country." For
whatever reason, many NFL
players' sons fit the bill perfectly,
and for whatever reason, many of
them have ended up at Stanford.

Kodi Whitfield's path to the
Farm is perhaps the easiest to
trace. He was around for all but
two of Bob's 15 pro seasons and
remembers "falling in love with
the sport" through his dad's
career.
Still, Bob downplays the role
his own success has played in his
son's development. If anything,
he had to make sure Kodi would
n't become complacent.
"The sport is so demanding
that, for all my greatness, that's
not going to make him that
great," Bob said. "[I remember]
saying to him,'Yo, it's not an easy
life. Kid, you've got to go earn it,
you've got to work hard to be a
good player and it's just not
going to be given to you, regard
less of your last name or your lin
eage.'"
The last name Whitfield car
ries special weight at Stanford,
where Bob was twice named an
All-American lineman blocking
for 'Touchdown Tommy' Vardell
and playing alongside Shaw, then
a wide receiver. Just a year after
Bob's retirement from pro foot
ball, Kodi began looking into
Stanford when it memorably
upset 41-point favorite USC in
2007.
The Cardinal staff looked into
Kodi as well, and he eliminated
any suspense by committing to
Stanford in June 2011, more than
six months before many top
prospects in his class would
decide.
"We just had to reaffirm how
much we wanted him here,"
Sanford said. "We don't want you
here because of your dad, we
don't want you here because of
the significance of having anoth
er Whitfield here. We want Kodi
Whitfield here Kodi himself."

But when Kodi walked onto
the Stanford campus, he was
hardly the most-hyped freshman
around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest

By late 2011 he was choosing

Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet

Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap

Barry J. Sanders, Kodi Whitfield and Andrus Peat are among the 10 players on the Stanford football squad whose fathers played in
the National Football League. Kodi's father, Bob, also starred on the Farm from 1989-1991 before leaving for the NFL Draft.
able trend in Cardinal recruiting.
Stanford now has 10 sons of
former NFL players on its roster,
accounting for a combined 927
games of pro football experience.
Both are the highest figures for
any Pac-12 team; the rest of the
conference averages about three
players per squad. And of those
10 Stanford players with NFL
pedigrees, seven are freshmen
and members of the best recruit
ing class in school history.
Recruiting coordinator Mike
Sanford remembers when, not
too long ago, Stanford's academic
prowess was its only real shot at
attracting young football
prospects. Parents have always
been hooked on the school first,
he says. But as the Cardinal
established itself as a football
powerhouse by winning 23 games
over the last two seasons, it began
to attract more prominent
recruits and more prominent
parents.
For safety Ed Reynolds and
running back Ricky Seale, all it
took to choose Stanford was their
NFL fathers' education-first
mindset plus a little bit of
advice late in the game.
"I couldn't go anywhere else,"
Reynolds said. "The only thing
[my dad] said was, 'When you
pick a school, pick a school where
you're going to have a decent
quarterback for the next couple
years.' It just happened to be
Andrew Luck."
Luck started the trend in more
ways than one; his father, Oliver,
was a pro quarterback with the
Houston Oilers before parenting
one of the best passers in college
football history.
Sanford insists that his staff
doesn't specifically recruit based
off an NFL bloodline, instead giv
ing the answer that has come to
define Stanford recruiting: "We
look for the best football players
that also happen to be the best
students in the country." For
whatever reason, many NFL
players' sons fit the bill perfectly,
and for whatever reason, many of
them have ended up at Stanford.

Kodi Whitfield's path to the
Farm is perhaps the easiest to
trace. He was around for all but
two of Bob's 15 pro seasons and
remembers "falling in love with
the sport" through his dad's
career.
Still, Bob downplays the role
his own success has played in his
son's development. If anything,
he had to make sure Kodi would
n't become complacent.
"The sport is so demanding
that, for all my greatness, that's
not going to make him that
great," Bob said. "[I remember]
saying to him,'Yo, it's not an easy
life. Kid, you've got to go earn it,
you've got to work hard to be a
good player and it's just not
going to be given to you, regard
less of your last name or your lin
eage.'"
The last name Whitfield car
ries special weight at Stanford,
where Bob was twice named an
All-American lineman blocking
for 'Touchdown Tommy' Vardell
and playing alongside Shaw, then
a wide receiver. Just a year after
Bob's retirement from pro foot
ball, Kodi began looking into
Stanford when it memorably
upset 41-point favorite USC in
2007.
The Cardinal staff looked into
Kodi as well, and he eliminated
any suspense by committing to
Stanford in June 2011, more than
six months before many top
prospects in his class would
decide.
"We just had to reaffirm how
much we wanted him here,"
Sanford said. "We don't want you
here because of your dad, we
don't want you here because of
the significance of having anoth
er Whitfield here. We want Kodi
Whitfield here Kodi himself."

But when Kodi walked onto
the Stanford campus, he was
hardly the most-hyped freshman
around. That somewhat unfortu
nate distinction fell to running
back Barry Sanders, whose
father of the same name is
known as one of the best pro
backs of all time. In 10 seasons
with the Detroit Lions, the elder
Sanders never failed to make a
Pro Bowl team and compiled
15,269 yards, the third-highest
career total in NFL history.
Barry J., as he likes to be
called to distinguish himself from
his father, began to make a name
for himself in high school, help
ing Oklahoma's Heritage Hall
win two state titles and earning a
listing by ESPN as the ninth-best
tailback in the country.
By late 2011 he was choosing
between Stanford and
Oklahoma State, just as the two
schools were preparing to meet
in the Fiesta Bowl. Many in
Sanders' home state thought he
would choose the Cowboys, who
played just an hour away from
his high school and also hap
pened to be his father's alma
mater. On the other hand, aca
demics had long been a priority
in the Sanders family.
"[His parents] were so
tremendous in just guiding him
along the way academically, giv
ing him the best possible oppor
tunity to go to the best school in
the state in Oklahoma, and
encouraging him to not settle for
just being an average student
there," Sanford said.
The Cardinal lost the Fiesta
Bowl 41-38 in overtime, but man
aged to outrush the Cowboys
243-13. Five days later, Sanders
committed to Stanford.
When he was asked recently
whether the Cardinal's huge
advantage on the ground that
night had any effect on the
recruiting process, Sanford
smiled and said, "We had a big
leg up before that game."
"The first time I came out
here," Sanders told the San
Francisco Chronicle recently, "I
knew this was the place I wanted
to be."

Stanford's campus and team
atmosphere are also cited by
Seale and Reynolds, who both
say that their fathers left the col
lege decision mostly up to them.
But even if the Farm is a perfect
fit for some of these recruits,
what makes so many NFL sons
the all-around student-athletes
Sanford and his staff were look
ing for?
From the start of training
camp, Shaw raved about Kodi
Whitfield's ball-catching skills
and bragged that he had picked
up the Cardinal's sophisticated
offense faster than any receiver
he had ever seen, an achieve
ment that earned Kodi playing
time in each of Stanford's first
two games.
"My old boss Jon Gruden
used to talk about hiring coach
es' sons, hiring guys who have
lived in the profession before,"
Shaw said during fall camp.
"They don't go through the highs
and lows. You can trust them
when times are hard because
they've been through it.
"There's something to be said
for players' kids, in particular,
players who went to school
here," he added. "Kodi's been on
this campus a bunch. Kodi under
stands the culture here, it's been
a goal of Kodi's to get here ...
now his dream's been realized.
So he's one of those guys that
walked onto this campus and
didn't blink."
Even those recruits who were
too young to remember their
dads' playing days have access to
a first-hand perspective on the
grueling, unpredictable life of an
NFL player. Nobody could
understand better the impor

tance of education when a career
came to an end, whether that
resulted from injury or age.
"Back when our dads were
playing it was really all about
football," Kodi said. "But now
our dads are telling us, you know,
to get an education and think
about life after football."
Their fathers' experience also
pays dividends on the playing
field. Of Stanford's 10 NFL sons,
six most notably, Sanders
play the same positions that their
fathers thrived at professionally.
Sanders admits that his dad
may have been a more explosive
back, though comparisons have
still been quick to form.
"He's just like his dad, what
do you know," was Bob
Whitfield's description of
You Tube highlights.
"There's a lot he's got to learn
about other facets of playing
football," Shaw once noted. "He
doesn't have to learn how to run
the ball."

But if certain Cardinal stand
outs demonstrate anything, it's
that growing up with a football
father can go quite a long way,

regardless of specific skill sets.
Reynolds, whose dad of the
same name played 10 NFL sea
sons, has quickly impressed as a
Cardinal safety in 2012, intercept
ing three passes in his first two
collegiate starts and returning
one of them for a 71-yard touch
down against Duke.
"I know [that me playing] was
his dream," said Reynolds, a red
shirt sophomore. "Just having
him to help my football IQ
helped me tremendously."
The Cardinal coaching staff
has noticed that players like
Reynolds, surrounded by football
from an early age, arrive with a
different kind of work ethic.
"They grew up watching the
game not just on TV, but in
person and seeing training
camp," Sanford said. "They
understand how it's supposed to
be done at the highest level."
That mental perspective is
often the most valuable thing a
former football player can pass
on to his son, especially when
physical tools are less relevant.
Seale, whose father Sam played
for 10 years as an NFL defensive
back, has watched film of his dad
before but not in search of
pointers.
"We make fun of each other,"
Seale said. "We always talk about
who is better, if I would have
played against him, if I would
beat him or he would beat me."
Ricky hasn't seen much of the
field in his two seasons, but he
often reflects on his dad's advice
to "always be ready." You could
never know when an injury
would bump you up the depth
chart the Cardinal's is espe
cially lengthy at tailback or
whether any given play would be
a big one.
"He was just going to be there
for advice," said Seale, whose dad
would only coach him for one
season. "He just always told me
that if I wanted it, he couldn't be
the one to make me do it; I have
to want it myself."
That hands-off approach, even
from a former NFL player, makes
things much easier for coaches.
"They do such a great job of
encouraging their kids, coaching
them, but also realizing that this
is their opportunity and we're

their coaches and we're going to
bring them along," Sanford said.
"And the parents tell them to lis
ten to their coaches."

Besides Sanders and
Whitfield, Stanford recruiters
would nab five others of NFL
parentage last offseason: offen
sive linemen Andrus Peat, Josh
Garnett and Nick Davidson, cor
ner and kick returner Alex
Carter and linebacker Noor
Davis.
Of the seven, Sanders is per
haps the least likely to play this
season because of the Cardinal's
depth in the backfield; regardless,
his name has attracted so much
hype that the coaching staff was
forced to cut off the media's
access to the young tailback by
the end of training camp. Shaw
joked that Sanders was the only
player being asked about more
than Josh Nunes and Brett
Nottingham, who were locked in
a fierce competition to succeed
Luck at quarterback.
Though Sanders may not play
on Saturdays in 2012, many
Stanford fans already have him
tabbed as the next great Cardinal
star. They expect him to carry the
torch that Jim Harbaugh lit, Toby
Gerhart brought to the postsea
son and Andrew Luck elevated
to two straight BCS bowls.
"[Those men] just cemented
the type of quality football that
you did not see at Stanford," Bob
Whitfield said. "You know that
your son is going to a prominent
football school, and then to have
the academics to boot just makes
it a much more special place."
It's the academics, after all,
that attract most young
prospects' parents. And if former
NFL players are any different in
that regard, it's because they
understand the value of a strong
education even better.
"After you're in it there's still
real living, and it doesn't change
things just because people know
your name," Whitfield said. "The
biggest thing is just the general
conversation [with your child] of
you've got a task at hand, you've
got opportunity in front of you.
Take advantage of that opportu
nity. Study hard, work hard, just
do all the things that you need to
do right... That comes from any
pro, where it's fourth down and
you've got to score on this last
play. You know you have to do
your assignment to be success
ful."
Sanford and his staff have
been very successful on the
recruiting trail. The seven players
of pro football progeny in this
year's incoming class outnumber
10 other Pac-12 teams' total sup
ply not just their freshmen.
Those NFL bloodlines are a
reflection of one thing: In the
football world, the Farm is trend
ing up.
"As we walk into living rooms,
the actual prospects themselves
are more excited about the foot
ball," Sanford said. "Players have
said, 'Hey, they play great foot
ball and it's a really good school,'
and in the past it was, 'This is a
great school, I'm looking for the
academics, but I've got to find the
best football fit for me.' We really
feel like we have the ability to
hopefully corner the market in
the elite academic and football
player type kids."
Sanford thinks that the biggest
factor in attracting NFL players'
sons is actually out of the hands
of the Cardinal coaching staff.
The recruiting process really
dates back to their fathers' play
ing days.
"They might have come
across a Stanford guy at one
point in their career in the NFL,
and they notice something differ
ent about those guys," he said.
"Along the way they all had a
chance to play with a Stanford
guy, and they said, 'Hey, I want
my kid to go to that place.'"
As it turns out, there's some
truth to that theory. Of the 10
NFL players whose sons now
wear cardinal and white, nine of
them that's each and every
one who stayed in the league for
more than a season once
shared an NFL locker room with
a former Cardinal.
Bob Whitfield understands
first-hand how significant that is.
"Whenever Stanford's men
tioned, it's mentioned with the
reverence of a great school," he
said of his one-time teammates.
"When they understand you're a
Stanford man, they greet you
accordingly. I always said it's
good in the film room, but they
knock down Stanford people too
on that field.
"You know, football is still
going to be football. But I think
that what happens is that people
understand that you're more than
just a football player when you
have Stanford behind you."
