## Cardinal named national football team of the week, as Taylor and Gardner nab awards 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Besides moving up to No. 9 in the
AP Poll, Stanford football has racked
up several awards since upsetting No.
2 USC 21-14 on Saturday evening.
The Cardinal (3-0,1-0 Pac-12), was
named the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl
National Team of the Week for its

effort, which put a huge damper on
the Trojans' once-high national title
hopes. Stanford has now beaten USC
(2-1,0-1) for four straight seasons.
One Cardinal player who will grad
uate without ever having lost to the
Trojans in the regular season is running
back Stepfan Taylor, who was named
the Walter Camp National Offensive
Player of the Week for his 213 all-pur
pose yards on Saturday. Taylor's 5.7
yards-per-carry was his best average

since last year's regular-season finale
against Notre Dame (5.9).
Taylor was also named the Pac
12's Offensive Player of the Week,
and is joined in that regard by junior
defensive end Ben Gardner, who
earned the corresponding defensive
award. Gardner sacked Barkley and
now leads the Cardinal with five tack
les for loss this season.
