# 2016: Reasons to join The Daily
## 
### Tom Taylor 
You're probably
feeling a little
dazed and con
fused right now.
There is so much
to do: get to know your new
dormmates, find your way
around campus (and remem
ber where that new dorm is),
learn the baffling Stanford
terminology (CoHo, TresEx,
MemAud, FloMo, etc.), work
out which clubs and societies
you want to join. And maybe
even sign up for classes.
In the face of all this, I sus
pect quite a few of you,
though you might not be
willing to admit it, are feeling
just a tinge of homesickness,
wondering if you made the
right choice in signing up for
four years on the Farm.
Don't worry, we've all
been there. Trust me, it gets
better. And yes, you made
the right decision.
If you like sports and I
suspect you probably do if
you made it this far through
The Daily and if you hap
pened to arrive on campus
last weekend, you probably
already know this.
The Pac-12 Conference
got it badly wrong this year
by scheduling Stanford's
biggest home football game
of the 2012 season before the
start of classes. But that did
n't stop a sellout crowd from
showing up, and that didn't
stop an epic contest and cele
bration as students poured
out on to the field in celebra
tion of the Card's fourth
straight fourth straight —
victory over Southern
California's football power
house, USC.
Stanford has been
arguably the best sports col
lege in the U.S. since before
most of you were born, dom
inating the Directors' Cup
for an improbable 18 straight
seasons. And the one remain
ing point in the counterargu
ment now looks well and
truly dead. Defeating a 10-
time national champion
USC's 11th was taken away
after it was found guilty of
breaking NCAA rules
five times in six years clearly
underlines the Cardinal's
credentials as a true football
school.
One of the greatest bene
fits of having your very own
SUID is that, with that hum
ble little plastic card, all of
this is yours. If you ever get
bored of an evening, all you
need to do is head across to
one of the athletics stadiums,
and with one little swipe
you'll be in the presence of
some of the best student-ath
letes out there.
I should let you in on a lit
tle secret too. If a spot in the
Red Zone or among the
Sixth Man Club doesn't sate
your appetite for live action,
you can get closer, much

closer. Don't take this entire
ly as a cheap attempt to get
you to come write for this
publication Stanford's
own radio station, KZSU, is
another good option but
here's why you should come
write for The Daily.
What did you do this
summer? Personally, I was at
the London 2012 Olympic
Games, working as a volun
teer at the beach volleyball
tournament. Interviewing
the athletes. In fact, I got to
chat with Cardinal legend
Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO, and
I was one of the first people
to talk to her USA team
mate, Misty May-Treanor,
after they won their third
straight gold medal.
There were 70,000 volun
teers in London this summer,
most of them standing out
side the venues, directing
spectators and collecting
tickets. Why did I get to
watch pretty much every
beach volleyball game and
speak to the stars? My expe
rience at The Daily.
The thing that makes
Stanford so different from a
lot of other universities is not
what you'll learn in the class
es that you take here. It's
what you'll learn outside the
classroom. Whether your
interest is science, art, politics
or even sports, you have unri
valed access to some of the
world's elite. The Dalai Lama
visited a couple of years ago,
former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair was here
last year and former
Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice is a faculty
member. Last year's No.l
pick in the NFL Draft,
Andrew Luck, called this
place home; Luca di
Montezemolo, the chairman
of Ferrari, visited a few
months ago; and David
Beckham and the L.A.
Galaxy played at Stanford
Stadium over the summer.
Journalism has nothing to
do with my major. I'm a
Ph.D. student in the
Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics. Yes, I'm a
grad student, but I've never
let that hold me back.
When you get your diplo
ma about four years from
now, Stanford will have been
what you made of it. Don't
just sit on the sidelines; sit in
the press box.

Tom Taylor forgot to warn
you that, if you become a
Daily columnist, your edi
tors get to add a cheesy con
tact line to the end of your
articles. Commiserate with

You're probably
feeling a little
dazed and con
fused right now.
There is so much
to do: get to know your new
dormmates, find your way
around campus (and remem
ber where that new dorm is),
learn the baffling Stanford
terminology (CoHo, TresEx,
MemAud, FloMo, etc.), work
out which clubs and societies
you want to join. And maybe
even sign up for classes.
In the face of all this, I sus
pect quite a few of you,
though you might not be
willing to admit it, are feeling
just a tinge of homesickness,
wondering if you made the
right choice in signing up for
four years on the Farm.
Don't worry, we've all
been there. Trust me, it gets
better. And yes, you made
the right decision.
If you like sports and I
suspect you probably do if
you made it this far through
The Daily and if you hap
pened to arrive on campus
last weekend, you probably
already know this.
The Pac-12 Conference
got it badly wrong this year
by scheduling Stanford's
biggest home football game
of the 2012 season before the
start of classes. But that did
n't stop a sellout crowd from
showing up, and that didn't
stop an epic contest and cele
bration as students poured
out on to the field in celebra
tion of the Card's fourth
straight fourth straight —
victory over Southern
California's football power
house, USC.
Stanford has been
arguably the best sports col
lege in the U.S. since before
most of you were born, dom
inating the Directors' Cup
for an improbable 18 straight
seasons. And the one remain
ing point in the counterargu
ment now looks well and
truly dead. Defeating a 10-
time national champion
USC's 11th was taken away
after it was found guilty of
breaking NCAA rules
five times in six years clearly
underlines the Cardinal's
credentials as a true football
school.
One of the greatest bene
fits of having your very own
SUID is that, with that hum
ble little plastic card, all of
this is yours. If you ever get
bored of an evening, all you
need to do is head across to
one of the athletics stadiums,
and with one little swipe
you'll be in the presence of
some of the best student-ath
letes out there.
I should let you in on a lit
tle secret too. If a spot in the
Red Zone or among the
Sixth Man Club doesn't sate
your appetite for live action,
you can get closer, much

closer. Don't take this entire
ly as a cheap attempt to get
you to come write for this
publication Stanford's
own radio station, KZSU, is
another good option but
here's why you should come
write for The Daily.
What did you do this
summer? Personally, I was at
the London 2012 Olympic
Games, working as a volun
teer at the beach volleyball
tournament. Interviewing
the athletes. In fact, I got to
chat with Cardinal legend
Kerri Walsh Jennings 'OO, and
I was one of the first people
to talk to her USA team
mate, Misty May-Treanor,
after they won their third
straight gold medal.
There were 70,000 volun
teers in London this summer,
most of them standing out
side the venues, directing
spectators and collecting
tickets. Why did I get to
watch pretty much every
beach volleyball game and
speak to the stars? My expe
rience at The Daily.
The thing that makes
Stanford so different from a
lot of other universities is not
what you'll learn in the class
es that you take here. It's
what you'll learn outside the
classroom. Whether your
interest is science, art, politics
or even sports, you have unri
valed access to some of the
world's elite. The Dalai Lama
visited a couple of years ago,
former British Prime
Minister Tony Blair was here
last year and former
Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice is a faculty
member. Last year's No.l
pick in the NFL Draft,
Andrew Luck, called this
place home; Luca di
Montezemolo, the chairman
of Ferrari, visited a few
months ago; and David
Beckham and the L.A.
Galaxy played at Stanford
Stadium over the summer.
Journalism has nothing to
do with my major. I'm a
Ph.D. student in the
Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics. Yes, I'm a
grad student, but I've never
let that hold me back.
When you get your diplo
ma about four years from
now, Stanford will have been
what you made of it. Don't
just sit on the sidelines; sit in
the press box.
