This year was supposed
to be the transition
season. Optimists
hoped Stanford would
be competitive enough
in big games and good enough in
winnable ones to end up in a solid
bowl game and keep a bit of
momentum from the Luck era.
All Stanford needed was a solid
season to keep recruits until
quarterbacks Dallas Lloyd and
Ryan Burns were ready to lead
Stanford back to glory.
Surely Stanford can't be this
good every year, can it? That's the
question the college football world
awoke to on Sunday morning,
after Stanford shocked the nation
with a 21-14 physical domination
of the No. 2 USC Trojans.
Questions that seemed completely
silly are now completely justified.
Yahoo! Sports' Pat Forde
wrote late Saturday night,
"Stanford owns [a] better foot
ball program than USC." With
four straight wins against the
Trojans in all different types of
games, it's hard to argue against
that.
After Saturday night's dra
matic win, Stanford star line
backer Shayne Skov said that
Stanford is now officially a "pow
erhouse" program. It's certainly
not easy to achieve such heights
at a great academic institution,
where many of the nation's top
recruits fall short of admission
requirements. But Stanford
appears to be on the verge, if not
already past it, of becoming the
Duke basketball of college foot
ball, the one program that can be
great every single year while
upholding the reputation of its
prestigious institution.
Coach Shaw has said that
there are probably only around
30 graduating high school foot
ball players in the country every
year who are strong enough at
both football and academics to
play Stanford football. For
Stanford to be successful, it needs
to get 20 of them, a ridiculous
success rate.
But why would any of these
kids not want to play for
Stanford? Stanford now has
everything any smart football
player could need: top-notch aca
demics, spectacular athletic facili
ties, success on the field, a clear
path to the NFL Draft and a stu
dent body that has recently
shown how supportive it can be
in both good times and bad. Ask
Andrew Luck if there's any bet
ter place to be a hero, and ask
current kicker Jordan Williamson
if there's any better place to be
when you fail. The answer is
clear: there's no place like the
Farm.

After quarterback Josh Nunes took the final kneel down, Stanford fans stormed the field to celebrate the Cardinal's fourth consecutive win over the Men of Troy, a program first. Only
the goalpoasts were safe when most of the sellout crowd of 50,360 swarmed the Stanford players and coaches in one of the loudest games in the recently renovated Stanford Stadium.

Despite the departure of star quarterback Andrew Luck, Stanford fans were quick to remind the nation that the Cardinal is here to stay at the
top of the college football world. The second-ranked Trojans were the highest ranked team to fall to Stanford since USC in 2007.
