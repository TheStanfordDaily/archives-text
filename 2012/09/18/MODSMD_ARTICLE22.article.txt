This year was supposed
to be the transition
season. Optimists
hoped Stanford would
be competitive enough
in big games and good enough in
winnable ones to end up in a solid
bowl game and keep a bit of
momentum from the Luck era.
All Stanford needed was a solid
season to keep recruits until
quarterbacks Dallas Lloyd and
Ryan Burns were ready to lead
Stanford back to glory.
Surely Stanford can't be this
good every year, can it? That's the
question the college football world
awoke to on Sunday morning,
after Stanford shocked the nation
with a 21-14 physical domination
of the No. 2 USC Trojans.
Questions that seemed completely
silly are now completely justified.
Yahoo! Sports' Pat Forde
wrote late Saturday night,
"Stanford owns [a] better foot
ball program than USC." With
four straight wins against the
Trojans in all different types of
games, it's hard to argue against
that.
After Saturday night's dra
matic win, Stanford star line
backer Shayne Skov said that
Stanford is now officially a "pow
erhouse" program. It's certainly
not easy to achieve such heights
at a great academic institution,
where many of the nation's top
recruits fall short of admission
requirements. But Stanford
appears to be on the verge, if not
already past it, of becoming the
Duke basketball of college foot
ball, the one program that can be
great every single year while
upholding the reputation of its
prestigious institution.
Coach Shaw has said that
there are probably only around
30 graduating high school foot
ball players in the country every
year who are strong enough at
both football and academics to
play Stanford football. For
Stanford to be successful, it needs
to get 20 of them, a ridiculous
success rate.
But why would any of these
kids not want to play for
Stanford? Stanford now has
everything any smart football
player could need: top-notch aca
demics, spectacular athletic facili
ties, success on the field, a clear
path to the NFL Draft and a stu
dent body that has recently
shown how supportive it can be
in both good times and bad. Ask
Andrew Luck if there's any bet
ter place to be a hero, and ask
current kicker Jordan Williamson
if there's any better place to be
when you fail. The answer is
clear: there's no place like the
Farm.

After quarterback Josh Nunes took the final kneel down, Stanford fans stormed the field to celebrate the Cardinal's fourth consecutive win over the Men of Troy, a program first. Only
the goalpoasts were safe when most of the sellout crowd of 50,360 swarmed the Stanford players and coaches in one of the loudest games in the recently renovated Stanford Stadium.

Despite the departure of star quarterback Andrew Luck, Stanford fans were quick to remind the nation that the Cardinal is here to stay at the
top of the college football world. The second-ranked Trojans were the highest ranked team to fall to Stanford since USC in 2007.


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Stanford students and players celebrated together on the field
following an improbable 21-14 upset victory over heavily favored
USC. The Cardinal flag waved proudly to "Hail, Stanford Hail."


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Stanford dominated USC in the running game, outgaining the Trojans
202-26. The Cardinal secondary also held Matt Barkley in check,
giving up 254 yards through the air and no TDs, picking him off twice.

Captain outside linebacker Chase Thomas and defensive end Ben
Gardner were part of the Herculean front seven that held USC's potent
offense scoreless for the final 41:19 of Stanford's 21-14 victory.
spread across the country. In
2012, Stanford pulled in six of the
nation's top 150 recruits accord
ing to ESPNU, including what
many are calling the best offen
sive line recruiting class in col
lege football history. Not only did
this help Stanford immensely
recruits Andrus Peat, Kyle
Murphy and Joshua Garnett are
already seeing quality playing
time this season but Peat and
Murphy were USC's two biggest
offensive line recruiting targets
in 2012, and Stanford plucked
them away.

Stanford only pulled in seven
top-150 recruits in the previous
three years combined, with stars
like Toby Gerhart, Andrew Luck
and coach Jim Harbaugh pulling
recruits to the Farm. Now, with
Saturday's win over USC in front
of many recruits watching on
national television and some
more in person, Stanford showed
even more promise as a program.
It's important not to minimize
the task still at hand for the
Cardinal the rest of this season.
Recruits cannot permanently
commit until after the 2012 season
ends. If Stanford struggles down
the stretch in a post-USC upset
hangover, the program could take
a step back. However, if Stanford
can string together wins and stay
relevant on a national stage for an

unprecedented third straight sea
son, even the biggest doubters will
start to realize that college foot
ball's eyes will be focused on the
rolling foothills of Stanford, Calif.,
for a few weeks every single year.
When you thank Harbaugh,
Gerhart and Luck for that, don't
forget to include the graduating
class of 2013, which will forever
be known as the first in the histo
ry of Stanford football to defeat
USC all four seasons. And based
on the program's momentum
right now, it's hard to believe
2013 will be the last.

Sam Fisher is hoping for at least
four more years of the Cardinal
beating the Trojans. Let him know
how long you think the streak will
go at safisher@stanford.edu.
