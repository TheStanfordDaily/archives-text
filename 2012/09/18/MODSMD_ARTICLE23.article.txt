Stepfan Taylor: It all starts and
ends with Stanford's workhorse.
Taylor was everything you could
ask for and more against USC. He
provided the big plays with a
game-tying touchdown on the
ground, another score through the
air and the consistent ground-and
pound to wear down the Trojans at
the end. His 213 total yards of
offense to go with a pair of TDs
had fans on both sides forgetting

about Andrew Luck.

Josh Mauro: The backup defensive
end saw most of his action at nose
tackle in the second half, where he
completely took over the ball
game. Mauro dominated USC
backup center Cyrus Hobbi all
half to provide the key pressure up
the middle from the defensive line
that kept Matt Barkley rattled.
The rest of the D-line played great
in support, but Mauro went above
and beyond the call of duty to help
