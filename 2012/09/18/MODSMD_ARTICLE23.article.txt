# Handing out the USC game balls

### SAM FISHER FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Stepfan Taylor: It all starts and
ends with Stanford's workhorse.
Taylor was everything you could
ask for and more against USC. He
provided the big plays with a
game-tying touchdown on the
ground, another score through the
air and the consistent ground-and
pound to wear down the Trojans at
the end. His 213 total yards of
offense to go with a pair of TDs
had fans on both sides forgetting

about Andrew Luck.

Josh Mauro: The backup defensive
end saw most of his action at nose
tackle in the second half, where he
completely took over the ball
game. Mauro dominated USC
backup center Cyrus Hobbi all
half to provide the key pressure up
the middle from the defensive line
that kept Matt Barkley rattled.
The rest of the D-line played great
in support, but Mauro went above
and beyond the call of duty to help

Stanford defensive lineman Josh Mauro put the pressure on USC's
Matt Barkley. Mauro was relentleses in the second half as Stanford's
defense completely shut down Barkley and his touted wide receivers.

seal the win.

The secondary: I tried to pick one
guy, but I just couldn't do it. All
the way down to the sixth defen
sive back, Ronnie Harris, who
made a potentially game-saving
pass breakup of a Barkley pass to
Soma Vainuku, this unit played at
a championship level. Two key
interceptions of Matt Barkley
and no touchdown passes
allowed is a great day against the
Trojans.

Josh Nunes: He certainly didn't

earn it in the first half, but the
Stanford signal caller fought
through tremendous adversity to
pull off an improbable second
half comeback. With most of the
press and fan base calling for a
switch to Brett Nottingham at
halftime, Nunes began the turn
around with his feet on a nimble
12-yard scramble to pick up a key
first down on third and long.
After that, Nunes completely
changed, looking more comfort
able in the pocket than at any
point this season. If he can con
tinue to play like he did in the
fourth quarter, Stanford has a
chance to hoist the crystal foot
ball on Jan. 7 in South Beach.
