## The 						winding road ahead 
### SAM FISHER FOOTBALL EDITOR 
Andrew Luck may be gone,
but with Saturday night's win
over USC, the Stanford
Cardinal put itself in position to
achieve beyond the path paved
by number 12. You heard right:
though there's plenty of work
left to do, this 2012 Stanford
team showed that it is capable of
playing at a national champi
onship level.
Though Stanford survived
one of its toughest tests in the
gauntlet that is the BCS
National Championship elimi
nator, the road to Miami 2013 is
no walk in the park. The tough
est challenges remaining on the
schedule are games at Notre
Dame, Oregon and UCLA, all
of whom are currently ranked in
the top 20. The next two games,
at Washington and then at home
against Arizona, are no
pushovers either. And as
Stanford has showed top
ranked opponents in years past,
any team on the Cardinal's
schedule has the potential for a
magical upset.
From Stanford's current van
tage point, there are three paths
the rest of the season could take.
Door Number One leads to The
Promised Land, a berth in the
BCS National Championship
Game. In all likelihood, because
Stanford is not named Alabama
or LSU, the Cardinal will have
to win out to earn a trip to South
Beach, including wins at No. 3
Oregon and a potential rematch
against USC for the Pac-12 title.

For Stanford to even think
about returning to the site of its
2011 Orange Bowl beat down of
Virginia Tech, Josh Nunes will
have to build off his fourth
quarter success against USC to
play at a higher level consistent
ly. From the 12-yard scramble on
third-and-10 on, Nunes was
good enough to win a champi
onship. USC's defense is
nowhere near a pushover, so
Jordan Williamson's 0-3 kicking
night is also a major concern.
With the way the Stanford
defense played against USC
over the last 41 minutes
Saturday night, a national cham
pionship isn't completely out of
the question, but it's still not the
most likely ending to 2012.
Waiting behind Door
Number Two for Stanford is a
trip to a BCS bowl for the third
straight season. Stanford has a bit
more wiggle room to get back to
the BCS, thanks to a strong
strength of schedule. However,
the path is anything but straight
forward. One thing we do know
is that if Stanford can win the
Pac-12, the Rose Bowl becomes
the worst-case scenario. To get
there, Stanford almost certainly
has to win at Oregon on Nov. 17,
one of the toughest tasks in all of
college football.
If Stanford can't beat the
Ducks, a BCS bowl remains a
legitimate possibility. Stanford is
still struggling to shake the rep
utation of not having a big
enough fan base to get bowls
excited, so grabbing an at-large
selection to the BCS won't be
easy. Still, as Stanford showed in

the last two seasons, beating
everyone on the schedule except
for Oregon is probably good
enough to warrant a top-four
BCS ranking and an automatic
bid to a BCS game.
Door Number Three is the
disappointment, the setback, the
wasted opportunity. Stanford
put itself in a remarkable posi
tion with its win over the sec
ond-ranked Trojans. However, if
the Card regresses to San Jose
State-game form at any point, it
is primed to be upset a few
times. It might not even take
that bad of a performance, as
Stanford has five teams left on
its schedule in the AP Top 25,
including road games at No. 3
Oregon, No. 11 Notre Dame and
No. 19 UCLA. If Stanford loses
more than two games, it will in
all likelihood end up in a sec
ond-tier bowl game for the first
time since the 2009 season,
when Stanford lost a close game
to Oklahoma in the Sun Bowl.
There is obviously tremen
dous uncertainty as to where the
rest of the season heads, but it's
truly remarkable for Stanford to
be in the position it is in now. No
Toby Gerhart, no Jim Harbaugh
and no Andrew Luck; just Josh
Nunes, Stepfan Taylor, a rabid
defense and a whole bunch of
guys showing a lot of heart. The
superstar names might be gone,
but the talent left behind is ris
ing to the top, making Door
Number One not so crazy to
think about.

ond-tier bowl game for the first
time since the 2009 season,
when Stanford lost a close game
to Oklahoma in the Sun Bowl.
There is obviously tremen
dous uncertainty as to where the
rest of the season heads, but it's
truly remarkable for Stanford to
be in the position it is in now. No
Toby Gerhart, no Jim Harbaugh
and no Andrew Luck; just Josh
Nunes, Stepfan Taylor, a rabid
defense and a whole bunch of
guys showing a lot of heart. The
superstar names might be gone,
but the talent left behind is ris

Number One not so crazy to
think about.

Andrew Luck may be gone,
but with Saturday night's win
over USC, the Stanford
Cardinal put itself in position to
achieve beyond the path paved
by number 12. You heard right:
though there's plenty of work
left to do, this 2012 Stanford
team showed that it is capable of
playing at a national champi
onship level.
Though Stanford survived
one of its toughest tests in the
gauntlet that is the BCS
National Championship elimi
nator, the road to Miami 2013 is
no walk in the park. The tough
est challenges remaining on the
schedule are games at Notre
Dame, Oregon and UCLA, all
of whom are currently ranked in
the top 20. The next two games,
at Washington and then at home
against Arizona, are no
pushovers either. And as
Stanford has showed top
ranked opponents in years past,
any team on the Cardinal's
schedule has the potential for a
magical upset.
From Stanford's current van
tage point, there are three paths
the rest of the season could take.
Door Number One leads to The
Promised Land, a berth in the
BCS National Championship
Game. In all likelihood, because
Stanford is not named Alabama
or LSU, the Cardinal will have
to win out to earn a trip to South
Beach, including wins at No. 3
Oregon and a potential rematch
against USC for the Pac-12 title.

For Stanford to even think
about returning to the site of its
2011 Orange Bowl beat down of
Virginia Tech, Josh Nunes will
have to build off his fourth
quarter success against USC to
play at a higher level consistent
ly. From the 12-yard scramble on
third-and-10 on, Nunes was
good enough to win a champi
onship. USC's defense is
nowhere near a pushover, so
Jordan Williamson's 0-3 kicking
night is also a major concern.
With the way the Stanford
defense played against USC
over the last 41 minutes
Saturday night, a national cham
pionship isn't completely out of
the question, but it's still not the
most likely ending to 2012.
Waiting behind Door
Number Two for Stanford is a
trip to a BCS bowl for the third
straight season. Stanford has a bit
more wiggle room to get back to
the BCS, thanks to a strong
strength of schedule. However,
the path is anything but straight
forward. One thing we do know
is that if Stanford can win the
Pac-12, the Rose Bowl becomes
the worst-case scenario. To get
there, Stanford almost certainly
has to win at Oregon on Nov. 17,
one of the toughest tasks in all of
college football.
If Stanford can't beat the
Ducks, a BCS bowl remains a
legitimate possibility. Stanford is
still struggling to shake the rep
utation of not having a big
enough fan base to get bowls
excited, so grabbing an at-large
selection to the BCS won't be
easy. Still, as Stanford showed in

the last two seasons, beating
everyone on the schedule except
for Oregon is probably good
enough to warrant a top-four
BCS ranking and an automatic
bid to a BCS game.
Door Number Three is the
disappointment, the setback, the
wasted opportunity. Stanford
put itself in a remarkable posi
tion with its win over the sec
ond-ranked Trojans. However, if
the Card regresses to San Jose
State-game form at any point, it
is primed to be upset a few
times. It might not even take
that bad of a performance, as
Stanford has five teams left on
its schedule in the AP Top 25,
including road games at No. 3
Oregon, No. 11 Notre Dame and
No. 19 UCLA. If Stanford loses
more than two games, it will in
all likelihood end up in a sec
ond-tier bowl game for the first
time since the 2009 season,
when Stanford lost a close game
to Oklahoma in the Sun Bowl.
There is obviously tremen
dous uncertainty as to where the
rest of the season heads, but it's
truly remarkable for Stanford to
be in the position it is in now. No
Toby Gerhart, no Jim Harbaugh
and no Andrew Luck; just Josh
Nunes, Stepfan Taylor, a rabid
defense and a whole bunch of
