## A 						GLANCE AT HISTORY Examining the last six showdowns of the Stanford-USC rivalry since the "Biggest Upset Ever" 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford 24, No. 2 USC 23
LA Memorial Coliseum, Oct. 6,2007
"The Biggest Upset Ever"
In 2006, after recording its worst ever Pac-10 season
in school history, ending the year 1-11 and losing start
ing quarterback T.C. Ostrander to injury, the Cardinal
was expected to be crushed by the Trojans. They were a
41-point underdog.
Improbably, Stanford's defense kept it within range
of USC into the fourth quarter. When backup quarter
back Tavita Pritchard found wide receiver Mark
Bradford in the end zone on fourth-and-goal, when
kicker Derek Belch added the extra point and when
free safety Bo McNally intercepted a USC pass in the
final minute. Southern California's national champi
onship dreams were cut short, marking the beginning of
a difficult six years for the Trojans.

Stanford Stadium, Nov. 15,2008
The Trojans exacted sweet revenge a year later. With
the game tied 17-17 going into the second half after a
late USC kickoff return, it seemed as if Pritchard's
Cardinal could pull off yet another major upset, but
USC had learned from the previous year's pain. Though
Stanford again recorded the very last score of the game,

by then victory had already been firmly secured with
three Trojan touchdowns in the fourth quarter.

No. 25 Stanford 55, No. 11 USC 21
LA Memorial Coliseum, Nov. 14,2009
This year was the start of the rivalry between
Andrew Luck and Matt Barkley, now a USC senior, but
the 2009 season, and this game, was all about Stanford
running back Toby Gerhart. He carried the ball 29
times, rushing for 178 yards and scoring three touch
downs. Returning the punishment doled out by USC in
the fourth quarter in 2008, Stanford went one better
with four scores in the final period. Then-coach Jim
Harbaugh infamously went for two to run up the score
on the once-powerhouse Trojans and dealt USC its
worst home defeat since 1966. The Cardinal's 55 points
were the most ever scored against a USC team, though
Stanford would break its own record in the Coliseum
two years later.

No. 16 Stanford 37, USC 35
Stanford Stadium, Oct. 9,2010
The two teams traded blows throughout this game,
and after a USC touchdown with 1:12 remaining, it
was only a single missed extra point by Stanford kick
er Nate Whitaker that gave USC the edge. But this
was now firmly Luck's Cardinal and, armed with one
minute and two timeouts, Luck drove down the field
to give Whitaker a chance to nail a redeeming 30-

yard field and send the Trojans home empty-handed
again.

No. 4 Stanford 56, No. 20 USC 48
LA Memorial Coliseum, Oct. 29,2011
Making the difficult decision to forgo a certain
No.l pick in the NFL Draft, Luck returned for his
senior year on the Farm. After throwing a pick-six
late in the fourth quarter to give USC a seven-point
advantage, Luck had 3:08 to get Stanford out of its
self-imposed rut. He lived up to expectations, the
Card taking the game into an epic triple-overtime
and yet again denying Barkley victory when USC's
Curtis McNeal, then a junior, fumbled in the end
zone.

No. 21 Stanford 21, No. 2 USC 14
Stanford Stadium, Sept. 15,2012
After Stanford graduated its star quarterback, and
after it struggled against San Jose State in the opening
game of the season, many were expecting Heisman
Trophy candidate Barkley to finally end his drought
against his rival to the north. The Card, though, had
other ideas, and recovered from mistakes in the first half
to upset the Trojans and put a serious dent in their
hopes of both a national title and a Heisman for
Barkley.
