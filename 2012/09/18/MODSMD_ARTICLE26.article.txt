## MAKER'S TAKE JOHNSON & GORDON-LEVITT EXPLAIN FILM 
### â€“ sasha ARIJANTO contact sasha: sasha.arijanto@stanford. edu 
In "Looper," this year's dose of existen
tial quandary set to science fiction aes
thetics, Rian Johnson ("Brick," "The
Brothers Bloom") directs Joseph Gordon-
Levitt as one version of Joe, an assassin
who finds himself marked to kill or be
killed by his older self, played by Bruce
Willis. The multi-faceted experiment in
genre tackles themes as multifarious as the

corners of the human psyche, and
Intermission was lucky enough to pick the
brains of director Rian Johnson and actor
Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Here the two reflect
on just a sampling of the questions
"Looper" raises.

On moral ambiguity
Joseph Gordon-Levitt (JGL): Joe's not a

hero; he's sort of a lost soul and low on the
totem poll making his money. I like that
about him, that at the center of an action
movie is not a particularly admirable guy.
There aren't really good guys and bad
guys in "Looper," and I like that 'cause I

think in real life there aren't really
good guys and bad guys. Even
though it can be fun in a movie
to root for the heroes and the vil
lains, in real life I don't think any
one is black and white; everyone's
some shade of gray, and I think
it's particularly intriguing to cast
Bruce in that light. We're used to
seeing him as a hero, and every
one thinks that they're doing the
right thing. And I love that
because that's how human beings
really operate.
On identity and self-suppression
JGL: I studied [Bruce Willis] and
watched his movies and ripped
the audio off of his movies so I
could listen on repeat. He even
recorded some of my voiceover
monologues and sent me the
recordings so I could hear what
they would sound like in his
voice. Letting it seep in is a really
fascinating way to create a charac
ter and become somebody else.
That's always my favorite thing, is
to transform, become somebody
else, and if I watch a movie and I
see a moment that reminds me of
myself I always feel that I messed
that up. I want to see somebody
different. The premise of
"Looper" really poses a unique
challenge in that way, and I had to
really transform. "Looper" is the
most transformative of any movie
I've ever done.
On challenging
JGL; [Rian] really is one of my
dearest friends in the world. So to
get to work with someone that's
your friend like that is rare, and a
pleasure. It just makes it fun.
Obviously there's differences
between "Brick" and this one.
["Looper"] is a much bigger-scale
movie, and he and I have both
grown and done a lot of other
things. But I think the similarities
are more striking than the differ
ences. Even though this is a big
action sci-fi movie, we still were
just making something we
thought would be cool. There was
never any desire to cater the story
to commercial market research
nonsense. And that's a real testa
ment to him, that he just tells the
story that he wants to tell because
he would want to. He never talks
down to his audience. Speaking of

Chris [Nolan, director of the
recent Batman trilogy], that's
something they have in common,
Rian and Chris. They never talk
down to their audience and
they're never afraid to challenge
their audience, and I think that's a
big part of why people love
Chris's movies and a big part of
why people will love "Looper."

On time travel
JGL: It's pretty simple, the time
travel in "Looper." It's a movie
that uses time travel, but it's not
about time travel. And I like that.
Most of my favorite sci-fi is that
way. It can be fun to watch the
sci-fi movies that are more about
the shiny objects, but I think the
best sci-fi for me is the stuff that
uses it as a springboard to get at
the really basic human questions.
A lot like "The Dark Knight
Rises" is a drama it's a super
hero movie but it's ultimately a
drama "Looper" too is a sci-fi
movie but it's ultimately a drama.
It's about what you would say to
your future self if you could have
that conversation. And obviously
that can't happen in real life, so
Rian uses the genre of sci-fi and
the device of time travel to dram
atize that question. That's really
its place, and beyond that it really
gets out of the way.
Rian Johnson (RJ): The model I
really looked to was "Terminator."
Especially the first that movie
is so deft with its use of time trav
el it's easy to forget it's a time
travel movie, and that's a great
example of how time travel lights
the fuse and then steps back. The
situation time travel has created is
what drives the film until the end.
I'm a big sci-fi fan myself.
I'm a big time travel nerd; I love
time travel movies. I didn't want
to use those marching orders to
myself as an excuse to be lazy
with the time travel element of it.
I did spend quite a bit of time
coming up with what my rules
were for how the universe dealt
with time travel paradoxes and
what the particular logic of this
was gonna be and coming up
with a system that was very I
cant say it makes sense; no time
travel movie makes sense if you
look hard enough at it but that
was a consistent set of rules that

we stuck to for it. And then it was
a matter of disciplining myself to
not explain those rules but to just
show the effects of them.
My hope is that even though
we don't have a chalkboard scene
where we describe the rules for 20
minutes, my hope is that if you're
really into that you can take a
look into the cause and effect,
take a look at how it plays out,
and reverse engineer and realize
there is a net underneath these of
a thought-out system."
On inspiration
RJ: There's nothing I can point to
with the directness the way that
[author Dashiell] Hammett was
to "Brick." When I wrote that
short, it was right when I discov
ered Philip K. Dick and I was in
the middle of blowing through all
of his books. My head was kind of
steamed in that. Also, in a general
sense, Bradbury for me, as the
master of that thing that I love
the most about sci-fi where it
uses a concept like this, it uses this
kind of magical construct of this
phony technology of time travel
to amplify a very human emotion
or very human theme to get to
something that's going to leave
you crying at the end of it.
One movie I studied that I
owe more to this movie than to
any science fiction is "Witness"
with Harrison Ford. That movie is
just masterful the way it keeps the
tension up even when they get to
the farm. I studied and dia
grammed that script and tried to
figure out how they did it.
On the future
RJ: There's no cushion, there's no
middle class you either have
your stack of silver or it's straight
to the bottom of dangerous desti
tution."
JGL: That's that endless cycle that
the movie's describing. If every
one just looks out for themselves
you sort of get this perpetual
loop, everyone pointing fingers
and everyone blaming each other
and everyone killing each other,
and it takes an act of selflessness
to break that.
