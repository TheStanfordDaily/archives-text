Fpom what might certainly be one of the
best-spliced trailers of 2012/ the sum
mer/all time, moviegoers might expect
from director Rian Johnsons latest, "Looper," a
mind-bending, time-traveling bounty hunt
wherein a Bruce Willis version of a main char
acter aims to kill a Joseph Gordon-I.evitt ver
sion of said main character (or vice versa?).
Mix in some Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels, club
scenes and dub-step, and the stage of cinemat

Indeed, the viewer would expect the
action slash sci-fi slash existential mindluck

would happily see what presents itself as a
quality but stock film we could contently stack
near our "Bourne," "Inception" and "Drive"
DVDs.
But just as with a disappearing act, we
watch it anyway, for the sake of the illusion, for
the craftsmanship. And it's because we know
what we can expect that we find ourselves
delightfully unsettled by the routine the magi

"Looper," Rian Johnson has managed to wave
the cloth of magical time travel over genre
bending sci-fi fixtures to produce a maturely
novel version of a stoiy old as Eden.
In the nearish fixture 0f2044 (just
aroxxnd this writers 30th Stanford reunion), a
yoxxng Joe (Gordon-Levitt) stacks his silver by
killing future bodies thrown back in time by
the mob. There's not much hunting; thanks to
the time-transcending technology, Joe spends
the assassination portion of his Looper life
pointing a never-failing blunderbuss at his
marks like a kid knocking off bulls-eyed
ducks at the county fair. With a Bazooka. Little
more than fish in a barrel until events conspire
to place old Joe (Willis) before young Joe's
