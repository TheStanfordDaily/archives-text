# LOOPER: JOURNEY IN TIME, GENRE

Fpom what might certainly be one of the
best-spliced trailers of 2012/ the sum
mer/all time, moviegoers might expect
from director Rian Johnsons latest, "Looper," a
mind-bending, time-traveling bounty hunt
wherein a Bruce Willis version of a main char
acter aims to kill a Joseph Gordon-I.evitt ver
sion of said main character (or vice versa?).
Mix in some Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels, club
scenes and dub-step, and the stage of cinemat
ic expectations has been set.
Indeed, the viewer would expect the
action slash sci-fi slash existential mindluck
that the 'Tooper" trailer would imply, and she
would happily see what presents itself as a
quality but stock film we could contently stack
near our "Bourne," "Inception" and "Drive"
DVDs.
But just as with a disappearing act, we
watch it anyway, for the sake of the illusion, for
the craftsmanship. And it's because we know
what we can expect that we find ourselves
delightfully unsettled by the routine the magi
cian suspends before us. In the case of
"Looper," Rian Johnson has managed to wave
the cloth of magical time travel over genre
bending sci-fi fixtures to produce a maturely
novel version of a stoiy old as Eden.
In the nearish fixture 0f2044 (just
aroxxnd this writers 30th Stanford reunion), a
yoxxng Joe (Gordon-Levitt) stacks his silver by
killing future bodies thrown back in time by
the mob. There's not much hunting; thanks to
the time-transcending technology, Joe spends
the assassination portion of his Looper life
pointing a never-failing blunderbuss at his
marks like a kid knocking off bulls-eyed
ducks at the county fair. With a Bazooka. Little
more than fish in a barrel until events conspire
to place old Joe (Willis) before young Joe's
blunderbuss, and the hunt is set into
motion.

The film's unexpected plot—
rightfully unspoiled by that trailer and
this writer —lays it on thick, and the
neat yet complex story wraps itself in
a surprisingly uplifting package.
Gordon-Levitt, that chameleon boy
wonder, slips into Joe, a morally
ambiguous but ultimately likable
anti-hero, in away that has us won
dering if our beloved JGL was in the
film at all —and not just because he
looks strikingly like Bruce Willis.
Johnson credits Gordon-Levitt's
eerily apt performance of a young
Old Joe to his mimetic study of an
older Willis, using "Sin City" rather
than the first "Die Hard." Guarding
himself from the audience like his
character from his pursuers, Brace
Willis strikes his balance between
dramatist and action star. The result is
two Joes, the same character(s) sepa
rated by time and life experiences,
who play different because they are,
even if they aren't.
Emily Blunt, one of three
women in the film—all strong, inde
pendent and more or less disposable
gives an adequate but forgettable
performance, which speaks more to
the film's story than to Blunt's ability.
Blunt's Sarah echoes Johnson's writ
ing, which draws women faithful to
their form but confined to a singular
angle. The women, all unequivocally
good, stand starkly against the men,
who as Gordon-Levitt describes are
neither good nor bad. Indeed, the
viewer relishes that queasy uncertain
ty of who we ought root for.
Jolinson's treatment of action
thankfully mirrors that of time travel;
"Looper" is "a movie that uses time
travel, but it's not about time travel,"
Johnson says. What creeps into the
critical mind for movies like "Shutter
Island," "The Dark Knight Rises" and
even the anointed "Inception"—the
need for an explanation of technical
details we know are not real or possi
ble or sanely reasonable but distract
and frustrate us anyway — flutter
away in the case of "Looper."
Johnson's "Looper," he claims, has a
rule that a vigilant viewer could con
struct despite the deliberate lack of a
chalkboard scene that explains the
mechanics of time travel. But we
don't care. We willingly suspend our
disbelief to accept the magic of
"Looper" because we want to be
fooled, just this once. And it is per
haps the ambiguity, the impossibility
of the space-time continuum that
imbues a sense of faith into... no
spoilers!
But even with great acting, a
fresh story and some stunning visu
als, the real prestige of Johnson's
magical display is the deftness with
wfiich he gets around somewhat tired
themes in a carousel of genres each
taking the stage, passing through the
projector's light without drawing
attention way from those other daz
zling pieces. As in "Brick" and "The
Brothers Bloom," archetypal genres
mix together in a smooth pastiche of
film noir, spaghetti Western, sci-fi and
mob movie in such away that has us
wondering not why it hasn't been
done before it has —but why
these genres aren't all the same any
way.
And in that way each genre
complements the next, airs out their
differences and injects life into what
very well may have been an uninspir
ing script under the thumb of any
other director.
At the heart of "Looper" is a
philosophical question cheapened by
ambitious blockbusters and bela
bored by effete art films. Instantly
appealing and unrelenting in its abili
ty to conjure genuine contemplation,
introspection and—gasp! moral
consideration, "Looper" will win our
thumbs up and settle in to our deep
places of film favorites.
