# TOP 5
## Top 5 NSO Checkpoints 
### 
On a scale from transfer to coterm/Ph.D./future professor, how
much do you love Stanford already? Don't worry if you're still
not sure about your roommate or you think all the buildings
look the same (they do!). You've got time, an iStanford app and
Intermission to guide you on your collegiate journey of self-dis
covery and cultural delights. First on the menu are a few places
you should definitely check out during NSO. Go forth and frol
ic in an IntroSem. Dally in GERs. You'll never be as free as
freshman year.

LAKE LAGUNITA
If you like lakes but aren't a fan of water, this lake is just for
you! Just venture out into the middle of Lag, and if you're
lucky, you might score a spot on one of the resident lawn
chairs. But if you're feeling adventurous, check out the trail that
goes around the perimeter. It's a popular place to go jogging,
walking or just to check out on a nice late-summer afternoon.

THE TERMAN ENGINEERING CENTER
FOUNTAIN
No doubt you'll find this fountain sometime during your foun
tain-hopping adventures, but do take some time to come back
when you aren't running around in your swimsuit trying not to
get separated from the rest of the group or falling on your face
(it's shallower than it looks!) while it's dark outside and you
have very little grasp on the geography of the campus.
Venturing back to this fountain during the day may mean less
fountain hopping-related squealing and more relaxation/Zen
time for you.

CEMEX AUDITORIUM
One step into the Knight Management Center (the business
school) and you will know why we took econ. The Wall of
Flipping Colors, or its official title, "Monument to Change," is
really too cool not to check out.

THE BENDER ROOM
180-degree views of campus, photos of other libraries, fine
mahogany and leather bound books the Bender Room is like
a dream. Don't wait until you're too bogged down with p-sets
and papers to check out these sweet digs. Heck, bite the bullet
and learn your way around the libraries! Just don't go to the
South Stacks at night alone. Unless you're with a squeeze, in
which case that's totally romantic/adventurous/not creepy.

FROSHIE'S CHOICE

You're new on campus take some initiative! Explore cam
pus, find your new favorite dive and make friends! During
Admit Weekend and NSO you spend most of your time laying
the foundation for the next four years at Stanford. The
moment when you finally see the start of your adventure
free from the confines and chaos of move-in, learning your
dorm chants, all the NSO activities and trying to remember if
you have your key on you is probably one you will remem
ber fondly.
