## "Breaking Bad" for Frosh 
### â€“ alex KENNEDY contact alex: alexjk@stanford. edu 
So you got into Stanford
think you're hot shit, right?
Well, with Tuco breathing
down your neck, a pregnant wife
nagging you and a narc in the fami
ly, think you'll still make it to office
hours? Okay, yeah so this is a
metaphor, but we've all got skele
tons in the basement!
In four and a half seasons of
some of the best meth drama we've
ever seen, Intermission has collected
five ripe tips for navigating fresh
man year, as told by "Breaking
Bad." And remember, Rome wasn't
built in a day, but that shouldn't
keep you from the empire business!
If you haven't jumped on the
AMC train, spoilers follow. Also, go
buy a Netflix account it's going
to be a long four years.
Don't buy everything from the
same place!
Walt and lesse know better
than to buy all their sudo, tubes and
beakers at the same hardware store,
and so should you! After several

over-scheduled days of NSO and
the madness of finally enrolling in
classes, you may be itching to hit
the bookstore and stock up on
expensive college-y lookin' text
books. Alternatively, you may have
realized all the essential things you
forgot, and desperately need to buy
socks. Sweet as those Stanford socks
are, think twice before adding them
to your already-overflowing basket
during your two-hour shopping
spree at the campus bookstore.
Buying everything at the bookstore
doesn't make you look sketchy or
guilty of cooking meth, but it does
make you look like a wide-eyed
freshman. We hear Amazon has free
shipping.
It's a very, very small world (at
Stanford).
You know how every time
something suspicious is in sight,
Hank is in the room and on his A
game for spotting trouble? Stanford
feels big and sprawling at first, but
you'll soon find that you see a lot of

the same people... all of the time.
No biggie, until you alienate or
antagonize people in your dorm,
classes, etc. Because PWR girl has a
way of showing up in all your
future sections. Or worse rush!
Seek Amish hat as disguise?
Don't be afraid to do things a little
differently than whatever's in
vogue.
When Walt realized that gath
ering sudo was the bottleneck slow
ing down the entire operation,
what'd he do? He switched to a
sudo-free cook and created the infa
mous blue meth! Can you say game
changer? So take that philosophy
seminar that you're nerding out
over or dabble in programming if
computers scare you... it could be
the beginning of your very own
empire!
Don't change something about
yourself just for the sake of change.

"Breaking Bad" stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, with a tad more cash than the average freshman.
You're starting college, which IS a
big life change, and doesn't need an
extra dramatic change to mark the
occasion. In short, don't ask people
to call you Flynn if your name is
Walter Jr. And the high-school-to
college drink exchange rate is the
same, so know your limit! Don't go
puking in anybody's pool just to
prove yourself to your bros.
Related side note: tattoo removal
exists but is still super painful.
Learn from your experiences, espe
cially with people.
Learn to trust new people and
be open to really getting to know
them, a la Walter and former
hoodrat-turned-surrogate-son
Jesse. On the other hand, learn
from your mistakes ... you should
only have to deal with one Tuco to
determine that crazies are not your
scene!

Bad," "The Wire" and "True
