Kanye West, Common and Lupe Fiasco
the Windy City's three biggest rap
names of the last 10 years. However,
the Chicago superstars of the last decade may
soon be getting some company in the hip
hop spotlight. Over the last three years,
Chicago rapper Rockie Fresh has emerged
out of the woodwork, making waves in the
music industry with a more alternative
approach to rap.
Hailing from the South Side of Chicago,
Donald Pullen was dubbed with the stage
name "Rockie Fresh" by his friends during
lunch-hour freestyle sessions at his local high
school. After dropping two mixtapes in 2009,
Pullen began to gain some recognition in the
hip-hop community, landing performances
with Rick Ross, Big Sean and Twister. After
continued success with his mixtapes, in July of
2012, Pullen signed with Rick Ross' music

label, Maybach Music Group.
His mixtapes provide catchy tracks and
lyrics listeners want to rap along with. Pullen
largely embraces alternative rock, going so far
as to sample Coldplay in his recent work. He
has given credit to both Fall Out Boy and
Good Charlotte for directly inspiring his musi
cal style.
This more unconventional approach to
hip-hop contributes a new dynamic to the
already well-diversified Chicago hip-hop scene.
In a city where Common and Lupe Fiasco's
prominent focus on social issues and the
extravagant and the powerful showmanship
and production quality of Kanye West can
quench fans' thirst for rap music, the entrance
of a rapper inspired by alternative rock only
seems fitting.
On Sept. 15, Pullen launched his Electric
Highway Tour, which will make its way to the

Bay Area on Sept. 26. Tickets for the San
Francisco show at 330 Ritch are currently
available online.
With promising freshman beginnings in
the rap game, listeners are eager to hear what's
in store for the emerging artist. In the coming
weeks, Intermission will be sitting down with
Pullen to hear firsthand of Rockie Fresh's plans
for the coming years.

Intermission will be giving away tickets to Rockie
Fresh's SF show and hosting a meet and greet
with the man himself. To Snd out more, check

Chi-city, where he skateboards with childhood
friends, Wendy and Roxy.
