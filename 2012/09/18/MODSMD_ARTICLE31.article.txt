Drugs and nostalgia, or "Why Harvard Will Always Be
Cooler Than Stanford." Key tracks: "Blue Thunder,"
"Tell Me," "Ceremony."

"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" — Wilco
I don't care if this album is cliche; these feels are quin
tessentially autumnal. I know of few songs that are as
simultaneously depressing, cacophonous, moving and
soothing as the album's opener, "I Am Trying to Break
Your Heart." Add in the alt-country jam "Jesus, Etc.,"
with its pedal steel, soft strings and melodic grooves,
and you've got yourself a genuine overcast autumn
afternoon fiesta. Some call it boring — plebs. "Ashes of
American Flags" and "Reservations" delve deeper into
the album's deeply contemplative feels — perfect for
afternoon tea/coffee with gf (or without, most likely).
"I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One" — Yo La
Tengo
"When I heard the knock at the door /1 couldn't catch
my breath / Is it too late to call this off?" — so begins
"Autumn Sweater," one of the highlights off Yo La
Tengo's aggressively eclectic 1997 release. The definitive
fall feels genre — '90s indie rock — materializes in its
poster child, "I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One."
Sure, it's not "In the Aeroplane Over the Sea," but we've
got to move on from listening to albums about Anne
Frank. And let's not forget the feels. This album might
have them all — the melancholy, the awkwardness, the
nervous anticipation, the blissed-out nighttime drives
with the qtpi of your dreams and the memories of
summer. Take a late-night walk around campus with
this ditty for a genuine feels frenzy. Or perhaps pour
yourself a drink or two and zone out to "Return to Hot
Chicken," "Damage," and "Green Arrow." A true fall
feels gem.
