"Vampire Weekend" Vampire
Weekend
Though it may be too late for you to
stroll through the streets of Cambridge
with a crimson cardigan draped over
your shoulder, qtpis on your arms and
freshly fallen leaves beneath your feet,
through Vampire Weekend's 2008
release, you can try, dammit. Get play
fully spunky next to the fuzzy "It's vin
tage" organ on "Campus" and
Graceland-inspired yelps on "One
(Blake's Got A New Face)" and try to
forget for a minute that you go to an
expensive, top-tier, post-secondary insti
tution situated far away from both Cape
Cod and South Africa. To fully feel the
fall feels of Vampire Weekend, clinking
g&ts on the pier with a few newfound
friends as the sunset bounces off your
pomade's sheen and "The Kids Don't
Stand A Chance" softly plays from
someone's car is recommended, but you
might have to settle for Gatorade and
vodka on the roof of Stern.

"Let It Be" — The Replacements
Unlike the identically named album by
The Beatles, you're not guaranteed to
find at least one album cover poster of
this gem by The Replacements in every
freshman dorm. With determined direc
tion, "Let It Be" immediately marks its
college-aged anti-establishmentarianism
and general grunginess with Paul
Westerberg's salt-and-pepper vocals
crooning over simple, driving drums
and a borrowed guitar that sounds like it
just crawled out of bed on the opening
track, "I Will Dare." The album's lyrical
bent centers around blue-collar love and
despair among the flannel-cloaked
younger crowd, but songs about tfw no
gf like "Unsatisfied" and "Answering

Machine" hit home with even those who
have just broken it off with a high school
beau. Best felt while not-so-discreetly
pounding a domestic brew in the green
felt-covered basement of a Duluth
Rambler. If this is not a viable option,
slumping through the Quad on a slight
ly overcast day with a jean jacket and
stale hair will suffice.
"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"
Pavement
Along with The Replacements,
Pavement is often grouped in as a heavy
weight of college rock classics. And
rightfully so both groups share feels
heavy lyrics and vocalists whose respect
for proper pitch is nearly absent.
"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" marks
Pavement's transition from the noisy
summer feels of "Slanted and
Enchanted" to the slightly more polished
sound of '9os Pacific Northwest alt rock.
Although the album keeps a pretty tradi
tional instrument and time signature
lineup, unusual bits like the spacey jaunt
through 5/4 and 6/8 time in "5-
4=Unity" keep the sleepy listener on his
toes. Best felt during sunny afternoons,
so if Bay Area rain is getting you down,
close your eyes and visualize yourself in
blond, center-parted hair on Columbae's
balcony with some nice headphones
pumping out the warbly guitar solo on
"Cut Your Hair" or the instrumental
breakdown on "Gold Soundz."

Tom is a persnickety night owl whose
music collection spans at least five media.
