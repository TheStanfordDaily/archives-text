When you freshmen realize the
Stanford Calling Center is really
just pimping you out, maybe
you, too, will have the sense or the entrepre
neurial spirit to start your own phone sex
line out of Larkin or wherever else it is you
live. Write a script about it with your room
mate and you'll be the next Katie Anne
Naylon. Naylon, who ran the sex line 1-800-
FSUTITS out of her Florida State dorm
room, called her script "For A Good Time,
Ca11..." and it finds an unlikely roommate
pairing, Katie and Lauren, operating a phone
sex line from their New York citadel when
hilarity ensues.
In the semi-autobiographical comedy
perhaps the best comedy of the summer
and at least the greatest comedy about work
ing girls since "9 to 5" Katie's part is
played by Ari Graynor, whose inebriated per
formance in "Nick and Norah's Infinite
Playlist" caught the eye of co-writer, co-star
and real life FSU roomie Lauren Anne Miller.
Intermission was lucky enough to speak with
the two riotous comediennes about this
hearty pro-chicks but not chick-flick flick.
Here, Intermission interprets Graynor
and Miller's reflections on the film as lessons
for freshmen.
It's freshman year: plan all you want but
save perfection for the senior one
Lauren Anne Miller (LAM): What's great
about comedies is finding something in
them, finding what's funny, and we do that
through improv. So a lot of these comedies
have these takes where it's long and going on
and on and on and they can find all these
funny jokes, but we did not have that luxury
[shooting in only 16 days] and had to spend
a lot of time ahead of time working on

things We didn't get more than three
takes most of the time. We had to be tight
with it... as soon as something felt good we
moved on.
Ari Graynor (AG): We wouldn't have it any
other way, but we just wouldn't do it that
way again [laughs].
Good things come from different room
mates
LAM: The most autobiographical portion of
the story is the dynamic between Katie and
Lauren. Katie and I were very different people
and we met in college. We were a random
roommate match, and she would make fun of
me because I would ask where the recycling
was, and Katie is Katie and lots of jokes and
lots of talking and whatever. So we weren't the
obvious best friends right from the very
beginning. The movie is in no way this phone
sex documentary or the real true story of
Katie running her own line. It's the backdrop
to a story about friendship and two girls fig

uring out who they are as individuals togeth
er.
AG: All of the phone sex calls and the men's
coverage that was improvised. Kevin
Smith, Seth Rogen and a lot of Justin Long's
stuff was almost completely improvised. We
sort of found this balance between this
dynamic that Lauren and I had worked on
before we got to set, trying to keep that in line
and certainly let there be room for discovery.
But in terms of the script, it was more about
letting the other people go off the rail more.
Lose yourself, but find yourself too
AG: I think every character that I play has
been an extension of myself. I recently read a
quote, I forget from who, saying that rather
than lose yourself in a character, try to find
yourself in a character. There's a lot of Katie's
spirit that I love and appreciate and think
that I have... presenting myself with a cer
tain amount of confidence but really having
that mask a lot of insecurity... and at the

same time my general life vibe is really dif
ferent from Katie.... The script that the real
Lauren and Katie had written was so smart
and so clearly drawn that it was easy to fall
into the world that they had written.

And explore your sexuality (and the
SHPRC)
AG: I think there were some by-products
that while we were working on ["For a Good
Time, Ca11... "] were certainly not the
focus, but we want to put in there that it's
important to own your sexuality and to
embrace that part of yourself as a means to
better get to know yourself. By opening
yourself up to get to [know] someone else,
you also get to know yourself better.
