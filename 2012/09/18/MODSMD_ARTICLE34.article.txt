It's freshman year: you may (likely)
fail a test. Give thanks that the
curve, and not a field test with
Judge Dredd, will determine your final
grade.
In this year's "Dredd," a remake
of the 1995 Sylvester Stallone charger,
a freshman judge named Cassandra
Anderson (Olivia Thirlby, "Juno")
eludes failure with her psychic ability
(Go to office hours) and earns a field
test with Judge Dredd, the future's
brand of judge, jury, cop, detective,
bounty hunter and on-the-spot exe
cutioner. A Rambo among badasses,
Dredd patrols a mega-city with his
psychic pupil when a routine criminal
cleanup lands the pair in the lap of a
drug queen-pin whose penchant for
violence and control over her crew
smack of the Stanford Prison
Experiment (Do some psych studies).
Lena Headey plays this ex-hook
er drug lady, Ma-Ma, with a heart of

coal and a hatefulness equal in kind
but greater in degree than her role as
Cersei Lannister on HBO's hit show
"Game of Thrones." Ma-Ma's death
grip over the 200-story
residence/drug ring known as Peach
Trees will have even the thickest of
audience members recoiling in
squeamish empathy (Stay on your
RFs good side). Karl Urban carries
Judge Dredd with only his forceful
voice, for nothing but his chops show,
a feat rightfully impressive if only
because Olivia Thirlby's complex
female lead convincingly plays off a
character whose eyes window to
the soul, mind you! are never seen.
"Dredd" sets aside modest expecta
tions for kill-or-be-killed action
bangers in favor of a story tight with
suspense and payoffs complemented
rather than compensated for by its
indulgent use of violence and
comedic timing.

Indeed, "Dredd" is no pic for the
faint of heart, or for the bitter mind.
Those who are sick of routine
dystopian justice flicks that flop
around on screen like imitation crab
stunned to life with a defibrillator will
be pleased to find a crisply violent
action melee whose inventive tech
niques for making spectacles of death
and pain are rivaled only by its cre
ative display of digital graphics.
In a sea of overdone "Avengers"
types and never-ending action series,
"Dredd" offers a refreshing spread of
high-tech bloodbaths sprinkled with
a welcome dash of irreverence.
Sasha Arijanto was a freshman once,
when she was Judge'd by Chem 31 A.
Her psychic ability didn't help.
