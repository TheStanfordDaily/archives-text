## In Style: Gangnam? 
### â€” margaret LIN 
The style of dance is distinctive. The beat is unbeat
able. The addictiveness is abnormal. That's right,
I'm talking about the most addictive music video
that came out this summer: "Gangnam Style" by PSY.
Since its You Tube debut on July 15, PSY's hilarious
music video has skyrocketed to the top of the Billboard
charts and has garnered over 180 million You Tube plays
alone. Passing artists like Justin Bieber, Adele and Lady
Gaga, PSY seems to have magically horse-danced into the
heart of Americans in almost no time at all and with
fewer than five English words. Ey, Sexy Lady!
Korean pop stars have tried for ages to break into the
realm of American pop. Popular Korean stars like Big
Bang, SNSD and especially the Wonder Girls have tried
in various vain attempts to try to make it big in the
States. The Wonder Girls have toured with the Jonas
Brothers, released English singles and have plans of mak
ing an American album, but their media coverage never
amounted to more than a small blip in the world of
American media. So why is "Gangnam Style" the most
popular K-pop song on America's music charts?
Stereotypes. America loves stereotypes; there's no
denying that. In current popular American films, the
Asian male is always portrayed in the same shell: geeky,
gawky and, of course, desexualized. Whether it's Ken
Jeong in "The Hangover" or Ken Jeong in "Community"
or Ken Jeong in "The Hangover Part II," it's clear to see
that Asian males today have only one portrayal, and that's
the one of slapstick comedy actor Ken Jeong.
In years past, actors like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and
Jet Li had their golden age, but were they ever as revered
as white male actors were? Heroic and daring, maybe, but
filmic elements depicted them as foreign and detached
from "normal" (American) society.
But why did PSY succeed when so many others did
n't? It's because PSY catered to these American interests
or, put in harsher terms, stereotypes. He was geeky,
gawky, desexualized, foreign any word to describe how
Asians are perceived in popular American culture. He
portrayed exactly that to the T, and nothing more. Yes,
other artists actually aimed for their audience to be
Americans, but they didn't take into account the fact that
Asians aren't perceived as cool in American pop culture.
Whether or not this stereotype will change is up to
society to decide.
