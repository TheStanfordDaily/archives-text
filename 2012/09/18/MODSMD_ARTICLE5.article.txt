## UNIVERSITY AlertSU timing raises questions 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
A school-wide alert reporting
an incident of sexual battery last
Wednesday has drawn questions
about the timeliness and effective
ness of the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety's
(SUDPS) emergency notification
policies. Stanford Chief of Police
Laura Wilson, however, maintains
that the alert system helps to noti
fy community members of poten
tial risks and can lead to the reso
lution of crimes.
On Wednesday, Sept. 12, the
SUDPS issued an AlertSU notify
ing the community that a sexual
battery had occurred by
Manzanita Field.
The alert read, "A female stu
dent reported at 4:55 p.m. that on
Wednesday afternoon (9/12/12) at
approximately 1:20 p.m., she was
groped from behind by an
unknown male while walking
along the sidewalk by Manzanita
Field, near the intersection of
Campus Drive and Serra Street."
Issued at 6:30 p.m., the alert
came approximately an hour and
half after the crime was reported,
and five hours after the incident
had taken place.
Wilson said that often the rea
son why SUDPS AlertSU notifica
tions are sent out so long after a
crime is committed is because the
victims do not report the crime to
the police immediately.
"The campus community is
upset with us if we don't report the
crime right after it happens, but
then if we explain that the victim
did not report the crime, we're vic
tim blaming," Wilson said. "We get
criticism either way and we accept
that."
According to Wilson, the alerts
try to give as much information
about the crime as possible, as well
as a detailed description of the per
petrator. The reasoning behind this
is twofold. Wilson said that the
AlertSU system helps students to
be aware of crimes on campus, so
they can be more careful. It also
can help SUDPS find leads to
solve crimes.
In May of 2011, the SUDPS
sent out an alert via text and email
that gunshots had been fired in the
Lagunita parking lot. This led to a
student taking a picture of the
shooter's car and license plate and
sending it in to the police, accord
ing to Wilson.
Wilson said that the police
department often runs into privacy
issues when a crime is committed
in a small dorm.
"We try to walk the fine line of
obeying the law, respecting the vic
tim and alerting the community to
the crime that has occurred,"
Wilson said.
The AlertSU system is
designed in compliance with the

Clery Act, a federal regulation that
requires all colleges participating
in federal financial aid programs to
make information about on-cam
pus crimes available to the com
munity.
There are two different types of
alerts. The first is called a timely
warning. Timely warnings are used
for nine different types of crimes.
These include criminal homicide,
sexual offenses, aggravated assault,
burglary, arson, motor vehicle theft
and arrests for drug-related offens
es and illegal weapon possession.
The Department of Education has
advised that "timely reporting to
the campus community... be
decided on a case-by-case basis in
light of all the facts surrounding a
crime."
The law requires that a timely
warning be sent out to the entire
community, which includes stu
dents, faculty and staff. Wilson said
that there was no way in which
SUDPS could contact the parents
of students with an AlertSU unless
the student specifically listed their
home phone number as their con
tact information for the alert sys
tem.
The second type of alert is
called an immediate notification,
and it does not need to be sent to
the entire campus community.
SUDPS tries to send the alerts to
groups on campus that would be
most likely to see the immediate
notification.
"The method we choose to use
is somewhat dependent on the
level of threat to the community,"
Wilson said.
However, whereas a timely
warning may be sent out up to 24
hours after a crime is committed,
an immediate notification must be
sent out as soon as the crime is
reported.
"We get out the immediate
notification as soon as possible
after we find out that the threat is
credible," Wilson said. "We shoot
for 20 minutes after the crime has
been committed."
Wilson said that SUDPS has
been sending out emergency alerts
via email and text message, which
are now its primary means of send
ing alerts, for about three years.
Although students may feel that
they get an overload of AlertSU
texts or emails, Wilson said that
SUDPS is "not sending out as
many alerts as [its] counterparts"
at other universities.
Wilson said that the only cir
cumstances in which SUDPS would
not send out a timely warning or an
immediate notification would be if
it would set back an ongoing inves
tigation or if it would "compromise
a rescue situation or put a victim in
danger."
