## 49 students await assignment Homing expects to place students by start of fall term 
### HAIY LE 
After passing through the
Draw and the waitlist round unas
signed, 49 undergraduates with
guaranteed housing remain with
out an assignment for fall quarter.
According to Student
Housing, all students with guaran
teed housing are expected to
receive assignments by Sept. 20 in
the continuous assignment round.
Of the 215 students who were
left without housing after the
Draw in the spring, 125 were guar
anteed. Eighty-six students were
assigned during the waitlist round,
and 74 more during continuous
assignments, whittling the number
down to 49.
"Student Housing is very
pleased to have successfully met
the undergraduate housing guar

antee again this year, especially
given a larger freshman class,
increased applications from
upper-class students in the Draw,
and a hot off-campus rental mar
ket (off-campus rentals are
increasing in cost and availability
of apartments is down)," wrote
Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing, in an
email to The Daily.
In addition to those who were
not assigned housing, 95 students
applied for reassignment after the
spring draw. According to the
autumn 2012 undergraduate wait
list statistics posted on the Student
Housing website, 62 of those 95
were successfully reassigned. The
remaining students kept their
original assignments.
In comparison, during the 2011
autumn waitlist round, 103 stu
dents applied for reassignment
and 49 were reassigned. In 2010,
86 students applied for reassign
ment, with 46 successfully reas

signed.
"The number of students
applying for reassignment has
been quite low these past few
years," Whitney wrote. "The feed
back we've had from students is
that the many capital improve
ments we have made in our hous
es over the past few years have
brought much more equity in
facilities, so that students are gen
erally happier with their first
assignment."
Students requesting reassign
ment are doing so more frequent
ly to deal with split draw groups
and groups of friends seeking
proximity on campus than to deal
with dissatisfaction, according to
Student Housing. Housing added
that the figures for which dorms
students asked to be reassigned
out of and into were not available.
"The changes in the Draw a
few years ago provide students
the opportunity to rank every sin
gle house as an option, which
gives them more control over
their assignment outcome, and
this has probably also helped the
numbers of reassignments decline
somewhat in recent years,"
Whitney wrote.
Some undergraduates will also
find themselves in graduate hous
ing, where priority is given to stu
dents who are 21 or older. This
year, 60 undergraduate students
will live in Rains House, tradition
ally a graduate residence.
However, according to
Whitney, there is hope for stu
dents who no longer have guaran
teed housing.
"Even some of the students
who are not guaranteed will also
be assigned as we receive cancel
lations from students whose plans
have changed at the last minute,"
he wrote.
