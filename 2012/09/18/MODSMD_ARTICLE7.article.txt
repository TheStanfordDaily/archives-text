## Departments assess impact of ThiMat Average lecture size will be 60, down from 250 for IHUM 
### KATIE ZINGHEIM 
A new freshman requirement
designed to replace the often-criticized
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM)
program will feature a lower student-to
faculty ratio and a much more diverse
course offering, according to University
administrators involved in its creation.
However, with the program's debut only
a week away, department chairs are still
assessing how this change in academic
policy will affect their operations.
After a University report found dissat
isfaction with the IHUM program, citing
"(relatively) low course evaluations, poor
attendance at lectures and a widespread
failure to engage deeply with course
materials," the Faculty Senate voted in
March to replace this requirement with a
new program called Thinking Matters.
This year's incoming freshman class will
be the first to take these new courses.
Thinking Matters' drastically smaller
class sizes and focus on individualized
attention are the primary selling points of
the new courses. The average Thinking
Matters lecture size will be only 60 stu
dents, compared to 250 students in
IHUM lectures, according to Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam in an email to The Daily. The
number of students in the sections will be
similarly reduced.

To make such numbers possible, the
Thinking Matters program offers more
than 35 courses, a feat that requires sub
stantial financial contribution.
Russell Berman, previous chair of the
IHUM program and director of Thinking
Matters, said that the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) provided "core development
funds to faculty" that were necessary to
create the curriculum for these new
courses.
Elam declined to give any specific fig
ures on the cost of starting up the
Thinking Matters program, but stated
that the "decisions are not cost-driven
they are educationally driven."
Stanford professor and chair of the
Philosophy Department Lanier
Anderson, while not directly involved
with the development of Thinking
Matters, said that the lowered student-to
faculty ratio "was made possible by seri
ous budgetary commitment on the part of
the VPUE and the program." But he
added, "I think they basically funded the
program at a similar level to what they
used to have when it was IHUM."
While IHUM lasted for the three
quarters and only offered humanities
courses, Thinking Matters will be just one
quarter and draw from every undergrad
uate department in the University.
Anderson explained that Thinking
Matters will require less commitment for
many departments that were already
involved in IHUM.
Under the IHUM program, two-quar

ter, winter-and-spring sequences depend
ed on individual departments "to take
responsibility for that track," Anderson
said.
"That meant that the department had
to come up with faculty members to put
in there and make sure that they got
taught," he added.
So while departments still contribute
faculty and come up with ideas for new
courses, they are no longer "locked into
teaching IHUM," Anderson said.
From departments not previously
involved in IHUM, however, Thinking
Matters requests a new level of involve
ment.
"For them, it's on the one side an
opportunity to teach freshmen that they
didn't used to get," Anderson said, refer
ring to social science, natural science and
engineering departments. But he also
anticipated some departments feeling
pressure to make sure they have a course
offered in the Thinking Matters lineup.
Robert Simoni, professor and chair of
the Biology Department, said that it is too
soon to determine if his department's
new involvement in Thinking Matters will
lead to any negative effects.
"There are three faculty in biology
who are teaching Thinking Matters cours
es this year they're people who will be
doing that instead of something else," he
said. "The question is if this will impact
other things that we do."
While the answer to that question will
be provided somewhere down the
road, Simoni said students in
departments such as biology are
likely to benefit most from the
immediate effects of Thinking
Matters' decreased quarter
requirement.
The biology major requires a
rather rigorous commitment from
students early on in their academ
ic career, including chemistry,
physics and math sequences.
Thinking Matters offers two addi
tional quarters that freshmen can
use to take some of those core
classes.
"Freshman year is really
crammed for our students, so any
relief would be great," Simoni

said.
Mehran Sahami, professor and
chair of the Computer Science
Department, said he likes the
increased flexibility that Thinking
Matters offers students. It allows
freshmen to get a jump-start on
major prerequisites but also
allows them to explore more sub
ject areas.
But the reduced quarter
requirement could also demand
more adaptation from the depart
ments, as freshmen decide how to
fulfill the newly freed up units.
"The uncertainty that
(Thinking Matters) has created is
what enrollment in courses will
look like, especially introductory
courses," Sahami said. "It makes it
more difficult for us to forecast
what enrollment will be,"
But those in charge of develop
ing Thinking Matters are trying to
encourage freshmen to fill those

spots with elective Thinking
Matters classes.
Berman said he hopes that stu
dents take advantage of the
diverse course offerings and sign
up for more than the one required
quarter. He emphasized the par
ticipation in the program by facul
ty from across the University,
including two professors from the
graduate schools.
The option will be particularly
enticing next year, when some
Thinking Matters courses will also
fulfill the general education
requirements needed to graduate.
Anderson said that by meeting
general education requirements,
the Thinking Matters program
could help mitigate a lack of sci
ence and engineering courses that
are designed for beginning stu
dents who don't plan on pursuing
the topic.
Similar to an Introductory

Seminar, these classes "are not
beholden to laying down the intro
ductory foundation that people
are going to need if they're going
to go on to major in the thing,"
Anderson said.
Already, a select number of
Thinking Matters classes are
offered that fulfill the freshman
writing requirement, replacing the
traditional one-quarter Program
in Writing and Rhetoric.
As a result of these changes,
faculty said that hopes for the pro
gram remain high.
"I think there are a lot of things
to play out, and one hopes that
those will be developed and
thoughtful," Simoni said. "But I
think it will be great."

A new freshman requirement
designed to replace the often-criticized
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM)
program will feature a lower student-to
faculty ratio and a much more diverse
course offering, according to University
administrators involved in its creation.
However, with the program's debut only
a week away, department chairs are still
assessing how this change in academic
policy will affect their operations.
After a University report found dissat
isfaction with the IHUM program, citing
"(relatively) low course evaluations, poor
attendance at lectures and a widespread
failure to engage deeply with course
materials," the Faculty Senate voted in
March to replace this requirement with a
new program called Thinking Matters.
This year's incoming freshman class will
be the first to take these new courses.
Thinking Matters' drastically smaller
class sizes and focus on individualized
attention are the primary selling points of
the new courses. The average Thinking
Matters lecture size will be only 60 stu
dents, compared to 250 students in
IHUM lectures, according to Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam in an email to The Daily. The
number of students in the sections will be
similarly reduced.

To make such numbers possible, the
Thinking Matters program offers more
than 35 courses, a feat that requires sub
stantial financial contribution.
Russell Berman, previous chair of the
IHUM program and director of Thinking
Matters, said that the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) provided "core development
funds to faculty" that were necessary to
create the curriculum for these new
courses.
Elam declined to give any specific fig
ures on the cost of starting up the
Thinking Matters program, but stated
that the "decisions are not cost-driven
they are educationally driven."
Stanford professor and chair of the
Philosophy Department Lanier
Anderson, while not directly involved
with the development of Thinking
Matters, said that the lowered student-to
faculty ratio "was made possible by seri
ous budgetary commitment on the part of
the VPUE and the program." But he
added, "I think they basically funded the
program at a similar level to what they
used to have when it was IHUM."
While IHUM lasted for the three
quarters and only offered humanities
courses, Thinking Matters will be just one
quarter and draw from every undergrad
uate department in the University.
Anderson explained that Thinking
Matters will require less commitment for
many departments that were already
involved in IHUM.
Under the IHUM program, two-quar

ter, winter-and-spring sequences depend
ed on individual departments "to take
responsibility for that track," Anderson
said.
"That meant that the department had
to come up with faculty members to put
in there and make sure that they got
taught," he added.
So while departments still contribute
faculty and come up with ideas for new
courses, they are no longer "locked into
teaching IHUM," Anderson said.
From departments not previously
involved in IHUM, however, Thinking
Matters requests a new level of involve
ment.
"For them, it's on the one side an
opportunity to teach freshmen that they
didn't used to get," Anderson said, refer
ring to social science, natural science and
engineering departments. But he also
anticipated some departments feeling
pressure to make sure they have a course
offered in the Thinking Matters lineup.
Robert Simoni, professor and chair of
the Biology Department, said that it is too
soon to determine if his department's
new involvement in Thinking Matters will
lead to any negative effects.
"There are three faculty in biology
who are teaching Thinking Matters cours
es this year they're people who will be
doing that instead of something else," he
said. "The question is if this will impact
other things that we do."
While the answer to that question will
be provided somewhere down the
road, Simoni said students in
departments such as biology are
likely to benefit most from the
immediate effects of Thinking
Matters' decreased quarter
requirement.
The biology major requires a
rather rigorous commitment from
students early on in their academ
ic career, including chemistry,
physics and math sequences.
Thinking Matters offers two addi
tional quarters that freshmen can
use to take some of those core
classes.
"Freshman year is really
crammed for our students, so any
relief would be great," Simoni

said.
Mehran Sahami, professor and
chair of the Computer Science
Department, said he likes the
increased flexibility that Thinking
Matters offers students. It allows
freshmen to get a jump-start on
major prerequisites but also
allows them to explore more sub
ject areas.
But the reduced quarter
requirement could also demand
more adaptation from the depart
ments, as freshmen decide how to
fulfill the newly freed up units.
"The uncertainty that
(Thinking Matters) has created is
what enrollment in courses will
look like, especially introductory
courses," Sahami said. "It makes it
more difficult for us to forecast
what enrollment will be,"
But those in charge of develop
ing Thinking Matters are trying to
encourage freshmen to fill those

spots with elective Thinking
Matters classes.
Berman said he hopes that stu
dents take advantage of the
diverse course offerings and sign
up for more than the one required
quarter. He emphasized the par
ticipation in the program by facul
ty from across the University,
including two professors from the
graduate schools.
The option will be particularly
enticing next year, when some
Thinking Matters courses will also
fulfill the general education
requirements needed to graduate.
Anderson said that by meeting
general education requirements,
the Thinking Matters program
could help mitigate a lack of sci
ence and engineering courses that
are designed for beginning stu
dents who don't plan on pursuing
the topic.
Similar to an Introductory

Seminar, these classes "are not
beholden to laying down the intro
ductory foundation that people
are going to need if they're going
to go on to major in the thing,"
Anderson said.
Already, a select number of
Thinking Matters classes are
offered that fulfill the freshman
writing requirement, replacing the
traditional one-quarter Program
in Writing and Rhetoric.
As a result of these changes,
faculty said that hopes for the pro
gram remain high.
"I think there are a lot of things
to play out, and one hopes that
those will be developed and
thoughtful," Simoni said. "But I
think it will be great."
