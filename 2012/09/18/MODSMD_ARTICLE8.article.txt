## Hoover to build $45-55M facility 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Hoover Institute, a University-affiliat
ed conservative think tank, has begun a $6O
million fundraising campaign for a new facility
to be built on the site of the current Cummings
Art Building. The planned facility will be the
Institute's first expansion project in 35 years.
"It's really just a growth question," said
David Davenport, a research fellow at the
Institute who also serves as one of the project's
leaders. "Hoover, as a part of Stanford, has
continued to grow, like most departments. And
with no new space in 35 years... we're burst
ing at the seams and have been for a while."
The building will "provide 50,000 square
feet of much-needed conference and office
space, which will accommodate additional
scholars, staff and events," according to the
University's 2012-13 budget plan.
The Hoover Institute, which includes staff
offices as well as the Hoover War Archives, is
currently located across the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, the Lou Henry Hoover
Building and Hoover Tower. It has not added
more space since 1977.
Davenport said that Hoover began talking
to the University about growth space about 10
years ago and hoped to be granted a site close
to its existing location. Since Stanford plans to
have completed the new McMurtry Building
for the arts by 2015, it decided to allow the
Hoover Institute to demolish the
Cummings Art Building and build
on its site, which is directly adja
cent to Hoover Tower.
According to Davenport,
Hoover previously considered
space in Encina Hall and the site
of the new Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB), but
discovered that the University
had other plans for these spaces.
The University has previously
announced that the Art and
Architecture Library, currently
housed in Cummings, will be
moved to a central position in the
new McMurtry Building. With a
site neighboring the Cantor Arts
Center and Bing Concert Hall, the
McMurtry Building, which recent
ly gained approval from the
Board of Trustees, will be the new
home of the Department of Art
and Art History.
In the University budget, the
Hoover Institute estimated a cost
of $45.6 million for its new facility.
Davenport said, however, that the
actual cost is still uncertain.
"We have two different esti
mates of the actual construction
costs one that is about $45 mil
lion and one that is about $55 mil
lion," Davenport said. "You don't
really know until you have your
architectural plans and you actu
ally go out to bid. Our fundraising
goal is $6O million, but we hope
the actual cost will be closer to

that $45-$5O million."
The Institute began fundrais
ing this year and had raised $3.2
million by mid-June. Additionally,
Davenport reported that three
major donors who have, to
date, chosen to remain anony
mousâ€” pledged about $3O mil
lion in total for the project.
"The Stanford approach is to
try to identify a donor to give half
of the cost of the project and then
name the building after that per
son," Davenport said. "So that's a
hope for this project."
David Lenox, director of cam
pus planning and design, wrote in
an email to The Daily that the

design process for the new building
has not yet begun. However, he
anticipates that the building will be
architecturally similar to its neigh
boring buildings.
"Due to its location adjacent to
the Main Quad, Green Library
and the Art Gallery and Hoover
Tower, it is likely that the building
will blend into architectural styles
surrounding the site," said Lenox,
who is also the University archi
tect.
The three main aspects of the
new facility will be conferencing
space, meeting rooms where
scholars can collaborate and
office space, according to

Davenport.
"We're going to have in [the
new facility] a significant confer
encing capability," Davenport
said. "In the conferencing space,
we're going to have an auditorium
that would seat around 400 peo
ple. And we hope to have a dining,
multi-space room to seat that
number of people, and also some
breakout space."
While the auditorium will not
be regularly available to the pub
lic or for classes, Devonport said
he anticipates that other campus
entities will be able to rent the
space for conferences.
The project has already

received Form 1 approval from
Provost John Etchemendy, and
Hoover officials expect to go
before the Board of Trustees
once they have developed archi
tectural plans. Davenport said
that the Institute plans to begin
construction during the spring of
2015 and hopes to finish by
January 2017.
Hoover is also planning on
renovating the reading room of
their archives this academic year
at an expense of $500,000, accord
ing to the University budget plan.
