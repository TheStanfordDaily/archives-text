## XOX withdraws from negotiations 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) residents will
return to campus this quarter to a house
under University management for the
first time, as XOX representatives with
drew in August from long-running nego
tiations with administrators to restore
the house's historical independence.
Following the Alumni Board's Aug.
20 decision not to accept the
University's most recent offer of
delayed and conditional independence,
the house transitioned to University
management on Sept. 1.
"The University ... remain[s] com
mitted to working closely with you to
preserve as much of the traditional Chi
Theta Chi experience as possible for you
this year," wrote Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney and
Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder in a letter to incoming
XOX residents.
In an Aug. 3 letter from the Alumni
Board to University administrators, the
Alumni Board highlighted the lack of
benchmarks offering a clear path to a
lease with long-term security for the
Board, the imposition of greater over
sight over the traditionally independent
house and demands for significant
Board-funded capital improvements as
apparent reversals of previous under
standings with University administra
tors.
"At our most recent meeting,
University representatives stated that
legal ownership was never the
University's intention, leading us to
believe that the University has been
negotiating in bad faith for months,"
Abel Allison 'OB, XOX Alumni Board
and Madeleine Douglas 'O9 M.A. 'lO
wrote in the August letter.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential & Dining
Enterprises Shirley Everett disputed the
notion of any shift in the University's
position between May and August, not
ing that administrators only moved
away from a permanent termination of

the lease as a result of community sup
port for Chi Theta Chi and a "com
pelling argument" made by alumni and
students for the importance of inde
pendence to the house's culture.
"We can say with confidence that
throughout our discussions, we have
been steadfast in our efforts to reach an
agreement with Chi Theta Chi according
to the proposed terms [of independence
conditional on improved manage
ment]," Boardman and Everett wrote in
a statement.
Allison framed the letter as a means
of highlighting issues that the Alumni
Board considered critical to obtaining a
permanent settlement, and described
University insistence on the termination
of the lease and a stringently regulated
interim period before any restored inde
pendence as insurmountable obstacles.
"This has been a very costly endeav
or for everyone involved in terms of our
time and energy," Allison said. "There
were a number of details that still
wouldn't work out."
"The University started by taking
almost everything away from us," he
said. "It's been a process of having to
fight to get back to a place where we'd
be OK continuing ... It was clear the
University wasn't going to come any
more our way, [and] we needed to see
more in order for this to be something
worth doing
"It's what people expected," said
Peter McDonald 'll, a former XOX res
ident active in events promoting the
house's independence. "It's not a happy
time, but there's not a sense of giving up.
... [Residents] understand the Alumni
Board was doing what it had to do, and
there's generally a lot of support."
Administrators first moved to termi
nate Chi Theta Chi's lease on Feb. 8,
alleging "pressing life safety issues" and
shortcomings in the house's manage
ment and finances, and sought a transfer
to University control on April 2. The
takeover was later postponed to Aug. 31,
at the natural expiration of the annually
renewed lease.
While both parties appeared close in
May to obtaining a settlement establish

ing a period of joint management and
ownership of the house with the
potential future restoration of owner
ship to the XOX Alumni Board the
August letter from the Alumni Board to
University administrators urgently
requested a meeting in response to
alleged changes in the University's
negotiating stance.
"The arrangement the University is
presently offering is not one that we
would be able to accept, as it fails to rep
resent the core values of our constituen
cy and the premise of a mutually-benefi
cial partnership with the University,"
Allison and Madeleine Douglas 'O9
M.A. 'lO wrote in the August letter.
Even while negotiations over the
lease have concluded, XOX representa
tives and administrators anticipate a
continued dialogue regarding the
house's transition to University man
agement.
"All of us share the common goal of
ensuring that Chi Theta Chi remains a
safe haven for its residents and a dynam
ic living environment retaining many of
the unique program elements that are
important to students in the house,"
Boardman and Everett wrote.
"We're working out how to commu
nicate to our own community that this
wasn't an easy decision to come to,"
Allison said. "We're in a holding pattern
for now at least, just making sure that
the students are OK."
House residents are working to
maintain the XOX ethos amid the tur
moil.
"It's wearing on the residents a lot,"
House Manager Lauren Young Smith
'l3 said. "Having workers and
University officials coming through the
house all the time is pretty unlivable."
"We were talking about repainting
kitchen cabinets and.. . . nobody is
going to put in the time and effort that
that would take only to have it yanked
out the next summer," Kitchen Manager
Vanessa Moody 'l4 said.

University administrators and the Chi Theta Chi (XOX) Alumni Board failed to reach an agreement on the fate of the house's
future ownership before the start of the fall quarter. XOX representatives anticipate continued dialogue with Stanford officials.
Chi Theta Chi (XOX) residents will
return to campus this quarter to a house
under University management for the
first time, as XOX representatives with
drew in August from long-running nego
tiations with administrators to restore
the house's historical independence.
Following the Alumni Board's Aug.
20 decision not to accept the
University's most recent offer of
delayed and conditional independence,
the house transitioned to University
management on Sept. 1.
"The University ... remain[s] com
mitted to working closely with you to
preserve as much of the traditional Chi
Theta Chi experience as possible for you
this year," wrote Executive Director of
Student Housing Rodger Whitney and
Dean of Residential Education
Deborah Golder in a letter to incoming
XOX residents.
In an Aug. 3 letter from the Alumni
Board to University administrators, the
Alumni Board highlighted the lack of
benchmarks offering a clear path to a
lease with long-term security for the
Board, the imposition of greater over
sight over the traditionally independent
house and demands for significant
Board-funded capital improvements as
apparent reversals of previous under
standings with University administra
tors.
"At our most recent meeting,
University representatives stated that
legal ownership was never the
University's intention, leading us to
believe that the University has been
negotiating in bad faith for months,"
Abel Allison 'OB, XOX Alumni Board
and Madeleine Douglas 'O9 M.A. 'lO
wrote in the August letter.
Vice Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Residential & Dining
Enterprises Shirley Everett disputed the
notion of any shift in the University's
position between May and August, not
ing that administrators only moved
away from a permanent termination of

the lease as a result of community sup
port for Chi Theta Chi and a "com
pelling argument" made by alumni and
students for the importance of inde
pendence to the house's culture.
"We can say with confidence that
throughout our discussions, we have
been steadfast in our efforts to reach an
agreement with Chi Theta Chi according
to the proposed terms [of independence
conditional on improved manage
ment]," Boardman and Everett wrote in
a statement.
Allison framed the letter as a means
of highlighting issues that the Alumni
Board considered critical to obtaining a
permanent settlement, and described
University insistence on the termination
of the lease and a stringently regulated
interim period before any restored inde
pendence as insurmountable obstacles.
"This has been a very costly endeav
or for everyone involved in terms of our
time and energy," Allison said. "There
were a number of details that still
wouldn't work out."
"The University started by taking
almost everything away from us," he
said. "It's been a process of having to
fight to get back to a place where we'd
be OK continuing ... It was clear the
University wasn't going to come any
more our way, [and] we needed to see
more in order for this to be something
