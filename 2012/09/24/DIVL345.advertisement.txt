NEW COURSES THIS AUTUMN
ENGLISH 68N Mark Twain and American Culture
Mark Twain has been called our Rabelais, our Cervantes, our Homer, our Tolstoy, our Shakespeare. Ernest Hemingway
maintained that all modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn. President Franklin D. Roosevelt got the phrase New Deal from A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Class
discussions will focus on how Twain's work illuminates and complicates his society's responses to such issues as race,
technology, heredity versus environment, religion, education, and what it means to be American. MW 12:35-2:05 (Fishkin)
ENGLISH 88N Graphic Novels Asian American Style
Though genre fiction has occasionally been castigated as a lowbrow form only pandering to the uneducated masses,
this course reveals how Asian American writers transform the genre to speak to issues of racial difference and social
inequality. TTh 3:15-4:45 (Sohn)
English 121A Tattoos, Scars, Marks,
and American Cultures of Inscription
From Anne Hutchinson to Nathaniel Hawthorne, American writers were drawn to marked, tattooed, and scarred bodies.
This course examines how various corporeal inscriptions, real or imagined, have become vehicles of reward and
punishment, objects of science, sites of race and gender identities, and vessels of the divine and the unsayable.
Considering a wide range of texts, images and movies, we will trace how marks on the very surface of the subject have
been read and made meaningful. What is the relationship between body and text? What are the confines of surface
and self? How does the body participate in constructions of race, class, and gender? MW 5:15-7:ospm (Dippold)
ENGLISH 154 Mapping the Romantic Imagination
In this course we will work together to build a Romantic xenograph: an interactive digital map of the places and
geographic spaces that informed the writing of British Romantic poets, essayists, and novelists from 1780-1830. We will
explore the meaning of foreignness in the Romantic period by supplementing readings and discussions of Romantic
literature with digital analyses while creating a new map of the physical and imaginative geographic interests of the
Romanttc period. Authors include Mary Wollstonecraft, Thomas De Quincy, Lord Byron, Anna Barbauld, Ann Radcliff,
and William Beckford. TTh 9-]0:50 am (Algee-Hewitt)
ENGLISH 184H Text Technologies: A History

Manguel will ccfst light on our work on cave painting, inscription, graffiti, tattoo, and manuscript, print, photographic and
digital technologies. TTh 3:15-4:45pm (Treharne)
