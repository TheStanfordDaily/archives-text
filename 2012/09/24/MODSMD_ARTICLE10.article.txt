## Color and The Rainbow: Black and Queer at Stanford 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
My biggest personal battle
has been an ongoing one
to find and internalize
my own self-worth, a constant
uphill battle to love myself in my
entirety: my mind, my body, my
soul.
By and large, this is not an
issue I have battled for most of
my life. In fact, this emotional
roller coaster began during a time
that I was told would be the hap
piest years of my life, in a place
where I was told the students
were the happiest in America.
Freshman year, I penned a col
umn called "Obsessive
Kompulsion." What started as
anecdotes of my various quirks
soon turned into veiled tales of
my identity crises.
But I never worked up the
courage to articulate what was
really going on. Beneath my
cheerful relations with friends
and teachers and even
beneath my guarded candidness
about being "okay" and not
"fine" or "great" I was deeply
unhappy. I loathed myself,
thought I was incapable of ever
being loved and allowed myself
to spiral into a sadistically satisfy
ing streak of self-destruction that
affected my emotional and aca
demic life.
What I did not have the
courage to say then, and am com
fortable saying now, is that I am
attracted to men. I came out first
to my roommate, then my dorm,
and finally after a tortured
winter and spring quarter â€”to
my parents and siblings. I still
have not told my extended family.
Though I ultimately felt
relieved to have told my parents,
my issues with self-image and
self-worth, and accordingly with
self-destruction, did not end and
still have not ended.

Sure, I have a large contingent
of friends and colleagues on this
campus whose presence and exis
tence make me extraordinarily
happy. But while these relation
ships are deeply meaningful to
me, they do not replace the
underlying feeling I have
encountered for most of my time
on this campus: the sensation of
feeling incredibly alone and
undesired.
As a high school student, I
looked forward to college as
being the place where I would
have my first kiss, my first dates,
and where I was told I would like
ly meet my lifelong partner. But,
Full Moon on the Quad and scant
encounters at Terra parties
notwithstanding, none of these
things has remotely happened.
Gripes with the lack of dating
at Stanford aside, my experience
has been guided by what I per
ceive to be a larger sociological
issue: being an intellectual slim
black male in the gay community.
My experience with the
Stanford community, in person
and online, has been that the type
of men who are desired and
who are successful in hooking up
tend to be white or "Latin,"
"HWP" (height-weight propor
tional), "masculine" and/or "strB
- or acting." Countless
guys have told me that I'm not
their "type."
My experience would not be
the same if I were a "jock" or
"athletic," if I were more "dl" and
had waited until after freshman
year to come out or if I were
white.
For almost two years now, I
have internalized the notion that
white is beautiful and black is not,
that it pays to assume the forced
lingo of being a "dude," a "bro,"
"on the dl." And by virtue of this,

I have struggled to see the worth
and magnitude of my own light.
Every few months or weeks, I
would have a change of mentality
and feel comfortable in my mind
and body, feel comfortable being
single, feel happy. And I'd hope
that this independent radiance
would attract someone else.
And time after time, I'd lose
this glow falling and feeling
even further down than I'd been
before, falling back into the self
destructive streak of looking for
someone, anyone online, falling
into the vicious cycle of hating the
body and mind I was born into.
This past spring quarter, for
whatever reasons, had me at my
worst state of loneliness and
despair. Finding it difficult to get
out of bed at the beginning of the
quarter, I blew off most of my
classes eventually decreasing
my course load and switching
classes at the end of week three.
And around week seven, I
found myself unable to communi
cate, to call for help from my
friends, family, those I work with.
I locked myself in my room for
four days and did not answer calls
or emails didn't eat, slept all
day. I tried as hard as I could to
make myself fail.
I'm not sure what I want to get
out of writing this beyond
expressing that it is incredibly
hard to be a queer man of color
on this campus much more
than I've experienced anywhere
else.
I want, though, as another
school year starts, not to remain
silent.
Today, I proclaim my suffer
ing. And tomorrow, I wait to see
how my cries will be heard.
