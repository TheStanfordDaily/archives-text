# OP-ED
## A 						Response to the University on Chi Theta Chi 
### 
To the Stanford community,

We are disappointed to
report that Stanford's
Resident and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) and Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
have decided to carry out their plan,
announced on Feb. 8, 2012, not to
renew the ground lease for the stu
dent cooperative residence Chi
Theta Chi.
The Feb. 8 announcement came
to us as a surprise, with no forewarn
ing of R&DE's dissatisfaction. Over
the last seven months, our all-volun
teer alumni organization worked
tirelessly to understand and address
R&DE's needs and concerns, to
convey the tremendous value that
an independent house offers to the
Stanford community, and to find a
path to gain R&DE's support for
continued independent ownership
and management of Chi Theta Chi.
With overwhelming solidarity
from residents and alumni, the
Association has concluded that the
arrangement offered by R&DE
does not provide the level of opera
tional independence that we had
been seeking. The final version of
the proposal would have required
that we enter a multi-year interim
period without a lease, accept mini
mal security of future tenure and
drastically drain our finances at the
University's discretion. Only after
operating with no source of income
and running an estimated loss of

$70,000 a year during the interim
period of up to five years in order to
meet the University's stipulated
renovations many of which do
not pertain to life safety would
we be able to apply to have the
house deeded back to us. Reneging
on a promise made in March, Greg
Boardman and Shirley Everett
declined to commit to a legally bind
ing agreement outlining clear terms
to regaining a lease.
If attained, the new ground lease
would no longer be automatically
renewable but would instead
require the Board to then reapply
for renewal every three years even if
we have not erred in any way. Even
as homeowners, we would still have
no definitive authority over physical
changes to the house and would be
required to conform to institution
wide policies in order to keep the
property looking and functioning
like all other University residences.
We remain certain of the
Association's ability to effectively
run Chi Theta Chi in a manner that
promotes student welfare, safety
and happiness. It is not, however,
financially or operationally viable
for a small nonprofit organization
whose mission is to manage a single
property to match the capital
improvements of a large institution
responsible for many properties.
The new ground lease would
also eliminate the freedom of resi
dents to play a role in planning and
executing even small physical

improvements. Working collabora
tively with the Alumni Association
to operate and transform the space
has always been fundamental to res
idents' sense of responsibility for
their living space and lessons in
home ownership. Under the
arrangement offered, residents'
independence as well as the
Association's would be superficial
at best. We were unable to accept
this offer as it would fail to honor
the unique house culture that we
have been fighting to preserve on
behalf of the students, with their
continued support.
In response to these concerns,
which we outlined in an Aug. 3 let
ter, Greg Boardman and Shirley
Everett verbally offered to exclude
Chi Theta Chi from the Draw. This
proposal held little promise, howev
er, since they firmly refused to
change any of the terms that made
the interim arrangement and new
lease impossible for us to accept.
Even if the house were excluded
from the Draw, we would still be
forced to potentially bankrupt our
selves on renovations over which
we have no say. As leaseholders, we
would still be deprived of any mean
ingful ownership of the physical
property.
We encourage the Stanford
community as a whole to maintain a
dialogue on creating genuine diver
sity in student residence choices. Chi
Theta Chi's independence has been
seminal in fostering the personal,
social, and intellectual growth of
hundreds of Stanford students

across decades. The Association will
continue to seek ways to ensure
that Chi Theta Chi remains a haven
and a home for students who seek
the learning experience afforded by
cooperative home ownership.

also eliminate the freedom of resi
dents to play a role in planning and
executing even small physical

improvements. Working collabora
tively with the Alumni Association
to operate and transform the space
has always been fundamental to res
idents' sense of responsibility for
their living space and lessons in
home ownership. Under the
arrangement offered, residents'
independence as well as the
Association's would be superficial
at best. We were unable to accept
this offer as it would fail to honor
the unique house culture that we
have been fighting to preserve on
behalf of the students, with their
continued support.
In response to these concerns,
which we outlined in an Aug. 3 let
ter, Greg Boardman and Shirley
Everett verbally offered to exclude
Chi Theta Chi from the Draw. This
proposal held little promise, howev
er, since they firmly refused to
change any of the terms that made
the interim arrangement and new
lease impossible for us to accept.
Even if the house were excluded
from the Draw, we would still be
forced to potentially bankrupt our
selves on renovations over which
we have no say. As leaseholders, we
would still be deprived of any mean
ingful ownership of the physical
property.
We encourage the Stanford
community as a whole to maintain a
dialogue on creating genuine diver
sity in student residence choices. Chi
Theta Chi's independence has been
seminal in fostering the personal,
social, and intellectual growth of
hundreds of Stanford students

across decades. The Association will
continue to seek ways to ensure
that Chi Theta Chi remains a haven
and a home for students who seek
the learning experience afforded by
cooperative home ownership.

Sincerely,
THE CHI THETA CHI ALUMNI
ASSOCIATION
