## SPLIT DECISION Men falter in overtime loss 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Slowly but surely, Stanford's men's soc
cer team pushed Loyola Marymount's
defense back toward its goal. The constant
aggressor throughout Friday night's
match, the Cardinal strung passes togeth
er, pressed forward and pounded shots at
the Lions from all over the field.
It just wasn't enough.
A missed clearance 12 minutes into the
match gave LMU hope, and despite out
shooting its opponent 29-13, the Cardinal
lost yet another close match when the
Lions scored five minutes into overtime to
win the game 2-1.

For Stanford (3-4), the loss marked the
third 2-1 defeat of its young season, and
the second overtime loss.
"In the end, we gave up a couple of
goals on set pieces and that was the differ
ence," said head coach Jeremy Gunn. "We
weren't troubled much other than the odd
counter attack, but they were dangerous
on set pieces."
With a lineup that was long on height, if
short on skill, LMU didn't waste time
threatening, winning some early free kicks
in Stanford's half. But it was an almost
innocuous looking chance that proved
deadly.
A long cross into the box found an
open Lion forward, but his header was off
target and hit the crossbar. The rebound,
however, fell through the Stanford defense
and straight to LMU's Eric Brunter, who
easily found the back of the net from
point-blank range.
From then on, the Cardinal dominated.
Both on the attack and defense,
Stanford was the superior team, giving up
a few chances but creating plenty more of
its own. Senior forward Adam Jahn had
several attempts near goal, including a
shot that nearly equalized the score just
before the break. And the freshman duo of
Aaron Kovar and Ty Thompson both had
good opportunities that failed to produce
results.
Halftime did nothing to slow the
Stanford attack, as Jahn came out firing
with a nice piece of skill and the Card
pounded shot after shot unsuccessfully.

The 1,191-person crowd thought
Stanford had finally broken through when
senior defender Hunter Gorskie's header
stretched LMU goalkeeper Paul
Blanchette to his limit, but the referee
ruled that the entire ball had not crossed
the line and the Lions held onto their slim
advantage.
It was short lived, however, as the
Cardinal struck pay dirt 10 minutes later in
the 80th minute when Kovar pounced on
his own rebound and slotted the ball past
Blanchette into the side netting.
The crowd and both teams seemed
resigned to a Stanford victory, as the
momentum was clearly on the home
team's side. But the freshman Blanchette
continued to keep the Card at bay, making
his career-high eighth and final save when
Jahn seemed to have an opening but was
turned away just before injury time.
Overtime saw the same attacking
Stanford team push LMU back to its own
goal, as a nice combination and good cross
from junior defender Tyler Conklin found
classmate J.J. Koval in front of the goal.
Once again, Koval's header sailed just
over the bar as the crowd groaned.
Minutes later, LMU struck for the gold
en goal to end the match 5:55 into the
extra period.
Gunn's exasperation was evident.
"It's very frustrating because we are

said. "Yet, we are falling
short in games where we
should be doing better, ft is
a difficult result and a sim
ilar situation to the Santa
Clara game. We just have
to put it behind us and

move on."
Last week against Santa
Clara, Stanford outshot the
Broncos 24-9 but couldn't
overcome an early two-goal
deficit. Overall, the Cardinal
has outshot its opponent a
combined 79-41 in its four
losses on the season.
There's little time to
stew, as Pac-12 play opens
this weekend and No. 12
UCLA will prove a rude
visitor if the Cardinal can-

not find the net. The con
ference's preseason
favorite once again, the
Bruins have struggled at
Cagan Stadium, losing four
of the past five games on
the Farm. This Friday's
match is scheduled for 4
p.m. and will be televised
on the Pac-12 Networks.

Slowly but surely, Stanford's men's soc
cer team pushed Loyola Marymount's
defense back toward its goal. The constant
aggressor throughout Friday night's
match, the Cardinal strung passes togeth
er, pressed forward and pounded shots at
the Lions from all over the field.
It just wasn't enough.
A missed clearance 12 minutes into the
match gave LMU hope, and despite out
shooting its opponent 29-13, the Cardinal
lost yet another close match when the
Lions scored five minutes into overtime to
win the game 2-1.

For Stanford (3-4), the loss marked the
third 2-1 defeat of its young season, and
the second overtime loss.
"In the end, we gave up a couple of
goals on set pieces and that was the differ
ence," said head coach Jeremy Gunn. "We
weren't troubled much other than the odd
counter attack, but they were dangerous
on set pieces."
With a lineup that was long on height, if
short on skill, LMU didn't waste time
threatening, winning some early free kicks
in Stanford's half. But it was an almost
innocuous looking chance that proved
deadly.
A long cross into the box found an
open Lion forward, but his header was off
target and hit the crossbar. The rebound,
however, fell through the Stanford defense
and straight to LMU's Eric Brunter, who
easily found the back of the net from
point-blank range.
From then on, the Cardinal dominated.
Both on the attack and defense,
Stanford was the superior team, giving up
a few chances but creating plenty more of
its own. Senior forward Adam Jahn had
several attempts near goal, including a
shot that nearly equalized the score just
before the break. And the freshman duo of
Aaron Kovar and Ty Thompson both had
good opportunities that failed to produce
results.
Halftime did nothing to slow the
Stanford attack, as Jahn came out firing
with a nice piece of skill and the Card
pounded shot after shot unsuccessfully.

The 1,191-person crowd thought
Stanford had finally broken through when
senior defender Hunter Gorskie's header
stretched LMU goalkeeper Paul
Blanchette to his limit, but the referee
ruled that the entire ball had not crossed
the line and the Lions held onto their slim
advantage.
It was short lived, however, as the
Cardinal struck pay dirt 10 minutes later in
the 80th minute when Kovar pounced on
his own rebound and slotted the ball past
Blanchette into the side netting.
The crowd and both teams seemed
resigned to a Stanford victory, as the
momentum was clearly on the home
team's side. But the freshman Blanchette
continued to keep the Card at bay, making
his career-high eighth and final save when
Jahn seemed to have an opening but was
turned away just before injury time.
Overtime saw the same attacking
Stanford team push LMU back to its own
goal, as a nice combination and good cross
from junior defender Tyler Conklin found
classmate J.J. Koval in front of the goal.
Once again, Koval's header sailed just
over the bar as the crowd groaned.
Minutes later, LMU struck for the gold
en goal to end the match 5:55 into the
extra period.
Gunn's exasperation was evident.
