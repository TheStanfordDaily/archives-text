# Women wear down Devils
## 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Yesterday afternoon the Stanford
women's soccer team kicked off Pac-12
play with a 3-0 win over visiting Arizona
State.

The No. 3 Cardinal (7-1-1) has now
strung together five straight shutouts after
its single loss to West Virginia back in
August, scoring 15 goals in the process. The
defeat ends the Sun Devils' (4-5-1) recent
winning streak and also sends them to the
bottom of the early Pac-12 standings. The
Card's three goals came from junior for
ward Natalie Griffen, redshirt junior for
ward Courtney Verloo and junior forward
Taylor McCann.
However, the score line doesn't do jus
tice to what was a difficult test for the
Stanford team.
"I give Arizona State a lot of credit,"
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "I

thought they came out fast and furiously
against us. We didn't deal with that pres
sure very well, never got in a rhythm, and
honestly the first half I thought was the
worst first half we've played this year, so I
was very upset with them at half time."
Though the Card took five shots in the
first half, none were on target, while
Arizona fired six, testing Stanford redshirt
junior goalkeeper Aly Gleason twice. The
Sun Devils seemed to come out with more
aggression, making the Card uncomfort
able, and not allowing Stanford the time to
click.
In return, Arizona State players found
enough space to maneuver, and as the
clock wound down Stanford counted itself
lucky to go into the break level. A shot
from the left by Sun Devils' junior forward
Devin Marshall hit the crossbar and the
rebound by her teammate senior forward
Miah Mollay sailed harmlessly across the
face of the goal.
"We couldn't really string a lot of pass
es together," Griffen said, "and so I think
possession was our problem and our ener
gy was off. It was a little bit slow when we
really needed to pick up the pace and go at
them."
After the break, though, the Cardinal's
play was much improved. Ratcliffe made
several changes, including bringing on last
season's starting goalkeeper, junior Emily
Oliver, who returned for her first action
this year while recovering from injury.
Arizona State could not keep up the phys
ical presence and tempo it had set in the
first half and Stanford began to make dan
gerous runs through its opponent's
defense, outshooting the Sun Devils 19-8
by the final buzzer.
"At halftime it was more about 'let's not
turn this into random soccer,'" said
Ratcliffe. "We need to keep possession of
the ball, link up passes, try to get it wide, go
one-v-one, create chances and get some
crosses in. We settled in, got possession,
played much better and created a lot of
chances. It could have been five."
The breakthrough came from Griffen's
strike in the 55nd minute, and when soph
omore midfielder Lo'eau La√üonta was
brought down in the box seven minutes
later, Verloo stepped up to bury the penal
ty. As the clock wore down and Arizona
State struggled, Griffen looked clear to
add another with a breakaway shot. Her
strike was blocked, but McCann was hot
on her heels and finished off the attack.
Next up the Card will welcome the
Oregon schools to Laird Q. Cagan stadi
um, facing Pac-12 leaders No. 24 Oregon
State at 6 p.m. on Thursday followed by
Oregon at 2 p.m. on Sunday.
