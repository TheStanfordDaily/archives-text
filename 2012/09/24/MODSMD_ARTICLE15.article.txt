# The
						time is ripe for Nunes

Of all the things we've
learned about
Stanford football
through its first three
games, one point is
particularly revealing: Six might not
be 12, but it isn't half, either.
We've said it a hundred times
already, but for the sake of thor
oughness, let's do it one more time:
Josh Nunes (jersey No. 6) ain't
Andrew Luck (former No. 12).
He's completed just 53.4 percent of
his passes so far, with a fair number
of underthrows and overthrows
sprinkled throughout his first three
games as the Cardinal's starting
quarterback. Slow Luck's tape
down and you'll be treated to hyp
notic spirals; do the same with
Nunes' and you'll be treated to a bit
of a headache.
The best part of watching the
Cardinal this season, though, is that
none of that has really mattered. A
3-0 record is a 3-0 record, and it's
been really fun to take in.
There were usually more points
on the board when Luck was at the
helm, sure. And there were also
gaudier passing stats. But all that
came with a lot of stress from the
fans' point of view. As a nation
increasingly sick of the Andrew
Luck hype looked on, our eyes
were also kept trained on score
board and smartphone stats. Would
a 200-yard game be enough to
impress voters? 250? 300? Would a
few dropped passes that fell into
opponents' hands cost Luck the
Heisman? (Arguably, they did.)
With no-stress Nunes leading
Stanford's offense, we're free of
those woes. Who cares about pass
ing yards anymore? David Shaw
