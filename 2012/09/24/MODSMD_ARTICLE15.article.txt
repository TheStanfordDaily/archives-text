# The 						time is ripe for Nunes
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Of all the things we've
learned about
Stanford football
through its first three
games, one point is
particularly revealing: Six might not
be 12, but it isn't half, either.
We've said it a hundred times
already, but for the sake of thor
oughness, let's do it one more time:
Josh Nunes (jersey No. 6) ain't
Andrew Luck (former No. 12).
He's completed just 53.4 percent of
his passes so far, with a fair number
of underthrows and overthrows
sprinkled throughout his first three
games as the Cardinal's starting
quarterback. Slow Luck's tape
down and you'll be treated to hyp
notic spirals; do the same with
Nunes' and you'll be treated to a bit
of a headache.
The best part of watching the
Cardinal this season, though, is that
none of that has really mattered. A
3-0 record is a 3-0 record, and it's
been really fun to take in.
There were usually more points
on the board when Luck was at the
helm, sure. And there were also
gaudier passing stats. But all that
came with a lot of stress from the
fans' point of view. As a nation
increasingly sick of the Andrew
Luck hype looked on, our eyes
were also kept trained on score
board and smartphone stats. Would
a 200-yard game be enough to
impress voters? 250? 300? Would a
few dropped passes that fell into
opponents' hands cost Luck the
Heisman? (Arguably, they did.)
With no-stress Nunes leading
Stanford's offense, we're free of
those woes. Who cares about pass
ing yards anymore? David Shaw
sure doesn't, and with the
spotlight on Matt Barkley,
De' Anthony Thomas and
others, neither does the rest
of the country. A win is a
win, a loss is a loss, and as
onlookers we can no longer
claim moral victory (see:
Fiesta Bowl) or defeat (see:
Washington) on the num
bers of our quarterback.
We're back to real football.
Just give us the score, no
questions asked.
But just for old times'
sake, you should try some
stat tracking on Nunes.
You'd find that through
three games he has complet
ed 47 passes for 615 yards
and six touchdowns, which
probably doesn't even com
pare to Andrew Luck's num
bers in his first three starts,
right? Then you would look
up Luck's first three games
of 2009 —43 completions,
639 yards and four touch
downs and, considering
the fact that Luck went a
paltry 2-1 in those three con
tests, you would start

scratching your head a little
bit.
It goes without saying
that Nunes has less accuracy,
less upside and less of a
chance to develop those two
traits than his predecessor
did when he began starting.
But is it really that unfair to
compare Nunes with Luck
when the former has gotten
the job done just as well so
far and only took three
games to pull off a monu
mental upset?
That win over No. 2 USC
has already shifted the focus
of the Cardinal's season to
its Nov. 17 date at Oregon,
the team that dashed
Stanford's national champi
onship hopes each of the last
two seasons. It will be a
matchup of two top-10
teams if both squads hold
serve, and it could once
again decide the Pac-12
North.
Remember, Luck upset
No. 7 Oregon in his debut
against the Ducks back in
2009, with a whole lot of help
from Toby Gerhart. When
Nunes plays the Ducks for
the first time albeit in
hostile Autzen Stadium
he'll be aided by Stepfan
Taylor, whose senior season

could challenge Gerhart's
for the finest rushing cam
paign in school history. With
Nunes surrounded by a
stronger supporting cast,
especially on defense, than
Luck arguably ever benefit
ed from, could this finally be
the year to break Oregon's
dominance? Could Nunes
accomplish what Luck never
did and win a Pac-12 cham
pionship?
A lot can happen in the
next two months, and
Stanford will have a host of
other ranked opponents on
its schedule: Arizona, Notre
Dame, UCLA and Oregon
State. We only have three
games to work with, and
Nunes still has a lot to work
on. But this is about as good
of a start as any Cardinal fan
could have hoped for, and
that owes itself in large part
to one thing: Even after
three years of No. 12, No. 6
hasn't looked half bad.

scrambled eggs all week in
hopes that Nunes can con
tinue to scramble for first
downs the way he did
against USC. Send your best

been really fun to take in.
There were usually more points
on the board when Luck was at the
helm, sure. And there were also
gaudier passing stats. But all that
came with a lot of stress from the
fans' point of view. As a nation
increasingly sick of the Andrew
Luck hype looked on, our eyes
were also kept trained on score
board and smartphone stats. Would
a 200-yard game be enough to
impress voters? 250? 300? Would a
few dropped passes that fell into
opponents' hands cost Luck the
Heisman? (Arguably, they did.)
With no-stress Nunes leading
Stanford's offense, we're free of
those woes. Who cares about pass
ing yards anymore? David Shaw
sure doesn't, and with the
spotlight on Matt Barkley,
De' Anthony Thomas and
others, neither does the rest
of the country. A win is a
win, a loss is a loss, and as
onlookers we can no longer
claim moral victory (see:
Fiesta Bowl) or defeat (see:
Washington) on the num
bers of our quarterback.
We're back to real football.
Just give us the score, no
questions asked.
But just for old times'
sake, you should try some
stat tracking on Nunes.
You'd find that through
three games he has complet
ed 47 passes for 615 yards
and six touchdowns, which
probably doesn't even com
pare to Andrew Luck's num
bers in his first three starts,
right? Then you would look
up Luck's first three games
of 2009 —43 completions,
639 yards and four touch
downs and, considering
the fact that Luck went a
paltry 2-1 in those three con
tests, you would start

scratching your head a little
bit.
It goes without saying
that Nunes has less accuracy,
less upside and less of a
chance to develop those two
traits than his predecessor
did when he began starting.
But is it really that unfair to
compare Nunes with Luck
when the former has gotten
the job done just as well so
far and only took three
games to pull off a monu
mental upset?
That win over No. 2 USC
has already shifted the focus
of the Cardinal's season to
its Nov. 17 date at Oregon,
the team that dashed
Stanford's national champi
onship hopes each of the last
two seasons. It will be a
matchup of two top-10
teams if both squads hold
serve, and it could once
again decide the Pac-12
North.
Remember, Luck upset
No. 7 Oregon in his debut
against the Ducks back in
2009, with a whole lot of help
from Toby Gerhart. When
Nunes plays the Ducks for
the first time albeit in
hostile Autzen Stadium
he'll be aided by Stepfan
Taylor, whose senior season

could challenge Gerhart's
for the finest rushing cam
paign in school history. With
Nunes surrounded by a
stronger supporting cast,
especially on defense, than
Luck arguably ever benefit
ed from, could this finally be
the year to break Oregon's
dominance? Could Nunes
accomplish what Luck never
did and win a Pac-12 cham
pionship?
A lot can happen in the
next two months, and
Stanford will have a host of
other ranked opponents on
its schedule: Arizona, Notre
Dame, UCLA and Oregon
State. We only have three
games to work with, and
Nunes still has a lot to work
on. But this is about as good
of a start as any Cardinal fan
could have hoped for, and
that owes itself in large part
to one thing: Even after
three years of No. 12, No. 6
hasn't looked half bad.

Joseph Beyda is eating
scrambled eggs all week in
hopes that Nunes can con
tinue to scramble for first
downs the way he did
against USC. Send your best

Of all the things we've
learned about
Stanford football
through its first three
games, one point is
particularly revealing: Six might not
be 12, but it isn't half, either.
We've said it a hundred times
already, but for the sake of thor
oughness, let's do it one more time:
Josh Nunes (jersey No. 6) ain't
Andrew Luck (former No. 12).
He's completed just 53.4 percent of
his passes so far, with a fair number
of underthrows and overthrows
sprinkled throughout his first three
games as the Cardinal's starting
quarterback. Slow Luck's tape
down and you'll be treated to hyp
notic spirals; do the same with
Nunes' and you'll be treated to a bit
of a headache.
The best part of watching the
Cardinal this season, though, is that
none of that has really mattered. A
3-0 record is a 3-0 record, and it's
been really fun to take in.
