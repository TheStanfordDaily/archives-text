# NEW FACES POWER CARD

### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Freshmen usually have the opportunity to
ease into the bitter Stanford-Cal rivalry,
observing the competitive animosity from a
comfortable and risk-free bench seat. They
are able to acclimate to the heated atmos
phere, a scenario in which one team invari
ably must let their entire school down.
However, this is not the case for many of the
freshmen on the Stanford women's volleyball
team, who've been tossed right into the mid
dle of the rivalry with Cal.
Due to a couple of injuries, most notably
to former All-Pac-12 setter Karissa Cook, a
group of freshmen have seen heavy action for
the Cardinal (10-2,2-0 Pac-12) early on. That
didn't change when the UC-Berkeley Golden

Bears (7-5, 1-1 Pac-12) rolled into town on
Wednesday night, and the talented crop of
freshmen managed to carry Stanford to a
sweep of the Bears.

The Card got it rolling early on, jumping
out to an early 7-2 lead on the strength of
freshman setter Madi Bugg, who distributed
the ball well to the players up front. Stanford
continued to set the tone, going up 11-6. A kill
from freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess,
an ace from classmate Brittany Howard, and
a kill from junior Carly Wopat put Stanford

up 14-6 and forced Cal coach Rich Feller to
call a timeout. The Golden Bears settled
down following the break in play, but weren't
able to overcome the early deficit, as the Card
took the first set by a count of 25-17.
Cal carried the momentum they earned at
the end of the first set over into the second,
hanging with Stanford initially. They forced
an early 5-5 tie before Stanford took over.
Consecutive kills by Howard, Burgess and
Bugg set the tone and the Card cruised from
there, dismantling Cal en route to a 25-17 sec
ond set victory.
Backed firmly against the wall, Cal would
not go down without a fight. A pair of kills by
senior middle blocker Shannon Hawari put

No. 6 Stanford swept California and Utah on the first weekend of Pac- 12 play. The freshmen class featured heavily in the rotation, but it was
sophomore libero Kyle Gilbert (10) who had 27 digs in the two matches, helping to power the Cardinal defense and secure the victories.
