# NEW FACES POWER CARD
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Freshmen usually have the opportunity to
ease into the bitter Stanford-Cal rivalry,
observing the competitive animosity from a
comfortable and risk-free bench seat. They
are able to acclimate to the heated atmos
phere, a scenario in which one team invari
ably must let their entire school down.
However, this is not the case for many of the
freshmen on the Stanford women's volleyball
team, who've been tossed right into the mid
dle of the rivalry with Cal.
Due to a couple of injuries, most notably
to former All-Pac-12 setter Karissa Cook, a
group of freshmen have seen heavy action for
the Cardinal (10-2,2-0 Pac-12) early on. That
didn't change when the UC-Berkeley Golden

Bears (7-5, 1-1 Pac-12) rolled into town on
Wednesday night, and the talented crop of
freshmen managed to carry Stanford to a
sweep of the Bears.

The Card got it rolling early on, jumping
out to an early 7-2 lead on the strength of
freshman setter Madi Bugg, who distributed
the ball well to the players up front. Stanford
continued to set the tone, going up 11-6. A kill
from freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess,
an ace from classmate Brittany Howard, and
a kill from junior Carly Wopat put Stanford

up 14-6 and forced Cal coach Rich Feller to
call a timeout. The Golden Bears settled
down following the break in play, but weren't
able to overcome the early deficit, as the Card
took the first set by a count of 25-17.
Cal carried the momentum they earned at
the end of the first set over into the second,
hanging with Stanford initially. They forced
an early 5-5 tie before Stanford took over.
Consecutive kills by Howard, Burgess and
Bugg set the tone and the Card cruised from
there, dismantling Cal en route to a 25-17 sec
ond set victory.
Backed firmly against the wall, Cal would
not go down without a fight. A pair of kills by

Stanford would roar back,
as freshman middle blocker
Inky Ajanku and Burgess
combined for three kills to
help the Card recapture the
lead. This early sequence
proved to be the story of
the set, as neither squad
managed to pull away.
After grabbing a 25-24 lead,
just a point away from win
ning the set, Cal sophomore
Marlee Davis served into
the net, tying the set.
Stanford then managed to
grab a 27-26 lead. Middle
blocker Wopat ended the
set and match for Stanford
with a kill.
Wopat, Burgess and
Bugg keyed an overall
dominant performance
from the Cardinal. Burgess
recorded a team-high 16
kills (.467) to go along with
a solid 13 digs. Wopat added
14 of her own, while Bugg
set the tone with a stellar 50
assists. Overall, it was a
solid performance from the

Card, which is currently
ranked sixth in the country.
Next up for Stanford on
Friday night was the talent
ed group from Salt Lake
City, the Utah Utes (9-6,0-2
Pac-12). It became clear
early on they would put up
more of a fight than Cal.
Utah quickly took control
of the first set, as a couple of
early errors put the
Cardinal in a hole. Utah
sophomore Shelby Dalton
set the pace with five kills in
the first set, leading the
Utes to a 25-17 win.
It looked as though the
second set was going to be a
similar story, as the Utes
jumped out to an early 4-0
lead on four straight attack
errors by Stanford.
However, after falling
behind 8-5, the Card began
to buckle down. Stanford
scored four straight points
of their own, forcing Utah
to call a timeout after a
phenomenal block from
Wopat.
From there, neither
team was able to pull away,
eventually leading to a 21-
20 Utah lead. A pair of kills
from Morgan Boukather
and Burgess put the Card

within a point of tying the
match at one set each.
Burgess then put the set
away with a kill, giving
Stanford a 25-22 victory.
The third set also went to
the Card, as it won 25-23 in
another nail biter. Early on,
it became obvious that this
set was going to mirror the
rest of the match, as neither
Stanford nor Utah could
gain the upper hand.
Stanford managed to pull
ahead, going up 20-15. A
match victory was in sight,
but the Utes had other
plans, scratching and claw
ing to tie the game at 24
apiece. However, Wopat
and Howard each earned a
kill to put Stanford at match
point, and an attack error by
Utah hitter Baily Bartman
gave Stanford the win.
It was a good start to
Pac-12 play for Stanford,
which finished in fourth
place last season. The Card

weekend to take on
Arizona and Arizona State
next weekend in another
pair of conference matches.

Stanford then managed to
grab a 27-26 lead. Middle
blocker Wopat ended the
set and match for Stanford
with a kill.
Wopat, Burgess and
Bugg keyed an overall
dominant performance
from the Cardinal. Burgess
recorded a team-high 16
kills (.467) to go along with
a solid 13 digs. Wopat added
14 of her own, while Bugg
set the tone with a stellar 50
assists. Overall, it was a
solid performance from the

Card, which is currently
ranked sixth in the country.
Next up for Stanford on
Friday night was the talent
ed group from Salt Lake
City, the Utah Utes (9-6,0-2
Pac-12). It became clear
early on they would put up
more of a fight than Cal.
Utah quickly took control
of the first set, as a couple of
early errors put the
Cardinal in a hole. Utah
sophomore Shelby Dalton
set the pace with five kills in
the first set, leading the
Utes to a 25-17 win.
It looked as though the
second set was going to be a
similar story, as the Utes
jumped out to an early 4-0
lead on four straight attack
errors by Stanford.
However, after falling
behind 8-5, the Card began
to buckle down. Stanford
scored four straight points
of their own, forcing Utah
to call a timeout after a
phenomenal block from
Wopat.
From there, neither
team was able to pull away,
eventually leading to a 21-
20 Utah lead. A pair of kills
from Morgan Boukather
and Burgess put the Card

within a point of tying the
match at one set each.
Burgess then put the set
away with a kill, giving
Stanford a 25-22 victory.
The third set also went to
the Card, as it won 25-23 in
another nail biter. Early on,
it became obvious that this
set was going to mirror the
rest of the match, as neither
Stanford nor Utah could
gain the upper hand.
Stanford managed to pull
ahead, going up 20-15. A
match victory was in sight,
but the Utes had other
plans, scratching and claw
ing to tie the game at 24
apiece. However, Wopat
and Howard each earned a
kill to put Stanford at match
point, and an attack error by
Utah hitter Baily Bartman
gave Stanford the win.
It was a good start to
Pac-12 play for Stanford,
which finished in fourth
place last season. The Card
travels to Arizona next
weekend to take on
Arizona and Arizona State
next weekend in another
pair of conference matches.

Freshmen usually have the opportunity to
ease into the bitter Stanford-Cal rivalry,
observing the competitive animosity from a
comfortable and risk-free bench seat. They
are able to acclimate to the heated atmos
phere, a scenario in which one team invari
ably must let their entire school down.
However, this is not the case for many of the
freshmen on the Stanford women's volleyball
team, who've been tossed right into the mid
dle of the rivalry with Cal.
Due to a couple of injuries, most notably
to former All-Pac-12 setter Karissa Cook, a
group of freshmen have seen heavy action for
the Cardinal (10-2,2-0 Pac-12) early on. That
didn't change when the UC-Berkeley Golden

Bears (7-5, 1-1 Pac-12) rolled into town on
Wednesday night, and the talented crop of
freshmen managed to carry Stanford to a
sweep of the Bears.

The Card got it rolling early on, jumping
out to an early 7-2 lead on the strength of
freshman setter Madi Bugg, who distributed
the ball well to the players up front. Stanford
continued to set the tone, going up 11-6. A kill
from freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess,
an ace from classmate Brittany Howard, and
a kill from junior Carly Wopat put Stanford

up 14-6 and forced Cal coach Rich Feller to
call a timeout. The Golden Bears settled
down following the break in play, but weren't
able to overcome the early deficit, as the Card
took the first set by a count of 25-17.
Cal carried the momentum they earned at
the end of the first set over into the second,
hanging with Stanford initially. They forced
an early 5-5 tie before Stanford took over.
Consecutive kills by Howard, Burgess and
Bugg set the tone and the Card cruised from
there, dismantling Cal en route to a 25-17 sec
ond set victory.
Backed firmly against the wall, Cal would
not go down without a fight. A pair of kills by
senior middle blocker Shannon Hawari put
