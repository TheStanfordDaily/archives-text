# INTERMISSION PILOT SEASON
## INTERMISSION'S SLATE OF SHOWS 
### â€” savannah KOPP contact savannah: skopp@stanford. edu 
At Stanford we may be shel
tered from the typical signs
of a new season: the wors
ening weather and leaves changing
color, but the fact remains
autumn is here. And back to
schools means back to the tube
with a host of new TV shows vying
for audience ratings and the
chance to last a full season and
fingers crossed a second season
renewal. Not all shows make it to
sophomore year... A new crop of
TV shows means a new crop of
characters, worlds and possibility
without the security that comes
from watching an already well
established show. Intermission s
compiled a list of not-to-miss
shows between frat-part we
mean units.
Partners on CBS
A new comedy by the creators of
Will and Grace, Partners follows
the professional and personal rela
tionship of two law partners and
longtime best friends: a straight
man and a gay man. While we
could criticize the creators for till
ing similar material for their new
show, they are essentially pulling
from their own experiences. David
Kohan and Max Mutchnick are a
straight man and a gay man who
have been best friends and profes
sional partners since their teen
years. Writing what you know cer
tainly seems to work for these two,
and if they can adapt their style to
the riskier and raunchier comedic
tastes of television audiences since
their O9os hit, and avoid some of
the overdone stereotypes of gay
men on television, then the already

humorous formula maybe just
what audiences want.

The Neighbors on ABC
Dan Fogelman, the seasoned
screenwriter whose repertoire
includes Tangled and Crazy,
Stupid Love is the creator of this
comedy about a human family that
moves into Hidden Hills, a subur
ban neighborhood populated by
aliens disguised as Stepford fami
lies. The aliens go by the names of
professional athletes, bake pies
aplenty and occasionally let their

green skin out to play. This show
looks quirky and different enough
to be worth a first watch. And
skeptics of the suburban-alien
comedy can reference 3rd Rock
From the Sun and Mork &
Mindy as proof of surprising satis
faction.

Elementary on CBS
As in Elementary, my dear
Watson. Just when you thought
the Sherlock revival had run its
race, another modern retelling of
the Sherlock Holmes saga, with a

few changes, peaks over the TV
Guide horizon. Set in modern day
New York City, Watson is played by
Lucy Liu. Despite criticism for
being a rip off of the excellent BBC
miniseries Sherlock, (aren t all
remakes rip offs?), early reviews
suggest Elementary is a fresh take
on both the source material and
the procedural format that CBS
loves.

Last Resort on ABC
This thriller begins with a U.S.
Navy submarine that refuses to
launch a nuclear attack on Pakistan

and becomes a target of the
American government. Deep,
right? The Navy crew forms their
own sovereign nation on an island
and determines to discover why
America has turned on them and
how they can resolve the confu
sion. In the vein of Lost, Last
Resort is a high action, high
drama story that, according to
early reviews, may be less pre
dictable than most television.
Think Homeland meets Lord of
the Flies.

Revolution on NBC
Revolution is a post-apocalyptic
drama from J.J. Abrams, whose last
few shows have been harsh disap
pointments after Lost. Set in an
apocalypse-ravaged American
landscape where families are sepa
rated and technology has stopped
working, this show seems like it
may be too dark to find a secure
American audience in today s
milieu. J.J. Abrams has been suc
cessful in the past, though, so
maybe his writing will pull
through.

The Mindy Project on Fox
A self-aware, awkward comedy cre
ated by and starring the hilarious
Mindy Kaling, of The Office
fame, as a rom-com loving, miser
ably single OBGYN. The Mindy
Project is like New Girl combined
with Scrubs . Mindy turns the oft
dry hospital setting into a wealth of
hilarity by being highly unprofes
sional, focused more on her

romantic disasters and beauty
woes than on things like being
punctuality and propriety with
her patients. Disasters are fun to
watch, and it s about time that
Mindy gets to carry her own
show.
Nashville on ABC
Hayden Panettiere! How we ve
missed you the Raising
Helen re-runs just weren t
doing it anymore! An aging
country music star and a hot
new diva (both blonde) go on
tour together, facing off with
each other to be the most suc
cessful country starlets. As an
exploration of the modern
music scene in country music s
capital, this show will have
some good music (if you re into
country), and some high drama
between records and musicians
and husbands and families.
With Good Christian Batches
cancelled, Nashville will have
to quench our thirst for riotous
southern ladies. That, or Here
Comes Honey 800-Boo!

Stupid Love is the creator of this
comedy about a human family that
moves into Hidden Hills, a subur
ban neighborhood populated by
aliens disguised as Stepford fami
lies. The aliens go by the names of
professional athletes, bake pies
aplenty and occasionally let their

green skin out to play. This show
looks quirky and different enough
to be worth a first watch. And
skeptics of the suburban-alien
comedy can reference 3rd Rock
From the Sun and Mork &
Mindy as proof of surprising satis
faction.

Elementary on CBS
As in Elementary, my dear
Watson. Just when you thought
the Sherlock revival had run its
race, another modern retelling of
the Sherlock Holmes saga, with a

few changes, peaks over the TV
Guide horizon. Set in modern day
New York City, Watson is played by
Lucy Liu. Despite criticism for
being a rip off of the excellent BBC
miniseries Sherlock, (aren t all
remakes rip offs?), early reviews
suggest Elementary is a fresh take
on both the source material and
the procedural format that CBS
loves.

Last Resort on ABC
This thriller begins with a U.S.
Navy submarine that refuses to
launch a nuclear attack on Pakistan

and becomes a target of the
American government. Deep,
right? The Navy crew forms their
own sovereign nation on an island
and determines to discover why
America has turned on them and
how they can resolve the confu
sion. In the vein of Lost, Last
Resort is a high action, high
drama story that, according to
early reviews, may be less pre
dictable than most television.
Think Homeland meets Lord of
the Flies.

Revolution on NBC
Revolution is a post-apocalyptic
drama from J.J. Abrams, whose last
few shows have been harsh disap
pointments after Lost. Set in an
apocalypse-ravaged American
landscape where families are sepa
rated and technology has stopped
working, this show seems like it
may be too dark to find a secure
American audience in today s
milieu. J.J. Abrams has been suc
cessful in the past, though, so
maybe his writing will pull
through.

The Mindy Project on Fox
A self-aware, awkward comedy cre
ated by and starring the hilarious
Mindy Kaling, of The Office
fame, as a rom-com loving, miser
ably single OBGYN. The Mindy
Project is like New Girl combined
with Scrubs . Mindy turns the oft
dry hospital setting into a wealth of
hilarity by being highly unprofes
sional, focused more on her

romantic disasters and beauty
woes than on things like being
punctuality and propriety with
her patients. Disasters are fun to
watch, and it s about time that
Mindy gets to carry her own
show.
Nashville on ABC
Hayden Panettiere! How we ve
missed you the Raising
Helen re-runs just weren t
doing it anymore! An aging
country music star and a hot
new diva (both blonde) go on
tour together, facing off with
each other to be the most suc
cessful country starlets. As an
exploration of the modern
music scene in country music s
capital, this show will have
some good music (if you re into
country), and some high drama
between records and musicians
and husbands and families.
With Good Christian Batches
cancelled, Nashville will have
to quench our thirst for riotous
southern ladies. That, or Here
Comes Honey 800-Boo!

At Stanford we may be shel
tered from the typical signs
of a new season: the wors
ening weather and leaves changing
color, but the fact remains
autumn is here. And back to
schools means back to the tube
with a host of new TV shows vying
for audience ratings and the
chance to last a full season and
fingers crossed a second season
renewal. Not all shows make it to
sophomore year... A new crop of
TV shows means a new crop of
characters, worlds and possibility
without the security that comes
from watching an already well
established show. Intermission s
compiled a list of not-to-miss
shows between frat-part we
mean units.
Partners on CBS
A new comedy by the creators of
Will and Grace, Partners follows
the professional and personal rela
tionship of two law partners and
longtime best friends: a straight
man and a gay man. While we
could criticize the creators for till
ing similar material for their new
show, they are essentially pulling
from their own experiences. David
Kohan and Max Mutchnick are a
straight man and a gay man who
have been best friends and profes
sional partners since their teen
years. Writing what you know cer
tainly seems to work for these two,
and if they can adapt their style to
the riskier and raunchier comedic
tastes of television audiences since
their O9os hit, and avoid some of
the overdone stereotypes of gay
men on television, then the already

humorous formula maybe just
what audiences want.

The Neighbors on ABC
