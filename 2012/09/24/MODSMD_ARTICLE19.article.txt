## Top 5 Ways to Get Professors to Love You 
### 
You want to start this quarter off right: get in with all
the professors you've got ICs (intellectual crushes) on,
make some new pals, memorize the library hours so
you know when to switch from Green to sketchy
Meyer overnights. We love being good students, too,
so follow these five steps to at least give the illusion of
being the best.

Sit in the front
Despite their Nobel Prizes and multiple bestsellers,
Stanford professors are people too, and they don't
want to be ostracized. So go keep them company at
the front of the lecture hall! Go for the second row.
First row is too aggro. They'll be still be able to smell
your grape-scented resume.

Be the Thinking Matters kid
Upperclassmen: Read "The PWR Kid." Everyone
knows the PWR Kid, who would go off on far-reading
tangents during section and force his/her interpreta
tion on the class. There's some good in it, though,
when this kid unites the class against him/her and
creates some interesting moments of power struggling
with the teaching fellows. So, take one for the team
and play the role no one else wants!

Ask questions
Ask lots of questions when you don't understand
things. Ask questions to show how smart you are.
Also, make sure to ask questions after every sentence
the professor says, just so that she doesn't gallop down
her notes without a dilatory glance to the class. Her
go-go juice is gonna help you lose.

Go to office hours
To really get to know your professor, go to their office
hours. Sometimes they get lonely not in the Harold
Bloom sense you filthy bugger! especially if no
one else has questions for them or wants to show up
at 9 a.m. on a Friday. Before you go, make sure to buy
the professor's books so you can get them auto
graphed. We recommend Tobias Wolff's works;
almost as riotous as Tobias Funke. Try to get to know
him by asking questions about everything in the
office, especially framed photographs. Then offer to
take his pet dogs on a walk! Forget about trying to get
references, this is the best kind of networking an
instant assistance position.

Email your professor
It's important to stay in contact with your prof. You
should definitely email them about logistical ques
tions. Professors love getting emails, especially about
things that are already on the syllabus. Stray from tex
ting though, and remember that there is NO situation
when a winky face doesn't mean DTF.
