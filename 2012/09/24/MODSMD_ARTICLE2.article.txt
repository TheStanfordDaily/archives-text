## Groups react to sexual batteries Police Department safety tips draw mixed response 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
In response to a recent string
of local sexual battery cases, the
Palo Alto Police Department has
asked pedestrians to be more
aware of their surroundings and
recommended that "women jog
in pairs or small groups whenev
er possible," referring to a Sept.
19 incident in which an unknown
male suspect groped and
attempted to sexually assault a
female jogger.
Preventative tips like these,
however, may verge on victim
blaming, according to adminis
trators from the Stanford Sexual
Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA) Office and the
Women's Community Center.
"To suggest that someone can
employ certain tactics to ward
off an offender particularly
when caught off guard during
blitz attacks such as these can
be victim-blaming," wrote
Angela Exson, assistant dean of
student life at SARA in an email
to The Daily.
Both groups, however, under
stand the need for public safety
and encourage Stanford students
to do what they need to ensure

their safety.
"We encourage students to
do whatever makes them feel
more safe and empowered in
public spaces and behind closed
doors, but we prefer not to give
advice on self-defense," Exson
said.
The Palo Alto Police
Department reported sexual bat
tery incidents on Aug. 20 in
downtown Palo Alto, on Aug. 29
in the Stanford Shopping Center
parking lot and on Sept. 19 in El
Palo Alto Park. The police
believe the same suspect may
have perpetrated all three inci
dents.
The first two cases happened
in an open area, where the sus
pect grabbed onto a body part
and then fled. Lt. Zachary
Perron of the Palo Alto Police
Department said the latest case
is more concerning because it
involved a victim struggling to
escape a bear hug from behind in
a secluded footpath.
According to Perron, three
cases within a month-long period
are a rarity. A couple hours after
the September case, detectives
posted safety flyers and a
description of the suspect along
the footpath, and last Friday,
detectives returned to the foot
path to interview potential wit
nesses and to raise awareness
