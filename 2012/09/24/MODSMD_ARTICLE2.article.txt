## Groups react to sexual batteries Police Department safety tips draw mixed response 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
In response to a recent string
of local sexual battery cases, the
Palo Alto Police Department has
asked pedestrians to be more
aware of their surroundings and
recommended that "women jog
in pairs or small groups whenev
er possible," referring to a Sept.
19 incident in which an unknown
male suspect groped and
attempted to sexually assault a
female jogger.
Preventative tips like these,
however, may verge on victim
blaming, according to adminis
trators from the Stanford Sexual
Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA) Office and the
Women's Community Center.
"To suggest that someone can
employ certain tactics to ward
off an offender particularly
when caught off guard during
blitz attacks such as these can
be victim-blaming," wrote
Angela Exson, assistant dean of
student life at SARA in an email
to The Daily.
Both groups, however, under
stand the need for public safety
and encourage Stanford students
to do what they need to ensure

their safety.
"We encourage students to
do whatever makes them feel
more safe and empowered in
public spaces and behind closed
doors, but we prefer not to give
advice on self-defense," Exson
said.
The Palo Alto Police
Department reported sexual bat
tery incidents on Aug. 20 in
downtown Palo Alto, on Aug. 29
in the Stanford Shopping Center
parking lot and on Sept. 19 in El
Palo Alto Park. The police
believe the same suspect may
have perpetrated all three inci
dents.
The first two cases happened
in an open area, where the sus
pect grabbed onto a body part
and then fled. Lt. Zachary
Perron of the Palo Alto Police
Department said the latest case
is more concerning because it
involved a victim struggling to
escape a bear hug from behind in
a secluded footpath.
According to Perron, three
cases within a month-long period
are a rarity. A couple hours after
the September case, detectives
posted safety flyers and a
description of the suspect along
the footpath, and last Friday,
detectives returned to the foot
path to interview potential wit
nesses and to raise awareness

about the case.
As the Palo Alto Police
continue their investigation,
Exson said that preventa
tive safety tips should not
be directed towards possi
ble victims.
"Sexual harassment, sex

ual misconduct and sexual
assault are only fully pre
ventable by the offender or
initiator of the act," Exson
said. "Taking preventative
measures to protect oneself
can be effective in some
cases, but it is not always
possible to do so, and some
suggest that it may make
the situation worse."
According to Exson, the
SARA Office discourages
contributing to guilting or

blaming survivors, and
believes that perpetrators
should hold full responsibil
ity.
Fatima Kazmi, associate
dean and director at the
Women's Community
Center, agreed with Exson's
sentiments, especially on
the subject of learning self
defense as a means of pre
vention.
"We don't advocate
using self-defense as a pre

vention measure for a sexu
al assault or rape or rela
tionship abuse because it's
not prevention," Kazmi
said.
"It's more resources and
tools for women and men to
be aware of their surround
ings and to use in cases of
emergencies but I don't
want to conflate it with a
predictor of whether or not
somebody is going to be
attacked because it puts the
onus on the victims instead
of on the perpetrators," she
added.
According to Perron,
another anomaly in the Palo
Alto cases is that the sus
pect was a stranger to all the

victims. He said that usually
in cases of sexual assault or
sexual battery, the victim
recognizes the suspect, as in
cases of date rape.
"In the interests of indi
vidual and community safe
ty — and to fully address
concerns that students may
have about retaliation
victims are encouraged to
report incidents to the
Department of Public
Safety or file a complaint
with the Office of
Community Standards,"
Exson said in response to a
question on what students
should do if they find them
selves victim of someone
they recognize and fear

retaliation.
Exson said that for more
extenuating circumstances,
the SARA Office is explor
ing collaboration with the
University Department of
Public Safety to provide
students in these cases with
on- and off-campus proce
dures.
Meanwhile, as the Palo
Alto suspect is still at large,
the police request members
of the public to report any
information they have
about the suspect or any
other sexual battery cases
to 650-329-2413.

suggest that it may make
the situation worse."
According to Exson, the
SARA Office discourages
contributing to guilting or

blaming survivors, and
believes that perpetrators
should hold full responsibil
ity.
Fatima Kazmi, associate
dean and director at the
Women's Community
Center, agreed with Exson's
sentiments, especially on
the subject of learning self
defense as a means of pre
vention.
"We don't advocate
using self-defense as a pre

vention measure for a sexu
al assault or rape or rela
tionship abuse because it's
not prevention," Kazmi
said.
"It's more resources and
tools for women and men to
be aware of their surround
ings and to use in cases of
emergencies but I don't
want to conflate it with a
predictor of whether or not
somebody is going to be
attacked because it puts the
onus on the victims instead
of on the perpetrators," she
added.
According to Perron,
another anomaly in the Palo
Alto cases is that the sus
pect was a stranger to all the

victims. He said that usually
in cases of sexual assault or
sexual battery, the victim
recognizes the suspect, as in
cases of date rape.
"In the interests of indi
vidual and community safe
ty — and to fully address
concerns that students may
have about retaliation
victims are encouraged to
report incidents to the
Department of Public
Safety or file a complaint
with the Office of
Community Standards,"
Exson said in response to a
question on what students
should do if they find them
selves victim of someone
they recognize and fear

retaliation.
Exson said that for more
extenuating circumstances,
the SARA Office is explor
ing collaboration with the
University Department of
Public Safety to provide
students in these cases with
on- and off-campus proce
dures.
Meanwhile, as the Palo
Alto suspect is still at large,
the police request members
of the public to report any
information they have
about the suspect or any
other sexual battery cases
to 650-329-2413.

In response to a recent string
of local sexual battery cases, the
Palo Alto Police Department has
asked pedestrians to be more
aware of their surroundings and
recommended that "women jog
in pairs or small groups whenev
er possible," referring to a Sept.
19 incident in which an unknown
male suspect groped and
attempted to sexually assault a
female jogger.
Preventative tips like these,
however, may verge on victim
blaming, according to adminis
trators from the Stanford Sexual
Assault and Relationship Abuse
(SARA) Office and the
Women's Community Center.
"To suggest that someone can
employ certain tactics to ward
off an offender particularly
when caught off guard during
blitz attacks such as these can
be victim-blaming," wrote
Angela Exson, assistant dean of
student life at SARA in an email
to The Daily.
Both groups, however, under
stand the need for public safety
and encourage Stanford students
to do what they need to ensure

their safety.
"We encourage students to
do whatever makes them feel
more safe and empowered in
public spaces and behind closed
doors, but we prefer not to give
advice on self-defense," Exson
said.
The Palo Alto Police
Department reported sexual bat
tery incidents on Aug. 20 in
downtown Palo Alto, on Aug. 29
in the Stanford Shopping Center
parking lot and on Sept. 19 in El
Palo Alto Park. The police
believe the same suspect may
have perpetrated all three inci
dents.
The first two cases happened
in an open area, where the sus
pect grabbed onto a body part
and then fled. Lt. Zachary
Perron of the Palo Alto Police
Department said the latest case
is more concerning because it
involved a victim struggling to
escape a bear hug from behind in
a secluded footpath.
According to Perron, three
cases within a month-long period
are a rarity. A couple hours after
the September case, detectives
posted safety flyers and a
description of the suspect along
the footpath, and last Friday,
detectives returned to the foot
path to interview potential wit
nesses and to raise awareness

about the case.
As the Palo Alto Police
continue their investigation,
Exson said that preventa
tive safety tips should not
be directed towards possi
ble victims.
"Sexual harassment, sex

ual misconduct and sexual
assault are only fully pre
ventable by the offender or
initiator of the act," Exson
said. "Taking preventative
measures to protect oneself
can be effective in some
cases, but it is not always
possible to do so, and some
suggest that it may make
the situation worse."
