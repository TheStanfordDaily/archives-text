### 
+6 points for bringing in Mary J. Blige, who's responsible
for teaching all of us the word "percolating" through her
2001 hit "Family Affair." (Throwback music video worth
watching, by the way.)
-4 for the lack of a "THIS IS SPARTA" joke from (or
about) Cory Booker. Mayor of Newark (and Stanford
alum) Cory Booker delivered a rousing speech on the
opening night of the DNC, which concluded with the catchy
refrain: "THIS IS our platform! THIS IS our American mission
... THIS IS the demand from the next generation..."
+l5 for the Obama family background music choices. We
saw that passive-aggressive
move. Playing (Obama sup
porter, mind you!) Tom Petty s
"I Won't Back Down" before
the president's speech was on
point, and big ups to whoever
made the call to play Beyonce
at the end of Michelle's speech.
Beyonce isn't the only power
wife telling those independ
ents "to the left / to the left."
+2O to whoever chose to
include the "Carolina Raptor

Center" in the official DNC
guide to activities around
Charlotte. Full disclosure
though: It's a preserve for large
birds of prey. No velociraptors
to be found here (except
James Carville, if you're lucky).
-3 for the not-so-subtle sub
liminal messaging in the
choice to blast Journey's
"Don't Stop Believing"
between prime-time speeches
on opening night.
+5 for the Bill-Barack hug that
would make Ari Gold proud.
(Incidentally, and for those of
you who are "Entourage"
ignorant, Ari Gold's character
is based on Rahm Emanuel's
brother, Ari Emanuel.)
Intermission can always get
behind a little former-on
current PDA: Presidential
Displays of Affection.
+3 to the Democratic up
and-comers for keeping the
focus on Obama and this
election. The one major
exception to this trend was
for Karina Castro's adorable
hair flipping during her
dad's keynote address.
Castro 2016? More like
Karina Castro 2052!
