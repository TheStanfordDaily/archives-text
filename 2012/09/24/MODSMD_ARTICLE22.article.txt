+3O points for the CNN Grill, the RNC's hottest and exclu
sively A-list hangout. This pop-up bar and grill hosted the
Gingrich, Santorum and Romney families (one wonders
what they order at the bar), Rudy Giuliani and NBC legend
Tom Brokaw, among others. The Grill is notorious for its
open bar, strict bouncer, and lively scene from 5 p.m. until
the bar's 1 a.m. last call (just like Stanfy!). We've heard
reports that University of South Florida's KA chapter
stepped up to host the post-closing time party scene at their
similarly isolated house. Intermission expects no less frat
tastic than that!
