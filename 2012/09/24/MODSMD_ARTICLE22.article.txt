+3O points for the CNN Grill, the RNC's hottest and exclu
sively A-list hangout. This pop-up bar and grill hosted the
Gingrich, Santorum and Romney families (one wonders
what they order at the bar), Rudy Giuliani and NBC legend
Tom Brokaw, among others. The Grill is notorious for its
open bar, strict bouncer, and lively scene from 5 p.m. until
the bar's 1 a.m. last call (just like Stanfy!). We've heard
reports that University of South Florida's KA chapter
stepped up to host the post-closing time party scene at their
similarly isolated house. Intermission expects no less frat
tastic than that!
-8 points for including 3
Doors Down in the RNC
organized entertainment. Is
this the early 2000s!? Not
that surprising after a com
missioned 3DD National
Guard music video ad, but
still. We were tempted to
subtract an extra four
points for the RNC's adver
tising blurb: "From that
first explosive burst of
Kryptonite which ignited
their storied career at the
top of last decade, to subse
quent multi-platinum
albums and a nonstop
touring regimen that finds
them still notching shows
around the world at a

record pace, 3 Doors Down
has earned a hard-fought
pedigree as one of rock's
most exciting and authentic
radio icons." #LOL. SCN,
sounds like you should
book these guys for Frost,
no? Their schedule is prob
ably wide open ...
+6 for hosting Lynard
Skynard, because who
doesn't love "Sweet Home
Alabama"? Intermission
would actually be a-okay
with Lynard Skynard at
Frost, for the record.
+1 sympathy/pity point
because "Here Comes
Honey 800 Boo!" was on at
the same time as the RNC.

Its ratings topped the
RNC's by a pretty substan
tial margin; the "Toddlers
and Tiaras" star drew 2.9
million viewers, while only
1.2 million watched the
opening night of the RNC.
We know that's a program
ming blunder, but can't
Rupert Murdoch do some
thing about it?
-10 for the Eastwood
Adventure through time,
space and invisibility. Point
breakdown for this one is
as follows;
-5 for creating the opportu
nity for Barack Obama's
response via Twitter; "This
seat's taken," complete with a

fitting photo, which became
the most retweeted tweet of
the RNC. (Really, we should
+lO to the Dems for the sly
"Forrest Gump" allusion, but
making Mitt Forrest cancels
that out). Meanwhile, #smh
and #facepalm were trend
ing topics among
Republican strategists.
-5 for distracting from the
Republican candidate in a
big way: 20 percent of
viewers polled cited
Eastwood's speech as the
convention highlight,
while only 17 percent
remembered Romney's
speech as the highlight of
the convention. Even

Scarlett Johannsen didn't
upstage Barack at the
DNC! Ouch.
+9 for hosting the RNC in
the (almost) strip club
capital of the world. Little
known fact (to me, any
way): Tampa, Fla., has the
third-most strip clubs per
capita of any city in the
world! It's close behind
Las Vegas, which takes the
top spot, and the
Cincinnati metro area,
which is No. 2. Who knew?

+3 for whoever came up
with the "GOParty Card,"
which, sadly, is just a dis
count pamphlet for a vari
ety of restaurants, bars, and
trinket stores around
Tampa. Now that the
RNC's over, any chance we
can we co-opt that name
for something better at
Stanford?
