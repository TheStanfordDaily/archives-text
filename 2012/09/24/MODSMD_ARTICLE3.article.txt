## Meet the new freshmen dean Robert Urstein takes post formerly held by Dean Julie 
### â€” Catherine Zaw 
- Robert Urstein will begin his first day as
Stanford's new dean of freshmen and undergrad
uate advising next Monday, taking the place of
Julie Lythcott-Haims 'B9, who stepped down from
the position in June. The University began a
national search for Lythcott-Haims' replacement
last March when she announced she would be
leaving the post at the end of the academic year to
pursue a master of fine arts in writing from the
California College of the Arts in San Francisco.
That search ended on Sept. 13 when the
University announced that Urstein, former assis
tant dean for the doctoral program at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB),
had won the position. Urstein talked to The Daily
about his experience prior to arriving at the Farm,
participating in New Student Orientation (NSO)
and succeeding the campus celebrity commonly
known as "Dean Julie."

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is your academ
ic background or previous affiliation to Stanford?
Robert Urstein (RU): I've been at Stanford for
eight years, and am the assistant dean at the
Graduate School of Business. I also teach a class
called "Critical and Analytical Thinking," which is
one of the required classes for first-year [business
students]. I've been working with undergraduate
advising for seven years.

TSD: What experience do you have that you feel
qualifies you for leading the school as dean of
undergraduate advising?
RU: Before Stanford, in 2004, 1 was a high school
English teacher and chair of the English depart
ment at San Francisco University High School, an
independent school in San Francisco, where I also

coached lacrosse. Before that, I got my doctorate
in American studies and was teaching undergrad
uate students at the University of lowa. I've spent
my time teaching undergraduates, graduates and
high school students, so I'm familiar with where
students are coming from and what they would
like to do while they're [at Stanford].

TSD: How has NSO been thus far?
RU: NSO is a great introduction to Stanford, see
ing Stanford through the eyes of students ... It's
a great opportunity to see more context to what
I'm doing in [Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR)], which is fantastic, and I can't
say enough about Stanford's UAR. All the volun
teers and leaders [have] ... done a fantastic job
introducing students to Stanford.

TSD: What are you most excited about starting in
the new year?
RU: I think I'm most enthusiastic about the
opportunity to engage with more students, work
with my colleagues at the UAR and the entire fac
ulty, and enhancing how Stanford undergraduates
can work in the University. I'm really looking for
ward to meeting and interacting with people in a
broader community than at the GSB.

TSD: What are your plans for any new projects in
the works from undergraduate advising?
RU: I don't have a specific agenda yet, and I'm
not completely aware about what opportunities
there are. It's the beginning of my time in UAR;
I'm learning a lot and I'm fortunate to have a
great group of colleagues in the UAR and [the
