## Program encourages voter registration 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
The Haas Center for Public Service,
Residential Education (ResEd) and nine
other Stanford departments have part
nered with UVote to encourage voter regis
tration during New Student Orientation
(NSO).
Haas Center Executive Director Tom
Schnaubelt and Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman met with represen
tatives from UVote in late August and
decided to bring the program to campus for
NSO.
"We are hoping to take advantage of the
opportunity and buzz around this year's
election, but we are also hoping to continue
doing this every year," Schnaubelt said.
Student volunteers and professionals
from the Haas Center and ResEd run the
program. Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Dean of ResEd
Deborah Golder said that the partnership
between ResEd, the Haas Center and
UVote seemed natural.
"The citizenship link feels really logical
to us... we feel that students have the
responsibility to be an informed electorate
and an informed citizen of Stanford too,"
she said.
Zac Sargeant, assistant director of
ResEd, attributed the choice of implement
ing the program during NSO to taking

advantage of the excitement surrounding
the arrival of the Class of 2016.
"There's a lot to be able to tie into NSO
where... there are big groups of people
congregated in specific places," Sargeant
said.
UVote started at Northwestern
University's new student orientation in
2011, where 90 percent of the incoming
freshman class registered to vote.
According to Sargeant, one of the great
successes of UVote's efforts at
Northwestern was that it became almost
"unavoidable" for new freshmen to register
to vote. The Stanford program aims create
a similar effect by placing voter registration
tables in dining halls and other crowded
areas around campus.
As of Friday, between 500 and 700 peo
ple had registered, including upperclass
men, faculty and staff, according to
Schnaubelt.
Stanford's UVote program does not
have a goal for a number or percentage of
the student body registered.
"Our goal was not a specific number, but
we really just wanted to be a presence this
year," Sargeant said.
UVote is different from other voter reg
istration efforts in that it is directly affiliat
ed with the University and allows students
to register in almost any state. UVote han
dles all the paperwork and can have an
absentee ballot sent to the registrant's

Stanford P.O. Box.
"[UVote] involves way fewer clicks in
terms of going from point A to point B to
point C... with UVote it's all right there,"
Schnaubelt said.
Golder noted that UVote and voter reg
istration were only the first steps in ensur
ing that Stanford students fully participate
in the political process.
"To me, there are three steps in this
process," Golder said. "One, to be sure that
you are registered. Two, to make sure you
are informed... and three, to actually get
out and vote."
Golder held that after UVote leaves
campus, student groups should take the role
of ensuring that students are active political
participants. Groups like the Stanford
Democrats, Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) and Stanford
in Government have already joined in
voter registration and education efforts.
ResEd and the Haas Center both
emphasized that UVote is a nonpartisan
effort with the goal of simply mobilizing all
voters, not voters for a specific party.
"UVote does a good job of making sure
it is nonpartisan and that it keeps to the
facts of just making sure that you are regis
tered ... and [getting] to the polls," Buzay
said.
