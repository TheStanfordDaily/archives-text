## Courses study Nov. elections Political science and communication departments cover Presidential race 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU STAFF WRITER 
From mock-professional newsrooms to mod
erated community-wide debates, fall quarter's
course offerings are ripe with election-year
buzz.
This year, courses like POLISCI 51K:
Election 2012; COMM 104W: Reporting,
Writing, and Understanding the News; and
COMM 162: Campaigns, Voting, Media, and
Elections are aimed towards covering the
November 2012 election with students from
every political persuasion.
Election 2012, a new 1-unit class, will be
taught and moderated by associate professor of
political science Rob Reich, Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) lecturer
Jim Steyer and history professor David
Kennedy. The trio will explore major election
topics such as foreign policy, the economy, the
Supreme Court and campaign strategy.
"This is a very important election," said
Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense
Media. "Stanford is just the heart of leadership
on a lot of these issues, both from faculty and
some of the alums. I think
[the class] is a great way to
tie some of the things that
students care about in the
Stanford community to a
larger cause."
The course will feature
high-profile speakers,
including Stanford
President John Hennessy,
economics professor John
Taylor and California
Lieutenant Governor Gavin
Newsom.
Anne Evered 'l5, a first
time voter, is excited about
the lineup of distinguished
speakers.
"I really wanted to learn
about the major election
and I feel like [POLISCI
51K] is a good mode to do
that because it's got great
professors," Evered said.
Reich hopes that the
course will appeal to stu
dents through an experi
mental aspect: combining
Stanford students enrolled
for credit with community
members enrolled via
Stanford's Continuing
Studies program. A total of
600 people are registered for
the course.
"It raises the possibility
of engaging students in con
versations about the elec
tion, and about politics in
general, with people from
the surrounding community
and from a great diversity of
ages," Reich wrote in an

email to The Daily.
Through COMM 162:
Campaigns, Voting, Media,
and Elections class, commu
nications professor Shanto
Iyengar and his students will
examine media politics and
how the role of the press is
changing with regard to
election campaigns. The
class has been offered at
Stanford for a decade.
"We will use the 2012
campaign as an opportunity
to test propositions about
campaign strategy and the
behavior of journalists, can
didates and voters," Iyengar
said in an email to The
Daily.
Similarly, COMM 104W:
Reporting, Writing, and
Understanding the News,
taught by McClatchy
Visiting Lecturer Janine
Zacharia, will explore the
election through the lens of
the media yet with more
hands-on reporting than
journalism theory.
COMM 104W under
graduate students will col
laborate with students from
the Graduate Program in
Journalism for local and
national election coverage.
"Part of what I'm trying
to do with the course is
expose Stanford students to
issues that they may not
choose to expose them
selves to," Zacharia said. "I
get a lot of joy out of seeing
students reading about the
news, thinking about the
news, thinking about foreign
affairs and politics."
On Nov. 6, COMM
104W undergraduates and

journalism graduates alike
will work in groups to cover
different aspects of the elec
tion in an all-night news
room experience.
Learning how to ask
questions, Zacharia stressed,
is one of the key compo
nents of her class. She added
that she intends to familiar
ize students with political
issues in addition to teach
ing reporting basics.
"I would love to see
Stanford students be a little
more engaged with the
news," Zacharia said. "I
understand that not every
one picks up a physical
newspaper anymore but
everybody is on their
devices ... What I gather
from my class is that most
people are getting stuff
through Facebook but it's
not enough."
Zacharia believes that
with the upcoming election,
students will get more
engaged. Along with
COMM 162 and POLISCI
51K, COMM 104W strives
to inspire not only greater
political awareness among
students but also greater
political involvement and
participation.
"Stanford is going pro
duce the nation's future
leaders, and I think it's espe
cially important that stu
dents be aware and engaged
with political issues, foreign
policy issues and the rest,"
Zacharia said.

nications professor Shanto
Iyengar and his students will
examine media politics and
how the role of the press is
changing with regard to
election campaigns. The
class has been offered at
Stanford for a decade.
"We will use the 2012
campaign as an opportunity
to test propositions about
campaign strategy and the
behavior of journalists, can
didates and voters," Iyengar
said in an email to The
Daily.
Similarly, COMM 104W:
Reporting, Writing, and
Understanding the News,
taught by McClatchy
Visiting Lecturer Janine
Zacharia, will explore the
election through the lens of
the media yet with more
hands-on reporting than
journalism theory.
COMM 104W under
graduate students will col
laborate with students from
the Graduate Program in
Journalism for local and
national election coverage.
"Part of what I'm trying
to do with the course is
expose Stanford students to
issues that they may not
choose to expose them
selves to," Zacharia said. "I
get a lot of joy out of seeing
students reading about the
news, thinking about the
news, thinking about foreign
affairs and politics."
On Nov. 6, COMM
104W undergraduates and

journalism graduates alike
will work in groups to cover
different aspects of the elec
tion in an all-night news
room experience.
Learning how to ask
questions, Zacharia stressed,
is one of the key compo
nents of her class. She added
that she intends to familiar
ize students with political
issues in addition to teach
ing reporting basics.
"I would love to see
Stanford students be a little
more engaged with the
news," Zacharia said. "I
understand that not every
one picks up a physical
newspaper anymore but
everybody is on their
devices ... What I gather
from my class is that most
people are getting stuff
through Facebook but it's
not enough."
Zacharia believes that
with the upcoming election,
students will get more
engaged. Along with
COMM 162 and POLISCI
51K, COMM 104W strives
to inspire not only greater
political awareness among
students but also greater
political involvement and
participation.
"Stanford is going pro
duce the nation's future
leaders, and I think it's espe
cially important that stu
dents be aware and engaged
with political issues, foreign
policy issues and the rest,"
Zacharia said.

From mock-professional newsrooms to mod
erated community-wide debates, fall quarter's
course offerings are ripe with election-year
buzz.
This year, courses like POLISCI 51K:
Election 2012; COMM 104W: Reporting,
Writing, and Understanding the News; and
COMM 162: Campaigns, Voting, Media, and
Elections are aimed towards covering the
November 2012 election with students from
every political persuasion.
Election 2012, a new 1-unit class, will be
taught and moderated by associate professor of
political science Rob Reich, Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) lecturer
Jim Steyer and history professor David
Kennedy. The trio will explore major election
topics such as foreign policy, the economy, the
Supreme Court and campaign strategy.
"This is a very important election," said
Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense
Media. "Stanford is just the heart of leadership
on a lot of these issues, both from faculty and
some of the alums. I think
[the class] is a great way to
tie some of the things that
students care about in the
Stanford community to a
larger cause."
The course will feature
high-profile speakers,
including Stanford
President John Hennessy,
economics professor John
Taylor and California
Lieutenant Governor Gavin
Newsom.
Anne Evered 'l5, a first
time voter, is excited about
the lineup of distinguished
speakers.
"I really wanted to learn
about the major election
and I feel like [POLISCI
51K] is a good mode to do
that because it's got great
professors," Evered said.
Reich hopes that the
course will appeal to stu
dents through an experi
mental aspect: combining
Stanford students enrolled
for credit with community
members enrolled via
Stanford's Continuing
Studies program. A total of
600 people are registered for
the course.
"It raises the possibility
of engaging students in con
versations about the elec
tion, and about politics in
general, with people from
the surrounding community
and from a great diversity of
ages," Reich wrote in an

email to The Daily.
