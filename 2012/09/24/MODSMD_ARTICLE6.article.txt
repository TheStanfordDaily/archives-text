# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
## New website is just the beginning 
### 
Dear Readers,

This weekend, you may have noticed
that our site was down for some time
and returned Saturday afternoon
with a visual overhaul. This new website
will be a great benefit to readers and Daily
staffers immediately and in the long run as
we continue to realize its full potential.
The site will immediately boost the
user experience, as it has improved land
ing pages, featured story boxes, similar sto
ries at the bottom of articles and expand
ed author pages. Photos (and eventually
videos) will take a more central
role in the presentation of our
content. You can now browse sto
ries by most-viewed, most-com
mented and editors' picks, all
making for a better reader expe
rience.
But the site's current benefits
pale in comparison to what we
have in store and what this site
will enable us to do. The decision
to invest in a new site is the first
step in a transition for our organ
ization to work as a truly mod
ern, efficient newsroom; while we
have flirted with apps and site
redesigns before, they have
always been inexplicably
detached from our production
process.
A powerful new website
means nothing if we don't change
our mindset and tailor our con
tent to the different mediums we

are using.
The site accompanies a reor
ganization of our editorial struc
ture away from a static system
that was based on our print
schedule to a more fluid, digital
first strategy that will enable us
to push content around the clock.
We have hired web and layout
editors to make sure that our
content is displayed in the most
visually appealing and interactive
ways in both print and on the
web. We have hired a multimedia
editor with professional-level
experience in producing videos
and are working on exciting con
tent collaboration projects with
other organizations.
While we are proud of what
we have accomplished so far,
there is still an enormous amount
of work to do as we work to cre
ate innovative new methods to
shape the community dialogue
while continuing to produce the
top-notch content we have prid
ed ourselves on for the last 120
years.
There are so many people to

thank for this great new site: the
Friends of The Stanford Daily for
their generous funding, Daily
executive editor Brendan
O'Byrne and COO Margaret
Rawson for their months of tire
less work in bringing this project
to fruition, and the great Semißig
team of John McConnico, David
Sharpe, Wes Garcia and Kathy
Riani for helping us along the
way.
If you would like to get
involved with The Daily, as a stu
dent contributor or another publi
cation looking to collaborate,
please email me at eic@stanford
daily.com. If you like the new site
and want to support us as we con
tinue to grow and work on excit
ing projects, please consider
donating your time and/or money
at coo@stanforddaily.com.
Thank you, and enjoy the first
iteration of the beautiful new
site.
