## EDITORIAL Introducing the new Editorial Board 
### 
The Stanford Daily
Editorial Board repre
sents the collective opin
ion of this newspaper. Our job is
to weigh in on issues of pressing
campus importance and to con
tribute a thoughtful, reasoned
voice to current debates and dis
cussions about Stanford life, pol
itics and culture.
This year, the Board is under
going significant changes, and
we'd like to take the space below
to explain them. In the past, the
editor-in-chief selected a student
to be the chair of the Editorial
Board, who then selected other
students to sit on the board. The
entire Editorial Board was inde
pendent of The Daily's staff. The
Daily Editorial Board will now
be comprised of a few select
Daily staffers, though its meet
ings will be open to the entire
staff and its opinions will repre
sent those of the entire staff.
We feel that this shift in the
Board's composition will add clar
ity and coherence to our opinions
and more effectively convey the
feelings of this paper. Our
reporters and editors have unique
access to University administra
tors, student government leaders,
professors and others. We hope to
leverage that access, along with
the knowledge and experience of
our reporters and editors, to pres
ent you with accountable and
informed opinions.
The Editorial Board will con
sist of Daily executive editor
Brendan O'Byrne, managing
editor of opinions Miles

Unterreiner, our managing edi
tor of news Marwa Farag, man
aging editor of sports Miles
Bennett-Smith, and the chair of
the Editorial Board, editor in
chief Billy Gallagher.
As we implement these
changes, we shall seek to protect
and maintain a few core values
that countless Boards before us
have shared. We will uphold this
paper's commitment to honest
reporting, to fair and decent
argument, and to thoughtful
analysis of the issues that most
affect our readers. We will fully
research and vet our arguments.
And we will present any oppos
ing convictions in a charitable
and balanced manner. The opin
ions we present in this space
should be the start of conversa
tions, not the definitive state
ment on a subject. We welcome
opposing op-eds at opinions@
stanforddaily.com.
When our work fails to meet
these high standards, we expect
you to let us know. The Stanford
Daily is a student-run organiza
tion that is wholly independent
from the University. This inde
pendence is crucial to our mis
sion and though it gives us the
ability to write and reason freely,
it also makes us beholden to you,
our readers. We expect you to let
us know when we fail to meet
the high editorial standards you
expect from this newspaper, and
we look forward to having con
versations about the issues that
challenge Stanford and its stu
dents the most.
