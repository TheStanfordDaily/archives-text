## You must Occupy the Econ Department 
### PETER MCDONALD '11 
Students of Econ 1A and IB:
Maybe you are taking intro
ductory economics because
of a genuine interest. Maybe you
are in one of the three majors that
are not economics but that require
it. Either way, you will be told that
you are learning about a science.
You are not. Sciences, even social
sciences, are empirical. Instead,
you will be indoctrinated into an
ideology responsible for much of
the inequality, and indeed much of
the injustice, we see today, and you
must resist it.
Neoclassical economics is an
outdated pseudoscience that plays
on debunked notions of human
nature for the purpose of justify
ing exploitative practices and has
no place at a university whose mis
sion includes charges to "promote
the public welfare" and to teach
"the rights and advantages of
association and cooperation."
Indeed, neoclassical economics is
not concerned with whether or
not its teachings benefit everyone;
it is only concerned with efficien
cy, and the fate of the public wel
fare is secondary. Furthermore, at
the core of neoclassical economics
is the individual utility maximiza
tion principle, which is a fancy way
of saying "assume everyone in the
world is greedy." This assumption
persists despite its debunking
through the work of Elinor
Ostrom, and the mistrust it fosters
runs directly counter to the idea of
promoting cooperation.
I know that the Occupy move
ment has been met with a great
deal of derision here at Stanford (I
would expect no less at the nerve
center for neoliberal capitalism),
but the movement for economic
justice, like any movement, must
extend into the intellectual realm,
into the classroom, and there is no
place where that extension is
more imperative than here. (Fun
fact: Did you know that the guy
who wrote your economics text
book, John Taylor, is Mitt
Romney's economics adviser? His
office is room 248 in the Econ
building Landau not SIEPR.

You should drop by and ask him
about Mitt Romney's belief that
his election in and of itself will
save the economy.) Don't just
challenge your professors; organ
ize, occupy, educate, and agitate,
like the students before you who
fought for the creation of the
CSRE department and who chal
lenged the Western Culture
requirements, to bring about the
change that needs to happen, to
bring about a curriculum that not
just teaches but also demonstrates
how compassion and cooperation
work in interpersonal relations.
Obviously, a great struggle lies
before you, but any change you
make here will be felt the nation,
and indeed the world, over.
To be clear, I am not indicting
the work of all economists ever.
Career economists are not the
problem (except for the ones who
take lots of money from large
banks to produce research of
questionable scholarship), nor is
the problem the advanced-level
courses. The problem are the
courses forced upon any student
who desires a career in public
service, courses whose implica
tions and subtexts will be remem
bered long after its details fade. It
is for that reason that I address
this message to the students (past,
present and future) of those cours
es.
Though I have spent the last
year doing so, it is increasingly a
ridiculous task for me to engage in
student activism (having graduat
ed in 2011), though I am here to
support your efforts in any way I
can; feel free to look me up on
Facebook. As I let go, however, I
do so with faith faith in the stu
dent body to transcend apathy
and the demands of the quarter
system, faith in its integrity and
faith in its ability to organize in a
much more effective fashion than
the wimps at Harvard who walked
out of their introductory econom
ics class muttering something
about Keynes only to walk back in
the next day. This is bigger than
Keynes. There is a whole host of
literature just ripe for the
Googling about why we need to
do away with neoclassical eco
nomics. In fact, when I took Econ

IA, they spent the last week ask
ing exactly that question.
Remember, it only takes six peo
ple to start a student group, which
is five more than it takes to start a
revolution.
P.S. Looking for an organiza
tional structure? I suggest direct
democracy. It's done wonders for
Quebec.

Ostrom, and the mistrust it fosters
runs directly counter to the idea of
promoting cooperation.
I know that the Occupy move
ment has been met with a great
deal of derision here at Stanford (I
would expect no less at the nerve
center for neoliberal capitalism),
but the movement for economic
justice, like any movement, must
extend into the intellectual realm,
into the classroom, and there is no
place where that extension is
more imperative than here. (Fun
fact: Did you know that the guy
who wrote your economics text
book, John Taylor, is Mitt
Romney's economics adviser? His
office is room 248 in the Econ
building Landau not SIEPR.

You should drop by and ask him
about Mitt Romney's belief that
his election in and of itself will
save the economy.) Don't just
challenge your professors; organ
ize, occupy, educate, and agitate,
like the students before you who
fought for the creation of the
CSRE department and who chal
lenged the Western Culture
requirements, to bring about the
change that needs to happen, to
bring about a curriculum that not
just teaches but also demonstrates
how compassion and cooperation
work in interpersonal relations.
Obviously, a great struggle lies
before you, but any change you
make here will be felt the nation,
and indeed the world, over.
To be clear, I am not indicting
the work of all economists ever.
Career economists are not the
problem (except for the ones who
take lots of money from large
banks to produce research of
questionable scholarship), nor is
the problem the advanced-level
courses. The problem are the
courses forced upon any student
who desires a career in public
service, courses whose implica
tions and subtexts will be remem
bered long after its details fade. It
is for that reason that I address
this message to the students (past,
present and future) of those cours
es.
Though I have spent the last
year doing so, it is increasingly a
ridiculous task for me to engage in
student activism (having graduat
ed in 2011), though I am here to
support your efforts in any way I
can; feel free to look me up on
Facebook. As I let go, however, I
do so with faith faith in the stu
dent body to transcend apathy
and the demands of the quarter
system, faith in its integrity and
faith in its ability to organize in a
much more effective fashion than
the wimps at Harvard who walked
out of their introductory econom
ics class muttering something
about Keynes only to walk back in
the next day. This is bigger than
Keynes. There is a whole host of
literature just ripe for the
Googling about why we need to
do away with neoclassical eco
nomics. In fact, when I took Econ

IA, they spent the last week ask
ing exactly that question.
Remember, it only takes six peo
ple to start a student group, which
is five more than it takes to start a
revolution.
P.S. Looking for an organiza
tional structure? I suggest direct
democracy. It's done wonders for
Quebec.
