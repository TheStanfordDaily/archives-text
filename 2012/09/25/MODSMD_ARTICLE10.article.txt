# STREAK SNAPPED
## STANFORD FALLS ON ROAD AGAINST CAROLINA 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Knocking off the No. 1 team in the
country is a tough enough feat on its
own. When you're down two of your
best players and on the road in a hos
tile environment, it's not a recipe for
success.
Despite an early scoring strike that
had North Carolina's squad squirming,
Stanford's field hockey team couldn't
quite spring the upset over a talented
Tar Heels squad on Sunday, ultimately
losing 6-2.

The Cardinal (6-4) came into the
matchup red hot, winner of five straight
games, including a 2-0 victory over
Radford on Saturday.
And when senior defender Becky
Dru's cross inside the circle set up fresh
man Jessica Chisholm for a tip-in goal
just eight minutes into Sunday's game,
Stanford could smell another big win.

But the lead was very short-lived.
Just 19 seconds after Chisholm's shot
found the net, North Carolina (9-1)
responded with a goal of its own after
taking the faceoff and earning a penalty
corner. Kelsey Kolojejchick a two
time All-American midfielder and
member of the U.S. National Team pro
gram â€” took the push-in and tied the
contest at 1-1 with a strike from the top
of the circle.
The UNC go-ahead goal came a few
minutes later, in the 14th minute, when
