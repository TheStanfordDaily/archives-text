# STREAK SNAPPED
## STANFORD FALLS ON ROAD AGAINST CAROLINA 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Knocking off the No. 1 team in the
country is a tough enough feat on its
own. When you're down two of your
best players and on the road in a hos
tile environment, it's not a recipe for
success.
Despite an early scoring strike that
had North Carolina's squad squirming,
Stanford's field hockey team couldn't
quite spring the upset over a talented
Tar Heels squad on Sunday, ultimately
losing 6-2.

The Cardinal (6-4) came into the
matchup red hot, winner of five straight
games, including a 2-0 victory over
Radford on Saturday.
And when senior defender Becky
Dru's cross inside the circle set up fresh
man Jessica Chisholm for a tip-in goal
just eight minutes into Sunday's game,
Stanford could smell another big win.

But the lead was very short-lived.
Just 19 seconds after Chisholm's shot
found the net, North Carolina (9-1)
responded with a goal of its own after
taking the faceoff and earning a penalty
corner. Kelsey Kolojejchick a two
time All-American midfielder and
member of the U.S. National Team pro
gram — took the push-in and tied the
contest at 1-1 with a strike from the top
of the circle.
The UNC go-ahead goal came a few
minutes later, in the 14th minute, when

Senior defender Becky Dru became the 14th player in Stanford field hockey history to earn first-team All-American
honors last season and again leads the team in points this season with two goals and six assists for the No. 11 Cardinal.
a dangerous ball across the
cage found Tar Heels senior
Jaclyn Radvany for an easy
score. The floodgates
seemed to open for North
Carolina, as Kolojejchick
scored her second goal of
the match on a drive into the
circle and UNC struck twice
more before halftime to
make the score 5-1.
The halftime stats were
telling North Carolina
outshot the Cardinal 9-3 and
had seven penalty corners to
Stanford's two.
Even though the Tar
Heels continued to move the
ball well in the second half,
both sides buckled down on
defense and Stanford was
still very much in the game
late. In the 55th minute, Dru
powered up on another shot
from a penalty corner and

Lauren Becker managed to
deflect it in past the Carolina
goalie to cut the deficit to
three and energize the visit
ing side.
Once again, however, the
Tar Heels showed why they
have won two NCAA
Championships in the last
five years, bumping the lead
back up to a more comfort
able four-goal margin that
would stand as the final
score.
While it wasn't the result
Stanford was looking for, the
Cardinal has to be pleased
with a competitive result
against a quality opponent
after the team lost three
straight early-season games
for the first time since 2008.
That included a double
overtime loss to a different
No. 1 the University of
Maryland —in the second
game of the year.
"I think our team is
showing growth, trying to
improve their game as indi
viduals and learning from

mistakes," head coach Tara
Danielson said.
Finding openings has not
been the team's problem, as
Stanford is outshooting its
opponents 161-91 and earn
ing penalty corners at a good
clip. But the Card has
allowed 15 goals in its four
losses, while giving up just
four goals in its six wins.
With the return of
starters Kelsey Harbin and
Maddie Secco imminent
both competed in the recent
ly completed Junior Pan
American Championships
Stanford will need to step
up its defense as conference
play begins this Friday
against rival California. The
Bears are relying on several
young players this season
but will have home-turf
advantage, with the game
slated for noon from
Berkeley on the Pac-12
Network.
