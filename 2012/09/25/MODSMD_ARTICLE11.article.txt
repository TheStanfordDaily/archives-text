# Senior sit-down
## AN INTERVIEW WITH KARISSA COOK 
### 
In her first year as the volleyball team's
starting setter, senior Karissa Cook earned
Pac-12 honorable mention honors and
ranked 20th in the country with 11.32 assists
per set. One of the Cardinal's most respect
ed players this year, Cook has been side
lined by an injury but was still named a can
didate for the Lowe's Senior CLASS
Award. The Daily sat down with Cook to
talk all things Stanford volleyball.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Being injured is
always tough how optimistic are you
about your chances of getting back on the
court soon?

Karissa Cook (KC): I am very optimistic
about my chances of getting back on the
court soon. The goal is to be back as soon as
possible, and we have the most talented ath
letic trainers, physical therapists and physi
cians making that very possible.

TSD: This season has definitely started well
for the team, considering that you have won
your last seven games. How do you feel
about your chances going forward?

KC: Our team is not only talented this year,
but we are also very deep. Everyone on the
team is capable of coming into big matches
and contributing, and going forward into a
long season, that's often what makes the big
difference. Everyone is pushing each other
in practice, in the weight room and on the
court, and if we can keep that same momen
tum we will be a force to be reckoned with.

TSD: The freshmen have gotten off to a
scorching start so far and have certainly
made the adjustment to Division I play
well. How impressed have you been with
their performance? Will the team continue
to rely upon them going forward?

KC: I am especially proud of our freshman
class. We've already needed them to step up
in tough games and in new roles, and
they've proven that they're a crucial piece
of the puzzle.

TSD: Heading into your senior season, you
were named as one of the top 30 candidates
for the 2012 Senior CLASS Award. What
does this honor mean to you?

KC: I'm very grateful to be considered a
part of such a wonderful and humbling
group of people, I'm still in denial about
being a senior though, so I'm assuming it's
all part of an elaborate prank.

TSD: Looking back on your career thus
far, what has been your best volleyball
memory?

KC: My best volleyball memory is the
moment that [coach] John [Dunning] called
me and told me that I was invited to join the
Stanford women's volleyball team. It made
my life.

TSD: Off the court, how have you enjoyed
your time at Stanford? What have you most
enjoyed about life on the Farm? What is the
best class that you have taken?

KC: I've enjoyed the people here the most.

Although currently out with an injury, senior
setter Karissa Cook is a finalist for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award after earning
AII-Pac-12 honorable mention last season.
You learn more from late
night conversations about
life here than in the class
rooms, where I promise,
you still learn a lot. My
favorite class here might
have been foam-core mon
sters in ME 101, the
machine shop with ME 203
or Existentialism.
TSD: As a senior, what are
you most looking forward
to during your last year?
KC: I am looking forward
to another awesome season
with the most bailer group
of girls on campus, not hav
ing to bike to winter
weights in the morning and
hanging out in my new

home in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.

TSD: Last season, you were
unfortunately bounced
from the NCAA tourna
ment in the second round.
What lessons did you take
away from that loss that will
allow you to come back
stronger this season and
push towards your first
championship?

KC: It was a good reminder
about how much we hate to
lose. We've grown a lot
since then. We're tougher
now, and we like winning
and we're trying to do a lot
of that this year.

TSD: This week you will
take on tough teams in
Arizona and Arizona State,
both on the road. What
have you been focusing on
in practice to get ready for

these matches?

KC: Every weekend in the
Pac-12 is full of tough
teams, and we work hard
every week to be the best
that we can both in the
short and long term.
Heading to Arizona, we are
working hard on our side
out game and controlling
the match early.

TSD: Lastly, your brother,
Brian, stars for the men's
team at Stanford. How
have you enjoyed being
able to watch him these
past two years?

KC: It's been awesome to
have Brian here at
Stanford, and he's on one of
the most fun teams at this
school to go cheer for. Even
though he's an outside hit
ter, I taught him everything
he knows.

tum we will be a force to be reckoned with.

TSD: The freshmen have gotten off to a
scorching start so far and have certainly
made the adjustment to Division I play
well. How impressed have you been with
their performance? Will the team continue
to rely upon them going forward?

KC: I am especially proud of our freshman
class. We've already needed them to step up
in tough games and in new roles, and
they've proven that they're a crucial piece
of the puzzle.

TSD: Heading into your senior season, you
were named as one of the top 30 candidates
for the 2012 Senior CLASS Award. What
does this honor mean to you?

KC: I'm very grateful to be considered a
part of such a wonderful and humbling
group of people, I'm still in denial about
being a senior though, so I'm assuming it's
all part of an elaborate prank.

TSD: Looking back on your career thus
far, what has been your best volleyball
memory?

KC: My best volleyball memory is the
moment that [coach] John [Dunning] called
me and told me that I was invited to join the
Stanford women's volleyball team. It made
my life.

TSD: Off the court, how have you enjoyed
your time at Stanford? What have you most
enjoyed about life on the Farm? What is the
best class that you have taken?

KC: I've enjoyed the people here the most.

setter Karissa Cook is a finalist for the
Lowe's Senior CLASS Award after earning
AII-Pac-12 honorable mention last season.
You learn more from late
night conversations about
life here than in the class
rooms, where I promise,
you still learn a lot. My
favorite class here might
have been foam-core mon
sters in ME 101, the
machine shop with ME 203
or Existentialism.
TSD: As a senior, what are
you most looking forward
to during your last year?
KC: I am looking forward
to another awesome season
with the most bailer group
of girls on campus, not hav
ing to bike to winter
weights in the morning and
hanging out in my new

home in the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.

TSD: Last season, you were
unfortunately bounced
from the NCAA tourna
ment in the second round.
What lessons did you take
away from that loss that will
allow you to come back
stronger this season and
push towards your first
championship?

KC: It was a good reminder
about how much we hate to
lose. We've grown a lot
since then. We're tougher
now, and we like winning
and we're trying to do a lot
of that this year.

TSD: This week you will
take on tough teams in
Arizona and Arizona State,
both on the road. What
have you been focusing on
in practice to get ready for

these matches?

KC: Every weekend in the
Pac-12 is full of tough
teams, and we work hard
every week to be the best
that we can both in the
short and long term.
Heading to Arizona, we are
working hard on our side
out game and controlling
the match early.

TSD: Lastly, your brother,
Brian, stars for the men's
team at Stanford. How
have you enjoyed being
able to watch him these
past two years?

KC: It's been awesome to
have Brian here at
Stanford, and he's on one of
the most fun teams at this
school to go cheer for. Even
though he's an outside hit
ter, I taught him everything
he knows.
In her first year as the volleyball team's
starting setter, senior Karissa Cook earned
Pac-12 honorable mention honors and
ranked 20th in the country with 11.32 assists
per set. One of the Cardinal's most respect
ed players this year, Cook has been side
lined by an injury but was still named a can
didate for the Lowe's Senior CLASS
Award. The Daily sat down with Cook to
talk all things Stanford volleyball.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Being injured is
always tough how optimistic are you
about your chances of getting back on the
court soon?

Karissa Cook (KC): I am very optimistic
about my chances of getting back on the
court soon. The goal is to be back as soon as
possible, and we have the most talented ath
letic trainers, physical therapists and physi
cians making that very possible.

TSD: This season has definitely started well
for the team, considering that you have won
your last seven games. How do you feel
about your chances going forward?

KC: Our team is not only talented this year,
but we are also very deep. Everyone on the
team is capable of coming into big matches
and contributing, and going forward into a
long season, that's often what makes the big
difference. Everyone is pushing each other
in practice, in the weight room and on the
court, and if we can keep that same momen
tum we will be a force to be reckoned with.
