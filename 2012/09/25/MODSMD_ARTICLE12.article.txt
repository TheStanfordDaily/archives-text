# Early season struggles
## 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Missing senior star Sally Watson, the
women's golf team struggled in its first
tournament of the season, finishing 11th in
a field of 15 at Vanderbilt's Mason
Rudolph Women's Championship this
weekend. Watson, college golfs 50th
ranked player as of last spring, missed the
tournament to represent Scotland at the
World Amateur Team Championships in
Turkey.
Although the team didn't score well,
highly-touted freshmen Mariah Stackhouse
and Lauren Kim acquitted themselves
admirably in their first college starts, finish
ing 17th and 28th, respectively, to lead the
Cardinal.
"We have to work on short game
that was one of the big issues this time
around," Kim said. "I also think some of it
was mental too, staying in the present
moment, staying focused, committing to
every shot and just trusting that we put in
the work and that's why we're competing
at the level we are."
Players were generally disappointed
with the result, but Stackhouse and junior
Marissa Mar agreed that this first tourna
ment was an important team bonding
experience.
"I think it says a lot when [as] a team
we didn't perform as well as we wanted,
but we still had a great time," Stackhouse
said. "That just shows what a great team
we have and what a great bond every
body's formed in just these past two
weeks."
Stackhouse joins the Cardinal having
won 97 junior tournaments, including two
Georgia Women's Amateur Championships
and the 2009 PGA Georgia Women's Open.

Entering the season, Golf World named her
one of college golfs Top 50 Players to
Watch. Kim won the 2009 California State
Junior Girls Amateur and has, along with
Stackhouse, been named a top-10 high
school prospect by Golfweek.com.
Also new is head coach Anne Walker,
who comes to Stanford after four years as
head coach at UC-Davis, where she won
the Big West Coach of the Year Award
three times. She replaces longtime head
coach Caroline O'Connor, who took the
team to 15 NCAA Championship tourna
ment appearances in her 17 years as coach.
The Cardinal's best finish in that time was
a second-place national finish in 2000.
"[Walker] has filled [O'Connors'] shoes
with confidence [and] graciousness," Mar
said. "She's taking this team and really
building a championship team, and I could
not be more confident in her ability to do
so."
Walker hopes to draw inspiration from
famously successful Stanford coaches as
she builds up the golf program.
"I've read a ton about Tara VanDerveer
and Jim Harbaugh since I was hired," she
said. "I wanted to understand how they
came here and turned programs around.
They were tough and they went blue-col
lar, and this season is huge in setting the
direction and values for this program for
years to come."
This year's team is young, with the two
freshmen and sophomore Mariko
Tumangan likely to be consistent contribu
tors in the lineup. Tumangan finished last
season ranked 76th in the country and was,
along with Watson, named an All-Pac-12
Conference honorable mention.
Anxious to rejoin her teammates as
soon as she finishes next weekend's tour

nament with Scotland, Watson said she
sees a lot of potential in this year's team.
"The team has a very strong chance
this year to compete with the best teams
in the country and contend for a national
championship," she said. "Everyone
seems to have improved from last year,
and the freshmen are already showing
that they mean business and are going to
challenge to be the number one player on
the team."
The Cardinal plays in two more tour
naments before a winter hiatus. On Oct. 8,
five players will fly to Washington to play
in the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational at the
famous Sahalee Country Club. The team
will then host the Stanford Intercollegiate
at the end of October. Walker will decide
which five will journey to Washington after
players complete qualifying rounds this
week.
Stackhouse said Watson's return to the
lineup will be an important boost for the
team.
"She'll probably motivate us all to be a
little better," Stackhouse said. "Sally is a
big part of the team, and she's the one that
pumps everyone up and lets everybody
know that they can play good golf. I'm
excited to have her come back."
Although it is still early, Watson
expressed confidence that the team can
improve on its 24th-place finish in the
NCAA Championships last spring.
"The team's performance last spring
was not what we had hoped for, despite
giving 100 percent and doing all we could
to raise our games to the next level," she
said. "Golf is a tricky sport in that hard
work does not simply translate into better
results. In order to achieve different, and
better, results this year, I think we each

just need to improve our ability to per
form under pressure and bring it when it
really counts."

a field of 15 at Vanderbilt's Mason
Rudolph Women's Championship this
weekend. Watson, college golfs 50th
ranked player as of last spring, missed the
tournament to represent Scotland at the
World Amateur Team Championships in
Turkey.
Although the team didn't score well,
highly-touted freshmen Mariah Stackhouse
and Lauren Kim acquitted themselves
admirably in their first college starts, finish
ing 17th and 28th, respectively, to lead the
Cardinal.
"We have to work on short game
that was one of the big issues this time
around," Kim said. "I also think some of it
was mental too, staying in the present
moment, staying focused, committing to
every shot and just trusting that we put in
the work and that's why we're competing
at the level we are."
Players were generally disappointed
with the result, but Stackhouse and junior
Marissa Mar agreed that this first tourna
ment was an important team bonding
experience.
"I think it says a lot when [as] a team
we didn't perform as well as we wanted,
but we still had a great time," Stackhouse
said. "That just shows what a great team
we have and what a great bond every
body's formed in just these past two
weeks."
Stackhouse joins the Cardinal having
won 97 junior tournaments, including two
Georgia Women's Amateur Championships
and the 2009 PGA Georgia Women's Open.

Entering the season, Golf World named her
one of college golfs Top 50 Players to
Watch. Kim won the 2009 California State
Junior Girls Amateur and has, along with
Stackhouse, been named a top-10 high
school prospect by Golfweek.com.
Also new is head coach Anne Walker,
who comes to Stanford after four years as
head coach at UC-Davis, where she won
the Big West Coach of the Year Award
three times. She replaces longtime head
coach Caroline O'Connor, who took the
team to 15 NCAA Championship tourna
ment appearances in her 17 years as coach.
The Cardinal's best finish in that time was
a second-place national finish in 2000.
"[Walker] has filled [O'Connors'] shoes
with confidence [and] graciousness," Mar
said. "She's taking this team and really
building a championship team, and I could
not be more confident in her ability to do
so."
Walker hopes to draw inspiration from
famously successful Stanford coaches as
she builds up the golf program.
"I've read a ton about Tara VanDerveer
and Jim Harbaugh since I was hired," she
said. "I wanted to understand how they
came here and turned programs around.
They were tough and they went blue-col
lar, and this season is huge in setting the
direction and values for this program for
years to come."
This year's team is young, with the two
freshmen and sophomore Mariko
Tumangan likely to be consistent contribu
tors in the lineup. Tumangan finished last
season ranked 76th in the country and was,
along with Watson, named an All-Pac-12
Conference honorable mention.
Anxious to rejoin her teammates as
soon as she finishes next weekend's tour

nament with Scotland, Watson said she
sees a lot of potential in this year's team.
"The team has a very strong chance
this year to compete with the best teams
in the country and contend for a national
championship," she said. "Everyone
seems to have improved from last year,
and the freshmen are already showing
that they mean business and are going to
challenge to be the number one player on
the team."
The Cardinal plays in two more tour
naments before a winter hiatus. On Oct. 8,
five players will fly to Washington to play
in the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational at the
famous Sahalee Country Club. The team
will then host the Stanford Intercollegiate
at the end of October. Walker will decide
which five will journey to Washington after
players complete qualifying rounds this
week.
Stackhouse said Watson's return to the
lineup will be an important boost for the
team.
"She'll probably motivate us all to be a
little better," Stackhouse said. "Sally is a
big part of the team, and she's the one that
pumps everyone up and lets everybody
know that they can play good golf. I'm
excited to have her come back."
Although it is still early, Watson
expressed confidence that the team can
improve on its 24th-place finish in the
NCAA Championships last spring.
"The team's performance last spring
was not what we had hoped for, despite
giving 100 percent and doing all we could
to raise our games to the next level," she
said. "Golf is a tricky sport in that hard
work does not simply translate into better
results. In order to achieve different, and
better, results this year, I think we each

just need to improve our ability to per
form under pressure and bring it when it
really counts."
