### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 have appoint
ed their executive cabinet and
made headway on several ASSU
programs.
"A big [goal] for me is doing
what we said we were going to do,"
Wagstaff said of the ASSU
Executive's priorities this year.
Their campaign platform, based on
principles of practicality and com
mon sense, included objectives to
encourage public service engage
ment, expand participation in ath
letic events, increase late-night
options and streamline a textbook
exchange.

Cabinet appointments
After soliciting applications
through public email lists and
interviewing candidates, Zimbroff
and Wagstaff selected only three
students for their executive cabi
net.

The president and vice presi
dent said that they chose their new
cabinet members, Anjney Midha
'l5, Kaela Farrise 'l4 and Norian
Watson 'l3, because they wanted
students representative of differ
ent aspects of the University who
were able to communicate and
work with lots of different people.
"We were looking for people
who have had their hands in differ
ent places on campus not only
[from] different [class] years, but
who are involved in different
groups," Wagstaff said. "But [we]
also [wanted] their mindset toward
ASSU and what ASSU does...
[to be] aligned with what we're
doing."
Midha serves on the branding
team at the Business Association
of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students (BASES) and is involved
in the entrepreneurial community.
Farrise is the co-president of
Project Motivation, a service
based voluntary student organiza
tion, and is involved in other sever
al Flaas Center programs. Watson

has worked as a resident assistant
(RA), a student leader of the
Caribbean Students Association
and a student representative on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff's final
cabinet of three will be much

smaller than those of previous
administrations; the 2011-12 and
2010-11 executive cabinets had 16
and 12 members, respectively. They
have said that they hope the small
er cabinet will encourage a "big
picture" approach, and that it will
involve all members in a variety of

student life projects.
It is also the first time in at least
three years that the Executive has
waited until the summer before
accepting applications for cabinet
positions.
In addition to the downsizing,
Zimbroff also said their cabinet
will be more team-based and less
hierarchical than those of the past.
"They don't have titles. I would
n't call it free form, but I'd call it
more of a team, point-person
dynamic," Zimbroff said. "We talk
about everything together and fig
ure out... who is best equipped to
work on what."

Student life initiatives
Over the past two months, the
Executive team has worked with
the Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse Office to
design a presentation for incoming
students. Wagstaff said that they
hope to launch the presentations,
which may include a student panel,

in freshman dorms by late
October.
They also worked with
class presidents to organize
a tailgate on Sept. 27, when
the Cardinal football team
travels to Washington.
"The first football game
of the academic year is away
... [but] we didn't want
people to miss out on the
experience," Zimbroff said.
The pair has also been
planning campus engage
ment events for the upcom
ing Alternative Review
Process (ARP) discussion

and debate. Instituted as a
two-year pilot program in
2010, the ARP, which regu
lates the judicial procedure
for students charged with
sexual assault, was up for
ASSU review last spring.
However, following con
tentious debate, the
Undergraduate Senate
chose to defer the vote to
this fall.
Zimbroff said they are
hoping to host a town hall
and anonymous web forum
within the next six weeks to
inform students on the ARP
and solicit feedback on its
controversial procedures.
"One of the things that
you're trying to overcome is
that not everyone knows
what the ARP consists of.

So you want to educate peo
ple on what is going on,"
Zimbroff said.
Facing setbacks
As part of their platform
objective to expand late
night food options, the team
has also worked to bring
more food trucks to campus.
However, Zimbroff said
that they are still working
through logistical problems,
including meeting health
code regulations, finding
parking space, ensuring
proper licensing and arrang
ing management and liabili
ty contracts with the
University.
"We're trying to work
with the University because
they're probably going to let

us do it... but we have to
go through the proper
motions," Zimbroff said.
"One of the problems with
Stanford generally is that
things move slower than
you'd like to see them."
He said students can
expect late-night food
trucks by the start of winter
quarter.
The Executive team has
seen less progress in its

attempt to bring food from
local restaurants onto cam
pus. Wagstaff said the
restaurants they have con
tacted have inflexible
polices that prevent them
from serving or distributing
to Stanford late-night insti
tutions.
"To be honest, it's been
more frustrating than we
hoped for to get [restau
rants] to agree to have later

hours or lower minimum
orders," Zimbroff said.
Following discussions
with administrators,
Wagstaff said that they have
abandoned efforts to create
a new textbook exchange
because of existing entities
that perform the same serv
ice.
