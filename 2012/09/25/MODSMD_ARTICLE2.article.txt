### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 have appoint
ed their executive cabinet and
made headway on several ASSU
programs.
"A big [goal] for me is doing
what we said we were going to do,"
Wagstaff said of the ASSU
Executive's priorities this year.
Their campaign platform, based on
principles of practicality and com
mon sense, included objectives to
encourage public service engage
ment, expand participation in ath
letic events, increase late-night
options and streamline a textbook
exchange.

Cabinet appointments
After soliciting applications
through public email lists and
interviewing candidates, Zimbroff
and Wagstaff selected only three
students for their executive cabi
net.

The president and vice presi
dent said that they chose their new
cabinet members, Anjney Midha
'l5, Kaela Farrise 'l4 and Norian
Watson 'l3, because they wanted
students representative of differ
ent aspects of the University who
were able to communicate and
work with lots of different people.
"We were looking for people
who have had their hands in differ
ent places on campus not only
[from] different [class] years, but
who are involved in different
groups," Wagstaff said. "But [we]
also [wanted] their mindset toward
ASSU and what ASSU does...
[to be] aligned with what we're
doing."
Midha serves on the branding
team at the Business Association
of Stanford Entrepreneurial
Students (BASES) and is involved
in the entrepreneurial community.
Farrise is the co-president of
Project Motivation, a service
based voluntary student organiza
tion, and is involved in other sever
al Flaas Center programs. Watson

has worked as a resident assistant
(RA), a student leader of the
Caribbean Students Association
and a student representative on
the Committee on Land and
Building Development.
Zimbroff and Wagstaff's final
cabinet of three will be much

smaller than those of previous
administrations; the 2011-12 and
2010-11 executive cabinets had 16
and 12 members, respectively. They
have said that they hope the small
er cabinet will encourage a "big
picture" approach, and that it will
involve all members in a variety of

student life projects.
It is also the first time in at least
three years that the Executive has
waited until the summer before
accepting applications for cabinet
positions.
In addition to the downsizing,
Zimbroff also said their cabinet
will be more team-based and less
hierarchical than those of the past.
"They don't have titles. I would
n't call it free form, but I'd call it
more of a team, point-person
dynamic," Zimbroff said. "We talk
about everything together and fig
ure out... who is best equipped to
work on what."

Student life initiatives
Over the past two months, the
Executive team has worked with
the Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse Office to
design a presentation for incoming
students. Wagstaff said that they
hope to launch the presentations,
which may include a student panel,
