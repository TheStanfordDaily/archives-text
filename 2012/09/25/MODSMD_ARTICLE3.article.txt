## Studies show new potential in wind energy 
### ERIN INMAN DESK EDITOR 
Two recent Stanford Civil and
Environmental Engineering (CEE)
studies have shed light on the vast
potential of wind energy to power
the East Coast of the United
States and the world.
Together, offshore and onshore
wind farms could deliver between
80 and 350 terawatts (TW) of
energy globally, depending on geo
graphic placement, according to a
study by Mark Jacobson, professor
of civil and environmental engi
neering at Stanford, and Cristina
Archer, associate professor of
geography and physical ocean sci
ence and engineering at the
University of Delaware. This
exceeds the projected global need
of 11.5 TW in 2030.

A similar study by Jacobson
and Mike Dvorak Ph.D. 'l2 found
potential for 965 to 1,372 terawatt
hours of electricity annually from
offshore wind farms on the East
Coast, enough energy to power
the region.
This research differed from
previous analyses that were based
on wind speeds reported from
data stations. The wind speeds
were used to estimate the wind
power for the turbines to extract;
this power was then converted to
the potential power generated by
the turbine.
Previous studies using estima
tion placed the potential of global
wind energy at 1 TW, significantly
lower than the 80 to 350 TW now
projected.
"It is a 3-D problem that they
were trying to calculate with a 0-D

model," Jacobson said. "It shows
the danger of back-of-the-enve
lope estimates about phenome
na."
For the new studies, Jacobson
and his researchers used a weather
prediction climate model, which
simulates climate, weather and air
pollution at the global, regional
and local scales.
The model also simulated,
rather than estimated, the effect of
wind turbines on neighboring
wind turbines. Individual wind tur
bines in wind farms are subject to
interference from nearby turbines,
as they take wind from each other,
depleting available wind and
power output.
To simulate the reduction of
wind speed and energy, the
