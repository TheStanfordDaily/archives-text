## Studies show new potential in wind energy 
### ERIN INMAN DESK EDITOR 
Two recent Stanford Civil and
Environmental Engineering (CEE)
studies have shed light on the vast
potential of wind energy to power
the East Coast of the United
States and the world.
Together, offshore and onshore
wind farms could deliver between
80 and 350 terawatts (TW) of
energy globally, depending on geo
graphic placement, according to a
study by Mark Jacobson, professor
of civil and environmental engi
neering at Stanford, and Cristina
Archer, associate professor of
geography and physical ocean sci
ence and engineering at the
University of Delaware. This
exceeds the projected global need
of 11.5 TW in 2030.

A similar study by Jacobson
and Mike Dvorak Ph.D. 'l2 found
potential for 965 to 1,372 terawatt
hours of electricity annually from
offshore wind farms on the East
Coast, enough energy to power
the region.
This research differed from
previous analyses that were based
on wind speeds reported from
data stations. The wind speeds
were used to estimate the wind
power for the turbines to extract;
this power was then converted to
the potential power generated by
the turbine.
Previous studies using estima
tion placed the potential of global
wind energy at 1 TW, significantly
lower than the 80 to 350 TW now
projected.
"It is a 3-D problem that they
were trying to calculate with a 0-D

model," Jacobson said. "It shows
the danger of back-of-the-enve
lope estimates about phenome
na."
For the new studies, Jacobson
and his researchers used a weather
prediction climate model, which
simulates climate, weather and air
pollution at the global, regional
and local scales.
The model also simulated,
rather than estimated, the effect of
wind turbines on neighboring
wind turbines. Individual wind tur
bines in wind farms are subject to
interference from nearby turbines,
as they take wind from each other,
depleting available wind and
power output.
To simulate the reduction of
wind speed and energy, the
researchers put wind tur
bines into the models,
extracted the energy,
reduced the wind speed by
the amount taken from the
extracted energy and recal
culated the wind speed for
the neighboring turbines.
With this new model of
accounting for turbine
interference, researchers
found a greater saturation
potential for the world's
wind power. As the amount
of turbines and wind farms
increases, the potential
decreases until adding more
turbines yields diminishing
returns.
The study for the East
Coast was modeled primari
ly on offshore, rather than
onshore, wind farms.
"Because of the high
population density, the East
Coast is limited [in] how
much onshore energy could
be generated," Dvorak said.
"Offshore wind farms allow
larger wind centers near
New York and Boston."

Offshore wind farms
also have the benefit of gen
erating the most wind ener
gy at peak energy usage
times, according to
Jacobson. Afternoon sea
breezes caused by tempera
ture differences between
the land and ocean generate
energy for the wind tur
bines. Onshore wind farms,
however, can have peak
energy generation at day or
night depending on meteor
ology and topography.
Additionally, because
most people live near coasts
worldwide, offshore wind
farms allow for shorter
transmission distances,
which can be facilitated by
underwater cables.
Proposals are underway
for construction of wind
farms off the East Coast,
including the Cape Wind
Project in Massachusetts,
which will begin construc
tion in the next two years. As
for the Bay Area, wind ener
gy has potential, but more
logistical issues than the East
Coast.
In a 2010 study, Jacobson
and Dvorak found that 200
percent of California's cur
rent electrical needs could

be met with wind power.
However, wind farms would
yield the greatest payoff far
from the population centers
of Los Angeles and the Bay
Area. To power the West
Coast with these offshore
wind farms, larger transmis
sion lines would be required.

potential for the world's
wind power. As the amount
of turbines and wind farms
increases, the potential
decreases until adding more
turbines yields diminishing
returns.
The study for the East
Coast was modeled primari
ly on offshore, rather than
onshore, wind farms.
"Because of the high
population density, the East
Coast is limited [in] how
much onshore energy could
be generated," Dvorak said.
"Offshore wind farms allow
larger wind centers near
New York and Boston."

Offshore wind farms
also have the benefit of gen
erating the most wind ener
gy at peak energy usage
times, according to
Jacobson. Afternoon sea
breezes caused by tempera
ture differences between
the land and ocean generate
energy for the wind tur
bines. Onshore wind farms,
however, can have peak
energy generation at day or
night depending on meteor
ology and topography.
Additionally, because
most people live near coasts
worldwide, offshore wind
farms allow for shorter
transmission distances,
which can be facilitated by
underwater cables.
Proposals are underway
for construction of wind
farms off the East Coast,
including the Cape Wind
Project in Massachusetts,
which will begin construc
tion in the next two years. As
for the Bay Area, wind ener
gy has potential, but more
logistical issues than the East
Coast.
In a 2010 study, Jacobson
and Dvorak found that 200
percent of California's cur
rent electrical needs could

be met with wind power.
However, wind farms would
yield the greatest payoff far
from the population centers
of Los Angeles and the Bay
Area. To power the West
Coast with these offshore
wind farms, larger transmis
sion lines would be required.
