## Demystifying declaring: UAR efforts successful 
### IBy ALEXIS GARDUNO STAFF WRITER 
Efforts by Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) to
ease students' uncertainty when
choosing a major, including events
like Majors Night, have led to a
decrease in the number of juniors
who are undeclared entering fall
quarter, from 544 in 2009 to 359 this
year, according to Koren
Bakkegard, associate dean of
UAR.
In recent years, UAR has dedi
cated more resources to sopho
mores, such as adding academic
directors who cater to sophomores'
advising needs. Changes to iDeclare
Week and Majors Night and a quar
terly enrollment hold to ensure that
sophomores meet with their pre
major advisors until declaring a
major are the latest measures.
UAR hosts Majors Night each
year to introduce freshmen and
sophomores to department faculty
as a point of access to more
resources for informed decisions
about declaring a major. This year,
Majors Night will be held at Paul
Brest Hall in Munger Graduate
Residences from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on
Oct. 2.
In previous years the event was
held at Toyon Hall. According to
Bakkegard, the move to the less fre
quented, but larger, Paul Brest Hall
will allow for more open space for
the estimated 700 to 800 students to
walk around.
In response to low attendance at
iDeclare Week, another event
geared at helping sophomores
declare, UAR teamed up with the
sophomore class presidents to cre
ate a month-long series of events to
replace its weeklong predecessor.
"This year we've decided to
spread it out so students could feel
as if they could go to more events,"
Bakkegard said.
UAR's efforts aim to alleviate
some of the pressures that delay
students from declaring their
majors.
"Given the economic environ
ment, students perceive that there is
a steady correlation between one's

major and the future career path,
and that career to their level of hap
piness," Bakkegard said, proposing
an explanation to why students
delay declaring. "Students fear that
when they declare their major, it
decides the rest of their lives."
Charlie Fierro 'l3 agrees with
this hypothesis. Fie attributed his
delay to being a "commitment
phobe." Fierro went undeclared
throughout most of his first three
years. Fie moved from thinking of
himself as an eager chemistry major
to an uncertain physics major to a
non-scientific major, until finally
settling into computer science.
Fierro said that as a freshman, he
made the mistake of diving straight
into chemistry before exploring
more options. He now believes that
the first two years should be used
for more exploration.
"It takes a long time, but eventu
ally you'll get there," Fierro said.
Jessica McCallum 'l4 had dual
interests in biology and mechanics
and went Majors Night last year
certain of wanting a major that had
"something to do with mechanical
engineering."
Although McCallum was disap
pointed to find limited information
on specific majors, she found it help
ful to compare similar majors, such
as biomechanical engineering,
mechanical engineering and bio
engineering.
Rachel Lee 'l5 spent her sum
mer exploring Stanford's resources.
"As a freshman, it's difficult to
actually understand program
sheets, and often times there is no
uniform way the school presents
each major, so I was majorly
stressed," Lee wrote in an email to
The Daily.
Lee stated she did not plan on
going to Majors Night but recom
mended undeclared students speak
with student service officers, who
pointed her in the right direction.
"Your employers won't care that
much about what major as much as
what you do; that's a wonderful
reality to embrace," Lee said.
