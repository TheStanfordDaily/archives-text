## My dog is a better person than me 
### Chris Herries 
You could set your clock by
Ginger's nightly routine.
The faithful golden
retriever goes out every night at
10 o'clock sharp and takes five
minutes to scan the border of our
substantial property. She drives
off any deer that linger near our
apple trees or rabbits raiding the
garden. She checks to make sure
there are no trespassers and once
amiably escorted a late-night jog
ger away from our driveway.
Then, she comes in and follows as
someone locks up the house for
the night. If someone is staying up
late to read or study, she sits at
their feet until they're safely seen
to bed. Finally, with the house
quiet, she'll curl up and wait for
morning. Ginger has been dutiful
ly taking care of my family for 11
years now. She consoles us, greets
us, warms us, forgives us, encour
ages us and, above all, loves us.
When I was a child, my sister was
hospitalized for depression.
When my other sister began to
cry, Ginger simply sat up next to
her and nuzzled my sister's neck
as if to say, "I got you." I am in
debt to this dog's compassion.
Now, I'm not just trying to
make you envious of my epic
pooch, I'm trying to emphasize a
point about loyalty. We all value
it. I've yet to meet a man who
cherishes faithlessness in a friend.
I still haven't found a girl who's
fond of philanderers. Yet, defining

what loyalty is, how it operates,
why we value it and whether we
practice it remains difficult. That's
where dogs come in. They seem
to have a knack for a concept that
eludes us. Using Ginger's lessons,
let me propose what loyalty
should look like in a friendship;
because we all need to wonder if
we qualify as a loyal friend or not.
"First sac, then calc" was a
famous line of the chess grand
master Mikhail Tal. He meant
that people should commit to a
good idea and then find away,
any way to make it work. When a
friend says his car broke down,
offer help. Never mind that you
don't know exactly how to help;
that can always be puzzled out.
When a friend's relative passes
away show up at their doorstep
and offer to help. Never mind that
you're not a therapist, just be a
loyal friend. If your friend is in
SIMPS, watch their shows
because loyal friends support
each other and, let's face it,
SIMPS is pretty darn awesome.
Never mind that you have a prob
lem set due the next day; taking
an hour to show your dedication
to someone is certainly worth los
ing sleep over. Essentially, I posit
that a friend says "yes." First be
loyal, then be logistical.
One of my coaches uses the
phrase "don't be a victim."
According to him, victims show up
everywhere with excuses and

apologies. That's not loyalty. If
your friend is expecting you at
seven, be there at seven. If you
promised someone you'd help
them make dinner, then help them
make dinner. If you tell your girl
friend you love her, then love her.
I think a big part of loyalty is keep
ing promises big and small. Make
a promise, keep a promise.
Finally, I think being busy is a
state of mind. It's just prioritizing
certain things, considering them
more important than other things
and sacrificing the less essential.
Now classes, start-ups, jobs,
homework, sports, clubs these

are all really important things.
They will never be as impor
tant as friendship.
Before you shoot, let me
explain! None of those things are
going to love you back. They'll
make you happy and satisfy a
passion, but won't replace the
love and camaraderie that true
friends share. Therefore, a loyal
person makes time for friends, all
other things aside. Friends are, in
my opinion, one of the few things
worth having in life.
Now, you can buy and sell my
propositions, because if erring is
human then I'm more human

than most. But I beseech you
and this column will involve a lot
of beseeching —to take time
this week to do things with
friends. Not just party with them,
or study with them. Do some
thing unique: Take a walk, climb
a tree, play a sport, have a mean
ingful conversation. And the
next time they call upon you for
help, remember how important
they are and stand up. Be loyal.
Reciprocity has to start with
someone. Why not you?

I think a big part of loyalty is keep
ing promises big and small. Make
a promise, keep a promise.
Finally, I think being busy is a
state of mind. It's just prioritizing
certain things, considering them
more important than other things
and sacrificing the less essential.
Now classes, start-ups, jobs,
homework, sports, clubs these

are all really important things.
They will never be as impor
tant as friendship.
Before you shoot, let me
explain! None of those things are
going to love you back. They'll
make you happy and satisfy a
passion, but won't replace the
love and camaraderie that true
friends share. Therefore, a loyal
person makes time for friends, all
other things aside. Friends are, in
my opinion, one of the few things
worth having in life.
Now, you can buy and sell my
propositions, because if erring is
human then I'm more human

than most. But I beseech you
and this column will involve a lot
of beseeching —to take time
this week to do things with
friends. Not just party with them,
or study with them. Do some
thing unique: Take a walk, climb
a tree, play a sport, have a mean
ingful conversation. And the
next time they call upon you for
help, remember how important
they are and stand up. Be loyal.
Reciprocity has to start with
someone. Why not you?

You could set your clock by
Ginger's nightly routine.
The faithful golden
retriever goes out every night at
10 o'clock sharp and takes five
minutes to scan the border of our
substantial property. She drives
off any deer that linger near our
apple trees or rabbits raiding the
garden. She checks to make sure
there are no trespassers and once
amiably escorted a late-night jog
ger away from our driveway.
Then, she comes in and follows as
someone locks up the house for
the night. If someone is staying up
late to read or study, she sits at
their feet until they're safely seen
to bed. Finally, with the house
quiet, she'll curl up and wait for
morning. Ginger has been dutiful
ly taking care of my family for 11
years now. She consoles us, greets
us, warms us, forgives us, encour
ages us and, above all, loves us.
When I was a child, my sister was
hospitalized for depression.
When my other sister began to
cry, Ginger simply sat up next to
her and nuzzled my sister's neck
as if to say, "I got you." I am in
debt to this dog's compassion.
Now, I'm not just trying to
make you envious of my epic
pooch, I'm trying to emphasize a
point about loyalty. We all value
it. I've yet to meet a man who
cherishes faithlessness in a friend.
I still haven't found a girl who's
fond of philanderers. Yet, defining

what loyalty is, how it operates,
why we value it and whether we
practice it remains difficult. That's
where dogs come in. They seem
to have a knack for a concept that
eludes us. Using Ginger's lessons,
let me propose what loyalty
should look like in a friendship;
because we all need to wonder if
we qualify as a loyal friend or not.
"First sac, then calc" was a
famous line of the chess grand
master Mikhail Tal. He meant
that people should commit to a
good idea and then find away,
any way to make it work. When a
friend says his car broke down,
offer help. Never mind that you
don't know exactly how to help;
that can always be puzzled out.
When a friend's relative passes
away show up at their doorstep
and offer to help. Never mind that
you're not a therapist, just be a
loyal friend. If your friend is in
SIMPS, watch their shows
because loyal friends support
each other and, let's face it,
SIMPS is pretty darn awesome.
Never mind that you have a prob
lem set due the next day; taking
an hour to show your dedication
to someone is certainly worth los
ing sleep over. Essentially, I posit
that a friend says "yes." First be
loyal, then be logistical.
One of my coaches uses the
phrase "don't be a victim."
According to him, victims show up
everywhere with excuses and

apologies. That's not loyalty. If
your friend is expecting you at
seven, be there at seven. If you
promised someone you'd help
them make dinner, then help them
make dinner. If you tell your girl
friend you love her, then love her.
I think a big part of loyalty is keep
ing promises big and small. Make
a promise, keep a promise.
