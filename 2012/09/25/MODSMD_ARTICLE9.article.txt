## Stanford selling out on students 
### Tom Taylor 
So Stanford finally
sold us out. In the
space of one sum
mer it ripped out
part of Tresidder
Union and squeezed in a
shiny new Starbucks.
I'm sure there are lots of
you, both freshmen and
returning students, who will
disagree and welcome the
addition of this Seattle-born
behemoth, who welcome the
installation of a familiar fran
chise that will provide you
with a carbon-copy cup of
coffee to transport you back
to the identical Starbucks
across the street back home.
But you're wrong, and I'll tell
you why.
The first is that in selling
out to Starbucks, Stanford
took away one of the few
safe spaces we soccer fans
had here on campus. Many
were the times that I would
meet friends in the Tresidder
lounge at lunchtime to catch
a live UEFA Champions
League game, and we were
never alone. The tables were
always full and all faces were
inclined towards the flicker
ing screens.
Now the TVs are gone
and the options are more
limited. The couches in Old
Union are comfortable, but
there aren't many of them,
and going to CoHo or
Treehouse raises the moral
uncertainty of whether we
have to buy food there in
exchange for the right to
watch.
The second, bigger reason
is that Stanford prides itself
on being unique and quirky.
It could have offered the site
to a local company like Philz
Coffee (echoing the arrival
of Ike's Place on campus two

years back) or, even better,
given the space over to a stu
dent-run enterprise. It could
have also invested more time
and resources in the existing
coffee shop.
Is eveiyone a fan of the
CoHo? No. Is the coffee and
food always amazing?
Maybe not. Is it a central and
unique part of Stanford?
Unquestionably yes. Instead
of pasting in a bland, mass
produced copy of a Seattle
coffee house, why not sup
port a local institution that in
various guises dates back as
far as 1966?
Before ground was bro
ken on this new store, there
was no real coffee drought
afflicting the Farm. Within a
few minutes walk from
Tresidder, you can easily find
enough caffeine to keep you
buzzing all day, from the
three Coupa Cafes to the
Bookstore, Bytes and more.
And in the very same build
ing as the new Starbucks,
there was both a Peet's
Coffee (now closed) and
Stanford's very own CoHo.
If the powers that be had
applied this selling-out strat
egy to the Athletics
Department, you wouldn't
now be at a top-10 football
school. Back in 2006, the
Cardinal had a 1-11 season
without question, a terri
ble year. Meanwhile, USC
finished 11-2 and won the
Rose Bowl. The last time
Stanford had won any major
bowl game had been over 30
years before. If you could
ever justify cutting a football
program, maybe the Card
was making the case.
Doing so, though, would
of course have been
unthinkable, and not just
because of what we know
now. Instead it knuckled
down, made changes,
brought in Jim Harbaugh
and just a year later was
already back on the upswing.
Five years later, No. 9
Stanford has the 2011
Orange Bowl trophy, memo
ries of a narrow loss in the
2012 Fiesta Bowl and a 5-1
lead in the recent series with
the Trojans. USC? In 2010
the NCAA imposed painful
sanctions on the Trojan foot
ball program that have left

their mark. It is by no means
out of the championship
race, but even dropping to
No. 13 is a big fall for such a
storied team.
Did Stanford launch itself
up the rankings table by sell
ing out? No. Unlike some
football schools, academic
standards still come first
here, and from a purely ath
letic point of view this does
hurt the Card. There are
some great football players
who just don't have the
smarts to get accepted here.
The school also hasn't
deserted its other varsity
sports in search of gridiron
glory; winning 18 Directors'
Cups in a row is evidence
enough of that.
And in doing all of this,
Stanford hasn't just stayed

quirky; it has carved out a
unique niche. A destination
for those few high school
students blessed with both
athletic and intellectual
genius.
However hard it might
seem when times are bad,
uniqueness should be cele
brated, not sold out. The
CoHo will never be
Starbucks and Stanford will
never be USC, but maybe
that's a good thing.

Tom Taylor's editors think
this column may be a veiled
attempt to prevent The Daily
from "selling out" on its own
longtime columnist. Suggest
