## Stanford selling out on students 
### Tom Taylor 
So Stanford finally
sold us out. In the
space of one sum
mer it ripped out
part of Tresidder
Union and squeezed in a
shiny new Starbucks.
I'm sure there are lots of
you, both freshmen and
returning students, who will
disagree and welcome the
addition of this Seattle-born
behemoth, who welcome the
installation of a familiar fran
chise that will provide you
with a carbon-copy cup of
coffee to transport you back
to the identical Starbucks
across the street back home.
But you're wrong, and I'll tell
you why.
The first is that in selling
out to Starbucks, Stanford
took away one of the few
safe spaces we soccer fans
had here on campus. Many
were the times that I would
meet friends in the Tresidder
lounge at lunchtime to catch
a live UEFA Champions
League game, and we were
never alone. The tables were
always full and all faces were
inclined towards the flicker
ing screens.
Now the TVs are gone
and the options are more
limited. The couches in Old
Union are comfortable, but
there aren't many of them,
and going to CoHo or
Treehouse raises the moral
uncertainty of whether we
have to buy food there in
exchange for the right to
watch.
The second, bigger reason
is that Stanford prides itself
on being unique and quirky.
It could have offered the site
to a local company like Philz
Coffee (echoing the arrival
of Ike's Place on campus two

years back) or, even better,
given the space over to a stu
dent-run enterprise. It could
have also invested more time
and resources in the existing
coffee shop.
Is eveiyone a fan of the
CoHo? No. Is the coffee and
food always amazing?
Maybe not. Is it a central and
unique part of Stanford?
Unquestionably yes. Instead
of pasting in a bland, mass
produced copy of a Seattle
coffee house, why not sup
port a local institution that in
various guises dates back as
far as 1966?
Before ground was bro
ken on this new store, there
was no real coffee drought
afflicting the Farm. Within a
few minutes walk from
Tresidder, you can easily find
enough caffeine to keep you
buzzing all day, from the
three Coupa Cafes to the
Bookstore, Bytes and more.
And in the very same build
ing as the new Starbucks,
there was both a Peet's
Coffee (now closed) and
Stanford's very own CoHo.
If the powers that be had
applied this selling-out strat
egy to the Athletics
Department, you wouldn't
now be at a top-10 football
school. Back in 2006, the
Cardinal had a 1-11 season
without question, a terri
ble year. Meanwhile, USC
finished 11-2 and won the
Rose Bowl. The last time
Stanford had won any major
bowl game had been over 30
years before. If you could
ever justify cutting a football
program, maybe the Card
was making the case.
Doing so, though, would
