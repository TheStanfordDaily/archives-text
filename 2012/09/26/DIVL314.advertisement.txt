Aesthetics of Dissent the Case of Islamic Iran
Instructor: Abbas Milani
Day and Time: W10:00-11:50
Classroom: 300-303
Units: 2
Censorship, IBorges tells us, is the mother of
metaphors. The Islamic regime in Iran censors all
aesthetic production in the country. But Iranian
dissident artists, from filmmakers and fiction
writers to composers in a thriving underground
musical scene, have cleverly found ways to
fight these draconian measures. They have
developed an impressive body of work that is as
sophisticated in style as it is rich in its discourse
of democracy and dissent. The purpose of the
seminar is to understand the aesthetic tropes
of dissent in Iran and the social and theological
roots of rules of censorship. Masterpieces of
post-revolutionary film, fiction, and music will be
discussed in the context of tumultuous history of
dissent in Islamic Iran.

Past Desire Made Present The Traditions of Erotic
Poetry in Medieval Iran and Europe
Instructors: Dominic Parviz Brookshaw & Hans Ulrich
Gumbrecht
Day and Time: T 3:15-6:05
Classroom: School of Education, Room 313
Units: 3-5
Aims to make present and accessible, to our
early 21 st-century experience, convergences
and differences between medieval Persian and
medieval European love poetry. Poetry will be
dealt with as a discursive and institutional means
through which it is possible to make present and
tangible that which is absent—both in space
and time. If we accept that medieval Persian and
European love poetry conjured up moods of
homo- and heteroerotic desire for contemporary
audiences, then this desire can also become
present for us today through a close reading of
those same texts.
COMPUT 249A:
The Iranian Cinema: Image and Meaning
Instructor: Bahram Beyzaie
Day and Time: F 3:15-6:05
Classroom: Meyer, Room 143
Units: 1-3
This course will focus on the analysis of ten
Iranian films with the view of conducting a
discourse on the semiotics of Iranian art and
culture. Each session will be designated to
the viewing of a film by a prominent Iranian
filmmaker. Students are expected to prepare
for class by having previously examined
other available films by the filmmaker under
consideration.

Aesthetics of Dissent the Case of Islamic Iran
Instructor: Abbas Milani
Day and Time: W10:00-11:50
Classroom: 300-303
Units: 2
Censorship, IBorges tells us, is the mother of
metaphors. The Islamic regime in Iran censors all
aesthetic production in the country. But Iranian
dissident artists, from filmmakers and fiction
writers to composers in a thriving underground
musical scene, have cleverly found ways to
fight these draconian measures. They have
developed an impressive body of work that is as
sophisticated in style as it is rich in its discourse
of democracy and dissent. The purpose of the
seminar is to understand the aesthetic tropes
of dissent in Iran and the social and theological
roots of rules of censorship. Masterpieces of
post-revolutionary film, fiction, and music will be
discussed in the context of tumultuous history of
dissent in Islamic Iran.
COMPUT 125:
Past Desire Made Present The Traditions of Erotic
Poetry in Medieval Iran and Europe
Instructors: Dominic Parviz Brookshaw & Hans Ulrich
Gumbrecht
Day and Time: T 3:15-6:05
Classroom: School of Education, Room 313
Units: 3-5
Aims to make present and accessible, to our
early 21 st-century experience, convergences
and differences between medieval Persian and
medieval European love poetry. Poetry will be
dealt with as a discursive and institutional means
through which it is possible to make present and
tangible that which is absent—both in space
and time. If we accept that medieval Persian and
European love poetry conjured up moods of
homo- and heteroerotic desire for contemporary
audiences, then this desire can also become
present for us today through a close reading of
those same texts.
COMPUT 249A:
The Iranian Cinema: Image and Meaning
Instructor: Bahram Beyzaie
Day and Time: F 3:15-6:05

culture. Each session will be designated to
the viewing of a film by a prominent Iranian
filmmaker. Students are expected to prepare

other available films by the filmmaker under
consideration.
