## Replace the refs? No thanks 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Call me old-fashioned,
but I love the replace
ment referees. Miles,
how could you? Miles,
that's absurd. Miles, you
must have taken classes at Cal this
summer.
Maybe those things are true
except for the last one, because the
only time I set foot on the campus
of UC-Berkeley is when I feel like
Tebowing after winning the Ink
Bowl. But I love the NFL's replace
ment referees like Michael Vick
likes throwing interceptions, which
is to say I like them a lot.
Sure, I was watching the
Monday Night Football game in
which Seattle wide receiver Golden
Tate clearly shoved a defender in
order to catch a ball that was 90
percent in the defensive back's
chest. Of course I was shocked
when the referees reviewed the
play, ruled it a complete pass and
gave the Seahawks a last-second
win over the Green Bay Packers.
Yes, I agree that the play is already
one of the most infamous moments
in the history of the National
Football League.
But I view history differently.
See, I remember when Tom
Brady fumbled away his chance to
win the first playoff game of his
career, only to see a referee under a
hood give him a second chance
because of the "Tuck Rule," That
game had people all over the Bay
Area up in arms, because the
Raiders should have walked out of
Foxboro with a win.
I remember when Frank
Wycheck lateraled the ball to
Andre Dyson and Dyson ran
untouched into the end zone for
the Titans to win the "Music City
Miracle" and advance to the Super
Bowl in 2000. Except the ball prob
ably went forward, and the miracle
should never have happened.
And speaking of miracles, I
remember watching the video of
the 1972 AFC Divisional playoff
between the Raiders and the
Pittsburgh Steelers, which included
one of the most controversial calls
in all of sports: the "Immaculate
Reception."
Don Banks, a writer for Sports
Illustrated, said that with the excep
tion of JFK's assassination, "there
has been no piece of footage
poured over more than that catch."
All of those controversial calls,
and many, many more, have been
made over the years by profession
al referees doing their job as best
they could, which is to say not very
well. It's what keeps sports colum
nists employed and allows sports
radio talk show hosts, amateur
comedians and former NFL play
ers to be paid for being famous
while talking about football.
It's all part of a broader trend.
As Americans, we love to com
plain, and I'm by no means above
the fray. I complained earlier today
when my putt lipped out on the golf
course, when I realized I forgot my
favorite shower sandals at home
and when I couldn't find a duvet
cover to match my pillowcases.
But in sports, I realize that this is
entertainment for me as a fan and
not something that requires I be
morally outraged because the NFL
won't overpay the "real" referees
seriously, those guys make six
figures to work 10 hours a week
dressed as a safari animal and a
few bad calls happen.
To be honest, when I first saw
the play live, I just burst out laugh
ing, mainly because I knew that
things were about to get hilarious.
I was not disappointed. Packers
coach Mike McCarthy's press con
ference was hilarious, as was Aaron
Rodgers', as was the interview with
Tate, as was Stuart Scott's reading
of NFL Rule 8, Section 3, Article 1,
Item 5, like 17 times in two hours
on Sports Center.
Today, the soap opera contin
ued, as the president of the United
States called the outcome of the
game "terrible." The president.
Seriously.
You know who should be upset
about the blown call? The people
who bet on the game. Now this is
something I understand. It was an
early Christmas for Vegas bookies
when referee Wayne Elliot pointed
his arms skyward, as bettors lost
something on the order of $4OO mil
lion in a manner of seconds.
