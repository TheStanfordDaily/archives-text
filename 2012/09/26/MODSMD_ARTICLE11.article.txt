# BRING THE NOISE
## CROWD AGAINST HUSKIES FIGURES TO BE ROWDY 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
If you've heard music blasting throughout
campus in the late afternoons this week, have
no fear; it's just the Stanford football team
preparing for the raucous crowd that will
greet the Cardinal in Seattle for Thursday
night's game against the Washington Huskies.
Well, maybe that is something to fear;
while you can be relieved that the music isn't
coming from overeager freshmen partying in

a post-NSO frenzy, it does signify an enor
mous challenge for Stanford football. Any
road game with a first-year starting quarter
back is difficult, but heading to Century Link
Field, the only stadium in the country whose
fans have caused a minor earthquake, is cer
tainly cause for concern.
Besides the music, it's been a fairly
uneventful bye week on the Farm after
Stanford's stunning upset of No. 2 USC. At
Monday's weekly press conference, head
coach David Shaw, fresh off a busy weekend

of recruiting, provided a few important
updates on the health of the team. Junior run
ning back Anthony Wilkerson will miss
Thursday's game with a lower-leg injury.
Ricky Seale and Remound Wright are listed
as the replacements for Wilkerson on this
week's depth chart, and Shaw expects both to
see significant action in support of senior
Stepfan Taylor.
The other midweek news was much better

Senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy (93) is part of one of Stanford's best pass rushes in years. Murphy and co. will look to take advantage
of a depleted Washington offensive line when the No. 8 Cardinal takes on the Huskies at Century Link Field Thursday night on ESPN.
for the Card, as Shaw announced
that offensive tackle Andrus Peat
had his cast removed, finally giv
ing the freshman full use of his
hands. Peat has seen his playing
time increase week to week, and
though Shaw still believes that
David Yankey will start at left
tackle against Washington, Peat's
clean bill of health is a huge boost
for the team. At the very least, it
will allow Peat to be more effec
tive in his time as an extra offen
sive lineman for Stanford's
jumbo packages.
In the long term, it's a signifi
cant step forward in Peat's pro
gression towards becoming the
full-time starter at left tackle,
which would allow Stanford to
push Yankey back inside to his
natural left guard position.
Stanford wasn't the only team
in the matchup with important
injury news this week. On
Monday, Washington head coach
Steve Sarkisian announced that his
starting left guard, Colin Tanigawa,
will miss the rest of the 2012 sea
son, another devastating blow to
an already-hurting Huskies offen
sive line. Washington's updated
depth chart has only seven players
listed in the top two strings of the
offensive line, exposing a serious
lack of depth.
Stanford's pass rushers will be
licking their chops for this

matchup, including outside line
backer Trent Murphy, who on
Monday told reporters he plays
football for the feeling he gets
after sacking the quarterback.
The biggest change this week
for Stanford comes from off the
football field. Since the start of
classes on Monday, Shaw is "very
concerned" with his players'
ability to manage their time
strained schedules. This season
Stanford has additional cause for
worry, as this team relies on true
freshmen more than any
Stanford team in recent memory.
Though these freshmen do have
a bit of experience balancing
workouts and summer school,
they have never contributed to a
top-10 football program while
taking a difficult Stanford course
load.
Even if Stanford's student
athletes are successful in manag
ing their newfound difficulties,
some sacrifices are unavoidable.
The first casualty of heading
back to class this week has been
time for extra film study.
Fortunately for Stanford, with
last week being a bye week the
team had plenty of time to pre
pare for the difficult road trip
ahead. Moving forward though,
as the football schedule gets
back to normal and school picks
up, this time strain is certainly
something to pay attention to,
especially with Stanford's fresh
men.

listed in the top two strings of the
offensive line, exposing a serious
lack of depth.
Stanford's pass rushers will be
licking their chops for this

matchup, including outside line
backer Trent Murphy, who on
Monday told reporters he plays
football for the feeling he gets
after sacking the quarterback.
The biggest change this week
for Stanford comes from off the
football field. Since the start of
classes on Monday, Shaw is "very
concerned" with his players'
ability to manage their time
strained schedules. This season
Stanford has additional cause for
worry, as this team relies on true
freshmen more than any
Stanford team in recent memory.
Though these freshmen do have
a bit of experience balancing
workouts and summer school,
they have never contributed to a
top-10 football program while
taking a difficult Stanford course
load.
Even if Stanford's student
athletes are successful in manag
ing their newfound difficulties,
some sacrifices are unavoidable.
The first casualty of heading
back to class this week has been
time for extra film study.
Fortunately for Stanford, with
last week being a bye week the
team had plenty of time to pre
pare for the difficult road trip
ahead. Moving forward though,
as the football schedule gets
back to normal and school picks
up, this time strain is certainly
something to pay attention to,
especially with Stanford's fresh
men.
