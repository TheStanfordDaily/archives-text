# BRING THE NOISE
## CROWD AGAINST HUSKIES FIGURES TO BE ROWDY 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
If you've heard music blasting throughout
campus in the late afternoons this week, have
no fear; it's just the Stanford football team
preparing for the raucous crowd that will
greet the Cardinal in Seattle for Thursday
night's game against the Washington Huskies.
Well, maybe that is something to fear;
while you can be relieved that the music isn't
coming from overeager freshmen partying in

a post-NSO frenzy, it does signify an enor
mous challenge for Stanford football. Any
road game with a first-year starting quarter
back is difficult, but heading to Century Link
Field, the only stadium in the country whose
fans have caused a minor earthquake, is cer
tainly cause for concern.
Besides the music, it's been a fairly
uneventful bye week on the Farm after
Stanford's stunning upset of No. 2 USC. At
Monday's weekly press conference, head
coach David Shaw, fresh off a busy weekend

of recruiting, provided a few important
updates on the health of the team. Junior run
ning back Anthony Wilkerson will miss
Thursday's game with a lower-leg injury.
Ricky Seale and Remound Wright are listed
as the replacements for Wilkerson on this
week's depth chart, and Shaw expects both to
see significant action in support of senior
Stepfan Taylor.
The other midweek news was much better
