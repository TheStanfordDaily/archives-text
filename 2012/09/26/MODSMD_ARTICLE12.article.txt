## Stanford to add eight to Athletic Hall of Fame 
### 
Stanford has announced its annual
list of inductees to the Stanford
University Athletic Hall of Fame,
adding eight members to join the 381

'O2, Ron George '92, Larissa Fontaine
'99, Dan Hanan '9O, Misty Hyman '92
and Brad Hauser 'OO will all be honored

Walt Gamage, the longtime sports
editor of the Palo Alto Times, created
Stanford's Hall of Fame in 1954 as a
way to honor the University's most
accomplished athletes. Nominees were
selected by a committee headed by ath
letic department administrators, media
and former athletes.
The incoming class includes a 28-
time All-American swimmer who won
an individual gold medal at the 2000
Olympics, Hyman; Stanford's first
NCAA individual women's gymnastics
champion, Fontaine; and one of the
greatest Softball players of all time,
four-time first-team All-American and
two-time Olympian Mendoza.
