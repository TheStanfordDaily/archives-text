# NEW ERA IN THE POOL
## NEW COACH, FACES MARK NEW SEASON 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
It's hard to deny that a new era has arrived
for Stanford women's swimming and diving
as the storied program, home to nine NCAA
championships, prepares to embark on the
2012-13 season.
Gone is the sprint tandem of Sam
Woodward and Betsy Webb, a duo that led

the Cardinal 200- and 400-yard freestyle
relays to NCAA titles last season. Gone are
breaststroke specialists Jamie Bruce and
Kerry Kraemer, two veterans who provided
critical depth for a team that finished second
at the Pac-12 Championships and fourth at
the NCAA Championships.
But despite these heavy departures, the
Cardinal looks to be revitalized by an impres
sive freshmen class that features four top-50
recruits. Among the talented group is Sarah
Haase, a national high school record-holder
who has already broken the minute barrier in

With a new head coach, Greg Meehan, and a highly touted freshman class, the women's
swimming and diving team is hoping not to miss a beat after graduating several decorated
swimmers. Stanford kicks off its season Friday with a home meet against San Jose State.
the 100-yard breaststroke. Haase
is primed to make an immediate
impact as she joins sophomore
Katie Olsen for an effective one
two punch in the breaststroke
events.
While there will be some new
faces in the pool this season, the
coaching staff on deck is also
undergoing major changes. Head
coach Greg Meehan is taking the
reins on the heels of Lea
Maurer's decision to step down
from the role in early July citing
family reasons. Newly appointed
assistant coach Tracy Duchac,
who served as an assistant coach
at Arizona last season, has also
come aboard.
"The transition has gone
smoothly," Meehan commented.
"I've only been here for three
and a half weeks with the season
just starting, but it's been great so
far. I'm looking forward to the
season."
Meehan, the former associate

head men's swimming and diving
coach at Cal, inherits a program
that amassed two conference
titles, seven top-five NCAA fin
ishes and a 66-5 dual meet record
in the last seven seasons under
Maurer. He has plenty of experi
ence in guiding teams to extraor
dinary performances at the high
est level, testified to by the con
secutive national titles that the
Golden Bears have claimed in
the last two years.
"I'm very thankful for having
gotten the chance to work with
[Princeton women's head coach]
Susan Teeter, [UCLA women's
head coach] Cyndi Gallagher and
[Cal men's head coach] David
Durden," Meehan said. "I was
able to learn so much about
coaching from all of them."
Stressing the importance of
"building respect" within the
team early in the season, Meehan
hopes to make certain that his
swimmers become fully acclimat
ed to the coaching transition
before the practices crank up in
yardage and intensity.
Yet even with the inevitable
changes that occur every year,
the Cardinal still maintains a core

of determined swimmers hoping
to carry the team to a national
title that has eluded Stanford for
the past 14 seasons. Leading the
talented roster is standout junior
Maya Di√üado, a nine-time All-
American specializing in the
backstroke and individual med
ley events.
After finishing second at the
2011 NCAA in the 200-yard
backstroke, third in the 200-yard
individual medley and fourth in
the 400-yard individual medley,
the Santa Rosa native will be
contending for national titles in
the same three individual events
come March. Meehan credited
the "experience" she has accu
mulated from both grueling prac
tices and high-pressure competi
tions with giving her a special
edge.
Another swimmer who has
emerged on the national scene is
junior Felicia Lee, who notched a
12th place finish in the 100-yard
butterfly and a 15th place finish
in the 100-yard backstroke at the
NCAA Championships last sea
son. Lee suffered a shoulder
injury over the summer but has
been "getting back into the

water," according to Meehan a
promising sign for the team's
fastest sprinter in the butterfly
and backstroke events.
On the diving board, junior
Stephanie Phipps returns after
qualifying for the NCAA
Championships and earning All-
American status in back-to-back
seasons. Under the guidance of
head diving coach Rick
Schavone, who was part of Team
USA's Olympic coaching staff
this past summer, Phipps hopes
to enhance her status as one of
the best divers in not only the
Pac-12, but also in the nation. The
arrival of freshman Kelly Markle,
who finished ninth in the 3-meter

synchronized event at the 2012
US Olympic Trials, will also pro
vide a much-needed boost to the
diving squad.
One of the biggest challenges
that all Pac-12 teams must face is
to not only perform well at the
conference championships in
early March, but also to peak at
the NCAA Championships three
weeks later.
Stanford women's swimming
and diving will kick off its dual
meet season on Sept. 28 against
San Jose State at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
