# OPINIONS
## This election will be completely uninspiring. And that's a good thing. 
### John Murray 
I'll be the first to admit that I'm
still hung over from the patri
otic throw-down of the
Summer Olympics and have sub
sequently begun counting down
the days until beach volleyball
once again rules the primetime
airwaves. Part of the draw of the
Olympic games is their emphasis
on unique individual narratives of
triumph and perseverance a
huge part of Olympic patriotism is
just being able to look at these
various Americans and say
"Wow."
The Olympic torch is long
extinguished, and primetime news
has now shifted its focus to the
upcoming presidential election,
which has pretty much reversed
all of the work of the Olympics by
draining every bit of overzealous
patriotism from my bloodstream.
While the Olympics inspired me
to want to get up and go fight a
grizzly bear, this current election
has me wishing the bear could
knock me out till next February.
Let's turn back a few years.
In 2008, we had the war hero,
the maverick John McCain, pitted
against Barack Obama, a rising
hero of the optimistic left with
some high-flying rhetoric to boot.
Each candidate had a genuinely
interesting story. These were real
characters, each with his own pub
lic mythology. There was a certain
buzz from both the left and the
right. This time around? The best
we can do is Paul "P9ox" Ryan,
whose unique affections for Ayn
Rand and bow hunting managed
to create a decently interesting
character profile for about a
week.
Let's face it: Barack's lost his
charm. He may be the same per
son, but his narrative is no longer
what it used to be; he's no inspira
tional underdog anymore. "Yes
we can" now includes "in a little
bit." Only 37 percent of likely vot
ers believe America is headed in
the right direction the highest
level of optimism since June 2009.
And Romney, well, he never real
ly had any charm to begin with. To
put it bluntly, nobody really likes
him. Even Republicans don't like
him. Sure, a good number of peo
ple will vote for him, but it's cer
tainly not because they like him
personally or are attracted to his
story.
And what Romney lacks in
personality, he certainly isn't mak
ing up for in policy. A notorious
flip-flopper, the only consistent
position that Romney has held is
that he is not Obama. This leaves
us viewers back home with the
battle between the anti-Obama
and the watered-down Obama.
Yawwwwn. Not even Bob Costas
and a montage of childhood
struggles set to a piano ballad
could make either one of these
campaigns remotely inspiring.
They're boring. They're unin
spiring. Total duds. And they
might be exactly what we need.

I believe that there will be a sil
ver lining to Snorefest 2012 result
ing from the high levels of cyni
cism it has implanted in the
American masses. While wide
spread apathy and political dis
trust can be poisonous to democ
racy, in some ways I think this spe
cific instance of executive dullness
could help the American popu
lace take a good hard look at
themselves and the issues we
face.
There was an interesting piece
in Newsweek this past August dis
cussing human tendencies to fall
for scams (specifically financial
investment scams). Certainly, nei
ther campaign should be consid
ered a Ponzi scheme. However,
the get-rich-quick mentality that
draws naive investors is the same
one that suckers voters into a
campaign of lofty rhetoric and
expectation because they want a
quick, simple solution to all of
their problems.
My experience with presiden
tial elections is limited by my age,
but I've noticed a certain cycle
with at least these past two elec
tions: The closer we come to vot
ing day, the more certain voters
become that they're supporting
the guy, the one who will simulta
neously save our economy while
bringing peace to the Middle
East within his first week in
office. Testier You Tube exchanges
rise and break-room debates
escalate, and eventually we have
Chuck Norris and his wife sug
gesting that Obama's reelection
will trigger a thousand years of
darkness. (Seriously, Google
"Chuck Norris' dire warning.")
Issues aren't solved this way.
Obviously, electing the right peo
ple to office is important. But
endless bouts of commercials,
rhetoric and bumper sticker cam
paigning isn't going to provide a
cure, and in one aspect, these
campaigns end up diverting some
attention from the issues, com
pressing the complexities of our
problems into sound bites and
bullet points "platforms."
These candidates suck. Good.
Having a more sober conversa
tion is needed, and this might be
the start.
Then we can get to work on
bringing beach volleyball back.

to create a decently interesting
character profile for about a
week.
Let's face it: Barack's lost his
charm. He may be the same per
son, but his narrative is no longer
what it used to be; he's no inspira
tional underdog anymore. "Yes
we can" now includes "in a little
bit." Only 37 percent of likely vot
ers believe America is headed in
the right direction the highest
level of optimism since June 2009.
And Romney, well, he never real
ly had any charm to begin with. To
put it bluntly, nobody really likes
him. Even Republicans don't like
him. Sure, a good number of peo
ple will vote for him, but it's cer
tainly not because they like him
personally or are attracted to his
story.
And what Romney lacks in
personality, he certainly isn't mak
ing up for in policy. A notorious
flip-flopper, the only consistent
position that Romney has held is
that he is not Obama. This leaves
us viewers back home with the
battle between the anti-Obama
and the watered-down Obama.
Yawwwwn. Not even Bob Costas
and a montage of childhood
struggles set to a piano ballad
could make either one of these
campaigns remotely inspiring.
They're boring. They're unin
spiring. Total duds. And they
might be exactly what we need.

I believe that there will be a sil
ver lining to Snorefest 2012 result
ing from the high levels of cyni
cism it has implanted in the
American masses. While wide
spread apathy and political dis
trust can be poisonous to democ
racy, in some ways I think this spe
cific instance of executive dullness
could help the American popu
lace take a good hard look at
themselves and the issues we
face.
There was an interesting piece
in Newsweek this past August dis
cussing human tendencies to fall
for scams (specifically financial
investment scams). Certainly, nei
ther campaign should be consid
ered a Ponzi scheme. However,
the get-rich-quick mentality that
draws naive investors is the same
one that suckers voters into a
campaign of lofty rhetoric and
expectation because they want a
quick, simple solution to all of
their problems.
My experience with presiden
tial elections is limited by my age,
but I've noticed a certain cycle
with at least these past two elec
tions: The closer we come to vot
ing day, the more certain voters
become that they're supporting
the guy, the one who will simulta
neously save our economy while
bringing peace to the Middle
East within his first week in
office. Testier You Tube exchanges
rise and break-room debates
escalate, and eventually we have
Chuck Norris and his wife sug
gesting that Obama's reelection
will trigger a thousand years of
darkness. (Seriously, Google
"Chuck Norris' dire warning.")
Issues aren't solved this way.
Obviously, electing the right peo
ple to office is important. But
endless bouts of commercials,
rhetoric and bumper sticker cam
paigning isn't going to provide a
cure, and in one aspect, these
campaigns end up diverting some
attention from the issues, com
pressing the complexities of our
problems into sound bites and
bullet points "platforms."
These candidates suck. Good.
Having a more sober conversa
tion is needed, and this might be
the start.
Then we can get to work on
bringing beach volleyball back.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm
still hung over from the patri
otic throw-down of the
Summer Olympics and have sub
sequently begun counting down
the days until beach volleyball
once again rules the primetime
airwaves. Part of the draw of the
Olympic games is their emphasis
on unique individual narratives of
triumph and perseverance a
huge part of Olympic patriotism is
just being able to look at these
various Americans and say
"Wow."
The Olympic torch is long
extinguished, and primetime news
has now shifted its focus to the
upcoming presidential election,
which has pretty much reversed
all of the work of the Olympics by
draining every bit of overzealous
patriotism from my bloodstream.
While the Olympics inspired me
to want to get up and go fight a
grizzly bear, this current election
has me wishing the bear could
knock me out till next February.
Let's turn back a few years.
In 2008, we had the war hero,
the maverick John McCain, pitted
against Barack Obama, a rising
hero of the optimistic left with
some high-flying rhetoric to boot.
Each candidate had a genuinely
interesting story. These were real
characters, each with his own pub
lic mythology. There was a certain
buzz from both the left and the
right. This time around? The best
we can do is Paul "P9ox" Ryan,
whose unique affections for Ayn
Rand and bow hunting managed
to create a decently interesting
character profile for about a
