# Victim-blaming problem
## 
### Chris Herries 
What kind of intellectual
would I be if periods of
reflection didn't alter my
views? A poor one, no doubt.
Yesterday I read a Daily arti
cle about the recent string of sex
ual assaults on campus, written by
Ileana Najarro. In the article,
SARA Office Dean Angela
Exson is quoted as saying, "We
[the Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse Office]
encourage students to do whatev
er makes them feel more safe and
empowered in public spaces and
behind closed doors, but we pre
fer not to give advice on self
defense." This is done to avoid
victim-blaming, which is the very
unjust, very destructive practice
of asserting that a survivor of sex
ual assault is at fault. For exam
ple, it's often heard that, "she/he
shouldn't have been wearing
that," or "she/he should've fought
back." This attitude is wrong,
unhelpful and malicious.
However, I first thought that if
an advantage can be given, why
not give it? If running in groups,
watching your drinks and looking
out for each other at parties was
safer, then the SARA office and
the Women's Community Center
(WCC) should certainly be pro
moting them. After all, equipping

someone with safer habits is an
important task. However, as I
thought more about the issue I
had to change my stance and, for
the purpose of creating a dia
logue, I'll share why.
We have to consider what
niches are filled on campus sur
rounding sexual assault. Friends,
family, discussions during NSO
and various outreach programs
already offer students tips about
relationships, partying, alcohol,
consent, etc. I spoke to many of
my friends, both male and female.
They told me that most of these
measures are common knowl
edge and that most people pick
them up in the first few weeks of

school. The SARA office and the
WCC occupy a much different,
and much more important niche.
They represent organizations that
seek to influence the public con
scious about issues such as sexual
assault, and are in the business of
stigmatizing practices like victim
blaming. By purporting that some
action is a preventative measure
these organizations would be

implying that sexual assault is
preventable by the survivor. If
they were to teach safety meas
ures, then they're essentially say
ing that two parties are at fault in
assault cases, when it's obvious
that the perpetrator is solely
responsible. Therefore, if they
want to adhere to their ideologi
cal values, it would be irresponsi
ble to offer safety tips.

However, I'd like to know
what you think, namely, do these
offices have a responsibility to
support perceived safety meas
ures? Do these safety measures
qualify as preventative, and what
are the consequences of that type
of rhetoric?
