# Why I pretend to enjoy jogging
## 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Ever feel like one of the lawn
chairs on Lake Lag? Out of
place, without purpose,
exposed? Not without the big kind
of Life Purpose, but without the
purpose that Stanford students
find in having a task. Those lawn
chairs crack me up. I like to think
someone put them there more out
of an artistic impulse than a utili
tarian one, mostly because I never
see them being used as recliners.
There they are, unused and sun
bleached, scattered around the
bottom of an empty lake. They
invoke the same kind of humor an
installation exhibit at the MoMa
might. Only they do so accidental
ly, not intentionally.
I look around Stanford and
see an altar to productivity, self
betterment, business. And by

business I mean busy-ness.
Returning to campus after being
away for a while, the sense that
everyone is moving along at a trot
towards superhuman success is
amplified, and frightening. It's an
exceptional moment when I see a
student walking around aimlessly,
sans iPhone, laptop, running
shoes or crowd of pals. It's rare
that I venture out alone without
donning the Stanford armor of
productivity. When I do pause to
eat a sandwich by myself at
Tresidder, or choose to go adven
ture-walking, not jogging, I feel
pretty sketchy. Like I'm breaking
the rules. I feel like one of those
lawn chairs: out in the open, so
publicly unemployed I might as
well be on display. Free time gives
me the spooks.

Stanford political science pro
fessor Rob Reich showed me a
hauntingly prescient article by
David Brooks called "The
Organization Kid" that investi
gates a similar productivity fever
at Princeton. The article, pub
lished in 2001, gives some expla
nation for my squirminess with
free time. Maybe I'm the only one
whose skin crawls if I'm not
actively improving my intelli
gence or level of fitness, but I'm
resolving to learn how to do noth
ing and be comfortable with
unscheduled time. Join me?

Amused, confused, outraged that
Renee doesn't share your love of
sunbathing in the middle of Lake
Lag? Share your thoughts with
