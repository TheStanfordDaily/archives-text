and 2006 Stanford graduate Jake
Cornelius as the new assistant
coach on Monday.
A mechanical engineering
major while at Stanford,
Cornelius helped the Cardinal to
big victories over longtime rivals
California and Washington
before pursuing crew as a gradu

ate student at Cambridge
University.
Cornelius also competed in
the men's eight at the 2012
Olympic Games in London, fin
ishing fourth by three-tenths of a
second.
"Stanford Crew has given me
so much, and it's an honor to be
in a position to give something
back," Cornelius told
GoStanford.com. "I look forward
to helping coach Amerkhanian in
his relentless pursuit of victory
through integrity. In rowing, as in
life, half measures are insuffi
cient. My goal is to help these
young men redefine the term
'lOO percent,' both on the water
and in the classroom."
