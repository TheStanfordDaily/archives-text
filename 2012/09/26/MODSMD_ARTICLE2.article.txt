# Law report criticizes drone strikes
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
A joint Stanford Law School-
NYU School of Law report
released on Monday claims that
drone strikes conducted by the
CIA in northern Pakistan have
not made the United States
notably safer, arguing that evi
dence to that effect is "ambigu
ous at best," and that drone
strikes may in fact help militant
groups recruit members.
The 146-page report, titled
"Living Under Drones: Death,

Injury, and Trauma to Civilians
From U.S. Drone Practices in
Pakistan," is focused on the
Pakistani Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA), most specifi
cally on a region within FATA
known as North Waziristan.
"We're trying to . . . change
the terms of the debate so that
people recognize that... even if
we haven't declared war on
Pakistan and we haven't
for the people living under
drones, they feel as though
they're living in a war zone,"
Stanford Law School Professor

James Cavallero said.
Cavallero is one of the study's
lead authors along with Stanford
Clinical Lecturer Stephan
Sonnenberg and NYU School of
Law professor Sarah Knuckey.
The report was a collaboration
between Stanford's International
Human Rights and Conflict
Resolution Clinic and NYU
School of Law's Global Justice
Clinic.
Researchers went on two fact
finding investigations to the
Afghani-Pakistani border region,
speaking with more than 130

Pakistanis, many of whom are
victims or are related to victims
of drone strikes. Because FATA
is cordoned off by the Pakistani
military, the team had to arrange
for the 69 interview subjects who
live in FATA to go to Islamabad
or other cities outside FATA
region, a task Cavallero said was
exceptionally difficult.
"It was horrifying, talking to
somebody and having them tell
you that they've lost their leg and
they don't know why. All they
know is that a missile hit them,"
Stanford Law student and clinic

member Mohammad Ali said.
"One father had lost his son and
we asked him how he felt. For
him, no matter what we did, we
could listen to what he said, we
could apologize for our govern
ment's action, but it wasn't going
to bring [his son] back."
Interviewees reported that
they are wary of attending wed
dings or funerals for fear that the
drone operator at the CIA will
decide that the people at the
gathering are exhibiting a "pat
tern of life" that identifies them
as terrorists. The Obama admin
istration implemented the "pat
tern of life" standard for drone
strikes, which analyzes the activi
ties of unidentified groups to
determine plausible terrorist
affiliation.
"All of the interviews were
really moving to me because all
of the interviewees had come
such a long way and taken such a
risk, braving curfews and some
times violence to come and ...
spend one hour with our team
telling their story," said Omar
Shakir, another a member of the
Stanford Law clinic behind the
report.
"We hope that this report will
add to the chorus of voices
among society that are calling for
a reevaluation of our target
killing program," Shakir said.
Since the report was released,
numerous international news
organizations have picked up the
story including the BBC, CNN,
The Guardian, The Tos Angeles
Times, MSNBC and The New
York Times At War blog, which
said the report was "among the
most thorough on the subject to
date."
The Stanford clinic began
with a three-week seminar last
spring to prepare students for the
fieldwork. After the clinic was
complete, four of the students in
the clinic stayed through the
summer to assist in writing the
report.
"Much of the work and a lot
of the thinking and strategizing
and working through the report
is student work," Cavallero said.
"One thing you learn from the
human rights clinic is that law is
one avenue to bring about
change," Ali said. "Advocacy is
also very important. Along with
that goes critical thinking. There
are certain types of advocacy that
might end up harming your cause
sometimes, so you want to create
a human rights report that is
comprehensive and accurate and
respectful of all cultures."
The first sentences of the
report strongly takes to task how
drone use is perceived in the
United States:
"In the United States, the
dominant narrative about the use
of drones in Pakistan is of a sur
gically precise and effective tool
that makes the U.S. safer by

enabling 'targeted killings' of ter
rorists, with minimal downsides
or collateral impacts. This narra
tive is false."
The report goes on to high
light concerns with drone use
including that the U.S. govern
ment defines "militants" as all
males of military age absent of
exonerating evidence, the drone
strikes' effects on boosting anti-
Americanism and undermining
Pakistani democracy, the com
monplace "double-tap" strike
protocol (when a second strike
hits just as first-responders arrive
at the scene), and non-military
CIA personnel having control
over the drone strike program.
"We're a human rights clinic.

so we work on human rights
issues all over the world,"
Cavallero said. "Since we're
based in the United States, we
feel some obligation to assess the
policies and practices of the
United States to see if they are or
if they are not in compliance with
international law and interna
tional human rights legal norms."
Cavallero held that the chal
lenge now is figuring out how to
follow up on this report and fur
ther engage the issue of drone
strikes, depending on the recep
tion of Living Under Drones.
"There is some push-back
from people who are not happy
with what we're saying, there are
some blogs out there that are
attacking us, but I think what
they're going to find is that the
report is extremely well
researched and documented," he
said.
