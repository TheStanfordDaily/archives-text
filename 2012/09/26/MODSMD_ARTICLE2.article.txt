# Law report criticizes drone strikes
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
A joint Stanford Law School-
NYU School of Law report
released on Monday claims that
drone strikes conducted by the
CIA in northern Pakistan have
not made the United States
notably safer, arguing that evi
dence to that effect is "ambigu
ous at best," and that drone
strikes may in fact help militant
groups recruit members.
The 146-page report, titled
"Living Under Drones: Death,

Injury, and Trauma to Civilians
From U.S. Drone Practices in
Pakistan," is focused on the
Pakistani Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA), most specifi
cally on a region within FATA
known as North Waziristan.
"We're trying to . . . change
the terms of the debate so that
people recognize that... even if
we haven't declared war on
Pakistan and we haven't

drones, they feel as though
they're living in a war zone,"
Stanford Law School Professor

James Cavallero said.
Cavallero is one of the study's
lead authors along with Stanford
Clinical Lecturer Stephan
Sonnenberg and NYU School of
Law professor Sarah Knuckey.
The report was a collaboration
between Stanford's International
Human Rights and Conflict
Resolution Clinic and NYU
School of Law's Global Justice
Clinic.
Researchers went on two fact
finding investigations to the
Afghani-Pakistani border region,
speaking with more than 130

Pakistanis, many of whom are
victims or are related to victims
of drone strikes. Because FATA
is cordoned off by the Pakistani
military, the team had to arrange
for the 69 interview subjects who
live in FATA to go to Islamabad
or other cities outside FATA
region, a task Cavallero said was
exceptionally difficult.
"It was horrifying, talking to
somebody and having them tell
you that they've lost their leg and
they don't know why. All they
know is that a missile hit them,"
Stanford Law student and clinic

member Mohammad Ali said.
"One father had lost his son and
we asked him how he felt. For
him, no matter what we did, we
could listen to what he said, we
could apologize for our govern
ment's action, but it wasn't going
to bring [his son] back."
Interviewees reported that
they are wary of attending wed
dings or funerals for fear that the
drone operator at the CIA will
decide that the people at the
gathering are exhibiting a "pat
