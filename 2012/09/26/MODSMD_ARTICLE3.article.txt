## Wellness program expanded "Wellness suite" grows in response to rising demand 
### MARIANNE LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's course offerings
regarding the promotion of student
wellness, dubbed as the "Wellness
Suite" within the Department of
Athletics, will be expanded this aca
demic year.
According to Dr. Fred Luskin, a
senior consultant for the Stanford
Health Promotion Network and the
director of the Forgiveness Project,
Stanford plans to offer a three-quar
ter class sequence on basic wellness.
"We've been working in the
PhysEd department for the last cou
ple of years not just for [physical]
athletic classes but athletic classes
focused on wellness [and] health,"
said Luskin.
The sequence will include ATH
LETIC 201: Foundation of Wellness
1, focused primarily on diet, nutri
tion, exercise, and sleep, and ATH
LETIC 202: Foundations of
Wellness-2, focused on stress man
agement.
According to Luskin, the
Athletics Department is considering
issuing a certificate indicating a stu
dent has been given "lifelong train
ing in wellness" for students who
take the three-course sequence and
two additional courses.
"This is the very beginning, it's
still in the beta stages," he said.
Stanford began offering wellness
focused classes two years ago, accord
ing to Monica Hanson, who teaches
ATHLETIC 18: Strengthening the
Heart through Compassion. Although
Hanson's class limits enrollment
to 30 students, Carole Pertofsky,
director of Health Promotion
Services at Vaden, stated that
health and wellness classes can
range in size from 40 to 100 stu
dents. Luskin stated that Stanford
is among a handful of universities
teaching classes solely devoted to
student wellness.
"There has been a very strong
focus on research involving well
ness and our new program, I
THRlVE@Stanford, as well as
BeWell@Stanford ... [both] are
partners in offering students
practice-based curriculum," said
Pertofsky, who will teach PEDS

106/206: The Pursuit of
Happiness and Health with
Luskin in the winter.
The "Wellness suite" classes
attract a variety of students, and
demand for them is growing
steadily every year.
"We're attracting a mix of
undergraduates, graduates, uni
versity community members... we
have all different majors represent
ed," Hanson said. "[Strengthening
the Heart through Compassion]
began with 20 students the first
quarter and has been full ever
since."
According to Pertofsky, the
student wellness classes have also
received positive feedback from
students thus far.
"Our evaluations are excel
lent and students often remark
that they have gained life-long
skills in leading happier, more
vibrant lives," Pertofsky said.

Janet Genser 'l3 described the
quarter she took ATHLETIC
196: Practice of Happiness as her
"happiest quarter at Stanford."
Assignments ranged from ran
dom acts of kindness to maintain
ing a gratitude journal, to watch
ing films, to understanding how
classmates defined happiness.
Although the wellness classes
are popular, some students
remain skeptical of their efficacy.
"Happiness is too complex of
a thing to be boiled down to a
few steps, and there are many
ways that students can be happy,"
said Margaret Hayden 'l3, who
shopped ATHLETIC 196 and
decided to drop the class. "It's
more of an individual thing that
can't necessarily be taught in a
classroom setting."
