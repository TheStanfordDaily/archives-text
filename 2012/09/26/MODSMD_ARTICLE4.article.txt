## Nemerov appointment boosts arts initiative 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Alexander Nemerov stepped
down from his role as chair of
Yale's art history department last
spring to accept a new interdiscipli
nary position at Stanford, a move
representing the increased focus on
art's role on campus.
"Nemerov coming is a confirma
tion of the ambition and goals of
the arts initiative," said Bryan Wolf,
former co-director of the Stanford
Arts Initiative.
Nemerov, a renowned American
art and cultural historian, beat out
numerous candidates in a two-year
search to fill an endowed position
in the Art and Art History
Department in conjunction with
the Stanford Arts Initiative. The
Carl and Marilyn Thoma family
donated the endowment for the
position, requesting that it be filled
by a professor with background in
art history and the humanities.
Nemerov served as an associate

professor at Stanford before leav
ing in 2001 to become chair of
Yale's Department of the History
of Art, where according to an arti
cle in the Yale Daily News, he
taught one of the most popular
introductory art history courses.
Nancy Troy, chair of the
Stanford Department of Art and
Art History, said Nemerov's com
mitment to his field would have a
positive impact.
"By making Stanford the locus
of which those energies are going to
be realized, he is helping Stanford
to become a really vibrant commu
nity," Troy said.
Nemerov said he will greatly
miss New Haven's proximity to
numerous renowned museums, but
recognizes that Stanford also offers
valuable resources including the
Cantor Arts Center where he
teaches a section for his fall quarter
introductory class.
