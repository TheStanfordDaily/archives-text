## Nemerov appointment boosts arts initiative 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Alexander Nemerov stepped
down from his role as chair of
Yale's art history department last
spring to accept a new interdiscipli
nary position at Stanford, a move
representing the increased focus on
art's role on campus.
"Nemerov coming is a confirma
tion of the ambition and goals of
the arts initiative," said Bryan Wolf,
former co-director of the Stanford
Arts Initiative.
Nemerov, a renowned American
art and cultural historian, beat out
numerous candidates in a two-year
search to fill an endowed position
in the Art and Art History
Department in conjunction with
the Stanford Arts Initiative. The
Carl and Marilyn Thoma family
donated the endowment for the
position, requesting that it be filled
by a professor with background in
art history and the humanities.
Nemerov served as an associate

professor at Stanford before leav
ing in 2001 to become chair of
Yale's Department of the History
of Art, where according to an arti
cle in the Yale Daily News, he
taught one of the most popular
introductory art history courses.
Nancy Troy, chair of the
Stanford Department of Art and
Art History, said Nemerov's com
mitment to his field would have a
positive impact.
"By making Stanford the locus
of which those energies are going to
be realized, he is helping Stanford
to become a really vibrant commu
nity," Troy said.
Nemerov said he will greatly
miss New Haven's proximity to
numerous renowned museums, but
recognizes that Stanford also offers
valuable resources including the
Cantor Arts Center where he
teaches a section for his fall quarter
introductory class.
Troy echoed Nemerov's senti

ments, stating "as a discipline, art
history has traditionally been
located on the East Coast."
She added that Nemerov
came back to Stanford at an ideal
time when the study of art has
grown in visibility.
"It's new that the West Coast
would make the commitment to
making a place where people
would want to come to study art,"
Troy said. "That's maybe even
more the case with Stanford
where the institution is known
more for science, engineering,
medicine and other disciplines."
Nemerov, who specializes in
American art history, film and lit
erature, can attest to the growing
benefits of returning to the West
Coast.
"A lot of my work is about
film actually, so the connection
to Los Angeles for me is as
meaningful or more meaningful
than the proximity to New York
when I was at Yale," Nemerov
said.
The ability to further engage
with Stanford's developing art
programs and make a "grass
roots contribution" was ulti
mately the reason Nemerov said
he took up Stanford's offer.
"My purpose is to teach my
passion for works of art and to
give students something to think
about, something to imagine
about how art might matter in

their lives too," Nemerov said, "I
think it's more than an academic
subject, it's my life,"
Nemerov will be teaching
three undergraduate courses
one each quarter and one
graduate course. He will also be
working with graduate students
in the department.
Nemerov's focus on the emo
tional power of art and its per
sonal connection to those who
study it ties in with the goals set
forth by the Stanford Arts
Initiative that helped gather the
funds necessary to create the
new position.
"The goals of [the Stanford
Arts Initiative] were to expand
and deepen the range of both the
humanities and the arts as part of
the everyday life of Stanford for
undergraduates, graduates and
faculty," Wolf said.
As part of the six-year
Stanford Challenge, the Stanford
Arts Initiative helped create new
positions in the arts, establish
new programs like the ongoing
Stanford Institute for Creative
Arts (SiCA) and bring the arts to
classes that are generally not
arts-centric and offer grants,
according to Wolf.
Nemerov hopes that his stu
dents will be able to engage in
the arts in away that is personal
ly fulfilling. To reach greater
audiences in a similar way, he is
currently working with the
Cantor Arts Center to hold an
exhibition on his specialties.

in the Art and Art History
Department in conjunction with
the Stanford Arts Initiative. The
Carl and Marilyn Thoma family
donated the endowment for the
position, requesting that it be filled
by a professor with background in
art history and the humanities.
Nemerov served as an associate

professor at Stanford before leav
ing in 2001 to become chair of
Yale's Department of the History
of Art, where according to an arti
cle in the Yale Daily News, he
taught one of the most popular
introductory art history courses.
Nancy Troy, chair of the
Stanford Department of Art and
Art History, said Nemerov's com
mitment to his field would have a
positive impact.
"By making Stanford the locus
of which those energies are going to
be realized, he is helping Stanford
to become a really vibrant commu
nity," Troy said.
Nemerov said he will greatly
miss New Haven's proximity to
numerous renowned museums, but
recognizes that Stanford also offers
valuable resources including the
Cantor Arts Center where he
teaches a section for his fall quarter
introductory class.
Troy echoed Nemerov's senti

ments, stating "as a discipline, art
history has traditionally been
located on the East Coast."
She added that Nemerov
came back to Stanford at an ideal
time when the study of art has
grown in visibility.
"It's new that the West Coast
would make the commitment to
making a place where people
would want to come to study art,"
Troy said. "That's maybe even
more the case with Stanford
where the institution is known
more for science, engineering,
medicine and other disciplines."
Nemerov, who specializes in
American art history, film and lit
erature, can attest to the growing
benefits of returning to the West
Coast.
"A lot of my work is about
film actually, so the connection
to Los Angeles for me is as
meaningful or more meaningful
than the proximity to New York
when I was at Yale," Nemerov
said.
The ability to further engage
with Stanford's developing art
programs and make a "grass
roots contribution" was ulti
mately the reason Nemerov said
he took up Stanford's offer.
"My purpose is to teach my
passion for works of art and to
give students something to think
about, something to imagine
about how art might matter in

their lives too," Nemerov said, "I
think it's more than an academic
subject, it's my life,"
Nemerov will be teaching
three undergraduate courses
one each quarter and one
graduate course. He will also be
working with graduate students
in the department.
Nemerov's focus on the emo
tional power of art and its per
sonal connection to those who
study it ties in with the goals set
forth by the Stanford Arts
Initiative that helped gather the
funds necessary to create the
new position.
"The goals of [the Stanford
Arts Initiative] were to expand
and deepen the range of both the
humanities and the arts as part of
the everyday life of Stanford for
undergraduates, graduates and
faculty," Wolf said.
As part of the six-year
Stanford Challenge, the Stanford
Arts Initiative helped create new
positions in the arts, establish
new programs like the ongoing
Stanford Institute for Creative
Arts (SiCA) and bring the arts to
classes that are generally not
arts-centric and offer grants,
according to Wolf.
Nemerov hopes that his stu
dents will be able to engage in
the arts in away that is personal
ly fulfilling. To reach greater
audiences in a similar way, he is
currently working with the
Cantor Arts Center to hold an
exhibition on his specialties.
