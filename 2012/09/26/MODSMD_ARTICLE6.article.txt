# STUDENT GROUPS
## A 						look inside the Solar Car Project Stanford's internationally recognized team prides itself on an inclusive team dynamic 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Solar Car team is recognized as
one of the best in the world, though where they
work remains a mystery to many.
Based in the Volkswagen Automotive
Innovation Lab, a small building on the outskirts
of West Campus, the team competes internation
ally in the World Solar Challenge, a race of high
efficiency solar-powered vehicles across 3,000 km
of thunderstorms and brushfires in the Australian
outback. In 2011, the team's design, a car called
Xenith, placed 11th overall against 40 other com
petitors representing universities around the
world.
"One of the biggest successes of Xenith was
our solar array," said Theodore Wesley Ford 'l3,

The Stanford Solar Car project's 2011 entry into the World Solar Challenge, a car named Xenith, placed 11th overall against
40 other competitors representing universities around the world. The car had cutting-edge innovations like glass encapsulant.
Solar Car's team lead. Xenith, the name
of the team's car, had a tremendous
power output, thanks to world record
holding solar cell capabilities and innova
tions like glass encapsulant. In fact, after
the race, the team took a sample of their
solar cells to the National Renewal
Energy Lab in Denver for some inde
pendent testing and verified that their
panels rivaled, if not bested, industry
standard panels.
However, the integration of new inno
vative technology into the car led to a sig
nificant downside: problems with the vehi
cle's operation during the race. According
to Ford, the team will now plan to design
for reliability.
"We want to maintain our innovative
edge, bringing the best technologies in
solar car racing while building a vehicle
robust enough to hold up to racing condi
tions in the Aussie outback," he said.
The team races a brand-new car every
two years and chooses to design cars from
ground up in order to bring the best tech
nologies of the year into the vehicle. With
a tight schedule for designing, manufactur
ing and testing the vehicle, it's a challenge

for the team members all volunteers
to balance their academic and social lives.
"That's what makes the project excit
ing," Ford said. "Not many student groups,
or even research groups, on campus get to
build a full-sized vehicle. It's a huge
endeavor."
Despite all the achievements and acco
lades heaped on the team, people of all
backgrounds and majors are encouraged
to work on projects in the vehicle lab.
"On my first day [in the lab], I came in
and built a hinge mount for [software com
pany] Apogee," said Daniel Posch 'l3, a
longtime Stanford Solar Car team member.
This freedom to work independently
doesn't mean the team has no structure.
From a group of dozens of students, sub
teams are organized in such away so that
each one designs and manufactures a spe
cific part of the car's complex structure,
like lines of code from the "top-down"
programming methods taught in even the
most introductory computer science class
es at Stanford.
But the completion of the car requires
more than just brains, hard work and solar
power. Running Xenith in the World Solar

Car challenge costs $500,000 money the
team must raise in order to give the cham
pionship another shot.
"We get most of our funding through
special fees from ASSU, which is really
helpful," explained team member Carole
Ann Bradley 'l3. "Basically we reach out
to companies who we think would be a
great match to us. We fundraise mainly
through outreach and reach out personally
to sponsors."
She added that the team's completed
cars also travel around the world, some
times attending major sponsors' corporate
events.
But no matter the team's success,
Bradley emphasizes the team still runs off
inclusiveness and learning through mis
takes.
"It's super accessible," she said. "Solar
Car is where you can learn more about
yourself too. It's less of a pet project for
someone ... and more like where you fig
ure out where you fit in place on the team
and what you think is best."

ing," Ford said. "Not many student groups,
or even research groups, on campus get to
build a full-sized vehicle. It's a huge
endeavor."
Despite all the achievements and acco
lades heaped on the team, people of all
backgrounds and majors are encouraged
to work on projects in the vehicle lab.
"On my first day [in the lab], I came in
and built a hinge mount for [software com
pany] Apogee," said Daniel Posch 'l3, a
longtime Stanford Solar Car team member.
This freedom to work independently
doesn't mean the team has no structure.
From a group of dozens of students, sub
teams are organized in such away so that
each one designs and manufactures a spe
cific part of the car's complex structure,
like lines of code from the "top-down"
programming methods taught in even the
most introductory computer science class
es at Stanford.
But the completion of the car requires
more than just brains, hard work and solar
power. Running Xenith in the World Solar

Car challenge costs $500,000 money the
team must raise in order to give the cham
pionship another shot.
"We get most of our funding through
special fees from ASSU, which is really
helpful," explained team member Carole
Ann Bradley 'l3. "Basically we reach out
to companies who we think would be a
great match to us. We fundraise mainly
through outreach and reach out personally
to sponsors."
She added that the team's completed
cars also travel around the world, some
times attending major sponsors' corporate
events.
But no matter the team's success,
Bradley emphasizes the team still runs off
inclusiveness and learning through mis
takes.
"It's super accessible," she said. "Solar
Car is where you can learn more about
yourself too. It's less of a pet project for
someone ... and more like where you fig
ure out where you fit in place on the team
and what you think is best."
