## ASSU approves new funds Full Moon on the Quad, Sigma Nu Endless Summer among recipients 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
appropriated more than $ll,OOO to stu
dent organizations in its first on-campus
meeting of the academic year. The
money will go toward various student
groups' early quarter programming,
including $2,071 for Sigma Nu's upcom
ing Sept. 29 all-campus day party,
Endless Summer.
The senior class presidents requested
an additional $5OO from the Senate for
their schoolwide tailgate scheduled for
Sept. 27. Although they had not yet writ
ten a bill with their proposal, a few sena
tors, including Appropriations Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4, Senate Chair Branden
Crouch 'l4, and Co-Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5, assured the senior class pres
ident representatives that they would
retroactively be granted $5OO next week
from the traditions fund, which is appro
priated at the discretion of the Senate.
In an interview after the meeting,
Pham said the Senate had discussed
approving the $5OO and that she antici
pates the bill will pass.
The Senate also granted $3,500 of the
$12,000 traditions fund to the sophomore
class presidents for Full Moon on the
Quad (FMOTQ) programming.
They had previously held an emer
gency meeting over email on the week
end of Aug. 11 to approve FMOTQ fund
ing, though the email announcing the
meeting did not include a link to the bill,
a budget for the event or the exact
amount being requested. The "motion"
was approved unanimously.
The virtual vote was invalid because
"the bill wasn't actually officially writ
ten," according to Pham.
Instead, Pham presented a re-drafted
bill to the senators at Tuesday's meeting
and the proposal again passed unani
mously. Because such a bill would gener
ally require earlier notice so that sena
tors have a week to more thoroughly
consider the request, the senators sus
pended their bylaws so they could vote
before the event on Oct. 1.
Though student groups received the
funding they asked for, not all attendees
were satisfied by the Senate's conduct.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3, a past elections
commissioner now working as an assis
tant to the CEO of Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE), expressed frustration
about the senators' lack of familiarity
with ASSU policies and perceived empty
promises of reform.
"I've heard hundreds of people talk
about fixing the ASSU and never really
heard what we're trying to fix it into
becoming," Trusheim said, after deliver
ing an update on behalf of SSE. He
encouraged senators to consider the mis
sion of ASSU and continue to educate
themselves on its regulations.
The senators spent the remainder of
the meeting delivering committee
updates, which mostly concerned internal
initiatives. They summarized the 60-page
ASSU Constitution, approved general
fees bills and discussed coordinating out
reach to freshmen, which includes
rebranding the ASSU image and revising
the Senate's website.
