## Wireless cardiac tech shows promise 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
New wireless technology developed by
Stanford researchers could eliminate the need
for batteries in implantable medical devices.
A team of researchers, led by assistant
professor of electrical engineering Ada
Poon, designed a new kind of medical
device that functions on radio waves rather
than a battery. This technology allows
implantable devices to be driven by a small
power source that can be worn on the out
side of the body.
"Batteries suffer from two flaws that are
fatal for many applications," wrote John Ho,
a graduate student who worked on the
device, in an email to The Daily. "One, they
are large typically several centimeters in
one dimension. Two, they must be periodi
cally replaced, which requires surgery."
While batteries are notoriously bulky,
the device created by Poon's team can be

contained in a cube that measures 0.8 mil
limeters on each side, meaning it can fit on
the head of a pin.
The team hopes that removing the bat
tery could lead to the creation of medical
devices, such as permanent pacemakers or
swallowable endoscopes, which will let doc
tors get an inside view of intestinal tracts
without any pain.
"We envision tiny devices that can relay
vital information outside the body, move
through the bloodstream or even perform
local interventions," Ho said.
Despite the potential for advancement
that this device provides, however,
researchers are still working to ensure that
complications with human tissue heating do
not arise as a result of the wireless technol
ogy, according to Sanghoek Kim, another
doctoral candidate in Poon's lab who assist
ed with the research.
Kim, whose role focused on power-trans
fer efficiency, said that human tissue can be

a "lossy medium," meaning that it is impor
tant to ensure that the wireless power is
transferred to the device properly instead of
being lost in the body as heat.
The research team said stringent
Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers regulations were met in order to
ensure that the device does not overheat to
the point at which excessive damage occurs
to the human body.
Other potential complications include the
unpredictable nature of a wireless link, which
could require a backup power source to be
implemented for life-or-death devices, like
pacemakers. The team is continuing to work
on perfecting the device and finding solu
tions to problems such as this.
"Overall [this technology] will make
patients more comfortable, and surgery
more simple and less dangerous," Kim said.
