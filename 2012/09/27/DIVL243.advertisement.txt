alternative, independent theatre group, Mehr, in 1966
and was the editor-in-chief of a theatrical and literary
periodical between 1968 and 1972. Mehr, which

became very influential in the field, competing with
other well-financed, state-sponsored theatre groups
until it was closed down by the SAVAK, the Shah's
secret police in 1974. All members of the group were
arrested and Rahmaninejad was sentenced to 12
years in prison but freed in 1979 by the revolution
that toppled the Shah's regime.

NASSER RAHMANINEJAD
Nasser Rahmaninejad, a celebrated Iranian artist,
started his career in theatre in 1959 Iran. In response
to the authoritarian cultural policies and harsh
censorship of the Shah's regime, he founded his
alternative, independent theatre group, Mehr, in 1966
and was the editor-in-chief of a theatrical and literary
periodical between 1968 and 1972. Mehr, which
later changed its name to Iran Theatre Association,
became very influential in the field, competing with
other well-financed, state-sponsored theatre groups
until it was closed down by the SAVAK, the Shah's
secret police in 1974. All members of the group were
arrested and Rahmaninejad was sentenced to 12
years in prison but freed in 1979 by the revolution
that toppled the Shah's regime.
