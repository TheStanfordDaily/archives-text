From Generation to Generation
Scientific and Cultural Approaches to Jewish Genetics
u
For decades, scholars have been drawing on the methods and findings
of genetics to study interactions between biology and culture in Jewish
populations, to combat racist notions of the Jews, to investigate
diseases common to Jewish subgroups, and to illuminate the origins
of the Jewish people. This interdisciplinary series aims to introduce the
ways in which scientists today are using genetics to understand Jewish
history and disease, and to explore the cultural and social questions
that emerge from the study of Jewish genetics.
All presentations will take place on successive
Thursdays From 4-5:30 pm in Herrin Hall, Room T175
and are Free and open to the public.
StanFord students may enroll For the course as a one
unit pass/Fail course (Biology 127/ Jewish Studies 117).
This program is the initiative of theTaube Center For Jewish Studies and Stanford's Department
of Biology and made possible by a generous grant from The Koret Foundation.
Co-sponsors include:
Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity; Ecology and Evolution Group; Morrison
Institute for Population and Resource Studies; Stanford Center For Population Research;
Institute for Research in the Social Sciences and StanFord Continuing Studies.
This series of guest lectures aims to explore the
connections between genetics and Jewish Studies.
