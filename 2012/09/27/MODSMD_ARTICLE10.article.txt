# Study shows cystic fibrosis patients lack diverse microbiome
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
A Stanford Medical School study has concluded that
the microbiome the collective genetic material of
microbes in a given environment in a healthy human
lung is far less diverse than that of a cystic fibrosis patient.
This lack of diversity is as dangerous as the presence
of an individual infectious agent, according to the
researchers.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease causing thick
mucus in the lungs and digestive tract that causes
chronic lung disorders. The research in this study
showed that the presence of already well-documented
pathogens is not the only differentiating factor about
the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
The researchers used sputum samples the mucus
of the lower respiratory tract from 16 people with
and nine people without cystic fibrosis to compare
microbe communities.
The study, co-authored by Stanford researchers
Paul Blainey, David Cornfield, Carlos Milla and
Stephen Quake, was published online Wednesday
morning in Science Translational Medicine.
