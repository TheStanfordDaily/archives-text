# OPINIONS
## EDITORIAL When the wind of freedom falters 
### 
We share the disap
pointment of the Chi
Theta Chi Alumni
Board, expressed in a
clear and compelling op-ed, in the
University's decision to not
renew XOX's ground lease, effec
tive this year.
Moreover, we feel that the
decision is part of a broader, sys
tematic effort by Residential &
Dining Enterprises and the
Office of the Vice-Provost for
Student Affairs to bring
Stanford's many and diverse
housing and dining options under
increasing levels of centralized
control. This is an effort that
threatens to permanently under
mine this University's long-stand
ing traditions of student inde
pendence.
Student self-reliance has
always been a hallmark of a com
plete Stanford education. Leland
and Jane Stanford explicitly
endowed a university grounded
in the freewheeling spirit of the
West, intended not simply to
mold its students into fine
thinkers but into men and women
of action and vigor in their
words, "to qualify students for
personal success and direct use
fulness in life."
From the days when students
served as ushers at football games
to help pay their way through
school to the age-old custom of
student hashing in the kitchens,
independence and hard work
have animated generations of
Stanford students.
This is an independence that
continues to manifest itself in the
high levels of trust this University
has long vested in us, the student
body. From campus alcohol poli
cy, which has effectively allowed
students to drink while underage
as long as they do so responsibly,
to the wide latitude granted stu
dents searching for a major (you
can choose from interdisciplinary
majors offered nowhere else, and
even make up your own), to its
pioneering approach to coed liv
ing arrangements, David Starr
Jordan's "College of the West"
has long trusted us to make
responsible decisions and handle
our personal lives with minimal
interference from above.
This is changing.
In 2011, R&DE began to
clamp down on the Row, citing a
desire "to bring the Row program
closer in line with the rest of the
University" and an intent to

"increase oversight of all opera
tional and financial activities in
Res Ed." House dues were stan
dardized, social dues were rerout
ed through students' University
bills rather than house financial
managers, and vendors began to
be paid through the University
administered Row Central Office
rather than by individual FMs.
Also in 2011, R&DE began to
exert increasing levels of control
over the Suites Dining Societies
on West Campus, flying in the face
of 25 years of competent student
management. Administrators threat
ened to replace experienced stu
dent-elected management with
expensive outside vendors
(including a contracting company
headed by the brother-in-law of
ResEd assistant director Zac
Sargeant), acquired control of
Suites residents' board bills and
their distribution, forced cuts in
pay to student hashers and placed
the jobs of long-serving chefs in
jeopardy. These changes signifi
cantly raised overhead costs for
student management and created
unnecessary inefficiencies for both
Suites residents and staff.
So far this year, in addition to
the XOX debacle, the University
has threatened to paint over the
community murals at Columbae
and imposed an authoritarian
ban on hard alcohol even for
students over 21 during the
summer session.
We could go on at some length,
but the story is the same every
where: more standardization,
more centralization, more homo
geneity. XOX is only the latest
casualty of what appears to be a
comprehensive plan to mitigate
University risk at the expense of
the student experience.
We believe this is a larger prob
lem than Chi Theta Chi. We
encourage anyone who is con
cerned about maintaining diversi
ty and independence in student
housing and dining to support
XOX.
But we also encourage XOX
residents and supporters to rec
ognize that their problems with
University administration are not
unique; they are part of a broader
pattern that requires broader
solutions. And some of this com
munication failure must lie on
their shoulders. The residents of
XOX have failed to show the
broader community that their sit-

alienated many of the very
groups they should be
reaching out to for support.
Comments on stories fea
tured on this website decry a
Stanford where students,
"work on startups that we're
only interested in because
they could make us rich, and
justify it all as hip Bay Area
individualism and have wet
dreams about becoming the
next Mark Zuckerfuck."
They label R&DE's decision
as a, "chimeric triumph of
capitalism, a debilitating and
isolating overemphasis on
sticking it alone, which is pre
cisely at odds with the coop
erative spirit of Chi Theta
Chi."
Another comment reads,
"Our administration won't
be happy until every student
is a fucking start-up obsessed

facebooking premed drone
who quietly finishes their
degree with all A's and then
goes on to pour their corpo
rate paychecks into the
alumni donation coffers."
And another, written by
former XOX resident Peter
McDonald, reads, "Yeah bro,
who needs community when
you're making THIS MUCH
MONEY, amirite business
school? Econ majors? Startup
bros? I mean seriously, have
you seen how much money
Stanford is making? I'd glad
ly spend all four years in a
sensory deprivation chamber
if it meant I got to make
THAT MUCH MONEY
coming out. Money is so awe
some!"
XOX's most vocal sup
porters deride and alienate
anyone who is interested in
starting his or her own com
pany, other co-ops that pro
mote alternative cultures, stu
dents who want to get all As
on their transcripts and any
one who doesn't inherently
dislike money and capital
ism. That's too large a chunk

of the student body to chew
out, especially when you
should be building bridges
instead of burning them.
Whether we are econ
majors or dedicated artists,
residents of Chi Theta Chi or
Crothers, we all have an inter
est in defending the diversity
and independence that have
long made the Stanford expe
rience unique. On this issue
we stand and fall together,
and we should work together
to solve what has now
become everyone's problem.
It may be too late to save
Chi Theta Chi. But this will
not be the last erosion of stu
dent independence. Whether
you are a member of a
Greek community increas
ingly restricted by unfair
policies, a freshman who can
no longer bring alcohol to
your friends' dorms or part
of a student government that
must increasingly fight the
University bureaucracy, we
must all speak out against
infringements on student
independence, wherever
they are found.

high levels of trust this University

In 2011, R&DE began to
clamp down on the Row, citing a
desire "to bring the Row program
closer in line with the rest of the
University" and an intent to

"increase oversight of all opera
tional and financial activities in
Res Ed." House dues were stan
dardized, social dues were rerout
ed through students' University
bills rather than house financial
managers, and vendors began to
be paid through the University
administered Row Central Office
rather than by individual FMs.
Also in 2011, R&DE began to
exert increasing levels of control
over the Suites Dining Societies
on West Campus, flying in the face
of 25 years of competent student
management. Administrators threat
ened to replace experienced stu
dent-elected management with
expensive outside vendors
(including a contracting company
headed by the brother-in-law of
ResEd assistant director Zac
Sargeant), acquired control of
Suites residents' board bills and
their distribution, forced cuts in
pay to student hashers and placed
the jobs of long-serving chefs in
jeopardy. These changes signifi
cantly raised overhead costs for
student management and created
unnecessary inefficiencies for both
Suites residents and staff.
So far this year, in addition to
the XOX debacle, the University
has threatened to paint over the
community murals at Columbae
and imposed an authoritarian
ban on hard alcohol even for
students over 21 during the
summer session.
We could go on at some length,
but the story is the same every
where: more standardization,
more centralization, more homo
geneity. XOX is only the latest
casualty of what appears to be a
comprehensive plan to mitigate
University risk at the expense of
the student experience.
We believe this is a larger prob

encourage anyone who is con

housing and dining to support
XOX.
But we also encourage XOX
residents and supporters to rec

University administration are not

Whether we are econ

we stand and fall together,

they are found.
We share the disap

Board, expressed in a
clear and compelling op-ed, in the
University's decision to not
renew XOX's ground lease, effec

Moreover, we feel that the
decision is part of a broader, sys
tematic effort by Residential &
Dining Enterprises and the
Office of the Vice-Provost for
Student Affairs to bring
Stanford's many and diverse
housing and dining options under
increasing levels of centralized
control. This is an effort that
threatens to permanently under

Student self-reliance has
always been a hallmark of a com

in the freewheeling spirit of the
West, intended not simply to
mold its students into fine
thinkers but into men and women
of action and vigor in their
words, "to qualify students for
personal success and direct use
fulness in life."
From the days when students
served as ushers at football games
