# When Stanford and home collide
## 
### Annie Graham 
We're back in class! And
this past week inspires
many questions: How will
our lives change this school year,
how will our minds expand, why is
Mitt Romney's skin so tan? Each
has a spectrum of unique answers
(one cannot even be deciphered
by consensus on the Internet
try it), and while the prospect of
the work ahead makes my palms
sweaty, I'm so glad to be back with
this student body. I spent the sum
mer at Stanford as a resident assis
tant to some pretty cool high
school students, but the campus
was dominated by conferences,
kids' camps and eerie quiet after
10 p.m. Arriving back at the
Stanford where students don't
have to check in for curfew and at
least three-quarters of them know
their way around is like being
home again.
I'm a junior now. And though
I've always loved school, it's taken
about this long to feel like Stanford
is truly a home away from home

a place where I have a family of
friends and familiar faces. I'm for
tunate that the home I've created
here has been mostly a replication
of what I've had at home; my par
ents built a safe and loving world
for all aspects of who I am, and I've
looked for friends who would do
the same.
All of this is an amazing gift.
The person I am and the person I
am becoming are largely the same
here and at home. That is a privi
lege. I know that many students
must hide pieces of their identity,
or at least pride in pieces of their
identity, when and if they return
home. Political buttons come off
backpacks, new experiences go
unmentioned, entire portions of
their lives don't exist in the eyes of
their family.
For me, the quiet, happy colli
sion of Stanford and home life may
be challenged here, by publishing
on a single page of the Internet. It's
the kind of thing, like surveying
your pictures on Facebook before

others see them, that makes you
consider what you're willing to
share, and who you want to be to
the world. I've spent a great deal of
time considering; this column is
one big fat deliberate profile pic.
And yes, I am confident in an
identity here that I've tried to make
evident at home: I am dating a girl
and identify as gay or queer or any
word that means "not straight" just
as much. And while that is fortu
nately not earth-shattering news at
Stanford, I can't help but imagine
the scene of an old friend or team
mate spitting out their coffee should
they read this. "Gaaaayyyyyyy????"
Whether they really couldn't care
less or are so happy for me they
could just pee their pants which
is splendid I have to write from
one heart, as one person whose
important identities include "gay."
I have comical visions in which
some of my family recommends
journals in order to contain these
