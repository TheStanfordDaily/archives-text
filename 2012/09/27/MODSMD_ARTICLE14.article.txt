## Leave football for weekends 
### 
Thursday night lights? Not a good idea.
The switch in the football schedule
for this week's game against
Washington, from Saturday to Thursday
night, offers a glimpse at one of the unin
tended, though hardly unanticipated, con
sequences of the new Pac-12 and its
enthusiasm for a coordinated schedule of
televised football games.
It didn't always matter what day and
time other conference teams played their
games. If UCLA played Cal the same time
we played Washington, no big deal. Now,
suddenly, it matters.
It matters because, apparently, the new
Pac-12 Network wants to maximize its live
coverage of Pac-12 games by scheduling
them consecutively rather than concur
rently, such that, ideally, no two games
share the same day and time. If that's the
plan, it's going to put a lot of pressure on
teams to play at least some games during
the week.
No one can blame Stanford and other
schools for wanting to benefit financially
from televised games, even if it means
games made longer by tedious commercial

breaks. But weekday night games create
unnecessary and avoidable hardships for
both players and fans.
Yes, I know, a number of Stanford
teams need to schedule games and meets
during the week. But that's precisely the
point: Football, which requires at most
one game a week, doesn't need to do this.
There's no good reason no, television
revenues are not a good reason to dis
advantage football players. This week's
game at Washington, for example, will
force these student-athletes to miss at
least one (maybe two or three, depending
on travel plans) full day(s) of classes.
Weeknight games are bad for fans, too,
especially fans with academic commit
ments. And I'm not just referring to
Stanford students. I know one loyal
Cardinal fan who's not going to be attend
ing weeknight games: my daughter, a mid
dle school student.
She's been cheering from the stands, a
few rows behind the Stanford bench, since
she was four months old. She and my wife
and I arrive at least two hours before the
game, just in time for "The Walk." Then we
hang out at the Fan Fest until it's time to
watch the team warm up on the field. But
on a weeknight? I don't think so.
Stanford administrators and coaches
should make Stanford the special place we
always say it is a school that cherishes
athletic prowess but never at the expense of
academic excellence —by putting the

kibosh on weeknight football games.
Go Cardinal!
