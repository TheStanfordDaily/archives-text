# The
						Human Impact of Drones
## 
### 
Human life is infinitely precious. The
actions of the U.S. government with
respect to drone strikes, however, do
not reflect the values of a country that views
innocents as human beings worthy of digni
ty and respect. Drone attacks by the United
States have killed, at minimum, hundreds of
civilians in Pakistan, many of them women
and children. These attacks are conducted
in the most brutal form, incinerating bodies
and leaving unidentifiable pieces of flesh
for others to collect.
The incredible physical destruction,
psychological harm and loss of life caused
by drones, often to those who have no
stake in a fight against the United States, is
documented in a report released by
Stanford Law School's International
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution
Clinic, along with NYU Law School, the

product of months of legal research and
fieldwork in Pakistan. The attacks are par
ticularly disturbing because the U.S. gov
ernment has repeatedly downplayed the
number of civilians killed by drones. The
myth of exact, targeted attacks and mini
mal civilian casualties unfairly absolves
U.S. officials of culpability for significant
harm. Time and again, U.S. government
officials have refused to acknowledge civil
ian deaths until they are presented with
contrary evidence. In fact, John Brennan,
the president's chief counterterrorism
advisor, went as far as to say that "there
hasn't been a single collateral death"
between August 2010 and June 2011,
despite 10 separate attacks where at least
45 civilians were killed, including the high
ly publicized March 17, 2011, attack on a
jirga, a decision-making body assembled to
resolve disputes. A widely circulated inves
tigative piece in The New York Times in
May detailed how President Obama at
times personally decides when it is appro
priate to kill civilians.
Protecting civilians from errant (or pur
poseful) missiles, however, is not enough.
Our research revealed that the harm
extends far beyond those who are killed. In
addition to evidence of significant strategic
blowback, the U.S. administration must con
sider that its drone campaign has devastat
ed entire communities. Victims and witness-
