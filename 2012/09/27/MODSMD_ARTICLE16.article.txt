## Breaking down the Huskies 
### Sam Fisher 
USC is gone and now
Stanford hits the road
for the first time under
new starting quarter
back Josh Nunes.
How will the Cardinal respond?
Going on the road with a first-year
starting quarterback is never easy;
even Andrew Luck was only 3-3
away from Stanford in 2009 during
his redshirt freshman year. Tonight's
Washington game provides a key
first road test to gauge how good
Stanford really is. The following five
matchups will be the keys in decid
ing this crucial game.
Stanford's power running game
vs. Washington's front seven
The easiest thing Stanford can
do to take the pressure off Josh
Nunes is to attack Washington's
weakness with the Cardinal's main
strength, its running game.
Washington on the season has
allowed 4.5 yards per rush, and that
includes serious deflation from a
subpar Portland State attack.
To make matters worse, the
Huskies are severely undersized at
linebacker, an edge that Stanford
should be able to exploit with its
jumbo packages. Washington's four
linebackers average only 220
pounds, and though the Huskies'
linemen are, well, husky, at almost
280 pounds on average, Stanford
has the edge in the numbers game.
Look for Stanford to try to wear
down Washington's front seven and
start gaining 5+ yards per carry on
power by the fourth quarter.
Stanford secondary vs. Washington
tight end Austin Seferian- Jenkins
Austin Seferian-Jenkins, the
Huskies' star tight end, is made
straight from the Harbaugh mold.
Standing 6 foot 6 and 266 pounds,
Seferian-Jenkins presents serious
matchup issues against any defense,
and it's showed already in 2012.
Seferian-Jenkins has led Washington
in receiving yards in all three games
of the season thus far.
This is where the Stanford
defense's practice against Zach Ertz
and Levine Toilolo pays off.
Stanford has looked good against
touted tight ends so far in 2012,
including holding USC's tight-end
tandem to only 39 yards. Look for
physical play on Seferian-Jenkins
both up front and over the top to
keep the basketball star in check.
Josh Nunes vs. crowd noise
Huskies fans are known to be
rabid, making Husky Stadium a
perilous place to play every year.
This season, due to renovation,
Washington plays its home games
at Century Link Field, home of the
Seattle Seahawks, a stadium
designed to be as loud as possible.
Now give Husky fans a Thursday
night game against a Stanford team
that has dominated UW over the
past two seasons, and it's a recipe
for frenzy.
How will Josh Nunes respond in
his first road game as the starter?
He's had serious trouble getting
plays off in time in front of a quiet
road crowd, so there are very legiti
mate concerns with the crowd noise.
Nunes needs to buckle down and
focus like he did in the fourth quar
ter against USC all game long, or
Stanford's undefeated run could
come to a loud and unceremonious
end.
Stanford pass rush vs. Keith
Price's mobility
Stanford's pass rush has been
spectacular as of late, and with
Washington's injury-ravaged offen
sive line up next, it's hard to imag
ine the rush slowing down this
week. However, just generating
pressure won't be enough to bring
down Washington quarterback
Keith Price. Price moves much bet
ter than Matt Barkley, whom
Stanford abused two Saturday, and
that presents a very different chal
lenge.
The last time Stanford faced a
fairly mobile quarterback San
Jose State's David Fales the
defense struggled to bring the quar
terback to the ground. Fales did an
excellent job extending plays and
found open receivers after moving
both inside and outside the pocket.
If Stanford allows Price to do the
same, it could get ugly fast.
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo vs.
undersized Washington secondary
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo
were huge against USC, combin
ing for 118 yards including Zach
Ertz's game winning 37-yard
touchdown grab. For Stanford to
be successful, look for that to con
tinue against Washington's under-
sized secondary.
None of the Huskies' four
starters in the defensive
backfield are above 6 feet,
except when Washington
brings in star true freshman
nickelback Shaq Thompson,
who still stands only at 6 foot
2. Zach Ertz (6 foot 6) and
Levine Toilolo (6 foot 8) will
have a huge size advantage
no matter whom Washington
lines up against them.
If Stanford can get the
running game going at all,
Ertz and Toilolo should have
a field day deep on play
action, providing the offen
sive firepower needed to win
this game.

Sam Fisher has his own ritual
to prepare for the crowd at
Century Link, involving cym
bals, Adele and wasabi. If

subpar Portland State attack.
To make matters worse, the
Huskies are severely undersized at
linebacker, an edge that Stanford
should be able to exploit with its
jumbo packages. Washington's four
linebackers average only 220
pounds, and though the Huskies'
linemen are, well, husky, at almost
280 pounds on average, Stanford
has the edge in the numbers game.
Look for Stanford to try to wear
down Washington's front seven and
start gaining 5+ yards per carry on
power by the fourth quarter.
Stanford secondary vs. Washington
tight end Austin Seferian- Jenkins
Austin Seferian-Jenkins, the
Huskies' star tight end, is made
straight from the Harbaugh mold.
Standing 6 foot 6 and 266 pounds,
Seferian-Jenkins presents serious
matchup issues against any defense,
and it's showed already in 2012.
Seferian-Jenkins has led Washington
in receiving yards in all three games
of the season thus far.
This is where the Stanford
defense's practice against Zach Ertz
and Levine Toilolo pays off.
Stanford has looked good against
touted tight ends so far in 2012,
including holding USC's tight-end
tandem to only 39 yards. Look for
physical play on Seferian-Jenkins
both up front and over the top to
keep the basketball star in check.
Josh Nunes vs. crowd noise
Huskies fans are known to be
rabid, making Husky Stadium a
perilous place to play every year.
This season, due to renovation,
Washington plays its home games
at Century Link Field, home of the
Seattle Seahawks, a stadium
designed to be as loud as possible.
Now give Husky fans a Thursday
night game against a Stanford team
that has dominated UW over the
past two seasons, and it's a recipe
for frenzy.
How will Josh Nunes respond in
his first road game as the starter?
He's had serious trouble getting
plays off in time in front of a quiet
road crowd, so there are very legiti
mate concerns with the crowd noise.
Nunes needs to buckle down and
focus like he did in the fourth quar
ter against USC all game long, or
Stanford's undefeated run could
come to a loud and unceremonious
end.
Stanford pass rush vs. Keith
Price's mobility
Stanford's pass rush has been
spectacular as of late, and with
Washington's injury-ravaged offen
sive line up next, it's hard to imag
ine the rush slowing down this
week. However, just generating
pressure won't be enough to bring
down Washington quarterback
Keith Price. Price moves much bet
ter than Matt Barkley, whom
Stanford abused two Saturday, and
that presents a very different chal
lenge.
The last time Stanford faced a
fairly mobile quarterback San
Jose State's David Fales the
defense struggled to bring the quar
terback to the ground. Fales did an
excellent job extending plays and
found open receivers after moving
both inside and outside the pocket.
If Stanford allows Price to do the
same, it could get ugly fast.
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo vs.
undersized Washington secondary
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo
were huge against USC, combin
ing for 118 yards including Zach
Ertz's game winning 37-yard
touchdown grab. For Stanford to
be successful, look for that to con
tinue against Washington's under-
sized secondary.
None of the Huskies' four
starters in the defensive
backfield are above 6 feet,
except when Washington
brings in star true freshman
nickelback Shaq Thompson,
who still stands only at 6 foot
2. Zach Ertz (6 foot 6) and
Levine Toilolo (6 foot 8) will
have a huge size advantage
no matter whom Washington
lines up against them.
If Stanford can get the
running game going at all,
Ertz and Toilolo should have
a field day deep on play
action, providing the offen
sive firepower needed to win
this game.

USC is gone and now
Stanford hits the road
for the first time under
new starting quarter
back Josh Nunes.
How will the Cardinal respond?
Going on the road with a first-year
starting quarterback is never easy;
even Andrew Luck was only 3-3
away from Stanford in 2009 during
his redshirt freshman year. Tonight's
Washington game provides a key
first road test to gauge how good
Stanford really is. The following five
matchups will be the keys in decid
ing this crucial game.
Stanford's power running game
vs. Washington's front seven
The easiest thing Stanford can
do to take the pressure off Josh
Nunes is to attack Washington's
weakness with the Cardinal's main
strength, its running game.
Washington on the season has
allowed 4.5 yards per rush, and that
includes serious deflation from a
subpar Portland State attack.
To make matters worse, the
Huskies are severely undersized at
linebacker, an edge that Stanford
should be able to exploit with its
jumbo packages. Washington's four
linebackers average only 220
pounds, and though the Huskies'
linemen are, well, husky, at almost
280 pounds on average, Stanford
has the edge in the numbers game.
