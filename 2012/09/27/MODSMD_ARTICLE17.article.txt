# BEAVERS POSE MAJOR TEST
## STANFORD WELCOMES OREGON ST. 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer team will con
tinue its quest for a fourth-straight conference
crown tonight when it welcomes Oregon State
to campus in the second of a three-game home
stand; the final contest in the series will be
against Oregon on Sunday.
The No. 2 Cardinal (7-1-1) holds an 18-1 all
time lead against the No. 23 Beavers (9-1-0),

including a current eight-game streak since the
single loss in Corvallis, Ore., in 2003. The reign
ing national champion, Stanford has also gone
without a conference loss in over three years
and none of OSU's current players have ever
tasted victory over the Card.
However, besides Oregon State's narrowly
better record so far this season, the Beavers will
represent the toughest test for the Card since

All-Pac-12 selection will be a big key as the No. 2 Card welcomes No. 23 Oregon State.
