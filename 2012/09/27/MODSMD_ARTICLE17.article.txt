# BEAVERS POSE MAJOR TEST
## STANFORD WELCOMES OREGON ST. 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer team will con
tinue its quest for a fourth-straight conference
crown tonight when it welcomes Oregon State
to campus in the second of a three-game home
stand; the final contest in the series will be
against Oregon on Sunday.
The No. 2 Cardinal (7-1-1) holds an 18-1 all
time lead against the No. 23 Beavers (9-1-0),

including a current eight-game streak since the
single loss in Corvallis, Ore., in 2003. The reign
ing national champion, Stanford has also gone
without a conference loss in over three years
and none of OSU's current players have ever
tasted victory over the Card.
However, besides Oregon State's narrowly
better record so far this season, the Beavers will
represent the toughest test for the Card since

Senior tri-captain Mariah Nogueira is second on the team in goals with four, and the three-time
All-Pac-12 selection will be a big key as the No. 2 Card welcomes No. 23 Oregon State.
Boston College held it to a
1-1 tie on the Farm at the
end of August. OSU arrives
on a streak of five wins and
the best start in the pro
gram's history.
The Beavers' opened
their Pac-12 campaign last
weekend by defeating Utah
2-0 in Corvallis. Junior for
ward Jenna Richardson
starred on offense, recording
all five of OSU's shots on
goal and scoring both goals,
one in the first half, one in
the second. In defense, fresh
man goalkeeper Sammy Jo
Prudhomme recorded her
third shutout out of just four
games played. Though Utah
actually outshot Oregon
State 16-13, Prudhomme
kept her team ahead with
nine crucial saves.
For their efforts, Oregon
State's pair swept last
week's Pac-12 honors,
Richardson taking home
Player of the Week and
Prudhomme earning
Defensive Player of the
Week honors.
Stanford, meanwhile,
struggled in the first half of
its opening Pac-12 game
against Arizona State on

Sunday. The Sun Devils
played a physical game that
stifled their opposition and
came close to taking the
lead just before the break,
but the Cardinal survived.
After the difficult start
Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe made several
changes for the second
period, including giving last
season's regular goalkeeper
junior Emily Oliver her
first minutes this year after
recovering from injury. His
tactics worked and the
Card returned rejuvenated
after halftime to eventually
win comfortably 3-0.
The fact that Sunday's
goals came from three dif
ferent players, junior for
ward Natalie Griffen, red
shirt junior forward
Courtney Verloo and junior
forward Taylor McCann high
lights one of the key differ
ences between last season
and this one. The last time
these two teams met on Oct.
28 last year Stanford's for
ward Lindsay Taylor 'l2
overturned an early OSU
lead with two goals that
won the contest 2-1 and
clinched the Pac-12 title.
Taylor was last season's
top scorer, with 20 goals,
but her graduation leaves
no clear goal-scoring leader
in the team. Currently
Griffen is in the lead with

five goals, ahead of junior
forward Sydney Payne and
senior midfielder Mariah
Nogueira, who each have
four.
If the goals keep com
ing, then perhaps Ratcliffe
will not need to find a clear
goal scorer and can settle
for scoring by committee; in
the last five games Stanford
has netted 15 unanswered
goals from eight different
players.
There is, however, much
work to be done if the Card
wants to again lift both the
Pac-12 and national cham
pionship trophies. Several
key players have recently
returned to the squad, includ
ing Oliver from injury and
sophomore forward
Chioma Ãœbogagu from
national duties for the win
ning U.S. team at the 2012
FIFA U-20 Women's World
Cup. While they will
strengthen Ratcliffe's hand,
perhaps last Sunday's first
half shows that the team
has not yet clicked back
into the well-oiled machine
that went undefeated
throughout last season.
The contest between
Stanford and Oregon State
will kick off at 6 p.m. at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
