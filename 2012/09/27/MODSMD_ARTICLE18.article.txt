# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Card sets sights on Arizona 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
To say that the Stanford women's vol
leyball team has turned it on over the last
few weeks would be a gross understate
ment. The Card has taken the Pac-12,
along with the entire nation, by storm,
recording seven straight wins in dominat
ing fashion. Following a loss to Jiangsu (a
club from China), Stanford has pressed
down on the accelerator in a major way,
outscoring their opponents by a total of
21 sets to 3.
Much of this recent success has
resulted from the play of the new fresh
men, led by setter Madi Bugg and out
side hitter Jordan Burgess. The Card (10-
2, 2-0 Pac-12) will look to build on its
success this weekend as it takes on the
Arizona Wildcats (9-4, 1-1 Pac-12) and
Arizona State Sun Devils (12-3,1-1 Pac
-12) in a pair of important conference
matches.
First up for Stanford is the squad from
Tucson, a talented group that had won
five straight matches before being
upended by Washington on Saturday
night. The Wildcats are one of the only
teams in the Pac-12 that can boast having
a comparably young lineup to the
Cardinal, as they feature a team loaded
with sophomores and freshmen.
At the head is a pair of sophomore
outside hitters Madi Kingdon and Taylor
Arizobal.The duo is a formidable combi
nation at the net, and will be a lot to han
dle for the Stanford defense. Kingdon is
currently first on the team with 201 kills
(.254 hitting percentage), to go along
with 125 digs. Arizobal is not far behind,
as she has put away 150 kills (.223) of her
own. The two sophomores have wreaked
havoc on their opponents early in the
season, and Stanford will have to prevent
this if they wish to pick up another con
ference win.
However, junior Chanel Brown
anchors the Wildcat offense. As one of
the oldest players on a young team, she
acts as the glue holding everything
together, as evidenced by her team-lead
ing 428 assists (9.51 per set). If Arizona
wants to pull off an upset, Brown will
have to put on one of her best perform
ances of the year.
Next up Stanford travels to Tempe to
take on Arizona State. The Sun Devils
have impressed this year and are coming
off of a solid victory against Washington
State. Much of this success can be attrib
uted to freshman outside hitter Macey
Gardner. The newcomer has rivaled
