# WoPo on SoCal swing
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The men's water polo team did not win the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
or NCAA championships last year, but this
weekend at the SoCal Tournament Stanford
is in a position to defend the one title it did
pick up in 2011.
The SoCal Tournament will feature essen
tially the same lineup of schools as the
NorCal Invitational, which Stanford placed
third in two weekends ago. That lineup

includes every top-10 team in the country, and
if No. 4 Stanford (3-1) is to repeat its title, it
will potentially have to get through No. 6 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 2 UCLA and No.l USC.
At last week's NorCal Invitational
Stanford went 3-1, defeating Santa Clara eas
ily before squeaking by UC-Santa Barbara on
the first day. That set up a semifinal clash with
defending national champion USC, to which
the Cardinal lost 10-9 in overtime. Stanford
bounced back to win the third-place game 9-8
over California.
Stanford was led offensively by its core of

young players, who impressed not only with
the number of goals they contributed but also
because they scored in several crucial situa
tions. That group includes last year's leading
scorer, sophomore Alex Bowen, who believes
this team is already a lot better than it was
two weeks ago.
"Our offense will keep getting better,"
Bowen said. "We have a lot of good shooters
who will continue to get better and learn how
to play at a higher level."

A second-team All-American last season, redshirt junior Forrest Watkins (10) will be right at home this weekend as the men's water polo team
heads to Southern California for the SoCal Tournament. The Seal Beach, Calif., native Watkins had 42 goals last year as the 2-meter.
This could be a scary propo
sition for opponents, since
true freshman driver Bret
Bonanni has already proven
he can score en masse
against top opponents. He
netted 10 goals last week
end, just one shy of Bowen's
team-leading 11 tallies.
While the most impres
sive thing about this team is
its offensive potential, play
ers know that their defense
will determine their success
against the elite teams.
"The key is defense; we
need to work on our commu
nication, shutting down
major threats and 2-meters,"
Bowen said.
The most notable gaffes
in the defense last weekend
happened at the 2-meter
position. Especially against
USC, a few scrums near the
cage led to easy Trojan
scores. Stanford will be lean
ing on redshirt junior 2-
meter Forrest Watkins to
shut down opposing center
players, but senior Andrew
LaForge and sophomore

Nick Hoversten will take
their turns guarding at 2-
meters as well.
Stanford moved up one
spot from No. 4 to No. 3 in
the national rankings after
the NorCal Tournament. The
rankings for the remainder
of the top six teams also mir
rored their finishes at the
tournament.
Because Cal dropped to
No. 4, Stanford is now in line
to face UCLA (12-1) in the
semifinals at the SoCal
Invitational if both teams
win their early round games.
That would be the first
meeting of the season
between the two teams, and
it would give Stanford a
chance to compete against
each of the top four MPSF
teams before the start of
conference play.
That matchup would like
ly be a close one, as UCLA's
performance at the NorCal
Tournament was essentially
the same as Stanford's. The
Bruins defeated Cal in over
time by one goal in the semi
final, and then lost to USC
by one goal in the champi
onship game.
This weekend will also be
a chance for Stanford's fresh
men to prove they can cope
with any adjustments that

opponents make to them.
Bonanni and fellow fresh
man driver BJ Churnside
played very well in their first
collegiate games last week
end, but it also gave teams a
chance to scout the new
players.
It will be important for
Bonanni and Churnside to
deal with any defensive
adjustments because they
will face the likes of USC
and Cal multiple times this
season if they make a run at
the national title.
Stanford is hoping that
the first rematch with the
Trojans or the Bears is this
Sunday afternoon in the
championship of the SoCal
tournament. The tournament
is hosted at UC-Santa
Barbara, and each team will
play four games, two on
Saturday and two on Sunday,
regardless of the results.
Stanford's first game is
at 10:40 a.m. against
Princeton. Their opponents
for the rest of the weekend
will depend on other
results. Stanford's last
meeting with Princeton was
a 14-3 victory last year in
this very same tournament.

A second-team All-American last season, redshirt junior Forrest Watkins (10) will be right at home this weekend as the men's water polo team
heads to Southern California for the SoCal Tournament. The Seal Beach, Calif., native Watkins had 42 goals last year as the 2-meter.
This could be a scary propo
sition for opponents, since
true freshman driver Bret
Bonanni has already proven
he can score en masse
against top opponents. He
netted 10 goals last week
end, just one shy of Bowen's
team-leading 11 tallies.
While the most impres
sive thing about this team is
its offensive potential, play
ers know that their defense
will determine their success
against the elite teams.
"The key is defense; we
need to work on our commu
nication, shutting down
major threats and 2-meters,"
Bowen said.
The most notable gaffes
in the defense last weekend
happened at the 2-meter
position. Especially against
USC, a few scrums near the
cage led to easy Trojan
scores. Stanford will be lean
ing on redshirt junior 2-
meter Forrest Watkins to
shut down opposing center
players, but senior Andrew
LaForge and sophomore

Nick Hoversten will take
their turns guarding at 2-
meters as well.
Stanford moved up one
spot from No. 4 to No. 3 in
the national rankings after
the NorCal Tournament. The
rankings for the remainder
of the top six teams also mir
rored their finishes at the
tournament.
Because Cal dropped to
No. 4, Stanford is now in line
to face UCLA (12-1) in the
semifinals at the SoCal
Invitational if both teams
win their early round games.
That would be the first
meeting of the season
between the two teams, and
it would give Stanford a
chance to compete against
each of the top four MPSF
teams before the start of
conference play.
That matchup would like
ly be a close one, as UCLA's
performance at the NorCal
Tournament was essentially
the same as Stanford's. The
Bruins defeated Cal in over
time by one goal in the semi
final, and then lost to USC
by one goal in the champi
onship game.
This weekend will also be
a chance for Stanford's fresh
men to prove they can cope
with any adjustments that

opponents make to them.
Bonanni and fellow fresh
man driver BJ Churnside
played very well in their first
collegiate games last week
end, but it also gave teams a
chance to scout the new
players.
It will be important for
Bonanni and Churnside to
deal with any defensive
adjustments because they
will face the likes of USC
and Cal multiple times this
season if they make a run at
the national title.
Stanford is hoping that
the first rematch with the
Trojans or the Bears is this
Sunday afternoon in the
championship of the SoCal
tournament. The tournament
is hosted at UC-Santa
Barbara, and each team will
play four games, two on
Saturday and two on Sunday,
regardless of the results.
Stanford's first game is
at 10:40 a.m. against
Princeton. Their opponents
for the rest of the weekend
will depend on other
results. Stanford's last
meeting with Princeton was
a 14-3 victory last year in
this very same tournament.

The men's water polo team did not win the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
or NCAA championships last year, but this
weekend at the SoCal Tournament Stanford
is in a position to defend the one title it did
pick up in 2011.
The SoCal Tournament will feature essen
tially the same lineup of schools as the
NorCal Invitational, which Stanford placed
third in two weekends ago. That lineup

includes every top-10 team in the country, and
if No. 4 Stanford (3-1) is to repeat its title, it
will potentially have to get through No. 6 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 2 UCLA and No.l USC.
At last week's NorCal Invitational
Stanford went 3-1, defeating Santa Clara eas
ily before squeaking by UC-Santa Barbara on
the first day. That set up a semifinal clash with
defending national champion USC, to which
the Cardinal lost 10-9 in overtime. Stanford
bounced back to win the third-place game 9-8
over California.
Stanford was led offensively by its core of

young players, who impressed not only with
the number of goals they contributed but also
because they scored in several crucial situa
tions. That group includes last year's leading
scorer, sophomore Alex Bowen, who believes
this team is already a lot better than it was
two weeks ago.
"Our offense will keep getting better,"
Bowen said. "We have a lot of good shooters
who will continue to get better and learn how
to play at a higher level."
