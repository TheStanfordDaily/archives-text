# WoPo on SoCal swing

### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The men's water polo team did not win the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
or NCAA championships last year, but this
weekend at the SoCal Tournament Stanford
is in a position to defend the one title it did
pick up in 2011.
The SoCal Tournament will feature essen
tially the same lineup of schools as the
NorCal Invitational, which Stanford placed
third in two weekends ago. That lineup

includes every top-10 team in the country, and
if No. 4 Stanford (3-1) is to repeat its title, it
will potentially have to get through No. 6 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 2 UCLA and No.l USC.
At last week's NorCal Invitational
Stanford went 3-1, defeating Santa Clara eas
ily before squeaking by UC-Santa Barbara on
the first day. That set up a semifinal clash with
defending national champion USC, to which
the Cardinal lost 10-9 in overtime. Stanford
bounced back to win the third-place game 9-8
over California.
Stanford was led offensively by its core of

young players, who impressed not only with
the number of goals they contributed but also
because they scored in several crucial situa
tions. That group includes last year's leading
scorer, sophomore Alex Bowen, who believes
this team is already a lot better than it was
two weeks ago.
"Our offense will keep getting better,"
Bowen said. "We have a lot of good shooters
who will continue to get better and learn how
to play at a higher level."

A second-team All-American last season, redshirt junior Forrest Watkins (10) will be right at home this weekend as the men's water polo team
heads to Southern California for the SoCal Tournament. The Seal Beach, Calif., native Watkins had 42 goals last year as the 2-meter.
