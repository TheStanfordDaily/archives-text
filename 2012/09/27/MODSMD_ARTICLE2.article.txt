## OAPE hosts alcohol talks in dorms Program aims to speak with every freshman dorm by week three 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
The Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE) will host an alcohol edu
cation outreach talk in all freshman dorms
by the end of the third week of fall quarter.
ITie presentations, intended to inform new
students about healthy drinking habits, will
emphasize the dangers of hard alcohol
abuse.
"Nearly every student who went to the
emergency room due to alcohol poisoning
last year drank too many shots of hard alco
hol," wrote Sam Saenz, OAPE outreach and
internship coordinator, in an email to The
Daily.
Saenz, along with Outreach Education
Coordinator Jarreau Bowen, will be present
ing at freshman dorm meetings. Saenz,
Bowen, OAPE and resident fellows (RFs)
are hosting these presentations to support
residential staff and students.
"Our primary role is really similar to
years past: to support the student staff in
their assessment and direct support role with
residents," said Geoff Baker, Larkin RF, who
hosted an alcohol education outreach talk on
Monday. "Our secondary role is to engage, as
equals, staff members in the norming expec
tations that keep residential education on
the minds of those involved in it."
In an email sent to all RFs, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Ralph Castro
emphasized the role of RFs in setting the
tone for the year.
"This is your opportunity to set norms for
your community," he wrote. "Students appre
ciate having their RFs do this early in the
year and it has very positive effects on the
drinking trajectory for your community."
According to Baker, the conversation has
already been held in many freshman dorms.
"We've had, in our first house meeting,
exactly that [conversation]," he said.
"Alcohol education... has to be spiraled,
engaged in different ways over time. It starts
with the first house meeting and
continues with events [through
out the year]."
Castro also told RFs that "the
University is strongly trying to
prevent students from engaging
in high-risk drinking behaviors."
Saenz spoke about the impor
tance of the culture of drinking at
Stanford.
"We first need to support a
culture where drinking is not the
only way to have fun," he said.
"We also need to encourage stu
dents who do drink to stay classy
drinking within the limits and
within the social zone through
our education efforts."
Saenz is optimistic that these

alcohol education outreach presen
tations are making a positive impact
on freshman drinking habits.
"Freshmen appear to respond
positively and learn something
useful through our outreach," he
said. "Post-outreach surveys from
last year show that 87.2 percent of
attendees agree that [the out
reach presentation] was engaging
[and] 82.1 percent of respondents
learned something new."
One such resident was
Matthew Callahan 'l6.
"I thought [the presentation]
did a good job showing why spac
ing out drinks or drinking beer is
better than downing multiple
shots," Callahan, a Larkin resi
dent, said "I think [Stanford has]
a good policy, having the open
door and not clamping down."
