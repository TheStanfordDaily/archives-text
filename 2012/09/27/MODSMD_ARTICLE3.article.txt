## Law School to use backup funds for aid Defecit forces use of unrestricted funds to vied aid obligations 
### JAMIE KIM 
For the first time ever, Stanford Law School
will reach into its unrestricted funds to cover
students' need-based financial aid. Lower
endowment returns and an increase in the
number of students qualifying for financial aid
has caused the school "to wipe out" the finan
cial aid funds for this academic year, according
to the University's 2012-13 budget plan.
Judith Romero, a spokesperson for the law
school, wrote in an email to The Daily that this
deficit is not "an unmanageable issue," citing a
plan designed by the law school that aims to
close the budgetary gap in three years.
Rather than altering the financial aid poli
cies, Romero said the law school will be "using
our financial reserves, raising money and asking
the University for assistance (which it gener
ously provided)."
The centerpiece of the plan will be a $2O mil
lion fundraising campaign. Romero said the
money raised would "enable the law school to
endow future financial aid needs." Once invest
ed, the target figure is expected to produce
more than $1 million in endowment returns
each year.
Poor economic conditions have caused
more students to quality financial aid in recent
years, Romero said.
According to this year's budget, "in the past
several years without any change in school
policies for awarding aid the number of stu
dents with need great enough to qualify them
for a scholarship rose from 50 percent to 60 per-
cent, while the average award
increased by 20 percent."
Adding to the problem, endow
ment payouts dropped by 25 per
cent during the same period, caus
ing "a loss of nearly $2 million of
financial aid income."
In response, the law school
decided to dip into its unrestricted
funds, and the University provided a
one-time injection of funds. These
moves have allowed the law school
to continue offering the same level
of aid to students.
Romero called the school's
financial aid program "the most
generous" in the nation. In the 2011 -
12 academic year, Stanford Law
School offered an average financial
aid award of $25,000, and students
had an average debt burden of
$109,000 at graduation.
"We are very grateful to the
University and are glad to report
that the gap is closing and our plan
is on track," Romero said.
