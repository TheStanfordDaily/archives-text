# NO. 8 STANFORD (3-0,1-0 PAC-12) AT WASHINGTON (2-1, 0-0 PAC-12)

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 21, WASHINGTON 10: Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, it's no picnic to play at Century Link. I expect
Josh Nunes misses several passes early on and David Shaw
plays conservatively in the first half. Stepfan Taylor should
pose big problems for the Huskies, even without the threat of
the pass, and as Nunes gets more comfortable and Stanford's
pass rush wreaks havoc in the backfield, the stronger team
prevails. Stanford gets a chance to impress voters even if the
offense doesn't score a ton of points.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 34, WASHINGTON 17: Tonight's game
has all of the typical characteristics of a trap game for Stanford.
The Card is coming off one of the biggest wins in program his
tory, has to travel to the loudest stadium in the country with a
first-year starting quarterback, and has to deal with the stress
es of classes beginning. Washington is hungry to get back at
Stanford after being embarrassed by the Card over the past
three seasons. UW is marketing this game as the "Blackout of
the Century" on its website. But at the end of the day,
Washington's offensive line is too beaten up to finish the job.
Four of the five Huskies projected to start at offensive line this
season are out for tonight's ballgame. You cannot beat the
Stanford Cardinal with four backup offensive linemen. It just
doesn't happen. Stanford's defense dominates up front again,
and the Card pulls away in the second half to win 34-17.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, WASHINGTON 27: Despite playing
behind a vulnerable offensive line, Washington quarterback
Keith Price will find away to convert third downs and put up
points on the scoreboard with his feet early in the game. But
the Cardinal defense will clamp down in the second half once
again as Nunes and company methodically and efficiently
move the ball downfield. If Washington tries to load the box to
stop Stepfan Taylor, look for Nunes trying to dish it out to
Taylor on screens and connect with tight ends Zach Ertz and
Levine Toilolo on longer passes. With national television cov
erage on ESPN and an electric Huskies crowd at Century Link
Field, this will be one tough road test for Stanford. Still, the
Cardinal should come out with the win.
