## No. 8 Cardinal hits road for key matchup with Washington on ESPN 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Bye weeks can be tricky
things. The break in the
action allows banged-up
bodies to heal, but it can
also lull players into taking
their feet off the pedal.
That's exactly why head coach
David Shaw stressed the importance
of his players not resting on their lau
rels during the past bye week.
Despite coming off an incredible 21-
14 victory over USC, the Cardinal
will face a different kind of animal
tonight: its first road test of the season
at Century Link Field, a 67,000-seat
stadium that is one of the loudest in
the nation.
"You can't linger," Shaw said. "If
you want to be good at something,
you have to concentrate on the work.
You can't concentrate on the achieve
ments and you can't concentrate on
the pats on the back."
Tonight, No. 8 Stanford (3-0, 1-0
Pac-12) will try to advance to 4-0 for
the third straight season as it takes on
Washington (2-1, 0-0) in a Pac-12
North matchup.
When the two teams met last year,
Stanford's running game, command
ed by Andrew Luck's masterful play
calling at the line of scrimmage,
gashed the Huskies' defense for 446
yards on the ground, averaged 10.1
yards per carry and broke the single
game school rushing record in the
process. However, Shaw and the play
ers are expecting a much tougher
resistance this time around.
"We don't anticipate that happen
ing again," Shaw said. "We expect
more of a balanced attack from us...
[Washington] changed their scheme
on defense. They're physical and they
have good size."
Senior halfback Stepfan Taylor
named Walter Camp National
Offensive Player of the Week for his

remarkable 213 all-purpose yard,
two-touchdown performance against
the Trojan looks once again to be
the reliable engine of the Cardinal
offense. But the speedy junior
Anthony Wilkerson, who has seen a
considerable amount of action so -far
this season in the Wildcat formation,
will sit out tonight due to a lower-leg
injury.
Despite combining for just 24
yards on nine carries so far this year,
running backs Remound Wright and
Ricky Seale have earned Shaw's vote
of confidence as they attempt to
effectively fill in for the injured
Wilkerson.
"We only recruit complete backs,"
Shaw said. "And [Wright and Seale]
are complete backs They're very
good at pass protection and they can
catch the ball. For those guys, it's just
about opportunities."
Washington may have given up
247 yards to SEC powerhouse LSU
in game two, but the Huskies* defense
isn't short on talented playmakers.
Among them is linebacker John
Timu, an up-and-coming sophomore
who has recorded 18 tackles on the
season and resembles Stanford's sen
ior Shayne Skov with his vocal lead
ership.
"Their defense is everywhere on
the field," Taylor said. "We have to be
ready and be able to identify their
guys so that we're all on the same
page. Their defense's layout is kind of
like our defense how they move
around in a lot of places and try to
confuse you whether it's three-down
or four-down."
Earlier this week Shaw said that
the team needs to find away to
incorporate the wide receivers
more into the offense. While senior
Drew Terrell and sophomore Ty
Montgomery have shone occasional
ly, the two wideouts have combined
