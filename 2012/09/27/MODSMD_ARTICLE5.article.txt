## No. 8 Cardinal hits road for key matchup with Washington on ESPN 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Bye weeks can be tricky
things. The break in the
action allows banged-up
bodies to heal, but it can
also lull players into taking
their feet off the pedal.
That's exactly why head coach
David Shaw stressed the importance
of his players not resting on their lau
rels during the past bye week.
Despite coming off an incredible 21-
14 victory over USC, the Cardinal
will face a different kind of animal
tonight: its first road test of the season
at Century Link Field, a 67,000-seat
stadium that is one of the loudest in
the nation.
"You can't linger," Shaw said. "If
you want to be good at something,
you have to concentrate on the work.
You can't concentrate on the achieve
ments and you can't concentrate on
the pats on the back."
Tonight, No. 8 Stanford (3-0, 1-0
Pac-12) will try to advance to 4-0 for
the third straight season as it takes on
Washington (2-1, 0-0) in a Pac-12
North matchup.
When the two teams met last year,
Stanford's running game, command
ed by Andrew Luck's masterful play
calling at the line of scrimmage,
gashed the Huskies' defense for 446
yards on the ground, averaged 10.1
yards per carry and broke the single
game school rushing record in the
process. However, Shaw and the play
ers are expecting a much tougher
resistance this time around.
"We don't anticipate that happen
ing again," Shaw said. "We expect
more of a balanced attack from us...
[Washington] changed their scheme
on defense. They're physical and they
have good size."
Senior halfback Stepfan Taylor
named Walter Camp National
Offensive Player of the Week for his

remarkable 213 all-purpose yard,
two-touchdown performance against
the Trojan looks once again to be
the reliable engine of the Cardinal
offense. But the speedy junior
Anthony Wilkerson, who has seen a
considerable amount of action so -far
this season in the Wildcat formation,
will sit out tonight due to a lower-leg
injury.
Despite combining for just 24
yards on nine carries so far this year,
running backs Remound Wright and
Ricky Seale have earned Shaw's vote
of confidence as they attempt to
effectively fill in for the injured
Wilkerson.
"We only recruit complete backs,"
Shaw said. "And [Wright and Seale]
are complete backs They're very
good at pass protection and they can
catch the ball. For those guys, it's just
about opportunities."
Washington may have given up
247 yards to SEC powerhouse LSU
in game two, but the Huskies* defense
isn't short on talented playmakers.
Among them is linebacker John
Timu, an up-and-coming sophomore
who has recorded 18 tackles on the
season and resembles Stanford's sen
ior Shayne Skov with his vocal lead
ership.
"Their defense is everywhere on
the field," Taylor said. "We have to be
ready and be able to identify their
guys so that we're all on the same
page. Their defense's layout is kind of
like our defense how they move
around in a lot of places and try to
confuse you whether it's three-down
or four-down."
Earlier this week Shaw said that
the team needs to find away to
incorporate the wide receivers
more into the offense. While senior
Drew Terrell and sophomore Ty
Montgomery have shone occasional
ly, the two wideouts have combined

for only 16 receptions and 185
receiving yards over the span of
three games. It won't get any easier
tonight for Stanford's top two wide
receivers as they contend with
Washington's Desmond Trufant,
one of the premier cornerbacks in
the conference.
The Cardinal can't afford to
leave any points on the field
especially not on the road
which means that sophomore
placekicker Jordan Williamson
must nail field goals when he's
called upon. After making five of
six attempts in the first two games,
Williamson came up empty-handed
on all three tries against USC.
"The field goal is all about tim
ing and technique," Shaw said.
"When he's on, he's as good as any
body in the country. When he's not,
then he's not. He knows that. It's all
about consistency.... He's coming
off a great week of practice. We've
just got to make sure it transfers to
the game."
Mobile quarterbacks who can
throw accurately on the run have

often been a thorn in Stanford's
side. Huskies quarterback Keith
Price threatens to become the latest
containment problem for the
Cardinal defense; his ability to
maneuver himself out of the pocket
presents a tall order for even one of
the nation's top front sevens.
Although Price has gotten off to
a sluggish start so far, his impressive
statistics last season 3,063 pass
ing yards along with 33 touchdowns
are indicative of his skills.
"The big thing is the defensive
backs realizing that the average
play is five or six seconds, but with
this guy it might be seven or eight,"
Shaw said. "He's the X factor, and
when a quarterback can make the
defensive backs cover for three
more seconds, that's tough."
Although the Huskies no longer
have dangerous tailback Chris
Polk, Price certainly won't be alone
in the offensive attack as he'll try to
find his dependable target, sopho
more wideout Kasen Williams,
throughout the game.
The stingy Cardinal front seven,
which has allowed only 41 rushing
yards per game, hopes to shut down
Washington's ground game and
bring the same fierce pass rush that
it bombarded Matt Barkley with
two weekends ago. Developing at a

quick pace, the young, but disci
plined Stanford secondary has also
gained a tremendous amount of
confidence after being able to keep
Marqise Lee and Robert Woods,
two of the best wideouts in college
football, in check.
"With the front seven that we
have, we know we have to uphold
our end of the bargain as a
defense," said junior strong safety
Jordan Richards.
With classes underway, Shaw
has stressed the importance of time
management to his players.
"Bottom line, when it's time for
academics, there should be nothing
else in the world that matters,"
Shaw said. "And when it's time for
football, there should be nothing
else in the world that matters."
Fresh off a momentous upset
over the Trojans, Stanford's first road
game against the Huskies has the
makings of a trap game written all
over it. Yet the players have shown
so far that they are well-versed in
responding to adversity, an impor
tant theme that Shaw emphasized
before the season began.
"We talked about [playing on
the road] being our next step,"
Shaw said. "Can we show the matu
rity necessary to play well on the
road taking care of the ball, han

dling the noise, realizing there's
going to be a lot of emotions lead
ing up to this game, limiting our
penalties? Can we still play smart
and play our style of football?
That's our test."
Stanford and Washington will

square off tonight at Century Link
Field in Seattle, Wash. Kickoff time
is slated for 6 p.m., with national tel
evision coverage on ESPN.

Against Washington, Stanford will rely on its pass rush to pressure quarterback Keith Price. But when Price airs it out, the Cardinal will need its
defensive backs, including junior Jordan Richards (8), to step up.
Bye weeks can be tricky
things. The break in the
action allows banged-up
bodies to heal, but it can
also lull players into taking
their feet off the pedal.
That's exactly why head coach
David Shaw stressed the importance
of his players not resting on their lau
rels during the past bye week.
Despite coming off an incredible 21-
14 victory over USC, the Cardinal
will face a different kind of animal
tonight: its first road test of the season
at Century Link Field, a 67,000-seat
stadium that is one of the loudest in
the nation.
"You can't linger," Shaw said. "If
you want to be good at something,
you have to concentrate on the work.
You can't concentrate on the achieve
ments and you can't concentrate on
the pats on the back."
Tonight, No. 8 Stanford (3-0, 1-0
Pac-12) will try to advance to 4-0 for
the third straight season as it takes on
Washington (2-1, 0-0) in a Pac-12
North matchup.
When the two teams met last year,
Stanford's running game, command
ed by Andrew Luck's masterful play
calling at the line of scrimmage,
gashed the Huskies' defense for 446
yards on the ground, averaged 10.1
yards per carry and broke the single
game school rushing record in the
process. However, Shaw and the play
ers are expecting a much tougher
resistance this time around.
"We don't anticipate that happen
ing again," Shaw said. "We expect
more of a balanced attack from us...
[Washington] changed their scheme
on defense. They're physical and they
have good size."
Senior halfback Stepfan Taylor
named Walter Camp National
Offensive Player of the Week for his

remarkable 213 all-purpose yard,
two-touchdown performance against
the Trojan looks once again to be
the reliable engine of the Cardinal
offense. But the speedy junior
Anthony Wilkerson, who has seen a
considerable amount of action so -far
this season in the Wildcat formation,
will sit out tonight due to a lower-leg
injury.
Despite combining for just 24
yards on nine carries so far this year,
running backs Remound Wright and
Ricky Seale have earned Shaw's vote
of confidence as they attempt to
effectively fill in for the injured
Wilkerson.
"We only recruit complete backs,"
Shaw said. "And [Wright and Seale]
are complete backs They're very
good at pass protection and they can
catch the ball. For those guys, it's just
about opportunities."
Washington may have given up
247 yards to SEC powerhouse LSU
in game two, but the Huskies* defense
isn't short on talented playmakers.
Among them is linebacker John
Timu, an up-and-coming sophomore
who has recorded 18 tackles on the
season and resembles Stanford's sen
ior Shayne Skov with his vocal lead
ership.
"Their defense is everywhere on
the field," Taylor said. "We have to be
ready and be able to identify their
guys so that we're all on the same
page. Their defense's layout is kind of
like our defense how they move
around in a lot of places and try to
confuse you whether it's three-down
or four-down."
Earlier this week Shaw said that
the team needs to find away to
incorporate the wide receivers
more into the offense. While senior
Drew Terrell and sophomore Ty
Montgomery have shone occasional
ly, the two wideouts have combined

for only 16 receptions and 185
receiving yards over the span of
three games. It won't get any easier
tonight for Stanford's top two wide
receivers as they contend with
Washington's Desmond Trufant,
one of the premier cornerbacks in
the conference.
The Cardinal can't afford to
leave any points on the field
especially not on the road
which means that sophomore
placekicker Jordan Williamson
must nail field goals when he's
called upon. After making five of
six attempts in the first two games,
Williamson came up empty-handed
on all three tries against USC.
"The field goal is all about tim
ing and technique," Shaw said.
"When he's on, he's as good as any
body in the country. When he's not,
then he's not. He knows that. It's all
about consistency.... He's coming
off a great week of practice. We've
just got to make sure it transfers to
the game."
Mobile quarterbacks who can
throw accurately on the run have

often been a thorn in Stanford's
side. Huskies quarterback Keith
Price threatens to become the latest
containment problem for the
Cardinal defense; his ability to
maneuver himself out of the pocket
presents a tall order for even one of
the nation's top front sevens.
Although Price has gotten off to
a sluggish start so far, his impressive
statistics last season 3,063 pass
ing yards along with 33 touchdowns
are indicative of his skills.
"The big thing is the defensive
backs realizing that the average
play is five or six seconds, but with
this guy it might be seven or eight,"
Shaw said. "He's the X factor, and
when a quarterback can make the
defensive backs cover for three
more seconds, that's tough."
Although the Huskies no longer
have dangerous tailback Chris
Polk, Price certainly won't be alone
in the offensive attack as he'll try to
find his dependable target, sopho
more wideout Kasen Williams,
throughout the game.
The stingy Cardinal front seven,
which has allowed only 41 rushing
yards per game, hopes to shut down
Washington's ground game and
bring the same fierce pass rush that
it bombarded Matt Barkley with
two weekends ago. Developing at a

quick pace, the young, but disci
plined Stanford secondary has also
gained a tremendous amount of
confidence after being able to keep
Marqise Lee and Robert Woods,
two of the best wideouts in college
football, in check.
"With the front seven that we
have, we know we have to uphold
our end of the bargain as a
defense," said junior strong safety
Jordan Richards.
With classes underway, Shaw
has stressed the importance of time
management to his players.
"Bottom line, when it's time for
academics, there should be nothing
else in the world that matters,"
Shaw said. "And when it's time for
football, there should be nothing
else in the world that matters."
Fresh off a momentous upset
over the Trojans, Stanford's first road
game against the Huskies has the
makings of a trap game written all
over it. Yet the players have shown
so far that they are well-versed in
responding to adversity, an impor
tant theme that Shaw emphasized
before the season began.
"We talked about [playing on
the road] being our next step,"
Shaw said. "Can we show the matu
rity necessary to play well on the
road taking care of the ball, han

dling the noise, realizing there's
going to be a lot of emotions lead
ing up to this game, limiting our
penalties? Can we still play smart
and play our style of football?
That's our test."
