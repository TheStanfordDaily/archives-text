## R&DE spends $50 million on summer renovations 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
R&DE Student Housing, which manages
5 million square feet of Stanford buildings,
spent roughly $5O million on undergraduate
and graduate housing renovations this sum
mer. The renovations included improve
ments to student comfort, energy and water
efficiency, health and safety.
Over 250 projects were completed in the
past year, 50 of which were completed over
the summer. The most significant renova
tions were completed in small group houses
including Haus Mitteleuropa, Slavianskii
Dom, Phi Sig, Hammarskjold and Synergy.
The projects on these houses involved
removing existing fire escapes, building new
staircases, replacing doors and windows and
renovating bathrooms. In Hammarskjold,
new rooms and a lounge space were added
in a newly constructed wing on the right
hand side of the building. The Synergy and
Slavianskii Dom kitchens were remodeled.
"We try to group the small projects so as
to achieve multiple goals while working in
one location such as replacing mechani
cal equipment with a roof, or carpet with
paint," Rodger Whitney, executive director
of R&DE Student Housing, wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Other projects arise out
of needs which occur during the year,
including issues raised by residents."
For example, renovations in the Cluster
One and Cowell Cluster houses were
grouped together for convenience.
Upgrades at the Terra, Pi Beta Phi, ZAP and
Kappa Alpha Theta houses were completed
between Aug. 20 and Sept. 15.
"The roof replacement being undertaken
at each site will enhance student safety and
comfort," according to an R&DE Student
Housing report on the construction projects.
On West Campus, a similar project was
completed to improve the roofs of Kappa

Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 680 Lomita
and Theta Delta Chi houses. This group of
renovations was the last to be completed
over the summer, ending on Sept. 17.
"Stern Hall was a great example of a
location with a convergence of projects,"
Whitney said. "[The construction] included
roof replacements for the residential wings
and dining hall, mechanical systems
replacement for the dining hall, some
servery remodeling, a kitchen elevator
replacement, fire alarm system replace
ment, resident fellow apartment upgrades ..
. lounge upgrades and new carpetfing]."

Wilbur Hall received the fourth and final
phase of its renovations with changes to the
Junipero and Okada dormitories. The reno
vations included new computing wiring and
other electrical improvements, new fire
sprinklers, remodeled restrooms, new carpet
and fresh paint.
Graduate student housing renovations
include the ninth phase of the Escondido
Village project, which included the update
of six low-rise apartment buildings this sum
mer. New carpeting was installed, fresh
paint applied and windows and doors were
replaced with energy-efficient fixtures.

Whitney said that this initiative for graduate
student housing renovations will continue
next year and will include modifications to
the McFarland mid-rise in Escondido
Village.
Future renovations plans include renova
tions in Florence Moore Flail to the dining
hall kitchen, bathrooms, common areas and
RF apartments, as well as potential kitchen
renovations in Kairos and 717 Dolores dur
ing the summer of 2013.
