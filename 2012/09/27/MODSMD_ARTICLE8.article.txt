## Lack of transparency at root of financial debacles, report says 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
Financial catastrophes such as the 2007 sub
prime mortgage crisis owe their timing as much to a
lack of transparency and disclosure as to underlying
economic weaknesses, according to Stanford
researchers.
In a draft paper, flan Guttman, assistant professor of
accounting at the Graduate School of Business, and
Ilan Kremer, professor of finance, argue that panicky
investor behavior, such as that which prompted the
spread of the 2007 crisis to global financial markets,
results in part from managers' reluctance to disclose
bad news in times of crisis.
The sudden disclosure of bad news from one com
pany, according to the researchers, makes investors
more risk-averse while often prompting them to make
up losses by selling assets in other sectors. This pro
motes a more general capital flight.
The paper suggests instead a greater level of trans
parency by firms in times of crisis to mitigate investors'
reliance on rumor and speculation.
