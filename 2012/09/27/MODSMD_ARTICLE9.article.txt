# Measure C would allow for three Palo Alto pot dispensaries
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Palo Alto voters will decide whether to allow med
ical marijuana dispensaries within city limits during the
upcoming Nov. 6 election. A yes vote on Measure C
would amend the Palo Alto Municipal Code to allow
for three retail marijuana dispensaries that could be
located in any commercially or industrially zoned area.
Dispensaries would have to be 1,500 feet from resi
dential zones, 600 feet from schools and 500 feet from
public libraries, public parks, day care centers or sub
stance abuse rehabilitation centers.
The measure requires the dispensaries to operate
only between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m., with no children
under the age of 18 to be admitted to a dispensary
unless they are patients and accompanied by a parent
or guardian. Marijuana consumption on the premises
of a dispensary will be prohibited, but dispensary own

ers will be allowed to grow marijuana on the premises.
If Measure C passes, Palo Alto will become the only
municipality on the Peninsula with medical marijuana
dispensaries.
The Palo Alto City Council voted unanimously
against Measure C's approval.
The measure stipulates that the dispensaries would
be taxed at a 4 percent rate. San Jose, another Bay
Area municipality that allows medical marijuana dis
pensaries to operate within its borders, taxes at a rate
of 7 percent.
However, if Measure C does pass, any potential dis
pensary owner would have to first locate a storefront
to operate out of. Currently, the downtown Palo Alto
vacancy rate is hovering at about 2 percent, with an
approximately $3-per-square-foot rent rate (a number
that is relatively high for commercially zoned districts)
according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The Palo Alto City Council passed an ordinance
prohibiting medical marijuana dispensaries in 1996,
and since then none have operated in the city.
