## Class of'16 done Confessing' 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It has been less than two weeks since the
Class of 2016 descended on the Farm. In the
midst of choosing classes, registering bikes
and checking out the first fraternity parties,
a few freshmen have found the time to do
one more thing: close down the admissions
advice blog they started back in June.
"Confessions from Stanford" posted its
first article on June 17. The blog was
archived on Tuesday and is no longer
accepting new posts.
In a statement issued to The Daily, blog
administrators Amelia Brooks 'l6 and Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 stated that they were
choosing to shut down the site because "[it]
started to lose its sense of direction."
Brooks, the blog's founder, originally
started the blog as a personal project with
the intention of finding "away to track [her]
transition from high school through [her]
freshman year at Stanford and share that
transition with prospective applicants to
give them a 'real' picture of what life [at
Stanford] is like."
Within a few weeks of starting the blog,
she posted in the Official Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook group looking for additional
writers and quickly received over 50
responses from interested students.
"Almost immediately, the blog's popular
ity boomed," Brooks wrote in an email to
Tlie Daily.
According to the site's Google Analytics
report, "Confessions" has received over
40,000 hits from 10,192 unique visitors in
103 countries since June 28.
Despite the numbers, Brooks and
Mouzykantskii said that the large number
of contributors and "nonexistent editing
structure" resulted in the blog receiving "a
negative perception from both inside and
outside the Stanford community."
When the site was live, posts were divid
ed into categories such as My Story,

Applying and Admission, Why Stanford,
Questbridge and The Common App. The
site's headline stated that the blog was
meant to "contain our insights and experi
ences from our journey to Stanford, and our
perspective of life here as freshmen," with
most of the posts focusing on providing
admissions advice to future applicants.
Vienna Harvey 'l6, one of the blog's con
tributors, said she first heard about the blog
from Brooks' post in the Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook group.
"It just seemed like a really cool idea,"
Harvey said. "It was something new because
I had never really blogged before so I
thought I would just give it a try."
Harvey, whose single post for the blog
was titled "Sometimes It's Good to Be
Wrong: Like when you think you won't get
in and then you do," followed a pattern for
one-time posters a brief summary of her
academic experiences thus far, including
SAT scores, followed by a recap of her per
sonal experience of applying to college,
learning she was admitted and deciding she

wanted to attend Stanford.
Alex Barata 'l6, another con
tributor, stated that he thought
having access to a blog such as this
one would have proved useful
during his own application
process.
"I think it would have been
helpful because each school has
its own personality," Barata said.
"Reading the posts by actual stu
dents lets you see what kind of
students they are looking for."
Barata's post was titled "We
Are Gatsby!" and drew a compar
ison between the Farm and
Fitzgerald's famous character.
"I think Stanford is kind of like
Fitzgerald's Gatsby," Barata
wrote. "It is the new money
among these academic power
houses that existed long before
California was even a state."
During its three-month run,
reactions to the blog from cur
rent students and alumni varied.

At one point, a disclaimer side
bar on the site read, "We under
stand that we are the youngest
members of the Stanford com
munity and we apologize if we
sound presumptuous. We are
honored to join you and learn
from you over the next few years
. . . please bear with our unbri
dled naivete and enthusiasm as
we make our transition."
Despite their decision to
archive the site, Brooks and
Mouzykantskii remain hopeful
that a blog that provides students
with an accurate look into
Stanford life will become avail
able in the future.
"While we are sad to acknowl
edge that Confessions from
Stanford did not fulfill what we
had hoped, we still believe there is
tremendous unexplored potential
in this type of publication," their
statement read. "We believe that
at some point in the future, anoth
er publication will be able to do
what Confessions from Stanford
could not."

Alex Barata 'l6, another con
tributor, stated that he thought
having access to a blog such as this
one would have proved useful
during his own application
process.
"I think it would have been
helpful because each school has
its own personality," Barata said.
"Reading the posts by actual stu
dents lets you see what kind of
students they are looking for."
Barata's post was titled "We
Are Gatsby!" and drew a compar
ison between the Farm and
Fitzgerald's famous character.
"I think Stanford is kind of like
Fitzgerald's Gatsby," Barata
wrote. "It is the new money
among these academic power
houses that existed long before
California was even a state."
During its three-month run,
reactions to the blog from cur
rent students and alumni varied.

At one point, a disclaimer side
bar on the site read, "We under
stand that we are the youngest
members of the Stanford com
munity and we apologize if we
sound presumptuous. We are
honored to join you and learn
from you over the next few years
. . . please bear with our unbri
dled naivete and enthusiasm as
we make our transition."
Despite their decision to
archive the site, Brooks and
Mouzykantskii remain hopeful
that a blog that provides students
with an accurate look into
Stanford life will become avail
able in the future.
"While we are sad to acknowl
edge that Confessions from
Stanford did not fulfill what we
had hoped, we still believe there is
tremendous unexplored potential
in this type of publication," their
statement read. "We believe that
at some point in the future, anoth
er publication will be able to do
what Confessions from Stanford
could not."

It has been less than two weeks since the
Class of 2016 descended on the Farm. In the
midst of choosing classes, registering bikes
and checking out the first fraternity parties,
a few freshmen have found the time to do
one more thing: close down the admissions
advice blog they started back in June.
"Confessions from Stanford" posted its
first article on June 17. The blog was
archived on Tuesday and is no longer
accepting new posts.
In a statement issued to The Daily, blog
administrators Amelia Brooks 'l6 and Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 stated that they were
choosing to shut down the site because "[it]
started to lose its sense of direction."
Brooks, the blog's founder, originally
started the blog as a personal project with
the intention of finding "away to track [her]
transition from high school through [her]
freshman year at Stanford and share that
transition with prospective applicants to
give them a 'real' picture of what life [at
Stanford] is like."
Within a few weeks of starting the blog,
she posted in the Official Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook group looking for additional
writers and quickly received over 50
responses from interested students.
"Almost immediately, the blog's popular
ity boomed," Brooks wrote in an email to
Tlie Daily.
According to the site's Google Analytics
report, "Confessions" has received over
40,000 hits from 10,192 unique visitors in
103 countries since June 28.
Despite the numbers, Brooks and
Mouzykantskii said that the large number
of contributors and "nonexistent editing
structure" resulted in the blog receiving "a
negative perception from both inside and
outside the Stanford community."
When the site was live, posts were divid
ed into categories such as My Story,

Applying and Admission, Why Stanford,
Questbridge and The Common App. The
site's headline stated that the blog was
meant to "contain our insights and experi
ences from our journey to Stanford, and our
perspective of life here as freshmen," with
most of the posts focusing on providing
admissions advice to future applicants.
Vienna Harvey 'l6, one of the blog's con
tributors, said she first heard about the blog
from Brooks' post in the Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook group.
"It just seemed like a really cool idea,"
Harvey said. "It was something new because
I had never really blogged before so I
thought I would just give it a try."

was titled "Sometimes It's Good to Be

in and then you do," followed a pattern for
