## EDITORIAL Dear Frosh: Shared responsibility starts with you 
### 
Welcome to the Farm.
You've sat through NSO,
met your dormmates, had
a week of classes and now it's final
ly your first real weekend at
Stanford.

In past years, you might have
enjoyed an all-campus frat party on
your first post-NSO Monday night,
a raucous rollout by older students
who used to live in your dorm on
Wednesday and numerous all-cam
pus parties this weekend.
As you may have noticed,
things are different now, and you
should know why.
Alcohol-related hospital trans
ports have been rising year after
year, and the University has taken
an increasingly strict stance toward
alcohol, going so far as to ban hard
alcohol for students even stu
dents over the age of 21 during
this year's summer session.
We remember being freshmen.
And, for the most part, we remem
ber all the stupid things we've
done, with alcohol and without.
But it's important to understand
that ultimately, when it comes to
your drinking, the consequences of
your actions extend far beyond
yourself and your liver.
The University, your RFs, your
RAs, fraternities and row houses:
these people can all do everything
they can to help you, for your own

sake and for theirs. But in the end, it's
your responsibility to watch after
yourself and know your limits—or
know that you don't know your limit
and err on the side of caution.

You don't want to be the person
on the stretcher. You don't want to
be the person in the crowd, watch
ing your roommate being carted
away, wishing you had done some
thing earlier in the night. You don't
want to be the person egging your
friends on to take more shots, not
knowing their tolerance or what
will happen.
You have four full years left to
drink, and plenty of opportunities
to do so. It isn't worth going over
board on your first night, or week,
or even month at college. It will
have deleterious effects on you,
your dorm and our campus social
scene.

This University has long grant
ed its students a great deal of per
sonal freedom. That freedom, how
ever, is predicated upon our ability
to use it responsibly.
So go out this weekend, hang
out with friends and introduce
yourself to the Stanford social
scene. This is an incredibly fun,
largely safe campus, and the main
danger to your personal safety will
be yourself If you decide to drink,
please drink responsibly. If not for
your own sake, then for ours.
