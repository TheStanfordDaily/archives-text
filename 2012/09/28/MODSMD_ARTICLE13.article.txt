## ACADEMICS New design course will help guide sophomores 
### ILEAN A NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The class of 2016 can anticipate a
new course offering next year from
the Institute of Design called
Designing Your Stanford, which will
apply elements from the popular
Designing Your Life course to help
underclassmen make the most of
their Stanford experience.
According to Dave Evans, an
instructor for Designing Your Life
and one of the faculty leaders for
Designing Your Stanford, the idea
for the course came out of student
interest sophomores were often
caught sneaking in to the upper
classmen-only Designing Your Life
to map out their life after college.
Given this interest, and results
from the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES)
report that concluded sophomores
need more resources for navigating
course offerings and time to reflect
on their interests, the Institute of
Design and SUES committee began
to discuss creating a course that
would help sophomores map out
their Stanford career, according to
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam.
"We want to give students more
tools to reflect on their values and
goals, and to think about their edu
cational plans in this context," Elam
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
hope this class will provide some of
these tools."
Evans said that planning formal
ly began over the summer and is still
underway. A pilot course comprised
of selected sophomores is expected
to launch this spring, followed by a

regular course launch next fall.
Other members of the planning
committee include Executive
Director of the Design Program Bill
Burnett, other faculty members, sen
iors who had taken "Designing Your
Life" and four interns from the
Class of 2015.
According to intern Andrew
Rodriguez 'l5, the summer work
consisted of brainstorming sessions,
modeling prototype exercises for
the class and reading literature on
developmental psychology and
transformational learning.
One of the prototypes Rodriguez
described included inviting sopho
mores on campus to select five
potential majors from a list of all of
the majors Stanford offers. They
were instructed to choose one major
that they never would have consid
ered before, or one they had not
even known existed.
The students then had to explain
why they chose the unusual major,
often an academic interest they
wanted to pursue but wouldn't nec
essarily commit to as a major. They
were given alternative ways of ful
filling this interest by talking to pro
fessors in the field, reading research
papers on the subject and joining
affiliated student groups, Rodriguez
said.
Rodriguez and the other interns
were asked to participate in the
summer planning because of their
participation in a seminar called
Reflections, which was offered last
winter and will return this year.
The students met once a week in
sections for 90 minutes for no aca-
demic credit to "stop and
think about what they want
in the larger context,"
Rodriguez said.
Because of his fulfilling
experience in Reflections,
Rodriguez said he jumped at
the chance to participate in
the creation of a course that
he feels is necessary for
underclassmen.
"It's not just about
encouraging people to think
more, because everyone
wants to think more, but it
gives you different ways to
think about how to approach
the decisions you have to

make in your college life,"
Rodriguez said.
Elam said that at a time
when students are working
on declaring their major, the
course would provide a great
resource due to its design
roots.
"Design thinking is cross
disciplinary, and we think it
can be a useful tool for stu
dents intending to major in
any field," Elam said.
Evans echoed Elam's per
spective on the application of
design to any major, adding
that in a "post-Web 2.0
world," innovation principles
are particularly critical to stu
dents' education.
"Other parts of the world
are going to beat us at manu
facturing, other parts of the
world are going to beat us at

a lot of things," Evans said,
"But clearly a core compe
tency should be creativity
and innovation in North
America in general, in Silicon
Valley in particular, and in
the hub of Silicon Valley
which we tend to think of as
Stanford."
As planning continues on
through the spring quarter
pilot, Evans hopes that stu
dents will get excited for this
opportunity and that it will
serve the purpose for which it
was designed.
"If we develop something
that meets a real need and is
fun, valuable and useful, then
students take care of the
rest," Evans said.
