# SEEING GREEN
## Sunshine's Gloomy Forecast 
### Holly Moeller 
The storm peaked at 3 a.m.,
with winds that slammed
sheets of rain against the
sides of the house. I'd left the win
dow open to hear the rainfall. Now,
to get closer to the storm, I wan
dered outside in my pajamas.
I've been inordinately fond of
rain since spending a summer in
the Pacific Northwest, and as a
current California resident, I was
looking forward to plentiful thun
derstorms on my trip back east.
But in the month I'd spent work
ing with collaborators on Cape
Cod, this was only the second bout
of rainfall I'd seen, and some locals
were grumbling about the dry
spell's ill effects on their lawns.
Still, Cape Cod's dry patch is
nothing compared to what is being
experienced by the rest of the
country. This summer has been the
driest since 1936; at one point,
three-quarters of the land area in
the 48 contiguous states was expe
riencing drought conditions. As of
last week, 20 percent of the country
was still experiencing "extreme" or
"exceptional" drought.

To make matters worse, the
most afflicted regions overlap with
large swaths of the nation's corn
and soybean cropland. Both crops
depend upon rainfall for water
(unlike fruits and veggies, which
are typically irrigated), and during
droughts, prospects are grim. At
the beginning of August, the
United States Department of
Agriculture rated almost half the
corn crop and one-third of the soy
bean crop as "poor or very poor."
The dire predictions have had
local and global repercussions.
Some farmers cut their losses,
mowing and baling stunted corn
plants for animal feed. Wall Street
futures markets jumped at the
thought of a coming shortage.
Cattle and pig farmers dialed back

production in anticipation of high
feed prices late in the season,
when they would ordinarily be fat
tening stock on corn. News agen
cies warned consumers to expect
elevated food prices in the new
year, when harvest shortfalls final
ly trickled down to supermarket
shelves. And internationally, food
prices, which had already jumped
up 10 percent in July, rose again as
corn and soybean prices reached
an all-time high.
While increasing food costs
present budgetary problems to
every household, hitting poor fam
ilies and countries especially hard,
the wild fluctuations in food sup
ply and, therefore, costs add
an extra complication. Variability
makes it hard for farmers to know
what to plant, for individuals to
know what to save and for govern
ments and aid organizations to
know how to help.

Since the advent of modern
technologies like specialized
plant strains, fertilizers and pesti
cides, we've gotten better at dodg
ing crop failure and more effi
cient at extracting the maximum
amount of food out of every
farmed acre. Agricultural reliabil
ity has been a boon for economic
and social growth in much the
same way that the advent of agri
culture itself was: Rather than
spending all our time hunting and
gathering (or tending our fields),
we could focus our efforts on
building civilizations (or busi
nesses) without worrying about
our next meal.

But in an unfortunately ironic
twist, the reliability of our food
crops has actually increased the
risk of catastrophic failure. To
economize on time and money,
most American farms have
become centralized, consisting pri
marily of huge swaths of land
planted with one of two cash
crops, corn or soybeans. While
such a focus has made the United
States the world's biggest corn
exporter, it has also left the middle
of the country dependent upon the
success of a few strains of a couple
species. And during a drought year
like this one, such dependence is
keenly felt.
The future isn't looking partic
ularly stable either. Scientists pre
dict that anthropogenic climate
change will shift rainfall patterns
around the globe, likely increasing
drought frequency in many of our
present-day breadbasket regions.
As farmers, markets and trading
routes rearrange themselves in an
attempt to keep up, global food
prices will become more volatile,
and global food security will drop.
In other words, for most families,
dinner will become more expen
sive and less reliable.
This year, however, as if to
underscore the future's uncertain
ty, the corn harvest that has begun
to trickle in looks better than what
had been predicted. Late-season
rains may yet bolster wilting soy
beans. Food prices may rise only a
few percent. And it may not be
long before we forget this year's
drought, and turn to the new
planting season, humming that old
refrain, "When I wanted sunshine,
I got rain."
