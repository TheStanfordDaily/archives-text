## Stanford reaps what it sows 
### Joey Beyda 
We knew this one
might not be pretty.
Of course, Thursday
night's blind date
was even less attrac
tive than we expected.
Quarterback Josh Nunes was
making his first start on the road in a
cavernous NFL stadium, backup tail
back Anthony Wilkerson was out for
the week with a leg injury and
Washington was looking to unseat the
No. 8 Cardinal as second-best team in
the Pac-12 North. But none of that
fully explains Thursday night. None of
that fully explains 17-13. None of that
fully explains 3-1.
Head coach David Shaw said in
the preseason that it takes a team
three games to find its identity. If
Stanford had found such an identity
just in time to upset USC, it had lost it
again in the week and a half before it
faced the Huskies.
The Cardinal's defense was rock
solid for the first 44 minutes and 59
seconds, flustering Keith Price and
holding back Washington's hurry-up.
But it allowed two big plays for Husky
touchdowns, each of which should've
been snuffed out for just a few yards.
Its only moment of transcendent
excellence—Trent Murphy's pick-six
for Stanford's only touchdown was
outdone by a moment of transcen
dent silliness: Ben Gardner's late off
sides penalty on third-and-4 that
essentially ended the game.
Offensively, the effort just wasn't
there from Stanford's playmakers. Ty
Montgomery dropped three catch
able deep balls, nobody but Zach Ertz
was getting open and Stepfan Taylor
went for just 75 yards on the night.
Of course, all the blame will begin
falling on Nunes. His 18-for-37 passing
and 170 yards were not a step in the
right direction (Shaw expects 60 per
cent completion rates), and his inter
ception in the final minutes was
Stanford's last touch of the night.
Nunes had been underthrowing
Levine Toilolo all season on that
jump-ball play. This time, Toilolo was
in single-coverage and had a bit of
separation in front of Desmond
Trufant. What a time to go with the
overthrow.
In the first half it didn't look like
Nunes' inaccuracy would make much
of a difference, since neither quarter
back could get things going. Nunes
underthrew his receivers consistently
to go 7-for-18 and lead five three-and
outs in the first two quarters. Keith
Price was just a completion better at
8-for-18; flustered by the Cardinal's
four steamrollers at linebacker and
angry at his injury-depleted offensive
line, Price was seen sitting alone on
the sidelines between possessions.
Price bounced back, showing
enthusiasm on the sidelines and got
that big-play help to keep his team in
the game. Nunes completed several
passes down the stretch, but there
wasn't even enough support for the
Cardinal to score an offensive touch
down. The last time Stanford's offense
has failed to get into the endzone?
2007, in a 23-6 defeat at Oregon State.
This one stings, but maybe not as
much as I would have expected. A
month ago most of the country would
have laughed at the thought of the
Cardinal still being a top-10 team
without Andrew Luck. Three wins
later, we had a week-plus back at the
top, and the Huskies just helped
remind us that we didn't really belong
there at least, not yet.
Was the USC win a fluke? I don't
think so. But the same Stanford team
that upset the Trojans wasn't on the
field Seattle last night, and in the
world of college football, you can't
afford a bad 60 minutes if you want to
stay at the top. Or even a bad 15.
The good news for the Cardinal is
that it has seven more games to prove
itself in the Pac-12, which arguably has
more parity than any other confer
ence right now. Oregon has still
proven itself the clear No. 1, but
Stanford, Washington, Oregon State,
USC, UCLA and Arizona (in no par
ticular order) have all looked like
contenders at one point or another. It
will be a fun two months sorting that
all out.
In the meantime, Shaw will be say
ing for the fourth straight week that
his team can play so much better. We
might not have believed him after his
team knocked off USC, but now it's
clear that Shaw has been right all
along.

Joseph Beyda spent the night in a
constant state of frustration, especial
ly because his roommate's television
was streaming the game 10 seconds
faster than his. For ideas on how he
can relieve the pain or speed up his
Internet, email him at jbeyda@stan

Price bounced back, showing
enthusiasm on the sidelines and got
that big-play help to keep his team in
the game. Nunes completed several
passes down the stretch, but there
wasn't even enough support for the
Cardinal to score an offensive touch
down. The last time Stanford's offense
has failed to get into the endzone?

This one stings, but maybe not as
much as I would have expected. A
month ago most of the country would
have laughed at the thought of the
Cardinal still being a top-10 team
without Andrew Luck. Three wins
later, we had a week-plus back at the
top, and the Huskies just helped
remind us that we didn't really belong
there at least, not yet.
Was the USC win a fluke? I don't
think so. But the same Stanford team
that upset the Trojans wasn't on the
field Seattle last night, and in the
world of college football, you can't
afford a bad 60 minutes if you want to
stay at the top. Or even a bad 15.
The good news for the Cardinal is
that it has seven more games to prove
itself in the Pac-12, which arguably has
more parity than any other confer
ence right now. Oregon has still
proven itself the clear No. 1, but
Stanford, Washington, Oregon State,
USC, UCLA and Arizona (in no par
ticular order) have all looked like
contenders at one point or another. It
will be a fun two months sorting that
all out.
In the meantime, Shaw will be say
ing for the fourth straight week that
his team can play so much better. We
might not have believed him after his
team knocked off USC, but now it's
clear that Shaw has been right all
along.

We knew this one
might not be pretty.
Of course, Thursday
night's blind date
was even less attrac
tive than we expected.
Quarterback Josh Nunes was
making his first start on the road in a
cavernous NFL stadium, backup tail
back Anthony Wilkerson was out for
the week with a leg injury and
Washington was looking to unseat the
No. 8 Cardinal as second-best team in
the Pac-12 North. But none of that
fully explains Thursday night. None of
that fully explains 17-13. None of that
fully explains 3-1.
Head coach David Shaw said in
the preseason that it takes a team
three games to find its identity. If
Stanford had found such an identity
just in time to upset USC, it had lost it
again in the week and a half before it
faced the Huskies.
The Cardinal's defense was rock
solid for the first 44 minutes and 59
seconds, flustering Keith Price and
holding back Washington's hurry-up.
But it allowed two big plays for Husky
touchdowns, each of which should've
been snuffed out for just a few yards.
Its only moment of transcendent
excellence—Trent Murphy's pick-six
for Stanford's only touchdown was
outdone by a moment of transcen
dent silliness: Ben Gardner's late off
sides penalty on third-and-4 that
essentially ended the game.
Offensively, the effort just wasn't
there from Stanford's playmakers. Ty
Montgomery dropped three catch
able deep balls, nobody but Zach Ertz
was getting open and Stepfan Taylor
went for just 75 yards on the night.
Of course, all the blame will begin
falling on Nunes. His 18-for-37 passing
and 170 yards were not a step in the
right direction (Shaw expects 60 per
cent completion rates), and his inter
ception in the final minutes was
Stanford's last touch of the night.
Nunes had been underthrowing
Levine Toilolo all season on that
jump-ball play. This time, Toilolo was
in single-coverage and had a bit of
separation in front of Desmond
Trufant. What a time to go with the
overthrow.
In the first half it didn't look like
Nunes' inaccuracy would make much
of a difference, since neither quarter
back could get things going. Nunes
underthrew his receivers consistently
to go 7-for-18 and lead five three-and
outs in the first two quarters. Keith
Price was just a completion better at
8-for-18; flustered by the Cardinal's
four steamrollers at linebacker and
angry at his injury-depleted offensive
line, Price was seen sitting alone on
the sidelines between possessions.
Price bounced back, showing
enthusiasm on the sidelines and got
that big-play help to keep his team in
the game. Nunes completed several
passes down the stretch, but there
wasn't even enough support for the
Cardinal to score an offensive touch
down. The last time Stanford's offense
