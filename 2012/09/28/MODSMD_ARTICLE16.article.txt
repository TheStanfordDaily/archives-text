# CARD MUST SINK OR SWIM
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The arrival of new head coach Jeremy
Gunn sparked plenty of change in the men's
soccer team this year.
After just one postseason appearance since
2002, Gunn's high-energy approach resonated
with players in offseason training, and the
team has come into the season determined to
press forward and continually test the oppos
ing defense.
A month into the season, however,
Stanford (3-4) still has yet to really break
through. A season-opening triumph on the
road at the University of San Francisco was a
solid win, and a road upset of then-No. 11 UC-
Irvine was an impressive victory. But with the
good have been some growing pains, as two
overtime losses have pushed the Cardinal
back under .500 on the season.
With No. 9 UCLA visiting the Farm

tonight, Gunn's troops are geared up to spring
another upset and kick off Pac-12 play with a
clean slate.
"We're excited to get a chance at a fresh
start in the Pac-12," starting goalkeeper Drew
Hutchins said. "Everyone [in the conference]
is 0-0 and we are really looking forward to the
weekend."
Hutchins has been part of the Cardinal's
staunch defense early on, allowing just nine
goals in seven starts and saving 18 shots to add
to his two shutouts. With sophomores Jimmy
Callinan and Tyler Conklin, freshman
Brandon Vincent and senior Hunter Gorskie
manning the backline, Stanford has been rela
tively efficient in defense. But the team has
been plagued by early goals opponents
have scored three goals inside the first 15 min
utes of play this season.
There can be no such letdown this week-
