# CARD MUST SINK OR SWIM
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The arrival of new head coach Jeremy
Gunn sparked plenty of change in the men's
soccer team this year.
After just one postseason appearance since
2002, Gunn's high-energy approach resonated
with players in offseason training, and the
team has come into the season determined to
press forward and continually test the oppos
ing defense.
A month into the season, however,
Stanford (3-4) still has yet to really break
through. A season-opening triumph on the
road at the University of San Francisco was a
solid win, and a road upset of then-No. 11 UC-
Irvine was an impressive victory. But with the
good have been some growing pains, as two
overtime losses have pushed the Cardinal
back under .500 on the season.
With No. 9 UCLA visiting the Farm

tonight, Gunn's troops are geared up to spring
another upset and kick off Pac-12 play with a
clean slate.
"We're excited to get a chance at a fresh
start in the Pac-12," starting goalkeeper Drew
Hutchins said. "Everyone [in the conference]
is 0-0 and we are really looking forward to the
weekend."
Hutchins has been part of the Cardinal's
staunch defense early on, allowing just nine
goals in seven starts and saving 18 shots to add
to his two shutouts. With sophomores Jimmy
Callinan and Tyler Conklin, freshman
Brandon Vincent and senior Hunter Gorskie
manning the backline, Stanford has been rela
tively efficient in defense. But the team has
been plagued by early goals opponents
have scored three goals inside the first 15 min
utes of play this season.
There can be no such letdown this week-

This weekend's matchups with No. 8 UCLA and San Diego State mark the beginning of the
Pac-12 season, and a chance for Stanford to prove that it belongs in the conference title hunt.
end. Tonight's matchup with
UCLA will be one of the
biggest tests of the year, as
the Bruins were picked as
the favorite to win the con
ference in the preseason
Pac-12 coaches poll and are
rolling through opponents
thus far this year.
UCLA stayed hot after
earning impressive results
on the road last weekend.
The Bruins earned a tough
1-1 draw at No. 3 UC-Santa
Barbara in front of a hostile
crowd of over 7,500, before
beating Cal Poly in a 1-0 vic
tory. With the win and the
tie, UCLA upped their
unbeaten streak to seven
matches.

It's been hard for just
about anyone to score on
the Bruins dating back to
last year, the UCLA
defense has shut out 12 of
the Bruins' last 17 oppo
nents, including a school
record-tying eight in a row
last season. Junior Patrick
Matchett and freshman
Javan Torre will be tough to
handle in the back, and
sophomore Earl Edwards
and freshman Juan
Cervantes have combined
for four shutouts in goal this
year, with each goalkeeper
tallying two. UCLA has also
shut out its last six Pac-12
opponents dating back to
last year and has not
allowed a goal to a Pac-12
opponent in the last 638
minutes of conference play.
In addition, UCLA is
unbeaten in their last 12
road matches dating back to

Sept. 18 of last year, going
10-0-2 in that time frame.
The Bruins won seven con
secutive road matches a year
ago, including a win in the
NCAA quarterfinals at
Louisville, and are 3-0-2 on
the road this year, earning
ties at No. 1 Maryland and
No. 3 UC-Santa Barbara and
victories at Virginia, Loyola
Marymount and Cal Poly.
In the last four seasons,
the Bruins have compiled a
30-4-6 conference mark, the
best amongst the Pac-12
teams. UCLA also enters
the season having won their
last 13 Pac-12 matches and
own a 39-6-7 lead in the all
time series between the two
teams, including both
matches last season.
It doesn't get much easier
on Sunday, as perennial con
tender San Diego State pays
a visit to Cagan Stadium.

The Aztecs (4-2-1) are riding
high on a three-game win
streak and have outscored
their opponents 15-3 in
those victories. After a tough
loss to open the season
against No. 8 Notre Dame,
San Diego State earned a
hard-fought 0-0 draw on the

road at No. 11 Indiana and
knocked off four of their
next five opponents.
But as Hutchins said,
Stanford is currently tied
for first place in the confer
ence and can take a big step
toward the postseason with
a pair of good results this

weekend. Kickoff today will
be at 4 p.m., and on Sunday
the game will start at 2:30
p.m. both matches will
be played at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
