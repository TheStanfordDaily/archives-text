# CROSS COUNTRY
## Runners prep for a new year 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Although both Stanford's cross country
teams have already seen action early this
season, Saturday morning marks the 39th
running of the Stanford Invitational, the
Cardinal's only home meet of the year, fea
turing 12 high school races as well as the
men's and women's collegiate races.
Both the No. 6 women and No. 9 men
will be heavy favorites to repeat in the team
races, as no top-25 men's teams are in the
field and No. 18 San Francisco is the
Cardinal's biggest competition on the
women's side.
But there will still be plenty of intrigue,
as the men are looking for the heir to grad
uated senior Chris Derrick as well as the
formation of a new core with the loss of sev
eral other key contributors to graduation.
The women are hoping to build on a 10th
place finish at the NCAA Championships
last season, returning senior All-American
Kathy Kroeger and standout sophomore
Aisling Cuffe.
The Cardinal men have gotten off to a
good start this year, sweeping the top four
places at the USF Invitational three weeks
ago. Redshirt junior Tyler Stutzman led
Stanford, finishing the 8,000-meter course
against mostly local competition in 24:45.00.
But redshirt sophomore Michael Atchoo,
and redshirt seniors Miles Unterreiner and
Benjamin Johnson all finished within a sec
ond of Stutzman, and redshirt senior Riley
Sullivan finished 10th to complete the
Stanford scoring in 25:21:00.
"We know we're in great shape coming
off a terrific summer of training and two
weeks at altitude," Unterreiner said. "But
we also know Saturday's race is just the
beginning of a long season.
We're not going to go out
there and race like it's the
national championship, but
we're looking forward to
having a nice solid start to
the season by winning on
our home course."
The women's squad is
also looking to start off with
a win. In the meet at USF,
Cuffe took the individual
title, covering the 6-kilome
ter course in 17:08.00.
Junior Jessica Tonn placed
third in 17:11.70, while
sophomore Mary Kate
Anselmini also had a top-10
finish, placing ninth in 17:57.90
the two-time defending
Stanford Invitational cham

pion Kroeger did not com
pete.

With one of the top
recruiting classes in the
country this year, the
Cardinal has a good chance
to reach the podium at
NCAAs and compete for
the team's 16th conference
title when the postseason
begins in late October.
Saturday's meet will also
be the first Stanford meet
under recently hired Franklin
P. Johnson Director of Track
& Field Chris Miltenberg,
who led the Georgetown
women to an upset victory
and the NCAA title a year
ago, something not lost on
either Cardinal squad.
As Unterreiner said,
"You'll really start to see us
racing fast come November."
