# SPORTS BRIEF
## Field hockey begins conference play at Cal 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The No. 13 Stanford field hockey team
will kick off its conference season at
California today, with the Pac-12 Network
on hand for the noon contest between the
two NorPac West Division foes. It will be
the first of five road games in 17 days for
the Cardinal and the first of two meetings
between the Bay Area rivals, which are the
only teams in the conference who have not
yet begun NorPac play.
A season ago, Stanford won both of its
games against the Bears who were
ranked No. 12 both times by identical 3-
2 scores.
Stanford (6-4) went 2-3 against top-25
opponents in its tough, season-opening
stretch, losing to a pair of No. 1 teams
(Maryland and North Carolina). It should
have an easier time in conference play, as it
is the only ranked team in
the NorPac.
