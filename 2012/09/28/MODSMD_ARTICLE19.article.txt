### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's soccer
team routed Oregon State 5-1 at
home Thursday night to take the
early lead in the Pac-12 confer
ence and extend its unbeaten run
at home to 60 games.

The No. 2 Cardinal (8-1-1)
comfortably defeated the No. 23
Beavers (9-1-1) to win its second
game of the Pac-12 conference
and make it six wins in a row.
Stanford's goals came from sopho
more forward Chioma Ubogagu,
redshirt junior forward Courtney
Verloo, redshirt freshman mid
fielder Haley Rosen, senior mid
fielder Nina Watkins and senior
midfielder Mariah Nogueira —
Oregon State's late consolation
goal was scored by freshman mid
fielder Gwen Bieck.
After Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe described the first
half against Arizona State last
weekend as the worst of its season
so far, the Card opened last night's
contest in style. Beavers junior
goalkeeper Audrey Bernier-
Larose could only get fingertips to

Übogagu's shot just three minutes
into the game and things only got
better for the home side. Verloo
controlled a long free kick taken
by senior defender Alina
Garciamendez to grab her fourth
goal in four consecutive games
halfway through the first period,
and when Haley Rosen put the
ball past Bernier-Larose four min
utes later, it looked like Stanford
may have already put the game
out of OSU's reach.

"It was a wakeup call last
week," Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "We started slowly
and then today we started fast and
you saw what we're capable of
doing if we start quick. I thought
the energy level was much better
tonight and people looked excited
to play."
The Cardinal returned for the
second half in even better form
than it had started the first.
Watkins scored the team's fourth
goal just 51 seconds into the peri
od and became the 12th Stanford
player to score this year.
"I think that we have a really
dynamic attack this year and
everyone is capable of scoring,"
Verloo said. "We have our mid
fielders scoring, our forwards scor
ing, center backs scoring. It's real
ly been from everywhere, which is
