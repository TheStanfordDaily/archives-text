## Stanford in Florence moves to new home 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's Breyer Center for Overseas Studies in Florence officially
moved into its new home, Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate, on July 16 and
now has welcomed its first group of students.
"One of our primary goals is to bring the students closer to the locals
and the Florentines closer to our students and to Stanford," Spogli
Family Director Linda Campani and Academic and Student Services
Coordinator Fosca D'Acierno wrote in a joint email to The Daily.
The program plans to host lecture series, concerts, film nights, art
exhibits, concerts, workshops and tastings to open the center.
The Palazzo is located in Florence's Oltrarno region in the San
Niccolo neighborhood, a 10-minute trip to the Duomo on foot, and was
constructed from 1406 to 1411. The only currently privately-owned and
inhabited palazzo in Florence, Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate was
designed by Lorenzo di Bicci.
"It almost seems like an Italian palace," Kaitlin Lang 'l4 wrote in an

The Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate sits on the Oltrarno side of
Florence's Arno River, about 10 minutes by foot from the Duomo.
