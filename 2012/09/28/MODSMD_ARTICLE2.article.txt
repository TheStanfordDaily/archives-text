## Stanford in Florence moves to new home 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's Breyer Center for Overseas Studies in Florence officially
moved into its new home, Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate, on July 16 and
now has welcomed its first group of students.
"One of our primary goals is to bring the students closer to the locals
and the Florentines closer to our students and to Stanford," Spogli
Family Director Linda Campani and Academic and Student Services
Coordinator Fosca D'Acierno wrote in a joint email to The Daily.
The program plans to host lecture series, concerts, film nights, art
exhibits, concerts, workshops and tastings to open the center.
The Palazzo is located in Florence's Oltrarno region in the San
Niccolo neighborhood, a 10-minute trip to the Duomo on foot, and was
constructed from 1406 to 1411. The only currently privately-owned and
inhabited palazzo in Florence, Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate was
designed by Lorenzo di Bicci.
"It almost seems like an Italian palace," Kaitlin Lang 'l4 wrote in an

email to The Daily.
No other programs use the
Palazzo, which is inhabited by many
members of the Capponi family.
"There is a lot of curiosity around
the Palazzo since up until now it has
never been open to the public,"
Campani and D'Acierno wrote.
The Brever Center, occupying
one floor of the Palazzo, is com
prised of one modern wing and one
traditional wing. There are offices,
classrooms, a break room, a student
lounge, a reading room, a kitchen
and an art studio, which are spread
throughout the center, along with
an outdoor terrace overlooking the
city's Arno River. The center is
secured via two buzz-in doors and a
doorman.
"I can cook my lunch in our own
large kitchen and eat on the terrace
overlooking the river and all of
Florence," Lang said. "I can study in
several different quiet areas and use
the texts, archives, computers and
other resources for information."
Lang added that although many
of the classrooms have been in use
by the Capponi family for cen
turies, they have been equipped
with modern classroom technolo
gy-
"The professors have been using
all of this technology on a daily
basis," she said. "For example, in my
Modern Italian Cinema class, our
professor is able to show us movies
on a huge screen with full surround
sound."

A few of the center's classrooms
happen to be some of the Palazzo's
most prestigious spaces.
"Our professors have comment
ed that teaching in the Mirror Hall
and the Coat of Arms Room is a
real privilege," Campani and
D'Acierno said.
"The rooms and halls are simply
more ample and functional," they
added. "The former facility just did
n't have enough room to enable the

students to invite their Italian
Mends over."
The Stanford in Florence
Program has previously been
housed in Villa San Paolo (1960-
1973), Villa il Salviatino (1973-1987)
and Palazzo Tempi (also known as
Palazzo Baragli Petrucci) from
1987-2012.
