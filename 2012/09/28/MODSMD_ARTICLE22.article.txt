# ALL WEEKEND: PALO ALTO FILM FESTIVAL
## 
### 
Among other things, Leland
Stanford (not Junior) was a gam
bling man. Most people don t
know that. Most people also don't
know that the birth of film was not only
in Palo Alto, but on this
very campus. It all started
when Stanford wagered
that at a gallop, all four of
the horse s feet came off
the ground (they do).
Eadweard Muybridge
crafted the contraption,
shot the reel, and the rest
is quite literally film histo
ry. You might have learned about it in
Annenberg Auditorium in one of Scott
Bukatman s classes.
With that, this year s Palo Alto
International Film Festival seems aptly
placed at the doorstep of our campus,
and the slate of technological innovation
might just rival that wondrous passage of

light through Mubridge s own aperture.
Yes, the PAIFF boasts a truly international
crop of films, sampling shorts and fea
tures from Hollywood ( Looper), the
area Pixar s new animated short
Paperman will be screen
ing in 3D and as reach
ing as Asia (the far side).
But the traditional film
festival is just one aspect
of this fest, and
Intermission is juiced.
When we aren t munch
ing on food truck grub,
we II be brushing up on
our skills in the workshops, sippin some
drank at the wine tastings, and listening
to the film/tech gods in the many pan
els, including an Oscar-winning special
effects editor from "E.T." Yeah. And
we didn t even mention the open-air,
free screenings! Flicks, could you get on
that?
