explores a dream
that many college
students subscribe to.
"The idea that this nerd
could become a rock star just by
opening his mouth is pretty
powerful," said Elizabeth Banks,
who produced and acted in the
film. Where can a nerd become
a rock star by singing? Only in
the world of college a cappella—
the backdrop for the film directed
by Jason Moore and starring Anna
Kendrick, Brittany Snow and
Hollywood's most recently favored
plus-sized starlet, Rebel Wilson
("Bridesmaids," "Bachelorette").
"Technically it's just a
movie where we sing; it's not a
musical," said Kendrick.
Even if it isn't a musical,
much of the talent behind the
film has theater experience.
Kendrick won a Tony Award at
the age of 12, while romantic
lead Skylar Astin starred in the
acclaimed Broadway hit "Spring
Awakening."
"When you do a Broadway
show, it really teaches you so
much about yourself, not just as
an actor but as a person,
because you have to churn this
product out eight times a week
and you have to really connect,"
said Astin. "It gave me this work
ethic that I apply to everything.
But this movie in particular, I
really got to dig into that
because this combines all the
elements of genres that I have
done before."
For Moore, the director of
Broadway hit "Avenue Q," the
most difficult part of his film
directorial debut was synthesiz
ing the a cappella component

into the movie.
"I was not prepared for how
intricate and talented you have
to be to sing all these different
parts all together and dance at
the same time, so I have an extra
kind of respect for a cappella
groups now that I've been
through this process. So do our
actors, now that we kind of bust
ed their asses to get them there."
Ester Dean, the Grammy
nominated songwriter behind
top hits by Rihanna, Katy Perry,
Beyonce and 50 Cent, also co
starred in the film. Before she
was cast, "Pitch Perfect" was
already set to include an a cap
pella rendition of Rihanna's hit
"S&M," which Dean wrote with
three other songwriters. "You
want your songs to be able to
keep on going and growing,"
said Dean, explaining how hon
ored she was to have the song
included in the film. Careful
not to be too self-congratulato
ry, Dean said that her favorite
song to perform was a mashup
between Bruno Mars and Nelly.
"One of the challenges of
picking a movie with music is
that you have such a long time
until it comes out, a year or
even more. How do you make it
relevant?" Moore said. He chose
to use "Titanium" before it
became the oft-played hit it is
today. The strategy that he
employed in selecting songs was
to pick songs of all genres so
that the film would appeal to a
broad audience.
"Pitch Perfect" is a comedy,
a movie where the characters
sing, a fictional a cappella
expose and, ultimately, a college
film. Moore explained the
appeal of setting a film in col
lege: "Everybody who has been

to college has had a similar
experience: meeting your room
mate for the first time and fig
uring out who your friends are
going to be, where your place is
in the world. That's a very relat
able thing for any age."
The experience of making
"Pitch Perfect" was kind of like
college, claimed co-stars Astin
and Anna Camp. It was the first
time since Camp's college expe
rience that she bonded so well
with a group of people. "We ate
together, we rehearsed together,
we lived in this hotel. It was
really, really exactly like college,"
she said. Except, maybe, for the
hotel part.

Anna Kendrick and
Brittany Snow made up for not
attending college during the
filming process in Louisiana,
when members of the cast were
dragged to an LSU football
game. "It was the first time I'd
ever tailgated before, and I defi
nitely made up for all my years
of not tailgating," said Snow.
"In one weekend!" laughed
Kendrick.
Savannah Kopp has never
attended a tailgate but would like
to note that Raagapella's newest
posters also explore a college
dream through their play on
"Inception."

film. Where can a nerd become
a rock star by singing? Only in
the world of college a cappella—
the backdrop for the film directed
by Jason Moore and starring Anna
Kendrick, Brittany Snow and
Hollywood's most recently favored
plus-sized starlet, Rebel Wilson
("Bridesmaids," "Bachelorette").
"Technically it's just a
movie where we sing; it's not a
musical," said Kendrick.
Even if it isn't a musical,
much of the talent behind the
film has theater experience.
Kendrick won a Tony Award at
the age of 12, while romantic
lead Skylar Astin starred in the
acclaimed Broadway hit "Spring
Awakening."
"When you do a Broadway
show, it really teaches you so
much about yourself, not just as
an actor but as a person,
because you have to churn this
product out eight times a week
and you have to really connect,"
said Astin. "It gave me this work
ethic that I apply to everything.
But this movie in particular, I
really got to dig into that
because this combines all the
elements of genres that I have
done before."
For Moore, the director of
Broadway hit "Avenue Q," the
most difficult part of his film
directorial debut was synthesiz
ing the a cappella component

into the movie.
"I was not prepared for how
intricate and talented you have
to be to sing all these different
parts all together and dance at
the same time, so I have an extra
kind of respect for a cappella
groups now that I've been
through this process. So do our
actors, now that we kind of bust
ed their asses to get them there."
Ester Dean, the Grammy
nominated songwriter behind
top hits by Rihanna, Katy Perry,
Beyonce and 50 Cent, also co
starred in the film. Before she
was cast, "Pitch Perfect" was
already set to include an a cap
pella rendition of Rihanna's hit
"S&M," which Dean wrote with
three other songwriters. "You
want your songs to be able to
keep on going and growing,"
said Dean, explaining how hon
ored she was to have the song
included in the film. Careful
not to be too self-congratulato
ry, Dean said that her favorite
song to perform was a mashup
between Bruno Mars and Nelly.
"One of the challenges of
picking a movie with music is
that you have such a long time
until it comes out, a year or
even more. How do you make it
relevant?" Moore said. He chose
to use "Titanium" before it
became the oft-played hit it is
today. The strategy that he
employed in selecting songs was
to pick songs of all genres so
that the film would appeal to a
broad audience.
"Pitch Perfect" is a comedy,
a movie where the characters
sing, a fictional a cappella
expose and, ultimately, a college
film. Moore explained the
appeal of setting a film in col
lege: "Everybody who has been

to college has had a similar
experience: meeting your room
mate for the first time and fig
uring out who your friends are
going to be, where your place is
in the world. That's a very relat
able thing for any age."
The experience of making
"Pitch Perfect" was kind of like
college, claimed co-stars Astin
and Anna Camp. It was the first
time since Camp's college expe
rience that she bonded so well
with a group of people. "We ate
together, we rehearsed together,
we lived in this hotel. It was
really, really exactly like college,"
she said. Except, maybe, for the
hotel part.

Anna Kendrick and
Brittany Snow made up for not
attending college during the
filming process in Louisiana,
when members of the cast were
dragged to an LSU football
game. "It was the first time I'd
ever tailgated before, and I defi
nitely made up for all my years
of not tailgating," said Snow.
"In one weekend!" laughed
Kendrick.
Savannah Kopp has never
attended a tailgate but would like
to note that Raagapella's newest
posters also explore a college
dream through their play on
"Inception."
