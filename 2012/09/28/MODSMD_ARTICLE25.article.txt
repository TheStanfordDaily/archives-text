## LUNICE, SHOW STEALER 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
If you were in Fred Turner's Digital
Media in Society class the other day,
you may have heard one of Stanford's
best lecturers speak about Beck, the master
mixer who, with his "two turntables and a
microphone," plays not an instrument but a
database of musicians. Such is the case with
Lunice, a magician with a soundboard for
whom the term "DJ" seems unjust.
At 330 Ritch in the bowels of San
Francisco, Rockie Fresh was set to play.
After half a dozen emcees tried their hand
at the mike with varying degrees of blun
der, the audience was not having it. For a
7:30 ticket time, by 10:20 the energy was

like a roaring Stanford crowd at a
Cardinal pingpong tournament. And then,
Lunice took the stage.
A dorky black kid with his shirt but
toned up (all the way) and backpack
strapped on, looking like some pre-politi
cian from UVA, Lunice's unassuming air
and cheeks-wide grin felt almost twee in
contrast with the almost hostilely impatient
SF skater/rap crowd. Lunice Fermin Pierre II
(we can't believe that's his real name either!)
hails from Montreal, and his pack of beat
making utensils was enough to crush the
crowd in less than three minutes.
It's a scene from almost every Disney

underdog movie (aren't they all?): geeky out
sider acts out some weird pre-performance
routine, cut to skeptical crowd, give him a
sec and everyone is abashedly impressed. (It's
also a scene from "Britain's Got Talent." See:
Susan Boyle.) Such a ritual ensued, as Lunice
oddly crossed his heart several times and
looked to the sky in prayer set to some
Gregorian chant sound-alike. Then, with
swift and rapid taps of his fingers, he har
nessed the crowd with some truly mad beatz.
BEATZ.
In the mix were 2 Chainz's "No Lie"
and Trae Tha Truth's "Fighting Words"

and Kanye West et al.'s "I Don't Like." For
that last one, Lunice flew the stage and
moshed with the crowd. I was texting my
mommy one second, dancing with the
artist the next. His almost hour-long set,
all as an opener to the headlining Rockie
Fresh mind you, closed near 11 p.m.,
when the hype men practically ushered
him off stage.
His last track, which mixed Waka's
"Fuck the Club Up" over electric beats,
exemplified what Lunice does best: re
crafting hefty rap songs with beeps and
boops to straddle the line between hipster
chic and raw hip-hop.
