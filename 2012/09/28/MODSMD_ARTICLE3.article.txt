## SUNet users must watch security video 'Stanford's network is attacked one million times amy day by probes' 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A new requirement by Stanford's
Information Security Office (ISO) will oblige all
Stanford community members to watch an
online information security awareness video by
Oct. 31 or risk account disconnection.
"Security incidents are happening all the time,
certainly at a higher rate than we'd like to see, and
the vast majority of them are preventable," wrote
David Hoffman, ISO information systems spe
cialist, in an email to The Daily.
"I think [the video] is really helpful," said Will
Dannemann 'l4, a Suites resident computing
consultant (RCC). "There's a lot of information
in it that people wouldn't appreciate normally,
and it's good to reiterate."
Some students have yet to be notified of the
requirement, which has been circulated through
dorm RCCs. New faculty, staff and sponsored
affiliates were notified of the requirement earlier.
The 15-minute video advises users to take
advantage of security software and safe browsing
practices, through a stick-figure-based presenta
tion representing online threats as similar to
those encountered in urban environments.
"The Internet is like a big town where there's
a sucker born every minute. Don't be one of
them," the video warns.
"A lot of what you learned about staying in
the real world can help you stay safe online, too,"
it says, noting that Stanford's network is attacked
one million times every day by probes seeking
vulnerabilities.
The video also cautions against file sharing
and copyright infringement, which it describes as
one of the most common misuses of the Stanford
network and one potentially resulting in internal
or external judicial ramifications.
According to the presentation, Stanford stu
dents have to date spent over $150,000 of their
own money settling lawsuits resulting from copy
right infringements, and could face suspension or
even expulsion from the University for the same
offense.
"Stanford takes this stuff seriously, and so
should you," the video warns.
Dannemann described the aver
age Stanford student as behaving in a
responsible manner online, but wel
comed the University's efforts to
ensure such behavior across the
entire community.
"There's a wide variety of experi
ence levels across the Stanford popu
lation, and it doesn't seem to matter
much whether you're talking about
students, staff or faculty," Hoffman

said, noting that the ISO has long
sought to provide SUNet users with
basic safety information.
Hoffman framed the video as part
of a broader effort to educate the
Stanford community about informa
tion security and safe online practices,
noting the University's provision of
tools for mobile security and two-step
authentication.
"We're always trying to make
things better," Hoffman wrote. "It's
important for people to have the
tools to protect themselves"
