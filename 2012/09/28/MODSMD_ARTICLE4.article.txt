# Admissions expanding to meet rising demand
## 10 new part-time readers to be hired this admissions cycle 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Coming off of the largest applicant pool in University
history, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions plans on
making significant expansions to its staff this year in order
to keep pace with growing interest from prospective stu
dents.
Ten new part-time reader positions will be added this
admissions cycle, bringing the number of individuals
responsible for assessing applications up to 64. Training for
these new readers starts at the end of October, in prepara
tion for the first round of applications, due Nov. 1.
But that's not the only change at Montag Hall, head
quarters of Stanford admissions, this fall.
Bob Patterson stepped down from his post as
Stanford's director of admissions last June to become the

director of college outreach at Chegg, Inc. The University
named Colleen Lim as his replacement in August.
The office is also preparing for an expansion of its
alumni interview program, which was approved by a
Faculty Senate committee in April 2011. This year will be
focused on building up the technological infrastructure to
support what will eventually become a worldwide pro
gram, according to Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw.
Sonya Smith, who had previously worked in the office,
was selected last month to oversee this expansion in a
newly created associate dean position. She will transition
to the new post on Oct. 1.

New director of admissions
Lim is not a newcomer to Stanford, having previously
worked at the University from
2007 to 2009 as an assistant
dean. She has known Dean
Shaw for even longer than
that the two worked
together when they were both
employed at Yale University.
"That's not my learning
curve in this new position,"
Lim joked, stating that their
shared past work experience
has helped to enhance com
munication.
To find Patterson's
replacement, the office con
ducted finalists' interviews in
June and July. According to
Shaw, Lim was picked
because of her past manage
ment experience, which he
said is crucial given the large
scope of the office's opera
tions.
"She has a proven track
record as an exceptional man
ager," Shaw said, referring to
her past work as a senior asso
ciate commissioner in the
West Coast Conference, in
addition to her time at
Stanford and Yale.
More application readers
hired
Perhaps the biggest obsta
cle Lim will face in her new
position is dealing logistically
with a growing number of
applicants. Last year, Stanford
received almost 37,000 fresh
men applications, a record for
the University. This increase
in candidates is expected to
continue this admissions
cycle.
"That is our challenge
that we do expect to have
comparable numbers," Lim
said.
One step the office has
taken to avoid this problem
is expanding its part-time
seasonal reader program. In
addition to approximately 25
admission officers who read
applications full time, the
office employs individuals
who are on contract to read
for the University for five
months of the year.
Last year, the office
employed 28 part-time read
ers. That number will swell to
38 this year, according to the
University's 2012-13 budget
report.
The office is currently in
the process of hiring those sea

sonal readers, according to
Lim. Shaw said applicants go
through a competitive selec
tion that involves an interview
and case studies.
After being selected, read
ers will go through an on-cam
pus training program with
senior staff to prepare for
the first rush of early appli
cations on Nov. 1.
"We are working really
hard right now to put our
admissions staff in place to
prepare for the reading
cycle," Lim said. "We antici
pate [a high number of appli
cants], but we never know
until it hits."
The increasing number of
applicants over the past sever
al years has been a "natural
progression," according to
Shaw. He said the numbers
have risen as Stanford has
appeared more frequently in
the news for accomplishments
in both the domains of aca
demics and athletics.
Alumni interviews program
expanding
As the office works to deal
with an increasing application
pool, it is also expanding its
alumni interview program.
After a three-year pilot period
concluded in 2011, a Faculty
Senate committee voted to
make the program a perma
nent part of the University.
"Our long-term goal is to
have a robust, worldwide
interview program," Lim said.
"We realize it's going to take
steps to get there."
Last year, students were
granted an interview option if
they had high school zip codes in
Atlanta, Denver, New York
City, Philadelphia, Raleigh-
Durham or Washington, D.C.;
attended school in the states of
Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Oregon or Virginia;
or studied internationally in
Ireland or the United Kingdom.
This year, the program will
expand to metropolitan
Chicago and the entire state
of Colorado, bringing the
number of interviewing
regions up to 14, according
to Shaw.
Shaw said the key to sus
taining the program would
be establishing a strong soft
ware infrastructure before
accelerating the expansion of
the program.
The University gave the
Office of Admissions a one
time injection of $200,000 in
order to implement a new

"constituent management
system," according to the
2012-13 University budget.
The budget states that this
new system will "integrate
data from Stanford's alumni
database and provide an
alumni online portal in sup
port of the expansion of the
alumni network interview
program."
The goal is to make an
alumni interview an option
for all applicants, including
international applicants, in
five years, according to the
budget plan.
Smith will head up this
charge as a new associate
dean. As part of the
Outreach Volunteer Alumni
Link (OVAL), Smith is
tasked with mobilizing
Stanford alumni to share
their experiences with
prospective students.
She also holds alumni
workshops to help train
interviewers. Just this week,
Smith held an alumni work
shop in London, Lim said.
Travel is likely to become
more common as the inter
view program expands.
Class of 2017
More subtle changes in
the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions have also taken
place this year. For instance,
staff members have met with
University administrators
and faculty to better under
stand the changes that will be
implemented following last
year's Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES).
While admission officers
often do not have time to dis
cuss specific policy changes
with prospective freshmen,
the report helps to reinforce
the University's "student
centered learning model,"
according to Lim.
Despite all of these opera
tional changes, Shaw said the
admissions cycle should con
tinue as normal this year.
"It's what we do every
year this is our business,"
Shaw said. "Every year, we
are selecting a class and hope
fully presenting them every
September at Convocation.
There's a lot involved, and
right now, all the staff
involved in this operation are
out on the road, looking for
the Class of 2017."
