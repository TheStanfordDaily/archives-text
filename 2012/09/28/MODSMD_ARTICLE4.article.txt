# Admissions expanding to meet rising demand
## 10 new part-time readers to be hired this admissions cycle

making significant expansions to its staff this year in order
to keep pace with growing interest from prospective stu

Ten new part-time reader positions will be added this
admissions cycle, bringing the number of individuals
responsible for assessing applications up to 64. Training for
these new readers starts at the end of October, in prepara

quarters of Stanford admissions, this fall.
Bob Patterson stepped down from his post as
Stanford's director of admissions last June to become the

The office is also preparing for an expansion of its
alumni interview program, which was approved by a
Faculty Senate committee in April 2011. This year will be
focused on building up the technological infrastructure to
support what will eventually become a worldwide pro

Sonya Smith, who had previously worked in the office,
