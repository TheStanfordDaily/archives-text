# TABLES TURNED
## No.8 Stanford fails road test, loses 17-13 to Washington 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the Cardinal once again found
itself in a stunning upset for the second
straight game. Except this time, it got the
wrong end of the stick.
Washington (3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) gave No. 8
Stanford (3-1,1-1) its first road test of the sea
son, and the Cardinal convincingly failed,
falling to the Huskies 17-13. The loss snapped
Stanford's four-game winning streak against
its Pac-12 North foe.
The Cardinal offense, which converted just
five of its 18 third downs, was frustratingly
inefficient and never found a steady rhythm
throughout the game. In fact, it was kept out of

the end zone entirely by a stout Huskies
defense.
Redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes
had a dismal performance as he completed 18
of 37 for 170 yards and tossed the game-end
ing interception. In front of a raucous crowd at
Century Link field, Nunes at times either over
threw his targets by 10 yards or failed to put
enough zip on the ball on short passes.
Stanford's running game was also ineffec
tive for much of the night. After trampling the
Huskies last season for 446 yards, the Cardinal
couldn't even pound out 100 yards on the
ground. Dependable halfback Stepfan Taylor
rushed for 75 hard-earned yards, but only
averaged a meager 3.1 yards per carry. But the
senior captain shouldn't be blamed for the

team's woes on offense, considering that the
Washington defensive line found its way into
the backfield on numerous occasions.
"We didn't play well enough to win," head
coach David Shaw told ESPN. "We didn't
make the throws we needed to make. We did
n't make the catches we needed to make. We
didn't sustain our blocks in the running game
as long as we should have. We got outplayed
tonight."
After going three-and-out on the first drive
of the game, Stanford capitalized off a 24-yard
reception by tight end Zach Ertz when place
kicker Jordan Williamson drove a 31-yard
field goal through the uprights.

Redshirt junior defensive end Ben Gardner (49) and the rest of Stanford's defensive line pressured Washington quarterback Keith Price
all night long. But the Huskies found a few holes, sprang the upset and left the Card walking off the field with a bad taste in his mouth.
The Stanford front seven
pummeled Huskies quarter
back Keith Price for most of
the first half and gave up just
one field goal. Linebackers
Chase Thomas and James
Vaughters led the pressure
early on as they both record
ed a sack during the first two
quarters.
The Cardinal managed to
tack on another field goal and
take a 6-3 lead when Nunes
orchestrated a 54-yard drive
the longest drive of the
game for Stanford late in

the second quarter. Despite
heading into the locker room
with a three-point lead, the
Cardinal had yet to show any
signs of life on offense as it
mustered only 131 yards and
punted five times on just as
many three-and-outs.
Things didn't get any bet
ter in the second half
Nunes remained inaccu
rate while Taylor and the
offensive line could not wear
down the Huskies defense as
they were able to do so
effectively against USC.
Even when the offense man
aged to convert a couple first
downs, it would somehow
find away to stall some
where near midfield and
punt the ball to the Huskies

once again. At one point,
backup quarterback Brett
Nottingham had his helmet
on and was tossing balls on
the sideline.
In a game that proved to
be a defensive struggle, it was
the Cardinal defense that
made the first breakthrough
when outside linebacker
Trent Murphy jumped on a
short pass from Price for a
pick-six.
But Stanford's 13-3 lead
was short-lived. On
Washington's very next drive,
running back Bishop Sankey,
who finished the game with
144 yards on 20 carries, darted
past a couple would-be tack
lers on fourth-and-1 for a 61-
yard touchdown.

The Huskies' offensive
explosion didn't stop there, as
star wideout Kasen William
caught a screen pass from
Price and took it for a 35-yard
touchdown midway through
the fourth quarter. Suddenly
down 17-13, the Cardinal
found itself in unfamiliar ter
ritory, trailing for the first
time all night.
Nunes had one last chance
to engineer a game-winning
drive when the Cardinal got
ball back at its own 32-yard
line with 4:53 left in the game.
But after not being able to
methodically move the ball
for the majority of the game,
the Stanford offense failed to

deliver yet again on its last
stand.
After driving to the
Washington 40, Murphy's
Law took over. A delay of
game penalty on first down
pushed Stanford back five
yards. Sophomore Ty
Montgomery dropped a well
thrown ball from Nunes in
what could've been the go
ahead touchdown, which
summed up Stanford's offen
sive performance for the
night. And when cornerback
Desmond Trufant intercepted
Nunes' fourth-down pass
intended for Levine Toilolo
to end the game, Stanford's
fate was sealed.
Although the Cardinal
might very well have lost the
game because of one missed
tackle, it will need to quickly
recuperate from its first loss
of the season with Arizona
paying a visit to the Farm next
Saturday.

Redshirt junior defensive end Ben Gardner (49) and the rest of Stanford's defensive line pressured Washington quarterback Keith Price
all night long. But the Huskies found a few holes, sprang the upset and left the Card walking off the field with a bad taste in his mouth.
The Stanford front seven
pummeled Huskies quarter
back Keith Price for most of
the first half and gave up just
one field goal. Linebackers
Chase Thomas and James
Vaughters led the pressure
early on as they both record
ed a sack during the first two
quarters.
The Cardinal managed to
tack on another field goal and
take a 6-3 lead when Nunes
orchestrated a 54-yard drive
the longest drive of the
game for Stanford late in

the second quarter. Despite
heading into the locker room
with a three-point lead, the
Cardinal had yet to show any
signs of life on offense as it
mustered only 131 yards and
punted five times on just as
many three-and-outs.
Things didn't get any bet
ter in the second half
Nunes remained inaccu
rate while Taylor and the
offensive line could not wear
down the Huskies defense as
they were able to do so
effectively against USC.
Even when the offense man
aged to convert a couple first
downs, it would somehow
find away to stall some
where near midfield and
punt the ball to the Huskies

once again. At one point,
backup quarterback Brett
Nottingham had his helmet
on and was tossing balls on
the sideline.
In a game that proved to
be a defensive struggle, it was
the Cardinal defense that
made the first breakthrough
when outside linebacker
Trent Murphy jumped on a
short pass from Price for a
pick-six.
But Stanford's 13-3 lead
was short-lived. On
Washington's very next drive,
running back Bishop Sankey,
who finished the game with
144 yards on 20 carries, darted
past a couple would-be tack
lers on fourth-and-1 for a 61-
yard touchdown.

The Huskies' offensive
explosion didn't stop there, as
star wideout Kasen William
caught a screen pass from
Price and took it for a 35-yard
touchdown midway through
the fourth quarter. Suddenly
down 17-13, the Cardinal
found itself in unfamiliar ter
ritory, trailing for the first
time all night.
Nunes had one last chance
to engineer a game-winning
drive when the Cardinal got
ball back at its own 32-yard
line with 4:53 left in the game.
But after not being able to
methodically move the ball
for the majority of the game,
the Stanford offense failed to

deliver yet again on its last
stand.
After driving to the
Washington 40, Murphy's
Law took over. A delay of
game penalty on first down
pushed Stanford back five
yards. Sophomore Ty
Montgomery dropped a well
thrown ball from Nunes in
what could've been the go
ahead touchdown, which
summed up Stanford's offen
sive performance for the
night. And when cornerback
Desmond Trufant intercepted
Nunes' fourth-down pass
intended for Levine Toilolo
to end the game, Stanford's
fate was sealed.
Although the Cardinal
might very well have lost the
game because of one missed
tackle, it will need to quickly
recuperate from its first loss
of the season with Arizona
paying a visit to the Farm next
Saturday.

Quarterback Josh Nunes (6) started his first career game on the road, but couldn't find a
rhythm throwing the ball and finished 18-37 for 170 yards in Stanford's 1 7-13 loss.
Last night, the Cardinal once again found
itself in a stunning upset for the second
straight game. Except this time, it got the
wrong end of the stick.
Washington (3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) gave No. 8
Stanford (3-1,1-1) its first road test of the sea
son, and the Cardinal convincingly failed,
falling to the Huskies 17-13. The loss snapped
Stanford's four-game winning streak against
its Pac-12 North foe.
The Cardinal offense, which converted just
five of its 18 third downs, was frustratingly
inefficient and never found a steady rhythm
throughout the game. In fact, it was kept out of

the end zone entirely by a stout Huskies
defense.
Redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes
had a dismal performance as he completed 18
of 37 for 170 yards and tossed the game-end
ing interception. In front of a raucous crowd at
Century Link field, Nunes at times either over
threw his targets by 10 yards or failed to put
enough zip on the ball on short passes.
Stanford's running game was also ineffec
tive for much of the night. After trampling the
Huskies last season for 446 yards, the Cardinal
couldn't even pound out 100 yards on the
ground. Dependable halfback Stepfan Taylor
rushed for 75 hard-earned yards, but only
averaged a meager 3.1 yards per carry. But the
senior captain shouldn't be blamed for the

team's woes on offense, considering that the
Washington defensive line found its way into
the backfield on numerous occasions.
"We didn't play well enough to win," head
coach David Shaw told ESPN. "We didn't
make the throws we needed to make. We did
n't make the catches we needed to make. We
didn't sustain our blocks in the running game
as long as we should have. We got outplayed
tonight."
