## No.8 Stanford fails road test, loses 17-13 to Washington 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the Cardinal once again found
itself in a stunning upset for the second
straight game. Except this time, it got the
wrong end of the stick.
Washington (3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) gave No. 8
Stanford (3-1,1-1) its first road test of the sea
son, and the Cardinal convincingly failed,
falling to the Huskies 17-13. The loss snapped
Stanford's four-game winning streak against
its Pac-12 North foe.
The Cardinal offense, which converted just
five of its 18 third downs, was frustratingly
inefficient and never found a steady rhythm
throughout the game. In fact, it was kept out of

the end zone entirely by a stout Huskies
defense.
Redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes
had a dismal performance as he completed 18
of 37 for 170 yards and tossed the game-end
ing interception. In front of a raucous crowd at
Century Link field, Nunes at times either over
threw his targets by 10 yards or failed to put
enough zip on the ball on short passes.
Stanford's running game was also ineffec
tive for much of the night. After trampling the
Huskies last season for 446 yards, the Cardinal
couldn't even pound out 100 yards on the
ground. Dependable halfback Stepfan Taylor
rushed for 75 hard-earned yards, but only
averaged a meager 3.1 yards per carry. But the
senior captain shouldn't be blamed for the

team's woes on offense, considering that the
Washington defensive line found its way into
the backfield on numerous occasions.
"We didn't play well enough to win," head
coach David Shaw told ESPN. "We didn't
make the throws we needed to make. We did
n't make the catches we needed to make. We
didn't sustain our blocks in the running game
as long as we should have. We got outplayed
tonight."
After going three-and-out on the first drive
of the game, Stanford capitalized off a 24-yard
reception by tight end Zach Ertz when place
kicker Jordan Williamson drove a 31-yard
field goal through the uprights.

Redshirt junior defensive end Ben Gardner (49) and the rest of Stanford's defensive line pressured Washington quarterback Keith Price
all night long. But the Huskies found a few holes, sprang the upset and left the Card walking off the field with a bad taste in his mouth.
