## App tracks time use via smartphones 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
Chronos, the time-tracking application created
by Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB)
alumni Charlie Kubal MBA 'l2 and Dylan Keil
'OB MBA 'l2, officially launched at Tech Crunch's
Disrupt conference in mid-September. The appli
cation aims to monitor and create a record of how
its users spend their time to inform their decisions
about altering or improving certain lifestyle
habits. The application takes advantage of the
built-in capabilities of the iPhone such as the
accelerometer and compass and pairs them
with the user's location information to passively
track the user.
The impetus behind the application is that
people often are not fully aware of how they use
their time, and that the simple analytics that the
application offers can allow them to make better
decisions about how they use their time and
improve their time management. The application
allows users to set targets for goals such as sleep,
socializing, exercise or work.
The Chronos founders argue that the appli
cation allows users to "live more intentionally"
but saves them the trouble of inputting informa
tion to the application each time they engage in
an activity. Dylan Keil, in his launch presenta
tion, said that very few means exist to get insight
into how people spend their days, likening the
problem to trying to "[manage] your weight
without the scale." As the metaphorical scale,
the application is constantly running in the back
ground compiling its best estimates of the user's
activities.
The founders, whose combined resumes
include Google, Pandora and stints in manage
ment consulting, were propelled by a GSB class
about creating startups.
"I came to the business school with the inten
tion of actually starting a business, and so did
Dylan," Kubal said. "We both had ideas about

ways to bridge real life with virtual life, and that's
how the idea for Chronos came about."
The pair formalized the idea in November of
last year and began coding in earnest in January.
They then started full time on the venture after
graduating and applied for Tech Crunch's
"Startup Battlefield;" over 1,000 startups
applied for the competition and only 30 were
accepted.
"We were actually the only bootstrapped start
up [a startup operating without outside invest
ment] who made it to the final round," Kubal said.
Their aim had been to launch in October, but
their acceptance forced them to field an entirely
finished product at the conference, which meant a
lot of 14-to-16-hour days for the two entrepre
neurs.
Discussing how the application could be of
benefit to Stanford students in particular, Kubal
conceded that a closed system such as a universi
ty where different social functions are often done
at the same location a student will probably
both work and socialize in their rooms could
pose problems for the application and would per
haps require more manual inputs on the applica
tion.
"More tinkering is necessary for these sort of
communities," Kubal said. "But once you start to

input more information, a hierarchy of probabili
ty emerges where the application can take a rea
sonable guess as to where you are and what you're
doing."
On the topic of privacy, an obvious concern for
an application designed to catalog every moment
of your life, Kubal said much of the information
the device complies is saved on the device itself,
but, to expedite processing, information is also
sent to Chronos' servers.
"Because of the ultimate sensitivity of the
data, you have the ability to choose exactly who
sees this information," Kubal said. "This isn't
meant for broad swathes of your friends."
However, users are able to use the application
to share certain benchmarks and information with
select friends via Facebook Connect.
The pair hopes to expand their concept and
create more ways to encourage users' goals. They
plan to monetize the concept with targeted lead
ins, recommendations tailored for their users for
which they charge a premium from the vendors.
An Android version is slated for release in the
near future, and Kubal and Keil are now begin
ning to court investors and plan for the next itera
tion of the product.
