# STUDENT LIFE
## Alcohol-free programming increased 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Cardinal Nights, the Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) effort to provide and
promote alcohol-free social events, is entering its
sophomore year with an eye toward increasing
programming and student outreach.
The initiative's mission is "to shift the campus
culture away from a focus on alcohol by provid
ing premium, equally attractive, non-alcoholic
social programming," and notably brought per
formers Macklemore and Modest Mouse to
campus last year.
According to Angelina Car dona 'll, OAPE
assistant director and community engagement
coordinator, other popular events from last year
included those that took place off-campus, such
as the trips to see Cirque du Soleil in San
Francisco, play laser tag or go to Great America.
"We learned that students really love to get
off campus and explore the Bay Area," said
Cardona. "This year there is certainly going to
be more programming that takes students off
the Farm."
Last year, Cardinal Nights sponsored a total
of 51 events, with a total of 15,646 students

attending.
"We were very excited with what we were
able to accomplish last year," said Ralph Castro,
associate dean of student affairs and director of
OAPE, in an email to The Daily. "We partnered
with many student groups and residences to
expand fun social offering that de-emphasized
alcohol in away that had never been done
before at Stanford."
Cardinal Nights has already sponsored a few
events this school year, including the We The
Kings concert that took place during New
Student Orientation (NSO) and the Sept. 24
Welcome Home Carnival on FloMo Field, which
featured hot air balloons and carnival games and
drew over 1,200 student attendees.
"[The event] looked very well put together,
lively and colorful, and all of the activities and
food trucks were amazing," said Jen Kuang 'l3 "It
was probably one of the coolest things I've ever
seen Stanford put on."
Other events planned for this year include a
trip to see the "Lion King" musical in San
Francisco, a nighttime tour of Alcatraz and anoth
er show in Frost Amphitheater. Fall quarter will
also feature weekly Friday night movie showings
that will alternate locations between Wilbur and

FloMo fields.
"We'll be showing movies that were recently
in theaters," Cardona said, mentioning "The Dark
Knight Rises" as an example.
In addition to a focus on more regular and
off-campus events, the Cardinal Nights team will
also be spending this year developing their
advertising and outreach program. When speak
ing with The Daily, both Cardona and Castro
referenced instances in which students had not
heard about various Cardinal Nights until after
the event had occurred.
"We are hoping to expand our listserv and
get more followers on Facebook and Twitter to
maximize our outreach," Castro said.
Cardona said she is currently researching and
working on ways to improve communication
between the Cardinal Nights team and the stu
dent body.
"Many people have told me that the initia
tive has given them a space where they finally
feel like they belong socially at Stanford,"
Cardona said. "At the end of the day we are
working to create events where students feel
welcome, included, safe and have a blast!"
