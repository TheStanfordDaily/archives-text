One fatal quarter against host UC-Santa
Barbara was all it took to keep Stanford from
the winner's bracket and a chance at defending
their title at the SoCal Tournament. Instead,
Stanford finished 3-1 on the weekend and took
fifth place overall.
No. 3 Stanford (6-2) had beaten No. 6 UCSB
two weeks ago by a score of 8-7, using a 1-0
fourth quarter to seal the game. This time
around the Cardinal had an 8-6 advantage
going into the final period, but they gave up six
goals in the quarter and lost by a final score of
12-9.

"They're definitely better than in years past,
so they'll be tough competition no matter
where we play them," said redshirt senior driv
er Alex Avery, who finished the tournament
with four goals.
The win for No. 1 USC gave them a clean
sweep of the major early-season tournaments,
and keeps the defending NCAA champions
undefeated on the season.
Stanford won its opening match 13-6 against
Princeton before losing to Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal then went on to defeat No. 7
Pepperdine 13-8, as well as No. 8 Pacific 9-5.
Stanford outscored it's opponents 44-31 on
the weekend behind 11 goals from sophomore
utility Alex Bowen â€”an All-American last
year nine from freshman driver Brett
Bonanni, and eight from redshirt junior 2-
meter Forrest Watkins.
It was the second weekend tournament in a
row in which Bowen has scored 11 goals, and
his 2.75 goals per game average was eighth
among Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
players coming into this weekend.
Bonanni kept his place as the second lead
ing scorer for Stanford, proving again that he
will be a pivotal cog in the Stanford offense.
The big-time scoring from Watkins, which
included a five-goal game against Pepperdine,
is also a good sign for the Cardinal. Watkins
trailed only Bowen in total goals last year, but
he had started off the year a bit sluggish, only
netting five before this weekend.

Against the Gauchos, the Cardinal had
more major fouls when a player is called for
his third ejection and cannot return to the game
"than it did goals in the fourth quarter. Their
four majors left Stanford without key players,
and it also forced them to play certain lineups
that were unused to playing together.
While the loss seemed like a real upset at
the time, this tournament ended up being
somewhat of a coming-out party for UCSB.The
Gauchos pulled off another win against No. 2
UCLA in the semifinals before falling to USC
in the final.
