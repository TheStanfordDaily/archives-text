# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Desert is a breeze for Stanford 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Seven straight wins is usually enough to put
even the best teams on the brink of over-confi
dence. The Stanford women's volleyball team,
however, was focused on one thing going into
conference matchups against Arizona and
Arizona State: a hunger to keep winning. Two
road wins later, and the Cardinal remains unde
feated in conference play and riding high at the
top of the Pac-12.
Arizona (9-6,1-3 Pac-12) was first on the to
do list for the No. 7 Cardinal (12-2,4-0 Pac-12),
who needed a solid performance from its group
of freshman contributors. Instead, it was
Arizona who jumped out to an early 6-2 lead on
a pair of kills by sophomore Rachel Rhoades to
go along with three from fellow sophomore
Madi Kingdon.

The two squads traded a few points, before
the Card was able to capitalize on a couple of
Wildcat errors to tie the set at 11 a piece. From
that point on, Stanford gained control, gradual
ly pulling out to a 23-18 lead after a block by
freshman Inky Ajanaku.
Nonetheless, Arizona Rhoades in partic
ularâ€” was not going to lie down. Rhoades
picked up a pair of kills to pull within three
points, forcing Stanford coach John Dunning to
call a timeout. Whatever he said to the team cer
tainly carried found its mark, as the Card scored
two easy points to grab a 25-20 first set win.
Arizona would respond in the second set,
refusing to give in to the higher-ranked
Stanford team. However, it would be Stanford,
not Arizona, that would be the Card's downfall
in the second set. This became obvious after
Stanford followed an excellent set-tying
Brittany Howard kill with three straight errors.
This would prove to be the story of the set,
as Stanford went on to commit nine errors. Still,
the Card maneuvered into striking position
after a Carly Wopat block pulled Stanford to
within two points of Arizona (23-21). But the
early miscues proved to be too much to over
come, as a Taylor Arizobal kill gave the Wildcats
