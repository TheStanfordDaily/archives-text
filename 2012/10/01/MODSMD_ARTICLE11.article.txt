# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Desert is a breeze for Stanford 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Seven straight wins is usually enough to put
even the best teams on the brink of over-confi
dence. The Stanford women's volleyball team,
however, was focused on one thing going into
conference matchups against Arizona and
Arizona State: a hunger to keep winning. Two
road wins later, and the Cardinal remains unde
feated in conference play and riding high at the
top of the Pac-12.
Arizona (9-6,1-3 Pac-12) was first on the to
do list for the No. 7 Cardinal (12-2,4-0 Pac-12),
who needed a solid performance from its group
of freshman contributors. Instead, it was
Arizona who jumped out to an early 6-2 lead on
a pair of kills by sophomore Rachel Rhoades to
go along with three from fellow sophomore
Madi Kingdon.

The two squads traded a few points, before
the Card was able to capitalize on a couple of
Wildcat errors to tie the set at 11 a piece. From
that point on, Stanford gained control, gradual
ly pulling out to a 23-18 lead after a block by
freshman Inky Ajanaku.
Nonetheless, Arizona Rhoades in partic
ularâ€” was not going to lie down. Rhoades
picked up a pair of kills to pull within three
points, forcing Stanford coach John Dunning to
call a timeout. Whatever he said to the team cer
tainly carried found its mark, as the Card scored
two easy points to grab a 25-20 first set win.
Arizona would respond in the second set,
refusing to give in to the higher-ranked
Stanford team. However, it would be Stanford,
not Arizona, that would be the Card's downfall
in the second set. This became obvious after
Stanford followed an excellent set-tying
Brittany Howard kill with three straight errors.
This would prove to be the story of the set,
as Stanford went on to commit nine errors. Still,
the Card maneuvered into striking position
after a Carly Wopat block pulled Stanford to
within two points of Arizona (23-21). But the
early miscues proved to be too much to over
come, as a Taylor Arizobal kill gave the Wildcats

the 25-22 win, evening the
match at one set each.

That loss was enough of a
wakeup call for Stanford, as
they picked up the intensity
in the third and fourth sets.
Veterans Wopat, Lydia Bai,
Rachel Williams and Karissa
Cook helped set the tone for
the Cardinal, letting their
experience dictate the tone
of the match.
After the Wildcats
jumped out to a 20-19 lead on
a Jordan Burgess service ace,
Bai countered with a couple
of kills to put Stanford back
on top. Wopat closed out the
set with a kill of her own a
few points later, giving
Stanford a 25-22 victory.
The Card got it going
early in the fourth set, scoring
three straight points. The vet
eran presence would prove
important once more, as
Wopat, Bai, and Williams
smothered Arizona at the net
en route to a match-clinching
25-18 victory for Stanford.

While the freshmen have
stolen most of the headlines
for the last couple of weeks,
last year's stalwarts were able
to propel Stanford to victory
in this contest. Wopat led the
way, accruing a total of 15
kills.

After the victory, the
Cardinal traveled to Tempe
to take on Arizona State (13-
4, 2-2 Pac-12). It became
clear early on that this con
test was going to be a battle.
The Sun Devils stayed with
Stanford for the entire set,
jumping out to a 25-24 lead,
just a point away from a first
set victory, on an Ajanaku
error. Wopat and Morgan
Boukather bailed her out
with a block on the next
point. Stanford went on to
win the first set by a score of
29-27.
The momentum contin
ued to roll for the Card, as
they outplayed the Sun
Devils by a wide margin in
the second set. Arizona State
had 11 errors, as Stanford
went on to win 25-17.
However, despite the early
hole, the Sun Devils were not
ready to concede to the Card.
They roared back in the third

set, claiming a 28-26 win after
kills from Macey Gardner
and Erica Wilson.

Eager to return to the
farm with a pair of confer
ence wins and a nine-game
winning streak under their
belts, Stanford turned it on in
the fourth set. They closed
out the set and match with a
25-23 victory, moving to 4-0
in Pac-12 play.
Burgess, Cook and Madi
Bugg stood out in a very solid
Stanford performance. Burgess
continued to impress, record
ing 10 kills along with 15 digs.
She has been phenomenal
both offensively and defen
sively. Cook and Bugg both
managed to spread the ball
around, setting up the play
makers at the net. The two
setters split time, producing
at a nearly identical mark.
Bugg slightly edged Cook,
recording 26 kills to her
teammate's 23.
The Card takes on Oregon
and Oregon State next week
end at Maples Pavilion, look
ing to extend their winning
streak to 11 games.
