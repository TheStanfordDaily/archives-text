## I DO CHOOSE TO RUN Fire in a Crowded World? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Nearly three weeks after the
Sept. 11 attack on the
American consulate in
Benghazi, Libya that left
Ambassador J. Christopher
Stevens and three members of his
staff dead, the debate continues:
Who should be held ethically
responsible, and how?
One line of accusation favors
condemning Nakoula Basseley.
Nakoula, whose pseudonym is Sam
Bacile, is the filmmaker thought to
be the mastermind behind
"Innocence of Muslims," the film
that set off protests across the
Islamic world and may have helped
to trigger the deadly assault in
Benghazi. According to this line of
thought, Nakoula and his fellow
filmmakers knew that their actions
would cause harm to U.S. person
nel overseas. They had no right to
engage in hate speech that
defamed Islam and Muslims, and
are therefore the chief villains in
this still-unfolding story.
Some pundits and commenta
tors have even argued that
Nakoula and Florida pastor Terry
Jones, who helped promote the
video, should be subjected to legal
prosecution.
"It is not clear to me why Sam
Bacile and Terry Jones are not
being prosecuted for engaging in
hate speech," explained one repre
sentative commenter on The New
York Times website. "It is one thing
to criticize, something totally differ
ent to incite. This film is almost the
literal equivalent of shouting fire in
a crowded movie theater."
"Sam Bacile and Terry Jones
have shouted fire in a crowded the
ater," explained another anony
mous commenter, garnering 1,371
"likes." "That crowded theater is
the 7 billion person world we live
in, connected via the Internet. At
the very least, a lawsuit against
them should be allowed to pro
ceed."
Anthea Butler, a professor of
religion at the University of
Pennsylvania, went so far as to
opine in USA Today that Nakoula
should be jailed. While free speech
is an important right, Butler
argued, it's not important enough
to justify causing the deaths of U.S.
personnel overseas.
"While the First Amendment
right to free expression is impor
tant," she concluded, "it is also
important to remember that other
countries and cultures do not have
to understand or respect our right."
But while this line of argument
may be emotionally powerful and
superficially convincing, I do not
believe it holds up under closer log
ical scrutiny.
First, this type of argument is
even more insulting to Muslims
than the film it purports to con
demn. By comparing the speech of
Nakoula and Jones to "shouting
fire in a crowded theater," the argu
ment relies on the premise that

Muslims and Arabs always burn
and pillage things whenever Islam
is insulted, like robots programmed
to attack on sight. That premise is
essential to the argument; we can
only morally blame Nakoula if his
words directly cause death, and his
words can only directly cause death
if we assume that Muslims will kill
in response to them.
That is racist and, quite frankly,
false; out of a global population of
more than 1.5 billion Muslims, a very
small and fanatical faction of
extremists participated in the attacks
in Libya. Human adults, including
Muslims, exercise free will and make
choices of their own volition
choices like the decision to attack or
to refrain from attacking. People
aren't automatons, and to argue oth
erwise is insulting and wrong.
Second, to argue that Nakoula
and Jones should be jailed, as
Professor Butler does, holds our
actions hostage to the irrational
whims of extremists everywhere.
Since insulting films offend Islamic
extremists, this argument goes, we
should prosecute those who make
them.
Unfortunately, there are many
things that offend Islamic extrem
ists. Women voting and working
outside the home, say, or teaching
evolution in public schools, or wor
shipping a different God (or many
gods, or none at all). What happens
to those freedoms when we subject
them to Professor Butler's odd
logic? Are they and the people who
exercise them crushed under the
relativist hammer as easily as the
right to free speech seems to be?
A better response to the attacks
in Libya should incorporate three
essential pieces. First, it should rec
ognize that the vast majority of
Muslims worldwide, unlike the
bloodthirsty rioting horde implied
by the "fire in a crowded theater"
analogy, are peaceful, capable of
reasoned argument and respond to
insult with words rather than rock
ets. Second, it should make clear
(as President Obama did) that
Nakoula's insulting and deplorable
film does not represent the senti
ments of the American people any
more than Ambassador Stevens'
killers represent Muslims. And
third, it should make clear that reli
gious tolerance and free speech can
work together, rather than against
one another that the answer to
bad speech is better speech, not
misguided legal prohibitions.
