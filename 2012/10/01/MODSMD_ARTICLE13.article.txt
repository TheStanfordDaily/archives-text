# Do You MIND?
## Do The Twist 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
The best writing advice I've
received came from my creative
nonfiction instructor last fall.
"Twist the screw," she told us.
"Drill into the topic deeper, compli
cate your perspective, switch the
frame."
Twisting is exactly what I intend to
do.
Last week, I wrote about the isola
tion I've felt as a black male in
Stanford's gay community. This week,
I twist a little further in light of a fea
ture I wrote for today's edition exam
ining the experiences of other queer,
black men on campus.
One of the tensions I feel is
between agency and victimization: To
what degree have I internalized a self
fulfilling prophecy (that black men
are at a disadvantage in the gay com
munity) and made myself a passive
victim, and to what degree is the alien
ating experience that I and other stu
dents undergo part of a larger system
that actually is unfair and strictly
unchanging?
I do have to acknowledge my own
agency in complicating my romantic
success.
My own personality and emotions
change a lot when I enter queer
spaces around campus. My sense of
"fight or flight" increases dramatically
when I prepare to enter Terra.
Over the past two years, it —mainly
Happy Hour—has been a place that I
have dreaded to enter and have also
sought out in anticipation (and in vain)
for the greater odds of making a roman
tic connection.
I am shy to make eye contact and
conversation with other black men,
guys to whom I've expressed (unre
quited) interest, male couples and
with non-black queer men whom I do
not already consider "safe" or allies.
I feel the need to counter my sense
of intimidation by appearing overly
satisfied with my state of affairs, over
ly excited to see friends and by being
in our queer communal space.

At the same time, though, it is hard
for me to fully embrace the culture of
a "colorblind" (majority-white) gay
community where I'm supposed to be
happy, carefree and performative.
Two hundred years ago, I would
have been enslaved for the color of
my skin; 100 years ago, I may have
been lynched for the color of my skin
and my perceived threat to white soci
ety as a grown male; today, I may be
beaten or killed by fellow citizens or
law enforcement and I am just a step
removed from the cycle of mass incar
ceration that ravages the black male
community.

And so it is hard for me to step out
of this racial and gender context into a
culture that feels so different from the
one in which I grew up.
My refuge at Happy Hour tends to
be close friends, queer women and
straight allies. I am able to let down
my defenses a little more, smile, laugh
and interact a little more naturally.
This is generally my experience
interacting with queer women versus
queer men. Because there are so few
of us relative to the overall popula
tion, every guy I encounter is some
one whom I could potentially date.
So in an effort not to appear too
eager or desperate to people I find
intriguing, or for fear of sending non
existent signals of romantic interest to
people unintentionally, I become a lit
tle more tense, terse, polite, formal. I
vacillate between being too shy and
too forward.
I wish I could feel as comfortable
being flirtatious with men as I do with
women. Probably because there is
nothing at stake, I find it easier to
make steadier and more nuanced eye
contact and use a wittier sense of
humor to be more playful overall.
So, while claiming my own agency,
one charge I can make against society
at large is the lack of queer black men
I see in relationships either with
other black men or in mixed-race cou
ples.

In my time at Stanford, and within
our openly queer undergraduate
community, I have not seen queer
black men date either amongst
ourselves or in a mixed-race couple.
I've seen every other combination
all-white, non-white, white and Latino,
white and Asian —but never two
black men, nor a black male student
with someone who is not black.

For the past two years, I assumed
that I could not be in a happy relation
ship given that I had no visual models
of queer black men in relationships.
This year, I declare to myself that
stopping there would be too easy.
With these articles as public "testa
ments to my trials and tribulations, I
aim to hold myself accountable both
as I guard against internalizing racism
and as I grow to feel confident during
the remainder of my time at Stanford
and beyond.
I don't doubt that I'll find some
one who can match my passion, intel
lect and maturity—I just will not wed
myself to the hope and belief that I
will meet that person during my time
on campus.
I recognize that I am not mono
lithic that I am not just a black per
son, and that there's a difference
between my consciousness as a black
person and the consciousness that has
developed as a result of my individual
experiences.
And so it is coming from the per
spective of my, and others', personal
experiences that I hope my testi
monies will resonate with all who read
them: that we consider how our
actions and desires both implicit
and explicit might be limiting and
how our actions might make others
feel undesirable or invisible: and that
we consider how we might do more to
make the struggles of our fellow
humans a little less rough.
I also hope specifically that other
young, black, brown, queer people can
overcome the shackles of racism that
have bound our hearts, minds and
bodies so far.

So in an effort not to appear too
eager or desperate to people I find
intriguing, or for fear of sending non
existent signals of romantic interest to
people unintentionally, I become a lit
tle more tense, terse, polite, formal. I
vacillate between being too shy and
too forward.
I wish I could feel as comfortable
being flirtatious with men as I do with
women. Probably because there is
nothing at stake, I find it easier to
make steadier and more nuanced eye
contact and use a wittier sense of
humor to be more playful overall.
So, while claiming my own agency,
one charge I can make against society
at large is the lack of queer black men
I see in relationships either with
other black men or in mixed-race cou
ples.

In my time at Stanford, and within
our openly queer undergraduate
community, I have not seen queer
black men date either amongst
ourselves or in a mixed-race couple.
I've seen every other combination
all-white, non-white, white and Latino,
white and Asian —but never two
black men, nor a black male student
with someone who is not black.

For the past two years, I assumed
that I could not be in a happy relation
ship given that I had no visual models
of queer black men in relationships.
This year, I declare to myself that
stopping there would be too easy.
With these articles as public "testa
ments to my trials and tribulations, I
aim to hold myself accountable both
as I guard against internalizing racism
and as I grow to feel confident during
the remainder of my time at Stanford
and beyond.
I don't doubt that I'll find some
one who can match my passion, intel
lect and maturity—I just will not wed
myself to the hope and belief that I
will meet that person during my time
on campus.
I recognize that I am not mono
lithic that I am not just a black per
son, and that there's a difference
between my consciousness as a black
person and the consciousness that has
developed as a result of my individual
experiences.
And so it is coming from the per
spective of my, and others', personal
experiences that I hope my testi
monies will resonate with all who read
them: that we consider how our
actions and desires both implicit
and explicit might be limiting and
how our actions might make others
feel undesirable or invisible: and that
we consider how we might do more to
make the struggles of our fellow
humans a little less rough.
I also hope specifically that other
young, black, brown, queer people can
overcome the shackles of racism that
have bound our hearts, minds and
bodies so far.

Its hard for me
to embrace the
culture of
colorblind'
The best writing advice I've
received came from my creative
nonfiction instructor last fall.
"Twist the screw," she told us.
"Drill into the topic deeper, compli
cate your perspective, switch the
frame."
Twisting is exactly what I intend to
do.
Last week, I wrote about the isola
tion I've felt as a black male in
Stanford's gay community. This week,
I twist a little further in light of a fea
ture I wrote for today's edition exam
ining the experiences of other queer,
black men on campus.
One of the tensions I feel is
between agency and victimization: To
what degree have I internalized a self
fulfilling prophecy (that black men
are at a disadvantage in the gay com
munity) and made myself a passive
victim, and to what degree is the alien
ating experience that I and other stu
dents undergo part of a larger system
that actually is unfair and strictly
unchanging?
I do have to acknowledge my own
agency in complicating my romantic
success.
My own personality and emotions
change a lot when I enter queer
spaces around campus. My sense of
"fight or flight" increases dramatically
when I prepare to enter Terra.
Over the past two years, it —mainly
Happy Hour—has been a place that I
have dreaded to enter and have also
sought out in anticipation (and in vain)
for the greater odds of making a roman
tic connection.
I am shy to make eye contact and
conversation with other black men,
guys to whom I've expressed (unre
quited) interest, male couples and
with non-black queer men whom I do
not already consider "safe" or allies.
I feel the need to counter my sense
of intimidation by appearing overly
satisfied with my state of affairs, over
ly excited to see friends and by being
in our queer communal space.

At the same time, though, it is hard
for me to fully embrace the culture of
a "colorblind" (majority-white) gay
community where I'm supposed to be
happy, carefree and performative.
Two hundred years ago, I would
have been enslaved for the color of
my skin; 100 years ago, I may have
been lynched for the color of my skin
and my perceived threat to white soci
ety as a grown male; today, I may be
beaten or killed by fellow citizens or
law enforcement and I am just a step
removed from the cycle of mass incar
ceration that ravages the black male
community.

And so it is hard for me to step out
of this racial and gender context into a
culture that feels so different from the
one in which I grew up.
My refuge at Happy Hour tends to
be close friends, queer women and
straight allies. I am able to let down
my defenses a little more, smile, laugh
and interact a little more naturally.
This is generally my experience
interacting with queer women versus
queer men. Because there are so few
of us relative to the overall popula
tion, every guy I encounter is some
one whom I could potentially date.
So in an effort not to appear too
eager or desperate to people I find
intriguing, or for fear of sending non
existent signals of romantic interest to
