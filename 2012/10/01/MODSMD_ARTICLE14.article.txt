# MEN'S GOLF
## Card tees off at Olympia STANFORD SITS IN NINTH PLACE 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
A stone's throw away from Medinah
Country Club and the 2012 Ryder Cup, the
No. 10 Stanford men's golf team kicked off its
season at the Olympia Field Country Club
with an opening round 297 (17 over par),
trailing leader Arkansas by 14 strokes with
two days left in the prestigious Olympia
Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational tournament.
As the roars from Europe's furious after
noon comeback to win the Ryder Cup began
to ramp up, sophomore Patrick Rodgers â€”
the defending individual champion turned
in the team's lowest round with a 72 (2 over
par) that put him in ninth place after a costly
double bogey on the par-417th hole. He trails
North western's Nicholas Losole by 4 strokes.

Teammates Andre DeDecker and David
Boote are both tied for 20th with rounds of
73, as the freshman Boote tasted collegiate
competition for the first time and the redshirt
junior Dedecker put together one of the best
rounds of his college career.
With junior Cameron Wilson a main
stay in last year's lineup and individual quali
fier for the 2012 U.S. Open not playing in
Illinois, senior Steve Kearney and junior
Shane Lebow shared 60th place for Stanford,
both shooting rounds of 79.

Lebow was set back by two double bogeys
on his card, and Kearney was consistent but
had nine bogeys to finish at 9 over par after
the first round.

The No. 12 Razorbacks put together a
complete team performance, as the worst of
its four scoring members shot a 72 and is tied
with Rodgers for ninth place overall.
The teams all got a nice boost on Saturday,
taking in the afternoon matches of the Ryder
Cup after completing practice rounds at
Olympia Fields.

The strength of the field at the event, and
the quality of the venue, is illustrated in the
list of past individual champions, which
includes PGA Tour players Rickie Fowler
(2007) and Flarris English (2009) and former
U.S. Amatuer champion Peter Uihlein (2010).
Second round play continues today from
the South Course, with the final round of play
set for Tuesday.
