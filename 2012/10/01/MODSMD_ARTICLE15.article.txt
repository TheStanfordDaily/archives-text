## Top 5 TV Babies 
### 
At the Emmy Awards ceremony last week, Aziz Ansari, fun
nyman of "Parks and Recreation" fame, suggested an award
category seriously missing from the Emmy ballot:
"Outstanding Baby in a Drama or Miniseries." Well, why not?
It takes skill and sacrifice to be a baby on TV. A TV baby's life
transforms from the happy-go-lucky ordinary schedule of a
non-famous baby, as he or she must add "starring on TV"
and "being held and cooed at by actors" to the ordinary tasks
of sleeping, learning to crawl, soiling diapers and eating.
Here are some of the candidates for "Outstanding Baby in a
TV Show."
HOLLY ON "BREAKING BAD"
We can credit this nomination to Ansari. Baby Holly, like
most babies, has to look cute a lot. She also has to accompa
ny Mama Skyler on all her infamous adventures with adul
tery and money laundering, because despite the family's
windfall of cash, they don't like to hire babysitters. Luckily
she spends less time with Papa Walter White, and mostly just
shows up on occasion to accentuate the corrupt and fascinat
ing predicament of family man Heisenberg.
HOPE ON "RAISING HOPE"
"Raising Hope" is one of the most underrated and under
marketed shows on TV —but somehow it has made it to its
third season! Baby Hope is the titular character, born to a
serial killer who is given the death penalty. She is raised by a
haphazard family: her slightly slow but well-intentioned
father Jimmy Chance, a wacky grandma and grandpa with
an extremely low IQ, along with Hope's great-great-grand
mother who is in a deep stage of dementia. Now, this might
sound like a sad life, but somehow Hope makes the best of it,
because in every episode, hilarity ensues!
CECE ON "THE OFFICE"
The comfort of baby CeCe (and her new baby brother
Philip) is that she doesn't overstay her welcome. Now clearly,
we love babies, but sometimes they can detract from a show
like "The Office," because let's face it: Dunder Mifflin just
isn't the most appropriate place to raise a child. Jim and Pam
are freaking awesome, so they know they should keep their
baby away from their freaky (but lovable) coworkers as much
as possible.
MICHELLE ON "FULL HOUSE"
We can't talk about babies on TV without paying homage to
the iconic show of the late 'Bos and early '9os. Aside from
John Stamos as Uncle Jesse (swoon), Michelle was clearly the
best character. She started out as just a cute little baby, but
before long she was walking around, being cute, saying
things like, "You got it, dude!" and "You've got a bad atti
tude!" Not to mention, Michelle turned out MK and Ashley
as well as a litany of GIFs.
PEBBLES ON "THE FLINTSTONES"
Aww. She's a drawing, and the actress who played her moth
er, Wilma, also voiced baby Pebbles. Commentary on moth
er-daughter vicarious relationships if nothing else! But nev
ertheless, Pebbles was a cutie, and she was named through a
viewer-wide naming contest that clearly benefited Fruity
Pebbles somehow. Cross-marketing, whatup!
