# INTERMISSION
## 8 Indicators You Should Work for Intermission 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
Have you ever felt like a plastic bag?
Not even the one in "American
Beauty?" Well you might suffer
from physical displacement, or you might
find your other plastic bag friends over at
The Daily offices with Intermission in our
bastion of cultural self medicationg. The
following are indicators that the later is
your diagnosis.

Someone once told you what you
wrote was good. And/or laughed, gig
gled, smiled, gasped or grew outraged by
your penned point. While we don't work
for external validation, if other people
like your artistic product and you
remembered it, we'd like to talk. Bring
your scented resume and tastefully thick
business card. Romalian type. Moms,
friends and creepy professors count, but
if it came from someone without incen
tive or personal connection, we are really
feelin' it.

You consider watching television,
seeing movies, listening to jams and
peeping Instagram as research. "We go
to Stanford, we're always busy," says the
studious premed buried in p-sets and
gross that's already enough! We get you,
you uncultured yahoos, but our breed of
Intermission beasts make the time for
our daily doses of cultural high. There are
serious structural elements to plot and
character that you can only learn by
watching "Breaking Bad" episode to
episode.

You've considered a pixie cut. The bold

ness of your deliberation over pixie cut
versus long layers but your ultimate rea
sonableness to hide amongst the crowd
promises a levelheaded brazen aesthete
whose intellectual sap we'd like to tap.
Tap like sap, not like, "I'd tap that."
You could recognize who Scott

Schuman, Anna Dello Russo, Liandra
Medine and Jane Aldridge (optional)
are... by their aliases!! Okay, even if you
don't keep up on The Sartorialist clickin'
pics of ADR and The Man Repeller, or

the portraits on Sea of Shoes, we can
teach you that stuff It's more your appre
ciation that signals your place at home in
the layout Batcave of The Daily.
You think @kimkierkegaardashian

is the greatest thing since Goldman
Sachs Elevator. "Did you guys like the
season finale of Keeping Up With The
Kardashians??? My whole life is an epi
gram calculated to make people aware." If
the intertext of Catholic existential phi
losophy and hyperreal expose tele-per
sona under the visage of social media
really gets your funny bone bouncing,
Intermission's the place for you!
Especially if you also indulge in flagi
tiously delicious tweets of overpaid suits,
we'll take it! RKOI can count too.
Grammatical errors, fashion faux
pas, cinematic travesties piss you off in a
verbally or visuaUyprolific way. Have you
noticed we don't use oxford commas (AP
BAY-BY). Think the tracking shot is tired?
Is it him and me not him and I? Grab your
reporter's notebook and come with us.
"WATCH: Drew Barrymore Tries
Fashion Photography With Charlotte
Gainsbourg" that headline caught
your attention. Social media, required.
Intended exposure to popular news a plus.
You know who really said, "To

thine own self be true." Not only that,
but you also appreciate the adaptive
prowess of "Clueless" and the socio-polit
ical commentary it makes on the follies of
youth and the game of courtship.
