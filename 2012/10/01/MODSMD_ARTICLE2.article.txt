# Substance-free housing debuts
## 24 students join substance-free community in Mirrielees first floor wing 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Stanford's first foray into substance-free
housing began last week when 24 pilot year
participants moved into a first floor wing of
the Mirrielees apartment complexes.
Because the program is new this year, resi
dents will be largely responsible for setting
the norms of the substance-free community.
Although the official punishment for fail
ing to uphold the substance-free standard is

reassignment to a different residence hall or
removal from housing, students in the pro
gram believe they have some leeway.
"I think that is kind of something that
they want us to figure out and make for our
selves, since we are the pilot group [or] the
guinea pigs for substance-free," said
Johnathan Bowes 'l5, a first-floor Mirrielees
resident.
Banned substances include "alcohol, illic
it drugs, cigarettes and other forms of smok

ing materials," according to Residential
Education (ResEd). Residents and their
guests are not allowed to return to the resi
dence under the influence of or in possession
of any banned substances.
"It's totally okay for people to go out and
party and drink and stuff, it's just more about
making a dorm environment that's not based
around that," Bowes said.
Ralph Castro, director of the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE),

wrote in an email to The Daily that the idea
of substance-free housing was developed as
"part of [OAPE's] approach to address alco
hol in a multifaceted manner," and noted
that substance-free housing is one way to
bring together the community of students
who choose to avoid alcohol and other drugs.
"We are actively working to strengthen
our support for non-drinkers and this accom-
plishes one piece of that
goal," Castro said.
Bowes said that though a
community is beginning to
form amongst Mirrielees
residents, outsiders are less
likely to understand the
choice to live on a sub
stance-free floor.
"It kind of comes across
as we're judgmental, like the
Woman's Temperance Union
or whatever from back in the
day," Bowes said. "From
what I can tell so far, that's
totally not us, that's not why
I'm here, that's not why my
roommate is here, that's not
why the few people that I
know and have talked to are

here. It's more about, 'Hey,
we're not personally into liv
ing in the center of a dis
cotheque.'"
Many of Stanford's peer
institutions, including Dartmouth
and Princeton, instituted sub
stance-free housing programs
as early as 2002. Stanford's
program, which Castro said
has been discussed for many
years, was developed in
response to student requests
for a substance-free housing
option.
"My roommate and I
chose substance-free hous
ing because we felt that
there was a lot of pressure to
participate in the drinking
culture in other dorms,"
Amy Nguyen 'l5 wrote in an
email to Tlie Daily. "Many of
our friends and dormmates
wanted to socialize through
alcohol and partying, so we

weren't able to connect with
people without going to
those events."
Nguyen believes that
most people in the house
will not have any issues with
adhering to the substance
free standard.
"I think for most people
in substance-free housing,
alcohol and drugs are just
not a part of our lifestyle so
we never think about
breaching the rules," she
said. "It's easy for us to be in
substance-free housing
because we just continue our

normal lifestyle without
being bothered by the drink
ing culture."
Although this year's sub
stance-free housing was only
available to upperclassmen,
some freshmen wish that
they had had the chance to
live in a substance-free envi
ronment.

"Although drinking par
ties in my dorm don't really
affect me, I prefer living in
a dorm without these sorts
of influences," Wilbur resi
dent Joanne Lynn 'l6 said.
"Next year, if possible, I

will apply for substance
free housing."
However, the future of
substance-free housing is
still unclear.
"Since it is a pilot, we will
study and review it after this
year and see which direction
is best to proceed in," Castro
said. "We will gather infor
mation from the students liv
ing there on how it can be
strengthened or expanded
moving forward."

Stanford's first foray into substance-free
housing began last week when 24 pilot year
participants moved into a first floor wing of
the Mirrielees apartment complexes.
Because the program is new this year, resi
dents will be largely responsible for setting
the norms of the substance-free community.
Although the official punishment for fail
ing to uphold the substance-free standard is

reassignment to a different residence hall or
removal from housing, students in the pro
gram believe they have some leeway.
"I think that is kind of something that
they want us to figure out and make for our
selves, since we are the pilot group [or] the
guinea pigs for substance-free," said
Johnathan Bowes 'l5, a first-floor Mirrielees
resident.
Banned substances include "alcohol, illic
it drugs, cigarettes and other forms of smok

ing materials," according to Residential
Education (ResEd). Residents and their
guests are not allowed to return to the resi
dence under the influence of or in possession
of any banned substances.
"It's totally okay for people to go out and
party and drink and stuff, it's just more about
making a dorm environment that's not based
around that," Bowes said.
Ralph Castro, director of the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE),

wrote in an email to The Daily that the idea
of substance-free housing was developed as
"part of [OAPE's] approach to address alco
hol in a multifaceted manner," and noted
that substance-free housing is one way to
bring together the community of students
who choose to avoid alcohol and other drugs.
"We are actively working to strengthen
our support for non-drinkers and this accom-
plishes one piece of that
goal," Castro said.
Bowes said that though a
community is beginning to
form amongst Mirrielees
residents, outsiders are less
likely to understand the
choice to live on a sub
stance-free floor.
"It kind of comes across
as we're judgmental, like the
Woman's Temperance Union
or whatever from back in the
day," Bowes said. "From
what I can tell so far, that's
totally not us, that's not why
I'm here, that's not why my
roommate is here, that's not
why the few people that I
know and have talked to are

here. It's more about, 'Hey,
we're not personally into liv
ing in the center of a dis
cotheque.'"
Many of Stanford's peer
institutions, including Dartmouth
and Princeton, instituted sub
stance-free housing programs
as early as 2002. Stanford's
program, which Castro said
has been discussed for many
years, was developed in
response to student requests
for a substance-free housing
option.
"My roommate and I
chose substance-free hous
ing because we felt that
there was a lot of pressure to
participate in the drinking
culture in other dorms,"
Amy Nguyen 'l5 wrote in an
email to Tlie Daily. "Many of
our friends and dormmates
wanted to socialize through
alcohol and partying, so we

weren't able to connect with
people without going to
those events."
Nguyen believes that
most people in the house
will not have any issues with
adhering to the substance
free standard.
"I think for most people
in substance-free housing,
alcohol and drugs are just
not a part of our lifestyle so
we never think about
breaching the rules," she
said. "It's easy for us to be in
substance-free housing
because we just continue our

normal lifestyle without
being bothered by the drink
ing culture."
Although this year's sub
stance-free housing was only
available to upperclassmen,
some freshmen wish that
they had had the chance to
live in a substance-free envi
ronment.

"Although drinking par
ties in my dorm don't really
affect me, I prefer living in
a dorm without these sorts
of influences," Wilbur resi
dent Joanne Lynn 'l6 said.
"Next year, if possible, I

will apply for substance
free housing."
However, the future of
substance-free housing is
still unclear.
"Since it is a pilot, we will
study and review it after this
year and see which direction
is best to proceed in," Castro
said. "We will gather infor
mation from the students liv
ing there on how it can be
strengthened or expanded
moving forward."
