## The 						Flipside changes team, keeps jokes 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
The first issue of The Flipside, Stanford's
weekly satirical news publication, was distrib
uted last week under new leadership for the first
time since it was founded four years ago. Conor
Doherty 'l3 and Kyle Hoffer 'l4 are the new
president and vice-president, respectively. Bill
Driscoll 'l3, The Flipside's managing editor, is
affectionately referred to as the "Master of
Shadows."
"When we need to bust someone's kneecap
in a back alley, we usually send Bill," Doherty
joked.
One of the big changes the team has planned
for the year is the discontinuation of the num
bers section, a satirical comment on campus life
based around a random number, although
Flipside did include numbers in its first issue. For
the most part, the rest of the Flipside will remain
the same for the near future.
"We might do a few different things," Floffer
said. "Not yet, though, we're trying to just figure
out the baseline now before we do anything too
crazy."
The Flipside's new leadership has decided to
keep their jokes on the safer, less offensive side
as they get settled into their new roles.
"We're not going to be offensive for a little
while," Doherty said. "We're going to wait until
at least the fifth or sixth week before I have to
go to sensitivity training."
The Flipside will continue the tradition of
having a fake booth at the winter quarter activi
ties fair and the editorial board plans to keep the
website generally the same, but with a heavier
multimedia emphasis.
"We're going to try to do some video stuff
because we have a green screen," Hoffer said.
These changes come on the heels of the grad
uation of The Flipside's founder and longtime
president Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 and vice-presi
dent Zach Galant 'l2.
"Half [of] the really important people who
were in it last year aren't in it this year," Driscoll
said.
While the new team doesn't feel pressure to
live up to the expectations set by last year's edi
torial board Doherty wondered, "Do people
have expectations?" they do have some
hopes for the year.
"Being funny is nice, in general. That's kind
of the goal," Hoffer deadpanned.
"Don't make a puzzle that's too hard or peo
ple will whine about it," Driscoll added.
Doherty agreed, continuing, "There's a lot of
pressure on Akiko [Kozato 'l3, the new puzzle
master] more than anyone else. People just do
the puzzles and don't even read the articles."
Primarily though, this year's team is simply
trying to carry on The Flipside's tradition and
keep up its popularity.
"We're just trying not to run [The Flipside]
into the ground," Doherty said. "Jeremy
[Keeshin] ran everything for four years. He
could have done everything by himself if he'd
wanted to."
Keeshin and Galant are now working on a
startup far removed from The Flipside's humor,
although, according to Doherty, Keeshin
remains in constant contact.
"This is like the first passing of the baton, so
we want to make sure we don't drop it," Driscoll
said.
Readers of The Flipside expressed little con
cern about the change in leadership, so long as
the leaflet maintains its signature irreverent
humor.
"I guess I don't know what a change in lead
ership would mean, as long as they keep the con
tent that I care about there," said Evan Appel
'l3. "As long as they keep it witty, I have no
problem."
Alan Le 'l3 said that The Flipside's levity is
important, but was also impressed with its tack-
ling of deeper problems.
"I think it adds a little fla
vor to lunch which is when
they typically pass [it] out. It's
nice; it's kind of an activity to
laugh over," he said. "[But] a
lot of [the articles] are really
current issues."

This year's first issue of
the Flipside was distributed
on Sept. 24, the first day of
classes. There was general
confusion about lines of text
missing their first letters,
which some students thought
was a joke.
"People did not under
stand why there were print
ing errors," Driscoll said.
But not every printing
error caused confusion. The
first edition's numbers sec
tion said that four freshmen
should not have been admit
ted to the class of 2016, a
number far smaller than
what the editorial board had
intended.
"The number was much
larger than four, but [the
printer] just chopped it off..
. for no reason," Doherty
said. "That's way funnier
than the joke we had origi
nally."
Despite a general desire
to keep things the way they
are, the new editorial board
sinisterly hinted at changes
on the horizon.
"There will be changes,
and there will be blood,"
Doherty said.
"Less blood than changes,
though, probably," Hoffer
added.
"Well, officially," Doherty
said. "But you've got to be
careful about the Master of
Shadows."
