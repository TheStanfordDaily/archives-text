## Stand-out startups at StartX 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
StartX, a Stanford-founded startup incu
bator, hosted a demo day on Saturday for its
alumnus companies from summer sessions
past, including the new start-up class of 2012.
Held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center, the
event allowed startups to showcase their
products to the community, journalists and
the public. Below are four companies that
stood out for their ingenuity, potential and
innovativeness this weekend.
addy
addy presents a new way to catalogue
addresses through URLs. Company
founder Khaled Nairn MBA 'l3 argued that
it makes little sense to keep using our
"archaic, broken street-addressing systems"
given the possibilities offered by current

web and mapping infrastructure.
The service allows the user to create
location tabs, or "addys," for certain places
or events, and present an additional layer on
top of existing mapping infrastructure.
According to Nairn, the Stanford com
munity has already embraced addy's tech
nology.
"Many people around Stanford have
been using addy to share the location of
their tailgate, event or meet-up locations,"
he said. "Some businesses around campus
are also using addy to help visitors find
[them]."
Pixelee
Founded in April 2012 and due for
release in November, Pixelee takes advan
tage of the vast number of user-generated
photos in any industry for example,
entertainment, sports or fashion and uses

them to promote for the company and ulti
mately collect information to help brands
understand their customers better.
"User-generated photos are fundamen
tally changing the way the brands are per
ceived and Pixelee is going to be at the cen
ter of that," said Pixelee CEO Kyle Wong
'l2. "By putting intelligence around these
photos we are creating the technology that
is going to democratize brands."
Pixelee has already worked with a num
ber of pilot clients including the San
Francisco 49ers and the Stanford Alumni
Association. The company is still in its infan
cy but represents movement in a largely
undeveloped market.
