# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford endowment grew 3.2 percent last fiscal year 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
The Stanford University Merged Pool achieved a
1.0 percent return on investments over 12 months end
ing June 30,2012.
The Merged Pool (MP) is Stanford's primary
investment pool, including the majority of the
University's endowment and expendable funds, the
University's capital reserves from Stanford Hospital
and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital's
capital reserves.
The University endowment grew by 3.2 percent to
$17.0 billion during Stanford's fiscal year ending Aug.
31, 2012. The endowment payout over that period
was $872 million, or 5.3 percent of the endowment's
value at the beginning of the year. The budgeted
endowment payout for the 2013 fiscal year is $926
million, or 5.4 percent of the beginning-of-year
endowment value.
"Fiscal year 2012 was a challenging year for inter
national equity markets, which was a drag on the port
folio," John Powers, CEO of the Stanford

Management Company, told
Stanford Report. "Nevertheless, we
exited the year with improved liq
uidity and a high-quality portfolio
in the face of a macroeconomy
which still poses significant risks."
In the past 10 years, the
University's endowment has grown

from $7.5 billion to $19.7 billion.
"Our endowment is still smaller
than preceding the 2008-09 finan
cial downturn, and we continue to
be concerned about the possible
reductions in federal research
funding and an investment down
turn driven by global economic
malaise," said Randy Livingston,
University vice president for busi
ness affairs and chief financial offi
cer, to Stanford Report.
