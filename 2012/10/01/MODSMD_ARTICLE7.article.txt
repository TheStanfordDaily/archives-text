# CAMPUS LIFE
## Black, queer and male at Stanford 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY STAFF WRITER 
Kyle is a recent graduate
of Stanford. He identi
fies as male and as
either gay or queer.
Michael is a senior who
grew up in the South and identifies
as gender-fluid and gay. John is a sen
ior from the New York metropolitan
area who identifies as gender-queer
and asexual. All three students are
African American. They agreed to
speak to The Daily if their names
were changed for privacy purposes.
Finding support at Stanford
Though a variety of support
groups exist or have existed within
both the black and queer communi
ties, the number of resources for stu
dents at the intersection of these
groups is low, even given how small
the black and queer community is.
"I haven't found a sense of com
munity as a queer person of color
as a black queer," John said. "There
are not institutional services or sup
port groups that foster community
for the black and queer community."
All three students said they felt
comfortable being queer within the
black community. The students
expressed a varying degree of com
fort interacting with the larger queer
community.
John was involved with queer vol
untary student organizations during
his freshman year but said these
organizations did not meet his needs.
"I felt that there were certain
needs that those communities could
not meet or fulfill... part of it had to
do with race," he said.
Kyle found a supportive commu
nity in Terra, a cooperative house
inhabited primarily by queer stu

dents, where many of his friends
lived.
The most relevant group to Kyle,
Michael and John was Black and
Queer at Stanford (BlaQs), in which
all three participated because it pro
vided a network of support. But
since the club stopped holding regu
lar meetings in the 2010-11 academic
year, students have had to look to
either the black or queer communi
ties.
Michael described feeling more
comfortable with the black commu
nity at Stanford than with the queer
community.
"I feel 100 percent comfortable
being gay, queer [and] gender-fluid in
the black community," Michael said.
"I spent my first year coming to
terms with the fact that acceptance in
the way that I was envisioning it
within the gay community was not
going to come. Following that, I got a
lot more support in general from
African American people."
John said he never felt uncom
fortable within the community but
that he did not quite feel at home.
"I've never experienced any
homophobia or any reason to be
uncomfortable in the black commu
nity," John said. "But just because
there were few publicly identified
queer people in the black communi
ty, I didn't feel like there was a com
munity there for me."
Michael said he misses having a
black, queer community support
group to relate to.
"What I miss is not always having
people who are visibly gay and black
around at parties to dance with or
talk to [or] hang out with," he said.
Adding that queer communities
"should and could" be a place where
he could look for short-term and life
long partners, Michael said, "I don't
think I get that at Stanford."

Differences between queer and
black communities
Michael expressed how he feels
he needs to act differently in each
community.
"I feel community with African
American people but I always feel
like when I'm in the LGBT commu
nity, specifically at Stanford, it's more
about a competition," he said. "I'm
much more performative. I feel like I
end up being much more of a diva."
Though Terra Happy Hour serves
as a gathering space for many queer
undergraduate students, Michael
said he stopped going after freshman
year because it "ultimately wound up
being something that wasn't
healthy" for him.

Michael said that he felt ignored
during social events at the house.
"I felt like in the gay community,
I was being made invisible," he said.
"At parties and functions, people
who are not black or not female
almost act like I'm not there."

Michael described the opposite
situation where he said people who
ignored him otherwise would
approach him as an object.
"[There are] people who disre
gard me every day of the week
because I'm black, but the days that
parties are happening, I may be
approached during the party [or]
after the party," he said. "People are
approaching me then in a sexual
way."

John, a former Terra resident,
reported more positive experiences
at Happy Hour yet admitted feeling
alienated within the queer communi
ty at times. He has not, however,
explicitly experienced racism within
the group.

"Even if someone did find me
interesting, intriguing or attractive it
was always in such away that high
lighted my differences that made

me realize how non-white I was, how
non-middle-class I was or how non
normative and non-masculine I was
but not in an explicitly denigrat
ing way," he said. "It was in a face
value, superficial way that didn't
allow me to be seen in all of my total
ity and wholeness and depth."
John noted that his experience
with racial politics of desire in the
queer community might be different
because of his sexual identity.
"The thing that may make my
experience different as a queer per
son of color is that I identify as asex
ual," he said. "Since I don't date at
Stanford and generally don't date in
the gay community, I haven't inter
acted with men in a sexual capacity
at Stanford."

Encountering racism
Kyle said he thinks about his sex
uality in terms of race all the time,
citing the Ã¼biquity of his skin color.
"I always say I'm black first
because it's one of the things that's
immediately noticeable," he said.
"When someone identifies me,
they're going to say, 'That black, gay
person,' not, 'That gay, black guy.'"
Kyle said he was shocked to expe
rience racism in as progressive an
area of the country as the Bay Area.
"At first I thought, 'Well, what am
I doing wrong? Am I exuding some
thing that is making people think
that I am somehow not desirable?"'
he said. "Then I was like, 'There's
nothing wrong with my race
you're racist.'"

John said he witnessed what some
might perceive as "internalized hate"
among his black, gay friends.
"A lot of my gay, black, male
friends sophomore year were only
interested in white men," he said.
"No one was ever interested in
each other. It's another part of the
sexual politics of being gay and
black at Stanford."
Michael said he too once inter
nalized the racism he has experi
enced at Stanford.
"Sometimes I forget how
attractive I am until I get off the
plane in New Orleans, or Jackson
or Atlanta and [notice] the recep

tion I get from African American
men," he said.
Moving beyond
Kyle said that he stopped inter
nalizing the racism he experienced
after he began speaking up about it.
Kyle recalled asking a Stanford
classmate to explain his rationale
for expressing racist thoughts. The
classmate said, "I just think black
people are sexually inferior."
The student apologized two
years later, Kyle said.
"I think he began to understand
why it's offensive to say it aloud ...
but I don't think those views have
changed," Kyle said.

According to Kyle, introspec
tion is key to releasing oneself
from the binds of internalized
racism.
"I realized that being in the
minority doesn't make me less
attractive than anyone else," he
said.
Michael, who said he is gaining
back his confidence away from the
gay community at Stanford, said
that in the moments when he does
not feel invisible, "I think, I feel, I
know [that] I am an attractive indi
vidual."

Kyle is a recent graduate
of Stanford. He identi
fies as male and as
either gay or queer.
Michael is a senior who
grew up in the South and identifies
as gender-fluid and gay. John is a sen
ior from the New York metropolitan
area who identifies as gender-queer
and asexual. All three students are
African American. They agreed to
speak to The Daily if their names
were changed for privacy purposes.
Finding support at Stanford
Though a variety of support
groups exist or have existed within
both the black and queer communi
ties, the number of resources for stu
dents at the intersection of these
groups is low, even given how small
the black and queer community is.
"I haven't found a sense of com
munity as a queer person of color
as a black queer," John said. "There
are not institutional services or sup
port groups that foster community
for the black and queer community."
All three students said they felt
comfortable being queer within the
black community. The students
expressed a varying degree of com
fort interacting with the larger queer
community.
John was involved with queer vol
untary student organizations during
his freshman year but said these
organizations did not meet his needs.
"I felt that there were certain
needs that those communities could
not meet or fulfill... part of it had to
do with race," he said.
Kyle found a supportive commu
nity in Terra, a cooperative house
inhabited primarily by queer stu

dents, where many of his friends
lived.
The most relevant group to Kyle,
Michael and John was Black and
Queer at Stanford (BlaQs), in which
all three participated because it pro
vided a network of support. But
since the club stopped holding regu
lar meetings in the 2010-11 academic
year, students have had to look to
either the black or queer communi
ties.
Michael described feeling more
comfortable with the black commu
nity at Stanford than with the queer
community.
"I feel 100 percent comfortable
being gay, queer [and] gender-fluid in
the black community," Michael said.
"I spent my first year coming to
terms with the fact that acceptance in
the way that I was envisioning it
within the gay community was not
going to come. Following that, I got a
lot more support in general from
African American people."
John said he never felt uncom
fortable within the community but
that he did not quite feel at home.
"I've never experienced any
homophobia or any reason to be
uncomfortable in the black commu
nity," John said. "But just because
there were few publicly identified
queer people in the black communi
ty, I didn't feel like there was a com
munity there for me."
Michael said he misses having a
black, queer community support
group to relate to.
"What I miss is not always having
people who are visibly gay and black
around at parties to dance with or
talk to [or] hang out with," he said.
Adding that queer communities
"should and could" be a place where
he could look for short-term and life
long partners, Michael said, "I don't
think I get that at Stanford."

Differences between queer and
black communities
Michael expressed how he feels
he needs to act differently in each
community.
"I feel community with African
American people but I always feel
like when I'm in the LGBT commu
nity, specifically at Stanford, it's more
about a competition," he said. "I'm
much more performative. I feel like I
end up being much more of a diva."
Though Terra Happy Hour serves
as a gathering space for many queer
undergraduate students, Michael
said he stopped going after freshman
year because it "ultimately wound up
being something that wasn't
healthy" for him.

Michael said that he felt ignored
during social events at the house.
"I felt like in the gay community,
I was being made invisible," he said.
"At parties and functions, people
who are not black or not female
almost act like I'm not there."

Michael described the opposite
situation where he said people who
ignored him otherwise would
approach him as an object.
"[There are] people who disre
gard me every day of the week
because I'm black, but the days that
parties are happening, I may be
approached during the party [or]
after the party," he said. "People are
approaching me then in a sexual
way."

John, a former Terra resident,
reported more positive experiences
at Happy Hour yet admitted feeling
alienated within the queer communi
ty at times. He has not, however,
explicitly experienced racism within
the group.

"Even if someone did find me
interesting, intriguing or attractive it
was always in such away that high
lighted my differences that made

me realize how non-white I was, how
non-middle-class I was or how non
normative and non-masculine I was
but not in an explicitly denigrat
ing way," he said. "It was in a face
value, superficial way that didn't
allow me to be seen in all of my total
ity and wholeness and depth."
John noted that his experience
with racial politics of desire in the
queer community might be different
because of his sexual identity.
"The thing that may make my
experience different as a queer per
son of color is that I identify as asex
ual," he said. "Since I don't date at
Stanford and generally don't date in
the gay community, I haven't inter
acted with men in a sexual capacity
at Stanford."

Encountering racism
Kyle said he thinks about his sex
uality in terms of race all the time,
citing the Ã¼biquity of his skin color.
"I always say I'm black first
because it's one of the things that's
immediately noticeable," he said.
"When someone identifies me,
they're going to say, 'That black, gay
person,' not, 'That gay, black guy.'"
Kyle said he was shocked to expe
rience racism in as progressive an
area of the country as the Bay Area.
"At first I thought, 'Well, what am
I doing wrong? Am I exuding some
thing that is making people think
that I am somehow not desirable?"'
he said. "Then I was like, 'There's
nothing wrong with my race
you're racist.'"

John said he witnessed what some
might perceive as "internalized hate"
among his black, gay friends.
"A lot of my gay, black, male
friends sophomore year were only
interested in white men," he said.
"No one was ever interested in
each other. It's another part of the
sexual politics of being gay and
black at Stanford."
Michael said he too once inter
nalized the racism he has experi
enced at Stanford.
"Sometimes I forget how
attractive I am until I get off the
plane in New Orleans, or Jackson
or Atlanta and [notice] the recep

tion I get from African American
men," he said.
Moving beyond
Kyle said that he stopped inter
nalizing the racism he experienced
after he began speaking up about it.
Kyle recalled asking a Stanford
classmate to explain his rationale
for expressing racist thoughts. The
classmate said, "I just think black
people are sexually inferior."
The student apologized two
years later, Kyle said.
"I think he began to understand
why it's offensive to say it aloud ...
but I don't think those views have
changed," Kyle said.

According to Kyle, introspec
tion is key to releasing oneself
from the binds of internalized
racism.
"I realized that being in the
minority doesn't make me less
attractive than anyone else," he
said.
Michael, who said he is gaining
