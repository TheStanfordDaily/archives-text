## Picazo patiently waits turn 
### Joseph Beyda 
Stanford quarterbacks like
beating USC's Matt
Barkley. Senior Robbie
Picazo was the first one to
doit.
After Barkley's Mater Dei
Monarchs dominated Picazo's Tesoro
Titans when the two were high school
juniors, the passers met again in the
2008 CIF playoffs with their respec
tive prep careers on the line. Barkley
went 12-for-33 with a touchdown and
four interceptions (including two pick
sixes). Picazo went 22-for-31 with two
scores and only one interception.
Tesoro advanced.
Four years later, Picazo pants
through our post-practice interview
like he has just led a two-minute drill
from his own 10-yard line. He's a bit
late off the field after getting in a few
extra post-practice reps.
You would think he's preparing
for another high-pressure start. You'd
be wrong.
For one, Stanford's starting quar
terback isn't Picazo but his road
roommate, fellow senior Josh Nunes.
Nunes' job is to lead the Cardinal
offense into battle every Saturday;
Picazo's job is to lead the scout team
every Monday through Friday.
He's Stanford's fourth-string quar
terback if you give him the benefit of
the doubt; with Dallas Lloyd back
from a two-year Mormon mission,
Picazo could very well be fifth in line.
He's a senior walk-on who has only
thrown three collegiate passes all
for completions and likely will
never toss another. But he hasn't
thrown in the towel just yet.
"I try to make the most of what
I've got," Picazo explains.
He didn't have very much to
work with as a high-school senior
four years ago. Despite being named
the Orange County Offensive Player
of the Year after a 2,754-yard 2008
season that included the win against
Barkley, all Picazo had was an official
offer from Princeton, which doesn't
offer athletic scholarships due to Ivy
League rules, and a "preferred walk
on" spot at Stanford.
Unlike with most recruits,
Stanford didn't have much of an
upper hand when it came to the aca
demics, and Picazo's football opportu
nities were vaster at Princeton. With
the Tigers, he would likely have a
smooth ascendance to the helm of an
anemic Princeton offense, which is
ranked 108 th of 121 FCS teams in
yards per game this season. With the
Cardinal, he would be forced to watch
Andrew Luck throw darts for two
well, make that three â€”years before
competing with former top prospects
to fill the void left by the eventual
two-time Heisman runner-up.
But Picazo, whose parents met
while living in Stanford's Branner
Hall as freshmen in 1975, had been
following Cardinal football for years
and just couldn't turn his back on a
dream.
"I knew if I went to Princeton, I
always would've wondered," he said.
"This was always my dream, to come
to Stanford, so it wouldn't have really
mattered if I had played well [at
Princeton]. I would've just wondered
if I could have succeeded here, and I
didn't want that."
And so the uphill climb began.
Luck had just unseated senior Tavita
Pritchard as Stanford's starting quar
terback when Nunes (four stars) and
Picazo (two) arrived on the Farm in
2009. When Luck missed the Sun
Bowl that year with a finger injury,
Picazo was listed as Pritchard's back
up; by the start of their sophomore
season, Picazo and Nunes were even
on the depth chart.
"Getting here, our offense is pret
ty complex, so I just tried to pick up as
much of it then as I could," Picazo
said. "Looking back, I didn't know
that much."
"I felt confident in my ability, that
I'd get a shot at some point. But
there's only one quarterback that can
play at a time, so I knew I would have
to wait my time. I was just hoping that
at some point, if I performed well
enough in practice, I'd get a shot."
Picazo saw his first game action in
the last regular-season contest of 2010,
handing off passes in garbage time
against Oregon State. He made the
most of his appearance in the 2011
season opener against San Jose State,
completing three passes for 15 yards.
But the dream just wasn't meant
to be. Nunes passed Picazo in 2010,
Brett Nottingham followed suit in
2011 and Kevin Hogan threw his hat
into the ring in 2012. When the long
awaited competition to succeed Luck
finally came around this offseason,
Picazo was hardly in the conversation.
"I still was working hard and try-
ing to keep my head up, just
hoping that maybe an oppor
tunity would present itself" he
said. "But it didn't really hap
pen."

So Picazo will likely spend
his last two months of Stanford
football on the scout team,
mimicking opposing quarter
backs for the Cardinal

defense's benefit. He's pretty
darn good at it; Stanford's
defense has stumped Picazo's
old nemesis. Matt Barkley, four
years in a row.
After the season he'll be
looking for a job in sports mar
keting or business (he's a man
agement science and engineer
ing major). Despite four years
of donning a Stanford jersey
the one he had always
dreamed of wearing prima
rily on the sidelines, he has no
regrets.
"As long as 1 got an oppor

tunity I would be happy with
that, just to prove it to myselij"
Picazo said. "Either it was
going to happen or it wasn't."

Joseph Beyda had invitations
to join the Cardinal as the
team's fourth-string left tackle,
but reported to camp his sen
ior year 150 pounds under
weight and subsequently lost
his scholarship. His loss was
The Daily's gain, but if you'd
like to encourage him to try
out again, send him an email
at jbeyda@stanford.edu.
