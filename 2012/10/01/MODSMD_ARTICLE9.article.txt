A tough loss in Friday night's Pac-12 open
er against No. 9 UCLA meant the men's soc
cer team had dropped three straight matches
and was staring down the barrel of a long sea
son by starting the conference schedule 0-2.
But redshirt freshman Eric Verso's first
career goal and a late add on by sophomore
Zach Batteer ended the Cardinal's drought
and breathed life into the young season as
Stanford (4-5,1-1 Pac-12) knocked off a slug
gish San Diego State team Sunday afternoon.

Stanford coach Jeremy Gunn's side was the
clear aggressor from Sunday's opening whis
tle, creating plenty of chances and nearly
opening the scoring with a dangerous shot
from redshirt sophomore Bobby Edwards just
a minute into the match.
"Our attitude from the kickoff was per
fect," Gunn said. "We were energetic, creating
chances and putting San Diego State under
immense pressure."
Sophomore defender Jimmy Callinan said
the team was fired up and feeling good even in
warmups before the game.
"We really came into today with nothing to
lose, and needing a win," Callinan said. "In
warmups it was clear that we were the fitter
side and we just said, 'Lets take it to San Diego
State.'"
With six shots in the first 11 minutes of the
match, Stanford dominated the run of play
and the attacking third. But as more and more
time elapsed with plenty of shots and no
breakthrough, it appeared as though the
Cardinal might be in for the same fate it had
met in several games this year, outshooting its
opponent by double or triple but losing 2-1 or
1-0.

A well-earned corner kick in the 40th
minute set up Verso for just the spark Stanford

needed. With Verso and redshirt sophomore
Austin Meyer working a short corner, Verso
circled around as Meyer dished the ball off to
him near the corner of the goal box. His shot
was low to the far post and the goalie was
shielded by both defenders and attackers and
was helpless to make the save.
"We'd been knocking on the door for a
while, and the chances were coming and com
ing but we just couldn't get one," Verso said.
"It was a pretty huge goal for me, my first
career goal, really exciting and really amaz
ing."

As a team, the Cardinal outshot San Diego
State 14-2 in the half, and although the Aztecs
picked up their rate of play as they pushed for
ward for an equalizer, Stanford remained in
control.
Senior defender Eric Anderson pushed for
ward with a nice run all the way to goal but
was turned away almost point-blank by Aztec
goalie Tim Peitsch. And several other chances
for the Cardinal went wide or were saved in
the half.

Sophomore forward Zach Batteer (14) scored in the 88th minute to put away San Diego State
and snap Stanford's three-game losing streak on Sunday. It was Batteer's second career goal.
But it wasn't until very
late that Stanford put the
game out of reach, as
Batteer turned in the box
and fired a hard shot past
Peitsch to make it 2-0
Cardinal.

"It felt good," Batteer
said. "We knew that if we
just kept working the things
we'd been working on in
practice and with coach
Gunn, [it] would fall into
place, and if I just kept
believing in myself I knew I

would get one."
It was a good reward for
a side that lost a tough 3-1
match against the Bruins on
Friday night, as UCLA
scored twice before half
time and held off a hard
charging Cardinal side late.
"The win [against the
Aztecs] means a lot for us as
a team," Verso said. "We've
been outplaying every oppo
nent, outshooting them,
unfortunately the results
haven't been coming so far.
We've got a lot of momen
tum coming into the Cal
game, and hopefully we can
build on it and get a win
streak going."
Callinan agreed: "Everyone

is feeling a lot more confident
now that we have a win in
conference. It's good to go
into the Pac-121-1, because it
means that it's probably
going to come down to us
and one other team fighting
for the playoffs, and with
another chance to beat
UCLA we've got a great
shot to make the NCAA
tournament."
The sixth and final
match of Stanford's season
long homestand will kick
off at 7 p.m. when the rival
Golden Bears visit the
Farm.
