Discover how far your skills can take you by spending a year learning the ins and outs of
medtech innovation - from exploring needs in a hospital setting to selecting just the right
need to discovering dozens of solutions with the potential to help save lives and improve
patient care.
Biodesign Process: A unique systematic approach to needs finding and the invention and
implementation of new biomedical technologies involving clinical immersion, identification
and verification of clinical problems, invention, prototyping, early-stage testing, and project
planning.
Solution-Driven: In the past ten years Innovation teams have filed multiple patents, intro
duced new technologies into clinical practice, and have developed new companies that have
had an impact on patient care.
