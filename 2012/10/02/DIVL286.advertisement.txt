Quad snoop
[Heard in the dorm hallways]
"I NEED TO BRUSH MY TEETH NOW. I'm going to get
mono!"
"Are you under 18? It's on my checklist."
Naked Columbae guy in the Claw fountain: "Senior girls get
me!"
"I'm Italian and here's a rose; kiss me?"
Friend to another friend: "Don't kiss anyone! You are classy. Say
it â€”YOU. ARE. CLASSY."
Band guy: "Look I have a large trumpet. Wanna make out?"
Dejected male: "She just clearly did not respect my emotions,
you know?"
