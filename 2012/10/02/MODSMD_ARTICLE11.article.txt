# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Bless me, father; for I have sinned 
### Chris Herries 
For those of you who don't
know, long-distance running
races can be decided by a mat
ter of steps in the middle of the race.
Keeping your opponent close, and in
your sights, is just as important in the
middle of the race as it is in the end.
That's all to give you some context
for this story.
In high school I used to run cross
country, and all the important meets
were at a place called Bear
Mountain. The second mile of this
three-mile race went up into the
mountain proper, a place devoid of
officials but replete with clearly
delineated trail markers. Despite
this, it was common to cut a few steps
off a sharp turn by jumping over a
bush. Now, my mediocrity was leg
endary, so this story isn't about me.
However, I was good friends with a
very talented, heavily favored runner
from a rival school, who ended up
coming in fourth in a very important
race. I questioned him on it, and I'll
never forget what he said: "I lost
because I'm not a cheat." The three
runners in front of him had cut the
barrier. He never really caught back
up to the pack.
This is as good a forum as any to
talk about cheating. Now, bless me
father for I have sinned; there were
isolated times when I would peek at
a person's paper in high school for
some inspiration. Fortunately, I was
n't in a very competitive high school,
so I was never tempted to system
atize cheating and it was never a
habit. But I'm human like everyone

else, and if I went to one of those cut
throat test schools the story could've
been different.
People cheat in life for many rea
sons: wanting to get into a certain
school, receive a certain grade, land a
certain girl, or have just that much
more leisure time. It's been rational
ized in a dozen ways. I've had one
friend claim that he didn't want
incompetent people to receive
admission to elite schools in his stead
just because he chose integrity.
What's wrong with leveling the play
ing field? Others claim it's an issue of
time. If you're rushed, is it so wrong
to Sparknote a book? Some see it as
a natural part of specific classes. If
you write three hundred lines of
code and get no output, is it cheating
to check someone else's code? Many
kids don't even have an actual work
ing definition of cheating. Imagine
you have to write identifications on
your IHUM final. Sorry, Thinking
Matters final. In either case you and
four friends split up the twenty iden
tifications and put them on a Google
doc. Did you just cheat?
Now cheating is obviously bad
for obvious reasons. We're at a uni
versity, and integrity is at the heart of
education. That should be reason
enough.
However, there's a much deeper,
much more meaningful reason to
avoid cheating, in school and life. A
man who cheats on his girlfriend has
some clear future in mind where this
makes him happier. The student at
Stuyvesant or Bronx Science cheats

to get into a better college and there
by be more successful. The person
who cuts corners to save time clearly
thinks that time will be better spent,
that she will ultimately be happier.
In fact, in almost every case of
cheating the perpetrator has a vision
of the future in mind where they're
happier or more successful. Here's
my issue, and here's the real reason
we shouldn't cheat. Dishonesty
should never factor into our concep
tions of success or happiness. And if
they do, if you're comfortable being
successful and dishonest, then you
need to question what your success
has cost you. If you think immorali
ty is a route to contentment then
you need to question what content
ment is. I've always found myself to
be significantly happier when I'm
honest with myself and others
and that means working hard, being
dedicated to friends and sticking to
my principles, even when there's an
easier way.
Now as I've said before, I'm nei
ther a judge, nor a jury, nor an execu
tioner. I tend to believe that people
should do what makes them happy.
All I ask is that if you choose to be
dishonest in your dealings, double
check to make sure you're okay with
that lifestyle. If I were to cheat in
order to be successful, then I would
question my metric for success.
Success isn't worth sacrificing your
integrity for.

All I ask is that if you choose to be
dishonest in your dealings, double
check to make sure you're okay with
that lifestyle. If I were to cheat in

question my metric for success.
Success isn't worth sacrificing your

For those of you who don't
know, long-distance running
races can be decided by a mat
ter of steps in the middle of the race.
Keeping your opponent close, and in
your sights, is just as important in the
middle of the race as it is in the end.
That's all to give you some context
for this story.
In high school I used to run cross
country, and all the important meets
were at a place called Bear
Mountain. The second mile of this
three-mile race went up into the
mountain proper, a place devoid of
officials but replete with clearly
delineated trail markers. Despite
this, it was common to cut a few steps
off a sharp turn by jumping over a
bush. Now, my mediocrity was leg
endary, so this story isn't about me.
However, I was good friends with a
very talented, heavily favored runner
from a rival school, who ended up
coming in fourth in a very important
race. I questioned him on it, and I'll
never forget what he said: "I lost
because I'm not a cheat." The three
runners in front of him had cut the
barrier. He never really caught back
up to the pack.
This is as good a forum as any to
talk about cheating. Now, bless me
father for I have sinned; there were
isolated times when I would peek at
a person's paper in high school for
some inspiration. Fortunately, I was
n't in a very competitive high school,
so I was never tempted to system
atize cheating and it was never a
habit. But I'm human like everyone

else, and if I went to one of those cut
throat test schools the story could've
been different.
People cheat in life for many rea
sons: wanting to get into a certain
school, receive a certain grade, land a
certain girl, or have just that much
more leisure time. It's been rational
ized in a dozen ways. I've had one
friend claim that he didn't want
incompetent people to receive
admission to elite schools in his stead
just because he chose integrity.
What's wrong with leveling the play
ing field? Others claim it's an issue of
time. If you're rushed, is it so wrong
to Sparknote a book? Some see it as
a natural part of specific classes. If
you write three hundred lines of
code and get no output, is it cheating
to check someone else's code? Many
kids don't even have an actual work
ing definition of cheating. Imagine
you have to write identifications on
your IHUM final. Sorry, Thinking
Matters final. In either case you and
four friends split up the twenty iden
tifications and put them on a Google
doc. Did you just cheat?
Now cheating is obviously bad
for obvious reasons. We're at a uni
versity, and integrity is at the heart of
education. That should be reason
enough.
However, there's a much deeper,
much more meaningful reason to
avoid cheating, in school and life. A
man who cheats on his girlfriend has
some clear future in mind where this
makes him happier. The student at
Stuyvesant or Bronx Science cheats

to get into a better college and there
by be more successful. The person
who cuts corners to save time clearly
thinks that time will be better spent,
that she will ultimately be happier.
In fact, in almost every case of
cheating the perpetrator has a vision
of the future in mind where they're
happier or more successful. Here's
my issue, and here's the real reason
we shouldn't cheat. Dishonesty
should never factor into our concep
tions of success or happiness. And if
they do, if you're comfortable being
successful and dishonest, then you
need to question what your success
has cost you. If you think immorali
ty is a route to contentment then
you need to question what content
ment is. I've always found myself to
be significantly happier when I'm
honest with myself and others
and that means working hard, being
dedicated to friends and sticking to
my principles, even when there's an
easier way.
Now as I've said before, I'm nei
ther a judge, nor a jury, nor an execu
tioner. I tend to believe that people
should do what makes them happy.
All I ask is that if you choose to be
dishonest in your dealings, double
check to make sure you're okay with
that lifestyle. If I were to cheat in
