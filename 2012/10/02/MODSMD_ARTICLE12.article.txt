# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
## A
						brief note on "When the wind of freedom falters" 
### 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman and Senior
Associate Vice Provost for
Residential & Dining Enterprises
Shirley Everett wrote a letter to the
editor today pointing out inaccuracies
in The Daily Editorial Board's Sept.
27 editorial "When the wind of free
dom falters."
These inaccuracies consisted pri
marily of conflating the roles and
responsibilities of Residential and

Dining Enterprises (R&DE) and
Residential Education (ResEd). As the
chair of the Editorial Board and editor
in chief of The Stanford Daily, 1 regret
these inaccuracies. We should have
more deeply researched the distinc
tions between the two organizations.
However, the two organizations are
not as separate as the letter to the edi
tor implies. For example, the letter
reads, "The student management pro
grams in Row houses, Row and Suites
kitchens, and Row board plans are
facilitated by Residential Education."
Yet according to R&DE's website, the
organization is responsible for provid
ing funding for "ResEd, Grad Life, Res
Comp, and G&A for campus service."
Can a group that provides funding
for ResEd and often works in tandem

with ResEd really be absolved of
Res Ed's actions and seek to distin
guish itself as a totally separate enti
ty? It's a distinction that matters far
more to the administrators than to
the students.

Additionally, the revocation of
Chi Theta Chi's lease, which would
ostensibly fall under "student man
agement programs in Row houses,"
was also signed by Rodger Whitney,
the executive director of Student
Housing, which is under the purview
of R&DE. How can the University
claim R&DE has no influence over
Row programs when they are in
charge of student housing? The letter
says "the University" decided to
revoke Chi Theta Chi's lease, but we
did not see President Hennessy's
name, or Provost Etchemendy's. Only
directors from R&DE and Res Ed.

Nonetheless, I think the most
important aspect of the response was
its failure to argue any substantive
points. The Editorial Board sought to
provide examples of larger trends
within the entire University adminis
tration. The piece's mistakes, while
regrettable, don't change the main
thrust of the editorial. We still stand
strongly behind our support of stu
dent independence and our protest of
University actions.
These administrators passed on a
key chance to address the core of our
editorial's argument.
"XOX is only the latest casualty of
what appears to be a comprehensive
plan to mitigate University risk at the
expense of the student experience,"
we wrote. And yet the student experi
ence was only briefly and very vague
ly touched on in Boardman and

Everett's letter to the editor.
Every administrator I've spoken
to since we published the editorial has
mentioned it, despite the fact that
we've been meeting about other top
ics or just happen to be passing each
other. The editorial was read thou
sands of times by students, administra
tors, alumni and community members.
And yet, today's letter only
explains what the two departments
do. That's a disappointing response as
we seek to build a dialogue on an
issue that affects the entire student
body.
Dialogues only work if both sides
are willing to engage in open discus
sion.

Best,
BILLY GALLAGHER
