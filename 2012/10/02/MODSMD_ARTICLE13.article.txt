## The
						Tree: Kissing on the Quad 
### â€“ Natasha Weaser 
Stanford's unofficial mascot,
the Tree, has long held a rep
utation as the most active
kisser at Full Moon on the
Quad (FMOTQ). The
Stanford Daily chatted with Tree
Nicoletta von Heidegger 'l3 about
her FMOTQ expectations.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How are
you feeling about tonight? Are you
preparing in any way?
Nicoletta von Heidegger (NH): I am
excited but a little nervous. It is going
to be a lot of fun but I am quite a
germaphobe. I'm very involved with
health on campus so this should be
interesting. I've definitely been taking
all my vitamins.
TSD: This is the first time in seven
years that the Tree is a girl. How has
that been and how will that change
the way you approach FMOTQ this
year?
NH: It has been amazing and I hope
that in the future there will be more
female trees. In fact, I believe that a
female tree holds the record for the
number of kisses with over 1,000 kiss
es about a decade ago. I'm very com
petitive but I'm not sure I want to
beat that record.
TSD: How do the logistics work?
How do you keep count of the kisses
and keep order around you?
NH: I have a team of six people who
will be protecting and assisting me
throughout the night. One of them is a
former Tree and the rest are good
friends. All will be dressed in army out
fits. They will have various jobs from
managing the clicker used to record
kisses to handing me mouthwash.
TSD: In the past, trees have not
always worn the tree outfit to
FMOTQ. What are you planning on
wearing?
NH: I am very proud of the Tree out
fit I made. I draped Christmas lights
all over it too. The point is to be out
there so I figured, go big or go home.
TSD: Will you kiss a girl?
NH: Definitely! I love everyone.
