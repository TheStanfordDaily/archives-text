## SPARTANS SPLASHED 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
In his official debut first-year
head coach Greg Meehan made
sure that the Stanford women's
swimming team emphatically set
the tone for a new era.
Powered by victories in the first
five events of the meet, the Cardinal
(1-0) raced past San Jose State (0-1)
162.5-135.5 in the team's season
opener on Friday.
Stanford got off to a torrid start
when its 200-yard medley relay
team secured a win in the opening

event. The Spartans were hanging
tough through the first three legs of
the relay, but sophomore sprinter
Maddy Schaefer anchored with a
blistering 22.66 freestyle split to pull
away from field.
After freshman Allison Brown
claimed her first career dual-meet
victory in the 1000-yard freestyle,
Stanford struck another major blow
to the Spartans when junior Maya
Dißado led a one-two-three sweep
in the 200-yard freestyle. Dißado
never relinquished the lead that she
got after the first lap, holding off
her teammates Andi Murez and

Andie Taylor by less than half a sec
ond.
It seemed as if Stanford would
run away with a lopsided victory
when Megan Fischer-Colbrie and
Katie Olsen respectively notched
wins in the 100-yard backstroke and
100-yard breaststroke.
But the Spartans stood tall.
During the middle portion of the
meet, San Jose State's Julia
Craddok took the 200-yard butter
fly with ease, edging out Stanford
junior Kristie Chen by almost two
seconds. The Spartans then gave the
Cardinal a scare when they com

pleted a one-two-three sweep of in
the 100-yard freestyle.
Stanford found away to halt San
Jose State's momentum when
Annemaire Thayer and Jessie
Hames locked up a one-two finish
in the 200-yard backstroke. From
then on, the Cardinal continued to
build on its comfortable lead and
would eventually turn the last two
events of the meet into an exhibi
tion.

Amy Kilby, outscored the
Cardinal 13-6 in the 1-meter
springboard event. However,
the Stanford divers convinc
ingly bounced back later in
the 3-meter event as fresh
man Lillian Hinrichs beat out
the rest of the competition by
almost 15 points. Two-time
All-American and NCAA
qualifier Stephanie Phipps

surprisingly finished fourth in
the 3-meter and did not com
pete in the 1-meter.
"It was great to see our
team race, and now we're bet
ter able to identify some areas
in which we need to get bet
ter," Meehan told
GoStanford.com. "There are
a number of things you can
miss when you're in the train
ing environment, and we
learned in today's competi
tive environment that we
need to make better decisions
in our races."
One event that the
Cardinal may be concerned

with is the 200-yard butterfly,
in which the Spartans man
aged a one-three finish and
outscored the Cardinal 14-5.
The same holds true in the
200-yard breaststroke, where
Stanford will need to show
more depth if it hopes to con
tend with the likes of Cal and
use.
The Cardinal will host the
alumni meet this Saturday
before taking on Wisconsin at
the Avery Aquatic Center on
Nov. 2.
