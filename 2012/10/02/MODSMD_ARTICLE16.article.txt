# Women's four wins Head of the Oklahoma
## 
### 
Stanford's women's four placed first at
the Head of the Oklahoma with a time of
16:12.96 a half-second better than second
place Clemson but almost 15 seconds ahead
of third-place Oklahoma before coming
in a close second at the OG&E Night Sprints
this weekend.
"It was a gutsy effort from stroke one that
paid off," women's rowing head coach
Yasmin Farooq told GoStanford.com. "We
won't be doing racing starts until our spring
championship season, but it's an awesome
reminder of what's ahead when we hit 2K
season in March."
The women's eight also had a strong
showing, finishing second out of 21 crews in
the Head of the Oklahoma and later tying
for second at the night event.
