# Fencing releases schedule
## 
### 
On Monday, Stanford fencing announced
its two-meet schedule, which will consist of
the Western Invitational (Jan. 12) and the
Midwest Invitational (Feb. 2-3).
With six of last year's top 15 NCAA
Championship finishers participating in those
two meets, the Cardinal hopes to use them as
preparation for March 9 NCAA Regionals.
The 2012 NCAA Championships will take
place from March 21-24.
