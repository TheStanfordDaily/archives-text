## Kroeger, Cardinal repeat at home 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
In a result that surprised very few, the men's
and women's cross country teams both won the
team races at the Stanford Invitational last
weekend, setting the tone for what each hopes is
a return to the podium at the NCAA
Championships in November.
The women's side was simply dominant,
scoring just 25 points and beating second-place
Adams State by more than 100 points on a
warm day at the Stanford Golf Course. Senior

Kathy Kroeger added to her already impressive
collegiate resume with her third straight
Stanford Invitational crown as the top individ
ual, covering the six-km course in 20:13 she
now has three of the six fastest times in school
history on the course.
"It was great," Kroeger said. "I had a lot of
fun. Coach [Chris Miltenberg] had us working
together with our teammates during the early
part of the race, which was a really great start. It
was nice to run with teammates, be on the home
course opening up the season and I'm glad I
could help the team."

Kroeger definitely helped the team, but the
No. 7 Cardinal had plenty of help up and down
the lineup. Cayla Hatton ran her first collegiate
race and the highly touted freshman from
Andover, Mass., did not disappoint, finishing
second, just eight seconds behind Kroger.
"It was a great race, went out really con
trolled, which is what we were trying to do,"
Hatton said, "and I'm just really excited to have
my first college race under my belt. I didn't real
ly expect any sort of place in this meet, because
I didn't know anything about
the meet before this, so obvi
ously I'm pleased with sec
ond place."
Hatton is the second
fastest American prep runner
all-time in both the 5 km and
10 km, and finished fourth at
the lAAF World Junior
Championships in Barcelona,
the highest finish ever for an
American in the event.
But she is merely a piece
in one Stanford's strongest
recruiting classes in years.
After sophomore Aisling
Cuffe and junior Jessica Tonn
crossed the line in fourth and
fifth place, respectively,
Hatton's classmates Megan
Lacy and Rebecca Mehra
both broke the tape inside the
top 20 Lacy finished in
17th and Mehra just ahead of
her in 13th.
If the young runners can
continue to perform down the
line in higher-pressure meets,
the Cardinal should definitely
be a team to watch at the
NCAA Championships.
While the men's team was
n't quite as dominant
Division II power Adams
State finished just six points
behind Stanford for the team
title the solid showing of
sophomore twins Joe and Jim
Rosa coupled with nice per
formances from redshirt sen
iors Benjamin Johnson and
Miles Unterreiner left the
Cardinal feeling good about
its season outlook.
Joe Rosa, who led the
team with a third-place finish,
was pleased with the result
especially having a difficult
year last season. "I was hop
ing to keep the individual
title in the Stanford team," he
said, "and I came up a little
bit short, but you know
everything we do in the sea
son is working towards get
ting better at the end so
hopefully the next couple
meets I'll have a little
stronger finish and have my
best result at nationals."
"This year is kind of a
rebound year for me; last year
was pretty disappointing. This
year I feel so much more con
fident and I think when I get
into a big race I'll be more

ready than I was last year," he
said.
Running together for
about the first five km of the
race, Stanford had nine run
ners inside the first 30, with
Unterreiner in fourth,
Johnson in sixth, Jim Rosa in
ninth and freshman Thomas
Graham in 14th.
If Rosa and Johnson can
stay healthy after injuries
plagued them last season, the
Cardinal stands a good

chance to return to Terre
Haute, Ind., for the NCAA
Championships and at least a
shot at upsetting No. 1
Wisconsin or No. 2 Oklahoma
State for what has been the
elusive NCAA team title.
Stanford is out of action
until Oct. 12, when it heads to
Madison for the prestigious
Wisconsin Invitational.
