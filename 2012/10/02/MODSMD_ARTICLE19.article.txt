# Superstition yields to no man, or fan
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Dear Stanford community,
I don't know how to say
this. I screwed up. I'm
deeply sorry. We all
knew that this was the
year. Somehow, we'd found a quarter
back to more or less substitute for the
absent Andrew Luck. Somehow we'd
managed to win against USC and we
were going to do the same against
Notre Dame and Oregon. Somehow
the unthinkable the impossible
was going to happen, Stanford football
was heading unbeaten to the national
championship game.
So what happened? It wasn't mere
ly a case of Washington exposing our
weaknesses on Thursday night, of an
inexperienced and untested offense
being found out, or even of ludicrous
dreams and expectations built on three
lucky results. Deep down I know I
brought this on us.

I watched every single minute of
the difficult opening day of the season
against San Jose State. I was back at
Stanford Stadium for the Duke game,
lasting until the final second of a con
test that was over by halftime. And I
lost my voice cheering on the Cardinal
against USC before rushing the field in
giddy, childlike excitement.
The Washington game? I didn't
watch a single play. I didn't shout or
cheer and I wasn't even wearing a sin
gle cardinal-colored item.
I do have an excuse I was cover
ing the women's soccer team's destruc
tion of Oregon State for this very news
paper — but even the requirements of
journalistic integrity and impartiality
shouldn't get me off the hook.
A physics graduate and an engi
neering PhD student, I realize of
course how completely illogical this all
is; that the support of just one lone fan
out of tens or evens hundreds of thou
sands of Cardinal faithful can't make or
break a result. Especially since, howev
er loud I'd have yelled, no one would
have heard me hundreds of miles north
in Seattle. But sports aren't logical.
Deciding to watch a handful of athletes
run around a grassy field for hours
every weekend when you could be
doing something worthwhile like
working to end poverty or cure cancer
is not a cold, rational choice.
Real fans believe they don't care
about useless facts, they know their
support counts. They know that those
little superstitions and game-day rou
tines can make the crucial difference.
From relatively harmless ones like
wearing a lucky shirt or crossing your
fingers ahead of a crucial play, to those
life-defining and life-destroying ones
that inspire Hollywood movies.
When your team wins, nothing real
ly matters, but when it loses, and when
that coincides with an unusual break in
your routine, it begs the question: Did I
change something? Could my inconse
quential actions have been magnified
by the butterfly effect of sports to
doom my team?
The cruel reality of college football
is that, unlike in the forgiving world of
the NFL, a single loss almost certainly
destroys any dreams of season great
ness.
The elusive and unrealistic specter
of the national title is gone, but there is
still reason to hope. Shock loss or not,
the Cardinal football program is in
rude health, and though a third-straight
BCS bowl now seems unlikely, it is not
yet mathematically impossible. The
Pac-12 Championship game and the
Rose Bowl could still be reached with a
healthy does of luck not Luck
and hard work. Washington is almost
certain to lose to Oregon this weekend
and USC the next. If the Trojans can
defeat the Ducks in LA at the begin
ning of November then everything
might just come down to Stanford's
trip to Corvallis two weeks later. It
would be a mighty upset, but this pro
gram has history with those.

I don't know
how to say
this. I
screwed up.
I'm deeply
sorry.
And I've learnt my lesson. I
will be at every home game this
season from kick-off until the
game clock runs dead, continu
ing this Saturday against
Arizona. I may even be at most
of the remaining road games,
starting with Notre Dame the
following weekend and finish
ing with UCLA two months

from now.
I will not just be dressed in a
Red Zone shirt and my lucky
Stanford baseball cap, but am
now in the possession of a No.
33 jersey too unimaginative
ly, my favorite player on the
field in senior running back
Stepfan Taylor, not simply
because he is great at what he
does, but also because I can
unconvincingly claim that we
must be distant relatives.
Superstition or not, if there is
any difference that I can make,
anything that might get that ball

over the line from up there in
the stands, consider it made.

If you don't believe that Tom
Taylor is as superstitious as they
come, take in a Redding "foot
ball" game with him as he curls
up in his Redding FC snuggie,
drinks from his favorite mug
with his left hand every 13
mintues and roars like a lion
every time him squad gets a
throw-in. Email him at

watch a single play. I didn't shout or
cheer and I wasn't even wearing a sin
gle cardinal-colored item.
I do have an excuse I was cover
ing the women's soccer team's destruc
tion of Oregon State for this very news
paper — but even the requirements of
journalistic integrity and impartiality
shouldn't get me off the hook.
A physics graduate and an engi
neering PhD student, I realize of
course how completely illogical this all
is; that the support of just one lone fan
out of tens or evens hundreds of thou
sands of Cardinal faithful can't make or
break a result. Especially since, howev
er loud I'd have yelled, no one would
have heard me hundreds of miles north
in Seattle. But sports aren't logical.
Deciding to watch a handful of athletes
run around a grassy field for hours
every weekend when you could be
doing something worthwhile like
working to end poverty or cure cancer
is not a cold, rational choice.
Real fans believe they don't care
about useless facts, they know their
support counts. They know that those
little superstitions and game-day rou
tines can make the crucial difference.
From relatively harmless ones like
wearing a lucky shirt or crossing your
fingers ahead of a crucial play, to those
life-defining and life-destroying ones
that inspire Hollywood movies.
When your team wins, nothing real
ly matters, but when it loses, and when
that coincides with an unusual break in
your routine, it begs the question: Did I
change something? Could my inconse
quential actions have been magnified
by the butterfly effect of sports to
doom my team?
The cruel reality of college football
is that, unlike in the forgiving world of
the NFL, a single loss almost certainly
destroys any dreams of season great
ness.
The elusive and unrealistic specter
of the national title is gone, but there is
still reason to hope. Shock loss or not,
the Cardinal football program is in
rude health, and though a third-straight
BCS bowl now seems unlikely, it is not
yet mathematically impossible. The
Pac-12 Championship game and the
Rose Bowl could still be reached with a
healthy does of luck not Luck
and hard work. Washington is almost
certain to lose to Oregon this weekend
and USC the next. If the Trojans can
defeat the Ducks in LA at the begin
ning of November then everything
might just come down to Stanford's
trip to Corvallis two weeks later. It
would be a mighty upset, but this pro
gram has history with those.

I don't know
how to say
this. I
screwed up.
I'm deeply
sorry.
And I've learnt my lesson. I
will be at every home game this
season from kick-off until the
game clock runs dead, continu
ing this Saturday against
Arizona. I may even be at most
of the remaining road games,
starting with Notre Dame the
following weekend and finish
ing with UCLA two months

from now.
I will not just be dressed in a
Red Zone shirt and my lucky
Stanford baseball cap, but am
now in the possession of a No.
33 jersey too unimaginative
ly, my favorite player on the
field in senior running back
Stepfan Taylor, not simply
because he is great at what he
does, but also because I can
unconvincingly claim that we
must be distant relatives.
Superstition or not, if there is
any difference that I can make,
anything that might get that ball

over the line from up there in
the stands, consider it made.

If you don't believe that Tom

come, take in a Redding "foot

up in his Redding FC snuggie,

Dear Stanford community,
I don't know how to say
this. I screwed up. I'm
deeply sorry. We all
knew that this was the
year. Somehow, we'd found a quarter
back to more or less substitute for the
absent Andrew Luck. Somehow we'd
managed to win against USC and we
were going to do the same against
Notre Dame and Oregon. Somehow
the unthinkable the impossible
was going to happen, Stanford football
was heading unbeaten to the national
championship game.
So what happened? It wasn't mere
ly a case of Washington exposing our
weaknesses on Thursday night, of an
inexperienced and untested offense
being found out, or even of ludicrous
dreams and expectations built on three
lucky results. Deep down I know I
brought this on us.

I watched every single minute of
the difficult opening day of the season
against San Jose State. I was back at
Stanford Stadium for the Duke game,
lasting until the final second of a con
test that was over by halftime. And I
lost my voice cheering on the Cardinal
against USC before rushing the field in
giddy, childlike excitement.
The Washington game? I didn't
watch a single play. I didn't shout or
cheer and I wasn't even wearing a sin
gle cardinal-colored item.
