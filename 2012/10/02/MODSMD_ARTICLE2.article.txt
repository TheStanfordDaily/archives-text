# FULL MOON 2012
## What to expect when you're expecting 
### CARLO PASCO 
I'm really not sure exactly
what I was expecting. I had
been to two Full Moons
before, both of which were
more or less the same, so the
early money was on "not expecting
much."

But this is senior year the one
time it's more or less okay to be
naked and ask a freshman to make
out, while you're simultaneously
trying to figure out what dorm she's
in so you can cross off "Wilbur" on
a Bingo card. All in the name of,
you know, tradition.

And what a tradition it is.
Nudity. Body paint. DJ Lumo. It's
great and all, but as a senior, I was
getting tired of it. The thing about
traditions is that, by definition,
they're more or less the same thing
every year. Think how downright
un-American it would be to eat
salmon and watch rugby on
Thanksgiving. I have an uncle who
would go into conniptions at the
thought, and he wasn't even raised
in America. People get attached to
traditions.
So things went on as usual. The
lead up to FMOTQ wasn't all that
different from any other Stanford
function just with a bit more
body paint. Talks of what rally gear
to wear echoed down the cramped
jk hallways and questions like
"When should we start?" and
jjK "Who has the bottle opener?"

made this oft-changing, yet annual
event all the more familiar to me.
There's nothing like a Stanford tra
dition to make you feel like a fresh
man again.
If you're unfamiliar with Full
Moon, it goes something like this:
Hark! The clock strikes mid
night, as the devilishly handsome
senior locks eyes with an innocent,
yet mature and worldly looking
freshman.
Music thumps to the beats of
their collective heart as they glide,
seemingly effortlessly, through the
throng of people, around the Tree
and into each other's open arms.
An embrace.
A caress of the chin.
Yearning for affection, and quite
uninhibited, set free by the expecta
tions of upholding this time honored
tradition (and perhaps the smallest

encouragement from previous liba
tions), he...
... invites her back to his room,
and they spend the night talking, get
ting to know each other... each
other's hopes... each other's
dreams.
Nah, just kidding, they totally
make out.
But such is tradition. This wasn't
my first rodeo; I knew more or less
what to expect: The Band. The
mouthwash. The body parts.
Everything followed the script
of years past. We rolled out in a
group, met the Band in White Plaza
and danced. After a cursory inspec
tion of our IDs, we moved toward
the tables and stuffed fistfuls of
candy and condoms into our pock
ets. You never know.

Hordes of people of varying
states of undress stood around and

waited ever awkwardly for the large
projector to count down to mid
night, presumably so they could
"get their mack on." I saw several of
my friends naked and painted, casu
ally maintaining eye contact the
whole time. These are people I've
had class with, I've shared meals
with, even my little freshmen from
when I was an RA last year.
Eye contact is key.
But I wasn't surprised. I knew
what was coming. I knew about the
