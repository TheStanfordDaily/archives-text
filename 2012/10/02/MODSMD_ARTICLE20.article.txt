## Sober monitoring at Full Moon on the Quad 
### â€“ Marianne Levine 
A total of 80 undergradu
ates were sober moni
tors at Full Moon on
the Quad (FMOTQ)
2012. According to
Sophomore Class President Malika
Mehrota 'l5, sober monitors are
supposed to encourage students to
have fun, while staying sober
throughout the event. Mehrota
views sober monitors as an exam
ple of members of the Stanford
community "looking out for each
other." She emphasized the sober
monitors would be a resource
throughout the night and would be
there to ensure students do not
feel a need to drink in order to
enjoy the event.
The Daily spoke to three sober
monitors, Kimberly Bacon 'l5,
Natalya Thakur 'l5 and Monica
Dey 'l5, before the event.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
made you decide to be a sober
monitor?
Natalya Thakur (NT): I really
wanted to help the cabinet out and
make sure that I could be of any
help, especially to our younger
classmen. FMOTQ can be a bit
intimidating if you've never done
anything like it before.
Kimberly Bacon (KB): This is my
second year as a sober monitor. I
was a sober monitor for Frosh
Council last year. Since Frosh
Council hasn't been elected yet,
since Full Moon is so early, the
sophomore class presidents asked
that former Frosh Council mem
bers step in and help out.
TSD:What are you most looking
forward to at FMOTQ?
NT All the crazy bingo t-shirts
that people are making and of
course the great music.
KB: I'm really looking forward to
the concert and the burrito bash.
I'm also really excited to see the
freshmen interact, since they've
only been at Stanford for a few
weeks. It'll also be a good way to
reflect on my freshman year expe
rience.
TSD: How did you find out about
being a sober monitor?
NT: Through the ASSU. I'm on the
Sophomore Cabinet so for us, it's
widely advertised.

Monica Dey (MD): I am a mem
ber of Sophomore Cabinet, so I
am required to be a sober monitor.
However, I truly think that this is a
great way to help out with one of
Stanford's greatest traditions and
make sure everyone has a fun, safe
time. I even recruited about ten of
my friends to be sober monitors..
. and I'm sure the cool tanks were
only part of the reason they
agreed.
TSD: What are your responsibili
ties as a sober monitor?
NT: To roam around and make
sure everyone is comfortable. I
think the best thing we can do is be
aware of our surroundings, hang
out on the side and save the day if
need be. I think it's also important
for us to show the people who do
not want to participate in making
out that you can still have fun.
MD: The role of sober monitoring
this year is to be a visible, social
presence, alleviating the fears and
hesitation of the freshmen and
showing that you don't have to be
blacked out to have an awesome
time at Full Moon. We don't want
to be the police and ruin people's
fun, but we are also there to ensure
that people get help ... if they
need it.
KB: There are a lot of various
responsibilities. I am sober, and
look after those who are intoxicat
ed, check in with them and see if
they need help from the staff. I
also check IDs and make sure the
crowds aren't too large. We also
help clean up after the event and
make sure the event is running
smoothly throughout the night.
TSD: Is there anything you are not
looking forward to?
NT: The possibility of someone
getting hospitalized would be hor
rifying, especially since this is an
event the Sophomore Cabinet and
class puts on for the entire univer
sity.
MD: I am not really looking for
ward to "care-fronting" drunk
people if necessary; I just want the
night to go smoothly and safely!
KB: It is awkward to have to inter
act with someone when they are
naked.
