Late 1800s The Full Moor on the Quad
(FMOTQ) tradition begins with senior boys and
freshman girls exchanging a kiss and a rose at
midnight on the Quad.
Until 1980s In the decades prior to 1980, it
was common for FMOTQ to include dinners,
dances and bands but the event began to lose
its structure and formality in the 'Bos.
1989 Senior class presidents Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'B9 and Preston Hammer 'B9 decide to
make FMOTQ "classier" by incorporating
elements such as champagne and
orchestras. L
2003 An infamous year for FMOTQ: Five
hospitalizations, one arrest for driving under
the influence and one arrest for public intoxica
tion lead University officials to consider shut
ting down the event entirely in the future.
2004 The University decides to let the event
continue but exerts more control and restric
tions. Warnings against excessive drinking are
given out, more police forces dispatched and
only Stanford students allowed admittance. An
initiative called Absolute Fun promotes non
alcoholic alternatives.
2009 FMOTQ cancelled due to the outbreak of
swine flu. The event resumed in 2010.
