## Rice urges political reform 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
Former Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice spoke Monday
morning about the multifaceted
nature of Chinese-U.S. relations.
Rice emphasized that economic,
military and diplomatic relations
between the two states hinge upon
domestic political reform in China
at this critical juncture of possible
leadership transitions in both
countries.
The event, titled "Finding the
Balance in a New Era: Dynamics
of the U.S.-China Relationship,"

was hosted by the Forum for
American Chinese Exchange
(FACES) and filled the Bechtel
Conference Center in Encina Flail
with a crowd largely composed of
students.

Rice, a professor of political sci
ence and former University
provost, began by challenging a
mentality that can dominate inter
national relations.

"There is a tendency in foreign
policy to want to have a very sim
ple way of thinking about every
relationship," she said. "It's either

an alliance, a relationship of
friends or an adversarial one."

Criticizing this propensity,
Rice explained the danger of
"zero-sum" views of complex
relationships, despite the
"comforting" nature of these
characterizations. Citing the
example of the six-party talks
on North Korean nuclear
nonproliferation, in which
China was a party she pointed
out that relations between
large, opposing powers did
not have to be adversarial.

Pivoting to the nuances of
U.S.-Chinese economic rela
tions, Rice discussed the inter
nal economic policies of the
Chinese government. Citing
aggressive Chinese expansion
into developing markets,
undue advantages granted to
domestic firms and allega

tions of currency manipula
tion, she argued that the
Chinese were posturing
against U.S. interests.
"There is a feeling that...
China [is] on an uneven play
ing field, vis-a-vis foreign
competition," she said.
Indeed, Rice said that the
"the hope had been for a
much more cooperative [eco
nomic] framework to have
emerged" than the status quo.
"We saw the ... bullet
train of the Chinese economy,"
Rice said, explaining the opti
mism behind China's rapid
growth and entry into the
World Trade Organization.
"But whether [China] will
grow in a cooperative environ
ment is to be seen."
Finally, Rice declared that
the last main determinant of
Sino-American relations is
domestic Chinese political
behavior. She explained that
the political repression and
opaque rule of law that char
acterize the Chinese state

must be reformed.
"If you want to be an
international economy, you
can't tell people to think at
work, but not at home," she
said.
But she also compliment
ed China for recent advances
in poverty alleviation and
economic development. As
China continues to grow, Rice
warned of potential "political
stresses and strains," because
of the rigidity and hierarchy
of the political system.
She pointed out that the
current Chinese govern
ment's legitimacy is becoming
increasingly tenuous, as it has
been largely built upon grow
ing wealth and rising stan
dards of living.
"Legitimacy based on
prosperity is really, really hard
to maintain because expecta
tions are always increasing,"
she said. "Legitimacy based
on consent must [come to
China] soon."
To conclude, Rice took

questions from the audience
on topics that ranged from
drone strikes to North
Korean diplomacy. She often
reached back into past experi
ence as secretary of state, but
also as a girl growing up in the
segregated South. Shying
away from the political arena,
Rice did not mention the pos
sible ramifications of the
upcoming U.S. elections and
how different candidates
would approach the chal
lenges of Chinese foreign pol
icy.
She closed her talk by
offering a word of advice to
the Chinese, albeit one omi
nous in tone.
"My hope is that the [new
Chinese] Party Congress will
present a reform agenda that
is a real reform agenda," she
said. "Every leader that waits
too long ends up like
Mubarak."
