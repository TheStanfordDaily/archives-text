## Overseas seminars bolster class offerings for 2013 Applications for summer 2013 seminars in eight countries close Oct. 21 
### CARA REICHARD STAFF WRITER 
The Bing Overseas Studies Program's (BOSP)
newly reintroduced Stanford Overseas Seminars are
here to stay, according to Naoko Sakata, BOSP
external programs coordinator.
"We are scheduled to offer seminars for foresee
able future years," Sakata wrote in an email to The
Daily.
According to Sakata, funding has been approved
for the eight 2013 summer seminars in Vienna, Rio
de Janeiro, Costa Rica, Israel, India, the Republic of
Palau, Madagascar and Wales.
BOSP offered three more seminars than last year
and only two fewer than the peak number of ten
seminars in years previous to the 2010-2011 hiatus.
A total of 460 students applied for 75 available
spots last year, according to BOSP Enrollment
Services Coordinator Alyssa Geiger. This year 120
spots are available.
The Overseas Seminars, three-week two-unit
courses open to undergraduates, were put on hold in
2010 due to budgets cuts. Following a two-year hia
tus, five seminars were held in India, Turkey,
Tanzania, the Netherlands and Brazil last summer.
Each seminar is limited to 12 to 15 students and costs
$6OO, covering lodging, meals and course activities
but not transportation and incidental costs.
Robert Siegel, associate professor of microbiolo
gy and immunology, who led this year's Issues of
Development in Northern Tanzania seminar, was
disappointed when the program was cancelled three
years ago but expected the cut.
"I was always surprised it existed," Siegel said.
"It's much cheaper to teach a big class."
Siegel led two trips prior to the program's hiatus
the same one to Tanzania in 2006 and a trip to
England to follow the path of Darwin's life.
BOSP offers the seminars to provide a study
abroad opportunity for students who are not neces
sarily able to fit a full quarter-length overseas trip
into their undergraduate schedule, according to
Sakata.
"Overseas Seminars are specifically designed to
integrate course content and location," she said.
Thomas Hansen, an anthropology professor who
led his first Overseas Seminar this year in India this
year, echoed this sentiment.
"The place you go is not just the site where you
take your courses the course is about that place,"
Hansen said.
"I feel like I learned more during those three
weeks on-site than I did from years of reading arti
cles," said Lananh Le 'l5, a participant in the
Tanzania seminar who described it as her "greatest
experience at Stanford so far."
"You get to be completely immersed in the place
and its culture for three weeks, and have a hands-on
experience with the subject that you are exploring,"
Le added.
Each year, the selection of seminars covers a wide
variety of topics. Their unifying feature is the level of
engagement they draw from their participants, Siegel
said.
"They're all radically different except for this
mode of learning, this engagement of students and
faculty."

Hansen's seminar, Minority as Cultural Form in
South Asia, was intended to introduce students to
the "cultural diversity and complexity in India."
"Most people in India experience life as being
one form of minority or another, whether byway of
religion, caste, whatever," Hansen said. "It's impor
tant to understand what that culture is all about."
Hansen will be offering this same seminar again

in the summer of 2013 and hopes it becomes a regu
lar class in the Bing program.
The application deadline for summer 2013
Overseas Seminars is Oct. 21, a full quarter earlier
than last year's Jan. 29 deadline. Selection results will
be released on Nov. 16.
