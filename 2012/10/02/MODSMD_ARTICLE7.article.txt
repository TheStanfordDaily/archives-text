### DAILY NEWS STAFF Alice Phillips 
A man who threatened to
blow up a home in the 3700
block of Klamath Lane near
Highway 101 has been
detained and placed in a psy
chiatric hold, according to
statements from the Palo Alto
Police.
Officers first responded to
a report just before noon that
a man near the intersection of
West Bayshore Road and
Adobe Creek wanted to kill
himself. Further investigation
led the officers to the
Klamath Lane home. The
man is associated with the
Klamath Lane home but is
not an inhabitant.
Residents in the area were
evacuated on foot in the early
afternoon after officers
learned that the man claimed
to be in possession of explo
sives. After inspection from
the Santa Clara County Bomb
Squad, the home in question
as well as surrounding build
ings were declared safe for
residents to re-enter.
Traffic remained closed on
adjacent East Meadow Circle
for several hours after the
man was detained due to
bomb squad activity.
The man will be charged
with making criminal threats
and creating an incendiary
device, according to the Palo
Alto Police Twitter feed. After
negotiators coaxed him out of
the home, police took the man
to undergo a psychiatric
exam.
"To the evacuated resi
dents, thank you for your
patience and cooperation,"
the police tweeted at 9:21
p.m., more than nine hours
after the initial tip was
received. "We know it's been
a long afternoon and
evening."
Police used the AlertSCC
system a system similar to
AlertSU that notifies Santa
Clara County residents via
text, email or phone call in the
event of emergency —to
notify residents of the situa
tion.
