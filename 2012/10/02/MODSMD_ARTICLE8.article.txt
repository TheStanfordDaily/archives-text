# OPINIONS
## Mental Health and the Stanford Experience 
### Emily Cohodes 
At the Activities Fair last Friday,
I tabled for the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center, the peer
counseling group that operates out of
the Rogers House (call us 24/7 at 650-
723-3392). If you've tabled at the
Activities Fair before, you know that
the freshmen are not afraid to put you
on the spot. Each year I get asked
point-blank, "What would I gain from
joining the Bridge?" When I tell them
it's about the community, about help
ing people in need, they often lose
interest. They are looking for hard
facts if only I could tell them that
students who work at the Bridge have
14 percent higher starting salaries
when they graduate.
It's as if they don't know that help
ing someone suffering from anxiety
actually feels good. I always find
myself wondering what I can say to
make the most meaningful of my
Stanford experiences seem more
appealing to freshmen who are clearly
looking for what they can get out of
this, rather than what they could give
back to the community, having not yet
realized that there is almost always a
positive correlation between the two.
Typically by the end of our conversa
tion, I've managed to scare them into
signing up for emails, but the interac
tions always leave me wanting more.
Last spring, I wrote a column for
The Daily after Samantha Wopat, a
sophomore who lived in my resi
dence, took her own life. I was over
whelmed when I returned from her
memorial service and I wanted to
write a piece that lots of people would
see because I felt like it was time for
the community to finally take on
mental health issues as a whole. I was
frustrated by the fact that her death
had seemed to slip through the cracks
of a busy midterm season and that
some far-flung students living in the
boondocks of Rains or Oak Creek
may not even have known.
Looking back, I see that Sam's
death was really just the tipping point
for me, the moment that made me
commit, wholeheartedly, to doing
everything I could to make the discus
sion about Stanford's mental health
culture a campus-wide discussion, not
one that was confined to the Bridge
or certain psychology courses. My
deliberations with The Daily and the
difficulty of getting the piece pub
lished made me realize that we were
desperately lacking a forum in which
to discuss mental health issues, a safe

place where we could break down the
stereotypes of Stanford being the
happiest place on earth, hammer out
the real truth about our ducky behav
ior, and come up with real strategies
for these problems not just in the
aftermath of tragedy, but all the time.
I am writing this column to draw
some of the most pressing issues of
well-being, health, and happiness to
the surface of our campus conscience.
I hope that my weekly columns can
be an open forum, a place where we
can have a constructive dialogue
about the mental state of our campus,
and where you, the readers, will help
me shed light on both the good and
the bad of Stanford's mental health
efforts. The greatest success that I
could hope to achieve with this col
umn is to have my anecdotes or ques
tions spark conversations at dinner
tables or in the halls of freshman
dorms.
In the past three years, I have real
ized time and time again that no mat
ter whether I find myself trying to
convince students to take mental
health-themed courses, go to CAPS,
or refer a struggling friend to the
Bridge or SHPRC, Stanford students
need guidance about mental health.
Unlike algebra or writing skills, the
majority of Stanford students do not
arrive with a complete understanding
of the mental health resources avail
able to them. Students can spend a
full four years here often strug
gling through times when they would
have benefited from one of the many
initiatives that we do have without
being taught the intricacies of the
CAPS scheduling system, being
shown the little nook in Vaden where
they can get free condoms from the
SHPRC and without appreciating the
incredible work that is constantly
being done to make sure these
resources don't disappear.
I want everyone the freshmen
at the table last Friday, my neighbors
down the hall, my friends and people
I have never even met —to know
about these resources, know that they
make us different from other schools,
and join the movement to make
Stanford a healthier place. Because a
fight for the eradication of mental
health stereotypes does take a village
and luckily, we have one.

about these resources, know that they
make us different from other schools,
and join the movement to make
Stanford a healthier place. Because a
fight for the eradication of mental
health stereotypes does take a village
and luckily, we have one.

At the Activities Fair last Friday,
I tabled for the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center, the peer
counseling group that operates out of
the Rogers House (call us 24/7 at 650-
723-3392). If you've tabled at the
Activities Fair before, you know that
the freshmen are not afraid to put you
on the spot. Each year I get asked
point-blank, "What would I gain from
joining the Bridge?" When I tell them
it's about the community, about help
ing people in need, they often lose
interest. They are looking for hard
facts if only I could tell them that
students who work at the Bridge have
14 percent higher starting salaries
when they graduate.
It's as if they don't know that help
ing someone suffering from anxiety
actually feels good. I always find
myself wondering what I can say to
make the most meaningful of my
Stanford experiences seem more
appealing to freshmen who are clearly
looking for what they can get out of
this, rather than what they could give
back to the community, having not yet
realized that there is almost always a
positive correlation between the two.
Typically by the end of our conversa
tion, I've managed to scare them into
signing up for emails, but the interac
tions always leave me wanting more.
Last spring, I wrote a column for
The Daily after Samantha Wopat, a
sophomore who lived in my resi
dence, took her own life. I was over
whelmed when I returned from her
memorial service and I wanted to
write a piece that lots of people would
see because I felt like it was time for
the community to finally take on
mental health issues as a whole. I was
frustrated by the fact that her death
had seemed to slip through the cracks
of a busy midterm season and that
some far-flung students living in the
boondocks of Rains or Oak Creek
may not even have known.
Looking back, I see that Sam's
death was really just the tipping point
for me, the moment that made me
commit, wholeheartedly, to doing
everything I could to make the discus
sion about Stanford's mental health
culture a campus-wide discussion, not
one that was confined to the Bridge
or certain psychology courses. My
deliberations with The Daily and the
difficulty of getting the piece pub
lished made me realize that we were
desperately lacking a forum in which
to discuss mental health issues, a safe

place where we could break down the
stereotypes of Stanford being the
happiest place on earth, hammer out
the real truth about our ducky behav
ior, and come up with real strategies
for these problems not just in the
aftermath of tragedy, but all the time.
I am writing this column to draw
some of the most pressing issues of
well-being, health, and happiness to
the surface of our campus conscience.
I hope that my weekly columns can
be an open forum, a place where we
can have a constructive dialogue
about the mental state of our campus,
and where you, the readers, will help
me shed light on both the good and
the bad of Stanford's mental health
efforts. The greatest success that I
could hope to achieve with this col
umn is to have my anecdotes or ques
tions spark conversations at dinner
tables or in the halls of freshman
dorms.
In the past three years, I have real
ized time and time again that no mat
ter whether I find myself trying to
convince students to take mental
health-themed courses, go to CAPS,
or refer a struggling friend to the
Bridge or SHPRC, Stanford students
need guidance about mental health.
Unlike algebra or writing skills, the
majority of Stanford students do not
arrive with a complete understanding
of the mental health resources avail
able to them. Students can spend a
full four years here often strug
gling through times when they would
have benefited from one of the many
initiatives that we do have without
being taught the intricacies of the
CAPS scheduling system, being
shown the little nook in Vaden where
they can get free condoms from the
SHPRC and without appreciating the
incredible work that is constantly
being done to make sure these
resources don't disappear.
I want everyone the freshmen
at the table last Friday, my neighbors
down the hall, my friends and people
I have never even met —to know
about these resources, know that they
make us different from other schools,
and join the movement to make
Stanford a healthier place. Because a
fight for the eradication of mental
health stereotypes does take a village
and luckily, we have one.
