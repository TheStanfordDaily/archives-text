# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
We were disappointed to read
the editorial "When the
wind of freedom falters,"
published on September 27,2012. To
be clear, we welcome varied opin
ions, open discourse, and disagree
ment; the editorial, however, con
tained inaccurate information. In
particular, it misrepresented the
responsibilities of Residential and
Dining Enterprises (R&DE) and
Residential Education (ResEd).

R&DE on behalf of the
University, provides leadership,
administrative and fiscal oversight
for assigning and housing both grad
uate and undergraduate students,
residential dining programs, and
other auxiliary enterprises. These
other auxiliary enterprises, which
help to reduce student room and
board rates, include: R&DE retail
cafes, athletic concessions, guest
house lodging, catering and execu
tive services, campus vending, and
on-campus meeting planning and
conference programs. R&DE pro
vides these services with a special
emphasis on life safety and security,
asset renewal, building maintenance
and stewardship, capital renovations
and improvements, sustainability,
and nutrition and wellness educa
tion. R&DE also provides resources

that support the living and learning
infrastructure and residential pro
grams.

ResEd, part of the Student
Affairs division, works with resident
fellows, student and professional
staff, student crises, residential and
University policies and residential
programs. The student management
programs in Row houses, Row and
Suites kitchens, and Row board
plans are facilitated by Residential
Education. Additionally, alcohol
education and policy are under the
purview of Student Affairs and
ResEd, not R&DE.
Student initiative, creativity and
expression are hallmarks of the
Stanford undergraduate experience,
as is holding ourselves to the highest
standard. We are committed to pro
viding diverse and dynamic living
and learning environments, which
are integral to the student experi
ence and we take our roles as stew
ards of student life on this campus
very seriously.
