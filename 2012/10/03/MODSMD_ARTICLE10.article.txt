## Why I Don't Have a Smartphone 
### Adam Johnson 
Before school began this year,l
was on track for buying my
first smartphone. I had an old
school Nokia flip phone that was
usable but falling apart. The AT&T
store only offered three "new" flip
phone models, and they were all
bulkier and less attractive than my
Nokia. There were plenty of smart
phones to choose from, and many
sans data plan would have been
virtually free. Almost all my friends
had converted to smartphones at
some point; maybe it was my time,
too.
Although I knew maintaining a
smartphone would be expensive,
when I was at the AT&T store and
was told exactly how much one
would cost, my enthusiasm chilled
considerably. I could afford it, but
were the proposed benefits of a
smartphone really worth hundreds
of dollars a year? I left the store
empty-handed, intending to think
things over for a couple days.
Ultimately, I figured that I could
get by fine with my Nokia. And per
haps my life is better without a
smartphone. Let's examine some sit
uations where a smartphone is sup
posedly beneficial. I often find
myself in thrift stores wanting to get
a better sense of an item's value.
With a smartphone, I can just consult
Google. Without one, I will call a

family member or friend who has
Internet access. It's always good to
have a chat with those close to you,
even if just for a minute.
Or take this summer, when I
found myself lost wandering the
streets of European towns and
cities. With a smartphone, I would
open a GPS app and continue on.
Without one, I had to ask strangers
for directions. Everyone helped me
some told me about interesting
places to check out along the way,
others started up conversations that
lasted anywhere from a couple min
utes to many hours. And when I
actually needed Internet access, I
would find an Internet cafe and
restrict my time on the web to only
the most essential tasks. I didn't
travel to another continent to visit
ESPN.com, after all.
These are just a few instances
where, if I had the latest technology,
I would have missed out on valuable
human interactions. Over time, if I
forego enough of these opportuni
ties, might my overall ability to inter
act with people diminish? There is an
abundance of research, for instance,
on how modern technologies under
mine fundamental human traits like
empathy. Often, this effect is subtle.
Complicating matters is the fact that
we are rarely, if ever, far enough
removed from modern technologies

to realize how they transform us. It
took me a summer without a com
puter to realize that, whenever I am
in a room with a laptop and Internet
connection, my life changes. I stay
inside more, I go to bed later, I read
fewer books, I am not as willing to
socialize with others. Cable TV has
the same effect, and having quick
access to both devices at home is
nightmarish.

My laptop broke before coming
to Stanford, and I almost didn't buy
a new one for these very reasons
(not to mention that the cluster com
puters are more than adequate).
And yet, I bought an HP. Why? I
don't even know. I am certain my life
would have been more fulfilling
without one. Of course, the technolo
gies I've listed can foster interper
sonal communication, too. Perhaps
the best strategy is moderation, yet
in practice this is difficult to achieve.
If I were to purchase a smartphone, I
worry that I might recognize the
ways in which it is negatively affect
ing my life, but ultimately I would be
addicted, unable to act on that real
ization. That is why for now
I'm a proud owner of a Nokia 6350.
