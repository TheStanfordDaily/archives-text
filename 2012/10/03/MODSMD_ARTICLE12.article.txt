# OFFBFAT ANN OVERHEARD
## What Are You Listening To? 
### Renee Donovan 
The beginning of the year can be
fraught with self-consciousness
and anxiety around first
impressions, yet older and wiser peo
ple tell me that everyone is just as
insecure as I am.
Anyone who uses iTunes is famil
iar with the idea that there are the
playlists you turn on when your
friends are over, and then there are
the Top 25 Most Played in your
music library. All those cool people
are likely not blasting their Top 25
Most Played for all to hear. So I did
some snooping around on the
Home Sharing feature of iTunes in
different spots on campus. Sorry for
being a huge creep I was curious.
I wanted to confirm that I wasn't the
only one listening to music that
doesn't fit the criteria of hip, indie,
unreleased, or throwback. And I
want to reassure you that you are
not the only one who might choose
Britney Spears over Mumford &
Sons.
I found a lot of ABBA, Phish,
and Norah Jones. I found playlists
transparently named "Boy Bands,"
or "Sweaty," as well as many dedi
cated to friends or "For Mom and
Dad." I was surprised to find that
almost everyone makes seasonal
playlists, and playlists that define
shorter windows in time like "Going
to College." Again and again near
the top of students' Top 25 I found
"Hey Soul Sister," by Train; "Wagon
Wheel," by Old Crow Medicine
Show; "Sleepyhead," by Passion Pit;
"Mary Jane's Last Dance," by Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers; and
my favorite, "I Can Show You the
World," by... Disney?
Not what I expected. Music is a
language of cadences, susurrus, and
compound time, one that defies
logic, convention and grammar. It
makes for incongruous and inexpli
cable musical preferences. My high
school peers worshipped the Hyphy
movement and adored Zion I's
lyrics "wake up, gunshots in the
city." It was a private high school
where no gunshots were ever fired.
The only thing that connects my
privileged, mostly white high school
to the struggles in Zion I songs is the
Bay Bridge connecting San
Francisco to Oakland. Yet we still
choose E-40, Mac Dre, Andre
Nickatina, and Keak da Sneak over
Adele. Likely because it's comfort
ing to hear the lyrics you heard

when you were sixteen. Or the Van
Morrison album your parents
played when you were twelve, or the
Aladdin tunes you loved when you
were five.

So what explains the songs
Stanford students turn on at the end
of the day? If Tom Petty and Train
are on a Stanford student's sound
track, we must be a pretty nostalgic
bunch. "I don't want to miss a single
thing you do tonight." "I feel sum
mer creepin' in." "I gotta get a move
on before the sun." The lyrics
thrumming in the background
evoke a sense of time rushing by,
and nostalgia for the moment that
has just passed. "Everything is going
to the beat." And it feels like that
beat is clicking along too quickly on
the college metronome. "Take me as
I come, 'cause I can't stay long." You
get the picture.
I admit this investigation isn't up
to Stanford standards. It was brief,
casual, and only considered a tiny
sample size. Still, it's a relief stop
worrying if your music is hip enough
and blast the songs that are over
played, or politically incorrect, or
plain awful, just because they make
you feel good. It can be a challenge
to feel like a cohesive person when
you leave the life of childhood
friends and family dinners and start
a life of new people and new rou
tines. It can be hard to trace a thread
that connects the person you are at
Stanford to the person you were at
thirteen. Maybe those are two differ
ent people, and it is best they remain
disconnected. Or maybe you can
bridge the gap by turning on some
Outkast.
My goal this year is to offer you,
in columns and blog posts, as close as
I can get to an accurate take on stu
dent opinion on campus. I aim to
respectfully expose real moments
from students' lives (encounters, con
versations, emails, schedules, to-do
lists, etc.) to discuss the less visible
undertow of student behavior at
Stanford. I hope you will join me by
emailing me what you see and hear
of interest on campus, and I will do
my best not to step on anyone's toes.
In the meantime, let some of the
stress about first impressions go, and
keep blasting those uncool jams.
