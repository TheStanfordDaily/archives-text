## SENIOR SIT DOWN Q&A WITH BECKY DRU 
### George Chen 
Senior Becky Dru was a
First Team Ail-American
last year, and this year she
captains the No. 14
Stanford field hockey
team as it looks to make the NCAA
Tournament for the first time in
three years. The Stanford Daily sat
down with the Buckinghamshire,
England native to talk all things
British, Stanford and field hockey.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
really attracted you to Stanford, and
what is about this place that you
have enjoyed the most as you look
back on your experience.
Becky Dru: That's a difficult ques

tion. What attracted me here was
really when I turned up and the
facilities and the place was just out
of this world. I come from a pretty
small town in England, where the
facilities are decent, but not nearly
as amazing as Stanford. And then
you get the academics and the peo
ple involved in the mix and you start
to think that it could be a good place
to be for four years. Since I've been
here, the connections with faculty,
friends, coaches, the whole mix of
people really makes a difference.

TSD: Coming to school in the
United States from England has
been a big step. Was that some
thing you spent of a lot of time

considering?
Dru: Actually, it was something I did
n't really think about until my senior
year of high school. There was a let
ter asking if I had ever considered
studying in the US, and I said no, but
that I'd like to. So I just went through
and filled out some forms, and then
started realizing it was a very real
possibility coming out here. I'll be
going back to study medicine in the
UK, but the four years was definitely
worthwhile. The life experience I've
had here has made a real difference
in what I can bring to medical school
and life back home.
TSD: What has been the biggest

adjustment to the culture here in
America.
Dru: Probably the scale of things. In
England everything's a bit smaller.
You walk to school, go to the shop
'round the corner, walk your dog in
the park and meet everyone you
know. Whereas here you have to
drive to the big city, you have to go
into big supermarkets just to get
some fruit. Everything's on a much
bigger scale. I don't know if that
makes any sense but it's all a bit
more grand. Like the Grand
Canyon is a big deal here, where at
home its Stonehenge, which is about
