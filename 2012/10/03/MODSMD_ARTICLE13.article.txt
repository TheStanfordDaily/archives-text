## SENIOR SIT DOWN Q&A WITH BECKY DRU 
### George Chen 
Senior Becky Dru was a
First Team Ail-American
last year, and this year she
captains the No. 14
Stanford field hockey
team as it looks to make the NCAA
Tournament for the first time in
three years. The Stanford Daily sat
down with the Buckinghamshire,
England native to talk all things
British, Stanford and field hockey.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
really attracted you to Stanford, and
what is about this place that you
have enjoyed the most as you look
back on your experience.
Becky Dru: That's a difficult ques

tion. What attracted me here was
really when I turned up and the
facilities and the place was just out
of this world. I come from a pretty
small town in England, where the
facilities are decent, but not nearly
as amazing as Stanford. And then
you get the academics and the peo
ple involved in the mix and you start
to think that it could be a good place
to be for four years. Since I've been
here, the connections with faculty,
friends, coaches, the whole mix of
people really makes a difference.

TSD: Coming to school in the
United States from England has
been a big step. Was that some
thing you spent of a lot of time

considering?
Dru: Actually, it was something I did
n't really think about until my senior
year of high school. There was a let
ter asking if I had ever considered
studying in the US, and I said no, but
that I'd like to. So I just went through
and filled out some forms, and then
started realizing it was a very real
possibility coming out here. I'll be
going back to study medicine in the
UK, but the four years was definitely
worthwhile. The life experience I've
had here has made a real difference
in what I can bring to medical school
and life back home.
TSD: What has been the biggest

adjustment to the culture here in
America.
Dru: Probably the scale of things. In
England everything's a bit smaller.
You walk to school, go to the shop
'round the corner, walk your dog in
the park and meet everyone you
know. Whereas here you have to
drive to the big city, you have to go
into big supermarkets just to get
some fruit. Everything's on a much
bigger scale. I don't know if that
makes any sense but it's all a bit
more grand. Like the Grand
Canyon is a big deal here, where at
home its Stonehenge, which is about

Senior Becky Dru is a two-time NorPac Defensive Player of the Year, a three-time All-NorPac First Team honoree and was an NFHCA First
Team All-American last season for the Stanford field hockey team. The English native is second on the team in points this year with 11.
one-fiftieth the size.
TSD: Big into field hockey.
Dru: In Europe in general
field hockey is a lot bigger for
both men and women. But
here, women's field hockey
especially is really taking off.
US made it to the Olympics
this past summer, and its real
ly becoming a sport that
young girls at school can look
up to and forward to partici
pating in. Men at home play
and it's quite a tough sport,
and here it's like, "men play
field hockey?"
TSD: Alright, what has been
your favorite class at
Stanford?
Dru: Well can I have two?
TSD: Yes, ok you can have
two.
Dru: Ok great. Well at the
moment I'm taking a class
called Critical Issues in Child
Health. It's Humbio and all
about child health and all the
kinds of things that can go
wrong in children. The profes
sor's amazing and it's basical

ly made me think of pedi
atrics as a future career. The
other is an intro seminar I
took as a junior, which is a lit
tle strange, but it was taught
by a med school professor
who basically presented case
studies from people who
came into the ICU, and you
got to discover what was
wrong with the patient, and
how you would go about
treating it, which is exactly
what I want to do.
TSD: Like House?
Dru: Yes! Kind of like House,
exactly! Maybe a little less
complex.
TSD: You mentioned medical
school. What about field
hockey? Are you considering
playing after you graduate?
Dru: College is not the end of
the road. When I go home I'll
be playing for a club, and
hopefully trying to make a run
at the national team. Here it's
kind of a strange thing, people
stopping playing at age 22
when your prime is not until
later. At the Olympics the
average age is 26,27 so to stop
before that is pretty crazy.
TSD: You've accomplished
quite a lot in three years ath
letically, but what are you try
ing to do on the field and with

your team as a senior?
Dru: This year is sort of
more about getting the most
out of it, in terms of fulfill
ment. While we're obviously
making runs at making the
NCAA Tournament, making
a run in that, making the
Final Four, that sort of thing
quantifiably that's what
were trying to do. But on a
personal level, its my final
year at a place that I love
with teammates that I love,
and I just want to have the
best experience I possibly
can. If that involves winning
everything, that'd be great; if
not, it shouldn't take any
thing away from the experi
ence.
TSD: Last question. If you
could tell people one thing
about field hockey, what
would you tell them?
Dru: A recent fact I learned,
we have the fastest backswing
of any sport out there. The
backswing of a field hockey
stick can reach up to 100 mph,
which beats baseball, tennis,
golf. We beat it all. So go
watch, [laughing] I'll get a lit
tle plug in there.
TSD: Perfect. Thank you for
taking the time to talk with us.
Dru: Thank you so much.
