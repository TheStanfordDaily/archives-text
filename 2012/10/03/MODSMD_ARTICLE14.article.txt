## NUNES STILL A LOCK AS SIGNAL CALLER SHAW DECLINES STARTER QUESTIONS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Josh Nunes is Stanford's starting quarterback.
Period. End of story. At the team's weekly press
conference on Tuesday, Coach Shaw made a rare
opening statement to reaffirm his full commit
ment to Nunes and announce that he would not
be answering any more questions related to a
potential quarterback change.
"As far as the quarterback situation goes, I'm
not going to answer any questions about whether
or not we're going to play another quarterback.
Josh is the starting quarterback.
"We're not changing quarterbacks. That does
n't make any sense to me. We wanted to bronze
his arms and his legs after USC and now I gotta
answer a hundred questions about why we're not
changing quarterbacks. It's asinine."
That statement of confidence from Shaw real
ly sums up the sentiment of Tuesday's press con
ference. Though everyone on the team is very dis
appointed by Stanford's loss at Washington,
nobody is panicking. No major changes are going
to come this week as Stanford looks to bounce
back at home against Arizona. Instead, look for a
few small changes in Nunes' technique.
"It's all mechanics. It's not anything Josh can't
do and hasn't done a thousand times... it's
about making sure his body is always in the right
position."
In addition to fixing physical mistakes, much
of the focus early in the week has been on men
tally bouncing back from a tough defeat. A lot of
this attitude is coming from Stanford's senior
leadership, including nose tackle Terrence
Stephens. When it comes to moving forward from
losses, Stephens preaches the "24-hour" rule.
"24 hours to sulk. You can cry in your bed.
You can roll over and pout. But after that, you
better get up and be a man about it."
The tone of the day was not entirely negative,
as Shaw had some good injury news to present.
Junior running back Anthony Wilkerson is ahead
of schedule in his recovery from a lower leg
injury and has a chance to play on Saturday.
Wilkerson, who didn't make the trip to Seattle,
has missed much of the last three games battling
the injury originally suffered against Duke. Shaw
indicated that Wilkerson may be back at practice
today, and if he's out there, he has a good chance

to play on Saturday.
In other injury news, Andrus Peat played
without his cast for the first time all season
against Washington to rave reviews. Shaw
thought he played very well, and is focused on
working Peat to reach his potential as soon as
possible, along with fellow contributing true
freshmen offensive linemen Kyle Murphy and
Joshua Garnett.
While much of Stanford's 2012 talent influx
has come from its aforementioned offensive line
men, Arizona is riding high in the wake of its hir
ing of head coach Rich Rodriguez. Rodriguez is

known for having a bit of quirkiness in his offen
sive and defensive schemes, which causes trou
bles when transitioning between programs.
However, Rich Rod's start in Arizona seems to
be going much more smoothly, leaving Coach
Shaw "surprised and disappointed" by the chal
lenge coming on Saturday.
Arizona's early success is just one example of
Pac-12 head coaching victories early in 2012.
Rodriguez is brand new, but the conference's
longest-tenured head coach, Oregon State's Mike

Starting quarterback Josh Nunes has been under great pressure after a rough start against
Washington, but head coach David Shaw gave the redshirt junior a strong vote of confidence
on Tuesday. Nunes is 65-125 for 785 yards, six TDs and four INTs in four starts this season.
