# Plenty of blame to go around

If there ever was a weekly award
given to the least popular per
son on campus, quarterback
Josh Nunes probably tied wide
receiver Ty Montgomery for
that distinguished honor last week.
As fans painfully watched
Stanford's 17-13 loss to Washington
last Thursday night, a slew of angry
comments exploded in countless
dorm rooms and all over the social
media: "Nunes is such a scrub."
"HOW did he underthrow that?"
"Who the hell was he throwing that
to?" "Is he a high school freshman?"
"Can we get Brett Nottingham in the
game now?"
So many people were shouting for
Nunes' head on a spike that you'd
think it was the French Revolution.
Even if you didn't directly participate
in the massive Nunes-scapegoating
movement, you still must've been
frustrated by his inefficiency.
I'll admit it, I was guilty of that
myself
But in the aftermath of the devas
tating game, it dawned on me that
while Josh Nunes isn't an elite college
quarterback, he's the right quarter
back for Stanford.

There are not that many rookie
quarterbacks in college football who
could have handled the pressure of
replacing a once-in-a-generation
quarterback in Andrew Luck as well
as he has been able to so far. If you
think about it, the Washington game
marked the first time that Nunes truly
played badly for an entire game.
Considering that he threw only two
passes in his entire career before this
year and that it's a quarter into the
season, his overall performance has
actually been impressive.
After the epic USC upset, Nunes
was copiously praised for his drive
sustaining, heart-showing scramble on
third down in the fourth quarter as
well as his perfectly threaded game
winning touchdown pass to Zach Ertz.
No one mentioned his absurdly dis
mal first-half performance, in which
he completed 6-of-17 passes and
tossed two interceptions. Running
back Stepfan Taylor played the
biggest role in taking down the No. 2
Trojans, but Nunes, as imperfect as he
was, somehow managed to outplay
Matt Barkley, supposedly the best
quarterback in college football.
While there's no doubting that
Nunes continued his awful passing
game through the fourth quarter
against Washington, he came out on
the last drive unrattled. He led the
offense to the Huskies 40-yard line
before the drive collapsed. But the
truth is that if Ty Montgomery didn't
drop the go-ahead touchdown on
first-and-15, everyone would be hail
ing Nunes as Mr. Clutch right now
instead of labeling him as Mr. Awful.
He doesn't have the strongest arm or
the best awarenss, but he's got poise.
Sure, Nunes threw a poor ball to
tight end Levine Toilolo on the last
play of the Cardinal's drive that was
picked off, but it wasn't great play-call
ing to begin with. Why give the ball to
Toilolo, who only had one reception
for 18 yards all game, when Ertz was
on fire and virtually uncoverable?
Doesn't make sense. Even if Toilolo
created a physical mismatch against
every defensive back on the field, it's
not ideal to bank on the small possibil
ity that Huskies cornerback Desmond
Trufant, one of the top corners in the
conference, wouldn't make a play on
the ball.
To be fair, none of these things
excuse Nunes' underthrown passes
and overall inefficiency against
Washington. As both him and head
coach David Shaw admitted, he needs
to fix some mechanics, specifically
firmly setting his feet before firing the
ball to his receivers on short passes.

While Josh
Nunes isn't
elite, he's the
right quarter
back for
Stanford.
