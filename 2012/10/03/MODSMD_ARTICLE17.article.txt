# Showdown looms in Pacific Northwest
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
There is nothing like nine straight wins,
including four in a row against Pac-12 oppo
nents, to get a team fired up for what looks to
be its toughest challenge of the season. The No.
7 Stanford women's volleyball team (12-2,4-0
Pac-12) hosts No. 2 Oregon on Friday night in
a matchup of undefeated Pac-12 teams. Two
days later, they will also play host to the dan
gerous Oregon State Beavers, who sit in a tie
for 4th place in the Pac-12.

Stanford's first task, however, will be to dis
mantle an Oregon team that has been utterly
dominant this season. The Ducks have not
dropped a set since their Sept. 5 matchup with
UC Santa Barbara, a stretch including an
impressive sweep over then No. 2 USC.
Oregon (13-0, 4-0) features a dynamic
offense that leads Div. I with 15.72 kills per set
and leads the Pac-12 in both assists per set and
hitting percentage, with 14.65 and .318, respec
tively. Stanford's team (12-2,4-0 Pac-12), how
ever, hopes that it can counter with one of the
strongest defenses in the Pac-12. The Cardinal
leads the conference with 16.35 digs per set,
and is 4th in blocks with 2.98 per set.

Redshirt senior outside hitter Alaina
Bergsma leads the Ducks on offense. An All-
American selection one year ago, Bergsma has
entirely upped her game this year, ranking sec
ond in the conference with 4.71 kills per set,
while also appearing in the top five in hitting
percentage, service aces and points. Slowing
her down will be key to limiting the Oregon
attack.

The Ducks have a multitude of other offen
sive weapons, however, including junior middle
blocker Ariana Williams, who leads the Pac-12 in
hitting percentage, and junior setter Lauren
Plum, who leads the conference in assists per set.
Oregon's main liability has to be defense,
however, especially around the net. Oregon

ranks dead last in the Pac-12 in blocks per set,
with just 1.71. This weakness is one Stanford
must exploit if they are going to end the Ducks'
undefeated season.
While Oregon State (12-4, 2-2) lacks the
offensive firepower of Oregon, ranking second
to last in the Pac-12 in both hitting percentage
and kills per set, it is not an opponent to be
taken lightly. The Beavers are 10-2 over their
last 12 games, and fresh off victories over con
ference foes Colorado and Utah.
Oregon State's junior libero Becky Defoe
has proved to be one of the best defensive
players in the game so far this season, leading
the Pac-12 with 5.28 digs per set. She will be
sure to make the offensive attack difficult for
the Stanford frontcourt.
On offense, the Beavers are led by senior
outside hitter Camille Saxton, who ranks in the
top 10 in the conference in kills per set, points
and aces per set. Saxton has been red-hot as of
late, with 19 kills against Utah and 18 kills and
a career-high eight blocks against Colorado.
The Beavers are inefficient offensively, with
just one of their top seven offensive players hit
ting above .220 on the season, sophomore out
side hitter Arica Nassar. For Stanford to win
this game, they must be able to take advantage
of these inefficient attacks, and turn them into
points on the offensive end.
Ultimately, this weekend will be crucial
for the young Cardinal team. Taking down
what may be the nation's hottest team,
Oregon, could provide momentum to carry
Stanford through the season. The Cardinal
would love to extend their win streak to dou
ble digits, and they believe they have the
means to do so.
The Cardinal will face the Ducks at 5:30
p.m. on Friday in Maples Arena, then will take
on the Beavers at 2 p.m. on Sunday.
