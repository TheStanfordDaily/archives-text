## HOLMES VS. HOLMES Breaking down the Sherlocks SHERLOCK ELEMENTARY 
### Aaron Broder | STAFF WRITER 
CBS got a lot of N.
flack for
"Elementary" every
step of the way for ripping off
"Sherlock," the BBC's modern retelling of
the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, for
making Watson a woman, for moving the
story to New York instead of London all
before the show even aired. Last week, the
pilot finally made its way to television with
the general consensus already stacked
against it. But the premature judgment is a
little unfair; rather than solely an opportu
nity to cash in on "Sherlock's" popularity,
"Elementary" proved to be a fairly solid, if
familiar, police procedural that happened to
feature modern iterations of Holmes and

Watson.
BBC's "Sherlock," which only has three
episodes per season, focuses on tightly recre
ating the original stories in a modern con-

text.
"Elementary,"
while less true to
Doyle's original
stories, instead
features new
mysteries that
allow the writing
to tackle the

iconic Sherlock
Holmes character from a differ
ent angle.
Because the "Elementary"
characters sidestep rather than settle
into their "Sherlock" molds, they escape
our predictions and lowered expectations.
So far, Lucy Liu's Watson seems to be a
more active player than the traditional
Holmes sidekick and better able to hold her
own against her Holmes. While she lacks
Sherlock's deductive abilities, her ability to
read people entertains us, a la "Lie to Me,"
"Psych," "Monk," et cetera. And while
Sherlock strays less from his original form,
or from Benedict Cumberbatch's BBC per
formance, his seemingly haunted attitude
has us hoping the show will delve deeper
into what exactly makes him tick and what
led to his rehab admission.
Despite all the character achievements,
the flair of "Sherlock" escapes "Elementary."
Shifting it to a standard procedural distin
guished "Elementary" from other Holmes
retellings but risks falling into the shadow of
any of the countless other procedurals on
our Netflix queues. Meanwhile, "Sherlock"

L W ■
has a
style in all of Tk
its shots, even
the ones where the I ■
style involves text
floating in midair as
Watson types out a blog
post. Somehow, the Sherlock
of "Elementary" waving around
an iPhone to show a picture he took just
doesn't wield the same distinction. The
show seems like it's simultaneously trying to
draw attention to its modernity and not step
on the BBC's toes.
"Elementary" may play too safe to keep
the crowd. Despite that, for now the charac

ters are holding our interest. It almost seems
to be the story of what would have hap
pened if Watson and Holmes met each
other a little later in their lives, and how
each character would have developed with
out the other's influence. As a result, where
they are now and where they go from here
are both unexplored territories, and overall
something I'm excited to see every once in a
while.
