## WHY WE'RE FALLING FOR FALL 
### Sara Van Rensselear | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Autumn bears a certain something
that always escapes even a whit
tled tongue: a subtle, one of those
blink-and-you'll-miss-it sort of things.
This is the precise reason why I love the
autumn so much. You have the summer, a
unilateral favorite; the spring, running a
close second by many opinions, and the
winter, dead last if you're not fond of cold
weather. But autumn, I think, is underrat
ed.

A bit of
word association
here, but when I
hear the word
autumn, I think
of leaves. Red,
yellow, green and
orange blended

together to create what can only be
described as one of the most beautiful
natural phenomena of the season. It
marks the end of an era, the end of sum
mer. When those leaves fall, their end is
finite: there is no rewinding that. We can
only move forward.
That is what autumn means to me:
moving forward.
After being away from Stanford for a
few months and finally going home for
the first summer that I have had since
starting college, I realized I had changed. I
knew this would happen, but there were
so many discombobulated thoughts and
habits that did not reconcile themselves
with my past at home to my present and
future at Stanford. While I was relieved to
be home and in the comforts that I grew
up with, I found myself anxious to get
back to campus, itching to return to my
new friends, my studies and most of all,
this very special place.
I knew it would be a new start, and

regardless of what
was established last year, it would be pos
sible to renew myself. Of course, renewal
can happen at any point of time, but the
start of a new school year always seems
the easiest time to do this.
So, take a walk with a friend, new or
old it won't matter. Take a stroll
around campus and take it all in. Lie
beneath the changing trees and consider
all the things that

you can change.
Daydream about
all the things that
might be coming
your way. You can
be as realistic or as
idealistic as you
would like; it won't

matter. The trees that serve as your reality
are always going to represent what you
know, and those crunchy, fallen leaves
represent the process of moving forward.
And so, we move forward. New class
es, new faces, new names and new news
that are nearly impossible to foresee. Get
excited for all those new reasons to pull
all-nighters and new people to laugh with.
Rest assured that there are no such things
as old faces; even they have something
new to give you. Even better? You are not
old in any sense of the word; even you
have something new to give to the world.
This is why I love the autumn. Well,
that and all those pumpkin and apple pies
that are finally in season! The summer
and the spring are fine and dandy, and the
winter sometimes has its perks, but the
autumn is the most perfect season of
them all.
Welcome back to autumn, and wel
come to the infinite possibilities you have
coming your way.

That is what autumn
