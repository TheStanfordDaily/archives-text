# Frats hesitant to throw all-campus parties
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Days after Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
(SAE) Back to School Party tradi
tionally the first all-campus party of
the year on the first Monday of class
was closed to those without invita
tion wristbands, Kappa Sigma opened
their doors for the first all-campus
party, Eurotrash, which was dry this
year.
The new alcohol policies within
fraternities come amid a larger con
versation between administrators and
fraternity leaders about the relation
ship between the Greek system, cam
pus alcohol culture and the freshman
experience.
On the first day of classes, a group

of Kappa Sigma fraternity members
stationed themselves on a grassy
patch east of Meyer Library and
offered passers-by campus maps and
cookies. Before long, Resident
Fellows from a nearby freshman
dorm came out to express their disap
proval.
"Kappa Sigma, having come off
two years of long and arduous review,
is trying to say, 'Hey, we want to get
out there and show we're not all
about handing out shots,"' Associate
Dean of Residential Education Nate
Boswell said.

This incident only highlights com
munication problems that some
Greek students and University
administrators feel plagues Stanford's
social system.

"There are plenty of perceptions
in all sorts of pockets on campus of
what it means to be a Resident
Fellow, to be in a fraternity, to be in a
sorority," Boswell said. "If they were
being a nuisance or difficult or any
thing like that, that's one thing. If they
were trying to be visible, that is some
thing we want. We want them to show
up in responsible ways."
The communication problems
between Greek life and freshman
dorm life often center around alco
hol, and often come to a head during
spring quarter's fraternity and sorori
ty rush period.
"We've got folks who are on the
Row saying, 'Hey, could you take bet
ter care of your frosh over there
because I don't want them showing

up drunk at my house," Dean of
ResEd Deborah Colder said. "Then
I've got RFs and staff in the frosh
houses saying, 'Hey, during new mem
ber recruitment you trash our houses,
you send drunk people, your new
members come running through our
houses wreaking havoc."
To make an attempt at bridging
that gap, fraternity members made
the rounds at freshman house meet
ings during the first week of classes to
demystify the Greek system and lay
out their expectations of the fresh
man, some of whom will invariably
find themselves in a fraternity on
Friday or Saturday nights.
Many of those expectations, and
the initiative that brought fraternity
members to freshman dorms, are a

result of the risk that a fraternity with
open doors to the campus is also
opening its doors to students who will
neglect the house's property and
cause costly damages, as well as raise
concerns about responsibility for
alcohol poisoning-related transports.

"Fraternities have been seen as
jungle gyms at all-campus parties for
people to do whatever they want and
there are no consequences" Kappa
Alpha (KA) president James
Balassone 'l3 said.

"We really want to take more
responsibility over who comes in, how
they come in, what state they come
in," Balassone also said, emphasizing
that fraternities often must share the
responsibility for students who
arrive at the fraternity having
consumed an irresponsible
amount of alcohol elsewhere.
According to President of
SAE Nelson Estrada 'l3,
many of the alcohol-related
transports at last year's Back
to School party were students
in the entrance line who had
yet to enter the party.
The issue of immediate lia
bility is not the only impetus
for the increased caution at
parties and Greek-to-fresh
men outreach thus far this
year. Fraternities are also pro
tecting themselves from the
more abstract type of damage
that can be accrued over long
periods: the risk of no longer
being housed.
Until Kappa Sigma lost its
house two years ago, no frater
nity had lost its house in a
decade and institutional mem
ory had been lost since the
1990s when turnover of Greek
houses was almost constant.
"Of course, when there's a
consequence, people are going
to pay attention," Boswell
said. "There hadn't been a
consequence like that for 10 or
12 years."
For students in KA, recent
Greek issues have made the
risks all the more real and
have motivated change.
"People are realizing that
we have a lot of control over
the consequences if we

become better at managing
the situations," Balassone said.
Fraternities and, to a lesser
extent, sororities, have an
unusual platform from which
to effect change among the
student body, because they
provide a crucial service to the
rest of the student body:
throwing parties.
"They have a lot of politi
cal capital in the social life and
I think people would take
their lead," Director of the
Office for Alcohol Policy and
Education Ralph Castro said.
"That's where people go for
parties and events, so if they
are setting clear expectations
about what they want from
partygoers in their home as it
relates to alcohol, then I think
they can be influential."
One of the biggest windows
of opportunity to change the
culture surrounding alcohol
and party-going on campus lies
in the new freshman class.
However, continuing the
current increased level of cau
tion on the Row is not without
its risks.
"Going to college parties
was something [freshmen] had
in their head before they came
to college, and now they're here
and they want to experience
that," Wilbur Resident Assitant
(RA) and Sigma Nu member
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4 said.
Hurlbutt warned that pre
venting freshmen from obtain
ing alcohol at fraternities
could cause an alcohol con
sumption whiplash back to the
freshmen dorms, a concern
echoed by Balassone.
"To me, that seems like it

might cause people to just
pregame more beforehand if
freshmen hear about [the par
ties being dry], which is obvi
ously exactly what we don't
want to happen," he said.
"That's the biggest problem
we have."
Hurlbutt's fellow RA,
Frederik Groce 'l4, said his
freshmen gave generally posi
tive reports of their first (dry)
all-campus party with one
exception.
"It was a great experience
for those that were looking for
that sort of experience," Groce
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"The only negative I can think
of was that perhaps some stu
dents were disappointed by
the lack of alcohol."
Statistically, many fresh
men would have had one of
their first experiences with
alcohol culture during the first
week of classes and parties,
both in their dorms and frater
nity houses. Stanford's incom
ing student body routinely has
a significantly higher percent
age of students without experi
ence in an "active drinking cul
ture" than the national aver
age, leaving freshmen to find
their way around alcohol dur
ing their first few months as
college students.
"What's happening is they
are coming to Stanford not as
drinkers and they're becoming
drinkers when they're here,"
Golder said. "We are very high
achieving, and we're blowing
that curve."

ter care of your frosh over there
because I don't want them showing

up drunk at my house," Dean of
ResEd Deborah Colder said. "Then
I've got RFs and staff in the frosh
houses saying, 'Hey, during new mem
ber recruitment you trash our houses,
you send drunk people, your new
members come running through our
houses wreaking havoc."
To make an attempt at bridging
that gap, fraternity members made
the rounds at freshman house meet
ings during the first week of classes to
demystify the Greek system and lay
out their expectations of the fresh
man, some of whom will invariably
find themselves in a fraternity on
Friday or Saturday nights.
Many of those expectations, and
the initiative that brought fraternity
members to freshman dorms, are a

result of the risk that a fraternity with
open doors to the campus is also
opening its doors to students who will
neglect the house's property and
cause costly damages, as well as raise
concerns about responsibility for
alcohol poisoning-related transports.

"Fraternities have been seen as
jungle gyms at all-campus parties for
people to do whatever they want and
there are no consequences" Kappa
Alpha (KA) president James
Balassone 'l3 said.

"We really want to take more
responsibility over who comes in, how
they come in, what state they come
in," Balassone also said, emphasizing
that fraternities often must share the
responsibility for students who
arrive at the fraternity having
consumed an irresponsible
amount of alcohol elsewhere.
According to President of
SAE Nelson Estrada 'l3,
many of the alcohol-related
transports at last year's Back
to School party were students
in the entrance line who had
yet to enter the party.
The issue of immediate lia
bility is not the only impetus
for the increased caution at
parties and Greek-to-fresh
men outreach thus far this
year. Fraternities are also pro
tecting themselves from the
more abstract type of damage
that can be accrued over long
periods: the risk of no longer
being housed.
Until Kappa Sigma lost its
house two years ago, no frater
nity had lost its house in a
decade and institutional mem
ory had been lost since the
1990s when turnover of Greek
houses was almost constant.
"Of course, when there's a
consequence, people are going
to pay attention," Boswell
said. "There hadn't been a
consequence like that for 10 or
12 years."
For students in KA, recent
Greek issues have made the
risks all the more real and
have motivated change.
"People are realizing that
we have a lot of control over
the consequences if we

become better at managing
the situations," Balassone said.
Fraternities and, to a lesser
extent, sororities, have an
unusual platform from which
to effect change among the
student body, because they
provide a crucial service to the
rest of the student body:
throwing parties.
"They have a lot of politi
cal capital in the social life and
I think people would take
their lead," Director of the
Office for Alcohol Policy and
Education Ralph Castro said.
"That's where people go for
parties and events, so if they
are setting clear expectations
about what they want from
partygoers in their home as it
relates to alcohol, then I think
they can be influential."
One of the biggest windows
of opportunity to change the
culture surrounding alcohol
and party-going on campus lies
in the new freshman class.
However, continuing the
current increased level of cau
tion on the Row is not without
its risks.
"Going to college parties
was something [freshmen] had
in their head before they came
to college, and now they're here
and they want to experience
that," Wilbur Resident Assitant
(RA) and Sigma Nu member
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4 said.
Hurlbutt warned that pre
venting freshmen from obtain
ing alcohol at fraternities
could cause an alcohol con
sumption whiplash back to the
freshmen dorms, a concern
echoed by Balassone.
"To me, that seems like it

might cause people to just
pregame more beforehand if
freshmen hear about [the par
ties being dry], which is obvi
ously exactly what we don't
want to happen," he said.
"That's the biggest problem
we have."
Hurlbutt's fellow RA,
Frederik Groce 'l4, said his
freshmen gave generally posi
tive reports of their first (dry)
all-campus party with one
exception.
"It was a great experience
for those that were looking for
that sort of experience," Groce
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"The only negative I can think
of was that perhaps some stu
dents were disappointed by
the lack of alcohol."
Statistically, many fresh
men would have had one of
their first experiences with
alcohol culture during the first
week of classes and parties,
both in their dorms and frater
nity houses. Stanford's incom
ing student body routinely has
a significantly higher percent
age of students without experi
ence in an "active drinking cul
ture" than the national aver
age, leaving freshmen to find
their way around alcohol dur
ing their first few months as
college students.
"What's happening is they
are coming to Stanford not as
drinkers and they're becoming
drinkers when they're here,"
Golder said. "We are very high
achieving, and we're blowing
that curve."

Days after Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
(SAE) Back to School Party tradi
tionally the first all-campus party of
the year on the first Monday of class
was closed to those without invita
tion wristbands, Kappa Sigma opened
their doors for the first all-campus
party, Eurotrash, which was dry this
year.
The new alcohol policies within
fraternities come amid a larger con
versation between administrators and
fraternity leaders about the relation
ship between the Greek system, cam
pus alcohol culture and the freshman
experience.
On the first day of classes, a group

of Kappa Sigma fraternity members
stationed themselves on a grassy
patch east of Meyer Library and
offered passers-by campus maps and
cookies. Before long, Resident
Fellows from a nearby freshman
dorm came out to express their disap
proval.
"Kappa Sigma, having come off
two years of long and arduous review,
is trying to say, 'Hey, we want to get
out there and show we're not all
about handing out shots,"' Associate
Dean of Residential Education Nate
Boswell said.

This incident only highlights com
munication problems that some
Greek students and University
administrators feel plagues Stanford's
social system.

"There are plenty of perceptions
in all sorts of pockets on campus of
what it means to be a Resident
Fellow, to be in a fraternity, to be in a
sorority," Boswell said. "If they were
being a nuisance or difficult or any
thing like that, that's one thing. If they
were trying to be visible, that is some
thing we want. We want them to show
up in responsible ways."
The communication problems
between Greek life and freshman
dorm life often center around alco
hol, and often come to a head during
spring quarter's fraternity and sorori
ty rush period.
"We've got folks who are on the
