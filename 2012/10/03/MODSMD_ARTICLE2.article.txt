# Frats hesitant to throw all-campus parties
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Days after Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
(SAE) Back to School Party tradi
tionally the first all-campus party of
the year on the first Monday of class
was closed to those without invita
tion wristbands, Kappa Sigma opened
their doors for the first all-campus
party, Eurotrash, which was dry this
year.
The new alcohol policies within
fraternities come amid a larger con
versation between administrators and
fraternity leaders about the relation
ship between the Greek system, cam
pus alcohol culture and the freshman
experience.
On the first day of classes, a group

of Kappa Sigma fraternity members
stationed themselves on a grassy
patch east of Meyer Library and
offered passers-by campus maps and
cookies. Before long, Resident
Fellows from a nearby freshman
dorm came out to express their disap
proval.
"Kappa Sigma, having come off
two years of long and arduous review,
is trying to say, 'Hey, we want to get
out there and show we're not all
about handing out shots,"' Associate
Dean of Residential Education Nate
Boswell said.

This incident only highlights com
munication problems that some
Greek students and University
administrators feel plagues Stanford's
social system.

"There are plenty of perceptions
in all sorts of pockets on campus of
what it means to be a Resident
Fellow, to be in a fraternity, to be in a
sorority," Boswell said. "If they were
being a nuisance or difficult or any
thing like that, that's one thing. If they
were trying to be visible, that is some
thing we want. We want them to show
up in responsible ways."
The communication problems
between Greek life and freshman
dorm life often center around alco
hol, and often come to a head during
spring quarter's fraternity and sorori
ty rush period.
"We've got folks who are on the
Row saying, 'Hey, could you take bet
ter care of your frosh over there
because I don't want them showing

up drunk at my house," Dean of
ResEd Deborah Colder said. "Then
I've got RFs and staff in the frosh
houses saying, 'Hey, during new mem
ber recruitment you trash our houses,
you send drunk people, your new
members come running through our
houses wreaking havoc."
To make an attempt at bridging
that gap, fraternity members made
the rounds at freshman house meet
ings during the first week of classes to
demystify the Greek system and lay
out their expectations of the fresh
man, some of whom will invariably
find themselves in a fraternity on
Friday or Saturday nights.
Many of those expectations, and
the initiative that brought fraternity
members to freshman dorms, are a

result of the risk that a fraternity with
open doors to the campus is also
opening its doors to students who will
neglect the house's property and
cause costly damages, as well as raise
concerns about responsibility for
alcohol poisoning-related transports.

"Fraternities have been seen as
jungle gyms at all-campus parties for
people to do whatever they want and
there are no consequences" Kappa
Alpha (KA) president James
Balassone 'l3 said.

"We really want to take more
responsibility over who comes in, how
they come in, what state they come
in," Balassone also said, emphasizing
that fraternities often must share the
