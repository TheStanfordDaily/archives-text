## FMOTQ alcohol transports down to four 
### MARIANNE LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
A total of four alcohol transports occurred at
Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ) on Monday
night, a notable improvement from last year's
seven, according to Ralph Castro, director of the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE).
All four transports this year were upperclassmen.
"Last year there was only one freshman trans
port," Castro said. "What we're finding is that the
event is a higher risk for upper class students than
it is for the freshmen."
Castro attributed this disparity to numerous
factors including limited contact from the event's
organizers to upperclassmen, particularly those
living on the Row.
"We do a lot of messaging for the freshmen
and the Resident Assistants do a lot of prep work
to prevent [freshmen] from pre-gaming," Castro
said. "Unfortunately, I think when we get to the
realm of upper class students, the safety net isn't
as wide."
Fie stated that messaging to Resident

Assistants (RAs) and Resident Fellows (RFs)
was fairly standard this year. OAPE encouraged
dorm staff to hold conversations early in the year
about alcohol use and pregaming, particularly
with hard liquor.
Patti Flanlon-Baker, a Larkin Resident
Fellow, cited these early conversations as one of
the recent changes in alcohol-related discussion.
She emphasized the importance of making the
talks mandatory for freshmen.
"We scheduled [a mandatory talk] very early
on with OAPE," Flanlon-Baker said. "It wasn't
just about FMOTQ but also about alcohol in gen
eral. We [also]... gave them the typical things to
pay attention to [at FMOTQ], everything from
not kissing the tree to the reasons why you want
to be there."
Tiffany Rung 'l3, an RA in Otero, said that
alcohol was heavily discussed during staff train
ing.
"A bunch of the freshmen RAs were nervous
about having FMOTQ [during] the first week of
school because we really wanted the freshmen
feel comfortable about Stanford and understand

how to drink," she said.
Kung stated that in addition to the alcohol
related discussions with staff, Otero has also invit
ed students from a variety of communities to dis
cuss alcohol on campus.
"We had many more students come in and
talk about alcohol from different scenes [includ
ing the Greek scene] at dorm meetings," she said.
"I think that's more effective than having adults
talk to them since they respect other students
more."
Both Castro and Hanlon-Baker discussed the
importance of planning events earlier in the
evening to provide students with alternative
options to pre-gaming. Larkin, for example, held
a pizza party in the lounge.
"We wanted the lounge to be a social space
[for residents] with their peers," Hanlon-Baker
said.
This year, Cardinal Nights hosted a pre-
FMOTQ event, which included a Chipotle
"Burrito Bash" and a concert featuring "The

Machine." Castro described
the event as "well-attended,"
adding that students went
through "1000 burritos within
30 to 40 minutes."

"We wanted to encourage
freshmen to be safe and
[attend] the Cardinal Nights
burrito [bash] and we wanted
people to get food in their
stomachs so they wouldn't be

too intoxicated," Kung said.
Castro described Cardinal
Nights as only one of numer
ous factors that contributed
to this year's reduced number
of alcohol transports.
"It's hard to say what we
attribute [the lower number
of transports] to," Castro said.
"It was most likely a combi
nation of things better
messaging, being able to do
programming on the front
end [and] more vigilance with
students."
Castro praised the Sophomore
Class for FMOTQ's success,

describing the 80 sober moni
tors as "outstanding" and
"very vigilant."
"The student staff did a
very good job [with] over
2000 students there," Castro
said. "To just have four that
had issues out of 2000 is pret
ty good. Obviously we would
like to have zero [but] based
on what we saw last year, we
cut in half the number of alco
hol issues from this year to
last year."

All four transports this year were upperclassmen.
"Last year there was only one freshman trans
port," Castro said. "What we're finding is that the
event is a higher risk for upper class students than
it is for the freshmen."
Castro attributed this disparity to numerous
factors including limited contact from the event's
organizers to upperclassmen, particularly those
living on the Row.
"We do a lot of messaging for the freshmen
and the Resident Assistants do a lot of prep work
to prevent [freshmen] from pre-gaming," Castro
said. "Unfortunately, I think when we get to the
realm of upper class students, the safety net isn't
as wide."
Fie stated that messaging to Resident

Assistants (RAs) and Resident Fellows (RFs)
was fairly standard this year. OAPE encouraged
dorm staff to hold conversations early in the year
about alcohol use and pregaming, particularly
with hard liquor.
Patti Flanlon-Baker, a Larkin Resident
Fellow, cited these early conversations as one of
the recent changes in alcohol-related discussion.
She emphasized the importance of making the
talks mandatory for freshmen.
"We scheduled [a mandatory talk] very early
on with OAPE," Flanlon-Baker said. "It wasn't
just about FMOTQ but also about alcohol in gen
eral. We [also]... gave them the typical things to
pay attention to [at FMOTQ], everything from
not kissing the tree to the reasons why you want
to be there."
Tiffany Rung 'l3, an RA in Otero, said that
alcohol was heavily discussed during staff train
ing.
"A bunch of the freshmen RAs were nervous
about having FMOTQ [during] the first week of
school because we really wanted the freshmen
feel comfortable about Stanford and understand

how to drink," she said.
Kung stated that in addition to the alcohol
related discussions with staff, Otero has also invit
ed students from a variety of communities to dis
cuss alcohol on campus.
"We had many more students come in and
talk about alcohol from different scenes [includ
ing the Greek scene] at dorm meetings," she said.
"I think that's more effective than having adults
talk to them since they respect other students
more."
Both Castro and Hanlon-Baker discussed the
importance of planning events earlier in the
evening to provide students with alternative
options to pre-gaming. Larkin, for example, held
a pizza party in the lounge.
"We wanted the lounge to be a social space
[for residents] with their peers," Hanlon-Baker
said.
This year, Cardinal Nights hosted a pre-
FMOTQ event, which included a Chipotle
"Burrito Bash" and a concert featuring "The

Machine." Castro described
the event as "well-attended,"
adding that students went
through "1000 burritos within
30 to 40 minutes."

"We wanted to encourage
freshmen to be safe and
[attend] the Cardinal Nights
burrito [bash] and we wanted
people to get food in their
stomachs so they wouldn't be

too intoxicated," Kung said.
Castro described Cardinal
Nights as only one of numer
ous factors that contributed
to this year's reduced number
of alcohol transports.
"It's hard to say what we
attribute [the lower number
of transports] to," Castro said.
"It was most likely a combi
nation of things better
messaging, being able to do
programming on the front
end [and] more vigilance with
students."
Castro praised the Sophomore
Class for FMOTQ's success,

describing the 80 sober moni
tors as "outstanding" and
"very vigilant."
"The student staff did a
very good job [with] over
2000 students there," Castro
said. "To just have four that
had issues out of 2000 is pret
ty good. Obviously we would
like to have zero [but] based
on what we saw last year, we
cut in half the number of alco
hol issues from this year to
last year."
