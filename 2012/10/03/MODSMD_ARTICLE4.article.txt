## New Stanford athletic department policy leaves annual fundraiser homeless 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Edward Ngai 
The Palo Alto Concours
d'Elegance, a summer car show that
raises money for local charities, is
looking for a new home after hosting
their annual event at Stanford for
the past 38 years. The change comes
on the heels of a new University pol
icy regarding use of practice fields.
The Concours d'Elegance, hosted

by the Palo Alto Host Lions Club,
has showcased vintage, exotic and
sports cars every June for 47 years.
According to the Palo Alto Daily
News, the event has raised over $1.78
million for 41 charities over that time
span.

Proceeds from the car show also
supported two Stanford-based chari
ties: the Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital and a University scholar
ship fund for a local student-athlete.
Organizers of the event were
informed in September by deputy ath
letic director Ray Purpur that Stanford
would not make its fields available next
year. After surveying 50 sites from
Redwood City to Santa Clara over the
last month, the car show is still
looking for a venue.
Without a new location to
host their event, the longtime

fundraiser will "probably
close their doors," according
to a press release by
Concours executive director
Christine Cheshire.

However, plans for the
2013 event continue despite
the ongoing search for a new
home. The organizing com
mittee hopes to have finalized

a venue by the time invita
tions need to be mailed out.
"An effort is underway to
preserve this longstanding
Silicon Valley tradition," said
Concours spokeswoman
Valerie Foster to the Palo
Alto Daily News.
