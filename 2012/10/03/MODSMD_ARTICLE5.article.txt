## Weiland Initiative enters second year 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Weiland Health Initiative,
an interdisciplinary program char
tered to promote health and well
ness across the spectrum of gender
identities and sexual orientations,
began its second official year with
plans for new programming.
"Our goaL.is to really figure out
what size and what programs are
the best fit and what's really sustain
able over time," Director Inge

Hansen said of the initiative's plans
for this year.
A partnership between Vaden
Health Center and the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Community Resources Center
(LGBT-CRC), the Weiland
Initiative was established in
September 2011 after receiving
funding from the estate of the late
Richard Weiland '76. Weiland, a
Stanford alumnus who identified as
gay, committed suicide in 2006
after years of struggling with
depression. The initiative,
named in his honor, was struc
tured to help young people
through some of the same
obstacles Weiland faced.
Hansen, who began work
ing at Stanford as a general
psychologist after working at
the LGBT Community Center
in San Diego, now directs the
initiative.
"It's about health equity,"
Hansen said of the initiative's
work, "It's about making sure
that students who are in a dis
advantaged group are able to
access the same health services
as students who are in the
more privileged group."
Although many universi
ties, including Princeton
University and the University
of California at Berkeley, have
strong partnerships between
their health centers and their
LGBT centers, Hansen said
she does not know of any pro
gram similar to the Weiland
Initiative in its dedication and
narrow focus.
"A lot of what is going on
here is actually groundbreak
ing," Hansen said.
While the Weiland
Initiative does not expect a sig
nificant expansion in size in its
second year, it has introduced
new programs and increased
collaboration with other
University bodies. According
to Hansen, the initiative plans
to invite monthly speakers to
Vaden to discuss clinical prac
tices concerning sexual identi

ty and gender orientation, as
well as offer drop-in counsel
ing hours with Counseling and
Psychological Services
(CAPS) counselors with spe
cific interest in LGBT issues.
In addition, the Weiland
Initiative will coordinate a
team of CAPS professionals,
medical staff and case man
agers to support students who
are transitioning genders.
This is also the first year
that the initiative has wel
comed students onto its staff.
"I really love that it exists
because it really shows
Stanford's commitment to the
mental health and wellbeing
0f... all students across all
gender and sexuality orienta
tions," said Lea Gee-Tong 'l5,
the Weiland Initiative's com
munity and outreach coordi
nator and one of two student
interns.
According to Gee-Tong,
the initiative will also continue
its peer and alumni mentor
ship programs, its postdoctoral
LGBT fellowship within
CAPS and its effort to make
health resources accessible
online.
As part of its mission to
promote discussion and dia
logue surrounding issues of
gender identity and sexual ori
entation, the initiative also
hosts an annual conference for
interested students, health
professionals, and community
members.
This year's conference,
titled "Faith & Sexuality" will
take place on Oct. 19.
"Faith and sexuality is a
part of all of our lives," Hansen
said, "Whether or not you're a
person of faith, we live in a
world were faith is relevant
and we're all going to be navi

gating issues related to faith..
. It's a really important thing
to know about and to be able
to know what it means for us.
And sexuality is the same
way."
Although the conference
will be capped at 60 people to
allow for deeper discussions,
Hansen said that she hopes
more students will attend the
conference this year. In partic
ular, Hansen would like the
conference to engage people
who are not typically involved
in LGBT discussion.
Ben Davidson, director of
the LGBT-CRC and advisor
for the Weiland Initiative,
described student response to
the Weiland Initiative's work
as positive.
"I've noted a good deal of
enthusiasm about Weiland on
the part of students,"
Davidson wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The LGBT-CRC
student staff has in particular
been especially excited about
new opportunities for collabo
ration that the [Weiland] part
nership has made possible."
Hansen, Davison, and
Gee-Tong all stressed the
importance of the Weiland
Initiative for all students at
Stanford.
"We believe that the bet
ter-equipped Stanford is to
provide sensitive, knowledge
able, sophisticated mental
health and wellness services to
all students, the better
equipped those students will
be... to learn and to teach,"
Davidson said, "We see our
mission as linked organically
to the core mission of the uni
versity."

in San Diego, now directs the
initiative.
"It's about health equity,"
Hansen said of the initiative's
work, "It's about making sure
that students who are in a dis
advantaged group are able to
access the same health services
as students who are in the
more privileged group."
Although many universi
ties, including Princeton
University and the University
of California at Berkeley, have
strong partnerships between
their health centers and their
LGBT centers, Hansen said
she does not know of any pro
gram similar to the Weiland
Initiative in its dedication and
narrow focus.
"A lot of what is going on
here is actually groundbreak
ing," Hansen said.
While the Weiland
Initiative does not expect a sig
nificant expansion in size in its
second year, it has introduced
new programs and increased
collaboration with other
University bodies. According
to Hansen, the initiative plans
to invite monthly speakers to
Vaden to discuss clinical prac
tices concerning sexual identi

ty and gender orientation, as
well as offer drop-in counsel
ing hours with Counseling and
Psychological Services
(CAPS) counselors with spe
cific interest in LGBT issues.
In addition, the Weiland
Initiative will coordinate a
team of CAPS professionals,
medical staff and case man
agers to support students who
are transitioning genders.
This is also the first year
that the initiative has wel
comed students onto its staff.
"I really love that it exists
because it really shows
Stanford's commitment to the
mental health and wellbeing
0f... all students across all
gender and sexuality orienta
tions," said Lea Gee-Tong 'l5,
the Weiland Initiative's com
munity and outreach coordi
nator and one of two student
interns.
According to Gee-Tong,
the initiative will also continue
its peer and alumni mentor
ship programs, its postdoctoral
LGBT fellowship within
CAPS and its effort to make
health resources accessible
online.
As part of its mission to
promote discussion and dia
logue surrounding issues of
gender identity and sexual ori
entation, the initiative also
hosts an annual conference for
interested students, health
professionals, and community
members.
This year's conference,
titled "Faith & Sexuality" will
take place on Oct. 19.
"Faith and sexuality is a
part of all of our lives," Hansen
said, "Whether or not you're a
person of faith, we live in a
world were faith is relevant
and we're all going to be navi

gating issues related to faith..
. It's a really important thing
to know about and to be able
to know what it means for us.
And sexuality is the same
way."
Although the conference
will be capped at 60 people to
allow for deeper discussions,
Hansen said that she hopes
more students will attend the
conference this year. In partic
ular, Hansen would like the
conference to engage people
who are not typically involved
in LGBT discussion.
Ben Davidson, director of
the LGBT-CRC and advisor
for the Weiland Initiative,
described student response to
the Weiland Initiative's work
as positive.
"I've noted a good deal of
enthusiasm about Weiland on
the part of students,"
Davidson wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The LGBT-CRC
student staff has in particular
been especially excited about
new opportunities for collabo
ration that the [Weiland] part
nership has made possible."
Hansen, Davison, and
Gee-Tong all stressed the
importance of the Weiland
Initiative for all students at
Stanford.
"We believe that the bet
ter-equipped Stanford is to
provide sensitive, knowledge
able, sophisticated mental
health and wellness services to
all students, the better
equipped those students will
be... to learn and to teach,"
Davidson said, "We see our
mission as linked organically
to the core mission of the uni
versity."

The Weiland Health Initiative,
an interdisciplinary program char
tered to promote health and well
ness across the spectrum of gender
identities and sexual orientations,
began its second official year with
plans for new programming.
"Our goaL.is to really figure out
what size and what programs are
the best fit and what's really sustain
able over time," Director Inge

Hansen said of the initiative's plans
for this year.
A partnership between Vaden
Health Center and the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Community Resources Center
(LGBT-CRC), the Weiland
Initiative was established in
September 2011 after receiving
funding from the estate of the late
Richard Weiland '76. Weiland, a
Stanford alumnus who identified as
gay, committed suicide in 2006
after years of struggling with
depression. The initiative,
named in his honor, was struc
tured to help young people
through some of the same
obstacles Weiland faced.
Hansen, who began work
ing at Stanford as a general
psychologist after working at
the LGBT Community Center
in San Diego, now directs the
initiative.
