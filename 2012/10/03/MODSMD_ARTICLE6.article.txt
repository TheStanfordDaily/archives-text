## Ivy scandal a nonissue at Stanford 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While Harvard University strug
gles to address a cheating scandal
involving as many as 125 undergradu
ates accused of dishonest collabora
tion in a single class, Stanford admin
istrators have downplayed the inci
dent's impact to date on residential
advising and the application of the
University's Honor Code.
The allegations of misconduct at
Harvard stem from apparent similari
ties between some students' answers
on a take-home final exam, despite a
stipulation that class students com
plete the assignment by themselves.
Following further review, nearly half
of the students enrolled in the class
will be called before Harvard inves
tigative hearings.
"This is unprecedented in its
scope and magnitude," said Jay
Harris, Harvard's dean of undergrad
uate education, to The New York
Times.
While Stanford does attempt to
discourage procedures that create
temptations to violate the Honor
Code, such as closed-book take-home
exams or take-home exams subject to
additional time constraints,
University guidelines on the subject
notably fail to address the issue of
prohibiting collaboration among stu
dents on take-home exams, allegedly
a gray area among Harvard students.
Unlike Stanford, Harvard has no stu
dent Honor Code.
"Stanford faculty can and often do
prohibit collaboration on take-home
examinations," wrote Associate Dean
of Student Life Morris Graves in an
email to The Daily.
Graves noted that the Honor
Code encourages Stanford faculty to
notify students of appropriate guide
lines and policies prior to the submis
sion of such assignments, thus hope
fully diminishing the risk of student
confusion.
Student advisors also emphasized
the central role of the Honor Code in
promoting adherence to academic
expectations and disputed the imme
diate significance of the Harvard inci
dent to Stanford.
"The Harvard scandal hasn't
affected the way in which Academic
Directors advise students," wrote
Kirsti Copeland, director of residen
tially-based advising, in an email to
The Daily. "Academic Directors have,
for the last few years, made a point of
referring to the Honor Code in their
opening address to freshmen this
year was no exception."
"Advisors also refer to the Honor
Code when discussing study groups
and collaborative work and the
appropriate limits on both of those,"
Copeland added.
Harvard students accused of
cheating could be suspended for a
year if found guilty, and some stu
dents under investigation have threat-
