## Senate discusses updating website, attendance policy 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a short, 25-minute meeting yesterday, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate unanimously
approved more than $10,500 in funding for stu
dent groups. In a hitch distributing the funding
bills for review, Appropriations Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 copied the Stanford Conservative
Society's funding request twice on the email
among senators. Because senators lumped all
their appropriations in a single vote, seven fund
ing bills were approved even though only six
groups requested funding.
Senators also discussed updating and
restructuring the ASSU website. Shahab Fadavi
'l5 pointed out the presence of inaccurate infor
mation on the senate website, suggesting hiring
a student to ensure the website was consistently
updated.
Senate Communications Chair Viraj Bindra
'l5 said that the website will be updated by a stu
dent volunteer by the end of Thanksgiving.
"We should be... managing the content,
makfing] sure it's accurate... but we should
consider it a work in progress," he said.
During the meeting's open forum former
senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 acknowledged the
complexity of the Senate's governing docu
ments and appropriations process while urging
senators to begin planning events. He encour
aged current senators to reach out to him and

other past senators for help understanding the
regulations and bylaws of the ASSU.
"It's a really tough job," he said. "I know it's
the beginning of the year, but you should
already be getting into planning events or doing
whatever you want to do, because naturally you
put [events] off and then they never fully get
started."
At the end of the meeting, senator Garima
Sharma 'l5 encouraged the senators to recon
sider the Senate's attendance policy. The policy,
which was used last quarter, allows each senator
two excused and two unexcused absences each
quarter from the Senate's weekly meetings. The
rule thus permits a senator to miss four of the
Senate's total of ten meetings. In an interview
after the meeting, Sharma said that she hopes to
amend the policy to require attendance at least
two-thirds of meetings. It was unclear whether
this would mean six or seven meetings.
"We're kind of concerned about [the atten
dance policy] because it's almost half of the
meetings each quarter," said Senate Chair
Branden Crouch 'l4.
Senator Ashley Harris 'l5 has been absent
from both of the Senate's first on-campus meet
ings this year. Additionally, President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 and Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 were also absent, and thus unable
to give an executive update.
