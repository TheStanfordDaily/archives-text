## VPUE Cardinal Compass a hit with the Class of 2016 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Cardinal Compass, a new online tool for
freshmen released by the office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE), reached 17,000 page views since its
launch on Aug. 1 despite some freshmen argu
ing that the site's offerings are too broad.
"With the recent changes in undergraduate
education, the Class of 2016 will have fewer
required courses than previous years and more
room to explore," Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education Harry Elam wrote
in an email to The Daily.
"Cardinal Compass is designed to help
freshmen navigate the many first-year courses
available to them and delve into the connec
tions and interests that they develop here at
Stanford," he added.
The online tool breaks down many of the
freshman-oriented classes at Stanford, detail
ing in particular the new Thinking Matters
courses.
It also organizes the many Thinking
Matters, Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) and Introductory Seminars into differ
ent tags, allowing freshmen to filter and search
through catalogues based on their interests.
These tags are referred to as a "subject,"
which corresponds to themes such as art, envi
ronment, and medicine, and "approaches,"
which categorizes courses according to the crit
ical activities and skills exercised in the classes,
such as collaborative, experimental and socio
logical skills.
Based on the number of current page views
on the tool, Tegan Bradford, director of com
munications and strategic initiatives for VPUE,
said that Cardinal Compass is effectively serv
ing the freshman class.
"With the Cardinal Compass audience
being Stanford freshmen, a group of 1768 this
year, we take that as a good sign that students
are exploring multiple pages across the tool
and see the Cardinal Compass as a resource
they can come back to," Bradford said.
Annie Phan 'l6 does not use the website
because she says the overwhelming flow of
information does not allow her to focus on spe-

cific questions.
"I prefer working on a person-to-person
level especially when it comes to something as
important as our future," Phan said. "There are
so many nuts and bolts to it that you can't put
it all on a website."
Erica McDowell 'l6 sympathizes with
Phan. She believes the site is lacking at provid
ing details for someone who already has a plan
set out.
"Because I already have an idea of where
I'm heading in engineering I didn't find that I
got a lot of new information out of it,"
McDowell said. "It seemed more useful for
someone who had no clue what they were
going to do next."
She did add that it was helpful to see
numerous academic opportunities on campus
in case her academic plan changed along the
way.
Kirsti Copeland, director of residentially
based advising, said that while the site is
intended as a resource, it is not intended to take
students away from other resources on campus.
"We do not intend for freshmen to use this
electronic tool as a substitute for seeking
advice from their pre-major advisor, academic
director or academic advisor for student-ath
letes, but rather as a starting point for a more
informed conversation," Copeland said.
Haley Kong 'l5 said that it introduces stu
dents to a variety of courses in a relatively effi
cient way.
"They can search for a subject but then they
can learn about the other classes that would
otherwise be outranked in the bulletin. I think
it's really hard to find those specialized semi
nars," Kong said. "I kind of wish I had some
thing like that."
According to Bradford, new student tools
like Cardinal Compass may be on the way to
address more needs.
"As we hear from students about what they
find most useful about the Cardinal Compass
and what features they would like to see us
add, we hope to build an even more robust tool
in future years," Bradford said.
