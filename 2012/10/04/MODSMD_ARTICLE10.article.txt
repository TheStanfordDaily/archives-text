# Smallpox virus may treat breast cancer, Stanford researcher finds
## THE 						DAILY NEWS STAFF 
### â€” Natasha Weaser 
Stanford School of Medicine researcher
Sepideh Gholami is the lead author of a recent
ly published study conducted by the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
City that suggests that a version of smallpox,
vaccinia virus, can be used to fight a form of
breast cancer called Triple Negative Breast
Cancer (TNBC).
Breast cancer is the second-most common
form of cancer for women in the United States,
affecting more than 125 per 100,000 women.
TNBC affects approximately 10 to 20 percent
of all breast cancer patients and is known for
being aggressive and displaying a high recur
rence rate. Patients suffering from TNBC do
not have three biological receptors estro
gen, progesterone and HER 2 that are tar
geted to respond to existing treatments.
"One of the reasons I wanted to focus on
TNBC is that there aren't many long-term
treatment options," Gholami said in an inter
view with ABC News.
According to the study, laboratory tests
conducted on TNBC-infected mice show that
the virus has the capability to infect and then
break down the cancerous cells while also
blocking the development of tumor blood ves
sels. In four days, 90 percent of the cancerous
cells were destroyed.
"Based upon pathology, we could see that
at least 60 percent of the tumors were com
pletely regressed and the other 40 percent had
very little areas of tumor cells present with a lot
of necrosis (die off), which is a sign that the
tumor was responding to therapy," Gholami
said in an interview with The Daily Mail.
Gholami presented her research at
American College of Surgeons' Annual
Clinical Congress in Chicago on Oct. 1. A clin
ical trial will soon follow.
