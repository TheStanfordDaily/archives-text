## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em 
### Renée Donovan 
Last Friday night, I got a
Facebook account. The people
who know me were shocked,
amused and, almost across the
board, posted one message on my
Timeline: "you caved!"
I had a Facebook account in high
school until I freaked out one day
during sophomore year and deleted
it. I was upset because I didn't know
what a friend's handwriting looked
like. I started writing letters, fell out
of touch with most of my acquain
tances, and became a much better
friend to the eight or 10 with whom I
stayed in touch.
On my new Facebook account, I
have 85 friends. Eighty-five! Eighty
five people are more than I could
call up or write to in a whole month.
Which is a good thing, since the
whole reason I caved and got a
Facebook on Friday was to increase
the readership of my column.
Friday night I also found myself
having a great time at an all-cam
pus frat party. I don't consider
myself the all-campus frat party
type, but the people were friendly,
the music was too loud and the
dance floor was awesomely disgust-

ing. The kind of disgusting where it
rains condensed sweat from the
ceiling.
I felt very savvy and self-impor
tant for going against the grain when
I stepped out of Stanford last May
and set off for New York City and
conservatory ballet training. I was
living the dream. I imagined it as the
counterpoint to a Stanford about
which I felt jaded, yet the frustra
tions I encountered in Alphabet City
were almost identical to those I com
plained about at the Farm. The East
Village had a social currency as lim
ited as East Campus. I had left the
frat parties for a scene I felt more
accurately fit my self-image, and I
had been duped.
Needless to say, a year away
from Stanford was a humbling
wake-up call that reminded me how
special this place is. Now I'm back,
taking the Humßio core, frequent
ing frat parties and having a great
time. I was worried my friends
would be angry at me when I told
them I got a Facebook, that they
might mock me for being too main
stream, for succumbing to "the
man." When I confessed my anxiety

on the phone, a friend laughed and
told me, "Renee, there's no shame
in being an average college stu
dent."
Frats and Facebook aren't things
I generally include in my self-image.
Neither is the word average. But I
don't get to exclude something from
the person that is "Renee," just
because I don't subscribe to the val
ues that thing might represent.
I bring this up because it can be
isolating to hold yourself too strictly
to your principles. It allows you to
misjudge entire communities and
places you might actually enjoy. You
are allowed to change your mind.
And as much as it pains me to say
this, you don't get to decide who you
are based on abstract ideas; you
become the person you are by lean
ing into the things that make you
happy and trusting that you will
stumble into an identity that fits
right.

P.S. I also got a Twitter account. I'm
still unclear on how it works, but fol
low me on Twitter (@reneeßdonovan)
for more articles, and, while you're
at it, friend me on Facebook.
