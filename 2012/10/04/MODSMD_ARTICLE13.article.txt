# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## In Defense of American Teachers 
### Adam Johnson 
Although isolated to Chicago,
the highly publicized strike
between the Chicago
Teachers Union and Chicago Public
Schools (CPS) represented a broad
er struggle occurring in school dis
tricts across America.
A major point of contention in
Chicago was the role of value-added
models (VAMs) in evaluating teach
ers. The school district wanted these
models to account for up to 45 per
cent of a teacher's evaluation score,
but the two sides compromised at 30
percent. This metric would have been
used to dismiss teachers deemed
ineffective and determine pay scales
for those who remained.
The VAM evaluation tool pro
vides a relatively quick way to
numerically rank teachers by com
paring students' standardized test
scores from year to year. The
Chicago teachers, however, maintain
that evaluating teachers using this
method is problematic.
They are hardly alone in this
fight. Linda Darling-Hammond, a
professor at the Stanford School of
Education, is a prominent
spokesperson against VAMs. She
argues that the models cannot
account for outside factors like a stu
dent's health and attendance; that
the models are highly unstable, as a
teacher's rating from one year to the
next can change drastically; that
VAMs unfairly assess teachers who
have English-language learners
and/or students with disabilities; and
that a reliance on test-scores priori
tizes teaching to the test over pro
moting critical thinking and prob
lem-solving skills.
Others have pointed out that
VAMs do not provide teachers with
specific methods to improve their
craft, whereas in-person evaluations
if conducted by qualified profes
sionals have that ability.
Indeed, many educational experts
and even testing agencies agree that
having VAMs account for a large
percentage of a teacher's total evalu
ation score is against the best inter
ests of both teachers and their stu
dents. And merit pay, which was pro
posed in Chicago, was found by a
recent Vanderbilt study to be largely
ineffective at promoting student
achievement.
But despite the fact that these
policies have come under pro
nounced criticism from educational
experts, many politicians and com
mentators continue to support them.
The New York Times Editorial
Board, in a scalding attack on the
strike, labeled Chicago's highly
imperfect evaluation and merit pay
proposals as "sensible policy."
Perhaps this continued insistence
on flawed approaches stems from
ignorance. More likely, however, is
that it is representative of a broader
national trend: expecting too much
of our teachers. We all want the best
teachers in our schools, but when
politicians and technocrats prioritize
teacher evaluations and merit pay,
they send the message that teachers
are the primary problem with the
American education system.
If only we could place a good
teacher in every classroom, one often
hears, poor student achievement
would all but disappear. Yet this
argument overlooks the fact that stu
dents spend only a fraction of their
waking hours in school. Education,

defined broadly, occurs at school and
at home, during weekdays and on
weekends, in October and July. For
poor students in areas of concentrat
ed poverty — more than 80 percent
of CPS students qualify for free
lunches — the home and neighbor
hood environment has a profound
damaging effect on academic
achievement. By viewing teachers as
solely responsible for a student's per
formance, critics of the strike thus
ignore the realities that these
Chicago teachers face every day.
The widespread trend of teacher
blaming also fails to account for the
fact that American students are actu
ally getting better at reading and
math, according to a study per
formed by the National Assessment
of Educational Progress. Black and
Hispanic students are narrowing the
achievement gap with white stu
dents.

Other studies show that
American students are improving
relative to their peers in other coun
tries (contrary to popular belief, our
students were never ranked that high
to begin with). And when we exam
ine the performance of middle and
upper-class students in adequately
funded schools, America ranks near
the top. If we blame teachers for
poor student achievement, surely we
should give them credit for these
educational gains. Instead, we blame
them for poor outcomes and ignore
the improvements. If we truly want
to make the teaching profession
more attractive, this approach cannot
be the way forward.
Mitt Romney, who joined Mayor
Emanuel in opposing the strike,
claimed that the teachers' interests
"conflicted] with those of our chil
dren." No, the unions are not perfect,
but they had every right to defend
their practice against policies that
ignored the research on the roles of
merit pay, VAMs and teacher morale
in student achievement.
The strike made working condi
tions better for Chicago's teachers,
which should translate into better
classroom environments for the chil
dren. Teachers, especially in school
districts like Chicago, often face an
uphill battle. We should not support
measures that make their task that
much more difficult. We should stop
blaming teachers for factors outside
their control, stop insisting that they
be evaluated and paid under flawed
systems and start giving them the
respect they deserve.
