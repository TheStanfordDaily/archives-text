## OLYMPIC SPECIAL BACK ON THE FARM SEVEN STANFORD OLYMPIANS SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES 
### 
Stanford student athletes and alumni
brought home 12 golds and 20 medals in
total from this summer's Olympic and
Paralympic Games in London. Ahead of
a ceremony that will honor the
Cardinal's Olympians at halftime during the
Homecoming football game against Arizona this
weekend, The Daily had a chance to talk to seven
current students who competed at the Games.
Today and tomorrow we will feature, in their
own words, the Olympic and Paralympic experi
ences of US women's water polo teammates and
London 2012 gold medalists senior Melissa
Seidemann, junior Annika Dries and freshman
Maggie Steffens; senior American synchronized
swimmer Mariya Koroleva,; Australian freshman
400-meter sprinter Steven Solomon; Canadian
sophomore gymnast Kristina Vaculik; and
American Paralympian and double-silver- and
double-bronze-medal winning senior Roy Perkins.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What kind of allegiance
did you maintain to the Farm while competing as
an athlete from a entire country?

"I hated Stanford when I was little," Steffens
said. "My parents went to Cal, my cousins went to
Cal. Everybody pretty much was Cal Berkeley ...

But then once my sister came here and I came on
campus and I got to experience the whole Stanford

family I was like: 'Wait, this place is awesome.'"
"I feel a lot of camaraderie," Solomon said. "It's
weird because I have only been here for a week,
but I think it's the environment that I'm in.
Stanford especially has a great sporting culture. I've
gone to watch soccer, I've gone to watch football. I
go to watch everything because not only do I want
to watch it, but everyone wants to watch it
whether you're a pure academic, whether you
couldn't catch a ball if it was to save your life. You
enjoy being a part of a wider team, and that's been
really good, really fun."
"I love this place," Dries said. "I missed it.
Stanford's just an amazing place and has amazing
people that you just run into. It's an amazing com
munity."
TSD: How do you balance your athletic and aca
demic lives?
"There always is difficulty balancing," Vaculik
said. "But I have been doing it for my whole life,
through elementary school, high school and then
one year of university, so I'm kind of used to not
having a lot of excess time."
"I saw my life as three different zones,"
Solomon said. "I had my athletics zone, my school
zone and my social zone. And my athletics was a
way out of my school zone, and then my social life
was away out of my athletics zone. So if I kept the

balance right, everything went perfectly. It
improved my time management dramatically. I
pretty much didn't procrastinate, because I didn't
have time to procrastinate. The only part that was a
bit hard was sometimes sleep."
"It's tough," Perkins said. "I took winter and
spring quarter off last year."
TSD: What is it like to have to spend so much time
practicing and preparing for the Games?
"There's a big difference [between] collegiate
synchro and national team synchro," Koroleva said,
"but the coaches at Stanford really prepared me
mentally and physically for what national team
training was going to be like. [Stanford assistant
coach] Sara Lowe, [Stanford head coach] Heather
Olson they were both Olympians, they've been
through it before. They told me, 'Watch out for this,
and make sure you remember that.'"
"We were in full-time residential training in
Southern California [during the last academic
year]," Seidemann said, "so in order for us to be
able to pursue this opportunity we had to move
down to Southern California and be with the
team. The two of us [Seidemann and Dries] got
really lucky. The team actually went into full time
training in January 2011 when our season was

going on, and the head nation
al team coach gave us the
opportunity to stay at school
and finish our season and join
up with the team that summer
for a year of training."
"When I'm up here I swim
with Palo Alto Stanford
Aquatics," Perkins said. "It's a
club team, [and] it's mostly
high school swimmers, which is
similar to how I train at home.
There's a lot of flexibility, so it's
been good."

TSD: The competition you all
faced at the Games is intense
by any standard. What is that
like to go even beyond the
competiveness of Stanford's
Div. I athletics?
"The competition itself is
very much like any world com
petition or the Pan American
Games," Koroleva said. "I
think the main difference for
us was the pressure; there was
so much pressure on us. We
were the only two girls from
the US competing in the
Olympics for synchronized
swimming because our team
didn't qualify and for the tech
nical program we swam first, so

we were the first people to
open the competition for syn
chro. So a lot was riding on us."
"I can remember sitting in
the waiting area, and being like:
'Guys I'm so nervous right now,
so nervous I don't know what to
do,'" Seidemann said. "Then
you get in there, you play your
first game [which the US won
14-13 against Hungary]. It was
very chaotic for us there
were some things out of order
[and] everything was really
intense. [We were] scoring lots
of goals: Maggie [Steffens]
scored seven goals, there was
just so much going on.
But by the end of the tour
nament you could see the pro

gression the team made. That
second game we went in there
and it was just water polo. It
was like what we do every day
in practice, every other game
we play. That made that final
game against Spain just a piece
of cake. We were really able to
just have fun and enjoy our
selves, playing water polo with
our friends instead of thinking
about, 'Oh my God, there's
millions and millions of view
ers watching us at home."'

were the only two girls from
the US competing in the
Olympics for synchronized
swimming because our team
didn't qualify and for the tech
nical program we swam first, so

we were the first people to
open the competition for syn

"I can remember sitting in
the waiting area, and being like:
'Guys I'm so nervous right now,
so nervous I don't know what to
do,'" Seidemann said. "Then
you get in there, you play your
first game [which the US won
14-13 against Hungary]. It was
very chaotic for us there
were some things out of order
[and] everything was really
intense. [We were] scoring lots
of goals: Maggie [Steffens]
scored seven goals, there was
just so much going on.
But by the end of the tour
nament you could see the pro

gression the team made. That
second game we went in there
and it was just water polo. It
was like what we do every day
in practice, every other game
we play. That made that final
game against Spain just a piece
of cake. We were really able to
just have fun and enjoy our
selves, playing water polo with
our friends instead of thinking
about, 'Oh my God, there's
millions and millions of view
ers watching us at home."'

Village, how the athletes felt
about their achievements and

what their future plans are.
Stanford student athletes and alumni
brought home 12 golds and 20 medals in
total from this summer's Olympic and
Paralympic Games in London. Ahead of
a ceremony that will honor the
Cardinal's Olympians at halftime during the
Homecoming football game against Arizona this
weekend, The Daily had a chance to talk to seven
current students who competed at the Games.
Today and tomorrow we will feature, in their
own words, the Olympic and Paralympic experi
ences of US women's water polo teammates and
London 2012 gold medalists senior Melissa
Seidemann, junior Annika Dries and freshman
Maggie Steffens; senior American synchronized
swimmer Mariya Koroleva,; Australian freshman
400-meter sprinter Steven Solomon; Canadian
sophomore gymnast Kristina Vaculik; and
American Paralympian and double-silver- and
double-bronze-medal winning senior Roy Perkins.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What kind of allegiance
did you maintain to the Farm while competing as
an athlete from a entire country?

"I hated Stanford when I was little," Steffens
said. "My parents went to Cal, my cousins went to
Cal. Everybody pretty much was Cal Berkeley ...

But then once my sister came here and I came on
campus and I got to experience the whole Stanford

family I was like: 'Wait, this place is awesome.'"
"I feel a lot of camaraderie," Solomon said. "It's
weird because I have only been here for a week,
but I think it's the environment that I'm in.
Stanford especially has a great sporting culture. I've
gone to watch soccer, I've gone to watch football. I
go to watch everything because not only do I want
to watch it, but everyone wants to watch it
whether you're a pure academic, whether you
couldn't catch a ball if it was to save your life. You
enjoy being a part of a wider team, and that's been
really good, really fun."
"I love this place," Dries said. "I missed it.
Stanford's just an amazing place and has amazing
people that you just run into. It's an amazing com
munity."
TSD: How do you balance your athletic and aca
demic lives?
"There always is difficulty balancing," Vaculik
said. "But I have been doing it for my whole life,
through elementary school, high school and then
one year of university, so I'm kind of used to not
having a lot of excess time."
"I saw my life as three different zones,"
Solomon said. "I had my athletics zone, my school
zone and my social zone. And my athletics was a
way out of my school zone, and then my social life
was away out of my athletics zone. So if I kept the

balance right, everything went perfectly. It
improved my time management dramatically. I
pretty much didn't procrastinate, because I didn't
have time to procrastinate. The only part that was a
bit hard was sometimes sleep."
"It's tough," Perkins said. "I took winter and
spring quarter off last year."
TSD: What is it like to have to spend so much time
practicing and preparing for the Games?
"There's a big difference [between] collegiate
synchro and national team synchro," Koroleva said,
"but the coaches at Stanford really prepared me
mentally and physically for what national team
training was going to be like. [Stanford assistant
coach] Sara Lowe, [Stanford head coach] Heather
Olson they were both Olympians, they've been
through it before. They told me, 'Watch out for this,
and make sure you remember that.'"
"We were in full-time residential training in
Southern California [during the last academic
year]," Seidemann said, "so in order for us to be
able to pursue this opportunity we had to move
down to Southern California and be with the
team. The two of us [Seidemann and Dries] got
really lucky. The team actually went into full time
training in January 2011 when our season was

going on, and the head nation
al team coach gave us the
opportunity to stay at school
and finish our season and join
up with the team that summer
for a year of training."
"When I'm up here I swim
with Palo Alto Stanford
Aquatics," Perkins said. "It's a
club team, [and] it's mostly
high school swimmers, which is
similar to how I train at home.
There's a lot of flexibility, so it's
been good."

TSD: The competition you all
faced at the Games is intense
by any standard. What is that
like to go even beyond the
competiveness of Stanford's
Div. I athletics?
"The competition itself is
very much like any world com
petition or the Pan American
Games," Koroleva said. "I
think the main difference for
us was the pressure; there was
so much pressure on us. We
were the only two girls from
the US competing in the
Olympics for synchronized
swimming because our team
didn't qualify and for the tech
