## OLYMPIC SPECIAL BACK ON THE FARM SEVEN STANFORD OLYMPIANS SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES 
### 
Stanford student athletes and alumni
brought home 12 golds and 20 medals in
total from this summer's Olympic and
Paralympic Games in London. Ahead of
a ceremony that will honor the
Cardinal's Olympians at halftime during the
Homecoming football game against Arizona this
weekend, The Daily had a chance to talk to seven
current students who competed at the Games.
Today and tomorrow we will feature, in their
own words, the Olympic and Paralympic experi
ences of US women's water polo teammates and
London 2012 gold medalists senior Melissa
Seidemann, junior Annika Dries and freshman
Maggie Steffens; senior American synchronized
swimmer Mariya Koroleva,; Australian freshman
400-meter sprinter Steven Solomon; Canadian
sophomore gymnast Kristina Vaculik; and
American Paralympian and double-silver- and
double-bronze-medal winning senior Roy Perkins.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): What kind of allegiance
did you maintain to the Farm while competing as
an athlete from a entire country?

"I hated Stanford when I was little," Steffens
said. "My parents went to Cal, my cousins went to
Cal. Everybody pretty much was Cal Berkeley ...

But then once my sister came here and I came on
campus and I got to experience the whole Stanford

family I was like: 'Wait, this place is awesome.'"
"I feel a lot of camaraderie," Solomon said. "It's
weird because I have only been here for a week,
but I think it's the environment that I'm in.
Stanford especially has a great sporting culture. I've
gone to watch soccer, I've gone to watch football. I
go to watch everything because not only do I want
to watch it, but everyone wants to watch it
whether you're a pure academic, whether you
couldn't catch a ball if it was to save your life. You
enjoy being a part of a wider team, and that's been
really good, really fun."
"I love this place," Dries said. "I missed it.
Stanford's just an amazing place and has amazing
people that you just run into. It's an amazing com
munity."
TSD: How do you balance your athletic and aca
demic lives?
"There always is difficulty balancing," Vaculik
said. "But I have been doing it for my whole life,
through elementary school, high school and then
one year of university, so I'm kind of used to not
having a lot of excess time."
"I saw my life as three different zones,"
Solomon said. "I had my athletics zone, my school
zone and my social zone. And my athletics was a
way out of my school zone, and then my social life
was away out of my athletics zone. So if I kept the

balance right, everything went perfectly. It
improved my time management dramatically. I
pretty much didn't procrastinate, because I didn't
have time to procrastinate. The only part that was a
bit hard was sometimes sleep."
"It's tough," Perkins said. "I took winter and
spring quarter off last year."
TSD: What is it like to have to spend so much time
practicing and preparing for the Games?
"There's a big difference [between] collegiate
synchro and national team synchro," Koroleva said,
"but the coaches at Stanford really prepared me
mentally and physically for what national team
training was going to be like. [Stanford assistant
coach] Sara Lowe, [Stanford head coach] Heather
Olson they were both Olympians, they've been
through it before. They told me, 'Watch out for this,
and make sure you remember that.'"
"We were in full-time residential training in
Southern California [during the last academic
year]," Seidemann said, "so in order for us to be
able to pursue this opportunity we had to move
down to Southern California and be with the
team. The two of us [Seidemann and Dries] got
really lucky. The team actually went into full time
training in January 2011 when our season was

Senior Melissa Seidemann (2) was MPSF Newcomer of the Year in 2009 and led the team in goals in 2011 as the Cardinal won the NCAA
Championship. She topped all of that this summer, winning a gold medal in water polo with Team USA at the 2012 London Olympics.
