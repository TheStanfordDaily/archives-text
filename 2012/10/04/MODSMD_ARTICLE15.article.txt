## Rodgers repeats at Olympia Fields CARD COMES IN FOURTH 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
has still never felt the sting of
defeat at the Olympia Fields
Invitational. After winning the
event at Olympia Fields Country
Club in his first- ever college
rounds last fall, Rodgers convinc
ingly defended his victory this
weekend, shooting a final round
67 to win by five shots.
Although Rodgers' win was
the main story of the weekend,
freshman David Boote also dis
tinguished himself in his first col
lege tournament, shooting an
aggregate score of +4 to tie for
seventh.

"David had a really nice
freshman start, did a really good
job with managing the conditions
and played really solidly," head
coach Conrad Ray said. "He'll
continue to improve and get bet
ter, and I think he was excited to
have a chance to crack the top
five. It was a good effort."
"It was nice to get off to a
good solid start," Boote said.
"The golf course is one of the
best I've played."
As a team, the Cardinal fin
ished in a tie for fourth, 19 shots
behind the winner, Arkansas.

"We have some stuff that we
can build 0n... There were a lot
of good things out there on the
golf course. I think everybody

struck [the ball] well, but...
there's always stuff we can
improve on, so we're going to
focus on that going forward,"
Rodgers said. "The goal is to win
every tournament, so although
there were some positives that
we can take from our fourth
place finish, we're definitely not
satisfied."
Rodgers, a first team PING
All-American and Hogan Award
finalist last season, said that a
preseason team trip to Scotland
gave players "good vibes" enter
ing the first tournament.
While in Scotland, team mem
bers competed in friendly match
es against Scottish colleges and
played several links courses,
including world-renowned
British Open hosts Carnoustie
and Turnberry.
"It was a great chance to jell
and bond with the team before
the quarter started," Boote said.
Players will have little time to
recuperate after flying home
Tuesday evening. Starting next
Monday, the team will take on
conference rivals in the inaugural
Pac-12 Preview, held at Pumpkin
Ridge Golf Club in Portland,
Ore.
As usual, the Pac-12 will be a
highly competitive conference
this year, with three teams,
including top-ranked Cal, cur
rently occupying the top-10 of
Golfweek magazine's national
rankings.
Making this weekend's tour
nament more challenging is the

fact that the team is compet
ing short-handed.
Junior Cameron Wilson,
who earned a spot in the 2012
U.S. Open, is out with a back
injury, and senior standout
Andrew Yun, who won All-
Pac 12 First Team honors last
year, is taking the quarter off
to try to make it through the
PGA Tour's qualifying school.
"His [Yun's] presence will
be missed, but we're all root
ing for him and it gives some
other guys a really good
opportunity to step up and
play well," Rodgers said.
"Maybe we'll have him back
in the spring, maybe not, but I
think regardless, we'll have a
strong team come spring."
Ray believes this team has
the potential to be better than
last year's team, which quali
fied for the NCAA
Championship but stumbled
in the national tournament,
finishing in a tie for 19th in a

field of 30.
"If you look at maybe
those two other guys [Yun
and Wilson] maybe coming
back in, and the "depth we're
hopefully going to have ... I
think we're going to be a
good team," Ray said.
Following the Pac-12
Preview, the team will finish off
the fall season with a tour
nament in Georgia, the com
petitive U.S. Intercollegiate
Championships, and two tour
naments in Northern California.
After a three-month break, the
team will resume tournament
play in early February, starting
with the Amer Ari Invitational
in Hawaii.
"We play a tough sched
ule, and I think that being
able to get a little bit better
every time out is going to be
our goal," Ray said. "There's
a lot you can learn playing
really tough competition on
good golf courses... It's all
preparation for the NCAA
Championship and what lies
ahead."
