## Rodgers repeats at Olympia Fields CARD COMES IN FOURTH 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
has still never felt the sting of
defeat at the Olympia Fields
Invitational. After winning the
event at Olympia Fields Country
Club in his first- ever college
rounds last fall, Rodgers convinc
ingly defended his victory this
weekend, shooting a final round
67 to win by five shots.
Although Rodgers' win was
the main story of the weekend,
freshman David Boote also dis
tinguished himself in his first col
lege tournament, shooting an
aggregate score of +4 to tie for
seventh.

"David had a really nice
freshman start, did a really good
job with managing the conditions
and played really solidly," head
coach Conrad Ray said. "He'll
continue to improve and get bet
ter, and I think he was excited to
have a chance to crack the top
five. It was a good effort."
"It was nice to get off to a
good solid start," Boote said.
"The golf course is one of the
best I've played."
As a team, the Cardinal fin
ished in a tie for fourth, 19 shots
behind the winner, Arkansas.

"We have some stuff that we
can build 0n... There were a lot
of good things out there on the
golf course. I think everybody

struck [the ball] well, but...
there's always stuff we can
improve on, so we're going to
focus on that going forward,"
Rodgers said. "The goal is to win
every tournament, so although
there were some positives that
we can take from our fourth
place finish, we're definitely not
satisfied."
Rodgers, a first team PING
All-American and Hogan Award
finalist last season, said that a
preseason team trip to Scotland
gave players "good vibes" enter
ing the first tournament.
While in Scotland, team mem
bers competed in friendly match
es against Scottish colleges and
played several links courses,
including world-renowned
British Open hosts Carnoustie
and Turnberry.
"It was a great chance to jell
and bond with the team before
the quarter started," Boote said.
Players will have little time to
recuperate after flying home
Tuesday evening. Starting next
Monday, the team will take on
conference rivals in the inaugural
Pac-12 Preview, held at Pumpkin
Ridge Golf Club in Portland,
Ore.
As usual, the Pac-12 will be a
highly competitive conference
this year, with three teams,
including top-ranked Cal, cur
rently occupying the top-10 of
Golfweek magazine's national
rankings.
