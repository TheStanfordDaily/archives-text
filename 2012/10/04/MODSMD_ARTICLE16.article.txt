# Trout is this year's top catch
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Let's put all the cards on the
table —Mike Trout has been
an absolute godsend for my
fantasy baseball team. OK, we
can begin.
Mike Trout is getting robbed. It's as
if Trout wasn't just forced to dress as a
baby, but he also was forced to be a
baby, and Miguel Cabrera walked in
and took his candy, err MVE
For those of you who do not know,
Miguel Cabrera is the third baseman for
the Detroit Tigers, just won the Triple
Crown for the first time since Carl
Yastrzemski in 1968 and is now the pro
hibitive favorite to win the American
League MVP this season.
And it's flat out wrong.
Plenty of people have been hooked
onto the Trout bandwagon —all of my
puns are always intended but as
someone who followed the 21-year old
rookie from the beginning, let me tell
you why it shouldn't just be men in suits
poring over stat sheets who agree that
Trout deserves the trophy.
Let's begin with the reasons Cabrera
deserves to put the award on his mantle
when the Baseball Writers' Association
of America announces the winner in a
few weeks.
Reason No. 1: The Triple Crown is
awesome, sacrosanct and anyone who
wins the batting title, RBI title and home
run crown in the same season has to be
the best player that year, maybe even in
the conversation for greatest player of all
time.
Except that I fooled you with my
sarcasm.
Reason No. 1 is a trap that people
want you to fall into the Triple
Crown is not awesome, and while
Cabrera is having a great year, it's not
better than Trout's. Just look at the num
bers.
Trout's triple-slash is .326/.398/.962.
He scored 130 runs. He hit eight triples,
had 49 steals, was caught stealing just
five times and oh, yeah, hit 30 home runs
as well. In 138 games. That's stupid good,
but some people tell you it's not enough.
Because Cabrera was damn good
himself The slugging Colombian hit .330
with 44 home runs and 137 RBI. In most
years, those numbers will lock you into
the trophy early in September. But not
when you try to take on a man whose
game is as good as his name is fishy.
If they gave an award each season to
the player who had at least 30 home
runs, 45 stolen bases and 125 runs, Trout
would be the first to win it.
Because no player in history has
done it before. And Trout did it in 138
games. I'm no historian, but "never done
before" sounds at least a little better
than "last done in 1967."
That doesn't even begin to get into
the real nerdy stats, like Wins Above
Replacement (WAR). WAR is sup
posed to be an all-encompassing saber
metric stat that shows how a player con
tributes to his team based on all facets of
his game. Literally, WAR represents the
best estimation of how many wins a
player is worth when compared to a
baseline "replacement" player.
According to Fan Graphs analytics,
Mike Trout's WAR this season is 10.3, in
138 games. Miguel Cabrera's was 7.1.
Cabrera has even been passed by anoth
er player, Robinson Cano, mostly
because his defense is, well, porous.
Trout's, on the other hand, has been
unbelievable. Don't believe me? Just
ask J.J. Hardy, who was robbed of a
home run that would have cleared the
fence by a good four feet had Trout's
leap not been perfect. Or Gordon
Beckham, who was likewise victimized
by the Trout. Or Miguel Olivo, who had
almost rounded second base when
Trout's glove came back over the wall
with Olivo's blast in the webbing.
Cabrera? He has 13 errors —which
is not all that shabby—but he is ranked
as one of the slowest fielders with one of
the smallest range in the big leagues,
costing his team close to 10 runs over the
course of the season.
For those who smugly note that
Cabrera didn't need those runs, or those
extra wins because his team is sitting in
the playoffs while Trout sits in his par
ents' home (where he still lives), I say for
shame. The Detroit Tigers would have
finished fourth in the AL West, a full four
games behind the Angels, and playing in
one of the weakest divisions (the AL
Central) is nothing to be proud of
In any other year, I'd be the first one to
say that Miggy's accomplishment is awe
some and truly deserving of the MVE But
history is not kind to players that cater
solely to the "Big Three" of statistics.
Manny Ramirez had an unbeliev
able season in 1999, quite honestly a sea
son for the ages. Man-Ram hit .333 that

year, with 44 home runs and a
whopping 165 RBI in 147
games. And he didn't win the
MVP because Ivan Rodriguez
had a great offensive year and
was a much more valuable
defender as a standout defensive
catcher.

Heck, Ted Williams won the
Triple Crown in 1947 and even
the Splendid Splinter didn't take
home the "E"

What I am saying is just that
we need to look more closely
and completely at athletes these
days, because we have more
data to add to the good old eye
test. The Triple Crown is an
amazing achievement that
Cabrera should be proud of But
what it really means is that he
had a great year and other peo

pie might not have had their best
years or might have gotten hurt.
Josh Hamilton surely would
have won the home run title if
he hadn't missed 10 games after
drinking too much caffeine and
getting dry corneas.Trout would
have had even better numbers,
maybe closer to 100 RBI, 35
homers and 60 steals if he hadn't
gotten a bad virus in spring
training and been sent to the
minor leagues to begin the year.
Crazy things happen, and I

take nothing away from
Cabrera, but Mike Trout is the
MVE Full disclosure —I own a
Mike Trout fish hat

Miles Bennett-Smith also
would vote for Ryan Braun as
the NL MVP, because the man
beat the rap. If you'd like to tell
him all the reasons baby-faced
Buster Posey will be MVP,
send him an email at miles
bs@stanford.edu or follow him
on Twitter @SmilesBSmith.

son for the ages. Man-Ram hit .333 that

year, with 44 home runs and a
whopping 165 RBI in 147
games. And he didn't win the
MVP because Ivan Rodriguez
had a great offensive year and
was a much more valuable
defender as a standout defensive
catcher.

Heck, Ted Williams won the
Triple Crown in 1947 and even
the Splendid Splinter didn't take
home the "E"

What I am saying is just that
we need to look more closely
and completely at athletes these
days, because we have more
data to add to the good old eye
test. The Triple Crown is an
amazing achievement that
Cabrera should be proud of But
what it really means is that he
had a great year and other peo

pie might not have had their best
years or might have gotten hurt.
Josh Hamilton surely would
have won the home run title if
he hadn't missed 10 games after
drinking too much caffeine and
getting dry corneas.Trout would
have had even better numbers,
maybe closer to 100 RBI, 35
homers and 60 steals if he hadn't
gotten a bad virus in spring
training and been sent to the
minor leagues to begin the year.
Crazy things happen, and I

take nothing away from
Cabrera, but Mike Trout is the
MVE Full disclosure —I own a
Mike Trout fish hat

Miles Bennett-Smith also
would vote for Ryan Braun as
the NL MVP, because the man
beat the rap. If you'd like to tell
him all the reasons baby-faced
Buster Posey will be MVP,
send him an email at miles

Let's put all the cards on the
table —Mike Trout has been
an absolute godsend for my
fantasy baseball team. OK, we
can begin.
Mike Trout is getting robbed. It's as
if Trout wasn't just forced to dress as a
baby, but he also was forced to be a
baby, and Miguel Cabrera walked in
and took his candy, err MVE
For those of you who do not know,
Miguel Cabrera is the third baseman for
the Detroit Tigers, just won the Triple
Crown for the first time since Carl
Yastrzemski in 1968 and is now the pro
hibitive favorite to win the American
League MVP this season.
And it's flat out wrong.
Plenty of people have been hooked
onto the Trout bandwagon —all of my
puns are always intended but as
someone who followed the 21-year old
rookie from the beginning, let me tell
you why it shouldn't just be men in suits
poring over stat sheets who agree that
Trout deserves the trophy.
Let's begin with the reasons Cabrera
deserves to put the award on his mantle
when the Baseball Writers' Association
of America announces the winner in a
few weeks.
Reason No. 1: The Triple Crown is
awesome, sacrosanct and anyone who
wins the batting title, RBI title and home
run crown in the same season has to be
the best player that year, maybe even in
the conversation for greatest player of all
time.
Except that I fooled you with my
sarcasm.
Reason No. 1 is a trap that people
want you to fall into the Triple
Crown is not awesome, and while
Cabrera is having a great year, it's not
better than Trout's. Just look at the num
bers.
Trout's triple-slash is .326/.398/.962.
He scored 130 runs. He hit eight triples,
had 49 steals, was caught stealing just
five times and oh, yeah, hit 30 home runs
as well. In 138 games. That's stupid good,
but some people tell you it's not enough.
Because Cabrera was damn good
himself The slugging Colombian hit .330
with 44 home runs and 137 RBI. In most
years, those numbers will lock you into
the trophy early in September. But not
when you try to take on a man whose
game is as good as his name is fishy.
If they gave an award each season to
the player who had at least 30 home
runs, 45 stolen bases and 125 runs, Trout
would be the first to win it.
Because no player in history has
done it before. And Trout did it in 138
games. I'm no historian, but "never done
before" sounds at least a little better
than "last done in 1967."
That doesn't even begin to get into
the real nerdy stats, like Wins Above
Replacement (WAR). WAR is sup
posed to be an all-encompassing saber
metric stat that shows how a player con
tributes to his team based on all facets of
his game. Literally, WAR represents the
best estimation of how many wins a
player is worth when compared to a
baseline "replacement" player.
According to Fan Graphs analytics,
Mike Trout's WAR this season is 10.3, in
138 games. Miguel Cabrera's was 7.1.
Cabrera has even been passed by anoth
er player, Robinson Cano, mostly
because his defense is, well, porous.
Trout's, on the other hand, has been
unbelievable. Don't believe me? Just
ask J.J. Hardy, who was robbed of a
home run that would have cleared the
fence by a good four feet had Trout's
leap not been perfect. Or Gordon
Beckham, who was likewise victimized
by the Trout. Or Miguel Olivo, who had
almost rounded second base when
Trout's glove came back over the wall
with Olivo's blast in the webbing.
Cabrera? He has 13 errors —which
is not all that shabby—but he is ranked
as one of the slowest fielders with one of
the smallest range in the big leagues,
costing his team close to 10 runs over the
course of the season.
For those who smugly note that
Cabrera didn't need those runs, or those
extra wins because his team is sitting in
the playoffs while Trout sits in his par
ents' home (where he still lives), I say for
shame. The Detroit Tigers would have
finished fourth in the AL West, a full four
games behind the Angels, and playing in
one of the weakest divisions (the AL
Central) is nothing to be proud of
In any other year, I'd be the first one to
say that Miggy's accomplishment is awe
some and truly deserving of the MVE But
history is not kind to players that cater
solely to the "Big Three" of statistics.
