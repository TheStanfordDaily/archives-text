# BRING ON THE GOLDEN BEARS
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Every sport's rivalry game with
California has a different edge to it.
From the water polo teams to the field
hockey squad, the Cardinal needs little
reminding to get up for the game against
the Golden Bears.
Tonight's match for the men's soccer
team is no different, as Stanford (4-5,1-1
Pac-12) needs a positive result to build
more momentum in Pac-12 play on the
tail end of a six-game homestand that
ends with the game against Cal (6-3-1,1-
1).

"We've got a lot of confidence and
are definitely looking forward to playing
Cal," said sophomore forward Zach
Batteer. "After that, it's just about mak
ing a good run in the Pac-12."
Stanford is riding high after a tight 2-
0 victory over San Diego State snapped
a three-game losing streak last weekend.
Cal is in a very similar boat an OK
preseason has left them likely needing to
finish second in conference play to earn
a postseason berth.
Like the Cardinal, the Golden Bears
split the series with San Diego State and

UCLA last weekend, knocking off the
Aztecs in overtime and losing to the
Bruins 3-1.
But Cal had been hot before last
weekend with a six-game unbeaten
streak, rebounding nicely from last
year's disastrous season, in which they
slipped to 3-9-5 overall and a dismal 0-7-
3 in Pac-12 play.
Much of that is due to strong play
from midfielders Tony Salciccia and Seth
Casiple who have combined for 21
points together and the play of for
ward Stefano Bonomo up top. Bonomo
has three game-winning goals already
this year, and leads the team in goals
with five.
And Casiple has followed up a nice
freshman campaign with a good sopho
more one, tallying six assists and two
goals on the season.
The Bears' back line is rounding into
form as well, with Christian Dean,
Bobby Sekine, Ryan Neil and Kyle
Marsh allowing just two goals in the six
games prior to the loss against UCLA.
