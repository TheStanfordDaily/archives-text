## Low return on endowment investment 
### RYAN SKORUPSKI 
The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) announced last Thursday that its
merged pool achieved a 1 percent return on
investment during the 12-month period that
ended June 30. Challenges in international
equity markets and economic uncertainty
contributed to a number that is significantly
lower than last year's 22.4 percent return on
investment. Endowment levels have still not
fully recovered from the 2008-2009 econom
ic crisis.
"It was a challenging year due to the state
of the economy," said John Powers, CEO of
the SMC, which is in charge of managing

Stanford's financial assets.
Powers said that one year is too short a
time frame to fairly evaluate a portfolio like
the merged pool, which includes the
University's endowment as well as capital
reserves from Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
According to Powers, a better measurement
of the health of the portfolio is a three-year
rolling return. This number currently stands
at approximately 12 percent. The 2011
report recorded a three-year rolling return
of 1.2 percent, largely due to the 25.9% drop
in 2009.
The University also reported that during
a slightly later 12-month period, which ends

August 31, its endowment grew by 3.2 per
cent to $17.0 billion.
While SMC has a "cautious" outlook on
the economy in the short-run, Powers said he is
extremely confident about the portfolio's long
term strategy and its ability to mitigate risk.
According to Powers, the University's
portfolio has experienced an increase in its
liquidity and flexibility, a point of optimism
moving forward. A large portion of venture
capital, in the portfolio went public this
year, resulting in an increase of cash on
hand.
