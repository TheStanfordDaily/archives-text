## Low return on endowment investment 
### RYAN SKORUPSKI 
The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) announced last Thursday that its
merged pool achieved a 1 percent return on
investment during the 12-month period that
ended June 30. Challenges in international
equity markets and economic uncertainty
contributed to a number that is significantly
lower than last year's 22.4 percent return on
investment. Endowment levels have still not
fully recovered from the 2008-2009 econom
ic crisis.
"It was a challenging year due to the state
of the economy," said John Powers, CEO of
the SMC, which is in charge of managing

Stanford's financial assets.
Powers said that one year is too short a
time frame to fairly evaluate a portfolio like
the merged pool, which includes the
University's endowment as well as capital
reserves from Stanford Hospital & Clinics
and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
According to Powers, a better measurement
of the health of the portfolio is a three-year
rolling return. This number currently stands
at approximately 12 percent. The 2011
report recorded a three-year rolling return
of 1.2 percent, largely due to the 25.9% drop
in 2009.
The University also reported that during
a slightly later 12-month period, which ends

August 31, its endowment grew by 3.2 per
cent to $17.0 billion.
While SMC has a "cautious" outlook on
the economy in the short-run, Powers said he is
extremely confident about the portfolio's long
term strategy and its ability to mitigate risk.
According to Powers, the University's
portfolio has experienced an increase in its
liquidity and flexibility, a point of optimism
moving forward. A large portion of venture
capital, in the portfolio went public this
year, resulting in an increase of cash on
hand.
The merged pool is compromised of six
smaller portfolios, each vary
ing in size, according to
Powers. These smaller portfo
lios are separated by asset
classes and handled by indi
vidual fund managers who
are chosen by the SMC
because of their expertise in the
field. Asset classes include fixed
income, private equity, public
equity, natural resources, real
estate and absolute return

which generally consists of
hedge funds.

Stanford's investment results
are comparable to Yale
University's, which reported a
4.7 percent increase in its
endowment for the fiscal year
ending June 30, bringing its
endowment to $19.3 billion
overall. Harvard's endowment,
on the other hand, shrank by
0.05 percent, putting it at $30.7
billion.

"Thanks to the generosity of
Stanford's donors and disci
plined financial management,
and despite low investment
returns, the endowment had

modest growth last year," said
Randy Livingston, university
vice president for business
affairs and chief financial offi
cer, in a University press release.
"Our endowment is still
smaller than preceding the
2008-2009 financial downturn
and we continue to be con
cerned about the possible
reductions in federal research
funding and an investment
downturn driven by global
economic malaise," Randy
Livingston said.
