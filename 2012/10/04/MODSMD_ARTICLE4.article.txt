percent. Further enrollment increases are expected
in 2014, when the Department of Bioengineering
will open its new facility in the Science and
Engineering Quad, allowing it to fully accommo
date an undergraduate major.
Bioengineering (BioE) is one of the best exam

Engineering. The department was founded in 2002

schools, the School of Engineering and the School
of Medicine. While only open to graduate students
at first, the department finally accepted undergrads
in 2010.
"We are worried that the number of undergrads
considering this major may overwhelm the BioE
department," Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, dean
of the School of Engineering, told The Daily in
2010.
The department may already be feeling the
strain of a rapidly expanding student body. Norbert
Pelc, chair of the Bioengineering Department, said
the number of faculty in his department will
increase "at a fair pace for at least five years, if not
closer to 10" in order to compensate for the
increase of students. He foresees introducing one to
two new faculty members to the department each
