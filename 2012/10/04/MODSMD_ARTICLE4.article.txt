# Increase in faculty size expected
## School of Engineering to hire three to five faculty members annually 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Responding to rapid growth in student enroll
ment, the School of Engineering anticipates mak
ing significant expansions to its faculty size.
According to the University's budget plan for this
academic year, the school plans to hire three to five
new faculty members each year "for the foresee
able future."
In the past two years, the school has gone from
serving 20 percent of the student population to 25
percent. Further enrollment increases are expected
in 2014, when the Department of Bioengineering
will open its new facility in the Science and
Engineering Quad, allowing it to fully accommo
date an undergraduate major.
Bioengineering (BioE) is one of the best exam
ples of the growth in enrollment in the School of
Engineering. The department was founded in 2002
as the first at Stanford to be jointly managed by two
schools, the School of Engineering and the School
of Medicine. While only open to graduate students
at first, the department finally accepted undergrads
in 2010.
"We are worried that the number of undergrads
considering this major may overwhelm the BioE
department," Jim Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l, dean
of the School of Engineering, told The Daily in
2010.
The department may already be feeling the
strain of a rapidly expanding student body. Norbert
Pelc, chair of the Bioengineering Department, said
the number of faculty in his department will
increase "at a fair pace for at least five years, if not
closer to 10" in order to compensate for the
increase of students. He foresees introducing one to
two new faculty members to the department each
year.
"The staffing that we're doing is to grow the
department to be able to han
dle what we think will be a
very popular major," Pelc
said. "You look for truly
outstanding people, and
then you look for people in
areas that are underrepre
sented at Stanford and that
pose or present good oppor
tunities for new scientific
endeavors."
The Department of
Management Science and
Engineering (MS&E) is also
looking to increase its faculty
size over the next year. They
have posted an online adver
tisement for junior faculty
positions, asking for "scholars
who can strengthen our port
folio in computational social
science, operations research
or applications in such areas
as decision making, econom
ics, financial engineering,
operations management, pol
icy and work systems."
The MS&E department is
similar to the Bioengineering
department in that it is rela
tively young, founded only in

1999. Since its foundation, it
has grown to the current size of
130 students. While MS&E has
moved permanently into the
Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering
Center, the Bioengineering
Department currently lacks
enough space to accommo
date more faculty members.
"When the department
was created 10 or so years
ago, we had a vision for how
the department would grow,
but space has always been an
issue," Pelc said. "The last
search that we ran this past
year was on the assumption
that we would be able to find
interim space, and I think
we're 0.K., but it's always
nerve-wracking."

The new BioE/Chemical
Engineering building in the
Science and Engineering Quad
is expected to be completed
and ready for move-in by the
summer of 2014. Until then, the
School of Engineering will con
tinue to struggle with a lack of
space and an increase in
shared facilities.

"The new building sets the
stage for us to be able to con
tinue to grow and mature,"
Pelc said. "It's not exactly the
beginning, but it will certainly
be a transition and an excit

ing one. We're looking for
ward to being able to move in
and have another collection
of faculty all in one place."
While the School of
Engineering is preparing to
increase its faculty size over
the next few years, other
schools at Stanford have
started to plateau, including
some that were growing
quickly in past years. The
School of Humanities and
Sciences, for example, experi
enced a rapid increase of fac
ulty in its Department of
Biology, however it has
stopped hiring in recent
years.

"The department that has
grown most since 1980 is
Biology because of the
expanding research agenda
and student enrollments in
this discipline," wrote Richard
Sailer, dean of the humanities
and sciences, in an email to
The Daily. "Our expectation
about little or no growth for
the next year or two is a
result of the fact that we have
been more successful in fac
ulty hiring over the past two
years than we expected."
