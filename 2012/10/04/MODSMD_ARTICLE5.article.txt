## Flu Crew inoculates students 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Flu Crew, a collabora
tive effort between medical students
from the School of Medicine and under
graduate volunteers, began offering free
flu vaccinations to Stanford students, fac
ulty, staff and employees on Wednesday.
The flu vaccines will be offered until Oct.
10 as part of Power Influenza Week.
Scheduling all vaccination events in
one condensed week is a different
approach from past years. Last year's flu
vaccines were given out in dining halls
every Wednesday over a period of two
months. Rather than this weekly
method, the Flu Crew decided to create
one Power Influenza Week to create a
sense of urgency.
"Last year what we saw was that stu
dents would push off their vaccination
for the next week and eventually forget
to get their flu shot," said Rishi
Mediratta, a second-year medical stu
dent currently leading the Flu Crew
efforts.
Additionally, the Flu Crew has start
ed offering vaccinations much earlier
than in the past. According to the organi
zation's undergraduate leader Magali
Sanchez 'l4, the earlier the vaccines are
offered the better.
"It takes about two weeks for the flu
shot to starting working in your body,
since the body has to first create antibod
ies," she said.
