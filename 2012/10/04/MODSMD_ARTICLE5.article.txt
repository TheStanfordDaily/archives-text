## Flu Crew inoculates students 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Flu Crew, a collabora
tive effort between medical students
from the School of Medicine and under
graduate volunteers, began offering free
flu vaccinations to Stanford students, fac
ulty, staff and employees on Wednesday.
The flu vaccines will be offered until Oct.
10 as part of Power Influenza Week.
Scheduling all vaccination events in
one condensed week is a different
approach from past years. Last year's flu
vaccines were given out in dining halls
every Wednesday over a period of two
months. Rather than this weekly
method, the Flu Crew decided to create
one Power Influenza Week to create a
sense of urgency.
"Last year what we saw was that stu
dents would push off their vaccination
for the next week and eventually forget
to get their flu shot," said Rishi
Mediratta, a second-year medical stu
dent currently leading the Flu Crew
efforts.
Additionally, the Flu Crew has start
ed offering vaccinations much earlier
than in the past. According to the organi
zation's undergraduate leader Magali
Sanchez 'l4, the earlier the vaccines are
offered the better.
"It takes about two weeks for the flu
shot to starting working in your body,
since the body has to first create antibod
ies," she said.
Furthermore, the Flu Crew
has revised the location of cam
pus visits. The vaccines will be
offered twice in Arrillaga Dining
Hall and once in Florence
Moore Dining Hall. In addition,
vaccines will be offered at the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
"We bring flu vaccinations to
[students'] doorsteps, where they
eat, pray, live and work,"
Mediratta said.
Last year, a total of 4,000 vac
cinations were administered. The
Flu Crew this year aims to
increase vaccination numbers by
50 percent, hoping to administer
6,000 vaccinations to Stanford
students and faculty, as well as
uninsured residents in Santa
Clara County.
The Stanford Flu Crew
receives its medical supplies from

the Stanford Occupational
Health Center, Employee Health
Services and the Santa Clara
Public Health Department.
The Crew has evolved since
Walter Newman '74, the group's
clinical faculty advisor, founded
the organization in 2001.
"It started out really small,"
said Rachel Rizal, a second-year
medical student and Flu Crew
co-leader. "Since then it's grown
to vaccinate students and
employees on campus and
we've expanded to vaccinating
in other lower-income commu
nities â€” in churches, women's
shelters. Additionally in the last
year, we've expanded to the
University of California, San
Francisco and the University of
California, Davis."
First-year medical students
administer the vaccines as an
educational experience.
"Our education model is
based on knowledge acquisi
tion and the development of
clinical skills," wrote Flu Crew
Education Coordinator Kelsey

Hill Evans, in an email to The
Daily.
Evans explained students
must complete online video
modules and pass a quiz that
addresses key aspects of each
module before administering
vaccines. In addition, students
must complete two in-person
training sessions.
According to Sanchez, the
Flu Crew has made significant
efforts to encourage the Stanford
community to receive their flu
shots by advertising Power
Influenza week to Resident
Assistants and Peer Health
Educators and by using email
lists. For the first time, the vacci
nation schedule is also available
online and is advertised on
Facebook.
So far, vaccinations have
been offered at the Clark Center,
the GSB and Arrillaga Dining
Hall, and 1,300 people have been
vaccinated.
