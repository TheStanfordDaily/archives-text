## CS106A enrollment reaches record high 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
The second-largest classroom on campus,
Hewlett 200, is no longer large enough to hold
the 700-plus students enrolled in CSIO6A this
quarter. Representatives from the Stanford
University Fire Marshal's Office visited
Wednesday's lecture in the 498-person capacity
room.
CSIO6A, Stanford's computer science depart
ment's introductory course, has experienced a
steady increase in enrollment numbers over the
past five years.
"Back in the 2007-2008 school year, the

enrollment for the class in fall quarter was
around 300 students," said Mehran Sahami B.S.
'92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor of com
puter science and fall CSIO6A instructor. "Then it
went from 300 to 400 to 500 to 650, and this quar
ter we broke 700."

While Cemex Auditorium, which seats 595
people, is larger than Hewlett 200, Sahami prefers
the latter because it "is the biggest classroom that
is really equipped for teaching."
The Registrar's office capped enrollment for
the first time in the course's history this year. The
cap was set at 502 students, but because it was
placed after most students had already enrolled,
there continues to be many students over the

enrollment cap.
The CSIO6A teaching staff had not planned
on videotaping lectures this quarter, but the large
enrollment numbers forced their hands.
"We hope that alleviates the physical pres
ence in the lecture hall enough that the registrar
lifts the enrollment cap," Sahami said.
Filming started on Sept. 28, and Sahami said
that while most aspects of his lectures translate
fairly well to video, the medium does have some
drawbacks.
"I think the opportunity to come to class and
engage and ask questions makes for a more live-

CS106A students gather at the Tresidder LaIR to work on assignments. Over 700 students are enrolled in the class this quarter, the highest
number on record. The class draws students from 40 to 50 different majors, and 10 percent eventually major in computer science.
