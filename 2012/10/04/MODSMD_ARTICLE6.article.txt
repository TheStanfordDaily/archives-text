## CS106A enrollment reaches record high 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
The second-largest classroom on campus,
Hewlett 200, is no longer large enough to hold
the 700-plus students enrolled in CSIO6A this
quarter. Representatives from the Stanford
University Fire Marshal's Office visited
Wednesday's lecture in the 498-person capacity
room.
CSIO6A, Stanford's computer science depart
ment's introductory course, has experienced a
steady increase in enrollment numbers over the
past five years.
"Back in the 2007-2008 school year, the

enrollment for the class in fall quarter was
around 300 students," said Mehran Sahami B.S.
'92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor of com
puter science and fall CSIO6A instructor. "Then it
went from 300 to 400 to 500 to 650, and this quar
ter we broke 700."

While Cemex Auditorium, which seats 595
people, is larger than Hewlett 200, Sahami prefers
the latter because it "is the biggest classroom that
is really equipped for teaching."
The Registrar's office capped enrollment for
the first time in the course's history this year. The
cap was set at 502 students, but because it was
placed after most students had already enrolled,
there continues to be many students over the

enrollment cap.
The CSIO6A teaching staff had not planned
on videotaping lectures this quarter, but the large
enrollment numbers forced their hands.
"We hope that alleviates the physical pres
ence in the lecture hall enough that the registrar
lifts the enrollment cap," Sahami said.
Filming started on Sept. 28, and Sahami said
that while most aspects of his lectures translate
fairly well to video, the medium does have some
drawbacks.
"I think the opportunity to come to class and
engage and ask questions makes for a more live-

CS106A students gather at the Tresidder LaIR to work on assignments. Over 700 students are enrolled in the class this quarter, the highest
number on record. The class draws students from 40 to 50 different majors, and 10 percent eventually major in computer science.
ly experience," Sahami said.
To explain the enormous
popularity of CSIO6A, Keith
Schwarz B.S. 'lO M.S. 11, a lec
turer in computer science who
teaches CSIO6A in the winter,
argues that a number of rea
sons draw large numbers of
students to the class, the most
notable being Stanford's links
to Silicon Valley.
"There are a lot of people
who are coming into comput
er science because they are
looking at the opportunity to
make a lot of money and [are]
saying, this is, financially, a
very reasonable call to make,"
Schwarz said.
In addition to the econom
ic incentive, Schwarz said that
the tools students learn in
CSIO6A can be very empow
ering.

"With computer science,
you can come in and in just a
few weeks, you could be mak
ing something that has never
been made before in the his-

Tory of the world and that is a
very cool idea," Schwarz said.
The applicability of com
puter programming skills to a
variety of fields also draws
students from different aca
demic backgrounds, accord
ing to Sahami.

"The curriculum in the 106
series is made so it is accessi
ble for everyone. You don't
have to be a computer science
major or even an engineer to
take the class," Sahami said.
According to Sahami, an
equal number of students
enrolled in CSIO6A go on to
major in the humanities as go
on to major in computer sci
ence. Of CSIO6A students,
about 10 percent will major in
computer science. Schwarz
estimated that students from
45 to 50 different majors took
his CSIO6A class last winter.
Of students who enter the
class with no computer sci
ence background, some dis
cover their passion for pro
gramming by taking introduc
tory classes like CSIO6A.

"There are a lot of students
who choose to go on in com
puter science or a related fields
as a result of 106A just because

they realize everything they
can do with [a knowledge of
programming]," Sahami said.
Stephanie Nicholson 'l3, a
computer science minor and
section leader for CSIO6A,
said that it was CSIO6A that
sparked her interest in pro
gramming.
"I really liked how you can
build something new and cre
ative ... You actually pro
duce a product that you can
interact with," Nicholson said.
"1 think at Stanford
there's pressure to take at
least one CS class before
graduating," said Raymond
Luong 'l5, who took CSIO6A
in the fall of 2011. "People
also see it as a useful class in
terms of improving their
resume by saying that they
know Java."
Schwarz posed one more
theory as to why CSIO6A is so
popular the educational
programming tool beginner
computer science students use.

The second-largest classroom on campus,
Hewlett 200, is no longer large enough to hold
the 700-plus students enrolled in CSIO6A this
quarter. Representatives from the Stanford
University Fire Marshal's Office visited
Wednesday's lecture in the 498-person capacity
room.
CSIO6A, Stanford's computer science depart
ment's introductory course, has experienced a
steady increase in enrollment numbers over the
past five years.
"Back in the 2007-2008 school year, the

enrollment for the class in fall quarter was
around 300 students," said Mehran Sahami B.S.
'92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor of com
puter science and fall CSIO6A instructor. "Then it
went from 300 to 400 to 500 to 650, and this quar
ter we broke 700."

While Cemex Auditorium, which seats 595
people, is larger than Hewlett 200, Sahami prefers
the latter because it "is the biggest classroom that
is really equipped for teaching."
The Registrar's office capped enrollment for
the first time in the course's history this year. The
cap was set at 502 students, but because it was
placed after most students had already enrolled,
there continues to be many students over the

enrollment cap.
The CSIO6A teaching staff had not planned
on videotaping lectures this quarter, but the large
enrollment numbers forced their hands.
"We hope that alleviates the physical pres
ence in the lecture hall enough that the registrar
lifts the enrollment cap," Sahami said.
Filming started on Sept. 28, and Sahami said
that while most aspects of his lectures translate
fairly well to video, the medium does have some
drawbacks.
"I think the opportunity to come to class and
engage and ask questions makes for a more live-

CS106A students gather at the Tresidder LaIR to work on assignments. Over 700 students are enrolled in the class this quarter, the highest
number on record. The class draws students from 40 to 50 different majors, and 10 percent eventually major in computer science.
ly experience," Sahami said.
To explain the enormous
popularity of CSIO6A, Keith
Schwarz B.S. 'lO M.S. 11, a lec
turer in computer science who
teaches CSIO6A in the winter,
argues that a number of rea
sons draw large numbers of
students to the class, the most
notable being Stanford's links
to Silicon Valley.
"There are a lot of people
who are coming into comput
er science because they are
looking at the opportunity to
make a lot of money and [are]
saying, this is, financially, a
very reasonable call to make,"
Schwarz said.
In addition to the econom
ic incentive, Schwarz said that
the tools students learn in
CSIO6A can be very empow
ering.

"With computer science,
you can come in and in just a
few weeks, you could be mak
ing something that has never
been made before in the his-

Tory of the world and that is a
very cool idea," Schwarz said.
The applicability of com
puter programming skills to a
variety of fields also draws
students from different aca
demic backgrounds, accord
ing to Sahami.

"The curriculum in the 106
series is made so it is accessi
ble for everyone. You don't
have to be a computer science
major or even an engineer to
take the class," Sahami said.
According to Sahami, an
equal number of students
enrolled in CSIO6A go on to
major in the humanities as go
on to major in computer sci
ence. Of CSIO6A students,
about 10 percent will major in
computer science. Schwarz
estimated that students from
45 to 50 different majors took
his CSIO6A class last winter.
Of students who enter the
class with no computer sci
ence background, some dis
cover their passion for pro
gramming by taking introduc
tory classes like CSIO6A.

"There are a lot of students
who choose to go on in com
puter science or a related fields
as a result of 106A just because

they realize everything they
can do with [a knowledge of
programming]," Sahami said.
Stephanie Nicholson 'l3, a
computer science minor and
section leader for CSIO6A,
said that it was CSIO6A that
sparked her interest in pro
gramming.
"I really liked how you can
build something new and cre
ative ... You actually pro
duce a product that you can
interact with," Nicholson said.
