## StartX receives $800,000 to expand, possibly nationwide 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
StartX, a Stanford-based startup accelera
tor and entrepreneur network, received an
$BOO,OOO grant from the Kauffman Foundation
this August to expand. Most of the money will
be allocated to current programming in Palo
Alto, but StartX will also be looking to repli
cate its program in other parts of the country.
The Kauffman Foundation, a Kansas City
based organization that allocates money to
entrepreneurship and education programs
nationwide, has an asset base of $2 billion and
provided $55 million in grants last year. The
foundation's staff visited StartX's Palo Alto
office on a recommendation from a StartX pro
gram mentor, and they came away impressed.
"I think that the team that is working on
StartX right now is tremendous," said Wendy
Torrance, an entrepreneurship director at the
Kauffman Foundation. "They have a lot of
energy, are incredibly smart and have devel
oped a very interesting model for founder edu
cation."
StartX founder Cameron Teitelman 'lO
pointed to specifics in the StartX model that
impressed Kauffman representatives.
"Most [startup accelerators] charge 6 to 10
percent equity of your company," he said, while
StartX currently takes no equity from compa
nies it assists.
"We showed them our methodology, how
we operate, how we educate founders, how we
do it with mostly a team of Stanford students
and the results that we are getting. They were
kind of blown away."
In fall 2011, StartX submitted a grant pro
posal to the Kauffman Foundation asking for
$740,000 in funding. The foundation
announced the approval of the grant, adding an
extra $60,000 for hiring a documentation
employee.

"StartX has developed a terrific founder's
education program," Torrance said. "I see in
them great potential to strengthen that pro
gram and bring their model to other locations
around the country."
Some of the grant will be spent on investi
gating ways to expand StartX nationally,
though Teitelman said that a large portion of
the grant will provide financial support for
companies in StartX's existing program, which
runs three times a year.
"Basically, the point of the grant is to
explore how we want to replicate, whether that
means building programs with other universi
ties or just giving people our material," he said.
"We have some milestones with [Kauffman]
that we have set, but things aren't too strict. It's
more that we figure out how to make our
model have a more expansive impact."
The grant has allowed for more support for
StartX Med, a new division of the company
that focuses on work with medical and biotech
startups. StartX Med founder Divya Nag 'l3
said the program reflects StartX's desire to
offer education and assistance to a wider vari
ety of startups.
"Going forward, StartX wants to establish
itself as a place that can support any type of
entrepreneur," she said.
Sam Purtill 'l3, who went through the
StartX program with his company Class Owl in
the summer of 2011, believes the foundation's
grant will go to a worthwhile program that
helps Stanford entrepreneurs take the next
step.
"Companies that have raised money in
Start X... are being talked about inside ven
ture capital firms, which is really all that mat
ters," he said.
