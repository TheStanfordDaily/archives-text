What do a "Jeopardy!" bidding strategy
expert, the creator of an online Sanskrit guide
and a member of the team that created the first
comprehensive model of a single living cell
have in common? All three are Stanford stu
dents and recipients of the prestigious 2013
Siebel Scholarship.
The Siebel Scholars program was founded
in 2000 to recognize the best and brightest
final-year graduate students from schools in
business, computer science and bioengineering
nationwide.
The scholarship program is a branch of The
Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation estab
lished in 1996 as a non-profit, strategic philan
thropy organization.
Overall this year, 85 scholars were selected
from 17 institutions.
Fifteen Stanford graduate students in their
final year of study were awarded the presti
gious scholarship, with five students each from
the Graduate School of Business, the graduate
program in Computer Science in the School of
Engineering and the graduate program in
Bioengineering in the Schools of Engineering
and Medicine. The same numbers of students
from each department were selected as 2010,
2011 and 2012 Seibel Scholars.
Faculty from the various departments
selected the recipients, using exceptional aca
demic and leadership achievements as their
key criteria.
The recipients from the Graduate School of
Business are: Greg Bybee, Krystal Cowan,
Stewart Lynn, Blake Nesbitt and Peter Shalek.
The recipients from the graduate program in
Computer Science are Jacqueline Chen, Deniz
Kahramaner, Sofia Kyriazopoulou-

Scholars receive a $35,000 grant towards
their final year of study and are integrated into
a network of over 800 highly accomplished

business and scientific leaders.
