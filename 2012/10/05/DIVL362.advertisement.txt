Discover how far your skills can take you by spending a year learning the ins and outs of
medtech innovation - from exploring needs in a hospital setting to selecting just the right need to
discovering dozens of solutions with the potential to help save
lives and improve patient care.
Biodesign Process: A unique systematic approach to needs finding and the invention and
implementation of new biomedical technologies involving clinical immersion, identification and
verification of clinical problems, invention, prototyping, early-stage testing, and project planning.
Solution-Driven: In the past ten years Innovation teams have filed multiple patents, introduced
new technologies into clinical practice, and have developed new companies that have had an
impact on patient care.
