## Arrillaga to participate in Menlo Park development 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Philanthropist John Arrillaga '6O is report
edly working on building concepts for
Stanford-owned lots in Menlo Park.
Arrillaga is "working on some concepts for
these sites that are consistent with the [Menlo
Park] Specific Plan; however, they are not yet
ready for possible application to Menlo Park or
for public release until an application is filed,"
Jean McCown, Stanford director of community
relations, said to Palo Alto Online.
The five lots, previously automobile dealer

ships, run along El Camino Real on the bound
ary of a Menlo Park downtown renovation
project called the Specific Plan.
Though city sources confirmed the philan
thropist's interest in the future of the lots, fur
ther details have not been revealed.
"It is my understanding that this project will
continue to be refined," Menlo Park Mayor
Kirsten Keith told Palo Alto Online. "It would
be premature for me to comment on it at this
time."
Arrillaga has a history of development proj
ects in Menlo Park, including a $l5 million dol
lar donation the past four years for construc
tion of a new gymnasium, gymnastics center
and renovated recreation center.
