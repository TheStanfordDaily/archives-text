## New platform to offer two online open courses this fall 
### ELISE JOHNSON 
Class2Go, a new massive open
online course (MOOC) platform
developed by a Stanford team, is join
ing the more established Coursera
and Udacity platforms to offer a total
of 16 courses this fall.
Jane Manning and Sef Kloninger
'93, staff members in the new Office
of the Vice Provost for Online

Learning (VPOL), and a team of six
engineers from Stanford's Computer
Science Department began working
on Class2Go in July and built the plat
form in 11 weeks.
The team developed the Class2Go
model when they noticed that stu
dents wanted to download course
videos, rather than stream them
online.
"At first, we just wanted to make it

easy to download the videos,"
Manning said. "Then we started to
think about how we could develop a
platform where we could learn about
learning,"
The result was a Stanford platform
that is open-source, portable and
interoperable. By designing Class2Go
for both teaching and research, the
team hopes to leverage data to
improve the efficacy of the online and

offline lessons.
Class2Go's early dedication to
open-source is perhaps its biggest dif
ferentiator from other platforms. It is
free of cost, and collaborators are also
welcome to contribute to Class2Go's
code.
"Any gatekeeper to the features
set is... a problem for learning. We
want to be open now so that others
can contribute and help," Manning

said.
As a result, Class2Go has already
attracted over half a dozen collabora
tors, ranging from community col
leges to overseas learning programs
for middle school students.
"If someone wants to make a
clone of our platform, run it at their
own university and build some crazy
