## New platform to offer two online open courses this fall 
### ELISE JOHNSON 
Class2Go, a new massive open
online course (MOOC) platform
developed by a Stanford team, is join
ing the more established Coursera
and Udacity platforms to offer a total
of 16 courses this fall.
Jane Manning and Sef Kloninger
'93, staff members in the new Office
of the Vice Provost for Online

Learning (VPOL), and a team of six
engineers from Stanford's Computer
Science Department began working
on Class2Go in July and built the plat
form in 11 weeks.
The team developed the Class2Go
model when they noticed that stu
dents wanted to download course
videos, rather than stream them
online.
"At first, we just wanted to make it

easy to download the videos,"
Manning said. "Then we started to
think about how we could develop a
platform where we could learn about
learning,"
The result was a Stanford platform
that is open-source, portable and
interoperable. By designing Class2Go
for both teaching and research, the
team hopes to leverage data to
improve the efficacy of the online and

offline lessons.
Class2Go's early dedication to
open-source is perhaps its biggest dif
ferentiator from other platforms. It is
free of cost, and collaborators are also
welcome to contribute to Class2Go's
code.
"Any gatekeeper to the features
set is... a problem for learning. We
want to be open now so that others
can contribute and help," Manning

said.
As a result, Class2Go has already
attracted over half a dozen collabora
tors, ranging from community col
leges to overseas learning programs
for middle school students.
"If someone wants to make a
clone of our platform, run it at their
own university and build some crazy
features that they never would be
able to convince us to build, we all
benefit," Kloninger said.
Portability means that Class2Go
does not capture materials in a pro
prietary database. Its videos are avail
able outside of its system on
You Tube, and its quizzes are Khan
Academy exercises.
"Our goal was to create an easy
way for people to have online cours
es and to run them on our platform
for now," Kloninger said. "Eventually,
if there is another platform that
makes more sense for their materials,
the switch will be just as easy."
In this way, the platform is also
interoperable —it relies heavily on
other services to run. In addition to
Khan Academy and You Tube,
Class2Go incorporates Piazza,
Python Django, Amazon AWS,
Opscode and Github.

Class2Go will go live on Oct. 8,
offering two classes: An Introduction
to Computer Networks, taught by
Nick McKeown and Philip Levis; and
Solar Cells, Fuel Cells, & Batteries,
taught by Bruce Clemens M.S. '7l.
"We'll learn from [the classes]
and make it better for the next quar
ter, and then do it again. That's the
way to innovate," Kloninger said.
"Do what your customers want over
and over again."

The Class2Go team is already
talking to professors about rolling out
new features for the winter quarter.
For McKeown, designing an
online class provides an opportunity
to improve his own pedagogy.
"The majority of the world does
n't get access to material like this. For
sure, it's a lot of work, but it's very
exciting to take part in this big exper
iment," McKeown said. "We are
exploring how to provide a great
online learning experience to tens of
thousands of students at a time."
