## SEEING GREEN The 						hundred-year promise 
### Holly Moeller 
I don't remember who saw the giant
spike of asparagus first, but Zach
and I both made a beeline through
the Stanford cactus garden for it.
Of course, it wasn't actually an enor
mous asparagus, but rather the emerg
ing flowering stalk of a century plant, an
agave said to live 100 years before
blooming. Though "century" is an exag
geration, it takes decades of slow
growth before the plant produces a cen
tral stalk several meters high, explodes
in a burst of floral scents, sets seed and
dies. The agave has learned to save its
pennies in an uncertain desert envi
ronment, because some things are
worth the wait.
Such long-term planning has little
place in our own lives, which some
times seem ruled by the instant feed
back of Facebook, iPhones and
You Tube. Even our nation's policies
are tightly coupled to election cycles,
every move carefully timed for politi
cal impact. No doubt we'll see plenty
of verbal scrambling in the next few
weeks, as the presidential candidates
vie for votes. And with economic and
social welfare concerns dominating
the agenda, we're more likely to hear
plans for natural resource exploitation
than conservation.
We rarely pause to ask ourselves
what we are willing to invest for the
long haul. Yet in this time of resource
exhaustion, species extinction and cli
mate change, those investments are
critical. They protect our future, as
individuals and as a species. And when
we put something aside indefinitely
not to harvest at the end of our lives,
or even at the end of our children's
lives we also protect our humanity.
There's something empowering about
simply letting things be, about protect
ing things because we can, because we
choose to.
In this country, we have a long his
tory of doing just that: It's been almost
100 years since the National Park
Service was founded, decades after
the establishment of Yellowstone, the
first national park. Admittedly, many
of our protected areas are located on
mountaintops or amid deserts
hard-to-reach areas that seemed eco
nomically useless at the time of their
establishment.
With present-day technology,
we're now able to mine places we've
never mined, to drill places we've

never drilled and some loosely pro
tected areas are coming under threat.
Yet at the same time, many of us have
deeply internalized the long-term pro
tection commitment inherent in the
conservation concept.
Each of us has our own reasons:
natural beauty, moral obligation,
childhood memories. For me, the most
important factor runs deep within my
soul, something primal I didn't recog
nize until I was 20 years old, standing
on a glacier, distracted from my work
measuring the effects of climate
change by the breathtaking scenery
surrounding me. I couldn't even artic
ulate it until one day, three months
after moving to Boston and fully
immersing myself in city life, I burst
into the graduate student lounge,
looked my friend Jen in the eye, and
gasped, "I need to go far away and just
be outside." That was when I realized:
I simply need wilderness to survive.
Much has been said and written
about humanity's need for nature.
We've even come up with a catch
phrase "nature deficit disorder"
for an array of behavioral problems
linked to a lack of contact with the
outdoors. Unfortunately, the less con
tact we have, and the more we raise
our children in hermetically sealed,
electronically equipped rooms instead
of nature's classroom, the less we'll
recognize exactly what it is that we're

missmg.
Of course, who can really pinpoint
what exactly wild places do for our
souls? Is it that they provide fresh,
clean, breathable air? Or adorable
baby animal videos that we can watch
on TV or, especially, You Tube? For
me, it's the gift of being someplace
totally overwhelming, of recognizing
forces beyond myself in motion, of
knowing that outside of me and my
inner turmoil or inner joy, the world
goes on. And while I can temporarily
recover that feeling by taking a day
trip to the coast or watching kites
hunting on the Dish, I'm especially
grateful for permanent reservoirs of
true wilderness. May they exist a hun
dred, a thousand, years into our future.
Meanwhile, the flowering agave
continues to bolt for reproductive
freedom. "It's one of the fastest-grow
ing plants on the planet at this stage,"
said Zach as we measured its stalk
against our own height. We returned
on several subsequent days, always
marking four inches of growth
overnight, until the stalk rose far
above our heads and eyeball esti
mates. Its presence had become, sim
ply, overwhelming.

That was when
I realized that I
need wilderness
to survive.
