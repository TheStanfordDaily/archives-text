# Notes from the Dead
## 
### Alex Bayer 
We picked our way through
the lawn; the show had
already started and a silver
haired Phil Lesh was jamming on the
big screen. We were at a Furthur con
cert. It's the band the remaining mem
bers of Grateful Dead formed after
Jerry Garcia died in 1995.
Incense hung in the air; no use in
finding the source. Momentarily, the
crowd was cast in the golden glare of a
spotlight, then just as quickly fell back
into darkness. A scarlet light came and
went, and so on, like an undulating
wave. We nailed a spot in the center,
swayed to the music. I, naive
Deadhead, had no clue what I was
doing. The tempo was mellow, and I
thought the song sounded like a
lament, but the 50-year-old man in
front of me was dancing rapturous
ly. I looked behind: Sure, some peo
ple were mellowing out like me, but
the true baby boomer Deadheads
were shaking their hips like there
was no tomorrow. I swayed a bit more
tepidly.
Dang, I thought; here I was
poser, total foreigner. Narc status. I
can't recite the full Grateful Dead
catalogue, but even worse, whatever
drug that was laced in this music, my
body just didn't respond to. Sure,
there were the new-age folk swaying
their arms, but what vibes were these
crazy happy campers riding? And
then, one look at the dancing couple
in front of me and it hit me how
many memories are enmeshed in

these songs. Did they meet at a Dead
concert 30 years ago? Did they first
kiss as Jerry Garcia played? Maybe
he courted her by inviting her to
shows; maybe they cooked dinner
one night to "Looks Like Rain."
How can I possibly emulate these
dancers, steeped in the joy of many
memories? Some say the band's
name was conceived when Garcia
was taking DMT, a dream-inducing
drug that contains the chemical that
gets released when you're dying
the one that causes you to flash over
the events of your life. Grateful
Dead, too, is like an aphrodisiac for
memories, and a good memory
you know, the kind where you can
smell not just what's on your plate,
but the scent of the very table in your
childhood home I bet people
would pay more for that than a
black-market drug.
There was a rusty blue bus in the
dusty parking lot with about three
dozen bikes tied to the top and an
inside full of hammocks. I wondered
who rode in it. Was it a pack of baby
boomers? Or was it those dread
locked 20-something hippies? Did it
matter, really? Both were in the
business of memories: the baby
boomers, in remembering them, the
young, in creating them. The cycle
continues. And as long as it does, the
Dead live on.
