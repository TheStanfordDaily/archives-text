## OLYMPIC SPECIAL: PART TWO LONDON'S FINEST THE 						DAILY CHATS WITH SEVEN OF STANFORD'S OLYMPIANS 
### 
SThis is the second part of a two-part
series on Stanford student-athletes in
London. Today, the seven current
Stanford students who competed at this
summer's London 2012 Olympic and
Paralympic Games discuss life in the Olympic
Village, reflect on their achievements and talk
about their future plans. Join us to talk to U.S.
women's water polo teammates and London 2012
gold medalists senior Melissa Seidemann, junior
Annika Dries and freshman Maggie Steffens; U.S.
synchronized swimmer senior Mariya Koroleva;
Australian 400-meter sprinter freshman Steven
Solomon; Canadian gymnast sophomore Krishna
Vaculik; and U.S. Paralympian double-silver and
double-bronze medalist senior Roy Perkins.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was life like in
the Olympic Village?
"Our coach made sure that we had no distrac
tions," Koroleva said. "[Organizers] were trying to
get us to do some media stuff, go out of the village
for things, and we were just not allowed to do any

of that. It was very focused, very intense.
Afterwards it just felt so good. It was like a weight
lifted off your chest, and you're done, you just com
peted at the Games, and from then it was just
exploring the village and people having fun."
"I did meet one of Russia's greatest basketball
players, and I didn't know who he was at the time
until I went back to the room and Googled his
name. That was pretty cool."
"I'm lucky that I've been to world champi
onship villages before, so I knew how to control
myself in the dining hall," Solomon said, "which is
a big thing. A lot of people see endless amounts of
any food that you can possibly imagine, and the
best-tasting pizza that you've ever had in your life
is just sitting there every day for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. The dining hall at the Olympic Village
was about a 100 times the size of Arrillaga. It was
like the size of an airplane hanger, and there was
just endless amounts of food, 24 hours a day, every
day, which was really cool. Really, really cool, espe
cially when you're finished."
"For me, I tried to fit everything in, the village
life, hanging out with other athletes," Seidemann

said. "I also spent some time on the Tube and in the
mall and visiting my family. For me it was impor
tant to make sure I included the whole experience,
not just the Olympic Games, into it, so that part was
cool too, that we had off-days and opportunities to
experience other things while we were there."
TSD: It's always difficult to rate your own per
formances fairly, but how do you think the compe
tition went?
"As a team we expected to make top eight,"
Vaculik said, "and this hadn't been done before by
the Canadian gymnastics team, the women specifi
cally. So that was our goal and we actually placed
seventh during the qualification round, and that
was a huge surprise for us. In the team finals we
came fifth, which was a huge step up and totally
unexpected, so we were all really happy with that,
and it was amazing."
"It was great; it was my second Paralympics,"
Perkins said. "I swam in Beijing as well, so the

experience was kinda similar,
but my performance was bet
ter this time, so it was a better
experience in some ways."
TSD: The Stanford Daily:
Did you get a chance to soak
up the excitement of the
Games amidst all of your indi
vidual preparations?
"We didn't get to go to the
opening ceremony because it
was two days before the com
petition," Vaculik said, "but I
watched it on TV and it was still
really exciting. The closing cere
monies were awesome. It was
just spectacular; great artists
came and performed and the
energy there was amazing even
though it symbolized the clos
ing of the Olympics."
"Working toward the
Olympics I really just looked at
each day as another step
toward it," Vaculik said. "It is
the Olympics, and that was
what I had been working for

my entire life, so I wanted to
make the most of each
moment and take it all in, and
that's what I did there. Even
when I walked into the stadi
um I took time to look around,
take in the atmosphere. It was
just incredible, something I
hadn't experienced at any
other competition. It really was
a once in a lifetime thing."
"At the opening ceremony
was the first time that I really
felt that we're here on the world
stage," Dries said. "You're walk
ing out, there's 60,000 people,
there's lights everywhere. I
almost got lost from the group
because I was so excited in the
moment of it. Just this moment
when you're like, 'Wow this is
the real deal.' In water polo we
don't have as many opportuni
ties [like] this. Every four years
it's really special."
TSD: What about the
future? What lies ahead for
you guys?
"The experience gives me a
little bit of confidence going
into this next season," Vaculik
said, "but it was sort of some
thing separate for me. That was
a separate goal other than my

collegiate goals. That was the
endpoint to my international
career, and now I can fully
come back and solely focus on
my collegiate gymnastics and
giving my all to the team. I
think that'll be a really good
step in the right direction for
me, with Stanford."
"I will be 24 if I decide to go
to Rio [2016]," Vaculik said.
"I'm not sure for now; it's real
ly hard for me to say if that is a
possibility or not, so as of now
I'm focusing on my academics
and I want to get my degree."
"I've got short- and long
term goals," Solomon said, "but
one can look at it that my time
at Stanford is the four-year
cycle between now and Rio, so
pretty much my preparation for
the Rio Olympics will be done
on campus at Stanford. That's
something that myself and the
coaches are really aware ot and
we're really looking down to
strategically planning where I
want to be in different stages of
that four-year cycle. I'm really
confident that being here at
Stanford's going to give me the
best opportunity to do as well
as I can."
