						DAILY CHATS WITH SEVEN OF STANFORD'S OLYMPIANS 
### 
SThis is the second part of a two-part
series on Stanford student-athletes in
London. Today, the seven current
Stanford students who competed at this
summer's London 2012 Olympic and
Paralympic Games discuss life in the Olympic
Village, reflect on their achievements and talk
about their future plans. Join us to talk to U.S.
women's water polo teammates and London 2012
gold medalists senior Melissa Seidemann, junior
Annika Dries and freshman Maggie Steffens; U.S.
synchronized swimmer senior Mariya Koroleva;
Australian 400-meter sprinter freshman Steven
Solomon; Canadian gymnast sophomore Krishna
Vaculik; and U.S. Paralympian double-silver and
double-bronze medalist senior Roy Perkins.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was life like in
the Olympic Village?
"Our coach made sure that we had no distrac
tions," Koroleva said. "[Organizers] were trying to
get us to do some media stuff, go out of the village
for things, and we were just not allowed to do any

of that. It was very focused, very intense.
Afterwards it just felt so good. It was like a weight
lifted off your chest, and you're done, you just com
peted at the Games, and from then it was just
exploring the village and people having fun."
"I did meet one of Russia's greatest basketball
players, and I didn't know who he was at the time
until I went back to the room and Googled his
name. That was pretty cool."
"I'm lucky that I've been to world champi
onship villages before, so I knew how to control
myself in the dining hall," Solomon said, "which is
a big thing. A lot of people see endless amounts of
any food that you can possibly imagine, and the
best-tasting pizza that you've ever had in your life
is just sitting there every day for breakfast, lunch
and dinner. The dining hall at the Olympic Village
was about a 100 times the size of Arrillaga. It was
like the size of an airplane hanger, and there was
just endless amounts of food, 24 hours a day, every
day, which was really cool. Really, really cool, espe
cially when you're finished."
"For me, I tried to fit everything in, the village
life, hanging out with other athletes," Seidemann

said. "I also spent some time on the Tube and in the
mall and visiting my family. For me it was impor
tant to make sure I included the whole experience,
not just the Olympic Games, into it, so that part was
cool too, that we had off-days and opportunities to
experience other things while we were there."
TSD: It's always difficult to rate your own per
formances fairly, but how do you think the compe
tition went?
"As a team we expected to make top eight,"
Vaculik said, "and this hadn't been done before by
the Canadian gymnastics team, the women specifi
cally. So that was our goal and we actually placed
seventh during the qualification round, and that
was a huge surprise for us. In the team finals we
came fifth, which was a huge step up and totally
unexpected, so we were all really happy with that,
and it was amazing."
"It was great; it was my second Paralympics,"
Perkins said. "I swam in Beijing as well, so the
