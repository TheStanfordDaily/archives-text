## Stanford readies for No. 1 Trojans 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
USC's water polo team comes barreling into
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center this Saturday
with as much momentum as one could imagine.
The four-time defending NCAA champions are
14-0 on the season, which includes two first-place
finishes at major early season tournaments, all
while outscoring their opponents 203-63.
On top of that, No. 1 USC has beaten No. 5
Stanford (6-2) in each of their previous three
meetings. The most recent instance came three
weekends ago at Stanford's home pool in the
semifinals of the NorCal Invitational.

Even with those lopsided statistics, Stanford is
bringing a sense of confidence into the match-up,
which will be their first Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation game of the year.
"We're feeling very prepared and focused,"
said redshirt junior goalie Scott Platshon, also not

of their early season loss to USC.
The Cardinal lost that game in overtime by a
score of 10-9 after leading for the majority of the
contest. Stanford's outside shooters proved that
they could score against USC's staunch defense,
and the Cardinal defense has had a chance to learn
from the errors they made in the loss.
"[We] spent a lot of time reviewing the game

tape from our first game against them, and [we]
are working hard to correct a few mistakes we
made," Platshon said. But Stanford can
not necessarily expect to see the same Trojan team
that they played earlier this season. Most notably,
Stanford may get their first test against the
MPSF's top goalie, junior James Clark, who is
leading the conference in goals against per game.
In their last meeting, USC instead started sopho
more goalie Ely Bonilla the conference's sec
ond-leading goalie in goals against per game.
Behind a combination of those two, USC has
allowed only 4.5 goals per game as a team, tops in
