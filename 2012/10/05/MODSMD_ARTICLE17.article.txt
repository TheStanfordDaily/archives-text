# WATER POLO
## Stanford readies for No. 1 Trojans 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
USC's water polo team comes barreling into
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center this Saturday
with as much momentum as one could imagine.
The four-time defending NCAA champions are
14-0 on the season, which includes two first-place
finishes at major early season tournaments, all
while outscoring their opponents 203-63.
On top of that, No. 1 USC has beaten No. 5
Stanford (6-2) in each of their previous three
meetings. The most recent instance came three
weekends ago at Stanford's home pool in the
semifinals of the NorCal Invitational.

Even with those lopsided statistics, Stanford is
bringing a sense of confidence into the match-up,
which will be their first Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation game of the year.
"We're feeling very prepared and focused,"
said redshirt junior goalie Scott Platshon, also not
ing that the team can still take a lot of positives out
of their early season loss to USC.
The Cardinal lost that game in overtime by a
score of 10-9 after leading for the majority of the
contest. Stanford's outside shooters proved that
they could score against USC's staunch defense,
and the Cardinal defense has had a chance to learn
from the errors they made in the loss.
"[We] spent a lot of time reviewing the game

tape from our first game against them, and [we]
are working hard to correct a few mistakes we
made," Platshon said. But Stanford can
not necessarily expect to see the same Trojan team
that they played earlier this season. Most notably,
Stanford may get their first test against the
MPSF's top goalie, junior James Clark, who is
leading the conference in goals against per game.
In their last meeting, USC instead started sopho
more goalie Ely Bonilla the conference's sec
ond-leading goalie in goals against per game.
Behind a combination of those two, USC has
allowed only 4.5 goals per game as a team, tops in
the conference. In addition,
USC is second in the confer
ence with 14.5 goals scored per
game.
Stanford, on the other
hand, does not have such lofty
statistics. The Cardinal is
fourth in goals against per
game at 7.13, and seventh in
goals per game with 11.13.
With that said, Stanford
goes into conference play with
only eight games under its
belt, the fewest of any MPSF
team. That means the Cardinal
has not had many tune-up
games against weaker oppo
nents, which usually help bol
ster overall statistics.
Asked if that will have any

effect on future play, Platshon
said, "No, I don't think so. We
worked hard all summer
together."
He also pointed out that
true freshman driver Bret
Bonanni the team's second
leading scorer and utility
B.J. Churnside have fit into the
team very well, even without
the added games. Churnside
netted two goals, and Bonanni
one, in the loss to USC earlier
this season.
Stanford's eight games
have all come in two weekend
tournaments. They placed
third in the NorCal
Invitational and fifth at the
SoCal Tournament. The
Cardinal went 3-1 in both, but
a loss to UC-Santa Barbara
took them out of the winners'
bracket at the SoCal
Tournament. After that loss
Stanford rattled off wins

against Pepperdine and Pacific
in the second day of the tour
nament. Those wins were not
enough to stop them from slid
ing in the national polls
though, and Stanford dropped
to fifth in the nation the
lowest it has been ranked this
year.
This Saturday's game
against USC will be played at
Stanford at 9 a.m., a start time
that is much earlier than usual.
Stanford prepared this week
with early morning practices
every day, but Platshon does
not see the start time having
any effect on the outcome.
"I don't expect the start
time to make any difference.
It's such a huge game both
teams are going to be fired
up," he said.
