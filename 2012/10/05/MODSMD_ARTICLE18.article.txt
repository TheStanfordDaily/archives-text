# Batteer's brace topples rival Bears
## CARD RISING IN TOUGH PAC-12 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Facing the daunting prospect of being
1-2 to start Pac-12 play, the men's soccer
team stepped up in a big way, delivering a
strong message with a 2-0 win over rival
California on Thursday night.

Sophomore Zach Batteer continued
his hot streak for the Cardinal (5-5, 2-1
Pac-12), scoring both goals to make it
three total in the last week for the forward
from Pittsburgh, Penn.
Batteer's first strike of the night came
at the death of the first half, as junior Tyler
Conklin found senior Dersu Abolfathi on
a nice run down the line. Abolfathi swung
the ball in with his left foot and Batteer
managed to head the ball past Cal's keep
er while falling away from goal there
were just 18 seconds remaining on the

clock.
"Coach always tells us to work all 45
minutes," Batteer said. "I felt we could put
one in those last couple of minutes, and
Dersu put a great ball in and I just man
aged to get a head to it. It was a great
spark for the team going into the half."
It was the release that an energetic
crowd of 1,253 had been searching for,
and they erupted as Batteer slid headlong
toward the sideline in his celebration.
In the early going, however, Cal (6-4-1,
1-2) seemed to be getting the most dan
gerous chances. Stanford maintained pos
session a good amount earning six cor
ner kicks and pestered Golden Bear
goalie Kevin Peach into making three
saves. But if not for some clutch work
from junior goalie Drew Hutchins, the
Cardinal would have been on the wrong
side of the score.
Hutchins made five saves in the half,
including a one-on-one opportunity that
he parried out wide and a sprawling save
to knock away a ball destined for the left
corner of the net.
Head coach Jeremy Gunn appreciated
the effort.
"Drew was busy back there tonight
and he definitely earned the shutout,"

Sophomore forward Zach Batteer (above) netted a pair of
goals as Stanford improved to 2-1 in conference play with
a 2-0 win over rival California on Thursday night.
Gunn said.
While Batteer's goal took
the wind out of the Bears'
sails, Stanford came out of the
half and seemed a little tenta
tive playing with the 1-0 lead.
Cal continued to press as it
looked for the equalizer, and
the roles reversed, as Stanford
was now the team slightly on
its heels in defense and con
tent to counterattack on
offense.
Conklin nearly put Cal
away with a driving ball from
30 yards out that went wide,
but it didn't happen until the
78th minute, when redshirt

sophomore Bobby Edwards'
cross off the counter found
Batteer in the middle for
another header and the final
score of the game.
"We opened up and [Eric]
Verso made a great near-post
run, the same thing we actual
ly practice all the time, and I
found some space on the back
and buried it low and to the
near post," Batteer said.
Cal pressed even higher
after the goal, and Stanford's
defense needed a couple of
diving stops from Hutchins
and some physical defensive
work from senior captain
Hunter Gorskie to preserve
the shutout.
With the win, Stanford
returned to .500 on the season
and took another important
step toward a postseason

berth by moving up to second
place in the Pac-12.
"It was a great result for
the team tonight," Gunn said.
"Both teams had really great
chances and it was exciting
end-to-end soccer. They
passed a little better than we
did in the first half, and that
has not happened to us much
this year. The goal just before
half helped us, and then we
played much better in the sec
ond half."
With the rest of the week
end off, Stanford returns to
action next week as it heads
to the Pacific Northwest for
matches with Oregon State
and Washington.

goalie Kevin Peach into making three
saves. But if not for some clutch work
from junior goalie Drew Hutchins, the
Cardinal would have been on the wrong
side of the score.
Hutchins made five saves in the half,
including a one-on-one opportunity that
he parried out wide and a sprawling save
to knock away a ball destined for the left
corner of the net.
Head coach Jeremy Gunn appreciated
the effort.
"Drew was busy back there tonight
and he definitely earned the shutout,"

Sophomore forward Zach Batteer (above) netted a pair of
goals as Stanford improved to 2-1 in conference play with
a 2-0 win over rival California on Thursday night.
Gunn said.
While Batteer's goal took
the wind out of the Bears'
sails, Stanford came out of the
half and seemed a little tenta
tive playing with the 1-0 lead.
Cal continued to press as it
looked for the equalizer, and
the roles reversed, as Stanford
was now the team slightly on
its heels in defense and con
tent to counterattack on
offense.
Conklin nearly put Cal
away with a driving ball from
30 yards out that went wide,
but it didn't happen until the
78th minute, when redshirt

sophomore Bobby Edwards'
cross off the counter found
Batteer in the middle for
another header and the final
score of the game.
"We opened up and [Eric]
Verso made a great near-post
run, the same thing we actual
ly practice all the time, and I
found some space on the back
and buried it low and to the
near post," Batteer said.
Cal pressed even higher
after the goal, and Stanford's
defense needed a couple of
diving stops from Hutchins
and some physical defensive
work from senior captain
Hunter Gorskie to preserve
the shutout.
With the win, Stanford
returned to .500 on the season
and took another important
step toward a postseason

berth by moving up to second
place in the Pac-12.
"It was a great result for
the team tonight," Gunn said.
"Both teams had really great
chances and it was exciting
end-to-end soccer. They
passed a little better than we
did in the first half, and that
has not happened to us much
this year. The goal just before
half helped us, and then we
played much better in the sec
ond half."
With the rest of the week
end off, Stanford returns to
action next week as it heads
to the Pacific Northwest for
matches with Oregon State
and Washington.
