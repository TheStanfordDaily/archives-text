# Batteer's brace topples rival Bears
## CARD RISING IN TOUGH PAC-12 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Facing the daunting prospect of being
1-2 to start Pac-12 play, the men's soccer
team stepped up in a big way, delivering a
strong message with a 2-0 win over rival
California on Thursday night.

Sophomore Zach Batteer continued
his hot streak for the Cardinal (5-5, 2-1
Pac-12), scoring both goals to make it
three total in the last week for the forward
from Pittsburgh, Penn.
Batteer's first strike of the night came
at the death of the first half, as junior Tyler
Conklin found senior Dersu Abolfathi on
a nice run down the line. Abolfathi swung
the ball in with his left foot and Batteer
managed to head the ball past Cal's keep
er while falling away from goal there
were just 18 seconds remaining on the

clock.
"Coach always tells us to work all 45
minutes," Batteer said. "I felt we could put
one in those last couple of minutes, and
Dersu put a great ball in and I just man
aged to get a head to it. It was a great
spark for the team going into the half."
It was the release that an energetic
crowd of 1,253 had been searching for,
and they erupted as Batteer slid headlong
toward the sideline in his celebration.
In the early going, however, Cal (6-4-1,
1-2) seemed to be getting the most dan
gerous chances. Stanford maintained pos
session a good amount earning six cor
ner kicks and pestered Golden Bear
goalie Kevin Peach into making three
saves. But if not for some clutch work
from junior goalie Drew Hutchins, the
Cardinal would have been on the wrong
side of the score.
Hutchins made five saves in the half,
including a one-on-one opportunity that
he parried out wide and a sprawling save
to knock away a ball destined for the left
corner of the net.
Head coach Jeremy Gunn appreciated
the effort.
"Drew was busy back there tonight
and he definitely earned the shutout,"
