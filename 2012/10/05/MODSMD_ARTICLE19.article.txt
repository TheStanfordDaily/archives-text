# How will Stanford respond?
## 
### Sam Fisher 
The unblemished record is
gone after a tough loss at
Washington, but now
Stanford returns home to
the friendly confines of
Stanford Stadium. The question last
week was how the Cardinal would
respond to its first road challenge, and
the answer was anything but satisfac
torily.
It's a completely different question
this week: How will Stanford bounce
back from its first loss of the season? I
do not have the answer right now. In
fact, this preview is going to be a bit
different than usual. After seeing
Stanford beat itself up in Seattle, I'm
going to focus on the key improve
ments the Card will have to make to
beat Arizona, rather than touch on the
usual positional matchups.
It all starts with the offense, which
was brutally unproductive at
Washington. Coach Shaw commented
that Stanford only had three produc
tive drives where the team moved the
ball. That just won't cut it in the Pac
-12, especially against a team with the
offensive firepower of Arizona. Not
only will Stanford need to score more
than six points on offense to win the
game, but the offense has to have sus
tained drives to give the defense a
chance to rest.
Arizona, under first-year head
coach Rich Rodriguez, will run a fast
paced offense. In every game this sea
son, Stanford's opponents have uti
lized the no-huddle to try to wear
Stanford's defense down. The defense
only looked tired late in the
Washington game, and the lack of rest
on the sideline certainly was a large
factor.
Stanford struggled in pretty much
all aspects of the offensive game, but it
all points back to the quarterback.
Josh Nunes did not have a good game
in Seattle, and no one is trying to hide
that. Coach Shaw has made it clear
that Nunes is Stanford's quarterback
to stay, so I won't talk about alterna
tives at the position. For Stanford's
offense to succeed and win consistent
ly, Josh Nunes has to play better. He
doesn't have to play a lot better, but
there are a few places he has to
improve dramatically for Stanford to
have any chance of salvaging its sea
son.
Josh Nunes has to complete his
short passes. When a screen pass is
well blocked, Nunes cannot ever miss
his back (see Ryan Hewitt vs.
Washington). When Zach Ertz or
Levine Toilolo is open on a slant,
Nunes has to hit him at a very high
percentage.
Why is this so important? Stanford
threw the ball 12 times on second
down against Washington. Six of these
went for positive yards, five were
incomplete, and one went for a four
yard loss. The positive plays resulted in
three first downs, a manageable
fourth-down attempt, which was inter
cepted, and two punts. The negative
plays resulted in four punts, one
turnover and only one first down.
Neither set was particularly
impressive, but Stanford was three
times more likely to pick up a first
down after a positive completion on
second down versus an incompletion
or negative play. With Stanford's
offensive struggles and stingy defense,
every first down could be the key to
victory.
Defensively, there's really only one
thing to focus on improving. Stanford
has to limit the opposition's big plays.
Stanford's defense has been extraor
dinary all season long, showing that it
is one of the best, if not the best, in the
entire country. However, the unit has
been plagued by big plays at times,
including a 61-yard touchdown run
that allowed Washington back in the
game.
This week, Arizona brings a fast
paced offense with a lot of speed on
the outside. I don't think the Wildcats
are good enough to have sustained
success against Stanford's dominant
defense. However, Arizona certainly
has the athleticism to turn a broken
tackle into a long touchdown, some
thing Stanford fans are all too familiar
with seeing.
Everyone on the field needs to be
involved in stopping these big plays.
The defensive line needs to generate
pressure and stop the run as well as
possible by itself, freeing up the
other eight guys on the field to
focus more on the outside game.
Then, Stanford's linebackers need to
fly across the field on short passes to
the perimeter to provide help to
Stanford's secondary.
Lastly, that Stanford secondary
needs to play smart football after the
catch. When Terrence Brown or Barry
Browning sees Shayne Skov running
