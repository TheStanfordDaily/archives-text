£ "▼"ever get too high, never
I get too low" has been the
I I mantra for the Cardinal all
\l season. Unfortunately, it's
.A. the latter part of that

phrase that the players have found themselves
focusing on this past week.
On the heels of a frustrating 17-13 defeat
to Washington last Thursday, No. 18 Stanford
(3-1,1-1 Pac-12) will try to bounce back from
its first loss when it clashes with Arizona (3-2,
0-2) in tomorrow's homecoming game.
"You've got 24 hours to sulk," said senior

nose tackle Terrence Stephens. "After that,
you better get up... If you sit there and sulk in
your misery, you're only going to get worse."
The Cardinal doesn't have any room to get
worse, especially not when the high-octane,
no-huddle Wildcats offense will be flying in.
Revamped by first-year head coach Rich
Rodriguez, Arizona's fast-paced attack has

averaged 88 plays and almost 35 points per
game five games into the season. Early in the
season the Wildcats got off to a quick 3-0 start,
a stretch that included an impressive 59-38
comeback victory over Oklahoma State.
However, Arizona has not fared as well in the
last two games, as it got trounced by Oregon
two weeks ago and then fell just short to
Oregon State last Saturday.
Even so, head coach David Shaw knows
better than to underestimate Rodriguez's
expertise, and what so far seems a successful
implementation of the spread offense.
"When [Rodriguez] was hired, all of us
Pac-12 coaches had hoped that it would take
at least a year before the offense started show
ing signs," Shaw said. "But it really hasn't. The
quarterback's a perfect fit. They've got good
speed, good backs, good receivers. They've
picked it up much faster than most of us
would have liked."
At the helm of Arizona's offense is dual
threat quarterback Matt Scott, who is expect
ed to start despite having suffered a right hip
injury on the first drive against Oregon.
Scott's completion rate stands at over 64 per
cent, while his 321 passing yards per game
puts him second in the conference, behind
only Oregon State quarterback Sean
Mannion.
Although Rodriguez may be reluctant to
have his banged-up quarterback move outside
the pocket too often tomorrow, Scott's stat
line of 228 rushing yards on 52 attempts
attests to his scrambling capabilities, and he
currently leads the Pac-12 in total yards on
offense.
Sophomore running back Ka'Deem Carey,
who has quietly averaged over 107 yards per
game on the ground, is the other component
of Arizona's two-pronged attack. After
uncharacteristically giving up 144 rushing
yards to Washington halfback Bishop Sankey
and inexcusably missing game-changing tack
les last week, the Cardinal run defense will
need to revert to its stingy, sure-tackling ways
if it hopes to limit Carey's impact on the game.

you don't give up any points," said inside line

backer Shayne Skov. "The defense has to have
that mentality."
While Skov and Stephens prefer the down
and-dirty, physical aspect of defense, both of
them expressed confidence in being able to
keep up with Arizona's fast-paced offense,
which resembles Oregon's but is even more
spread out horizontally.
"It's easier to play a team that plays
smashmouth football," Skov said. "It's hard
physically, but as a linebacker, it gets a little
annoying when teams go sideline to sideline
because it's like basketball on grass. I'd rather
be hitting people than running around cashing
them. But if that's what teams want to do, I've
got no problem doing it."
In light of the fact that it was the Stanford
defense that scored the team's only touch
down against Washington, perhaps the biggest
concern for the Cardinal tomorrow is its abil
ity to efficiently move the ball down the field
and into the end zone.
"You never want to leave a game with the
defense scoring more points than you," said
captain center Sam Schwartzstein. "We under
stand this is a team game and we have the best
defense in the country, but we've got to do our
part and we've got to be a great unit, too.
We've got to put the onus on ourselves and
say, 'We need to help the defense out because
they're getting three-and-outs all the time.'"
To avoid those sputtering three-and-outs,
redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes will
need to perform much better than he did
against the Huskies.
"You've got to take everything in stride,"
Nunes said. "When you go out there, it's
essentially practice. You've got to do the
things you've worked on in practice and apply
them in the game."
Despite being ranked last in passing effi

ciency among the 12 quarterbacks in the con
ference, Nunes has been backed up all week
by Shaw and teammates. Nunes aims to com
plete at least 60 percent of his passes a goal
specifically set by Shaw against a vulnera
ble Wildcat secondary that has given up over
284 yards per game through the air.
"One of the things I've learned about Josh is,
he's very good about flushing [bad plays],"
Schwartzstein said. "If it's a bad play, he has a
short-term memory he'll flush it and get
ready to go."
The Wildcats' subpar run defense, sitting at
second to last in the conference, is another
area that the Cardinal hopes to exploit. Senior
tailback Stepfan Taylor was held to 75 rushing
yards by the Washington defense but looks to
be more effective tomorrow behind an offen
sive line that has been making steady strides
in improving communication.
Arizona marks the third conference oppo
nent that Stanford will square off against in just
as many weeks. As the Cardinal's strength of
schedule vamps up, the intensity of the weekly
grind has only increased. Yet it's something
that Shaw expected from the start.
"We all knew it was going to be tough on
everybody [in the conference]," Shaw said.
"Everything is going to be a battle. The big les
son our guys hopefully learned last week is that
you better go into every week ready to play
your best game. These teams are too good
week to week to think you can not play your
best and expect to pull out a victory."
Saturday's contest between the Cardinal
and the Wildcats at Stanford Stadium is sched
uled for a noon kickoff, with television cover
