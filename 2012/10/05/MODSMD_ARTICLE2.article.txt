£ "▼"ever get too high, never
I get too low" has been the
I I mantra for the Cardinal all
\l season. Unfortunately, it's
.A. the latter part of that

phrase that the players have found themselves
focusing on this past week.
On the heels of a frustrating 17-13 defeat
to Washington last Thursday, No. 18 Stanford
(3-1,1-1 Pac-12) will try to bounce back from
its first loss when it clashes with Arizona (3-2,
0-2) in tomorrow's homecoming game.
"You've got 24 hours to sulk," said senior

nose tackle Terrence Stephens. "After that,
you better get up... If you sit there and sulk in
your misery, you're only going to get worse."
The Cardinal doesn't have any room to get
worse, especially not when the high-octane,
no-huddle Wildcats offense will be flying in.
Revamped by first-year head coach Rich
Rodriguez, Arizona's fast-paced attack has

averaged 88 plays and almost 35 points per
game five games into the season. Early in the
season the Wildcats got off to a quick 3-0 start,
a stretch that included an impressive 59-38
comeback victory over Oklahoma State.
However, Arizona has not fared as well in the
last two games, as it got trounced by Oregon
two weeks ago and then fell just short to
Oregon State last Saturday.
Even so, head coach David Shaw knows
better than to underestimate Rodriguez's
expertise, and what so far seems a successful
implementation of the spread offense.
"When [Rodriguez] was hired, all of us
Pac-12 coaches had hoped that it would take
at least a year before the offense started show
ing signs," Shaw said. "But it really hasn't. The
quarterback's a perfect fit. They've got good
speed, good backs, good receivers. They've
picked it up much faster than most of us
would have liked."
At the helm of Arizona's offense is dual
threat quarterback Matt Scott, who is expect
ed to start despite having suffered a right hip
injury on the first drive against Oregon.
Scott's completion rate stands at over 64 per
cent, while his 321 passing yards per game
puts him second in the conference, behind
only Oregon State quarterback Sean
Mannion.
Although Rodriguez may be reluctant to
have his banged-up quarterback move outside
the pocket too often tomorrow, Scott's stat
line of 228 rushing yards on 52 attempts
attests to his scrambling capabilities, and he
currently leads the Pac-12 in total yards on
offense.
Sophomore running back Ka'Deem Carey,
who has quietly averaged over 107 yards per
game on the ground, is the other component
of Arizona's two-pronged attack. After
uncharacteristically giving up 144 rushing
yards to Washington halfback Bishop Sankey
and inexcusably missing game-changing tack
les last week, the Cardinal run defense will
need to revert to its stingy, sure-tackling ways
if it hopes to limit Carey's impact on the game.
"You can't possibly lose football games if
you don't give up any points," said inside line

Southern California reciever Robert Woods, right, can't make the catch as Stanford's Terrence Brown defends. Stanford knocked off USC
21-14 but will have to rebound from last week's upset loss to Washington as the Arizona Wildcats come to the Farm on Saturday.
