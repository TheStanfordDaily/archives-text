# MUSE MUSINGS

Throughout five studio
albums, Muse has
wooed fans with sheer
musical talent and an uncanny
ability for reinvention. For the
risks they've taken — from the
infectious dance hit
"Supermassive Black Hole" to
the sprawling symphony
"Exogenesis" — they've been

rewarded with much-deserved suc
cess. Unfortunately, "The 2nd
Law," Muse's highly anticipated lat
est release, falls flat. The album's
production is glossy and its scope
massive, but the loose collection of
mostly unglued or cliche songs
remains ultimately unmemorable.
The album begins with

"Supremacy," whose huge, crunchy
opening guitar chords promise
some good clean Muse fun. But the
song quickly becomes stale, mor
phing into what sounds like the
soundtrack for the opening credits
of the next lames Bond film.
