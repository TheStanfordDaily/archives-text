## 'Arthur' Is the Only Truth That Sticks

-w-like PBS. I like Big Bird." If this was
I all that Mitt Romney had said
.A.about the Public Broadcasting
Service during the first presidential debate
this week, I would have had nothing to write
but, "Me, too." Instead, he declared that he
would cut government subsidies for PBS as
away to save money and put it toward
"more important" uses.
PBS is important, beloved and powerful,
but I will not argue about its worth in com-

parison to other government programs.
Instead I want to explain why I appreciate
PBS for being the home of my
favorite aardvark, Arthur. I credit
"Arthur," the animated PBS show that
began airing in 1996 and is still on today,
for reinforcing positive values and serv
ing all sorts of educational purposes in
my life and the lives of all its viewers. If
you have somehow forgotten about
"Arthur" or never watched it, it's about an
impossibly cute aardvark and his family and

friends, who are an assortment of friendly
animals who stand upright on two legs, wear
clothes and go to school. And you're probably
less well adjusted. No offense to you, or Jim
Lehrer.
"Arthur" emphasizes the importance of
family and friends and education. The

"Arthur" theme song tells us to believe in our
selves and "get along with each other." And it's
catchy. "Arthur" is basically The Beatles of the
late '9os, but with less obvious drug refer
ences. Arthur Read, by virtue of his last name,
made reading cool. If you tested the audience
of "Arthur" against people who never watched
it, the viewership would spell "aardvark" cor
rectly in infinitely higher numbers, because
everyone who ever saw the spelling bee

Whenever I spell aardvark or hear about
Ohio ("Ooooh Ohio!" said the kids), I think
of Arthur. Thankfully, it's still on TV for a

modern audience of four- to eight-year-old
kids to watch. New episodes have taken on
green living and recycling as values and les
sons to be portrayed by the Read family and
the rest of their Elwood City cohorts. "Arthur"
has gone on living and inspiring audiences,
but we watched it when it began. We are the
hipsters of early education.
Television has the power to teach, to
influence, to inspire. It reinforces norms and
builds norms and occasionally

, breaks them down.
Entertainment is never just
entertainment, especially for
children, and PBS takes
\ the time to make its pro-
J gramming educational
j and worthwhile. So we'll
1 keep our PBS, Mitt, and
our Netflix subscriptions,
Mom!
And thank you, PBS!
Thank you for doing some-

thing useful with government money. Thanks
for "Arthur," "Dragon Tales," "Sesame Street"
and "Masterpiece" miniseries. Don't even get
me started on "Wishbone" that dog really
t prepared me to read the classics.
