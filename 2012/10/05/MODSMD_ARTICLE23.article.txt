# WANTED: SEX (COLUMN)
## 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
People at Stanford have sex. We don't
just think it we know it, we feel it,
sometimes we even do it. We talk about
sex, in awkward frosh-dorm group settings
and casual weekend recaps. Now, we'd like to
read about it too, and we want you to write
about it.
Intermission has and will continue to
publish Roxy Sass, whose irreverent sex col
umn is aimed more to entertain than inform,
and we love that about her. But we feel there's
an entire body of sexual activity, confusion
and advice at Stanford left untapped, and it's

time we start tapping it.
We don't have to tell you college is a place
where sexually prime young adults live in
close quarters and away from society's watch,
breeding a unique sexual air that bears expo
sure. If it weren't for sex columnists, we
wouldn't have "Sex and the City," "Ask Dr.
Ruth," or Dan Savage's puissant comments on
Rick Santorum's (homo)sexuality. And we
wouldn't have anything to read in "Playboy,"
dammit!
Consider this the official Request for
Proposal: Stanford Sex Column.

What we want:
A myriad of points of view, experience
levels and approaches to sex on the Farm. We
want advice, general opinions, suggestions
and even or perhaps especially personal
accounts of sexual experiences, or "sexca
pades," on the Farm and abroad. Second-hand
accounts accepted. Anonymity possible.
About you:
Stanford student, professor or otherwise
affiliated community member
who has sex, lias friends who
have sex, has thought about
sex and would like to write
about it. You might be shy or
even inexperienced, but your
ability to choose sexually rel
evant topics and describe
exciting, educational or oth
erwise entertaining sexual
details makes up for what
you may lack in bedpost
notches.
Male, female, gen
derqueer, straight, gay, pan
sexual, promiscuous, monog
amous, virgin, celibate,
Republican: we want it all.
We're looking for diverse per
spectives and tales from the
deep, and we don't discrimi
nate. Talk to us.
Please direct proposals, sug
gestions and inquiries to inter
mission@stanforddaiiv,com.
