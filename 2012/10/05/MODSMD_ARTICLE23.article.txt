# WANTED: SEX (COLUMN)
## 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
People at Stanford have sex. We don't
just think it we know it, we feel it,
sometimes we even do it. We talk about
sex, in awkward frosh-dorm group settings
and casual weekend recaps. Now, we'd like to
read about it too, and we want you to write
about it.
Intermission has and will continue to
publish Roxy Sass, whose irreverent sex col
umn is aimed more to entertain than inform,
and we love that about her. But we feel there's
an entire body of sexual activity, confusion
and advice at Stanford left untapped, and it's

time we start tapping it.
We don't have to tell you college is a place
where sexually prime young adults live in
close quarters and away from society's watch,
breeding a unique sexual air that bears expo
sure. If it weren't for sex columnists, we
wouldn't have "Sex and the City," "Ask Dr.
Ruth," or Dan Savage's puissant comments on
Rick Santorum's (homo)sexuality. And we
wouldn't have anything to read in "Playboy,"
dammit!
Consider this the official Request for
Proposal: Stanford Sex Column.

What we want:
A myriad of points of view, experience
levels and approaches to sex on the Farm. We
want advice, general opinions, suggestions
and even or perhaps especially personal
accounts of sexual experiences, or "sexca
pades," on the Farm and abroad. Second-hand
accounts accepted. Anonymity possible.
About you:
Stanford student, professor or otherwise
