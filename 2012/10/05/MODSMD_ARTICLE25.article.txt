## 2013 Stanford baseball schedule announced 
### 
A year after cruising through one of the
most challenging nonconference schedules in
history, the Stanford baseball team is set to
play a marginally easier opening stretch this
season after announcing its schedule on
Monday.
In 2012, the Cardinal rose to No. 1 in the
country after sweeping No. 10 Vanderbilt and
No. 12 Texas in its first two series before going
4-2 against Fresno State and No. 4 Rice in later
nonconference series. It will play the
Longhorns, Bulldogs and Owls again this sea
son, but all three of those teams fared much
worse than expected last season; Vanderbilt,
meanwhile, has been replaced on Stanford's
schedule by unranked UNLV.
The Cardinal's schedule is remarkably bal
anced; it will never spend two straight week
ends on the road, and its only significant home
stand is a six-game stretch against UNLV and
Utah in March, with a week off for spring
break in between those two series.
The Cardinal will open the 2013 season at
Rice on Feb. 15 before hosting Cal in a Tuesday
home opener on Feb. 19. Stanford's first home
series will be the following weekend against
Fresno State, the first team to beat the Cardinal
last season, and its Pac-12 opener will be a
three-game tilt against Utah, which Stanford
swept in 2012, the weekend of March 22-24.

Instead of ending the season with a tradi
tional rivalry game against Cal, Stanford's
schedule concludes in a three-game home
series against UCLA a top-10 team last sea
son the weekend of May 24-26.
