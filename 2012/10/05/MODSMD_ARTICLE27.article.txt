# 'PERKS' PLEASES WITH CLICHE

« Perks of Being a
Wallflower" transports
-L audiences to a time
when having friends to hang out
with on a Saturday night was a
godsend, when liking obscure
British pop could suffice as the
foundation of a friendship and
when pretending to be grown up
was indistinguishable from actually
being grown up. That an gst-ridden
epoch was, of course, those four
hellish years called high school that
simply wouldn't end quickly
enough.
And when the film begins, our
wallflower, the smart and introvert
ed Charlie (Logan Lerman), is
about to embark on what he
expects will be his painful and lone
ly first year. He has no friends or
acquaintances and lacks the neces
sary Social skills to win over the
strangers of his new institution.
When we first meet him, he is every
bit the archetype of the ioner. But
as the film progresses, we find out
how and why he got there, and
screenwriter, director and author of
the original novel of the same
name Stephen Chbosky constantly
forces us to question our initial
conception of Charlie.
Our hero meets the self-dep
recating, affable senior Patrick
(Ezra Miller), a social outcast but a
seemingly self-confident one; he
has his own group of friends that
proudly embrace their alienation
as being from "the island of misfit
toys," Through Patrick he meets
the beautiful Sam (Emma
Watson), Patrick's stepsister, whose
love of "The Smiths" and vinyl
instantly puts her in dream-girl
territory. Together they take him to
his first party, introduce him to
marijuana and "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" and welcome him
into their circle of pretentious
friends, for Charlie, it's a dream
Come true; we watcll as Charlie
exalts these seniors, and we see
how his own naivete makes him

oblivious to their foibles.
Alas, friendship is not the solu
tion Charlie may have expected; it's
just a window into another compli
cated world where everyone has
problems. The complexities of
these friendships reveal themselves
in moments of offhand or acciden
tal candor; the movie feels real,
largely due to the strong perform
ances of its cast. These modern
characters prove surprisingly
mature about some issues despite
being clueless about others^
Though young, they share a deep
sense of empatlry and openness,
and the actors effectively portray
their vulnerabilities and desires
while showing just how hard they
work to hide them.
At times it's unclear whether
Chbosky intends what become
cliche motifs. Should Sam's hobby
of standing in the back of their
pickup truck while going through a
tunnel, listening to loud indie pop,
be dismissed as just another
requirement of a high school
movie, sir owing us the carefree
nature of youth? Or is the film self
conscious enough for these scenes
to instead represent the myth that
the characters are creating for
themselves about how much fun
they are having, so that they can
look back on these times with nos
talgia?
"Perks" walks a fine line, but
these hackneyed plot devices tell
more about the stories the charac
ters who grew up on John
Hughes movies try to tell them
selves than a cliched story that
Chbosky is trying to sell to the
audience. This is not a "Revenge of
tire Nerds" film; it's not a simple
story about the archetypal wall
flower learning to be okay with not
being cool. It's a film about very
real and complicated characters
who discover each other's complex
ities and help each other deal with
very difficult situations.
