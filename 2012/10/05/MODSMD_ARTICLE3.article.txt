MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 17, ARIZONA 13: In my opinion,
Arizona is one of the more underrated teams in the confer
ence. They deserved much better than the absolute beat
down Oregon gave them on the final scoreboard, going 0-6
in the red zone and slowing the Ducks' attack in the first half.
Stanford is coming off a tough loss at Washington, and com
ing back home should help Josh Nunes' confidence at least
until he misses his targets. But I still don't see us scoring all
that many points on offense. The Wildcats take an early lead
and blow it, and Stanford holds on late to keep its Rose Bowl
hopes alive.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 34, ARIZONA 17: I don't know what to
believe any more. On the one hand, Stanford has all the tools
it needs to beat Arizona handily in this game. The Wildcats
are small, have struggled as of late, and simply don't match
up well against Stanford. On the other, Stanford showed at
Washington that it is capable of losing to a team with all of
those characteristics. At the end of the day, I think Stanford
rides the boost of homecoming to take care of business at
home, but not before putting a big scare into its fans. Stanford
pulls away late in the game to make it look like a blowout to
everyone who didn't watch. Stanford 34, Arizona 17.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 27, ARIZONA 1 7; I really do believe
that the Cardinal has put last Thursday's disappointing loss
behind it for good and is poised to defeat the Wildcats in a
convincing, though by no means easy, fashion. Josh Nunes
will bounce back emphatically, passing for over 275 yards
and tossing at least one touchdown, while Stepfan Taylor
should get at least 125 yards on the ground. Arizona's quar
terback/running back duo of Matt Scott and Ka'Deem Carey
will do some damage on offense, but look for the Cardinal
defense to force at least two turnovers and remain stout in
the red zone. If Oregon's defense was able to shut out the
Wildcats two weeks ago, there's no reason why Stanford
can't hold them to under 20 points. Though the crowd noise
might not be as loud as it was for the USC game, you can
bet that the stadium will be packed for the Cardinal's home
coming game.
