# STUDENT GROUPS
## The 						Stanford Fund applications open Additional $60,000 available to student groups from Stanford Fund, applications close Oct. 22 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Quiz Bowl Team forgot to submit an application
last spring to request money from The Stanford Fund, a fundrais
ing program that sets aside $400,000 of its earnings each year to
support on-campus student organizations.
But this fall, the team will have a second chance to apply.
This is because Student Activities and Leadership (SAL), the
body responsible for allocating this pot of money to different stu
dent groups, announced on Monday that it would be holding a sec
ond round of applications, due Oct. 22. At the end of last spring
quarter. President John Hennessy approved a request to increase
the amount of money allocated to student groups from The
Stanford Fund (TSF) by approximately $60,000.
Student organizations are allowed to apply for these addition
al funds if they happen to meet one of three criteria: They did not
apply for funding last spring, they had their funding request reject-

Ed last spring or they received funding but are currently facing
extenuating or unforeseen circumstances that require additional
funding.

the extra money could help

for out-of-town competitions.
"We would survive without
it," Sutherlin said, "but it
would be helpful."
Extra funds requested
TSF is an annual fundrais
ing campaign that collects gifts
from alumni and University
community members. All
money raised is spent under
the discretion of the
University president with the
goal of improving the experi
ence of undergraduate stu
dents. Most years, the bulk of
the money —Bl percent in
2010-11—goes toward sup
porting financial aid packages.
The University, however,
allocates another portion of
the fund to SAL, which in turn
distributes the money to stu
dent organizations on campus.
According to Felicity Meu, a
senior associate director in the
Office of Development, this
pool of money has sat at the
same level $400,000 for
at least the past four years.
"In that time period, we've
seen a lot of student groups'
costs rise," Meu said. "So we
wanted to make sure the
money we had to hand out
reflected that increase in cost."
Meu wrote a proposal to
President Hennessy last spring
requesting an increase in funds
allocated to student groups.
Meu said she was able to
make "a strong case" due to
the fact that student organiza
tions had successfully used all
of the money from this pool in
previous years. She also said
the amount raised by TSF had
grown from the previous year,
giving the University extra
funds to spare.
At the end of the quarter,
Hennessy granted the request.
The news, however, came
after the spring deadline for
student groups to file for
money from TSF for the
upcoming academic year. In
response, SAL has decided to
hold a second application
round this fall.
Groups find difficulties meet
ing requirements
DVB, an on-campus hip
hop dance team, has not
requested money from TSF in
at least three years. But after
hearing news about the addi
tional funds, the group is con
sidering applying this fall.
According to DVB presi
dent Lauren Baker 'l3, the
organization has strayed away
from TSF in recent years
because of the time commit
ment and full-group participa
tion that accepting funds
requires.

Each organization that
receives money from TSF
must perform stewardship
works one hour for every
$4O of funding the group
received. Stewardship normal
ly involves writing thank-you
letters to donors or staffing
University events like
Reunion Homecoming
Weekend or Parents'
Weekend.
According to Baker, the
group has managed to find less
time-intensive ways of raising
money to support its activities
over the years than using TSF.
DVB receives funding from
the ASSU appropriations
committee and makes revenue
from ticket sales.
This year, however, DVB is
looking to expand its program
in an effort to grow the hip
hop dance community at
Stanford, which will require
more funding.
"I would say we're looking
to exhaust other resources
before pursuing TSF since it's
a significant amount of work,"
Baker wrote in an email to
The Daily. "But we're definite
ly considering [TSF] as a
option."
She plans to attend one of
the workshops student organi
zations must attend to qualify
for funding. The workshops
are scheduled to be held in
Old Union on Oct. 9, Oct. 11
and Oct. 12, in preparation for
the Oct. 22 application dead
line.
The goal of these work
shops is to determine whether
or not a group should apply
for money from TSF, accord
ing to Nanci Howe, director of
SAL.
"This funding program is
not for everyone," Howe said.
"It's kind of like buying a car
some cars are better for
some people than others. I
think we're trying to help
groups pick the right funding
source for the kinds of activi
ties that they do."
Howe said that a few
organizations struggle with
meeting the stewardship com
ponent, most commonly
because they lack an active
core group of membership or
apply for more funding then
they can logistically support.
Often the best groups for TSF,
she said, are a cappella groups
or club sports teams, because
they have large and active
memberships.
A student organization
president, who was granted
anonymity because he did not
want to harm his relationship
with SAL, said his group has
slowly decreased the amount
of money it has requested
from TSF each year, even
increasing club dues by 50 per
cent this year to make up for
the loss in funding.
"For many years, we strug
gled to comply with all of the
TSF requirements (even
though we outline them the
year before), and it has been a
hassle for our club (around 70

members) to do everything
each quarter to gain substan
tial funds," he wrote in an
email to The Daily. "So for this
year, we decided to request
less and thus have less duties
toTSF."
Baker noted that the pro
gram has improved since she
has been at Stanford, and it
has started allowing groups
other options for meeting their
stewardship hours, such as vol
unteering at events or making
promotional videos. In fact,
many presidents of organiza
tions that received funding
were overwhelmingly positive
about the program.
"I don't mind writing let
ters," Sutherlin said. "We are
getting a lot of money from
them, so I think the least we
can do is write a few letters to
thank them."
Innovative approach to funds
Ankita Rakhe, assistant
director at SAL, will be man
aging the application process.
She expressed hope that hold
ing a second round would help
smaller student organizations,
especially since groups that
have already received funding
would not qualify for the addi
tional round.
"It's really exciting to get a
surplus in funding," Rakhe
said. "I'm hoping that there
are a lot of student organiza
tions that maybe haven't
applied for [the Fund] before
that will come out."
SAL will release funding
results on Nov. 9. The follow
ing week, the Office of
Development plans on hold
ing individual meetings with
each student organization that
received funding to discuss
how they will fulfill the stew
ardship requirement.
Approximately 100 stu
dent groups receive funding
every year, in amounts varying
from $l,OOO to $lO,OOO. The
additional money will proba
bly service 10 to 26 more
groups, according to Meu.
Howe, who has been with
the program since its incep
tion, called it the first of its
kind in the country. She said
that other universities have
expressed interest in replicat
ing the program at their own
institutions because of its
innovative way of funding stu
dent organizations and mak
ing connections between
alumni and students.
"I've worked at a lot of uni
versities and I haven't seen
this kind of direct student
group model anywhere else
before," Meu said. "With the
student group leaders that we
work with, [funding is] an
important area of need on
campus, and for us, we are
incredibly grateful that the stu
dents then turn around and
help us say thank you to all of
these donors in really mean
ingful ways."

receives money from TSF
must perform stewardship
works one hour for every
$4O of funding the group
received. Stewardship normal
ly involves writing thank-you
letters to donors or staffing
University events like
Reunion Homecoming
Weekend or Parents'
Weekend.
According to Baker, the
group has managed to find less
time-intensive ways of raising
money to support its activities
over the years than using TSF.
DVB receives funding from
the ASSU appropriations
committee and makes revenue
from ticket sales.
This year, however, DVB is
looking to expand its program
in an effort to grow the hip
hop dance community at
Stanford, which will require
more funding.
"I would say we're looking
to exhaust other resources
before pursuing TSF since it's
a significant amount of work,"
Baker wrote in an email to
The Daily. "But we're definite
ly considering [TSF] as a
option."
She plans to attend one of
the workshops student organi
zations must attend to qualify
for funding. The workshops
are scheduled to be held in
Old Union on Oct. 9, Oct. 11
and Oct. 12, in preparation for
the Oct. 22 application dead
line.
The goal of these work
shops is to determine whether
or not a group should apply
for money from TSF, accord
ing to Nanci Howe, director of
SAL.
"This funding program is
not for everyone," Howe said.
"It's kind of like buying a car
some cars are better for
some people than others. I
think we're trying to help
groups pick the right funding
source for the kinds of activi
ties that they do."
Howe said that a few
organizations struggle with
meeting the stewardship com
ponent, most commonly
because they lack an active
core group of membership or
apply for more funding then
they can logistically support.
Often the best groups for TSF,
she said, are a cappella groups
or club sports teams, because
they have large and active
memberships.
A student organization
president, who was granted
anonymity because he did not
want to harm his relationship
with SAL, said his group has
slowly decreased the amount
of money it has requested
from TSF each year, even
increasing club dues by 50 per
cent this year to make up for
the loss in funding.
"For many years, we strug
gled to comply with all of the
TSF requirements (even
though we outline them the
year before), and it has been a
hassle for our club (around 70

members) to do everything
each quarter to gain substan
tial funds," he wrote in an
email to The Daily. "So for this
year, we decided to request
less and thus have less duties
toTSF."
Baker noted that the pro
gram has improved since she
has been at Stanford, and it
has started allowing groups
other options for meeting their
stewardship hours, such as vol
unteering at events or making
promotional videos. In fact,
many presidents of organiza
tions that received funding
were overwhelmingly positive
about the program.
"I don't mind writing let
ters," Sutherlin said. "We are
getting a lot of money from
them, so I think the least we
can do is write a few letters to
thank them."
Innovative approach to funds
Ankita Rakhe, assistant
director at SAL, will be man
aging the application process.
She expressed hope that hold
ing a second round would help
smaller student organizations,
especially since groups that
have already received funding
would not qualify for the addi
tional round.
"It's really exciting to get a
surplus in funding," Rakhe
said. "I'm hoping that there
are a lot of student organiza
tions that maybe haven't
applied for [the Fund] before
that will come out."
SAL will release funding
results on Nov. 9. The follow
ing week, the Office of
Development plans on hold
ing individual meetings with
each student organization that
received funding to discuss
how they will fulfill the stew
ardship requirement.
Approximately 100 stu
dent groups receive funding
every year, in amounts varying
from $l,OOO to $lO,OOO. The
additional money will proba
bly service 10 to 26 more
groups, according to Meu.
Howe, who has been with
the program since its incep
tion, called it the first of its
kind in the country. She said
that other universities have
expressed interest in replicat
ing the program at their own
institutions because of its
innovative way of funding stu
dent organizations and mak
ing connections between
alumni and students.
"I've worked at a lot of uni
versities and I haven't seen
this kind of direct student
group model anywhere else
before," Meu said. "With the
student group leaders that we
work with, [funding is] an
important area of need on
campus, and for us, we are
incredibly grateful that the stu
dents then turn around and
help us say thank you to all of
these donors in really mean
ingful ways."

The Stanford Quiz Bowl Team forgot to submit an application
last spring to request money from The Stanford Fund, a fundrais
ing program that sets aside $400,000 of its earnings each year to
support on-campus student organizations.
But this fall, the team will have a second chance to apply.
This is because Student Activities and Leadership (SAL), the
body responsible for allocating this pot of money to different stu
dent groups, announced on Monday that it would be holding a sec
ond round of applications, due Oct. 22. At the end of last spring
quarter. President John Hennessy approved a request to increase
the amount of money allocated to student groups from The
Stanford Fund (TSF) by approximately $60,000.
Student organizations are allowed to apply for these addition
al funds if they happen to meet one of three criteria: They did not
apply for funding last spring, they had their funding request reject-

Ed last spring or they received funding but are currently facing
extenuating or unforeseen circumstances that require additional
funding.

the extra money could help

for out-of-town competitions.
"We would survive without
it," Sutherlin said, "but it
would be helpful."
Extra funds requested
TSF is an annual fundrais
ing campaign that collects gifts
from alumni and University
community members. All
money raised is spent under
the discretion of the
University president with the
goal of improving the experi
ence of undergraduate stu
dents. Most years, the bulk of
the money —Bl percent in
2010-11—goes toward sup
porting financial aid packages.
The University, however,
allocates another portion of
the fund to SAL, which in turn
distributes the money to stu
dent organizations on campus.
According to Felicity Meu, a
senior associate director in the
Office of Development, this
pool of money has sat at the
same level $400,000 for
at least the past four years.
"In that time period, we've
seen a lot of student groups'
costs rise," Meu said. "So we
wanted to make sure the
money we had to hand out
reflected that increase in cost."
Meu wrote a proposal to
President Hennessy last spring
requesting an increase in funds
allocated to student groups.
Meu said she was able to
make "a strong case" due to
the fact that student organiza
tions had successfully used all
of the money from this pool in
previous years. She also said
the amount raised by TSF had
grown from the previous year,
giving the University extra
funds to spare.
At the end of the quarter,
Hennessy granted the request.
The news, however, came
after the spring deadline for
student groups to file for
money from TSF for the
upcoming academic year. In
response, SAL has decided to
hold a second application
round this fall.
Groups find difficulties meet
ing requirements
DVB, an on-campus hip
hop dance team, has not
requested money from TSF in
at least three years. But after
hearing news about the addi
tional funds, the group is con
sidering applying this fall.
According to DVB presi
dent Lauren Baker 'l3, the
organization has strayed away
from TSF in recent years
because of the time commit
ment and full-group participa
tion that accepting funds
requires.

ardship requirement.
Approximately 100 stu
dent groups receive funding
every year, in amounts varying
from $l,OOO to $lO,OOO. The
additional money will proba
bly service 10 to 26 more
groups, according to Meu.
Howe, who has been with
the program since its incep
tion, called it the first of its
kind in the country. She said
that other universities have
expressed interest in replicat
ing the program at their own
institutions because of its
innovative way of funding stu
dent organizations and mak
ing connections between
alumni and students.
"I've worked at a lot of uni
versities and I haven't seen
this kind of direct student
group model anywhere else
before," Meu said. "With the
student group leaders that we
work with, [funding is] an
important area of need on
campus, and for us, we are
incredibly grateful that the stu
dents then turn around and
help us say thank you to all of
these donors in really mean
ingful ways."

The Stanford Quiz Bowl Team forgot to submit an application
last spring to request money from The Stanford Fund, a fundrais
ing program that sets aside $400,000 of its earnings each year to
support on-campus student organizations.
But this fall, the team will have a second chance to apply.
This is because Student Activities and Leadership (SAL), the
body responsible for allocating this pot of money to different stu
dent groups, announced on Monday that it would be holding a sec
ond round of applications, due Oct. 22. At the end of last spring
quarter. President John Hennessy approved a request to increase
the amount of money allocated to student groups from The
Stanford Fund (TSF) by approximately $60,000.
Student organizations are allowed to apply for these addition
al funds if they happen to meet one of three criteria: They did not
apply for funding last spring, they had their funding request reject-

Ed last spring or they received funding but are currently facing
extenuating or unforeseen circumstances that require additional
funding.
While the Quiz Bowl Team often finances its operations by
holding tournaments for high school students and charging an

ate student in chemistry, said
the extra money could help
them fund traveling expenses
for out-of-town competitions.
"We would survive without
it," Sutherlin said, "but it
would be helpful."
Extra funds requested
TSF is an annual fundrais
ing campaign that collects gifts
from alumni and University
community members. All
money raised is spent under
the discretion of the
University president with the
goal of improving the experi
ence of undergraduate stu
dents. Most years, the bulk of
the money —Bl percent in
2010-11—goes toward sup
porting financial aid packages.
The University, however,
allocates another portion of
the fund to SAL, which in turn
distributes the money to stu
dent organizations on campus.
According to Felicity Meu, a
senior associate director in the
Office of Development, this
pool of money has sat at the
same level $400,000 for
at least the past four years.
"In that time period, we've
seen a lot of student groups'
costs rise," Meu said. "So we
wanted to make sure the
money we had to hand out
reflected that increase in cost."
Meu wrote a proposal to
President Hennessy last spring
requesting an increase in funds
allocated to student groups.
Meu said she was able to
make "a strong case" due to
the fact that student organiza
tions had successfully used all
of the money from this pool in
previous years. She also said
the amount raised by TSF had
grown from the previous year,
giving the University extra
funds to spare.
At the end of the quarter,
Hennessy granted the request.
The news, however, came
after the spring deadline for
student groups to file for
money from TSF for the
upcoming academic year. In
response, SAL has decided to
hold a second application
round this fall.
Groups find difficulties meet
ing requirements
DVB, an on-campus hip
hop dance team, has not
requested money from TSF in
at least three years. But after
hearing news about the addi
tional funds, the group is con
sidering applying this fall.
According to DVB presi
dent Lauren Baker 'l3, the
organization has strayed away
from TSF in recent years
because of the time commit
ment and full-group participa
tion that accepting funds
requires.

Each organization that
receives money from TSF
must perform stewardship
works one hour for every
$4O of funding the group
received. Stewardship normal
ly involves writing thank-you
letters to donors or staffing
University events like
Reunion Homecoming
Weekend or Parents'
Weekend.
According to Baker, the
group has managed to find less
time-intensive ways of raising
money to support its activities
over the years than using TSF.
DVB receives funding from
the ASSU appropriations
committee and makes revenue
from ticket sales.
This year, however, DVB is
looking to expand its program
in an effort to grow the hip
hop dance community at
Stanford, which will require
more funding.
"I would say we're looking
to exhaust other resources
before pursuing TSF since it's
a significant amount of work,"
Baker wrote in an email to
The Daily. "But we're definite
ly considering [TSF] as a
option."
She plans to attend one of
the workshops student organi
zations must attend to qualify
for funding. The workshops
are scheduled to be held in
Old Union on Oct. 9, Oct. 11
and Oct. 12, in preparation for
the Oct. 22 application dead
line.
The goal of these work
shops is to determine whether
or not a group should apply
for money from TSF, accord
ing to Nanci Howe, director of
SAL.
"This funding program is
not for everyone," Howe said.
"It's kind of like buying a car
some cars are better for
some people than others. I
think we're trying to help
groups pick the right funding
source for the kinds of activi
ties that they do."
Howe said that a few
organizations struggle with
meeting the stewardship com
ponent, most commonly
because they lack an active
core group of membership or
apply for more funding then
they can logistically support.
Often the best groups for TSF,
she said, are a cappella groups
or club sports teams, because
they have large and active
memberships.
A student organization
president, who was granted
anonymity because he did not
want to harm his relationship
with SAL, said his group has
slowly decreased the amount
of money it has requested
from TSF each year, even
increasing club dues by 50 per
cent this year to make up for
the loss in funding.
"For many years, we strug
gled to comply with all of the
TSF requirements (even
though we outline them the
year before), and it has been a
hassle for our club (around 70

members) to do everything
each quarter to gain substan
tial funds," he wrote in an
email to The Daily. "So for this
year, we decided to request
less and thus have less duties
toTSF."
Baker noted that the pro
gram has improved since she
has been at Stanford, and it
has started allowing groups
other options for meeting their
stewardship hours, such as vol
unteering at events or making
promotional videos. In fact,
many presidents of organiza
tions that received funding
were overwhelmingly positive
about the program.
"I don't mind writing let
ters," Sutherlin said. "We are
getting a lot of money from
them, so I think the least we
can do is write a few letters to
thank them."
Innovative approach to funds
Ankita Rakhe, assistant
director at SAL, will be man
aging the application process.
She expressed hope that hold
ing a second round would help
smaller student organizations,
especially since groups that
have already received funding
would not qualify for the addi
tional round.
"It's really exciting to get a
surplus in funding," Rakhe
said. "I'm hoping that there
are a lot of student organiza
tions that maybe haven't
applied for [the Fund] before
that will come out."
SAL will release funding
results on Nov. 9. The follow
ing week, the Office of
Development plans on hold
ing individual meetings with
each student organization that
received funding to discuss
how they will fulfill the stew
ardship requirement.
Approximately 100 stu
dent groups receive funding
every year, in amounts varying
from $l,OOO to $lO,OOO. The
additional money will proba
bly service 10 to 26 more
groups, according to Meu.
Howe, who has been with
the program since its incep
tion, called it the first of its

that other universities have

ing the program at their own
