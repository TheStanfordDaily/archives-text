## ROTC addresses civilian-military gap 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU DESK EDITOR 
Whenever Kaitlyn Benitez-Strine 'l5 wears her
uniform on campus, people tend to stay away.
"People consider me to be a police officer [when
I'm in uniform]," Beitez-Strine, a Stanford Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadet and
symbolic systems major, said. "I hate first impres
sions in my uniform... Right now, I'm wearing a
white, frilly dress, and that's what I love. I like to be
cute and girly. But you see me first in uniform, you
just have a huge wrong impression, and that's sort of
what this civilian-military gap is."
Continuing a tradition from last year, all 14
Stanford ROTC cadets started wearing their uni
forms to class once a week in hopes of raising more
awareness about this gap at Stanford.
The ROTC program was removed from the
University in 1970 and was invited back in March
2011.

Fourteen students at Stanford participate in ROTC, a college-based program
through which students train to be military officers. The program
was removed from campus in 1970 and invited back in March 2011.
ROTC is a college-based
program through which stu
dents train to be commissioned
military officers. At Stanford,
Army ROTC candidates must
complete courses and practical
training activities at Santa
Clara University and Fort
Camp Parks in Dublin, Calif.
Navy and Marine Corps
ROTC students enroll in cours
es at UC-Berkeley, while Air
Force ROTC students take
courses at San Jose State
University.
This year, four new cadets
have joined the four-year Army
ROTC program at Stanford. A
total of seven cadets now par
ticipate in the program. Isabel
Lopez 'l4 and Benitez-Strine
are two returning students.
Together, they share a two
room double in Branner Hall,
an upperclass dorm with a pub
lic service focus.
"I knew I wanted to serve in
some sense, and I wanted to
work for the government at
some point," Lopez said. "After
9/11, I started thinking more
about the military. After I start
ed doing some research, I just
thought that this would be
something I want to do, and it
was just confirmed once I start
ed ROTC. Now that I'm in it,
I'm happy that I could serve in
this way."
Benitez-Strine hails from a
military family. Both of her par
ents attended the United States
Military Academy at West
Point. Her older sister is cur
rently at the United States
Naval Academy, in addition to
aunts, uncles and cousins who
all serve in various branches of
the military.
"No one has come up and
screamed in my face about it,"
Benitez-Strine chuckled. "I was
really nervous about that, com
ing here. It was a factor in my
decision. I was nervous that
people wouldn't accept me
well. I even put in my room
mate agreement, 'I hope the
people won't hate me because
I'm in ROTC, so please put me
with a roommate that won't
hate the Army."'
Lopez and Benitez-Strine
both start their mornings off

early every week. For Lopez,
her alarm goes off at 5 a.m. at
least five times a week, and
some weeks include all-day
training events on the week
ends. Similarly, Benitez-Strine
wakes up at 6:30 a.m. on
Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays for physical training at
Arrillaga Gym. Their commute
times to Santa Clara University
range from 15 minutes to two
hours, depending on traffic.
They stress time management
as essential to enduring their
hectic schedules.
"I've learned that I really
need to start getting to bed no
later than 10:30 p.m.," Lopez
said. "Just like any other
Stanford student, I just have to
have really good time manage
ment because I know that if I
don't, then I'm going to be pay
ing for it the rest of the week."
According to Captain Tim
Hsia MBA 'l4 J.D. 'l4, a mili
tary history instructor at Santa
Clara University and a current
Stanford graduate student, the
program has seen more support
from the University. This is due,
in large part, to the "unsung
heroes" who supported the
return of ROTC, including the
military veterans and junior
military officers who were
cadets in 2011.
Recent changes include
funding from the Haas Center
for Public Service toward
Zipcars that allow cadets to
commute to their training sites,
recognition as an official stu
dent organization, permission
to take part in the annual
Activities Fair in White Plaza
and a physical office for the
Army branch of ROTC in
Sweet Hall. But most impor
tantly for Lopez, cadets can
now receive activities and aca
demic credit for their ROTC
classes.
"Just last year, we were able
to get our ROTC classes
approved as Stanford units,"
said Lopez, a history major con
centrating in global affairs and
world history with a minor in
modern languages. "That's a
huge deal. Ever since ROTC
got kicked off campus, no one
has been getting credit for their
ROTC classes. So that was a
huge step because for someone
like me, I might be wonied
about graduating on time if I
didn't have those units.... It's
just nice to be recognized now."

This Sunday at 10 a.m., the
Stanford Military Service
Network will host a panel of
alumni at Sigma Nu to discuss
how their Stanford and military
experiences influenced each
other. Lopez and Benitez-
Strine are both affiliated with
the organization
"The overall campus atti
tude towards military recruit
ment and the ROTC program
at Stanford has improved, and
that's due in large part to the
professionalism of Stanford
cadets who have graduated and
also the professionalism of cur
rent cadets," Hsia said in an
email to The Daily.
One major problem though,
according to Lopez, is the lack
of cross-collaboration and
exchange with the greater
Stanford community.
According to Lopez, one of the
most important advantages
that a Stanford education can
give to a member of the mili
tary is the interaction the cam
pus provides with people from
diverse backgrounds.
According to Benitez-
Strine, the best solution for
those seeking change within
the U.S. military is to serve, so
that they can gain perspective
and better understanding. She
wishes there were more inter
action between the small mili
tary community on campus
and the rest of the student
body. Lopez echoed this senti
ment and encouraged mutual
learning, connection-making and
coming together of diverse groups
â€”despite heated protests from
several student organizations in
spring 2011 involving military
recruitment and ROTC on
campus.
"There was friction
between the military communi
ty and other groups on cam
pus," Lopez said. "That makes
right now a crucial time period
for improving civilian-military
relations on campus."
"ROTC is only a small part
of the issue It's good to get
the word out about ROTC, but
ultimately what I'd like to see is
mutual cooperation and defin
ing different ways to serve
together, to learn from one
another between the civilian
sector and the military."

This year, four new cadets
have joined the four-year Army
ROTC program at Stanford. A
total of seven cadets now par
ticipate in the program. Isabel
Lopez 'l4 and Benitez-Strine
are two returning students.
Together, they share a two
room double in Branner Hall,
an upperclass dorm with a pub
lic service focus.
"I knew I wanted to serve in
some sense, and I wanted to
work for the government at
some point," Lopez said. "After
9/11, I started thinking more
about the military. After I start
ed doing some research, I just
thought that this would be
something I want to do, and it
was just confirmed once I start
ed ROTC. Now that I'm in it,
I'm happy that I could serve in
this way."
Benitez-Strine hails from a
military family. Both of her par
ents attended the United States
Military Academy at West
Point. Her older sister is cur
rently at the United States
Naval Academy, in addition to
aunts, uncles and cousins who
all serve in various branches of
the military.
"No one has come up and
screamed in my face about it,"
Benitez-Strine chuckled. "I was
really nervous about that, com
ing here. It was a factor in my
decision. I was nervous that
people wouldn't accept me
well. I even put in my room
mate agreement, 'I hope the
people won't hate me because
I'm in ROTC, so please put me
with a roommate that won't
hate the Army."'
Lopez and Benitez-Strine
both start their mornings off

early every week. For Lopez,
her alarm goes off at 5 a.m. at
least five times a week, and
some weeks include all-day
training events on the week
ends. Similarly, Benitez-Strine
wakes up at 6:30 a.m. on
Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays for physical training at
Arrillaga Gym. Their commute
times to Santa Clara University
range from 15 minutes to two
hours, depending on traffic.
They stress time management
as essential to enduring their
hectic schedules.
"I've learned that I really
need to start getting to bed no
later than 10:30 p.m.," Lopez
said. "Just like any other
Stanford student, I just have to
have really good time manage
ment because I know that if I
don't, then I'm going to be pay
ing for it the rest of the week."
According to Captain Tim
Hsia MBA 'l4 J.D. 'l4, a mili
tary history instructor at Santa
Clara University and a current
Stanford graduate student, the
program has seen more support
from the University. This is due,
in large part, to the "unsung
heroes" who supported the
return of ROTC, including the
military veterans and junior
military officers who were
cadets in 2011.
Recent changes include
funding from the Haas Center
for Public Service toward
Zipcars that allow cadets to
commute to their training sites,
recognition as an official stu
dent organization, permission
to take part in the annual
Activities Fair in White Plaza
and a physical office for the
Army branch of ROTC in
Sweet Hall. But most impor
tantly for Lopez, cadets can
now receive activities and aca
demic credit for their ROTC
classes.
"Just last year, we were able
to get our ROTC classes
approved as Stanford units,"
said Lopez, a history major con
centrating in global affairs and
world history with a minor in
modern languages. "That's a
huge deal. Ever since ROTC
got kicked off campus, no one
has been getting credit for their
ROTC classes. So that was a
huge step because for someone
like me, I might be wonied
about graduating on time if I
didn't have those units.... It's
just nice to be recognized now."

This Sunday at 10 a.m., the
Stanford Military Service
Network will host a panel of
alumni at Sigma Nu to discuss
how their Stanford and military
experiences influenced each
other. Lopez and Benitez-
Strine are both affiliated with
the organization
"The overall campus atti
tude towards military recruit
ment and the ROTC program
at Stanford has improved, and
that's due in large part to the
professionalism of Stanford
cadets who have graduated and
also the professionalism of cur
rent cadets," Hsia said in an
email to The Daily.
One major problem though,
according to Lopez, is the lack
of cross-collaboration and
exchange with the greater
Stanford community.
According to Lopez, one of the
most important advantages
that a Stanford education can
give to a member of the mili
tary is the interaction the cam
pus provides with people from
diverse backgrounds.
According to Benitez-
Strine, the best solution for
those seeking change within
the U.S. military is to serve, so
that they can gain perspective
and better understanding. She
wishes there were more inter
action between the small mili
tary community on campus
and the rest of the student
body. Lopez echoed this senti
ment and encouraged mutual
learning, connection-making and
coming together of diverse groups
â€”despite heated protests from
several student organizations in
spring 2011 involving military
recruitment and ROTC on
campus.
"There was friction
between the military communi
ty and other groups on cam
pus," Lopez said. "That makes
right now a crucial time period
for improving civilian-military
relations on campus."
"ROTC is only a small part
of the issue It's good to get
the word out about ROTC, but
ultimately what I'd like to see is
mutual cooperation and defin
ing different ways to serve
together, to learn from one
another between the civilian
sector and the military."

Whenever Kaitlyn Benitez-Strine 'l5 wears her
uniform on campus, people tend to stay away.
"People consider me to be a police officer [when
I'm in uniform]," Beitez-Strine, a Stanford Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadet and
symbolic systems major, said. "I hate first impres
sions in my uniform... Right now, I'm wearing a
white, frilly dress, and that's what I love. I like to be
cute and girly. But you see me first in uniform, you
just have a huge wrong impression, and that's sort of
what this civilian-military gap is."
Continuing a tradition from last year, all 14
Stanford ROTC cadets started wearing their uni
