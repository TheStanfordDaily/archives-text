## ROTC addresses civilian-military gap 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU DESK EDITOR 
Whenever Kaitlyn Benitez-Strine 'l5 wears her
uniform on campus, people tend to stay away.
"People consider me to be a police officer [when
I'm in uniform]," Beitez-Strine, a Stanford Army
Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadet and
symbolic systems major, said. "I hate first impres
sions in my uniform... Right now, I'm wearing a
white, frilly dress, and that's what I love. I like to be
cute and girly. But you see me first in uniform, you
just have a huge wrong impression, and that's sort of
what this civilian-military gap is."
Continuing a tradition from last year, all 14
Stanford ROTC cadets started wearing their uni
forms to class once a week in hopes of raising more
awareness about this gap at Stanford.
The ROTC program was removed from the
University in 1970 and was invited back in March
2011.

Fourteen students at Stanford participate in ROTC, a college-based program
through which students train to be military officers. The program
was removed from campus in 1970 and invited back in March 2011.
