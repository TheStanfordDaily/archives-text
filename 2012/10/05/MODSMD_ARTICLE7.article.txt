## Symposium encourages undergraduate research 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The 11th annual Symposium of
Undergraduate Research and Public Service
(SURPS) covered topics from "The Stanford
Robot Zombie Apocalypse Comic Book
Series" to "Dark Matter Halo Mass
Characterization Using Galaxy Magnitude
Variations." The event took place at the Frances
C. Arrillaga Alumni Center on Thursday.
Coinciding with Homecoming Weekend, the
symposium was also an opportunity for stu
dents to interact with alumni who participated
in undergraduate research and attended
SURPS.
"I'm interested to see how things are differ
ent from what we did while we were here and
learn something new," Carole Franklin Grace
'77 said, as she browsed the multiple poster
boards in McCaw Hall.
Following up on last year's special 10th
anniversary event featuring an alumni panel,
SURPS returned to its usual goal this year of
"helping students share the outcomes of their
project ideas, and helping the broader Stanford
community explore how engaging these project
experiences can be," Brian Thomas, associate
dean of undergraduate research opportunities,
wrote in an email to The Daily.

Caitlin Eggleston 'l3, who is currently work
ing on a preliminary study on comorbid anxiety
in depressed adolescents, found the event to be
a helpful brainstorming session among peers.
"Sometimes you lose yourself in your own
research and when you talk about it with others,
people ask you questions and [give you] new
ideas for your own thesis," Eggleston said.
For Omar Yaghi 'l4, who presented on using
carbon nanotubules in photothermal therapy
against tumors, an event like SURPS is stan
dard protocol.
"Presenting is a part of science that every
researcher does," Yaghi said.
Even though Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) does not keep a record of
attendance, every year several hundred under
graduates and alumni fill up the space, Thomas
said.
Part of this regular attendance rate may
have to do with effective marketing.
"We do a good deal of outreach through all
of our UAR advisors, such as academic direc
tors in the residences and the professional advi
sors in the AARC and in Sweet Hall," Thomas
said.
Turnout this year matched previous years.
