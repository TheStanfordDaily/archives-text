## Homecoming: History through the pages 
### â€” Edward Ngai Alice Phillips 
As Homecoming Weekend begins,
we took a look through our
archives to find the top headlines
from the last six decades.
Gass of '52
"Roses, ratios and raids," read a headline in
the May 30,1952, issue of The Daily. Indeed,
that year's Stanford football team went to the
Rose Bowl for the first time in more than a
decade (before getting drubbed by the
University of Illinois).
And as for raids, it seems the Gass of 1952's
senior year was not without scandal. "Raids"
refers to the "contagious fever of the 'panty raids'
... unorganized, spasmodic invasions of Roble,
Branner and Hurlburt [House] that resulted in
$7OO worth of damage."
Gass of '62
The University passed the famous "liquor
petition" to reverse a ban on alcohol on cam
pus during the Gass of 1962's senior year. In
the "largest vote in history," the Liquor
Referendum passed easily, with 2,716 for and
741 against. The class's activism was "not initi
ated by a core group of 25 people," read an
editorial in The Daily ("Apathy; students the
only victims," June 1). "It was started by stu
dents from every segment of campus, from
every University division, from every kind of
living group."
Gass of '72
1972 was a year characterized by protests.
Three students disrupted controversial physics
professor William Shockley's class, accusing
him of advocating genocide. President Lyman
went to Washington, D.C., to protest the war in
Vietnam, and 41 professors planned to protest
Marine recruiting at a placement center. In
fact, the University recommended that classes

on May 12 be rescheduled precisely so stu
dents could "engage in political canvassing
and peaceful protest of the latest actions of
President Nixon in Indochina," according to
an article in The Daily ("Gass rescheduling
urged today," May 12).
Gass of 'B2
Sandra Day O'Connor '5O spoke at
Commencement in Frost Amphitheater, but
new wave music, senior pub nights at the "O"
and frozen yogurt might all be equally memo
rable. Frozen yogurt, or "froyo," was described
in The Daily's 1982 Commencement edition as
"the recent campus taste sensation." Thirty
years later, the fad has become beloved tradi
tion.
Gass of '92
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's his
toric words "The Cold War is behind us"
were uttered in Memorial Auditorium the
Class of 1992's sophomore spring. Two years
later, for the class time capsule, '92 chose,
among other items, Hobee's coffee cake
coupons, a Wells Fargo bank card and The
Daily's coverage of the "Condom Rating
Contest": a day in February when 2,000 packs
of condoms were handed out in White Plaza.
Gass of 'O2
The Arrillaga Alumni Center, a brand-new
building designed specifically for the needs for
visiting alumni, was opened. 2001-02 was a
year of unrest and mourning on campus; the
controversial former prime minister of
Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, spoke at Memorial
Auditorium amid protests, and five months
after students returned to campus in the shad
ow of Sept. 11, Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl 'B5 was kidnapped and killed in
Pakistan.
