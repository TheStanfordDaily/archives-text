## Cooking with heart: An inside look at Row house chefs 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Chef Billy Padilla has a unique approach to
cooking: cook enough for twice as many people
as you're serving. This may seem wasteful, but
the Kappa Alpha (KA) house never seems to
have too much food.
According to KA kitchen manager Hunter
Ploch 'l3, around 70 percent of Kappa Alpha
residents are varsity athletes, making the dou
ble-portions much more understandable.
Padilla, who has been a chef in the KA
house for nine years and a Row house chef for

11, follows a simple rule to satisfy KA's 60 hun
gry residents.
"The more protein the better," he said. "In
the beginning, the guys just asked me to put out
a lot of meat."
Chefs play an integral role at Row houses,
where students eat at their residences instead of
at dining halls. Most chefs cook 10 meals per
week, sometimes for 60 people or more, and
residents can use the house kitchens to cook
food on the weekends or eat leftovers.
"We always pack up our
leftovers and put them in the
fridge so that people can heat
up a meal whenever it's con
venient for them," Muwekma
tah-ruk Kitchen Manager
Byron Walker 'l4 said. "It's
such a blessing."
Student Organized
Services (SOS), an independ
ent organization founded by
Stanford alum Nick Peters
'94, is contracted by the
University to both provide
and manage Row house chefs.
According to Aaron Buzay,
director of operations for resi
dential education, SOS
ensures that "chefs prepare
high quality food, comply with
University policy and priori
tize the needs of the individ
ual house communities."
When a Row house needs
a new chef, SOS works with
students in the house to fill the
position, screen initial candi
dates and invite the top con
tenders to an interview.
"The interview includes
the preparation of a sample
lunch/dinner which students
can try," Buzay wrote in an
email to The Daily. "This
allows houses with specific
needs (for example, related to
an academic or ethnic theme)
to emphasize their particular
preferences."
Openings for these posi
tions are rare, with most chefs
working in the houses for
years at a time and some stay
ing at Stanford for more than
15 years. Even though Padilla
is clearly at ease in the KA
kitchen and calls his opera
tion "a well-oiled machine,"
he still refers to himself as
"one of the babies of the
group."

One reason why many
chefs stay for so long is
because they value the strong
bonds they form with stu
dents who come through their
house. Padilla said he gets to
know most of the KA resi
dents at the beginning of their
sophomore year, making
graduation three years later
an emotional event.

Chefs form particularly
close relationships with their
kitchen managers, which is
evident while listening to
Padilla and Ploch banter back
and forth and finish each

other's stories. Kitchen man
agers often have additional
meetings with their chefs to
plan menus.
"She's just a wonderful
lady," Walker said about
Muwekma chef Rosa
Sandoval. "I love spending
time with her and getting to
know her."
Kitchen managers also act
as an intermediary between
residents and the chef.
Xanadu's kitchen manager,
David Raymond 'l3, said he
doesn't expect many com
plaints this year.
"The response to the food
has been pretty awesome so
far," he said.
With the goal of making
sure everyone is well fed and
happy, many kitchen man
agers survey their residents at
the beginning of the year to
find out what types of food
they like and to give the chefs
an idea of what to cook.
"I'm planning on surpris
ing some of the people by hav
ing their favorite dish for din
ner," Walker said. "If they talk
about, 'My mom used to make
enchiladas with guacamole all
the time, and that's one of my
favorite things to have,' I am
going to talk to Rosa about
doing things like that."
Kitchen managers also
work with chefs to plan larger
scale events that the entire
residence can look forward to,
such as special dinners, in

which chefs are paid overtime
to cook gourmet meals.
Special dinner or not,
meals at Row houses are typi
cally highly anticipated by res
idents. For example, Raymond
commended Fabian's ability
to cook a wide variety of
meals, including Mexican
food, curry and Chinese food.
Most chefs are able to devote
extra time and attention to
every dish because, unlike
cooks at dining halls, they are
not under pressure to mass
produce meals.
Some chefs become partic
ularly well known around
campus for certain signature
dishes, such as Padilla's burri
tos. KA holds a burrito night
every other Wednesday, which
Ploch said has become "a
pretty big thing."
With signature dishes, spe
cial dinners, snack budgets
and other perks, it's easy to
see why dining is a huge part
of living in a row house.
Raymond is already thinking
about Xanadu's first special
dinner, which he predicts will
be "a big bonding event" for
the house.
"It's nice to be able to, as
an upperclassman, have a
menu that is specifically
responsive to student feed
back and also damn good
food."

going to talk to Rosa about
doing things like that."
Kitchen managers also
work with chefs to plan larger
scale events that the entire
residence can look forward to,
such as special dinners, in

which chefs are paid overtime
to cook gourmet meals.
Special dinner or not,
meals at Row houses are typi
cally highly anticipated by res
idents. For example, Raymond
commended Fabian's ability
to cook a wide variety of
meals, including Mexican
food, curry and Chinese food.
Most chefs are able to devote
extra time and attention to
every dish because, unlike
cooks at dining halls, they are
not under pressure to mass
produce meals.
Some chefs become partic
ularly well known around
campus for certain signature
dishes, such as Padilla's burri
tos. KA holds a burrito night
every other Wednesday, which
Ploch said has become "a
pretty big thing."
With signature dishes, spe
cial dinners, snack budgets
and other perks, it's easy to
see why dining is a huge part
of living in a row house.
Raymond is already thinking
about Xanadu's first special
dinner, which he predicts will
be "a big bonding event" for
the house.
"It's nice to be able to, as
an upperclassman, have a
menu that is specifically
responsive to student feed
back and also damn good
food."

Chef Billy Padilla has a unique approach to
cooking: cook enough for twice as many people
as you're serving. This may seem wasteful, but
the Kappa Alpha (KA) house never seems to
have too much food.
According to KA kitchen manager Hunter
Ploch 'l3, around 70 percent of Kappa Alpha
residents are varsity athletes, making the dou
ble-portions much more understandable.
Padilla, who has been a chef in the KA
house for nine years and a Row house chef for

11, follows a simple rule to satisfy KA's 60 hun
gry residents.
"The more protein the better," he said. "In
the beginning, the guys just asked me to put out
a lot of meat."
Chefs play an integral role at Row houses,
where students eat at their residences instead of
at dining halls. Most chefs cook 10 meals per
week, sometimes for 60 people or more, and
residents can use the house kitchens to cook
food on the weekends or eat leftovers.
"We always pack up our
leftovers and put them in the
fridge so that people can heat
up a meal whenever it's con
venient for them," Muwekma
tah-ruk Kitchen Manager
Byron Walker 'l4 said. "It's
such a blessing."
Student Organized
Services (SOS), an independ
ent organization founded by
Stanford alum Nick Peters
'94, is contracted by the
University to both provide
and manage Row house chefs.
According to Aaron Buzay,
director of operations for resi
dential education, SOS
ensures that "chefs prepare
high quality food, comply with
University policy and priori
tize the needs of the individ
ual house communities."
When a Row house needs
a new chef, SOS works with
students in the house to fill the
position, screen initial candi
dates and invite the top con
tenders to an interview.
"The interview includes
the preparation of a sample
lunch/dinner which students
can try," Buzay wrote in an
email to The Daily. "This
allows houses with specific
needs (for example, related to
an academic or ethnic theme)
to emphasize their particular
preferences."
Openings for these posi
tions are rare, with most chefs
working in the houses for
years at a time and some stay
ing at Stanford for more than
15 years. Even though Padilla
is clearly at ease in the KA
kitchen and calls his opera
tion "a well-oiled machine,"
he still refers to himself as
"one of the babies of the
group."

One reason why many
chefs stay for so long is
because they value the strong
bonds they form with stu
dents who come through their
house. Padilla said he gets to
know most of the KA resi
dents at the beginning of their
sophomore year, making
graduation three years later
an emotional event.

Chefs form particularly
close relationships with their
kitchen managers, which is
evident while listening to
Padilla and Ploch banter back
and forth and finish each

other's stories. Kitchen man
agers often have additional
meetings with their chefs to
plan menus.
"She's just a wonderful
lady," Walker said about
Muwekma chef Rosa
Sandoval. "I love spending
time with her and getting to
know her."
Kitchen managers also act
as an intermediary between
residents and the chef.
Xanadu's kitchen manager,
David Raymond 'l3, said he
doesn't expect many com
plaints this year.
"The response to the food
has been pretty awesome so
far," he said.
With the goal of making
sure everyone is well fed and
happy, many kitchen man
agers survey their residents at
the beginning of the year to
find out what types of food
they like and to give the chefs
an idea of what to cook.
"I'm planning on surpris
ing some of the people by hav
ing their favorite dish for din
ner," Walker said. "If they talk
about, 'My mom used to make
enchiladas with guacamole all
the time, and that's one of my
favorite things to have,' I am
going to talk to Rosa about
doing things like that."
