## Cooking with heart: An inside look at Row house chefs 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Chef Billy Padilla has a unique approach to
cooking: cook enough for twice as many people
as you're serving. This may seem wasteful, but
the Kappa Alpha (KA) house never seems to
have too much food.
According to KA kitchen manager Hunter
Ploch 'l3, around 70 percent of Kappa Alpha
residents are varsity athletes, making the dou
ble-portions much more understandable.
Padilla, who has been a chef in the KA
house for nine years and a Row house chef for

11, follows a simple rule to satisfy KA's 60 hun
gry residents.
"The more protein the better," he said. "In
the beginning, the guys just asked me to put out
a lot of meat."
Chefs play an integral role at Row houses,
where students eat at their residences instead of
at dining halls. Most chefs cook 10 meals per
week, sometimes for 60 people or more, and
residents can use the house kitchens to cook
food on the weekends or eat leftovers.
