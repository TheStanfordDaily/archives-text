## EDITORIAL The 						Honor Code and Student Responsibility 
### 
The Stanford Honor Code,
written by the student
body in 1921, governs stan
dards of academic integrity at this
school. It is fairly moderate as far as
university honor codes go —neither
as open and trusting as Harvey
Mudd's, which has almost exclusive
ly take-home finals and 24-hour
building access for all students, nor as
stringent and unforgiving as the
University of Virginia's, which
requires automatic expulsion for any
violation of the code.
The Honor Code is the reason,
for instance, that examinations are
not directly proctored by profes
sors or TAs; the Code states that
the faculty "manifests its confi
dence in the honor of its students
by refraining from proctoring
examinations and from taking
unusual and unreasonable pre
cautions to prevent [academic dis
honesty]."
We, the students, are theoreti
cally trusted (and expected) to be
our own academic police force.
The original spirit of the Honor
Code is not being fully embodied
in its current practice. This is par
ticularly evident in the overly rigid
structure of some university exam
inations, which exhibit neither
trust nor confidence in the honor
of the students.
While we realize that there are
administrative and logistical bene
fits to requiring students to take
end-of-term exams all at the same
time and in the same room, this can
have detrimental effects for certain
groups of students. Athletes at
away games or tournaments, for
instance, are often forced to take
rushed final exams in between
games, races, or matches merely
because the exam is being adminis
tered at Stanford at the same time.
The same holds true for scientists
presenting their work, artists per
forming or presenting a piece, or
aspiring businessmen and business
women away interviewing for jobs
around the country and the world.
Many classes require a sit
down, end-of-quarter final exam
in a rigid time slot; syllabi note that
students may not take the class if
they cannot make this time.
Undergraduates are familiar with
the shortcomings of this rigid
structure: multiple exams in a
compressed window of time,
exams later or earlier than is con
venient for students, conflicts with
other commitments and other
issues affect students' abilities to
take classes they want and per
form well on their exams.
A true interpretation of the

Honor Code would account for
these special burdens by trusting
these students to take examinations
on and at their own time. Many pro
fessors have adopted this approach
already, which we wholeheartedly
applaud. But we would like to see, as
we believe many students would as
well, this policy adopted at an institu
tional level.
Even for students not required
to be away from school during
exams, however, the current inter
pretation of the Honor Code
needs to be re-envisioned. There is
no reason under the current Code
that examinations should not be
universally in take-home format.
Many students perform best when
they work on their own schedule
and in their own style early, late,
with music or without, in a dorm
room or in the library. The only
explanation for why this is not
allowed would seem to be that stu
dents are not trusted to abstain
from cheating.
Maybe we shouldn't be.
According to the Office of
Judicial Affairs, there were 82
Honor Code violations in 2008-
2009, the most recent year for
which detailed statistics are avail
able. A more open policy on
examinations would certainly
encourage more cheating, espe
cially given the pressures students
currently face to succeed. In all
likelihood, more than 82 viola
tions of the Code occur in any
given year solely on exams, and the
figure is probably increasing as
smartphones become more sophis
ticated, more discreet and more
widespread.
It may be that the cost of open
ing up examinations outweighs
the benefits. Cheating on take
home exams, a difficult thing to
detect, has likely plateaued, but
this is a figure no one could possi
bly determine with accuracy.
The real question to ask is
what we, the students of the
University who have the responsi
bility to amend the honor code,
want to do. If we want complete
trust from the University and
want to rely on the self-control of
students to prevent cheating, we
should start demanding the cur
rent Honor Code be more strictly
adhered to.
On the other hand, if we wish
to continue the policies in place
today that seek to prevent cheat
ing at the institutional level, we
should amend the Honor Code to
reflect that reality and stop pre
tending we go to a University that
trusts us explicitly.

The Stanford Honor Code,
written by the student
body in 1921, governs stan
dards of academic integrity at this
school. It is fairly moderate as far as
university honor codes go —neither
as open and trusting as Harvey
Mudd's, which has almost exclusive
ly take-home finals and 24-hour
building access for all students, nor as
stringent and unforgiving as the
University of Virginia's, which
requires automatic expulsion for any
violation of the code.
The Honor Code is the reason,
for instance, that examinations are
not directly proctored by profes
sors or TAs; the Code states that
the faculty "manifests its confi
dence in the honor of its students
by refraining from proctoring
examinations and from taking
unusual and unreasonable pre
cautions to prevent [academic dis
honesty]."
We, the students, are theoreti
cally trusted (and expected) to be
our own academic police force.
The original spirit of the Honor
Code is not being fully embodied
in its current practice. This is par
ticularly evident in the overly rigid
structure of some university exam
inations, which exhibit neither
trust nor confidence in the honor
of the students.
While we realize that there are
administrative and logistical bene
fits to requiring students to take
end-of-term exams all at the same
time and in the same room, this can
have detrimental effects for certain
groups of students. Athletes at
away games or tournaments, for
instance, are often forced to take
rushed final exams in between
games, races, or matches merely
because the exam is being adminis
tered at Stanford at the same time.
The same holds true for scientists
presenting their work, artists per
forming or presenting a piece, or
aspiring businessmen and business
women away interviewing for jobs
around the country and the world.
Many classes require a sit
down, end-of-quarter final exam
in a rigid time slot; syllabi note that
students may not take the class if
they cannot make this time.
Undergraduates are familiar with
the shortcomings of this rigid
structure: multiple exams in a
compressed window of time,
exams later or earlier than is con
venient for students, conflicts with
other commitments and other
issues affect students' abilities to
take classes they want and per
form well on their exams.
A true interpretation of the

Honor Code would account for
these special burdens by trusting
these students to take examinations
on and at their own time. Many pro
fessors have adopted this approach
already, which we wholeheartedly
applaud. But we would like to see, as
we believe many students would as
well, this policy adopted at an institu
tional level.
Even for students not required
to be away from school during
exams, however, the current inter
pretation of the Honor Code
needs to be re-envisioned. There is
no reason under the current Code
that examinations should not be
universally in take-home format.
Many students perform best when
they work on their own schedule
and in their own style early, late,
with music or without, in a dorm
room or in the library. The only
explanation for why this is not
allowed would seem to be that stu
dents are not trusted to abstain
from cheating.
Maybe we shouldn't be.
According to the Office of
Judicial Affairs, there were 82
Honor Code violations in 2008-
2009, the most recent year for
which detailed statistics are avail
able. A more open policy on
examinations would certainly
encourage more cheating, espe
cially given the pressures students
currently face to succeed. In all
likelihood, more than 82 viola
tions of the Code occur in any
given year solely on exams, and the
figure is probably increasing as
smartphones become more sophis
ticated, more discreet and more
widespread.
It may be that the cost of open
ing up examinations outweighs
the benefits. Cheating on take
home exams, a difficult thing to
detect, has likely plateaued, but
this is a figure no one could possi
bly determine with accuracy.
The real question to ask is
what we, the students of the
University who have the responsi
bility to amend the honor code,
want to do. If we want complete
trust from the University and
want to rely on the self-control of
students to prevent cheating, we
should start demanding the cur
rent Honor Code be more strictly
adhered to.
On the other hand, if we wish
to continue the policies in place
today that seek to prevent cheat
ing at the institutional level, we
should amend the Honor Code to
reflect that reality and stop pre
tending we go to a University that
trusts us explicitly.
