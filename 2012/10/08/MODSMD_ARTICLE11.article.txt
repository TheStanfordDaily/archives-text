# Do You MIND?
## The 						Prodigal Black Sheep

a certain way in
which I think the black
J. community is developed to
assist one in escaping the everyday
mundane stressors that come from
experiencing racism," one of my
sources from last week's feature on
black queer men at Stanford said to
me during our interview.
Michael used this explanation to
shed light on his recent preference
towards men of the African Diaspora.
"My focus on African-American
men does partially come out of the
experiences I've had at Stanford, but
it also comes out of a need to feel as if
the person I'm with is treating me and
viewing me as an equal, so that I'm
fully allowed to engage with them and
be on the same page."
Michael's words resonate deeply
with me and frame the development
of this week's column.
In the wake of Trayvon Martin's
shooting, I was paralyzed by my
inability to communicate the depth of
the trauma I felt from witnessing yet
another public and unjust death of an
innocent black male. The larger source
of my paralysis was the despair I felt at
having to live with and react against a
justice system that has historically
failed black men.
This despair, coupled with the lone
liness I described feeling spring quar
ter, led me to make a radical shift in
own trajectory on campus academ
ically, extracurricularly and socially.
I have found myself feeling radical
ly more comfortable with being black.
Around the same time, I switched
my academic program to Comparative
Studies in Race & Ethnicity, preas
signed to live in Ujamaa House,
applied to spend winter quarter in
Cape Town, and joined the Stanford
NAACP all rooted in a desire to
connect with people and communities
that can better sympathize with and
respond to my experiences.
Because the black community and
black culture can appreciate the expe
rience of negative racial discrimination
whether real or perceived —my
preferences have shifted to interacting
with black and ethnic communities
and consuming more black literature
and media.
Erykah Badu, in particular, has
become a symbol of my new, black
refuge. Singing of the erasure of
African (American) history and cul
ture, our struggle for our men and

women to empower themselves, the
challenges of loving and being loved
within such contexts, and our individ
ual and collective excellence, her music
has been therapeutic. (My conversion
to Baduizm may receive its own full
column soon.)
All of these changes came as a
huge surprise to my family my sib
lings sometimes tease that I'm not
"black" enough or express surprise
that I am interested in some areas of
black culture. But beyond surprising
them, these changes also surprised me.
I entered Stanford as someone
who was willing to embrace the culture
of diversity in our university, as long as
it meant that I didn't have to interact
with a community I thought I already
knew —the black community.
Uncomfortable with my racial
identity in the context of my intellec
tual, social and cultural identity, I
avoided the sites that largely house
Stanford's black community the
Black Community Services Center
and Ujamaa House.
It was not until I completed an
Alternative Spring Break trip last
school year (in the height of the media
attention to Trayvon's death) that I
came to two major realizations: first,
that before the trip, I could count the
number of black friends I had on one
hand; and second, that I didn't need to
look only to the black community to
find people with whom I could
express my anxieties about the injus
tice of our world and feel solidarity.
ASB opened my eyes to a world of
students from all backgrounds inter
ested in conversations about social
justice along lines of race, gender, sex
uality and class. About half of my
group were CSRE majors and about

half had lived in Ujamaa House at
some point, regardless of race.
Finding a place of love and respect
with this group and within the larger
communities was pivotal to helping
me come to a place of loving and
respecting myself and the racial iden
tity I inherit.
Fast forward to the beginning of
September: my CSRE-Badu-black
love regimen had all held up well over
the summer when I was removed
from the issues of alienation I'd expe
rienced on campus but I could not
tell to what degree the changes I'd
made were real and lasting and to
what degree they were buffers for an
inevitable fall.
Three weeks in, I think the opti
mism I now hold is grounded. Two of
my courses are led by African
Americans Modern African
American History being the first
course I've ever had that a black male
has led and Queering Afro-Futurism
being the first course I've had since
middle school that a black female has
led.
Ujamaa House has shown itself so
far to represent the notion that peo
ple from all backgrounds can care
about and talk about minority issues
and how we as a society might
address inequality.
And it was only today that I
noticed how the Black Community
Services Center, ("the Black House")
has already been the site of very dif
ferent activities.
Sitting in an NAACP core meet
ing Sunday afternoon discussing our
goals for the year and visions for the
future, it took me a while to realize
that just hours before, I'd been danc
ing (which I rarely do) and enjoying it
(also rare) with students and alumni
at the homecoming Block Party. And
just a day before that, I'd had the
chance to meet the founder of Black
and Queer at Stanford and gather
with alumni of the group, spanning 30
years.
I don't wish to paint a picture-per
fect portrait as I wrote last week
about 'twisting the screw,' I will dig a
little deeper into my experiences
within our black communities but
I can so far describe a sense of ease
and comfort that I had, until now, yet
to feel at Stanford.

I have found
myself feeling
radically more
comfortable with
being black.
