# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Affirmative Action? Good, but not enough 
### Miles Unterreiner 
On Wednesday, the Supreme
Court of the United States will
hear oral arguments in the case
of Fisher v. University of Texas.
Brought by Abigail Fisher, a white stu
dent who claims that the University of
Texas system denied her admission
because of her race under its current
affirmative action plan, Fisher has the
potential to render race-based affirma
tive action unconstitutional in university
admissions especially likely given the
conservative bent of the current Court.
The upcoming case has reignited
an old series of debates, largely
untouched since 2003's Grutter v.
Bollinger , about the continued rele
vance of affirmative action programs
in higher education. People who are
smarter and more informed than I am
have advocated various policy solu
tions shifting the focus of affirma
tive action from race to class, doing
away with affirmative action altogeth
er, or strengthening a fading national
commitment to students of minority
descent by preserving the status quo
in response to what could be one of

the Court's most important rulings on
race and education this side of the
new century. I'm not going to rehash
these debates here.
Instead, I'd like to argue very
briefly that all of this rather misses
the point. All parties to the argument
seem to agree that affirmative action
artificially increases the number of
minority students admitted to univer
sities; they simply disagree about
whether this measure is justified.
I'd like to suggest that the very fact
that African-American, Hispanic, and
lower-class students of all races still
continue to require assistance from
the state in order to make it to col
lege is proof in itself that this country
continues to face very serious prob
lems in educational and social equity
problems that begin long before
the senior year admissions dance to
which Fisher is about to set the tune.
By the time a high school senior
decides to apply to college and
many, too many, never do many of
her skills, interests, talents, and convic
tions have already been determined by

her parents, living environment, and
level of educational opportunity.
The Fisher case provides instruc
tive evidence in this regard. The
University of Texas system, in an
attempt to maintain a diverse enter
ing class via racially neutral means,
has long used a "top 10 percent" sys
tem to admit freshman applicants.
The system works, as its name sug
gests, by automatically accepting
applicants from the top ten percent
of their high school class. Since a sig
nificant number of high schools in
Texas remain effectively racially
homogeneous, the "top 10 percent"
plan has had the beneficial side effect
of admitting African-American and
Hispanic students who have per
formed well by the standards of their

de facto segregated high schools
even if not by state or national stan
dards into the University of Texas
system.
But by the time the top 10 percent
plan has kicked in, many of these stu
dents have faced 12 years of school
ing in an inadequate, segregated sys
tem. The damage has been done. And
affirmative action has become a
Band-Aid on a gaping wound.
In short, affirmative action before
college is too little, too late. Tinkering
with admissions numbers when a child
is 18 does little to address the many
underlying root causes of inequality
causes from race to class to geo
graphic location that this country

has yet to deal with in a satisfactory,
even adequate, manner.
Whatever the Court decides in
Fisher will make headline news. The
countless individual stories of kids in
schools with more guns than books,
kids with single moms or dads whose
jobs got them home too late to read
before bed, kids who missed out on
the elite $20,000-per-year kinder
garten regime and had to settle for
inadequately funded public schools
those stories won't.
And those are the stories we
should be listening to.
