## Nunes plays hero in thrilling win 
### Joey Beyda 
My friends, you just wit
nessed the best game
ever played in the
seven-year history of
the new Stanford
Stadium. And it wouldn't have hap
pened without the most inspiring per
formance by a Stanford quarterback
since Tavita Pritchard upset No. 2 USC
five years ago to the day Saturday.
Josh Nunes' numbers were almost
as pretty as his deep balls in his team's
54-48 overtime win against Arizona. But
it wasn't just that he threw for 360 yards
and completed 61.8 percent of his pass
es, both career bests, and had five com
pletions of more than 20 yards.
The man who could never, ever
replace Andrew Luck squarely won the
hearts of a fan base that, even through
two quarters, still murmured Brett
Nottingham's name whenever he
underthrew a pass. The man who head
coach David Shaw had never seen
scramble before the season opener
became No. 18 Stanford's top red
zone option with three-yes,
three-touchdown runs. The man
whose team wasn't playing for him
in last Thursday's loss rallied the
Cardinal from a two-touchdown
deficit in the final nine minutes.
That's why Shaw has been so insis
tent on defending his quarterback. And
Shaw's confidence isn't just a charade
for the media, folks. Down a touch
down and in a short-yardage, red-zone
situation, he had enough faith in
Nunes to call three straight pass
plays. It took a fourth-down conversion
to keep Stanford alive, but it worked
nonetheless.
Stanford's offense has rarely clicked
from top to bottom like it did on
Saturday, even with Luck at the helm. Its
four senior pass-catchers were there
when Nunes needed them. Tight end
Levine Toilolo had his best game in car
dinal (141 efficient yards on just five
catches), Zach Ertz was steady as always
and Drew Terrell and Jamal-Rashad
Patterson came up with some clutch
grabs of their own.
The offensive line had a shaky open
ing half but eventually paved the way
for a 142-yard afternoon for Stepfan
Taylor, who took just two carries to
solidify the win in overtime. And when
Taylor went to the locker room tem
porarily in the third quarter with what
appeared to be a hand injury, Kelsey
Young got into the act with a 55-yard
end-around to snag a 34-33 lead.
All that made for eight offensive
touchdowns, compared to 10 through
Stanford's first four games and zero last
week against the Huskies.
But, while the Cardinal had one of
its most electrifying offensive perform
ances since that memorable USC upset
five years ago, it also had arguably the
worst defensive flop in that time period.
From the start of the second quarter to
the 9:06 mark of the fourth, Arizona
scored on eight of its nine drives. The
only stop came when a false-start penal
ty ruined a fourth-and-1 opportunity
that the Wildcats likely would have con
verted, given the unexpected woes of
Stanford's front seven â€”not the appar
ent shortcomings of its secondary.
It's a bit too easy to lop all the blame
on the Cardinal's defensive backs; Matt
Scott's 45 completions were a Pac-12
record, after all. The unit lost shutdown
corner Terrence Brown early in the
game-an Arizona ball-carrier tried to
hurdle Brown and instead went straight
through his head-and Usua Amanam
and Ed Reynolds both left the field with
injuries before returning. That's three of
five starters who were either out or
banged up at some point, and the
Wildcats took full advantage by passing
for 491 yards
The front seven deserves more of a
scarlet letter, even though it sacked
Scott three times An unknown com
modity at running back went for over
125 yards for the second straight game,
and the lack of a pass rush made it all
too easy for Scott to operate. It's harder
to pressure against a spread offense, but
with the athletes Stanford has, the same
pass-rush formula that threw Matt
Barkley off his rhythm has just got to be
the catalyst on defense.
The late-game effort to force a
three-and-out and an overtime inter
ception was nice, but it is wholly over
shadowed by the group's frustrations for
the first 53 minutes. Stanford's front
seven looked angry on the bench, with
one player spiking his helmet after
allowing a second-half score. Where was
that energy between the hash marks?
No disrespect to Nunes, who without
question is the man of the hour, but
Arizona's defense is one of the worst on
the Cardinal's schedule, and Stanford
probably won't score enough points to
keep up again if it gets into a shootout
against, say, Oregon. (Wonder how I
chose the Ducks...)
