# TROY STANDS TALL
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
For a little over two quarters, it
looked like No. 5 Stanford was just
as good, if not better, than USC's
dominant top-ranked water polo
team. With a one-goal margin at
halftime, the table was set for a
repeat of the overtime thriller these
two teams played back on Sept. 16 at
the NorCal Invitational.

Then, in what seemed like the
blink of an eye, USC (15-0, 2-0
MPSF) ambushed the back of the
Cardinal net and put the game out of
reach with four third-quarter goals
and a stalwart defensive display. The
first of those goals came less than 30
seconds into the second half, and the
Trojans followed it up with another
before 60 seconds had ticked off the
game clock.

"In the second half, our defense
broke down due to errors on our
part," senior driver Travis Noll said.
"We knew what they were going to
do, but still made mistakes and fell
into their traps. They consistently
capitalized on these mistakes."
Stanford (6-3, 0-1 MPSF) strug
gled to take advantage of its own
chances offensively, managing no
more than two goals in any quarter
in the 9-6 loss. After a goal from
sophomore utility Alex Bowen put
Stanford up 3-2 with 7:39 left in the
second quarter, the Cardinal failed
to score again before halftime.
The next Stanford goal, scored by
junior two-meter Forrest Watkins
less than a minute into the second
half, kept the game close at 5-4. But
then Stanford went on another scor
ing drought of over seven minutes
that spanned the rest of the back
breaking third quarter.
Bowen scored his second at the
start of the fourth quarter to bring
Stanford within 8-5, but by then all
of the momentum clearly belonged
to USC and that was the extent of

the Cardinal comeback.
The aggressive and physical
defense played by USC disrupted
Stanford's offense and limited the
number of quality possessions and
shots they could get off. USC goalie
James Clark needed only nine saves
in the game far fewer than the 16
made by Stanford's redshirt junior
goalie Scott Platshon.
Conspicuously absent from the
Cardinal score line until the final 18
seconds were two of Stanford's best
shooters, freshman driver BJ
Churnside and freshman utility Bret
Bonanni. The two of them com
bined for three goals in the 10-9
overtime loss earlier this season, but
they were both held scoreless this
Saturday until Bonanni netted a
consolation goal in the last posses
sion.
"They play a really tough press,
but ultimately once they drop we
just have to be able to put our shots
away and that didn't happen as eas
ily as we would've liked in the sec
ond half," Bonanni said.
All indications are that the road

to the 2012 NCAA Championship
will go through four-time defending
champion USC, which has already
beaten every team ranked in the top
six. After the loss, Stanford is hoping
it gets another chance to meet USC
again in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs, the NCAA tour
nament, or both, and the team was
seemingly upbeat about their
chances to take down the Trojan jug
gernaut.
"We know we can beat them if
we manage to play a game similar to
that of the first half," Noll said,
adding, "It will take four quarters of
quality water polo, not just two. We
have to play with intensity and disci
pline the entire game."
Bonanni shared that sentiment,
and despite his struggles against
USC he maintains a positive attitude
about the match-up.
"They are just a clutch team, but
we can definitely beat them," he
said.

James Clark needed only nine saves
in the game far fewer than the 16
made by Stanford's redshirt junior
goalie Scott Platshon.
Conspicuously absent from the
Cardinal score line until the final 18
seconds were two of Stanford's best
shooters, freshman driver BJ
Churnside and freshman utility Bret
Bonanni. The two of them com
bined for three goals in the 10-9
overtime loss earlier this season, but
they were both held scoreless this
Saturday until Bonanni netted a
consolation goal in the last posses
sion.
"They play a really tough press,
but ultimately once they drop we
just have to be able to put our shots
away and that didn't happen as eas
ily as we would've liked in the sec
ond half," Bonanni said.
All indications are that the road

to the 2012 NCAA Championship
will go through four-time defending
champion USC, which has already
beaten every team ranked in the top
six. After the loss, Stanford is hoping
it gets another chance to meet USC
again in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs, the NCAA tour
nament, or both, and the team was
seemingly upbeat about their
chances to take down the Trojan jug
gernaut.
"We know we can beat them if
we manage to play a game similar to
that of the first half," Noll said,
adding, "It will take four quarters of
quality water polo, not just two. We
have to play with intensity and disci
pline the entire game."
Bonanni shared that sentiment,
and despite his struggles against
USC he maintains a positive attitude
about the match-up.
"They are just a clutch team, but
we can definitely beat them," he
said.
