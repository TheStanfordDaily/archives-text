# Card avoids upset bids
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Heading into the weekend, the women's soc
cer team was riding a 34-game winning streak in
conference play, having not lost a league match
since October 2008, an impressive run of domi
nance.
But trailing on the road against a hungry
Colorado team searching for its first-ever Pac-12
victory, the No. 2 Cardinal (11-1-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
was in trouble. Seniors Mariah Nogueria and
Alina Garciamendez didn't blink, scoring two
goals within 37 seconds of each other with 10
minutes remaining to keep the streak alive.

Friday's 1-0 conquest of Utah (8-3-2,2-2) was
the second straight victory that left head coach
Paul Ratcliff with at least a few grey hairs.
The end result on both days, however, was
positive for Stanford, which is once again atop the
Pac-12 standings as it searches for its fourth con
secutive conference crown.
"I was very happy with our performance,
especially with our possession and style of play,"
Ratcliffe said after downing the Utes. "But we can
get better in the final third."
His comments certainly seemed prescient as
Stanford struggled to finish its chances against
the Buffaloes (6-5-3,0-4-1) for 75 minutes. And a
goal from Colorado's Emily Paxton just seconds
before halftime put Stanford behind for the first
time since Aug. 26.
It wasn't for a lack of chances, as the Cardinal
kept Colorado goalkeeper Annie Brunner on her
toes with nine shots in the first half alone.
With his team still trailing late in the match,
however, Ratcliffs hand was forced and he
pushed defensive midfielder Nogueira and
defenders Garciamendez and Rachel Quon into
the attack.
Nogueira struck first, receiving freshman
defender Laura Liedle's pass and knocking a shot
past Brunner into the upper left corner from
inside the box. It was her team-leading sixth goal
of the season, but the first not to come off of a
header.

Stanford stripped Colorado off of the ensuing
restart and quickly counterattacked as Quon
found a streaking Garciamendez. The Mexican
national team player snuck the ball past Brunner
as the goalie charged out, putting the Cardinal
back in command.
But it was another senior, Nina Watkins, who
gave the Cardinal the win over Utah. Coming off
the bench in the 30th minute, Watkins took full
advantage of a slip up in the Utes defense. As the
defenders raced up on a long free kick from
Quon, they caught four Stanford attackers in an
offsides trap. Watkins, however, continued her
run from an onside position and found herself all
alone in front of the goal. A calm finish past goal
keeper Lindsey Luke into the side net gave

Watkins her second goal of the season and the
fourth of her career, and proved to be the game
winner.
"Her composure was amazing," Ratcliffe said
of Watkins, but had to be at least slightly upset
that his team could not capitalize further in the
attack half Stanford dominated possession
and outshot the Utes 12-4 in the match.
The result was nevertheless a good one for
Stanford, which will take the field again on
Thursday against the Arizona Wildcats. The game
will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks from
Tucson, Ariz.
