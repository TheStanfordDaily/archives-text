## TOP 5 Moments of the Presidential Debate 
### 
Intermission understands
how busy Wednesday
nights are at Stanford, and
we get that even the most
civic-minded students
may have missed some or all of
last Wednesday's presidential
debate. We've compiled the
highlights of the debate here
so that everyone can keep their
references current (and hear
some of the funnier moments
of the program).
"I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I
actually like you, too."
Mitt Romney referred to the
Sesame Street star and Jim
Lehrer, both longtime features
of PBS programming, in his
explanation of his intended
budget cuts. Good to know it's
not personal, but let's be real,
who doesn't love Big Bird?
Regardless, it was a well-exe
cuted and much needed
humanizing moment for
Mittens. Clearly, Big Bird
should've taken Clint
Eastwood's place as the sur
prise celeb speaker at the
Republican National
Convention.
"By the way, I've become
fond of this term
Obamacare."
Barack Obama threw out this
quip, owning his bill's
moniker and reminding view
ers that he doesn't sweat the
small stuff. The subtext is
something along the lines of
two can play the joking game,
Mitt! If only there had been a
follow-up question where the
candidates could weigh in on
how they like the Romneycare
nickname in comparison.
"And congratulations to you.

Mr. President, on your anniver
sary. I'm sure this was the
most romantic place you could
imagine here with me!"
Mitt Romney killin' it with an
actual joke! It's probably extra
funny in his mind because the
idea of two men celebrating the
anniversary of their loving
marriage is so wildly impossible
to him.
"Under Governor Romney's
definition, there are a whole
bunch of millionaires and bil
lionaires who are small busi
ness. Donald Trump is small
business. And I know Donald
Trump doesn't like to think of
himself as small anything."
Woaaah, this might be a little
out of pocket, Barack! Did this
seem below the belt (literally) to
any voters outside the 18-25
demographic, by the way? Just
us? Intermission does love some
public celebrity smack talk, but
the White House
Correspondents' Dinner was
much more entertaining and on
point. Real talk though, what
was this bit supposed to mean?
Romney: "Let's talk..."
Lehrer: "No, let's not." [Cue
the laugh track.]
This sassy, borderline testy
exchange between moderator
Jim Lehrer and Governor
Romney was a much needed
break from the dense, lengthy
and numbers-heavy stretch of
debate between Romney and
Obama. Intermission forgave
Lehrer for otherwise letting
the candidates go a-ramblin'
by finally standing his ground
and sticking some semblance
of those darn time limits. This
was also the most tweeted tid
bit of the entire debate.

f ■ contemporary music
scene is the world's truest
democracy. Together, we
created Justin Bieber let's not
forget that his debut was a
You Tube video uploaded by his
mother, and the denizens of the
internet (preteen girls and skeptics
alike) catapulted him into interna
tional stardom.
This type of crowd-sourced
A&R is extremely empowering. The
question is: will we use this for
good or for evil?
To the dismay of hipsters
everywhere, pop audiences are
showing a taste for all things alter
native. Neon Trees currently has a
song on the Billboard Pop Charts.
So does fun., Alex Clare, and Psy.
And perhaps more tellingly, pop
stars are responding to this
appetite. (Think: Britney Spears'
dubstep-sprinkled album.)
Today's pop stars have to be

weary of their newly worldly and
opinionated listeners. The greatest
cautionary tale is Lady Gaga's soph
omore album. Oblivious to or
disdainful of — the growth of
Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in
the early aughts, Gaga released an
album that essentially stylized glam
rock. Everyone bought "Born This
Way" for 99 cents and promptly
forgot about it.
The inattentive listener will
claim that the public's desire for
dance music and good times spurs
the mediocrity of a lot of pop
music, but the relationship between
pop and dance is hardly a new phe
nomenon. People have been danc
ing to pop since back when that
meant waltzing to Schubert (pre
dictably, lots of his contemporaries
hated on him).
It boils down to the fact that
listeners have genre-specific aes
thetic expectations: punk rock calls

for authenticity, funk calls for bass
lines. But pop, maybe due to the
sheer expansiveness of the genre, is
harder to pinpoint. Cecil Frena of
Born Gold provides some interest
ing perspective on the process of
creating pop music: "Making pop
music requires this particular kind
of confidence that is fascinating to
me it takes an almost irresponsi
ble self-assurance for a self-aware
person to be able to vocalize "ba da
ba" or stick to a conventional song
structure or whatever."
Pop stars begin their careers
with little credibility but lots of cul
tural capital. They can't expect to be
coddled like Pitchfork's handpicked
treasures. They can't afford preten
sion. Their songs have to be big,
infectious, catchy. This "ba da ba"
attitude leads to the Black Eyed

Peas' lobotomized "Boom Boom Pow" but also drives the
unpretentious genius of Stevie Wonder's "Livin' For The
City."
Pop artists can be smart and introspective, but they
always must have their audience in mind: an added chal
lenge that "real musicians" don't have to worry about. There
are plenty of talented pop stars today that are doing just
this. Robyn has specialized in heartbreak electro-pop, chan
neling romantic disappointments onto the dance floor with
hits like "Call Your Girlfriend" or "Dancing On My Own."
Adele's sincerity turned the meditative "21" into a bestseller,
and Beyonce's love-struck "4" is full of eargasms.
John Seabrook of the New Yorker asks in a piece about
Rihanna's songwriting team: "How did mainstream rock,
once the source of the catchiest hooks in popular music,
become robotic, unimaginative and predictable, while pop,
always the soul of artifice, came to seem creative, experi
mental and alive?"
Pop triumphed precisely because it is the soul of arti
fice. It's unassuming, self-aware, full of promises, eager to
please our music democracy's most honest politician.
