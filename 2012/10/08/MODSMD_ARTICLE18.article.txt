# SEX DIARIES: THE CARDINAL LETTER
## 
### 
I had only ever had sex with one person. I
was never in a rush to do the deed, and
after I started at age 18,1 quickly made up
for my dry years with my one sexual partner.
We escalated from a tender first time to rough
after-class quickies, and perhaps my greatest
moment of relief was when we decided to
ditch, in good faith, the condom; with it, he
would last sometimes upwards of two hours, a
pain that only those who have suffered will
understand. But this story isn't about my ex
boyfriend.
I'm pretty self-conscious about my body
and don't tend to let go of my inhibitions, so
showing my naked, vulnerable self to someone
else took a lot of getting to know each other. So
by the time I was halfway through Stanford
and newly single, I had still only had sex with
one person when I met Creepy Hot Guy.
Creepy Hot Guy (CHG) was, in a word,
sublime. Tall 6 feet 3 inches, to be exact (I
know because I asked) and slender, a swim
mer's build, CHG could have been out of
another time when men still smirked and wore
their hair elegantly, but without pomade. He
was older and I was young, and his hands were
large around my waist, his lips full, his coloring
consistent from his hair to his skin, like Jude
Law out of "The Talented Mr. Ripley." Striking
most of all though, were his eyes.
They were tiny and blue, tilted and always
meaning something. When he looked at me, I
felt sexy, wanted, powerful and violated at the
same time. It wasn't just me; other women in
my dorm commented on his charm, but
always eventually pointed out his icy glares and
his certainly ill intentions.
When CHG moved into my dorm, I had
already declared to myself my sexual freedom
and vowed to be more adventurous, sexually
and emotionally. It didn't take much for me to
fall hard. I saw him twice and decided I wanted

him. After I talked to him, I thought I might
even like him, too. His interests included a
manliest of sports something like soccer
and one so sensitive I was certain he was an
imposter something like morning medita
tions.
He went to a prestigious American prep
school, came from money and was party to a
group of men known not for their gentleman
ly ways a detail that enticed me even more.
And when he mentioned his favorite restau
rant, the same as mine, my heart almost
exploded out of my chest. He was too good to
be true!
Sadly, he actually was. It turns out his
most striking feature was not his eyes but his
reputation. After one dormmate tipped me off
to his record of being "really aggressive with
girls," I started to ask. I couldn't sleep that
night, so I hiked to my guy friend's room, to
inquire further.
Also party to CHG's band of men, my
friend informed me that CHG's reputation,
even within this rowdy group, was of a male
whose sexual audacity had earned bitter spirits
among the brothers. I asked others, without
mentioning any names, if there were particular
men at Stanford that I should know to stay
away from. CHG's name consistently dropped.
I should have stopped. I should have
known then and there that he was trouble. I
rationalized to myself: I believe in second
chances. I believe that people can change. I
know that people talk trash that's not always
true, for the sake of a story. But the truth is, it
turned me on more.
A mix of my sadistic fetish, pure sexual
frustration and pity for someone I convinced
myself was innocent or rehabilitated created
the perfect storm for what would be a total
submission. What started as an innocent inter
est turned to a truly burning sexual desire.

I finally posted an email to the dorm's list
serve with my phone number, in hopes it
would spark the flame. He took the bait and
texted me, made casual plans that I broke, after
which he mentioned that I should stop by his
room later. This invitation I could not deny.
By this time, I should mention, I realized
the entire dorm knew who he was and of his
past, so I was sure to keep our communication
discreet, for my own sake. I stopped by his
room and it didn't take long to make it
through the polite small talk before he was
shutting the door. Even now I want to tell you,
I don't usually do this. And I didn't; I had only
ever had sex with one person, and I wasn't very
good at it, to be honest. But CHG could pick
me up. And when he did, and more placed
than threw me on the bed, it was all I could do
to make him stop.
I had to know. And so I asked him. Did he
know what other people said about him?
"That I raped two girls?" he answered.
In all the nosy prodding I had done, no
one had ever used the word "rape." I was
instantly shocked, frightened and it pains
me now even to silently think turned on.
He denied it; meanwhile, I denied him
with my words, but clung to him with my
body. I still wanted him, maybe even more. I
knew it was wrong. I still know it's wrong. But
he was the most attractive guy I'd had the
opportunity to fuck.
He asked if I was scared now, and I
admitted that I felt scared, out loud.

est turned to a truly burning sexual desire.

I finally posted an email to the dorm's list
serve with my phone number, in hopes it
would spark the flame. He took the bait and
texted me, made casual plans that I broke, after
which he mentioned that I should stop by his
room later. This invitation I could not deny.
By this time, I should mention, I realized
the entire dorm knew who he was and of his
past, so I was sure to keep our communication
discreet, for my own sake. I stopped by his
room and it didn't take long to make it
through the polite small talk before he was
shutting the door. Even now I want to tell you,
I don't usually do this. And I didn't; I had only
ever had sex with one person, and I wasn't very
good at it, to be honest. But CHG could pick
me up. And when he did, and more placed
than threw me on the bed, it was all I could do
to make him stop.
I had to know. And so I asked him. Did he
know what other people said about him?
"That I raped two girls?" he answered.
In all the nosy prodding I had done, no
one had ever used the word "rape." I was
instantly shocked, frightened and it pains
me now even to silently think turned on.
He denied it; meanwhile, I denied him
with my words, but clung to him with my
body. I still wanted him, maybe even more. I
knew it was wrong. I still know it's wrong. But
he was the most attractive guy I'd had the
opportunity to fuck.
He asked if I was scared now, and I
admitted that I felt scared, out loud.
This is part one of the first sex diary. The story is
to be continued. This true account is told by a cur
rent Stanford student who identifies as a woman.
Details have been changed to protect the privacy of
those involved.
I had only ever had sex with one person. I
was never in a rush to do the deed, and
after I started at age 18,1 quickly made up
for my dry years with my one sexual partner.
We escalated from a tender first time to rough
after-class quickies, and perhaps my greatest
moment of relief was when we decided to
ditch, in good faith, the condom; with it, he
would last sometimes upwards of two hours, a
pain that only those who have suffered will
understand. But this story isn't about my ex
boyfriend.
I'm pretty self-conscious about my body
and don't tend to let go of my inhibitions, so
showing my naked, vulnerable self to someone
else took a lot of getting to know each other. So
by the time I was halfway through Stanford
and newly single, I had still only had sex with
one person when I met Creepy Hot Guy.
Creepy Hot Guy (CHG) was, in a word,
sublime. Tall 6 feet 3 inches, to be exact (I
know because I asked) and slender, a swim
mer's build, CHG could have been out of
another time when men still smirked and wore
their hair elegantly, but without pomade. He
was older and I was young, and his hands were
large around my waist, his lips full, his coloring
consistent from his hair to his skin, like Jude
Law out of "The Talented Mr. Ripley." Striking
most of all though, were his eyes.
They were tiny and blue, tilted and always
meaning something. When he looked at me, I
felt sexy, wanted, powerful and violated at the
same time. It wasn't just me; other women in
my dorm commented on his charm, but
always eventually pointed out his icy glares and
his certainly ill intentions.
When CHG moved into my dorm, I had
already declared to myself my sexual freedom
and vowed to be more adventurous, sexually
and emotionally. It didn't take much for me to
fall hard. I saw him twice and decided I wanted

him. After I talked to him, I thought I might
even like him, too. His interests included a
manliest of sports something like soccer
and one so sensitive I was certain he was an
imposter something like morning medita
tions.
He went to a prestigious American prep
school, came from money and was party to a
group of men known not for their gentleman
ly ways a detail that enticed me even more.
And when he mentioned his favorite restau
rant, the same as mine, my heart almost
exploded out of my chest. He was too good to
be true!
Sadly, he actually was. It turns out his
most striking feature was not his eyes but his
reputation. After one dormmate tipped me off
to his record of being "really aggressive with
girls," I started to ask. I couldn't sleep that
night, so I hiked to my guy friend's room, to
inquire further.
Also party to CHG's band of men, my
friend informed me that CHG's reputation,
even within this rowdy group, was of a male
whose sexual audacity had earned bitter spirits
among the brothers. I asked others, without
mentioning any names, if there were particular
men at Stanford that I should know to stay
away from. CHG's name consistently dropped.
I should have stopped. I should have
known then and there that he was trouble. I
rationalized to myself: I believe in second
chances. I believe that people can change. I
know that people talk trash that's not always
true, for the sake of a story. But the truth is, it
turned me on more.
A mix of my sadistic fetish, pure sexual
frustration and pity for someone I convinced
myself was innocent or rehabilitated created
the perfect storm for what would be a total
submission. What started as an innocent inter
est turned to a truly burning sexual desire.
