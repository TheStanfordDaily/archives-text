# 'HALCYON'
## NO SOPHOMORE SLUMP ELLIE GOULDING

After her successful debut
album "Lights," Ellie
Goulding is back again with
her sophomore effort "Halcyon."
Fans of Goulding will find that there
seems to be a more consistent theme
with this second album: the stages of
a breakup. While the chronology of
the album may not adhere to these
stages, there is a distinct difference
between the tones of the tracks
"Dead in the Water" {"l'm dead in
the water/still looking for yon") and
"Without Your Love" {"Withoutyour
love/I'm getting somewhere"). But,
given that preface, it's hardly a typical
breakup album.
What is most interesting about
"Halycon" is its variety of styles. After
listening to the whole album, it's quite
possible that you might be a little
confused; the tone ranges from soft
and sweet in such songs as "JOY" and
"Dead in the Water," to sounding like
it came straight from a '9os video
game, as in "1 Need Your Love," a col
laboration with Calvin Harris.
The album falls flat with a few
songs, including the Calvin Harris
collaborations "Figure 8" and
"Atlantis." These songs seem out of
place, mainly because they deviate so
starkly from the rest of the album.
But because collaborations with
Calvin Harris are en vogue right now,
it's unsurprising that "I Need Your
Love" has been almost completely
butchered with souped-up Mario

Kart-like sound effects.
As for "Atlantis," Goulding's voice
has been altered to a pitch high
enough that it sounds like a tank of
helium was sacrificed for the song.
"Figure 8" is the most tolerable of this
group, but starts out sounding like a
Britney Spears song from "00p5!... I
Did It Again" before alternating dis
cordantly between a softer sound and
a jarring techno beat.
Fortunately, the album has more
strengths than weaknesses. The darker
and quieter sound of some of the
songs, especially "I Know You Care"
and "Dead in the Water," contrast

nicely to most of Goulding's previous
work. With the rest of the album,
Goulding has blended her character
istic styling with several new ele
ments, including stronger vocals,
slower beats and mismatched music
and lyrics to create a more sophisti
cated sound.
Overall, "Halcyon" delivers.
Goulding has proven her worth in her
second album, and despite the few
songs that seem out of place, it has
been pieced together with a nice array
of styles to provide variety. I look for
ward to getting to know this album as
well as I got to know "Lights."
