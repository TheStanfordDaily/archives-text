# 6,500 alums visit Farm for Reunion
## Homecoming is earliest ever due to sparse 2012 home football schedule 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Over 9,000 people, including 6,500 alumni and
their guests, arrived on campus Thursday to cele
brate Reunion Homecoming. Stanford's largest
annual alumni event, Reunion Homecoming
debuted several new partnerships, including a new
focus on the arts at Stanford, despite unprecedent
ed logistical challenges.
"We plan Reunion 18 months in advance, and
we found out 10 days before [the event] that the
football game kick-off time had changed from five
to noon," said Leslie Winick, director of student
class outreach for the Stanford Alumni
Association. "So the big situation for us has been
being super nimble about changing literally [every
thing] ... we had a four-day event to event to event
program planned for 9,000 people, and suddenly 10
days ago we had to redo all the materials, update
9,000 attendees, [redo] e-mails, websites, every
thing."
The 116 th incarnation of Reunion
Homecoming since the founding of the Stanford
Alumni Association, Reunion 2012 marked the
beginning of a partnership with the Stanford
Institute for Creativity and the Arts (SiCa). Pop-up
art exhibits have appeared over the weekend at
Tresidder and Old Union, in addition to significant
emphasis on student arts on campus.
"We want to make the arts inescapable at
reunions," Winick said. "We've got student groups

performing for alums on Saturday night at the
CoHo, the Robber Barons [Stanford's sketch com
edy troupe] and the Stanford Improvisers are going
to perform for alums]... we want to show off the
new arts initiative."
The weekend's scheduling was complicated by
the football schedule, which sees Stanford play only
three home games while school is in session.
Tailgates and a football game are a critical part of
homecoming, so the Alumni Association was
forced to host Reunion this weekend the earli
est ever, according to Winick instead of at the
end of October.
"We hire 500 students," Winick said. "They had
just gotten here. It was stunningly tricky and yet
people pulled it off. Thank god for the registrar's
office helping us out, Event and Labor services, all
the behind-the-scenes folks that make the
University run."
Winick, a veteran of 16 reunion weekends, said

this year's logistics have been by far the hardest to
plan.
"Over 37 organizations and departments
throughout campus are collaborators on reunions,"
she said. "It really does take the entire Stanford
community to do reunions right."
The work is not all done on campus, however.
Volunteer alumni have to make phone calls, orga
nizational emails and event plans, all tailored to
each class before Homecoming weekend.
"We'll have well over 10,000 Stanford alumni
volunteering for their alma mater," president of the
Stanford Alumni Association Howard Wolf 'BO
said. "It's very well unparalleled. As I talk to people
who do what I do elsewhere in the country,
Stanford stands out as a role model for how to
engage volunteers."

Juju Chang 'B7, explored the
future of neuroscience and its
application to everyday life. In
addition, 65 faculty members
volunteered to host "Classes
Without Quizzes," hour-long
lectures on important issues of
the day. For Winick, the aca
demic focus at Reunion is what
makes Stanford's stand out.
"A lot of reunion programs
are tailgates," she said. "The
cool thing about Stanford is
that people come to see each
other, but then they get a
whole rich intellectual experi
ence."
For Patricia Hudson '72
M.B.A. '77, the academic pan
els and classes were a highlight
of the weekend, especially in

how they emphasized the
Stanford ethos of provoking
change in the world.
"I loved the [class] that
Nick Bloom did on economics
and [President Hennessey's]
panel on re-imagining educa
tion," she said. "Everybody
had the same message: 'We
take people who have the most
potential to make a difference
in the world, and we train them
to make that difference."'
Reunion Homecoming
aims to re-engage returning
alumni intellectually, but that
doesn't mean they don't tail
gate too. According to director
of ticket sales and services
Rich Muschell, alumni bought
approximately 4,000 tickets to
Saturday's matinee against
Arizona, a 54-48 Cardinal vic
tory.
But besides returning for
friends and football, alumni
come to see how their school
has changed sometimes

over several generations. Mary
Rintalla '32nwas the oldest
alumna on campus over the
weekend at 101 years old,
returning for her 80th reunion.
Some, like Hudson, raved
about how much the campus
has changed.
"The new Knight [Management
School] is unbelievable, beautiful
and very functional," she said.
"[lt's been] 50 years and
I've never enjoyed the campus
as much as I do right now. Just
the whole attitude and spirit of
the place, it has grown from my
day," said Jay Tunney '62.
But some praise was not
without reservation.
"There's a lot more grand
ness about the community...
we used to call it the Farm,"
Tunney said. "We don't call it
the Farm anymore. We call it
the corporation."
