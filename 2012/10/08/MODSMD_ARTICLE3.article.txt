## Global dorm hits third year Global citizenship theme dorm looks beyond the Farm 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The 2012-13 school year marks
the third year of the Global
Citizenship theme of Crothers
Memorial Hall, a program that has
grown sizably in its short lifespan.
The theme originally only took
up three-quarters of the first floor.
Now the program's core takes up the
first and second floors with 65 pre
assigned upperclassmen, four aca
demic theme associates (ATAs) and
the Crothers resident fellows,
Stephen Stedman '79 M.A. 'B5 Ph.D.
'BB and Corinne Thomas.
The Global Citizenship theme
was commissioned by the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies (FSI) and prepared by
Stedman and Thomas in time for the
theme's first year in 2010. Approval
by the faculty senate ensured it
would be a permanent fixture in
Crothers Memorial Hall.
For Stedman and Thomas, the
program's involvement of upper
classman drew them back after serv-
ing for six years as the resi
dent fellows in freshman
dorm Larkin and six years liv
ing off campus in Mountain
View.
"We wanted the opportu
nity to do this with upperclass
man students, who were going
to be more academically
focused," Stedman said. "And
the fact that they wanted to do
this dorm with an internation
al theme â€”we thought it
would be a lot of fun."
"My favorite thing about
Stanford is the late night con
versations we always have
especially the intellectual
ones," said Cyrus Pinto 'l3,
the head ATA for the Global
Citizenship theme and a par
ticipant in last year's theme.
"What drew me to the
theme was being able to have
those types of conversations
all the time and being in an
ecosystem that even goes a
step beyond and promotes
those conversations," he
added.
On Sept. 30, the students
of the Global Citizenship
theme attended a retreat at
which they shared their ideas
on how the year should pro
ceed and what programs they
would like to create.

"There are four ATAs; we
have a vision of what we'd like
to see," Pinto said. "But we
wanted to get feedback from
the students in the theme,
because at the end of the day
we want to tailor it to their
needs."
While this autumn's pro
gramming has been set for the
most part, Stedman noted that
he was looking forward to a
year of some exciting new
ideas.
One concept was a more
intensive version of Stanford's
Three Books program, in
which theme residents would
be offered optional reading
assignments that, when com
pleted, would allow them to
participate in an intimate dis
cussion with the authors.
The Global Citizenship
theme dorm is known for
hosting a broad variety of
speakers in the Crothers
Memorial lounge, holding
Sunday teas for theme resi
dents and maintaining a num
ber of Crothers Fellowships
with notable faculty members.
In addition to the pro
gramming arranged by resi
dent fellows, students in the
past have taught individually
designed seminars and hosted
their own speakers.
Some of the most notable
faculty who have participated
as Crothers Fellows include
David Abernethy, professor
emeritus of political science

and Jasmina Bojic, a lecturer
in international relations and
director of the Camera As
Witness program.
The Global Citizenship
theme also hosted anti-geno
cide activist John Prendergast
for an extended period of
time. In November 2010, actor
and activist George Clooney
joined Prendergast to speak
to students about genocide in
Sudan.
In addition to academic
programming, the Global
Citizenship theme became the
first themed house on campus
to have its own fellowship.
Crothers' Dalai Lama
Fellowship sponsors one stu
dent each year with $lO,OOO to
spend a summer anywhere in
the world, working on a proj
ect to uphold the goals of
"cross-cultural understand
ing, fighting inequality, dimin
ishing violence or promoting
environmental sustainability."
"The theme residents are
really diverse," Ritika Prasad
'l5, a resident of the Crothers
Memorial Global Citizenship
theme this year said.
"I came to Stanford want
ing to meet people who were
interested in the world
beyond the confines of an
academic institution and the
Global Citizenship theme has,
for me, been just that."
