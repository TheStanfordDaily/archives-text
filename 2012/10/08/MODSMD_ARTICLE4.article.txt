## First-gen issues gain exposure Socio-economic diversity not a prominent topic on campus 
### CARA REICHARD 
Stanford is a school that prides itself
on diversity, but according to Director of
the Office of Diversity and First-
Generation Programs, Tommy Lee
Woon, there is one issue of diversity that
is almost entirely ignored: socio-eco
nomic diversity.
"There is visible support here for stu
dents of different races, for women, for
students with disabilities, different reli
gious backgrounds, sexual orientations,"
Woon said. "The shadow population is
people from different socio-economic
backgrounds."
Nearly 15 percent of this year's
incoming freshman class associated with
the phrases "first-generation" or "low
income," but according to Woon, discus
sions of class issues are often viewed as
taboo.
"We as a society don't know how to
talk about socio-economic class," Assoc.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Sally
Dickson said.
Established in April 2011, the Office
of Diversity and First-Generation
Programs is a new addition to Stanford.
It is not, however, the first time the
University has made an effort to reach
out to low-income or first-generation
students.
According to Dickson, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions began to
notice a growing number of incoming
first-generation students seven years
ago.
"The Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education at that time
became cognizant of that and discussion
started to grow," Dickson said. "What
are their needs, and is Stanford really
providing the environment they need?"
A short while later, the issue was
thrust into greater prominence by a
Stanford undergraduate student,
Siobhan Greatorex-Voith 'OB,
who was working on an honor's
thesis on the experience of first
generation students at elite uni
versities.The administration took
notice and decided to hire her.
"She was the first person
hired whose responsibility was to
identify the needs of first-genera
tion and low-income students,"
Dickson said. "But Stanford
could not hire her the following
year because it was 2008 and
there was the economic down
turn."
In 2009, an anonymous
donor who had read about the
university's efforts in this area
approached Stanford with a gift
—which led to the founding of
the Office of Diversify and First-
Generation Programs.
Woon, who runs the office
almost entirely by himseli] said
one of its main goals is to create
an environment where everyone
—students, staff and faculty —
feels comfortable acknowledg
ing and discussing the socio-eco
nomic diversify that sun'ounds
them.
"There isn't obvious support
for discussion or community
building," he said. "We want to
systematically create support for
learning and engaging in conver
sation about socio-economic
diversity."
By encouraging discussion,

the office hopes to build a system
of support for students from the
whole spectrum of socio-eco
nomic backgrounds
"When students [who] come
from diverse socio-economic
backgrounds show up on cam
pus and go through their lives
here, there isn't obvious support
for them," Woon said. "And I'm
talking about everyone. People
who are poor can't see any evi
dence that there is anyone who
can understand where they've
come from. Some of the rich kids
feel like they can't admit they're
rich."
"What's been challenging is
that there are certain identities
one more readily accepts,"
Dickson said. "When it comes to
issues of class in this country, it's
much more complicated and
nuanced."
In its inaugural year, the
office focused on establishing
itself as a presence on campus.
"In our first year, we tried to
communicate that we exist, that
there is an abundance of support
here," Woon said.
They started last year off with
a welcome dinner, which
brought in about 135 students—
mostly freshmen. They also held
small group meetings, called
"chill-outs," once a month
throughout the year. In addition,
they organized a variety of con
versations to try and get students
and the rest of the Stanford
community —to start talking
about issues of class.
Along with its own pro
grams, the office is also focused

on establishing relationships with
other groups on campus.
"Behind the scenes, we tried
to create campus partnerships,
develop on-campus support for
students," Woon said. "We want
to develop a higher awareness
and capacity to support students.
This is a one and a half person
office —it's a lot of action with a
lot of partners."
The office's projects include
getting faculty members
involved to discuss class issues
and organizing an alumni men
torship program. But they also
lean heavily on other programs
on campus that could advance
their goals, like workshops, on
campus jobs or student efforts to
make life on campus more
affordable.
"They don't have to be our
programs, but we're probably
going to use them," Woon said.
Both Woon and Dickson
emphasized that the office is not
doing anything the students
aren't capable of doing for
themselves, but exists to estab
lish a system of support and to
help ease the transitions that stu
dents face when they come to
college.
"We're here just to provide
enrichment. We mostly just want
them to know that they're not
alone," Dickson said. "What
we're doing is engaging students,
faculty and staff to think about
how class affects their experi
ences"

They started last year off with
a welcome dinner, which
brought in about 135 students—
mostly freshmen. They also held
small group meetings, called
"chill-outs," once a month
throughout the year. In addition,
they organized a variety of con
versations to try and get students
and the rest of the Stanford
community —to start talking
about issues of class.
Along with its own pro
grams, the office is also focused

on establishing relationships with
other groups on campus.
"Behind the scenes, we tried
to create campus partnerships,
develop on-campus support for
students," Woon said. "We want
to develop a higher awareness
and capacity to support students.
This is a one and a half person
office —it's a lot of action with a
lot of partners."
The office's projects include
getting faculty members
involved to discuss class issues
and organizing an alumni men
torship program. But they also
lean heavily on other programs
on campus that could advance
their goals, like workshops, on
campus jobs or student efforts to
make life on campus more
affordable.
"They don't have to be our
programs, but we're probably
going to use them," Woon said.
Both Woon and Dickson
emphasized that the office is not
doing anything the students
aren't capable of doing for
themselves, but exists to estab
lish a system of support and to
help ease the transitions that stu
dents face when they come to
college.
"We're here just to provide
enrichment. We mostly just want
them to know that they're not
alone," Dickson said. "What
we're doing is engaging students,
faculty and staff to think about
how class affects their experi
ences"

Stanford is a school that prides itself
on diversity, but according to Director of
the Office of Diversity and First-
Generation Programs, Tommy Lee
Woon, there is one issue of diversity that
is almost entirely ignored: socio-eco
nomic diversity.
"There is visible support here for stu
dents of different races, for women, for
students with disabilities, different reli
gious backgrounds, sexual orientations,"
Woon said. "The shadow population is
people from different socio-economic
backgrounds."
Nearly 15 percent of this year's
incoming freshman class associated with
the phrases "first-generation" or "low
income," but according to Woon, discus
sions of class issues are often viewed as
taboo.
"We as a society don't know how to
talk about socio-economic class," Assoc.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Sally
Dickson said.
Established in April 2011, the Office
of Diversity and First-Generation
Programs is a new addition to Stanford.
It is not, however, the first time the
University has made an effort to reach
out to low-income or first-generation
students.
According to Dickson, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions began to
notice a growing number of incoming
first-generation students seven years
ago.
"The Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education at that time
became cognizant of that and discussion
started to grow," Dickson said. "What
are their needs, and is Stanford really
providing the environment they need?"
A short while later, the issue was
thrust into greater prominence by a
Stanford undergraduate student,
Siobhan Greatorex-Voith 'OB,
who was working on an honor's
thesis on the experience of first
generation students at elite uni
versities.The administration took
notice and decided to hire her.
"She was the first person
hired whose responsibility was to
identify the needs of first-genera
tion and low-income students,"
Dickson said. "But Stanford
could not hire her the following
year because it was 2008 and
there was the economic down
turn."
In 2009, an anonymous
donor who had read about the
university's efforts in this area
approached Stanford with a gift
—which led to the founding of
the Office of Diversify and First-
Generation Programs.
Woon, who runs the office
almost entirely by himseli] said
one of its main goals is to create
an environment where everyone
—students, staff and faculty —
feels comfortable acknowledg
ing and discussing the socio-eco
nomic diversify that sun'ounds
them.
"There isn't obvious support
for discussion or community
building," he said. "We want to
systematically create support for
learning and engaging in conver
sation about socio-economic
diversity."
By encouraging discussion,

the office hopes to build a system
of support for students from the
whole spectrum of socio-eco
nomic backgrounds
"When students [who] come
from diverse socio-economic
backgrounds show up on cam
pus and go through their lives
here, there isn't obvious support
for them," Woon said. "And I'm
talking about everyone. People
who are poor can't see any evi
dence that there is anyone who
can understand where they've
come from. Some of the rich kids
feel like they can't admit they're
rich."
"What's been challenging is
that there are certain identities
one more readily accepts,"
Dickson said. "When it comes to
issues of class in this country, it's
much more complicated and
nuanced."
In its inaugural year, the
office focused on establishing
itself as a presence on campus.
"In our first year, we tried to
communicate that we exist, that
there is an abundance of support
here," Woon said.
They started last year off with

brought in about 135 students—
