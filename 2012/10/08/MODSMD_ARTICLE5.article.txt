# WORKING OVERTIME
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
All of the questions surrounding
Stanford football last week involved
the possibility of a quarterback
change occurring. Based on what
happened on Saturday afternoon,
one thing's for sure: a quarterback
change certainly won't be coming
this week.
Down by 14 points midway
through the fourth quarter, No. 17
Stanford (4-1,2-1 Pac-12) rallied on
two consecutive touchdown-scoring
drives to tie up the game and then
capitalized off Chase Thomas' inter

ception in overtime to complete a
thrilling 54-48 comeback victory
over Arizona (3-3,0-3).

Quarterback Josh Nunes was
undoubtedly the catalyst for the
Cardinal's late-game heroics, finish
ing the best game of his career with
21-of-34 passing, 360 passing yards
and five total touchdowns. The red
shirt junior also continued to display
his unexpected nimbleness, as three

of his five touchdowns came on
designed option keepers inside the
5-yard line.
"It's not what we learned," head
coach David Shaw said. "It's maybe
that other people learned [Nunes is]
a tough kid. He bounces back, he
doesn't listen to the noise and he's
steady."
After failing to score a single
touchdown against Washington, the
Stanford offense had no problem
with finding the end zone on
Saturday six trips to the red zone
resulted in just as many touchdowns.
By the time the second half was
underway, the Cardinal showed no

shortage of offensive explosion.
But neither did Arizona.
Rich Rodriguez's high-speed
offense was as dangerously efficient
as advertised. Redshirt senior quar
terback Matt Scott broke a Pac-12
record with 45 completions and
gashed the Cardinal defense for 491
yards through the air, the third most
that Stanford has ever allowed. The
sheer numbers of 103 total plays and
38 first downs showed how success
ful the Wildcats were at wearing
down a gassed front seven and a
banged-up secondary.

Running back Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) breaks through the defense for the game-winning score in overtime against Arizona Saturday.
Taylor ran for 142 yards and two scores, but quarterback Josh Nunes' (6) career day put Stanford over the top in the 54-48 win.
On an afternoon that saw each
team rack up 617 yards of total
offense, the defenses increasingly
became a non-factor as the game
progressed seven of the last nine
drives in regulation resulted in
touchdowns.
"Great game by the
offense," said defensive end
Henry Anderson. "They car
ried us pretty much the whole
game. We gave up way too
many yards."
Compared to the ensuing
offensive shootout in the sec
ond half, the first two quarters
were relatively tame. The
Cardinal wasted no time in
putting up the first points on
the board when Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz in the
right corner of the end zone
for an 11-yard touchdown on
the first drive of the game.
Neither team scored for
the remainder of the first
quarter Scott was sacked
on back-to-back plays at one
point while the Arizona man
aged to sniff out Nunes' inef
fective screen passes to
Stepfan Taylor.
The Wildcats then showed
a glimpse of what was to come
on their opening drive of the
second quarter. Using the no
huddle, Scott completed seven
passes before sophomore run
ning back Ka'Deem Carey
scored from 13 yards out to tie
the game at seven, capping a
12-play, 81-yard drive that
took less than three minutes.
After a three-and-out from
Stanford, Scott marched his
offense 64 yards into the red
zone, where outside line
backer Trent Murphy and free
safety Ed Reynolds broke up

a couple passes to hold the
Wildcats to a field goal.
The Cardinal emphatically
answered on its next drive, in
which Nunes found a wide
open Levine Toilolo for a 46-
yard gain before the pair
hooked up once again two
plays later on a 12-yard touch
down that gave Stanford a 14-
10 lead. Following Ertz's dom
inant performance last week,
it was Toilolo who starred on
Saturday afternoon, amassing
141 receiving yards a career
high and a touchdown on
just five catches.
"I definitely have confi
dence now," Nunes said. "The
guys up front did what they
needed to do as well as the
guys downfield. I used last
week as a stepping-stone
going forward; I made a lot of
throws that I didn't make last
week. I applied a few things I
was working on in practice
mainly ball position and veloc
ity. I think that helped out a lot
today."
Kicker John Bonano's 33-
yard field goal sailed through
the uprights with 15 seconds
left in the first half, cutting the
Cardinal's lead 14-13 as the
players headed into the locker
rooms.
Any possibility of the
game turning into a defensive
struggle was all but erased
when both teams went on a
scoring flurry in the third
quarter. The Arizona offense
opened up first when Carey,
who had a breakout perform
ance of 132 rushing yards and
three touchdowns, scored on a
1-yard run.
Not to be outdone,

Stanford responded with a
touchdown of its own as
Nunes found the dependable
Toilolo for a 42-yard gain
before running the ball in him
self for a 2-yard score.
"[Nunes] kept us poised
and drove us downfield," said
Taylor.
Both teams would go on to
reach the end zone two more
times before the third quarter
expired. Austin Hill hauled in
two touchdown receptions for
Arizona while Taylor and
Kelsey Young rushed for
touchdowns to pace
Stanford's scoring. With 15
minutes left to play, the
Cardinal was trying to hang on
to a 34-33 lead.
The first five minutes of
the fourth quarter proved to
be disastrous for the
Cardinal. Carey rushed for
his third touchdown of the
afternoon and Scott took
advantage of a three-and-out
from Stanford by finding
Terrence Miller for a 10-yard
touchdown. Just like that, the
Wildcats were up 48-34 with
6:34 left in the game.
But not even a two-touch
down deficit could faze a calm
and collected Nunes, who
methodically marched the
Cardinal down to the Arizona
20-yard line on the next pos
session. After throwing a cou
ple incompletions, Nunes
delivered a perfect ball to
Toilolo, a 19-yard catch that
successfully converted a criti
cal fourth-and-two, and then
scored on a 1-yard quarter
back keeper.
After yielding three touch
downs in its last three show

ings, it was the Stanford
defense that came up big next,
ft seemed inevitable that the
Arizona offense would once
again score with ease and put
the game out of reach for
good, but it sputtered with a
three-and-out in the face of
heavy pressure from Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner.
"We didn't start blaming
each other or point fingers,"
said Thomas. "We knew what
we had to fix. It's huge to show
that we can face adversity and
overcome it."
Working from the Cardinal's
own 21-yard line and needing a
touchdown to tie the game,
Nunes came through as Mr.
Clutch one last time, including a
thrifty 16-yard scramble on
third-and-seven that faked out
two Wildcat defenders. On
fourth-and-nine at the Arizona
20, Nunes fired a 17-yard bullet
to Ertz for the conversion and
then completed the comeback
with his third rushing touch
down.
"If you had told me a year
ago we'd call multiple run
plays for [Nunes], I'd have
laughed at you," Shaw said.
With Stanford carrying all
of the momentum into over
time, the Arizona offense
erred at the worst possible
moment. On third-and-ten,
Scott's pass was first tipped by
defensive end Henry Anderson
and then intercepted by a leap
ing Chase Thomas.
"I was trying to tip the ball
all game," Anderson said. "I

just had to push the pocket
back as far as I could. I saw
him cock his wrist up and
jumped up, and I think my hel
met hit the ball."
A field goal would have suf
ficed in giving the Cardinal the
victory, but Taylor didn't leave
things to chance and ran it in on
second-and-six for the game
winning 21-yard touchdown.

"We needed to play 60
minutes, more than 60 min
utes," Shaw said. "And we
never, ever stopped fighting."
Next up for the Cardinal is
a trip to South Bend, Ind.,
where it will square off against
No. 7 Notre Dame on Oct. 13.

5-yard line.
"It's not what we learned," head
coach David Shaw said. "It's maybe
that other people learned [Nunes is]
a tough kid. He bounces back, he
doesn't listen to the noise and he's
steady."
After failing to score a single
touchdown against Washington, the
Stanford offense had no problem
with finding the end zone on
Saturday six trips to the red zone
resulted in just as many touchdowns.
By the time the second half was
underway, the Cardinal showed no

shortage of offensive explosion.
But neither did Arizona.
Rich Rodriguez's high-speed
offense was as dangerously efficient
as advertised. Redshirt senior quar
terback Matt Scott broke a Pac-12
record with 45 completions and
gashed the Cardinal defense for 491
yards through the air, the third most
that Stanford has ever allowed. The
sheer numbers of 103 total plays and
38 first downs showed how success
ful the Wildcats were at wearing
down a gassed front seven and a
banged-up secondary.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Running back Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) breaks through the defense for the game-winning score in overtime against Arizona Saturday.
Taylor ran for 142 yards and two scores, but quarterback Josh Nunes' (6) career day put Stanford over the top in the 54-48 win.
On an afternoon that saw each
team rack up 617 yards of total
offense, the defenses increasingly
became a non-factor as the game
progressed seven of the last nine
drives in regulation resulted in
touchdowns.
"Great game by the
offense," said defensive end
Henry Anderson. "They car
ried us pretty much the whole
game. We gave up way too
many yards."
Compared to the ensuing
offensive shootout in the sec
ond half, the first two quarters
were relatively tame. The
Cardinal wasted no time in
putting up the first points on
the board when Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz in the
right corner of the end zone
for an 11-yard touchdown on
the first drive of the game.
Neither team scored for
the remainder of the first
quarter Scott was sacked
on back-to-back plays at one
point while the Arizona man
aged to sniff out Nunes' inef
fective screen passes to
Stepfan Taylor.
The Wildcats then showed
a glimpse of what was to come
on their opening drive of the
second quarter. Using the no
huddle, Scott completed seven
passes before sophomore run
ning back Ka'Deem Carey
scored from 13 yards out to tie
the game at seven, capping a
12-play, 81-yard drive that
took less than three minutes.
After a three-and-out from
Stanford, Scott marched his
offense 64 yards into the red
zone, where outside line
backer Trent Murphy and free
safety Ed Reynolds broke up

a couple passes to hold the
Wildcats to a field goal.
The Cardinal emphatically
answered on its next drive, in
which Nunes found a wide
open Levine Toilolo for a 46-
yard gain before the pair
hooked up once again two
plays later on a 12-yard touch
down that gave Stanford a 14-
10 lead. Following Ertz's dom
inant performance last week,
it was Toilolo who starred on
Saturday afternoon, amassing
141 receiving yards a career
high and a touchdown on
just five catches.
"I definitely have confi
dence now," Nunes said. "The
guys up front did what they
needed to do as well as the
guys downfield. I used last
week as a stepping-stone
going forward; I made a lot of
throws that I didn't make last
week. I applied a few things I
was working on in practice
mainly ball position and veloc
ity. I think that helped out a lot
today."
Kicker John Bonano's 33-
yard field goal sailed through
the uprights with 15 seconds
left in the first half, cutting the
Cardinal's lead 14-13 as the
players headed into the locker
rooms.
Any possibility of the
game turning into a defensive
struggle was all but erased
when both teams went on a
scoring flurry in the third
quarter. The Arizona offense
opened up first when Carey,
who had a breakout perform
ance of 132 rushing yards and
three touchdowns, scored on a
1-yard run.
Not to be outdone,

Stanford responded with a
touchdown of its own as
Nunes found the dependable
Toilolo for a 42-yard gain
before running the ball in him
self for a 2-yard score.
"[Nunes] kept us poised
and drove us downfield," said
Taylor.
Both teams would go on to
reach the end zone two more
times before the third quarter
expired. Austin Hill hauled in
two touchdown receptions for
Arizona while Taylor and
Kelsey Young rushed for
touchdowns to pace
Stanford's scoring. With 15
minutes left to play, the
Cardinal was trying to hang on
to a 34-33 lead.
The first five minutes of
the fourth quarter proved to
be disastrous for the
Cardinal. Carey rushed for
his third touchdown of the
afternoon and Scott took
advantage of a three-and-out
from Stanford by finding
Terrence Miller for a 10-yard
touchdown. Just like that, the
Wildcats were up 48-34 with
6:34 left in the game.
But not even a two-touch
down deficit could faze a calm
and collected Nunes, who
methodically marched the
Cardinal down to the Arizona
20-yard line on the next pos
session. After throwing a cou
ple incompletions, Nunes
delivered a perfect ball to
Toilolo, a 19-yard catch that
successfully converted a criti
cal fourth-and-two, and then
scored on a 1-yard quarter
back keeper.
After yielding three touch
downs in its last three show

ings, it was the Stanford
defense that came up big next,
ft seemed inevitable that the
Arizona offense would once
again score with ease and put
the game out of reach for
good, but it sputtered with a
three-and-out in the face of
heavy pressure from Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner.
"We didn't start blaming
each other or point fingers,"
said Thomas. "We knew what
we had to fix. It's huge to show
that we can face adversity and
overcome it."
Working from the Cardinal's
own 21-yard line and needing a
touchdown to tie the game,
Nunes came through as Mr.
Clutch one last time, including a
thrifty 16-yard scramble on
third-and-seven that faked out
two Wildcat defenders. On
fourth-and-nine at the Arizona
20, Nunes fired a 17-yard bullet
to Ertz for the conversion and
then completed the comeback
with his third rushing touch
down.
"If you had told me a year
ago we'd call multiple run
plays for [Nunes], I'd have
laughed at you," Shaw said.
With Stanford carrying all
of the momentum into over
time, the Arizona offense
erred at the worst possible
moment. On third-and-ten,
Scott's pass was first tipped by
defensive end Henry Anderson
and then intercepted by a leap
ing Chase Thomas.
"I was trying to tip the ball
all game," Anderson said. "I

just had to push the pocket
back as far as I could. I saw
him cock his wrist up and
jumped up, and I think my hel
met hit the ball."
A field goal would have suf
ficed in giving the Cardinal the
victory, but Taylor didn't leave
things to chance and ran it in on
second-and-six for the game
winning 21-yard touchdown.

"We needed to play 60
minutes, more than 60 min
utes," Shaw said. "And we
never, ever stopped fighting."
Next up for the Cardinal is
a trip to South Bend, Ind.,
where it will square off against
No. 7 Notre Dame on Oct. 13.

Running back Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) breaks through the defense for the game-winning score in overtime against Arizona Saturday.
Taylor ran for 142 yards and two scores, but quarterback Josh Nunes' (6) career day put Stanford over the top in the 54-48 win.
On an afternoon that saw each
team rack up 617 yards of total
offense, the defenses increasingly
became a non-factor as the game
progressed seven of the last nine
drives in regulation resulted in
touchdowns.
"Great game by the
offense," said defensive end
Henry Anderson. "They car
ried us pretty much the whole
game. We gave up way too
many yards."
Compared to the ensuing
offensive shootout in the sec
ond half, the first two quarters
were relatively tame. The
Cardinal wasted no time in
putting up the first points on
the board when Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz in the
right corner of the end zone
for an 11-yard touchdown on
the first drive of the game.
Neither team scored for
the remainder of the first
quarter Scott was sacked
on back-to-back plays at one
point while the Arizona man
aged to sniff out Nunes' inef
fective screen passes to
Stepfan Taylor.
The Wildcats then showed
a glimpse of what was to come
on their opening drive of the
second quarter. Using the no
huddle, Scott completed seven
passes before sophomore run
ning back Ka'Deem Carey
scored from 13 yards out to tie
the game at seven, capping a
12-play, 81-yard drive that
took less than three minutes.
After a three-and-out from
Stanford, Scott marched his
offense 64 yards into the red
zone, where outside line
backer Trent Murphy and free
safety Ed Reynolds broke up

a couple passes to hold the
Wildcats to a field goal.
The Cardinal emphatically
answered on its next drive, in
which Nunes found a wide
open Levine Toilolo for a 46-
yard gain before the pair
hooked up once again two
plays later on a 12-yard touch
down that gave Stanford a 14-
10 lead. Following Ertz's dom
inant performance last week,
it was Toilolo who starred on
Saturday afternoon, amassing
141 receiving yards a career
high and a touchdown on
just five catches.
"I definitely have confi
dence now," Nunes said. "The
guys up front did what they
needed to do as well as the
guys downfield. I used last
week as a stepping-stone
going forward; I made a lot of
throws that I didn't make last
week. I applied a few things I
was working on in practice
mainly ball position and veloc
ity. I think that helped out a lot
today."
Kicker John Bonano's 33-
yard field goal sailed through
the uprights with 15 seconds
left in the first half, cutting the
Cardinal's lead 14-13 as the
players headed into the locker
rooms.
Any possibility of the
game turning into a defensive
struggle was all but erased
when both teams went on a
scoring flurry in the third
quarter. The Arizona offense
opened up first when Carey,
who had a breakout perform
ance of 132 rushing yards and
three touchdowns, scored on a
1-yard run.
Not to be outdone,

Stanford responded with a
touchdown of its own as
Nunes found the dependable
Toilolo for a 42-yard gain
before running the ball in him
self for a 2-yard score.
"[Nunes] kept us poised
and drove us downfield," said
Taylor.
Both teams would go on to
reach the end zone two more
times before the third quarter
expired. Austin Hill hauled in
two touchdown receptions for
Arizona while Taylor and
Kelsey Young rushed for
touchdowns to pace
Stanford's scoring. With 15
minutes left to play, the
Cardinal was trying to hang on
to a 34-33 lead.
The first five minutes of
the fourth quarter proved to
be disastrous for the
Cardinal. Carey rushed for
his third touchdown of the
afternoon and Scott took
advantage of a three-and-out
from Stanford by finding
Terrence Miller for a 10-yard
touchdown. Just like that, the
Wildcats were up 48-34 with
6:34 left in the game.
But not even a two-touch
down deficit could faze a calm
and collected Nunes, who
methodically marched the
Cardinal down to the Arizona
20-yard line on the next pos
session. After throwing a cou
ple incompletions, Nunes
delivered a perfect ball to
Toilolo, a 19-yard catch that
successfully converted a criti
cal fourth-and-two, and then
scored on a 1-yard quarter
back keeper.
After yielding three touch
downs in its last three show

ings, it was the Stanford
defense that came up big next,
ft seemed inevitable that the
Arizona offense would once
again score with ease and put
the game out of reach for
good, but it sputtered with a
three-and-out in the face of
heavy pressure from Shayne
Skov and Ben Gardner.
"We didn't start blaming
each other or point fingers,"
said Thomas. "We knew what
we had to fix. It's huge to show
that we can face adversity and
overcome it."
Working from the Cardinal's
own 21-yard line and needing a
touchdown to tie the game,
Nunes came through as Mr.
Clutch one last time, including a
thrifty 16-yard scramble on
third-and-seven that faked out
two Wildcat defenders. On
fourth-and-nine at the Arizona
20, Nunes fired a 17-yard bullet
to Ertz for the conversion and
then completed the comeback
with his third rushing touch
down.
"If you had told me a year
ago we'd call multiple run
plays for [Nunes], I'd have
laughed at you," Shaw said.
With Stanford carrying all
of the momentum into over
time, the Arizona offense
erred at the worst possible
moment. On third-and-ten,
Scott's pass was first tipped by
defensive end Henry Anderson
and then intercepted by a leap
ing Chase Thomas.
"I was trying to tip the ball
all game," Anderson said. "I

just had to push the pocket
back as far as I could. I saw
him cock his wrist up and
jumped up, and I think my hel
met hit the ball."
A field goal would have suf
ficed in giving the Cardinal the
victory, but Taylor didn't leave
things to chance and ran it in on
second-and-six for the game
winning 21-yard touchdown.

"We needed to play 60
minutes, more than 60 min
utes," Shaw said. "And we
never, ever stopped fighting."
Next up for the Cardinal is
a trip to South Bend, Ind.,
where it will square off against
No. 7 Notre Dame on Oct. 13.

Fans celebrate Stanford's Levine Toilolo's (11) touchdown in the second quarter against
the University of Arizona at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, California, Saturday, Oct. 6.
Stanford defeated Arizona in overtime, 54-48.
All of the questions surrounding
Stanford football last week involved
the possibility of a quarterback
change occurring. Based on what
happened on Saturday afternoon,
one thing's for sure: a quarterback
change certainly won't be coming
this week.
Down by 14 points midway
through the fourth quarter, No. 17
Stanford (4-1,2-1 Pac-12) rallied on
two consecutive touchdown-scoring
drives to tie up the game and then
capitalized off Chase Thomas' inter

ception in overtime to complete a
thrilling 54-48 comeback victory
over Arizona (3-3,0-3).

Quarterback Josh Nunes was
undoubtedly the catalyst for the
Cardinal's late-game heroics, finish
ing the best game of his career with
21-of-34 passing, 360 passing yards
and five total touchdowns. The red
shirt junior also continued to display
his unexpected nimbleness, as three

of his five touchdowns came on
designed option keepers inside the
5-yard line.
"It's not what we learned," head
coach David Shaw said. "It's maybe
that other people learned [Nunes is]
a tough kid. He bounces back, he
doesn't listen to the noise and he's
steady."
After failing to score a single
touchdown against Washington, the
Stanford offense had no problem
with finding the end zone on
Saturday six trips to the red zone
resulted in just as many touchdowns.
By the time the second half was
underway, the Cardinal showed no

shortage of offensive explosion.
But neither did Arizona.
Rich Rodriguez's high-speed
offense was as dangerously efficient
as advertised. Redshirt senior quar
terback Matt Scott broke a Pac-12
record with 45 completions and
gashed the Cardinal defense for 491
yards through the air, the third most
that Stanford has ever allowed. The
sheer numbers of 103 total plays and
38 first downs showed how success
ful the Wildcats were at wearing
down a gassed front seven and a
banged-up secondary.
