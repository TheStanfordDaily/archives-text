# WORKING OVERTIME

### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
All of the questions surrounding
Stanford football last week involved
the possibility of a quarterback
change occurring. Based on what
happened on Saturday afternoon,
one thing's for sure: a quarterback
change certainly won't be coming
this week.
Down by 14 points midway
through the fourth quarter, No. 17
Stanford (4-1,2-1 Pac-12) rallied on
two consecutive touchdown-scoring
drives to tie up the game and then
capitalized off Chase Thomas' inter

ception in overtime to complete a
thrilling 54-48 comeback victory
over Arizona (3-3,0-3).

Quarterback Josh Nunes was
undoubtedly the catalyst for the
Cardinal's late-game heroics, finish
ing the best game of his career with
21-of-34 passing, 360 passing yards
and five total touchdowns. The red
shirt junior also continued to display
his unexpected nimbleness, as three

of his five touchdowns came on
designed option keepers inside the
5-yard line.
"It's not what we learned," head
coach David Shaw said. "It's maybe
that other people learned [Nunes is]
a tough kid. He bounces back, he
doesn't listen to the noise and he's
steady."
After failing to score a single
touchdown against Washington, the
Stanford offense had no problem
with finding the end zone on
Saturday six trips to the red zone
resulted in just as many touchdowns.
By the time the second half was
underway, the Cardinal showed no

shortage of offensive explosion.
But neither did Arizona.
Rich Rodriguez's high-speed
offense was as dangerously efficient
as advertised. Redshirt senior quar
terback Matt Scott broke a Pac-12
record with 45 completions and
gashed the Cardinal defense for 491
yards through the air, the third most
that Stanford has ever allowed. The
sheer numbers of 103 total plays and
38 first downs showed how success
ful the Wildcats were at wearing
down a gassed front seven and a
banged-up secondary.

Running back Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) breaks through the defense for the game-winning score in overtime against Arizona Saturday.
Taylor ran for 142 yards and two scores, but quarterback Josh Nunes' (6) career day put Stanford over the top in the 54-48 win.
