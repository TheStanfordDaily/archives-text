## A 						history of Stanford abroad 
### â€“ Marianne LeVine 
The first round of applications to
Stanford's Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP) Spring
2013 programs will close next
Sunday, Oct. 14. BOSP currently
has 11 locations Australia, Beijing, Berlin,
Cape Town, Florence, Kyoto, Madrid,
Moscow, Oxford, Paris and Santiago. The
Daily took a look at the long-term study
abroad program's evolution.
On Sept. 25,1957, The Daily reported that
University President Wallace Sterling
announced the University was nearing plans
for completing the Stanford Study Center in
Beutelbasch, Germany. The center would be
located 12 miles from Stuttgart. President
Sterling hoped that the program would be "self
sustaining" and would provide grants to stu
dents so that it would not be limited to wealthy
students. The program was in part funded by a
$15,000 grant from the Fund for the
Advancement of Education ("Stanford to
Establish Branch in Germany," Sept. 25,1957).
A year later, 63 Stanford students partic
ipated in the Stanford in Germany program.
A total of 33 men and 30 women left San
Francisco International Airport on June 16,
1958 to spend six months abroad. The pro
gram ended around Christmas time. The
University held an opening ceremony, one of
the highlights of which was "the planting of a
sequoia tree, a further link between the
Farm and its German counterpart." During
the ceremony Sterling stated that he
believed the Beutelbasch Center would be
"extending the educational opportunities of
American youth in accord with the intent of
Mr. and Mrs. Stanford" ("Sterling Praises
Center," Sept. 26,1958).

In 1960, Stanford's Overseas Program
was extended to Italy and France. The Daily
reported that "student bodies of 80 each
[would spend] six months in intensive lan
guage training with emphasis on cultural
studies such as history, economics, literature,
political science, music and art." While the
school's original Stanford in Italy program
was located in Florence, the Stanford in
France program was initially established in
Tours. The article stated that the University
added two new branches to the Stanford in

Germany program and was considering a
campus in Hong Kong ("Students Begin
Classes at Overseas Centers," Oct. 4,1960).
In 1965, Stanford established a program in
Vienna. A year later, a campus in Great Britain
near Grantham in Lincolnshire was added.
In 1972, however, the Stanford Overseas
program made changes. Talks of closing the
Vienna campus began, due to the program's
low enrollment. After only 28 students
enrolled in the program, Robert Walker,
director of the Overseas Program, told The
Daily, "it's impossible to run the type of
broad program we have with those num
bers" ("Future of Vienna Campus in
Doubt," Sept. 27,1972).
In Jan. 1973, Walker resigned after a
report from the Presidential Commission
indicated a lack of satisfaction with the
Program. Law Professor John H. Merryman
stated "the foreign studies programs that
were designed for and were successful in an
earlier period at Stanford now [seemed]
unsatisfactory." The Daily reported that
"The Commission's report... declared that
the basic objective of the foreign studies pro
grams remainfed] valid but warned that the
programs [faced] declining student interest."
The report suggested that the academic pro
gram should be more flexible and focus
more on the culture of the host country. In
addition, the Commission recommended
that the three-day weekend at all overseas
programs be abolished ("Overseas Director
Quits Post; Panel urges program changes,"
Jan. 24,1973.
In 2005, the Overseas Studies program
received $25 million from the Bing family
and was renamed the Bing Overseas Studies
Program. Talks of establishing a campus in
Spain began ("Overseas studies renamed,
expanded," Oct. 14,2005).
The latest additions to BOSP have been
programs in Madrid in 2008 and Cape Town
in 2010. The most recent changes to the pro
gram include expanding the Kyoto program
to winter quarter and moving the Stanford
in Florence program to the Palazzo
Capponi.

France program was initially established in
Tours. The article stated that the University
added two new branches to the Stanford in

Germany program and was considering a
campus in Hong Kong ("Students Begin
Classes at Overseas Centers," Oct. 4,1960).
In 1965, Stanford established a program in
Vienna. A year later, a campus in Great Britain
near Grantham in Lincolnshire was added.
In 1972, however, the Stanford Overseas
program made changes. Talks of closing the
Vienna campus began, due to the program's
low enrollment. After only 28 students
enrolled in the program, Robert Walker,
director of the Overseas Program, told The
Daily, "it's impossible to run the type of
broad program we have with those num
bers" ("Future of Vienna Campus in
Doubt," Sept. 27,1972).
In Jan. 1973, Walker resigned after a
report from the Presidential Commission
indicated a lack of satisfaction with the
Program. Law Professor John H. Merryman
stated "the foreign studies programs that
were designed for and were successful in an
earlier period at Stanford now [seemed]
unsatisfactory." The Daily reported that
"The Commission's report... declared that
the basic objective of the foreign studies pro
grams remainfed] valid but warned that the
programs [faced] declining student interest."
The report suggested that the academic pro
gram should be more flexible and focus
more on the culture of the host country. In
addition, the Commission recommended
that the three-day weekend at all overseas
programs be abolished ("Overseas Director
Quits Post; Panel urges program changes,"
Jan. 24,1973.
In 2005, the Overseas Studies program
received $25 million from the Bing family
and was renamed the Bing Overseas Studies
Program. Talks of establishing a campus in
Spain began ("Overseas studies renamed,
expanded," Oct. 14,2005).
The latest additions to BOSP have been
programs in Madrid in 2008 and Cape Town
in 2010. The most recent changes to the pro
gram include expanding the Kyoto program
to winter quarter and moving the Stanford
in Florence program to the Palazzo
Capponi.
