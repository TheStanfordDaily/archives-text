## University objects to 'No on 37' ad implying Stanford endorsement 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
Stanford University legal
counsel requested that the
"No on 37" campaign change
a television spot that used a
background of Stanford's
campus and misidentified the
nature of the speaker's affilia
tion to the University, by
wrongly suggesting that the
University had endorsed the
message.
University spokeswoman
Lisa Lapin stated that
Stanford does not allow polit
ical filming to take place on
campus. It also does not take
positions on ballot measures.
Proposition 37 would
require food producers to
label whether or not certain
products contain or could
contain genetically engi
neered ingredients from
plants or animals.
The ad, which started air
ing on Oct. 2, features Hoover
research fellow and founding
director of the Federal Drug
Administration's (FDA)
Office of Technology Henry
Miller. The Hoover Institution
is an independent think tank
located on the Stanford cam
pus.
In the original version,
Miller was identified as a "Dr.
Henry I. Miller M.D., Stanford
University, founding dir. FDA
Office of Technology." The title
card now identifies Miller as
"Henry I. Miller, M.D. Fellow,
Hoover Institution, Stanford

University*; Founding Dir.,
FDA Office of Biotechnology."
Lower on the title card, the
asterisk notes that the title
"Fellow, Hoover Institution,
Stanford University" is being
used "for identification purpos
es only."
In the original ad, which
can no longer be found online,
Miller was standing in an
"ornately vaulted campus
walkway," according to the
Los Angeles Times. The ad
now shows Miller seated
against a backdrop of an
unidentifiable building.
"While everyone at
Stanford is entitled to espouse
whatever political view he or
she may choose, we do not
allow people affiliated with
Stanford to take a political
position in away that could
imply that it is Stanford's posi
tion," University Vice President
and General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt said to the San
Francisco Chronicle.
