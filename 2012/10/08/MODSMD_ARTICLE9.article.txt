# Stanford team finds that UV rays weaken connective skin material
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
Researchers in the
Materials Science and
Engineering (MatSci) depart
ment examined the effects of
ultraviolet (UV) rays on skin
cells and found that the rays
loosen bonds between neigh
boring skin cells, causing the
skin to become more brittle.
The researchers, led by

MatSci Assoc. Chair Reinhold
Dauskardt, doctoral student
Krysta Biniek and postdoctoral
researcher Kemal Levi, concen
trated their attention on the
stratum corneum the outer
most layer of the skin and
how UVB radiation affects
those skin cells. UVB rays are
the type of UV rays that most
frequently cause sunburns and
skin cancer.
Dauskardt's team was ini
tially interested in the behav
ior of the material that solar
panels are made of but even
tually applied the same inves
tigative techniques to skin
cells.
Skin is largely composed
of dead skin cells corneo
cytes connected by wax
like substances that hold the
corneocytes together and pre
vent water from penetrating
the skin. They found that
greater exposure to UVB rays
caused the lipids in the wax
like substances to be more
poorly bonded together,
increasing the skin's tendency
to absorb water and decreas
ing its resistance to tearing
under pressure.
However, when the team
mounted skin cells onto
opposing grips and pulled
them apart, they found that
skin cells that had been
exposed to more UVB were
no less resistant to being
pulled apart than samples
with less UVB exposure.
The research team also
characterized UVB rays as a
"double-whammy" because
they not only damage the con
nective material but also dam
age the cells such that they
cannot repair the connective
material.
The study was published
Oct. 1 in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of
Sciences.
