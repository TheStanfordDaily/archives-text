## LETTER TO THE EDITOR Take-home exams are not the solution 
### RACHEL VASSAR '12 
As a member of the Board of
Judicial Affairs and a judicial
panelist last year, I would like
to comment on the Editorial Board's
suggestion that all exams at Stanford
be take-home exams. This would not
be the ideal solution to solving honor
code violations; in fact, it would most
likely increase the rate of unwarrant
ed collaboration, jut as happened in
the Harvard case last spring.
The Honor Code clearly states
that "The faculty will also avoid ...
academic procedures that create
temptations to violate the Honor
Code." Multiple faculty members
have told me that they no longer
give any take-home exams because
they believe it creates an opportuni
ty that is too tempting for some stu
dents to resist. Faculty have also
said that the judicial process is
already long and arduous enough,
so trying to prove cases of collabo
ration on take-home exams is yet
another hurdle that makes report-

ing an Honor Code violation hardly
worthwhile.
Since some classes have more
lenient collaboration policies than
others, students can often be con
fused by expectations on take-home
exams. During my four years at
Stanford, I never felt that I would
have benefitted from the opportunity
to take the exam in the comfort of
my room, at the time I desired. If
Stanford is, in fact, supposed to pre
pare us for the real world, we must
learn to perform under time pres
sures and situations that may not
always be the most convenient for
our personal schedules.
In conclusion, I think that the
Editorial Board was misguided in
their suggestion to increase the fre
quency of take home exams; and, in
fact, I believe take-home exams
should be discouraged whenever
possible.
