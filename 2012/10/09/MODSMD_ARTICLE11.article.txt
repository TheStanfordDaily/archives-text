# The 						virtues of tearing pages
## 
### Chris Herries 
Being able to work with kids has
been one of the greatest bless
ings in my life. Obviously there
are many and various reasons why
working with children is rewarding,
but none more so than this:
I used to work at a school for those
with cerebral palsy. One day my wards
and I were wrapping up a bailer read
ing session when one of the kids came
up to me with a torn-out page. He told
me he had absconded with the page a
week ago because he liked the picture.
What's important to realize is that in
our paltry library of molding books, an
absent page isn't missed. When I
asked him why he was bringing the
page back he said, "because taking the
page was the wrong thing to do." "And
why are you confessing to this now?"
"Because it's the right thing to do."
It is as if this boy knows who inher
its the Earth! Of course, my repertoire
has a hundred stories of children
doing dishonest things; those who do
wrong are people too. But when a
child does something morally
upstanding it carries more weight. If a
child can do it, why can't I?
Since its inception in classical
Greece, philosophy has been ques
tioning abstractions like justice so
I'm perfectly happy to know that
stronger minds than mine are on the
case! As this young man illustrates,
however, everyday morality is a much
simpler concept than we adults think.
The daily decisions we have to make
often have clear "rights" and
"wrongs," regardless of whether or
not we want to think that way.
Leaving a mess in the dining hall is the
wrong thing to do. Failing to clean up
after a picnic on one of the fields hurts
us all. Hurrying by someone who fell
off their bike is a problem. Choosing
to ignore an agreed-upon deadline is
blatantly wrong, as is the sense of
indignation for the punishment it
brings.
Even on the seemingly complex
level of dealing with other people, the
choices are pretty black and white.
Respect your girlfriend; cheating is
wrong. If a friend is having a problem,
don't write it off as their problem and

none of your concern. If what you're
about to say is the truth, then you
have to tell it, even if it is hurtful. If
someone asks you a question, pro
found or simple, answer it. Don't
blame your past or push it off to your
future. Don't float around with eva
sions or excuses. Cowards make
excuses and we need to be better than
that. Respect other people and their
rights as people, no matter how differ
ent they are from you.
Frankly, I believe that when we fal
ter and do the wrong thing it is
because the right thing is harder.
There was a rather ugly incident in my
Catholic high school where a few
teachers had to be laid off by the prin
cipal. I pity the man who has to make
these types of decisions. I don't pity
the man who chooses to notify the
teachers about their termination via
letters. Those are the actions of some
one who has spent their lifetime
choosing to do things the easy way.
The principal fired teachers through
five-line notes in their mailboxes.
Now, my father is a responsible busi
ness owner and his commentary is
something I'll always keep with me:
"Chris, if I fire a man, I'll at least give
him the courtesy of a meeting, a rea
son and eye contact." It is painful, it is
hard and it is the right thing to do.
Asking a girl out through a text
message is the easiest thing in the world
and it is wrong. Saying X will always be
easier than doing X. Shirking work on a
team project, ignoring emails or choos
ing not to donate time is far easier than
choosing to man-up and do our fair
share or, heaven forbid, more than our
fair share.
So, it's my turn to get in on the
page tearing action. Each day I try to
be more like that kid, because he has
it down. Figuring out the everyday
right and wrong doesn't require a phi
losophy degree, it requires common
sense and caring. When we err, let us
err towards honesty, transparency and
the golden rule.

I'm perfectly happy to know that
stronger minds than mine are on the
case! As this young man illustrates,
however, everyday morality is a much
simpler concept than we adults think.
The daily decisions we have to make
often have clear "rights" and
"wrongs," regardless of whether or
not we want to think that way.
Leaving a mess in the dining hall is the
wrong thing to do. Failing to clean up
after a picnic on one of the fields hurts
us all. Hurrying by someone who fell
off their bike is a problem. Choosing
to ignore an agreed-upon deadline is
blatantly wrong, as is the sense of
indignation for the punishment it
brings.
Even on the seemingly complex
level of dealing with other people, the
choices are pretty black and white.
Respect your girlfriend; cheating is
wrong. If a friend is having a problem,
don't write it off as their problem and

none of your concern. If what you're
about to say is the truth, then you
have to tell it, even if it is hurtful. If
someone asks you a question, pro
found or simple, answer it. Don't
blame your past or push it off to your
future. Don't float around with eva
sions or excuses. Cowards make
excuses and we need to be better than
that. Respect other people and their
rights as people, no matter how differ
ent they are from you.
Frankly, I believe that when we fal
ter and do the wrong thing it is
because the right thing is harder.
There was a rather ugly incident in my
Catholic high school where a few
teachers had to be laid off by the prin
cipal. I pity the man who has to make
these types of decisions. I don't pity
the man who chooses to notify the
teachers about their termination via
letters. Those are the actions of some
one who has spent their lifetime
choosing to do things the easy way.
The principal fired teachers through
five-line notes in their mailboxes.
Now, my father is a responsible busi
ness owner and his commentary is
something I'll always keep with me:
"Chris, if I fire a man, I'll at least give
him the courtesy of a meeting, a rea
son and eye contact." It is painful, it is
hard and it is the right thing to do.
Asking a girl out through a text
message is the easiest thing in the world
and it is wrong. Saying X will always be
easier than doing X. Shirking work on a
team project, ignoring emails or choos
ing not to donate time is far easier than
choosing to man-up and do our fair
share or, heaven forbid, more than our
fair share.
So, it's my turn to get in on the
page tearing action. Each day I try to
be more like that kid, because he has
it down. Figuring out the everyday
right and wrong doesn't require a phi
losophy degree, it requires common
sense and caring. When we err, let us
err towards honesty, transparency and
the golden rule.

Emailing Chris is the right thing to
do and it's also easy! Reach him
