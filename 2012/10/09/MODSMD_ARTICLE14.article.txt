# Rankings, accolades and mental health
## 
### Emily Cohodes 
Over the summer, Newsweek
released its rankings of the
happiest schools in the coun
try. I became aware of Stanford's first
place finish because many of my
friends started posting links to the
article on Facebook with pride,
racking up likes and comments
complimenting Stanford as the
clear winner, an obvious choice. For
a second, I felt the pride, too
happy that we finally had something
to show for the Bridge staff's late
night fliering trips to Wilbur, for
CAPS, for SPOM, for the Resilience
Project spearheaded by the UAR
but my pride quickly turned to frus
tration.
I should note here that this isn't
one of those columns where I'm
going to eventually confess my own
mental health struggle once I feel
comfortable enough with my readers.
I am, in fact, very happy at Stanford
and understand why we would be
named the happiest school in the
country. However, reading this arti
cle and similar "positive" publicity
makes me think of all the people
who don't identify with this statistic,
rather than making me think about
how accurately these numbers actu

ally do portray my Stanford experi
ence. These may be the people that
make up the supposed three percent
(where are these statistics coming
from, anyway?) who say they would
n't choose Stanford again, or maybe
they are the people that just would
n't be happy with whatever choice
they had made, but in reality the peo
ple who don't identify with this acco
lade far outnumber that three per
cent.
Reading such a proclamation
makes me think of the souls that I
have come across in my work at the
Bridge and in my work with mental
health education. For the numerous
Stanford students who report feeling
depressed, the additional burden of
not even being able to feel happy
while attending the "happiest" school
in the country seems to contradict
Newsweek's motives of recognizing
progressive schools with happy stu
dents. In the future, I'd recommend a
more enlightened approach a
showcase of great programs such as
iThrive or Stanford Peace of Mind,
rather than a bold, generalized state
ment that leaves many feeling like
misfits.
Let me take this moment to say

that I do not want to come across as
too negative about the state of men
tal health on campus. We are indebt
ed to the administration, staff, profes
sors, CAPS counselors and fellow
students who work tirelessly to
invent new programs and initiatives
that benefit students' well-being. I
am so grateful to go to a school
where we not only get free counsel
ing sessions each week of the quarter
(more of this to come in a future arti
cle, but visit vaden.stanford.edu to
find out more in the meantime), but
where we have an entire sector of
student health services devoted not
just to our "surviving" but to our
thriving; where freshmen dorms are
staffed by not only RAs but also
PHEs with special training to care for
students' health and mental needs. It
is not the intention of any one of
these columns to point a finger at the
administration for not doing enough,
to blame our staff for poor execution
or to find fault with the system. My
intention is to draw awareness to the
stigma associated with seeking help
on campus and to see how we can
best bridge the gap between the serv
ices available to Stanford students
and the students who actually need
them.
Another reason I cringe when I
see statements like Newsweek's is
because it reminds me of a key prin
ciple of developmental psychology,
which teaches parents and educators
to compliment a child on their efforts
rather than their innate abilities or
talents. Following this theory, if a
child does well on a math test, she
should be lauded for her hard work
and valiant studying efforts but never
her smarts or great math skills. The
logic, as you may have guessed, is that
kids who are rewarded for innate tal
ents will stop working hard and begin
relying on their inborn abilities,
whereas kids who believe that hard
work leads to success will consistent
ly put effort into their work or so
we hope.
Such is the case with these so
called "happiest school" rankings.
Rather than putting Stanford on a
pedestal as the happiest school and
setting it apart from the others, these
distinctions would best serve men
tal health efforts at schools around
the country if they were to praise
our new programs, campaigns and
goals rather than suggest with the
article's photo that happiness comes
from our sunshine and nicely
groomed lawns.

Emily would love to hear from you
