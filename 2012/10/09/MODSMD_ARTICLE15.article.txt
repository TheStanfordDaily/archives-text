## SWEEP TO THE TOP 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM 
As if playing an undefeated Oregon squad was
n't enough pressure for the women's volleyball
team on Friday night, the Cardinal was doing it
under the watchful eyes of the 1992 Stanford side,
which won the program's first NCAA title and was
being honored for Reunion Homecoming
Weekend.

But the No. 7 Cardinal was coming off of a
nine-game winning streak of its own, and a
thrilling 3-2 win over Oregon coupled with a 3-0
sweep of Oregon State pushed Stanford's streak to
11 and put the Card in first place in the Pac-12.

The prospect of overconfidence might have been a
concern under the circumstances, but the team
came out with poise and determination from the
opening serve.

Freshman Brittany Howard set a career high
with 14 kills against the Ducks. "We just take it one
game at a time," she said, "and obviously the win
ning streak is phenomenal, and we feel really good

and it's building our confidence, but just because
you won the past games doesn't mean you're going
to win the next ones."

A large crowd watched as Stanford pulled off a
close 25-23 win in the first set against Oregon.
Hard-fought points and rallies weren't enough in
the second set, however, as the Ducks' defense
shone and its attack finally found its groove in a
25-18 second set win.

Coming out of the second set tied 1-1, fresh
man Morgan Burgess said the team wasn't close to
folding. "We didn't really feel that we had been

Sophomore Kyle Gilbert (10) set a career high with 24 digs against Oregon and followed that up with a 20-dig performance against Oregon
State as Stanford rolled past both schools and into first place in the Pac-12. The Cardinal has now won 11 matches in a row.

playing our best," Burgess
said. "Even in the first set, so
we just wanted to refocus and
start over and remember that
we were tied 1-1, it wasn't like
we were losing."
The Cardinal came out fir
ing in the third set with a quick
two points before the Ducks
made a 4-0 run. Howard then
made the kill that gave the
Cardinal a little momentum
back. But Oregon got its confi
dence back as its defense con
tinued to hold strong and
regained an 11-8 lead. As was
the case all night, however, the
match continued to go back
and forth. There were 14 ties
and nine lead changes in the
set, but Oregon capitalized on
several attack errors and won
five of the seven points to take
the third set 23-25 and take a
2-1 set lead in the match.
But with the crowd on its
feet, Stanford's attack roared to
life in the fourth set. The Card
hit a match-high .326 in the set,
taking a 14-10 lead and domi
nating down the stretch in a 25-
20 victory, forcing a fifth set.
Oregon came out with a
dogged determination in the
fifth set. Again, it was a big
point by Howard that snapped
the Ducks 4-0 run and provid
ed the Cardinal with the impe
tus to keep pushing. They
eventually clawed back to tie
the game at eight. Stanford
had already gained an 11-9
lead before Oregon coach Jim
Moore called a timeout. The
Cardinal took charge the rest
of the set, only allowing
Oregon to score one more
point and finishing the game
with a 15-10 win in the fifth
set.

"We just have a lot of indi
viduals who fight hard, so
when we come together it ere

ates this energy where we just
don't want to lose, so we'll just
keep fighting for it," Burgess
said of the team's effort in the
fifth set.
Before being knocked off
by the Cardinals, Oregon had
only lost four sets previously
in the season. The Ducks drop
to 14-1 overall and 5-1 in the
conference. On being a con
tributing factor in breaking
Oregon's winning streak
Howard said, "It feels really
good. I have the greatest team
mates and they'll support me
whether I'm having a good
game or a bad game. It was
amazing that I could perform
tonight and that we could
come out with the win".
Throughout the game, the
floor was dominated by at
least three freshmen on the
court at all times. It has been
apparent from the start of the
season though that they mesh
quite comfortably with the
team veterans.
As freshmen Madi Bugg
and Megan McGehee said,
"We [the freshman] are one
third of the team and the older
girls really made it so easy for
us to become a part of the
team and they welcomed us
and its been so much fun and
we just love playing together."
Head coach John Dunning
enjoys the luxury of having
such a deep team. "There's a
bunch of people that step up at
different times and I don't think
we've had a match everyone is
on yet," he said. "We have a lot
of depth and we're not afraid to
use it. We have a group of fif
teen people who can come in
and help us at any time."
In addition to Howard's
career high in kills, freshman
Inky Ajanaku totaled eight
kills and posted a career-high
10 blocks. Sophomore libero
Kyle Gilbert finished with a
career-high 24 digs.
Sunday's win over Oregon
State wasn't quite as exciting,
but it was definitely more effi

cient.
The Cardinal didn't trail in
the first set, a 25-19 win, and
turned on the jets in the 25-14
second-game victory with a
.457 hitting percentage. It
wasted little time in the third,
either, wrapping up the after
noon in a little over an hour
with another 25-14 win.
A huge contributor in the
game was Bugg, who made
scrappy plays and was all over
the court the third set. Bugg
totaled 24 assists, nine digs and
two kills.
"I felt confident because
when your defense and hitters
are as good as ours then
there's no reason not to feel
confident," she said.
Stanford finished the
match with a 25-14 win in the
third set. At the end of the
match Stanford coach John
Dunning was able to make
plenty of substitutions. One
such bench player, freshman
middle blocker Megan
McGehee, came into the game
late in the third set and had
two key kills that earned the
Cardinal the victory.
"It was a lot of fun to just
get thrown in there and get to
play. Everything happened
pretty quick," McGehee said
of her first action in confer
ence play.
Dunning was excited, if
also a little cautious, to see his
team playing so well. "This is a
real interesting streak we're
going through.... Each day
our team is doing a really good
job of saying, 'Well this is the
team in front of us,' and we got
a lot of confidence from play
ing Oregon and Oregon State
this weekend and that's going
to make us more ready for
next week."
The Cardinal plays USC
on Wednesday and UCLA on
Friday, both at Maples
Pavilion.
