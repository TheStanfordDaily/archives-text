# USA shines at stars and stripes
## CARD EARNS TOUGH SPLIT 
### JANA PERSKY 
Anyone wandering by the
women's lacrosse game at Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium on Sunday may
have been a little bit confused to see
that Stanford's opponents' jerseys
said Team USA. Wiile Stanford is
large enough to have its own zip
code, it doesn't usually compete on a
national level.
It was no typo, however. The
teams were playing each other as
part of the Stars and Stripes
women's lacrosse event, which
matches top collegiate and interna
tional teams. Stanford would go on
to lose the game against Team USA
17-6.
While the exhibition was intend
ed to serve as a warm-up for Team
USA in its march to the 2013 FIL
World Cup, it was also a good kick
off for the Cardinal. "We haven't
had a lot of practices under our belt
because we only started school on
September 24 so that's when we
started everything," said assistant
coach Lauren Schwarzmann, who
also competes for Team USA as a
midfielder. "No other team in the
country was doing what we were
doing this weekend and I think it
was an incredible opportunity for
the Stanford team to go out there
and play the best competition in the
world."

This was the first time that Team
USA had played in California, a sign
of the sport's growing West Coast
presence. "We are growing the game
out here in California, so it's pretty
amazing that we have this caliber of
teams and players to be out here at
Stanford and see our facilities and
everything we have to offer the
sport," Schwarzmann said.
The Cardinal began the tourna
ment with a 12-8 loss to Team
England on Wednesday, but
bounced back to defeat Rikkyo of
Japan, 20-2. Freshmen Meg Lentz
and Paige Southmayd both record
ed hat tricks in the game against
Rikkyo as 12 different players
scored for Stanford.

The win left Stanford riding high
with plenty of confidence heading
into Thursday's match against Team
Australia. After trailing 10-5 at half
time, Stanford made a comeback
charge behind several great saves by

junior goalie Lyndsey Munoz and a
late tying goal from Southmayd.
However, the Aussies won the ensu
ing faceoff and scored with 30 sec
onds left to take the game.
The main challenge for the
Cardinal was Sunday's game against
Team USA. Freshman midfielder
Lucy Dikeou opened the game with
a free position goal just 30 seconds
in. But after that, Stanford had diffi
culty getting into a rhythm as Team
USA dominated draw controls and
maintained possession.
Goalkeeper Munoz recorded
eight saves in the first half, many of
the spectacular variety, as Stanford

straggled to clear against the high
octane Team USA press. Junior
attacker Annie Anton also added a
goal, but Team USA closed the half
on an 8-0 run and lead 12-2 at half
time.

The Card tightened up defen
sively at the beginning of the second
half, holding Team USA to just one
goal in the first 18 minutes of the
half. However, Team USA subse
quently exploded for three goals in
four minutes to extend their lead.
Stanford managed to respond with a
streak of its own as freshman mid
fielder Julia Burns, Dikeou and
Southmayd scored three consecu
tive goals before Team USA put in
the final point of the game.

saves on the day.
Despite mixed results on the
scoreboard, the team believes
the tournament was a success.
"Our main goal was to try our
hardest and see what we have to

work on going forward," Munoz
said. "There are always going to
be things we need to work on,
especially since we have only
been playing together for a
week but I think our defense
was run very well and the com
munication was good."
"I think [the team] did
awesome," Schwarzmann said.
"Obviously it was very good
competition. It was one of

those things were they went
out and played very hard and I
think they showed well for
their first fall ball event."
The Cardinal will be head
ing out to the East Coast next
weekend to play in a tourna
ment at Georgetown and
Navy.

scoreboard, the team believes
the tournament was a success.
"Our main goal was to try our
hardest and see what we have to

work on going forward," Munoz
said. "There are always going to
be things we need to work on,
especially since we have only
been playing together for a
week but I think our defense
was run very well and the com
munication was good."
"I think [the team] did
awesome," Schwarzmann said.
"Obviously it was very good
competition. It was one of

those things were they went
out and played very hard and I
think they showed well for
their first fall ball event."

Anyone wandering by the
women's lacrosse game at Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium on Sunday may
have been a little bit confused to see
that Stanford's opponents' jerseys
said Team USA. Wiile Stanford is
large enough to have its own zip
code, it doesn't usually compete on a
national level.
It was no typo, however. The
teams were playing each other as
part of the Stars and Stripes
women's lacrosse event, which
matches top collegiate and interna
tional teams. Stanford would go on
to lose the game against Team USA
17-6.
While the exhibition was intend
ed to serve as a warm-up for Team
USA in its march to the 2013 FIL
World Cup, it was also a good kick
off for the Cardinal. "We haven't
had a lot of practices under our belt
because we only started school on
September 24 so that's when we
started everything," said assistant
coach Lauren Schwarzmann, who
also competes for Team USA as a
midfielder. "No other team in the
country was doing what we were
doing this weekend and I think it
was an incredible opportunity for
the Stanford team to go out there
and play the best competition in the
world."

This was the first time that Team
USA had played in California, a sign
of the sport's growing West Coast
presence. "We are growing the game
out here in California, so it's pretty
amazing that we have this caliber of
teams and players to be out here at
Stanford and see our facilities and
everything we have to offer the
sport," Schwarzmann said.
The Cardinal began the tourna
ment with a 12-8 loss to Team
England on Wednesday, but
bounced back to defeat Rikkyo of
Japan, 20-2. Freshmen Meg Lentz
and Paige Southmayd both record
ed hat tricks in the game against
Rikkyo as 12 different players
scored for Stanford.

The win left Stanford riding high
with plenty of confidence heading
into Thursday's match against Team
Australia. After trailing 10-5 at half
time, Stanford made a comeback
charge behind several great saves by

junior goalie Lyndsey Munoz and a
late tying goal from Southmayd.
However, the Aussies won the ensu
ing faceoff and scored with 30 sec
onds left to take the game.
The main challenge for the
Cardinal was Sunday's game against
Team USA. Freshman midfielder
Lucy Dikeou opened the game with
a free position goal just 30 seconds
in. But after that, Stanford had diffi
culty getting into a rhythm as Team
USA dominated draw controls and
maintained possession.
Goalkeeper Munoz recorded
eight saves in the first half, many of
the spectacular variety, as Stanford

straggled to clear against the high
octane Team USA press. Junior
attacker Annie Anton also added a
goal, but Team USA closed the half
on an 8-0 run and lead 12-2 at half
time.

The Card tightened up defen
sively at the beginning of the second
half, holding Team USA to just one
goal in the first 18 minutes of the
half. However, Team USA subse
quently exploded for three goals in
four minutes to extend their lead.
Stanford managed to respond with a
streak of its own as freshman mid
fielder Julia Burns, Dikeou and
Southmayd scored three consecu
tive goals before Team USA put in
the final point of the game.
Freshman goaltender Katie
Wiseman stepped in to start the sec
ond half and also recorded eight
