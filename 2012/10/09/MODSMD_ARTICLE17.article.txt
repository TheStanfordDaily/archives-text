# FIELD HOCKEY
## Stanford unbeaten in NorPac 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After starting the season with
three losses in the first four games,
Stanford women's field hockey has
turned it on of late, with eight victo
ries in the past nine matches and a
clean start to conference play after
the No. 14 Cardinal knocked off
UC-Davis and Pacific over the
weekend.
While last weekend's road victo
ry over rival California was tight
throughout and eventually decided
by just one goal, resulting in a 2-1
win, this weekend was quite a bit
lighter in tone and drama.

In the team's first home game
since Sept. 9, Stanford (9-4, 3-0
NorPac) came out fired up on
offense against the Aggies (7-7, 3-
1). Senior All-American Becky Dru
opened the scoring at the 10:33
mark of the first half, cashing in on
a penalty corner for a lead that
Davis never threatened.
Sophomore Shannon Herold's
unassisted drive from midfield to
the cage put the Cardinal up 2-0
just four minutes later, and two
more goals salted the game away
even before the halftime whistle
had blown.
The scoreboard was clearly lop
sided; Davis failed to get off a
recorded shot in the half, while
Stanford had 13 in the first 35 min
utes of play.
With a big lead and most of the
possession, the Cardinal let its foot
off the gas a bit in the second half,
shooting less frequently while
maintaining crisp passing on the
wet turf. Courtney Haldeman
capped the night's scoring with her
team-leading seventh goal in the
50th minute, sliding a ball past
goalie Conley Craven on a nice
pass from Dru.
Sunday's match was more of the
same, as Dru scored a pair of goals
