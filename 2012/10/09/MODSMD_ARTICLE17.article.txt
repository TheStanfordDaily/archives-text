## Stanford unbeaten in NorPac 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After starting the season with
three losses in the first four games,
Stanford women's field hockey has
turned it on of late, with eight victo
ries in the past nine matches and a
clean start to conference play after
the No. 14 Cardinal knocked off
UC-Davis and Pacific over the
weekend.
While last weekend's road victo
ry over rival California was tight
throughout and eventually decided
by just one goal, resulting in a 2-1
win, this weekend was quite a bit
lighter in tone and drama.

In the team's first home game
since Sept. 9, Stanford (9-4, 3-0
NorPac) came out fired up on
offense against the Aggies (7-7, 3-
1). Senior All-American Becky Dru
opened the scoring at the 10:33
mark of the first half, cashing in on
a penalty corner for a lead that
Davis never threatened.
Sophomore Shannon Herold's
unassisted drive from midfield to
the cage put the Cardinal up 2-0
just four minutes later, and two
more goals salted the game away
even before the halftime whistle
had blown.
The scoreboard was clearly lop
sided; Davis failed to get off a
recorded shot in the half, while
Stanford had 13 in the first 35 min
utes of play.
With a big lead and most of the
possession, the Cardinal let its foot
off the gas a bit in the second half,
shooting less frequently while
maintaining crisp passing on the
wet turf. Courtney Haldeman
capped the night's scoring with her
team-leading seventh goal in the
50th minute, sliding a ball past
goalie Conley Craven on a nice
pass from Dru.
Sunday's match was more of the
same, as Dru scored a pair of goals

for the second straight game
and Haldeman chipped in
another in the 4-1 victory over
Pacific (4-9, 0-2). The Tigers
didn't go quite as quietly as
the Aggies, holding the
Cardinal scoreless through the
first half even while they com
bined for just two shot
attempts to Stanford's 13.
It didn't take long for
Stanford to break through,
once again thanks to a familiar
face. Dru slotted her fifth goal

of the year past the keeper for
a 1-0 lead, following up with
another 11 minutes later after
pouncing on a loose ball.
The Tigers found the net in
the 60th minute, spoiling fresh
man goalkeeper Dulcie Davies'
shutout, but the junior attack
er Haldeman upped her scor
ing tally with another in the
68th minute for the final 4-1
margin. Stanford's final num
bers once again were domi
nant: a 22-6 advantage in
shots, 12-2 advantage in penal
ty corners.

On the whole, the victory
was merely the latest edition
of the Cardinal's domination
over several of its league

opponents Pacific's last
victory in the season series
came "back on Sept. 30,2006, a
span of 12 games.
The competition will pick
up significantly next week,
however, when Stanford hits
the road for two non-confer
ence games against No. 1
Syracuse (at a neutral site in
Amherst, Mass.) and No. 3
Connecticut.
The Cardinal will return to
California to play its remain
ing slate of league matches
beginning with a home game
against the Tigers on Oct. 19.
