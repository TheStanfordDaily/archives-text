# What about the NCPA?

Last week I was privileged to
sit down and interview a
handful of Stanford stu
dents who had spent their
summer competing against
the world's elite at the London 2012
Olympic Games. Of everything we
chatted about, one thing struck me
most: All of them but one were on the
Farm's varsity teams.
It wasn't that I hadn't expected all
of these athletes to have serious sup
port from the Athletics Department,
but instead that, for a university that
prides itself on the breadth of its sport
ing interest, I'd expected all of them to
have this backing.
The odd one out? Senior Roy
Perkins, a six-time medal winner in the
pool at the last two Games, including a
gold medal in Beijing 2008.
If you are surprised that you have
never heard of him, I should explain
that Perkins did not compete in the
Olympics, but in the Paralympics. But I
don't see the fact that he was born
without hands or feet as relevant here.
Where you or I might see disability,
Perkins has gone out and achieved
more athletically than most of us able
bodied souls will ever get close to.
Every single semi-professional ath
lete at Stanford, from the varsity
squads to the club teams and the inde
pendents like Perkins, has to struggle to
balance the demands of one of the
world's top academic universities
against their training commitments.
For most, this is nothing new; it is what
they having been doing pretty much
since as far back as they can remember.
Where you or I may be an expert at
procrastination, many of these folks
just simply can't afford that luxury.
There is a class difference, however,
even if not necessarily in ability. The
varsity athletes at Stanford may still
have to take the same classes as the
rest of us and achieve the same mini
mum GPA to stay enrolled, but they do
have a lot of support in all the other
areas of their lives. From access to
world-class coaches and facilities to
skilled trainers and physical therapists
that help them deal with injuries, free
travel to competitions and even some
flexibility when exams conflict with
events.
The question of whether student
athletes should be paid is a controver
sial one. The majority of universities
and the NCAA are clearly against the
idea, which could significantly eat into
the huge profits they can make from
college sports such as football and bas
ketball.
But although students are given the
opportunity to get a college degree "for
free," they often risk serious injury that
could make the difference between
becoming a professional superstar and
an unknown nobody; on those terms it
only seems right that they should earn
something during their time at college.
Don't be fooled, however. It is only
when you compare the difference
between the athlete haves and have
nots that you realize how much they
are paid in kind.
Watching the Paralympic Games a
few weeks ago was both a frustrating
and inspiring experience. Frustrating
because here, in the United States, the
official broadcaster NBC basically
ignored the event. Inspiring because
when I finally discovered away to
watch events live on You Tube, it was
not just amazing to see top athletes
achieving remarkable things, but also
to see packed stadiums cheering them
on.
It is depressing, though, that this is
really a once-in-every-four-years expe
rience. Only then do Paralympians
come close to the support and atten
tion given to their Olympian brothers
and sisters. That many can compete at
the level that they do after this com
plete vacuum is far more impressive
than Usain Bolt winning yet another
100 m final.
Many countries must be deeply
envious of the NCAA and collegiate
athletics in the USA. It is really not a
surprise that given the resources avail
able at many universities here, a signif
icant number of colleges routinely win
far more gold, silver and bronze
medals than most nations. The United
States might not always win the medal
count at the Olympics, but it always
comes close, and many of its rivals can
count themselves to have United
States-trained athletes among their
teams. It is easy to feel that the culture
of U.S. collegiate sport has raised the
bar of the competition at the Olympic
Games.
Imagine, then, what providing simi
lar support for athletes like Perkins
could achieve. The phrase "Paralympic
Games" stands not for disability but for
the "Parallel Olympic Games." Is it not
time that the National Collegiate
