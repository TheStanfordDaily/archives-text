# Storey damaged, residents displaced
## House reopened early Monday morning, but nine students still unable to return

A sprinkler went off in Storey House shortly
before 1 a.m. Monday morning, flooding several
rooms and displacing all 52 residents for the
night. Nine students will be temporarily relocated
until their rooms are repaired.
Firefighters arrived at the scene and prohibit
ed residents from returning to their rooms, even
to pick up possessions, because of potential elec
trical problems caused by the flooding. A fire
watch was implemented until the sprinkler sys
tem could be fully emptied. After an electrician

visited the house, several residents on the first
floor were able to pick up possessions but not
sleep inside the house.

"We didn't know what we were being evacu

Higuchi 'l3 said. "Initially, we thought a fire was
going on but a lot of the residents who witnessed
that original flooding were the ones who told us
what had happened."

A cleanup crew from Residential and Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) worked on the house
overnight, reopening it slightly after 8:30 a.m. that
same morning.

The sprinkler went off in a single room on the

third floor and water, which one resident
described as dirty and murky, seeped down into
two rooms below the original room and into adja
cent third floor rooms.

Most residents were able to find alternate
sleeping arrangements for the night. Storey's staff
was also in contact with Stanford Housing to pro
vide rooms and bedding to residents who
required it. Muwekma-tah-Ruk, the Native
American themed house directly across the street
from Storey, opened its lounge areas for any resi
dents who needed housing for the night.
By 3 a.m., all residents had either found hous
ing or had received information from staff mem

bers about alternate housing locations. About a
dozen staff members and residents braved the
cold for several hours at the benches outside of
Storey while the Palo Alto Fire Department
worked inside the house. Most students stayed in
friends' rooms, with two staying in the Lasuen
guest rooms and others sleeping on mattresses
and linens set up in the Bob House lounge. Storey
House kitchen reopened in time for breakfast
Monday morning.
The nine students who will not be able to
return to their rooms for several days are being
