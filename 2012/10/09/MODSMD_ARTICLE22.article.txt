# QB Nunes named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week on heels of comeback win
## SPORTS BRIEF 
### 
Redshirt junior quarterback Josh Nunes
became the second Stanford player in 2012 to
be named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week,
earning the distinction Monday after he brought
the No. 17 Cardinal back from a two-touchdown
deficit in the fourth quarter of its win against
Arizona.
Stanford (4-1, 2-0 Pac-12) would not have
stayed perfect in conference play had it not
been for Nunes. Just nine days after he and the
rest of the Cardinal offense floundered against
Washington, not scoring a touchdown, it put up
54 against the Wildcats (3-3,0-3).
Nunes accounted for five touchdowns â€”

three of them on goal-line quarterback keepers
and threw for 360 yards. By comparison, it
took Andrew Luck, Nunes' predecessor and the
first overall pick in last year's NFL Draft, seven
games to break the 300-yard mark in his rookie
season; his first such performance came on Oct.
17,2009, when he threw for 423 yards in a 43-38
loss to those very same Wildcats.
Nunes is the first Pac-12 quarterback to rush
for three touchdowns in a game since 2009. He
beat out Arizona quarterback Matt Scott, who
completed a conference-record 45 passes in the
game, for this week's award.
Senior running back Stepfan Taylor also won
conference Player of the Week honors after the
Cardinal's 21-14 upset of then-No.-2 USC on
Sept. 15. Lineman Ben Gardner took home the
equivalent defensive award the very same week.
