## Stanford professor's 'virtual' pathology constructs 3-D images of disease 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Edward Ngai 
Pathologists have long had to deal with
the wait between sample extraction and
return of test results, but thanks to research
done by medical school microbiology profes
sor Christopher Contag, tools now exist to
look below the surface of the skin, increasing
the speed of and better informing medical
diagnoses for many diseases, including cancer.
In an interview with The New York
Times, Contag called the process, which uses
new technology to construct three-dimen
sional images hundreds of cells deep, "point
of care pathology." Using the technology he
has developed at Stanford, doctors will be
able to make informed decisions without
sending samples to pathology labs and hav
ing to wait for results to come back.
Seeing images, however, is not the same
as running tests in a lab like in conventional
pathology, which is why Contag's "virtual"
pathology is not commonly accepted as
standard medical practice in the medical
community. Looking forward, Contag hopes
to design new molecular biomarkers that
can be injected and attached to cancer and
lesions so surgeons have definitive evidence
of disease.
These advancements in the field of imag
ing, which have the potential to not only
increase the speed of pathological diag
noses, but also to make tests less expensive,
have the potential to reduce barriers to
quality medical care.
