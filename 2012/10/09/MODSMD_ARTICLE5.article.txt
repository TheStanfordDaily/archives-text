# STUDENT LIFE
## OAPE alcohol letter targets frosh parents 
### NIUNIU TEO 
For the first time, the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE)
sent a letter to parents of incoming fresh
men on Aug. 7 to encourage conversa
tion between students and their parents
about college drinking. Freshmen have
reported limited effects of the letter.
The letter, signed by Greg
Boardman, vice provost for student
affairs, Ralph Castro, director of OAPE
and Sally Lannin '7B, co-chair of the new
Stanford Parent Alcohol Advisory
Group, discussed student access to alco
hol, negative impacts of drinking and the
importance of regular conversations
between parents and students about
alcohol.
"[The letter] is part of our multifac
eted approach to address high-risk

drinking at Stanford," Castro said. "We
see parents as important stakeholders in
our work and we wanted to engage them
in the conversation around alcohol."
The effectiveness of the letter itself
has been doubted by freshmen, many of
whom did not sense any change in their
parents' behavior upon receiving the let
ter.
"Honestly, I wasn't really aware of
any formal attempt to have a conversa
tion about [drinking]," Alex Barata 'l6
said. "1 think it's something that some
parents would bring up on their own, and
others just might not bother."
Even freshmen whose parents did
have a formal talk about drinking in col
lege after receiving the letter mentioned
that the official conversation itself was
not as effective as the conver
sations they had had in the
past with their parents.
"I don't think I'm making
decisions based on what
they've said to me recently,"
said Elisabeth Dee 'l6. "I
think I'm making decisions
based on what they've said to
me over the course of my
entire life."

Less disputed however is
the idea that parental involve
ment has a beneficial effect on
the decisions of students
regarding alcohol.
"Not everyone needs to
hear the talk from their par
ents, but for some people it
can certainly help," Trancos
Peer Health Educator (PHE)
Erica Lieberman 'l4 said. "I
think that overall there are
probably more people who

benefit from the talk then
those who don't."

However, according to
Castro, the purpose behind the
letter was not only to warn stu
dents of the dangers of alcohol
but also to inform parents
about Stanford's alcohol-relat
ed resources.
"The main purpose [of the
letter] was to let parents know
that we are proactively engag
ing in constructive discussions
and activities to prevent high
risk drinking," Castro said.
"We wanted to inform parents
about our new initiatives."
These initiatives have been
bolstered by an OAPE survey
that showed alcohol use at
Stanford as being on par with
the national average —just
below in alcohol consumption
and above in hard liquor use,
pre-gaming and having alco
hol as the center of campus
social life.
OAPE and the Parent
Advisory Group believe
parental involvement earlier

in the year can help alleviate
the problems causing by irre
sponsible drinking behavior.
"Research shows that by
having a frank, face-to-face
conversation with your stu
dent, you can have a positive
effect on your son or daugh
ter's approach to alcohol once
they arrive," the OAPE letter
states.

"I think that a lot of the
high-risk drinking occurs with
residents who haven't had
experience with alcohol
before college and just aren't
really aware of how dangerous
it is to consume many drinks
rapidly," said freshman
Resident Assistant (RA)
Javier Guinard 'l4. "Having a
conversation with your par
ents can make freshmen a lit
tle bit more aware about the
consequences that their
behavior towards alcohol
might have."
