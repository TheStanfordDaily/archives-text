## New art dept. building on schedule Construction to begin on McMurtry Building site, next to Cantor Arts Center; in 2013 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Construction will begin on schedule for the McMurtry
Building, the new home of Stanford's Art & Art History
Department, in summer 2013. The structure is intended to
invigorate the department and strengthen its presence on
campus.
The building will be located adjacent to the Cantor Arts
Center, and is scheduled to open for classes in fall 2015.
Pending the relevant county permits, the first construction
will begin in May/June 2013, according to Site Manager
Susan Rozakis.
Along with other new structures such as the Bing
Concert Hall and the future home of the Anderson
Collection, the McMurtry Building will contribute to the
"vibrant 'Arts District' at the entry to campus," according to
University Architect and Director of Campus Planning
David Lenox.
Lenox said the building will also create a cohesive center
for the Department of Art & Art History, which is currently
housed in a number of buildings across campus. The building
is expected to host the art and architecture library, faculty
offices, classrooms, student exhibit space, a graduate lounge,
studios and a cafe.
Donors Burt McMurtry M.S. '59 Ph.D. '62, former chair of
the Board of Trustees, and his wife Deedee contributed $3O
million towards the anticipated $B5 million total cost. The
University is still seeking $l3 million in donations from other
sources, according to Director of Development Programs
Maude Brezinski.
The building's design, which includes plenty of open
space as well as two diagonal "strands" of classrooms
wrapped around the central library, is expected to be a point
of interest for students, faculty and visitors. The design was
completed by New York architectural firm Diller Scofidio +
Renfro, with Portland, OR-based Boora Architects selected
as the executive architect. Boora was also the architect on the
Science and Engineering Quad and the Knight Management
Center.
"It's going to have character, and that's appropriate for a
building in which we teach art, and we teach about architec
tural history and art history," said Nancy Troy, chair of the
Department of Art & Art History. "It should be a distinctive,
original expression. It will not be a passive experience of
space."
Although the building will function as a second home to
the approximately 120 undergraduate students majoring or
minoring in one of the five programs in the Department of
Art & Art History, it will also be used by the many non-major
students who take classes in the department as well as stu
dents who are taking non-related classes to be held in the
facility.
The creation of a larger space for the department came
out of the Stanford Arts Initiative, part of the six-year
Stanford Challenge that ended
in December 2011, ultimately
raising $126.8 million to create
state-of-the-art buildings and
facilities, of which the
McMurtry building is one.

"At a time when the arts
and humanities have had to
retrench in many other parts

of the country and certainly in
public universities, Stanford
has stepped up to the plate,"
Troy said.
"There might be other
places that have a longer tra
dition or are more conven
tionally associated with the
visual arts," Troy said. "But if
you have a choice, wouldn't
you want to be a part of mak
ing a place like Stanford over
in such away that the arts are
really going to play a major
role in the lives of students

who come here?"
Although Troy acknowl
edged that Stanford is not
known for its art programs,
she said that the current
"efflorescence of the arts on
campus," as evidenced by the
creation of structures such as
the McMurtry Building, will
draw students and faculty to
Stanford's Department of Art
& Art History.
