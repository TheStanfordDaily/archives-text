# STUDENT GROUPS
## First 'ThanksGiving Back' draws 94 apps 
### SARAH MOORE 
This Thanksgiving break. Alternative Spring
Break (ASB) is sponsoring four new service
learning trips through the pilot launch of
ThanksGiving Back (TGB). Programs on
Alzheimer's disease, hepatitis B, environmental
justice and the intersection of art and social
change drew a total of 94 applications, including
about 40 incomplete applications, in TGB's inau

gural year.
According to TGB director Rachel Kelley
'l2, the idea of service-learning trips during
Stanford's weeklong Thanksgiving break was
originally proposed a couple years ago, largely
driven by huge demand for service-based learn
ing.

"In the past several years we have increased
the number of ASB trips, launched the Impact
Abroad program and last year decided to pilot a

program during the Thanksgiving week break,"
said Associate Director for Public Service
Education Jon McConnell. "Additionally, each
year we see students asking about service-relat
ed activities that they can be involved in during
the Thanksgiving break since they are not plan
ning to travel home during the week."
The TGB program is similar to the popular
ASB courses. Its goal is to
expose students to social
issues and motivate them to
transform communities. The
logistics of the program, how
ever, run quite differently.

There are about a dozen
fewer TGB trips offered, all
located in the Bay Area rather
than across the country like
ASB trips. TGB students must
only attend three mandatory
two-hour pre-trip workshops
rather than enroll in a quarter
long course to prepare. TGB
trip sizes are limited to 10 stu
dents rather than ASB's 12,
and the trips themselves are a
couple of days shorter.
According to Kelley, the
program has been trying to
heavily advertise in order to
measure student interest.

"Maybe some people are
going to say that they need
that time for their families or
to study because it is right
before finals," Kelley said. "We
weren't exactly sure what our
demand would be like."

"We've been encouraging
people in our program to real
ly forward the flyers around to
make sure that people know
about it, so if we don't get high
numbers we know that people
don't want a TGB program
rather than they just didn't
know about it," he said.
Christina Wang 'l5, a team
leader for the hepatitis B TGB
trip, said her team advertised
through flyers and emails.
"Having a trip right before
Thanksgiving is really tough
because a lot of things are
closed," Wang said. "That's
one of the advantages that
ASB planners will have over
TGB planners but I think that
TGB will definitely grow in
trip quantity and options.
There's a lot to explore
around us!"

Wang said that she is excit
ed for TGB because it will give
her the opportunity to meet
new people and learn more
about her trip topic.
"A lot of the people I'm
setting up tours and shadow
ing opportunities with are
totally people that I admire
but haven't talked to yet, like
Assemblywoman Fiona Ma,
who is a leader in hepatitis B

advocacy and a hep B patient
herself," she said.
Applications closed last
Friday, Oct. 5. Despite the fact
that more than a third of appli
cations were incomplete,
Kelley was satisfied with the
number of students who
expressed their interest.
"Considering that this is
the first year of the program
and that it doesn't have quite
the name recognition as ASB,
we're really pleased with the
app turnout," Kelley said.
As far as TGB's future is
concerned, McConnell says
ASB will evaluate the pilot
year of the program and pro
ceed accordingly.
"Based on the initial
enthusiasm of our trip leaders
and applicants, I would imag
ine that we will definitely want
to continue and hopefully
even grow the program in
future years," McConnell said.
"As always, it will depend on
student interest and on what
our budget will allow."
Students who applied will
be notified of their status by
next week.
