## Social dance class struggles to achieve gender balance 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Social Dance 1, one of Stanford's most pop
ular introductory dance classes, was forced to
reopen its doors this fall after reaching full
capacity to correct a gender imbalance of 17
more males than females.
"I don't like to deny anyone the chance to
learn social dancing," social dance instructor
Richard Powers wrote in an email to The Daily.
"If someone wants to learn to dance, I don't
want to turn them away. So instead of kicking
the extra men out of the class, we spread the
word that there is room for a few more women
in the class."
According to Powers, Social Dance 1 almost
always has a few extra men during the first few
days of the quarter, with the gender imbalance
usually only being off by about 10 percent most
years. Even with the trend of gender imbalance,
Powers always remains confident that the class
will sort itself out.
"The Social Dance 1 classes are well-known
on campus, so it doesn't take long for the class to
balance," he said.
In an attempt to resolve this year's 17-mem
ber difference, a few students who were enrolled
in Social Dance 1 took it upon themselves to
reach out to other females. Meredith Lehmann
'l6 tried to help enroll more girls in the class
after learning about this year's imbalance.
"On the first day of class, the professor said

'We're short 17 girls,"' Lehmann said. "So I sent
an email out to my dorm chatlist and asked
other girls I knew to sign up. We were close to
gender-balanced by the second Monday of class
es."
Despite all the discussion around gender,
Powers was quick to point out that role balance
is a more important issue in Social Dance than
gender balance.
"It's actually a matter of'role balance' the
lead role (some say leaders) and the follow role
(some say followers)" Powers said. "In 21st cen
tury America, especially California and
Stanford, social dancing is about people dancing
with people, in a playful lead/follow dynamic."
"More than 90 percent of the time [the
lead/follow dynamic] ends up being the tradi
tion of men dancing with women We've
evolved beyond turning that tradition into a lim
itation," he added.
Powers referenced the fact that some stu
dents, both male and female, have already taken
social dance before and are returning to the
class to learn how to dance the other half of the
lead/follow dynamic —an option that then
allows for males and females to dance with part
ners of the same gender.
"Stanford students are exceptional, and
therefore are ready for exceptions to older tra
ditions," Powers said.
