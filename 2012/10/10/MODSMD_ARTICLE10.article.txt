# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Pac-12 powerhouses visit the Farm 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
The wins just keep piling up for the Stanford
women's volleyball team, which has soared to No.
4 in the country following another dominating per
formance this past weekend. After pulling out a
tough five-set win against Oregon and taking care
of business in three sets against Oregon State, the
Cardinal extended its winning streak to 11 games
and remained undefeated in conference play.
But the road certainly gets more difficult for
Stanford (14-2,6-0 Pac-12) this week, as a pair of
Pac-12 powerhouses from Southern California

visit the Farm.
Maples Pavilion will be the center of the volley
ball universe tonight when No. 6 USC (16-2, 4-2
Pac-12) rolls into town. The Trojans are coming off
a dominating performance in which they disman
tled both Arizona and Arizona State last weekend.
Despite a couple of hiccups against very talented
Washington and Oregon squads, the Trojans have
had a successful season and will certainly be look
ing to end Stanford's winning streak.
A surprisingly dominant veteran-rookie pair
has led USC's offense this season. Standout fresh
man outside hitter Samantha Bricio, a highly tout
ed recruit from Jalisco, Mexico, has been as good as

advertised for the Trojans. She is leading the team
in kills (242 at 4.10 per set) and trails only libero
Natalie Hagglund and setter Hayley Crone in digs
(144 at 2.44 per set). Her stellar play has helped
USC transform into a national championship con
tender, subsequently making a name for herself as
potential Pac-12 Player of the Year. Senior oppo
site Katie Fuller is not far behind, however, having
amassed 206 kills and 125 digs throughout the sea
son. The talented pair has complimented each
other perfectly.
Still, their success would not be possible with-
out sophomore stalwart
Hayley Crone, the talented
setter who has orchestrated
the Trojans offensive attack.
Crone has recorded 680 assists
thus far, and will add to this
total against the Cardinal.
Stanford middle blocker Carly
Wopat, one of the team's
defensive leaders at the net,
definitely has her hands full.
The schedule certainly
doesn't lighten up for Stanford.
On Friday night at Maples, the
Card will renew its rivalry with
the defending national champi
on UCLA Bruins (12-3, 4-2
Pac-12). UCLA certainly had

Stanford's number last season,
beating the Card 3-2 and 3-0 in
their two meetings of the sea
son. The Cardinal will be look
ing to reverse its fortunes on
Friday.
Standing in the way is 6-
foot-3-inch middle blocker
Zoe Nightingale. The sopho
more has led the Bruin
defense this season, recording
75 blocks on the year. Junior
outside Flitter Kelly Reeves
and senior Bojana Todorovic
have contributed to the defen
sive effort, accounting for 121
and 196 digs respectively, but
the Stanford offense will not
be able to merely overpower
UCLA with its basic attack as
they have other some oppo
nents throughout the season.

Senior outside Hitter Tabi
Love has led the way for the

Bruin offense this season. The
Minnesota transfer who
earned All-Pac-12 honorable
mention honors last season has
led UCLA with 224 kills at 4.07
kills per set this season. She is
certainly making a convincing
bid for the All-Pac-12 team this
year, recording a solid .345 hit
ting percentage. But Love is
merely the leader of what has
been a balanced Bruin attack
throughout the season.
Stanford will try to keep
the momentum rolling this
weekend and stretch the win
ning streak to 13 games.
Tonight's match tips at 7 p.m.
from Maples Pavilion and will
be televised on the Pac-12
Networks.
