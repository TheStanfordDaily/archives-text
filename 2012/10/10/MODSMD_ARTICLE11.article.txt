# Card's depth to be tested at ND
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
For the first time all season,
injuries were the theme when
Stanford head coach David Shaw
addressed the media on Monday.
The biggest news was that sopho
more wide receiver Ty
Montgomery will likely miss the
Cardinal's game at Notre Dame
with a lower leg injury suffered
against Arizona. Montgomery is
the fastest player on the entire
Stanford squad, according to Shaw,
but is having a disappointing sea
son with just 18 catches for 168
yards through the first five games.
Assuming Montgomery does
miss the game against the Irish,
senior Jamal-Rashad Patterson
will start in his place. Cardinal fans
have been waiting four years for
Patterson to finally break out of his
shell, and Shaw believes that
Patterson is ready after shedding
weight during his time with the
track team.
The two other pieces of injury
news are positive for Stanford, as
Shaw announced that he expects
both junior running back Anthony
Wilkerson and senior cornerback
Terrence Brown to play. Wilkerson
seems to be almost a lock to return
from his lower leg injury suffered
against USC after practicing on
Monday night. Brown is a bit more
up in the air after being kicked in
the head by a hurdling ball carrier
against Arizona. With the head

injury, Shaw indicated he would
leave the final decision up to the
doctors, but he is optimistic Brown
will play.
Two true freshmen have gotten
themselves into the rotation over
the last two weeks, wide receiver
Kodi Whitfield and defensive end
Aziz Shittu, which is a rare change
for this far into the season. Shittu's
first action came last Saturday
against the Wildcats, though Shaw
told the media that he had been
planning on using the speedy line
man for a few weeks now. He pro
vides tremendous athleticism for a
defensive lineman, which is a
major reason why he saw his first
action against Arizona's high
tempo offense.
Based on this week's updated
depth chart, Shittu may have done
enough to warrant a spot in the
rotation for weeks to come, replac
ing sophomore Charlie Hopkins as
senior Ben Gardner's backup.
Other notable moves include jun
ior A.J. Tarpley's ascent back to a
starting role, now listed as a co
starter with sophomore James
Vaughters at inside linebacker
after starting the Arizona game.
Due to the Montgomery injury,
a trio of freshmen wide receivers
will make their first appearance on
the depth chart this week.
Whitfield now joins sophomore
Kelsey Young as a backup to sen
ior Drew Terrell at the number one

With wide receiver Ty Montgomery unlikely to play against Notre Dame
on Saturday due to injury, fellow sophomore Kelsey Young (39) is set to
see action as the backup to senior Drew Terrell at the position.
