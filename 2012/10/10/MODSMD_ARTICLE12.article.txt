## LETTER TO THE EDITOR Alcohol and relationship abuse 
### 
We at the Office of Alcohol
Policy and Education
(OAPE) were thrilled to see
our educational initiatives discussed
in the Sept. 27 article "OAPE to host
freshman alcohol outreach talks."
One aspect that we wanted to
share that was not represented in the
article is the new approach and collab
oration we've initiated with the Office
of Sexual Assault and Relationship
Abuse Education & Response
(SARA). Our goal is to show how
deeply related these two issues are
and, at the same time, how fundamen
tally separate they are. To that end we
have enhanced a number of our initia
tives. We've added a module to
AlcoholEdu, our online course that all
incoming students are required to
complete prior to arriving on to cam
pus, which includes education and pol
icy messaging about sexual assault.
We've partnered with the SARA
Office to produce our freshman out
reach presentation, "The Social Zone,"
which now includes messaging about
individual and collective responsibility
with regards to alcohol, sexual vio
lence and relationship abuse. During
this talk we use activities, scenarios
and discussion to get students to think
critically about what it means to be an
active part of a community that looks
out for each and every one of its mem
bers and does not stand idly by when
there is a potential threat.
Our offices are also working togeth
er to engage the campus through town
hall meetings, guest speakers and
events that look at each of these
issues through a different lens in
order to reach students in ways that
make these issues relevant to them.
This partnership came out of feed
back from students about the percep
tion that alcohol and sexual violence
often go hand in hand. Our goal is to
show students how intricate that rela
tionship is by dissecting it to show
that there can be a relationship.
But correlation does not equal
causation. We look at alcohol and sex
ual violence separately, and then we
talk about the ways in which the two
are related and how that is unneces

sarily perpetuated through popular
media. On average, at least 50% of
college students' sexual assaults are
associated with alcohol use (Abbey et
al, 1996a, 1998; Copenhaver and
Grauerholz, 1991; Harrington and
Leitenberg, 1994; Koss, 1988). Within
the study's nationally represented
sample of college students, the results
found that 74% of perpetrators and
55% of rape victims had been drink
ing alcohol prior to the assault.
It is important to look at how
these issues play out in our culture
through television, movies, music and
digital media, so that we can under
stand how expectations of the college
experience are often influenced by
various forms of media. These expec
tations often influence the behavior
of college students, so this conversa
tion sets the stage for deeper discus
sion on life at Stanford.
We hope to give our students
tools to act when they see a peer in
danger and to hold one another
accountable for alcohol misuse, sexu
al violence and relationship abuse.
We hope students come away
equipped with the language to hold
someone accountable for his or her
behavior or to support a survivor of
abuse or assault.
As part of a community, we often
look around and hope that the person
next to us has our best interests in
mind. In order for that to be true, we
all have to be willing to watch out for
those around us too.
