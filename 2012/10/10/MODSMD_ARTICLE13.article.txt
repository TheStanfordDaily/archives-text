# SITTIN' ON THE JOHN
## Cold pizza and an American pastime 
### John Murray 
There we have it, everyone. Another
solid weekend of America's actual
favorite pastime: football.
Saturday saw Stanford come back
from two touchdowns to beat upstart
Arizona in overtime. On Sunday, the
Niners won, Andrew Luck led a last
minute comeback, and I once again
spent an entire day going "Next com
mercial, that's when I'll get up to do my
homework." One phone call to
Domino's later, I knew I wasn't getting
off my couch.
Sometime during my daylong
coma, in between Drew Brees break
ing Johnny Unitas' record and my fifth
slice of pepperoni, it hit me: you know
what, I'm having more fun watching
today's games than I did yesterday
actually attending the game. Sure,
nothing I can do in the comfort of my
room can recreate the fun of tailgating,
but the simple act of watching football
is much better at home.
I had a great time on Saturday, yes.
But sitting there on Sunday, I realized a
few things:
1.1 really hate standing up for long
periods of time. Especially when I have
to roll my ass out of bed at 9 in the
morning to pound a few beers before a
noon game (really, who thought a noon
game on homecoming weekend was a
good idea?).
2.1 also really hate yelling for long
periods of time.
3. And I also really miss that yellow
line on the TV that tells where my
team needs to get to for the first down.
In between a few Sunday games, I
was glancing back at an old Rolling
Stone issue and found an article on the
relationship between network televi
sion and the National Football League.
It discussed how TV has drastically
changed the game of football, trying to
turn it, as the title of the article sug
gests, into "more show than game."
The article cites a 2010 study by The
Wall Street Journal that found that the
average amount of time the ball is in
play during a typical NFL game is only
11 minutes, "meaning the networks'
main challenge has always been figur
ing out how to make those other 174
minutes exciting." They do this, as the
article reports, through infinite replays,
close-up shots of coaches and fans, pre
packaged stories, charts, graphs and of
course, commercials.
The networks are also assisted by

the NFL itself, through various rules
that encourage more offense and strict
salary caps and revenue sharing that
keep competition fairly level, as well as
a 16-game schedule (compared to bas
ketball's 82 or baseball's 162) that
makes every game that much more
important. None of this is solely meant
to make the game more entertaining,
but it certainly does.

I feel like this should have hurt: this
realization that I have succumbed to the
simple pleasures of being a coach pota
to, and that the market forces of net
work football are only keeping me put,
tickling my simplest desires and under
cutting my passion for the sport by over
saturating me with arbitrary facts and
statistics. It should have hurt that I had
an analyst and play-by-play commenta
tor constantly telling me what's happen
ing and what it means so I don't have to
think all that much, replaying every
damn play in three different speeds,
from four different angles, to the point
where my favorite players are nothing
more than collections of slow motion
sequences, season-long statistics and
fantasy football points. This idea that
what I was enjoying wasn't just the
game or the team, but in part were the
ways in which the game was being pack
aged: that should've hurt.
So much about watching football
and being a part of a football fan base is
being at the actual games, being sur
rounded by people all lathered in the
same color, screaming your voice
hoarse with thousands of other fans
in other words, being a part of some
thing that's bigger than yourself It takes
effort, and not even that much of it.
Yet through my own weakness, and
at the urging of the networks' powers
that be, I see myself becoming less of a
fan and more of a consumer, one who
is content with the ease of watching,
rather than participating, taking in sta
tistics and commercials and replays
and having to give nothing in return
but my limited attention.
It should hurt, but truthfully it didn't.
I'm not so certain that I know what that
means. All I know is that come Monday
night, I still had a few cold slices of pizza
left, so I turned on the Jets-Texans game
and ate myself to sleep.

where my favorite players are nothing
more than collections of slow motion
sequences, season-long statistics and
fantasy football points. This idea that
what I was enjoying wasn't just the
game or the team, but in part were the
ways in which the game was being pack
aged: that should've hurt.
So much about watching football
and being a part of a football fan base is
being at the actual games, being sur
rounded by people all lathered in the
same color, screaming your voice
hoarse with thousands of other fans
in other words, being a part of some
thing that's bigger than yourself It takes
effort, and not even that much of it.
Yet through my own weakness, and
at the urging of the networks' powers
that be, I see myself becoming less of a
fan and more of a consumer, one who
is content with the ease of watching,
rather than participating, taking in sta
tistics and commercials and replays
and having to give nothing in return
but my limited attention.
It should hurt, but truthfully it didn't.
I'm not so certain that I know what that
means. All I know is that come Monday
night, I still had a few cold slices of pizza
left, so I turned on the Jets-Texans game
and ate myself to sleep.

There we have it, everyone. Another
solid weekend of America's actual
favorite pastime: football.
Saturday saw Stanford come back
from two touchdowns to beat upstart
Arizona in overtime. On Sunday, the
Niners won, Andrew Luck led a last
minute comeback, and I once again
spent an entire day going "Next com
mercial, that's when I'll get up to do my
homework." One phone call to
Domino's later, I knew I wasn't getting
off my couch.
Sometime during my daylong
coma, in between Drew Brees break
ing Johnny Unitas' record and my fifth
slice of pepperoni, it hit me: you know
what, I'm having more fun watching
today's games than I did yesterday
actually attending the game. Sure,
nothing I can do in the comfort of my
room can recreate the fun of tailgating,
but the simple act of watching football
is much better at home.
I had a great time on Saturday, yes.
But sitting there on Sunday, I realized a
few things:
1.1 really hate standing up for long
periods of time. Especially when I have
to roll my ass out of bed at 9 in the
morning to pound a few beers before a
noon game (really, who thought a noon
game on homecoming weekend was a
good idea?).
2.1 also really hate yelling for long
periods of time.
3. And I also really miss that yellow
line on the TV that tells where my
team needs to get to for the first down.
In between a few Sunday games, I
was glancing back at an old Rolling
Stone issue and found an article on the
relationship between network televi
sion and the National Football League.
It discussed how TV has drastically
changed the game of football, trying to
turn it, as the title of the article sug
gests, into "more show than game."
The article cites a 2010 study by The
Wall Street Journal that found that the
average amount of time the ball is in
play during a typical NFL game is only
11 minutes, "meaning the networks'
main challenge has always been figur
ing out how to make those other 174
minutes exciting." They do this, as the
article reports, through infinite replays,
close-up shots of coaches and fans, pre
packaged stories, charts, graphs and of
course, commercials.
The networks are also assisted by

the NFL itself, through various rules
that encourage more offense and strict
salary caps and revenue sharing that
keep competition fairly level, as well as
a 16-game schedule (compared to bas
ketball's 82 or baseball's 162) that
makes every game that much more
important. None of this is solely meant
to make the game more entertaining,
but it certainly does.

I feel like this should have hurt: this
realization that I have succumbed to the
simple pleasures of being a coach pota
to, and that the market forces of net
work football are only keeping me put,
tickling my simplest desires and under
cutting my passion for the sport by over
saturating me with arbitrary facts and
statistics. It should have hurt that I had
an analyst and play-by-play commenta
tor constantly telling me what's happen
ing and what it means so I don't have to
think all that much, replaying every
damn play in three different speeds,
from four different angles, to the point
where my favorite players are nothing
more than collections of slow motion
sequences, season-long statistics and
fantasy football points. This idea that
what I was enjoying wasn't just the
game or the team, but in part were the
ways in which the game was being pack
aged: that should've hurt.
