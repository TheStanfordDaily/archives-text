## Signs and Stanford: leaving a mark 
### Renée Donovan 
I have a thing for signs. Street signs,
flyers, restaurant specials they
strike me as secret messages post
ed so conspicuously we often miss
their meaning. Last year I took some
time off school to study dance in New
York, and I fell in love with the city's
signs.

On the southwest corner of
Lafayette and Astor Place, there is a
sign by a Halal food truck: "Call for
pick-up. We make all kind sandwich.
Signed, David." On East 7th there is a
tiny placard hidden between the
doorbells of a grungy residential
walk-up advertising, "Dentist: A5."
The doorbells do not go past A3. I
passed a note in red spray paint by
Tompkins Square Park: "Dear Helen
I love you and need you. Please
forgive me." Two days later I found
the same red spray paint in the neigh
borhood of the first note: "Helen is
heartless bitch. She deserves to be
lonely." A large notice in an Italian
restaurant in SoHo shouts, "Eat Fast.
We Need the Table. You Choke, We
do Heimlich."

I was reminded of New York's sig
nage when I went to fill my water bot
tle outside the Bender room at Green
and saw a piece of white printer paper
proclaiming, in large black typeface,
"Beware of Old Faithful." I always
mistrusted that water fountain, and
apparently I wasn't alone. In the win
dow of a ground-floor dorm room at
Suites there is another piece of print
er paper, this one warning, "F.Y.I. I
can hear all your conversations when
you stand outside my window. Yes,
even if you whisper." Even the con
spicuous "Please Don't Touch the
Clock" warning in the Lane reading
room seems pregnant with meaning
why the courtesy, why the casual
contraction in so formal a message?

I recently braved the electric
stress of the East Wing stacks to
investigate a different kind of signs
the notes scrawled on cubicle walls
from one anonymous student to
another. I found "I love Harry."
Beneath it, Harry was crossed out and
replaced with "Shelly," then "Sarah,"
then "him." There was "My boyfriend
is a douchebag :(" and next to it, "My
girlfriend is amazing." Several times I
found "Fuck School," and many "You
can do it" or similar notes to the same
effect. Hidden in a corner by a win
dow I found "No on prop. 19 Nov.
2, 2010" with the responses "Prick"
and "Light one up."
My personal favorite, on a desk
near the stairwell, was a solitary note:
"Why is nothing written here?"

These anonymous penciled exchanges
pull something in me taut. They defy
temporal boundaries, community
divides and the myth that Stanford
students have it all together. They
show a level of care at a school that
can sometimes feel too busy to care. I
admit I fall prey to Narrative, and use
questionable alchemy to make mean
ing of accidental words. I'm sure
"Why is nothing written here" is
nothing more than the sum of its
parts. Still, I like to think of it as a stu
dent's code that really means "Why
does this school feel vast and lonely?"

In Absalom, Absalom, William
Faulkner defies the narrative instinct
to which I have succumbed. "You
make so little impression," he
reminds us. But even he, the tortured
realist, proposes a solution:
"Maybe if you could go to someone,
the stranger the better, and give them
something —a scrap of paper...at
least it would be something just
because it would have happened, be
remembered even if only passing
from one hand to another, one mind
to another, and it would be at least a
scratch."
The randomness of the world calls
for the posting of thousands of signs
each day in a mark-making endeav
or. The writing and reading of those
signs serves as a mutual acknowledg
ment, a hat tipped to a stranger to
remind him he is real. Helen may be
a heartless bitch, a girl's boyfriend
might be a douchebag. It is a willing
ness to share and the patience to lis
ten that softens the blows of frustra
tion and regret, that eases the loneli
ness of experience. A scratch, a note,
a word, a mark.
