## Batteer named men's soccer Pac-12 Player of the Week 
### â€“ Tom Taylor 
After scoring twice to lead the Stanford
men's soccer team to victory against cross-bay
rival California last Thursday, sophomore for
ward Zach Batteer was named Pac-12 Player of
the Week yesterday.

The USA UlB National Team member and
Pittsburgh, Penn., native scored just one goal in
his first season on the Farm, but bumped this

year's tally up to three. Batteer also hit the back
of the net in the Card's win over San Diego
State two weekends ago.

His goals on both sides of halftime against
Berkeley extended the Cardinal's winning
streak over the Bears to the last three games,
and gave Stanford plenty of confidence with
two straight conference victories before heading
out on the road this weekend to face Oregon
State on Friday and Washington on Sunday.
