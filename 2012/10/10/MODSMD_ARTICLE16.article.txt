## Sex Diary PART II 
### 
It wasn't until the words dropped out of my mouth that I
realized I was scared. But locked in a closed room with
someone I had just accused of rape, I could process no
other reaction.
This isn't a story about rape. Creepy Hot Guy did not
rape me he didn't try. After he vaguely answered that "no
charges were filed," he was meticulously careful to not assert
himself onto me. Like someone suspected of alcoholism
who politely sips at a glass of wine, he sat with determined
restraint.
It was up to me. What ensued was not a "no means yes"
or a concession to my own sexual wanting, but rather a men
tal and physical back-and-forth. My mental determination
against sex with this relative stranger would give way to my
sexual certainty in what became a stopping and starting of
sexual momentum. And yes, he stopped when I asked him to.
We didn't have sex, then or ever. The words I used to
describe why we wouldn't, why I "couldn't" were something
like not being "that kind of person." When I finally gave a
firm answer, he said I should leave, and I did.
I still want him. I still fantasize about him, want to see
him walking on Escondido or turning down Mayfield in his
car. But I didn't let myself have him because I was afraid of
what type of person it would make me.
Regardless of whether it was my own weakness or
inability to overcome what was expected of me, the reality is
that at Stanford and in general, the expectations and
imposed restrictions oftentimes imposed by peers and peo
ple our own age guide our actions.
I've told five people about this event in the time prior,
during and after this anti-climactic exchange, and a handful
more answered inquiries I had about him or generally
"sketchy" guys at Stanford. Four of the five and all those I
asked told me to stay away from him. And this is what I
wrestled with.They, without any official confirmation of
CHG's involvement in any sexual assault, imperatively for
bid that I continue any form of communication with him, let
alone allow myself a sexual desire. No one ever said, "it's your

choice" or "go for it" They said, "You should stop talking to
him" or "Don't do it"
Regardless of whether or not my sexual interest
piqued prior to discovering the rumors in someone with
a questionable past was unusual, or "wrong," or even
"deviant," in every instance I expressed a want that was con
demned. Consensual sex with this man was something to
fear, to avoid at all costs.
The judgment was made for me and against me that I
could not want him. Yes, the possibility of his involvement
in sexual assault complicates the situation. Yes, I acknowl
edge and continue to feel shame that I wanted him despite
this fact.
Even so, the absurdity of my taboo sexual desire is far
less absurd than the fantasy that there are safe and open
spaces to talk about sex at Stanford. People could only con
ceive of me as a victim, and to avoid appearing as a victim,
or even a harlot, I cut all communication with the accused
and held my tongue about myself.
Even on this "progressive" and "accepting" campus, I
was forced to choose between wearing a scarlet letter and
concealing my own emotional turmoil. There's no safe space
to say, "I'm attracted to a man accused of rape."
I could not talk to anyone about it. I still cannot. The
dialogue that occurred over part one of this story, both
online and remarks I've heard, has only confirmed this.
People judged me based on my feelings toward CHG, pre
cluding any real or meaningful discussion about whyl felt
the way I felt, or how I was handling this situation.
That's it. I didn't do anything. I wasn't raped and I
didn't have any type of sex. Yet the shame and embarrass
ment I felt then, and still feel over my lingering sexual regret,
are not acceptable topics of discussion. The most vocal crit
ics condemn me for having an emotion, for being confused
about a volatile sexual encounter and desire.
This account is the second part of the first Sex Diary, "The
Cardinal Letter.
