# Construction on art museum begins
## 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
A groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday
afternoon marked the start of construction on
the museum building that will eventually house
the Anderson Collection, "one of the most out
standing private collections of 20th century
American art in the world" according to
University Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
The collection was donated to Stanford by
the Anderson family: Harry "Hunk" W.
Anderson, Mary "Moo" Margaret Anderson and
their daughter Mary "Putter" Patricia Anderson
Pence. The Andersons, along with Provost
Etchemendy, held gold-plated shovels at the cer
emony to break ground for the new building.

Ennead Architects, the firm that designed the
Cantor Arts Center extension in 1998, the
Stanford Law School William H. Neukom
Building in 2011 and the Bing Concert Hall,
which is scheduled for completion in January
2013, also designed the 33,327-square-foot
Anderson Collection building. Current designs
depict a two-story building split into three differ
ent parts, with open space exhibition of the col
lection's pieces. The architects designed the exte
rior to complement the neighboring Cantor Arts
Center and surrounding landscape. The Board of
Trustees approved the design in June 2012.
The new building is expected to cost approx
imately $30.5 million and will be open to the
public in 2014. It will be located north of the

Cantor Arts Center, at the corner of Lomita
Drive and Campus Drive,

The Anderson collection is the culmination
of over 50 years of finding and purchasing art.
According to Etchemendy, the Andersons asked
themselves "Have we seen it before, and could
we have thought of it?" when considering pur
chasing a new piece of art. This strategy resulted
in a collection containing 121 works by 86 post-
World War II American artists such as Jackson
Pollock, Wayne Thiebaud and Franz Kline.

"This collection is one of the most valuable
and significant to be donated to any University,
and it is unparalleled in Stanford's 127-year his
tory," Etchemendy said. "It's almost impossible
to describe the profound effect that this gift of

their collection will have on Stanford."
Roberta Denning M.S. '75, wife of Steven
Denning, the chair of the Board of Trustees,
expressed her hope that the collection will "dis
solve the outdated boundaries between the arts
and other disciplines" and make famous works
of art more accessible to Stanford students.
"An encounter with Pollock's drips and
Rothko's reds will be a short bike ride away from
the freshman dorm," Denning said.
Alexander Nemerov, provostial professor of
arts and humanities, who spoke at the ground
breaking ceremony, said the Anderson
Collection and the rest of the Arts District,'
which will include the Cantor
Arts Center, the Bing Concert
Hall and the McMurtry
Building, will be a source of
inspiration for Stanford's stu
dents of the arts.
"Any such extraordinary
addition to what is available to
Stanford students must give
them that much more of a
chance to succeed in their lives,
to seek their highest aspira
tions and truly to make a mark
on the world," Nemerov said.
Nemerov used one of the

collection's most notable
pieces, Jackson Pollock's
"Lucifer," as an example of a
piece that will stimulate discus
sion and encourage a deeper
analysis of art.
"[The Andersons] have
given to Stanford, in this one
painting, one of Shakespeare's
sentences," Nemerov said.
"That's the import of what
we're here to honor and cele
brate."
Members of the Anderson
family expressed gratitude to
Stanford officials, particularly
University President John
Hennessey, for giving their col
lection a home. The Andersons
said that they had always con
sidered themselves custodians

of the works and wanted a
place where the collection
could be viewed and appreciat
ed on an international scale.
"Thank you Stanford
University for making our
dreams come true," a teary
Mary Patricia Anderson Pence
said.
Mary Margaret Anderson
noted that their donation to
Stanford was "closing the cir
cle" of a journey that started
when the Andersons began
collecting art and sought the
guidance of late Stanford pro
fessor and leading art historian
Albert Elsen.
The Andersons took
Elsen's class, Art 101, which
"gave [them] the fuel to go on
and really look at art," accord
ing to Mary Margaret. Elsen
often visited the Anderson
home to evaluate art they had
purchased and give them
advice. Though he died in 1995,
Mary Margaret credited him
for helping them assemble a
collection that "enriched
[their] lives."
In his speech at the cere
mony, Harry Anderson
thanked Burt McMurtry,
namesake of the McMurtry
Building, for "reopening dis
cussion" with the Andersons in
2004 about donating art. Harry
echoed his wife's belief that
the collection belongs at
Stanford.
"During the past eight to 10
years, the Andersons began to
feel as if the collection is not
just for the Andersons, it is for
the world," Harry Anderson
said. "Stanford is really the
place for it to be."

"That's the import of what
we're here to honor and cele
brate."
Members of the Anderson
family expressed gratitude to
Stanford officials, particularly
University President John
Hennessey, for giving their col
lection a home. The Andersons
said that they had always con
sidered themselves custodians

of the works and wanted a
place where the collection
could be viewed and appreciat
ed on an international scale.
"Thank you Stanford
University for making our
dreams come true," a teary
Mary Patricia Anderson Pence
said.
Mary Margaret Anderson
noted that their donation to
Stanford was "closing the cir
cle" of a journey that started
when the Andersons began
collecting art and sought the
guidance of late Stanford pro
fessor and leading art historian
Albert Elsen.
The Andersons took
Elsen's class, Art 101, which
"gave [them] the fuel to go on
and really look at art," accord
ing to Mary Margaret. Elsen
often visited the Anderson
home to evaluate art they had
purchased and give them
advice. Though he died in 1995,
Mary Margaret credited him
for helping them assemble a
collection that "enriched
[their] lives."
In his speech at the cere
mony, Harry Anderson
thanked Burt McMurtry,
namesake of the McMurtry
Building, for "reopening dis
cussion" with the Andersons in
2004 about donating art. Harry
echoed his wife's belief that
the collection belongs at
Stanford.
"During the past eight to 10
years, the Andersons began to
feel as if the collection is not
just for the Andersons, it is for
the world," Harry Anderson
said. "Stanford is really the
place for it to be."

The Bing Concert Hall, set to open this fall, will be a part
of a new "Arts District" at Stanford, which will also include
a museum for the Anderson Collection, the Cantor Arts
Center and the McMurtry Building.
A groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday
afternoon marked the start of construction on
the museum building that will eventually house
the Anderson Collection, "one of the most out
standing private collections of 20th century
American art in the world" according to
University Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2.
The collection was donated to Stanford by
the Anderson family: Harry "Hunk" W.
Anderson, Mary "Moo" Margaret Anderson and
their daughter Mary "Putter" Patricia Anderson
Pence. The Andersons, along with Provost
Etchemendy, held gold-plated shovels at the cer
emony to break ground for the new building.

Ennead Architects, the firm that designed the
Cantor Arts Center extension in 1998, the
Stanford Law School William H. Neukom
Building in 2011 and the Bing Concert Hall,
which is scheduled for completion in January
2013, also designed the 33,327-square-foot
Anderson Collection building. Current designs
depict a two-story building split into three differ
ent parts, with open space exhibition of the col
lection's pieces. The architects designed the exte
rior to complement the neighboring Cantor Arts
Center and surrounding landscape. The Board of
Trustees approved the design in June 2012.
The new building is expected to cost approx
imately $30.5 million and will be open to the
public in 2014. It will be located north of the

Cantor Arts Center, at the corner of Lomita
Drive and Campus Drive,

The Anderson collection is the culmination
of over 50 years of finding and purchasing art.
According to Etchemendy, the Andersons asked
themselves "Have we seen it before, and could
we have thought of it?" when considering pur
chasing a new piece of art. This strategy resulted
in a collection containing 121 works by 86 post-
World War II American artists such as Jackson
Pollock, Wayne Thiebaud and Franz Kline.

"This collection is one of the most valuable
and significant to be donated to any University,
and it is unparalleled in Stanford's 127-year his
tory," Etchemendy said. "It's almost impossible
to describe the profound effect that this gift of

their collection will have on Stanford."
Roberta Denning M.S. '75, wife of Steven
Denning, the chair of the Board of Trustees,
expressed her hope that the collection will "dis
solve the outdated boundaries between the arts
and other disciplines" and make famous works
of art more accessible to Stanford students.
"An encounter with Pollock's drips and
Rothko's reds will be a short bike ride away from
the freshman dorm," Denning said.
Alexander Nemerov, provostial professor of
arts and humanities, who spoke at the ground
breaking ceremony, said the Anderson
Collection and the rest of the Arts District,'
which will include the Cantor
Arts Center, the Bing Concert
Hall and the McMurtry
Building, will be a source of
inspiration for Stanford's stu
dents of the arts.
"Any such extraordinary
addition to what is available to
Stanford students must give
them that much more of a
chance to succeed in their lives,
to seek their highest aspira
tions and truly to make a mark
on the world," Nemerov said.
Nemerov used one of the

collection's most notable
pieces, Jackson Pollock's
"Lucifer," as an example of a
piece that will stimulate discus
sion and encourage a deeper
analysis of art.
"[The Andersons] have
given to Stanford, in this one
painting, one of Shakespeare's
sentences," Nemerov said.
"That's the import of what
we're here to honor and cele
brate."
