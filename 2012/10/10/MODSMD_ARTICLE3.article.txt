## STUDENT GOVERNMENT Senate to accelerate ARP discussion 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
ASSU senators discussed student life and aca
demic affairs committee goals for the year, retroac
tively approved $5OO in funding to the Class of 2013
for hosting the Row Tailgate on Sept. 27 and agreed
to accelerate the timeline for discussing the
Alternative Review Process (ARP) at the Oct. 9
Undergraduate Senate meeting.
Though Senate Deputy Chair Garima Sharma
'l5 stated at last week's meeting that the Senate
would discuss attendance policies this week, they did

not do so.
Senators received previous notice of two bills to
vote on next week, one to approve the ASSU 2013
election dates April 11 to April 13 and the
other to expel Ashley Harris 'l5 from the Senate
after she confirmed that she is taking a leave of
absence.
Senators also agreed to begin discussion of the
ARP, Stanford's current policy on sexual assault or
violence cases, next week after learning that it was
not on the agenda for the Faculty Senate. Academic
Affairs Chair Shahab Fadavi 'l5 said he spoke with

Assistant Academic Secretary Trish Del Pozzo, an
administrator on the Faculty Senate, who said that it
is "tradition" for the Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council to make a recommenda
tion on campus issues affecting all students, such as
the ARP, before the Faculty Senate discusses them.
"The ARP and the way we approach it is proba
bly going to be the single largest task that the
Undergraduate Senate will receive this year," Fadavi
said. "It is important for us to get the debate going

goal of bringing together various student activists on campus. Attendees participated in bonding activities and discussed coalition building.
once again so we can feel confi
dent in making a recommenda
tion to the Faculty Senate."
President Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 and Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 announced their
plan to hold two town hall-style
meetings to distribute informa
tion and answer questions
about the ARP on Oct. 23 and
24. The Oct. 23 meeting will be
geared toward undergraduate
students and the Oct. 24 meet
ing towards graduate students.
"It's going to be a great time
to start that dialogue. It is a real
ly difficult and complex issue
and we have to consider it very
thoroughly," Zimbroff said.
"We are going to do outreach
and try to get people from
across campus."
Voting on the allocation of
$3,000 in funding from the
Traditions Fund to Mausoleum,
an annual Halloween party, had
to be delayed after junior class
presidents Ashley Williams 'l4
and Mary Raddawi 'l4 said
they would have to request an

additional $2,500 in funding,
bringing the total for the party
to $5,500. The extra funding
would be used for barricades
that cannot be provided by
campus security because of a
football game the next day.
As a part of discussions on
student life and academic affairs,
Senate Communications Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5 expressed inter
est in creating a charter organi
zation connecting independent
artists that would "represent
[artists] as a body" and make it
easier for them to negotiate
practice space.
"[Musicians are currently]
using spaces that they are not
technically allowed to use," he
said.
"Every week someone
comes up to me and Viraj
[Bindra] and poses the problem
of the lack of space for student
bands to play and practice,"
Fadavi said. "We want to make
sure that as the Senate, as the
student voice, we contribute
whatever needs to be con
tributed."
Nanci Howe, associate dean
and director of student activi
ties and leadership, suggested
combining Bindra's idea with
several projects currently

underway to create arts spaces
in different residences.
"There is a lot of interest at
the university for addressing
and solving these issues," she
said.
Fadavi also announced that the
academic affairs committee has
reached out to Undergraduate
Advising and Research to negoti
ate the process of petitioning to
take over 20 units a quarter. He
said the committee will look
into the creation of an option in
Axess that would allow a stu
dent to sign up for more than 20
units during the course shop
ping period.
"The way it is set up now
involves a lot of bureaucracy," he
said. "We want to see whether it
would be possible to reduce the
amount of bureaucracy and
make it more simplified."
Senators also discussed
transportation options for foot
ball games and continuing
ASSU outreach to freshman
dorms.
Senator Christos Haveles 'l5
and Appropriations Committee
Chair Nancy Pham 'l4 were
absent.

Voting on the allocation of
$3,000 in funding from the
Traditions Fund to Mausoleum,
an annual Halloween party, had
to be delayed after junior class
presidents Ashley Williams 'l4
and Mary Raddawi 'l4 said
they would have to request an

additional $2,500 in funding,
bringing the total for the party
to $5,500. The extra funding
would be used for barricades
that cannot be provided by
campus security because of a
football game the next day.
As a part of discussions on
student life and academic affairs,
Senate Communications Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5 expressed inter
est in creating a charter organi
zation connecting independent
artists that would "represent
[artists] as a body" and make it
easier for them to negotiate
practice space.
"[Musicians are currently]
using spaces that they are not
technically allowed to use," he
said.
"Every week someone
comes up to me and Viraj
[Bindra] and poses the problem
of the lack of space for student
bands to play and practice,"
Fadavi said. "We want to make
sure that as the Senate, as the
student voice, we contribute
whatever needs to be con
tributed."
Nanci Howe, associate dean
and director of student activi
ties and leadership, suggested
combining Bindra's idea with
several projects currently

underway to create arts spaces
in different residences.
"There is a lot of interest at
the university for addressing
and solving these issues," she
said.
Fadavi also announced that the
academic affairs committee has
reached out to Undergraduate
Advising and Research to negoti
ate the process of petitioning to
take over 20 units a quarter. He
said the committee will look
into the creation of an option in
Axess that would allow a stu
dent to sign up for more than 20
units during the course shop
ping period.
"The way it is set up now
involves a lot of bureaucracy," he
said. "We want to see whether it
would be possible to reduce the
amount of bureaucracy and
make it more simplified."
Senators also discussed
transportation options for foot
ball games and continuing
ASSU outreach to freshman
dorms.
Senator Christos Haveles 'l5
and Appropriations Committee
Chair Nancy Pham 'l4 were

ASSU senators discussed student life and aca
demic affairs committee goals for the year, retroac
tively approved $5OO in funding to the Class of 2013
for hosting the Row Tailgate on Sept. 27 and agreed
to accelerate the timeline for discussing the
Alternative Review Process (ARP) at the Oct. 9
Undergraduate Senate meeting.
Though Senate Deputy Chair Garima Sharma
'l5 stated at last week's meeting that the Senate
would discuss attendance policies this week, they did

not do so.
Senators received previous notice of two bills to
vote on next week, one to approve the ASSU 2013
election dates April 11 to April 13 and the
other to expel Ashley Harris 'l5 from the Senate
after she confirmed that she is taking a leave of
absence.
Senators also agreed to begin discussion of the
ARP, Stanford's current policy on sexual assault or
violence cases, next week after learning that it was
not on the agenda for the Faculty Senate. Academic
Affairs Chair Shahab Fadavi 'l5 said he spoke with

Assistant Academic Secretary Trish Del Pozzo, an
administrator on the Faculty Senate, who said that it
is "tradition" for the Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council to make a recommenda
tion on campus issues affecting all students, such as
the ARP, before the Faculty Senate discusses them.
"The ARP and the way we approach it is proba
bly going to be the single largest task that the
Undergraduate Senate will receive this year," Fadavi
said. "It is important for us to get the debate going

President Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 and Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 announced their
plan to hold two town hall-style
meetings to distribute informa
tion and answer questions
about the ARP on Oct. 23 and
24. The Oct. 23 meeting will be
geared toward undergraduate
students and the Oct. 24 meet
ing towards graduate students.
"It's going to be a great time
to start that dialogue. It is a real
ly difficult and complex issue
and we have to consider it very
thoroughly," Zimbroff said.
"We are going to do outreach
and try to get people from
across campus."
