## STUDENT GOVERNMENT Senate to accelerate ARP discussion 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
ASSU senators discussed student life and aca
demic affairs committee goals for the year, retroac
tively approved $5OO in funding to the Class of 2013
for hosting the Row Tailgate on Sept. 27 and agreed
to accelerate the timeline for discussing the
Alternative Review Process (ARP) at the Oct. 9
Undergraduate Senate meeting.
Though Senate Deputy Chair Garima Sharma
'l5 stated at last week's meeting that the Senate
would discuss attendance policies this week, they did

not do so.
Senators received previous notice of two bills to
vote on next week, one to approve the ASSU 2013
election dates April 11 to April 13 and the
other to expel Ashley Harris 'l5 from the Senate
after she confirmed that she is taking a leave of
absence.
Senators also agreed to begin discussion of the
ARP, Stanford's current policy on sexual assault or
violence cases, next week after learning that it was
not on the agenda for the Faculty Senate. Academic
Affairs Chair Shahab Fadavi 'l5 said he spoke with

Assistant Academic Secretary Trish Del Pozzo, an
administrator on the Faculty Senate, who said that it
is "tradition" for the Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council to make a recommenda
tion on campus issues affecting all students, such as
the ARP, before the Faculty Senate discusses them.
"The ARP and the way we approach it is proba
bly going to be the single largest task that the
Undergraduate Senate will receive this year," Fadavi
said. "It is important for us to get the debate going
