## Harris to lose spot in ASSU Senator will not return to Stanford this academic year 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
ASSU Senator Ashley Harris 'l5
will likely lose her place in the
Undergraduate Senate after taking a
leave of absence this year.
Harris, who is reportedly being
treated for meningitis, informed the
Senate via email that she will not be
returning to Stanford this academic
year.
The ASSU Constitution states
that "Senators taking a leave of
absence shall automatically be
expelled from the Undergraduate
Senate if such status is confirmed."
The bill authored by Senator Lauren
Miller 'l5 confirmed that Senator
Harris has indeed taken a leave of
absence.
As per the guidelines of the
Constitution, the senators introduced
the expulsion bill at this week's
Senate meeting before voting occurs
at next week's meeting. Harris gave
up her right to address the Senate.
Senators are currently deliberat
ing about whether or not the open
position will be filled. Although
Miller initially stated that the Senate
would not be replacing Harris, she
reconsidered when Associate Dean
and Director of Student Activities
and Leadership Nanci Howe
informed her that the Senate has a
precedent of replacing absentee sena
tors.
Branden Crouch 'l4, chair of the
Senate, raised the possibility of
contacting the first runner-up
Senate candidate, Joshua
Eisner 'l3.
"I'm not really sure how it
works," Crouch said. "I think
he can say yes or no if he
wants to be on the Senate."
Crouch stated the replace
ment decision will be made at
next week's Senate meeting. If

the Senate decides to add
another senator, the addition
will be made in the next two
weeks. However, Crouch
believes that the Senate will
not have a new member.
"I think we are going to try
to keep 14 [senators]," Crouch
said. "If we do come into a
period when we are in a tie,
the vice president will come in
and break the tie."
Other senators, such as
Kimberly Bacon 'l5, have
offered to take Harris' place
on the Advocacy and Student
Life committees, according to

Crouch.
The Senate is also trying to
determine what will be done
about Harris' payment, as
each senator receives a salary
of $4OO. According to
Assistant Financial Manager
for Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) Stephen
Trusheim 'l3, the money will
be directed to the ASSU
reserve account if the budget
is not adjusted to reflect
Harris' expulsion.
