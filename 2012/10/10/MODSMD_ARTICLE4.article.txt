## Harris to lose spot in ASSU Senator will not return to Stanford this academic year 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
ASSU Senator Ashley Harris 'l5
will likely lose her place in the
Undergraduate Senate after taking a
leave of absence this year.
Harris, who is reportedly being
treated for meningitis, informed the
Senate via email that she will not be
returning to Stanford this academic
year.
The ASSU Constitution states
that "Senators taking a leave of
absence shall automatically be
expelled from the Undergraduate
Senate if such status is confirmed."
The bill authored by Senator Lauren
Miller 'l5 confirmed that Senator
Harris has indeed taken a leave of
absence.
As per the guidelines of the
Constitution, the senators introduced
the expulsion bill at this week's
Senate meeting before voting occurs
at next week's meeting. Harris gave
up her right to address the Senate.
Senators are currently deliberat
ing about whether or not the open
position will be filled. Although
Miller initially stated that the Senate
would not be replacing Harris, she
reconsidered when Associate Dean
and Director of Student Activities
and Leadership Nanci Howe
informed her that the Senate has a
precedent of replacing absentee sena
tors.
