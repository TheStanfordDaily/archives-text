## Taylor, Arrow disagree on economic policies 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of a presidential debate
dominated by discussion of the economy,
Nobel Laureate and Professor Emeritus
Kenneth Arrow discussed the pertinent
economic issues of the day with the
Professor of Economics John Taylor
Ph.D. '73. The discussion was held as a
part of this week's PoliSci 51K: Elections
2012 lecture. The class is a seminar series
being held in the run-up to the 2012 elec
tions and is comprised of 400 Stanford
students and 200 attendees from
Stanford Continuing Studies, as well as
an online audience through iTunes U.
The discussion almost filled Cemex
Auditorium, the largest classroom on
campus.

The two economists engaged in a
freewheeling and disjointed conversation
about a host of issues, ranging from budg
etary concerns to assessments of
American health care. The discussion was

moderated by Jim Styer '7B J.D. 'B3 and
Rob Reich, associate professor of politi
cal science.
An advisor to numerous Republican
presidential administrations and cam
paigns, Taylor spoke first in an event
Reich emphasized was "not organized as
a debate but a dialogue about the econo
my."
Comparing the federal government's
attitude towards change to the intransi
gence of the stubborn parent-teacher
association at his child's school, he assert

being was to remove the incumbent
administration and start anew.
"Our problems are based on policy,"
he argued, going on to argue for "policies
away from short-termism and towards
sustainable growth, addressing education
and the debt."

"We should be concerned with long
term issues," Arrow countered, pointing
