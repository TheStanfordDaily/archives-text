## Taylor, Arrow disagree on economic policies 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
On the heels of a presidential debate
dominated by discussion of the economy,
Nobel Laureate and Professor Emeritus
Kenneth Arrow discussed the pertinent
economic issues of the day with the
Professor of Economics John Taylor
Ph.D. '73. The discussion was held as a
part of this week's PoliSci 51K: Elections
2012 lecture. The class is a seminar series
being held in the run-up to the 2012 elec
tions and is comprised of 400 Stanford
students and 200 attendees from
Stanford Continuing Studies, as well as
an online audience through iTunes U.
The discussion almost filled Cemex
Auditorium, the largest classroom on
campus.

The two economists engaged in a
freewheeling and disjointed conversation
about a host of issues, ranging from budg
etary concerns to assessments of
American health care. The discussion was

moderated by Jim Styer '7B J.D. 'B3 and
Rob Reich, associate professor of politi
cal science.
An advisor to numerous Republican
presidential administrations and cam
paigns, Taylor spoke first in an event
Reich emphasized was "not organized as
a debate but a dialogue about the econo
my."
Comparing the federal government's
attitude towards change to the intransi
gence of the stubborn parent-teacher
association at his child's school, he assert
ed that the best route to economic well
being was to remove the incumbent
administration and start anew.
"Our problems are based on policy,"
he argued, going on to argue for "policies
away from short-termism and towards
sustainable growth, addressing education
and the debt."

"We should be concerned with long
term issues," Arrow countered, pointing

to the difficulties of promoting
proposals with longer time
horizons during an election
season "But the tendency of
any electoral system is to be
comfortable with short-term
issues."
He went on to discuss the
disadvantages of what Obama
opponents see as key fixes,
namely, reductions in govern
ment spending.
"Spending cuts are not
productive," he argued. "The
real problem is the underuti
lization of resources. We can't
cut down what is really an
investment in the future."
After the opening remarks,
the discussion veered to issues
brought up in last week's presi
dential debates. Taylor was reti
cent to comment on specific
issues, such as the particular tax
loopholes that would be closed
under a Romney administra
tion, a contentious matter in last
week's debate. According to the
Washington Post, Taylor is a
frontrunner to be chairman of
the Federal Reserve under a
potential Romney presidency.
Arrow then began a dis
cussion of the need for gov

ernment spending at a time
when interest rates bottom
out, as they did after the 2008
financial crisis.
"The problem with mone
tary policy is that when the
interest rate gets to zero, you
hit a limit. That's what hap
pened in the Great Depression,
and I'm probably the only one
in the room who remembers
that time," joked the 91-year
old Arrow.
Taylor argued in response
that "temporary spending, such
as the stimulus program, peter
out very quickly and do not
give you sustainable growth."
Debating health care for
the elderly, the two held con
trasting views, Taylor being
sympathetic to the idea of a
voucher system for Medicare,
and Arrow opposed.
"Medicare vouchers scare
me very much, as doctors are
already refusing Medicare
patients," Arrow said. "If you
start really trying to control
Medicare in the way [VP
Candidate Paul] Ryan wants
to, or in any way that the con
sumer is the allocator, it's like
depositors managing bank's
security."
The ideological differences
between Taylor and Arrow
were bridged only when dis
cussing the importance of
enhancing the American edu

cational system. Yet, when
pressed for details, few were
offered.
In essence, the two agreed
on the fact that there were a
number of challenges on the
horizon for the US, but could
hardly find a middle ground
on which to base their solu
tions. However, Professor
Taylor commented that it was
essential not to let these diver
gences preclude progress from
being made in these areas and
foster partisanship and antipa
thy towards the other side.
"Partisanship occurs when
you don't like the other guy's
idea just because it's from the
other guy and that's what we
have to get away from," he
said.
The reaction from students
to the discussion was mixed,
with some complaining that
the discussion was structured in
too loose a manner to allow for
clear articulations of differing
points of view. Commenting on
the discussion, Maxine Litre 'l5
expressed frustration.
"A lot of Taylor's answers
seemed evasive, and in the
context of an academic setting
it would have been nice for
him to have been a little more
direct in his answers."

On the heels of a presidential debate
dominated by discussion of the economy,
Nobel Laureate and Professor Emeritus
Kenneth Arrow discussed the pertinent
economic issues of the day with the
Professor of Economics John Taylor
Ph.D. '73. The discussion was held as a
part of this week's PoliSci 51K: Elections
2012 lecture. The class is a seminar series
being held in the run-up to the 2012 elec
tions and is comprised of 400 Stanford
students and 200 attendees from
Stanford Continuing Studies, as well as
an online audience through iTunes U.
The discussion almost filled Cemex
Auditorium, the largest classroom on
campus.

The two economists engaged in a
freewheeling and disjointed conversation
about a host of issues, ranging from budg
etary concerns to assessments of
American health care. The discussion was

moderated by Jim Styer '7B J.D. 'B3 and
Rob Reich, associate professor of politi
cal science.
An advisor to numerous Republican
presidential administrations and cam
paigns, Taylor spoke first in an event
Reich emphasized was "not organized as
a debate but a dialogue about the econo
my."
Comparing the federal government's
attitude towards change to the intransi
gence of the stubborn parent-teacher
association at his child's school, he assert
ed that the best route to economic well
being was to remove the incumbent
administration and start anew.
"Our problems are based on policy,"
he argued, going on to argue for "policies
away from short-termism and towards
sustainable growth, addressing education
and the debt."

"We should be concerned with long
term issues," Arrow countered, pointing

to the difficulties of promoting
proposals with longer time
horizons during an election
season "But the tendency of
any electoral system is to be
comfortable with short-term
issues."
He went on to discuss the
disadvantages of what Obama
opponents see as key fixes,
namely, reductions in govern
ment spending.
"Spending cuts are not
productive," he argued. "The
real problem is the underuti
lization of resources. We can't
cut down what is really an
investment in the future."
After the opening remarks,
the discussion veered to issues
brought up in last week's presi
dential debates. Taylor was reti
cent to comment on specific
issues, such as the particular tax
loopholes that would be closed
under a Romney administra
tion, a contentious matter in last
week's debate. According to the
Washington Post, Taylor is a
frontrunner to be chairman of
the Federal Reserve under a
potential Romney presidency.
Arrow then began a dis
cussion of the need for gov

ernment spending at a time
when interest rates bottom
out, as they did after the 2008
financial crisis.
"The problem with mone
tary policy is that when the
interest rate gets to zero, you
hit a limit. That's what hap
pened in the Great Depression,
and I'm probably the only one
in the room who remembers
that time," joked the 91-year
old Arrow.
Taylor argued in response
that "temporary spending, such
as the stimulus program, peter
out very quickly and do not
give you sustainable growth."
Debating health care for
the elderly, the two held con
trasting views, Taylor being
sympathetic to the idea of a
voucher system for Medicare,
and Arrow opposed.
"Medicare vouchers scare
me very much, as doctors are
already refusing Medicare
patients," Arrow said. "If you
start really trying to control
Medicare in the way [VP
Candidate Paul] Ryan wants
to, or in any way that the con
sumer is the allocator, it's like
depositors managing bank's
security."
The ideological differences
between Taylor and Arrow
were bridged only when dis
cussing the importance of
enhancing the American edu

cational system. Yet, when
pressed for details, few were
offered.
In essence, the two agreed
on the fact that there were a
number of challenges on the
horizon for the US, but could
hardly find a middle ground
on which to base their solu
tions. However, Professor
Taylor commented that it was
essential not to let these diver
gences preclude progress from
being made in these areas and
foster partisanship and antipa
thy towards the other side.
"Partisanship occurs when
you don't like the other guy's
idea just because it's from the
other guy and that's what we
have to get away from," he
said.
The reaction from students
to the discussion was mixed,
with some complaining that
the discussion was structured in
too loose a manner to allow for
clear articulations of differing
points of view. Commenting on
the discussion, Maxine Litre 'l5
expressed frustration.
"A lot of Taylor's answers
seemed evasive, and in the
context of an academic setting
it would have been nice for
him to have been a little more
direct in his answers."
