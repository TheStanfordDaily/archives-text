## Denning leads first Board meeting 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
At the first meeting held by new chair Steven
Denning M.B.A. '7B, the Stanford Board of
Trustees discussed several ongoing University
construction projects, including an initiative to
add 326 beds to graduate school housing. The
renovations would allow 60 percent of graduate
students to live on campus, up from roughly 55
percent currently.
The Board also heard presentations from
University President John Hennessy, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, and John Mitchell, the
University's first vice provost of online learning.
Denning, who assumed his new post on July 1,
previously served as a co-chair for The Stanford
Challenge, a fundraising initiative that raised $6.2
billion between the fiscal years 2007 and 2011.
"We recently completed The Stanford
Challenge in December," Denning said. "It's fair
to say that the enthusiasm around Hennessy and
Etchemendy's vision continues."
One way in which the University is attempt
ing to seek solutions to global problems is
through its initiative in online education, espe
cially with the creation of the Office of the Vice
Provost of Online Learning in August.
"We are in a period of very intense experi
mentation and there's a lot going on." Denning
said. "We've designated John Mitchell as the new
vice provost. He's got a small staff... really
focusing on the three P's, as he indicated: plat
form, pedagogy and production."
Stanford is offering 16 online courses to the
public this year. Of these courses, nine are being
run through Coursera, an outside mediator. The
rest are run by Stanford-born platforms, includ
ing five through Class2Go and two through
Venture Lab.

In addition to reviewing an expansion of grad
uate student housing, the Board also approved
the design of the new facility at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which is being spon
sored by the U.S. Department of Energy. The $65
million building will serve as a front entrance to
SLAC, housing a cafe, auditorium and confer-

ence center. An expansion to the SLAC's Linac
Coherent Light Source, the strongest imaging
source in the world, is expected for completion by
2016.
"You can see proteins folding. You can see
atomic reactions. You can see molecules combin
ing," Denning said.
The Board also discussed the construction of
a new space for the Stanford Asian Liver Center
within the Freidenrich Center for Translational
Research in the School of Medicine. The Asian
Liver Center focuses on outreach, education,
advocacy and research of Hepatitis B.
Denning noted that while he did was not
aware of specifics, he was certain that there was
collaboration between the Stanford Asian Liver
Center on campus and the satellite center in the
Stanford Center at Peking University (SCPKU).
"That's an excellent example of how that
global center is providing the connectivity back
to campus and then campus to Beijing," Denning
said. "It's exactly what was envisioned when you
put SCPKU in place: really being a focal point for
Stanford programs and activities across the seven
schools, SLAC, etc."
The Board of Trustees also bid farewell to
Robert M. Bass MBA '72 , whose term expired
after serving 23 years on the Board. The Oct.
meeting was his last.
Bass, president of Keystone Group LP, and his
wife Anne Bass M.A. 'O7 have made multiple
donations to the University over the years. Most
recent is $5O million donation made to the
Stanford Hospital in 2012.
On Monday evening, the Hennesseys hosted
a dinner at the Hoover House in Bass' honor.
"It was in deep admiration and appreciation
that we acknowledged and celebrated his contri
bution to the University," Denning said. "This is
someone who's shown extreme devotion and
dedication. He's an individual that's really made
the commitment, gotten involved and provided
an enduring and indelible mark on this university
in a very positive way."
