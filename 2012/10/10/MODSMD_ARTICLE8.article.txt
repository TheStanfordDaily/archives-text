## Straggling with the spread 
### George Chen 
It's been four days since
Stanford's 56-48 overtime
escape against Arizona, and
there's one statistic that I'm still
struggling to wrap my head
around: 491 yards.
That's the number of yards that the
Cardinal defense gave up through the
air to the Wildcats last Saturday after
noon.
Yes, Matt Scott is one of the top
three quarterbacks in the Pac-12. Yes,
the course of Saturday's game resulted
in an inevitable offensive explosion.
But 491 yards? That seeems almost
inexplicable considering that Stanford
held Matt Barkley, who is still the pro
jected first pick of the 2013 NFL Draft
despite recently taking a backseat to
West Virginia's Geno Smith in the
Hesiman race, to 254 passing yards.
I'm hesitant to say that the reason is
because the Stanford defense played
poorly. Neither the front seven nor the
secondary was on its A game, but there
has to be a better explanation when a
defense that has given up 14 points per
game suddenly lets 48 points go up on
the board.
Whether Stanford fans like it or
not, there's a simple truth behind the
491 passing yards and 46 points that
the team allowed. It's not that the
Cardinal doesn't know how to stop the
spread offense, it's that the Cardinal
physically cannot stop an elite spread
offense.
I emphasize "elite" because no
medicore, wishy-washy spread offense
can beat the Cardinal. It takes the likes
of Oregon and Airzona to give
Stanford real trouble. Credit is given
where credit is due; if nothing else,
Rich Rodriguez knows how to imple
ment the spread offense successfully.
When it comes to playing against
pro-style offenses, I would pick
Stanford's front seven over any other
group except for maybe Alabama's
NFL-caliber corps. But the one thing
that the Cardinal defenders have con
sistently sruggled with in recent years is
running from sideline to sideline and
making touchdown-saving open-field
tackles to contain a spread offense.
The major reason? Stanford's
defense lacks pure speed. Make no
mistake, guys like Chase Thomas,
Shayne Skov and Ben Gardner are as
explosive as any other defender in col
lege football. But when some of the
fastest running backs and wide
receivers in the nation make you first
run ten yards horizontally with them
before you can even come up to make
the stop, it's bound to wear you down
and cause you to miss a few tackles.
And a few missed tackles lead to
game-changing touchdowns in the
blink of an eye.
One of the best examples of this
can be seen in the games that Stanford
has played against Oregon in the last
two years. When the Cardinal defense
has faced speed demons in the likes of
LaMichael James, Kenjon Barner and
De' Anthony Thomas, who all have
unofficial "40" times under 4.40, the
end results have been disastrous.
The only way that Stanford could
stop Oregon's running back was to
stop the halfbacks right at the line of
scrimmage, which the Cardinal man
aged to do in the first couple drives.
But once the backs got past the front
seven and into the second level as the
game progressed, it ended up turning
into an episode of "Tom and Jerry."
Simply put, there was just nothing the
Stanford defenders could do to stop
the bleeding.
When the Cardinal and the Ducks
met in 2010, James exploded for 257
yards on the ground. Last year's meet
ing between the two teams had a simi
lar result, as Oregon averaged five
yards per carry to beat Stanford 53-30
and end its national title hopes. With
Barner and Thomas leading Oregon's
rushing attack this year, it seems
almost inevitable that the Cardinal
defense will once again give up a boat
load of points when it travels to Autzen
in just over a month.
Every defense has a kryptonite. For
USC, it's the screen game and Lane
Kiffin's stupidity. For Arizona, it's the
big offensive linemen that bulldoze
their way across the field so that their
team can inflict 182 yards of damage on
the ground that the Wildcats give up
per game.

And for Stanford, it just happends
to be the well-executed spread offense.

George Chen once completed the 40
in just over 4.2 seconds in high
school. His joy knew no bounds,
until the official scorer let him know
that Wheelie shoes were not
allowed. Commiserate with George
