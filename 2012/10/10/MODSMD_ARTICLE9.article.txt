# SENIOR SIT DOWN MUSINGS WITH MUREZ
## 
### 
A senior from Venice, Calif, Andi Murez
is a three-time All-American and two
time NCAA Champion on the
women's swimming and diving team.
Murez competes in the freestyle, back
stroke and butterfly, spending anywhere from 15 to
20 hours per week in the pool for the Cardinal.
Heading into her final year on the Farm, Murez sat
down with The Daily to talk all things Stanford,
swimming and medicine.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you first get
started in the pool? What was it that made you
decide to start swimming competitively?

Andi Murez (Murez): My grandpa and my father
both swam in high school and then my parents
decided that both my older brother and I should
start swimming. I was seven years old when we first
did a junior lifeguard camp at the beach, and then
at the end of the summer my dad asked one of the
lifeguards if there was a local club team we could

compete for.
TSD: What has been your favorite class at Stanford
and why?
Murez: It was an IntroSem I took my freshman year
called Diseased Based Approach to Physiology. The
class was a 20-person seminar that was small and very
engaging. I'm pre-med and interested in medicine, so
it was very related to what I'm interested in. I also built
a great relationship with the chief anesthesiologist of
the Stanford Hospital and have continued that, which
is pretty cool.
TSD: If you had to pick one place on campus to come
back and visit after you graduate, where would it be?

Murez: The swimming pool, Avery Aquatic Center.
Either that or the quad because it's really pretty and
there's the front of MemChu.

TSD: Favorite sports moment of Stanford career?

Dru: Winning NCAAs in 400 free relay and breaking
the American record. I don't think any of us had the
American record in mind, none of us were thinking
about that, and so when they announced that we had
also broken that record it was cool. But being part of
a winning four-person team, that definitely con
tributed to the team aspect and that was awesome.
Going back to the bench afterwards and having
everyone who was there congratulate us was an
amazing experience. And just bringing home a title
was fun.
TSD: Most people miss a lot of different things
about the Farm, but what will you miss the most
about not putting on the uniform to swim for
Stanford?
Murez: The team, definitely, and seeing the people I've
made such great relationships at practice, and being
