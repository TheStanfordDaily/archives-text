# SENIOR SIT DOWN MUSINGS WITH MUREZ
## 
### 
A senior from Venice, Calif, Andi Murez
is a three-time All-American and two
time NCAA Champion on the
women's swimming and diving team.
Murez competes in the freestyle, back
stroke and butterfly, spending anywhere from 15 to
20 hours per week in the pool for the Cardinal.
Heading into her final year on the Farm, Murez sat
down with The Daily to talk all things Stanford,
swimming and medicine.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you first get
started in the pool? What was it that made you
decide to start swimming competitively?

Andi Murez (Murez): My grandpa and my father
both swam in high school and then my parents
decided that both my older brother and I should
start swimming. I was seven years old when we first
did a junior lifeguard camp at the beach, and then
at the end of the summer my dad asked one of the
lifeguards if there was a local club team we could

compete for.
TSD: What has been your favorite class at Stanford
and why?
Murez: It was an IntroSem I took my freshman year
called Diseased Based Approach to Physiology. The
class was a 20-person seminar that was small and very
engaging. I'm pre-med and interested in medicine, so
it was very related to what I'm interested in. I also built
a great relationship with the chief anesthesiologist of
the Stanford Hospital and have continued that, which
is pretty cool.
TSD: If you had to pick one place on campus to come
back and visit after you graduate, where would it be?

Murez: The swimming pool, Avery Aquatic Center.
Either that or the quad because it's really pretty and
there's the front of MemChu.

TSD: Favorite sports moment of Stanford career?

Dru: Winning NCAAs in 400 free relay and breaking
the American record. I don't think any of us had the
American record in mind, none of us were thinking
about that, and so when they announced that we had
also broken that record it was cool. But being part of
a winning four-person team, that definitely con
tributed to the team aspect and that was awesome.
Going back to the bench afterwards and having
everyone who was there congratulate us was an
amazing experience. And just bringing home a title
was fun.
TSD: Most people miss a lot of different things
about the Farm, but what will you miss the most
about not putting on the uniform to swim for
Stanford?
Murez: The team, definitely, and seeing the people I've
made such great relationships at practice, and being

able to compete with them.
TSD: Do you have goals
being a senior and taking
more of a leadership role
going into your last year?
Murez: One of the things that
our team has discussed has
been making good decisions
in every aspect of the year and
of our lives. Whether its getting
sleep, doing your schoolwork,
recovering, practicing all the
technique you need in the
pool, pushing as hard at prac
tice, or doing well at meets. I
think that's our main focus
this year, and I definitely agree
with it and want to help make
sure we maintain it.
TSD: Swimming is an individ
ual sport in the competition
aspect, save for the relays.
How do you balance the team
and individual drive it takes
to succeed?
Murez: As long as I've been on
the Stanford team it's been all
about the team, and so it's tak
ing what I've known for so
long about being in the water

by myself, and transferring
that to the team aspect and
team mentality doing what
I've always done.
TSD: If you could play one
other sport besides swim
ming, what would it be and
why?
Dru: There's not one other
sport really. I just wish I
played multiple other sports as
a kid. I mean definitely grow
ing up all my friends played
soccer and I never did. So any
and all sports; my parents did
n't want me in a physical
sport, and that's also kind of
why I swam because it's easy
on the body.
TSD: Is there any advice you
would give to freshman just
coming into the program?
Dru: Well I guess outside of
swimming, take advantage of
all the opportunities that you
have. There's so much going
on on campus and it's hard to
do other things, but do as
much as possible. Whether it's
hanging out with people in
the dorm or going to see
events that are going on, do
as much as you can. And just
have fun in swimming. If you
focus and care about it, you'll
see results.

TSD: Favorite stroke?
Murez: 100 or 200 freestyle.
TSD: When you're up on the
blocks for the 100, what's
going through your mind?
Murez: Hopefully nothing.
The best races are when you
get of the pool and have no
idea what just happened.
Where you 're just totally in the
moment and you've practiced
everything and know exactly
what you're going to do
regarding race plan and tech
nique. Where you're swim
ming your own race instead of
focusing on where everyone
else is in the race and you're
just controlling what you have
the ability to control.
TSD: After school, do you plan
to keep swimming or is this the
end of the road in the pool?
Murez: I want to keep swim
ming, but I definitely want to
go to medical school. And
since I don't really want to
take off much time before all
that schooling, so I'm not
exactly sure what my plan is yet.
TSD: Thanks so much for sit
ting down to talk, Andi.

Murez: Of course, anytime.
