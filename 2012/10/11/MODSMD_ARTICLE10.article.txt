						SWING OF THINGS
## WOMEN'S GOLF FINISHES THIRD AT EDEAN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With early-morning fog making for less than ideal
conditions at Sahalee Golf Course in Sammamish,
Wash., competitors at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational had trouble even approaching par, let
alone breaking it.
In the wet and the cold, however, the women's golf
team found its groove and rebounded from a difficult
second round to earn the low team score of the round
and finish the event in third place.
Washington proved once again why it is the top
ranked team in the country, shooting a three-day total
of 886 (22 over par) that lapped second-place UC-
Davis, No. 9 in the nation, by a full 14 strokes and was
19 better than the Cardinal.
But after a somewhat disappointing llth-place fin
ish at the season-opening Mason Rudolph Women's
Championship last month, Stanford had plenty of pos
itives to take from its most recent performance.
Senior Sally Watson kicked off her collegiate cam
paign she missed the Mason Rudolph while com
peting in the Women's World Amateur Team
Championships in Antaya, Turkey with a tie for
second in the individual standings. The three-time All-
Pac-12 honoree shook off a double bogey on her
opening hole on Monday to finish with a 1-over 217
for the tournament.
Watson's final-round 71 (1 under par) included
five birdies. She also finished in the top five in par-3
scoring, par-5 scoring and in total birdies.
Head coach Anne Walker was happy to see Watson
play well in her return to the college circuit.
"This was a terrific event for Sally," Walker said.
"She played smart and handled herself extraordinari
ly well. It was impressive to watch."
While Watson led the young Stanford team,
Walker said the whole team could use this perform
ance to move towards even better results as they gain
confidence.
"We had a great team effort, and as a result were
able to shoot the lowest round of the day," Walker
said.
Freshman Mariah Stackhouse came out firing on
Wednesday, carding an even-par 72 to finish tied for
eighth overall. That was despite a second-round 78,
which included a seven on the fourth hole.
"Mariah really came through for us this week,"
Walker said. "She is a tremendous player and has
already grown in the past couple weeks. I saw her hit
some shots today that were tour-quality."
The Cardinal's final three competitors all finished
within a few strokes of each other. Sophomore
Mariko Tumangan tied for 28th after three rounds in
the 70s and freshman Lauren Kim finished two
strokes behind her 40th. Junior Marissa Mar shot a
first-round 75, but faded slightly down the stretch with
an 83 in the final round to finish tied for 41st.
Although the team's official spring season does not
begin until the Peg Barnard Invitational in February
and the NCAA Championships aren't until May, con
tinuing the team's good start in the fall will do nothing
to hurt Stanford's psyche.
The Cardinal returns home for its final fall tourna
ment when it hosts the Stanford Intercollegiate from
Oct. 19-21.
