## Trojans no match for streaking Card 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
With the eyes of the Pac-12 squarely on Palo
Alto for Wednesday's women's volleyball show
down between No. 6 USC and No. 4 Stanford, the
Cardinal proved that it is a major force to be dealt
with in both the conference and national title pic
ture.
While the Trojans (16-3,4-3 Pac-12) came into
Maples Pavilion as one of the hottest teams in the
league, with a lineup featuring the league's two
most recent Player of the Week winners, it took
just three sets for Stanford to stretch its winning
streak to 13 games.

The Cardinal has proven to be quite formida
ble at home, winning all seven of its matches at
Maples. And while the first set went back-and
forth, it didn't take too long for Stanford to prove
why.
USC held a 16-15 lead when Stanford went on
a massive run, recording seven straight points to
jump out to a 22-16 lead. The streak featured
three straight blocks, part of the eight Stanford

totaled in the set. Ultimately, USC couldn't com
bat Stanford's dominant stretch and the Cardinal
took the set 25-18. Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat was especially brilliant, recording five
blocks in the first set while simultaneously lead
ing the team with four kills.
Stanford's hot streak continued into the sec
ond set. The Cardinal started with four straight
points and didn't look back, ultimately taking the
set 25-16. Freshman outside hitter Brittany
Howard recorded five kills, proving unstoppable
against what was touted before the match as a
stout Trojan defense.
