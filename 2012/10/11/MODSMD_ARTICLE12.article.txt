# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Trojans no match for streaking Card 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
With the eyes of the Pac-12 squarely on Palo
Alto for Wednesday's women's volleyball show
down between No. 6 USC and No. 4 Stanford, the
Cardinal proved that it is a major force to be dealt
with in both the conference and national title pic
ture.
While the Trojans (16-3,4-3 Pac-12) came into
Maples Pavilion as one of the hottest teams in the
league, with a lineup featuring the league's two
most recent Player of the Week winners, it took
just three sets for Stanford to stretch its winning
streak to 13 games.

The Cardinal has proven to be quite formida
ble at home, winning all seven of its matches at
Maples. And while the first set went back-and
forth, it didn't take too long for Stanford to prove
why.
USC held a 16-15 lead when Stanford went on
a massive run, recording seven straight points to
jump out to a 22-16 lead. The streak featured
three straight blocks, part of the eight Stanford

totaled in the set. Ultimately, USC couldn't com
bat Stanford's dominant stretch and the Cardinal
took the set 25-18. Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat was especially brilliant, recording five
blocks in the first set while simultaneously lead
ing the team with four kills.
Stanford's hot streak continued into the sec
ond set. The Cardinal started with four straight
points and didn't look back, ultimately taking the
set 25-16. Freshman outside hitter Brittany
Howard recorded five kills, proving unstoppable
against what was touted before the match as a
stout Trojan defense.

STANFORD 3
10/10, Maples Pavilion
The final set again began back
and-forth, with neither side gaining
much of an advantage over the
other. With the score 8-7 in the
Trojans' favor, the Cardinal went
on yet another run, winning eight
points out of nine and seizing a
lead that it would never relinquish.
Unable to make up any ground,
the Trojans dropped the last set 25-
18 as the Cardinal claimed its sec
ond straight sweep and 13th
straight win.

The heralded Stanford fresh
man all had standout games.
Howard and middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku led the team with 12 kills
each while hitting .414 and .529,
respectively. Jordan Burgess, also
an outside hitter, added seven kills
and 19 digs, while hitting .467.
The Stanford defense was par
ticularly tough on the Trojans,
holding the USC stars, freshman

outsider hitter Samantha Bricio
and senior opposite Katie Fuller,
to -.042 and -.037 hitting, respec
tively.

Bricio won last week's AVCA
Player of the Week, Pac-12 Player
of the Week and her third straight
Pac-12 Freshman of the Week
honors last week, but was unable
to get anything going against the
vicious Cardinal defense. She
recorded more errors (12) than
kills (10), slowing the USC attack.

The Cardinal had 26 blocks in
the match, with Wopat putting up
seven and junior outside hitter
Rachel Williams and Ajanaku
adding six each. At the same time,
sophomore libero Kyle Gilbert was
all over the court, with 22 digs on
the match, demonstrating just how
daunting the Cardinal defense can
be.

The Cardinal will put its 13-
game winning streak to the test
against the No. 7 UCLA Bruins on
Friday in Maples Pavilion at 6 p.m.
