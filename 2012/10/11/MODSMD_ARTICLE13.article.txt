# INTO THE LIGHT

### JOSEPH BAYDA DESK EDITOR 
The 2008 Big Game was supposed to be a new
high-water mark for Stanford football. Even as
the 5-6 Cardinal traveled across the Bay to face
off against 6-4 California, there was a sense that
it just might be the year for Stanford to earn
bowl eligibility with a sixth win, a pinnacle that had been not
been reached by a single player on its roster.
Instead, Stanford's Nov. 17,2008 date in Berkeley turned
into one of the most embarrassing losses in the rivalry's
recent history. By the time the Bears grabbed a 37-3 fourth
quarter lead, it was all too clear that a seventh straight
Stanford season would end with a losing record. The ugly
game made for a silent locker room.

"Boy, we were very quiet,
very down," remembers out
side linebackers coach Lance
Anderson. "At that point in our
time here [getting to a bowl]
was a huge goal, a huge accom
plishment. There was a lot of
disappointment."
Redshirt senior Alex
Debniak, then a wide-eyed
freshman linebacker, has
played in 29 games since that
Big Game loss, but he still has
vivid memories of its aftermath.
"ft was heartbreaking to
watch the [seniors], because
they came so close to getting to
that bowl game," Debniak said.
"Watching that look on their
faces, we as a class came togeth
er and realized we didn't want
that for us, and we didn't want
that for the kids below us
either.
"It left a bitter taste in our
mouth," he added, "and it left us
hungry."
Five current Cardinal play
ers Debniak, linebacker
Chase Thomas, safety Ffarold
Bernard, center Sam
Schwartzstein and punter
Daniel Zychlinski hit the
Memorial Stadium gridiron
that afternoon in 2008. Those
redshirt seniors are the lone
holdouts from an era of losing
records and bowl seasons spent
watching games on TV, a dying
breed of Stanford players who
have experienced a losing sea
son.
The Cardinal may be a sub
lime 35-9 over the last three and
a half years, but that 5-7 mark in
2008 especially the anticli
mactic finish to the season
was instrumental in sparking
the turnaround.
"I think right after that,
that's when those guys who
came back just set their mind to
it that we were going to do
everything possible, really sacri
fice in the offseason to do
everything we could to get over
that hump," Anderson said.
Despite its sour ending,
2008 had itself been a stride for
ward for a Cardinal program
that 1-11 just two seasons earli
er, before Jim Harbaugh was
hired as head coach.
Harbaugh's first two teams
respectively compiled four and
five wins, marking the first time

since 1990-92 that Stanford's
record had improved in consec
utive seasons.
The outgoing seniors who
had fallen just short of a bowl
that year would become role
models for later classes of
young players who would reap
the rewards of the program's
resurgence.
"We saw how we wanted to
approach our next four years
here," said Zychlinski, now
Stanford's starting punter.
"[We] took some good exam
ples from them, and then built
really a machine."
Sure, that Cardinal machine
has ridden a wave of Heisman
Trophy candidates and some of
the most skilled recruiting class
es in school history all the way
to consecutive BCS bowls. But
the collective chip on Stanford's
shoulder has as much to do with
the team's success as it does
with the talent that took center
stage.
"We've had that certain dis
cipline or that certain drive in
the offseason practices," said
Thomas, an All-American who
passed on the NFL Draft to
return for a fifth year. "[lt's] to
make sure we don't go back to
those days... We don't antici
pate losing anymore, and moral
victories are over around here."
"They realized how hard it
is to win, that fine line between
winning and losing, and how
hard you have to sacrifice, how
hard you have to work,"
Anderson said. "Every little
thing can make a difference."
The little things offsea
son work, conditioning, meet
ings and more finally added
up for Stanford in 2009 when it
went 8-5 with a Sun Bowl
appearance. But that newfound
success also meant that the
Cardinal's youngest players
hadn't experienced the same
disappointment of a losing sea
son, an emotion that had
become a focal point for older
classes.
"It gets more and more dif
ficult as time goes on, because
we have a perspective that a lot
of younger guys don't have,"
Debniak said. "I think it's just a
matter of instilling that tough
ness."

Bernard, who has appeared
in the Stanford secondary in all
but four games since 2009, is
confident that enough of a win
ning culture has been built to
maintain the Cardinal's success.
But he adds that many young

players were already used to
winning before they arrived on
the Farm perhaps too much
so.

"Most of the guys on the
team come from winning high
schools," he explained. "We try
to tell them, 'Don't get too high,
don't get too cocky,' because we
try to remind them where we
came from, that we weren't
always this good and we've got
to just harness what we have
and keep it going, keep it mov
ing."
One of the ways the
Cardinal's elder statesmen
emphasize that attitude is
through a "team covenant,"
Zychlinski said. Compiled each
year by the seniors, it's a list of
items to achieve over the
course of the season.
"One of our biggest points
this year was, 'This is a meritoc
racy,'" Zychlinski said. "You get
what you work for and you get
what you earn."
And for the five players
who witnessed firsthand what it
was like to not make a bowl,
time is running short to pass on
that message.
If 4-1 Stanford can secure
three more victories, it will be
guaranteed yet another win
ning season, and the fifth-year
seniors will leave behind a ros
ter of players who have never
experienced the type of heart
break felt after the 2008 Big
Game. Stanford hasn't gone
four years without a losing sea
son since a 17-year streak from
1964-80.
The prospect of fielding a
group of players who have
never finished a season below
.500 is uncharted territory, but is
still exciting for Anderson and
the coaching staff.
"That's what we want to
do," he said. "We don't want to
have to take a step back. We
don't want to have to lose to
teach guys lessons. We should
be able to learn those lessons
through winning."
Be that as it may, Stanford
has still experienced the disap
pointment of unachieved goals
early in the 2012 season.
"This is going to be a top-25
team for years to come,"
Schwartzstein said. "I don't
think they need a losing season.
I think we already had that
taste with the loss to
Washington, the loss early in
the season, which we haven't
had in a while."
Of course, new experiences
aren't new at all for these five.
After their final three months
of college football, this year's
group of fifth-year seniors will
be remembered as the ones
who bridged all sorts of gaps:
from Gerhart to Luck, from
Harbaugh to Shaw, from losing
to winning.
Zychlinski puts it best: "We
went through the dark years,"
he says, "and we made some
thing out of nothing."

has still experienced the disap
pointment of unachieved goals
early in the 2012 season.
"This is going to be a top-25
team for years to come,"
Schwartzstein said. "I don't
think they need a losing season.
I think we already had that
taste with the loss to
Washington, the loss early in
the season, which we haven't
had in a while."
Of course, new experiences
aren't new at all for these five.
After their final three months
of college football, this year's
group of fifth-year seniors will
be remembered as the ones
who bridged all sorts of gaps:
from Gerhart to Luck, from
Harbaugh to Shaw, from losing
to winning.
Zychlinski puts it best: "We
went through the dark years,"
he says, "and we made some
thing out of nothing."

The 2008 Big Game was supposed to be a new
high-water mark for Stanford football. Even as
the 5-6 Cardinal traveled across the Bay to face
off against 6-4 California, there was a sense that
it just might be the year for Stanford to earn
bowl eligibility with a sixth win, a pinnacle that had been not
been reached by a single player on its roster.
Instead, Stanford's Nov. 17,2008 date in Berkeley turned
into one of the most embarrassing losses in the rivalry's
recent history. By the time the Bears grabbed a 37-3 fourth
quarter lead, it was all too clear that a seventh straight
Stanford season would end with a losing record. The ugly
game made for a silent locker room.

"Boy, we were very quiet,
very down," remembers out
side linebackers coach Lance
Anderson. "At that point in our
time here [getting to a bowl]
was a huge goal, a huge accom
plishment. There was a lot of
disappointment."
Redshirt senior Alex
Debniak, then a wide-eyed
freshman linebacker, has
played in 29 games since that
Big Game loss, but he still has
vivid memories of its aftermath.
"ft was heartbreaking to
watch the [seniors], because
they came so close to getting to
that bowl game," Debniak said.
"Watching that look on their
faces, we as a class came togeth
er and realized we didn't want
that for us, and we didn't want
that for the kids below us
either.
"It left a bitter taste in our
mouth," he added, "and it left us
hungry."
Five current Cardinal play
ers Debniak, linebacker
Chase Thomas, safety Ffarold
Bernard, center Sam
Schwartzstein and punter
Daniel Zychlinski hit the
Memorial Stadium gridiron
that afternoon in 2008. Those
redshirt seniors are the lone
holdouts from an era of losing
records and bowl seasons spent
watching games on TV, a dying
breed of Stanford players who
have experienced a losing sea
son.
The Cardinal may be a sub
lime 35-9 over the last three and
a half years, but that 5-7 mark in
2008 especially the anticli
mactic finish to the season
was instrumental in sparking
the turnaround.
"I think right after that,
that's when those guys who
came back just set their mind to
it that we were going to do
everything possible, really sacri
fice in the offseason to do
everything we could to get over
that hump," Anderson said.
Despite its sour ending,
2008 had itself been a stride for
ward for a Cardinal program
that 1-11 just two seasons earli
er, before Jim Harbaugh was
hired as head coach.
Harbaugh's first two teams
respectively compiled four and
five wins, marking the first time

since 1990-92 that Stanford's
record had improved in consec
utive seasons.
The outgoing seniors who
had fallen just short of a bowl
that year would become role
models for later classes of
young players who would reap
the rewards of the program's
resurgence.
"We saw how we wanted to
approach our next four years
here," said Zychlinski, now
Stanford's starting punter.
"[We] took some good exam
ples from them, and then built
really a machine."
Sure, that Cardinal machine
has ridden a wave of Heisman
Trophy candidates and some of
the most skilled recruiting class
es in school history all the way
to consecutive BCS bowls. But
the collective chip on Stanford's
shoulder has as much to do with
the team's success as it does
with the talent that took center
stage.
"We've had that certain dis
cipline or that certain drive in
the offseason practices," said
Thomas, an All-American who
passed on the NFL Draft to
return for a fifth year. "[lt's] to
make sure we don't go back to
those days... We don't antici
pate losing anymore, and moral
victories are over around here."
"They realized how hard it
is to win, that fine line between
winning and losing, and how
hard you have to sacrifice, how
hard you have to work,"
Anderson said. "Every little
thing can make a difference."
The little things offsea
son work, conditioning, meet
ings and more finally added
up for Stanford in 2009 when it
went 8-5 with a Sun Bowl
appearance. But that newfound
success also meant that the
Cardinal's youngest players
hadn't experienced the same
disappointment of a losing sea
son, an emotion that had
become a focal point for older
classes.
"It gets more and more dif
ficult as time goes on, because
we have a perspective that a lot
of younger guys don't have,"
Debniak said. "I think it's just a
matter of instilling that tough
ness."

Bernard, who has appeared
in the Stanford secondary in all
but four games since 2009, is
confident that enough of a win
ning culture has been built to
maintain the Cardinal's success.
But he adds that many young

players were already used to
winning before they arrived on
the Farm perhaps too much
so.

"Most of the guys on the
team come from winning high
schools," he explained. "We try
to tell them, 'Don't get too high,
don't get too cocky,' because we
try to remind them where we
came from, that we weren't
always this good and we've got
to just harness what we have
and keep it going, keep it mov
ing."
One of the ways the
Cardinal's elder statesmen
emphasize that attitude is
through a "team covenant,"
Zychlinski said. Compiled each
year by the seniors, it's a list of
items to achieve over the
course of the season.
"One of our biggest points
this year was, 'This is a meritoc
racy,'" Zychlinski said. "You get
what you work for and you get
what you earn."
And for the five players
who witnessed firsthand what it
was like to not make a bowl,
time is running short to pass on
that message.
If 4-1 Stanford can secure
three more victories, it will be
guaranteed yet another win
ning season, and the fifth-year
seniors will leave behind a ros
ter of players who have never
experienced the type of heart
break felt after the 2008 Big
Game. Stanford hasn't gone
four years without a losing sea
son since a 17-year streak from
1964-80.
The prospect of fielding a
group of players who have
never finished a season below
.500 is uncharted territory, but is
still exciting for Anderson and
the coaching staff.
"That's what we want to
do," he said. "We don't want to
have to take a step back. We
don't want to have to lose to
teach guys lessons. We should
be able to learn those lessons
through winning."
Be that as it may, Stanford
has still experienced the disap
pointment of unachieved goals
early in the 2012 season.
"This is going to be a top-25

time is running short to pass on
that message.
If 4-1 Stanford can secure
three more victories, it will be
guaranteed yet another win
ning season, and the fifth-year
seniors will leave behind a ros
ter of players who have never
experienced the type of heart
break felt after the 2008 Big
Game. Stanford hasn't gone
four years without a losing sea
son since a 17-year streak from
1964-80.
The prospect of fielding a
group of players who have
never finished a season below
.500 is uncharted territory, but is
still exciting for Anderson and
the coaching staff.
"That's what we want to
do," he said. "We don't want to
have to take a step back. We
don't want to have to lose to
teach guys lessons. We should
be able to learn those lessons
through winning."
Be that as it may, Stanford
has still experienced the disap
pointment of unachieved goals
early in the 2012 season.
"This is going to be a top-25
team for years to come,"
Schwartzstein said. "I don't
think they need a losing season.
I think we already had that
taste with the loss to
Washington, the loss early in
the season, which we haven't
had in a while."
Of course, new experiences
aren't new at all for these five.
After their final three months
of college football, this year's
group of fifth-year seniors will
be remembered as the ones
who bridged all sorts of gaps:
from Gerhart to Luck, from
Harbaugh to Shaw, from losing
to winning.
Zychlinski puts it best: "We
went through the dark years,"
he says, "and we made some
thing out of nothing."
