# INTO THE LIGHT

### JOSEPH BAYDA DESK EDITOR 
The 2008 Big Game was supposed to be a new
high-water mark for Stanford football. Even as
the 5-6 Cardinal traveled across the Bay to face
off against 6-4 California, there was a sense that
it just might be the year for Stanford to earn
bowl eligibility with a sixth win, a pinnacle that had been not
been reached by a single player on its roster.
Instead, Stanford's Nov. 17,2008 date in Berkeley turned
into one of the most embarrassing losses in the rivalry's
recent history. By the time the Bears grabbed a 37-3 fourth
quarter lead, it was all too clear that a seventh straight
Stanford season would end with a losing record. The ugly
game made for a silent locker room.
