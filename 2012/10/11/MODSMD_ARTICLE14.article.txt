## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Affirmative action and assumptions of merit 
### Adam Johnson 
Yesterday, the United States
Supreme Court heard oral
arguments for the case Fisher v.
University of Texas. The case concerns
Abigail Fisher, a white student chal
lenging the use of race as one of many
factors used to admit students to the
state's flagship university. A court chal
lenge to racial preferences in college
admissions is hardly a new develop
ment; affirmative action policies have
long been challenged as unfairly dis
criminating against white and Asian
students.

The justifications for affirmative
action are numerous, ranging from a
need for diversity to ideas about fair
ness and justice. Although the
University of Texas will use only some
of these justifications in defending
their policy, they are all relevant to the
broader popularity of affirmative
action in college admissions.
One of the major critiques of affir
mative action revolves around notions
of merit. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines merit as the quality
of "being entitled to reward or grati
tude." At the core of this definition is
the assumption that in a meritocracy,
one deserves credit for positive out
comes (and its corollary, that one be
blamed for negative outcomes).
We see implications of this assump
tion throughout our culture and poli
tics. Your opinion on how much the
state should tax income, for instance,
will largely depend on whether or not
you think workers are entitled to all or
most of the income they receive. This
assumption is certainly relevant in the
Fisher case, as Fisher hopes that stu
dents "will be able to get into any
school they want to no matter what
race they are but solely based on their
merit and if they work hard for it."

What Fisher —and thousands of
others conveniently ignore is that the
traditional considerations in admissions
decisions (superior grades, test scores,
and recommendations) are not solely
determined by how hard one works. I
like to think that I worked hard in high
school, but I am also the first to
acknowledge that I probably wouldn't
be at a top university had I not had plen
ty of good fortune growing up.
My family happened to care deeply
about education, my school district is
one of the best in the state, I had access
to summer resources to further my
education, I didn't have to worry about
street violence or personal health and
much more. This is not to say I was
never unfairly disadvantaged in my
upbringing. I hardly read as a child, and
perhaps stereotypes that my parents

and teachers held regarding boys con
tributed to that. But as a whole, the
advantages I received far outweighed

the disadvantages, and as a result I
grew up wondering not whether I
would go to college, but which college I
would attend.

Indeed, many recognize the role of
socioeconomic factors in aiding or
inhibiting a child's academic growth.
Some say, then, that we should replace
race-based affirmative action with
socioeconomic affirmative action.

While I agree that universities
should consider an applicant's socioe
conomic status, I object to the conclu
sion that race is not a factor in academ
ic achievement. Countless studies sup
port the position that race still plays a
significant role in questions of access.
One study shows that when given com
parable resumes, managers will offer
white candidates interviews at much
higher rates than their black counter
parts. Another study found that white
and Asian high school students were
placed on higher tracks than Latinos
and blacks with comparable academic
achievements. And I still haven't men
tioned the idea of white privilege,
which focuses on unearned advantages
that whites accumulate on the basis of
their skin color. These privileges range
from having bandages that match the
color of one's skin to having members
of one's race as dominant presences in
government, media and academia.

Affirmative action doesn't have to
be framed as retribution for past
wrongdoings. If it were, then Asian
Americans would surely have a strong
case to benefit from such policies.
Rather, affirmative action can be
viewed as away to correct for current
societal flaws that give under-repre
sented minorities less access to educa
tional opportunities than whites and
Asians, all other things being equal.
People criticize affirmative action for
giving special privilege to under-repre
sented minority applicants without
realizing that whites and, in recent
years, Asian students have likely
received educational privileges based
on skin color throughout their lives.
Of course, this doesn't mean we
should necessarily promote affirmative
action policies (they may, for instance,
worsen the stereotypes that harm stu
dents of color). But acknowledging the
deeper issues of inequality and access
will start a conversation that would not
only shed light on whether we should
support race-based affirmative action,
but could ultimately address the broad
er question of whether we are justified
in rewarding some students for strong
achievement while blaming those who
do not perform as well.

should consider an applicant's socioe
conomic status, I object to the conclu
sion that race is not a factor in academ
ic achievement. Countless studies sup
port the position that race still plays a
significant role in questions of access.
One study shows that when given com
parable resumes, managers will offer
white candidates interviews at much
higher rates than their black counter
parts. Another study found that white
and Asian high school students were
placed on higher tracks than Latinos
and blacks with comparable academic
achievements. And I still haven't men
tioned the idea of white privilege,
which focuses on unearned advantages
that whites accumulate on the basis of
their skin color. These privileges range
from having bandages that match the
color of one's skin to having members
of one's race as dominant presences in
government, media and academia.

Affirmative action doesn't have to
be framed as retribution for past
wrongdoings. If it were, then Asian
Americans would surely have a strong
case to benefit from such policies.
Rather, affirmative action can be
viewed as away to correct for current
societal flaws that give under-repre
sented minorities less access to educa
tional opportunities than whites and
Asians, all other things being equal.
People criticize affirmative action for
giving special privilege to under-repre
sented minority applicants without
realizing that whites and, in recent
years, Asian students have likely
received educational privileges based
on skin color throughout their lives.
Of course, this doesn't mean we
should necessarily promote affirmative
action policies (they may, for instance,
worsen the stereotypes that harm stu
dents of color). But acknowledging the
deeper issues of inequality and access
will start a conversation that would not
only shed light on whether we should
support race-based affirmative action,
but could ultimately address the broad
er question of whether we are justified
in rewarding some students for strong
achievement while blaming those who
do not perform as well.

Yesterday, the United States
Supreme Court heard oral
arguments for the case Fisher v.
University of Texas. The case concerns
Abigail Fisher, a white student chal
lenging the use of race as one of many
factors used to admit students to the
state's flagship university. A court chal
lenge to racial preferences in college
admissions is hardly a new develop
ment; affirmative action policies have
long been challenged as unfairly dis
criminating against white and Asian
students.

The justifications for affirmative
action are numerous, ranging from a
need for diversity to ideas about fair
ness and justice. Although the
University of Texas will use only some
of these justifications in defending
their policy, they are all relevant to the
broader popularity of affirmative
action in college admissions.
One of the major critiques of affir
mative action revolves around notions
of merit. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines merit as the quality
of "being entitled to reward or grati
tude." At the core of this definition is
the assumption that in a meritocracy,
one deserves credit for positive out
comes (and its corollary, that one be
blamed for negative outcomes).
We see implications of this assump
tion throughout our culture and poli
tics. Your opinion on how much the
state should tax income, for instance,
will largely depend on whether or not
you think workers are entitled to all or
most of the income they receive. This
assumption is certainly relevant in the
Fisher case, as Fisher hopes that stu
dents "will be able to get into any
school they want to no matter what
race they are but solely based on their
merit and if they work hard for it."

What Fisher —and thousands of
others conveniently ignore is that the
traditional considerations in admissions
decisions (superior grades, test scores,
and recommendations) are not solely
determined by how hard one works. I
like to think that I worked hard in high
school, but I am also the first to
acknowledge that I probably wouldn't
be at a top university had I not had plen
ty of good fortune growing up.
My family happened to care deeply
about education, my school district is
one of the best in the state, I had access
to summer resources to further my
education, I didn't have to worry about
street violence or personal health and
much more. This is not to say I was
never unfairly disadvantaged in my
upbringing. I hardly read as a child, and
perhaps stereotypes that my parents

and teachers held regarding boys con
tributed to that. But as a whole, the
advantages I received far outweighed

the disadvantages, and as a result I
grew up wondering not whether I
would go to college, but which college I
would attend.

Indeed, many recognize the role of
socioeconomic factors in aiding or
inhibiting a child's academic growth.
Some say, then, that we should replace
race-based affirmative action with
socioeconomic affirmative action.
