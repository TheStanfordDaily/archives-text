# I WANT TO GO TO THERE
## Where would I go in a time of need? 
### Annie Graham 
Where should I go in a time of
need, when I feel completely
helpless? It's something I've
considered a great deal since I was little,
always planning and re-planning my
future actions in case of a life emer
gency. I've been into plans and lists for
a while.
For me, the answer to this question
has always been a church or a similarly
religious and meditative space. The reli
gious tradition I've known closest in my
twenty years is Christianity, but I'd be
comforted in many equally inviting
spiritual environments. This is not to say
that I don't trust my friends, family
members, or any of the number of
campus resources available to talk
through hardships and provide mental
balance; those are fantastic support sys
tems to rely on.
But whenever there is a time where
I feel very troubled or anxious at
Stanford, my feet almost drag me to
Memorial Church. Of the times I
have been overwhelmed to the point of
tears, I have most often been near
Memorial Church, and there I have
found comfort.
The sight of it clears my head; it's
something big and grand, a structure
that has been there much longer than
I've been alive. A quiet space where
many others before me have sat and
sorted through their own troubles
again and again. A shared devotion to
something, something beyond the con
cerns of problem sets, papers, club
meetings and classes. These are some
of the things that religion means to me.
And though I have a happy rela
tionship with religion, pursuing it per

sonally and academically, I can under
stand those who have only been hurt by
it. I can understand that they need to
stay as far away from religious doctrine
as possible, and to make sense of the
world in other ways. The oppressive
nature of far too many fundamentalist
beliefs does not offer understanding,
but seems only to offer a salvation
gained through hating the right people.
These are decidedly not loving beliefs.
Some pretty cool people raised
me, and made religion a choice
something that exists to see purpose
and meaning in life, but that would
never be forced on me. My impression
of God as a calm and loving force was
only improved when I finally told my
mom I was dating a girl; she immedi
ately replied by email, after a long
conversation: "Much love to you and
God bless, Sweetie. The One who sent
you here must also be so proud that
you are choosing the honest life. There
is just no other way to do the service
you were sent for." I mean, how could
I not continue to love and trust that
God?

However, I also discuss my beliefs
loosely as "religion and spirituality,"
and while I know the Episcopalian
faith best, I admit I have commitment
issues with it. Being at Stanford, many
people speak so eloquently about
their belief systems that I want to
know more. Judaism, Catholicism,
Buddhism religions small and large
offer insight and traditions that I
wouldn't want to ignore.
But then there are those people (I
see you, White Plaza guy) who are so
intensely alienating in their scriptural

beliefs that I can understand why peo
ple throw their hands up and walk away
from it all. And they are not alone. On
Tuesday, the Pew Forum on Religion &
Public Life posted its recent findings
about religion in America: one in five
adults have no religious affiliation, the
largest percentage ever recorded.
Additionally, one-third of adults under
30 have no religious affiliation. I feel a
reprimand coming for us youngsters
from the Republican Party (though this
summer's convention also proved that
Democrats are firmly on Team God
when the American public asks).
Of the adults who are unaffiliated
with religion, about two-thirds say they
believe in God. According to the Pew
report, many say "religious organiza
tions are too concerned with money
and power, too focused on rules and
too involved in politics."
I can identify with such feelings,
and see a comparison to registering as
an independent voter. Whether it's
alienation from the options presented
or the willful choice to exist as an inde
pendent entity, you are likely still
pulling ideas from different parties,
different religious traditions. No mat
ter how aggravating they can be to an
individual identity, both political par
ties and religious traditions have a col
lective knowledge and tradition. Even
as I exist in the grey area of the unaf
filiated with a belief in God, I know I
won't stay here forever. Life, however
messy, seems to always require a
degree of partisanship.

Where should I go in a time of
need, when I feel completely
helpless? It's something I've
considered a great deal since I was little,
always planning and re-planning my
future actions in case of a life emer
gency. I've been into plans and lists for
a while.
For me, the answer to this question
has always been a church or a similarly
religious and meditative space. The reli
gious tradition I've known closest in my
twenty years is Christianity, but I'd be
comforted in many equally inviting
spiritual environments. This is not to say
that I don't trust my friends, family
members, or any of the number of
campus resources available to talk
through hardships and provide mental
balance; those are fantastic support sys
tems to rely on.
But whenever there is a time where
I feel very troubled or anxious at
Stanford, my feet almost drag me to
Memorial Church. Of the times I
have been overwhelmed to the point of
tears, I have most often been near
Memorial Church, and there I have
found comfort.
The sight of it clears my head; it's
something big and grand, a structure
that has been there much longer than
I've been alive. A quiet space where
many others before me have sat and
sorted through their own troubles
again and again. A shared devotion to
something, something beyond the con
cerns of problem sets, papers, club
meetings and classes. These are some
of the things that religion means to me.
And though I have a happy rela
tionship with religion, pursuing it per

sonally and academically, I can under
stand those who have only been hurt by
it. I can understand that they need to
stay as far away from religious doctrine
as possible, and to make sense of the
world in other ways. The oppressive
nature of far too many fundamentalist
beliefs does not offer understanding,
but seems only to offer a salvation
gained through hating the right people.
These are decidedly not loving beliefs.
Some pretty cool people raised
me, and made religion a choice
something that exists to see purpose
and meaning in life, but that would
never be forced on me. My impression
of God as a calm and loving force was
only improved when I finally told my
mom I was dating a girl; she immedi
ately replied by email, after a long
conversation: "Much love to you and
God bless, Sweetie. The One who sent
you here must also be so proud that
you are choosing the honest life. There
is just no other way to do the service
you were sent for." I mean, how could
I not continue to love and trust that
God?

However, I also discuss my beliefs
loosely as "religion and spirituality,"
and while I know the Episcopalian
faith best, I admit I have commitment
issues with it. Being at Stanford, many
people speak so eloquently about
their belief systems that I want to
know more. Judaism, Catholicism,
Buddhism religions small and large
offer insight and traditions that I
wouldn't want to ignore.
But then there are those people (I
see you, White Plaza guy) who are so
intensely alienating in their scriptural

beliefs that I can understand why peo
ple throw their hands up and walk away
from it all. And they are not alone. On
Tuesday, the Pew Forum on Religion &
Public Life posted its recent findings
about religion in America: one in five
adults have no religious affiliation, the
largest percentage ever recorded.
Additionally, one-third of adults under
30 have no religious affiliation. I feel a
reprimand coming for us youngsters
from the Republican Party (though this
summer's convention also proved that
Democrats are firmly on Team God
when the American public asks).
Of the adults who are unaffiliated
with religion, about two-thirds say they
believe in God. According to the Pew
report, many say "religious organiza
tions are too concerned with money
and power, too focused on rules and
too involved in politics."
I can identify with such feelings,
and see a comparison to registering as
an independent voter. Whether it's
alienation from the options presented
or the willful choice to exist as an inde
pendent entity, you are likely still
pulling ideas from different parties,
different religious traditions. No mat
ter how aggravating they can be to an
individual identity, both political par
ties and religious traditions have a col
lective knowledge and tradition. Even
as I exist in the grey area of the unaf
filiated with a belief in God, I know I
won't stay here forever. Life, however
messy, seems to always require a
degree of partisanship.
