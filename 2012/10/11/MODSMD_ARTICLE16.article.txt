## NO. 2 STANFORD SETS OUT FOR SOUTHWEST 
### KAMARIA TAYLOR 
On Thursday, the Stanford
women's soccer team will face
Arizona on the road in a match that
historically has favored the No. 2
Cardinal, which has won 15 of 17
matchups. Stanford has also main
tained a six-game winning streak
against the Wildcats since losing to
them in the 2005 Pac-10 champi
onship 2-1.
Though recovering from a 1-1 tie
to the University of Washington and
3-0 shutout at the hands of
Washington State, Arizona (5-6-3,1-
2-2) will prove to be tough competi
tion if it can return the form that saw
it give No. 3 UCLA all it could handle
in a 2-1 loss in September and
California more than it could handle
in an upset over the Golden Bears,
who are otherwise undefeated in the
past 10 games.
Standout Arizona striker junior

Jazmin Ponce has already netted
seven goals and leads the conference
with 66 shots and 33 on frame. The
Wildcats come equally well equipped
in front of their own goal; goalkeeper
junior Gabby Kaufman has made 72
saves, also the highest in the Pac-12.
Kaufman has only allowed an impres
sive 17 goals in 14 games this season.
Meanwhile, the No. 2 Cardinal
continues its quest to defend its four
consecutive conference titles and
2011 national title. Though undefeat
ed since August this season, Stanford
(11-1-1,5-0) has hit some road bumps
in recent weeks.

Last weekend, Stanford fought
for two narrow victories against Utah
and Colorado. While both were well
earned wins, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe admitted after the Utah
game, "We can get better in the final
third."

Against the Utes, the Cardinal
won 1-0 with senior Nina Watkins

entering the match in the 30th minute
and quickly scoring the only goal of
the game.
The Buffaloes proved to be an
even greater challenge, leading 1-0
with 15 minutes remaining despite
Stanford having dominated posses
sion and shot count. Still, two goals
within 37 seconds from seniors
Mariah Nogueria and Alina
Garciamendez assured another victo
ry for the Card.
Given the team's trouble scoring
over the weekend, Stanford has been
practicing shooting in training this
week.
"Lately we have really good pass
ing and connecting throughout the
field," said freshman forward Katie
Donahue. "Then we just need to be
consistent on our finishing in the final
third of the field."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal has
been a force this season, as in years
past. The team has continued their
36-game winning streak in the Pac
-12, which dates back to October 2008.
And problems finishing have not
defined the majority of the season
consider the team's 5-1 routing of
Oregon State two weeks ago.
With five different goal-scorers in
the match against Oregon State and
12 overall this season, the team has
made it a point not to rely on any
individual players to score. Different
players have scored each of
Stanford's last five goals.
However, leading scorer
Noguiera has already notched six
goals this season and 19 since she
began at Stanford. Of those career
goals, 14 have tied the score or been
game-winners, which is perhaps why
Ratcliffe chooses to push her up from
defensive midfield when the team
needs a goal.
Assuming it overcomes the diffi
culties it experienced on the road last
weekend, Stanford is well prepared
to further its championship hopes this
weekend. As a strong contender for
the national title, the team is expect
ed to raise its intensity, starting with
Arizona, before tournament play
begins in November.
The Cardinal will face the
Wildcats at 7 p.m. on Thursday
evening at Mulcahey Stadium in
Tucson, Ariz. The game will be broad
cast on the Pac-12 Networks.

for two narrow victories against Utah
and Colorado. While both were well
earned wins, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe admitted after the Utah
game, "We can get better in the final
third."

Against the Utes, the Cardinal
won 1-0 with senior Nina Watkins

entering the match in the 30th minute
and quickly scoring the only goal of
the game.
The Buffaloes proved to be an
even greater challenge, leading 1-0
with 15 minutes remaining despite
Stanford having dominated posses
sion and shot count. Still, two goals
within 37 seconds from seniors
Mariah Nogueria and Alina
Garciamendez assured another victo
ry for the Card.
Given the team's trouble scoring
over the weekend, Stanford has been
practicing shooting in training this
week.
"Lately we have really good pass
ing and connecting throughout the
field," said freshman forward Katie
Donahue. "Then we just need to be
consistent on our finishing in the final
third of the field."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal has
been a force this season, as in years
past. The team has continued their
36-game winning streak in the Pac
-12, which dates back to October 2008.
And problems finishing have not
defined the majority of the season
consider the team's 5-1 routing of
Oregon State two weeks ago.
With five different goal-scorers in
the match against Oregon State and
12 overall this season, the team has
made it a point not to rely on any
individual players to score. Different
players have scored each of
Stanford's last five goals.
However, leading scorer
Noguiera has already notched six
goals this season and 19 since she
began at Stanford. Of those career
goals, 14 have tied the score or been
game-winners, which is perhaps why
Ratcliffe chooses to push her up from
defensive midfield when the team
needs a goal.
Assuming it overcomes the diffi
culties it experienced on the road last
weekend, Stanford is well prepared
to further its championship hopes this
weekend. As a strong contender for
the national title, the team is expect
ed to raise its intensity, starting with
Arizona, before tournament play
begins in November.
The Cardinal will face the
Wildcats at 7 p.m. on Thursday
evening at Mulcahey Stadium in
Tucson, Ariz. The game will be broad
cast on the Pac-12 Networks.

Stanford's senior leadership has stepped up when called upon so far
this season. Midfielder Mariah Nogueria (above) scored her sixth goal
of the season last weekend as Stanford rallied past Colorado, 2-1.
