## New deans to expand e-learning Medical, engineering and business schools appoint associate deans 
### ELISE JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On the heels of the landmark creation of
the Office of the Vice Provost for Online
Learning (VPOL), some of Stanford's profes
sional schools have launched their own online
education initiatives. The School of Medicine,
School of Engineering and Graduate School of
Business (GSB) have each appointed associate
deans to lead their commitments to online
learning.
Bernd Girod, professor of electrical engi
neering, has been appointed dean for online
learning and professional development in the
School of Engineering. Charles Prober, senior
associate dean for medical education, is lead
ing the School of Medicine's online initiative.
Peter DeMarzo M.S. 'B5 Ph.D. 'B9, GSB senior
associate dean for academic affairs, is leading
the GSB's initiative.
Girod, Prober and DeMarzo were all mem
bers of the Advisory Committee on
Technology in Higher Education that
University President John Hennessy commis
sioned in February.
"The committee did not come up with a
roadmap for online learning, but recommend
ed more experimentation," Girod said.
In August, Computer Science Professor
John Mitchell was appointed to the newly cre
ated VPOL position, creating a University
wide authority in the space of online educa
tion.
School of Engineering Dean James
Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l appointed Girod
the following day.
"Bernd [Girod's] appointment recognizes
the rapidly growing importance of online
learning in engineering education," Plummer
said to the Stanford Report.
Nick McKeown, professor of electrical
engineering and computer science, described
the excitement around online learning in the
School of Engineering.
"If I stop in the corridor to talk to my col
leagues, we talk about teaching and online
teaching," McKeown said. "It's incredible the
enthusiasm and energy in this building related
to teaching right now."
The School of Engineering was indeed a
pioneer of long-distance learning, launching
the Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN) in 1969. Courses were streamed over
the Internet in the 1990s and the SITN became
the Stanford Center for Professional
Development (SCPD), now a top professional
development center among U.S. institutions of
higher education.
"If you look at the range of online courses
that are being produced, the vast majority are
coming out of the School of Engineering,"
Girod said.

In his new position, Girod is eager to bring
more flexibility to engineering students
through online education.

"We want to leverage the flexibility that
additional online offerings can bring to stu
dents to give them an overall better experi
ence," Girod said. "Classroom teaching and
contact with faculty will not be replaced, just
augmented."
For example, Girod plans to offer more

engineering undergraduate classes online to
give more undergraduates the opportunity to
participate study-abroad programs.
At the School of Medicine, Prober is eager to
lead the school's commitment to interactive
education. He currently leads the Stanford
Medicine Interactive Learning Initiatives, guid
ing the Medical School into what has the poten
tial to be a new era in medical education.

Prober is working with a team of education
technology specialists, physicians and other fac
ulty to adapt the existing medical curriculum to
new, interactive formats. He is also exploring

partnerships with other institutions.
At the GSB, DeMarzo, who was appointed
by Dean Garth Saloner M.A. 'Bl M.S. 'B2 Ph.D.
'B2, is also working with faculty to redesign
their courses with educational technology.
They are introducing a new Real-time Analysis
and Investment Lab (RAIL) that will enable
students to work with market data in real time.
Mitchell will meet regularly with Girod,
Prober and DeMarzo to coordinate each
school's program with the university-wide
online learning goals. According to Mitchell, no
other schools plan to add similar positions.
"It may or may not be the right idea for other
schools," he said. "I wouldn't read too much into
the distinction between schools that have and
have not created those types of positions."

Business (GSB) have each appointed associate
deans to lead their commitments to online
learning.
Bernd Girod, professor of electrical engi
neering, has been appointed dean for online
learning and professional development in the
School of Engineering. Charles Prober, senior
associate dean for medical education, is lead
ing the School of Medicine's online initiative.
Peter DeMarzo M.S. 'B5 Ph.D. 'B9, GSB senior
associate dean for academic affairs, is leading
the GSB's initiative.
Girod, Prober and DeMarzo were all mem
bers of the Advisory Committee on
Technology in Higher Education that
University President John Hennessy commis
sioned in February.
"The committee did not come up with a
roadmap for online learning, but recommend
ed more experimentation," Girod said.
In August, Computer Science Professor
John Mitchell was appointed to the newly cre
ated VPOL position, creating a University
wide authority in the space of online educa
tion.
School of Engineering Dean James
Plummer M.S. '67 Ph.D. '7l appointed Girod
the following day.
"Bernd [Girod's] appointment recognizes
the rapidly growing importance of online
learning in engineering education," Plummer
said to the Stanford Report.
Nick McKeown, professor of electrical
engineering and computer science, described
the excitement around online learning in the
School of Engineering.
"If I stop in the corridor to talk to my col
leagues, we talk about teaching and online
teaching," McKeown said. "It's incredible the
enthusiasm and energy in this building related
to teaching right now."
The School of Engineering was indeed a
pioneer of long-distance learning, launching
the Stanford Instructional Television Network
(SITN) in 1969. Courses were streamed over
the Internet in the 1990s and the SITN became
the Stanford Center for Professional
Development (SCPD), now a top professional
development center among U.S. institutions of
higher education.
"If you look at the range of online courses
that are being produced, the vast majority are
coming out of the School of Engineering,"
Girod said.

In his new position, Girod is eager to bring
more flexibility to engineering students
through online education.

"We want to leverage the flexibility that
additional online offerings can bring to stu
dents to give them an overall better experi
ence," Girod said. "Classroom teaching and
contact with faculty will not be replaced, just
augmented."
For example, Girod plans to offer more

engineering undergraduate classes online to
give more undergraduates the opportunity to
participate study-abroad programs.
At the School of Medicine, Prober is eager to
lead the school's commitment to interactive
education. He currently leads the Stanford
Medicine Interactive Learning Initiatives, guid
ing the Medical School into what has the poten
tial to be a new era in medical education.

Prober is working with a team of education
technology specialists, physicians and other fac
ulty to adapt the existing medical curriculum to
new, interactive formats. He is also exploring

partnerships with other institutions.
At the GSB, DeMarzo, who was appointed
by Dean Garth Saloner M.A. 'Bl M.S. 'B2 Ph.D.
'B2, is also working with faculty to redesign
their courses with educational technology.
They are introducing a new Real-time Analysis
and Investment Lab (RAIL) that will enable
students to work with market data in real time.
Mitchell will meet regularly with Girod,
Prober and DeMarzo to coordinate each
school's program with the university-wide
online learning goals. According to Mitchell, no
other schools plan to add similar positions.
"It may or may not be the right idea for other
schools," he said. "I wouldn't read too much into
the distinction between schools that have and
have not created those types of positions."
