The University has approved the first excep
tion to an 11-year-old policy prohibiting under
graduate student trips to countries on the U.S.
State Department's Travel Warning List. The
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) will
send a group of 15 students next summer to
spend three weeks in Israel, one of 33 nations on

September 2001.
"They gave us permission only after we
reviewed the State Department guidelines, fol

exactly what we would do to respond to any and
all security and safety concerns for the sake of
our faculty and our students involved," said
BOSP Director Ramon Saldfvar.
Planning the seminar
As a faculty member at Indiana University,
Weitzman taught a three-week summer overseas
program in Israel. When he moved to Stanford in
2009, he had hoped to continue leading these
student trips, only to discover that the University
had a policy explicitly prohibiting undergraduate
trips to countries with State Department travel
warnings.
"There was a lot of experience and a track
record in terms of running programs in Israel
[across U.S. universities]," Weitzman said. "So I
thought there was a reasonable argument to
make to the University about balancing the con
cern of student safety and the educational value
of letting students learn about the Middle East
firsthand."
He decided last February to submit apropos-
