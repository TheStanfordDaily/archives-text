# Israel BOSP seminar exempted
## Provost allows program in travel warning country 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY KURT CHIRBAS 
The University has approved the first excep
tion to an 11-year-old policy prohibiting under
graduate student trips to countries on the U.S.
State Department's Travel Warning List. The
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) will
send a group of 15 students next summer to
spend three weeks in Israel, one of 33 nations on
the U.S. Travel Warning List, as part of the
Overseas Seminar Program.
The trip, to be led by Steven Weitzman, pro
fessor of religion and Jewish culture, will explore
the sacred spaces of Christianity, Islam and
Judaism, traveling through Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel
Aviv and the Galilee.
After six months of conversations across four
University departments, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 made the final decision to
approve the seminar, exempting it from an inter
national travel policy that has been in place since
September 2001.
"They gave us permission only after we
reviewed the State Department guidelines, fol
lowed them to a T and itemized to the Provost

exactly what we would do to respond to any and
all security and safety concerns for the sake of
our faculty and our students involved," said
BOSP Director Ramon Saldfvar.
Planning the seminar
As a faculty member at Indiana University,
Weitzman taught a three-week summer overseas
program in Israel. When he moved to Stanford in
2009, he had hoped to continue leading these
student trips, only to discover that the University
had a policy explicitly prohibiting undergraduate
trips to countries with State Department travel
warnings.
"There was a lot of experience and a track
record in terms of running programs in Israel
[across U.S. universities]," Weitzman said. "So I
thought there was a reasonable argument to
make to the University about balancing the con
cern of student safety and the educational value
of letting students learn about the Middle East
firsthand."
He decided last February to submit apropos-
al to lead a BOSP Overseas
Seminar trip. Stanford
brought back this seminar
program which allows a
group of 12 to 15 undergradu
ates to travel overseas and
participate in a course led by a
Stanford faculty member
last academic year after it was
cut in 2010 during a round of
University-wide budget
reductions.
Weitzman's proposal was
one of 18 the University
received for the summer of
2013, according to Robert
Sinclair, former director of
BOSP.
Sinclair said BOSP was
excited by the proposal, par
ticularly since it had consid
ered offering a trip to Israel in
the summer of 2012, only to
have the professor who had
planned on leading the 2012
trip become unavailable.
"[Weitzman's proposal]
was enthusiastically received
by the BOSP Exec Committee,
which makes the decision
about which seminars to
choose," Sinclair said.
BOSP immediately sent its
recommendation to the Office
of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) to begin the process
of seeking approval, Sinclair
said.
Before submitting the pro
posal to Etchemendy, the
BOSP and VPUE offices held
discussions with the Office of
Risk Management to discuss
security concerns in the region
and to better understand the
parts of travel warning that
the proposal would have to
respond to.
"It's not a simple process.
You have to do all the
research, line up all the proce

dures that you're going to fol
low, actually find out that you
can do [those procedures],"
Saldivar said.

Travel policy and exceptions
process

VPUE Harry Elam wrote
in an email to The Daily that
the Provost's travel policy
applies to the entire universi
ty, and that only the Provost
can make exceptions to the
guidelines. Elam said the poli
cy especially applies to BOSP
and Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR) due to
the fact that they primarily
work with undergraduate stu
dents. The Provost issues
exceptions on a case-by-case
basis.

Brian Thomas, associate
dean of undergraduate research
opportunities; wrote in an email
to The Daily that UAR will
continue to adhere to the
Provost's policy despite the
exception for the Israel semi
nar. He commented that the
UAR has security standards
that proposals in all countries
must meet.

"UAR policy is actually
somewhat more strict [than
BOSP], since our reviewers
will also turn down proposals
that do not adequately address
safety concerns, whether the
destination has a travel warn
ing or not," Thomas said.

State Department Warnings
The State Department has
issued various levels of warn
ings about travel in Israel,
from "urging" U.S. citizens to
educate themselves about
security factors while travel
ing in Israel and the West
Bank to "strongly urging" citi
zens to avoid the Gaza Strip.

Administrators said the
seminar will not travel to areas
of Israel and the Palestinian
territories that are under spe
cific advisory warnings from
the federal government.

"In addition to avoiding
travel to the Gaza Strip, the
seminar will not visit sites
located in Southern Israel, the
West Bank and specific areas
in Jerusalem considered to be
unsafe by the Israeli Ministry
of Tourism," said Tina
Dobleman, assistant vice pres
ident for risk management.
General travel warnings,
including the one on Israel,
apply to whole nations.
According to the State
Department, "travel warnings
are issued when long-term,
protracted conditions that
make a country dangerous or
unstable lead the State
Department to recommend
that Americans avoid or con
sider the risk of travel to that
country."
The University has proto
cols for these protracted con
ditions as well, according to
Saldfvar.

"The State Department
Travel Warnings are pretty
eminent. They're paramount
in our consideration," Saldfvar
said. "We can't do [a trip] if we
don't have the proper proto
cols in place for making sure
that we pay attention to the
minutest detail outlined in the
State Department Travel
Bulletins."

These protocols include
preparing for the possibility of
students being injured in ter
rorist attacks and being
injured in protests that
become violent, according to
Dobleman.

"[Global services provider]
International SOS maintains a
24/7 alarm call-in center to
provide immediate access to
medical consultation, local
medical referrals [and] medical
case management in the event
of injury or hospitalization, as
well as evacuation arrange
ments if medically necessary,"
Dobleman said.

Saldivar said that a private
agency will provide in-country

security for the members of
the seminar. He added that
BOSP has the discretion to
cancel the trip in the event of
regional instability.
"The agreement to do this
[trip] is provisional to the
ongoing safety of everyone
concerned," Saldfvar said. "It's
hard to predict what will be
the international politics will
be a year from now."
Remaining questions
Potential discrimination
against students of certain
nationalities and the implica
tions of this provisional policy
exception for student travel to
Israel remain unclear.
The State Department has
specific entry and exit warn
ings for activists and "U.S. citi
zens whom Israeli authorities
suspect of being of Arab,
Middle Eastern or Muslim
origin." These groups "may
face additional, often time
consuming and probing ques
tioning by immigration and
border authorities, or may
even be denied entry into
Israel, the West Bank, or
Gaza."

Saldfvar expressed a
University commitment to
providing equal access to
Stanford-organized program
ming.
"Our policy at Stanford
always is that programs that
we approve and that we make
available to our students are
available equally to all of our
students," Saldfvar said.
Elam and Dobleman
wrote that Stanford worked to
facilitate the visa process for
students who may face diffi
culty entering Israel based on
their nationalities and con
cluded that the decision to
admit or deny anyone to the
country is up to Israeli immi
gration policy.
"We will work with accept
ed non-U.S. citizens to facili
tate visas but as with any trav
el outside the United States,
there is the possibility that
particular nationalities may
not be able to obtain a visa,"
Dobleman said. "This is deter
mined solely by the host coun
try and we will have to comply
with Israeli immigration poli
cy in this regard."
UAR deferred comment

on how this exception might
apply to future students inter
ested in traveling to Israel out
side of BOSP programming to
the Office of the Vice Provost.
Elam said that the Provost
evaluates each request sepa
rately.

BOSP, the Office of the
Provost, Risk Management
and VPUE co-submitted a
statement that reads: "The
benefit of this profound learn
ing experience reflects
Stanford's commitment to
understanding and engaging
in global issues."
All four University depart
ments said that the seminar
will meet a strong student
demand for programming in
the Middle East.
An information session on
the seminar, "Between
Heaven and Earth: Exploring
Sacred Space in Judaism,
Christianity and Islam," will
be held in Sweet Hall on
Monday, Oct. 15.

Travel policy and exceptions
process

VPUE Harry Elam wrote
in an email to The Daily that
the Provost's travel policy
applies to the entire universi
ty, and that only the Provost
can make exceptions to the
guidelines. Elam said the poli
cy especially applies to BOSP
and Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR) due to
the fact that they primarily
work with undergraduate stu
dents. The Provost issues
exceptions on a case-by-case
basis.

Brian Thomas, associate
dean of undergraduate research
opportunities; wrote in an email
to The Daily that UAR will
continue to adhere to the
Provost's policy despite the
exception for the Israel semi
nar. He commented that the
UAR has security standards
that proposals in all countries
must meet.

"UAR policy is actually
somewhat more strict [than
BOSP], since our reviewers
will also turn down proposals
that do not adequately address
safety concerns, whether the
destination has a travel warn
ing or not," Thomas said.

State Department Warnings
The State Department has
issued various levels of warn
ings about travel in Israel,
from "urging" U.S. citizens to
educate themselves about
security factors while travel
ing in Israel and the West
Bank to "strongly urging" citi
zens to avoid the Gaza Strip.

Administrators said the
seminar will not travel to areas
of Israel and the Palestinian
territories that are under spe
cific advisory warnings from
the federal government.

"In addition to avoiding
travel to the Gaza Strip, the
seminar will not visit sites
located in Southern Israel, the
West Bank and specific areas
in Jerusalem considered to be
unsafe by the Israeli Ministry
of Tourism," said Tina
Dobleman, assistant vice pres
ident for risk management.
General travel warnings,
including the one on Israel,
apply to whole nations.
According to the State
Department, "travel warnings
are issued when long-term,
protracted conditions that
make a country dangerous or
unstable lead the State
Department to recommend
that Americans avoid or con
sider the risk of travel to that
country."
The University has proto
cols for these protracted con
ditions as well, according to
Saldfvar.

"The State Department
Travel Warnings are pretty
eminent. They're paramount
in our consideration," Saldfvar
said. "We can't do [a trip] if we
don't have the proper proto
cols in place for making sure
that we pay attention to the
minutest detail outlined in the
State Department Travel
Bulletins."

These protocols include
preparing for the possibility of
students being injured in ter
rorist attacks and being
injured in protests that
become violent, according to
Dobleman.

"[Global services provider]
International SOS maintains a
24/7 alarm call-in center to
provide immediate access to
medical consultation, local
medical referrals [and] medical
case management in the event
of injury or hospitalization, as
well as evacuation arrange
ments if medically necessary,"
Dobleman said.

Saldivar said that a private
agency will provide in-country

security for the members of
the seminar. He added that
BOSP has the discretion to
cancel the trip in the event of
regional instability.
"The agreement to do this
[trip] is provisional to the
ongoing safety of everyone
concerned," Saldfvar said. "It's
hard to predict what will be
the international politics will
be a year from now."
Remaining questions
Potential discrimination
against students of certain
nationalities and the implica
tions of this provisional policy
exception for student travel to
Israel remain unclear.
The State Department has
specific entry and exit warn
ings for activists and "U.S. citi
zens whom Israeli authorities
suspect of being of Arab,
Middle Eastern or Muslim
origin." These groups "may
face additional, often time
consuming and probing ques
tioning by immigration and
border authorities, or may
even be denied entry into
Israel, the West Bank, or
Gaza."

Saldfvar expressed a
University commitment to
providing equal access to
Stanford-organized program
ming.
"Our policy at Stanford
always is that programs that
we approve and that we make
available to our students are
available equally to all of our
students," Saldfvar said.
Elam and Dobleman
wrote that Stanford worked to
facilitate the visa process for
students who may face diffi
culty entering Israel based on
their nationalities and con
cluded that the decision to
admit or deny anyone to the
country is up to Israeli immi
gration policy.
"We will work with accept
ed non-U.S. citizens to facili
tate visas but as with any trav
el outside the United States,
there is the possibility that
particular nationalities may
not be able to obtain a visa,"
Dobleman said. "This is deter
mined solely by the host coun
try and we will have to comply
with Israeli immigration poli
cy in this regard."
UAR deferred comment

on how this exception might
apply to future students inter
ested in traveling to Israel out
side of BOSP programming to
the Office of the Vice Provost.
Elam said that the Provost
evaluates each request sepa
rately.

BOSP, the Office of the
Provost, Risk Management
and VPUE co-submitted a
statement that reads: "The
benefit of this profound learn
ing experience reflects
Stanford's commitment to
understanding and engaging
in global issues."
All four University depart
ments said that the seminar
will meet a strong student
demand for programming in
the Middle East.
An information session on
the seminar, "Between
Heaven and Earth: Exploring
Sacred Space in Judaism,
Christianity and Islam," will
be held in Sweet Hall on
Monday, Oct. 15.

The University has approved the first excep
tion to an 11-year-old policy prohibiting under
graduate student trips to countries on the U.S.
State Department's Travel Warning List. The
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) will
send a group of 15 students next summer to
spend three weeks in Israel, one of 33 nations on
the U.S. Travel Warning List, as part of the
Overseas Seminar Program.
The trip, to be led by Steven Weitzman, pro
fessor of religion and Jewish culture, will explore
the sacred spaces of Christianity, Islam and
Judaism, traveling through Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel
Aviv and the Galilee.
After six months of conversations across four
University departments, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 made the final decision to
approve the seminar, exempting it from an inter
national travel policy that has been in place since
September 2001.
"They gave us permission only after we
reviewed the State Department guidelines, fol
lowed them to a T and itemized to the Provost

exactly what we would do to respond to any and
all security and safety concerns for the sake of
our faculty and our students involved," said
BOSP Director Ramon Saldfvar.
Planning the seminar
As a faculty member at Indiana University,
Weitzman taught a three-week summer overseas
program in Israel. When he moved to Stanford in
2009, he had hoped to continue leading these
student trips, only to discover that the University
had a policy explicitly prohibiting undergraduate
trips to countries with State Department travel
warnings.
"There was a lot of experience and a track
record in terms of running programs in Israel
[across U.S. universities]," Weitzman said. "So I
thought there was a reasonable argument to
make to the University about balancing the con
cern of student safety and the educational value
of letting students learn about the Middle East
firsthand."
He decided last February to submit apropos-
al to lead a BOSP Overseas
Seminar trip. Stanford
brought back this seminar
program which allows a
group of 12 to 15 undergradu
ates to travel overseas and
participate in a course led by a
Stanford faculty member
last academic year after it was
cut in 2010 during a round of
University-wide budget
reductions.
Weitzman's proposal was
one of 18 the University
received for the summer of
2013, according to Robert
Sinclair, former director of
BOSP.
Sinclair said BOSP was
excited by the proposal, par
ticularly since it had consid
ered offering a trip to Israel in
the summer of 2012, only to
have the professor who had
planned on leading the 2012
trip become unavailable.
"[Weitzman's proposal]
was enthusiastically received
by the BOSP Exec Committee,
which makes the decision
about which seminars to
choose," Sinclair said.
BOSP immediately sent its
recommendation to the Office
of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) to begin the process
of seeking approval, Sinclair
said.
Before submitting the pro
posal to Etchemendy, the
BOSP and VPUE offices held
discussions with the Office of
Risk Management to discuss
security concerns in the region
and to better understand the
parts of travel warning that
the proposal would have to
respond to.
"It's not a simple process.

case management in the event
of injury or hospitalization, as
well as evacuation arrange
ments if medically necessary,"
Dobleman said.

Saldivar said that a private
agency will provide in-country

security for the members of
the seminar. He added that
BOSP has the discretion to
cancel the trip in the event of
regional instability.
"The agreement to do this
[trip] is provisional to the
ongoing safety of everyone
concerned," Saldfvar said. "It's
hard to predict what will be
the international politics will
be a year from now."
Remaining questions
Potential discrimination
against students of certain
nationalities and the implica
tions of this provisional policy
exception for student travel to
Israel remain unclear.
The State Department has
specific entry and exit warn
ings for activists and "U.S. citi
zens whom Israeli authorities
suspect of being of Arab,
Middle Eastern or Muslim
origin." These groups "may
face additional, often time
consuming and probing ques
tioning by immigration and
border authorities, or may
even be denied entry into
Israel, the West Bank, or
Gaza."

Saldfvar expressed a
University commitment to
providing equal access to
Stanford-organized program
ming.
"Our policy at Stanford
always is that programs that
we approve and that we make
available to our students are
available equally to all of our
students," Saldfvar said.
Elam and Dobleman
wrote that Stanford worked to
facilitate the visa process for
students who may face diffi
culty entering Israel based on
their nationalities and con
cluded that the decision to
admit or deny anyone to the
country is up to Israeli immi
gration policy.
"We will work with accept
ed non-U.S. citizens to facili
tate visas but as with any trav
el outside the United States,
there is the possibility that
particular nationalities may
not be able to obtain a visa,"
Dobleman said. "This is deter
mined solely by the host coun
try and we will have to comply
with Israeli immigration poli
cy in this regard."
UAR deferred comment

on how this exception might
apply to future students inter
ested in traveling to Israel out
side of BOSP programming to
the Office of the Vice Provost.
Elam said that the Provost
evaluates each request sepa
rately.

BOSP, the Office of the
Provost, Risk Management
and VPUE co-submitted a
statement that reads: "The
benefit of this profound learn
ing experience reflects
Stanford's commitment to
understanding and engaging
in global issues."
All four University depart
ments said that the seminar
will meet a strong student
demand for programming in
the Middle East.
An information session on
the seminar, "Between
Heaven and Earth: Exploring
Sacred Space in Judaism,
Christianity and Islam," will
be held in Sweet Hall on
Monday, Oct. 15.

The University has approved the first excep
tion to an 11-year-old policy prohibiting under
graduate student trips to countries on the U.S.
State Department's Travel Warning List. The
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) will
send a group of 15 students next summer to
spend three weeks in Israel, one of 33 nations on
the U.S. Travel Warning List, as part of the
Overseas Seminar Program.
The trip, to be led by Steven Weitzman, pro
fessor of religion and Jewish culture, will explore
the sacred spaces of Christianity, Islam and
Judaism, traveling through Jerusalem, Haifa, Tel
Aviv and the Galilee.
After six months of conversations across four
University departments, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 made the final decision to
approve the seminar, exempting it from an inter
national travel policy that has been in place since
September 2001.
"They gave us permission only after we
reviewed the State Department guidelines, fol
lowed them to a T and itemized to the Provost

exactly what we would do to respond to any and
all security and safety concerns for the sake of
our faculty and our students involved," said
BOSP Director Ramon Saldfvar.
Planning the seminar
As a faculty member at Indiana University,
Weitzman taught a three-week summer overseas
program in Israel. When he moved to Stanford in
2009, he had hoped to continue leading these
student trips, only to discover that the University
had a policy explicitly prohibiting undergraduate
trips to countries with State Department travel
warnings.
"There was a lot of experience and a track
record in terms of running programs in Israel
[across U.S. universities]," Weitzman said. "So I
thought there was a reasonable argument to
make to the University about balancing the con
cern of student safety and the educational value
of letting students learn about the Middle East
firsthand."
He decided last February to submit apropos-
al to lead a BOSP Overseas
Seminar trip. Stanford
brought back this seminar
program which allows a
group of 12 to 15 undergradu
ates to travel overseas and
participate in a course led by a
Stanford faculty member
last academic year after it was
cut in 2010 during a round of
University-wide budget
reductions.
Weitzman's proposal was
one of 18 the University
received for the summer of
2013, according to Robert
Sinclair, former director of
BOSP.
Sinclair said BOSP was
excited by the proposal, par
ticularly since it had consid
ered offering a trip to Israel in
the summer of 2012, only to
have the professor who had
planned on leading the 2012
trip become unavailable.
"[Weitzman's proposal]
was enthusiastically received
by the BOSP Exec Committee,
which makes the decision
about which seminars to
choose," Sinclair said.
BOSP immediately sent its
recommendation to the Office
of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) to begin the process
of seeking approval, Sinclair
said.
Before submitting the pro
posal to Etchemendy, the
BOSP and VPUE offices held
discussions with the Office of
Risk Management to discuss
security concerns in the region
and to better understand the
parts of travel warning that
the proposal would have to
respond to.
"It's not a simple process.
You have to do all the
research, line up all the proce

dures that you're going to fol
low, actually find out that you
can do [those procedures],"
Saldivar said.

Travel policy and exceptions
process

VPUE Harry Elam wrote
in an email to The Daily that
the Provost's travel policy
applies to the entire universi
ty, and that only the Provost
can make exceptions to the
guidelines. Elam said the poli
cy especially applies to BOSP
and Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR) due to
the fact that they primarily
work with undergraduate stu
dents. The Provost issues
exceptions on a case-by-case
basis.

Brian Thomas, associate
dean of undergraduate research
opportunities; wrote in an email
to The Daily that UAR will
continue to adhere to the
Provost's policy despite the
exception for the Israel semi
nar. He commented that the
UAR has security standards
that proposals in all countries
must meet.

"UAR policy is actually
somewhat more strict [than
BOSP], since our reviewers
will also turn down proposals
that do not adequately address
safety concerns, whether the
destination has a travel warn
ing or not," Thomas said.

State Department Warnings
The State Department has
issued various levels of warn
ings about travel in Israel,
from "urging" U.S. citizens to
educate themselves about
security factors while travel
ing in Israel and the West
Bank to "strongly urging" citi
zens to avoid the Gaza Strip.

Administrators said the
seminar will not travel to areas
of Israel and the Palestinian
territories that are under spe
cific advisory warnings from
the federal government.

"In addition to avoiding
travel to the Gaza Strip, the
seminar will not visit sites
located in Southern Israel, the
West Bank and specific areas
in Jerusalem considered to be
unsafe by the Israeli Ministry
of Tourism," said Tina
Dobleman, assistant vice pres
ident for risk management.
General travel warnings,
including the one on Israel,
apply to whole nations.
According to the State
Department, "travel warnings
are issued when long-term,
protracted conditions that
make a country dangerous or
unstable lead the State
Department to recommend
that Americans avoid or con
sider the risk of travel to that
country."
The University has proto
cols for these protracted con
ditions as well, according to
Saldfvar.

"The State Department
Travel Warnings are pretty
eminent. They're paramount
in our consideration," Saldfvar
said. "We can't do [a trip] if we
don't have the proper proto
cols in place for making sure
that we pay attention to the
minutest detail outlined in the
State Department Travel
Bulletins."

These protocols include
preparing for the possibility of
students being injured in ter
rorist attacks and being
injured in protests that
become violent, according to
Dobleman.

"[Global services provider]
International SOS maintains a
24/7 alarm call-in center to
provide immediate access to
medical consultation, local
medical referrals [and] medical
case management in the event
of injury or hospitalization, as
well as evacuation arrange
ments if medically necessary,"
Dobleman said.

Saldivar said that a private
agency will provide in-country

security for the members of
the seminar. He added that
BOSP has the discretion to
cancel the trip in the event of
regional instability.
"The agreement to do this
[trip] is provisional to the
ongoing safety of everyone
concerned," Saldfvar said. "It's
