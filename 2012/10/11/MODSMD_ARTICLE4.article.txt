# Q&A Vice Provost John Mitchell talks online ed
## 
### â€”Aaron Sekhri 
John Mitchell, the new Vice Provost for Online
Education (VPOL), recently sat down with
The Daily to discuss his position and plans for
the office. Mitchell is the Mary and Gordon
Crary Family Professor in the School of
Engineering and was announced as the new VPOL
in August.
Mitchell's responsibilities include coordinating
experiments in online education with members of
Stanford faculty, liaising between schools to estab
lish a set of best practices and allocating seed fund
ing to faculty for projects relating to online teaching
and education.
The Stanford Daily (TSD) : Your office was the only
the third Vice Provost-ship created at Stanford in
over 20 years. What do you believe was the impetus
behind the formation of this office at this point in
time?
John Mitchell (JM): One of the reasons this was to
be an Office of the Vice Provost as opposed to [a
position] within an individual school or department
is because there are a lot of issues that cut across the
University. All of [the schools] can, in varying ways,
benefit from new teaching and learning schools. One
of the ideas is to collect and process expertise cen
trally to benefit the entire University, and if some
thing exciting happens in one department or school,
we provide a mechanism for sharing that informa

tion across the University to help everyone benefit.
TSD: Why were you chosen for the role, and why
did you accept the position?
JM: I started, about three-and-a-half years ago
maybe, working on a web platform for supporting
the experiments in teaching and learning. And out of
that came some experiments with the flipped class
room And other ideas that we developed were
discussion forums for students and course staff to
talk online. So I was already involved in some of the
ideas and developing the technology; there are
many other capable people on campus, and some
how I was chosen. For me it's a great opportunity
after being here 25 years to give back to the
University in some form and help everyone across
campus. [I want to] take advantage of the technolo
gy I know and love, but it's beyond a technology
effort and the focus is on teaching and learning.
TSD: What are Stanford's peer universities doing in
the same space? How does Stanford's approach
compare to, let's say, MIT and Harvard's EdX?
JM: [EdX] addresses some part of the topic area...
but the larger part of the issue is how do we develop
good teaching and learning materials. It's easy to
build a platform; in a sense, it's a software problem..
.. But it's another thing getting
new teaching and learning ideas
adopted across campus and
engaging the faculty help figure
out how to do this right. One
thing that really works for
Stanford is to make it a faculty
driven process. We're not trying
to have a top-down, central
planning process. Some of the
other universities have been
more top down in choosing
courses and in how they work
with faculty.

TSD: So, does Stanford lead the
pack?
JM: I think so. We really were
the starting point for the current
wave of massive open online
courses.... We got off to a very
good start, we've probably put
out as many courses online as
any other universities.... A lot
of other universities have put
out lists of courses to be put
online but as far as what we have
actually done, we have been
very successful in comparison
with others.

TSD: What is the process of pro
viding faculty with seed grants to
move their courses online?
What are the grants used for?
JM: The process involves faculty
writing a little proposal; we've
tried to fund as many of them as

we can. Our criteria involve cre
ativity: Does somebody have a
new idea? Are they going to
explore something in a different
way? And are we going to learn
something new about online
teaching and learning from it?..
. The funding really goes to sup
port the process of building the
course material.
TSD: What are the sums usually
given to faculty?
JM: We've been allocating up to
$25,000 per project; that seems
to have been enough to help
each one get going.
TSD: What specific policy plans
does the office have? Do you
have a timeline for the various
goals you have for this year and
in the years following?
JM: Not a specific, hard time
line; many of the things are
driven by faculty initiatives....
We would like to see a continu
ing stream of online courses at
the same rate as we have had.
I'd like to see some more visible
activities on campus, people
taking their on-campus course
and using technology in inter
esting ways. I think we will see
in a couple of years... master's
degree programs or things from
specific fields in specific schools
where the topic is more
amenable to that.
TSD: What about the criticism
that humanities courses are not
best fit for this platform?
JM: The answers aren't all in on

that. You can ask multiple
choice or fill-in-the-blank ques
tions about history or philoso
phy or politics, but I think what's
missing is the idea of a creative
written expression of something
substantive. We don't know real
ly know at this point how t0...
understand that automatically.
There can be a peer-evaluation
process.
TSD: Some people feel that
when a course is made by
Stanford faculty for Stanford
students, broadcasting it almost
diminishes the feeling of receiv
ing them live, on campus. What
do you say to that critique?
JM: I hope people don't feel
short-changed. I think that we
are, or at least should be, offering
something to Stanford students
that off-campus students don't
get. Watching a lecture halfway
around the world on a two-by
two [inch] screen is different
from actually being able to meet
the lecturer in office hours.
TSD: Where do you see your
office in five years?
JM: Hopefully we'll have an
office! [laughs] I don't think this
movement is going to go away;
I think we'll stabilize in some
form and we may have new
kinds of educational institu
tions; and I think many of the
things we see as futuristic will
become commonplace in lots of
courses.
