# Q&A Vice Provost John Mitchell talks online ed
## 
### â€”Aaron Sekhri 
John Mitchell, the new Vice Provost for Online
Education (VPOL), recently sat down with
The Daily to discuss his position and plans for
the office. Mitchell is the Mary and Gordon
Crary Family Professor in the School of
Engineering and was announced as the new VPOL
in August.
Mitchell's responsibilities include coordinating
experiments in online education with members of
Stanford faculty, liaising between schools to estab
lish a set of best practices and allocating seed fund
ing to faculty for projects relating to online teaching
and education.
The Stanford Daily (TSD) : Your office was the only
the third Vice Provost-ship created at Stanford in
over 20 years. What do you believe was the impetus
behind the formation of this office at this point in
time?
John Mitchell (JM): One of the reasons this was to
be an Office of the Vice Provost as opposed to [a
position] within an individual school or department
is because there are a lot of issues that cut across the
University. All of [the schools] can, in varying ways,
benefit from new teaching and learning schools. One
of the ideas is to collect and process expertise cen
trally to benefit the entire University, and if some
thing exciting happens in one department or school,
we provide a mechanism for sharing that informa

tion across the University to help everyone benefit.
TSD: Why were you chosen for the role, and why
did you accept the position?
JM: I started, about three-and-a-half years ago
maybe, working on a web platform for supporting
the experiments in teaching and learning. And out of
that came some experiments with the flipped class
room And other ideas that we developed were
discussion forums for students and course staff to
talk online. So I was already involved in some of the
ideas and developing the technology; there are
many other capable people on campus, and some
how I was chosen. For me it's a great opportunity
after being here 25 years to give back to the
University in some form and help everyone across
campus. [I want to] take advantage of the technolo
gy I know and love, but it's beyond a technology
effort and the focus is on teaching and learning.
TSD: What are Stanford's peer universities doing in
the same space? How does Stanford's approach
compare to, let's say, MIT and Harvard's EdX?
JM: [EdX] addresses some part of the topic area...
but the larger part of the issue is how do we develop
good teaching and learning materials. It's easy to
build a platform; in a sense, it's a software problem..
