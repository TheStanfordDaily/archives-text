## Kobilka receives Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
### NATASHA WEASER DESK EDITOR 
Brian Kobilka, professor and
chair of molecular and cellular physi
ology at the School of Medicine, won
the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He
received the phone call from the
Nobel committee at 2:20 a.m. on
Wednesday morning.
The prize was awarded to Kobilka
for his work on G-protein-coupled
receptors: proteins found on the sur
face of cells that transmit information
across cell membranes. He shares the
$1.2 million prize with Robert
Lefkowitz, a Duke University profes
sor of biochemistry and medicine.
"I didn't believe it at first, but after
I spoke with about five people they
handed the phone around with
really convincing Swedish accents, I
started to think it was for real,"
Kobilka said in an interview with
Stanford News Service.

A press conference was held at 10
a.m. Wednesday morning in the Paul
Berg Conference Room, at which
Kobilka, University President John

Hennessy and Dean of the School of
Medicine Philip Pizzo spoke.
"[Winning the Nobel Prize] speaks
to several things: endurance, bnlliance,
dedication, commitment to assailing
the odds because you really passion

ately believe in something," Pizzo said
at the press conference. "You
[Kobilka] epitomize what is really
great about science."
Hennessy noted that the award is
Stanford's 27th Nobel Prize,
"It is both humble and gratifying
a tradition of excellence in research
and what our faculty has been able to
do," he said.
Kobilka emphasized the "incredible
collaborative effort" involved in his
research, which began in the 1980s.
"I hope that we can translate these
discoveries to develop more safer, more
effective drugs and more economically
developed drugs," he said in an inter
view with Reuters.
Stanford currently has 17 living
Nobel Laureates, two of whom were
awarded the prize in Chemistry. They
are Roger Romberg, who won the
prize in 2006 for his work on DNA
transcription and Paul Berg, who won
the prize in 1980 for his work on
nucleic acids in recombinant DNA.
