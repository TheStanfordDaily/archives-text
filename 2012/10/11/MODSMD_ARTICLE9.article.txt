## Drinking that green Kool-Aid 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Wow. Just, wow. I don't
pretend to have seen
it all, especially since
I know that when it
comes to the ever
overflowing fountain that is the wide
world of sports, something incredible and
new and exciting is just around the cor
ner. There were like a million no-hitters
this year and a perfect game for a fran
chise that hadn't seen one in some 50
years.
But man, I didn't see this coming.
Oakland, keep drinking that Kool-Aid,
because it is working some magic.
If you didn't see it, stop reading this
and go watch what the A's did to the
Detroit Tigers at O.Co. Coliseum last
night. It was basically the opposite of the
greatest love story ever told.
Down two games to none in the best
of-five Division Series, Oakland should
have folded. The clock was striking mid
night for Billy Beane, Bob Melvin and
the team with the lowest payroll in the
major leagues.
I mean come, on, seriously. Detroit has
the fifth highest payroll at $132,000,000
and Oaktown is more along the lines of
$55,000,000. The A's scratched and
clawed their way to a well-earned win in
Game 3. Congratulations, little guys!
What an accomplishment; now it's time
for bed. That's basically what Detroit
manager Jim Leyland said after the
game.
Because last night, Leyland was sup
posed to be right and the series was sup
posed to be over. Max Scherzer was on
the hill for the Tigers and he was dealing.
Seven of the first 15 batters struck out,
and just one base runner reached base in
the first four innings. Take a hint,
Oakland, it's over.
When Prince Fielder mashed a ball
way up into the right-field bleachers for a
2-0 lead, it was over.
When the A's actually got to Scherzer
in the sixth inning because Prince Fielder
did what Prince Fielder does and badly
misplayed a hard groundball to first base
that turned into a two-base error, it was
still over because Stephen Drew ran
straight into a rally-killing putout at third
base.
The Tigers' bullpen is lights-out, and
they were lights-out again. Octavio
Dotel, Phil Coke and A1 Alburquerque
were perfect, and Joaquin Benoit struck
out Brandon Moss to give the ball to Jose
Valverde, the dude who blew exactly
zero saves last season and saved 49, with
a 3-1 lead in the ninth inning. Game.
Over.
Aren't sports great?
When I go to a concert and watch
Itzhak Perlman play the violin, I know
what he will play, I know when he will
play it and I know he won't mess up.
These things I know.
When I go into a big test, I don't know
what will be on it, I don't know how to do
the problems, but I do know that I will
fail. These things I also know.
But when I watch the bottom of the
ninth from a rocking concrete slab in
Alameda, I have no idea what is going to
happen.
I guess there really was no other log
ical way for things to play out.
Josh Reddick led off the ninth with a

single, and then Josh Donaldson
doubled off the left-field wall.
Seth Smith doubled them home
with a gapper to right-center off
Valverde. And after pinch hitter
George Kottaras popped up and
Cliff Pennington struck out just
for a little extra two-out drama,
Crisp hit the first pitch into right
field.

I hate the A's for what they do
to my Red Sox seemingly every
time I watch them live, but that's
just awesome.

How can you not root for
them? They strike out like all the
time, hit home runs and are basi
cally a bunch of absolute goof
balls who just like to "Bernie"
and "Rage." Just look at them
partying on the infield after

Smith crossed the plate.
And they come up clutch.
Crisp's hit was the 16th walkoff
victory for the As this season. If
you don't follow baseball, that
is a lot.

If you don't like clutch hit
ting and drama, maybe you
don't have a pulse. Or maybe
you just need more history. Like
how rookie AJ. Griffin was the
third Oakland rookie pitcher to
start a game this series on
Wednesday, the most ever by a
team in a single postseason.
Ever.

Maybe you just don't like
change, which I totally get. I hate
getting newer computers and
phones because I just can't han
dle the faster processors and
longer battery Mfe, so I totally
understand (jk, lol).
But seriously, this isn't even
new. The A's swept Texas in the
last three games of the regular
season to win the A.L. West in

stunning fashion. Those games
were awesome, and these are
even awesomer.
I know this hasn't been my
best writing, and I know plenty
of you Giants fans are pumped
your team also has a second
crack at the apple today when
Cinncinati tries to choke once
again. Let's just let the A's have this
moment in the sun, so that every
one forgets that "Moneyball"
didn't talk about winning cham
pionships because there were no
championships to win.

Miles Bennett-Smith traded
his tickets to Wednesday's
game for the chance to win a
meet-and-greet with Red Sox
legend Pedro Martinez, only
to find out he had been duped
and would only be able to
meet with Pedro's lesser
known brother, Peter. Chide
him for his foolishness at
milesbs@stanford. edu.

were perfect, and Joaquin Benoit struck
out Brandon Moss to give the ball to Jose
Valverde, the dude who blew exactly
zero saves last season and saved 49, with
a 3-1 lead in the ninth inning. Game.
Over.
Aren't sports great?
When I go to a concert and watch
Itzhak Perlman play the violin, I know
what he will play, I know when he will
play it and I know he won't mess up.
These things I know.
When I go into a big test, I don't know
what will be on it, I don't know how to do
the problems, but I do know that I will
fail. These things I also know.
But when I watch the bottom of the
ninth from a rocking concrete slab in
Alameda, I have no idea what is going to
happen.
I guess there really was no other log
ical way for things to play out.
Josh Reddick led off the ninth with a

single, and then Josh Donaldson
doubled off the left-field wall.
Seth Smith doubled them home
with a gapper to right-center off
Valverde. And after pinch hitter
George Kottaras popped up and
Cliff Pennington struck out just
for a little extra two-out drama,
Crisp hit the first pitch into right
field.

I hate the A's for what they do
to my Red Sox seemingly every
time I watch them live, but that's
just awesome.

How can you not root for
them? They strike out like all the
time, hit home runs and are basi
cally a bunch of absolute goof
balls who just like to "Bernie"
and "Rage." Just look at them
partying on the infield after

Smith crossed the plate.
And they come up clutch.
Crisp's hit was the 16th walkoff
victory for the As this season. If
you don't follow baseball, that
is a lot.

If you don't like clutch hit
ting and drama, maybe you
don't have a pulse. Or maybe
you just need more history. Like
how rookie AJ. Griffin was the
third Oakland rookie pitcher to
start a game this series on
Wednesday, the most ever by a
team in a single postseason.
Ever.

Maybe you just don't like
change, which I totally get. I hate
getting newer computers and
phones because I just can't han
dle the faster processors and
longer battery Mfe, so I totally
understand (jk, lol).
But seriously, this isn't even
new. The A's swept Texas in the
last three games of the regular
season to win the A.L. West in

stunning fashion. Those games
were awesome, and these are
even awesomer.
I know this hasn't been my
best writing, and I know plenty
of you Giants fans are pumped
your team also has a second
crack at the apple today when
Cinncinati tries to choke once
again. Let's just let the A's have this
moment in the sun, so that every
one forgets that "Moneyball"
didn't talk about winning cham
pionships because there were no
championships to win.

Miles Bennett-Smith traded
his tickets to Wednesday's
game for the chance to win a
meet-and-greet with Red Sox
legend Pedro Martinez, only
to find out he had been duped
and would only be able to
meet with Pedro's lesser
known brother, Peter. Chide
him for his foolishness at
milesbs@stanford. edu.
Wow. Just, wow. I don't
pretend to have seen
it all, especially since
I know that when it
comes to the ever
overflowing fountain that is the wide
world of sports, something incredible and
new and exciting is just around the cor
ner. There were like a million no-hitters
this year and a perfect game for a fran
chise that hadn't seen one in some 50
years.
But man, I didn't see this coming.
Oakland, keep drinking that Kool-Aid,
because it is working some magic.
If you didn't see it, stop reading this
and go watch what the A's did to the
Detroit Tigers at O.Co. Coliseum last
night. It was basically the opposite of the
greatest love story ever told.
Down two games to none in the best
of-five Division Series, Oakland should
have folded. The clock was striking mid
night for Billy Beane, Bob Melvin and
the team with the lowest payroll in the
major leagues.
I mean come, on, seriously. Detroit has
the fifth highest payroll at $132,000,000
and Oaktown is more along the lines of
$55,000,000. The A's scratched and
clawed their way to a well-earned win in
Game 3. Congratulations, little guys!
What an accomplishment; now it's time
for bed. That's basically what Detroit
manager Jim Leyland said after the
game.
Because last night, Leyland was sup
posed to be right and the series was sup
posed to be over. Max Scherzer was on
the hill for the Tigers and he was dealing.
Seven of the first 15 batters struck out,
and just one base runner reached base in
the first four innings. Take a hint,
Oakland, it's over.
When Prince Fielder mashed a ball
way up into the right-field bleachers for a
2-0 lead, it was over.
When the A's actually got to Scherzer
in the sixth inning because Prince Fielder
did what Prince Fielder does and badly
misplayed a hard groundball to first base
that turned into a two-base error, it was
still over because Stephen Drew ran
straight into a rally-killing putout at third
base.
The Tigers' bullpen is lights-out, and
they were lights-out again. Octavio
Dotel, Phil Coke and A1 Alburquerque
were perfect, and Joaquin Benoit struck
out Brandon Moss to give the ball to Jose
Valverde, the dude who blew exactly
zero saves last season and saved 49, with
a 3-1 lead in the ninth inning. Game.
