## Drinking that green Kool-Aid 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Wow. Just, wow. I don't
pretend to have seen
it all, especially since
I know that when it
comes to the ever
overflowing fountain that is the wide
world of sports, something incredible and
new and exciting is just around the cor
ner. There were like a million no-hitters
this year and a perfect game for a fran
chise that hadn't seen one in some 50
years.
But man, I didn't see this coming.
Oakland, keep drinking that Kool-Aid,
because it is working some magic.
If you didn't see it, stop reading this
and go watch what the A's did to the
Detroit Tigers at O.Co. Coliseum last
night. It was basically the opposite of the
greatest love story ever told.
Down two games to none in the best
of-five Division Series, Oakland should
have folded. The clock was striking mid
night for Billy Beane, Bob Melvin and
the team with the lowest payroll in the
major leagues.
I mean come, on, seriously. Detroit has
the fifth highest payroll at $132,000,000
and Oaktown is more along the lines of
$55,000,000. The A's scratched and
clawed their way to a well-earned win in
Game 3. Congratulations, little guys!
What an accomplishment; now it's time
for bed. That's basically what Detroit
manager Jim Leyland said after the
game.
Because last night, Leyland was sup
posed to be right and the series was sup
posed to be over. Max Scherzer was on
the hill for the Tigers and he was dealing.
Seven of the first 15 batters struck out,
and just one base runner reached base in
the first four innings. Take a hint,
Oakland, it's over.
When Prince Fielder mashed a ball
way up into the right-field bleachers for a
2-0 lead, it was over.
When the A's actually got to Scherzer
in the sixth inning because Prince Fielder
did what Prince Fielder does and badly
misplayed a hard groundball to first base
that turned into a two-base error, it was
still over because Stephen Drew ran
straight into a rally-killing putout at third
base.
The Tigers' bullpen is lights-out, and
they were lights-out again. Octavio
Dotel, Phil Coke and A1 Alburquerque
were perfect, and Joaquin Benoit struck
out Brandon Moss to give the ball to Jose
Valverde, the dude who blew exactly
zero saves last season and saved 49, with
a 3-1 lead in the ninth inning. Game.
Over.
Aren't sports great?
When I go to a concert and watch
Itzhak Perlman play the violin, I know
what he will play, I know when he will
play it and I know he won't mess up.
These things I know.
When I go into a big test, I don't know
what will be on it, I don't know how to do
the problems, but I do know that I will
fail. These things I also know.
But when I watch the bottom of the
ninth from a rocking concrete slab in
Alameda, I have no idea what is going to
happen.
I guess there really was no other log
ical way for things to play out.
