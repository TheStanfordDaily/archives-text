## Health care act to increase cost, expand coverage at Stanford 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) contin
ues to be a contentious issue in the run-up to the
2012 election, the legislation's eventual impact on
the Stanford community could present a trade-off
between expanded coverage and higher premium
costs, according to University health administrators.
Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health
Center, said that for Stanford students enrolled
in Cardinal Care, the principal benefits of the
Affordable Care Act, popularly known as
"Obamacare," are the expansion of free preven
tive care such as some immunizations and
contraceptives, which currently require a $2O co
payment fee and the removal of a $5 million
lifetime limit on services received from outside
health care providers.

Friedman acknowledged, however, that the
broader pool of applicants insurance companies
are now legally required to service might result
in higher costs per customer and a subsequent
rise in Cardinal Care premiums. As Cardinal
Care spends more than 80 percent of premiums
received on health services, enrolled students
will receive no benefit from the ACA's provision,
which grants rebates to insurers spending below
that threshold.

Friedman also noted that despite the ACA's
provision allowing young adults to remain on
their parents' family policy —an attempt to
bridge the gap in coverage for recent college
graduates seeking employment the clause has
yet to impact Cardinal Care's enrollment among
students.

"To date Cardinal Care enrollment has
remained stable, without a major shift of stu

dents to parents' employer health coverage,"
Friedman wrote.
At this time, around 30 percent of undergrad
uates and 75 percent of graduate students have
Cardinal Care.
Campus political groups differed in their
opinion of the law's impact on both the Stanford
community and the nation as a whole.
"The ability to stay on parents' health care
until the age of 26 ... gives us flexibility in the
next few years," said Lindsay Lamont 'l3, presi
dent of the Stanford Democrats. "Another big
issue that is often overlooked is access to preven
tive care, as well as birth control without co-pays,
[which] is huge Obamacare will be a major
asset for our generation."

disagree.
"Obamacare, especially for young
people, is going to be a huge burden
tax-wise, and I think college students
recognize that," said Kenneth Capps
'l3, a Stanford Conservative Society
officer. "Young people buying health
insurance is often a different scenario
than it is for people with previous
conditions or older people."

"I applaud the expanded cover
age," Friedman wrote in an email to
The Daily. "But I expect it to cost
more beginning next year after the
insurance company reviews this
year's total claims experience. I'm still
concerned about the squeeze on stu
dents' tight budgets."
