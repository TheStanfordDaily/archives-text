## SEEING GREEN The 						golden goose egg 
### Holly Moeller 
I've been meaning to write a column
on steady-state economics for some
time. Last year, I even did some pre
liminary research before getting caught
up in topical current events instead.
Then, last week, I returned to my
Internet perusal, again typing in my
search phrase: "zero-growth economy."
To my consternation, the results had
changed dramatically. While the radi
cally different economic philosophy I
was after still topped the list, many of
the recent hits came from news articles
reporting on the dire economic straits
of Europe, the United States and even
China.

Then, as I glanced through the arti
cles, absorbing the negative tone and
fearful outlook, I realized how perfect
ly they highlighted the contrast
between our present-day economic
model and a zero-growth one.
In this country indeed, globally
the economic motto is, "Grow, grow,
grow!" Unemployment on the rise?
Grow businesses to add more jobs.
Bank accounts dry? Grow sales to fill
the coffers. Investments stagnating?
Grow your portfolio until the zeros dis
appear.

To some extent, economic growth is
necessary, particularly because the
human population is still expanding.
Basic human needs for food and shel
ter plus some extra for the luxury of
financial security must be met, so
economies must expand accordingly.
But beyond a certain point, happiness
no longer scales with income.
Where is that point? In the United
States, a 2010 study by Princeton scien
tists Daniel Kahneman and Angus
Deaton placed it at the (admittedly
high) household income level of
$75,000. While people who earned
more than that did claim to be more
satisfied with their lives, their happi
ness and emotional well-being didn't
improve with the extra income.
Despite this intrinsic limit to how
good tangible things can make us feel,
we've pinned ourselves commercially
and socially to an economic model that
relies on growth. We tell ourselves
through advertisements, "keeping up
with the Joneses" and our definition of
"success" that the goal is to have
more money and more things. And the
only way to support this growing
demand is to grow the economy.
Unfortunately, economies simply
cannot grow forever. Influential econo
mists from Adam Smith to John
Maynard Keynes acknowledged fun
damental limits to growth imposed by
natural resources.There's only so much
coal to fire the power plant, only so
much lithium for hybrid car batteries.
And we have plenty of evidence
Easter Island, the Mayan Empire and
so on of societies who exceeded the
natural limits to their growth and then
collapsed.
Of course, many have argued that
knowledge-based economies, which
exchange thoughts and ideas for
money, can decouple economic growth
from resource limitations. Likewise,
increased technological efficiency can
allow the same raw materials to stretch

further. Still, it seems impossible to
imagine any real economy that could
grow infinitely in any meaningful way
though it's easy to envision runaway
inflation driving up dollar values.
Meanwhile, even in our current
global economic state which
includes 1.2 billion people experienc
ing extreme poverty as they survive on
less than $1.25 per day and billions of
citizens in growing economies dream
ing of living a resource-demanding
American lifestyle we've already
exceeded the natural limits of our plan
et.
We're moving rapidly past the
atmospheric checkpoints that scientists
have earmarked as climate-change
turning points. We support most of our
economic machinery on nonrenewable
fossil fuels. The ecological footprint
analysis of Wackernagel and Rees
which tallies up the physical footprint
of all our impacts, from water use to
food production to carbon sequestra
tion calculated that we already use
the equivalent of 1.5 Earths.
At what point will we realize that
we have an obligation to ourselves, to
live not as mindless consumers but
rather by striving for balance by seek
ing fulfillment in a myriad of other
ways? In this country, we continue to
rank our families, our friendships and
our mental and spiritual well-being
highly —at least in principle. Let's
allow our economic system to reflect
those values by putting moneymaking
in its rightful place.
We need to redefine our economic
system as seeking a sustainable steady
state. In this time of increasing aware
ness of resource limitations, and of the
consequences of human activity (e.g.,
climate change and species extinction),
we have a unique opportunity to
embrace zero growth and the idea of
having "enough." It's time to see that
goose egg at the bottom of the balance
sheet not as a mark of economic fail
ure, but rather as a sign of social
growth.

Unfortunately,
economies simply
cannot grow
forever.

I've been meaning to write a column
on steady-state economics for some
time. Last year, I even did some pre
liminary research before getting caught
up in topical current events instead.
Then, last week, I returned to my
Internet perusal, again typing in my
search phrase: "zero-growth economy."
To my consternation, the results had
changed dramatically. While the radi
cally different economic philosophy I
was after still topped the list, many of
the recent hits came from news articles
reporting on the dire economic straits
of Europe, the United States and even
China.

Then, as I glanced through the arti
cles, absorbing the negative tone and
fearful outlook, I realized how perfect
ly they highlighted the contrast
between our present-day economic
model and a zero-growth one.
In this country indeed, globally
the economic motto is, "Grow, grow,
grow!" Unemployment on the rise?
Grow businesses to add more jobs.
Bank accounts dry? Grow sales to fill
the coffers. Investments stagnating?
Grow your portfolio until the zeros dis
appear.

To some extent, economic growth is
necessary, particularly because the
human population is still expanding.
Basic human needs for food and shel
ter plus some extra for the luxury of
financial security must be met, so
economies must expand accordingly.
But beyond a certain point, happiness
no longer scales with income.
Where is that point? In the United
States, a 2010 study by Princeton scien
tists Daniel Kahneman and Angus
Deaton placed it at the (admittedly
high) household income level of
$75,000. While people who earned
more than that did claim to be more
satisfied with their lives, their happi
ness and emotional well-being didn't
improve with the extra income.
Despite this intrinsic limit to how
good tangible things can make us feel,
we've pinned ourselves commercially
and socially to an economic model that
relies on growth. We tell ourselves
through advertisements, "keeping up
with the Joneses" and our definition of
"success" that the goal is to have
more money and more things. And the
only way to support this growing
demand is to grow the economy.
Unfortunately, economies simply
cannot grow forever. Influential econo
mists from Adam Smith to John
Maynard Keynes acknowledged fun
damental limits to growth imposed by
natural resources.There's only so much
coal to fire the power plant, only so
much lithium for hybrid car batteries.
And we have plenty of evidence
Easter Island, the Mayan Empire and
so on of societies who exceeded the
natural limits to their growth and then
collapsed.
Of course, many have argued that
knowledge-based economies, which
exchange thoughts and ideas for
money, can decouple economic growth
from resource limitations. Likewise,
increased technological efficiency can
allow the same raw materials to stretch

further. Still, it seems impossible to
imagine any real economy that could
grow infinitely in any meaningful way
though it's easy to envision runaway
inflation driving up dollar values.
Meanwhile, even in our current
global economic state which
includes 1.2 billion people experienc
ing extreme poverty as they survive on
