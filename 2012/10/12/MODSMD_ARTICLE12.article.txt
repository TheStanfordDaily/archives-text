# CAMPUS LIFE
## Mailing list locates free food on campus 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
There are over 9,000
public mailing lists at
Stanford but only
one tells you where to
get free food.
For the 463 members who are
subscribed to the free-food-alert
mailing list, the process is simple.
Every email is formatted to get
straight to the main course; the
subject line is [location]:[short
description of food]. For those that
are hesitant to join yet another
mailing list, free-food-alert also has
an associated blog that records all
posts from the list for members
who want free food without the
extra email.
"I would say there are two or
three alerts per week," said
Melissa Ch'ng M.D. 'l4, who has
been a moderator of the list for
about 10 months. "There tend to be
more events at the beginning of
the school year when the different
organizations are getting people
together, and then it gets much
quieter during the summer."
Ysis Tarter 'l5 initially thought
the free food list was a myth. As a
member of the gates-food mailing
list, which announces free food
availability in the Gates building,

Tarter decided free-food-alert was
worth Googling and subsequently
stumbled upon the blog.
"I joined because I live in
Mirrielees and hate food shopping.
I was never big on dining hall food
even when I had a meal plan, so it
made sense," Tarter said. "Also,
even though I have a kitchen to
cook for myself, I still can't make
pizza or burritos as quickly as I can
pick one up for free."
From events as unusual as the
annual Lyman pig roast to barbe
cues in Rains, the free food seems
like a sweet deal, but Ch'ng points
out that publicizing events solely
based on the available free food
might seem opportunistic and
offensive.
"I try to only publicize events
that look like they are meant for a
broader audience," Ch'ng said.
The list is dependent on its
members' contributions to thrive.
Those on the list are encouraged to
help out the other free food seek
ers as much as possible. Just as the
mailing list's information page
states, "Without each other, you
and I would starve ! (Or at least we
would have to resort to not-so-free
food. And I would rather starve.)"
