# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Nice not talking to you 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
It's easy at a place like Stanford to
fall into the habit of having safe,
redundant conversations every
time you run into someone. You are
all familiar with the following con
struction.
A: (hyperbolically) Hey! It's so good
to see you! How was your summer?
B: It was great! I restored the natural
habitat of endangered tree frogs in
South America.
A: That's awesome! (non sequitur to
let B know she is NOT single) My
boyfriend loves tree frogs.
B: (confused) Oh! Cool.
(Glimmer of an imminent pause. Oh
God, oh no. Not silence.)
B: So what are you taking this quarter?
A: 5F224, CAIO9B, and QW&CI22.
B: (to self: What the hell does QW&C
stand for?) That sounds like a heavy
10ad...
You know where this is going.
Nowhere. And it happens so quickly
it sounds like the side-effect warnings
in a Zoloft commercial. It's true that
Stanford students are often running
off to their 1:15 section, and five min

utes isn't enough to get past the fluff
in a conversation. Still, there is a pal
pable pressure on campus to look
sunny, busy and successful that stands
in the way of the meatier, scarier parts
of conversation. That pressure might
be responsible for the pouts you see
instead of smiles, the self-important
strut that replaces a casual stroll.
Maybe if we just let that awkward
pause happen, it would unlock the
door to the real stuff.

Then again, maybe the real stuff is
hiding in plain sight, encrypted in the
small talk. Just to experiment, here is a
more hopeful take on what is actually
being said in the conversation above.
A: Wow. You're invading the space
time continuum by being here. I com
partmentalized you in my Freshman
Year Experience, Way to throw me
for a loop.

B: Seeing you makes me feel really
average since I know via Facebook
that you're double majoring in
Physics and IR. Is it enough that I
spent my summer restoring the natu
ral habitat of endangered tree frogs in

South America?
A: Just to be clear, I'm seeing some
one. Glad we're on the same page.
B: I'm actually just trying to be friend
ly, but I guess I'm glad we're clear on
that too.
(Glimmer of an imminent pause. Oh
God, oh no. Not silence.)
B: Anyway, how are you doing?
A: Are you sincerely asking, or just
being polite?
B: I'm sincerely asking. I want to get
to know you...
I like to think this is what actually
goes on in the small-talk do-si-do.
There is something generous in tak
ing even five minutes to exchange
niceties, even if they are unsubstantial
in nature.
So if I ask you for the fifth time
what classes you are taking this quar
ter, know that what I'm really saying
is, I'm curious and I want to get to
know you, I just don't have the words
to say it outright.
