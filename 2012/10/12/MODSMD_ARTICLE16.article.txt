## Plenty of fight left in the Irish 
### Sam Fisher 
The first five games of
Stanford's season have
been a miraculously windy
road. We've seen pretty
much every type of game,
and though Stanford could easily be 1-
4, the team has survived three of four
close games to keep the season alive.
Technically, this week's result at
Notre Dame does not affect Stanford's
goal of a Pac-12 championship, but it
does have tremendous implications for
potential bowl placement. As every
thing stands right now, Stanford still has
a chance to get an at-large berth in the
Rose Bowl with a loss at Oregon, if
Oregon goes to the national champi
onship game. If Stanford loses another
game besides the one at Oregon
though, those hopes will be all but
dashed.
The toughest test remaining on that
list is Saturday at undefeated No. 7
Notre Dame. Unlike last week's oppo
nent, Arizona, for which I went away
from my usual matchup format, Notre
Dame certainly has the talent to war
rant an in-depth column. The Irish are
effectively Stanford's twin brother on
the field. Both teams have a vaunted
front seven, questions in the secondary,
great running games and inconsistent
quarterback play. Here are the
matchups that will determine the win
ner in this closely matched rivalry
game.
Stanford's running game vs. Notre
Dame's big defensive line
Stanford's offense revolves around
being able to run the football, and
specifically power running efficiently.
Notre Dame's defensive line presents
by far the biggest challenge of the sea
son for this running attack. Most of the
defensive lines Stanford has seen so far
have defensive ends that weigh around
250 to 275 pounds.
All three of Notre Dame's defen
sive linemen weigh at least 300 pounds,
averaging 312 pounds apiece. They're
not just big; they're athletic and very
talented football players with 43 starts
between them. For Stanford to have a
chance on offense in this game, the
offensive line must be able to block
these three linemen, leaving either a
pulling guard or a fullback to try to
take on star inside linebacker Manti
Te'o.
Notre Dame inside linebacker Manti
Te'o vs. Stanford's entire offense
Speaking of Te'o, you can't put the
burden of limiting one of the best
defenders in the entire country on just
one Stanford player. Every single play
er on the field must be aware of where
Te'o is at all times, or he will make
Stanford pay. Te'o leads Notre Dame in
tackles by 20, so containing Te'o goes a
long way toward moving the ball
against the Irish. He's big, he hits hard
and he flows to the football with
tremendous instincts. In other words,
he's pretty much a carbon copy of
Shayne Skov at the end of 2010. Te'o is
just as capable of taking over a game, so
beware.
Notre Dame's running backs vs.
Stanford's perimeter defense
Moving to the other side of the ball,
Notre Dame has some offensive
weapons to keep Stanford up all night,
and it all starts with the running backs.
Converted slot receiver Theo Riddick
leads the way.
Though only averaging a bit less
than four yards per carry, Riddick pro
vides another threat out of the back
field, leading his team in receptions.
Riddick is quick, a shifty back who will
make the first defender miss more
often than not, so gang-tackling is a
must. The other two backs, George
Atkinson, who is averaging 9.3 yards
per carry, and Cierre Wood, are stupid
fast, making good pursuit angles vital.
Atkinson's 10.36100-meter dash at the
Big East Championships was the sec
ond fastest time in Notre Dame track
history, so don't let him get to the
perimeter if you want to keep the game
close.
Stanford's pass rash vs. Everett
Golson's elusiveness
Golson presents a very similar
problem to Washington's Keith Price
with his mobility. Fortunately for the
Card, who actually contained Price
very well, Golson has not shown the
same passing ability as Price over his
young career thus far. Still, Stanford
must be diligent staying in its lanes
when pass-rushing Golson, or he will
take off up the field to avoid pressure
and pick up big yardage. Stanford
stopped Keith Price with consistent
pressure and big hits, and more of the
same needs to come in South Bend for
Stanford to have a chance.
Josh Nunes vs. Everett Golson
It's not a traditional matchup, as the
two quarterbacks will not match up
against each other all game, unless one
of the coaches has a huge trick up his
sleeve. However, in a game of such
evenly matched teams, the quarter
back who comes up bigger will almost
certainly win this game. Both quarter
backs will get knocked down and
both will probably make mistakes, but
someone is going to need to lead his
team on a drive to pick up a season
changing victory. The only question is,
which will it be...

Sam Fisher is arriving in South
Bend as we speak, having meticu
lously planned out his one chance
to live out his dream and be the
next Rudy Ruettiger. To suggest
how he can convince Brian Kelly
or David Shaw to let him suit up
on Saturday, email him at safish

against each other all game, unless one
of the coaches has a huge trick up his
sleeve. However, in a game of such
evenly matched teams, the quarter
back who comes up bigger will almost
certainly win this game. Both quarter
backs will get knocked down and
both will probably make mistakes, but
someone is going to need to lead his
team on a drive to pick up a season
changing victory. The only question is,
which will it be...

The first five games of
Stanford's season have
been a miraculously windy
road. We've seen pretty
much every type of game,
and though Stanford could easily be 1-
4, the team has survived three of four
close games to keep the season alive.
Technically, this week's result at
Notre Dame does not affect Stanford's
goal of a Pac-12 championship, but it
does have tremendous implications for
potential bowl placement. As every
thing stands right now, Stanford still has
a chance to get an at-large berth in the
Rose Bowl with a loss at Oregon, if
Oregon goes to the national champi
onship game. If Stanford loses another
game besides the one at Oregon
though, those hopes will be all but
dashed.
The toughest test remaining on that
list is Saturday at undefeated No. 7
Notre Dame. Unlike last week's oppo
nent, Arizona, for which I went away
from my usual matchup format, Notre
Dame certainly has the talent to war
rant an in-depth column. The Irish are
effectively Stanford's twin brother on
the field. Both teams have a vaunted
front seven, questions in the secondary,
great running games and inconsistent
quarterback play. Here are the
matchups that will determine the win
ner in this closely matched rivalry
game.
Stanford's running game vs. Notre
Dame's big defensive line
Stanford's offense revolves around
being able to run the football, and
specifically power running efficiently.
Notre Dame's defensive line presents
by far the biggest challenge of the sea
son for this running attack. Most of the
defensive lines Stanford has seen so far
have defensive ends that weigh around
250 to 275 pounds.
All three of Notre Dame's defen
sive linemen weigh at least 300 pounds,
averaging 312 pounds apiece. They're
not just big; they're athletic and very
talented football players with 43 starts
between them. For Stanford to have a
chance on offense in this game, the
offensive line must be able to block
these three linemen, leaving either a
pulling guard or a fullback to try to
take on star inside linebacker Manti
Te'o.
Notre Dame inside linebacker Manti
Te'o vs. Stanford's entire offense
Speaking of Te'o, you can't put the
burden of limiting one of the best
defenders in the entire country on just
one Stanford player. Every single play
er on the field must be aware of where
Te'o is at all times, or he will make
Stanford pay. Te'o leads Notre Dame in
tackles by 20, so containing Te'o goes a
long way toward moving the ball
against the Irish. He's big, he hits hard
and he flows to the football with
tremendous instincts. In other words,
he's pretty much a carbon copy of
Shayne Skov at the end of 2010. Te'o is
just as capable of taking over a game, so
beware.
Notre Dame's running backs vs.
Stanford's perimeter defense
Moving to the other side of the ball,
Notre Dame has some offensive
weapons to keep Stanford up all night,
and it all starts with the running backs.
Converted slot receiver Theo Riddick
leads the way.
Though only averaging a bit less
than four yards per carry, Riddick pro
vides another threat out of the back
field, leading his team in receptions.
Riddick is quick, a shifty back who will
make the first defender miss more
often than not, so gang-tackling is a
must. The other two backs, George
Atkinson, who is averaging 9.3 yards
per carry, and Cierre Wood, are stupid
fast, making good pursuit angles vital.
Atkinson's 10.36100-meter dash at the
Big East Championships was the sec
ond fastest time in Notre Dame track
history, so don't let him get to the
perimeter if you want to keep the game
close.
Stanford's pass rash vs. Everett
Golson's elusiveness
Golson presents a very similar
problem to Washington's Keith Price
with his mobility. Fortunately for the
Card, who actually contained Price
very well, Golson has not shown the
same passing ability as Price over his
young career thus far. Still, Stanford
must be diligent staying in its lanes
when pass-rushing Golson, or he will
take off up the field to avoid pressure
and pick up big yardage. Stanford
stopped Keith Price with consistent
pressure and big hits, and more of the
same needs to come in South Bend for
Stanford to have a chance.
