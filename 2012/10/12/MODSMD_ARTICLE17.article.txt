# CATS DECLAWED
## CARD DOMINATES IN ROAD WIN 
### JANA PERSKY 
Ahead of this weekend's football game,
Stanford beat out Notre Dame in another sport
ing competition. With a 4-1 win over the Arizona
Wildcats on Thursday, the Stanford women's soc
cer team moved into third place on the NCAA
Division I list for consecutive conference victories,
breaking a tie with the Fighting Irish. The
Cardinal has now won its past 37 games within the
Pac-12, a streak dating back to Oct. 31,2008.
Sophomore forward Chioma Übogagu started
off the scoring with a perfectly placed shot from
20 yards out in the 19th minute. After a turnover
in Arizona's defense, Übogagu turned her defend
er nicely and created just enough space to squeeze
off a shot that bent into the upper right-hand cor
ner of the net.

The score would stay the same through half
time despite fast-paced action from both teams.
Despite the Cardinal dominating possession as
the Wildcats dropped back to defend often
keeping nine or 10 players behind the ball until
Stanford's defenders pressed 15 yards over the
half line the shot total was a rather respectable
10-6 in favor of the Cardinal.

The second half started off at the same speed
but with almost immediately better results for the
Cardinal. Three minutes into the half, sophomore
Lo'eau Laßonta, starting at forward for the first
time, received a pass from freshman defender
Laura Liedle at the top of the penalty box and
rocketed a shot past Arizona goalkeeper Gabby
Kaufman. In the 55th minute, sophomore forward
Alex Doll beat an Arizona defender with a quick
move and placed the ball perfectly to extend the
lead to 3-0 Übogagu assisted on the play.
Stanford scored its fourth and final goal in the
game in the 65th minute. Senior captain Alina
Garciamendez got on the end of a Laßonta cor
ner kick and headed it into the upper left corner
for an easy score, the defender's fifth goal of the
season.
After the fourth goal, coach Paul Ratcliffe
began substituting almost his entire starting line
up. At that point, Stanford's passing became slop
pier and Arizona began to seize more of the pos
session. Eight players came off the bench and
played more than 19 minutes.
In the 74th minute, Arizona forward Candi
Osei-Agyemang picked off a poorly-timed pass by
the Stanford defense and finished the ensuing

breakaway past goalkeeper Aly Gleason, who
replaced starter Emily Oliver in the 66th minute.
Arizona put the ball in the net one more time with
just over three minutes to play, but the goal was
disallowed because of a close offside call.
Potentially concerning was the absence of sen
ior captain and outside back Rachel Quon in the
second half. After playing all 45 minutes before
the halftime whistle, Quon did not factor in the

second period despite not appearing to labor in
her time playing earlier in the night.
Quon and the Cardinal have a week off before
their next games, the final regular-season home
matches of the season, which will be next
Thursday and Sunday against Washington State
and Washington at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
