# Stanford needs road results

No. 5 Stanford visits division rivals UC-Santa
Barbara and Pepperdine this weekend in what is
already a pivotal set of games only a week into the
regular season. At 6-3 overall and 0-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF), a

Cardinal loss to either team could be enough to
end their postseason hopes unceremoniously and
very early.
The stakes are high most seasons for the men's
water polo team. Only four teams make it to the
NCAA tournament, and three of those spots are
given to the champions of conference tourna
ments. That means the remaining contenders are

vying for only one at-large bid, and a bad loss can
cripple the season.
The significance of this weekend comes from
the fact that No. 2 UC-Santa Barbara (14-3, 0-0)
has thrown its hat into that pool of top contenders.
Usually a good, but not elite, team, the Gauchos
leapt into the standings after a second-place finish
at the SoCal Tournament. Behind support from
their home fans, along with a little home-field
advantage due to abnormalities in their pool,
UCSB beat giants UCLA and Stanford before
losing to undefeated USC.
"It was tough playing in their pool because
there is a shallow end and a deep end," said senior
driver Alex Avery after the loss in the SoCal
Tournament. "But we have had a chance to get
used to it, and it shouldn't be an issue next time we
play there."
Stanford's first and only MPSF game thus far
was a 9-6 drubbing by No. 1 USC. That loss direct
ly followed the Cardinal's fifth-place finish at the
SoCal Tournament, where it lost to UCSB. Most
teams' national rankings to this point, including
UCSB and Stanford's, reflect their finish at that
tournament. The Cardinal is hoping to prove that
the rankings don't reflect actual talent, but rather
a small sample size.
"The rankings don't mean much right now,"
Avery said. "As the season goes on they will sort
themselves out."
To get back on track this weekend, Stanford
will have to limit its exclusions. In the 12-9 loss to
UCSB, four starters were majored expelled
from the game for their third exclusion penalty
which led to a disastrous fourth quarter.
"We need to force their shooters to beat us
from the outside so we don't get ejections late in
the shot clock at the set," said junior goalie Scott
Platshon.
Those shooters will likely be Matt Gronow (37
goals) and Evan Dellinger (34), who lead the
Guachos in goals. If Stanford's attack can get past
UCSB goalie Miles Christian third in the
MPSF at 11.45 saves per game it will be critical
for two-meter players Andrew LaForge and
Conner Cleary to fill the gap and give Platshon a
chance in goal.
Regardless of what happens against UCSB,
Stanford will not be able to afford letting off the
gas against Pepperdine on Sunday. While the No.
8 Waves (7-5, 0-0) are not considered a threat in
the MPSF and have already lost to the Cardinal
this year at the SoCal Tournament, Stephen
Loomis and Matthew DeTrane have picked it up
on the offensive end and led the team to two con
secutive wins last weekend.
The match against the Gauchos is set to begin
Saturday at noon, with the tip against the Waves
slated for Sunday at 1 p.m. from Malibu.
