# EYES ON THE IRISH

### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
As the Cardinal approach
es the midpoint of its sea
son, it's worthwhile to
look back on some of the
things that the team has
accomplished so far.
Knocking off the No. 2 team in the
country. Shutting down a quarterback
who in all likelihood will be the first
overall pick in this year's NFL Draft.
Coming back from a two-touchdown
deficit halfway through the fourth
quarter. Amassing 617 yards of total
offense in a single game.
All of which are undoubtedly
impressive.
But there is still one thing that has
managed to elude the Cardinal: win
ning a game on the road.
Coming off a thrilling 54-48 over
time victory over Arizona last week,
No. 17 Stanford (4-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will
try to claim its first road victory when
it squares off against No. 7 Notre
Dame (5-0) in South Bend, Ind.,
tomorrow afternoon.
"This is going to be the big test,"
said head coach David Shaw. "That's
our gauntlet. The gauntlet that's
thrown down in front of us is, can we
play our best game on the road?"
The Cardinal has laid its hands on
the Legends Trophy, annually given to
the winner of the rivalry game, for the
past three years. However, bringing the
trophy back to the Farm for the fourth
straight season will be a tall order con
sidering that this will be the highest
ranked Notre Dame team that
Stanford has faced since 1992, when

the Fighting Irish went into that
matchup as the No. 6 team in the
nation.
South Bend has not been particu
larly kind to Stanford, as it has gone 3-
10 at Notre Dame Stadium. And with
ESPN's College Game Day crew
attending tomorrow's game, the
Cardinal will face a hostile crowd
under the eyes of national viewers as it
did against Washington at
Century Link Field two weeks ago.
"We've gone on the road one time
this year, and we did not play well,"
Shaw said. "Defensively, we did a solid
job against Washington, but we still
allowed a 100-yard rusher and a 100-
yard receiver. We've done that two
games in a row. We need our defense
to play its best game this week."
An important task for Stanford's
defense is to limit the effectiveness of
Notre Dame quarterback Everett
Golson, a redshirt freshman who, like
Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes, is
coming off the best game of his rookie
career. Despite not tossing any touch
downs against Miami last Saturday,
Golson displayed his efficiency by
completing over 77 percent of his pass
es, as well as gaining 51 yards on the
ground.
Though inconsistent at times,
Golson has thus far led the Irish to a
perfect 5-0 record for the first time
since 2002. Not all of those wins have
come against subpar teams, either;
among them is an impressive 20-3 win
over then-No. 10 Michigan State and a
13-6 grind-it-out victory over then-No.
18 Michigan.

Both Stanford and Notre Dame have physical, fast defenses. It will be up to redshirt junior Trent Murphy (93)
and the Cardinal pass rush to pressure Notre Dame's quarterback and keep Stanford close on the road.
