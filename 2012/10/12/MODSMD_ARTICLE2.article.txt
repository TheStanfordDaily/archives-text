# EYES ON THE IRISH
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
As the Cardinal approach
es the midpoint of its sea
son, it's worthwhile to
look back on some of the
things that the team has
accomplished so far.
Knocking off the No. 2 team in the
country. Shutting down a quarterback
who in all likelihood will be the first
overall pick in this year's NFL Draft.
Coming back from a two-touchdown
deficit halfway through the fourth
quarter. Amassing 617 yards of total
offense in a single game.
All of which are undoubtedly
impressive.
But there is still one thing that has
managed to elude the Cardinal: win
ning a game on the road.
Coming off a thrilling 54-48 over
time victory over Arizona last week,
No. 17 Stanford (4-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will
try to claim its first road victory when
it squares off against No. 7 Notre
Dame (5-0) in South Bend, Ind.,
tomorrow afternoon.
"This is going to be the big test,"
said head coach David Shaw. "That's
our gauntlet. The gauntlet that's
thrown down in front of us is, can we
play our best game on the road?"
The Cardinal has laid its hands on
the Legends Trophy, annually given to
the winner of the rivalry game, for the
past three years. However, bringing the
trophy back to the Farm for the fourth
straight season will be a tall order con
sidering that this will be the highest
ranked Notre Dame team that
Stanford has faced since 1992, when

the Fighting Irish went into that
matchup as the No. 6 team in the
nation.
South Bend has not been particu
larly kind to Stanford, as it has gone 3-
10 at Notre Dame Stadium. And with
ESPN's College Game Day crew
attending tomorrow's game, the
Cardinal will face a hostile crowd
under the eyes of national viewers as it
did against Washington at
Century Link Field two weeks ago.
"We've gone on the road one time
this year, and we did not play well,"
Shaw said. "Defensively, we did a solid
job against Washington, but we still
allowed a 100-yard rusher and a 100-
yard receiver. We've done that two
games in a row. We need our defense
to play its best game this week."
An important task for Stanford's
defense is to limit the effectiveness of
Notre Dame quarterback Everett
Golson, a redshirt freshman who, like
Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes, is
coming off the best game of his rookie
career. Despite not tossing any touch
downs against Miami last Saturday,
Golson displayed his efficiency by
completing over 77 percent of his pass
es, as well as gaining 51 yards on the
ground.
Though inconsistent at times,
Golson has thus far led the Irish to a
perfect 5-0 record for the first time
since 2002. Not all of those wins have
come against subpar teams, either;
among them is an impressive 20-3 win
over then-No. 10 Michigan State and a
13-6 grind-it-out victory over then-No.
18 Michigan.

Both Stanford and Notre Dame have physical, fast defenses. It will be up to redshirt junior Trent Murphy (93)
and the Cardinal pass rush to pressure Notre Dame's quarterback and keep Stanford close on the road.
Shaw has also made sure that his
defenders are prepared for backup
quarterback Tommy Rees should he
get into the game. While head coach
Brian Kelley has made it clear that
Golson is the starter, Rees has seen
some playing time this year, including
11 pass attempts against the
Wolverines.
The Stanford secondary, which
gave up huge plays over the top that
led to Arizona's 491 passing yards last
weekend, will need to clamp down
against Golson. Although the
Cardinal defenders in the second level
have shown that they can be playmak
ers safety Ed Reynolds leads the
nation with 144 interception return
yards and rise to the occasion,
inconsistent coverage and shoddy
tackling have been two of the bigger
issues so far this season.
The Irish also boast a horde of tal
ented running backs, including Theo
Riddick, George Atkinson 111 and
Cierre Wood, who have been splitting
responsibilities in the backfield and
averaging over 187 rushing yards per
game. On the heels of allowing 100-
yard rushers in its last two games, the
Cardinal front seven will face a pow
erful offensive line that has made
great strides in its run blocking and
pass protection.
"[Their offensive line] is much
more downhill and much more physi
cal than they were a season ago," said
defensive end Ben Gardner. "They
look a lot like our own offensive line.
They're big bodies, but they're well
put together. We're looking forward to
that challenge because that's our style
of football at Stanford, and that's what
we signed up for when we came to
play here."
Nunes' five-touchdown perform
ance against Arizona was the big story
last weekend, earning him Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
The redshirt junior not only ran the
ball into the end zone three times, but
also executed two touchdown-scoring
drives when there was absolutely no
room for mistakes.
"I just go out there with the men
tality that each play needs to be our
best play," Nunes said.
While taking nothing away from
his breakout game last Saturday,
Nunes will face a much stiffer test
against a stout Notre Dame defense
that has allowed less than eight points
per game, which is good for second in
the country.
"We have something in common
with Notre Dame," said Shaw. "And
that's playing tough, physical defense,
loving our linebackers, running the
ball on offense and having the quar
terbacks do what they need to do to
win the game."
The heart and soul of the Irish
defense is undoubtedly inside line
backer MantiTe'o. At 6-foot-2 and 255
pounds, the consensus preseason first
team Ail-American linebacker has
forced his way into the Heisman con
versation with 48 tackles, three inter
ceptions, two fumble recoveries and
two quarterback hurries that resulted
in interceptions.
"You get on guys about form tack
les and wrapping up," said Shaw. "But
when Manti hits people, he doesn't
have a chance to wrap them up half

the time. He pops them, and they go
down, he's so physical It's uncan
ny; he's a special player."
Although Te'o may overshadow
many of his teammates, Notre Dame
has plenty of other game-changing
players on defense. Among them is
junior cornerback Bennett Jackson,
who also has three interceptions on
the season. Opponents have struggled
to inflict much damage on the Irish
through the air Notre Dame has
given up only three passing touch
downs while tallying eight picks and
14 sacks.
With Stanford's top wide receiver
Ty Montgomery injured, Nunes will
have to find away to get his other
wideouts, like Drew Terrell and Jamal-
Rashad Patterson, more involved, in
addition to his favorite tight end tar
gets Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo.
The Irish run defense has also
been lights out all season, allowing
only 106 yards per game on the
ground. Senior tailback Stepfan
Taylor, who has been efficiently aver
aging 4.7 yards per carry, probably
won't have the big running holes he
was presented with against the
Wildcats last weekend.
But Stanford's offensive line isn't
backing down.
"We have big guys that can play
physical but also have great feet and
are able to go up to a safety if need
be," said redshirt junior guard Khalil
Wilkes.
The Stanford players respect the
firmly rooted traditions that surround
Notre Dame's football program, but
that doesn't mean that they're treating
this game any differently.
"I love playing them, and I love
going to Notre Dame Stadium
because it's a beautiful place to play,
the fans are into it and you've got the
little leprechaun running around,"
said Gardner. "But in terms of most of
our team, they could care less. We're
just about what we do, about playing
big, physical football."
The Cardinal and the Irish clash in
a top-20 showdown tomorrow at
Notre Dame Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PDT, with
national television coverage on NBC.

Nunes' five-touchdown perform
ance against Arizona was the big story
last weekend, earning him Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
The redshirt junior not only ran the
ball into the end zone three times, but
also executed two touchdown-scoring
drives when there was absolutely no
room for mistakes.
"I just go out there with the men
tality that each play needs to be our
best play," Nunes said.
While taking nothing away from
his breakout game last Saturday,
Nunes will face a much stiffer test
against a stout Notre Dame defense
that has allowed less than eight points
per game, which is good for second in
the country.
"We have something in common
with Notre Dame," said Shaw. "And
that's playing tough, physical defense,
loving our linebackers, running the
ball on offense and having the quar
terbacks do what they need to do to
win the game."
The heart and soul of the Irish
defense is undoubtedly inside line
backer MantiTe'o. At 6-foot-2 and 255
pounds, the consensus preseason first
team Ail-American linebacker has
forced his way into the Heisman con
versation with 48 tackles, three inter
ceptions, two fumble recoveries and
two quarterback hurries that resulted
in interceptions.
"You get on guys about form tack
les and wrapping up," said Shaw. "But
when Manti hits people, he doesn't
have a chance to wrap them up half

the time. He pops them, and they go
down, he's so physical It's uncan
ny; he's a special player."
Although Te'o may overshadow
many of his teammates, Notre Dame
has plenty of other game-changing
players on defense. Among them is
junior cornerback Bennett Jackson,
who also has three interceptions on
the season. Opponents have struggled
to inflict much damage on the Irish
through the air Notre Dame has
given up only three passing touch
downs while tallying eight picks and
14 sacks.
With Stanford's top wide receiver
Ty Montgomery injured, Nunes will
have to find away to get his other
wideouts, like Drew Terrell and Jamal-
Rashad Patterson, more involved, in
addition to his favorite tight end tar
gets Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo.
The Irish run defense has also
been lights out all season, allowing
only 106 yards per game on the
ground. Senior tailback Stepfan
Taylor, who has been efficiently aver
aging 4.7 yards per carry, probably
won't have the big running holes he
was presented with against the
Wildcats last weekend.
But Stanford's offensive line isn't
backing down.
"We have big guys that can play
physical but also have great feet and
are able to go up to a safety if need
be," said redshirt junior guard Khalil
Wilkes.
The Stanford players respect the
firmly rooted traditions that surround
Notre Dame's football program, but
that doesn't mean that they're treating
this game any differently.
"I love playing them, and I love
going to Notre Dame Stadium
because it's a beautiful place to play,
the fans are into it and you've got the
little leprechaun running around,"
said Gardner. "But in terms of most of
our team, they could care less. We're
just about what we do, about playing
big, physical football."
The Cardinal and the Irish clash in
a top-20 showdown tomorrow at
Notre Dame Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PDT, with
national television coverage on NBC.

Notre Dame linebacker Manti
Te'o will prove a stiff test for
Stanford senior running back
Stepfan Taylor (above), the
Cardinal's leading rusher with five
rushing touchdowns this year.
As the Cardinal approach
es the midpoint of its sea
son, it's worthwhile to
look back on some of the
things that the team has
accomplished so far.
Knocking off the No. 2 team in the
country. Shutting down a quarterback
who in all likelihood will be the first
overall pick in this year's NFL Draft.
Coming back from a two-touchdown
deficit halfway through the fourth
quarter. Amassing 617 yards of total
offense in a single game.
All of which are undoubtedly
impressive.
But there is still one thing that has
managed to elude the Cardinal: win
ning a game on the road.
Coming off a thrilling 54-48 over
time victory over Arizona last week,
No. 17 Stanford (4-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will
try to claim its first road victory when
it squares off against No. 7 Notre
Dame (5-0) in South Bend, Ind.,
tomorrow afternoon.
"This is going to be the big test,"
said head coach David Shaw. "That's
our gauntlet. The gauntlet that's
thrown down in front of us is, can we
play our best game on the road?"
The Cardinal has laid its hands on
the Legends Trophy, annually given to
the winner of the rivalry game, for the
past three years. However, bringing the
trophy back to the Farm for the fourth
straight season will be a tall order con
sidering that this will be the highest
ranked Notre Dame team that
Stanford has faced since 1992, when

the Fighting Irish went into that
matchup as the No. 6 team in the
nation.
South Bend has not been particu
larly kind to Stanford, as it has gone 3-
10 at Notre Dame Stadium. And with
ESPN's College Game Day crew
attending tomorrow's game, the
Cardinal will face a hostile crowd
under the eyes of national viewers as it
did against Washington at
Century Link Field two weeks ago.
"We've gone on the road one time
this year, and we did not play well,"
Shaw said. "Defensively, we did a solid
job against Washington, but we still
allowed a 100-yard rusher and a 100-
yard receiver. We've done that two
games in a row. We need our defense
to play its best game this week."
An important task for Stanford's
defense is to limit the effectiveness of
Notre Dame quarterback Everett
Golson, a redshirt freshman who, like
Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes, is
coming off the best game of his rookie
career. Despite not tossing any touch
downs against Miami last Saturday,
Golson displayed his efficiency by
completing over 77 percent of his pass
es, as well as gaining 51 yards on the
ground.
Though inconsistent at times,
Golson has thus far led the Irish to a
perfect 5-0 record for the first time
since 2002. Not all of those wins have
come against subpar teams, either;
among them is an impressive 20-3 win
over then-No. 10 Michigan State and a
13-6 grind-it-out victory over then-No.
18 Michigan.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Both Stanford and Notre Dame have physical, fast defenses. It will be up to redshirt junior Trent Murphy (93)
and the Cardinal pass rush to pressure Notre Dame's quarterback and keep Stanford close on the road.
Shaw has also made sure that his
defenders are prepared for backup
quarterback Tommy Rees should he
get into the game. While head coach
Brian Kelley has made it clear that
Golson is the starter, Rees has seen
some playing time this year, including
11 pass attempts against the
Wolverines.
The Stanford secondary, which
gave up huge plays over the top that
led to Arizona's 491 passing yards last
weekend, will need to clamp down
against Golson. Although the
Cardinal defenders in the second level
have shown that they can be playmak
ers safety Ed Reynolds leads the
nation with 144 interception return
yards and rise to the occasion,
inconsistent coverage and shoddy
tackling have been two of the bigger
issues so far this season.
The Irish also boast a horde of tal
ented running backs, including Theo
Riddick, George Atkinson 111 and
Cierre Wood, who have been splitting
responsibilities in the backfield and
averaging over 187 rushing yards per
game. On the heels of allowing 100-
yard rushers in its last two games, the
Cardinal front seven will face a pow
erful offensive line that has made
great strides in its run blocking and
pass protection.
"[Their offensive line] is much
more downhill and much more physi
cal than they were a season ago," said
defensive end Ben Gardner. "They
look a lot like our own offensive line.
They're big bodies, but they're well
put together. We're looking forward to
that challenge because that's our style
of football at Stanford, and that's what
we signed up for when we came to

The Cardinal has laid its hands on
the Legends Trophy, annually given to
the winner of the rivalry game, for the
past three years. However, bringing the
trophy back to the Farm for the fourth
straight season will be a tall order con
sidering that this will be the highest
ranked Notre Dame team that
Stanford has faced since 1992, when

the Fighting Irish went into that
matchup as the No. 6 team in the
nation.
South Bend has not been particu
larly kind to Stanford, as it has gone 3-
10 at Notre Dame Stadium. And with
ESPN's College Game Day crew
attending tomorrow's game, the
Cardinal will face a hostile crowd
under the eyes of national viewers as it
did against Washington at
Century Link Field two weeks ago.
"We've gone on the road one time
this year, and we did not play well,"
Shaw said. "Defensively, we did a solid
job against Washington, but we still
allowed a 100-yard rusher and a 100-
yard receiver. We've done that two
games in a row. We need our defense
to play its best game this week."
An important task for Stanford's
defense is to limit the effectiveness of
Notre Dame quarterback Everett
Golson, a redshirt freshman who, like
Stanford quarterback Josh Nunes, is
coming off the best game of his rookie
career. Despite not tossing any touch
downs against Miami last Saturday,
Golson displayed his efficiency by
completing over 77 percent of his pass
es, as well as gaining 51 yards on the
ground.
Though inconsistent at times,
Golson has thus far led the Irish to a
perfect 5-0 record for the first time
since 2002. Not all of those wins have
come against subpar teams, either;
among them is an impressive 20-3 win
over then-No. 10 Michigan State and a
13-6 grind-it-out victory over then-No.
18 Michigan.

Both Stanford and Notre Dame have physical, fast defenses. It will be up to redshirt junior Trent Murphy (93)
and the Cardinal pass rush to pressure Notre Dame's quarterback and keep Stanford close on the road.
Shaw has also made sure that his
defenders are prepared for backup
quarterback Tommy Rees should he
get into the game. While head coach
Brian Kelley has made it clear that
Golson is the starter, Rees has seen
some playing time this year, including
11 pass attempts against the
Wolverines.
The Stanford secondary, which
gave up huge plays over the top that
led to Arizona's 491 passing yards last
weekend, will need to clamp down
against Golson. Although the
Cardinal defenders in the second level
have shown that they can be playmak
ers safety Ed Reynolds leads the
nation with 144 interception return
yards and rise to the occasion,
inconsistent coverage and shoddy
tackling have been two of the bigger
issues so far this season.
The Irish also boast a horde of tal
ented running backs, including Theo
Riddick, George Atkinson 111 and
Cierre Wood, who have been splitting
responsibilities in the backfield and
averaging over 187 rushing yards per
game. On the heels of allowing 100-
yard rushers in its last two games, the
Cardinal front seven will face a pow
erful offensive line that has made
great strides in its run blocking and
pass protection.
"[Their offensive line] is much
more downhill and much more physi
cal than they were a season ago," said
defensive end Ben Gardner. "They
look a lot like our own offensive line.
They're big bodies, but they're well
put together. We're looking forward to
that challenge because that's our style
of football at Stanford, and that's what
we signed up for when we came to
play here."
Nunes' five-touchdown perform
ance against Arizona was the big story
last weekend, earning him Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
The redshirt junior not only ran the
ball into the end zone three times, but
also executed two touchdown-scoring
drives when there was absolutely no
room for mistakes.
"I just go out there with the men
tality that each play needs to be our
best play," Nunes said.
While taking nothing away from
his breakout game last Saturday,
Nunes will face a much stiffer test
against a stout Notre Dame defense
that has allowed less than eight points
per game, which is good for second in
the country.
"We have something in common
with Notre Dame," said Shaw. "And
that's playing tough, physical defense,
loving our linebackers, running the
ball on offense and having the quar
terbacks do what they need to do to
win the game."
The heart and soul of the Irish
defense is undoubtedly inside line
backer MantiTe'o. At 6-foot-2 and 255
pounds, the consensus preseason first
team Ail-American linebacker has
forced his way into the Heisman con
versation with 48 tackles, three inter
ceptions, two fumble recoveries and
two quarterback hurries that resulted
in interceptions.
"You get on guys about form tack
les and wrapping up," said Shaw. "But
when Manti hits people, he doesn't
have a chance to wrap them up half

the time. He pops them, and they go
down, he's so physical It's uncan
ny; he's a special player."
Although Te'o may overshadow
many of his teammates, Notre Dame
has plenty of other game-changing
players on defense. Among them is
junior cornerback Bennett Jackson,
who also has three interceptions on
the season. Opponents have struggled
to inflict much damage on the Irish
through the air Notre Dame has
given up only three passing touch
downs while tallying eight picks and
14 sacks.
With Stanford's top wide receiver
Ty Montgomery injured, Nunes will
have to find away to get his other
wideouts, like Drew Terrell and Jamal-
Rashad Patterson, more involved, in
addition to his favorite tight end tar
gets Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo.
The Irish run defense has also
been lights out all season, allowing
only 106 yards per game on the
ground. Senior tailback Stepfan
Taylor, who has been efficiently aver
aging 4.7 yards per carry, probably
won't have the big running holes he
was presented with against the
Wildcats last weekend.
But Stanford's offensive line isn't
backing down.
"We have big guys that can play
physical but also have great feet and
are able to go up to a safety if need
be," said redshirt junior guard Khalil
Wilkes.
The Stanford players respect the
firmly rooted traditions that surround
Notre Dame's football program, but
that doesn't mean that they're treating
this game any differently.
"I love playing them, and I love
going to Notre Dame Stadium
because it's a beautiful place to play,
the fans are into it and you've got the
little leprechaun running around,"
said Gardner. "But in terms of most of
our team, they could care less. We're
just about what we do, about playing
big, physical football."
The Cardinal and the Irish clash in
a top-20 showdown tomorrow at
Notre Dame Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 12:30 p.m. PDT, with
national television coverage on NBC.
