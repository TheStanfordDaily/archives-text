# Sex Talk with the Tree: SAFETY IS SEXY

"Yo , are you free for some dome toniqht?"
I read the text and laughed, as if it were
a joke. Hell, I thought it was! But no, he
was absolutely serious. I knew that
I was one of the more sexually
experienced freshmen in 2009,
but I had no idea that I
would receive a text
blatantly asking for
oral sex.

I know we often say chivalry is dead, but
this takes it to a whole new level. I, in
fact, was not "free for some dome" that |
night, or any night, sir.
This text flashed my memory back
to high school; how had I arrived at this
point...
"Your pap smear is abnormal,"
my 08-GYN's voice crackled over
the telephone line. It was junior.
year of high school. I had not
even gone all the way yet,
and somehow it seemed that I ,
had a common strand
of HPV, a sexually |
transmitted infection
that causes genital warts.
"We are going to need
to take a biopsy sample of your cervix, to check for cancerous cells,"
he said as if he were telling me the current time. It was the most
painful, embarrassing and disgusting occurrence of my life. I felt
dirty. Thoughts raced through my mind how would anybody
ever love me or want me after this? Thankfully, it turned out to
be a false positive, but the shame and horror of this incident was
already ingrained in my mind.

After the
false alarm in
high school, I
promised myself that I would not
sleep with a guy unless he had
been tested. I knew this wasn't a
foolproof plan to avoid STl's,
especially things like HPV that
aren't preventable by condoms,
but I figured it would be the
safest thing I could do, aside from
abstaining, which wasn't going to
happen (cue the water polo play
er walking to the bathroom in
only his towel). How was I, a sex
ual woman with raging hor
mones, going to come to a new
university, with guys everywhere,
and somehow reel in my sex
drive? Maybe I didn't need to reel
it in completely, but just educate
myself and take the proper pre
cautions.
Since that first week of
freshman year, I have not had sex
with anybody at Stanford who
had not been tested first, and it
actually helped weed out some of
the worst jerks.
If they expected to get in my
pants, I figured they at least had
to respect me enough to get test
ed. I couldn't force anybody to
get tested, of course, but it made
sense to me that people would
want to protect themselves any
way. On top of that, I knew I
would enjoy the sex more if it
were safer.
I haven't had a guy say no
yet (knock on wood)! And, aside
from ignorant freshman BJ sex
ter, the guys who have agreed to

be tested have been pretty upright
men. The shocking part about
this is that only one in six guys
had ever been tested at Vaden!
They didn't even know how to
make an appointment, which is
probably the easiest thing in the
world.
So how exactly does one
work this seemingly ultimate
turnoff into conversation? I sup
pose you could do it anytime,
though I probably wouldn't rec
ommend doing it over a pumpkin
spice latte at the new Starbucks as
your professor stands behind you,
unless your prospective partner is
your professor...
For me and this, unlike a
condom, is not a one size fits all
I like to give guys a bit of a taste, a
tease, if you will, to show them
what they could have. Once it gets
to a point past making out and
some heavy petting, I say some
thing like "Hey, I would love to
take this to the next level, but I
don't sleep with guys until they get
tested and I know they are clean."
Then, I try to throw in something
sexy, like "Just imagine how much
fun we could have " For all of
my past partners out there, sorry
for the tease, but I hope it was
worth it I know it was for me!
You can even make a date
out of it; you know, go to the
movies, get some lunch, get test
ed, go on a walk. The normal first
date, for me at least.

So how exactly does one
work this seemingly ultimate
turnoff into conversation? I sup
pose you could do it anytime,
though I probably wouldn't rec
ommend doing it over a pumpkin
spice latte at the new Starbucks as
your professor stands behind you,
unless your prospective partner is
your professor...
For me and this, unlike a
condom, is not a one size fits all
I like to give guys a bit of a taste, a
tease, if you will, to show them
what they could have. Once it gets
to a point past making out and
some heavy petting, I say some
thing like "Hey, I would love to
take this to the next level, but I
don't sleep with guys until they get
tested and I know they are clean."
Then, I try to throw in something
sexy, like "Just imagine how much
fun we could have " For all of
my past partners out there, sorry
for the tease, but I hope it was
worth it I know it was for me!
You can even make a date
out of it; you know, go to the
movies, get some lunch, get test
ed, go on a walk. The normal first
date, for me at least.

"Yo , are you free for some dome toniqht?"
I read the text and laughed, as if it were
a joke. Hell, I thought it was! But no, he
was absolutely serious. I knew that
I was one of the more sexually
experienced freshmen in 2009,
but I had no idea that I
would receive a text
blatantly asking for
oral sex.

I know we often say chivalry is dead, but
this takes it to a whole new level. I, in
fact, was not "free for some dome" that |
night, or any night, sir.
This text flashed my memory back
to high school; how had I arrived at this
point...
"Your pap smear is abnormal,"
my 08-GYN's voice crackled over
the telephone line. It was junior.
year of high school. I had not
even gone all the way yet,
and somehow it seemed that I ,
had a common strand
of HPV, a sexually |
transmitted infection
that causes genital warts.
"We are going to need
to take a biopsy sample of your cervix, to check for cancerous cells,"
he said as if he were telling me the current time. It was the most
painful, embarrassing and disgusting occurrence of my life. I felt
dirty. Thoughts raced through my mind how would anybody
ever love me or want me after this? Thankfully, it turned out to
be a false positive, but the shame and horror of this incident was
already ingrained in my mind.

After the
false alarm in
high school, I
promised myself that I would not
sleep with a guy unless he had
been tested. I knew this wasn't a
foolproof plan to avoid STl's,
especially things like HPV that
aren't preventable by condoms,
but I figured it would be the
safest thing I could do, aside from
abstaining, which wasn't going to
happen (cue the water polo play
er walking to the bathroom in
only his towel). How was I, a sex
ual woman with raging hor
mones, going to come to a new
university, with guys everywhere,
and somehow reel in my sex
drive? Maybe I didn't need to reel
it in completely, but just educate
myself and take the proper pre
cautions.
Since that first week of
freshman year, I have not had sex
with anybody at Stanford who
had not been tested first, and it
actually helped weed out some of
the worst jerks.
If they expected to get in my
pants, I figured they at least had
to respect me enough to get test
ed. I couldn't force anybody to
get tested, of course, but it made
sense to me that people would
want to protect themselves any
way. On top of that, I knew I
would enjoy the sex more if it
were safer.
I haven't had a guy say no
yet (knock on wood)! And, aside
from ignorant freshman BJ sex
ter, the guys who have agreed to

be tested have been pretty upright
men. The shocking part about
this is that only one in six guys
had ever been tested at Vaden!
They didn't even know how to
make an appointment, which is
probably the easiest thing in the
world.
