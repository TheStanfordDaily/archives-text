# SPORTS BRIEF
## Men's soccer heads to Pacific Northwest for two 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
After two straight wins in Pac-12
play, including a resounding 2-0 victo
ry over rival California last week, the
men's soccer team heads out on the
road this weekend trying to maintain
its momentum.
Stanford (5-5, 2-1 Pac-12) is third
in the league standings at the moment
but can move up this weekend with
good results against Washington (7-3-
2,2-0-1) and Oregon State (6-4-1,1-
2).
First up tonight for the Cardinal
are the Beavers, who knocked off San
Diego State last weekend for their
first conference win. Oregon State is
always tough to beat at home, and
true to form has won all four of its
home matches this year.
Emery Welshman has been the
man for OSU, as he leads the league
in points (17) and goals (seven), more
than double the next highest scorer
on the team. But the Beavers have
also been stout in goal, as keeper
Matt Bersano leads the Pac-12 with a
miniscule 0.81 goals against average.
On Sunday, however, Stanford
will have to contend with another
high-octane scorer in Washington's
Dylan Tucker-Ganges, who is tied
with Welshman for the conference
lead with seven goals.
But it was less heralded players
who helped the Huskies to the upset
of the soccer season thus far. Michael
Gallagher and Nate Sackeyfio scored
a goal each as Washington held off
No. 8 UCLA last weekend on the
road in Los Angeles.
Tonight's matchup against
Oregon State will get under way at 7
p.m. from Corvallis, Ore., with
Sunday's match against the Huskies
slated to kick off at noon on the Pac
-12 Network.
