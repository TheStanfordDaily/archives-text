The Wayans family is filled to the brim with talent. It comes as no
surprise, then, that the two youngest brothers, Shawn and Marlon
Wayans, have followed in their family's footsteps as Hollywood
icons. Their combined comedic genius, in projects ranging from the
smash hit "Scary Movie" to the sitcom "The Wayans Bros." to their hilari
ous take on the chick flick, "White Chicks," illustrates just how much both
have accomplished in their relatively short careers.
Their ongoing comedy tour continued its circuit last night at the San
Jose Improv. Both Shawn and Marlon took some time off from their hec
tic schedules to chat with Intermission to discuss all of their work and
play in the entertainment industry, and to offer some advice to budding
performers.
Intermission (INT): Being a young college student, I can't help but ask..
. what was life like when you both were my age? What were your goals?
Marlon Wayans (MW): Well, I was the youngest of 10 brothers and sis
ters. Growing up, we had a pretty dramatic life hard sometimes. We
grew up poor and in the projects. With this perspective, we found ways to
make things light and fun.
Shawn Wayans (SW): [Laughter] I just wanted to have fun. I was living in
the moment, doing what made me happy and learning from my surround
ings. At that time, my brothers and I had just started our work in "In Living
Color," and it was exciting for all of my family. My goal was to have fun.
INT: Did either of you have any idea of where you thought you would fit
in, in this entertainment industry?
SW: We all had no idea things would start happening for us so quickly. I
just knew this was my calling. I tried to soak in everything from my envi
ronment and focus on learning as much as I could. It really is hard to
become a comedian. It was a hard thing to do, even if it was an easy
choice.
MW: We really did pretty much grow up in a house frail of legends, so it
was very easy to fall into this business. I always had someone to look up
to. I just wanted it. I had that passion.
INT: With this passion then, did you ever doubt yourself?
MW: Doubt was never really there. Rather, I felt intimidation growing up
with so many legendary people around me. When we first started,
though, I would ask Shawn, "What the hell am I doing?" Then I would
realize that everyone has their own point of view and has their own voice.
It wasn't doubt, but rather intimidation.
SW: I feel that it is not that you doubt yourself. You doubt maybe the situ
ation around you, but never yourself. All you can do is work hard and
aggressively pursue that. There is absolutely no other way to get by. If you
end up deciding to quit, that means you don't belong in this business. It
means you don't love it because if you really belong in this business,
you don't stop. You never stop. It's like my brother [Keenan Ivory Wayans]
says, "It is a force of nature to survive in the business. You have got to
wreak havoc, got to break windows."

INT: What can young performers do though to "break windows" and dif
ferentiate themselves if everyone wants to be in this business just as much
as the next person?
MW: Just be real. When you are real, you are unique. You have to craft your
own work. You cannot copy other people's material because people will know.
SW: You must also use your skill set. That is what makes you your skill
set. You have to work harder, smarter and more aggressively than anyone
else out there. Preparation meets opportunity, which equals success. You
have to prepare. There is no other way to get by.
INT: Should all aspiring entertainers make this their goal then?
SW: I would say yes. If you want to succeed in this industry, you have to
have that drive. You have to hold that spark and inspiration within you.
No one will listen to you if you don't.
INT: Does this personal inspiration then allow us to see the real side of
the Wayans brothers?
SW: Most definitely. Me and my brothers all just like to have a good time,
and we would not be in this business otherwise. We just want to make
people laugh [laughter]. If we have done that, then I'm happy.
MW: I also enjoy the challenge of making people laugh. It makes me
happy. Our humor is honest and observational everything from life to
music to sports. It is everything that is happening in our world.
INT: Marlon, your newest project, "A Haunted House," premieres the
beginning of this next year. With so many works you have already done,
why this one now?
MW: I like to cater to our audience, and I wanted to create something
new and exciting. For inspiration, I especially found a lot of humor in all
of those "Paranormal Activity" movies. Watching them, we would heckle
about how black people would deal with these situations [laughter]. My
new movie plays a lot on the silliness of it and it is just a great time. Our
projects always reflect our personal desires. Every move we make, we put
all of our faith behind that.
INT: Fortunately, we in the Bay Area have you here to show us that faith!
Both of you are continuing your comedy tour circuit at the San Jose
Improv until this coming Sunday. Do you find interacting with a live
audience as satisfying as producing an on-screen production?
SW: Definitely. They're both really different though. When doing movies,
it takes years before you actually know if it's funny. You have an idea, but
you aren't sure. Interacting with a live audience though, you know exactly
what works and what doesn't the minute that joke leaves your mouth. If
no one is laughing, then you have a problem.
INT: Is there anything in particular you and your brother wish to com
municate to people or to the college crowd through your stand-up show?
MW: I especially enjoy our stand-up performance because we talk about
everything. It is important for our audience to understand we keep it real.
SW: Nothing in particular [laughter]! I just want people to walk in, take
off their study boots, have fun and laugh. People should get a drink and
have a good time! That's what it's all about.
The show, "Shawn & Marlon Wayans," runs Friday (8 and 10p.m.), Saturday
(7 and 9p.m.) and Sunday (7p.m.) at the San Jose Improv. Marlon's newest
movie, "A Haunted House," is scheduled for release on Jan. 11, 2013, and his
BET series "Second Generation Wayans" airs the following month.
