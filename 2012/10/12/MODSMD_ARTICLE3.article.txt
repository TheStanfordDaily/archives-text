NO. 17 STANFORD [4-1,2-1 PAC-12]
AT NO. 7 NOTRE DAME (5-03

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 24, NOTRE DAME 21 : Sorry if I'm not
impressed by Notre Dame's offense scoring 41 against the
103rd-ranked defense in the nation (Miami) or dropping 50
on a Navy team that was shut out by San Jose State.
Stanford is the best defensive front the Irish have seen, peri
od. And Notre Dame's offensive line does not generate the
sort of push necessary to stop Stanford's defense from filling
the gaps and letting its talented linebacking core go to work
on the outside. I might be biased, but it's downright disgrace
ful for ESPN's Will Harris to take the Golden Domers by a full
three touchdowns. Stanford's D is one of the best in the
country, and while the offense isn't the prettiest girl at the
prom, she's at least getting a couple of offers to slow dance.
Just for that, I'm taking Stanford in what I see as a tossup
between two solid defenses and unproven offenses.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 17, NOTRE DAME 13: This game is
going to be a defensive struggle, with both front sevens
refusing to give an inch. Notre Dame is playing to keep its
national championship hopes alive, and Stanford is looking to
avoid a loss that would crush hopes of an at-large BCS berth.
Expect both defenses to come up with big plays over the
course of the game, but I've got this feeling that Stanford will
score again on defense to keep the game close, allowing one
chance for Josh Nunes to lead his team to a game-winning
touchdown at the end of the fourth quarter, even with the ghost
of Knute Rockne rolling over in his grave. Unlike at Washington,
this time Nunes gets it done on the road, overcoming three
sloppy quarters once again to pick up an enormous victory for
the Cardinal heading into the Pac-12 home stretch.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 20, NOTRE DAME 17: Field position
will be the determining factor in tomorrow's showdown. Both
the Cardinal and the Irish boast elite defenses that will
inevitably turn the game into a hard-hitting, defensive struggle.
Notre Dame's Everett Golson is certainly a capable quarter
back, but he's no Matt Scott. The Stanford front seven will put
heavy pressure on him all game long and record at least three
sacks. Quarterback Josh Nunes will throw an interception early
in the game, but look for him to settle down after that. He won't
have a five-touchdown field day like he did against Arizona, but
he'll find away to march the Cardinal down the field on at least
two touchdown-scoring drives. I'm going out on a limb by say
ing that Jordan Williamson comes up clutch for the first time
under the national spotlight, hitting a couple long field goals
late in the game to secure the Cardinal's fourth consecutive
Legends Trophy. Stanford 20, Notre Dame 17.
