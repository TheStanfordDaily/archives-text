# El Centro awards $6,000 in scholarships
## 
### EVE SIMISTER 
Thanks to an anonymous donation, El
Centro Chicano was able to honor an out
standing student from the sophomore, jun
ior and senior classes at its inaugural
Chicano and Latino Community Scholar
Convocation on Thursday afternoon in
Memorial Church.

The newly established Chicano/Latino
Scholar Prize for Academic Excellence
awards $2,000 to each student in the
Chicano/Latino community who finished
the previous academic year with the highest
GPA. This year's scholarship recipients
were Brandon Garcia 'l5, Megan
Mikhail'l4 and Anna Ponting 'l3.
El Centra's only undergraduate scholar
ship award until this year was a $5,000 schol
arship to a graduating senior that has been
awarded every spring for the past two years.
Paula Moya, associate professor of
English, welcomed the gathering of stu
dents and faculty and introduced the convo
cation as a completion of Nuestra
Graduation, the graduation ceremony that
El Centro hosts for families at the end of the
academic year.

Erica Fernandez 'l2 M.A. 'l3, the convo
cation's student speaker, and English profes
sor Ramon Saldivar, the faculty speaker,
reflected on the privilege of education.
"To be given this opportunity means a lot,
especially because I never thought I could
come to a place like Stanford. I mean, coming
from a small town in Mexico it was unheard
of" Fernandez said after the event. "It still has
n't hit me. Even though I just graduated and
now I'm back at grad school, it still hasn't hit."
Moya awarded the prizes before asking
attendees to recognize the academic achieve
ments of various groups within the
Chicano/Latino community, such as those
completing honors theses and the work of El
Centra's graduate scholars-in-residence, stu
dents chosen on the basis of their academic
performance and commitment to the
Chicano/Latino community.
"It makes you feel part of something big
ger than your academic program, when you
feel that kind of a sense of obligation to a
community," said Diego Roman M.S. 'l2
M.A.'l2 Ph.D.'l4, a graduate scholar-in-resi
dence.

After the convocation, attendees picked
up a dahlia on their way to a reception

where a spread of empanadas, ceviche and
other dishes were shared.
"Giving the dahlias to the students
meant a lot because my grandmother had
dahlias in her garden in Mexico," Fernandez
said. "This symbolic little thing really took
me back to where I come from If you
know where you come from, you know
where you are heading."
El Centro Chicano director Frances
Morales expressed pride and pleasure about
how the community came together for the
event.
"A lot of times we invite faculty to speak,
but we don't often see them sitting like right
now, enjoying a meal together with the stu
dents," she said. "It's very special to be able to
bring the faculty into an event like this."
About 40 students and faculty attended
the ceremony, but Morales predicts the
event will grow in the future.
"We could have seen a few more, but we
know that everything begins small I
know that this program will grow," Morales
said.
