## IntroSem apps rise for frosh 36 percent more apply to program this year 
### JUSTINE MOORE OLIVIA MOORE 
The number of freshmen
who applied for fall introduc
tory seminars (IntroSems) has
risen 36 percent from last year
while the number of sopho
mores has dropped by 13 per
cent, according to IntroSem
Program Director Russell
Berman.
67 percent of incoming
freshmen, 1,176 applicants in
total, applied to fall IntroSems
this year; 23 percent of the
sophomore class, 551 appli
cants in total, applied to fall
IntroSems. The total number
of IntroSems offered this year
is roughly equivalent to last
year, with 221 courses com
pared to 225 in the 2011-12
academic year.

I know that
it has been a very
popular program,
and I understand
why
STEPHEN HINTON,
humanities professor
co-founder

Berman attributed the
increase in freshman appli
cants to a "strong interest in
seminars across the board." He
referenced Think Like a
Designer, a fall IntroSem
taught by associate professor
of mechanical engineering
Shilajeet Banerjee M.S. 'OO,
which attracted over 230 appli
cants, as an example of an
IntroSem with high demand.
Stephen Hinton, professor
of humanities, who is teaching
two IntroSems this year,
believes that freshman appli
cations may have increased
because freshmen are no
longer required to take the
three-quarter Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM)
course. IHUM's replacement,
Thinking Matters, is only one
quarter long, leaving more
room in freshmen's schedules
for IntroSems.
"I know that it has been a
very popular program, and I
can understand why," Hinton
said. "[lntroSems] offer oppor
tunities for exploring a faculty
member's specialization with
them in a much more intimate
setting for the students."

The increase in freshman
applications comes at a time of
debate over whether
IntroSems should be required.
Last year's Study of
Undergraduate Education at

Stanford report recommended
that IntroSems become
mandatory by fall 2013, though
the Faculty Senate decided to
delay the decision until 2016.
While there is disagree
ment about mandating
IntroSems, many students and
faculty share Hinton's view
that IntroSems provide a spe
cial experience.
"I've heard from so many
upperclassmen, 'Take an
IntroSem, it's the best thing
ever,"' said Lauren Creadore
'l6, who is currently enrolled
in Visions of the 19605.

How Do People Learn
Math, a freshman-preference
IntroSem taught by professor
of education Jo Boaler, was in
high demand this quarter, with
approximately 75 applicants
for 17 spots. Boaler typically
teaches graduate and doctoral
students but decided to submit
a proposal for an IntroSem
after being encouraged by
Claude Steele, dean of the
School of Education.

"I wanted to inspire the
undergrads and get them real
ly interested in education,"
Boaler said. "I thought it
would be really nice to get to
them at the beginning of their
time at Stanford."
Berman cited this class as
one example of the more
unique offerings this year, as
Boaler's course is affiliated
with the School of Education
instead of an undergraduate
department.
"We are trying to offer
seminars in new areas, includ
ing from the professional
schools," Berman wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We are
urging departments to diversi
fy the scheduling times of sem
inars to make them available
to more students."

The Department of
Comparative Medicine, part of
the School of Medicine, strug
gled with scheduling the eight
IntroSems taught by depart
ment faculty this year. This is
the highest number of
IntroSems the department has
ever offered, according to
Donna Bouley, professor of
comparative medicine.
Bouley, who is teaching a
winter freshman-preference
course titled Comparative
Anatomy and Physiology of
Mammals, has been teaching
her IntroSem for 15 years, and
often does research projects or
independent studies with stu
dents who have taken her
IntroSem.

"I've had many students
who are English majors or
physics majors but still really
enjoyed [my IntroSem],"
Bouley said. "I would encourage
students to try to find something
that they are really interested in
or something that they've never
considered doing. It helps
broaden your education."

Berman cited this class as
one example of the more
unique offerings this year, as
Boaler's course is affiliated
with the School of Education
instead of an undergraduate
department.
"We are trying to offer
seminars in new areas, includ
ing from the professional
schools," Berman wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We are
urging departments to diversi
fy the scheduling times of sem
inars to make them available
to more students."

The Department of
Comparative Medicine, part of
the School of Medicine, strug
gled with scheduling the eight
IntroSems taught by depart
ment faculty this year. This is
the highest number of
IntroSems the department has
ever offered, according to
Donna Bouley, professor of
comparative medicine.
Bouley, who is teaching a
winter freshman-preference
course titled Comparative
Anatomy and Physiology of
Mammals, has been teaching
her IntroSem for 15 years, and
often does research projects or
independent studies with stu
dents who have taken her
IntroSem.

"I've had many students
who are English majors or
physics majors but still really
enjoyed [my IntroSem],"
Bouley said. "I would encourage
students to try to find something
that they are really interested in
or something that they've never
considered doing. It helps
broaden your education."

The number of freshmen
who applied for fall introduc
tory seminars (IntroSems) has
risen 36 percent from last year
while the number of sopho
mores has dropped by 13 per
cent, according to IntroSem
Program Director Russell
Berman.
67 percent of incoming
freshmen, 1,176 applicants in
total, applied to fall IntroSems
this year; 23 percent of the
sophomore class, 551 appli
cants in total, applied to fall
IntroSems. The total number
of IntroSems offered this year
is roughly equivalent to last
year, with 221 courses com
pared to 225 in the 2011-12
academic year.

I know that
it has been a very
popular program,
and I understand
why
STEPHEN HINTON,
humanities professor
co-founder

Berman attributed the
increase in freshman appli
cants to a "strong interest in
seminars across the board." He
referenced Think Like a
Designer, a fall IntroSem
taught by associate professor
of mechanical engineering
Shilajeet Banerjee M.S. 'OO,
which attracted over 230 appli
cants, as an example of an
IntroSem with high demand.
Stephen Hinton, professor
of humanities, who is teaching
two IntroSems this year,
believes that freshman appli
cations may have increased
because freshmen are no
longer required to take the
three-quarter Introduction to
the Humanities (IHUM)
course. IHUM's replacement,
Thinking Matters, is only one
quarter long, leaving more
room in freshmen's schedules
for IntroSems.
"I know that it has been a
very popular program, and I
can understand why," Hinton
said. "[lntroSems] offer oppor
tunities for exploring a faculty
member's specialization with
them in a much more intimate
setting for the students."

The increase in freshman
applications comes at a time of
debate over whether
IntroSems should be required.
Last year's Study of
Undergraduate Education at

Stanford report recommended
that IntroSems become
mandatory by fall 2013, though
the Faculty Senate decided to
delay the decision until 2016.
While there is disagree
ment about mandating
IntroSems, many students and
faculty share Hinton's view
that IntroSems provide a spe
cial experience.
"I've heard from so many
upperclassmen, 'Take an
IntroSem, it's the best thing
ever,"' said Lauren Creadore
'l6, who is currently enrolled
in Visions of the 19605.

How Do People Learn
Math, a freshman-preference
IntroSem taught by professor
of education Jo Boaler, was in
high demand this quarter, with
approximately 75 applicants
for 17 spots. Boaler typically
teaches graduate and doctoral
students but decided to submit
a proposal for an IntroSem
after being encouraged by
Claude Steele, dean of the
School of Education.

"I wanted to inspire the
undergrads and get them real
ly interested in education,"
Boaler said. "I thought it
would be really nice to get to
them at the beginning of their
time at Stanford."
Berman cited this class as
