## Senate discusses number of units 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate dis
cussed the increasing number
of units required for under
graduate majors, and the rising
percentage of Stanford stu
dents graduating with more
than the required ISO units, at
its first meeting of the academ
ic year.
Senate Chair Raymond
Levitt, professor of civil and
environmental engineering,
opened the meeting by wel
coming the new Senate
which includes 12 new mem
bers— and citing the accom
plishments of the body during
the previous academic year,
including the introduction of
sweeping changes to freshman
requirements.
Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Undergraduate
Education Martha Cyert then
opened the meeting's agenda
by presenting a report on stu
dent workload in majors, which
she framed as a logical devel
opment of research done by
the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford
(SUES).
"The SUES commission
didn't undergo direct review of
the major, but [it] did raise var
ious concerns about larger
majors constraining student
course choice," Cyert said.
"The purpose of this report is
to launch a discussion and give
us a starting point for further
study."
Discussing a report that
focused largely on variations in
the units required by different
majors, Cyert acknowledged
that relying on voluntary stu
dent responses in determining
time spent per academic credit
across majors offers limited
accuracy.

According to this report,
students enrolled in more tech
nical majors see themselves as
assuming a significantly

greater workload per unit of
credit. Federal regulations
establish an academic credit as
being two units of work out
side of class. Mechanical engi
neering and computer science
both breached a three-hour
benchmark of outside course
work per unit.
"It's clear that the two engi
neering majors do show signif
icantly higher hours of work,"
Cyert said.

The SUES report
expressed concern that the
potential for further growth in
major requirements might
infringe on freshman year's
freedom in course selection,
but Cyert said few majors have
changed significantly in the
number of units required for
graduation over the past 20
years.

Most majors, however, have
only increased marginally in
size, a trend matched by a
gradual increase in the number
of students graduating with
more than 180 units of aca

demic credit and a steadily ris
ing number of students opting
to pursue co-terminal degrees.
Kam Moler, professor of
physics, opened a panel discus
sion of the report's significance
by exploring the physics
department's reduction in
course requirements over time,
which she framed as an effort
to make the syllabus more
accessible and in tandem with
the evolution of graduates'
subsequent careers.
"We wanted the require
ments to reflect what we
thought a physicist should be,"
Moler said, noting that many
physics majors take additional
courses within the department.
Brad Osgood, professor of
electrical engineering, said the
School of Engineering's
demanding major require
ments were reflective of
accreditation conferred on five
of the school's majors by the
Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology,
which requires a year of math

and science in addition to a
year and a half of more in
depth engineering study.
By contrast, Gavin Jones,
English Department chair,
framed the English major's rel
atively lenient requirements as
the result of ongoing evalua
tion and soliciting student
feedback.

"Departments should regu
larly and rigorously assess the
size of their major," Jones said.
"Our unit count was the result
of thinking from the ground
up."

Rosemary Knight Ph.D.
'B5, professor of geophysics,
concluded the panel discussion
by defending the earth systems
program's onerous require
ments estimated by Cyert to
approach 150 units —as the
result of the program's com
plexity, and cited a positive stu
dent response to the program's
extensive offerings.
"We're trying to prepare

students to deal with the com
plexity of real-world environ
mental problems," Knight
said. "[Students] are drawn to
this multidisciplinary experi
ence."

Faculty discussion of the
report's finding focused on the
relationship between unit
counts and the work students
assume as a result, with sever
al senators inquiring whether
majors' higher unit counts
were forcing students to sacri
fice extracurricular pursuits or
other interesting classes.
"We're getting more and
more petitions to take more
than 20 units," said Vice
Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam.
Eric Roberts, professor of
computer science, argued that
the student body's transition
over time to more technical
majors had naturally led to a
greater proportion of under
graduate students becoming
enrolled in higher unit count

majors.
"We don't need to look for
hard explanations if there's an
easy one staring us in the
face," Roberts said.
"If this is what students
want, then we're meeting
those needs and there's no
problem to be solved," said
Mark Zoback M.5.73
Ph.D.'7s, professor of geo
physics.
Report on University informa
tion systems
The Senate then heard the
annual report of the
Committee on Academic
Computing and Information
Systems, delivered by Howard
Zebker Ph.D:B4, professor of
electrical engineering, and
Matthew Ricks, executive
director of computing services.
Zebker focused on short
comings in wireless infrastruc
ture but noted successful if
disjointed online education
experiments as focal points for
the committee's discussion in
the upcoming year. He dis
cussed the increasing inter
changeability between physi
cal and virtual learning envi
ronments and students'

reliance on both.
"This is their communica
tion medium, and we have to
be aware of that," Zebker said.
Ricks discussed the
University's current and
potential use of cloud comput
ing solutions for University
services, such as the recent
transition of undergraduate
email and calendar services to
Google.
"The challenge is [that] to
use those services without
contractual protection can put
Stanford at risk," Ricks said.
"By natural extension,
[data protection legislation]
applies to everything that hap
pens in the Medical School,"
said Andrew Fire, professor of
pathology and genetics. "It's
very important to ensure the
definition doesn't extend
beyond what truly is protected
health information."
The Senate will discuss
online education, including a
report by newly appointed
Vice Provost for Online
Learning John Mitchell, at its
next meeting on Oct. 25.

students to deal with the com
plexity of real-world environ
mental problems," Knight
said. "[Students] are drawn to
this multidisciplinary experi
ence."

Faculty discussion of the
report's finding focused on the
relationship between unit
counts and the work students
assume as a result, with sever
al senators inquiring whether
majors' higher unit counts
were forcing students to sacri
fice extracurricular pursuits or
other interesting classes.
"We're getting more and
more petitions to take more
than 20 units," said Vice
Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam.
Eric Roberts, professor of
computer science, argued that
the student body's transition
over time to more technical
majors had naturally led to a
greater proportion of under
graduate students becoming
enrolled in higher unit count

majors.
"We don't need to look for
hard explanations if there's an
easy one staring us in the
face," Roberts said.
"If this is what students
want, then we're meeting
those needs and there's no
problem to be solved," said
Mark Zoback M.5.73

physics.
Report on University informa
tion systems
The Senate then heard the
annual report of the
Committee on Academic
Computing and Information
Systems, delivered by Howard
Zebker Ph.D:B4, professor of
electrical engineering, and
Matthew Ricks, executive
director of computing services.
Zebker focused on short
comings in wireless infrastruc
ture but noted successful if
disjointed online education
experiments as focal points for
the committee's discussion in
the upcoming year. He dis
cussed the increasing inter
changeability between physi
cal and virtual learning envi
ronments and students'

reliance on both.
"This is their communica
tion medium, and we have to
be aware of that," Zebker said.
Ricks discussed the
University's current and
potential use of cloud comput
ing solutions for University
services, such as the recent
transition of undergraduate
email and calendar services to
Google.
"The challenge is [that] to
use those services without
contractual protection can put
Stanford at risk," Ricks said.
"By natural extension,
[data protection legislation]
applies to everything that hap
pens in the Medical School,"
said Andrew Fire, professor of
pathology and genetics. "It's
very important to ensure the
definition doesn't extend
beyond what truly is protected
health information."
The Senate will discuss
online education, including a
report by newly appointed
Vice Provost for Online
Learning John Mitchell, at its
next meeting on Oct. 25.

The Faculty Senate dis
cussed the increasing number
of units required for under
graduate majors, and the rising
percentage of Stanford stu
dents graduating with more
than the required ISO units, at
its first meeting of the academ
ic year.
Senate Chair Raymond
Levitt, professor of civil and
environmental engineering,
opened the meeting by wel
coming the new Senate
which includes 12 new mem
bers— and citing the accom
plishments of the body during
the previous academic year,
including the introduction of
sweeping changes to freshman
requirements.
Senior Associate Vice
Provost of Undergraduate
Education Martha Cyert then
opened the meeting's agenda
by presenting a report on stu
dent workload in majors, which
she framed as a logical devel
opment of research done by
the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford
(SUES).
"The SUES commission
didn't undergo direct review of
the major, but [it] did raise var
ious concerns about larger
majors constraining student
course choice," Cyert said.
"The purpose of this report is
to launch a discussion and give
us a starting point for further
study."
Discussing a report that
focused largely on variations in
the units required by different
majors, Cyert acknowledged
that relying on voluntary stu
dent responses in determining
time spent per academic credit
across majors offers limited
accuracy.

According to this report,
students enrolled in more tech
nical majors see themselves as
assuming a significantly

greater workload per unit of
credit. Federal regulations
establish an academic credit as
being two units of work out
side of class. Mechanical engi
neering and computer science
both breached a three-hour
benchmark of outside course
work per unit.
"It's clear that the two engi
neering majors do show signif
icantly higher hours of work,"
Cyert said.

The SUES report
expressed concern that the
potential for further growth in
major requirements might
infringe on freshman year's
freedom in course selection,
but Cyert said few majors have
changed significantly in the
number of units required for
graduation over the past 20
years.

Most majors, however, have
only increased marginally in
size, a trend matched by a
gradual increase in the number
of students graduating with
more than 180 units of aca

demic credit and a steadily ris
ing number of students opting
to pursue co-terminal degrees.
Kam Moler, professor of
physics, opened a panel discus
sion of the report's significance
by exploring the physics
department's reduction in
course requirements over time,
which she framed as an effort
to make the syllabus more
accessible and in tandem with
the evolution of graduates'
subsequent careers.
"We wanted the require
ments to reflect what we
thought a physicist should be,"
Moler said, noting that many
physics majors take additional
courses within the department.
Brad Osgood, professor of
electrical engineering, said the
School of Engineering's
demanding major require
ments were reflective of
accreditation conferred on five
of the school's majors by the
Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology,
which requires a year of math

and science in addition to a
year and a half of more in
depth engineering study.
By contrast, Gavin Jones,
English Department chair,
framed the English major's rel
atively lenient requirements as
the result of ongoing evalua
tion and soliciting student
feedback.

"Departments should regu
larly and rigorously assess the
size of their major," Jones said.
"Our unit count was the result
of thinking from the ground
up."

Rosemary Knight Ph.D.
'B5, professor of geophysics,
concluded the panel discussion
by defending the earth systems
program's onerous require
ments estimated by Cyert to
approach 150 units —as the
result of the program's com
plexity, and cited a positive stu
dent response to the program's
extensive offerings.
