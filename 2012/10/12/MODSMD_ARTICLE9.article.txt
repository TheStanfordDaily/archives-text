## Bowen urges universities to fix rising education costs 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD 
William G. Bowen, former
president of Princeton University,
drew attention to the crippling
debt burden placed on stu
dents by universities in his two
part talk on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings. Emphasizing
the power of institutions like
Stanford and Princeton, he
argued that a cooperative and
immediate effort by elite uni
versities could pull America's
national higher education system
back from the brink of disaster.

His presentation, part of
the annual Tanner Lectures on
Human Values hosted at nine
universities across the world,
set out to explain causes and
present solutions for what he

considers the dire economic
threats stemming from the
increasing costs of higher edu
cation.
"Context matters," he said
to begin Wednesday night's
lecture, titled "The
Productivity Problem in
Higher Education." He then
summarized the aspects of
higher education economics
that he believes are most dam
aging, drawing attention to the
challenging long-term upward
trend of educational costs.
"I documented the seem
ingly inexorable tendency for
institutional cost per student to
rise faster than [inflation] over
the long term... an underly
ing pattern which has been
found to hold for public as well
as private universities and col

leges," he said.
Rising costs at the richest
top-tier universities put unsus
tainable pressure on the entire
system of higher education,
but, according to Bowen, these
universities also have the
power to reverse that trend.

"Institutions have an
understandable interest in
always improving themselves,
even if the immediate interest
in self-improvement cuts
across general societal self
interest," he said. "Still, the
most privileged places should
think hard about the ramifica
tions of their [increasing
costs]."

He called for universities to
take initiatives against their
institutional instinct and short
term individual interests in
favor of social good.
In Thursday's lecture, he
turned to solutions to cost
problems in a lecture titled
"The Prospects for an Online
Learning Fix."
"Is online learning a fix for
the cost disease?" he asked.
"My answer: not by itself. But
it can be part of the answer. It
is certainly no panacea for this
country's deep-seated educa
tional problems."

He made it clear that he did
not envision a major shift from
the traditional college setting
to an online system, but hoped
for a mix of both.
"My plea is for the adop
tion of a portfolio approach to
curricular development that
provides a carefully calibrated
mix of learning styles," he said.
"[That means] some online
learning, much person-to-per
son interaction, directed study
and all the rest."
Still, he maintains that
online learning must have a
role in all colleges and univer
sities, public and private alike.
Indeed, over the course of his
two lectures, Bowen empha
sized the necessity of top uni
versities adapting to new mod
els of education.
"As the technologies grow
increasingly sophisticated and
we learn more about how stu
dents learn and what pedagog
ical methods are better in dif
ferent fields, even top-tier insti
tutions will stand to gain with

the use of such technologies to
improve student learning," he said.
His closing reflections empha
sized the need for patience in finding

a solution. Bowen argued that, when
faced with problems we cannot
answer, we must buy time to let our
selves adapt and find a solution.
"[That] is the job of the Stanfords
of the world," he said.
