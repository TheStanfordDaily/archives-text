## THE 						QUICK LIST Everything You need to know LETTER FROM TREASURE ISLAND The 						Colloquialist 
### Madeline Sides | DESK EDITOR 
Good vibes. Nice people
being chill. Treasure Island
is the hipster playground
of your dreams.
Where else can you get a
henna tattoo, make your own ter
rarium, snack on Korean burritos
and jump on trampolines, all while
rocking out to bands that you may
have never heard of (but definitely
should have) or have shrines to in
your closet?
The annual festival held on
Treasure Island, an old military
base in the San Francisco Bay, fea
tured two days packed with bands
like the xx, MB3 and Girl Talk. The
festival has a music festival feel,
with an unmistakable San
Francisco flare. A sea of food
trucks, artist stands, compost bins,

funky installation art and a viewing
platform straight out of Burning
Man dot the space between two
large stages. The crowd is a bit
eclectic everyone grooves along
in their own "this is my moment
with my music" kind of way.
The crowd is feeling good and
grooving to Best Coast, jamming
with MB3. Eight hours into my
island venture, and I'm feeling so
much love for San Francisco. We all
wait anxiously for the one and only
punk-pop import the xx, the last
act of the weekend, and I can't help
but think how lucky we are to live
this close to a great American city.

Secret genius [see-krit jeen -yuhs],
noun:
1. A person whose intellectual or artistic prowess is
not readily apparent. Often, the secret genius either
possesses some other attribute which overshadows
his or her true acumen, or determines to hide the
genius for some other reason: Try as she might to
reinvent herself as a wanton party-girl, Amanda could
n't hide her Grammy-winning opera voice, and so her
fellow Larkinites soon discovered she was in fact a
secret genius.
