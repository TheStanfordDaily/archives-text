## Do You MIND? Stanford should offer precalculus 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
/ / Tt'd be like if you took everyone
I in CS 106A, put them in 1068
-I_or X and told them, 'Have fun,
some Java is necessary, but we're
Stanford so we expect you to know
that already," C.J. told me Sunday
afternoon.

C.J. is taking 15 units this quarter â€”
CS 106A (5 units), accelerated French
(5 units), Math 19 (3 units) and two one
unit courses, one on nutrition and one
on entrepreneurial thought. He said he
wants to be an economics major.
Seems normal for a first-year student,
right?

Right, except that the most
advanced math course available to C.J.
before college was Algebra 11. His high
school once tried to offer a combined
algebra/precalculus course, but the
teacher had to spend time going over
algebra again and never reached pre
calculus.

For those unfamiliar with the
Stanford curriculum, the Math 19/20/21
classes form a three-quarter introduc
tory single-variable calculus series.
Math 41/42 cover the same material in
two quarters.

"I devote most of my time to
math," C.J. said of his classes. "A lot of
my other peers will spend an appropri
ate amount of time with the homework
and then go on with their week, where
as it takes me up to 25 hours."
These 25 hours include teaching
himself precalculus from a textbook he
bought, watching online videos and
consulting his roommates, dorm
friends and resident tutor (RT).
"I wish I could go on with my CS
assignment and do well in that class,
but unfortunately, having to spend so
much time in math, I have to withdraw
from CS," C.J. told me.

Even with the study deadline
extended through Monday, C.J. cannot
drop CS because it would put him
under 12 units, he said.

C.J. said he's considering reaching
out to the Center for Teaching and
Learning (CTL) in addition to his RT,
but commented that going through
each of these seems to be a lot of work
when Stanford could just offer a pre
calculus course.

"You could do precalc for one
semester and then Math 41/42 and fin
ish in the same amount of time [as the
19/20/21 series]," he said.
As C.J. pointed out, other gateway
STEM disciplines (including physics,
chemistry and computer science) offer
introductory classes that assume no
prior knowledge Physics 19 requires
only high school algebra and trigonom
etry, for example.

To those who might ask, 'Why is he
taking the class, then? He could take
statistics,' C.J. and 1 pose another ques
tion: Why shouldn't he?

"I want to take a lot of math cours
es here," C.J. told me, saying Math 51
(linear algebra and multivariable cal
culus) is required for the economics
degree he's interested in pursuing.
While I was inspired by C.J. and
have no doubt he'll succeed, his situa
tion raises a lot of questions about our

university and larger educational sys
tem.

"Just because someone comes from
a background where they're not
advantaged to get AP math/science
doesn't mean they don't want to be an
engineer," C.J. told me.

While pre-college programs like
Stanford Summer Engineering Academy
(SSEA) and Leland Scholars help stu
dents from underrepresented and
underserved backgrounds transition
into STEM coursework, these pro
grams still fail students like C.J. stu
dents who, not for lack of interest, abil
ity or trying, have not had adequate
access to advanced math courses in
high school.

C.J. said he thinks a majority of the
students in this situation probably have
the drive to push through these blocks,
but will ultimately fail.

"Not because they're not good
enough," he cautioned. "It's because
the time commitment and resource
commitment aren't there."
Just as it's unrealistic to think stu
dents could teach or re-teach them
selves a year of high school math dur
ing a 10-week quarter amidst other
classes and college expectations, it is
unrealistic that a three- or four-week
pre-college program could do the
same.

Noting that he's not afraid of the
science, technology, engineering and
math (STEM) requirements, C.J. said,
"It's just that they don't provide [math
at the level [underserved students
need they assume everyone's com
ing from the same background."
The evidence of disparate levels of
access and resources along intersecting
lines of class, race and immigration sta
tus needs no discussion beyond saying
that the usual suspects are at a severe
disadvantage.

I am aware that our society is by no
means meritocratic. And I therefore
will not argue that Stanford and its
peers should, or even do, "level the
playing field" along lines of class/race
disparities in the world.

Within our very limited bubble,
however, I will argue that the
University should do everything it pos
sibly can to reduce access and opportu
nity gaps.

Stanford prides itself on offering
seminars to less than 15 students, and
an individual student can request for
mal instruction in any language the
University doesn't already teach; offer
ing a precalculus course would demon
strate Stanford's commitment to stu
dent interest and need and would cre
ate a wealth of benefits for students
who have reached Stanford in spite of
a classist and racist American educa
tion system.

Kristian is stoked that this column
was sparked by a random lunchtime
conversation and thinks you should
be too! To be clear, he is indeed solic
iting lunch/conversation with stu
dents on other undiscussed topics
(no columns guaranteed). Respond
to kbailey@stanford.edu.
