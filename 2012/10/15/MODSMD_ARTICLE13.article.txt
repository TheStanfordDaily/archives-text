## Lessons from above 
### Miles Unterreiner 
When professional daredevil
Felix Baumgartner fell to
earth at 833.9 miles per hour
yesterday, he shattered records,
helped acquire valuable data for
future scientific endeavors and capti
vated millions of viewers around the
world. But his four minutes of free fall
and eventual safe landing in the New
Mexico desert did much more than
that. It also provided a model for
what the future of space exploration
and great enterprise, more gener
ally could look like.

First, Baumgartner's jump was
financed by Red Bull, a private cor
poration with a financial interest in
big-time media publicity and an
apparent penchant for the daring and
dangerous. In an era of drastic cuts in
government funding for research and
development, Red Bull spent untold
millions of dollars on a project that
took five years to plan. Private corpo
rations like Red Bull have one institu
tional advantage over governments in
this regard: Political administrations
come and go quickly, as do their pri
orities and ideologies, making long
term national projects from wars
to space exploration to basic research
difficult to sustain. Exxon-Mobil
CEO Lee Raymond famously
remarked, "We see governments
come and go." That is terrifying. But it
also speaks to the unique capability of
corporations to think big, and long
term, in ways ephemeral democratic
governments can't or won't.
Second, the scientific expertise
backing Red Bull Stratos (the official
name for Baumgartner's death-defy
ing stunt) flowed from a combination
of private ingenuity and publicly
funded research and education. The
mission's medical director, Jonathan
Clark, previously oversaw the health

of astronauts at NASA. Joe Kittinger,
the 84-year-old who previously held
the highest-jump record and was in
charge of direct communication
between mission control in Roswell
and the ascending Mr. Baumgartner,
acquired his formidable skills in the
United States Air Force. Mike Todd,
who designed Mr. Baumgartner's
next-generation suit, worked for
defense contractor Lockheed Martin.
Senior flight engineer Marie Hewitt is
a retired U.S. Navy commander, while
Technical Project Director Art
Thompson received his education in
the public University of California
system and then founded his own suc
cessful aerospace firm.

Third, Red Bull Stratos required a
sustained, collective application of
effort by a well-coordinated team of
dedicated professionals, many of
whom will go forever unmentioned in
the major news reports. It required
phenomenal levels of personal courage
and initiative by one particularly dar
ing man, yes. But sheer guts and indi
vidual heroism weren't enough the
project also required contributions
from a vast array of hardworking men
and women whose names won't make
it into the record books.
Fourth, people care, and care a lot.
Eight million people tuned in to Red
Bull's live feed of Baumgartner's
dive, shattering the previous You Tube
record of half a million (recorded
during the Summer Olympics).
Human beings still want to expand
the boundaries of what is technologi
cally and physically possible, even at
tremendous financial cost and with
little direct and immediate benefit to
themselves.
All of this is instructive and
encouraging.
As companies like Elon Musk's

SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin
Galactic forge farther outward and
upward, we could use more projects
modeled on the example of Red Bull
Stratos. Great achievements can be
realized, knowledge expanded, barri
ers broken, by harnessing the engines
of private enterprise to the technical
skills provided by a well-funded sys
tem of public education and a vision
articulated by the collective will.
There are many men and women
out there ready to be the next Felix
Baumgartner ready to chart new
frontiers in space, medicine, the arts
and engineering. If yesterday's spec
tacle was any indication, we can all
help them get there by channeling
the formidable power of the invisible
hand, by supporting the new and the
innovative and by recognizing and
celebrating the valuable contribu
tions society at large makes to the
achievements of each individual hero.
"Sometimes," remarked Mr.
Baumgartner as he prepared to fall
from the heavens, "you have to go up
really high to understand how small
you really are." How right he was.
