## Inches away from the elite 
### Joseph Beyda 
A couple of inches is all that
separated Stepfan Taylor
from the tying touchdown in
overtime, all that separated
the Cardinal from 5-1
through the first half of its season and all
that will separate Stanford from the col
lege football elite in 2012.
No. 17 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pac-12) gave
No. 7 Notre Dame (6-0) a fight but could
n't get into the endzone on offense,
couldn't hold onto its late lead and could
n't punch the ball home in a goal-line sit
uation in overtime. All of that is upsetting
in what could have been another state
ment game (albeit without conference
implications) on the national level. All of
that confirms what we expected of the
Cardinal two months ago.

The Cardinal has enough to be very
good in 2012. It just doesn't have enough
to be great
We've forgotten that at times over the
last, wild month. The epic upset of No. 2
USC brought back BCS hopes and the
shootout win against Arizona brought
back faith in Stanford's offense; eerily
similar road losses to Washington and
the Irish brought us all back down to
earth.
Despite that journey, Stanford's over
all performance through six games
couldn't be closer to what had been pre
dicted for this season. The front seven is
stout, the running game is steady and the
tight ends are magnetic on offense, just
as the Cardinal needed them to be. But
at the same time, the secondary is imper
fect, the receivers are insufficient and the
quarterback is inconsistent.
I do believe that Josh Nunes is the
right quarterback for Stanford, yet he
has failed his only two road tests.
Washington and Notre Dame both pre
sented defensive challenges that he
couldn't overcome. His Pac-12 Offensive
Player of the Week performance against
the Wildcats was electric, but it was sand
wiched between consecutive losses in
which he completed less than 50 percent
of his passes. Another one of those at
Berkeley for Big Game next Saturday
would be upsetting to say the least. (For
the full-time Nunes doubters out there, it
would be a mistake to give the job to
Brett Nottingham, who would have to go
through the same road-trip learning
curve that Nunes has struggled with and
wouldn't have enough games to grow
comfortable in that role.)
Nunes hasn't had very much help,
remember. Catchable passes have been
dropped in all six games by receivers,
backs and tight ends alike, and the
Cardinal seriously lacks weapons on the
outside. Ty Montgomery didn't do much
in his first five games and couldn't con
tribute on Saturday due to injury; Drew
Terrell and Jamal-Rashad Patterson
have gotten open but haven't made the
big plays needed to buoy Stanford's
offense.
As a result, every week is a crapshoot
with this Cardinal team. It's the epitome
of the post-Andrew-Luck era: The talent
is there, but not always.
We have no reason to be dissatisfied
with Stanford through its first half, the
harder portion of its schedule. Things
would be much worse if the Cardinal
had lost to USC and much better if it had
beaten Washington or Notre Dame, but
it didn't. Stanford is definitely better than
four of the teams remaining on its sched
ule (the Oregon schools on back-to-back
weeks being the exceptions), so an eight
or nine-win season is definitely still in the
cards.
There's a good chance Stanford will
drop out of the rankings on Sunday for
the first time since September 2010. It
doesn't deserve to. The Cardinal is one of
the best 25 programs in the country and
came very close to a 5-1 record this
weekend. But that's college football.
There are a host of things Stanford
could have done better against the Irish;
its inability to capitalize on red-zone
chances and defend the lob pass stand
out. Against a Notre Dame team that,
like the Cardinal, makes you pay for
your mistakes, there just wasn't enough
for the win.
Stanford and its mirror image were sepa
rated by just a couple of inches on
Saturday, and that's all it took.

shirt every day this week in anticipation

lege football elite in 2012.
No. 17 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pac-12) gave
No. 7 Notre Dame (6-0) a fight but could
n't get into the endzone on offense,
couldn't hold onto its late lead and could
n't punch the ball home in a goal-line sit
uation in overtime. All of that is upsetting
in what could have been another state
ment game (albeit without conference
implications) on the national level. All of
that confirms what we expected of the
Cardinal two months ago.

The Cardinal has enough to be very
good in 2012. It just doesn't have enough
to be great
We've forgotten that at times over the
last, wild month. The epic upset of No. 2
USC brought back BCS hopes and the
shootout win against Arizona brought
back faith in Stanford's offense; eerily
similar road losses to Washington and
the Irish brought us all back down to
earth.
Despite that journey, Stanford's over
all performance through six games
couldn't be closer to what had been pre
dicted for this season. The front seven is
stout, the running game is steady and the
tight ends are magnetic on offense, just
as the Cardinal needed them to be. But
at the same time, the secondary is imper
fect, the receivers are insufficient and the
quarterback is inconsistent.
I do believe that Josh Nunes is the
right quarterback for Stanford, yet he
has failed his only two road tests.
Washington and Notre Dame both pre
sented defensive challenges that he
couldn't overcome. His Pac-12 Offensive
Player of the Week performance against
the Wildcats was electric, but it was sand
wiched between consecutive losses in
which he completed less than 50 percent
of his passes. Another one of those at
Berkeley for Big Game next Saturday
would be upsetting to say the least. (For
the full-time Nunes doubters out there, it
would be a mistake to give the job to
Brett Nottingham, who would have to go
through the same road-trip learning
curve that Nunes has struggled with and
wouldn't have enough games to grow
comfortable in that role.)
Nunes hasn't had very much help,
remember. Catchable passes have been
dropped in all six games by receivers,
backs and tight ends alike, and the
Cardinal seriously lacks weapons on the
outside. Ty Montgomery didn't do much
in his first five games and couldn't con
tribute on Saturday due to injury; Drew
Terrell and Jamal-Rashad Patterson
have gotten open but haven't made the
big plays needed to buoy Stanford's
offense.
As a result, every week is a crapshoot
with this Cardinal team. It's the epitome
of the post-Andrew-Luck era: The talent
is there, but not always.
We have no reason to be dissatisfied
with Stanford through its first half, the
harder portion of its schedule. Things
would be much worse if the Cardinal
had lost to USC and much better if it had
beaten Washington or Notre Dame, but
it didn't. Stanford is definitely better than
four of the teams remaining on its sched
ule (the Oregon schools on back-to-back
weeks being the exceptions), so an eight
or nine-win season is definitely still in the
cards.
There's a good chance Stanford will
drop out of the rankings on Sunday for
the first time since September 2010. It
doesn't deserve to. The Cardinal is one of
the best 25 programs in the country and
came very close to a 5-1 record this
weekend. But that's college football.
There are a host of things Stanford
could have done better against the Irish;
its inability to capitalize on red-zone
chances and defend the lob pass stand
out. Against a Notre Dame team that,
like the Cardinal, makes you pay for
your mistakes, there just wasn't enough
for the win.
Stanford and its mirror image were sepa
rated by just a couple of inches on
Saturday, and that's all it took.
