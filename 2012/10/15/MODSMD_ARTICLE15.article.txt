The women's volleyball team's
13-game winning streak was put to
the test Friday night as they took on
the seventh-ranked defending
national champions UCLA at
Maples Pavilion. UCLA battled
hard in the five-set match, but in the
end, it was the No. 4 Cardinal that
came out with the win, improving its
record to 16-2 overall. The Card is
now 8-0 in conference play for the
first time since 1998, when the team
opened 17-0 overall.

Freshman middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku provided the extra spark
that the Card needed to finish off
the Bruins, registering a career-high
17 kills on 31 attempts with only
four errors, for a .419 hitting per
centage. "My team is really good

with finishing," she said, "and it was
all about trust in the end. Everyone
did their job and I'm so glad we got
it done."
Stanford was able to gain a 1-0
lead after the first set by capitaliz
ing on UCLA's 12 attack errors and
.089 attack percentage. The Bruins
did come up with a late run, tying
the game 20-20, but it wasn't
enough as the Cardinal took the set
25-23.
The second set proved to be a
much better effort by the Bruins as
they improved to only three errors
and a .462 hitting percentage. The
Card hit only .256 in the set, and
despite the nine tie scores and three
lead changes, Stanford wasn't able to
hold on as the Bruins took the set
25-19.
The Card persevered in the third
set through fifteen tie scores and
nine lead changes to come from
behind twice to capture a 28-26 vic
tory. The tenacity of Stanford's
defense held the UCLA offense to
only .127 in hitting, while the Card

recorded 17 kills and five blocks in
the set.
Freshman outside hitter Jordan
Burgess was instrumental in the
Card's effort against the Bruins,
posting career highs with 19 kills and
19 digs to earn her eighth double
double of the season. She logged
seven kills and five digs in the gritty
third-set win.
The Bruins defense answered
back in the fourth set, holding the
Cardinal offense to their lowest
offensive output of the night at .184.
The Card kept it close early in the set,
but six kills each by UCLA's Tabi
Love and Kelly Reeves were too
much to overcome as the Bruins
forced a fifth set with a 25-17 fourth
set win.
The Bruins took the early lead as
the Card trailed 12-9 in the fifth. But
it was back-to-back kills by sopho
more outside hitter Morgan
Boukather that initiated a 4-0
Stanford run and sealed the 16-14
fifth-set win that clinched the 3-2 vic
tory over the Bruins.

"I know my team. We've been
there before; we've gone to fifth
games. I wasn't really worried; I
knew my team, I trusted them and I
knew we were going to finish it and
close it out," Ajanaku said.
UCLA actually outscored the
Card 113-105 in the Stanford win
and finished with a higher hitting
percentage at .215 compared to the
Card's .214. The Cardinal was deter
mined, however, to end its two-game
losing streak against the Bruins, who
now fall to 12-4 overall and 4-3 in the
Pac-12.
The win brings huge confidence
to the Cardinal as it ends its four
game homestand on a high note and
looks to take on No. 2 Washington
on Friday.
"Washington and every team is
beatable at this moment I think, so
we're just going to go in, play our
game and see what happens,"
Ajanaku said.
