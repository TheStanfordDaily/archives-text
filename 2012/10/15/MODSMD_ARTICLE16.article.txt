## East Coast trip proves hostile NO. 1 UCONN A RUDE HOST 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In recent years, women's field
hockey coach Tara Danielson has
made a commitment to scheduling
more competitive games. That effort
was evident this weekend when the
Cardinal faced top-ranked Syracuse
on Friday and the nation's sole
unbeaten team, No. 4 Connecticut,
on Sunday. Stanford lost both
matches but hoped to benefit from
the experience of facing the coun
try's best teams before its return to
the Farm.

"We humbly know these teams
are very good. Both Syracuse and
Connecticut have legacies over the
past decade," Danielson told
GoStanford.com before the week
end. "But it's an opportunity for us
to rise and start to play Stanford's
brand of hockey, which the girls have
been working on diligently for the
last year and a half. That's what we
are most excited about."
On Friday afternoon, Stanford
traveled to Amherst, Mass., to take
on Syracuse. This was the third time
this year that the Cardinal has
played the nation's No. 1 team,
although the third different team it

played with that distinction. Earlier
in the season, Stanford lost to both
Maryland and North Carolina when
each team held the top ranking.
Unfortunately for the Card, the
third time did not prove the charm,
as they fell to the Orange 4-1.

For most of the afternoon, the
game was tighter than the final score
line would show. Twelve minutes
into the game, Stanford took a 1-0
lead. The Cardinal was awarded a
penalty corner after a Syracuse foul
in the circle. Junior midfielder Elise
Ogle played the ball in to sopho
more midfielder Shannon Herold,
who moved it to defender Becky
Dru. The senior captain pushed the
ball past Syracuse goalkeeper Leann
Stiver for her seventh goal of the
season and fifth in three games.
The Orange equalized on a great
individual effort by forward Alyssa
Manley in the 27th minute. The
game remained tied until the 56th
minute, when Syracuse was awarded
a penalty corner. Cardinal goalkeep
er Dulcie Davies, who had five saves
on the day, blocked the first shot, but
on the ensuing play, Orange forward
Kelsey Millman directed the ball
past Davies to take the lead.
Millman added her second goal of
the game just five minutes later
when she scored from close range to
extend the lead to 3-1. Manley put in
another in the 67th minute to close
out the scoring.

Stanford then traveled south to
play at the University of
Connecticut on Sunday. In a defen
sive battle, the Huskies recorded a 1-
0 win to keep their undefeated sea
son alive. Stanford is now 0-4 all

time against the Huskies.
UConn thought it had scored the
game's first goal midway through
the first half, but the referees ruled
that the ball had hit the foot of a
UConn player and disallowed the
goal.

Davies and the Cardinal defense
stood firm until five minutes into the
second half, when UConn forward
Marie Elena Bolles dribbled down
the field and passed to a wide-open
Sophie Bowden in front of the cage.
Bowden slipped the ball past Davies
to give UConn the lead.
Although the Cardinal took
seven shots on the day, only one was
on target. That was not enough to
solve UConn All-American goal

keeper Sarah Mansfield, who
recorded her sixth shutout of the
year. Davies made two saves in the
Cardinal net to keep the game close.
The tough road trip concludes
Stanford's nonconference schedule.
The second half of NorPac play
begins this Friday when Stanford
faces Pacific at 4 p.m. at home. The
Cardinal is currently 3-0 in confer
ence, including a 4-1 win over the
Tigers on Oct. 7, and will likely need
to finish first or second in the league
to secure a berth in the NCAA tour
nament.
