## Enrollment up in Earth Sciences School sees 40 percent increase over six years 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Classes in the School of Earth
Sciences are becoming increasingly
popular, with enrollment rising
approximately 40 percent in the
past six years. Pamela Matson,
dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, attributed increased stu
dent enrollment to the growing
interest in focus on sustainability
challenges.
"The world is facing huge chal
lenges as we try to meet the needs
of a still-growing and more con
suming human population
needs for food, energy, water and
other things while at the same
time protecting our climate ecosys
tems and environment," Matson
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The increase is largely due to
increased enrollment in the
school's Earth Systems Program,
the school's largest undergraduate
program; the Environment and
Resources graduate program; and
the Department of Energy
Resources Engineering, which
offers both undergraduate and
graduate degrees.
The rapid growth in student
enrollment has led to a need to
grow the faculty to accommodate
the growing student population.
"The programs and faculty
draw new students, and the grow
ing student population encourages
us to hire new faculty a positive
feedback," Matson said.
The School of Earth Sciences
plans to hire five or six new faculty
members to achieve a 10 percent
increase from its current faculty
size of 55, many of whom are sen
ior fellows at the Woods Institute
for the Environment. The school
hired between one and three facul
ty members per year over the past
decade, which Matson character
ized as a considerable increase in
faculty size.
Faculty hiring in the new geobi
ology program the study of the
interaction of environment and
biology over Earth's history will
begin in January, but Matson said
that the school plans to grow its
geobiology faculty over the next
couple of years to aid the develop
ment of a research program in geo-
biology.
The School of Earth
Sciences has also hired staff
members in response to the
recent increases in student
enrollment. The staff size
increase was intended to keep
up with the size of the student
body, as well as to aid the fac
ulty as they increase offerings
for students.
A master planning initia
tive accompanies the rapid
growth of the school. The
Mitchell Earth Sciences build
ing, which was built in the
19605, is going to be turned
over to Stanford University
from the School of Earth

Sciences.
"[Mitchell] can no longer
support the kind of teaching
and research we do," Matson
said.
The school plans to replace
Mitchell with a new, larger
building designed specifically
for earth sciences. The new
building is still in the early
planning stages; plans and esti
mated construction costs have
yet to be created and submit
ted to the Board of Trustees
for approval.
Once constructed, the new
building which Matson said
will be sustainably constructed
and designed will include
teaching and office space in
addition to computational
facilities.
