## Two donors sue Stanford Blood Center for infections 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Palo Alto resident Christopher
Bui is suing the Stanford Blood
Center because of an infection he
said he acquired after donating
blood on April 10,2008.
Bui is alleging that the
osteomyelitis infection that degrad
ed his collarbone was the result of a
needle stick during the blood dona
tion. Blood Center officials have
said that osteomyelitis is a rare dis
order and that it is not known to be
associated with blood donation.
In a brochure distributed to all
blood donors, the Blood Center tells
donors that it does not assume
financial responsibility for any med
ical care needed to treat symptoms
that follow a blood donation.
Bui said that his pain started
about three weeks after he gave
blood.
He eventually underwent two
surgeries in early May to remove
part of the infected collarbone.
Stanford paid these medical bills,
which Bui estimated at close to $lOO,OOO. However, Bui told ABC
7 that Stanford stopped paying his postoperative bills.
In response to Bui's claims, the Blood Center released a state
ment saying that the center uses single-use needles that come to
Stanford in prepackaged, sterile containers from a manufacturer
with no affiliations with the University, and that the center com
plies with all FDA safety regulations.
Bui is also claiming that the Blood Center misappropriated his
blood, which he said was sold for profit without his consent. Bui
said he thought his blood would only be used to treat infants, due
to his specific rare blood type.
Bui is suing for medical negligence, fraud, misrepresentation
and breach of contract. The jury trial was expected to start Sept. 24
but has since been postposed until April 2013.
A San Jose woman, Brittany Cardenas, is also filing a lawsuit
against Stanford Hospital and Clinics. She claims that she contract
ed an infection after giving blood at a De Anza Community
College blood drive on June 3,2010. The lawyer representing Bui
is also representing Cardenas.
