## NOBEL PURSUIT 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Fourth-year graduate student Andrew Kruse works
in Brian Kobilka's lab, where everyone agrees that
Kobilka, the recent recipient of the Nobel Prize in chem
istry, is one of a kind.
"Brian does a lot of work in lab himself," Kruse said,
who argued that Kobilka stands out from professors of
his caliber because of the time he personally puts into his
lab.
Kobilka and his former postdoctoral advisor, Robert
Lefkowitz, were awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in chem
istry on Oct. 10 for their work on G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) a large family of receptor pro
teins found on the surface of cells. These receptors detect
adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and histamine and then
transmit this signal from one part of the body to anoth
er.
"They're really important targets for existing thera
peutics ... around 40 to 50 percent of current pharma
ceuticals work on G protein-coupled receptors," Kobilka
said. "There is this potential for other G protein-coupled
receptors to be used therapeutically, so they've been tar
gets for drug discovery."
"Brian always says you have to love your molecule,"
said Aashish Manglik, a biophysics graduate student
who has been with Kobilka's lab for two and a half years.
He compared Kobilka to the protein he is famous for:
the adrenaline receptor beta-adrenergic.
"Brian has a low-key personality; I think the beta
adrenergic receptor is more 'come on, let's go.' He's very
driven, but he's not over the top," he said.

A T hat's unique about
y V Brian? Genuine
passion."
