## NOBEL PURSUIT 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Fourth-year graduate student Andrew Kruse works
in Brian Kobilka's lab, where everyone agrees that
Kobilka, the recent recipient of the Nobel Prize in chem
istry, is one of a kind.
"Brian does a lot of work in lab himself," Kruse said,
who argued that Kobilka stands out from professors of
his caliber because of the time he personally puts into his
lab.
Kobilka and his former postdoctoral advisor, Robert
Lefkowitz, were awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in chem
istry on Oct. 10 for their work on G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) a large family of receptor pro
teins found on the surface of cells. These receptors detect
adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and histamine and then
transmit this signal from one part of the body to anoth
er.
"They're really important targets for existing thera
peutics ... around 40 to 50 percent of current pharma
ceuticals work on G protein-coupled receptors," Kobilka
said. "There is this potential for other G protein-coupled
receptors to be used therapeutically, so they've been tar
gets for drug discovery."
"Brian always says you have to love your molecule,"
said Aashish Manglik, a biophysics graduate student
who has been with Kobilka's lab for two and a half years.
He compared Kobilka to the protein he is famous for:
the adrenaline receptor beta-adrenergic.
"Brian has a low-key personality; I think the beta
adrenergic receptor is more 'come on, let's go.' He's very
driven, but he's not over the top," he said.

A T hat's unique about
y V Brian? Genuine
passion."

Kobilka, who currently serves as chair
of the molecular and cellular physiology
department at the School of Medicine, made
his first major contribution to the study of
GPCRs by isolating the gene that codes for
the receptor that responds to adrenaline: the
beta-adrenergic receptor. This find led to the
discovery of the common structural features
of all GPCRs.

The career of the man behind the pro
tein began when he was an undergraduate at
the University of Minnesota-Duluth
(UMD) where he met his wife, Tong Sun
Kobilka (nee Titian), through a shared inter
est in biology.

"We met in my first biology class, basic
intro... she was a year older than I was; she
was upset because the freshmen got the first
pick of the classes," he recalled. The
Kobilkas went on to do research together in
a developmental biology lab at UMD. Tong,
a physician, now researches in Brian's lab
several days a week.

UMD professors Robert Carlson and
Conrad Firling (in whose class Kobilka and
Thian first met) collaborated to set up an
interdisciplinary program, through which
Kobilka went on to receive his Bachelor of
Science degrees in biology and chemistry.
The program was the first of its kind, and
was set up so Kobilka could do interdiscipli
nary research in chemistry and molecular
biology for his honors research project.
Dedicated to his work, Kobilka has other
passions as well.

"He cycled from northern Minnesota to
the Rockies in less than 10 days," remem
bers Firling, Kobilka's first college biology
professor, "and called me collect to tell me
about his trip and that he won our bet."
"I started when I was 14; I went from

Minnesota to Yellowstone with a friend,"
Kobilka, an avid long-distance cyclist, said.
"Nowadays, you wouldn't let a 14-year-old
do something like that."

At 57, Kobilka still bikes to work
through the campus morning traffic. The
Kobilkas' 28-year-old daughter Megan, a
Santa Clara University graduate, plans to
become a high school English teacher. Their
son, Jason, 31, is a Dartmouth graduate who
creates apps for Apple products.
Kobilka went on to get his medical
degree, cum laude, from Yale University
School of Medicine, followed by a residency
in internal medicine at Washington
University School of Medicine. He then
chose to move to research rather than pur
sue a career in cardiology, becoming a
research fellow and eventually an assistant
professor at the Duke University School of
Medicine. It was at Duke as a postdoctoral
student that he isolated the beta-adrenergic
receptor coding-gene.

"I pretty much fell in love with the
process and the people [in the lab]," Kobilka
said. "Clinical medicine was very interesting
yet very different in this respect."

Kobilka wholeheartedly committed to
his postdoctoral fellowship at Duke under
Lefkowitz, who would later become his
longtime collaborator and mentor.
"He had a big impact on my interest in
science," Kobilka said. "My enthusiasm, he
had away of bringing it up. It was a great
experience."

In 1989, Kobilka moved his research to
Stanford.

"Stanford has been a really remarkable
place. I'm not really sure how I managed to
land here but I did," he said in a press con
ference on the morning of Oct. 10. "And I

was telling someone this morning, I think it
was the only place that offered me a job."
To this, Philip Pizzo, dean of the School
of Medicine responded, "Foresight, fore
sight!"

Kobilka pointed out that the size of his
old lab at Duke was much larger than his
current one at the Beckman Center on cam
pus. His old lab hosted between 25 and 30
researchers, whereas his current lab hosts 10.
"At Stanford the groups are smaller, but
what's particularly interesting about
Stanford is that the Medical School campus
and the undergraduate sciences are all
together," he said.

Kobilka made his latest discoveries,
including the breakthrough mapping of
GPCR structures, at Stanford. In 2011, his
team captured an image of this receptor at
the exact moment that it is activated by a
hormone and sends a signal into the cell.

"I remember the very first time we could
see the helices of the receptor," said William
Weis, professor in the School of Medicine
and an early collaborator. "That was the
most exciting time because then we knew
we really had it."

Far from resting on his Nobel Prize,
Kobilka is still looking to pursue the proteins
he studied at Duke in the 1980s. He recently
submitted a research program project grant
"for the support of a broadly based multidis
ciplinary research program."
"We've just submitted a grant to try and
take what we're learning about structures
and develop structure-based approaches for
drug discovery."

ference on the morning of Oct. 10. "And I

was telling someone this morning, I think it
was the only place that offered me a job."
To this, Philip Pizzo, dean of the School
of Medicine responded, "Foresight, fore
sight!"

Kobilka pointed out that the size of his
old lab at Duke was much larger than his
current one at the Beckman Center on cam
pus. His old lab hosted between 25 and 30
researchers, whereas his current lab hosts 10.
"At Stanford the groups are smaller, but
what's particularly interesting about
Stanford is that the Medical School campus
and the undergraduate sciences are all
together," he said.

Kobilka made his latest discoveries,
including the breakthrough mapping of
GPCR structures, at Stanford. In 2011, his
team captured an image of this receptor at
the exact moment that it is activated by a
hormone and sends a signal into the cell.

"I remember the very first time we could
see the helices of the receptor," said William
Weis, professor in the School of Medicine
and an early collaborator. "That was the
most exciting time because then we knew
we really had it."

Far from resting on his Nobel Prize,
Kobilka is still looking to pursue the proteins
he studied at Duke in the 1980s. He recently
submitted a research program project grant
"for the support of a broadly based multidis
ciplinary research program."
"We've just submitted a grant to try and
take what we're learning about structures
and develop structure-based approaches for
drug discovery."

Fourth-year graduate student Andrew Kruse works
in Brian Kobilka's lab, where everyone agrees that
Kobilka, the recent recipient of the Nobel Prize in chem
istry, is one of a kind.
"Brian does a lot of work in lab himself," Kruse said,
who argued that Kobilka stands out from professors of
his caliber because of the time he personally puts into his
lab.
Kobilka and his former postdoctoral advisor, Robert
Lefkowitz, were awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in chem
istry on Oct. 10 for their work on G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) a large family of receptor pro
teins found on the surface of cells. These receptors detect
adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and histamine and then
transmit this signal from one part of the body to anoth
er.
"They're really important targets for existing thera
peutics ... around 40 to 50 percent of current pharma
ceuticals work on G protein-coupled receptors," Kobilka
said. "There is this potential for other G protein-coupled
receptors to be used therapeutically, so they've been tar
gets for drug discovery."
"Brian always says you have to love your molecule,"
said Aashish Manglik, a biophysics graduate student
who has been with Kobilka's lab for two and a half years.
He compared Kobilka to the protein he is famous for:
the adrenaline receptor beta-adrenergic.
"Brian has a low-key personality; I think the beta
adrenergic receptor is more 'come on, let's go.' He's very
driven, but he's not over the top," he said.

A T hat's unique about
y V Brian? Genuine
passion."

Kobilka, who currently serves as chair
of the molecular and cellular physiology
department at the School of Medicine, made
his first major contribution to the study of
GPCRs by isolating the gene that codes for
the receptor that responds to adrenaline: the
beta-adrenergic receptor. This find led to the
discovery of the common structural features
of all GPCRs.

The career of the man behind the pro
tein began when he was an undergraduate at
the University of Minnesota-Duluth
(UMD) where he met his wife, Tong Sun
Kobilka (nee Titian), through a shared inter
est in biology.

"We met in my first biology class, basic
intro... she was a year older than I was; she
was upset because the freshmen got the first
pick of the classes," he recalled. The
Kobilkas went on to do research together in
a developmental biology lab at UMD. Tong,
a physician, now researches in Brian's lab
several days a week.

UMD professors Robert Carlson and
Conrad Firling (in whose class Kobilka and
Thian first met) collaborated to set up an
interdisciplinary program, through which
Kobilka went on to receive his Bachelor of
Science degrees in biology and chemistry.
The program was the first of its kind, and
was set up so Kobilka could do interdiscipli
nary research in chemistry and molecular
biology for his honors research project.
Dedicated to his work, Kobilka has other
passions as well.

"He cycled from northern Minnesota to
the Rockies in less than 10 days," remem
bers Firling, Kobilka's first college biology
professor, "and called me collect to tell me
about his trip and that he won our bet."
"I started when I was 14; I went from

Minnesota to Yellowstone with a friend,"
Kobilka, an avid long-distance cyclist, said.
"Nowadays, you wouldn't let a 14-year-old
do something like that."

At 57, Kobilka still bikes to work
through the campus morning traffic. The
Kobilkas' 28-year-old daughter Megan, a
Santa Clara University graduate, plans to
become a high school English teacher. Their
son, Jason, 31, is a Dartmouth graduate who
creates apps for Apple products.
Kobilka went on to get his medical
degree, cum laude, from Yale University
School of Medicine, followed by a residency
in internal medicine at Washington
University School of Medicine. He then
chose to move to research rather than pur
sue a career in cardiology, becoming a
research fellow and eventually an assistant
professor at the Duke University School of
Medicine. It was at Duke as a postdoctoral
student that he isolated the beta-adrenergic
receptor coding-gene.

"I pretty much fell in love with the
process and the people [in the lab]," Kobilka
said. "Clinical medicine was very interesting
yet very different in this respect."

Kobilka wholeheartedly committed to
his postdoctoral fellowship at Duke under
Lefkowitz, who would later become his
longtime collaborator and mentor.
"He had a big impact on my interest in
science," Kobilka said. "My enthusiasm, he
had away of bringing it up. It was a great
experience."

In 1989, Kobilka moved his research to
Stanford.

"Stanford has been a really remarkable
place. I'm not really sure how I managed to
land here but I did," he said in a press con
ference on the morning of Oct. 10. "And I

was telling someone this morning, I think it
