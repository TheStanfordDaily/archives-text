## Kiva founder recalls beginnings at Stanford 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
Matt Flannery 'OO M.A 'Ol looked at Stanford
Stadium, feeling distraught. Kofi Annan was due to
begin his speech at any moment, yet Flannery and
his friends' graduation euphoria was tainted by the
sting of rejection.
Flannery, now CEO and co-founder of Kiva,
reminisced about the scene wistfully.

"I was living with my roommates in Suites and
we dressed up as Vikings for graduation," he said.
"We actually built this massive ship that was 20 feet
long and we got in it and ... walked across campus
and tried to get it into the stadium.
"Because of the high security we couldn't bring
this massive apparatus inside, and here we are, these
Vikings without a ship," he added. "That's how I felt
after graduating — without any direction."
Flannery, by his own admission, felt purposeless

after Stanford. The structure and rigor of his colle
giate life had suddenly vanished, and the "bubble"
that had insulated his Stanford life had not ade
quately prepared him for a transition into the pro
fessional world. He muddled through various jobs,
ending up at TiVo "running usability experiments,
watching people watch TV."
Flannery was not thrilled with his work, and
what he thought would be "a
real job, a path to a real
career" was instead a daily

exercise in tedium.

Four years into his job,
Flannery and his co-founder,
Jessica Jackley MBA 'O7,
went, as they did once every
few evenings, to Stanford to
watch a talk. The speaker hap
pened to be Muhammad
Yunus, the Nobel Prize-win
ning microfinance pioneer.
The pair was mesmerized, and
Jackley resolved to move to
Africa to invest her life into
the field of microfinance. Matt
had no choice but to follow.

"It was like being hit over
the head with purpose,
because I had a number of
life-changing interactions
there and gave my life a whole
new direction," Flannery said.
The visit allowed the pair to
learn about life in Uganda,
Tanzania and Kenya and gave
them the chance to engage in
simple but meaningful field
research. For Flannery, it was
"a nice distraction from work
ing at TiVo and allowed for a
period of great creativity and
innovation."

However, the creation of
Kiva was much more gradual
than Flannery's gung-ho expe
dition would suggest.
"Jessica stayed in Africa
but the idea stayed with me, so
I would just spend my nights
programming in my apart
ment in San Francisco after
my day job was over," he said.
The nonprofit that was the
fruits of his efforts, now "web
based microcredit platform"
Kiva, was then exclusive to the
individuals and nonprofits
Flannery was in communica
tion with in Uganda. It was "a
very, very captivating hobby,"
he said, but not intended to
become the service it is today.
In December 2005, Kiva
began in earnest. But it was
not out of an overwhelming
dedication to philanthropy
that Matt decided to expand
the nonprofit.
"I was looking for some
kind of significance in life, I
think," he explained. "I think I
have the type of personality
that if I didn't leave my mark .
.. my life would be worth
less."
Despite a sincere desire to
help people, Flannery's cre
ation of Kiva was just as much
about self-realization as the
desire to alleviate poverty.
"I was searching so much
for answers and was really
unsatisfied with the fact that
all I was doing was sitting at a
computer or watching people
watch TV," he said. "I had this

existential angst."
He was sure he wanted to
"start a startup, because that
was a path to meaning."
He kept a journal of startup
ideas, adding a new one every
day. Just one of them was
Kiva, and what distinguished
Kiva from the others was the
connection he felt with the
idea.
"Six weeks on, I was more
excited about it than I had
been initially," he said.
He pursued the idea, for
which he says there were more
detractors than supporters.
Despite that fact, the "idea's
momentum continued to
build" and he "saw himself
doing it."
"[When] you want to do

something even if no one else
cares, that's a good sign," he
said.
Kiva now operates in 66
countries and has delivered
and repaid over $360 million
in loans that provide people
with capital they more than
likely would not have been
able to receive conventionally.
Kiva can boast a repay
ment rate of 99 percent and
has recently launched a serv
ice named Kiva Zip, a project
still in alpha testing. Kiva Zip
removes the intermediaries
that facilitate Kiva loans and
allows Kiva lenders to lend
directly to individuals in
Kenya and the United States
through mobile payments and
PayPal, respectively.
Flannery discussed that he
is prone to emotional swings
that take him from one end of
the spectrum to the other. He
admitted to feeling a depres
sion of sorts in his post-
Stanford wandering and
described the "existential
angst" which compelled him
to search for a life of meaning.
It was this search, however,
that led him to Kiva. Flannery
acknowledges the strange
path he has taken, but one
thing he is sure about now is
that he is happy where he is.

think," he explained. "I think I
have the type of personality
that if I didn't leave my mark .
.. my life would be worth
less."
Despite a sincere desire to
help people, Flannery's cre
ation of Kiva was just as much
about self-realization as the
desire to alleviate poverty.
"I was searching so much
for answers and was really
unsatisfied with the fact that
all I was doing was sitting at a
computer or watching people
watch TV," he said. "I had this

existential angst."
He was sure he wanted to
"start a startup, because that
was a path to meaning."
He kept a journal of startup
ideas, adding a new one every
day. Just one of them was
Kiva, and what distinguished
Kiva from the others was the
connection he felt with the
idea.
"Six weeks on, I was more
excited about it than I had
been initially," he said.
He pursued the idea, for
which he says there were more
detractors than supporters.
Despite that fact, the "idea's
momentum continued to
build" and he "saw himself
doing it."
"[When] you want to do

something even if no one else
cares, that's a good sign," he
said.
Kiva now operates in 66
countries and has delivered
and repaid over $360 million
in loans that provide people
with capital they more than
likely would not have been
able to receive conventionally.
Kiva can boast a repay
ment rate of 99 percent and
has recently launched a serv
ice named Kiva Zip, a project
still in alpha testing. Kiva Zip
removes the intermediaries
that facilitate Kiva loans and
allows Kiva lenders to lend
directly to individuals in
Kenya and the United States
through mobile payments and
PayPal, respectively.
Flannery discussed that he
is prone to emotional swings
that take him from one end of
the spectrum to the other. He
admitted to feeling a depres
sion of sorts in his post-
Stanford wandering and
described the "existential
angst" which compelled him
to search for a life of meaning.
It was this search, however,
that led him to Kiva. Flannery
acknowledges the strange
path he has taken, but one
thing he is sure about now is
that he is happy where he is.

I was looking
for some kind
of significance
in life.

FLANNERY,
Kiva founder
Matt Flannery 'OO M.A 'Ol looked at Stanford
Stadium, feeling distraught. Kofi Annan was due to
begin his speech at any moment, yet Flannery and
his friends' graduation euphoria was tainted by the
sting of rejection.
Flannery, now CEO and co-founder of Kiva,
reminisced about the scene wistfully.

"I was living with my roommates in Suites and
we dressed up as Vikings for graduation," he said.
"We actually built this massive ship that was 20 feet
long and we got in it and ... walked across campus
and tried to get it into the stadium.
"Because of the high security we couldn't bring
this massive apparatus inside, and here we are, these
Vikings without a ship," he added. "That's how I felt
after graduating — without any direction."
Flannery, by his own admission, felt purposeless

after Stanford. The structure and rigor of his colle
giate life had suddenly vanished, and the "bubble"
that had insulated his Stanford life had not ade
quately prepared him for a transition into the pro
fessional world. He muddled through various jobs,
ending up at TiVo "running usability experiments,
watching people watch TV."
Flannery was not thrilled with his work, and
what he thought would be "a
real job, a path to a real
career" was instead a daily

exercise in tedium.

Four years into his job,
Flannery and his co-founder,
Jessica Jackley MBA 'O7,
went, as they did once every
few evenings, to Stanford to
watch a talk. The speaker hap
pened to be Muhammad
Yunus, the Nobel Prize-win
ning microfinance pioneer.
The pair was mesmerized, and
Jackley resolved to move to
Africa to invest her life into
the field of microfinance. Matt
had no choice but to follow.

"It was like being hit over
the head with purpose,
because I had a number of
life-changing interactions
there and gave my life a whole
new direction," Flannery said.
The visit allowed the pair to
learn about life in Uganda,
Tanzania and Kenya and gave
them the chance to engage in
simple but meaningful field
research. For Flannery, it was
"a nice distraction from work
ing at TiVo and allowed for a
period of great creativity and
innovation."

However, the creation of
Kiva was much more gradual
than Flannery's gung-ho expe
dition would suggest.
"Jessica stayed in Africa
but the idea stayed with me, so
I would just spend my nights
programming in my apart
ment in San Francisco after
my day job was over," he said.
The nonprofit that was the
fruits of his efforts, now "web
based microcredit platform"
Kiva, was then exclusive to the
individuals and nonprofits
Flannery was in communica
tion with in Uganda. It was "a
very, very captivating hobby,"
he said, but not intended to
become the service it is today.
In December 2005, Kiva
began in earnest. But it was
not out of an overwhelming
dedication to philanthropy
that Matt decided to expand
the nonprofit.
"I was looking for some
kind of significance in life, I
think," he explained. "I think I
have the type of personality
that if I didn't leave my mark .
.. my life would be worth
