# JUST SHORT
## NO. 5 IRISH TURN BACK STANFORD'S UPSET BID 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On a rainy, chilly Saturday
afternoon in South Bend, Ind., the
Cardinal found out firsthand that
even the sloppiest of games can be
decided by a matter of inches.
Inches and controversy.

Playing in front of a sell
out crowd of 80,795, Stanford (4-2,
2-1 Pac-12) fell just short to Notre
Dame (6-0) in a mistake-filled 20-
13 overtime loss. With the defeat,
the Cardinal remains winless on
the road midway through the reg
ular season.
"It's probably one of the hard
est losses I've felt that and the

Fiesta Bowl are about the same,"
said outside linebacker Chase
Thomas. "Our guys fought really
hard and it felt bad that we could
n't come up with a 'W' today."
The first few possessions of the
game set the tone for the physical,
defensive struggle that was
chalked up for the afternoon. Tight
end Zach Ertz dropped a would
be first down catch one of the
many drive-stalling drops by
Stanford receivers in the game's
soggy conditions that resulted
in a three-and-out on the
Cardinal's opening drive.
Notre Dame's offense didn't
fare well in the early going either.

The Stanford defense rebounded from a tough game against Arizona
last weekend to shut down Notre Dame's attack on Saturday, but the
Cardinal couldn't muster enough offense and lost in overtime, 20-13.
that led to a fumble recovery
by senior nickelback Usua
Amanam.
The Cardinal was handed
great field position on its next
two drives, both of which start
ed around midfield. But given
quarterback Josh Nunes' early
struggles, it hardly seemed to
make a difference.
"We missed a couple
plays," said head coach David
Shaw. "We missed a couple
throws. We got our hands on a
couple catches. We missed
some tough blocks. You know,
[Notre Dame] is stout up front
and we did a decent job of run
ning and blocking most of the
game."
Setting up shop at the
Notre Dame 20, Nunes forced
a pass that fell right into the
hands of cornerback Bennett
Jackson, who now has
snagged four interceptions on
the season. The redshirt jun
ior repeated the same mis
take two drives later when
safety Matthias Farley picked
him off and went 49 yards the
other way to the Stanford 10.
By the end of the first quar
ter, Nunes had more intercep
tions than he did completions
and had passed for a mere 14
yards.
The Cardinal defense made
a critical stand in the red zone,
but the Irish still managed to
capitalize off the turnover with
Kyle Brindza's 29-yard field
goal, which gave them a 3-0
lead heading into the second
quarter.

Thanks to some solid 6- to
8-yard gains on the ground
from running back Stepfan
Taylor, Stanford's next drive
seemed more promising. But
once again it ended with no
points, as Jordan Williamson's
25-yard field goal attempt was
partially blocked.
For its second straight road
game, the Cardinal offense
failed to find the end zone. The
team's only touchdown came
when defensive end Ben

Gardner forced a Golson fum
ble in the Irish end zone that
Thomas immediately landed
on to give Stanford a 7-3 lead
halfway through the second
quarter. Golson's mobility
both within and outside the
pocket had saved him from a
couple sacks earlier, but
Gardner flew by the offensive
line on the third-and-16 play to
force the touchdown-scoring
turnover.

"We did a good job all night
on defense," Nunes said. "We
had a lot of opportunities out
there [on offense]. I think we
left them on the field though."

The Irish had the chance to
cut into the Cardinal's lead on
its next possession with a short
field goal, but the snap sailed
over the head of holder Ben
Turk and Brindza was unable
to get an attempt off.

Nunes looked more com
fortable than he did all game
when he orchestrated an 11-
play, 61-yard drive that
moved the ball down to the
Irish 30. Using the hurry-up,
he managed to complete 5-of
-6 passes for 41 yards during
the possession. His efficient
clock management allowed
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal as time expired in
the first half, giving Stanford a
10-3 lead as the teams headed
into the locker rooms.

The third quarter proved to
be a display of sheer defensive
dominance. Even when
Golson extended the Irish pos
session with his scrambling
abilities, his recklessness in not
protecting the ball caught up
to him. On first-and-15 at the
Stanford 37, Notre Dame
seemed poised to walk away
with at least three points
before cornerback Alex Carter
stripped the ball out of
Golson's hands and Gardner
came up with the fumble
recovery.

"It was a physical game,"
Carter said. "Both teams needed
a win and both teams played

hard. We've got to regroup and
just keep playing our game."

But the Cardinal offense
sputtered even more all
three of its drives in the third
quarter ended up being fruit
less three-and-outs. Nunes
underthrew a couple passes,
Taylor had a drop and Irish
inside linebacker Manti Te'o,
who recorded 11 tackles on the
afternoon, made his presence
known by exploding into the
backfield.

"Third quarter, [Notre
Dame] snuck in there and got
some hands, got some runs
through by the linebackers,"
said Shaw. "Their defensive
line got some penetration on
us, but still there were plays
for us to be made there."

After the Irish opened up
the fourth quarter with a field
goal to tie the game at 10
apiece, Taylor carried the
offense on his shoulders by
fighting for every yard when
he touched the ball.

"He's a tough kid," said
Shaw. "He just keeps his legs
turning. He gets as many yards
as he can on every single play.
Every single play to him, he
runs it like it's life or death. I
love that about him. He's one
of the guys that is the heart
beat of the team."
The Cardinal drove all the
way down to the Notre Dame
3 before a whistle from the
stands on a third-and-2, as
confirmed by Shaw, caused
Taylor to stop running and
end up losing 7 yards on the
play. Stanford then had to set
tle for a Williamson field goal
that gave it a 13-10 lead.

Notre Dame was able to tie
the game on its next possession
in the waning moments of the
fourth quarter. Midway
through the drive, backup quar
terback Tommy Rees stepped
in for Golson, who had to leave
the game after receiving a big
hit from Amanam.

Later in the same drive, the
officials called a questionable

defensive pass interference on
Terrence Brown for not play
ing the ball on third-and-4 at
the Stanford 28, although the
replay showed that Brown did
in fact turn around to look for
the ball.

"There's nothing I can do
about it," said Shaw. "I'm not
going to comment on the offi
cials."

After getting sacked by
outside linebacker Trent
Murphy on the first play in
overtime, Rees coolly rattled
off three consecutive comple
tions, the last of which was a 7-
yard touchdown to wideout
T.J. Jones.

Needing a touchdown to
stay alive, the Cardinal didn't
get off to an auspicious start
when Nunes' screen pass to
Taylor fooled nobody and
resulted in a loss of 5.
However, Nunes had his
weekly clutch run by scram
bling for 13 yards on the next

play, and another 13-yard rush
from Taylor put Stanford at
first-and-goal at the Notre
Dame 4.

But the Cardinal just
couldn't punch it in. Or at least
the officials didn't seem to
think so.

On third-and-goal at the Irish
1, the tip of the ball seemed to
have crossed the plane during
Taylor's carry, but the officials
ruled him just short.
That brought up fourth
and-inches, and the Cardinal
had one last chance to send
the game into double over
time. The Irish defense stuffed
Taylor at first, but the senior
running back spun around to
extend the ball into the end
zone.

Once again, the officials
ruled him just short.
A side-view replay seemed
to show that it was a touch
down, but the officials con
firmed the initial ruling and

Notre Dame clinched its 20-13
overtime victory over the
Cardinal.

"I thought [Taylor] got in
on the play before that," said
Nunes. "The game was made
up of a bunch of plays, a bunch
of close plays."
Though perhaps robbed of
the chance to extend
Saturday's game to double
overtime, the Cardinal will
need to regroup quickly as it
prepares to face rival Cal this
weekend.

"It's tough, but I know we
have a real resilient group and
a good group of guys, leaders
and seniors," said Nunes.
"We'll bounce back from it."

Stanford will square off
against Cal in the 115 th Big
Game this Saturday at the
newly renovated California
Memorial Stadium.

The Stanford defense rebounded from a tough game against Arizona
last weekend to shut down Notre Dame's attack on Saturday, but the
Cardinal couldn't muster enough offense and lost in overtime, 20-13.
that led to a fumble recovery
by senior nickelback Usua
Amanam.
The Cardinal was handed
great field position on its next
two drives, both of which start
ed around midfield. But given
quarterback Josh Nunes' early
struggles, it hardly seemed to
make a difference.
"We missed a couple
plays," said head coach David
Shaw. "We missed a couple
throws. We got our hands on a
couple catches. We missed
some tough blocks. You know,
[Notre Dame] is stout up front
and we did a decent job of run
ning and blocking most of the
game."
Setting up shop at the
Notre Dame 20, Nunes forced
a pass that fell right into the
hands of cornerback Bennett
Jackson, who now has
snagged four interceptions on
the season. The redshirt jun
ior repeated the same mis
take two drives later when
safety Matthias Farley picked
him off and went 49 yards the
other way to the Stanford 10.
By the end of the first quar
ter, Nunes had more intercep
tions than he did completions
and had passed for a mere 14
yards.
The Cardinal defense made
a critical stand in the red zone,
but the Irish still managed to
capitalize off the turnover with
Kyle Brindza's 29-yard field
goal, which gave them a 3-0
lead heading into the second
quarter.

Thanks to some solid 6- to
8-yard gains on the ground
from running back Stepfan
Taylor, Stanford's next drive
seemed more promising. But
once again it ended with no
points, as Jordan Williamson's
25-yard field goal attempt was
partially blocked.
For its second straight road
game, the Cardinal offense
failed to find the end zone. The
team's only touchdown came
when defensive end Ben

Gardner forced a Golson fum
ble in the Irish end zone that
Thomas immediately landed
on to give Stanford a 7-3 lead
halfway through the second
quarter. Golson's mobility
both within and outside the
pocket had saved him from a
couple sacks earlier, but
Gardner flew by the offensive
line on the third-and-16 play to
force the touchdown-scoring
turnover.

"We did a good job all night
on defense," Nunes said. "We
had a lot of opportunities out
there [on offense]. I think we
left them on the field though."

The Irish had the chance to
cut into the Cardinal's lead on
its next possession with a short
field goal, but the snap sailed
over the head of holder Ben
Turk and Brindza was unable
to get an attempt off.

Nunes looked more com
fortable than he did all game
when he orchestrated an 11-
play, 61-yard drive that
moved the ball down to the
Irish 30. Using the hurry-up,
he managed to complete 5-of
-6 passes for 41 yards during
the possession. His efficient
clock management allowed
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal as time expired in
the first half, giving Stanford a
10-3 lead as the teams headed
into the locker rooms.

The third quarter proved to
be a display of sheer defensive
dominance. Even when
Golson extended the Irish pos
session with his scrambling
abilities, his recklessness in not
protecting the ball caught up
to him. On first-and-15 at the
Stanford 37, Notre Dame
seemed poised to walk away
with at least three points
before cornerback Alex Carter
stripped the ball out of
Golson's hands and Gardner
came up with the fumble
recovery.

"It was a physical game,"
Carter said. "Both teams needed
a win and both teams played

hard. We've got to regroup and
just keep playing our game."

But the Cardinal offense
sputtered even more all
three of its drives in the third
quarter ended up being fruit
less three-and-outs. Nunes
underthrew a couple passes,
Taylor had a drop and Irish
inside linebacker Manti Te'o,
who recorded 11 tackles on the
afternoon, made his presence
known by exploding into the
backfield.

"Third quarter, [Notre
Dame] snuck in there and got
some hands, got some runs
through by the linebackers,"
said Shaw. "Their defensive
line got some penetration on
us, but still there were plays
for us to be made there."

After the Irish opened up
the fourth quarter with a field
goal to tie the game at 10
apiece, Taylor carried the
offense on his shoulders by
fighting for every yard when
he touched the ball.

"He's a tough kid," said
Shaw. "He just keeps his legs
turning. He gets as many yards
as he can on every single play.
Every single play to him, he
runs it like it's life or death. I
love that about him. He's one
of the guys that is the heart
beat of the team."
The Cardinal drove all the
way down to the Notre Dame
3 before a whistle from the
stands on a third-and-2, as
confirmed by Shaw, caused
Taylor to stop running and
end up losing 7 yards on the
play. Stanford then had to set
tle for a Williamson field goal
that gave it a 13-10 lead.

Notre Dame was able to tie
the game on its next possession
in the waning moments of the
fourth quarter. Midway
through the drive, backup quar
terback Tommy Rees stepped
in for Golson, who had to leave
the game after receiving a big
hit from Amanam.

Later in the same drive, the
officials called a questionable

defensive pass interference on
Terrence Brown for not play
ing the ball on third-and-4 at
the Stanford 28, although the
replay showed that Brown did
in fact turn around to look for
the ball.

"There's nothing I can do
about it," said Shaw. "I'm not
going to comment on the offi
cials."

After getting sacked by
outside linebacker Trent
Murphy on the first play in
overtime, Rees coolly rattled
off three consecutive comple
tions, the last of which was a 7-
yard touchdown to wideout
T.J. Jones.

Needing a touchdown to
stay alive, the Cardinal didn't
get off to an auspicious start
when Nunes' screen pass to
Taylor fooled nobody and
resulted in a loss of 5.
However, Nunes had his
weekly clutch run by scram
bling for 13 yards on the next

play, and another 13-yard rush
from Taylor put Stanford at
first-and-goal at the Notre
Dame 4.

But the Cardinal just
couldn't punch it in. Or at least
the officials didn't seem to
think so.

On third-and-goal at the Irish
1, the tip of the ball seemed to
have crossed the plane during
Taylor's carry, but the officials
ruled him just short.
That brought up fourth
and-inches, and the Cardinal
had one last chance to send
the game into double over
time. The Irish defense stuffed
Taylor at first, but the senior
running back spun around to
extend the ball into the end
zone.

Once again, the officials
ruled him just short.
A side-view replay seemed
to show that it was a touch
down, but the officials con
firmed the initial ruling and

Notre Dame clinched its 20-13
overtime victory over the
Cardinal.

"I thought [Taylor] got in
on the play before that," said
Nunes. "The game was made
up of a bunch of plays, a bunch
of close plays."
Though perhaps robbed of
the chance to extend
Saturday's game to double
overtime, the Cardinal will
need to regroup quickly as it
prepares to face rival Cal this
weekend.

"It's tough, but I know we
have a real resilient group and
a good group of guys, leaders
and seniors," said Nunes.
"We'll bounce back from it."

Stanford will square off
against Cal in the 115 th Big
Game this Saturday at the
newly renovated California
Memorial Stadium.

Redshirt sophomore Jordan Williamson (19) hit two field goals Saturday against the Irish,

The Stanford defense rebounded from a tough game against Arizona
last weekend to shut down Notre Dame's attack on Saturday, but the
Cardinal couldn't muster enough offense and lost in overtime, 20-13.
that led to a fumble recovery
by senior nickelback Usua
Amanam.
The Cardinal was handed
great field position on its next
two drives, both of which start
ed around midfield. But given
quarterback Josh Nunes' early
struggles, it hardly seemed to
make a difference.
"We missed a couple
plays," said head coach David
Shaw. "We missed a couple
throws. We got our hands on a
couple catches. We missed
some tough blocks. You know,
[Notre Dame] is stout up front
and we did a decent job of run
ning and blocking most of the
game."
Setting up shop at the
Notre Dame 20, Nunes forced
a pass that fell right into the
hands of cornerback Bennett
Jackson, who now has
snagged four interceptions on
the season. The redshirt jun
ior repeated the same mis
take two drives later when
safety Matthias Farley picked
him off and went 49 yards the
other way to the Stanford 10.
By the end of the first quar
ter, Nunes had more intercep
tions than he did completions
and had passed for a mere 14
yards.
The Cardinal defense made
a critical stand in the red zone,
but the Irish still managed to
capitalize off the turnover with
Kyle Brindza's 29-yard field
goal, which gave them a 3-0
lead heading into the second
quarter.

Thanks to some solid 6- to
8-yard gains on the ground
from running back Stepfan
Taylor, Stanford's next drive
seemed more promising. But
once again it ended with no
points, as Jordan Williamson's
25-yard field goal attempt was
partially blocked.
For its second straight road
game, the Cardinal offense
failed to find the end zone. The
team's only touchdown came
when defensive end Ben

Gardner forced a Golson fum
ble in the Irish end zone that
Thomas immediately landed
on to give Stanford a 7-3 lead
halfway through the second
quarter. Golson's mobility
both within and outside the
pocket had saved him from a
couple sacks earlier, but
Gardner flew by the offensive
line on the third-and-16 play to
force the touchdown-scoring
turnover.

"We did a good job all night
on defense," Nunes said. "We
had a lot of opportunities out
there [on offense]. I think we
left them on the field though."

The Irish had the chance to
cut into the Cardinal's lead on
its next possession with a short
field goal, but the snap sailed
over the head of holder Ben
Turk and Brindza was unable
to get an attempt off.

Nunes looked more com
fortable than he did all game
when he orchestrated an 11-
play, 61-yard drive that
moved the ball down to the
Irish 30. Using the hurry-up,
he managed to complete 5-of
-6 passes for 41 yards during
the possession. His efficient
clock management allowed
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal as time expired in
the first half, giving Stanford a
10-3 lead as the teams headed
into the locker rooms.

The third quarter proved to
be a display of sheer defensive
dominance. Even when
Golson extended the Irish pos
session with his scrambling
abilities, his recklessness in not
protecting the ball caught up
to him. On first-and-15 at the
Stanford 37, Notre Dame
seemed poised to walk away
with at least three points
before cornerback Alex Carter
stripped the ball out of
Golson's hands and Gardner
came up with the fumble
recovery.

"It was a physical game,"
Carter said. "Both teams needed
a win and both teams played

hard. We've got to regroup and
just keep playing our game."

But the Cardinal offense
sputtered even more all
three of its drives in the third
quarter ended up being fruit
less three-and-outs. Nunes
underthrew a couple passes,
Taylor had a drop and Irish
inside linebacker Manti Te'o,
who recorded 11 tackles on the
afternoon, made his presence
known by exploding into the
backfield.

"Third quarter, [Notre
Dame] snuck in there and got
some hands, got some runs
through by the linebackers,"
said Shaw. "Their defensive
line got some penetration on
us, but still there were plays
for us to be made there."

After the Irish opened up
the fourth quarter with a field
goal to tie the game at 10
apiece, Taylor carried the
offense on his shoulders by
fighting for every yard when
he touched the ball.

"He's a tough kid," said
Shaw. "He just keeps his legs
turning. He gets as many yards
as he can on every single play.
Every single play to him, he
runs it like it's life or death. I
love that about him. He's one
of the guys that is the heart
beat of the team."
The Cardinal drove all the
way down to the Notre Dame
3 before a whistle from the
stands on a third-and-2, as
confirmed by Shaw, caused
Taylor to stop running and
end up losing 7 yards on the
play. Stanford then had to set
tle for a Williamson field goal
that gave it a 13-10 lead.

Notre Dame was able to tie
the game on its next possession
in the waning moments of the
fourth quarter. Midway
through the drive, backup quar
terback Tommy Rees stepped
in for Golson, who had to leave
the game after receiving a big
hit from Amanam.

Later in the same drive, the
officials called a questionable

defensive pass interference on
Terrence Brown for not play
ing the ball on third-and-4 at
the Stanford 28, although the
replay showed that Brown did
in fact turn around to look for
the ball.

"There's nothing I can do
about it," said Shaw. "I'm not
going to comment on the offi
cials."

After getting sacked by
outside linebacker Trent
Murphy on the first play in
overtime, Rees coolly rattled
off three consecutive comple
tions, the last of which was a 7-
yard touchdown to wideout
T.J. Jones.

Needing a touchdown to
stay alive, the Cardinal didn't
get off to an auspicious start
when Nunes' screen pass to
Taylor fooled nobody and
resulted in a loss of 5.
However, Nunes had his
weekly clutch run by scram
bling for 13 yards on the next

play, and another 13-yard rush
from Taylor put Stanford at
first-and-goal at the Notre
Dame 4.

But the Cardinal just
couldn't punch it in. Or at least
the officials didn't seem to
think so.

On third-and-goal at the Irish
1, the tip of the ball seemed to
have crossed the plane during
Taylor's carry, but the officials
ruled him just short.
That brought up fourth
and-inches, and the Cardinal
had one last chance to send
the game into double over
time. The Irish defense stuffed
Taylor at first, but the senior
running back spun around to
extend the ball into the end
zone.

Once again, the officials
ruled him just short.
A side-view replay seemed
to show that it was a touch
down, but the officials con
firmed the initial ruling and

Notre Dame clinched its 20-13
overtime victory over the
Cardinal.

"I thought [Taylor] got in
on the play before that," said
Nunes. "The game was made
up of a bunch of plays, a bunch
of close plays."
Though perhaps robbed of
the chance to extend
Saturday's game to double
overtime, the Cardinal will
need to regroup quickly as it
prepares to face rival Cal this
weekend.

"It's tough, but I know we
have a real resilient group and
a good group of guys, leaders
and seniors," said Nunes.
"We'll bounce back from it."

Stanford will square off
against Cal in the 115 th Big
Game this Saturday at the
newly renovated California
Memorial Stadium.

Redshirt sophomore Jordan Williamson (19) hit two field goals Saturday against the Irish,
including a career-long 48-yarder, but also had a kick blocked in the wet conditions.
On a rainy, chilly Saturday
afternoon in South Bend, Ind., the
Cardinal found out firsthand that
even the sloppiest of games can be
decided by a matter of inches.
Inches and controversy.

Playing in front of a sell
out crowd of 80,795, Stanford (4-2,
2-1 Pac-12) fell just short to Notre
Dame (6-0) in a mistake-filled 20-
13 overtime loss. With the defeat,
the Cardinal remains winless on
the road midway through the reg
ular season.
"It's probably one of the hard
est losses I've felt that and the

Fiesta Bowl are about the same,"
said outside linebacker Chase
Thomas. "Our guys fought really
hard and it felt bad that we could
n't come up with a 'W' today."
The first few possessions of the
game set the tone for the physical,
defensive struggle that was
chalked up for the afternoon. Tight
end Zach Ertz dropped a would
be first down catch one of the
many drive-stalling drops by
Stanford receivers in the game's
soggy conditions that resulted
in a three-and-out on the
Cardinal's opening drive.
Notre Dame's offense didn't
fare well in the early going either.

Everett Golson marched the Irish
into Cardinal territory on their
first possession, only to mishandle
the ball on a second-and-10 snap
