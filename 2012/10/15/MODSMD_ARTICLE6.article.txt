# JUST SHORT
## NO. 5 IRISH TURN BACK STANFORD'S UPSET BID 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On a rainy, chilly Saturday
afternoon in South Bend, Ind., the
Cardinal found out firsthand that
even the sloppiest of games can be
decided by a matter of inches.
Inches and controversy.

Playing in front of a sell
out crowd of 80,795, Stanford (4-2,
2-1 Pac-12) fell just short to Notre
Dame (6-0) in a mistake-filled 20-
13 overtime loss. With the defeat,
the Cardinal remains winless on
the road midway through the reg
ular season.
"It's probably one of the hard
est losses I've felt that and the

Fiesta Bowl are about the same,"
said outside linebacker Chase
Thomas. "Our guys fought really
hard and it felt bad that we could
n't come up with a 'W' today."
The first few possessions of the
game set the tone for the physical,
defensive struggle that was
chalked up for the afternoon. Tight
end Zach Ertz dropped a would
be first down catch one of the
many drive-stalling drops by
Stanford receivers in the game's
soggy conditions that resulted
in a three-and-out on the
Cardinal's opening drive.
Notre Dame's offense didn't
fare well in the early going either.

The Stanford defense rebounded from a tough game against Arizona
last weekend to shut down Notre Dame's attack on Saturday, but the
Cardinal couldn't muster enough offense and lost in overtime, 20-13.
