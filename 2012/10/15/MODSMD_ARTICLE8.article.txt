## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
Fifty percent of young women did not resume using condoms
after they stopped taking hormonal contraception pills, according
to a study conducted by Stanford Medical School researchers.
The trial followed 1,194 sexually active young women who went
to Planned Parenthood clinics with the intent of beginning a con
traceptive routine with hormonal pills, inj ections, patches or vaginal
rings. None of the subjects were planning to become pregnant with
in a year of starting to use contraceptive measures.
At the beginning of the trial, 36 percent of the young women, ages
15 to 24, reported using condoms on a regular basis. Within three
months of starting to use contraceptive pills, condom usage had gone
down to 27 percent. Over the course of the trial, some of the women
decided to stop taking hormonal contraception pills, 50 percent of
whom did not go back to the original rate of condom usage.
Lead researcher Rachel Goldstein, a pediatric resident at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, said that the most influential
factor in condom use is what the woman's sexual partner thinks
about condoms.
Young women in the study who reported that their partner
thought condom use was "very important" or did not know what
their partner thought were more likely to use condoms than sub
jects who thought that their partner saw condoms as "not at all
important."
The study was published in in the Journal of Adolescent He alth
online on Oct. 12. Research collaborators include doctors at the
University of California-San Francisco.
