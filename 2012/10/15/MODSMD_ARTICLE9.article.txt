## THE 						TOP FIVE REALITY TV SHOWS TO BRING TO STANFORD 
### 
If Baudrillard's got you juicing
for some hyperreal and the
"Real World" just isn't doing
it for you, this list of 5 reality
shows that should be shot at
Stanford will whet your appetite
for Stanford's non-sports tube
debut. Stay tuned for casting calls.
■ REAL HOUSEWIVES OF THE FARM.
The married-students residences may not be that full,
but we hear that at Stanford, you either casually hook
up or date all four years, and we even once heard 90
percent of Stanfordians marry other Stanfordians.
Grab a couple cameras and bottles of wine and lets see
if these Farm-fresh lovers can get the drama up
enough to topple tables.

■ KEEPING UP WITH THE KAPPA
SIGS
A peek inside the private lives of one of Stanford's
most controversial brotherhoods. The Kappa Sigs
might not be famous for a sex tape (or they might be)
but we're betting there's a Khloe or two among them
to keep us laughing once the lights come up after the
all-campus ragers. Society may think of them as well
dressed socialites, but we know they're family men just
looking for love between classes and photo shoots.
Also, one was on Rich Kids of Instagram.
■ BREAKING AMISH
Our newest guilty pleasure drinking game is coming
to Stanford, minus the Amish plus freshmen. They
may look calm and reserved, but buried underneath
that Class of 2016 lanyard is a flaming rebellion only
18 years of rigorous academic focus can stoke. Some
will make it to the city (all-campuses), others will be
shunned and a lucky few will end their prematurely
serious relationships. But will the RAs let them back
on the compound?

■ STANFORD PICKERS
There are hidden treasures scattered on this campus.
Beneath the Amazon boxes and behind the IKEA
futons, we're sure Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz could
root up some real gems. But that's not what we want
to see! We'd watch this Stanfordized reality TV for the
juicy knickknacks and bizarre gewgaws that have been
wont to turn up in everywhere from freshman dorms
to grad student housing. Intermission staffers have
stumbled upon cotton candy machines, bathtubs full
of energy "drink" and even five-person hammocks.
Okay, maybe more "Room Raiders" than "Pickers," but
minus the black light.
■ COPS/TREE GUARDS
Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha
gonna do when you roll that stop sign without a bike
light and they run for you? This hard-hitting docu
drama expose follows the tree-patch-wearing security
guards ("cops") who keep the peace by loitering at
stop signs and setting up barricades at all-campuses.
Watch as they patrol for open containers and counter
feit SUIDs at football games. (What would resident
"Cops" scholar Fred Turner say?)
