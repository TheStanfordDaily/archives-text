# Naming names and taking numbers
## 
### Emily Cohodes 
In my last two columns on mental
health, I've been rather vague in
my references to mental health
resources on campus. I want to take
this opportunity to outline what's
available to Stanford students to sup
port you and give you the tools you
need to thrive.
Don't write this list off! Chances
are, at some point, you or someone
you know will benefit from the incred
ible safety net that hundreds of staff,
students and administrators work to
put in place for you. Educating your
self about what's available will prepare
you to help yourself when you are in
need or give you the knowledge to
help a friend in need. This list of
resources, which will be presented in
two parts, is a good one to know and
love. Today, I'll be profiling the two
services that I've come to view as the
nuts and bolts of our help system and
next week, I'll describe more specific
offerings.
The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center:
What it is: The Bridge, the oldest
peer counseling center in the country,
is located in Rogers House, not far
from Tresidder (check a map). It
offers anonymous and free peer
counseling to the Stanford communi
ty and public. All staffers complete
two quarters of training and are avail
able to talk about anything from
roommate conflicts to academic
stress to relationship issues to sadness
you name it, we'll listen!
How to use it: Walk into the house
and look for the staffer in the first
room on your left from 9 a.m. to 11
p.m. or call 24/7 at 650-723-3392.
The secret to success: I urge you not
to view the Bridge as a last resort or as
a place to go only if all hell is breaking
loose (i.e. you have three midterms in
the morning, just broke up with some
one and haven't slept in four days
although we're here for you then, too).
Instead, I'd encourage you to view the
Bridge as just that: a bridge that can
help you get to the resources you
need. Call the Bridge to de-stress
before a big job interview, to discuss a
weird encounter at a party last night
that has your mind wandering, or to
talk about your next PWR paper.
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS):
What it is: Every Stanford student,
whether you have Cardinal Care or
private health insurance, gets the
equivalent of one free counseling ses
sion per week from highly trained

counselors at CAPS, located on the
second floor of Vaden. Counselors
come from a variety of backgrounds
and you can choose to talk to someone
who specializes in body image issues,
LGBTQ issues or depression, just to
name a few. CAPS also offers student
grief and bereavement workshops, all
gender multicultural body image
groups, and couples counseling.
How to use it: While making an
appointment online at
vadenpatient.stanford.edu, select
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), and then click on "CAPS
Phone Screening Appointment" if it's
your first time. Don't be scared away
by this quick, one-time screening pro
cedure that involves a 15-minute
phone conversation with a counselor.
You can also make an appointment
online by calling 650-723-3785. If you
don't feel like you mesh with the first
counselor you meet, schedule an
appointment with a different coun
selor. CAPS lets you "shop around"
until you find someone you're perfect
ly comfortable with. For urgent situa
tions, call 650-723-3785, and the clini
cian on call will get back to you within
20 minutes.

Helpful hints: There seems to be a
popular belief at Stanford that going
to CAPS is a synonym for becoming
an inpatient at the nearest psychiatric
ward. Whenever I mention that
CAPS is a great resource for talking
out issues to a counselee on the
phone during one of my Bridge
shifts, the phone goes quiet. While the
stigma surrounding "going to coun
seling" may not be that bad here at
Stanford, I often find myself wonder
ing why I don't see a line of students
flooding into the Cowell Cluster
parking lot as they await their week
ly counseling sessions.

Let's take a page out of
Argentina's playbook, where it's con
sidered hip to see a counselor once or
even twice a week, and get what
we're paying for! Give me one good
reason not to go talk to a friendly,
highly trained person about your life
and get help managing stress, rela
tionships or even your to-do list and
I'll let you off the hook. Once you've
left the Stanford bubble, these sessions
will cost you upwards of $l5O/hour, so
why not take advantage of the oppor
tunity while it's FREE?

Seriously, email Emily one good
reason anytime at ecohodes@stan
ford.edu.

although we're here for you then, too).
Instead, I'd encourage you to view the
Bridge as just that: a bridge that can
help you get to the resources you
need. Call the Bridge to de-stress
before a big job interview, to discuss a
weird encounter at a party last night
that has your mind wandering, or to
talk about your next PWR paper.
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS):
What it is: Every Stanford student,
whether you have Cardinal Care or
private health insurance, gets the
equivalent of one free counseling ses
sion per week from highly trained

counselors at CAPS, located on the
second floor of Vaden. Counselors
come from a variety of backgrounds
and you can choose to talk to someone
who specializes in body image issues,
LGBTQ issues or depression, just to
name a few. CAPS also offers student
grief and bereavement workshops, all
gender multicultural body image
groups, and couples counseling.
How to use it: While making an
appointment online at
vadenpatient.stanford.edu, select
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), and then click on "CAPS
Phone Screening Appointment" if it's
your first time. Don't be scared away
by this quick, one-time screening pro
cedure that involves a 15-minute
phone conversation with a counselor.
You can also make an appointment
online by calling 650-723-3785. If you
don't feel like you mesh with the first
counselor you meet, schedule an
appointment with a different coun
selor. CAPS lets you "shop around"
until you find someone you're perfect
ly comfortable with. For urgent situa
tions, call 650-723-3785, and the clini
cian on call will get back to you within
20 minutes.

Helpful hints: There seems to be a
popular belief at Stanford that going
to CAPS is a synonym for becoming
an inpatient at the nearest psychiatric
ward. Whenever I mention that
CAPS is a great resource for talking
out issues to a counselee on the
phone during one of my Bridge
shifts, the phone goes quiet. While the
stigma surrounding "going to coun
seling" may not be that bad here at
Stanford, I often find myself wonder
ing why I don't see a line of students
flooding into the Cowell Cluster
parking lot as they await their week
ly counseling sessions.

Let's take a page out of
Argentina's playbook, where it's con
sidered hip to see a counselor once or
even twice a week, and get what
we're paying for! Give me one good
reason not to go talk to a friendly,
highly trained person about your life
and get help managing stress, rela
tionships or even your to-do list and
I'll let you off the hook. Once you've
left the Stanford bubble, these sessions
will cost you upwards of $l5O/hour, so
why not take advantage of the oppor
tunity while it's FREE?

Seriously, email Emily one good
reason anytime at ecohodes@stan
ford.edu.
In my last two columns on mental
health, I've been rather vague in
my references to mental health
resources on campus. I want to take
this opportunity to outline what's
available to Stanford students to sup
port you and give you the tools you
need to thrive.
Don't write this list off! Chances
are, at some point, you or someone
you know will benefit from the incred
ible safety net that hundreds of staff,
students and administrators work to
put in place for you. Educating your
self about what's available will prepare
you to help yourself when you are in
need or give you the knowledge to
help a friend in need. This list of
resources, which will be presented in
two parts, is a good one to know and
love. Today, I'll be profiling the two
services that I've come to view as the
nuts and bolts of our help system and
next week, I'll describe more specific
offerings.
The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center:
What it is: The Bridge, the oldest
peer counseling center in the country,
is located in Rogers House, not far
from Tresidder (check a map). It
offers anonymous and free peer
counseling to the Stanford communi
ty and public. All staffers complete
two quarters of training and are avail
able to talk about anything from
roommate conflicts to academic
stress to relationship issues to sadness
you name it, we'll listen!
How to use it: Walk into the house
and look for the staffer in the first
room on your left from 9 a.m. to 11
p.m. or call 24/7 at 650-723-3392.
The secret to success: I urge you not
to view the Bridge as a last resort or as
a place to go only if all hell is breaking
loose (i.e. you have three midterms in
the morning, just broke up with some
one and haven't slept in four days
although we're here for you then, too).
Instead, I'd encourage you to view the
Bridge as just that: a bridge that can
help you get to the resources you
need. Call the Bridge to de-stress
before a big job interview, to discuss a
weird encounter at a party last night
that has your mind wandering, or to
talk about your next PWR paper.
