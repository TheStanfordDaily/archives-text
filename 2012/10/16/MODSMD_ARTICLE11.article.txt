She is unconscious right now and on ventila
tors. She was shot, twice. The bullets that hit
her have been removed from her body. But
she is still a long way from recovery and until
then, she needs the prayers of everyone.
Malala Yusufzai is a young activist from
Swat Valley, Pakistan. She is 14 years old and has
done something very few people in Pakistan
have been able to do: stand up to the Taliban.
She rose to fame in 2009 when the Taliban insur
gency in the Swat Valley was at its peak by writ
ing a blog for the BBC chronicling her struggle
of going to school and getting an education. She
was later featured in the New York Times docu

mentary "Class Dismissed," and has since sym
bolized the struggle for female education in
Pakistan.

Malala's defiance set her apart from the very
beginning. She stood up for education when no
one dared to confront the Taliban long
before the Pakistani military made up its mind
to take them on.

Malala had already made up hers. Her
school was closed down after bomb threats by
the Taliban, who had by then destroyed dozen of
schools for girls in Swat. She knew who the ene
mies of her ambitions were, and she was not
scared to take a stand against them.
Malala's life, and her family's, remained
under constant threat at this time. Along with
her father, she remained on the hit list of the
Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the militant group
that had already overturned the state apparatus
in the valley. But she did not back down. When

the politicians did, when the military refused to
stand with the people, Malala spoke not just
for herself, but for the people of Swat.

It was her voice, and the voices of others
like her, that finally convinced the Pakistani
state to take on the Taliban in June 2009. After
a long and drawn-out military operation, Swat
Valley was rid of militant fundamentalism.
Malala and her friends were able to go to
school again.

But this was not the end of the road for
Malala. While Swat was no longer under the de
facto control of the Taliban, the militants man
aged to survive in deep pockets of resistance.
Malala knew this, and recognized the threat
their survival posed, ft was for that very reason
that she continued to remind the powers that be
that peace in Swat was endangered by a patho
logical mindset of hate and violence. The
Taliban were never too happy with her.

On Oct 9,2012, when Malala was returning
from school near the town of Mingora in Swat,
two armed gunmen stopped her school van.
They first identified Malala and then fired at
her.
Malala is battling for life in a hospital in
Birmingham, UK, where she was evacuated for
specialized care. I got a chance to know her
when she participated in a Stanford student-led
initiative for the schoolgirls of the Swat Valley in
2009, where I was a volunteer. Knowing her, she
will fight on. My prayers are with her and her
family in this hour.
I hope for the sake of all that she stands for
education, female empowerment, defiance
against hate and violence and, most of all,
Pakistan that she recovers quickly and has
the chance to realize her many dreams.
