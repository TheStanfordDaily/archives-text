## BADGERS BITTEN STANFORD SPRINGS UPSET AT WISCONSIN INVITE 
### NICOLAS SHUMP 
Stanford's cross country teams went into
Madison on Friday with high hopes for one of the
largest meets of the season, the Wisconsin Adidas
Invitational. The deep field included six top-10
teams for both the men and women overall, 20
women's teams were ranked, along with 19 on the
men's side. In addition, the No. 8 Cardinal men had
to race against top-ranked Wisconsin, which was
down two top runners, and the No. 7 Cardinal
women competed against Pac-12 rivals No. 2
Arizona and No. 3 Washington.
But in a giant meet that had a more chaotic
atmosphere than a typical cross country race and
officials had to yell numerous times for spectators to
stay behind the white boundary lines, the Stanford
men pulled off an upset for new coach Chris
Miltenberg, edging past No. 5 lona by 10 points to
win the race. And the women showed off their fire
power as well, finishing in second place as a team.
For the men's 8-kilometer race, the early pace
was almost pedestrian as several runners stayed
with the heavily favored Arizona duo of Lawi
Lalang and Stephen Sambu. But after the first 5
kilometers, these two began to separate from the
pack and went on to finish first and second, respec
tively. The conservative start paid off for Lalang as
he lowered his course record from 2011 by eight

seconds to 23:03, edging out his teammate by four
seconds.
The Rosa twins had the best finishes for the
Cardinal, with Jim placing 17th (23:44) and Joe 19th
(also in 23:44). But the Cardinal men won because
their pack stayed close together, as their next three
runners finished within 20 seconds of the Rosas:
Miles Unterreiner 23rd (23:46), Tyler Stuzman 36th
(23:54) and Benjamin Johnson 48th (24:00).
The women, who actually ran first, also had a
relatively slow start for their 6-kilometer race, as
no one separated from the pack right away. But by
the end of the first mile it was a freshman, Laura
Hollander from Cal Poly, who took control of the
race, opening up a wide gap on the rest of the more
experienced field. Betsy Saina, who won the 10,000
meters outdoors at the Payton Jordan Invitational
this spring, made a move to run down Hollander
after the 4-kilometer point. But Hollander man
aged to hold on, despite taking the rare gamble of
starting aggressively, winning with a time of 19:33
to Saina's 19:35.
No. 5 lowa State, led by Saina, ran away with
the team competition, scoring 109 to No. 7
Stanford's 181, No. 2 Arizona's 242 and No. 3
Washington's 252. The runner-up Cardinal were
led by three-time All-American Kathy Kroeger,
who finished sth overall (19:46), and by freshman
Cayla Hatton, who placed 4th in the 5,000 at the

World Youth Championships this summer and
14th on Friday (20:02). The top five for Stanford
was rounded out by Jessica Tonn, in 18th (20:05),
Aisling Cuffe in 25th (20:08) and Marissa Perrante
in 119 th (20:55).

After the race, Kroeger and Ffatton were very
pleased with both how they ran their individual
races and how the team finished. Hatton was
apparently under the weather on race day. "I was
feeling very, very sick, so considering, I'm extreme
ly excited about how that went." She also gave
credit to her teammates for helping her be "com
posed" during her first major meet at Stanford.
Kroeger relayed the team's race strategy.
"We've just been working on staying composed
and relaxed for the first 3K and gradually building
through the last 3K," she said. "So I just tried to
stay back and keep my cool for the first half. And
for the last half, every KI just try to pick it up a bit
more and move toward the front. Yeah, it went
well. I was happy to execute the race plan."
On the heels of a big-time showing at
Wisconsin, the men and women will both have to
prove the race was no fluke when they compete
next on Oct. 27 at Santa Clarita in the Pac-12
Championships.
