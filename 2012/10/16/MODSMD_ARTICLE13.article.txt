# CARD BACK IN PLAYOFF HUNT
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The fifth-ranked men's water
polo team made a strong statement
this weekend by dominating two
conference opponents at their home
pools. Stanford avenged its early-sea
son loss to No. 2 UC-Santa Barbara
in the process and put itself in a posi
tion to jump the Gauchos in the
rankings.
Sparked by six goals and two hat
tricks from freshman driver Brett
Bonanni, Stanford (7-3,1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) broke
open big leads against both UC-Santa
Barbara and No. 8 Pepperdine to pull
away for the sweep.

The Cardinal scored the first five
goals of the game against UC-Santa
Barbara, essentially putting the game
away before halftime en route to a 9-
7 victory. It took longer to build a
lead against Pepperdine, but strong
second and third quarters by
Stanford eventually blew open a 9-4
lead. The Cardinal won by the same
margin, with a final score of 11-6.

The wins halted Stanford's los
ing streak at one and gave the Card
its first conference wins of the sea

son. Coming off of a fifth-place fin
ish at the SoCal Tournament two
weeks ago and a home loss to USC
in their conference opener last
weekend, Stanford needed big per
formances this weekend to get back
on track.

The key players did just that.
Bonanni had the most impressive
offensive showing, but sophomore
utility Alex Bowen and redshirt jun
ior 2-meter Forrest Watkins showed
up as well, tallying four goals apiece
over the two games.
Those three are Stanford's top
goal scorers this season, and they
accounted for 14 of the 20 Stanford
goals this weekend.
Less likely sources broke the ice

this weekend though, as sophomore
utility Nick Hoversten and freshman
driver B.J. Churnside scored the first
two goals on Saturday to jump on
top of Santa Barbara. That would be
Hoversten's only goal of the week
end and Churnside's lone goal of the
game.

Five power plays and two scores
later, Stanford finished the first quar
ter ahead 4-0. Santa Barbara finally
came up with a goal at the 4:41 mark
in the second quarter, and they went
into halftime trailing 7-2.
The Cardinal was actually
outscored 5-2 after halftime, but the
early cushion was more than enough to

On Sunday, Pepperdine
actually was in the lead early

in the first, and then 3-2 early
on in the second. That would
be their last lead, though, as
Stanford scored the next four
goals of the second quarter to
break open a 6-3 halftime
lead.
Stanford's defense stifled
Pepperdine, allowing only 13
shots all game and only one
goal in both the second and
third quarters.

Overall, the defense did a
good job of limiting opponent
shots this weekend. Junior
goalie Scott Platshon made 17
saves over the two games,
only one more than he made

in the single game against
USC last week.
Stanford is now 2-1 against
Santa Barbara this season.The
two teams had traded wins in
earlier tournaments. The
Cardinal win marked the first
win by the away team in the
season series.
A five-goal win over
Pepperdine is more of the
same for Stanford, which
defeated the Waves 13-8 back
on Sept. 30.
Stanford now has a week
to prepare for its annual Big
Splash the conference tilt
with rival UC-Berkeley. The
Golden Bears have wilted
thus far in conference play in
the face of the toughest MPSF
schedule of any team. They
are 0-2 in the league after loss
es to No. 1 USC and No. 3
UCLA.

son. Coming off of a fifth-place fin
ish at the SoCal Tournament two
weeks ago and a home loss to USC
in their conference opener last
weekend, Stanford needed big per
formances this weekend to get back
on track.

The key players did just that.
Bonanni had the most impressive
offensive showing, but sophomore
utility Alex Bowen and redshirt jun
ior 2-meter Forrest Watkins showed
up as well, tallying four goals apiece
over the two games.
Those three are Stanford's top
goal scorers this season, and they
accounted for 14 of the 20 Stanford
goals this weekend.
Less likely sources broke the ice

this weekend though, as sophomore
utility Nick Hoversten and freshman
driver B.J. Churnside scored the first
two goals on Saturday to jump on
top of Santa Barbara. That would be
Hoversten's only goal of the week
end and Churnside's lone goal of the
game.

Five power plays and two scores
later, Stanford finished the first quar
ter ahead 4-0. Santa Barbara finally
came up with a goal at the 4:41 mark
in the second quarter, and they went
into halftime trailing 7-2.
The Cardinal was actually
outscored 5-2 after halftime, but the
early cushion was more than enough to

After a tough start to conference play, the No. 5 Cardinal got back in the MPSF title race with a weekend sweep of UC-Santa Barbara and
Pepperdine. Redshirt junior 2-meter Forrest Watkins (10) scored two goals in each game as the offense found its groove.
prevent any late-game drama.
On Sunday, Pepperdine
actually was in the lead early
on. The waves went ahead 2-1
in the first, and then 3-2 early
on in the second. That would
be their last lead, though, as
Stanford scored the next four
goals of the second quarter to
break open a 6-3 halftime
lead.
Stanford's defense stifled
Pepperdine, allowing only 13
shots all game and only one
goal in both the second and
third quarters.

Overall, the defense did a
good job of limiting opponent
shots this weekend. Junior
goalie Scott Platshon made 17
saves over the two games,
only one more than he made

in the single game against
USC last week.
Stanford is now 2-1 against
Santa Barbara this season.The
two teams had traded wins in
earlier tournaments. The
Cardinal win marked the first
win by the away team in the
season series.
A five-goal win over
Pepperdine is more of the
same for Stanford, which
defeated the Waves 13-8 back
on Sept. 30.
Stanford now has a week
to prepare for its annual Big
Splash the conference tilt
with rival UC-Berkeley. The
Golden Bears have wilted
thus far in conference play in
the face of the toughest MPSF
schedule of any team. They
are 0-2 in the league after loss
es to No. 1 USC and No. 3
UCLA.
