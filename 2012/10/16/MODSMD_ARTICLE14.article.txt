## Pac-12 race heats up after road split STANFORD STILL CONTROLS DESTINY 
### RYAN HOAGLUND 
If late goals are heartbreaking,
Stanford's men's soccer team is in
need of some serious healing. The
Cardinal allowed three goals after
the 80-minute mark of their two
games this weekend, resulting in a 2-
2 double-overtime draw at Oregon
State and a 2-0 loss at Washington.
Stanford (5-6-1,2-2-1 Pac-12) got
back on the road again this weekend
after playing six straight games at
home. On Friday night the Card

The first half presented the Cardinal
a number of scoring chances, but
none of Stanford's five shots found
the back of the net. The Beavers did
n't have any better luck with their
two shots, and it remained scoreless
going into the second half.
The scoring was finally sparked
by a penalty kick in the 59th minute
when Zach Batteer was knocked
down in Oregon State's box, result

ing in a penalty kick. Senior forward
Adam Jahn took the kick and
promptly drilled the ball past the
keeper for the first score of the
match. Just 10 minutes later it was
Jahn striking again to extend the
Stanford lead to two.

"[Eric Verso] played me a nice
through-ball and 1 took a few touch
es and hit a low, hard shot that hit the
near post and went in," Jahn said of
his team-leading seventh goal of the
season.

The Beavers would begin their
comeback soon after in the 71st
minute, when OSU midfielder Will
Seymore scored on a penalty kick
brought on by a Stanford foul in the
box. It was beginning to look like

Stanford would still hang on for the
2-1 victory, when Alex Penny snuck
one past goalkeeper Drew Hutchins
in the 88th minute to tie the game
and force overtime.
The first 10-minute overtime was
scoreless as Oregon State goalkeep
er Matt Bersano was able to keep
Aaron Kover's shot out of the net.
The second overtime featured a
number of close calls, accentuated by
senior Dersu Abolfathi's chances in
the 106 th minute. Twice he was able
to break away and launch a shot, and
twice the Beavers' defense managed
to get between him and the goal for
the block. Time would end up run-

faced Oregon State (6-4-2,1-2-1 Pac
-12) in rainy Corvallis, Ore.

ning out, making the final
score a 2-2 draw.
"Of course we were a bit
frustrated not getting the win,"
Jahn said. "We thought we
deserved the result, but that's
the way soccer is sometimes."
Sunday morning the team
headed to Seattle to face the
University of Washington (8-
3-2, 3-0-1 Pac-12). Going into
the game, the Huskies hadn't
lost in their last five contests
and were looking to continue
the streak.
It was another slow first
half in a cold rain, with the
teams heading scoreless into
the locker rooms for halftime.
Marred by heavy fouls and
chippy play, the game seemed
to get out of referee Greg
Marshall's control.

Washington was content to sit
back on defense and look only
to counterattack while
Stanford dominated posses
sion and the pace of play. That
never manifested itself on the
score sheet, however, as
Stanford came up with only
three shots in the half and the
Huskies mustered just two.
Cardinal coach Jeremy
Gunn was clearly frustrated by
the Huskies' tactics. "It's not
going to be an enjoyable game
of soccer," Gunn said at half
time. "It's just so stop-start, it
takes 30 minutes for them to
put the ball in play. We don't
expect to be beautiful in our
attack; they're a good, tight,
disciplined defensive unit. If
they want to have a come at us
and play some soccer, then
we'll do that."
Gunn's wishes were soon
met, but in a scenario he no
doubt did not appreciate. Nine
minutes into the second half,
freshman defender Brandon
Vincent was given a red card
for slapping a Washington
player in the face after the two
became entangled on a free
kick, requiring Stanford to
play a man down for the
remaining 36 minutes.
This didn't stop the Cardinal
attack, which continued to press
when it could and posted seven
shots, including a nice drive from
Abolfathi in the 74th minute and
Jack Ryan in the 81st. In both
instances, Washington goalkeep
er Spencer Richey was able to

keep the Cardinal off the
board.
In the 81st minute,
Washington would finally pull
ahead with a near-post header
from Nate Sackeyfio. Minutes
later a penalty kick goal by
Ben Fisk on a late tackle just
inside the box would finalize
the victory.
After the match, Gunn was
still not pleased with the pace
and direction of play.

"[Stanford] played the better
soccer in the second half," he
told GoStanford.com. The
Cardinal, indeed, outshot
Washington by five, but the
Huskies' only two shots in the
half both resulted in goals.
Despite the disappointing
results, Stanford still sits in
third in the Pac-12 after the
weekend and will have the
chance to make up more
ground almost immediately.

Next week the Cardinal takes
the field against Oregon State
on Thursday and Washington
again on Sunday over a two
game homestand.
Senior Adam Jahn was
already gearing up for the
rematches.
"We are confident we can
get revenge."
