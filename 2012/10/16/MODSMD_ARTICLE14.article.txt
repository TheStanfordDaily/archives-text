If late goals are heartbreaking,
Stanford's men's soccer team is in
need of some serious healing. The
Cardinal allowed three goals after
the 80-minute mark of their two
games this weekend, resulting in a 2-
2 double-overtime draw at Oregon
State and a 2-0 loss at Washington.
Stanford (5-6-1,2-2-1 Pac-12) got
back on the road again this weekend
after playing six straight games at
home. On Friday night the Card

The first half presented the Cardinal
a number of scoring chances, but
none of Stanford's five shots found
the back of the net. The Beavers did
n't have any better luck with their
two shots, and it remained scoreless
going into the second half.
The scoring was finally sparked
by a penalty kick in the 59th minute
when Zach Batteer was knocked
down in Oregon State's box, result

ing in a penalty kick. Senior forward
Adam Jahn took the kick and
promptly drilled the ball past the
keeper for the first score of the
match. Just 10 minutes later it was
Jahn striking again to extend the
Stanford lead to two.

"[Eric Verso] played me a nice
through-ball and 1 took a few touch
es and hit a low, hard shot that hit the
near post and went in," Jahn said of
his team-leading seventh goal of the
season.

The Beavers would begin their
comeback soon after in the 71st
minute, when OSU midfielder Will
Seymore scored on a penalty kick
brought on by a Stanford foul in the
box. It was beginning to look like

Stanford would still hang on for the
2-1 victory, when Alex Penny snuck
one past goalkeeper Drew Hutchins
in the 88th minute to tie the game
and force overtime.
The first 10-minute overtime was
scoreless as Oregon State goalkeep
er Matt Bersano was able to keep
Aaron Kover's shot out of the net.
The second overtime featured a
number of close calls, accentuated by
senior Dersu Abolfathi's chances in
the 106 th minute. Twice he was able
to break away and launch a shot, and
twice the Beavers' defense managed
to get between him and the goal for
the block. Time would end up run-

faced Oregon State (6-4-2,1-2-1 Pac
-12) in rainy Corvallis, Ore.
