# Armstrong a legend no longer
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I should be writing about football
right now. About the third road
game I've ever been to. About
being allowed onto the Notre
Dame field before kickoff.
About another overtime thriller I wit
nessed firsthand and the second
painful defeat the Fiesta Bowl defi
nitely hurt. About the weather, the mis
erable Indiana rain that made me long
for sunny Palo Alto.
But throughout my whole weekend
jaunt to America's Second City, some
thing else was nagging at my peace of
mind.
Last week the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency (USADA) published its long
awaited report justifying why it has
been vehemently pursuing cycling leg
end Lance Armstrong for years. I say
"legend" because I'm no longer sure
that I can call him a hero, but it still
doesn't feel quite right to say "cheat."
The only real facts that I feel I can
be absolutely sure of anymore are
that Armstrong recovered from life
threatening testicular cancer to
become the most dominant force in
the cycling world for more than seven
years. Like him or loathe him —in
spite of his charitable work he never
really came across as a humble figure
his story was one of the most inspir
ing and incredible in the annals of
sporting history.

According to the USADA, though,
that was exactly the problem: It just
was too unbelievable. Read just a little
of its damning report and Armstrong
goes from superhero to supervillain.
Not only did he cheat, he was suppos
edly one of the central figures in per
haps the greatest conspiracy in all of
sports. It is reported that he could be
charged with perjury for lying under
oath about taking drugs, but really if he
did what he is accused of, he could per
haps be charged with much more seri
ous crimes. The USADA claims that he
enforced a similar doping routine on
fellow teammates, something that
could have risked their health and even
in rare cases have killed them.

Armstrong, meanwhile, denies the
charges —as he almost certainly
would, innocent or guilty though
has declined to continue fighting them
in court. That could be seen as an
admission of guilt, but either way it
lacks a concrete finality that would
bring this episode to a close. His
lawyers, too, have now called for the
USADA's witnesses to undergo lie
detector tests, so an end to this sorry
story doesn't seem to be in sight.
Where Armstrong's fairytale
seemed unbelievable to us mere mor
tals, we now have a story every bit as
outlandish. It's hard to imagine that
we'll ever know the truth with enough
certainty to know it really is the truth.
But it's more than that. Deep down
there is some part of me that doesn't
want this to be the truth, that wants at
least one of those seven Tour de France
titles to have been earned fair and
square.

We need heroes, and Armstrong was
that. Just spot the number of people still
wearing the yellow Livestrong wrist
band of the Lance Armstrong
Foundation, a nonprofit organization
that supports people affected by cancer.

But even its color now seems dis
tasteful. Cheat or not, he could be
respected for setting up an organiza
tion that has done so much good but
yellow? It is the color of the jersey
worn by the lead rider of the Tour de
France; the color that Armstrong wore
disingenuously for seven straight years.
Who in cycling can we now look up
to? Who can we even have faith in?
Among Armstrong's U.S. Postal
Service (USPS) teammates are famous
names like Floyd Landis, Tyler

It's hard to
imagine
we'll ever
know the
truth.
Hamilton and George
Hincapie. All are now self-con
fessed cheats. Among the Tour
de France winners in the post-
Armstrong era are riders who
were subsequently disqualified,
including Landis and Alberto
Contador.
Even those who refused to
take part in this doping conspir
acy and found themselves
edged out of the sport as a
result are no heroes. Their
silence until recently can be
viewed as tacit support of the
USPS regime because they
uniquely had the power to stop
this long ago.
If it hadn't been for those
pesky kids at the USADA, and
Armstrong and his cohorts had
gotten away with this, wouldn't

the world be a better place?
Sure, every ounce of my moral
fiber screams out for justice and
fairness, but what we don't
know can't hurt us. In that par
allel universe the fairytale is still
alive; millions are still inspired
by what man can apparently
achieve rather than hollowed
out by the knowledge of his
deception.
Growing up is a bitter
process. One by one every
childhood legend turns out to
be a fake: the tooth fairy, Santa
Claus and now Armstrong.

From his vantage point in
the stands, Tom Taylor had
the perfect angle on the final
play from Notre Dame. He
has thus far refused to reveal
what really happened, but
you can email him at

make him give up the truth
or follow him on Twitter
