# SPORTS BRIEF
## Ertz, Toilolo named to Mackey Award Midseason Watch List 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
After serving as quarterback Josh Nunes'
favorite targets all season long, senior tight ends
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo were named to
the John Mackey Award Midseason Watch List
on Monday. Named after Hall of Fame tight end
John Mackey, the award is given out by the John
Mackey Selection Committee each year to
honor the best tight end in college football.
A year after graduated senior Coby Fleener
was the first tight end taken in the 2012 NFL
Draft and a semifinalist for the 2011 award, Ertz
and Toilolo bolstered Stanford's claim to the
title "Tight End U." At 6 feet 8 inches, Toilolo is
a matchup problem for most defenders, and has
come on strong recently. In the overtime win

over Arizona, Toilolo led the Cardinal in receiv
ing yards with a career-high 141 in addition to
his one touchdown.
On the other side of the line, Ertz has been
just as dominant. He leads the team in recep
tions (25), yards (371) and has accounted for a
fourth of the Cardinal's passing touchdowns.
Ertz received the John Mackey Tight End of
the Week award after catching the game-win
ning touchdown in Stanford's upset of USC ear
lier this year.
The 2012 recipient of the John Mackey
Award will be announced at the Home Depot
ESPNU College Football Awards Red Carpet
Show on Dec. 6. Ertz and Toilolo will take the
field this weekend against California in the
115 th Big Game.
