# Stanford committed to affirmative action
## Supreme Court considering challenge to racial consideration in college admissions 
### NATASHA VON KAEPPLER 
While Supreme Court justices question the role
of racial consideration as a factor in the college
admissions, Stanford remains committed to
upholding affirmative action, arguing that the poli
cy helps to ensure a diverse student body. One
Stanford professor has submitted a brief to the
Supreme Court defending the practice.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments
Wednesday for the case Fisher v. the University of

Texas. Abigail Fisher, a 22-year-old white female, is
suing the University of Texas-Austin, claiming that
she was denied acceptance to the university
because of her race.

Along with other psychologists, Greg Walton,
assistant professor of psychology, has submitted an
amicus brief to the Supreme Court. The document
provides a psychological perspective on racial
stereotypes and their effect on minority groups'
performance on standardized measurements of
merit.

Walton described standardized tests as "system
atically biased" due to a well-tested phenomenon
known as stereotype threat. Under stereotype
threat, minority students will often underperform
on academic exams simply because they are
expected to do so.
"Affirmative action is one way to address that
[problem], so that you end up admitting the best
students the students that have the greatest
potential, even as defined by very traditional met
rics," Walton said.

As an element of an applicant's background,
race is one of the first considerations on applica
tions to more than 480 universities who use the
Common Application, including Stanford.

Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw stated that
Stanford admission officers review an applicant's
background materials before their academic
records. He said that the practice helps to better
understand the students' learning and living expe-
nence.
"We subscribe to the con
cept of affirmative action," Shaw
said. "We see the value of diver
sity well beyond this idea of
admissions."
According to Shaw, a
Stanford classroom should
mimic the multidimensional
perspectives that can be found
across the United States.
In the recent Supreme Court
case, Fisher accuses the

University of Texas of having
too many methods in place to
ensure a diverse classroom. With
the Common Application and
the 10 percent rule promising
admission to students who grad
uated in the top 10 percent of
their class, often at schools with
different socioeconomic compo
sitions the University of
Texas, Fisher argued, was over
doing racial preferences.

Pam Karlan, a Stanford law
professor, pointed to a nuance in
the case, which she says specifies
Fisher's accusations.

"[Fisher] is not saying that
nobody anywhere can take race
into account," Karlan said.

"She's saying that under the spe
cific circumstances of this case,
Texas can't take race into
account."
Based on the 54 vote the last
time the Supreme Court under
took a case about affirmative
action in 2003 with Grutter v.
Bollinger Karlan said the rul
ing would likely be close this
time around as well.

Stanford and other peer
institutions are joining efforts to
prevent the Supreme Court
from striking down affirmative
action policies. In a brief from
the president and chancellors at
the University of California,
authors outlined the failure to

create a diverse campus under
California's Proposition 209,
which banned affirmative action
in the state in 1996.

"The year after it passed, the
number of African American,
Latino, and Native American
freshmen at UCLA and U.C.
Berkeley dropped by over 50
percent," the brief states.

Stanford's Vice President
and General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt reinforced the
University's commitment to
diversity and support for affir
mative action.

"Highly qualified applicants
are easy to find in our applicant
pool," Zumwalt said. "The issue

really is: How do we craft a class
that would be of the most bene
fit to our students in terms of
having different interest, skills
and perspectives?"

Shaw said while the
University does not know how
the Court will rule, Stanford
remains a defender against
racial bias and views affirmative
action as the means to achieving
a diverse student body.
"Stereotype threat is real; it
is weaved into the social fabric,"
Shaw said. "In universities, we
can smash it."

perspectives that can be found
across the United States.
In the recent Supreme Court
case, Fisher accuses the

University of Texas of having
too many methods in place to
ensure a diverse classroom. With
the Common Application and
the 10 percent rule promising
admission to students who grad
uated in the top 10 percent of
their class, often at schools with
different socioeconomic compo
sitions the University of
Texas, Fisher argued, was over
doing racial preferences.

Pam Karlan, a Stanford law
professor, pointed to a nuance in
the case, which she says specifies
Fisher's accusations.

"[Fisher] is not saying that
nobody anywhere can take race
into account," Karlan said.

"She's saying that under the spe
cific circumstances of this case,
Texas can't take race into
account."
Based on the 54 vote the last
time the Supreme Court under
took a case about affirmative
action in 2003 with Grutter v.
Bollinger Karlan said the rul
ing would likely be close this
time around as well.

Stanford and other peer
institutions are joining efforts to
prevent the Supreme Court
from striking down affirmative
action policies. In a brief from
the president and chancellors at
the University of California,
authors outlined the failure to

create a diverse campus under
California's Proposition 209,
which banned affirmative action
in the state in 1996.

"The year after it passed, the
number of African American,
Latino, and Native American
freshmen at UCLA and U.C.
Berkeley dropped by over 50
percent," the brief states.

Stanford's Vice President
and General Counsel Debra
Zumwalt reinforced the
University's commitment to
diversity and support for affir
mative action.

"Highly qualified applicants
are easy to find in our applicant
pool," Zumwalt said. "The issue

really is: How do we craft a class
that would be of the most bene
fit to our students in terms of
having different interest, skills
and perspectives?"

Shaw said while the
University does not know how
the Court will rule, Stanford
remains a defender against
racial bias and views affirmative
action as the means to achieving
a diverse student body.
"Stereotype threat is real; it
is weaved into the social fabric,"
Shaw said. "In universities, we
can smash it."
