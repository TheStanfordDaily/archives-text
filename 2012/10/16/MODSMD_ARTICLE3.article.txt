## Alvin Roth wins Nobel in Economics Professor awarded prize for work on market design 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Alvin "Al" Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D.
'74, senior visiting professor of eco
nomics, was awarded the 2012
Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic
Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel
on Monday morning. He shares the
prize with Lloyd Shapley, professor
emeritus at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
Roth, 60, and Shapley, 89, were
awarded the prize "for the theory of
stable allocations and the practice of
market design." They are expected to
split the $1.2 million cash award.
"The combination of Shapley's
basic theory and Roth's empirical
investigations, experiments and prac
tical design has generated a flourish
ing field of research and improved
the performance of many markets,"
the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said in a press release.
The laureates' work focuses on
matching theory finding the best
way to match agents in markets
based on preferences rather than
prices. Although they worked inde
pendently, Roth built on Shapley's
research foundations using laborato
ry experiments to apply theory to
real-world problems. His work has
redesigned the system that matches
medical residents with hospitals. New
York and Boston high school stu
dents with public schools and kidney
donors with recipients. Roth's
reforms rely on Shapley's "deferred

acceptance algorithm," a mathemati
cal formula introduced in a 1962
paper, "College Admissions and the
Stability of Marriage," with David
Gale,
"The School of Humanities &
Sciences is the basic research core of
the University and as such some
times we're thought to be a little eso
teric and not involved in real world
problems," said Dean of Humanities
& Sciences Richard Sailer. "So it is a
particular pleasure to have A1 [Roth]
back working on such deeply practi
cal issues as kidney transplants or
matching students to schools."
Roth's work has led to his recog
nition as a pioneer in market design,
game theory, experimental econom
ics and their real-world applications.
He received the call from Sweden
at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning.
"It was unexpected, we didn't
reach the phone in time," Roth said.
"But they called back."
This fall quarter, Roth is teaching
ECON 285: Market Design, a class
open to both graduate and under
graduate students. His class met at 11
a.m. on Monday, immediately follow
ing a Stanford" press conference at
which Roth, Sailer, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 and Chair of
Economics Jonathan Levin '94
spoke. Roth ended the press confer
ence early to teach his class, a fact
Etchemendy pointed to as a testa
ment to Roth's excellence at teach
ing and mentoring.
"What I can say is not only is A1
an extraordinary researcher and
teacher, admired worldwide by econ
omists but he's also a heck of a nice
human being," Etchemendy said.

"It's nice to be the object of atten
tion," Roth said. "But I also would
like to deflect some of that attention
to my colleagues who work in this
area. The prize is really representa
tive of a whole stream of work."
Roth is currently professor of

economics and business administra
tion at Harvard University and
Harvard Business School but is in
transition to Stanford, where he will
become a full faculty member in

January 2013.
"We put a lot of time into
developing files for the appoint
ment of senior faculty to evalu

"It's nice to have the Nobel
committee vindicate our taste."
Roth is an Alfred P. Sloan
fellow, Guggenheim fellow and
a member of the National
Bureau of Economic Research
and the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences. He is now

the 19th Nobel Laureate in
Stanford's current community
of scholars, nine of whom have
received the Prize in Economic
Sciences. Hoover Senior Fellow
Thomas Sargent was awarded
the prize last year.

Stanford's 2012 Nobel lau
reates, Roth and Brian Kobilka,
professor of molecular and cel
lular physiology and winner of
the 2012 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry, will receive their
monetary awards, gold medals
and diplomas at a ceremony in
Stockholm on Dec. 10.

Alvin "Al" Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D.
'74, senior visiting professor of eco
nomics, was awarded the 2012
Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic
Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel
on Monday morning. He shares the
prize with Lloyd Shapley, professor
emeritus at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
Roth, 60, and Shapley, 89, were
awarded the prize "for the theory of
stable allocations and the practice of
market design." They are expected to
split the $1.2 million cash award.
"The combination of Shapley's
basic theory and Roth's empirical
investigations, experiments and prac
tical design has generated a flourish
ing field of research and improved
the performance of many markets,"
the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said in a press release.
The laureates' work focuses on
matching theory finding the best
way to match agents in markets
based on preferences rather than
prices. Although they worked inde
pendently, Roth built on Shapley's
research foundations using laborato
ry experiments to apply theory to
real-world problems. His work has
redesigned the system that matches
medical residents with hospitals. New
York and Boston high school stu
dents with public schools and kidney
donors with recipients. Roth's
reforms rely on Shapley's "deferred

acceptance algorithm," a mathemati
cal formula introduced in a 1962
paper, "College Admissions and the
Stability of Marriage," with David
Gale,
"The School of Humanities &
Sciences is the basic research core of
the University and as such some
times we're thought to be a little eso
teric and not involved in real world
problems," said Dean of Humanities
& Sciences Richard Sailer. "So it is a
particular pleasure to have A1 [Roth]
back working on such deeply practi
cal issues as kidney transplants or
matching students to schools."
Roth's work has led to his recog
nition as a pioneer in market design,
game theory, experimental econom
ics and their real-world applications.
He received the call from Sweden
at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning.
"It was unexpected, we didn't
reach the phone in time," Roth said.
"But they called back."
This fall quarter, Roth is teaching
ECON 285: Market Design, a class
open to both graduate and under
graduate students. His class met at 11
a.m. on Monday, immediately follow
ing a Stanford" press conference at
which Roth, Sailer, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 and Chair of
Economics Jonathan Levin '94
spoke. Roth ended the press confer
ence early to teach his class, a fact
Etchemendy pointed to as a testa
ment to Roth's excellence at teach
ing and mentoring.
"What I can say is not only is A1
an extraordinary researcher and
teacher, admired worldwide by econ
omists but he's also a heck of a nice
human being," Etchemendy said.

"It's nice to be the object of atten
tion," Roth said. "But I also would
like to deflect some of that attention
to my colleagues who work in this
area. The prize is really representa
tive of a whole stream of work."
Roth is currently professor of

economics and business administra
tion at Harvard University and
Harvard Business School but is in
transition to Stanford, where he will
become a full faculty member in
