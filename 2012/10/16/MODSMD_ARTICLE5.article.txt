## University Ave. project up for vote Arrillaga-junded development will be debated in PA Council 
### RAE STABEN 
The Palo Alto City Council will seek a
referendum on its plans to develop an
office and professional theater complex
across from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station
at 27 University Ave,
The project, which will be voted upon
at the Nov. 5 meeting, has received fund
ing from John Arrillaga '92 MBA '9B and
will house Theatre Works, the third-largest
theater company in the Bay Area.
The City Council has also requested a
traffic study, a reexamination of the size
and scale of the structure by the Planning
and Transportation Commission and a
comprehensive plan for public outreach
before further steps are taken. The public
will be able to air any concerns at the
November meeting.
A City Council staff report dated Sept.
24 stated that the plan aims to create an
"arts and innovation district" at the "high
ly visible and accessible" area between
Stanford University and downtown Palo
Alto.
"It brings together the edges of the
Palo Alto community with the Stanford
community and begins to cre
ate a new place of inter
change," said Palo Alto
Councilman Greg Schmid.

Some Palo Alto citizens
have already voiced their dis
content. Martin Sommer
started an online petition to
urge the mayor and City
Council to retain the 50-foot
limit, which the building
would violate. The current
complex is planned at over
100 feet.
"If John [Arrillaga] were
to build his office complex, it
would destroy my living
space, and the space of 43
other homeowners in
Abitare," Sommer wrote in
his online petition. Sixty
seven supporters have signed
the petition as of Oct. 15.
The city's enforcement of
the 50-foot limit has loosened
since it was established in the
19705. The 101 Lytton Ave.
building measures 70 feet and
restrictions were eased for the
Stanford Hospital & Clinics
medical center.

"We are well aware of the
petition and the number
signed and the interest in the
community," Schmid said. "I
think our next scheduled
meeting... will be a time for
us to hear from a range of the
public. We are looking for
ward to the public playing a
big role in this."
University Director of
Community Relations Jean
McCown said that while
Stanford is not directly
involved in the development's
approval process, it is support
ive of the project.
"It is impossible to pro
pose this without the
University's consent of pro
posal," McCown said.

McCown also wrote a let
ter to Palo Alto Vice Mayor
Greg Scharff expressing "the
University's support, saying,
"Stanford is pleased that the
city of Palo Alto will be giving
this proposal its thoughtful
and constructive considera
tion."

According to Schmid, all
of the proceeds of the office
space will be given as a gift to
Stanford.
