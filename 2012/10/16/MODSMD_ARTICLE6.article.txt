## Fulbright, Rhodes app. numbers steady Bechtel Overseas Resource Center advises applicants 
### BENJAMIN PHAM 
A total of 75 seniors applied for Fulbright
scholarships this year, while 29 applied for
Rhodes scholarships. The students applied
through the Bechtel International Center's
Overseas Resource Center.
"We assist students from their first
inquiry to preparation for final interviews,"
said John Pearson, director of the Bechtel
International Center.
Tiffany Kung 'l3, a Fulbright applicant,
praised the help of the Overseas Resource
Center.
"They gave me a much clearer and more
understandable picture of the process," she
said. "They look over your personal state
ment and project proposal and offer you
interview help as well."
The Fulbright scholarship allows students
to either conduct their own research project
or teach English in a country of their choice.
The program was initially established in 1946
and is now active in 155 countries.
The Rhodes scholarship, established in
1902, funds up to three years of postgraduate
study at the University of Oxford in the
United Kingdom. Last year, a University
record of five alumni Aysha Bagchi 'll,
Anand Habib 'll, Ishan Nath 'l2, Kate
Niehaus 10 M.S. 'll andTenzin
Seldon 'l2 were selected for
the prestigious award, bringing
Stanford's total number of
Rhodes scholars to 107.
Stanford has also had suc
cess with the Fulbright in past
years.
"In the last few years it has
been around 25 winner's each
year," he said. "Last year it was
lower, this year we hope it will
increase again."

While students must get
University endorsement for the
Rhodes scholarshop, the
Fulbright Program requires that
Stanford forward all submitted
applications.
"The Rhodes has no institu
tional limits or quotas but
strongly requests that schools
seriously evaluate applicants
before providing endorse
ments," Pearson said.
"Endorsement decisions vary,
depending on the scholarship
and whether there is a limit on
how many applications we can
forward."
Pearson stated that while
the University does not release
the number of endorsed appli
cants, the majority of applicants
receive University endorse
ments. Approximately 35 to 40
students seek Rhodes and
Marshall endorsements each
year. The endorsement commit
tee is made up of faculty and
former Rhodes and Marshall
scholars. Every applicant for the
scholarships is granted an inter
view, even if over Skype.
"We provide ongoing advis
ing to students to help them
determine whether they should
apply," he said.
Once applicants receive an
endorsement, the Rhodes Trust
reviews their applications.
Applicants are then notified if
they have received a final inter
view.

"For Rhodes, numbers do
vary as to how many Stanford
candidates receive final inter
views but it is usually up to a
dozen," Pearson said. "On the
whole, Stanford students do
very well in these competi
tions."
