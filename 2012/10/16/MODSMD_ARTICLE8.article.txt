Pakistanis at Stanford organized a vigil and video screening on Monday evening in White Plaza. "Stand with Malala" was held in solidarity with
Malala Yusfzai, a 14-year-old activist from Swat, Pakistan, who was shot by the Taliban on her way back from school. The vigil was supported by
the Graduate Student Council, Humanist Community at Stanford, Amnesty International, and Athiests, Humanists and Agnostics.
