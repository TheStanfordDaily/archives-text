## THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY How Silicon Valley can harm CS majors 
### Adam Johnson 
A friend recently sent an email to
our house list asking if some
one majoring in computer sci
ence would talk with a high school sen
ior who was interested in program
ming.
Now, I don't major in computer sci
ence and I have a limited knowledge
of its course offerings, but I sent a seri
ous email back saying that I could give
at least one reason why he should not
come to Stanford if he is genuinely
interested in CS.
Yes, I know we have one of the
best, if not the best, computer science
programs in the world. The classes are
rigorous and seemingly rewarding, the
professors are knowledgeable and
passionate and the support is tremen
dous. Why should any aspiring com
puter scientist in their right mind turn
Stanford down?
I have a theory, which could be
completely wrong, that the presence of
Silicon Valley has a negative influence
on the quality of programming work
generally undertaken by Stanford stu
dents. By quality I do not mean how
the code itself is written, but rather
whom the said code is intended to
serve and what it is that justifies its
existence in the first place.
In Silicon Valley, programmers and
entrepreneurs often get a skewed sense
of what is needed in the world. A partic
ular smartphone application, for
instance, may be "essential" for people

addicted to their devices, but is it help
ful for a more average user? Even
many endeavors that are intended to
benefit inhabitants of developing
nations are ultimately funded by Silicon
Valley venture capital firms. What gets
funded is not necessarily what the for
eign citizens want or need, but what a
relatively homogenous set of investors
think these people want or need.
Perhaps this world needs more
technology. Perhaps it is good that
machines allow individuals to become
more efficient and live longer lives.
Or perhaps technology underlies
many budding societal problems.
Perhaps inefficiencies and death are
what make us human. In the end, and
as I have argued before, it's probably a
bit of both sides. But are Stanford's
budding entrepreneurs hearing that
message, or are they constantly being
told that technology is the solution,
that within technology lurks the
answers to the world's problems?
Many top Silicon Valley executives

participate in an annual conference
that discusses the proper role of tech
nology in society, but are Stanford's
aspiring entrepreneurs having these
conversations?

Which brings me back to the
prospective student. Maybe other uni
versities more removed from Silicon
Valley offer more balanced environ
ments for an aspiring computer scientist.
Of course, entrepreneurs do not come
exclusively from computer science
people from a variety of academic back
grounds pursue or are involved in some
aspect of entrepreneurship.
I think, then, that we should all ask
ourselves some broader questions.
How does Silicon Valley affect my
major? Does it have implications for
what I am taught in class? Does it limit
or expand the career opportunities I
am told about? Does the Silicon Valley
culture align with my intellectual and
extracurricular interests?

The answers to these questions
won't be the same for everyone. But
once we begin to explicitly answer
them, we will have a richer discourse on
how certain classes should be taught,
how certain majors should be designed
and how Stanford as a whole should
proceed into the future given its loca
tion in the heart of Silicon Valley.

How does
Silicon Valley
affect my major?
