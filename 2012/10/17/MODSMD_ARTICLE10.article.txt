## OP-ED Why You Should Support J Street U at Stanford 
### THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF J STREET U AT STANFORD 
On Oct. 22, President Obama
and Governor Romney will
engage in the last presidential
debate, dedicated solely to foreign
policy issues. Amidst the usual mix of
rhetorical "zingers" and all-too-infre
quent substantive exchanges, the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is sure to
come up.
And that's obviously a good thing;
both candidates should feel com
pelled to articulate a position on a
violent conflict that has been raging
for more than half a century. It's prob
ably even more obvious that such
public statements are only a first step.
But politics are not a spectator
sport.
We, the board of J Street U, a new
political advocacy group at Stanford,
urge all our peers to join us in active
ly debating the issue here on campus.
Amidst the frenzied listserv cul
ture of Stanford, this piece may come
off as a shameless plug. The gravity of
the issue, however, and what we
believe is a hole in the current state of
discourse, should dispel that impres
sion.
J Street U is a national student
movement acting on over 50 campus
es in support of Israelis, Palestinians,
and a peaceful, two-state solution. We
are pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian, and
pro-peace.
The fact that this conjunction may
seem contradictory to some shows
how much work we have cut out for
us. And to those who agree that it's
possible, but are intimidated by or
unaware of the staggering complexity
of the matter the tensions between
the security needs of Israelis, the
abuses Palestinians face under
Occupation, the threats leveled to
Israel's very right to exist as a Jewish
homeland, and the political and
human rights of Palestinians that is
all the more reason to investigate and
debate the matter in a thorough and
civil way.
We are committed to providing a
platform for speakers in an open and
diverse discussion on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. On Tuesday, we
hosted a former Israeli soldier from
Breaking the Silence, an Israeli NGO
dedicated to raising awareness about
the stark realities of Occupation
and the effects military service in the
West Bank has on Israeli soldiers. We
also heard from a former soldier who
served in the occupied territories in
2010 and is now a public advocate for

Israel and a just peace.
To be sure, political advocacy
groups for Israeli-Palestinian issues
exist on campus. The advocacy, how
ever, has generally been too one
sided to inspire genuine dialogue and
debate. We are unaware of any events
hosted by pro-Israel groups where
Israel's occupation has been unam
biguously criticized, or conversely, of
any pro-Palestinian events where the
security needs of Israelis have been
discussed seriously. (We are happy to
be corrected with evidence of any
individual instances of this, but the
more important point is that no group
has the mandate to confront multiple
sides of the issue.) We maintain both
that the occupation denies
Palestinians fundamental political
rights and that there are genuine
security concerns for Israelis, who are
continuously threatened by organiza
tions like Hamas and Hezbollah that
act to destroy Israel.
Obviously, an open discussion on
the reality of suffering and injustice
on both sides is not a solution.
But it is a conversation that can be
the basis for constructive work
towards a solution.

We also want to recognize the
support we've already received, most
importantly from Hillel at Stanford.
We are proud to be a Hillel group
part of a broad, colorful coalition of
organizations that contribute in
diverse ways to campus life. We've
been supported by Hillel staff in our
mission, and applaud their work
towards creating space within Hillel
and the Jewish community for chal
lenging conversations like the one we
had last night with soldiers on the
implementation of the Occupation.

The health of the discourse at
Stanford requires embracing an open
dialogue on these and all issues.
Though the realities of the
Occupation and the threats Israel
faces are painful to face, we cannot
move forward in pursuing an end to
the conflict without educating our
selves on what is actually happening
on the ground.
Our hopes are not particularly
high for the presidential debate, but
they are for our talented and passion
ate student body. We hope to inspire
civil debate and spread awareness
free from "zingers" and one-liners.
