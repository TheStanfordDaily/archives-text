# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Who Wants a Straight A Student? 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
I went to a high school with no
grades. When I tell people that,
they usually look at me like I'm
some Martian anarchist who should
n't be here. Instead of a report card
with lonely letters sitting on a blank
page, we received comments for each
class at the end of every term, some
more than two pages long. We had
regular conferences with our teachers
to discuss our progress, so you always
knew how you were doing in a class.
And if you knew you were doing well,
it was less an indicator of success and
more a red flag that you should take
harder classes.

My high school's pedagogy made
sense to me, and if you care a great
deal about college acceptance rates, it
worked. We have plenty of former
students at Yale, Harvard, Columbia
and Stanford. More importantly,
when I run into my old classmates in
San Francisco, they usually want to
talk about Emily Dickinson, or the
political climate of the Middle East in
1979. When you can't measure suc
cess by a letter grade, you take owner
ship of your learning; you latch onto
what excites you and fold it into your
personality.
Research psychologist Carol
Dweck, who popularized the idea of
malleable as opposed to fixed intelli
gence, was quoted in The Chronicle
Review describing Stanford students:
"The students who thrive are not nec
essarily the ones who come in with
the perfect scores. It's the ones who
love what they're doing and go at it
vigorously." Hie catch is, to go at
learning vigorously, you might have
to let go of your perfect GPA.
Learning requires that you stretch
yourself in new directions, and maybe
get a few C's or D's along the way. In
four years at Stanford, you should be
able to find at least one class that
challenges you so much that even
with your best effort, you come out
with a D. If you engaged with the
material and tried your best, a D is a
great symbol of the risk you took. If

you figured out how to do well on the
midterms without going to lecture, an
A is a symbol that you played it safe.
Sometimes when I talk to my
peers at Stanford, I feel a climate of
unnecessary stress. The friends that I
have outside of school seem much
more realistic about the demands of
their personal responsibilities. The
stakes are higher outside of school,
making rent, paying bills, finding a
job, yet the stress levels are higher on
campus. When you change your atti
tude about grades and success, some
of that anxiety lifts. A professor of
mine began a series of lectures with
the warning: "I am going to teach you
something with no practical, econom
ic or social significance." Those should
be exciting words. A challenge to
learn for the sake of learning, an invi-

tation to work for the sake of work
alone. So I implore you: stop checking
to see where you fall on the curve and
start learning how to learn on your
own terms.
