# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Grief, Grandmas, and Greatness 
### Chris Herries 
Last Tuesday I was making my
weekly phone calls to friends
and family. After talking to my
mother I immediately punched in the
number for my grandmother. The
alien voice on the other end told me

the number was no longer in service.
It was then that I remembered that
my grandma had died about a week
before. Throughout the hustle and
bustle of week two I never realized
that I would be making one less call
every week. What I did real
ize is that the person who made the
greatest impact in my life just isn't
going to pick up the phone again. She
helped me travel the world. She
taught me to be open minded, to
experience things and to care about
injustice. She showed me how to
love others and myself. Yeah, she's
dead, and that sucks because much
of the man I am today is her doing.
There are some debts in life we can
not repay, but are happy to carry.
Such was my relationship with her.
As kids we're told to fear monsters
and boogie men while really the only
pain in life is parting. The only times
I've been afraid is during goodbyes,
because only God knows their finality.

Should we be sad when we lose
people? Of course, but we should
realize that if it hurts now that's only
because we shared something truly
special in the past. Moreover, people
never really leave us. Before my
grandma died she promised that she'd
always be with me. Maybe you don't
buy into the whole afterlife idea, but
the lessons she taught are going to
stay. They'll mean something. And
when the time comes, I'll tell my

daughters about how they should
aspire to be as strong as their great
grandmother.

Now, I'm not writing all this for
catharsis or sympathy that would
be a little selfish on my end. What I
want to remind you is that truly great
people don't have to pass through this
world with pomp and procession.
Fantastic individuals, filled with love
and compassion, pass virtually
unmarked every day. There will be no
Nobel Peace Prize to remember
them. There will be no statues, nor
memorials. There will be little more
than a grieving family and a modest
headstone.
That doesn't diminish who they
are, or how meaningful their lives
were, so long as we realize that great
ness comes in all forms. My grand
mother was, without hyperbole, a
fierce friend, a loving mother, a hard
worker, a generous soul, and a faithful
wife. She was a positive influence on
nearly everyone she met, and was
constantly decades ahead of her time.
I can think of no higher calling than
to love those closest to you, without
condition or pretense, as she did.
In your life, you may be concerned
with wealth, or fame, or power, or for
tune. These are high aspirations and
by no means make you a bad person.
However, never think those things
are what qualify you as a great per
son, because they don't. Great people
aren't concerned with the vanities of
fame those come if they come.
Great people are in the business of
love and honesty. They love those
around them without affliction, and
care deeply about their wards.
Therefore, if you want to be a
great person, heed this: Great people
are servants first. They realize that the
world doesn't owe them anything
they owe their talents and selves to
make sure that those around them go
to bed filled, loved and cared for.
Fortunately, I was there in my grand
ma's final days. She used her life to
serve well, and died happy for it. Love
is something to which we can all
aspire, even in our small, albeit sunny,
corner of the world.
This week I humbly ask you to call
your grandmother, or your father, or
your daughter, because one day there
will be no answer on the other end of
that line. You'll have little left save the
lessons they passed on, because you
are their record in the world. When
questioned about death I recall
Tolkien's famous words, "not all tears
are an evil."
