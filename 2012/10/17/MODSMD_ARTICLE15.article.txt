## SAM SCHWARTZSTEIN SENIOR SIT DOWN 
### 
Aredshirt senior in his final
season on the Farm, cen
ter Sam Schwartzstein is
known as one of Stanford's
most vocal leaders on and
off the field. A preseason candidate for
the Rimington Trophy as the nation's
top collegiate center, Schwartzstein
came into his own last year as a first
year starter when the Cardinal offen
sive line helped Andrew Luck lead the
Pac-12 in passing efficiency and com
pletion percentage along with school
records for single-season touchdown
passes. The 6-foot-3 Southlake, Texas,
native played for tradition-rich Carroll
High School, winning the Texas Class
5A state title during an undefeated 16-
0 season his junior year.
Schwartzstein sat with The Daily
to use his unique perspective as one of
five fifth-year seniors on the roster to
talk all things Big Game and Stanford
football.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): With Big
Game looming, you have a different
perspective than a lot of the other
guys on the roster having been there
before. How do you take on a leader
ship role knowing a little better what
to expect on Saturday?
Sam Schwartzstein (Sam): It's one of
those things where, I'm an out of state
guy, I come from Texas, and everyone
knows Texas vs. Texas A&M's rivalry,
or the Oklahoma vs. Texas Red River
Shootout. Not as many people under
stand the enormous effect Big Game
has on the Bay Area. It really is one of
the biggest metro areas in world
where everyone looks to the one
game all year long.
A lot of times people don't care
about the season, just what happens in
Big Game, because you're working
with someone from Cal if you're from
Stanford, and you probably work with
someone from Stanford if you're from
Cal. You just have to let everyone on

the team know, "Hey this is that Iron
Bowl, this is that Biggest Cocktail
Party, it's one of those games so just
understand that this means a lot to
you, and the team." We're trying to go
out and win the Pac-12 North, but it's
also a community game and every
one's rallying round this one game.

TSD: Coming from Texas, where the
Big Game isn't traditionally as well
known except in certain circles, what
was your first Big Game like and how
do you think it has changed?

Sam: At that time in my freshman
year, it was one of the most important
Big Games in Stanford history, and we
didn't do what we were supposed to
do. We were 5-4 going into the final
three games, and we needed to win
one of them to go to a bowl game,
which would have been our first bowl
game in a decade. And we lost those
three games, the last one being in the
Big Game at Berkeley. When you see
the axe go to them, you understand
"Wow, we really lost." Now it's all
about having to come back and win

that axe and go to a bowl game.
TSD: Much has been made of the Big
Game being played in October for the
first time since the first game in the
rivalry began back in 1892. With the
game moving up in the schedule, and
you guys having a lot of conference
games to focus on even after Big
Game, does that change things for you
from a preparation standpoint?
