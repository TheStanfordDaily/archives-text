## SAM SCHWARTZSTEIN SENIOR SIT DOWN 
### 
Aredshirt senior in his final
season on the Farm, cen
ter Sam Schwartzstein is
known as one of Stanford's
most vocal leaders on and
off the field. A preseason candidate for
the Rimington Trophy as the nation's
top collegiate center, Schwartzstein
came into his own last year as a first
year starter when the Cardinal offen
sive line helped Andrew Luck lead the
Pac-12 in passing efficiency and com
pletion percentage along with school
records for single-season touchdown
passes. The 6-foot-3 Southlake, Texas,
native played for tradition-rich Carroll
High School, winning the Texas Class
5A state title during an undefeated 16-
0 season his junior year.
Schwartzstein sat with The Daily
to use his unique perspective as one of
five fifth-year seniors on the roster to
talk all things Big Game and Stanford
football.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): With Big
Game looming, you have a different
perspective than a lot of the other
guys on the roster having been there
before. How do you take on a leader
ship role knowing a little better what
to expect on Saturday?
Sam Schwartzstein (Sam): It's one of
those things where, I'm an out of state
guy, I come from Texas, and everyone
knows Texas vs. Texas A&M's rivalry,
or the Oklahoma vs. Texas Red River
Shootout. Not as many people under
stand the enormous effect Big Game
has on the Bay Area. It really is one of
the biggest metro areas in world
where everyone looks to the one
game all year long.
A lot of times people don't care
about the season, just what happens in
Big Game, because you're working
with someone from Cal if you're from
Stanford, and you probably work with
someone from Stanford if you're from
Cal. You just have to let everyone on

the team know, "Hey this is that Iron
Bowl, this is that Biggest Cocktail
Party, it's one of those games so just
understand that this means a lot to
you, and the team." We're trying to go
out and win the Pac-12 North, but it's
also a community game and every
one's rallying round this one game.

TSD: Coming from Texas, where the
Big Game isn't traditionally as well
known except in certain circles, what
was your first Big Game like and how
do you think it has changed?

Sam: At that time in my freshman
year, it was one of the most important
Big Games in Stanford history, and we
didn't do what we were supposed to
do. We were 5-4 going into the final
three games, and we needed to win
one of them to go to a bowl game,
which would have been our first bowl
game in a decade. And we lost those
three games, the last one being in the
Big Game at Berkeley. When you see
the axe go to them, you understand
"Wow, we really lost." Now it's all
about having to come back and win

that axe and go to a bowl game.
TSD: Much has been made of the Big
Game being played in October for the
first time since the first game in the
rivalry began back in 1892. With the
game moving up in the schedule, and
you guys having a lot of conference
games to focus on even after Big
Game, does that change things for you
from a preparation standpoint?


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt senior center Sam Schwartzstein (64) is a preseason candidate for the Rimington Trophy and last
year helped the Stanford offensive line set school records for single-season touchdown passes.
Sam: You know, it doesn't real
ly. When we looked at the
schedule in January, we said,
"Wow, I wish [the game] was
the same week as rivalry week,
the same week as all of those
Texas A&M, Texas games. But
you know what it's coming at
the perfect time in the season
it's an emotional game and a
chance to get back on the right
track.

TSD: Speaking of getting back
on track, how do you bounce
back from Notre Dame? It's
always painful losing, especially
close games, but what about for
the younger guys on the team
who really aren't used to losing
in their college careers?

Sam: Well we were focused
going into the last week, but
what you learn is that it takes
that much more focus to win.
It's kind of perfect to have Cal
next, because there is that emo
tional side to the game, and we
just have to instill in the young
guys what this means to the
team for the season as a whole.
And coach Shaw preaches
about going out and getting
that hardware. He wants physi
cal, tangible evidence that we
are successful, and the Axe is
the creme de la creme of that
evidence.

TSD: What part of Big Game
and all of the festivities do you

enjoy the most?
Sam: I'd say hearing from older
guys and alumni, talking about
how this is the game. You hear it
all the time with games like
USC or Notre Dame, but with
the Cal game you see everyone
wherever they might be thinking
about it. I mean, I've got friends
in Georgia talking about Big
Game, you feel the nationwide
attention on the game.
TSD: Is there anything about
being on the other side of four
Big Games that makes you
appreciate things more this last
time around?
Sam: When you hear the stories
about the Axe exchange, and the
stealing of the Axe, it takes a
more community aspect rather
than just being about the game
itself Those are the things I find
that are the coolest, because
that's what made the game
important over time. The Red
River Shootout is during the
Texas State Fair and there is so
much community around it. This
game has more history, more
hate for each other on both sides
mutual respect but mutual
hatred —and it's one of those
cool rivalries that I didn't really
understand before
TSD: Ok, quick hitters to close it
out. Who's the funniest guy on
the team?
Sam: James Vaughters. He just
has a demeanor about him.
When you look at him you think,
"Man that guy's a centaur." And
you never can really understand

how some of that stuff would
come out of the guy's mouth.
TSD: What's the most difficult
thing about being a fifth-year
senior?
Sam: Understanding that
you're six year older than some
of the freshman. I mean some
of them were born in 1994.
Understanding that I was
already in school when they
were born. I was playing college
football when they were in sev
enth grade. Sometimes I can't
believe this is happening. But
that's the culture shock of being
a fifth-year senior.
TSD: Favorite class at
Stanford?
Sam: STS 200, my senior collo
quium. Science, Technology and
Society is my major, and the
class just brings everything
together. It's an interdiscipli
nary course and I took a com
munications route, but you
could take a different approach
with things like symbolic sys
tems, computer science, civil
engineering, psychology, sociol
ogy. But everyone is together in
the same class and we collabo
rate on ideas on a certain topic.
Our topic just so happened to
be food, which I love, so being
able to collaborate on that topic
with all the other people and
perspectives was just unbeliev
able.
TSD: Thanks so much for sit
ting down to talk, Sam.
Sam: Thank you.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): With Big
Game looming, you have a different
perspective than a lot of the other
guys on the roster having been there
before. How do you take on a leader
ship role knowing a little better what
to expect on Saturday?
Sam Schwartzstein (Sam): It's one of
those things where, I'm an out of state
guy, I come from Texas, and everyone
knows Texas vs. Texas A&M's rivalry,
or the Oklahoma vs. Texas Red River
Shootout. Not as many people under
stand the enormous effect Big Game
has on the Bay Area. It really is one of
the biggest metro areas in world
where everyone looks to the one
game all year long.
A lot of times people don't care
about the season, just what happens in
Big Game, because you're working
with someone from Cal if you're from
Stanford, and you probably work with
someone from Stanford if you're from
Cal. You just have to let everyone on

the team know, "Hey this is that Iron
Bowl, this is that Biggest Cocktail
Party, it's one of those games so just
understand that this means a lot to
you, and the team." We're trying to go
out and win the Pac-12 North, but it's
also a community game and every
one's rallying round this one game.

TSD: Coming from Texas, where the
Big Game isn't traditionally as well
known except in certain circles, what
was your first Big Game like and how
do you think it has changed?

Sam: At that time in my freshman
year, it was one of the most important
Big Games in Stanford history, and we
didn't do what we were supposed to
do. We were 5-4 going into the final
three games, and we needed to win
one of them to go to a bowl game,
which would have been our first bowl
game in a decade. And we lost those
three games, the last one being in the
Big Game at Berkeley. When you see
the axe go to them, you understand
"Wow, we really lost." Now it's all
about having to come back and win

that axe and go to a bowl game.
TSD: Much has been made of the Big
Game being played in October for the
first time since the first game in the
rivalry began back in 1892. With the
game moving up in the schedule, and
you guys having a lot of conference
games to focus on even after Big
Game, does that change things for you
from a preparation standpoint?


ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt senior center Sam Schwartzstein (64) is a preseason candidate for the Rimington Trophy and last
year helped the Stanford offensive line set school records for single-season touchdown passes.
Sam: You know, it doesn't real
ly. When we looked at the
schedule in January, we said,
"Wow, I wish [the game] was
the same week as rivalry week,
the same week as all of those
Texas A&M, Texas games. But
you know what it's coming at
the perfect time in the season
it's an emotional game and a
chance to get back on the right
track.

TSD: Speaking of getting back
on track, how do you bounce
back from Notre Dame? It's
always painful losing, especially
close games, but what about for
the younger guys on the team
who really aren't used to losing
in their college careers?

Sam: Well we were focused
going into the last week, but
what you learn is that it takes
that much more focus to win.
It's kind of perfect to have Cal
next, because there is that emo
tional side to the game, and we
just have to instill in the young
guys what this means to the
team for the season as a whole.
And coach Shaw preaches
about going out and getting
that hardware. He wants physi
cal, tangible evidence that we
are successful, and the Axe is
the creme de la creme of that
evidence.

TSD: What part of Big Game
and all of the festivities do you

enjoy the most?
Sam: I'd say hearing from older
guys and alumni, talking about
how this is the game. You hear it
all the time with games like
USC or Notre Dame, but with
the Cal game you see everyone
wherever they might be thinking
about it. I mean, I've got friends
in Georgia talking about Big
Game, you feel the nationwide
attention on the game.
TSD: Is there anything about
being on the other side of four
Big Games that makes you
appreciate things more this last
time around?
Sam: When you hear the stories
about the Axe exchange, and the
stealing of the Axe, it takes a
more community aspect rather
than just being about the game
itself Those are the things I find
that are the coolest, because
that's what made the game
important over time. The Red
River Shootout is during the
Texas State Fair and there is so
much community around it. This
game has more history, more
hate for each other on both sides
mutual respect but mutual
hatred —and it's one of those
cool rivalries that I didn't really
understand before
TSD: Ok, quick hitters to close it
out. Who's the funniest guy on
the team?
Sam: James Vaughters. He just
has a demeanor about him.
When you look at him you think,
"Man that guy's a centaur." And
you never can really understand

how some of that stuff would
come out of the guy's mouth.
TSD: What's the most difficult
thing about being a fifth-year
senior?
Sam: Understanding that
you're six year older than some
of the freshman. I mean some
of them were born in 1994.
Understanding that I was
already in school when they
were born. I was playing college
football when they were in sev
enth grade. Sometimes I can't
believe this is happening. But
that's the culture shock of being
a fifth-year senior.
TSD: Favorite class at
Stanford?
Sam: STS 200, my senior collo
quium. Science, Technology and
Society is my major, and the
class just brings everything
together. It's an interdiscipli
nary course and I took a com
munications route, but you
could take a different approach
with things like symbolic sys
tems, computer science, civil
engineering, psychology, sociol
ogy. But everyone is together in
the same class and we collabo
rate on ideas on a certain topic.
Our topic just so happened to
be food, which I love, so being
able to collaborate on that topic
with all the other people and
perspectives was just unbeliev
able.
TSD: Thanks so much for sit
ting down to talk, Sam.
Sam: Thank you.

came into his own last year as a first

Pac-12 in passing efficiency and com
pletion percentage along with school
records for single-season touchdown
passes. The 6-foot-3 Southlake, Texas,
