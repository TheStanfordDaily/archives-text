## SHAW PREPARES FOR BIG GAME 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
At the midpoint of the regular season,
Stanford football finds itself at 4-2. At his weekly
press conference Monday, head coach David
Shaw acknowledged this record as disappointing
because of how close Stanford's losses were. But,
considering the challenge of replacing Andrew
Luck, Coach also feels this is a good place for
Stanford to be heading into the last stretch of con
ference games.

Unfortunately for Shaw, Stanford heads into
the second half of its season without starting wide
receiver Ty Montgomery, whose participation in
the 115 th edition of the Big Game against rival
California this weekend Shaw announced as
doubtful. While Montgomery's production has
been disappointing thus far, his replacements
were effectively nonexistent against the Irish, with
senior Jamal-Rashad Patterson dropping his only
target.

That loss at Notre Dame is still fresh in the
team's mind, leading to the question, will the team

move on from the controversial loss in time to
bounce back against Cal? As of Monday after
noon, the answers were varied from different
members of the Cardinal squad. Nickel back Usua
Amanam assured the media that the team had
collectively moved on from the loss, but captain
Chase Thomas admitted to not being over the loss
just yet.

The challenge of moving on is perhaps harder
than ever, as most players agreed that it really
doesn't feel like Big Game week on campus just
yet. Saturday will be the first time since the inau
gural Big Game in 1879 that the teams meet
before November, and it certainly is a bit weird to
see the fountains dyed red on an 80-degree day.
But Big Game will always be Big Game, no
matter what the date is. Though many players'
first Big Game memories came in the last few
years, coach Shaw's experience goes back to 1990,
his freshman year on the farm. That 1990 Big
Game was one of the craziest in memory, perhaps
only rivaled by "The Play" of 1982's Big Game,
the 30th anniversary of which will also be marked
this season.

Trailing by seven, Stanford star wide receiver
Ed McCaffrey reeled in a potentially game-tying
touchdown grab. Stanford elected to go for two,
and when the play failed, Cal's students stormed
the field to celebrate an apparent one-point victo
ry. However, with twelve seconds remaining, the
game was not over.

After the referees cleared the field and
assessed a 15-yard penalty to Cal for the celebra
tion, Stanford recovered its onside kick attempt at
Cal's 37-yard line. When kicker John Hopkins
returned to the sideline to practice a potential
game-winning field goal, he found his practice net
had been taken away by security in the previous
mayhem. So, faced with no other options, Hopkins
began practicing by kicking footballs into the
Memorial Stadium crowd, a sight that coach Shaw
witnessed as a redshirt freshman and relayed to
the media on Monday.
After a questionable roughing the passer call
against Cal, Hopkins drilled his fifth field goal of
