## 
### 
Stanford has recovered from
three early season losses to run out
to a 14-game winning streak and a
perfect record in the Pac-12 so far.

Cementing the current strength of
the Cardinal team, freshman middle
blocker Inky Ajanaku and sopho
more libera Kyle Gilbert both won
Pac-12 awards last week, Freshman
and Defensive Player of the Week,
respectively.
The No. 2 Cardinal (16-2,8-0 Pac
-12) defeated both top-10 ranked
Southern California teams last week.
In the wins over USC and UCLA,
Ajanaku set consecutive career highs

in kills and blocks, finishing with 17
and six, respectively, against the
Bruins. Gilbert, meanwhile, made a
match-high 22 digs against the
Trojans and followed that with a
career-high 25 against UCLA.

This weekend Stanford heads out
on the road to face No. 5 Washington
on Friday and then Washington State
on Sunday.
