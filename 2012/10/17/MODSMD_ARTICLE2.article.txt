# Alcohol policy less strict than peers'
## Dartmouth, Harvard, Yale have stricter rules about alcohol, drinking than Stanford 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale uphold
or implement more stringent alcohol policies in
response to a growing national trend of high
risk student drinking, Stanford administrators
have instead supported the University's current
policy while focusing on increased outreach to
students, particularly towards freshmen.
"We have a health and education approach
right now," said Deborah Golder, dean of resi
dential education. "We have an expectations
approach, and that feels very congruent with
Stanford's culture and values."
The emphasis on educating students will
take the form of increased programming by the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education's
(OAPE) Cardinal Nights initiative, now enter
ing its second year. Despite an uptick in medical
alcohol transportations last year, OAPE
declared Cardinal Nights' first year to be a suc
cess in creating a community for non-drinkers
on campus.
The OAPE will also focus on altering the
social dynamic of freshman dorms by a series of
targeted alcohol talks offered with the assis
tance of the Office of Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse (SARA), as well as launch
ing a pilot program in the Wilbur residential
complex that encourages residential staff to be
more active in promoting responsible approach
es to alcohol.
"Freshmen are a higher risk group," said

Ralph Castro, OAPE director. "We need to
develop a system that will educate them on what
they're going to be experiencing in college and
to create safety nets in case there are problems."
While the University's ban on the storage
and consumption of hard alcohol during this
past Summer Session prompted a backlash from
students and resident assistants (RAs) alike,
Colder and Castro quickly distanced themselves
from the policy, noting that current RAs
received additional training with regards to
alcohol-related issues.

"We've heard that feedback," Castro said,
noting that despite research linking hard
alcohol consumption to medical incidents
attempts by other schools to ban hard alcohol
have been largely unsuccessful. "Our goal is not
to vilify hard alcohol. Our goal is to reduce
behavior that gets people hurt."
"I found the [residential] staff very recep
tive," Golder added.

Castro added that the increased freshman
outreach is intended to be a proactive effort to
defend against a national trend of growing high
risk drinking, and framed the transition as the
least repressive measure available to the
University.
"It's obviously not just a question for
Stanford it's a question for higher educa
tion," Golder said, noting the Stanford currently
participates in a national collaborative on high
risk drinking. "If we don't respond to trends,
there will be a crisis it's inevitable and we
won't have done everything we could to prevent

a tragedy from occurring."
Cliff Nass, resident fellow in Otero, said that
the increased dialogue between Otero RAs and
students has thus far been unequivocally pro
ductive, adding that he was "guardedly opti
mistic" that the increased outreach might offer a
solution to high-risk drinking without banning

hard alcohol.
"Given what I've seen, I would loosen that
stance [of advocating banning hard alcohol],"
Nass said. "I don't think hard alcohol serves
Stanford well, but I don't think it has to be

"It is time to stop the self-congratulatory
nonsense about how successfully our
undergraduates deal with alcohol."

"We are targeting all of our alcohol
education on discouraging hard-liquor
consumption."
