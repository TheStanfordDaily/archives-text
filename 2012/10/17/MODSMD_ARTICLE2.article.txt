# Alcohol policy less strict than peers'
## Dartmouth, Harvard, Yale have stricter rules about alcohol, drinking than Stanford 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While Harvard, Dartmouth and Yale uphold
or implement more stringent alcohol policies in
response to a growing national trend of high
risk student drinking, Stanford administrators
have instead supported the University's current
policy while focusing on increased outreach to
students, particularly towards freshmen.
"We have a health and education approach
right now," said Deborah Golder, dean of resi
dential education. "We have an expectations
approach, and that feels very congruent with
Stanford's culture and values."
The emphasis on educating students will
take the form of increased programming by the
Office of Alcohol Policy and Education's
(OAPE) Cardinal Nights initiative, now enter
ing its second year. Despite an uptick in medical
alcohol transportations last year, OAPE
declared Cardinal Nights' first year to be a suc
cess in creating a community for non-drinkers
on campus.
The OAPE will also focus on altering the
social dynamic of freshman dorms by a series of
targeted alcohol talks offered with the assis
tance of the Office of Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse (SARA), as well as launch
ing a pilot program in the Wilbur residential
complex that encourages residential staff to be
more active in promoting responsible approach
es to alcohol.
"Freshmen are a higher risk group," said

Ralph Castro, OAPE director. "We need to
develop a system that will educate them on what
they're going to be experiencing in college and
to create safety nets in case there are problems."
While the University's ban on the storage
and consumption of hard alcohol during this
past Summer Session prompted a backlash from
students and resident assistants (RAs) alike,
Colder and Castro quickly distanced themselves
from the policy, noting that current RAs
received additional training with regards to
alcohol-related issues.

"We've heard that feedback," Castro said,
noting that despite research linking hard
alcohol consumption to medical incidents
attempts by other schools to ban hard alcohol
have been largely unsuccessful. "Our goal is not
to vilify hard alcohol. Our goal is to reduce
behavior that gets people hurt."
"I found the [residential] staff very recep
tive," Golder added.

Castro added that the increased freshman
outreach is intended to be a proactive effort to
defend against a national trend of growing high
risk drinking, and framed the transition as the
least repressive measure available to the
University.
"It's obviously not just a question for
Stanford it's a question for higher educa
tion," Golder said, noting the Stanford currently
participates in a national collaborative on high
risk drinking. "If we don't respond to trends,
there will be a crisis it's inevitable and we
won't have done everything we could to prevent

a tragedy from occurring."
Cliff Nass, resident fellow in Otero, said that
the increased dialogue between Otero RAs and
students has thus far been unequivocally pro
ductive, adding that he was "guardedly opti
mistic" that the increased outreach might offer a
solution to high-risk drinking without banning

hard alcohol.
"Given what I've seen, I would loosen that
stance [of advocating banning hard alcohol],"
Nass said. "I don't think hard alcohol serves
Stanford well, but I don't think it has to be

nonsense about how successfully our
undergraduates deal with alcohol."

Castro and Golder empha
sized the campus-wide nature
of the issue of high-risk drink
ing, noting this year's provi
sion of substance-free housing
in Mirrielees and encourage
ment of freshman outreach by
Greek societies as evidence of
the diverse range of policies
required to confront the issue.
"There's never a one-size
fits-all answer at Stanford,"
Golder said.
Meanwhile, the start of this
academic year also marked the
introduction of more stringent
policies regulating alcohol at
Stanford's peer institutions.
At Dartmouth, a scandal
over fraternity hazing and
drinking practices has been
reflected in unannounced
walkthroughs of Greek organ
izations as well as the obliga
tion for athletes and first-time
alcohol-related offenders to go
through an alcohol education
and counseling program.
Students involved in risky
alcohol behavior may also be
referred to the program by res
idential student staff.
"We have had a range of
responses to our clarifications
of our [student staff] role, but
most have been positive,"
wrote Aurora Matzkin, special
assistance to Dartmouth's

president, in an email to The
Daily. "Some express gratitude
for the clarifications to their
role and the new reporting
tools they now have to connect
a student in need to additional
assistance."
Matzkin acknowledged
that the program's implemen
tation was too recent to draw
any comprehensive conclu
sions, but cited previous suc
cess in a pilot stage as grounds
for the program's expansion.
"Given the other existing
research on this program, we
are now focused on delivering
this intervention to more stu
dents in a timely fashion,"
Matzkin wrote.
Harvard also introduced
more stringent regulation on
undergraduate drinking this
academic year, although the
program awaits faculty review.
While restrictions on hard
liquor were loosened for off
campus events, Harvard will
implement increased scrutiny
of private events on-campus
and the prohibition of "activi
ties that promote high-risk
drinking," while sustaining a
ban on hard liquor at on-cam
pus registered social events.
"While alcohol has a role
in social activities, its role is
ancillary to our mission and
purpose as a College," wrote
Harvard spokesman Jeff Neal
in an email to The Daily. "It is
expected that hosts will plan
parties where drinking is not
the central activity."
Yale, meanwhile, has made

no direct changes in recent
years to a stringent alcohol
policy that, among other
aspects, prohibits all kinds of
alcohol in freshman resi
dences. Hannah Peck, a stu
dent affairs fellow at Yale
College, defended Yale's sus
tained policy.
"We are working hard to
make sure our students have
the best learning environment
possible," Peck wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We do our
best to help students make
decisions that will point their
lives in a positive direction."
Reviewing Stanford's
stance, Golder framed the
reliance on constructive dia
logue between students and
administrators in formulating
an approach to alcohol as a
credit to the University's char
acter, but acknowledged that a
continued rise in alcohol-relat
ed incidents would likely
prompt a change in policy
towards the more stringent
model encountered at peer
institutions.
"[The current policy]
requires more from us as citi
zens of the University... [but]
if things continue to trend in a
high-risk way, of course we'll
keep looking at it," Golder said.
"The good news is that
we're really committed," Nass
reflected. "We're trying stuff
that's the Silicon Valley
approach."

sion of substance-free housing
in Mirrielees and encourage
ment of freshman outreach by
Greek societies as evidence of
the diverse range of policies
required to confront the issue.
"There's never a one-size
fits-all answer at Stanford,"
Golder said.
Meanwhile, the start of this
academic year also marked the
introduction of more stringent
policies regulating alcohol at
Stanford's peer institutions.
At Dartmouth, a scandal
over fraternity hazing and
drinking practices has been
reflected in unannounced
walkthroughs of Greek organ
izations as well as the obliga
tion for athletes and first-time
alcohol-related offenders to go
through an alcohol education
and counseling program.
Students involved in risky
alcohol behavior may also be
referred to the program by res
idential student staff.
"We have had a range of
responses to our clarifications
of our [student staff] role, but
most have been positive,"
wrote Aurora Matzkin, special
assistance to Dartmouth's

president, in an email to The
Daily. "Some express gratitude
for the clarifications to their
role and the new reporting
tools they now have to connect
a student in need to additional
assistance."
Matzkin acknowledged
that the program's implemen
tation was too recent to draw
any comprehensive conclu
sions, but cited previous suc
cess in a pilot stage as grounds
for the program's expansion.
"Given the other existing
research on this program, we
are now focused on delivering
this intervention to more stu
dents in a timely fashion,"
Matzkin wrote.
Harvard also introduced
more stringent regulation on
undergraduate drinking this
academic year, although the
program awaits faculty review.
While restrictions on hard
liquor were loosened for off
campus events, Harvard will
implement increased scrutiny
of private events on-campus
and the prohibition of "activi
ties that promote high-risk
drinking," while sustaining a
ban on hard liquor at on-cam
pus registered social events.
"While alcohol has a role
in social activities, its role is
ancillary to our mission and
purpose as a College," wrote
Harvard spokesman Jeff Neal
in an email to The Daily. "It is
expected that hosts will plan
parties where drinking is not
the central activity."
Yale, meanwhile, has made

no direct changes in recent
years to a stringent alcohol
policy that, among other
aspects, prohibits all kinds of
alcohol in freshman resi
dences. Hannah Peck, a stu
dent affairs fellow at Yale
College, defended Yale's sus
tained policy.
"We are working hard to
make sure our students have
the best learning environment
possible," Peck wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We do our
best to help students make
decisions that will point their
lives in a positive direction."
Reviewing Stanford's
stance, Golder framed the
reliance on constructive dia
logue between students and
administrators in formulating
an approach to alcohol as a
credit to the University's char
acter, but acknowledged that a
continued rise in alcohol-relat
ed incidents would likely
prompt a change in policy
towards the more stringent
model encountered at peer
institutions.
"[The current policy]
requires more from us as citi
zens of the University... [but]
if things continue to trend in a
high-risk way, of course we'll
keep looking at it," Golder said.
"The good news is that
we're really committed," Nass
reflected. "We're trying stuff
that's the Silicon Valley
approach."
