# FROZEN OUT FOR GOOD?

The NHL has consistently
been the odd black sheep
of the "big" American
sports leagues. The NFL
owns Sundays, the MLB is
the official league of "America's pas
time" and the NBA is where amazing
happens. The NHL? Truthfully speak
ing, hockey has lacked a catchphrase in
the modern Internet era.
Until now. The NHL: where killing
the golden goose happens.
Since Gary Bettman became dicta
tor (sorry, commissioner) in 1993, the
NHL has been involved in four yes,
four labor-related lockouts, starting
back in 1994 until most recently in
2004. The 2004 lockout was devastating
for the relatively small NHL, which
alienated a vast majority of its fan base
by canceling an entire season at the
request of the owners and the NHL
board of governors.
But the final outcome was benefi
cial for both sides: a 57/43 split of rev
enues towards the players, reduced
ages for full free agency, and most
importantly, a salary cap for all teams
that was tied to the revenues drawn in
by the league. After each lockout, the
NHL has been gifted with a get-out-of
jail-free card, a golden egg that hatches
a new golden goose.
The NHL over the last few years
has been steadily growing, with more
and more fans drawn in by the mes
merizing wide-open play brought
about by subtle rule changes, the
drama of regular season shootouts,
numerous "did you see that?" come
backs in the playoffs and large-market
teams like Boston and Los Angeles
hoisting the revered Stanley Cup. Also
of note is the fact that, outside of box
ing and MMA fighting, the NHL is the
only league that encourages players to
take violent swings at each other for
fun.
The Winter Classic, an outdoor
game played once a year, has become
one of the hottest attractions in the
sporting world. And the NHL has pio
neered what is, in my opinion, one of
the most entertaining All-Star Game
formats ever created, with captains
from each conference getting to pick
their own teams from a fan-selected
pool. Viewership has increased each
year since the lockout ended, capped
by a record-setting 2011-2012 season.
Bettman went from public enemy
number one to number two.
Again, this begs the question: why
stop a good thing?
The NHL is not the NFL. As Steve
Young aptly stated a few weeks ago,
demand for NFL games is inelastic to
the point of absurdity. Despite a bitter
lockout, the concussion crisis, rising
ticket prices, backlash against commis
sioner Roger Goodell and the replace
ment referee catastrophe, the NFL
continues to churn out revenue in mul
tiples of multiple billions of dollars.
Ironically, the NFL is officially a non
profit organization. Right. For whatev
er reason, regardless of the anger and
hatred people feel towards the NFL
shield, they keep coming back to watch
games and buy merchandise year after
year after year.
The NHL, on the other hand, has a
much smaller following, with small
market teams and loyal fans driving
much of the league's revenue.
Truthfully, the NHL cannot afford
another lockout so soon after the bitter
ending to the previous one. The 2005
collective bargaining agreement lasted
exactly seven years before going the
way of the dodo; in that time, the NHL
has almost managed to bring its popu
larity back up to what it was in the days
of yore. Now, who knows how far rat
ings will drop after another public rela
tions disaster.
I can use myself as a perfect exam
ple of the fair weather fans that the
NHL has tried to reach out to over
these last few years. I had not played or
watched a single minute of hockey
until my family moved to Cupertino in
2004, but through some nifty league
sponsored promotions I was able to go
to some San Jose Sharks games.
The speed and thrill of the game
sucked me in. I found myself watching
hockey when nothing else was on,
which is exactly what the NHL was
hoping for. When the playoffs came
about, I would tune in as rabidly as a
diehard fan, hoping to catch a glimpse
of something incredible. Hockey slow
ly climbed the ladder on my sports
hierarchy, mainly because it was visible
and fun. As more and more games are
cancelled, the memory of good hockey
will fade in the minds of fans and the
NHL both loses money and betrays all
the good will it has earned over the last
few years.
Like the football referee crisis, the
