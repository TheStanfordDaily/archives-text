# Let's Have a 'GAIETIES'

ing to much shit at Stanford. The
Stanford characters satirize the
stereotypes you'll encounter on any
given day in the smelly CoFFo, from
rich-betch-with- intelligence to
entrepreneurial-dipwad to free
spirit-hippie. And even the health
center gets a few knocks with
Devon Warshaw's 'l6 cross-dress
ing nurse. In a Halloween-style
nurse uniform (read: short),
Warshaw interprets student mal
adies in a matter of seconds. "Let
me look in your mouth you
have mono. Let me see your hand
You're pregnant!" he announces
to stunned students.
Beyond the endless jokes and
recognizable cultural icons, "Full
Doom on the Quad" tells the story
of the Stanford-Cal rivalry and a
nerd couple caught in the crossfire.
Star-crossed lovers, Stanford's
Martine and Berkeley's Philip, meet
and carry on their romance over

the internet until the fateful body
swap places them in their beloved's
own school; for Philip-in-Martine
it's in the happiest place on earth
and for Martine-in-Philip it's in the
gloomy East Bay.
Martine, played by Nora
Tjossem 'l5, is the perfect brand of
awkward, from her tendency to
narrate her life in the third person
to her obsession with World of
Warcraff. Not helping her cool fac
tor are her parents, the quintessen
tial Stanford groupies, charging in
every few scenes for some parental
smothering and hilarious lines by
April Gregory 'l3, and Louis
McWilliams 'l6.
The post-body-swap drama fol
lows an insidious plan led by Cal fac
ulty member Yudolf and a host of
strange Berkeley types a pregnant
lady, pseudointellectual James
Franco, and a stoner bro to infil
trate Stanford and turn it into hell
(read: reinstate IHUM and model

every building after the architecture
of Meyer library). Austin Caldwell
'l5, plays the soviet caricature of
Yudolf with unerring energy, comic
timing and a hilariously strong
accent.
When Yudolf, with the reluc
tant help of Martine-in-Philip's
body and the Cal villains, takes over
Stanford, it becomes a race against
the full moon countdown clock for
the Stanford heroes, including
Condi Rice, to free Stanford from
its rival's occupation.
With a well-designed set that
successfully incorporates videos
into the production, Gaieties dis
plays the talent and creativity of the
cast and crew through a vibrant
celebration of Stanford and all we
have to value and protect, against
all enemies. 101 years after the orig
inal production of Gaieties, Gaieties
2012 is just the hilarious school
spirited romp that the Big Game
tradition is meant to be.

Full disclosure: A Stanford
girl and a Cal guy kiss
through Skype, and then it's
your typical body swap story.
Except this is far more than your
typical "Freaky Friday" variation; in
fact, the only thing typical about
the 2012 Gaieties incarnation, "Full
Doom on the Quad" is its reliable
delivery of good laughs, quirky
characters and its adeptness at not
only tearing down our rival school
for their dirtiness and bad weather,
but making us laugh at our own oft
ridiculous campus culture through
self-referential jokes.
With campus-relevant jabs at
everything from our vocabulary of
acronyms to the fallibility of Axess
and the overzealousness of RAs and
PHEs, Gaieties plays like an extend
ed and dramatized "Shit Stanford
Students Say" video, without talk-
