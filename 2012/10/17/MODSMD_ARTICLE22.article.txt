# "Food & Liquor II" Brings FIASCO Full Circle
## 
### Elliot Williams | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Six years after "Lupe Fiasco's
Food & Liquor," it appears
things have come full circle
with his fourth studio album "Food
and Liquor II: The Great American
Rap Album Pt.l." The album is lyri
cally quite well written, his voice
flowing smoothly through different
sonic landscapes. Fiasco moves
steadily through a range of topics,
from issues of American interven
tion and oppression inside and out
side of our country in "Around My
Way (Freedom Ain't Free)" to pleas
for change directed towards youth
to escape the streets and bring abut
change in the community in
("ITAL (Roses)").
Musically, the album is less
ambitious than "Lupe Fiasco's The
Cool." It's easy to criticize the
album as a repackaging of the
themes from pervious records.
Aside from a few songs, the beats
are mostly comprised of electro
synth lines with a heavy bass line
on top of them, a different direc
tion from the piano and orchestral
beats of previous albums. That's
not to say that the music isn't good
it's just different. The beats are
well crafted but sometimes feel as if
they run into each other as multiple
synth-based songs strung together
without any breaks.
All in all the album is thought
provoking, and while critical of the
world, "Food and Liquor II" is also
evidence of Lupe's own inner strug
gles and turmoil. If you're a rap fan,
give the album a listen: if you don't
enjoy it, at least it will get you
thinking.
