## ESF offers frosh liberal education New program described as non-residential 'baby SLE' 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
"Do you think a liberal education
makes you happier?"
This might not be a typical ques
tion in many Stanford classrooms,
but it is in the new Education as Self-
Fashioning (ESF) seminar, "The
Active, Inquiring, Beautiful Mind,"
led by economics professor Caroline
Floxby.
The course is one of five intercon
nected seminars taught under the
ESF program, launched this fall
quarter for incoming freshmen. More
than 200 freshmen ranked ESF as
their first choice among courses that
fulfilled the Thinking Matters
requirement, making it one of the
most popular options. Each seminar
examines the purpose of liberal edu
cation, what it means to be educated
and how students can make the most
of their time at Stanford.
According to Hoxby, the idea of
ESF was born from last year's
breadth committee meetings for the
Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES) report, in which
faculty members expressed their
desire to offer a course that would
improve the freshman experience.
"It really grew out of people won
dering what would be an ideal course
if you were a first quarter freshman
and you wanted to spend your
Stanford career doing the things that
would benefit you the most," she
said.
Hoxby's seminar which she
teaches with her husband and
Stanford English professor Blair
Hoxby focuses on the idea of the
"self-made man." The course
addresses how people throughout
history, such as Thomas Jefferson and
Emperor Hadrian, viewed the role of
education and used education to bet
ter themselves.
Other ESF courses examine the
role of education, such as "Rigorous
and Precise Thinking" led by mathe
matics professor Ravi Vakil and "In
Pursuit of Knowledge, Justice and
Truth" led by classics profes
sor Richard Sailer.
Each class within the ESF
program consists of a semi
nar, a lecture series and sec
tion. Most seminars have two
sections with approximately
15 students each, and profes
sors meet with each section
at least once a week.
Students also receive guid
ance from writing instructors
who hold group and individ
ual meetings to help students
learn how to think and write
clearly.
Vakil said that the writing
aspect of the course is "essen
tial," as it enables students to
communicate their thoughts
to others.
"Making a clear argument
is important not just when
you've had your thought but
also to clarify your thinking,"
Vakil said, noting that it is par
ticularly important in his
course, as proof writing is
"central to mathematics."
Some freshmen said that
they were attracted to ESF
because it fulfills both the
Thinking Matters and PWR
requirements.
"I chose ESF because it
combined two of the require
ments," said Caroline Frost

'l6. "I actually didn't realize it
was completely about why a
liberal education is a good
thing."
Frost said that although
the seminar is "definitely
nothing like what [she]
expected," she feels it is
"expanding [her] horizons
and getting out of [her] com
fort zone."
Because the ESF program
focuses on a liberal educa
tion and counts for a signifi
cant number of units, stu
dents often compare it to the
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) program. However,
ESF lacks the residential
aspect of SLE and demands a
lesser time commitment.
"They say that ESF is baby
SLE," Christine Yeh 'l6 said,
who is taking Sailer's ESF
seminar. "I feel that I get all
the benefits of SLE without
having to put in all of my
time."
While SLE is fixed at
approximately 90 students per
year, ESF has 150 students
this year and Hoxby said the
program might grow to
accommodate more students.
According to Hoxby, a
larger course was the original
goal but the program was kept
small so professors could see
if there were any "moving
parts" that would make it dif
ficult to expand.

ESF sections are limited
to students in the course, but

all freshmen are invited to
attend the lecture series,
which is required for students
in the program. The series
brings visiting lecturers to
Stanford to "illustrate things
that we don't think are illus
trated by any of our courses,"
Hoxby said.
The next lecture will be
held on Nov. 2 from 12 p.m. to
1:30 p.m. in Hewlett 201.
Alexander Nehamas, philoso
phy and comparative litera
ture professor at Princeton,
will deliver a lecture titled "I
Would Rather Fashion My
Mind Than Furnish It."
According to associate
professor of philosophy
Lanier Anderson, who teach
es an ESF seminar, the lec
tures will "contribute to an
ongoing conversation on cam
pus about what our educa
tional goals are and should
be."
He noted that ESF stu
dents will be at the center of
this conversation and hopes
that they will encourage their
friends to attend the lectures,
a hope echoed by Hoxby.
"If I were a freshman, I
would love to go to lunch with
my friends afterward and say
'Wasn't that cool?' or 'Wasn't
that interesting?"' Hoxby
said. "Everyone is really wel
come."
