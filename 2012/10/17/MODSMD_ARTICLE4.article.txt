# STUDENT GROUPS
## Gaieties cast pressured by earliest Big Game ever 
### WINSTON SHI 
Gaieties, an annual performance put on by the Ram's
Head Theatrical Society on the week preceding Big
Game, has been affected by the Pac-12 football calendar,
which moved up the annual Stanford-Cal football game
by about a month this year. Chief among issues Gaieties
organizers have had to face are challenges in publicity
and recruiting, though, according to cast members, the
earlier performance date is not without its benefits as
well.
"Last year and in years past, Big Game has been in
mid-November, so typically we've [recruited] on campus
at the same time as other student groups," said Amanda
Hechinger 'l3, Gaieties co-writer and lead. "The only
challenge was getting adjusted to getting back on campus,
getting integrated in the academic schedule [with the
demands of] the Gaieties schedule right off the bat."
With performances starting only four weeks after the
beginning of the academic year, the pressure has been on

Gaieties organizers to publicize the show and recruit
freshmen actors within a much narrower time window.
The cast returned to campus ten days prior to the start of
the quarter and held rehearsals from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.
each day, according to Annika Graagard 'l2, the show's
vocal director.
"Everything has been really rushed," said Zipporah
Guerin 'l4, the show's producer.
Even with the earlier preparation time, Guerin wish
es that more could have been done in terms of marketing
the show's opening night.
"We're doing pretty much the regular stuff that we've
done: Facebook event, website, that kind of thing.
Unfortunately, I personally haven't had the time to have
crazy different marketing," she said.
The timing of Big Game week has taken a toll on the
cast, too.
"In terms of preparation, the cast has worked proba-

bly ten times harder this year
than they have in past years
because we've had a shorter time
schedule," Graangard said.
"When they were on campus
two weeks before school even
started, they were doing Gaieties
rehearsals from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m."
However, according to April
Gregory 'l3, a Gaieties cast
member, the intensive rehearsal
allowed the cast to make up for
the shorter timespan.
"I think we were really lucky
in being able to come back to
school early," she said. "We got

early housing and had basically a
full week where all we did was
work on Gaieties, so I don't think
the show has lost anything by
being earlier than normal."
While the cast believes the
final product will maintain the
same quality, the logistics were
changed to accommodate the
unusually early performance
schedule. Casting directors were
forced to hold auditions last
spring, instead of the customary
early fall recruitment period, and
wait for freshmen to arrive in
September.
"We got to know the fresh
men for two and a half three
weeks at this point, so obviously
not as well as we would have
liked," Hechinger said. "[But]
everyone has been organized so

well that we kept in touch over the
summer and kept the morale up."
Even with the challenges the
cast and crew have faced, the
performance day that targets
freshmen remains popular.
According to Guerin, the show's
"Freshman Night" — Wednesday
and "Greek Night" Friday
are sold out.

Even so, she admits that the
Big Game's unusual scheduling
has affected buzz about the
show.

"We aren't getting as much
interest as previous years, just
because I think a lot of people
don't even know that it's Big
Game week," she said.
