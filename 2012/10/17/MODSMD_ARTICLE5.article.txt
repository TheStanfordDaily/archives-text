## Partnership with Foothill in pilot phase Stanford evaluates future of programming with load colleges 
### SANJAY SIDDHANTI 
The Stanford Emeriti Council is cur
rently evaluating the future of a pilot pro
gram that placed Foothill Community
College students into internships at
Stanford laboratories. This pilot that began
in 2009 gave more than 30 Foothill stu
dents the opportunity to conduct science
and engineering research at Stanford.
Stanley Schrier, professor emeritus in
the School of Medicine, led the program in
conjunction with the Stanford Office of
Science Outreach. While Schrier said the
initiative is an example of Stanford being a
good neighbor to the community, he ques
tioned whether it is the best use of
University resources, pointing out that the
program only served 32 students out of
40,000 attending the community college.
"We have to think about it in a variety
of ways," Schrier said. "I think the students
who participated from Foothill benefited;
on the other hand, you have to think more
globally."
Approximately 80 students applied for
the program last academic year, but there
was not enough laboratory space to
accommodate all candidates, according to
Peter Murrary, dean of physical sciences,
mathematics and engineering at Foothill
Community College. He said 13 students
are currently in Stanford internships. No
new applicants are being recruited while
the program is under review.
"They [Foothill students in internships]
find it exhilarating," Murray said. "It gives
them a whole new perspective on science."
Both students and faculty mentors who
completed the program indicated that it
was a positive experience. Students who
completed a survey rated the program an
average of 2.78 out of 3 in terms of how
influential it was on their future endeav
ors. Faculty mentors also indicated that
they would consider participating again,
although some cited a lack of commitment
by the interns as a problem that should be
addressed in the future.
While the internship program was
designed for the benefit of Foothill
College students, the relationship between
the two institutions also has rewarding
aspects for Stanford, according to David
Abernethy, chair of the Emeriti Council
