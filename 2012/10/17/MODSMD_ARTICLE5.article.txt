## Partnership with Foothill in pilot phase Stanford evaluates future of programming with load colleges 
### SANJAY SIDDHANTI 
The Stanford Emeriti Council is cur
rently evaluating the future of a pilot pro
gram that placed Foothill Community
College students into internships at
Stanford laboratories. This pilot that began
in 2009 gave more than 30 Foothill stu
dents the opportunity to conduct science
and engineering research at Stanford.
Stanley Schrier, professor emeritus in
the School of Medicine, led the program in
conjunction with the Stanford Office of
Science Outreach. While Schrier said the
initiative is an example of Stanford being a
good neighbor to the community, he ques
tioned whether it is the best use of
University resources, pointing out that the
program only served 32 students out of
40,000 attending the community college.
"We have to think about it in a variety
of ways," Schrier said. "I think the students
who participated from Foothill benefited;
on the other hand, you have to think more
globally."
Approximately 80 students applied for
the program last academic year, but there
was not enough laboratory space to
accommodate all candidates, according to
Peter Murrary, dean of physical sciences,
mathematics and engineering at Foothill
Community College. He said 13 students
are currently in Stanford internships. No
new applicants are being recruited while
the program is under review.
"They [Foothill students in internships]
find it exhilarating," Murray said. "It gives
them a whole new perspective on science."
Both students and faculty mentors who
completed the program indicated that it
was a positive experience. Students who
completed a survey rated the program an
average of 2.78 out of 3 in terms of how
influential it was on their future endeav
ors. Faculty mentors also indicated that
they would consider participating again,
although some cited a lack of commitment
by the interns as a problem that should be
addressed in the future.
While the internship program was
designed for the benefit of Foothill
College students, the relationship between
the two institutions also has rewarding
aspects for Stanford, according to David
Abernethy, chair of the Emeriti Council
and professor emeritus of
political science.
"The more we get to know
about community colleges, the
more we can see how impor
tant they are in American soci
ety as away for upward mobil
ity," Abernethy said. "It is use
ful for Stanford... to learn
about the importance of com
munity colleges in American
life."

Anika Green, director of
educational programs in the
Office of the Vice Provost of
Graduate Education, said
there are additional benefits
that Stanford gains from its
relationship with Foothill.
Green oversees a program
called Diversifying Academia
Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
that serves advanced doctoral
students at Stanford who are
interested in pursuing aca
demic careers. DARE is a two
year fellowship, and one of the
activities is an all-day visit to

Foothill College, so fellows can
become acquainted with the
everyday aspects of a commu
nity college.
At this event, fellows inter
act with high-level administra
tors at Foothill and are
addressed by Foothill College
President Judy Miner. Green
cited two examples of
Stanford DARE fellows who
benefited from this interac
tion, including a law and doc
torate student who was able to
teach a class at Foothill for a
quarter and another student
who was offered a faculty posi
tion at Foothill after complet
ing the DARE fellowship.
"I think that there are fan
tastic students at community
colleges who end up there for
a range of reasons, and oppor
tunities for Stanford to engage
with them is advantageous for
the students at the community

college and also students here
at Stanford, so that they can
understand the experiences of
students from a different type
of institution," Green said.
Stanford also connects
with other local community
colleges, although the level is
involvement is lower.
Marisa Spatafore,
spokesperson at DeAnza
Community College in
Cupertino, wrote in an email
to The Daily that she does not
know of any existing partner
ship between Stanford and
DeAnza. However, she did
indicate that Stanford repre
sentatives have participated in
DeAnza's Transfer Day in the
past, and that some students
from DeAnza have trans
ferred to Stanford.

Stanford has a longer his
tory with Menlo College in
Atherton, according to the

school's spokesperson Darcy
Blake. Created in 1927, Menlo
was initially considered a pos
sible undergraduate school at
Stanford. The Stanford Board
of Trustees ruled against this in
the spring of 1932, resulting in
Menlo becoming an independ
ent four-year college.
Blake said that while a
research exchange program
with Stanford does not cur
rently exist, Menlo is working
on starting an internship pro
gram. Blake said she also sees
additions benefits in being
located near Stanford.
"Their draw for resources
that we could not otherwise
have is tremendous," she said.
"I think any time you are able
to collaborate, there is always
benefit in it."

"They [Foothill students in internships]
find it exhilarating," Murray said. "It gives
them a whole new perspective on science."
Both students and faculty mentors who
completed the program indicated that it
was a positive experience. Students who
completed a survey rated the program an
average of 2.78 out of 3 in terms of how
influential it was on their future endeav
ors. Faculty mentors also indicated that
they would consider participating again,
although some cited a lack of commitment
by the interns as a problem that should be
addressed in the future.
While the internship program was
designed for the benefit of Foothill
College students, the relationship between
the two institutions also has rewarding
aspects for Stanford, according to David
Abernethy, chair of the Emeriti Council
and professor emeritus of
political science.
"The more we get to know
about community colleges, the
more we can see how impor
tant they are in American soci
ety as away for upward mobil
ity," Abernethy said. "It is use
ful for Stanford... to learn
about the importance of com
munity colleges in American
life."

Anika Green, director of
educational programs in the
Office of the Vice Provost of
Graduate Education, said
there are additional benefits
that Stanford gains from its
relationship with Foothill.
Green oversees a program
called Diversifying Academia
Recruiting Excellence (DARE)
that serves advanced doctoral
students at Stanford who are
interested in pursuing aca
demic careers. DARE is a two
year fellowship, and one of the
activities is an all-day visit to

Foothill College, so fellows can
become acquainted with the
everyday aspects of a commu
nity college.
At this event, fellows inter
act with high-level administra
tors at Foothill and are
addressed by Foothill College
President Judy Miner. Green
cited two examples of
Stanford DARE fellows who
benefited from this interac
tion, including a law and doc
torate student who was able to
teach a class at Foothill for a
quarter and another student
who was offered a faculty posi
tion at Foothill after complet
ing the DARE fellowship.
"I think that there are fan
tastic students at community
colleges who end up there for
a range of reasons, and oppor
tunities for Stanford to engage
with them is advantageous for
the students at the community

college and also students here
at Stanford, so that they can
understand the experiences of
students from a different type
of institution," Green said.
Stanford also connects
with other local community
colleges, although the level is
involvement is lower.
Marisa Spatafore,
spokesperson at DeAnza
Community College in
Cupertino, wrote in an email
to The Daily that she does not
know of any existing partner
ship between Stanford and
DeAnza. However, she did
indicate that Stanford repre
sentatives have participated in
DeAnza's Transfer Day in the
past, and that some students
from DeAnza have trans
ferred to Stanford.

Stanford has a longer his
tory with Menlo College in
Atherton, according to the

school's spokesperson Darcy
Blake. Created in 1927, Menlo
was initially considered a pos
sible undergraduate school at
Stanford. The Stanford Board
of Trustees ruled against this in
the spring of 1932, resulting in
Menlo becoming an independ
ent four-year college.
Blake said that while a
research exchange program
with Stanford does not cur
rently exist, Menlo is working
on starting an internship pro
gram. Blake said she also sees
additions benefits in being
located near Stanford.
"Their draw for resources
that we could not otherwise
have is tremendous," she said.
"I think any time you are able
to collaborate, there is always
benefit in it."

The Stanford Emeriti Council is cur
rently evaluating the future of a pilot pro
gram that placed Foothill Community
College students into internships at
Stanford laboratories. This pilot that began
in 2009 gave more than 30 Foothill stu
dents the opportunity to conduct science
and engineering research at Stanford.
Stanley Schrier, professor emeritus in
the School of Medicine, led the program in
conjunction with the Stanford Office of
Science Outreach. While Schrier said the
initiative is an example of Stanford being a
good neighbor to the community, he ques
tioned whether it is the best use of
University resources, pointing out that the
program only served 32 students out of
40,000 attending the community college.
"We have to think about it in a variety
of ways," Schrier said. "I think the students
who participated from Foothill benefited;
on the other hand, you have to think more
globally."
Approximately 80 students applied for
the program last academic year, but there
was not enough laboratory space to
accommodate all candidates, according to
Peter Murrary, dean of physical sciences,
mathematics and engineering at Foothill
Community College. He said 13 students
are currently in Stanford internships. No
new applicants are being recruited while
the program is under review.
