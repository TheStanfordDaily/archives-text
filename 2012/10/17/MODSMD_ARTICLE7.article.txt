## GPS pioneer, wife pledge $28 million to University 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Liam Kinney 
James J. Spilker Jr. '55 M.S. '56 Ph.D.'sB, a
School of Engineering consulting professor and
central figure in the development of GPS, and
his wife Anna Marie Spilker, a real estate broker
and investor, have pledged $2B million to
Stanford University.
Hie couple's donation will name The James
and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied
Sciences Building in the Science and Engineering
Quad —providing researchers with the facilities
for atomic-scale research and endow a profes
sorship in the School of Engineering.
"Anna Marie and I believe strongly that
America's ability to compete in the 21st century
even more so than the 20th will depend
critically on our ability to innovate and excel in
science and engineering," Spilker told the
Stanford Report. "Many jobs of the past centu
ry are gone. This gift is an effort to ensure that
one of America's great research institutions
retains the leadership it has enjoyed for
decades."

Before joining the Stanford faculty in 2001
as a consulting professor of electrical engineer
ing and aeronautical/astronautical engineering,
Spilker played a critical role in developing the
Global Positioning System (GPS), authoring
and co-authoring several papers in the 1960s on
the signal timing technology that enables the
precision tracking of GPS satellites. Spilker later
worked on the GPS system's architecture and
signal structure, continuing that work up to 2005
when he co-founded the Stanford University
Center for Position, Navigation and Time.
Spilker has also enjoyed a distinguished
business career, including stints with AOSense
and Stanford Telecommunications, in which
as co-founder, CEO and chairman —he built
from three employees to more than 1,300 with
out resorting to venture capital funding. He
described the gift as a complement and expan
sion of the numerous opportunities already
available to current Stanford students.
"They have within their grasp the ability to
create technologies that can change the world
or to found new companies that can employ
thousands," Spilker told the Stanford Report.
"Most important, if they truly love what they do,
they have the key catalyst for success."
