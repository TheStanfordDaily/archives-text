## ASSU Senate delays talks on assault review policy 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
At the ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
sparsely attended Oct. 16 meeting, senators
agreed to delay debate over Stanford's
Alternative Review Policy (ARP) regarding
sexual assault, relationship violence and stalk
ing, until late October, discussed the potential
uses for the $1.2 million in the Senate's reserves
and buffer funds, and decided to set an informal
attendance policy.
Although senators Lauren Miller 'l5 and
Kimberly Bacon 'l5 noted at the Oct. 10
meeting that they hoped to begin discussions
on the ARP this week, Senate Chair Branden
Crouch 'l4 said the Senate should wait until
they hear student opinions at the Oct. 23 town
hall meeting.
After attending town hall meetings and hav
ing their own discussions, the Senate plans to
either approve or revise the ARP, which was
extended indefinitely by University President
John Hennessy last spring after a two-year pilot
program.
"We want the student body to voice their
concerns and get a chance to understand what is
going on before we bring it into the Senate,"
Crouch said. "We decided to push it back so
everyone can have a chance to understand the
issues."
At the suggestion of Deputy Chair Garima
Sharma 'l5, the Senate discussed the creation of
an attendance policy. Senators agreed to allow
three absences per quarter, two excused and one
unexcused, but argued about what constitutes
an excused absence. The Undergraduate Senate
typically meets eight times per quarter. Only 10
senators were present at this week's meeting;
the Senate now has 14 members after unani
mously voting to expel Ashley Harris 'l5 from
the Senate this week after Harris announced her
leave of absence.
The new unofficial policy would conflict with
the Undergraduate Senate (US) bylaws, as
Article 2 Section ID states: "In the event that
any member of the US misses three meetings in
a quarter, a bill for expulsion must be presented
to the US at the meeting(s) following the third
absence."
According to Sharma, this attendance policy
would not be a binding policy but would provide

a framework for discussion if a senator misses
more than the permitted number of meetings.
Senator fsh Menjivar 'l5 said that it would be
"ideal to have 100 percent attendance," and
questioned whether the new unofficial policy
would help.
"I hope it will improve, but I'm not sure how
much the policy change about it would improve
it," Menjivar said, noting that absences make it
"hard to get things done."
According to Kimberly Bacon 'l5, seven
senators attended an "ASSU Money 101" pres
entation on Oct. 15 by ASSU Financial Manager
Neveen Mahmoud 'll and Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3. The presenta
tion was referenced several times at the Oct. 16
Senate meeting.
Senators expressed interest in learning more
about the Senate's reserve and buffer funds. The
senate controls reserves that are composed of
student fees unspent by previous Senates or stu
dent groups.
The buffer fund, which has been used in the
past to provide additional coverage in times of
financial crisis and special fees mistakes, "exists
to give the Senate an option in case unexpected
things happen with the [ASSU] fee," according
to Trusheim. These may include a drop in stu
dent enrollment, which would affect the amount
of money collected by the ASSU.
The Undergraduate Senate currently con
trols $697,052 in total fee reserves and $465,910
in the buffer fund. Trusheim wrote in an email to
The Daily that the senators will have the oppor
tunity in the future to determine the manage
ment of these funds, though he and Mahmoud
will advise the senators on leaving enough
money in the funds "to ensure that the ASSU
can keep functioning properly."
"We don't have any specific uses planned out
for the buffer fund, but we think it's a good idea
to have more specific guidelines for how to use
the buffer fund and the money in the reserves,
not just for us but for people next year," Bacon
said. "I think one of the reasons people never
use this money is that they don't know what it is
for."
Senators approved funding bills totaling
$13,842.41 for various student groups. Latinos
Unidos de Stanford received
$3,619.41 and the Stanford
Pre-Law Society received
$5,582 for event food and
supplies. Miller, a member of

the pre-law society, excused
herself from voting for the lat

ter bill.
The Senate also heard a
report by Mahmoud discussing
Stanford Student Enterprises'
quarterly report and passed a
bill written by ASSU Elections
Commissioner Brianna Pang
'13 to set the date for the 2013
spring quarter general elec
tion for April 11.
