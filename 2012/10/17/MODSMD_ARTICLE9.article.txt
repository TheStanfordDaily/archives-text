Gaieties is an annual student
written musical comedy staged
by the Ram's Head Theatrical
Society. It is traditionally per
formed on the week before
Stanford's Big Game against UC-Berkeley
and is known for being cheeky, silly, irrever
ent and sometimes offensive.

1911 Originally named "Football Follies,"
Gaieties was introduced as a rally for the
Stanford-Cal rugby game. A Daily Palo Alto,
the newspaper which became The Stanford
Daily, article called the "Follies of Stanford"
a two and a half hour long "continuous
vaudeville." The article read, "Every possible
excuse will be used to make the Show a rush
of comedy and music" ("Program in
Surprises in 'Follies of Stanford,'" Oct. 13).

1928 The event was taken over by Ram's
Head Theatrical Society, who changed its
name to "Big Game Gaieties." The show
opened the night before Big Game. In the
Nov. 23 issue of The Daily, show director
Gordon Davis 'lB said, "With the breaks in
their favor, the Football Gaieties Team
should play one of the best games tonight
Stanford has ever seen" ("Ram's Head
Society offers 'Big Game Gaieties of 1928'
tonight," Nov. 23).

1933 A handbill for the 1933 Gaieties said:
"All of the important dramatic talent of the
Stanford campus will be seen in original satir
ical sketches, songs and specialty acts, aug
mented by a dancing chorus of 24 specimens
of feminine pulchritude. Cast of 100"
("Gaieties: the show everyone's been waiting
for," Nov. 15,1977).

1937 After Memorial Auditorium was dedicat
ed in 1937, Gaieties moved production and has
performed at the location ever since. The Nov.
17 issue of The Daily reported that Hollywood
talent scouts would be attending the show and
that former Gaieties stars Winstead "Doodles"
Weaver '35 and Lloyd Nolan '26 were
already under Hollywood contracts.

1968 The show was not produced for the
first time since 1911 due to misunderstand
ings between the writers and producers cou
pled with a highly politicized campus climate.

Ram's Head Theatrical Society was declared
bankrupt and closed. In place of the tradi
tional Gaieties, performance group Mafia
presented the comedy "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum" in
Memorial Auditorium.

1976 Toyon residents revived the tradition
and Ram's Head Theatrical Society
reopened.

1977 Producer Keith Light '7B said of the
1977 show: "This will be a valid Gaieties. It
may add a dimension other Gaieties haven't
seen or been yet. And it may upset intellectu
als who think it's childish, but it's pure fun
for all students," ("Gaieties: the show every
one's been waiting for," Nov. 15). The show
was the first to feature a campus figure
cameo Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon crossed the Gaieties stage this
year. "It was rude, awful, but boy was it
great," one student said in reaction ("Big
Game Week: A school spirit revival," Nov.
21).

2000 University President John Hennessy
made his first appearance at Gaieties in a play
titled "Being John Hennessey" in which he is kid
napped and Stanford is overtaken by the evil
"Kal." In 2000, The Daily reported that Gaieties
was no longer able to use the Drama
Department's shop space to build scenery and
now depended on sponsorships to provide funds
for the production.

2010 36 Ujaama residents walked out of the
Gaieties performance due to stereotype-based
humor they found offensive, prompting a review
from Ram's Head Theatrical Society about the
content in the show. Yvorn Aswad-Thomas 'll,
then resident assistant (RA) of Ujamaa, was ref
erenced in The Daily article pointing to the offen
sive "portrayals of Native Americans as visibly
intoxicated and an ad-libbed line about dressing
up for a party as 'Rosa Parks black'" ("Ujamaa
staff and residents walk out of Gaieties, two
groups schedule talks," Dec. 1).

2011 Gaieties celebrated its 100 th year with a
play titled "Leland Junior Must Die" and pro
moted the play with massively popular trailer.

2012 Gaieties, titled "Full Doom on the Quad,"
will take place on Oct. 17,18 and 19 at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
