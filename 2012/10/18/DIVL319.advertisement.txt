Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
Stanford Multidisciplinary Multimedia Meeting of Arts,
Science, and Humanities (SMMMASH): SPACE
\
Thursday, October 18
Art exhibit: 6:30 - 9:00 pm
Panel: 7:00 - 8:30 pm
Cubberley Auditorium
School of Education
Stanford University
Free and open to public
Over the years, artists, scientists, engineers, and
humanities scholars have explored the grand themes
that define the human condition from radically different
perspectives. Too infrequently, they are given the
opportunity to listen to each other and engage in
conversations that cross boundaries and mix up
categories. In the 2011-12 academic year, we began
the series "An Interdisciplinary Tour of the Human Mind,"
aimed at rectifying this situation. This year, we will
continue the series under a new title: SMMMASH. These
programs will feature some of the most exciting thinkers
in the Bay Area. Panelists for the "Space" event include:
Chris McKay, Planetary Scientist, Anne Fougeron,
Architect, George Legrady, Professor of Interactive
Media, L/C Santa Barbara, and Piero Scaruffi, Moderator.
To complement the panel, artists from different media
genres will exhibit works that relate to "Space" in the
lobby of the auditorium.
