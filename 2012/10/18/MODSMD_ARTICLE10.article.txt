## SIC program expanding due to rise in applications Number of program coordinators, size of faculty committee increase 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
The directors of the Student Initiated
Courses (SIC) program increased the number
of program coordinators and the overseeing
faculty committee this year to address the rise
in applications received so far.
SIC a student-led program that allows
students, with a faculty adviser to create and
teach their own courses for up to 20 students
will close applications for new courses pro
posals today. Program Director Ernestine Fu
'l3 already expects more courses this year than
last year.

"I would say that we want to keep the
number of courses at 15 maximum, but we are
not going to reject an application based on a
quota," Fu said. Last year the group received
just below 50 applications.
Along with the rise in applications this

year, a new change to the program requires
student teachers to attend three workshops
instead of two led by the Center for
Teaching and Learning. The workshops pro
vide students with professional training that
helps them develop their courses, create a syl
labus and develop public speaking skills.
"These are the same workshops that
Stanford professors themselves have to go
through, and so do course assistants and teach
ing assistants," Fu said. "1 think that it's impor
tant."

Although the faculty committee that selects
and reviews the applications for SIC encour
aged a mechanism for students to provide feed
back at the end of each class session, Fu said
such a system has not been established yet.
"There isn't really a formal process for
having student-initiated course leaders get
together and actually collaborate with one
another," she said. "But it is required to have a
faculty adviser, someone who's on staff and
teaches at Stanford, who they can work with to
ensure that the class is going well."
While Fu acknowledged the recommenda

tion for an established feedback system, she
also recognized that the current freedom pro
vided by SIC is what attracts students, includ
ing her, to the program.
Before becoming program director, Fu ini
tiated a course on entrepreneurship last winter
called The Startup Workshop:
Entrepreneurship through the Lens of Venture
Capital, which allowed her students to interact
with high-profile individuals such as Evan
Williams, co-founder of Blogger and Twitter.
Fu's experience working at a venture capi
tal firm motivated her to create a class where
students could discuss current issues that start
ups were facing in a more intimate environ
ment, as in introductory seminars.
A.J. Sugarman 'l4, who taught The U.S.
Military and International Security with
Matthew Colford 'l4, was also inspired to lead
his course after seeing the value of the pro
gram. Both Sugarman and Colford took the
class in their freshman year and offered to
teach it the following year.
"I really felt that the SIC program offered
away to both address a gap in the Stanford

curriculum the dearth of courses covering
the military and to take advantage of a
largely untapped resource, the military fellows
at [the Hoover Institution] and [the Center for
International Security and Cooperation],"
Sugarman explained.
Faculty advisers also believe in the benefits
of the program.
Jody Maxmin, associate professor of clas
sics and art and art history, spoke highly of
Beginner Ceramics, for which she has served as
the faculty adviser since its inception in the
spring of 2011. As a faculty adviser, she
believes her role to be minimal and regards the
student teachers as young colleagues.
"I am so deeply impressed and touched by
the way these students, without any supervi
sion ... contributed heart and soul to teach
pottery on campus," she said. "These classes
are taught by enthusiastic, smart undergradu
ates It's more than I thought would ever
happen."
