## Big Game worth the price 
### Joseph Beyda 
I am big on Big Game traditions.
Every year, I exclusively wear
Stanford shirts the week before
the game; every year, I embark
on a misguided quest to teach
everyone I know the lyrics to "The
Dirty Golden Bear"; every year, I visit
the Axe one last time, just in case.
But my favorite tradition only takes
place every two years.

For the last seven road Big Games,
my dad and I have hopped on BART
at Union City for the ride to Berkeley.
Station by station, the trains are col
ored red a deep cardinal mind you,
not the fountain fuchsia currently
planted between Hoover Tower and
MemAud. We all playfully ignore the
blue and gold speckled in our midst.
We're a tense brotherhood in this calm
before the storm; we chatter of 1982
and 1990, Oski and the Tree, last
minute injuries and last-minute field
goals.

Once we're off the train, this pseu
do-pack hikes uphill to the game, ready
for the chance to embarrass the Bears
their home turf, to watch the disgust on
Cal fans' faces as they stream out of
Memorial Stadium in the third quarter.
Of course, it doesn't always go that
way. Stanford football's recent road
woes are shared by yours truly; my 7-7
Big Game record includes an unac
ceptable 3-4 clip at Memorial Stadium.
But those three wins are perhaps my
three most distinct football memories,
even though two, both of them close
games, bookended losing seasons and
the third, a blowout, was hardly an
unexpected triumph.

The 1998 Big Game is the first
sporting event that I remember attend
ing. We won, and even five-year-old
Joey knew that meant that all was right
in the world. (As Stanford was making
its Rose Bowl run the next season, I
astutely asked, "Daddy, weren't we
really good last year too?" We had
gone 3-8.)

Fast-forward to 2000, and we were
again sitting in the corner of the end
zone, this time with a classic on our
hands. The Card had blocked two
punts and scored one of the best touch
downs I have seen to this day Luke
Powell faked like he was going out of
bounds to avoid tacklers, only to tiptoe
75 yards further down the sideline for
the score but regulation ended with
the score knotted at 30.

I didn't quite understand the over
time procedure, but at that point it was
just four years old in college football so
most other fans weren't used to it
either. Cal took the field first, stalled
and kicked a field goal wide!
only to have the play called back on a
false start. I can't remember another
penalty called against the other team
that I've been upset about.
The Bears, of course, missed their
second attempt, meaning a Stanford
score would spell sudden victory. The
Bears, of course, expected conservative
play calling from Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. The Cardinal, of
course, called play-action on second
down, and Randy Fasani found Casey
Moore open a few area codes behind
the Cal defense for the touchdown.
That would become the most reen
acted play in the history of the Beyda
backyard, and the first of many
Stanford play-actions that I have had
occasion to cheer for. But more impor
tantly, for that one moment on Nov. 18,
2000, a downcast Memorial Stadium
was overpowered by a little sliver of
euphoria: ours.
All good things must come to an
end, however, and our next trip to
Berkeley saw the Cardinal's seven
year Big Game streak the longest in
the series history snapped in con
vincing fashion. It would be 10 more
years before Stanford won across the
Bay.
And that win would resoundingly
make up for those 10 years. The 2010
blowout was such an emotional high,
most of us were laughing with joy
when Stanford took a 31-0 first-half
lead. Andrew Luck leveling a Bears
defender on a 58-yard run was the per
fect tonic for nearly a decade of suffer
ing through losing seasons.
We may have waved the Cal fans
out of their own stadium that day, but
who knows what to expect Saturday
afternoon. Last year's three-point
escape proves that better than any
thing, and Stanford is only favored by a
few points this year. Big Game always
can and likely will, at different
points Saturday go either way.
But it's worth the risk, worth the
price for student tickets. There's no bet
ter feeling than beating Cal, at Cal. If
you're lucky, you get to do it every two
years, and no, TV doesn't count.
I don't care what it takes; pay the
$65, scalp tickets at the gate,
steal them from a friend that

goes to Berkeley (having such a
friend is already a punishable
offense). Get to the game
Saturday, and most importantly,
beat Call

Joseph Bey da is just as astute
today as he was 14 years ago,

recently telling anyone who
would listen that Stepfan
Taylor did not get into the end
zone last week. Email him the
