# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## AIMING HIGHER CARD SETS EYES ON NCAA BID 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Success brings many things, some positive, some
negative. It has the power to inspire and motivate,
elevating a team's play, but also the ability to create
unnecessary stress and pressure. For head coach
Johnny Dawkins and his Stanford Cardinal men's
basketball team, it has brought one thing in particu
lar: higher expectations.

Stanford ended an up-and-down season on a
high note last year, bringing home the school's sec
ond ever National Invitational Tournament (NIT)
title. After an early exit in the Pac-12 tournament
against an overpowering UCLA Bruin squad,
Stanford went on an improbable run in the NIT, tak
ing home the title for the first time since 1991.

The 2011-12 season saw the Cardinal reach new
heights under Dawkins' leadership, recording its
highest win total since he was hired after the 2007-08
season. Additionally, Stanford managed to win more
games in March (seven) than ever before, hitting its
stride just in time for postseason play.
This season, the Card will look to build on last
year's success, reaching new heights and, ultimately,
an NCAA tournament bid. Stanford has not been rel
evant on a national level since Brook Lopez (draft
ed 10th overall) and twin brother Robin (drafted
15th overall) left for the NBA in 2008. Following a
grueling offseason, the Cardinal's season tipped off
this past Friday at Maples Pavilion, where the team
had its first official practice of the year.
Stanford's roster remained relatively intact over
the summer, as many of the key pieces from the
2011-12 campaign returned for another year.
Despite losing starting power forward Josh Owens,
the team's leading rebounder who recently signed
with Charlotte Bobcats as a free agent, along with
bench players Andrew Zimmermann and Jack
Trotter to graduation, much of the Card's nucleus
returns this season. This is highlighted by the star
studded backcourt of sophomore Chasson Randle
and junior Aaron Bright. The duo wreaked havoc on
opposing defenses last year, averaging 13.8 and 11.7
points, respectively, to lead the team.
Dawkins was impressed enough with their play
from last season, as well as their outstanding work
ethic throughout the summer, to name them cap
tains of the team. The pair will look to lead the way
for Stanford this season, as the Cardinal pursues a
title in the wide-open Pac-12 conference.
Also returning for the Card are forwards
Anthony Brown, Josh Huestis and Dwight Powell.
Huestis set the tone defensively for Stanford last
season, recording a team-leading 1.2 blocks per

game. Brown was a weapon both slashing to the bas
ket and from beyond the arc. The junior knocked
down 42 3-pointers for Stanford last season, a num
ber that he will surely be looking to improve on in
2012. Additionally, Brown's 8.1 points per game was
enough for fourth on the team, behind Randle,
Bright and Owens.

Powell, a fellow junior, will be another integral
part of Stanford's campaign this season. At 6 feet 9
inches, Powell will use his height, quickness and

overall athleticism to dominate opposing forwards
in the paint once again. With another year under
their belts, these three juniors will look to contribute
to Stanford's offensive attack and defensive
prowess.

The Cardinal has an unusually difficult noncon
ference schedule this season to kick off the season,
something that the team views as an opportunity to

make a statement early on. The first stretch of the
season includes games against Belmont, Missouri,

N.C. State and Northwestern.
However, the Card's season kicks off for the
Stanford fans this Friday, Oct. 19, when Stanford
plays its annual Cardinal-White scrimmage at 6 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. It'll be a good opportunity to see
if the squad is ready to make some noise on a
national level for the first time since 2008.

season, recording a team-leading 1.2 blocks per

game. Brown was a weapon both slashing to the bas
ket and from beyond the arc. The junior knocked
down 42 3-pointers for Stanford last season, a num
ber that he will surely be looking to improve on in
2012. Additionally, Brown's 8.1 points per game was
enough for fourth on the team, behind Randle,
Bright and Owens.

Powell, a fellow junior, will be another integral
part of Stanford's campaign this season. At 6 feet 9
inches, Powell will use his height, quickness and

overall athleticism to dominate opposing forwards
in the paint once again. With another year under
their belts, these three juniors will look to contribute
to Stanford's offensive attack and defensive
prowess.

The Cardinal has an unusually difficult noncon
ference schedule this season to kick off the season,
something that the team views as an opportunity to

make a statement early on. The first stretch of the
season includes games against Belmont, Missouri,

N.C. State and Northwestern.
However, the Card's season kicks off for the
Stanford fans this Friday, Oct. 19, when Stanford
plays its annual Cardinal-White scrimmage at 6 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion. It'll be a good opportunity to see
if the squad is ready to make some noise on a
national level for the first time since 2008.

Junior forward Josh Huestis (24) and the Stanford men's basketball squad boast plenty of
returning veterans and emerging talent as they hope to build on last year's NIT championship.
