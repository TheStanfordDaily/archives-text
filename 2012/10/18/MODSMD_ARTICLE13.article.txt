## Tough weekend ahead Teams ready for tourneys 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Entering its final tournament of
the fall season, the women's golf
team hopes to build on its recent
third-place finish at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational. The men's
team, on the other hand, is hoping
to erase the past with a good finish
at this weekend's U.S. Collegiate
Championship, hosted by Georgia
Tech. The No. 23 Cardinal men
struggled at the Pac-12 Preview, fin
ishing eighth in a field of 12, a full 32
shots behind Cal, the nation's top
ranked team.
"The team didn't play their best,
but we are still getting back into the
groove," senior Steven Kearney
said. "Cal is having a really good
season so far. We have just as much
talent as they do, if not more. We
just need to put it all together."
Sophomore Patrick Grimes
attributed the team's disappointing
finish to difficulties with their short
game.
"We didn't quite get everyone
playing well at the same time," he
said. "For the most part, I think we
struggled a little bit around the
greens.... So that was kind of our
big focus heading into our next
tournament."
While the men's team trav
els across the country, the No.
26 women's team will host the
Stanford Intercollegiate start
ing this Friday.
"It's not only our home
tournament, but it's our last
tournament of the fall, so we
definitely want to finish strong,"
junior Danielle Frasier said.
"We've been getting better
every week, and we've seen our
scores go down, so I think we're
all just really looking forward to
playing on our home turf"
Senior star Sally Watson,
who finished second in last
week's tournament, said that
team members must continue
to play competitively during the
offseason in order to maintain
momentum and avoid a slow
start to the spring season.
If they do manage to main
tain that momentum, this group
has the potential to surpass the
achievements of last year's
team, which tied for sth in the
NCAA Western Regionals
before finishing 24th at the
NCAA Championships.
Thanks to her recent strong
finish, Watson is Golfweek's
top-ranked golfer, and highly
touted freshmen Mariah
Stackhouse and Lauren Kim
are working their way up the
rankings as well. Only two tour
naments into their college
careers, they are ranked 57th
and 165 th, respectively.
Sophomore MarikoTumangan,
an honorable mention All-Pac
-12 selection last year, should
also be a force for the team this

season.
Watson said the team has
been practicing well.
"We've had a lot of rounds
recently in qualifying where
two or three girls have been
under par, and if we can bring
that into a tournament, then
we're going to start to compete
with the best," she said. "We're
definitely very close."
Tumangan agreed with
Watson's assessment of the
team's potential.
"I think that we obviously
didn't do as great as we had
hoped in Tennessee [where the
Cardinal finished 11th], but we
definitely played better in
Washington, and that wasn't
even [reaching our] full poten
tial," she said. "We definitely
have a large chance to win [at
the Stanford Intercollegiate this
weekend]."

The men's team also sees
itself as a contender. Players
will have the chance to prove
themselves in this weekend's
U.S. Collegiate Championship,
a high profile tournament with
a competitive field.
"We really need to make an
effort with shooting lower
scores on the first day,"
Kearney said. "It seems that we
fall behind and have to play
catch-up a lot in our previous
tournaments."

Seven of the nation's top 20
teams will compete this week
end, including No. 3 Washington

and No. 4 Southern California.
Both of those teams beat
Stanford by more than 20 shots
in the Pac-12 Preview.
"I think it's good prepara
tion to go up against teams
that we'll be competing
against all year, hopefully for a
national title, and then also get
some experience on a tough
[course], just like we're going
to see later on in the year,"
Grimes said.
The Cardinal will benefit
from the return of junior
Cameron Wilson, out with a
back injury for the start of the
fall season. Wilson finished the
spring season on a high note,
qualifying for June's U.S. Open.
Accompanying Wilson to
Georgia will be Boote,
Kearney, freshman Dominick
Francks and sophomore stand
out Patrick Rodgers, who has
already won a tournament this
season. In the Oct. 15 Golfweek
rankings, Boote was ranked No.
10 in the nation, while Rodgers
was ranked ninth.
"As long as we get everyone
playing well, we can compete
with all of the best teams in the
country," Grimes said. "With as
good as some of them are, we
are definitely going to have to
play some really good golf, but
it's definitely something that
we're capable of."
