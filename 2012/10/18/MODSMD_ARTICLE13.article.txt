## Tough weekend ahead Teams ready for tourneys 
### AUSTIN BLOCK STAFF WRITER 
Entering its final tournament of
the fall season, the women's golf
team hopes to build on its recent
third-place finish at the Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational. The men's
team, on the other hand, is hoping
to erase the past with a good finish
at this weekend's U.S. Collegiate
Championship, hosted by Georgia
Tech. The No. 23 Cardinal men
struggled at the Pac-12 Preview, fin
ishing eighth in a field of 12, a full 32
shots behind Cal, the nation's top
ranked team.
"The team didn't play their best,
but we are still getting back into the
groove," senior Steven Kearney
said. "Cal is having a really good
season so far. We have just as much
talent as they do, if not more. We
just need to put it all together."
Sophomore Patrick Grimes
attributed the team's disappointing
finish to difficulties with their short
game.
"We didn't quite get everyone
playing well at the same time," he
said. "For the most part, I think we
struggled a little bit around the
greens.... So that was kind of our
big focus heading into our next
tournament."
