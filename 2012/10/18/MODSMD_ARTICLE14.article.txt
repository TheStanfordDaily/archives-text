# Pac-12 lead is up (for grabs
## Huskies always play tough 
### ELIZA THOMPSON 
The women's volleyball team takes
their 13-game winning streak on the road
to Seattle this week, where they will face
against the Washington in an important
Pac-12 contest. Not only is No. 2 Stanford's
winning streak at risk, but the Cardinal's
position as top dog in the Pac-12 is also at
stake.
After convincing performances last
week, with victories over defending
national champions UCLA and No. 7
USC, Stanford (16-2,8-0 Pac-12) will face
another formidable challenge in the fifth
ranked Huskies. It won't help that the
Cardinal will be on the road for the first
time in four games, missing the home
advantage that Maples Pavilion provides.
Washington (16-1,7-1) will be looking
to redeem themselves after their first loss
of the season to No. 3 Oregon last week.
The Huskies, who were ranked No. 2 prior
to their loss, will be looking to repeat last
year's home victory over the Cardinal and
reestablish themselves as the leaders of the
Pac-12.
Stanford, on the other hand, hopes to
extend their winning streak and perfect
Pac-12 record, potentially gaining the
much-sought-after spot on top of the
national ranking should No. 1 Penn State
slip up. Stanford also has history on its side,
having won 47 out of 58 total meetings
with Washington.
It won't be easy against a hungry


VERONICA CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
Freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess (23) and the Stanford
women's volleyball team look to knock off Washington in a
critical Pac- 12 match and keep their 13-game win streak alive.
