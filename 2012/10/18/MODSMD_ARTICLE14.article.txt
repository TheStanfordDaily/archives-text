# Pac-12 lead is up (for grabs
## Huskies always play tough 
### ELIZA THOMPSON 
The women's volleyball team takes
their 13-game winning streak on the road
to Seattle this week, where they will face
against the Washington in an important
Pac-12 contest. Not only is No. 2 Stanford's
winning streak at risk, but the Cardinal's
position as top dog in the Pac-12 is also at
stake.
After convincing performances last
week, with victories over defending
national champions UCLA and No. 7
USC, Stanford (16-2,8-0 Pac-12) will face
another formidable challenge in the fifth
ranked Huskies. It won't help that the
Cardinal will be on the road for the first
time in four games, missing the home
advantage that Maples Pavilion provides.
Washington (16-1,7-1) will be looking
to redeem themselves after their first loss
of the season to No. 3 Oregon last week.
The Huskies, who were ranked No. 2 prior
to their loss, will be looking to repeat last
year's home victory over the Cardinal and
reestablish themselves as the leaders of the
Pac-12.
Stanford, on the other hand, hopes to
extend their winning streak and perfect
Pac-12 record, potentially gaining the
much-sought-after spot on top of the
national ranking should No. 1 Penn State
slip up. Stanford also has history on its side,
having won 47 out of 58 total meetings
with Washington.
It won't be easy against a hungry


VERONICA CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
Freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess (23) and the Stanford
women's volleyball team look to knock off Washington in a
critical Pac- 12 match and keep their 13-game win streak alive.
Washington team, one is now tied with
the Ducks for second in the Pac-12
standings and features a dominant
front line. The Huskies lead the nation
in blocks, and showed off their prowess
with a huge blocking night against the
Ducks that featured 19 blocks. For
Stanford to have success against
Washington's dominant blocking, they
must capitalize on dynamic offense
and powerful middle hitting from jun
ior middle blocker Carly Wopat.
Middle blocker Inky Ajanaku,
recently named the Pac-12 Freshman
of the Week, and sophomore libero
Kyle Gilber, Pac-12 Defensive Player
of the Week, will also be critical in the
Cardinal's success. Ajanaku recorded
a career-high 12 kills and six blocks
against USC, only to surpass it and
set a new career high against UCLA
two days later with 17 kills and 7
blocks.

If Ajanaku the No. 2 recruit in
the nation out of high school can
continue the momentum and keep
improving, Stanford should see success
against Washington. But in order for
Stanford to be effective against
Washington, they need to outplay
Washington at their own game by hav
ing a huge blocking night of their own
against the Huskies' attack.
Part of Washington's success this
season is due to Cassie Strickland's
massive hitting power. Strickland, a
five-foot-eight freshman, has been a
surprise addition to Washington's line
up and has provided game-changing
moments already this season, stopping
ULCA from winning on match point
before helping Washington come back
and beat the Bruins with several clutch
kills.

Strickland, who picked Washington
over other powerhouse programs like
Penn State, has been a key in almost
every win for the Huskies. She and sen
ior middle blocker Amanda Gil, who is
second in the Pac-12 in blocks, form a
tough one-two punch inside and out
side.

Setter Katy Beals must also be
accounted for. Beals leads the Pac-12
in service aces, and the Cardinal will
have to be careful not to get caught
sleeping on defense against Beal's
serving power.
Stanford will also face off against
Washington State during their trip up
north. The Cougars have yet to win a
game within the Pac-12, but Stanford
seems an unlikely candidate for their
first victory. The Cardinal beat the
Cougars both at home and away last
season, and Washington State has not
beat Stanford since 2002.
The Cardinal's games against both
the Huskies and Cougars will be tele
vised on the Pac-12 Networks, making
the network once again the center
stage in the volleyball world this week
end: Five of the top even teams in the
country are playing in the conference.
Whoever emerges from the weekend
unscathed will have the inside track to
one of the top seeds in both the Pac-12
and NCAA Tournaments.
