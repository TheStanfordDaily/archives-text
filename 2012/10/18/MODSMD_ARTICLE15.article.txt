## THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY The
						perils of prison privatization 
### Adam Johnson 
Privatization of traditionally pub
lic services, like national defense
and education, is becoming ever
more common in America.
Privatization is often relatively harm
less: Outsourcing highway mainte
nance to private firms, for instance,
can help balance budgets and trim
down bloated administrations.
Privatization may even be beneficial:
Perhaps private schools are on the
whole detrimental to society, but they
can at least design curriculums that
would be unthinkable in their public
counterparts. In other instances,
though, privatization can harm our
most fundamental rights.

Consider, for instance, the private
prison industry, which has grown by
350 percent in the last 15 years.
Private prisons seem fine in theory:
They contract with state and federal
governments to receive a daily or
monthly rate for each prisoner, there
by freeing government from the
responsibility of managing burden
some prisons and their populations.
In practice, however, the system is
highly flawed. First and foremost, pri
vate prisons do not profit from the
quality of their service. Instead, they
profit from how many beds they can
fill. To increase revenues and decrease
costs, then, private prisons will gener
ally sacrifice the quality of the prison
at the expense of those inside.

There is no incentive to offer
rehabilitation services; in fact, the pri
vate prison is better off when released
prisoners find their way back. As one
federal prison guard wrote in the
comment section of a New York
Times article, "I meet with virtually
every new inmate who arrives. I can
always tell which ones came from pri
vate, for-profit prisons, because they
are so happy to be here that they are
practically kissing the ground."
The problems do not end there.
Some officials, most notably former
Tennessee Governor and current
Senator Lamar Alexander, accrue

sizeable financial gains by investing in
prison corporations while in office.
Since their revenue is tied to the num
ber of prisoners they house, it means
pushing for harsher laws and sentenc
ing, regardless of whether or not these
are beneficial to society. Because
these corporations can thanks to
the Citizens United decision spend
unlimited amounts of money on polit
ical campaigns, politicians and public
officials will often give weight to their
demands.

Sometimes there is even blatant
corruption. In 2011, two Pennsylvania
judges were convicted of accepting
almost $3 million in kickbacks from
two privately-run juvenile detention
centers. In exchange, they closed
down the existing public facility and
sent approximately 4,000 children to
the two private detention centers. In
about 30 percent of these cases, the
children did not have a lawyer pres
ent and were not advised of their
right to counsel. Is that justice?
Given the problems already pres
ent in our prison system over
crowding, high rates of recidivism,
sentencing disparities based on race
or ethnicity, nonviolent offenders
serving life sentences and many oth
ersâ€” we should not open the door
for more injustices to occur. The pri
vatization of prisons does exactly that
by sacrificing the fundamental rights
of our citizenry in the name of profit
and economic efficiency.
