# READY FOR THE BIG SPLASH
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford (8-3,2-1 MPSF) makes a
visit to Berkeley's Spieker Aquatics
Complex this Saturday for the Big
Splash with a chance to drop the
Golden Bears to 0-3 in conference
play. With a win, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal would also have its first
three-game winning streak of the sea
son.
On Sunday, Stanford makes the
trip to Santa Clara for the annual
Rodeo Tournament, where it will face
unranked Bucknell and N0.13 Air
Force.
Stanford is looking to build on its
most successful weekend of the sea
son, in which the Card shut down the
up-and-coming No. 2 UC-Santa
Barbara Gauchos before decisively
taking care of business against eighth
ranked Pepperdine.
The victories were Stanford's first
and second wins of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play, and they put
Stanford back in title contention. The
much-needed wins came a week after
No.l USC dealt the Cardinal a
demoralizing loss to open the regular
season.
"We have a lot of momentum
going into this weekend for the Big
Splash," said senior driver Travis Noll.
"We played well, and we are going to
continue to play well for the rest of
the season, especially this weekend."
No. 7 California (9-6, 0-2 MPSF)
comes into this matchup reeling from
a blistering early conference sched
ule. Their two MPSF games thus far,
both losses, have come against
defending national champion No. 1
USC and defending MPSF
Tournament champion No. 3 UCLA.
Despite Cal's poor record,
Stanford is wary of the Bears' poten
tial.
"It's definitely going to be a tough
game. They have a lot of talent and
they have played good teams to one

goal games," said junior 2-meter
Forrest Watkins.

As Watkins mentioned, both of
Cal's conference losses came by one
goal, including a sudden-death over
time loss to UCLA. The close defeats
started before conference play
though, as five of their six losses have
been by one goal. Cal's biggest mar
gin of defeat is two goals, against No.
4 UC-Irvine.

Stanford is already responsible for
one of those six losses. The Cardinal
won the teams' first meeting 9-8 to
take third place in the NorCal
Invitational, which was hosted at
Stanford, back on Sept. 16.

But while the final score line
points to a close battle, Stanford had a
commanding 7-1 second-quarter lead
before letting Cal trickle back into

the contest.
Stanford is playing down the
importance of its home-field advan
tage in that game, which will belong
to the Golden Bears this weekend.
"Being in a stadium full of Cal
fans won't affect us at all," said Noll.
Still, the Spieker Aquatics
Complex is historically a tough envi
ronment to play in, especially with the
added significance of the Big Splash.
The previous time this regular
season matchup took place at
Berkeley, the then-No.l Golden
Bears roughed up a Stanford team
that was ranked fifth as they are
again this year.
This year's game is coming at just
the right time for Stanford, when its
biggest offensive threats are in top
form.

The team's two leading goal scor
ers, sophomore utility Alex Bowen
and freshman driver Bret Bonanni,
recorded hat tricks in their previous
game against Pepperdine. Bonanni
had a three-goal game against Santa
Barbara as well a feat that won
him the MPSF/KAP 7 Player of the
Week award.
Asked if Bonanni is capable of
recording a third straight hat trick in
Saturday's game, Watkins said,
"Based on today in practice, yeah, he
sure is."
Watkins, the team's third leading
scorer and arguably the team's best
all-around player, had two goals of his
own in each of last weekend's games.
The two Sunday games have less
impact on Stanford's postseason
hopes. Stanford has typically domi

nated at the Rodeo Tournament,
which provides a reprieve from
MPSF opponents.
The Cardinal was matched up
with Air Force in this tournament last
year as well, a game they won by a
score of 16-3. While Bowen and
Watkins scored three goals apiece, a
slew of other players also got
involved on the score sheet.

"Anyone is capable of a breakout
performance," Noll said.
The game at Cal is scheduled for
9:30 a.m. on Saturday. The first game
of the Rodeo Tournament for
Stanford will be Sunday at 8 a.m.
against Bucknell, and the second will
be at noon against Air Force.

continue to play well for the rest of
the season, especially this weekend."
No. 7 California (9-6, 0-2 MPSF)
comes into this matchup reeling from
a blistering early conference sched
ule. Their two MPSF games thus far,
both losses, have come against
defending national champion No. 1
USC and defending MPSF
Tournament champion No. 3 UCLA.
Despite Cal's poor record,
Stanford is wary of the Bears' poten
tial.
"It's definitely going to be a tough
game. They have a lot of talent and
they have played good teams to one

goal games," said junior 2-meter
Forrest Watkins.

As Watkins mentioned, both of
Cal's conference losses came by one
goal, including a sudden-death over
time loss to UCLA. The close defeats
started before conference play
though, as five of their six losses have
been by one goal. Cal's biggest mar
gin of defeat is two goals, against No.
4 UC-Irvine.

Stanford is already responsible for
one of those six losses. The Cardinal
won the teams' first meeting 9-8 to
take third place in the NorCal
Invitational, which was hosted at
Stanford, back on Sept. 16.

But while the final score line
points to a close battle, Stanford had a
commanding 7-1 second-quarter lead
before letting Cal trickle back into

the contest.
Stanford is playing down the
importance of its home-field advan
tage in that game, which will belong
to the Golden Bears this weekend.
"Being in a stadium full of Cal
fans won't affect us at all," said Noll.
Still, the Spieker Aquatics
Complex is historically a tough envi
ronment to play in, especially with the
added significance of the Big Splash.
The previous time this regular
season matchup took place at
Berkeley, the then-No.l Golden
Bears roughed up a Stanford team
that was ranked fifth as they are
again this year.
This year's game is coming at just
the right time for Stanford, when its
biggest offensive threats are in top
form.

The team's two leading goal scor
ers, sophomore utility Alex Bowen
and freshman driver Bret Bonanni,
recorded hat tricks in their previous
game against Pepperdine. Bonanni
had a three-goal game against Santa
Barbara as well a feat that won
him the MPSF/KAP 7 Player of the
Week award.
Asked if Bonanni is capable of
recording a third straight hat trick in
Saturday's game, Watkins said,
"Based on today in practice, yeah, he
sure is."
Watkins, the team's third leading
scorer and arguably the team's best
all-around player, had two goals of his
own in each of last weekend's games.
The two Sunday games have less
impact on Stanford's postseason
hopes. Stanford has typically domi

nated at the Rodeo Tournament,
which provides a reprieve from
MPSF opponents.
The Cardinal was matched up
with Air Force in this tournament last
year as well, a game they won by a
score of 16-3. While Bowen and
Watkins scored three goals apiece, a
slew of other players also got
involved on the score sheet.

"Anyone is capable of a breakout
performance," Noll said.
The game at Cal is scheduled for
9:30 a.m. on Saturday. The first game
of the Rodeo Tournament for
Stanford will be Sunday at 8 a.m.
against Bucknell, and the second will
be at noon against Air Force.

Redshirt junior Scott Platshon has played well in goal after replacing graduated senior Brian Pingree (above). But it will be up to freshman driver
Bret Bonnani and No. 5 Stanford's offense to take put points on the board and take down No. 7 Cal at in the annual Big Splash.
Stanford (8-3,2-1 MPSF) makes a
visit to Berkeley's Spieker Aquatics
Complex this Saturday for the Big
Splash with a chance to drop the
Golden Bears to 0-3 in conference
play. With a win, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal would also have its first
three-game winning streak of the sea
son.
On Sunday, Stanford makes the
trip to Santa Clara for the annual
Rodeo Tournament, where it will face
unranked Bucknell and N0.13 Air
Force.
Stanford is looking to build on its
most successful weekend of the sea
son, in which the Card shut down the
up-and-coming No. 2 UC-Santa
Barbara Gauchos before decisively
taking care of business against eighth
ranked Pepperdine.
The victories were Stanford's first
and second wins of Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play, and they put
Stanford back in title contention. The
much-needed wins came a week after
No.l USC dealt the Cardinal a
demoralizing loss to open the regular
season.
"We have a lot of momentum
going into this weekend for the Big
Splash," said senior driver Travis Noll.
"We played well, and we are going to
continue to play well for the rest of
the season, especially this weekend."
