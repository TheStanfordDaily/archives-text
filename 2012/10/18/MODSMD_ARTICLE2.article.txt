## SHPRC slashes condom prices 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
After revising its budget this year, the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center (SHPRC) is increasing the credit that every
undergraduate and coterminal student receives from two dollars
to three. Additionally, the price of condoms has decreased from
six for a dollar to ten for a dollar, and all eligible students can
now get thirty fully-subsidized condoms per quarter.
The credit can be used towards any item in the center, includ
ing condoms, lube, dental dams, pregnancy tests, sex toys and
other products.
Condoms are by far the SHPRC's most popular product,
with 5,918 already having been distributed this quarter. These
changes mark the first time condom pricing has been altered in
at least a decade, and they signal the end of the "12 free" slogan
that has long been a catchphrase for people looking for con
doms at the SHPRC.
"'l2 free' was very much just a part of the Stanford culture,"
said Sophi Newman 'l3, SHPRC co-director and financial offi
cer. "Now, instead of your 12 free it's your 30 free It's more
bang and more buck."
Starting this year, students can also use their credit for one
free pregnancy test per quarter and purchase subsequent tests
for $4.25.
"In the past it's been about $4 for [pregnancy tests]," said
Laura Bomes 'l3, SHPRC co-director. "The reason we're doing
that first pregnancy test free... is that we've had a lot of stu
dents muster up their courage and come in [but] not realize
