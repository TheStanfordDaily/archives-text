## SHPRC slashes condom prices 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
After revising its budget this year, the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center (SHPRC) is increasing the credit that every
undergraduate and coterminal student receives from two dollars
to three. Additionally, the price of condoms has decreased from
six for a dollar to ten for a dollar, and all eligible students can
now get thirty fully-subsidized condoms per quarter.
The credit can be used towards any item in the center, includ
ing condoms, lube, dental dams, pregnancy tests, sex toys and
other products.
Condoms are by far the SHPRC's most popular product,
with 5,918 already having been distributed this quarter. These
changes mark the first time condom pricing has been altered in
at least a decade, and they signal the end of the "12 free" slogan
that has long been a catchphrase for people looking for con
doms at the SHPRC.
"'l2 free' was very much just a part of the Stanford culture,"
said Sophi Newman 'l3, SHPRC co-director and financial offi
cer. "Now, instead of your 12 free it's your 30 free It's more
bang and more buck."
Starting this year, students can also use their credit for one
free pregnancy test per quarter and purchase subsequent tests
for $4.25.
"In the past it's been about $4 for [pregnancy tests]," said
Laura Bomes 'l3, SHPRC co-director. "The reason we're doing
that first pregnancy test free... is that we've had a lot of stu
dents muster up their courage and come in [but] not realize


LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
we're a cash-only operation."
Additionally, all Peer Health
Educators (PHEs) will be given 50
condoms per quarter to hand out to
residents in their dorms and at sexual
health outreach events. In the past,
PHEs have had to use dorm funds for
condom purchases.
"Last year, we got more requests
from PHEs [who] would like to be
able to use SHPRC condoms
because they're so much cheaper,"
Newman said. "So what we're doing
this year is having a dedicated stock
of condoms that's separate from the
ones we give away ourselves...
that's just for giving away at out
reaches or to dorms."
In order to find the funds to hand
out more merchandise, Newman
went through the SHPRC's budget
and realized that, in years past, the
budget had not been fully spent by
the end of the year.
"If everyone is going to give us
money and we're a public health
organization, the most responsible
thing we can do is spend through all
that money," Newman said. "If we
make a concerted effort to, at the end

of the year, have no money left, that
means we will have bought and given
away the most merchandise possible."
Graduate students can come to
the SHPRC and buy merchandise at
the center's reduced rate, but do not
have the same credit as undergradu
ates and coterms because the
SHPRC did not apply for graduate
student special fees last year. They
have applied in past years and been
rejected.
On the other hand, undergradu
ates usually pass the SHPRC's spe
cial-fee request by huge margins:
Last year, over 86 percent of voting
students supported their fee request.
