# Student practice spaces scarce
## Performers struggle to find venues in process 'full of failure 
### KIANA HUI 
Student performing arts groups are
struggling to find campus rehearsal spaces
as a result of new programming by the
Stanford Arts Institute, which limits space
available for student groups. Dance
groups have resorted to rehearsing in
dorm lounges, community centers and
even parking lots. Meanwhile, individual
performers and bands not part of a stu
dent organization have even lower priori
ty in booking practice spaces.
In the past, student groups have used
the Braun Music Center or the Roble gym
complex to rehearse and perform. The
Stanford Arts Institute's productions,
including workshops by visiting artists and

drama productions, are now held more
frequently in these facilities.
Performing arts groups are left with
second priority, with preference given to
students in the dance division of the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies.

"I try to be fair, to get everyone
rehearsal space," said Tony Kramer, Roble
Gym's facilities coordinator. "[The
process] is full of failure."

Stanford Arts Institute events are
prominent on the Roble Dance Studio
calendar, reserving several hours nearly
every day and taking up many of the
dance studios' weekday afternoon slots,
prime time for student group rehearsals.
"Last year, space was a lot easier to

reserve," said Alliance Streetdance co
director Brittany Ueno 'l2. "You would
usually get a set time and day, but because
of [Stanford Arts Initiative], we were not
allotted space until the first week of
school."

Because of the lack of availability in
the Braun Music Center and Roble Gym,
students have had to relocate to uncon
ventional venues.

"We've resorted to dancing in parking
lots," Ueno said. "If we need to practice,
we are going to practice."
Ankita Patro 'l2, co-director of
Basmati Raas, has experienced similar
problems.

The Roble Gym complex, a popular rehearsal space, is overbooked in part because of added programming sponsored
by the Stanford Arts Institute. Groups have been forced to rehearse in community centers, dorms and even parking lots.
