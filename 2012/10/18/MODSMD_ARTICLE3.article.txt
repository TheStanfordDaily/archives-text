# Student practice spaces scarce
## Performers struggle to find venues in process 'full of failure 
### KIANA HUI 
Student performing arts groups are
struggling to find campus rehearsal spaces
as a result of new programming by the
Stanford Arts Institute, which limits space
available for student groups. Dance
groups have resorted to rehearsing in
dorm lounges, community centers and
even parking lots. Meanwhile, individual
performers and bands not part of a stu
dent organization have even lower priori
ty in booking practice spaces.
In the past, student groups have used
the Braun Music Center or the Roble gym
complex to rehearse and perform. The
Stanford Arts Institute's productions,
including workshops by visiting artists and

drama productions, are now held more
frequently in these facilities.
Performing arts groups are left with
second priority, with preference given to
students in the dance division of the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies.

"I try to be fair, to get everyone
rehearsal space," said Tony Kramer, Roble
Gym's facilities coordinator. "[The
process] is full of failure."

Stanford Arts Institute events are
prominent on the Roble Dance Studio
calendar, reserving several hours nearly
every day and taking up many of the
dance studios' weekday afternoon slots,
prime time for student group rehearsals.
"Last year, space was a lot easier to

reserve," said Alliance Streetdance co
director Brittany Ueno 'l2. "You would
usually get a set time and day, but because
of [Stanford Arts Initiative], we were not
allotted space until the first week of
school."

Because of the lack of availability in
the Braun Music Center and Roble Gym,
students have had to relocate to uncon
ventional venues.

"We've resorted to dancing in parking
lots," Ueno said. "If we need to practice,
we are going to practice."
Ankita Patro 'l2, co-director of
Basmati Raas, has experienced similar
problems.

The Roble Gym complex, a popular rehearsal space, is overbooked in part because of added programming sponsored
by the Stanford Arts Institute. Groups have been forced to rehearse in community centers, dorms and even parking lots.
"It's hard to get space in Roble
this year because the drama depart
ment has increased their use of dance
space," Patro said. "We've practiced
in Meyer Forum. That was kind of a
last resort. Sometimes we would
show up there, and there would be
office hours, [so] we would have to
find another place,"
"Student dance groups are
looked at differently than people
from the dance department," Ueno
said. "I think that's really sad because
dance groups can offer just as much
in learning as the dance department."
Artists and bands that are not a
part of an arts organization but per
form in their spare time are left in an
even more difficult position. They are
left to scrounge up whatever remain
ing space performing arts groups
leave behind.
"Our only option is to lug our
equipment across campus on our
bikes and skateboards to a practice
room that we don't have a key to,"
said Ben McKenzie 'l5, who plays in
a student band. "We have to wait out
side until someone who lives there
lets us in."

Scott Kepley, the department of
music's technical services manager,
controls practice space in the Braun

Music Center, where Ben initially
searched for a practice room but was
told there was no space left.
"[We have] so many different
groups that want to use our spaces
that we have to give [music depart
ment] students the first crack at
spaces," Kepley said. "Then, we try to
open it up to the broader student
groups on campus."
According to Kepley, there are 13
practice classrooms available in
Braun available for a $5O per quarter
fee, but availability of practice space
is "difficult just because [Braun] has
so many different groups competing
for space,"
Although Kepley suggested "resi
dence halls are probably the first and
best place to look," they are not ide
ally suited to the loud noise and large
groups that accompany the perform
ing arts.

Even Kimball Hall, the perform
ing arts-themed dorm on campus, has
no music or group rehearsal spaces,
only a recording studio.
"The students use the lounge, but
because so many people want to use
it we have to limit it to a couple times
a quarter," said Sharon Wei,
Kimball's resident fellow. "We have
been suggesting Manzanita Dining
because it has a piano and it's not
really used after dinner time."
Other popular rehearsal spots
include the Black Community Center
and the Elliott Program Center, both
of which have wood floors for danc

ing. Neither location is ideal, howev
er, as the Black Community Center
does not have mirrors and the Elliott
Program Center is only open to
Governor's Corner residents.

After hearing about the dearth of
rehearsal spaces from several stu
dents, ASSU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5
is starting an effort to improve arts
spaces on campus.

"Our goal is to reallocate spaces
to help [performing arts groups] and
help artists who are not necessarily
part of an official student organiza
tion," he said. "We want to rearrange
the way we look at spaces within
dorms and within residences."

As part of the Stanford Arts
Initiative, several building projects
are at various stages of construction
in the new campus "Arts District,"
including the Bing Concert Hall, the
Anderson Collection Art Museum
and the McMurtry Building for Art
and Art History. None of these build
ings are expected to host student
group rehearsals, through the Bing
Concert Hall will be open for select
student performances.

For now, students and administra
tors will continue to struggle to find
practice space.
"When I'm scheduling, typing e
mails [for Roble Gym bookings], I
can hear people all over campus
screaming," Kramer said.

form in their spare time are left in an
even more difficult position. They are
left to scrounge up whatever remain
ing space performing arts groups
leave behind.
"Our only option is to lug our
equipment across campus on our
bikes and skateboards to a practice
room that we don't have a key to,"
said Ben McKenzie 'l5, who plays in
a student band. "We have to wait out
side until someone who lives there
lets us in."

Scott Kepley, the department of
music's technical services manager,
controls practice space in the Braun

Music Center, where Ben initially
searched for a practice room but was
told there was no space left.
"[We have] so many different
groups that want to use our spaces
that we have to give [music depart
ment] students the first crack at
spaces," Kepley said. "Then, we try to
open it up to the broader student
groups on campus."
According to Kepley, there are 13
practice classrooms available in
Braun available for a $5O per quarter
fee, but availability of practice space
is "difficult just because [Braun] has
so many different groups competing
for space,"
Although Kepley suggested "resi
dence halls are probably the first and
best place to look," they are not ide
ally suited to the loud noise and large
groups that accompany the perform
ing arts.

Even Kimball Hall, the perform
ing arts-themed dorm on campus, has
no music or group rehearsal spaces,
only a recording studio.
"The students use the lounge, but
because so many people want to use
it we have to limit it to a couple times
a quarter," said Sharon Wei,
Kimball's resident fellow. "We have
been suggesting Manzanita Dining
because it has a piano and it's not
really used after dinner time."
Other popular rehearsal spots
include the Black Community Center
and the Elliott Program Center, both
of which have wood floors for danc

ing. Neither location is ideal, howev
er, as the Black Community Center
does not have mirrors and the Elliott
Program Center is only open to
Governor's Corner residents.

After hearing about the dearth of
rehearsal spaces from several stu
dents, ASSU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5
is starting an effort to improve arts
spaces on campus.

"Our goal is to reallocate spaces
to help [performing arts groups] and
help artists who are not necessarily
part of an official student organiza
tion," he said. "We want to rearrange
the way we look at spaces within
dorms and within residences."

As part of the Stanford Arts
Initiative, several building projects
are at various stages of construction
in the new campus "Arts District,"
including the Bing Concert Hall, the
Anderson Collection Art Museum
and the McMurtry Building for Art
and Art History. None of these build
ings are expected to host student
group rehearsals, through the Bing
Concert Hall will be open for select
student performances.

For now, students and administra
tors will continue to struggle to find
practice space.
"When I'm scheduling, typing e
mails [for Roble Gym bookings], I
can hear people all over campus
screaming," Kramer said.

Student performing arts groups are
struggling to find campus rehearsal spaces
as a result of new programming by the
Stanford Arts Institute, which limits space
available for student groups. Dance
groups have resorted to rehearsing in
dorm lounges, community centers and
even parking lots. Meanwhile, individual
performers and bands not part of a stu
dent organization have even lower priori
ty in booking practice spaces.
In the past, student groups have used
the Braun Music Center or the Roble gym
complex to rehearse and perform. The
Stanford Arts Institute's productions,
including workshops by visiting artists and

drama productions, are now held more
frequently in these facilities.
Performing arts groups are left with
second priority, with preference given to
students in the dance division of the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies.

"I try to be fair, to get everyone
rehearsal space," said Tony Kramer, Roble
Gym's facilities coordinator. "[The
process] is full of failure."

Stanford Arts Institute events are
prominent on the Roble Dance Studio
calendar, reserving several hours nearly
every day and taking up many of the
dance studios' weekday afternoon slots,
prime time for student group rehearsals.
"Last year, space was a lot easier to

reserve," said Alliance Streetdance co
director Brittany Ueno 'l2. "You would
usually get a set time and day, but because
of [Stanford Arts Initiative], we were not
allotted space until the first week of
school."

Because of the lack of availability in
the Braun Music Center and Roble Gym,
students have had to relocate to uncon
ventional venues.

"We've resorted to dancing in parking
lots," Ueno said. "If we need to practice,
we are going to practice."
Ankita Patro 'l2, co-director of
Basmati Raas, has experienced similar
problems.

The Roble Gym complex, a popular rehearsal space, is overbooked in part because of added programming sponsored
by the Stanford Arts Institute. Groups have been forced to rehearse in community centers, dorms and even parking lots.
"It's hard to get space in Roble
this year because the drama depart
ment has increased their use of dance
space," Patro said. "We've practiced
in Meyer Forum. That was kind of a
last resort. Sometimes we would
show up there, and there would be
office hours, [so] we would have to
find another place,"
"Student dance groups are
looked at differently than people
from the dance department," Ueno
said. "I think that's really sad because
dance groups can offer just as much
in learning as the dance department."
Artists and bands that are not a
part of an arts organization but per
form in their spare time are left in an
even more difficult position. They are
