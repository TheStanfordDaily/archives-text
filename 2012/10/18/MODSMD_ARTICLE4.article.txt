## New SLAC construction in progress Research support building to be completed in April 2013 
### LIAM KINNEY 
The SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory is working on a new home
for the team that manages the research
center's world-famous 2-mile linear
accelerator. Construction is more than
halfway complete on a new research
support building (RSB), to be finished
in April 2013, which will create space
for collaboration between scientists,
engineers and support staff.
The project is being funded under a
10-year U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) program that aims to improve
the nation's laboratory infrastructure.
With the $97.4 million DOE gave the
research center in 2009, SLAC has
started its own modernization project,
which currently includes the demoli
tion of a trailer park and a complete
renovation of administrative and ware
house buildings.
Just over a year ago, 13 portable
classrooms and office buildings sat at
the current site of the RSB. Established
as a temporary installment in the 19605,
"PEP City" was an outdated, small and
disconnected system that SLAC
administrators say they are happy to
see gone.
"It was a very old, aging facility,"
said Karen Chan-Hui, electrical engi
neer and project manager at SLAC.
"We had a need to replace the deficien
cies with a new, safe and collaborative
environment for the scientists as well
as the support staff to work together."
Chan-Hui said the idea behind the
building fits in with SLAC's "one lab"
approach, which involves consolidating
facilities in order to conduct research
efficiently.
"The mission of the project was to
co-locate the accelerator scientists and
engineers... to combine and bring
everybody together so you didn't have
people working together on a daily
basis who were located in five different
buildings," said Steve Jack, SLAC's
construction manager.

Along with the DOE funding came
the requirement that all new buildings
be built with a 30-percent energy sav
ings from the previous building stan
dard.

"For a building the same size as
one built in 2007, this building has to
be built to have less energy use by 30
percent," Jack said. "And this particu
lar building has actually achieved 40
percent savings."
Along with cutting down on pollu
tion, construction for the RSB has
been mindful of sound pollution and
other construction inconveniences,
Jack said. The SLAC team has sched
uled construction for the weekends,
and has made sure not to keep neces
sary utilities available,
"There's been typical construction
impact," Jack said. "The traffic around
the site, at times, has been impacted
due to deliveries of material and utility
connections under the road. We
haven't had any big problems with the
tenants around the building and have
definitely not impacted the science or
the labs."

SLAC holds a monthly informa
tional event called "coffee crunch" to

inform the community about current
events going in the research center.

"We work with the communica
tions department to make announce
ments ahead of time," Chan-Hui said.
"One of the reasons the community
has not had a big complaint about it is
because we informed the community
since before the construction started."
SLAC celebrated its 50th reunion
this year, and looks forward to finding
more ways to make the lab more organ
ized and efficient. The center's eventual
dream for the RSB is to move the con
trol room for the linear accelerator into
the building to further consolidate the
lab, according to Jack. The construction
team will either use funds left from this
project or reach out to various pro
grams within the DOE.
"It wasn't a part of the original
scope," Jack said. "We've made provi
sions for a new main control center to
be built in there once additional fund
ing becomes available."
Along with the modernization
project, the construction team at
SLAC has just started two other build
ing projects. They have recently laid
down plans for a Science and User
Support Building, intended to house
and centralize the conferences and col
laborations of SLAC scientists.
This new facility will be joined by
the new Linac Coherent Light Source
Building, which will also be dedicated
toward SLAC's latest project: using
ultrafast X-ray pulses to take unprece
dented stop-motion photographs of
atoms and molecules in motion.
"SLAC has a lot more than just the
RSB going on," Chan-Hui said.

center's world-famous 2-mile linear
accelerator. Construction is more than
halfway complete on a new research
support building (RSB), to be finished
in April 2013, which will create space
for collaboration between scientists,
engineers and support staff.
The project is being funded under a
10-year U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) program that aims to improve
the nation's laboratory infrastructure.
With the $97.4 million DOE gave the
research center in 2009, SLAC has
started its own modernization project,
which currently includes the demoli
tion of a trailer park and a complete
renovation of administrative and ware
house buildings.
Just over a year ago, 13 portable
classrooms and office buildings sat at
the current site of the RSB. Established
as a temporary installment in the 19605,
"PEP City" was an outdated, small and
disconnected system that SLAC
administrators say they are happy to
see gone.
"It was a very old, aging facility,"
said Karen Chan-Hui, electrical engi
neer and project manager at SLAC.
"We had a need to replace the deficien
cies with a new, safe and collaborative
environment for the scientists as well
as the support staff to work together."
Chan-Hui said the idea behind the
building fits in with SLAC's "one lab"
approach, which involves consolidating
facilities in order to conduct research
efficiently.
"The mission of the project was to
co-locate the accelerator scientists and
engineers... to combine and bring
everybody together so you didn't have
people working together on a daily
basis who were located in five different
buildings," said Steve Jack, SLAC's
construction manager.

Along with the DOE funding came
the requirement that all new buildings
be built with a 30-percent energy sav
ings from the previous building stan
dard.

"For a building the same size as
one built in 2007, this building has to
be built to have less energy use by 30
percent," Jack said. "And this particu
lar building has actually achieved 40
percent savings."
Along with cutting down on pollu
tion, construction for the RSB has
been mindful of sound pollution and
other construction inconveniences,
Jack said. The SLAC team has sched
uled construction for the weekends,
and has made sure not to keep neces
sary utilities available,
"There's been typical construction
impact," Jack said. "The traffic around
the site, at times, has been impacted
due to deliveries of material and utility
connections under the road. We
haven't had any big problems with the
tenants around the building and have
definitely not impacted the science or
the labs."

SLAC holds a monthly informa
tional event called "coffee crunch" to

inform the community about current
events going in the research center.

"We work with the communica
tions department to make announce
ments ahead of time," Chan-Hui said.
"One of the reasons the community
has not had a big complaint about it is
because we informed the community
since before the construction started."
SLAC celebrated its 50th reunion
this year, and looks forward to finding
more ways to make the lab more organ
ized and efficient. The center's eventual
dream for the RSB is to move the con
trol room for the linear accelerator into
the building to further consolidate the
lab, according to Jack. The construction
team will either use funds left from this
project or reach out to various pro
grams within the DOE.
"It wasn't a part of the original
scope," Jack said. "We've made provi
sions for a new main control center to
be built in there once additional fund
ing becomes available."
Along with the modernization
project, the construction team at
SLAC has just started two other build
ing projects. They have recently laid
down plans for a Science and User
Support Building, intended to house
and centralize the conferences and col
laborations of SLAC scientists.
This new facility will be joined by
the new Linac Coherent Light Source
Building, which will also be dedicated
toward SLAC's latest project: using
ultrafast X-ray pulses to take unprece
dented stop-motion photographs of
atoms and molecules in motion.
"SLAC has a lot more than just the
RSB going on," Chan-Hui said.
