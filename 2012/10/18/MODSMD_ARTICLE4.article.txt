## New SLAC construction in progress Research support building to be completed in April 2013 
### LIAM KINNEY 
The SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory is working on a new home
for the team that manages the research
center's world-famous 2-mile linear
accelerator. Construction is more than
halfway complete on a new research
support building (RSB), to be finished
in April 2013, which will create space
for collaboration between scientists,
engineers and support staff.
The project is being funded under a
10-year U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) program that aims to improve
the nation's laboratory infrastructure.
With the $97.4 million DOE gave the
research center in 2009, SLAC has
started its own modernization project,
which currently includes the demoli
tion of a trailer park and a complete
renovation of administrative and ware
house buildings.
Just over a year ago, 13 portable
classrooms and office buildings sat at
the current site of the RSB. Established
as a temporary installment in the 19605,
"PEP City" was an outdated, small and
disconnected system that SLAC
administrators say they are happy to
see gone.
"It was a very old, aging facility,"
said Karen Chan-Hui, electrical engi
neer and project manager at SLAC.
"We had a need to replace the deficien
cies with a new, safe and collaborative
environment for the scientists as well
as the support staff to work together."
Chan-Hui said the idea behind the
building fits in with SLAC's "one lab"
approach, which involves consolidating
facilities in order to conduct research
