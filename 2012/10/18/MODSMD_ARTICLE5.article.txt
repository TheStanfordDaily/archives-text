## Bookstore emphasizes athletic apparel 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
The Stanford Bookstore switched the location
of books and apparel before the start of fall quar
ter as part of a plan to refresh the store's space and
selection, according to Director of Stores Jeff
Deutsch, who is responsible for overseeing all
University shops. Most books are now located on
the upper floor while apparel is on the ground
floor. The location of textbooks and school sup
plies on the mezzanine and lower floor, respective
ly, remains unchanged.
Deutsch wrote in an email to The Daily that

the "recent remodel" of the bookstore also
involved installing wall-unit bookshelves, re-mer
chandising the computer section and renovating
the cafe.

"In considering the space for books, we wanted
to give the department a dedicated space with
ample seating adjacent to our cafe while not
reducing our title count," Deutsch said. "The
upper level was perfectly suited for this."
According to Deutsch, merchandise sales have
not changed as a result of this decision. Though he
would not disclose specific numbers, he said that
revenues "continue to be robust" for both books

and apparel, particularly during the first few
weeks of the quarter. Sales have been historically
strong during this time period due to textbook
purchases and events like New Student
Orientation and Homecoming Weekend.
"We are always looking for new ways to
evolve, and are proud that we were able to offer
the most robust selection of textbook options at
the beginning of fall quarter," Deutsch said,
adding that opportunities to rent textbooks or
acquire digital copies continue to expand.

The Stanford Bookstore modified the layout of its merchandise before the start of fall quarter, moving books to the upper floor and apparel
to the ground floor. Other changes include new bookshelves, renovations to the cafe and updates to the computer system.
Several shelves stocked with the
most popular book categories are still
located on the ground floor, including
shelves of new releases, bestsellers
and works by faculty authors.
"We take a lot of pride in our fac
ulty author selection and will always
ensure a prominent place for these
works," Deutsch said.
A change of this scale is not new
to the bookstore, as floor switches
have been made in the past at the dis
cretion of bookstore management.
Though the location of items on
the ground and upper floor may not
be permanent, Deutsch does not
anticipate any change in textbook or
school supply locations in the future.
"At this point we are not consid

ering it, as we believe the mezzanine
and lower floor lend themselves nice
ly to the seasonal nature of those
businesses," Deutsch said.
Store management consulted
with faculty, alumni and students
before making the change, and the
small amount of feedback received
so far has been positive, according to
Deutsch.
"This wasn't done to generate
additional sales but to serve the com
munity," Deutsch said.
It's too soon to tell whether or not
the changes will affect long-term
profits, and Deutsch said so far rev
enue has not changed considerably
for either books or apparel.
