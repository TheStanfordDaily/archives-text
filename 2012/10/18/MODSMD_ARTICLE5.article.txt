## Bookstore emphasizes athletic apparel 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
The Stanford Bookstore switched the location
of books and apparel before the start of fall quar
ter as part of a plan to refresh the store's space and
selection, according to Director of Stores Jeff
Deutsch, who is responsible for overseeing all
University shops. Most books are now located on
the upper floor while apparel is on the ground
floor. The location of textbooks and school sup
plies on the mezzanine and lower floor, respective
ly, remains unchanged.
Deutsch wrote in an email to The Daily that

the "recent remodel" of the bookstore also
involved installing wall-unit bookshelves, re-mer
chandising the computer section and renovating
the cafe.

"In considering the space for books, we wanted
to give the department a dedicated space with
ample seating adjacent to our cafe while not
reducing our title count," Deutsch said. "The
upper level was perfectly suited for this."
According to Deutsch, merchandise sales have
not changed as a result of this decision. Though he
would not disclose specific numbers, he said that
revenues "continue to be robust" for both books

and apparel, particularly during the first few
weeks of the quarter. Sales have been historically
strong during this time period due to textbook
purchases and events like New Student
Orientation and Homecoming Weekend.
"We are always looking for new ways to
evolve, and are proud that we were able to offer
the most robust selection of textbook options at
the beginning of fall quarter," Deutsch said,
adding that opportunities to rent textbooks or
acquire digital copies continue to expand.
