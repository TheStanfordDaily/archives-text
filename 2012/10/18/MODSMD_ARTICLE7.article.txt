## Levinthal writing program turns 10 Creative writing tutorials allow one-on-one mentoring 
### KAY DANNENMAIER 
The Levinthal Tutorial program is one
of the only opportunities for Stanford
undergrads to work closely with the
Stegner Fellows, a selective group of
working writers based at Stanford.
The Program, run by the Creative
Writing Department, celebrates its 10th
anniversary this year. Endowed by Elliot
Levinthal Ph.D. '49, professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering, and his wife
Rhoda, it gives undergraduates the
opportunity to work on a creative writing
project of their choice.
"I would have died for a program like
this in my undergraduate life," Stegner
Fellow Kai Carlson-Wee said.
For five units of credit, students
accepted to the program complete an indi
vidually-designed reading list of about
three books and a writing project of up to
twenty poems or around 50 pages of cre
ative fiction or non-fiction. They also meet
with their assigned fellow for two hours
each week. The program is offered only
during winter quarter.
This access to the Stegner fellows, a
group of twenty working writers chosen
from an applicant pool of more than
3,200, is unique to the program.

While students are welcome to attend
readings by Stegner fellows throughout
the year, "undergraduates do not current

ly have other opportunities to interact as
closely with Stegner fellows," said Sarah
Weston 'l4, a student adviser for the
Creative Writing Program
The inspiration behind the tutorials is
"to add a layer of craft and counsel, after
the workshops, to undergraduates," said
Eavan Boland, director of the Creative
Writing Program.
"A workshop can flatten a writer,
when really he or she should be bent and
stretched and corrugated," said Lucas
Loredo 'l2, who completed a tutorial in
his junior year. "The Levinthal tutorial
was perfect for this."
According to Stegner Fellow Mira
Rosenthal, the program creates a more
open environment for students, in addi
tion to supplementing workshops.
"In class, students are performing and
think[ing] about how they come across to
the professor, pleasing the professor,"
Rosenthal said.

In contrast, she said the Levinthal tuto
rials are "more casual and more honest."

"There's not the same pretension as in
class, the same trying to be smart," she
said.

According to Carlson-Wee, the pro
gram provides a unique experience for
the Stegner fellows as well.
"A mentorship is a middle ground
between being a teacher and being a
friend, and that matters a lot," Wee said.
He compared the Levinthal tutorials
to his experience as a student in the tuto
rial system at Oxford. Studying there, he
said, "empowered [him] as a writer and as

a thinker."
Program alumni agreed it is a worth
while endeavor.
"Everyone I know who has taken a
tutorial has spoken of it as one of the best
parts of their experience at Stanford,"
Weston said.
The 2011-12 program accepted only
17 students out of 70 applicants.
While all students involved in the
tutorial must demonstrate a serious inter
est in creative writing and have complet
ed one of the introductory creative writ
ing classes (English 90, 91, or 92), there
are no other course or departmental
requirements.
Many undergraduates enrolled in past
Levinthal tutorials were not Creative
Writing minors many are not even
majoring in the humanities. Past partici
pants have gone on to start bands, study
medicine or even work in the technology
industry.
This changes the relationship the
mentors have with their students.

"It's exciting to feel like I'm sowing
the seeds of literature helping to estab
lish a firm institution of literature in
someone who will become a promoter
and lover of it," Rosenthal said.
Applications are still open for the
2012-13 program, and will close Nov. 5.
Applicants must submit a writing sample
and a paragraph outlining a possible pro
gram of study.
