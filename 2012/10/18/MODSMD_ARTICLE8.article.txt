priorities, including $304.3 million
in support of research and other
programs, $102.1 million for con

struction and maintenance of
facilities and $70.8 million for stu
dent support. A $lOO million
gift by Robert King MBA '6O and

Innovation in Developing
Economies.

Stanford's permanent endow
ment grew by more than $3OO mil
lion during the year through gifts,
while total philanthropic activity
including pledges yet to be ful
filled as well as gifts and pledges
received —totaled $1.2 billion.
"I am extremely gratified and a
little awed by their overwhelming
level of support," Hennessy said of
Stanford's donors. "It is a tremen
dous vote of confidence in our out
standing faculty and students."
