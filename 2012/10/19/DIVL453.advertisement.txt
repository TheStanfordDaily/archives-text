We are a couple seeking an Asian egg donor to help build our family. You should
be near top of your class, and preferably have some outstanding achievements and
awards. We prefer Asian race, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese.
You should be between 18-35 years old.
An example of our ideal egg donor: 21 year old Chinese Stanford student, top in
her class, several awards in high school and university. She wants to be an egg
donor in order to help bring a child into the world with the same special gifts she
has.
Your eggs will be fertilized with sperm from the husband, and the resulting embryos
used to impregnate the wife, or possibly a surrogate mother.
About us: we are a highly educated couple, but we are unable to have children
due to infertility of the wife. The husband is a highly accomplished scientist/
mathematician and businessman, the wife has a good PhD-level university degree.
The husband is of European race, wife is Chinese.
We value education, and we live in one of the best school districts in the world. We
hope that our child will be a gifted, as each of us is, and that he/she will have a
positive impact on the world.
