## Veterans talk military-civilian gap Dustin Barfield '12 critical of University support for veterans 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD STAFF WRITER 
"If my country was going to war, there was
no damn way it would happen without me," said
Dustin Barfield 'l2, a two-time combat veteran
who transferred to Stanford in 2009.
While most students at Stanford enter their
sophomore year reminiscing on their adven
tures as college freshman, Barfield had a pro
foundly different experience in the back of his
mind. Despite attempts by his family and friends
to dissuade him, he enlisted in December 2001
and served for four years in Iraq.
"They yelled at me," Barfield said. "They
threatened me. They told me to change my mind
... they even tried to bribe me. I was already set
though. It was happening."
After serving in Kuwait, Barfield was
deployed again to Iraq in August 2004 for the
second battle of Fallujah, one of the bloodiest
conflicts in the war. But according to Barfield,
the American media wrongly sensationalized
the military, causing him to lose confidence in
public perception.
"You get back home, and you hear about 13
sergeants killed and one severely wounded,"
Barfield said. "You don't hear about us handing
out humanitarian rations and building schools.
You don't hear about torture victims coming up
to us, bawling, crying and hugging us, saying
'George Bush ... very good!'"
"It's 99.9 percent waiting around, pointing
your weapon at the middle of a desert, waiting
on super high alert for someone who is going to
try to kill you at any moment. Waiting and wait
ing and waiting."
Upon his return from the Marine Corps in
2006, however, Barfield encountered the civil
ian-military divide. It's a divide several members
of the military at Stanford feel and acknowl
edge.

"There's been a historic divide between civil
society and the military and this is some
thing that has happened since the Vietnam era,"
said Haney Hong 'O3, president of the Stanford
Military Service Network (SMSN).
"Generationally, because people have had less
exposure to the military, they have less of an
understanding of it."
According to Hong, who served as a subma
rine officer in the Navy after completing the
Navy Reserve Officers' Training Corps
(ROTC) program at UC Berkeley, SMSN was
founded to bridge the civilian-military divide as
well as to help the community understand that
Stanford military veterans are "just like every
body else."
"It's a lot of misconception, and that's not
necessarily [the community's] fault," Hong said.
"When you're not exposed to it very much, you
don't really understand. The image of someone
in the military doesn't mesh with what some
body thinks about as a Stanford student."
William Treseder 'll, a Marine veteran and
friend of Barfield, describes how not looking
like the "typical military guy" helped him break
the ice more easily.
"If you know he's a veteran but doesn't look
like a veteran, that creates an interesting tension
in your mind and you wonder why is this guy
not conforming to the model in my head?"
Treseder said.
Similar to Hong, Treseder suggests that part

of what contributes to this negative attitude
dates back to the Vietnam War era. As a result,
he feels Stanford is also unprepared to support
veterans returning back from war.
"Probably the single biggest part of this is
the big chunk of people from the late '6os to
mid-'7os whose impression of where Stanford is
now is very different from actually where it is,"
Treseder said. "They think it's the place that
burned down the Navy ROTC building and that
hates the military."
Opinions vary in terms of what Stanford can
do to improve the experience of war veterans
on campus. Lillian Mcßee 'l4, a ROTC student
and active member of SMSN, believes that dia
logue is the most organic way in promoting
awareness between the civilian and military
community.

"I think those types of questions, where we
just get to know one another person-to-person
is, at the end of the day, the best way of bridging
this divide," Mcßee said. "In general, even in my
freshmen year, the reason I was afraid for com

ing out in my dorm was that there were a lot of
the protestors for anti-ROTC groups. But now I
see that if I talk to them over the years, get to
know them a little bit better, they'll still respect
me for the fact that I am pursuing something
that I love."

While Barfield is grateful for the Marine
Corps' post-war support including services for
his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), he believes that Stanford still has room
for improvement.
"Stanford University could do a better job
connecting with its veterans, understanding
their issues and being more sympathetic to
them," Barfield said. "It's not the same case
mentally or emotionally as an 18-year-old who
was valedictorian."

Toward that goal, SMSN is expanding and
partnering with the Haas Center for Public
Service and the Graduate School of Business.
