## HPS launches new health initiative iThrive at Stanford refocuses on student wellness, social media outreach 
### LUCY SVOBODA 
iThrive at Stanford, a new initiative launched at
the start of this academic year, will be responsible
for running health and wellness programs such as
dorm outreaches, happiness classes and the Peer
Health Educator (PHE) program.
According to administrators, the most notable
difference between HPS and iThrive will be an
increased social media presence, with HPS taking an
administrative role behind iThrive's student-led out
reach.
"Health Promotion Services is our official
University name in which we serve on various
University and national work groups," HPS director
Carole Pertofsky said. "iThrive at Stanford is who
we are to students."
Until 2011, HPS was responsible for running
alcohol programs, sexual assault programs and well
ness services. In 2011, the Office of Sexual Assault
and Relationship Abuse (SARA) and the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE) were estab
lished, prompting HPS to focus on making programs
more student-centered.
"iThrive seems more personal and approachable
to students," said Tim Huang 'l4, TA of the iThrive
run ATHLETIC 196: Practice of Happiness class.
"It's about feeling like I have the resources and the
people and the support to feel emotionally healthy."
To more effectively reach students, iThrive has
aggressively stepped up social media efforts in con
trast with HPS's more traditional, top-down
approach. iThrive hires student writers and videog
raphers to run its Facebook page.
"In today's world, social media is students' pre
ferred method of getting information," Pertofsky
said. "We still offer real-time programs, courses,
dorm talks and health advising; [social media] is a
new addition that we hope will add value to stu
dents."
Other new initiatives include Tumblr pages, an e
newsletter and student-written wellness blogs.
A large motivating factor behind the launch of
iThrive was the separation of the sexual assault and
alcohol offices from HPS, which has allowed
Pertofsky to focus on wellness outreach.
"Until this academic year, our resources were
more limited," Pertofsky said. "Now we are able to
dedicate our resources to new initiatives for student
wellness."
