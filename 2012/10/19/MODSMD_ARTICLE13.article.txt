## Unconventional economist 
### FELIX BOYEAUX STAFF WRITER 
£ £ ~W" can't talk to you about
I the world economy. I
don't know anything
about the world econ
omy!" Alvin Roth said
to a journalist on the phone as he
stepped off the treadmill in his office
in the Landau Economics Building.
It might be surprising that Roth
M.A. '73 Ph.D. '74, visiting professor
of economics and this year's winner
of the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences, claims not to
know anything about economics. But
Roth does not define himself as an
economist.
"I went into operations research
with the idea of fixing things up so
they work better," he said.
"Operations research led me the
game theory, which later on became
economics. I just stayed where I was;
the borders shifted."
As the numerous congratulatory
Elmo balloons floating around his
office testify, Roth went on to
become one of the most acclaimed
economists in his field.
"He is there at the frontier of the

fields of market design, game theory
and experimental economists," said
Jonathan Levin '94, chair of the eco
nomics department. "He is a real
intellectual leader."
As a teenager, Roth dropped out
of high school in Queens, N.Y.
because, according to a 2010 inter
view with Forbes, he felt "understim
ulated." He went on to graduate from
Columbia University in 1971 with a
degree in Operations Research and
received his masters and doctoral
degrees in the same discipline from
Stanford in 1973 and 1974. After a
stint at the University of Illinois, he
then moved on to the University of
Pittsburgh. In 1998, he became the
George Gund Professor of
Economics and Business
Administration at Harvard
University and Harvard Business
School, a position he will hold until
January 2013.
Throughout his career, Roth
brought to light the relatively new
fields of game theory and market
design, contributing to the very foun
dations of both disciplines. He is
notably acclaimed for his work on the
theory of matching markets.
Roth shared the Nobel prize with

Lloyd Shapley, a professor emeritus
at the University of California, Los
Angeles, "for the theory of stable
allocations and the practice of market
design."
When asked if he could explain
what this description meant in lay
man's terms, Roth answered jokingly,

"Probably not, it usually takes me a
quarter to explain what it means!"
"For a long time, economists stud
ied markets the way botanists studied
plants," he said. '"Look at that, what a
remarkable plant, let us be good sci
entists and describe how it's con
structed and how it works,' and of

course botanists were not expected to
make new plants."
Roth explained that in the same
way botanists have now started to
engineer new plants, economists have
realized that the markets they
