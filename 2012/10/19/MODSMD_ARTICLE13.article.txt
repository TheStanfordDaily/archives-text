# ALVIN ROTH
## Unconventional economist 
### FELIX BOYEAUX STAFF WRITER 
£ £ ~W" can't talk to you about
I the world economy. I
don't know anything
about the world econ
omy!" Alvin Roth said
to a journalist on the phone as he
stepped off the treadmill in his office
in the Landau Economics Building.
It might be surprising that Roth
M.A. '73 Ph.D. '74, visiting professor
of economics and this year's winner
of the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences, claims not to
know anything about economics. But
Roth does not define himself as an
economist.
"I went into operations research
with the idea of fixing things up so
they work better," he said.
"Operations research led me the
game theory, which later on became
economics. I just stayed where I was;
the borders shifted."
As the numerous congratulatory
Elmo balloons floating around his
office testify, Roth went on to
become one of the most acclaimed
economists in his field.
"He is there at the frontier of the

fields of market design, game theory
and experimental economists," said
Jonathan Levin '94, chair of the eco
nomics department. "He is a real
intellectual leader."
As a teenager, Roth dropped out
of high school in Queens, N.Y.
because, according to a 2010 inter
view with Forbes, he felt "understim
ulated." He went on to graduate from
Columbia University in 1971 with a
degree in Operations Research and
received his masters and doctoral
degrees in the same discipline from
Stanford in 1973 and 1974. After a
stint at the University of Illinois, he
then moved on to the University of
Pittsburgh. In 1998, he became the
George Gund Professor of
Economics and Business
Administration at Harvard
University and Harvard Business
School, a position he will hold until
January 2013.
Throughout his career, Roth
brought to light the relatively new
fields of game theory and market
design, contributing to the very foun
dations of both disciplines. He is
notably acclaimed for his work on the
theory of matching markets.
Roth shared the Nobel prize with

Lloyd Shapley, a professor emeritus
at the University of California, Los
Angeles, "for the theory of stable
allocations and the practice of market
design."
When asked if he could explain
what this description meant in lay
man's terms, Roth answered jokingly,

"Probably not, it usually takes me a
quarter to explain what it means!"
"For a long time, economists stud
ied markets the way botanists studied
plants," he said. '"Look at that, what a
remarkable plant, let us be good sci
entists and describe how it's con
structed and how it works,' and of

course botanists were not expected to
make new plants."
Roth explained that in the same
way botanists have now started to
engineer new plants, economists have
realized that the markets they

observe suffer certain kinds of fail
ures. Market design is about making
them work better.
So far, Roth has made kidney
donor matching, the national med
ical residency program and New
York and Boston public high school
systems all work better.
"He is a really great representa
tive of economics because he is
working on problems that are appli
cations of economics to make the
world a better place," Levin said.
"He is trying to figure out how to let
students pick schools to let as many
of them get into the one they want or
get as many people off the kidney
transplant list as possible."
Roth received the call from
Sweden at 3:30 a.m. on Monday
morning while, predictably, he was
sound asleep. The Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences gave him 25
minutes to prepare a press confer
ence.
"[The Nobel] wasn't expected in
the sense that I was sound asleep," he
said. "I did not think I was going to
get this Nobel Prize, but it wasn't a
crazy thought."
Indeed, Roth has been nominat
ed for the prize for a long time now.
"They nominate you and you fill
out a form but you never know if
they are going to pick you," he said.
"They have their own process. It is a
very Swedish process."
Levin, however, predicted the
win.
"He gave a fabulous talk in my
class on Friday," he said. "I had told
my students to show up since the
guest lecturer they were about to lis
ten to might win the Nobel prize the
following Monday, and he did!"
While Roth is at the forefront of
market design research and theory,
Levin explained that he always finds

time for his students, for whom he
has great affection. Four of his for
mer doctoral advisees are now facul
ty members at Stanford, a record
matched only by professor of eco
nomics Kenneth Arrow, who also
received a Nobel prize in economics
back in 1972.
"A1 is one of the nicest people I
know," said Muriel Niederle, profes
sor of economics and a former doc
toral advisee of Roth's in an email to
The Daily. "A1 as an advisor is almost
like A1 as a parent: he is very invest
ed in his students, very accessible,
and he deeply cares...his door was
always open, and usually you would
find a student (or a former student
visiting) inside."
This close relationship with his
students was one of the biggest fac
tors that caused Roth to choose to
move from Harvard to Stanford last
year, after 14 years spent in
Cambridge. He will become a full
time professor beginning January
2013.
"Harvard was great but one of
the biggest attractions of Stanford
was that many of my wonderful stu
dents are professors here, and I get
to be their colleague now," he said.
His former students see him as
more than just a colleague. For
example, Roth is almost always on
the guest list of his former students'
weddings, and has even officiated
one.
Roth's schedule will remain busy
over the next few weeks and months.
He has scheduled interviews with
journalists from The Economist, the
Los Angeles Times and the New
York Times and will attend both a
White House reception, as well as his
award ceremony in Stockholm.
"The ceremony is on Dec. 10,
which is the anniversary of Alfred
Nobel's birth. Or death," he said.
"Maybe I should get that fact straight
before the ceremony."
