## SEEING GREEN Measuring up to the happiness standard 
### Holly Moeller 
By all accounts, my friend Lori
has a fabulous sense of style.
Plus, she really knows how to
find a bargain. The outfits she assem
bles from Goodwill and vintage cloth
ing shops continue to defy expecta
tions and imitation. Years ago,
when we both lived in Boston, 1 snuck
glances at the pages she flagged in her
fashion magazines. Now, whenever 1
catch her during her visits home to
the Bay Area, I file away shopping
tips while we fill each other in on our
lives.
One evening, perhaps a year and a
half ago, as we considered the San
Francisco skyline over cocktails, Lori
told me about how she'd been flip
ping through a rack of clothes on a
recent shopping trip when it struck
her that finding the best deal no
longer held the same appeal. "I real
ized that I don't want things," she
said. "I want time. With people. Like
this."
1 knew exactly what she meant.
Yes, I like the feeling of slipping
into a fabulous new outfit. 1 have a
disturbingly intense affection for my
road bike and two touring kayaks.
And owning an iPad has made it pos
sible to (pretend to) do work while
streaming football games on my lap
top.
But in the end, I don't remember
the cut of a particular hemline, the
brand of my paddles, or the scores of
this season's Rutgers football games
(though I do know that my Alma
Mater is 6-0!). Instead, I remember
experiences, and value them accord
ing to the happiness they brought me:
that conversation with Lori; circum
navigating Douglas Island by kayak;
spilling red wine on a white dress
while dancing with friends.
Last week, I wrote about the
importance of steady-state econom
ics, about how indefinite economic
growth is impossible given the limita
tions of planetary resources. I hinted
at the opportunity to reevaluate our
priorities along new lines lines
that consider the value of experience,
of family, of friends, instead of just
physical possessions.
The idea that monetary success is
a flawed measure of human welfare
has been bandied about for centuries.
It has floated around in the modern
political realm for decades, since
Robert Kennedy hinted at it in a
speech in 1968 and the King of
Bhutan coined the term "Gross
National Happiness" in 1972.
The King was looking for a
replacement for Gross Domestic
Product, a different metric for policy
makers to maximize. But while we
can all agree that human welfare
stems from many factors besides
money, how can we measure it?

The Bhutanese incarnation of the
GNH concept draws heavily upon the
country's Buddhist roots but high
lights four policy pillars of universal
appeal: sustainable development,
preservation of cultural values, con
servation of the natural environment
and good governance. Subsequent
iterations have provided variations
on this theme, emphasizing things like
"subjective well-being" or a combina
tion of wellness measures ranging
from economic to social to physical.
To quantify "happiness," policymak
ers rely on surveys designed in con
cert with sociologists and psycholo
gists, looking for correlates between
health, job security or family life and
responses to questions like, "Were
you happy yesterday? This year?"
Such metrics will never be as con
crete as euros and cents, but at a time
when economic uncertainty is high,
many are being converted to the hap
piness standard. Last April, the
United Nations held a Conference on
Happiness and the Columbia
University Earth Institute released
the first World Happiness Report (in
which the United States ranked 11
out of 156, beaten out by European
countries like Denmark, Norway and
Finland). Tellingly, the report's analy
sis found that while richer countries
were happier (with several struggling
African nations falling to the bottom
of the rankings), in the end, the happi
est countries differentiated them
selves on social and political factors,
like healthy family lives and reduced
corruption.
For all the good that emphasizing
happiness could do us, today we live
in a society dominated by the dollar.
Yet we've all had Lori's moments of
realization, when material posses
sions fall away and only experiences
and emotions matter. By keeping that
realization in mind, we can adjust our
individual lives and gradually shift
social mores to value our whole
human experience, not just the mone
tary and physical trappings we use as
decoration.
And in this time of economic
hardship, trading in a shopping trip
for a camping one can be good for the
wallet and the soul. At least, my
kayaks think so.
