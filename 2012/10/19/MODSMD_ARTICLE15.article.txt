# Stanford conducts elephant research with a solar-powered center
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Liam Kinney 
Stanford researchers in South
Africa have established a solar-pow
ered seasonal research center for
studying elephants.
The center uses revolutionary solar
powered cameras and audio equip
ment to quietly and effectively monitor
elephants in a Mushara waterhole in
Namibia's Etosha National Park.
"One of the really special aspects of
solar energy is that it allows us to be in
this incredibly remote area that's
closed to tourists and is off the grid,"
said Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, the

project's lead researcher and collabo
rating scientist at Stanford's Center for
Conservation Biology, to the Stanford
News Service.
"We get to watch elephant society
unfold before us in a very quiet envi
ronment," O'Connell-Rodwell said.
Using solar-powered speakers, the
center emits low-frequency sounds to
gather elephants at the watering hole.
The center's panels also run an ele
phant dung laboratory, editing equip
ment for the video crew, power for two
12-volt refrigerators and the team's
computers. Through these means,
O'Connell-Rodwell is able to send reg
ular blog posts to the New York Times
about the research at Mushara.
To ensure that other animals in the
area like rhinos, giraffes and lions
would not impede the research at the
campsite, the Mushara research center
installed a solar-powered electric fence
around the waterhole's perimeter that
emits a harmless shock.
"It will just scare them away,"
researcher Tim Rodwell said.
All the high-tech electronics in the
center are run off solar panels, some
batteries and an inverter. The
researchers easily dismantled the
entire system and returned home for
the season but plan to reconstruct the
entire center and continue their ongo
ing elephant studies.
