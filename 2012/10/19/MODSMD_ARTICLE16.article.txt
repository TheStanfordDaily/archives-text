## MEN'S SWIMMING TIME TO SUIT UP NEW COACH KNAPP LEADS STANFORD IN NEW SEASON 
### RYAN HOAGLUND 
Stanford's men's swimming and diving team was
among the top teams in the nation last season, tak
ing third at the NCAA championships. This year,
with a new coaching staff, the Cardinal will look to
maintain its status as an elite program and build on
last season's successes.
Although new in his role as head coach, Ted
Knapp is anything but a stranger when it comes to
Stanford swimming and diving. For 28 years he
served as assistant coach under International
Swimming Hall of Famer Skip Kenney, who retired
at the end of last season.
"The transition has been pretty exciting," Knapp

said, "for the most part because I feel like I've been
well prepared by Skip Kenney, my predecessor."
He also credits his "great staff," and said he expects
them to "add some great energy and innovation."
Some coaches might feel intimidated when mov
ing to the helm of such a powerful program. Knapp,
however, is "fired up" and has appeared cool and
confident so far in the role.
"We have several seniors looking to finish up
strong," Knapp said.
Among those contending for individual champi
onships are seniors Aaron Wayne and Andrew
Saeta. Wayne made the final in both the 50 yard and

100 yard freestyle at last year's NCAA champi
onship, and Saeta swam in the finals of the 200 and

400 freestyle relays. Both swimmers are positive
about the coaching changes, and are looking for
ward to another successful season.
"Everyone is really optimistic. We're really liking
the training that we're doing under [assistant] coach
Scott Armstrong," Wayne said of the first few weeks
of practice.
Saeta attributes much of last year's success to
weight training, and is looking forward to positive
results as the team focuses more on weights this sea
son.
"The entire team is really working on power and
strength," Saeta said, "and I think we're going to see
a lot of benefits from that as
the season develops."
As in any sport, a new sea
son brings about a shuffling of
personnel, as last year's seniors
are replaced by this year's
freshmen. The Cardinal will
certainly miss its graduated tal
ent, including distance
freestyler Chat La Tourette
and butterflyer Robert Bollier,
but the team is confident the
freshmen will help to pick up
the slack, especially Tom
Kremer, Gray Umbach, and
Danny Thompson, who made
up three of the country's top
ten high school recruits last
year.

"It's a very versatile group,"
Knapp said. "They can con
tribute just about everywhere."
The team's chemistry is also
starting to come together.
Although swimming is a fairly
individual sport, most of those
who've swum competitively

say that a team is more than
just a group of athletes going
out and swimming for them
selves.
"We had a training trip to
the Olympic Training Center
before school started, and that
really works as a major team
bonding experience," Saeta
said.
As the swimmers prepare
physically for the meets ahead,
the coaches will prepare men
tally by strategizing meet line
ups, trying to determine who
belongs in what event and
where the team's strengths and
weaknesses lie.
Across the board, the
Cardinal is well-supplied with
talented and elite swimmers, but
one strength is definitely the 200
backstroke, which Wayne and
Saeta call Stanford's best event.
At NCAA championships last
season, the Cardinal took sec
ond, third and fourth, with then
freshman David Nolan missing
first by just hundredths of a sec
ond.
The freestyle events will
prove a critical point in the
meets according to coach

Knapp. "We definitely lost a
very strong core group of
freestylers, everywhere from the
50 and the 100 up to the 1650, so
you would think that like those
would be our weaker events.
But I feel we have the talent to
move up and replace some of
those lost points."
One potential weakness for
Stanford is the breaststroke.The
team's best breaststroker, Curtis
Lovelace, graduated last year,
but Knapp still feels that he has
"some people that can step up
and surprise us a little bit, and
maybe surprise the rest of the
country."
That chance to surprise has
all but arrived. While the Pac-12
and NCAA Championships
won't be held until March, this
Saturday the Cardinal will head
to Stockton for the Pacific
Invitational, the team's first
meet. Stanford is also set to
face Wisconsin a perennial
contender for the NCAA
championship â€” at a home
dual meet on Nov. 2.
