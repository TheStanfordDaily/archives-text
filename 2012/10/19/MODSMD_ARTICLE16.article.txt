## MEN'S SWIMMING TIME TO SUIT UP NEW COACH KNAPP LEADS STANFORD IN NEW SEASON 
### RYAN HOAGLUND 
Stanford's men's swimming and diving team was
among the top teams in the nation last season, tak

with a new coaching staff, the Cardinal will look to
maintain its status as an elite program and build on
last season's successes.
Although new in his role as head coach, Ted

weight training, and is looking forward to positive
results as the team focuses more on weights this sea
