# Beavers stunned
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing 2-1 with less than eight minutes to play
against visiting Oregon State, the Stanford men's
soccer team was in a very tight spot. After last week
end's loss to Washington dropped the Cardinal to
third place in the Pac-12, coach Jeremy Gunn's
squad could not afford anything less than a tie, but
the team was being frustrated by Oregon State's
stalling and defensive tactics even as the Cardinal
continued to outshoot its opponent.

Three minutes and two fortunate bounces later,
Stanford (6-6-1, 3-2-1 Pac-12) had shocked the
Beavers (6-6-2,1-4-1) with a stunning pair of goals
and held on down the stretch to win the match 3-2
on Thursday night.
As has been an issue for Stanford recently, it was
the Beavers who found their way onto the score
board early with the Cardinal defense still finding its
footing due to some unusual circumstances. Gunn
chose to start regular goalkeeper Drew Hutchins as
the center back on defense with freshman defender
Brandon Vincent suspended for the match after
earning a red card against Washington last weekend.
Hutchins' athleticism and defensive savvy
served him well; he won several balls in the air and
rarely was beat off the dribble. But when the always
dangerous Emery Welshman pounced on a loose
ball in the left corner just five minutes into the
match and played a brilliant ball across the goal to
Khiry Shelton, Stanford's defense was helpless as
Shelton volleyed the ball into the net for a goal that

was very much against the early run of play.
But Stanford's response was telling. Redshirt
junior Jason Dodson, who earned his first start of
the year in goal with Hutchins in the back line,
immediately picked himself up and urged the
Cardinal's offense to pick up its play, which it did.
As the offense pressed higher and higher,

Oregon State was content to sink back and defend,
playing the counterattack with Welshman on
offense and threatening only occasionally. The strat
egy backfired soon enough, however, as Stanford
found an early equalizer in the 20th minute off a
corner kick. Junior Tyler Conklin flicked the ball to
the back post and Zach Batteer continued his hot
streak with his fourth goal in the last two weeks.
The Cardinal continued to apply pressure even
as the game grew choppy, with several hard fouls
and yellow cards on both sides. But despite out
shooting Oregon State 10-2, Stanford went into the

half with just the one goal.
Halftime brought a change in both teams' play,
as the fouls began to mount and the game descend
ed at times into a flurry of long balls back and forth
with brief stretches of individual skill from the for
wards on both sides and little connection with the
midfield.

Remarkably, it was Oregon State's wait-and-see
attack that paid dividends initially. The Beavers
counterattacked in the 60th minute and caught the
defense in an awkward position. Alex Penny played
a perfectly weighted through ball to Welshman and
he beat Dodson on a well-timed chip for his confer
ence-leading ninth goal of the year.
"It was really frustrating," Gunn said. "We'd
really only given away two chances in the first 60
minutes, and Oregon State scored off both. I

thought we were a bit hard
done to be 1-nil down, then 2-1,
because in the first half we
played quite well and created
some good chances. As the
game went along it was really
tough to go after them because
every time they counterat
tacked they looked very dan
gerous. The middle of the sec
ond half was really tough going
for us."

It only got tougher, as
Oregon State's tactics stalled
the Cardinal offense and the
Beavers almost added to the
score several times. Dodson

stopped a point-blank header
and a twisting shot from dis
tance to keep the match level.
But he needed the woodwork's
help to stop a screaming free
kick that would likely have salt
ed the game away in the 76th
minute the game also nearly
descended into a brawl on the
foul that set up the kick.

Several minutes without
any real chances for either side
abruptly ended in the 85th
minute, however, and Stanford
got its revenge.

Conklin split the defense on
a long run from his position at
left outside back, and whipped
in a cross that Oregon State
attempted to clear but instead
slammed straight into junior
midfielder J.J. Koval's leg. The
ricochet slipped past the goalie

and into the net as the Cardinal
celebrated a long-awaited
equalizer.

Momentum was finally on
Stanford's side, and just 44 sec
onds later, Conklin copied his
run from before almost identi
cally on the left side. This time,
his cross was to senior Eric
Anderson on the back post,
and although Anderson's
attempted volley did not con
nect, he was able to direct the
ball to a wide-open Adam Jahn
in the middle of the box. Jahn's
strike was true, giving him his
team-leading eighth goal of the
year and the game-winner.
Gunn was very pleased
with the team and Jahn's col
lective poise. "Adam is playing
great up front and I thought
today and in both games

against Oregon State he really
soaked the ball up well and
helped us keep possession, cre
ate attacks and obviously he's
scoring great goals as well,"
Gunn said. "He got two against
them last week and he got
another one against them
tonight. What better thing to do
than hit a game-winner late in
the game."
With a rematch against
Washington looming at
Sunday's Senior Day, Stanford
is still third in the Pac-12 but is
now just three points behind
the Huskies and two back of
UCLA with five games to play.
Sunday's match will kick off at
Cagan Stadium at 3 p.m.
