# Beavers stunned
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Trailing 2-1 with less than eight minutes to play
against visiting Oregon State, the Stanford men's
soccer team was in a very tight spot. After last week
end's loss to Washington dropped the Cardinal to
third place in the Pac-12, coach Jeremy Gunn's
squad could not afford anything less than a tie, but
the team was being frustrated by Oregon State's
stalling and defensive tactics even as the Cardinal
continued to outshoot its opponent.

Three minutes and two fortunate bounces later,
Stanford (6-6-1, 3-2-1 Pac-12) had shocked the
Beavers (6-6-2,1-4-1) with a stunning pair of goals
and held on down the stretch to win the match 3-2
on Thursday night.
As has been an issue for Stanford recently, it was
the Beavers who found their way onto the score
board early with the Cardinal defense still finding its
footing due to some unusual circumstances. Gunn
chose to start regular goalkeeper Drew Hutchins as
the center back on defense with freshman defender
Brandon Vincent suspended for the match after
earning a red card against Washington last weekend.
Hutchins' athleticism and defensive savvy
served him well; he won several balls in the air and
rarely was beat off the dribble. But when the always
dangerous Emery Welshman pounced on a loose
ball in the left corner just five minutes into the
match and played a brilliant ball across the goal to
Khiry Shelton, Stanford's defense was helpless as
Shelton volleyed the ball into the net for a goal that

was very much against the early run of play.
But Stanford's response was telling. Redshirt
junior Jason Dodson, who earned his first start of
the year in goal with Hutchins in the back line,
immediately picked himself up and urged the
Cardinal's offense to pick up its play, which it did.
As the offense pressed higher and higher,

Oregon State was content to sink back and defend,
playing the counterattack with Welshman on
offense and threatening only occasionally. The strat
egy backfired soon enough, however, as Stanford
found an early equalizer in the 20th minute off a
corner kick. Junior Tyler Conklin flicked the ball to
the back post and Zach Batteer continued his hot
streak with his fourth goal in the last two weeks.
The Cardinal continued to apply pressure even
as the game grew choppy, with several hard fouls
and yellow cards on both sides. But despite out
shooting Oregon State 10-2, Stanford went into the

half with just the one goal.
Halftime brought a change in both teams' play,
as the fouls began to mount and the game descend
ed at times into a flurry of long balls back and forth
with brief stretches of individual skill from the for
wards on both sides and little connection with the
midfield.

Remarkably, it was Oregon State's wait-and-see
attack that paid dividends initially. The Beavers
counterattacked in the 60th minute and caught the
defense in an awkward position. Alex Penny played
a perfectly weighted through ball to Welshman and
he beat Dodson on a well-timed chip for his confer
ence-leading ninth goal of the year.
"It was really frustrating," Gunn said. "We'd
really only given away two chances in the first 60
minutes, and Oregon State scored off both. I
