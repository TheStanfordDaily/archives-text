# Cagan hosts late drama
## CARD COMES ON STRONG 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Twenty minutes into the
Stanford women's soccer game on
Thursday night, Cardinal fans were
probably feeling pretty comfortable.
No. 2 Stanford had just taken a 2-0
lead against unranked Washington
State and had seemingly taken con
trol of the game.

To their credit, the Cougars had
other ideas as they roared back with
two goals before halftime to put the
pressure on the Cardinal. But
despite Washington State's best
efforts, Stanford ultimately pulled
out a 3-2 win to keep a firm hold on
first place in the Pac-12.
Early in the game, it was clear
that Washington was content to sit
back and defend. Stanford outside
backs Rachel Quon and Laura
Liedle repeatedly made dangerous
runs down the sidelines but the
Cardinal had trouble executing the
final pass.
"The first half was very tight
they played a high back line and
their forwards dropped and there
wasn't much space to play in,"
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
said.

Thirty minutes into the game,
Stanford finally broke through after
a beautiful passing sequence led to a
Cardinal corner. Redshirt junior for
ward Courtney Verloo sent the cor

ner kick in towards the front post,
where sophomore forward Lo'eau
Laßonta met the ball with a perfect
flick. Laßonta had played midfield
almost exclusively before moving up
to forward against Arizona, and
once again the change paid off for
the Cardinal.

Five minutes later, Stanford was
awarded a free kick in a dangerous
position after Quon and Verloo
worked the ball down the right side.
Sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu bent the free kick around
the wall and into the lower left cor
ner of the net to increase the
Cardinal lead to two.

Stanford maintained pressure on
the Cougar side, but Washington
State was able to create quick coun
terattacks from several sloppy give
aways. In the 25th minute, Cougar
forward Bethanie Skelton broke
free down the right side and crossed
the ball to Micaela Castain.The jun
ior forward shook off her Stanford
defender with a quick move and
slotted the ball past Cardinal goal
keeper Emily Oliver.
The Cardinal defense probably
felt deja vu when the Cougars
scored on a similar play with just six
minutes remaining in the half. In this
case, it was Washington State mid
fielder Zoe Jeffers charging down
the right side and forward Kourtney
Guetlein with the finish.

"They are a hard-working team
and I give them credit," Ratcliffe
said. "I was impressed with their
work ethic and I think that disrupted
us a little bit, especially after they
scored. Our level dropped and they
grew in confidence and I think that
evened the game out."
Despite the lost lead, the
Cardinal remained positive at half
time.
