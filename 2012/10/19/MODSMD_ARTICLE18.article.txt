# Cagan hosts late drama
## CARD COMES ON STRONG 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Twenty minutes into the
Stanford women's soccer game on
Thursday night, Cardinal fans were
probably feeling pretty comfortable.
No. 2 Stanford had just taken a 2-0
lead against unranked Washington
State and had seemingly taken con
trol of the game.

To their credit, the Cougars had
other ideas as they roared back with
two goals before halftime to put the
pressure on the Cardinal. But
despite Washington State's best
efforts, Stanford ultimately pulled
out a 3-2 win to keep a firm hold on
first place in the Pac-12.
Early in the game, it was clear
that Washington was content to sit
back and defend. Stanford outside
backs Rachel Quon and Laura
Liedle repeatedly made dangerous
runs down the sidelines but the
Cardinal had trouble executing the
final pass.
"The first half was very tight
they played a high back line and
their forwards dropped and there
wasn't much space to play in,"
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
said.

Thirty minutes into the game,
Stanford finally broke through after
a beautiful passing sequence led to a
Cardinal corner. Redshirt junior for
ward Courtney Verloo sent the cor

ner kick in towards the front post,
where sophomore forward Lo'eau
Laßonta met the ball with a perfect
flick. Laßonta had played midfield
almost exclusively before moving up
to forward against Arizona, and
once again the change paid off for
the Cardinal.

Five minutes later, Stanford was
awarded a free kick in a dangerous
position after Quon and Verloo
worked the ball down the right side.
Sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu bent the free kick around
the wall and into the lower left cor
ner of the net to increase the
Cardinal lead to two.

Stanford maintained pressure on
the Cougar side, but Washington
State was able to create quick coun
terattacks from several sloppy give
aways. In the 25th minute, Cougar
forward Bethanie Skelton broke
free down the right side and crossed
the ball to Micaela Castain.The jun
ior forward shook off her Stanford
defender with a quick move and
slotted the ball past Cardinal goal
keeper Emily Oliver.
The Cardinal defense probably
felt deja vu when the Cougars
scored on a similar play with just six
minutes remaining in the half. In this
case, it was Washington State mid
fielder Zoe Jeffers charging down
the right side and forward Kourtney
Guetlein with the finish.

"They are a hard-working team
and I give them credit," Ratcliffe
said. "I was impressed with their
work ethic and I think that disrupted
us a little bit, especially after they
scored. Our level dropped and they
grew in confidence and I think that
evened the game out."
Despite the lost lead, the
Cardinal remained positive at half
time.

"Every time we go down a
goal, we just have to come
back positive," senior captain
Rachel Quon said. "We know
we are on our home field and
we have our home field advan
tage and we just need to settle
the ball down and get another
one. I think we had multiple
chances so we knew it was
there."
However, the Cougars
came out strong in the second
half and shifted the play more
towards the Cardinal end.
Stanford's best chance of the
first fifteen minutes was a long
range shot by Courtney Verloo
that went just high.
Fans on both sides became
increasingly anxious as the
game became more aggressive.
"They're traditionally a
pretty physical team so we kind
of knew that was coming," jun
ior goalkeeper Emily Oliver
said. "I think that we had our
moments when we let that get
to us, but I think that for the

most part we responded pretty
well."
The Cardinal turned to a
familiar source for the winning
goal. In the 74th minute of the
game, Übogagu was fouled
deep in Cougar territory. She
quickly moved the free kick to
Rachel Quon who crossed it in.
Similar to the first Cardinal
goal, a crashing Stanford player
got a touch on it to redirect it
into the Cougar net. Waiting
there was senior captain
Mariah Noguiera, who got her
head on the ball for her team
leading seventh goal of the sea
son. Six of those goals have
been with her head.
"We work a lot on set plays
and we have some fantastic
players on dead ball situa
tions." Ratcliffe said. "It was a
fantastic play."
Once again, Washington
State refused to give up. If not
for Oliver's efforts in the net, the
game could have ended much
differently for the Cardinal. The
Ail-American made two bril
liant one-on-one saves against
Cougar forwards early in the
half to keep the game close.
However, the best was yet to
come when the junior goal

keeper made a fingertip save to
push a dangerous free kick over
the crossbar with 15 minutes
left in the game.
"Emily's an amazing goal
keeper," Ratcliffe said. "We
expect her to make big saves
in big games and once again
she came through."
The Cardinal will have to
move on quickly from the win
because it faces the
Washington this Sunday at
Cagan Stadium.
"I think in every area we
can always get a little better."
Oliver said. "Day to day, we
are always trying to get a little
better than the day before."
Not only is Sunday's game
another Pac-12 challenge, but
it is also Senior Night for the
Cardinal.
"The main thing is control
our emotions but let them
flow when we play," Ratcliffe
said. "I'm excited to have [the
seniors'] regular-season career
here at Stanford hopefully end
with a victory, but Washington
is a good team so we will have
to bring our 'A' game."

Early in the game, it was clear
that Washington was content to sit
back and defend. Stanford outside
backs Rachel Quon and Laura
Liedle repeatedly made dangerous
runs down the sidelines but the
Cardinal had trouble executing the
final pass.
"The first half was very tight
they played a high back line and
their forwards dropped and there
wasn't much space to play in,"
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe
said.

Thirty minutes into the game,
Stanford finally broke through after
a beautiful passing sequence led to a
Cardinal corner. Redshirt junior for
ward Courtney Verloo sent the cor

ner kick in towards the front post,
where sophomore forward Lo'eau
Laßonta met the ball with a perfect
flick. Laßonta had played midfield
almost exclusively before moving up
to forward against Arizona, and
once again the change paid off for
the Cardinal.

Five minutes later, Stanford was
awarded a free kick in a dangerous
position after Quon and Verloo
worked the ball down the right side.
Sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu bent the free kick around
the wall and into the lower left cor
ner of the net to increase the
Cardinal lead to two.

Stanford maintained pressure on
the Cougar side, but Washington
State was able to create quick coun
terattacks from several sloppy give
aways. In the 25th minute, Cougar
forward Bethanie Skelton broke
free down the right side and crossed
the ball to Micaela Castain.The jun
ior forward shook off her Stanford
defender with a quick move and
slotted the ball past Cardinal goal
keeper Emily Oliver.
The Cardinal defense probably
felt deja vu when the Cougars
scored on a similar play with just six
minutes remaining in the half. In this
case, it was Washington State mid
fielder Zoe Jeffers charging down
the right side and forward Kourtney
Guetlein with the finish.

"They are a hard-working team
and I give them credit," Ratcliffe
said. "I was impressed with their
work ethic and I think that disrupted
us a little bit, especially after they
scored. Our level dropped and they
grew in confidence and I think that
evened the game out."
Despite the lost lead, the
Cardinal remained positive at half
time.

"Every time we go down a
goal, we just have to come
back positive," senior captain
Rachel Quon said. "We know
we are on our home field and
we have our home field advan
tage and we just need to settle
the ball down and get another
one. I think we had multiple
chances so we knew it was
there."
However, the Cougars
came out strong in the second
half and shifted the play more
towards the Cardinal end.
Stanford's best chance of the
first fifteen minutes was a long
range shot by Courtney Verloo
that went just high.
Fans on both sides became
increasingly anxious as the
game became more aggressive.
"They're traditionally a
pretty physical team so we kind
of knew that was coming," jun
ior goalkeeper Emily Oliver
said. "I think that we had our
moments when we let that get
to us, but I think that for the

most part we responded pretty
well."
The Cardinal turned to a
familiar source for the winning
goal. In the 74th minute of the
game, Übogagu was fouled
deep in Cougar territory. She
quickly moved the free kick to
Rachel Quon who crossed it in.
Similar to the first Cardinal
goal, a crashing Stanford player
got a touch on it to redirect it
into the Cougar net. Waiting
there was senior captain
Mariah Noguiera, who got her
head on the ball for her team
leading seventh goal of the sea
son. Six of those goals have
been with her head.
"We work a lot on set plays
and we have some fantastic
players on dead ball situa
tions." Ratcliffe said. "It was a
fantastic play."
Once again, Washington
State refused to give up. If not
for Oliver's efforts in the net, the
game could have ended much
differently for the Cardinal. The
Ail-American made two bril
liant one-on-one saves against
Cougar forwards early in the
half to keep the game close.
However, the best was yet to
come when the junior goal

keeper made a fingertip save to
push a dangerous free kick over
the crossbar with 15 minutes
left in the game.
"Emily's an amazing goal
keeper," Ratcliffe said. "We
expect her to make big saves
in big games and once again
she came through."
The Cardinal will have to
move on quickly from the win
because it faces the
Washington this Sunday at
Cagan Stadium.
"I think in every area we
can always get a little better."
Oliver said. "Day to day, we
are always trying to get a little
better than the day before."
Not only is Sunday's game
another Pac-12 challenge, but
it is also Senior Night for the
Cardinal.
"The main thing is control
our emotions but let them
flow when we play," Ratcliffe
said. "I'm excited to have [the
seniors'] regular-season career
here at Stanford hopefully end
with a victory, but Washington
is a good team so we will have
to bring our 'A' game."

Despite blowing a 2-0 lead, the No. 2 Stanford women's soccer team and senior forward

Twenty minutes into the

No. 2 Stanford had just taken a 2-0
