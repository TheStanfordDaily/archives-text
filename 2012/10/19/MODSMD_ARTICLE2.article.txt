# PLAYING FOR KEEPS
## Axe on the line as Stanford and Cal square off in 115th Big Game 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Four seconds left. Five lateral passes.
Multiple missed tackles. The Stanford band
storms the field halfway through the kickoff
return. Cal running back Kevin Moen bursts
through a sea of red, pummeling a Stanford
trombone player as he somehow reaches the
end zone.

Game over.
It's been 30 years since "The Play," the
iconic, miraculous kickoff return touchdown
that gave Cal an improbable, controversial 25-
20 victory over Stanford. Three decades might
be a long time, but it's a play that not many
Stanford or Cal fans can forget.
Just ask head coach David Shaw.
"I was young and I remember being in dis
belief," said Shaw. "It happens on the school

yard; it doesn't happen in a major college foot
ball game. So many plays have happened since
then that are similar, but none are in the cate
gory of that play. It's iconic for college foot
ball."
On the heels of its controversial loss to
Notre Dame, No. 20 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pac-12)
squares off against cross-Bay rival Cal (3-4,2-

2 Pac-12) tomorrow at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium for the 115 th

edition of the Big Game.
"We can't really sit here and think about
Notre Dame anymore," nickelback Usua
Amanam said on Monday. "We lost. The game
is over. Move on to Cal."

After losing seven out of the eight games
played between 2002 and 2009, the Cardinal
has defeated the Golden Bears in their past

two meetings and currently
leads the series 57-46-11. But
the Stanford players know bet
ter than to underestimate their
rival, considering that even
with Andrew Luck at the helm
last season, they only managed
to squeak a three-point win
over the testy Bears.
Players and coaches on
both sides have commented on
this year's unusually early
scheduling of Big Game Week,
which is traditionally in late
November. In fact, tomorrow's
game marks the earliest date
that the two teams have met in
the history of the rivalry series.
"I don't like it," said Shaw.
"I think it's weird But it
doesn't matter when it is or
where it is. We'll be up for it."

The Cardinal defense will
face a mobile quarterback for
the fourth straight week in
Zach Maynard. Through seven
games, the redshirt senior has
amassed 1,537 yards through
the air and completed over 61
percent of his passes. Despite
tossing 10 touchdowns, his
seven interceptions on the sea
son indicate that consistency
has been an issue.

Already having seen
scramble-happy quarterbacks
in the likes of Keith Price and
Everett Golson, the defense
feels more confident in figur
ing out how to contain
Maynard. Stanford's front
seven looks to exploit a shaky
Cal offensive line that has
given up 29 sacks, which is
worst in the conference.

"It definitely helps that
we've faced some fast guys,"
said captain inside linebacker
Chase Thomas. "It's definitely
good preparation for what
we'll see from Cal's quarter
back."

The Bears' top threat at
running back is senior C.J.
Anderson, a Vallejo native
who, despite accounting for
just 71 rushing yards per game,
has been quietly efficient by
ripping off seven yards every
touch. One of the most impor
tant matchups this Saturday
pits Cal's steady running
attack, ranked third in the Pac
-12, against Stanford's stingy
run defense, ranked behind
only Oregon State in the con
ference.
The Stanford secondary

also faces the challenging task
of keeping Keenan Allen,
Maynard's half-brother, in
check. The most explosive
player on Cal's offense, the
junior receiver is widely con
sidered to be one of the best in
the country and averages over
90 reception yards per game.
"[Allen] can get to speed
quickly, he runs strong, he runs
great routes and he can catch
the ball in traffic," said Shaw.
After failing to find the end
zone for the second consecu
tive road game, Stanford's
offense hopes to bounce back
from its sluggish performance
against Notre Dame last week.
Senior halfback Stepfan
Taylor ground out 102 yards
against one of the best run
defenses in the country last
Saturday and came up inches
short of sending the game into
double overtime. Having
already gone over the 100-yard
rushing mark four times this
season, Taylor needs only 95
more yards to surpass current
NFL running back Toby
Gerhart for second on the all
time Stanford career rushing
list.

While quarterback Josh
Nunes isn't pursuing any
records, the redshirt junior is
still in search of his first road
victory after an inefficient out
ing against the Irish that
included two first-quarter
interceptions. Nunes is cur
rently in the bottom three of
the conference in terms of
passing efficiency, and his sub
par completion percentage
stands at 53 percent.

"We still hold [Nunes]
accountable on what we
expect, like a high completion
percentage," said Shaw. "For
the throws that we believe he
can make, he's got to make
them It goes back to foot
work, being balanced. That's
what young quarterbacks need
to work on a lot."
But not all of the blame is
on Nunes. Against the Irish,
critical blocks were missed and
third-down-converting passes
were dropped.
"We have to play better,
not just [Nunes]," said Shaw.
"We haven't played well on
offense on the road. We can
play much better, and we're
going to need to play much
better."

Under the guidance of
defensive coordinator Clancy
Pendergast, Cal's defense has
learned to disguise its looks
and confuse opponents with
various schemes. The Bears
will have anywhere from two
to five linemen on a given play
and mix blitz packages with
nickel and dime coverage.
"[Cal's defense] is very
unique," said Shaw. "It reminds
me of stuff you see every week
in the NFL."

Despite dropping two of its
last four games, the Cardinal
has reason to be optimistic
midway through the regular
season. A 4-2 record is by no
means disappointing, consider
ing that Stanford has faced
four teams that were ranked in
the top 25 at some point this
year Cal is Stanford's first
opponent who comes into the
game with a losing record.
Though Oregon and Oregon
State remain perfect in Pac-12
play, the Cardinal is still very
much alive in the race for the
Pac-12 North title.

"It's a good place for us
right now," said Shaw. "I'm
pleased with a lot of things I've
seen so far from our team.
We're still in the conference
race, and we've got a chance to
finish the year strong."
Stanford and Cal battle for
the Axe in the 115 th Big Game
tomorrow. Kickoff is slated for
noon, with television coverage
on FOX.

to squeak a three-point win
over the testy Bears.
Players and coaches on
both sides have commented on
this year's unusually early
scheduling of Big Game Week,
which is traditionally in late
November. In fact, tomorrow's
game marks the earliest date
that the two teams have met in
the history of the rivalry series.
"I don't like it," said Shaw.
"I think it's weird But it
doesn't matter when it is or
where it is. We'll be up for it."

The Cardinal defense will
face a mobile quarterback for
the fourth straight week in
Zach Maynard. Through seven
games, the redshirt senior has
amassed 1,537 yards through
the air and completed over 61
percent of his passes. Despite
tossing 10 touchdowns, his
seven interceptions on the sea
son indicate that consistency
has been an issue.

Already having seen
scramble-happy quarterbacks
in the likes of Keith Price and
Everett Golson, the defense
feels more confident in figur
ing out how to contain
Maynard. Stanford's front
seven looks to exploit a shaky
Cal offensive line that has
given up 29 sacks, which is
worst in the conference.

"It definitely helps that
we've faced some fast guys,"
said captain inside linebacker
Chase Thomas. "It's definitely
good preparation for what
we'll see from Cal's quarter
back."

The Bears' top threat at
running back is senior C.J.
Anderson, a Vallejo native
who, despite accounting for
just 71 rushing yards per game,
has been quietly efficient by
ripping off seven yards every
touch. One of the most impor
tant matchups this Saturday
pits Cal's steady running
attack, ranked third in the Pac
-12, against Stanford's stingy
run defense, ranked behind
only Oregon State in the con
ference.
The Stanford secondary

also faces the challenging task
of keeping Keenan Allen,
Maynard's half-brother, in
check. The most explosive
player on Cal's offense, the
junior receiver is widely con
sidered to be one of the best in
the country and averages over
90 reception yards per game.
"[Allen] can get to speed
quickly, he runs strong, he runs
great routes and he can catch
the ball in traffic," said Shaw.
After failing to find the end
zone for the second consecu
tive road game, Stanford's
offense hopes to bounce back
from its sluggish performance
against Notre Dame last week.
Senior halfback Stepfan
Taylor ground out 102 yards
against one of the best run
defenses in the country last
Saturday and came up inches
short of sending the game into
double overtime. Having
already gone over the 100-yard
rushing mark four times this
season, Taylor needs only 95
more yards to surpass current
NFL running back Toby
Gerhart for second on the all
time Stanford career rushing
list.

While quarterback Josh
Nunes isn't pursuing any
records, the redshirt junior is
still in search of his first road
victory after an inefficient out
ing against the Irish that
included two first-quarter
interceptions. Nunes is cur
rently in the bottom three of
the conference in terms of
passing efficiency, and his sub
par completion percentage
stands at 53 percent.

"We still hold [Nunes]
accountable on what we
expect, like a high completion
percentage," said Shaw. "For
the throws that we believe he
can make, he's got to make
them It goes back to foot
work, being balanced. That's
what young quarterbacks need
to work on a lot."
But not all of the blame is
on Nunes. Against the Irish,
critical blocks were missed and
third-down-converting passes
were dropped.
"We have to play better,
not just [Nunes]," said Shaw.
"We haven't played well on
offense on the road. We can
play much better, and we're
going to need to play much
better."

Under the guidance of
defensive coordinator Clancy
Pendergast, Cal's defense has
learned to disguise its looks
and confuse opponents with
various schemes. The Bears
will have anywhere from two
to five linemen on a given play
and mix blitz packages with
nickel and dime coverage.
"[Cal's defense] is very
unique," said Shaw. "It reminds
me of stuff you see every week
in the NFL."

Despite dropping two of its
last four games, the Cardinal
has reason to be optimistic
midway through the regular
season. A 4-2 record is by no
means disappointing, consider
ing that Stanford has faced
four teams that were ranked in
the top 25 at some point this
year Cal is Stanford's first
opponent who comes into the
game with a losing record.
Though Oregon and Oregon
State remain perfect in Pac-12
play, the Cardinal is still very
much alive in the race for the
Pac-12 North title.

"It's a good place for us
right now," said Shaw. "I'm
pleased with a lot of things I've
seen so far from our team.
We're still in the conference
race, and we've got a chance to
finish the year strong."
Stanford and Cal battle for
the Axe in the 115 th Big Game
tomorrow. Kickoff is slated for
noon, with television coverage
on FOX.

Four seconds left. Five lateral passes.
Multiple missed tackles. The Stanford band
storms the field halfway through the kickoff
return. Cal running back Kevin Moen bursts
through a sea of red, pummeling a Stanford
trombone player as he somehow reaches the
end zone.

Game over.
It's been 30 years since "The Play," the
iconic, miraculous kickoff return touchdown
that gave Cal an improbable, controversial 25-
20 victory over Stanford. Three decades might
be a long time, but it's a play that not many
Stanford or Cal fans can forget.
Just ask head coach David Shaw.
"I was young and I remember being in dis
belief," said Shaw. "It happens on the school

yard; it doesn't happen in a major college foot
ball game. So many plays have happened since
then that are similar, but none are in the cate
gory of that play. It's iconic for college foot
ball."
On the heels of its controversial loss to
Notre Dame, No. 20 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pac-12)
squares off against cross-Bay rival Cal (3-4,2-

2 Pac-12) tomorrow at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium for the 115 th

edition of the Big Game.
"We can't really sit here and think about
Notre Dame anymore," nickelback Usua
Amanam said on Monday. "We lost. The game
is over. Move on to Cal."

After losing seven out of the eight games
played between 2002 and 2009, the Cardinal
has defeated the Golden Bears in their past

two meetings and currently
leads the series 57-46-11. But
the Stanford players know bet
ter than to underestimate their
rival, considering that even
with Andrew Luck at the helm
last season, they only managed
to squeak a three-point win
over the testy Bears.
