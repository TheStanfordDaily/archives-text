# PLAYING FOR KEEPS
## Axe on the line as Stanford and Cal square off in 115th Big Game 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Four seconds left. Five lateral passes.
Multiple missed tackles. The Stanford band
storms the field halfway through the kickoff
return. Cal running back Kevin Moen bursts
through a sea of red, pummeling a Stanford
trombone player as he somehow reaches the
end zone.

Game over.
It's been 30 years since "The Play," the
iconic, miraculous kickoff return touchdown
that gave Cal an improbable, controversial 25-
20 victory over Stanford. Three decades might
be a long time, but it's a play that not many
Stanford or Cal fans can forget.
Just ask head coach David Shaw.
"I was young and I remember being in dis
belief," said Shaw. "It happens on the school

yard; it doesn't happen in a major college foot
ball game. So many plays have happened since
then that are similar, but none are in the cate
gory of that play. It's iconic for college foot
ball."
On the heels of its controversial loss to
Notre Dame, No. 20 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pac-12)
squares off against cross-Bay rival Cal (3-4,2-

2 Pac-12) tomorrow at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium for the 115 th

edition of the Big Game.
"We can't really sit here and think about
Notre Dame anymore," nickelback Usua
Amanam said on Monday. "We lost. The game
is over. Move on to Cal."

After losing seven out of the eight games
played between 2002 and 2009, the Cardinal
has defeated the Golden Bears in their past
