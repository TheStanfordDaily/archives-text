### Sam Fisher 
Ouch. Not sure there's a
much better way to
classify the feeling
heading into Big
Game after a brutal
loss at Notre Dame. For most of that
rainy afternoon, I felt like I was watch
ing an only slightly modified recording
of Stanford at Washington from just a
few weeks earlier. From the great early
defense to the atrocious first-half pass
ing game, the defensive touchdown to
the late defensive breakdown, we have
all seen that story before.
With a hungry Cal team looking to
avenge an embarrassing 2010 home
loss and bring back the Axe for the first
time since 2009 taking on Stanford this
Saturday, will Stanford be able to
bounce back? I don't know, but if the
Cardinal would like to try to save its
season and hold onto the Axe, here's
what it has to do to survive on Saturday
in Berkeley.
Be efficient in the red zone
This has been perhaps the most
frustrating part of Stanford's season so
far, and never was it more evident than
against Notre Dame. Take Josh Nunes
throwing an unacceptable interception
on the 20 and Stanford's inability to
convert a short field goal attempt.
That's a minimum of six points that
Stanford squandered in the first half
alone. In a game that had a combined
26 points in regulation, six points make
an enormous difference.
Stanford also has struggled more
this season at scoring touchdowns
instead of field goals near the goal line.
Short field goals allowed Washington
and Notre Dame to hang around in
games that Stanford could have pulled
away in. The play calling around the
end zone was creative against Arizona
but not particularly effective in any
other game. Coach Shaw and offensive
coordinator Pep Hamilton will need to
come up with some answer to make
sure Big Game is not close in the
fourth quarter.
Josh Nunes absolutely cannot
throw interceptions in the red zone
against Cal. Memorial Stadium will be
loud for Big Game, and red-zone
turnovers are the easiest way to hand
momentum back to the home team.
Missed field goals do exactly the same.
It doesn't matter that Stanford's a bet
ter football team than Cal; Big Game
on the road requires tremendous exe
cution, and Stanford hasn't shown that
since Sept. 15 in the second half against
use.
Contain the explosive Cal passing
game
Looking at Cal's offense, I can see
two quick parallels to previous
Stanford opponents: USC and
Arizona. Keenan Allen, Cal's All-
American wide receiver, is up there
with Robert Woods and Marqise Lee
in the elite of college football. Stanford
did an excellent job of shutting down
that tandem with a combination of
great coverage on the outside by
Terrence Brown and great pressure up
front. Both of those will continue to be
keys on Saturday.
However, the parallel with Arizona
is just as scary and probably even more
accurate. Unlike with USC, Stanford
could not shut down Arizona, which
utilized a stable of wide outs and ath
letic quarterback play from Matt Scott
to move the ball at an unprecedented
pace against the Card. Cal quarterback
Zach Maynard, when he plays well, is
capable of playing very similarly to the
way Scott did at Stanford Stadium.
Maynard is athletic, will escape pres
sure and has the arm strength to make
tough throws.
The parallel doesn't stop with the
quarterback play. Keenan Allen is a
star, but he's not alone on the outside.
The Bears have three highly touted
true freshmen providing depth behind
Allen, and all of them can hurt
Stanford. Bryce Treggs and Darius
Powe were All-Americans last year in
high school, and Chris Harper already
has 18 catches for 212 yards at Cal.
Terrence Brown will have to be great
against Allen, but Barry Browning,
Wayne Lyons, Alex Carter and Usua
Amanam will also need to step it up in
coverage to keep those freshmen in
check.
Don't let Cal hang around
This is far and away the most
important key for Stanford to win Big
Game. This year is the 30th anniversary
of "The Play," a perfect example of
how officiating and general craziness
can rob you of a victory in this rivalry if
the game is close at the end. Stanford
had a similar horror ending at Notre
Dame, where many feel the
Cardinal was robbed of a
touchdown in overtime on the
game's last play. However,
Stanford had no business
allowing that game to even get
to overtime. Stanford squan
dered chance after chance to
put it away early, and it came
back to haunt the Card in an
eerily similar way to the
September loss at Washington.

Memorial Stadium will be
loud; Cal's fans are desperate
for a Big Game victory. Jeff
Tedford's job may be on the
line. The Bears are desperately

looking to avenge two straight
losses to their biggest rival. If
Cal has an opportunity to win
the game near the end, it just
might be able to do so. Stanford
needs to do everything in its
power to make sure Cal can't
even dream of a victory by the
start of the fourth quarter. No
more turnovers in the red zone,
no more missed open receivers,
no more drops and certainly no
missed short field goals. If
Stanford makes too many mis
takes, it could be a long drive
back to the Farm through traf
fic without the Axe in tow.

Sam Fisher really doesn't
want to make that drive. Let
him know why he won't
have to at safisher@stan

game's last play. However,
Stanford had no business
allowing that game to even get
to overtime. Stanford squan
dered chance after chance to
put it away early, and it came
back to haunt the Card in an
eerily similar way to the
September loss at Washington.

Memorial Stadium will be
loud; Cal's fans are desperate
for a Big Game victory. Jeff
Tedford's job may be on the
line. The Bears are desperately

looking to avenge two straight
losses to their biggest rival. If
Cal has an opportunity to win
the game near the end, it just
might be able to do so. Stanford
needs to do everything in its
power to make sure Cal can't
even dream of a victory by the
start of the fourth quarter. No
more turnovers in the red zone,
no more missed open receivers,
no more drops and certainly no
missed short field goals. If
Stanford makes too many mis
takes, it could be a long drive
back to the Farm through traf
fic without the Axe in tow.

Sam Fisher really doesn't
want to make that drive. Let
him know why he won't
have to at safisher@stan

Ouch. Not sure there's a
much better way to
classify the feeling
heading into Big
Game after a brutal
loss at Notre Dame. For most of that
rainy afternoon, I felt like I was watch
ing an only slightly modified recording
of Stanford at Washington from just a
few weeks earlier. From the great early
defense to the atrocious first-half pass
ing game, the defensive touchdown to
the late defensive breakdown, we have
all seen that story before.
With a hungry Cal team looking to
avenge an embarrassing 2010 home
loss and bring back the Axe for the first
time since 2009 taking on Stanford this
Saturday, will Stanford be able to
bounce back? I don't know, but if the
Cardinal would like to try to save its
season and hold onto the Axe, here's
what it has to do to survive on Saturday
in Berkeley.
Be efficient in the red zone
This has been perhaps the most
frustrating part of Stanford's season so
far, and never was it more evident than
against Notre Dame. Take Josh Nunes
throwing an unacceptable interception
on the 20 and Stanford's inability to
convert a short field goal attempt.
That's a minimum of six points that
Stanford squandered in the first half
alone. In a game that had a combined
26 points in regulation, six points make
an enormous difference.
Stanford also has struggled more
this season at scoring touchdowns
instead of field goals near the goal line.
Short field goals allowed Washington
and Notre Dame to hang around in
games that Stanford could have pulled
away in. The play calling around the
end zone was creative against Arizona
but not particularly effective in any
other game. Coach Shaw and offensive
coordinator Pep Hamilton will need to
come up with some answer to make
sure Big Game is not close in the
fourth quarter.
Josh Nunes absolutely cannot
throw interceptions in the red zone
against Cal. Memorial Stadium will be
loud for Big Game, and red-zone
turnovers are the easiest way to hand
momentum back to the home team.
Missed field goals do exactly the same.
It doesn't matter that Stanford's a bet
ter football team than Cal; Big Game
on the road requires tremendous exe
cution, and Stanford hasn't shown that
since Sept. 15 in the second half against
use.
Contain the explosive Cal passing
game
Looking at Cal's offense, I can see
two quick parallels to previous
Stanford opponents: USC and
Arizona. Keenan Allen, Cal's All-
American wide receiver, is up there
with Robert Woods and Marqise Lee
in the elite of college football. Stanford
did an excellent job of shutting down
that tandem with a combination of
great coverage on the outside by
Terrence Brown and great pressure up
front. Both of those will continue to be
keys on Saturday.
However, the parallel with Arizona
is just as scary and probably even more
accurate. Unlike with USC, Stanford
could not shut down Arizona, which
utilized a stable of wide outs and ath
letic quarterback play from Matt Scott
to move the ball at an unprecedented
pace against the Card. Cal quarterback
Zach Maynard, when he plays well, is
capable of playing very similarly to the
way Scott did at Stanford Stadium.
Maynard is athletic, will escape pres
sure and has the arm strength to make
tough throws.
The parallel doesn't stop with the
quarterback play. Keenan Allen is a
star, but he's not alone on the outside.
The Bears have three highly touted
true freshmen providing depth behind
Allen, and all of them can hurt
Stanford. Bryce Treggs and Darius
Powe were All-Americans last year in
high school, and Chris Harper already
has 18 catches for 212 yards at Cal.
Terrence Brown will have to be great
against Allen, but Barry Browning,
Wayne Lyons, Alex Carter and Usua
Amanam will also need to step it up in
coverage to keep those freshmen in
check.
Don't let Cal hang around
This is far and away the most
important key for Stanford to win Big
Game. This year is the 30th anniversary
of "The Play," a perfect example of
how officiating and general craziness
can rob you of a victory in this rivalry if
the game is close at the end. Stanford
had a similar horror ending at Notre
Dame, where many feel the
Cardinal was robbed of a
touchdown in overtime on the
game's last play. However,
Stanford had no business
allowing that game to even get
to overtime. Stanford squan
dered chance after chance to
put it away early, and it came
