# Q&A
## YOUNG LEAVES DEFENSES IN THE DUST 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
If you don't know exactly what to
call sophomore Kelsey Young, join the
club. He's one of Stanford's fastest
offensive players, a running back by
training who has broken onto the play
ing field as a receiver since transition
ing last spring.
"When he sees something, and he
just lets his instincts take over, he can
be electric," said running backs coach
Mike Sanford.
Young has caught four passes for 18
yards this season; his 88 rushing yards
also make him the Cardinal's second
leading rusher behind Stepfan Taylor.
He got into the end zone for the first
time in college with a 55-yard fly sweep
against Arizona. The Daily spoke to
him recently about playing under for
mer Cardinal great Toby Gerhart's
dad, managing two positions and earn
ing his first touchdown.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The first
thing I hear about you when I talk to
anyone is speed. I want to clarify this
because I've gotten a few different
answers from different people, but if
you put the whole team in a footrace,
where do you finish?
Kelsey Young (KY): Well, 40[-yard
dash] times in the spring have Ty
Montgomery ahead of me, and I'm
probably right behind him, neck-and
neck with him. So that's what the 40
time says, but on the field I feel like
nobody can catch me.
TSD: You went to Norco High School

and were coached by Toby Gerhart's
dad. I'm sure you heard a lot about
Stanford going there.
KY: Yeah, definitely. When he was
going here they would always talk
about the Stanford program, the foot
ball team, just a smashmouth program,
kind of like what Norco prides them
selves on having. So that really
intrigued me about the running down
hill attack, up the middle, head-on col
lisions and everything.

TSD: The coaching staff isn't really
sure where to use you yet. You've
played some at wide receiver, some at
running back. What does that mean for
you in terms of practices, meetings, film
study how do you juggle both of
those positions at the same time?
KY: Yeah, definitely. My whole life I've
been playing running back, so it's like
lately they've been really trying to
groom me as a receiver. More I'm in

the meeting rooms with receivers just
to know the caveats of that position
more often, and as a running back I
think that's more of my instinctual tal
ent, just because I've been playing it for
my entire life.

TSD: Where do you see yourself in two
years? I talked to coach Sanford and
he told me he doesn't necessarily see
you as an every-down back, because of
your explosiveness. Do you see your-

self as a running back or a receiver?
KY:I see myself — I mean, I'm not try
ing to get ahead of myself or anything
but my goal before I leave Stanford
is to compete to be the best running
back and receiver in the country. So
just to pride myself as both, not only to
be an explosive player but to also get a
good ground, a good basis where I can
run up the middle on every down. And
then if they need me as a receiver, in
the slot or outside, I can do the same
thing. So it might not be a seemingly
realistic goal, but it's definitely some
thing that I pride myself on.

TSD: One last question: Talk about
that fly sweep against Arizona that you
scored on. Why do you think it's so
suited to you? You've run it a few
times.

KY: Definitely, because especially for
[that] game, the previous play
Remound Wright went up the middle
for about 15 yards, so after that I
would assume that the defense had
just crowded up the middle, thinking
that we would do the same thing since
we had success. But then, I think that
the coaches used me kind of as a hay
maker, you know, to come out the side
once the defense was clogged up the
middle, to sweep it outside. I had a
couple of those plays during the sea
son but I never really got the chance to
get outside, so this time I really got the
chance to get outside and everybody
blocked for me, so I was able to get that
touchdown.

Sophomore Kelsey Young (39) is a player without a position, but the hybrid offensive threat from Norco,
Calif, has found plenty of ways to get dangerous touches on the ball as both a running back and wide
receiver. Young took a fly sweep 55 yards to pay dirt on the play above against Arizona.

be an explosive player but to also get a
good ground, a good basis where I can
run up the middle on every down. And
then if they need me as a receiver, in
the slot or outside, I can do the same
thing. So it might not be a seemingly
realistic goal, but it's definitely some
thing that I pride myself on.

TSD: One last question: Talk about
that fly sweep against Arizona that you
scored on. Why do you think it's so
suited to you? You've run it a few
times.

KY: Definitely, because especially for
[that] game, the previous play
Remound Wright went up the middle
for about 15 yards, so after that I
would assume that the defense had
just crowded up the middle, thinking
that we would do the same thing since
we had success. But then, I think that
the coaches used me kind of as a hay
maker, you know, to come out the side
once the defense was clogged up the
middle, to sweep it outside. I had a
couple of those plays during the sea
son but I never really got the chance to
get outside, so this time I really got the
chance to get outside and everybody
blocked for me, so I was able to get that
touchdown.

Sophomore Kelsey Young (39) is a player without a position, but the hybrid offensive threat from Norco,
Calif, has found plenty of ways to get dangerous touches on the ball as both a running back and wide
receiver. Young took a fly sweep 55 yards to pay dirt on the play above against Arizona.
If you don't know exactly what to
call sophomore Kelsey Young, join the
club. He's one of Stanford's fastest
offensive players, a running back by
training who has broken onto the play
ing field as a receiver since transition
ing last spring.
"When he sees something, and he
just lets his instincts take over, he can
be electric," said running backs coach
Mike Sanford.
Young has caught four passes for 18
yards this season; his 88 rushing yards
also make him the Cardinal's second
leading rusher behind Stepfan Taylor.
He got into the end zone for the first
time in college with a 55-yard fly sweep
against Arizona. The Daily spoke to
him recently about playing under for
mer Cardinal great Toby Gerhart's
dad, managing two positions and earn
ing his first touchdown.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): The first
thing I hear about you when I talk to
anyone is speed. I want to clarify this
because I've gotten a few different
answers from different people, but if
you put the whole team in a footrace,
where do you finish?
Kelsey Young (KY): Well, 40[-yard
dash] times in the spring have Ty
Montgomery ahead of me, and I'm
probably right behind him, neck-and
neck with him. So that's what the 40
time says, but on the field I feel like
nobody can catch me.
TSD: You went to Norco High School

and were coached by Toby Gerhart's
dad. I'm sure you heard a lot about
Stanford going there.
KY: Yeah, definitely. When he was
going here they would always talk
about the Stanford program, the foot
ball team, just a smashmouth program,
kind of like what Norco prides them
selves on having. So that really
intrigued me about the running down
hill attack, up the middle, head-on col
lisions and everything.

TSD: The coaching staff isn't really
sure where to use you yet. You've
played some at wide receiver, some at
running back. What does that mean for
you in terms of practices, meetings, film
study how do you juggle both of
those positions at the same time?
KY: Yeah, definitely. My whole life I've
been playing running back, so it's like
lately they've been really trying to
groom me as a receiver. More I'm in

the meeting rooms with receivers just
to know the caveats of that position
more often, and as a running back I
think that's more of my instinctual tal
ent, just because I've been playing it for
my entire life.

TSD: Where do you see yourself in two
years? I talked to coach Sanford and
he told me he doesn't necessarily see
you as an every-down back, because of
your explosiveness. Do you see your-

self as a running back or a receiver?
KY:I see myself — I mean, I'm not try
ing to get ahead of myself or anything
but my goal before I leave Stanford
is to compete to be the best running
back and receiver in the country. So
just to pride myself as both, not only to
be an explosive player but to also get a
good ground, a good basis where I can
run up the middle on every down. And
then if they need me as a receiver, in
the slot or outside, I can do the same
thing. So it might not be a seemingly
realistic goal, but it's definitely some
thing that I pride myself on.
