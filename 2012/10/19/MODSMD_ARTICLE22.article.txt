## FREAKY FRIDAY real talk on the sexiest day of the week 
### D.S. '13 | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
D.S. is a current Stanford senior who iden
tifies as a heterosexual woman.
It's true what they say. You never for
get your first orgasm. When friends
say they're "pretty sure" they've had
one, I tell them that they probably
haven't. "Trust me," I say. "When it hap
pens, you'll know."
When it happened to me, I knew. I
was 17, curious and alone in my bed. Up
to this point, my attempts at feeling
around down there had been less than
spectacular. I really wasn't sure if I was
doing it right. But this time things were
different, and something good was
building up inside me. All at once, I
exploded. I remember how amazed I felt
lying there afterwards, reeling from tiny
little aftershocks and wondering
whether I should call an ambulance.
What was that? How did it happen?
Most importantly, how can I make it
happen again?
I let my best friend know I'd
cracked the code, but aside from that I
didn't really talk about the experience
with my girl friends. Boys at my school
joked about jerking off all the time, but I
wasn't sure if girls were doing it too. At
some point, I started to wonder about
these gender differences. Do more guys
masturbate than girls, or do girls just
feel less comfortable admitting it?
Societal pressure to be a "good girl"
and to not focus on sex as much as boys
do probably has something to do with it.
But I think a lot of these differences in
masturbation practices have to do with

anatomy. Guys grow up with their
equipment in plain sight, and they han
dle it every pit stop at the urinal. Most
boys are well acquainted with their pleas
ure zones by the time they hit puberty.
But for girls, all the good stuff is tucked
away inside or hidden underneath our
skin, and we're left more familiar with
the neatly labeled diagrams of labia and
ovaries in our health textbooks than with
our own individual bodies.
This realization left me frustrated, and
after three years of hearing, "Great cervix,
you're normal!" from the voice on the
other end of the speculum, I finally caved
and Googled "gynecological exam video."
Of course, a guy friend walked in on me
watching it and I had some awkward
explaining to do, but all of that is inciden
tal. I finally knew what a cervix looked
like, and that was what mattered.
I'm not saying you should go watch
weird, invasive medical procedures on
the Internet, unless you're into that sort
of thing, but please, girls who are read
ing this: get to know your bodies! Don't
be afraid to explore yourself. You'll get a
better sense of what works for you and
what doesn't, what gets you going, what
pushes your buttons.
I'm a big believer in knowing how to
do something well before you try to
teach it to somebody else; What I'm
saying is, figuring out what gets you off
and becoming more comfortable com
municating these needs to others will
make things a whole lot easier on your
sexual partners. But the best part, the
most empowering part, is that these sex

ual partners are only part of your equa
tion. Learning to exercise control over
your body, mastering your pleasure
zones, gaining confidence in the fact that
you don't need a partner to experience
pleasure and orgasm in my mind,
this is what's most important.
While the male orgasm has a pretty
clear role in reproduction, to this day, no
one has figured out the function of the
female orgasm although there are
several popular theories, mostly based
on how orgasms might promote con
ception or simply encourage females to
have sex more often. But what doctors
do know is that orgasms are incredibly
good for you! Studies show that the fre
quent occurrence of orgasms has been
linked to lower rates of stress, depression
and cardiovascular disease.
And, speaking from personal experi
ence, an orgasm is hands down the best
physical feeling you can experience in
your earthly life. There shouldn't be any
shame or embarrassment associated
with masturbation (unless your room
mate constandy walks in on you, in
which case you should be ashamed for
not locking the door or at least hanging
a sock on the doorknob). After all, keep
ing STIs and unplanned pregnancies in
mind, sex with yourself is the safest sex
you can have.
The bottom line here? The more we
come to understand our own bodies, the
more safe and healthy physical pleasure
we can experience in them. Get to know
yourself, and I mean all of yourself. You
deserve that.
