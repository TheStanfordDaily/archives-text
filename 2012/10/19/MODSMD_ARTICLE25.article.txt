# THE
						SCRIPT'S '#3' IS A PASS

Over the summer, fans of British
mainstream rock were thrown
into genuine panic upon the
release of two much-awaited singles,
each by one of the biggest bands in
England and Ireland, respectively. One of
these notorious new tracks was Muse's
"Unsustainable," which was heavily
influenced by the dreaded genre of dub
step but simply wasn't heavy enough to
be good. The other was "Hall of Fame,"
the lead single from The Script's third
and dryly titled album, "#3."
Many fans were shocked to hear
singer Danny O'Donoghue rap along
side will.i.am., his co- judge on "The
Voice," but the band's penchant for hip
hop music is nothing new. The band
mates have always cited American R&B,
hip-hop and reggae artists as their idols.

Evidences of such influence can be
found in their earliest material, most
obviously in their stellar cover of "Lose
Yourself," which was included in one of
the singles for their eponymous debut
album. The "sing-rapping" of Danny
O'Donoghue has been a consistent,
defining style of The Script throughout
all three of their albums, so what's so
disappointing about "#3"?
The Script has been likened to basi
cally every band out there that makes
anthem-ambitious, soft piano rock.
True, The Script was never famed for its
originality, but its signature hybrid of
genres and styles has been its sustaining
factor so far. That melodic diversity that
worked so brilliantly well in its debut
album seemed to fade in its second:
"Science & Faith" was more or less a
self-conscious extension of "Live Like
We're Dying," a B-side from their first
album and the band's first beacon of
success in the U.S. "#3" does not deviate
from that direction (perhaps taken in
the hopes of breaking the States), but
escapes the vapidity of "Science &
Faith."
Though certainly listenable, "#3"
fails to excel. The Script have found
what they like, but lost what they do
well. They are indeed one of the biggest
crowd drawers to come out of post-mil
