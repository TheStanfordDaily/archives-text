Trigger Warning: The following content
deals with issues surrounding sexual assaidt
and may be triggering to some readers.

cc -w-want you to rape me," I said to my
I ex-boyfriend a few months into our
He didn't even need
to respond for me to notice the fearful and
dumbfounded look on his face. It was dif
ficult to imagine him, a kind, gentle guy, as
an aggressive sexual partner.
"What do you mean?" he asked, baffled. I
knew him to be a smart Stanford student,
but a question like this, so far out of the
comfort zone, seemed to throw him for a
loop.
Don't worry ... this is not another col
umn of borderline erotica. After a recent
controversial anonymous piece in The
Daily's Intermission section, I felt it was nec
essary to do justice to both brave survivors of
sexual assault and people who feel comfort
able enough to safely express their sexual
fantasies, no matter how out-there they may
seem.
Of course, I did not actually want to be
raped. So what do these desires signify? Am I
perverse for having these feelings? As an avid
supporter of sexual and emotional health on
campus and a member of SHPRC, how could I
enact my passions without being insensitive to
actual victims of rape and other sexual violence?
I had the privilege to interview Dr. Jenn
Berman, a renowned Los Angeles psychothera
pist and host of VHl's new show, "Couples
Therapy," where she does comprehensive
counseling with celebrity partners. Dr. Berman
also has a daily radio show known as "The
Love and Sex Show with Dr. Jenn," and has
been an expert psychotherapist on countless
shows from "The Oprah Winfrey Show" to
"The Today Show."

Intermission: What does it mean to have a
rape fantasy? Is there sometfiing wrong with

people who fantasize about rape?
Dr. Berman: It is very normal to have a
rape fantasy. There is a really big difference
between a rape fantasy and the actual experi
ence of being raped. There is nothing wrong
with a fantasy. In the fantasy you are in control
because it is your fantasy. It is the difference
between an exciting experience and a terrifying
reality.
You are the architect of your fantasy ... you
decide when your shirt gets ripped off, and
how far things go. This is the opposite of truly
being violated and raped.
INT: Just because someone fantasizes about
being dominated or "raped," does it mean they
want to actually be raped?
Dr. Berman: This is an important thing for
[people] to be clear on. It doesn't mean you
actually want to be raped. It is important to
understand that fantasies are different from
reality. [Rape] can be catastrophic in reality.
Even something like a threesome can be great
in fantasy, but bringing it into a relationsfiip
may be very different than how you imagined.
INT: What if someone is a survivor and still
fantasizes about rape?
Dr. Berman: Typically when someone who
is a survivor has a fantasy, it is about redoing
the experience where they are in control.
Sometimes it can be difficult for someone to
make sense of this kind of trauma. But it is
important to talk about it in therapy and with
someone who can offer you professional feed
back so you don't act out sometfiing that
might violate you again.
INT: How do I know I can trust my part
ner not to take a rape role-play too far?
Dr. Berman: It is important not to act out a
rape fantasy with a new partner, with someone
you don't know very well. It is important that
they have proved to you they are already trust
worthy over a course of time. It is important
that you have a safety word; [the safety word]
needs to be something you would never nor
mally say.

INT: Why are pieces like "Fifty Shades of
Grey" or the idea of domination so sexy or
arousing to many people, women in particular?
Dr. Berman: There are many aspects that
are appealing to women today. Women today
take on a lot ... we are more educated, more
career-oriented ... juggling more hats.
Sometimes the idea of not being in charge and
getting to be submissive can be very appealing.
It is about being desired, being validated ...
the idea of someone being so overcome with
lust for you (in the fantasy) can be very validat
ing. The reality of rape is about hurting some
one, not necessarily about sex.
INT: Do you think heterosexual men have
any fantasies of being raped?
Dr. Berman: The male fantasy is more about
being dominated than raped. It is not uncom
mon, especially for high-powered men, to have
fantasies about being dominated in bed, when

they are alpha males all day long at work
As Dr. Jenn noted, if you want your partner
to do something like sneak into your bedroom
wearing a burglar-type ski mask, it is key to
develop something like a safe word. I would
recommend something like "panda," unless
there is somehow a panda incorporated into
your intimate play. No judgments here, just
know that the panda in question may not
understand your human safe word.
Most importantly, in order to feel safe in
your fantasy, you need to trust that your
partner will respect your limits and
stop when you want him or her to.
Maybe you want to try out an
intense fantasy, but you don't feel
quite ready yet. It can be fun to
try a few stepping stone type I
activities to test your bound
aries, exercise your trust and prac-"
tice using your safe word. Perhaps
try a blindfold be creative and use
a tie, a scarf, your "Fear the Tree" shirt ... just
kidding (kind of).
Note: If you feel like you need someone to
talk to, please reach out to the Sexual Assault
& Relationship Abuse (SARA) office,
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Vaden, or the Bridge.

Trigger Warning: The following content

and may be triggering to some readers.

cc -w-want you to rape me," I said to my
I ex-boyfriend a few months into our
He didn't even need
to respond for me to notice the fearful and
dumbfounded look on his face. It was dif
ficult to imagine him, a kind, gentle guy, as
an aggressive sexual partner.
"What do you mean?" he asked, baffled. I
knew him to be a smart Stanford student,
but a question like this, so far out of the
comfort zone, seemed to throw him for a
loop.
Don't worry ... this is not another col
umn of borderline erotica. After a recent
controversial anonymous piece in The
Daily's Intermission section, I felt it was nec
essary to do justice to both brave survivors of
sexual assault and people who feel comfort
able enough to safely express their sexual
fantasies, no matter how out-there they may
seem.
Of course, I did not actually want to be
raped. So what do these desires signify? Am I
perverse for having these feelings? As an avid
supporter of sexual and emotional health on
campus and a member of SHPRC, how could I
enact my passions without being insensitive to
actual victims of rape and other sexual violence?
I had the privilege to interview Dr. Jenn
Berman, a renowned Los Angeles psychothera
pist and host of VHl's new show, "Couples
Therapy," where she does comprehensive
counseling with celebrity partners. Dr. Berman
also has a daily radio show known as "The
Love and Sex Show with Dr. Jenn," and has
been an expert psychotherapist on countless
shows from "The Oprah Winfrey Show" to
"The Today Show."

Intermission: What does it mean to have a
rape fantasy? Is there sometfiing wrong with

people who fantasize about rape?
Dr. Berman: It is very normal to have a
rape fantasy. There is a really big difference
between a rape fantasy and the actual experi
ence of being raped. There is nothing wrong
with a fantasy. In the fantasy you are in control
because it is your fantasy. It is the difference
between an exciting experience and a terrifying
reality.
You are the architect of your fantasy ... you
decide when your shirt gets ripped off, and
how far things go. This is the opposite of truly
being violated and raped.
INT: Just because someone fantasizes about
being dominated or "raped," does it mean they
want to actually be raped?
Dr. Berman: This is an important thing for
[people] to be clear on. It doesn't mean you
actually want to be raped. It is important to
understand that fantasies are different from
reality. [Rape] can be catastrophic in reality.
Even something like a threesome can be great
in fantasy, but bringing it into a relationsfiip
may be very different than how you imagined.
INT: What if someone is a survivor and still
fantasizes about rape?
Dr. Berman: Typically when someone who
is a survivor has a fantasy, it is about redoing
the experience where they are in control.
Sometimes it can be difficult for someone to
make sense of this kind of trauma. But it is
important to talk about it in therapy and with
someone who can offer you professional feed
back so you don't act out sometfiing that
might violate you again.
INT: How do I know I can trust my part
ner not to take a rape role-play too far?
Dr. Berman: It is important not to act out a
rape fantasy with a new partner, with someone
you don't know very well. It is important that
they have proved to you they are already trust
worthy over a course of time. It is important
that you have a safety word; [the safety word]
needs to be something you would never nor
mally say.

INT: Why are pieces like "Fifty Shades of
Grey" or the idea of domination so sexy or
arousing to many people, women in particular?
Dr. Berman: There are many aspects that
are appealing to women today. Women today
take on a lot ... we are more educated, more
career-oriented ... juggling more hats.
Sometimes the idea of not being in charge and
getting to be submissive can be very appealing.
It is about being desired, being validated ...
the idea of someone being so overcome with
lust for you (in the fantasy) can be very validat
ing. The reality of rape is about hurting some
one, not necessarily about sex.
INT: Do you think heterosexual men have
any fantasies of being raped?
Dr. Berman: The male fantasy is more about
being dominated than raped. It is not uncom
mon, especially for high-powered men, to have
fantasies about being dominated in bed, when

they are alpha males all day long at work
As Dr. Jenn noted, if you want your partner
to do something like sneak into your bedroom
wearing a burglar-type ski mask, it is key to
develop something like a safe word. I would
recommend something like "panda," unless
there is somehow a panda incorporated into
your intimate play. No judgments here, just
know that the panda in question may not
understand your human safe word.
Most importantly, in order to feel safe in
your fantasy, you need to trust that your
partner will respect your limits and
stop when you want him or her to.
Maybe you want to try out an
intense fantasy, but you don't feel
quite ready yet. It can be fun to
try a few stepping stone type I
activities to test your bound
aries, exercise your trust and prac-"
tice using your safe word. Perhaps
try a blindfold be creative and use
a tie, a scarf, your "Fear the Tree" shirt ... just
kidding (kind of).
Note: If you feel like you need someone to
talk to, please reach out to the Sexual Assault
& Relationship Abuse (SARA) office,
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Vaden, or the Bridge.
