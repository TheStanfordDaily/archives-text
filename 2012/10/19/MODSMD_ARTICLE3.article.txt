NO. 22 STANFORD (4-2, 2-1 PAC-12)
AT CALIFORNIA [3-4,2-2]

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 11, CAL 10: My predictions have been
remarkably similar to Stanford's record this season. I'm not
exactly sure what the correlation is, but I founded a startup to
look into the matter with some of my techie friends. In any
case, I feel confident that by picking one of the teams, I guar
antee myself a chance to win some of the time. In summation,
I have no idea what will happen on Saturday, because
Stanford has been the better team in each game it has played
this year and lost twice, both on the road. The Cardinal is bet
ter than Cal, but the Bears have momentum and Josh Nunes
still hasn't won a game away from Stanford Stadium. Look for
this one to go down to the wire in a defensive slugfest, with
Stanford scoring 11 points on three field goals and a safety for
the win.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 30, CAL 20: There's only one game I'm
picking Stanford to lose this year, and that's not until
November's trip up to Eugene, Ore., to face the mighty Ducks.
Stanford is a better football team than Cal, but I think Stanford
is a better football team than Notre Dame and I know Stanford
is a better football team than Washington. This game has me
scared. Cal will come out with everything it has, trying to
avenge a humiliating loss in 2010 and a shockingly close
defeat in 2011. Stanford must have this game out of reach in
the fourth quarter. If the Golden Bears can hang around in this
game and keep it at a one-score deficit in the fourth-quarter, I
honestly think Cal wins this game. Stanford hasn't shown me
that it can hold on to a tight lead on the road yet. Still, I have to
pick talent over nerves, so Stanford 30, Cal 20.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 27, CAL 20: While this is obviously the Big
Game for rivalry reasons, it's also a big game for postseason
implications. A win keeps Stanford in the running for the Pac
-12 North title and a Rose Bowl-bid; a loss would send those
hopes out the window. The hard-fought loss to Notre Dame
was tough on the players, but playing against Cal serves as
the best motivation possible for them to bounce back. As long
as the officials aren't bribed like they were in South Bend last
week, the Cardinal should come out on top and keep the Axe
for the third straight season.
