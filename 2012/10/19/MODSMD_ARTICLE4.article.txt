## CS dept. struggles to recruit women 
### SABELLE SMYTHE 
Computer science (CS) is Stanford's
most popular major, but not all students
flock to the department equally; women
make up only 20.9 percent of undergraduate
computer science majors, a disparity shared
by colleges across the nation.
While women's enrollment in CS at
Stanford has increased over the past two
years, department faculty believe the prob
lem has its roots long before most women
set foot on a college campus.

"The one thing I would say people seem
relatively conclusive about is that it starts
earlier than college," said Jennifer Widom,
professor and chair of the Computer
Science Department.
The gender disparity found in college
departments is also noticeable at the high
school level and below. This means that
fewer women enter college with an interest
in computer science, and those who do
often lack the experience of their male
counterparts.
"Women come in maybe with less back

ground in CS, because the problem is actu
ally earlier and so they get intimidated by
these men who come in having pro
grammed since they were in the third
grade," Widom said.
The challenge for the computer science
department is how to make CS accessible
to women once they get to college. In addi
tion to drawing women to the major, there
is often a struggle to keep them involved.
Entry-level courses such as CSIO6A exhib-
it near parity, but the drop-off is
steep. Women receive just 20.9
percent of bachelor's degrees
conferred in computer science,
13.7 percent of master's
degrees and 15.6 percent of
doctoral degrees.
This drop-off persists
despite rising demand for com
puter science degrees in the job
market.
"The number of computer
science majors that are being
produced these days is just far
below the demand from indus
try in terms of the number of
positions that are open," associ
ate professor of computer sci
ence Mehran Sahami, BS '92,
M.S. '93, Ph. D.'99, said.
Students and faculty believe
a negative stereotype of the CS
student works against women
considering the field.
"The image of CS ... is
something that's not very
attractive to women in particu
lar," CS major Sophia
Westwood 'l3 said. "So, for
example, if you look at 'The
Social Network' and you see a

guy who's not very socially
adept, kind of a loser, alone in
his room ... It's not really an
image that appeals to a lot of
guys certainly, but particularly
not to women."

However, Westwood does
n't buy into this image, and
feels that a CS degree has a lot
to offer women.

"One of the most impor
tant things is that that image
isn't true, that there's all sorts of
things you could do with a CS
major," she said.
In an effort to keep up with
developments in the field,
Stanford revised its curriculum
in the 2008-09 school year to
diversify what many perceived
as a monolithic course offering
by the department. Students
now have their choice of sever
al different tracks, with concen
trations ranging from graphics
to human-computer interac
tion.

Since 2009, the number of
women majoring in CS has
increased by 9.5 percent, which
Sahami said is a direct result of
the curriculum change.
One outreach effort organ
ized by students to promote
women in the field is a set of bi
quarterly dinners for women
interested or involved in com

puter science held by the cam
pus group She++. The dinners
give freshmen and sophomores
a chance to meet female upper
classmen in the department as
well as industry professionals.
"Women who find more
women to be with in computer
science, that makes a big differ
ence," Widom said. "Just the
fact that our major is expand
ing means that there are more
women involved in our major .
.. So just making sure these
women meet each other is a
useful thing."
One point, emphasized by
Westwood, is that most women
take introductory CS classes
after having declared their
major.
"If you ask people later,
'Do you wish that you had
taken this class earlier?' most
of them say 'Yes,'" Westwood
said.
For now, the rapidly
expanding department is keep
ing its hopes high. According to
Sahami, the goal is equal repre
sentation of genders in the
major.
"We'd like to get to parity,
50-50," he said.
