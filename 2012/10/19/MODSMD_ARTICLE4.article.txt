## CS dept. struggles to recruit women 
### SABELLE SMYTHE 
Computer science (CS) is Stanford's
most popular major, but not all students
flock to the department equally; women
make up only 20.9 percent of undergraduate
computer science majors, a disparity shared
by colleges across the nation.
While women's enrollment in CS at
Stanford has increased over the past two
years, department faculty believe the prob
lem has its roots long before most women
set foot on a college campus.

"The one thing I would say people seem
relatively conclusive about is that it starts
earlier than college," said Jennifer Widom,
professor and chair of the Computer
Science Department.
The gender disparity found in college
departments is also noticeable at the high
school level and below. This means that
fewer women enter college with an interest
in computer science, and those who do
often lack the experience of their male
counterparts.
"Women come in maybe with less back

ground in CS, because the problem is actu
ally earlier and so they get intimidated by
these men who come in having pro
grammed since they were in the third
grade," Widom said.
The challenge for the computer science
department is how to make CS accessible
to women once they get to college. In addi
tion to drawing women to the major, there
is often a struggle to keep them involved.
