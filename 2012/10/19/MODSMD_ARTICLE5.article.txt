## Delayed west gym to focus on outdoor ed. 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
The new West Campus recreation
center, slated to open in late 2013 or
early 2014, will focus on outdoor educa
tion and feature a new climbing wall as
well as an area to rent equipment for
outdoor activities such as camping,
backpacking, surfing and snow travel.
The University recently hired a new
director of outdoor education, Chris
Pelchat, to oversee these operations.
The Board of Trustees first
approved $35.5 million for the Arrillaga
Outdoor Education and Recreation
Center in December 2010. Permit
issues, however, stalled construction
until August 2011.
"The project has had a number of
challenges, but the key issue has been
schedule," wrote Mark Bonino, the pro
ject's manager, in an email to The Daily.
"The building permit for the project
took quite a bit longer than
anticipated, so the construction
site was dormant for almost a
year working through issues to
get that permit."
Bonino projected construc
tion to be completed by
December 2013, allowing for a
late 2013 or early 2014 open
ing. Tim Ghormley, director of
recreational sports facilities,
said that workers have finished
putting the main steel into
place and are currently pour
ing the concrete slab.
Aesthetically, the new
recreation center will resemble
the existing Arrillaga Center
for Sports and Recreation on
the east side of campus, but will
also have a 50-meter pool and
a stronger focus on outdoor
education.
"The outdoor education
component is going to be huge,
and I think the students and
the entire Stanford community
are going to be excited by
that," Ghormley said.
In accordance with the
focus on outdoor education,
the Department of Physical
Education, Recreation and
Wellness (DAPER) recently
hired Pelchat as its new director
of outdoor education. Pelchat,
who previously worked at
Ithaca College, will be involved
with overseeing all the
University's outdoor programs,
as well as the new recreation
center.

"One of the things that I
think is pretty unique in what
Stanford is doing is building this
outdoor education and recre-

ation center," Pelchat said. "I
think it will really put outdoor
education in the limelight."
Pelchat, who will assume
his new post on Oct. 29, noted
that many facets of education
are catered to outdoor pro
gramming, including collabora
tion, teambuilding and leader
ship training. He said he hopes
to use his background in lead
ership development and edu
cation to connect outdoor edu
cation to others parts of the
University, such as the
Graduate School of Business
and the School of Education.

"The center could actually
become a bridge for professors
and other programs on campus
that are looking to teach more
experientially to use our center,"
he said. "I'm excited to help
make outdoor education more
of an integral part of our stu
dents' experience at Stanford."
Estimates vary on the num
ber of people who will use the
new gym.
While the current recreation
center records more than
30,000 non-unique visits each
month, Ghornrley noted that it
is difficult to estimate whether
or not that number will be split
between the two facilities. He
predicted, however, that new
users would be drawn to the

gym because of its proximity to
their campus residence.

Senior associate athletic
director Eric Stein estimated
that the new facility will service
between 2,000 and 2,500 indi
viduals.

"At some point it may pull
some [users] away from the cur
rent facility, but we would antic
ipate that the overall total
would probably be up at least
50 to 70 percent in terms of peo
ple utilizing on-campus recre
ational facilities," Stein said.

The sports facilities depart
ment has not yet made official
decisions about the future of
the Tresidder Fitness Center,
which is also located on the
west side of campus.

"It's valuable to certain
users, and it may change in pur
pose and scope, but we don't
know yet," Ghormley said. The
only other athletic facility cur
rently on West Campus is
Roble Gym, which houses the
dance department.

New recreational and
aquatics staff will be hired
before the opening of the gym,
Ghormley said. There may be
job postings for positions as
early as the spring of 2013.

I think it will really put
outdoor education in
the limelight.
