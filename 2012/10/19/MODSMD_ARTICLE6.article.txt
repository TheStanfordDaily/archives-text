## Coursera at forefront of online education 
### ELISE JOHNSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The world is a very unfair place
today, where the circumstances you're
born in either give you or deny you the
opportunity to have a good life. But the
technology now exists to offer a high
quality education to everyone at a very
low cost."
Andrew Ng, associate professor of
computer science and co-founder of the
education technology company
Coursera, is a leader in the world of
online education. Working with fellow
professor Daphne Koller Ph.D. '93, Ng
established the company in April 2012.
Coursera has become the darling of the
online education movement, with over
1.5 million students worldwide enrolled
in at least one of 200 available courses.
In under a year, 33 of the world's top
universities have partnered with
Coursera to offer online classes from

their course catalogues to the public
for free. These massive online open
courses, known as "MOOCs," repre
sent a model of online learning new
to the world of higher education.
After graduating from Carnegie
Mellon University with a degree in
Computer Science and receiving his
doctorate from UC-Berkeley, Ng
accepted a position at Stanford in
2002. For many years, he conducted
research in machine learning and
artificial intelligence. He also began
teaching Stanford's main Machine
Learning course.
"Enrollment in my machine
learning quickly grew from the 35
students my first year," he said. "With
larger classes, I started to become
interested in automation and scaling.
I wanted to develop a technology that
would give everyone a good experi
ence."
Ng started the Stanford
Engineering Everywhere (SEE) pro
gram in 2008, which placed a number
of Stanford courses, including his
Machine Learning course, online for
free. His desire to create an online
platform for university courses
stemmed from both his strong beliefs
regarding the sharing of educational
resources as well as practical and

pragmatic concerns about large class
sizes and effective pedagogy.
"I would run into people around
Silicon Valley who had watched my
course online and I started to realize
what a huge impact online education
could have," Ng said. "If I had not
lived in Silicon Valley, I would not
have gotten such incredible feed
back."
Ng hosted his machine learning
class online in October 2011 and over
100,000 students registered for its
first iteration. The course, featuring
quizzes and graded programming
assignments, became one of the first
successful MOOCs and led to the
subsequent founding of Coursera.

sizes the potential of the platform to
revolutionize the way live, physical
classes are taught through the cre
ation of flipped classrooms. Ng is
more interested in the potential of
initiatives like Coursera to democra
tize educational content and provide
course resources to the masses.
"I have friends who are unem
ployed, scraping together a few hun
dred dollars to pay their tuition, so
I've seen a lot of this first-hand," Ng
said. "So if we can drive down the
cost, and give people like my friend
better, more affordable access to high
quality education, I think we can
change a lot of peoples' lives."
Ng rejects any claims that efforts
like his will undermine the value of a

prestigious degree.
"The value of attending Stanford
University is not the content," he
said. "Content is free on the web for
anyone. Rather, the real value is the
interaction with professors and
equally bright students."
Nonetheless, the opportunities
that efforts like Coursera are bring
ing to people outside of the walls of
the world's prestigious schools are
significant.
"We're seeing that it's possible for
students to take my class online and
become good enough to place highly
in machine learning competitions!"
Ng said, noting that several novice
programmers who signed up for Ng's
Machine Learning class on Coursera
have recently won predictive-model
ing competitions.
Ng recognizes that we are far
from achieving equality in education,
but he remains optimistic about the
future. With the spirit of an activist,
Ng outlined his poignant vision for
educational rights in the future.
"Once upon a time, there was no
right to own property. Once upon a
time, there was no right to vote. Once
upon a time, there was no right to
speech," Ng said. "These are all now
basic rights. Given the importance of
education, a high quality education
cannot be a privilege â€”it too must
be a right."
