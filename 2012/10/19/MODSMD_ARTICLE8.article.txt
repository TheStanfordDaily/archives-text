## VPUE study on unit workload flawed, imprecise 
### ELIZABETH CARLS 
A study of unit workload compar
isons commissioned by the Faculty
Senate showed a steady increase in the
average workload per unit across
majors since 2009. But two associate
vice provosts who helped conduct the
study were quick to stress the prelimi
nary status of the study, noting some of
the methods were "not very precise at
all" and based on "only very imperfect
tools."

The results of the study are unlikely
to surprise many current Stanford stu
dents. Presented at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting, the study
found that the value of a unit varies
greatly between departments.
Departments in the School of
Engineering reported the highest hours
of work per unit: both mechanical engi

neering and computer science reported
more than three hours of work per
unit, as compared to the 1.5 to 2.5 hours
averaged by other departments.
After concluding a two-year study
on undergraduate education last
January, the Faculty Senate decided to
investigate one area of student life that
was not covered in the report: the
undergraduate major. Faculty found,
however, that a discussion about
majors would be impossible without
establishing a firm concept of the unit
of credit.

As a result, the Office of the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) launched a study last year of
student workload per unit, using results
from course evaluations. VPUE drew
its data from nine different majors,
which were chosen to represent a vari
ety of academic disciplines.

In addition to the disparities
between majors, the study indicated that
workload per unit may be increasing
across the board. Since data collection
began in 2009, four of the nine majors
studied reported approximately 15 min
utes more being spent on coursework
per unit each year. Workload also
increased for the other five majors,
although less steadily.
No departments reported decreas
ing workloads.
Those involved with the study were
quick to note its preliminary nature
and the subsequent difficulty of draw
ing any concrete conclusions from the
data.

"One of our main findings was how
difficult it is to get reliable data," said
Martha Cyert, senior associate vice
provost of undergraduate education.
"This report is quite preliminary, and was

meant to inspire further conversations
about some of these issues rather than
provide definitive answers."
VPUE compiled the study using
data from the course evaluations stu
dents are asked to complete at the end
of every quarter. On these evaluations,
students report how much work they
spent on work outside of class in five
hour intervals. The study averaged each
interval response; for instance, a stu
dent who selected one to five hours
would be marked as having spent 2.5

hours on work outside of class. It also
focused on a few departments to repre
sent course workload across a variety
of fields.

According to Cvert, this method of
averaging is "not at all precise."
In addition, the evaluations do not
provide information about how many
units a student was enrolled in if a

course was offered in variable units.
This makes it impossible to know, for
example, if a student reported 10 hours
of work for a three-unit class or a five
unit class.
Another concern is the fact that
results are average values for all cours
es within a department. If a department
has one particularly large enrollment
course, for example, CSIO6A, respons
es from that one course may have
skewed the data for the entire depart
ment.

Variations amongst courses and
professors may have affected the data
as well.

While the data is rough, Shari Palmer,
associate vice provost of undergradu
ate education, said the study could indi
cate the "relative quantity of time"
spent on each unit in the representa
tive departments. Cyert agreed, stating
that the data "should be thought of
only as a benchmark," one that at most
offers "a very rough comparison
between courses."

The University has largely attrib
uted the higher number of hours spent
on coursework per unit in engineering
majors to accreditation requirements.
The engineering departments are
much more akin to professional schools
than other majors. Therefore, like med
ical schools and law schools, many engi
neering departments must be accredit
ed to award state-licensed engineering
degrees. The Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology requires
that strict standards in coursework be

met â€”for example, a year of math or a
full year of science. In addition, students
must take courses within their specific
field of interest.
As a result, units in higher-level
engineering courses are "devalued,"
according to Eric Roberts, professor of
computer science and Faculty Senate
veteran. Roberts said this was necessary
so students would be able to take all the
courses they need to graduate on time.
Fie also added that the data for engi
neering majors might be slightly
skewed.
"In problem set courses, there are
people who can easily take ten times as
long to complete the assignment,"
Roberts said. Those outliers raise the
overall hours of coursework per unit ratio.
This suggests that variations in the
value of a unit are inherent in the sys
tem. According to Palmer, it is
"never going to be possible nor
desirable for the university to
attempt to enforce a strict unit of cred

it." Roberts agreed, calling this varia
tion "a necessary feature of a system."
"1 don't think we should aspire to
having the same numbers of units for
each major or the same number of
hours of work per unit," Cyert said. "I
think we should aspire to offering the
best possible education we can both
within and outside of the majors."
Still, she added that part of offering
the best education possible is to under
stand what students are experiencing.
To that end, the University plans to
continue studying undergraduate edu
cation. There is talk of changing the
course evaluation to better assess how
much time students spend on a course
per week and the Senate's Committee
on Undergraduate Standards and
Policies (CUSP) will discuss this report
in November to decide how best to
proceed in light of the study's findings.

studied reported approximately 15 min
utes more being spent on coursework
per unit each year. Workload also
increased for the other five majors,
although less steadily.
No departments reported decreas
ing workloads.
Those involved with the study were
quick to note its preliminary nature
and the subsequent difficulty of draw
ing any concrete conclusions from the
data.

"One of our main findings was how
difficult it is to get reliable data," said
Martha Cyert, senior associate vice
provost of undergraduate education.
"This report is quite preliminary, and was

meant to inspire further conversations
about some of these issues rather than
provide definitive answers."
VPUE compiled the study using
data from the course evaluations stu
dents are asked to complete at the end
of every quarter. On these evaluations,
students report how much work they
spent on work outside of class in five
hour intervals. The study averaged each
interval response; for instance, a stu
dent who selected one to five hours
would be marked as having spent 2.5

hours on work outside of class. It also
focused on a few departments to repre
sent course workload across a variety
of fields.

According to Cvert, this method of
averaging is "not at all precise."
In addition, the evaluations do not
provide information about how many
units a student was enrolled in if a

course was offered in variable units.
This makes it impossible to know, for
example, if a student reported 10 hours
of work for a three-unit class or a five
unit class.
Another concern is the fact that
results are average values for all cours
es within a department. If a department
has one particularly large enrollment
course, for example, CSIO6A, respons
es from that one course may have
skewed the data for the entire depart
ment.

Variations amongst courses and
professors may have affected the data
as well.

While the data is rough, Shari Palmer,
associate vice provost of undergradu
ate education, said the study could indi
cate the "relative quantity of time"
spent on each unit in the representa
tive departments. Cyert agreed, stating
that the data "should be thought of
only as a benchmark," one that at most
offers "a very rough comparison
between courses."

The University has largely attrib
uted the higher number of hours spent
on coursework per unit in engineering
majors to accreditation requirements.
The engineering departments are
much more akin to professional schools
than other majors. Therefore, like med
ical schools and law schools, many engi
neering departments must be accredit
ed to award state-licensed engineering
degrees. The Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology requires
that strict standards in coursework be

met â€”for example, a year of math or a
full year of science. In addition, students
must take courses within their specific
field of interest.
As a result, units in higher-level
engineering courses are "devalued,"
according to Eric Roberts, professor of
computer science and Faculty Senate
veteran. Roberts said this was necessary
so students would be able to take all the
courses they need to graduate on time.
Fie also added that the data for engi
neering majors might be slightly
skewed.
"In problem set courses, there are
people who can easily take ten times as
long to complete the assignment,"
Roberts said. Those outliers raise the
overall hours of coursework per unit ratio.
This suggests that variations in the
value of a unit are inherent in the sys
tem. According to Palmer, it is
"never going to be possible nor
desirable for the university to
attempt to enforce a strict unit of cred

it." Roberts agreed, calling this varia
tion "a necessary feature of a system."
"1 don't think we should aspire to
having the same numbers of units for
each major or the same number of
hours of work per unit," Cyert said. "I
think we should aspire to offering the
best possible education we can both
within and outside of the majors."
Still, she added that part of offering
the best education possible is to under
stand what students are experiencing.
To that end, the University plans to
continue studying undergraduate edu
cation. There is talk of changing the
course evaluation to better assess how
much time students spend on a course
per week and the Senate's Committee
on Undergraduate Standards and
Policies (CUSP) will discuss this report
in November to decide how best to
proceed in light of the study's findings.

A study of unit workload compar
isons commissioned by the Faculty
Senate showed a steady increase in the
average workload per unit across
majors since 2009. But two associate
vice provosts who helped conduct the
study were quick to stress the prelimi
nary status of the study, noting some of
the methods were "not very precise at
all" and based on "only very imperfect
tools."

The results of the study are unlikely
to surprise many current Stanford stu
dents. Presented at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting, the study
found that the value of a unit varies
greatly between departments.
Departments in the School of
Engineering reported the highest hours
of work per unit: both mechanical engi

neering and computer science reported
more than three hours of work per
unit, as compared to the 1.5 to 2.5 hours
averaged by other departments.
After concluding a two-year study
on undergraduate education last
January, the Faculty Senate decided to
investigate one area of student life that
was not covered in the report: the
undergraduate major. Faculty found,
however, that a discussion about
majors would be impossible without
establishing a firm concept of the unit
of credit.

As a result, the Office of the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) launched a study last year of
student workload per unit, using results
from course evaluations. VPUE drew
its data from nine different majors,
which were chosen to represent a vari
ety of academic disciplines.

In addition to the disparities
between majors, the study indicated that
workload per unit may be increasing
across the board. Since data collection
began in 2009, four of the nine majors
studied reported approximately 15 min
utes more being spent on coursework
per unit each year. Workload also
increased for the other five majors,
although less steadily.
