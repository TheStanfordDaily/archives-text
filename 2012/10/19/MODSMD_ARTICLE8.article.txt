## VPUE study on unit workload flawed, imprecise 
### ELIZABETH CARLS 
A study of unit workload compar
isons commissioned by the Faculty
Senate showed a steady increase in the
average workload per unit across
majors since 2009. But two associate
vice provosts who helped conduct the
study were quick to stress the prelimi
nary status of the study, noting some of
the methods were "not very precise at
all" and based on "only very imperfect
tools."

The results of the study are unlikely
to surprise many current Stanford stu
dents. Presented at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting, the study
found that the value of a unit varies
greatly between departments.
Departments in the School of
Engineering reported the highest hours
of work per unit: both mechanical engi

neering and computer science reported
more than three hours of work per
unit, as compared to the 1.5 to 2.5 hours
averaged by other departments.
After concluding a two-year study
on undergraduate education last
January, the Faculty Senate decided to
investigate one area of student life that
was not covered in the report: the
undergraduate major. Faculty found,
however, that a discussion about
majors would be impossible without
establishing a firm concept of the unit
of credit.

As a result, the Office of the Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) launched a study last year of
student workload per unit, using results
from course evaluations. VPUE drew
its data from nine different majors,
which were chosen to represent a vari
ety of academic disciplines.

In addition to the disparities
between majors, the study indicated that
workload per unit may be increasing
across the board. Since data collection
began in 2009, four of the nine majors
studied reported approximately 15 min
utes more being spent on coursework
per unit each year. Workload also
increased for the other five majors,
although less steadily.
No departments reported decreas
ing workloads.
Those involved with the study were
quick to note its preliminary nature
and the subsequent difficulty of draw
ing any concrete conclusions from the
data.

"One of our main findings was how
difficult it is to get reliable data," said
Martha Cyert, senior associate vice
provost of undergraduate education.
"This report is quite preliminary, and was

meant to inspire further conversations
about some of these issues rather than
provide definitive answers."
VPUE compiled the study using
data from the course evaluations stu
dents are asked to complete at the end
of every quarter. On these evaluations,
students report how much work they
spent on work outside of class in five
hour intervals. The study averaged each
interval response; for instance, a stu
dent who selected one to five hours
would be marked as having spent 2.5

hours on work outside of class. It also
focused on a few departments to repre
sent course workload across a variety
of fields.

According to Cvert, this method of
averaging is "not at all precise."
In addition, the evaluations do not
provide information about how many
units a student was enrolled in if a

course was offered in variable units.
This makes it impossible to know, for
example, if a student reported 10 hours
of work for a three-unit class or a five
unit class.
Another concern is the fact that
results are average values for all cours
es within a department. If a department
has one particularly large enrollment
course, for example, CSIO6A, respons
es from that one course may have
skewed the data for the entire depart
ment.

Variations amongst courses and
professors may have affected the data
as well.

While the data is rough, Shari Palmer,
associate vice provost of undergradu
ate education, said the study could indi
cate the "relative quantity of time"
