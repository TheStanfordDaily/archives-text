Application numbers for the first round of
the spring Bing Overseas Study Program
(BOSP) this year were the highest in the past
five years, increasing to 391 applicants from
last year's 289.
The Berlin program received the most
applications, 96, almost doubling last year's
54. Only the Beijing program saw a decrease
from last year's 29 to 15.
The Madrid program, which has historical
ly seen high application numbers, instituted a
new language requirement this year, raising
the Spanish language proficiency require
ment from one year to two years of study or
equal skill. The change aimed to reduce the
number of applications, said Santiago

Tejerina-Canal, director of the Madrid pro
gram.

"For me it was hard to say no to so many
incredible students," Tejerina-Canal said.
This spring the Madrid applications
matched those from last year, 33, but Director
of BOSP Ramon Saldivar and Tejerina-Canal
said that numbers were down across all three
quarters.

In response to the overall Madrid per
formance this year, Tejerina-Canal said the
language requirement would go back down to
encourage as many students as possible to
participate in the program.
"We were realizing that those students
who came to Madrid with a high level of lan
guage proficiency just seemed to get a lot
more out of it," Saldivar said. "I'm not sorry
that we made the change,"
Along with the rise in spring applications,
BOSP saw another shift this year with an
increase in applications to the fall Moscow
program.
According to Saldivar, Moscow applica

tions have been historically low, fluctuating
year to year from the mid-teens to mid-twen
ties. There were 18 applications this year.
Sam Rebo 'l5, who plans to study abroad
in Moscow next year, said that low numbers
have to do with the uniqueness of the pro
gram's location.
"I think people like to go to Paris, Oxford,
Berlin because ... it's more what we're used
to, it's Western Europe and it's not far
removed from America," Rebo said. "Eastern
Europe is a completely different place."
The Moscow program has employed a
variety of measures to boost enrollment. For
example, there is no language requirement;
instead, students go through a three-week
intensive Russian language course,
"I'm amazed that it works," said Gabriella
Safran, professor of Slavic studies. "I've been
persuaded because I've seen a lot of students
go through the program and I've seen the
tremendous work that the whole staff in
