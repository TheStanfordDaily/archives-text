## Hijabis at Stanford: 'We are all individuals' 
### CHIARA BARAVELLE 
In a quiet enclave of Old Union an hour before
the vigil ceremony for Malala Yusufcai, a 14-year-old
Pakistani activist and Taliban gun victim, Nausheen
Mahmood 'l4 spoke emphatically about her jour
ney with her hijab.
"The hijab is liberating in that people take you
seriously and listen to what you have to say," said
Mahmood, the vice president of the Islamic Society
of Stanford University (ISSU).
The hijab is a traditional veil that covers the hair
and neck and is worn by some Muslim women.
According to Vice President of the Muslim
Students Awareness Network (MSAN) Hana Al-
Henaid 'l4, the conversation surrounding the hijab
is not just about the hijab, but rather about the per
son who is or isn't wearing it.
Al-Henaid and Mahmood both wear the hijab
on campus out of personal choice. For these women,
bom and raised in California, the hijab means dress
ing and behaving modestly. It sets boundaries to
enable decorum in social interactions.
Al-Henaid first puts her hijab on before she

leaves for class and only takes it off again in the pri
vacy of her room. However, before coming to
Stanford, she had to modify her routine. For
instance, she wears long sleeves, pants and a scarf to
the gym, since the facilities are not all-female.
Mahmood remembers having to cover herself
from head to toe in physical education class during
middle school in Cupertino, Calif. Initially,
Mahmood often became frustrated when she had to
wear layers of T-shirts and sweatpants. However, she
grew accustomed to the heat by constantly remind
ing herself of the commitment she had made in
fourth grade.
"I actually came to the nice realization that heat
is something I need to deal with, and I need to
remember the bigger picture of why I am doing this,"
Mahmood said.
"It takes off a layer of superficiality. More per
sonally, it's my daily connection to God," she added.
According to Al-Henaid, there is no simple
answer to what a hijab is. In fact, Mahmood explains
that the more conversations she has with other
hijabis from all walks of life on campus, the more she
learns about the garment.
"At Stanford there are multiple opinions on the
matter," Al-Henaid said. "It comes along with being
in a new place away from your family and getting to
question your values independently."
During her freshman year, Al-Henaid was the
only hijabi to take part in the "Hijabi Monologues,"
a Stanford Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP) production in conjunction with MSAN.
