## Hijabis at Stanford: 'We are all individuals' 
### CHIARA BARAVELLE 
In a quiet enclave of Old Union an hour before
the vigil ceremony for Malala Yusufcai, a 14-year-old
Pakistani activist and Taliban gun victim, Nausheen
Mahmood 'l4 spoke emphatically about her jour
ney with her hijab.
"The hijab is liberating in that people take you
seriously and listen to what you have to say," said
Mahmood, the vice president of the Islamic Society
of Stanford University (ISSU).
The hijab is a traditional veil that covers the hair
and neck and is worn by some Muslim women.
According to Vice President of the Muslim
Students Awareness Network (MSAN) Hana Al-
Henaid 'l4, the conversation surrounding the hijab
is not just about the hijab, but rather about the per
son who is or isn't wearing it.
Al-Henaid and Mahmood both wear the hijab
on campus out of personal choice. For these women,
bom and raised in California, the hijab means dress
ing and behaving modestly. It sets boundaries to
enable decorum in social interactions.
Al-Henaid first puts her hijab on before she

leaves for class and only takes it off again in the pri
vacy of her room. However, before coming to
Stanford, she had to modify her routine. For
instance, she wears long sleeves, pants and a scarf to
the gym, since the facilities are not all-female.
Mahmood remembers having to cover herself
from head to toe in physical education class during
middle school in Cupertino, Calif. Initially,
Mahmood often became frustrated when she had to
wear layers of T-shirts and sweatpants. However, she
grew accustomed to the heat by constantly remind
ing herself of the commitment she had made in
fourth grade.
"I actually came to the nice realization that heat
is something I need to deal with, and I need to
remember the bigger picture of why I am doing this,"
Mahmood said.
"It takes off a layer of superficiality. More per
sonally, it's my daily connection to God," she added.
According to Al-Henaid, there is no simple
answer to what a hijab is. In fact, Mahmood explains
that the more conversations she has with other
hijabis from all walks of life on campus, the more she
learns about the garment.
"At Stanford there are multiple opinions on the
matter," Al-Henaid said. "It comes along with being
in a new place away from your family and getting to
question your values independently."
During her freshman year, Al-Henaid was the
only hijabi to take part in the "Hijabi Monologues,"
a Stanford Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP) production in conjunction with MSAN.
Written by Sahar Ullah, the monologues showcased
episodes in the lives of hijabis at
Stanford. Despite never having acted
before, Al-Henaid explains that she was
drawn to the "very human role" in the
monologue about the writer's own expe
rience.

"I was just coming from high school,
so all my memories were very fresh," Al-
Henaid said. "The monologue described
the writer's high school experience of
male friends acting as her 'hijabi protec
tors.' Ironically, in my freshman dorm, all
the girls also ended up playing the part of
my protectors."
However, college is not the first time
that these two hijabis have had to answer
questions about publicly portraying their
faith. Al-Henaid was already used to
these countless questions before college.
"Some people may view the hijab as
a license for subordination, but that con
nection is completely flawed,"
Mahmood said. "Hijabi women are
completely breaking that norm here,
achieving great things but keeping in line
to what they committed to."
According to Mahmood, the general
consensus is that Stanford assures hijabis
a comfortable feeling of acceptance for
which they are grateful. Al-Henaid
admits to often asking herself how her
attitude towards the hijab would differ if
she lived in a country that mandated it
like Iran. However, Mahmood differen
tiates between tolerance and under
standing.
"Everyone comes with their own
preconceptions about the hijab, which is
why MSAN has organized events... to
provide the Stanford community with a
forum in which they can hear voices
from a spectrum of Muslim women at
Stanford and their individual views on
hijab" said Mahta Baghoolizadeh 'l3,
president of MSAN.
"We don't fully understand the
devotion associated with wearing the
hijab," said
Ramzi Salti, lecturer in Arabic language
and literature.

Yet while some may suffer from a
lack of awareness, discrimination as
experienced outside of Stanford is large
ly unheard of on campus.
According to Salti, hijabi women
have been accosted and followed on
public buses in Palo Alto. Before arriving
at Stanford, even Mahmood and Al-
Henaid experienced slurs such as
"towel-head," "terrorist," and "Osama."
"These stereotypes are created out
side campus. Stanford is not immune,"
Mahmood said.
For this, Salti blames the lack of
Muslim representation in the media,
which he argues tends to "demonize
Islam." Salti points to other symbolic
religious garments, like the Jewish kip
pah or the Christian cross, that have not
attracted similar levels of public outcry.
"After 9/11,1 had seen stuff about
Islam on TV and I knew that wasn't
what we were about," Mahmood said. "I
thought that if I wore the hijab people
would be able to associate my religion
with me, rather than what they saw on
TV."
According to Salti, the headscarf has
now become emblematic of a Muslim
identity that was increasingly challenged
after 9/11.
"When I was 14, it was away of life,"
Al-Henaid said. "But now it's turned
into me representing someone who is
more than myself into representing my
religion even though I can't speak for a
billion people. It's both burdensome and
empowering."
For Al-Henaid and Mahmood, the
dialogue surrounding the hijab within
the Muslim community at Stanford is
laden with socioeconomic, geographic
and gender diversity. However, organiza
tions such as MSAN and ISSU seek to
thrust that conversation into a larger
space through which everyone can par
ticipate.
"The hijab is not something to be
afraid oÂ£ and it's not something to be
hateful towards," Mahmood said. "We
all have different religions, we all wear
different things and we all have different
names, but we are all individuals"
