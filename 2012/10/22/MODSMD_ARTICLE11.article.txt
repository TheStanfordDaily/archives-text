## THE 						TOP FIVE CULT TV SHOWS 
### 
So it's week five!
Don't act like that means you have no
time for TV we know it means you have
specially designated time to procrastinate
by throwing yourselves on the shores of a new
show, preferably cult, hopefully online and definite
ly worthy of hours of your attention. The cultural
significance and political gravity of "The Wire" is
no trivial pursuit! And it might even be research if
you're in Ebon we mean African American
Vernacular English. For those late-night paper jams
and early morning flash-card reviews, we present to
you the top five TV shows worthy of their cult fol
io wings.
■"COMMUNITY"
Following a study group of odd but endearing
characters at a ridiculous community college,
"Community" is one of the tube's best travelers. It's
weird, yes, and its penchant for the self-referential
means those who have watched every episode
upwards of five times probably get the most enjoy
ment.
■"THE LEAGUE"
It's on Netflix, and I know you have access to your
friend's mom's account, so you should watch "The
League" immediately. The show revolves around six
mid-30-somethings, some married with kids, in a

fantasy football league and the shenanigans they
get themselves into to win the Shiva, their self-con
structed trophy. Also, the episodes and seasons are
short and sweet, so it's a good short-term obses
sion. Or a justifiable full-day marathon.
■"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"
Also on Netflix. No excuses people this one
you've known about for a while and keep meaning
to watch but don't. Now's the time, because new
episodes are finally coming out, and you're going
to feel left out when everyone is "cu-ca-cu-ca
cu"ing around you and talking about Gob's illu
sions (rather than the bar Illusions). Watch it now
or you will have made a huge mistake. And every
one will laugh about the references. And you won't
know why. There's always money in the banana
stand!
■"PARTY DOWN"
People look back and wonder why Howard Hawks
wasn't more famous in his time. The same will be
thought of "Party Down." But not you you will
be saying, "I told you so, you mangy kids!" "Party
Down" stars Intermission favorites like Adam Scott
from "Parks and Rec," Lizy Caplan aka Janice lan
from "Mean Girls," the beard guy from "Knocked
Up" and Jane Lynch. They play aspiring actors who
work as caterers for odd events usually involving
celebrities like Steve Guttenberg or George Takei,
and they are glorious.
■"THE WIRE"
The others are comedies; this is for real. "The Wire"
is five seasons of genius social commentary. If not
for your own personal edification and delight,
watch this so you'll have something to talk to the J.
Crew salesman about. Yeah, J. Crew salesmen are
up on "The Wire" that's how far-reaching its
grasp on white America is. "The Wire" follows the
effects of Baltimore's drug trade on different realms
such as schools, neighborhoods and local govern
ment, and it will change your life.
