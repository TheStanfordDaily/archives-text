# Big Ride Rivalry Done Right
## 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
On a campus
where taste and
dignity are con-
I fined to closed-door
fundraisers and alumni
mixers (we like to imagine),
the Stanford Equestrian Team
continued its reign as the most
v dignified host of refinery with its
first Big Ride. A more civil nod to
the Big Game (Go Card! Or whatever),
the Big Ride marries the Stanford team and
that of those Bears across the Bay, if only for a
day of fundraising and good sport.

Don't expect hot dogs or foam fingers at
this sporting event, though. Students of a more
manicured affectation delighted in a showing
of horses at Stanford's hidden gem the Red
Barn, tucked cozily between fairways and ten
nis courts. Prepared bites and Hermes acces
sories decorated the main arena's flanks, as vis
itors donated to their team of choice. The
low-key afternoon replaced the Red Barn
Festival, the team's all-out soiree of fundraising
and equestrian spectacle, for the fall at least.
So is it the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic of
Stanford? Not quite, but it'll keep our glasses full
until we don brimmed hats for Derby Days.
