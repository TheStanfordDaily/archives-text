## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN China complex 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Thus speaks menacing mob boss
Abe (Jeff Daniels) in the recent
hit film "Looper" to Joe
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an assassin
sent to kill his older self (Bruce Willis)
by the black-coated, time-traveling
mob. As the America of 2042 crum
bles into a dystopian wreck populated
solely by the homeless and trigger
happy, Young Joe cheerfully kills him
self and then merrily sets off to
Shanghai for a future he knows will
end in death at his own hand.

Few things capture the spirit of a
nation more keenly than the future it
sees itself living. Apparently we don't
think much of ours.

Empty political rhetoric about
American exceptionalism aside, pub
lic discourse in this country has
become increasingly populated by a
vision of the future in which a deca
dent and weak-willed America falls
under the economic dominance of a
rising China.

In June of this year, China sur
passed the United States for the first
time in the eyes of the global public as
the world's number one economic
power. Gallup found that Americans
share that opinion, with 53 percent of
Americans viewing China as the
country most likely to dominate the
future world economy (up from just
16 percent in 2000).

Writing in The New York Times,
venture capitalist Eric X. Li seized on
these widespread fears of inevitable
decline, declaring bluntly that
"China's political model is superior."
America's future, Li wrote, will be
marked by "endless referendums,
paralysis and insolvency." The only
way to fend off disaster, he concluded,
was to become more like China an
unlikely possibility, since America
"seems incapable of becoming less
democratic even when its survival
may depend on such a shift."
The creeping pessimism has even
snuck its way into that most quintes
sentially American of institutions: pro
fessional football. Two years ago,
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell
went off on a memorable radio rant
when the NFL postponed a Sunday
night game between the Minnesota
Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles due
to blizzard forecasts.

"We've become a nation of wuss
es!" yelled an infuriated Rendell. "The
Chinese are kicking our butt in every
thing. If this was in China do you think
the Chinese would have called off the
game? People would have been
marching down to the stadium, they
would have walked and they would
have been doing calculus on the way
down."

That pretty much sums it up: The
country is about to be overrun, a la the
upcoming Chris Hemsworth block
buster "Red Dawn," by untold legions
of goose-stepping China-bots.

There's only one problem: We've
heard this all before.

First it was Nazi Germany, 1936,
destined to rule the world as America
fell to pieces. Writing in June 1941,
essayist E.B. White spoke discourag
ingly of the everyday New Yorkers
who had lost faith in the fundamental
precepts of American democracy. One
man, fascinated by the clean young
faces of the German soldiers in the
newsreels, told him calmly that fas
cism was the future. "Another man,"
wrote White, "informed me that our
democratic form of government was
decadent and not worth bothering
about." Not a single man maintained
faith in the American way. Instead,
wrote White, "I found paralysis, or a
sort of dim acquiescence, as in a child
who is duly swallowing a distasteful
pill."

Then it was the Soviets whose
model was inherently superior, at least
until 1989; and then Japan, with its
brilliant industrial policy, at least until
its lost decade; and now it is China.
Hie fact is, we do need reform, and
fast. As Thomas Friedman and many
others have written, we are spending,
among other things, too much on con
sumption (or, in one critic's terms,
"warfare and welfare") and not
enough on research and investment.
We are failing to negotiate the clean
energy challenge. And structural defi
ciencies plague our public commit
ments to the poor and weak
(Medicare and Social Security fore
most among them).

In 1967, French intellectual Jean-
Jacques Servan-Schreiber penned The
American Challenge, a critique of
European economic attitudes and
policies in the face of a seemingly
indomitable American industrial jug
gernaut. Unless Europe reformed and
reformed quickly, Servan-Schreiber
urged, the Continent would fall irre
trievably behind in the race for eco
nomic and political prominence.

We need another statement like
Servan-Schreiber's: one that recog
nizes the problems America faces and
the advantages China and other rising
economies have acquired, but
nonetheless maintains that reform
and progress are possible within the
framework of our nation's political
and economic traditions. Empty com
plaints and defeatism have never got
ten us anywhere, and they won't do
much now.

went off on a memorable radio rant
when the NFL postponed a Sunday
night game between the Minnesota
Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles due
to blizzard forecasts.

"We've become a nation of wuss
es!" yelled an infuriated Rendell. "The
Chinese are kicking our butt in every
thing. If this was in China do you think
the Chinese would have called off the
game? People would have been
marching down to the stadium, they
would have walked and they would
have been doing calculus on the way
down."

That pretty much sums it up: The
country is about to be overrun, a la the
upcoming Chris Hemsworth block
buster "Red Dawn," by untold legions
of goose-stepping China-bots.

There's only one problem: We've
heard this all before.

First it was Nazi Germany, 1936,
destined to rule the world as America
fell to pieces. Writing in June 1941,
essayist E.B. White spoke discourag
ingly of the everyday New Yorkers
who had lost faith in the fundamental
precepts of American democracy. One
man, fascinated by the clean young
faces of the German soldiers in the
newsreels, told him calmly that fas
cism was the future. "Another man,"
wrote White, "informed me that our
democratic form of government was
decadent and not worth bothering
about." Not a single man maintained
faith in the American way. Instead,
wrote White, "I found paralysis, or a
sort of dim acquiescence, as in a child
who is duly swallowing a distasteful
pill."

Then it was the Soviets whose
model was inherently superior, at least
until 1989; and then Japan, with its
brilliant industrial policy, at least until
its lost decade; and now it is China.
Hie fact is, we do need reform, and
fast. As Thomas Friedman and many
others have written, we are spending,
among other things, too much on con
sumption (or, in one critic's terms,
"warfare and welfare") and not
enough on research and investment.
We are failing to negotiate the clean
energy challenge. And structural defi
ciencies plague our public commit
ments to the poor and weak
(Medicare and Social Security fore
most among them).

In 1967, French intellectual Jean-
Jacques Servan-Schreiber penned The
American Challenge, a critique of
European economic attitudes and
policies in the face of a seemingly
indomitable American industrial jug
gernaut. Unless Europe reformed and
reformed quickly, Servan-Schreiber
urged, the Continent would fall irre
trievably behind in the race for eco
nomic and political prominence.

We need another statement like
Servan-Schreiber's: one that recog
nizes the problems America faces and
the advantages China and other rising
economies have acquired, but
nonetheless maintains that reform
and progress are possible within the
framework of our nation's political
and economic traditions. Empty com
plaints and defeatism have never got
ten us anywhere, and they won't do
much now.

Thus speaks menacing mob boss
Abe (Jeff Daniels) in the recent
hit film "Looper" to Joe
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an assassin
sent to kill his older self (Bruce Willis)
by the black-coated, time-traveling
mob. As the America of 2042 crum
bles into a dystopian wreck populated
solely by the homeless and trigger
happy, Young Joe cheerfully kills him
self and then merrily sets off to
Shanghai for a future he knows will
end in death at his own hand.

Few things capture the spirit of a
nation more keenly than the future it
sees itself living. Apparently we don't
think much of ours.

Empty political rhetoric about
American exceptionalism aside, pub
lic discourse in this country has
become increasingly populated by a
vision of the future in which a deca
dent and weak-willed America falls
under the economic dominance of a
rising China.

In June of this year, China sur
passed the United States for the first
time in the eyes of the global public as
the world's number one economic
power. Gallup found that Americans
share that opinion, with 53 percent of
Americans viewing China as the
country most likely to dominate the
future world economy (up from just
16 percent in 2000).

Writing in The New York Times,
venture capitalist Eric X. Li seized on
these widespread fears of inevitable
decline, declaring bluntly that
"China's political model is superior."
America's future, Li wrote, will be
marked by "endless referendums,
paralysis and insolvency." The only
way to fend off disaster, he concluded,
was to become more like China an
unlikely possibility, since America
"seems incapable of becoming less
democratic even when its survival
may depend on such a shift."
The creeping pessimism has even
snuck its way into that most quintes
sentially American of institutions: pro
fessional football. Two years ago,
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell
went off on a memorable radio rant
