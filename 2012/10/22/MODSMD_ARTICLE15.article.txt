# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
## When poor sportsmanship threatens a great rivalry 
### 
r I ihis past Saturday, The Stanford Daily and
I The Daily Californian, the independent stu
-L. dent newspapers of Stanford and UC-
Berkeley, played each other in a flag football game
called "The Ink BowE'The Daily Cal prevailed 21-
7, reclaiming "The Knife," a trophy that the two
papers have traded back and forth for well over a
decade.
Earlier in the week, a Daily alum shared stories
with me of his battles in the 1990 Ink Bowl, making
the game older than most of The Daily's staff. The
friendly rivalry has an incredible history that ties
together two great college papers across genera
tions.
After the game, some of our editors ate break
fast together and learned about each other's organ
izations. This is how rivalries are meant to be.
Predicated on mutual respect, they should be
friendly competitions that, at the end of the day, are
less important than the opportunities we have to
collaborate and better serve our readers
Unfortunately, the event was marred by poor
sportsmanship by a small contingent of The Daily
Cal's staff) and the offenses make me worry about
the state of this rivalry.
Last night, after losing the 115 th Big Game, Alex
Wolinsky posted a mean-spirited story titled "No
Competition" on The Daily Cal's copy blog, taking
shots at The Stanford Daily's copy editors I'm all for
good-natured ribbing, but this post, which The Daily
Cal tweeted twice on Sunday, crossed a line both pro
fessionally and, in my opinion, personally.
It featured a picture of The Daily covered in red
ink and three bullet points of "highlights" of The
Daily's copy errors. The Daily Cal has never shown
us the red-ink-covered Daily. Rather than giving us
the opportunity to learn from our mistakes (which
we can't verify as we've never seen the marked-up
paper), they chose to publicly mock them, though
one of the Ihree "highlight" errors was an intention
al joke by The Daily staff
The piece is simply wrong. As the editor in chief,
I am responsible for every word in the newspaper.
Yet the piece doesn't mention me. It doesn't go after
the heads of the paper, executive editor Brendan
O'Byrne and me, the people responsible for the

paper's content.
Rather, it mocks our talented copy editors,
whom I unfairly asked to copy edit six large news
papers during Stanford's midterms week. These are
not harmless words in jest. Any professional media
organization would be lucky to have Charlotte,
Matt, Jamie, Maddy or Neel as copy editors for sum
mer internships or after graduation. And this Daily
Cal piece is the fifth result on Google for search
results like "Stanford Daily copy editor." I remain
unreservedly proud of their hard, professional
work, and I am shocked that any person would find
joy in mocking or attempting to shame them.
This post was a low point in a storied history,
making a fantastic Cal newspaper appear small and
petty. But this was not the worst sportsmanship
shown this weekend.
Toward the end of the flag football game on
Saturday, our sports editor was hit hard in the head
and was down on the ground for a few minutes. He
limped slowly off the field and may have been con
cussed.
Most of The Daily Cal's staff showed concern,
offering to help in any way they could.
Unfortunately, someone took the opportunity to
take a picture of our editor while he lay on the
ground injured.
On Sunday evening. Daily Cal alum Gerald
Nicdao tweeted the picture of our sports editor,
clearly injured, with the caption, "@MikeSilver this
is what happens when you mess with the Daily Cal
(DC over Stanford Daily 21-7) #lnkßowl
#Goßears." Silver is a Cal alum and NFL writer for
Yahoo! Sports. Silver retweeted the picture to over
54,000 followers and replied, "represent (hope that
guy wasn't really hurt)."
He was lying on the ground. You're a sports
journalist, Mike surely you know a player lying
on the ground is never good news.
We must be better than this.
As independent student newspapers, we serve a
vital role in our communities. Many of us will go on
to be professional journalists, hopefully working
together in newsrooms. I'm all for the spirit of com
petition, but only when both sides respect each
other.
I hope that our long history of working togeth
er can take precedence over pettiness in what
should be a friendly rivalry.

called "The Ink BowE'The Daily Cal prevailed 21-
7, reclaiming "The Knife," a trophy that the two
papers have traded back and forth for well over a
decade.
Earlier in the week, a Daily alum shared stories
with me of his battles in the 1990 Ink Bowl, making
the game older than most of The Daily's staff. The
friendly rivalry has an incredible history that ties
together two great college papers across genera
tions.
After the game, some of our editors ate break
fast together and learned about each other's organ
izations. This is how rivalries are meant to be.
Predicated on mutual respect, they should be
friendly competitions that, at the end of the day, are
less important than the opportunities we have to
collaborate and better serve our readers
Unfortunately, the event was marred by poor
sportsmanship by a small contingent of The Daily
Cal's staff) and the offenses make me worry about
the state of this rivalry.
Last night, after losing the 115 th Big Game, Alex
Wolinsky posted a mean-spirited story titled "No
Competition" on The Daily Cal's copy blog, taking
shots at The Stanford Daily's copy editors I'm all for
good-natured ribbing, but this post, which The Daily
Cal tweeted twice on Sunday, crossed a line both pro
fessionally and, in my opinion, personally.
It featured a picture of The Daily covered in red
ink and three bullet points of "highlights" of The
Daily's copy errors. The Daily Cal has never shown
us the red-ink-covered Daily. Rather than giving us
the opportunity to learn from our mistakes (which
we can't verify as we've never seen the marked-up
paper), they chose to publicly mock them, though
one of the Ihree "highlight" errors was an intention
al joke by The Daily staff
The piece is simply wrong. As the editor in chief,
I am responsible for every word in the newspaper.
Yet the piece doesn't mention me. It doesn't go after
the heads of the paper, executive editor Brendan
O'Byrne and me, the people responsible for the

paper's content.
Rather, it mocks our talented copy editors,
whom I unfairly asked to copy edit six large news
papers during Stanford's midterms week. These are
not harmless words in jest. Any professional media
organization would be lucky to have Charlotte,
Matt, Jamie, Maddy or Neel as copy editors for sum
mer internships or after graduation. And this Daily
Cal piece is the fifth result on Google for search
results like "Stanford Daily copy editor." I remain
unreservedly proud of their hard, professional
work, and I am shocked that any person would find
joy in mocking or attempting to shame them.
This post was a low point in a storied history,
making a fantastic Cal newspaper appear small and
petty. But this was not the worst sportsmanship
shown this weekend.
Toward the end of the flag football game on
Saturday, our sports editor was hit hard in the head
and was down on the ground for a few minutes. He
limped slowly off the field and may have been con
cussed.
Most of The Daily Cal's staff showed concern,
offering to help in any way they could.
Unfortunately, someone took the opportunity to
take a picture of our editor while he lay on the
ground injured.
On Sunday evening. Daily Cal alum Gerald
Nicdao tweeted the picture of our sports editor,
clearly injured, with the caption, "@MikeSilver this
is what happens when you mess with the Daily Cal
(DC over Stanford Daily 21-7) #lnkßowl
#Goßears." Silver is a Cal alum and NFL writer for
Yahoo! Sports. Silver retweeted the picture to over
54,000 followers and replied, "represent (hope that
guy wasn't really hurt)."
He was lying on the ground. You're a sports
journalist, Mike surely you know a player lying
on the ground is never good news.
We must be better than this.
As independent student newspapers, we serve a
vital role in our communities. Many of us will go on
to be professional journalists, hopefully working
together in newsrooms. I'm all for the spirit of com
petition, but only when both sides respect each
other.
I hope that our long history of working togeth
er can take precedence over pettiness in what
should be a friendly rivalry.
Best,
