W_/the author of this piece should
be free to share her experience with the
community, that experience should not
be presented as a scintillating 'sex diary.'
The story is not sparking a 'dialogue' in a
vacuum, but rather in an unsafe culture
where, as the comments have proven, it
is commonly assumed that victims desire
their own abuse. The decision to publish
this account as a 'sex column' further
eroticizes violence against women in a
school already pervaded by it. As some
one who has not felt safe on this campus
since her own sexual assault, I am
unnerved and disgusted by the irrespon
sibility of the decision to publish this
piece."
Such were the words of "Frozen,"
who says she is a Stanford student who
was sexually assaulted on campus, in
response to a "sex diary" The Daily
printed two weeks ago. The majority of
the 68 comments on the article either
echoed or refuted Frozen's sentiments.
While it was comforting that Frozen,
other assault survivors and their allies
took up the tasks of responding to state
ments like "the girl in the story wanted
it" or the question "Bro" posed —"so
did they fuck?" —it is nauseating to me
that those advocating for the respect of
sexual violence survivors had to take the
defensive. (Also nauseating is the fact
that Bro's question has 30 "likes" and
only 10 "dislikes.")

Further viscerally sickening was the
way MemeChu, a Facebook group run
by Stanford students, framed the story:

"Share your sexy, sultry, sweaty stories in
the comments to win a limited edition
MemeChu bro tank!" the group posted,
receiving 11 likes.
The framing and the comments all
suggest that sexual assault is a common
and expected situation for anyone to
experience. The fact that so few people
seemed to acknowledge that survivors
were expressing discomfort suggests that
most students absorbed these words
uncritically.
Some commenters made arguments
along the lines of "Jake," who wrote,
"Isn't the fucking point of journalism to
be controversial, to make people
uncomfortable, to make people question
things and look at them differently?"
While journalism should be a watch
dog for injustice, page views and ad sales
should not (but unfortunately do) hold
more sway—even when the answer to
"who might we make uncomfortable?"
is sexual violence survivors.
Comments like the ones quoted
above force survivors to relive their
traumatic experiences and allow people
who delegitimize such traumas to dom
inate the conversation.
While resistance to rape culture
should exist regardless of how many
people are survivors of violence,
Stanford's numbers paint an especially
dire case for increased sensitivity in
campus conversations.
In April, Health and Promotion
Services released a report that said,
"Four percent of Stanford students
reported having been raped, while
seven percent reported having been
sexually penetrated against their will
and 15 percent reported engaging in
intercourse under pressure, according to
preliminary data from a survey of

roughly 4,000 students."
If these numbers are indicative of
the whole student body, that means that
almost 300 undergraduate students
have been raped, that 400 have been
penetrated against their will and that an
additional 1,000 have had sex under
pressure. This total alone is about the
size of one undergraduate class.
These figures include male students,
both queer and straight. While men also
experience sexual violence, their voices
are particularly erased by a culture that
assumes men cannot be victims of vio
lence.
We need to address the experiences
of these students.
Rape culture is an issue larger than
our campus, but we can make Stanford
a safer place for all assault survivors
and for all students generally. And how
our media frame that conversation is
incredibly important.
In the interest of creating spaces for
the campus to truly engage in safe and
open discussions about sexual violence,
I present the following suggestions for
campus media when addressing these
topics:
1) Include trigger warnings at the
start of every article and column on sex
ual violence. Survivors of such violence
may suffer from PTSD, such that dis
cussion of these topics can trigger flash
backs, panic attacks or other debilitat
ing symptoms. Trigger warnings about
explicit content are a courtesy to sur
vivors who then get the choice to view
such content:
2) Be deliberate about language
and framing (e.g., let's talk about "sur
vivors" rather than "victims");
3) Explore topics such as the preva
lence of acquaintance rape and victim
blaming on campus, the marginalization
of male student assault survivors and
survivors' opinions of the post-assault
support resources and judicial process
a must-read from a student at
Amherst on the college's response to
her sexual assault suggests that the larg
er response system likely doesn't work.
The traditional news-reporting format
might not work well for these topics, but
long-form features would likely be a
step in the right direction;

4) Solicit perspectives that would
contribute to a meaningful treatment
of sexual violence on campus; creating
a system where students could make
initial anonymous contact with publi
cations to share their experiences could
go a long way toward shattering the
silence that male and female survivors
of assault on campus live with on a
daily basis. We need to look into the
vital questions: Do survivors feel safe
on our campus? How can we support
them better?

Kristian would like to know how you
think campus media can effectively
address sexual violence on campus.

preliminary data from a survey of

roughly 4,000 students."
If these numbers are indicative of
the whole student body, that means that
almost 300 undergraduate students
have been raped, that 400 have been
penetrated against their will and that an
additional 1,000 have had sex under
pressure. This total alone is about the
size of one undergraduate class.
These figures include male students,
both queer and straight. While men also
experience sexual violence, their voices
are particularly erased by a culture that
assumes men cannot be victims of vio
lence.
We need to address the experiences
of these students.
Rape culture is an issue larger than
our campus, but we can make Stanford
a safer place for all assault survivors
and for all students generally. And how
our media frame that conversation is
incredibly important.
In the interest of creating spaces for
the campus to truly engage in safe and
open discussions about sexual violence,
I present the following suggestions for
campus media when addressing these
topics:
1) Include trigger warnings at the
start of every article and column on sex
ual violence. Survivors of such violence
may suffer from PTSD, such that dis
cussion of these topics can trigger flash
backs, panic attacks or other debilitat
ing symptoms. Trigger warnings about
explicit content are a courtesy to sur
vivors who then get the choice to view
such content:
2) Be deliberate about language
and framing (e.g., let's talk about "sur
vivors" rather than "victims");
3) Explore topics such as the preva
lence of acquaintance rape and victim
blaming on campus, the marginalization
of male student assault survivors and
survivors' opinions of the post-assault
support resources and judicial process
a must-read from a student at
Amherst on the college's response to
her sexual assault suggests that the larg
er response system likely doesn't work.
The traditional news-reporting format
might not work well for these topics, but
long-form features would likely be a
step in the right direction;

4) Solicit perspectives that would
contribute to a meaningful treatment
of sexual violence on campus; creating
a system where students could make
initial anonymous contact with publi
cations to share their experiences could
go a long way toward shattering the
silence that male and female survivors
of assault on campus live with on a
daily basis. We need to look into the
vital questions: Do survivors feel safe
on our campus? How can we support
them better?

Kristian would like to know how you
think campus media can effectively
address sexual violence on campus.

Trigger warning: This column discuss
es sexual violence, assault and rape and
may be triggering to some people.
£ £ on the editors for decid-
to normalize rape. While
W_/the author of this piece should
be free to share her experience with the
community, that experience should not
be presented as a scintillating 'sex diary.'
The story is not sparking a 'dialogue' in a
vacuum, but rather in an unsafe culture
where, as the comments have proven, it
is commonly assumed that victims desire
their own abuse. The decision to publish
this account as a 'sex column' further
eroticizes violence against women in a
school already pervaded by it. As some
one who has not felt safe on this campus
since her own sexual assault, I am
unnerved and disgusted by the irrespon
sibility of the decision to publish this
piece."
Such were the words of "Frozen,"
who says she is a Stanford student who
was sexually assaulted on campus, in
response to a "sex diary" The Daily
printed two weeks ago. The majority of
the 68 comments on the article either
echoed or refuted Frozen's sentiments.
While it was comforting that Frozen,
other assault survivors and their allies
took up the tasks of responding to state
ments like "the girl in the story wanted
it" or the question "Bro" posed —"so
did they fuck?" —it is nauseating to me
that those advocating for the respect of
sexual violence survivors had to take the
defensive. (Also nauseating is the fact
that Bro's question has 30 "likes" and
only 10 "dislikes.")

Further viscerally sickening was the
way MemeChu, a Facebook group run
by Stanford students, framed the story:

"Share your sexy, sultry, sweaty stories in
the comments to win a limited edition
MemeChu bro tank!" the group posted,
receiving 11 likes.
The framing and the comments all
suggest that sexual assault is a common
and expected situation for anyone to
experience. The fact that so few people
seemed to acknowledge that survivors
were expressing discomfort suggests that
most students absorbed these words
uncritically.
Some commenters made arguments
along the lines of "Jake," who wrote,
"Isn't the fucking point of journalism to
be controversial, to make people
uncomfortable, to make people question
things and look at them differently?"
While journalism should be a watch
dog for injustice, page views and ad sales
should not (but unfortunately do) hold
more sway—even when the answer to
"who might we make uncomfortable?"
is sexual violence survivors.
Comments like the ones quoted
above force survivors to relive their
traumatic experiences and allow people
who delegitimize such traumas to dom
inate the conversation.
While resistance to rape culture
should exist regardless of how many
people are survivors of violence,
Stanford's numbers paint an especially
dire case for increased sensitivity in
campus conversations.
In April, Health and Promotion
Services released a report that said,
"Four percent of Stanford students
reported having been raped, while
seven percent reported having been
sexually penetrated against their will
and 15 percent reported engaging in
intercourse under pressure, according to
preliminary data from a survey of

roughly 4,000 students."
If these numbers are indicative of
the whole student body, that means that
