## I'll take the Axe if you please 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There are few games in col
lege football that go accord
ing to plan. Stanford was
supposed to lose to USC by
41 points in 2007; the
Cardinal pulled off the "Biggest Upset
Ever" to win by one, 24-23.
Rivalry games are supposed to be
even worse not that the Trojans
aren't just as despised as the Golden
Bears. What we witnessed then, when
the 115 th Big Game lulled both teams
and half of "renovated" Memorial
Stadium to sleep with its predictability,
was downright awesome.
After Stanford ran roughshod all
over California on Saturday, head coach
David Shaw noted that the 21-3 road
victory was "a blueprint game." I could
n't agree more.
While I spent much of last week
practicing to get concussed in the Ink
Bowl you stay classy, Daily Cal I
devoted a little time to freaking out
about what the real athletes would be
doing in Memorial Stadium on
Saturday. Frankly, it had me worried.
So much was going Cal's way. They
had the momentum, a wide receiver in
Keenan Allen who I have no doubt will
be playing on Sundays very soon, and
most worryingly, Stanford has been
absolutely abysmal on the road.
That's a bad combination of factors,
particularly when the other team is
playing the rivalry game at home and
has the extra motivation of not having
won in several seasons. I thought
Stanford was the better team, but I
would have taken bets on either team.
Way to prove me wrong, Berkeley.
I was surprised that the players who
trotted out onto the field for Cal on
Saturday didn't have trouble running
through the tumiel given how poorly
they moved the ball on the ground
against the Cardinal defense. That unit
would have had more success trying to
discover a new element for the periodic
table than it did finding the gaps in
Stanford's defense,
Ben Gardner, Trent Murphy,
Terrence Stephens, Chase Thomas,
Shayne Skov and company played
extremely well, and the defensive
scheme from defensive Derek Mason
was top-notch. I'd venture they might
have been worthy even of Lord Fangio.
At any rate, they stopped C.J.
Anderson, Zach Maynard and whoever
touched the ball in the backfield for the
Bears. About the only person that had
free reign of the field for Cal was the
halftime streaker, and even he surren
dered meekly as security corralled him.
Three yards on the ground. Total.
Three-point-nine inches per carry.
Inches.
Those stats smell of absolute domi
nation, and they carry with them a hint
of sadness because with a defense as
good as this one, it's a shame Stanford
has to run the table to catch even a whiff
of roses come January.
But while the offensive woes that
have plagued Stanford all year long
were still evident on Saturday, the prod
uct the Cardinal put on the field was
good enough to win going away in a
blowout.
Major props have to go to running
back Stepfan Taylor, who had a coming
out party that I hope at least some
members of the national media noticed,
with a career-high 189 yards.
It was a team effort, though, as
Stanford put up 475 yards of total
offense. Quarterback Josh Nunes was
not accurate —l6-31 but he threw
for over 200 yards and hit on a huge
play to tight end Zach Ertz when the
Cardinal needed a spark.
In my book, that should be good
enough to win when you have Thomas
recording four tackles for loss, the sec
ondary limiting Allen to just 43 receiv
ing yards and the defense as a whole let
ting Cal's offense gain just 217 total
yards when it had a combined 987 in its
two previous games against UCLA and
Washington State.
Hey, I'll take it.
I'll take backup quarterback Kevin
Hogan throwing his first career touch
down. I'll take the much-improved play
calling of Shaw and his staff on offense.
I'll take Taylor's jukes and stutters and
yards after contact.
And while I don't hold grudges, I
don't take names and I don't take things
too personally or seriously most of the
time, the Axe? Hell yeah, I'll take that.

Miles Bennett-Smith apologizes to
anyone who bet on the Ink Bowl
because he lost the Exacto Knife.
But even with a concussion, dat's our
quarterback. Email him schemes for

down. I'll take the much-improved play
calling of Shaw and his staff on offense.
I'll take Taylor's jukes and stutters and
yards after contact.
And while I don't hold grudges, I
don't take names and I don't take things
too personally or seriously most of the

There are few games in col
lege football that go accord
ing to plan. Stanford was
supposed to lose to USC by
41 points in 2007; the
Cardinal pulled off the "Biggest Upset
Ever" to win by one, 24-23.
Rivalry games are supposed to be
even worse not that the Trojans
aren't just as despised as the Golden
Bears. What we witnessed then, when
the 115 th Big Game lulled both teams
and half of "renovated" Memorial
Stadium to sleep with its predictability,
was downright awesome.
After Stanford ran roughshod all
over California on Saturday, head coach
David Shaw noted that the 21-3 road
victory was "a blueprint game." I could
n't agree more.
While I spent much of last week
practicing to get concussed in the Ink
Bowl you stay classy, Daily Cal I
devoted a little time to freaking out
about what the real athletes would be
doing in Memorial Stadium on
Saturday. Frankly, it had me worried.
So much was going Cal's way. They
had the momentum, a wide receiver in
Keenan Allen who I have no doubt will
be playing on Sundays very soon, and
most worryingly, Stanford has been
absolutely abysmal on the road.
That's a bad combination of factors,
particularly when the other team is
playing the rivalry game at home and
has the extra motivation of not having
won in several seasons. I thought
Stanford was the better team, but I
would have taken bets on either team.
Way to prove me wrong, Berkeley.
I was surprised that the players who
trotted out onto the field for Cal on
Saturday didn't have trouble running
through the tumiel given how poorly
they moved the ball on the ground
against the Cardinal defense. That unit
would have had more success trying to
discover a new element for the periodic
table than it did finding the gaps in
Stanford's defense,
Ben Gardner, Trent Murphy,
Terrence Stephens, Chase Thomas,
Shayne Skov and company played
extremely well, and the defensive
scheme from defensive Derek Mason
was top-notch. I'd venture they might
have been worthy even of Lord Fangio.
At any rate, they stopped C.J.
Anderson, Zach Maynard and whoever
touched the ball in the backfield for the
Bears. About the only person that had
free reign of the field for Cal was the
halftime streaker, and even he surren
dered meekly as security corralled him.
Three yards on the ground. Total.
Three-point-nine inches per carry.
Inches.
Those stats smell of absolute domi
nation, and they carry with them a hint
of sadness because with a defense as
good as this one, it's a shame Stanford
has to run the table to catch even a whiff
of roses come January.
But while the offensive woes that
have plagued Stanford all year long
were still evident on Saturday, the prod
uct the Cardinal put on the field was
good enough to win going away in a
blowout.
Major props have to go to running
back Stepfan Taylor, who had a coming
out party that I hope at least some
members of the national media noticed,
with a career-high 189 yards.
It was a team effort, though, as
Stanford put up 475 yards of total
offense. Quarterback Josh Nunes was
not accurate —l6-31 but he threw
for over 200 yards and hit on a huge
play to tight end Zach Ertz when the
Cardinal needed a spark.
In my book, that should be good
enough to win when you have Thomas
recording four tackles for loss, the sec
ondary limiting Allen to just 43 receiv
ing yards and the defense as a whole let
ting Cal's offense gain just 217 total
yards when it had a combined 987 in its
two previous games against UCLA and
Washington State.
Hey, I'll take it.
I'll take backup quarterback Kevin
Hogan throwing his first career touch
down. I'll take the much-improved play
calling of Shaw and his staff on offense.
I'll take Taylor's jukes and stutters and
yards after contact.
And while I don't hold grudges, I
don't take names and I don't take things
too personally or seriously most of the
time, the Axe? Hell yeah, I'll take that.
