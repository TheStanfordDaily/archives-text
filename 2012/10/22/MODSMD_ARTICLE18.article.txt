# SWEET SIXTEEN
## YOUNG TEAM FINDS WAY TO KEEP WINNING 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The games were certainly closer than anyone
would have hoped, but the Stanford women's vol
leyball team managed to continue its winning ways
and roll through another weekend with two Pac
-12 wins. The Cardinal pulled off five-set road victo
ries over Washington and Washington State,
extending its winning streak to 16 games.

On Friday, No. 2 Stanford (18-2,10-0 Pac-12)
faced off with the No. 5 Washington Huskies (16-2,
7-2), one of its strongest competitors in the Pac-12.
The match certainly didn't start well for the
Cardinal, as it dropped the first set to the Huskies
25-10. Stanford hit .-175 in the set and looked
entirely out of sorts on the offensive end.
The Cardinal refused to go down without a
fight, however, trading blow for blow with the
Huskies throughout the second set. After
Washington rallied to tie the score at 10-10, neither
team managed to take a lead greater than two
until Stanford finally put the Huskies away 28-26.
The third and fourth sets played as near repli
cas of the first two. Stanford performed terribly on
the offensive end in the third, hitting negative and
dropping the set 25-10 again. In the fourth, it man
aged to take an early lead before Washington
roared back. The rest of the set was again back
and-forth, with the Cardinal finally squeaking out
a 26-24 win.
Ultimately, with the match down to the fifth
set, the Cardinal came out as an entirely new team.
Stanford roared to an early 5-1 lead and didn't
look back, capturing the decisive set 15-7. Stanford
hit .400 in the fifth and looked nothing like the
team that had been blown out in two of the first
four sets and barely escaped from the other two.
In the end, however, the Cardinal managed to
continue its win streak and defeat one of the
biggest rivals to its success this year, despite a sea
son-low hitting percentage. They were led on the
offensive front by junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat, who tallied 15 kills and two blocks. A week
after winning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the
Week honors, sophomore libera Kyle Gilbert had
25 digs, tying her career high.
After its shaky performance against
Washington, the Cardinal seemingly lucked out on
Sunday, facing the Washington State Cougars (10-
12,0-10), the only team winless in Pac-12 play. The

Cougars certainly seemed outclassed by Stanford
at the start, as the Cardinal dominated on the
offensive front, hitting .467 and claiming the first
set 25-14.
Washington State came out with more fire in
the second set, but Stanford finished on a 10-5 run
to put the Cougars away, 25-17. Freshman outside
hitter Jordan Burgess led the Cardinal with four
kills, part of her 16 in the match.
With the match looking all but over,
Washington State rallied in a big way. The Cougars
won the first point of the third set and didn't look
back, refusing to relinquish that early lead. The
Cougars claimed the set 25-21, despite Wopat tal
lying six kills. The junior continued her strong play
of late, hitting .467 in the game while leading the
team with 16 kills and seven blocks.
Washington State began the fourth set on a 5-0
run, a lead that Stanford was unable to overcome,
again dropping the set 25-21. For the third straight
game Stanford found itself needing to play a fifth
set, and for the third straight game it found away
to win that decisive set.
The home crowd was into the match and the
momentum was solidly with the Cougars, who
caught a lucky break when the referee ruled
against Stanford on a ball that was blocked at the
net.
But after taking a 6-5 lead in the final set,
Washington State couldn't come through in what
would have been the first Stanford loss to the
Cougars since 2002. The Cardinal defense was suf
focating, holding the Cougars to just .053 hitting
and posting three blocks in the set. Using some
nice plays from freshman outside hitter Brittany
Howard who had three kills, two blocks and an
assist in the set â€” Stanford took the set 15-10,
securing its 16th straight victory and preventing
the Cougars from claiming their first Pac-12 win in
a major upset.
As always, the stellar Stanford freshmen made
their impact felt during the road trip. Burgess had
eight kills and 19 digs against Washington, and tal
lied 16 kills against Washington State. Howard
added 17 kills and 22 digs on the weekend, while
freshman middle blocker Inky Ajanaku had 13
kills and 10 blocks.
Freshman Madi Bugg, splitting time at setter
with senior Karissa Cook, continued to play at a
high level, with 37 sets against Washington and 27
against Washington State. She also added 14 digs
against the Cougars, completing her eighth dou
ble-double of the season.
The Cardinal will look to continue its winning
ways this week against Arizona and Arizona State,
both of which are in the bottom half of the Pac-12
standings. The Wildcats come to Maples Pavilion
on Wednesday, while the Sun Devils will face the
Cardinal on Friday.
