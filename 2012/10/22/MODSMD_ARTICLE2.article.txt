## Course Work most popular despite kinks 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the first of two on Stanford's course man
agement software. The first part addresses criticisms of
Stanford's most popular system, Course Work. The
second will be published tomorrow and discuss alter
native software currently in use.
Course Work, Stanford's centrally supported and
oft-criticized class management system, has enjoyed a
sustained growth in popularity among Stanford users
even as faculty and University administrators contin
ue to promote and develop attempts to complement
or replace it.
"Course Work usage has increased every year,"
wrote Richard Holeton, director of academic com
puting services, in an email to The Daily. "We estimate
that over 90 percent of Stanford students use

of Michigan was used by 4,168 courses during the
2011-12 academic year, a 68 percent increase from
2005, which he attributed to generally positive

"Course Work would have the largest number of
courses, because it's centrally supported and it's been

Nevertheless, a number of third-party challenges
to Course Work's position have emerged in recent
years, often in response to alleged shortcomings and
with mixed reception among faculty.
Sam Purtill 'l3, teaching assistant for PoliSci 51K:
Election 2012, explained his course's decision to use
Piazza to provide a discussion forum as one reflective
of the simplicity of the alternate platform and its abil
ity to tally student input as an effective complement
to Course Work features.
"We weren't trying to teach an entire course
online," Purtill emphasized.
By contrast, Russell Berman, director of the
Thinking Matters program, described largely positive
feedback with Course Work among program faculty,
with grading availability and the ability to disseminate
class materials effectively most widely praised.
"It gets the job done," Berman said. "Things are
