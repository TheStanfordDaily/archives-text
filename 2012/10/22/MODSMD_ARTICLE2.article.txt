## Course Work most popular despite kinks 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the first of two on Stanford's course man
agement software. The first part addresses criticisms of
Stanford's most popular system, Course Work. The
second will be published tomorrow and discuss alter
native software currently in use.
Course Work, Stanford's centrally supported and
oft-criticized class management system, has enjoyed a
sustained growth in popularity among Stanford users
even as faculty and University administrators contin
ue to promote and develop attempts to complement
or replace it.
"Course Work usage has increased every year,"
wrote Richard Holeton, director of academic com
puting services, in an email to The Daily. "We estimate
that over 90 percent of Stanford students use
Course Work, and that it's used by about three-quar
ters of courses."
According to Holeton, the platform originally
the product of collaboration by a consortium includ
ing Stanford, MIT, UC-Berkeley and the University
of Michigan was used by 4,168 courses during the
2011-12 academic year, a 68 percent increase from
2005, which he attributed to generally positive
reviews of the platform's offerings by faculty.
"Course Work would have the largest number of
courses, because it's centrally supported and it's been
out for a while," said Registrar Tom Black, referenc
ing the inability to date of other platforms to gain sig
nificant traction at Stanford. "Once faculty get used to
something, they're often reluctant to move."
Nevertheless, a number of third-party challenges
to Course Work's position have emerged in recent
years, often in response to alleged shortcomings and
with mixed reception among faculty.
Sam Purtill 'l3, teaching assistant for PoliSci 51K:
Election 2012, explained his course's decision to use
Piazza to provide a discussion forum as one reflective
of the simplicity of the alternate platform and its abil
ity to tally student input as an effective complement
to Course Work features.
"We weren't trying to teach an entire course
online," Purtill emphasized.
By contrast, Russell Berman, director of the
Thinking Matters program, described largely positive
feedback with Course Work among program faculty,
with grading availability and the ability to disseminate
class materials effectively most widely praised.
"It gets the job done," Berman said. "Things are
going to change, but they're
going to change differently
across the humanities."

Engineering and science
based majors have been quick,
by contrast, to embrace new
learning management solutions,
with pronounced reliance on
both internally developed solu
tions and programs intended for
use in the new arena of online
education to resolve issues
found with Course Work.
"Because we're the
Computer Science Department
and we can build things, we tend
to use home-grown solutions,"
said Jennifer Widom, chair of the
Computer Science Department.
"Every faculty member can do
what they want."

Both Widom and Mehran
Sahami '93 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99
emphasized the department's
and the University's —focus on
developing online platforms,
such as Coursera or Class2Go,

capable of accessing a much
broader audience. Such plat
forms have, however, encoun
tered mixed reviews to date at
Stanford when applied to small
er classes
"Right now, there's still work
that needs to be done," said
Scott Klemmer, professor of
computer science, who uses
Coursera in teaching CS 147.
"There's a bunch of things you
want to change for the in-person
version... [but] there are some
really frustrating bugs in all plat
forms Everything we're doing
right now is an experiment."
"It's a really exciting area,"
Black added. "Online courses
are disturbing [content] delivery.
...For pedagogical reasons, it
might just be a better way of
helping students to keep up."
Paul Kim, assistant dean of
the School of Education, framed
his school's use of Blackboard
along with other appropriate
platforms as reflective of the
school's desire to accommodate
outside lecturers and speakers
who lack a SUNet ID.
Holeton acknowledged the
existence of areas of concern

with the current offering of
Course Work such as sluggish
speeds, outdated interfaces and
complications with uploading
and downloading multiple files
but insisted such issues would
be resolved through both an
upgrade of the Course Work
platform scheduled for next
summer and the integration of
third-party solutions like Piazza.
"We are early in these
efforts, but we think they will be
highly successful and popular,"
Holeton said. "Successful inte
gration ... will enable us to
increase the features we are
offering while at the same time
preserving the stability, scalabili
ty and core features that
Course Work already brings."
"If instructors want to use [a
platform], we want to make sure
that we integrate it well," Black
said, adding that he anticipated
an increased emphasis being put
on the role of online dialog
between faculty and students.
"We're looking for more capa
bility to interact with each other."

ing the inability to date of other platforms to gain sig
nificant traction at Stanford. "Once faculty get used to
something, they're often reluctant to move."
Nevertheless, a number of third-party challenges
to Course Work's position have emerged in recent
years, often in response to alleged shortcomings and
with mixed reception among faculty.
Sam Purtill 'l3, teaching assistant for PoliSci 51K:
Election 2012, explained his course's decision to use
Piazza to provide a discussion forum as one reflective
of the simplicity of the alternate platform and its abil
ity to tally student input as an effective complement
to Course Work features.
"We weren't trying to teach an entire course
online," Purtill emphasized.
By contrast, Russell Berman, director of the
Thinking Matters program, described largely positive
feedback with Course Work among program faculty,
with grading availability and the ability to disseminate
class materials effectively most widely praised.
"It gets the job done," Berman said. "Things are
going to change, but they're
going to change differently
across the humanities."

Engineering and science
based majors have been quick,
by contrast, to embrace new
learning management solutions,
with pronounced reliance on
both internally developed solu
tions and programs intended for
use in the new arena of online
education to resolve issues
found with Course Work.
"Because we're the
Computer Science Department
and we can build things, we tend
to use home-grown solutions,"
said Jennifer Widom, chair of the
Computer Science Department.
"Every faculty member can do
what they want."

Both Widom and Mehran
Sahami '93 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99
emphasized the department's
and the University's —focus on
developing online platforms,
such as Coursera or Class2Go,

capable of accessing a much
broader audience. Such plat
forms have, however, encoun
tered mixed reviews to date at
Stanford when applied to small
er classes
"Right now, there's still work
that needs to be done," said
Scott Klemmer, professor of
computer science, who uses
Coursera in teaching CS 147.
"There's a bunch of things you
want to change for the in-person
version... [but] there are some
really frustrating bugs in all plat
forms Everything we're doing
right now is an experiment."
"It's a really exciting area,"
Black added. "Online courses
are disturbing [content] delivery.
...For pedagogical reasons, it
might just be a better way of
helping students to keep up."
Paul Kim, assistant dean of
the School of Education, framed
his school's use of Blackboard
along with other appropriate
platforms as reflective of the
school's desire to accommodate
outside lecturers and speakers
who lack a SUNet ID.
Holeton acknowledged the
existence of areas of concern

with the current offering of
Course Work such as sluggish
speeds, outdated interfaces and
complications with uploading
and downloading multiple files
but insisted such issues would
be resolved through both an
upgrade of the Course Work
platform scheduled for next
summer and the integration of
third-party solutions like Piazza.
"We are early in these
efforts, but we think they will be
highly successful and popular,"
Holeton said. "Successful inte
gration ... will enable us to
increase the features we are
offering while at the same time
preserving the stability, scalabili
ty and core features that
Course Work already brings."
"If instructors want to use [a
platform], we want to make sure
that we integrate it well," Black
said, adding that he anticipated
an increased emphasis being put
on the role of online dialog
between faculty and students.
"We're looking for more capa
bility to interact with each other."

This article is the first of two on Stanford's course man
agement software. The first part addresses criticisms of
Stanford's most popular system, Course Work. The
second will be published tomorrow and discuss alter
native software currently in use.
Course Work, Stanford's centrally supported and
oft-criticized class management system, has enjoyed a
sustained growth in popularity among Stanford users
even as faculty and University administrators contin
ue to promote and develop attempts to complement
or replace it.
"Course Work usage has increased every year,"
wrote Richard Holeton, director of academic com
puting services, in an email to The Daily. "We estimate
that over 90 percent of Stanford students use
Course Work, and that it's used by about three-quar
ters of courses."
According to Holeton, the platform originally
the product of collaboration by a consortium includ
ing Stanford, MIT, UC-Berkeley and the University
of Michigan was used by 4,168 courses during the
2011-12 academic year, a 68 percent increase from
2005, which he attributed to generally positive
reviews of the platform's offerings by faculty.
"Course Work would have the largest number of
courses, because it's centrally supported and it's been
out for a while," said Registrar Tom Black, referenc
ing the inability to date of other platforms to gain sig
nificant traction at Stanford. "Once faculty get used to
something, they're often reluctant to move."
