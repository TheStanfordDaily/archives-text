# Stanford flounders at Cal
## CAL TAKES BIG SPLASH EASILY 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The floodgates opened during the second quar
ter of this year's annual Big Splash against
California, and by the end of the game Stanford
was drowning in goals. A 4-0 second quarter that
turned into an 8-2 run for California led to a lop
sided 14-8 drubbing on Saturday morning at
Berkeley's Spieker Aquatics Complex.
The following day, No. 4 Stanford (8-4, 2-2
MPSF) made a trip to Santa Clara where they took
out their frustrations against No.17 Bucknell and
No.13 Air Force at the Rodeo Tournament. The
Cardinal won those games 14-2 and 14-3, respec
tively.
In the Big Splash, Stanford's defense was not
stopping much of anything, but especially not if it
was a shot coming from Cal driver Collin Smith.
The junior, who entered the game as the confer
ence's fourth-leading scorer, finished with six goals.
Smith also scored four goals in the teams' earli
er meeting, which had been the most allowed by
Stanford to any player in a game this season.
The Cardinal offense could not keep up with
the steady onslaught of goals despite sophomore
utility Alex Bowen's best efforts. Bowen almost
matched Smith with four goals of his own on the
day for an offense that generally looked anxious
and out of rhythm.
UC-Berkeley's (10-6, 1-2 MPSF) perimeter
defenders blocked outside shots all game, and
goalie Jon Sibley made saves even when Stanford
had clear scoring chances. Stanford was unable to
block shots from outside or inside, with junior
goalie Scott Platshon recording three saves to
Sibley's eight.
The loss was Stanford's third straight in the Big
Splash and the second blowout in as many years.
This was also California's first Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation win of the season — their losses
came against USC and UCLA, both of which are
undefeated in conference play.
Unlike Stanford's 9-8 win over Cal in their
matchup earlier this year, the Cardinal could not
create momentum with its defense. In the first
meeting, Cal was held to one goal in the opening
quarter and two in the second. This time around,
the Golden Bears notched at least three in every
quarter.
Stanford built a fleeting 3-1 lead behind
Bowen's shooting and quality set play from sopho
more utility Nick Hoversten and sophomore 2-
meter Connor Cleary. They even led 4-3 after the
first quarter, but by the time the halftime whistle
was blown they were in a three-goal hole at 7-4.
Any semblance of a comeback or momentum
change in the second half was short-lived, as the
Cardinal gave up more goals than it has in any
game this season.
On Sunday, freshman driver Brett Bonanni
treated Bucknell and Air Force like his personal
punching bags, scoring 14 goals on the day. After a
two-goal performance against Cal, Bonanni put up
five against Bucknell and then two against Air
Force. Senior driver Travis Noll was the only other
player to score more than two goals during
Sunday's double-header, finishing with three.
These games against nonconference opponents
usually serve as tune-ups for Stanford, which has
won all of its games against teams outside of the
MPSF by at least seven goals this season.
Stanford will drop to fourth place in the MPSF
but remains a half-game ahead of Cal in the stand
ings.
The Cardinal is back home next weekend for a
game on Saturday against UC-Irvine and one on
Sunday against Long Beach State — the two teams
with the worst conference records in the MPSF.
Both games will be start at noon.
