# KISS OUR AXE
## STANFORD DOMINATES CAL IN 115 TH BIG GAME 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
It couldn't have been a more fitting end on
Saturday afternoon, as Stanford players hoisted
the Axe in celebration of their Big Game victo
ry over Cal for the third straight season. After
all, they had just axed Cal's offense for the
entirety of four quarters.

Playing in the 115 th edition of the Big
Game, No. 17 Stanford (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) took
down Cal (3-5,2-3) 21-3 at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium to pick up its first
road win of the season. With the victory, the

Cardinal keeps its Pac-12 championship and
Rose Bowl dreams alive.
"This is a blueprint game," said head coach
David Shaw. "This is what we want to do."
Stanford's sheer defensive dominance was the
big story on Saturday afternoon. Held to just 3
total rushing yards by the Cardinal's stifling run
defense, Cal's ground game amassed as many
yards as the number of points that they put up on
the scoreboard.
It also helped that the Cardinal offense finally
found its groove on the road, racking up 475
yards. After failing to score a single offensive
touchdown in its last two away games, Stanford
reached the end zone three times, all in the first
half
But it was still far from perfect, especially in
the early going.
Quarterback Josh Nunes killed the game
opening drive when he fumbled the ball in Bear

territory. Chase Thomas' sack on quarterback
Zach Maynard moved Cal back 7 yards during its
first possession, but the Cardinal's next promising
drive ended when Jordan Williamson's 40-yard
field goal went just wide left.
Midway through the first quarter, Stanford
scored its long-awaited first offensive touch
down on the road. A nifty 37-yard punt return
by senior Drew Terrell gave the Cardinal a short
field to work with, and a 16-yard reception by
tight end Zach Ertz set up Stepfan Taylor's
touchdown run on first-and-goal.
"It felt good to get that first touchdown on
the road out of our system," Nunes said. "It was
like, 'OK, that's done. Now let's do what we
want to do.'"
Stanford's defense certainly did what it want
ed to do all afternoon by consistently making

Stanford players Shayne Skov (11 on the left) and Stepfan Taylor (33 on the right) hold up the Axe after a 21-3 win over rival Cal
in the 11 sth Big Game at Memorial Stadium. The Cardinal outrushed the Bears 252-3 in the victory.
Maynard uncomfortable in the pocket
and completely taking Cal's top run
ning back C.J. Anderson out of the
equation.
Maynard finished the game 19-of
-31 for 214 yards but was sacked four
times and picked off once. Anderson's
ineffectiveness was even more obvi
ous, as the senior only managed to
gain 5 yards on six carries despite com
ing into the game averaging 7 yards
per touch.
Cal's only points came during the
early moments of the second quarter,
when Keenan Allen displayed an elec
tric burst of speed on a 29-yard punt
return that allowed the Bears to set up
shop at the Stanford 25-yard line. But
even with a first-and-goal at the
Cardinal 2, Cal failed to punch it in on
three straights rushes that resulted in
lost yardage and was forced to settle
for Vincent D'Amato's 21-yard chip
shot.
With its lead trimmed to 7-3,
Stanford wasted no time in getting the
momentum back.
Nunes started the Cardinal's first
drive of the second quarter by hitting
Ertz in stride for a 68-yard comple
tion, all the way down to the Cal 17.
The Bears secondary inexplicably left
one of the nation's best tight ends
wide open on that play, as there were
no blue uniforms within 10 yards of
Ertz when he made the grab.
Three plays later, quarterback
Kevin Hogan recorded his first career
touchdown when he rolled out to his
right on second-and-goal and found
tight end Levine Toilolo for a 9-yard
touchdown pass. The redshirt fresh
man has been seeing more playing
time out of the wildcat formation, or
as Shaw calls it, the "Hogan Package."
"[Hogan] hasn't done a bunch of
this in high school, but he's got the ath
letic ability to do it," said Shaw. "It's
gotten better and better. It will be part
of every game going forward."
Cal's next two possessions ended
in self-destructing turnovers. Thomas,
who recovered a fumble in the end
zone to score Stanford's only touch
down against Notre Dame two week
ends ago, once again showed his knack
for finding the ball by recovering
Brendan Bigelow's fumble at the
Stanford 48-yard line.
A few minutes later, it was safety
Jordan Richards who forced an Allen
fumble that gave the Cardinal prime
field position at the Cal 10. Nunes
made the Bears pay on the very next
play by connecting with a wide-open
Ertz once again for a touchdown.
Creating all kinds of mismatch prob
lems for Cal's secondary, Ertz would
finish the game with six receptions for
134 yards and a score.
"We needed to make big plays in

this game," said Taylor. "[Cal] brings
their best every time we play them. We
needed that, and we needed to score
on the road, too, to get it off our shoul
ders. We can always get better and
score more. So we're going to go prac
tice."

The Cardinal headed into the lock
er rooms with a 21-3 lead at halftime,
not knowing that it wouldn't score
another point in the second half.
As it turned out, Stanford didn't
need to.

The Bears mustered only 10 yards
of offense in the third quarter; the
front seven made big open-field tack
les even when Maynard managed to
move out of the pocket, while the sec
ondary went in lockdown mode on
Allen, whose offensive output consist
ed of just four catches for 43 yards.
Thomas, a midseason Ail-
American first-team selection by
Sports Illustrated, paved the
Cardinal's brilliant defensive perform
ance with seven tackles, including four
tackles for loss and a sack. In addition
to his fumble recovery in the second
quarter, the senior outside linebacker
also forced a fumble and broke up a
pass.

Even by its own high standards, the
Stanford defense shone all afternoon,
recording 11 tackles for loss and forc
ing three turnovers. As the game pro
gressed, Stanford increasingly forced
Cal to become a one-dimensional
passing offense. The Bears came into
the game ranked third in the confer
ence with an average of almost 175
rushing yards per game, but on
Saturday, they couldn't even reach
double, let alone triple, digits.

But Stanford had no trouble with
its running game, thanks to Taylor's
relentless efficiency and the offensive

line's consistent blocking. The senior
captain took the bulk of the carries in
the second half, wearing down Cal's
defense and eating up the clock at the
same time. En route to notching his
fifth 100-yard rushing game this sea
son, Taylor set a career high by rum
bling for 189 yards on 28 carries.
During the third quarter, Taylor
passed former Stanford star running
back Toby Gerhart to become second
on the all-time Stanford career rush
ing list. He now needs 417 more yards
to overtake Darrin Nelson, who
amassed 4,033 yards on the ground
during his distinguished career at
Stanford.
"I can't say enough about [Taylor]
as a person," said Shaw. "I can't say
enough about him as a football play
er."
Nunes, who finished the game 16-
of-31 passing for 214 yards and a
touchdown, threw an interception
right into the hands of Marc Anthony
while the Cardinal was driving in the
red zone during the fourth quarter.
But the Stanford defense stood tall
once again on Cal's next possession
when sophomore corner Wayne
Lyons picked off Maynard near the
goal line on fourth-and-11.
Nine of Cal's drives ended in either
three-and-outs or turnovers. Failing to
convert 13 out of 14 third downs was
the telltale sign of the Bears' dismal
afternoon.
"You don't want to be that class
that gives the Axe away," said Taylor.
"The seniors made it a point that we
want to keep the Axe."
Point taken. For at least another
year, the Axe stays with Stanford.

one of the nation's best tight ends
wide open on that play, as there were
no blue uniforms within 10 yards of
Ertz when he made the grab.
Three plays later, quarterback
Kevin Hogan recorded his first career
touchdown when he rolled out to his
right on second-and-goal and found
tight end Levine Toilolo for a 9-yard
touchdown pass. The redshirt fresh
man has been seeing more playing
time out of the wildcat formation, or
as Shaw calls it, the "Hogan Package."
"[Hogan] hasn't done a bunch of
this in high school, but he's got the ath
letic ability to do it," said Shaw. "It's
gotten better and better. It will be part
of every game going forward."
Cal's next two possessions ended
in self-destructing turnovers. Thomas,
who recovered a fumble in the end
zone to score Stanford's only touch
down against Notre Dame two week
ends ago, once again showed his knack
for finding the ball by recovering
Brendan Bigelow's fumble at the
Stanford 48-yard line.
A few minutes later, it was safety
Jordan Richards who forced an Allen
fumble that gave the Cardinal prime
field position at the Cal 10. Nunes
made the Bears pay on the very next
play by connecting with a wide-open
Ertz once again for a touchdown.
Creating all kinds of mismatch prob
lems for Cal's secondary, Ertz would
finish the game with six receptions for
134 yards and a score.
"We needed to make big plays in

this game," said Taylor. "[Cal] brings
their best every time we play them. We
needed that, and we needed to score
on the road, too, to get it off our shoul
ders. We can always get better and
score more. So we're going to go prac
tice."

The Cardinal headed into the lock
er rooms with a 21-3 lead at halftime,
not knowing that it wouldn't score
another point in the second half.
As it turned out, Stanford didn't
need to.

The Bears mustered only 10 yards
of offense in the third quarter; the
front seven made big open-field tack
les even when Maynard managed to
move out of the pocket, while the sec
ondary went in lockdown mode on
Allen, whose offensive output consist
ed of just four catches for 43 yards.
Thomas, a midseason Ail-
American first-team selection by
Sports Illustrated, paved the
Cardinal's brilliant defensive perform
ance with seven tackles, including four
tackles for loss and a sack. In addition
to his fumble recovery in the second
quarter, the senior outside linebacker
also forced a fumble and broke up a
pass.

Even by its own high standards, the
Stanford defense shone all afternoon,
recording 11 tackles for loss and forc
ing three turnovers. As the game pro
gressed, Stanford increasingly forced
Cal to become a one-dimensional
passing offense. The Bears came into
the game ranked third in the confer
ence with an average of almost 175
rushing yards per game, but on
Saturday, they couldn't even reach
double, let alone triple, digits.

But Stanford had no trouble with
its running game, thanks to Taylor's
relentless efficiency and the offensive

line's consistent blocking. The senior
captain took the bulk of the carries in
the second half, wearing down Cal's
defense and eating up the clock at the
same time. En route to notching his
fifth 100-yard rushing game this sea
son, Taylor set a career high by rum
bling for 189 yards on 28 carries.
During the third quarter, Taylor
passed former Stanford star running
back Toby Gerhart to become second
on the all-time Stanford career rush
ing list. He now needs 417 more yards
to overtake Darrin Nelson, who
amassed 4,033 yards on the ground
during his distinguished career at
Stanford.
"I can't say enough about [Taylor]
as a person," said Shaw. "I can't say
enough about him as a football play
er."
Nunes, who finished the game 16-
of-31 passing for 214 yards and a
touchdown, threw an interception
right into the hands of Marc Anthony
while the Cardinal was driving in the
red zone during the fourth quarter.
But the Stanford defense stood tall
once again on Cal's next possession
when sophomore corner Wayne
Lyons picked off Maynard near the
goal line on fourth-and-11.
Nine of Cal's drives ended in either
three-and-outs or turnovers. Failing to
convert 13 out of 14 third downs was
the telltale sign of the Bears' dismal
afternoon.
"You don't want to be that class
that gives the Axe away," said Taylor.
"The seniors made it a point that we
want to keep the Axe."
Point taken. For at least another
year, the Axe stays with Stanford.

Cal's offense had trouble finding anywhere to turn on Saturday as senior linebacker Chase Thomas (44) and the Cardinal defense were
smothering. Thomas had four tackles for loss and forced two fumbles,
and Stanford outgained the Bears 252-3 on the ground.
It couldn't have been a more fitting end on
Saturday afternoon, as Stanford players hoisted
the Axe in celebration of their Big Game victo
ry over Cal for the third straight season. After
all, they had just axed Cal's offense for the
entirety of four quarters.

Playing in the 115 th edition of the Big
Game, No. 17 Stanford (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) took
down Cal (3-5,2-3) 21-3 at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium to pick up its first
road win of the season. With the victory, the

Cardinal keeps its Pac-12 championship and
Rose Bowl dreams alive.
"This is a blueprint game," said head coach
David Shaw. "This is what we want to do."
Stanford's sheer defensive dominance was the
big story on Saturday afternoon. Held to just 3
total rushing yards by the Cardinal's stifling run
defense, Cal's ground game amassed as many
yards as the number of points that they put up on
the scoreboard.
It also helped that the Cardinal offense finally
found its groove on the road, racking up 475
yards. After failing to score a single offensive
touchdown in its last two away games, Stanford
reached the end zone three times, all in the first
half
But it was still far from perfect, especially in
the early going.
Quarterback Josh Nunes killed the game
opening drive when he fumbled the ball in Bear

territory. Chase Thomas' sack on quarterback
Zach Maynard moved Cal back 7 yards during its
first possession, but the Cardinal's next promising
drive ended when Jordan Williamson's 40-yard
field goal went just wide left.
Midway through the first quarter, Stanford
scored its long-awaited first offensive touch
down on the road. A nifty 37-yard punt return
by senior Drew Terrell gave the Cardinal a short
field to work with, and a 16-yard reception by
tight end Zach Ertz set up Stepfan Taylor's
touchdown run on first-and-goal.
"It felt good to get that first touchdown on
the road out of our system," Nunes said. "It was
like, 'OK, that's done. Now let's do what we
want to do.'"
Stanford's defense certainly did what it want
ed to do all afternoon by consistently making

Stanford players Shayne Skov (11 on the left) and Stepfan Taylor (33 on the right) hold up the Axe after a 21-3 win over rival Cal
in the 11 sth Big Game at Memorial Stadium. The Cardinal outrushed the Bears 252-3 in the victory.
Maynard uncomfortable in the pocket

Maynard finished the game 19-of

times and picked off once. Anderson's
ineffectiveness was even more obvi

gain 5 yards on six carries despite com

per touch.
Cal's only points came during the
early moments of the second quarter,
when Keenan Allen displayed an elec
tric burst of speed on a 29-yard punt
return that allowed the Bears to set up
shop at the Stanford 25-yard line. But
even with a first-and-goal at the
Cardinal 2, Cal failed to punch it in on
three straights rushes that resulted in
lost yardage and was forced to settle
for Vincent D'Amato's 21-yard chip
shot.
With its lead trimmed to 7-3,
Stanford wasted no time in getting the
momentum back.

as a person," said Shaw. "I can't say
enough about him as a football play
er."
Nunes, who finished the game 16-
of-31 passing for 214 yards and a
touchdown, threw an interception
right into the hands of Marc Anthony
while the Cardinal was driving in the
red zone during the fourth quarter.
But the Stanford defense stood tall
once again on Cal's next possession
when sophomore corner Wayne
Lyons picked off Maynard near the
goal line on fourth-and-11.
Nine of Cal's drives ended in either
three-and-outs or turnovers. Failing to
convert 13 out of 14 third downs was
the telltale sign of the Bears' dismal
afternoon.
"You don't want to be that class
that gives the Axe away," said Taylor.
"The seniors made it a point that we
want to keep the Axe."
Point taken. For at least another
year, the Axe stays with Stanford.

Cal's offense had trouble finding anywhere to turn on Saturday as senior linebacker Chase Thomas (44) and the Cardinal defense were
smothering. Thomas had four tackles for loss and forced two fumbles,
and Stanford outgained the Bears 252-3 on the ground.
It couldn't have been a more fitting end on
Saturday afternoon, as Stanford players hoisted
the Axe in celebration of their Big Game victo
ry over Cal for the third straight season. After
all, they had just axed Cal's offense for the
entirety of four quarters.

Playing in the 115 th edition of the Big
Game, No. 17 Stanford (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) took
down Cal (3-5,2-3) 21-3 at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium to pick up its first
road win of the season. With the victory, the

Cardinal keeps its Pac-12 championship and
Rose Bowl dreams alive.
"This is a blueprint game," said head coach
David Shaw. "This is what we want to do."
Stanford's sheer defensive dominance was the
big story on Saturday afternoon. Held to just 3
total rushing yards by the Cardinal's stifling run
defense, Cal's ground game amassed as many
yards as the number of points that they put up on
the scoreboard.
It also helped that the Cardinal offense finally
found its groove on the road, racking up 475
yards. After failing to score a single offensive
touchdown in its last two away games, Stanford
reached the end zone three times, all in the first
half
But it was still far from perfect, especially in
the early going.
Quarterback Josh Nunes killed the game
opening drive when he fumbled the ball in Bear

territory. Chase Thomas' sack on quarterback
Zach Maynard moved Cal back 7 yards during its
first possession, but the Cardinal's next promising
drive ended when Jordan Williamson's 40-yard
field goal went just wide left.
Midway through the first quarter, Stanford
scored its long-awaited first offensive touch
down on the road. A nifty 37-yard punt return
by senior Drew Terrell gave the Cardinal a short
field to work with, and a 16-yard reception by
tight end Zach Ertz set up Stepfan Taylor's
touchdown run on first-and-goal.
"It felt good to get that first touchdown on
the road out of our system," Nunes said. "It was
like, 'OK, that's done. Now let's do what we
want to do.'"
Stanford's defense certainly did what it want
ed to do all afternoon by consistently making

Stanford players Shayne Skov (11 on the left) and Stepfan Taylor (33 on the right) hold up the Axe after a 21-3 win over rival Cal
in the 11 sth Big Game at Memorial Stadium. The Cardinal outrushed the Bears 252-3 in the victory.
Maynard uncomfortable in the pocket
and completely taking Cal's top run
ning back C.J. Anderson out of the
equation.
Maynard finished the game 19-of
-31 for 214 yards but was sacked four
times and picked off once. Anderson's
ineffectiveness was even more obvi
ous, as the senior only managed to
gain 5 yards on six carries despite com
ing into the game averaging 7 yards
per touch.
Cal's only points came during the
early moments of the second quarter,
when Keenan Allen displayed an elec
tric burst of speed on a 29-yard punt
return that allowed the Bears to set up
shop at the Stanford 25-yard line. But
even with a first-and-goal at the
Cardinal 2, Cal failed to punch it in on
three straights rushes that resulted in
lost yardage and was forced to settle
for Vincent D'Amato's 21-yard chip
shot.
With its lead trimmed to 7-3,
Stanford wasted no time in getting the
momentum back.
Nunes started the Cardinal's first
drive of the second quarter by hitting
Ertz in stride for a 68-yard comple
tion, all the way down to the Cal 17.
The Bears secondary inexplicably left
one of the nation's best tight ends
wide open on that play, as there were
no blue uniforms within 10 yards of
Ertz when he made the grab.
Three plays later, quarterback
Kevin Hogan recorded his first career
touchdown when he rolled out to his
right on second-and-goal and found
tight end Levine Toilolo for a 9-yard
touchdown pass. The redshirt fresh
man has been seeing more playing
time out of the wildcat formation, or
as Shaw calls it, the "Hogan Package."
"[Hogan] hasn't done a bunch of
this in high school, but he's got the ath
letic ability to do it," said Shaw. "It's
gotten better and better. It will be part
of every game going forward."
Cal's next two possessions ended
in self-destructing turnovers. Thomas,
who recovered a fumble in the end
zone to score Stanford's only touch
down against Notre Dame two week
ends ago, once again showed his knack
for finding the ball by recovering
Brendan Bigelow's fumble at the
Stanford 48-yard line.
A few minutes later, it was safety
Jordan Richards who forced an Allen
fumble that gave the Cardinal prime
field position at the Cal 10. Nunes
made the Bears pay on the very next
play by connecting with a wide-open
Ertz once again for a touchdown.
Creating all kinds of mismatch prob
lems for Cal's secondary, Ertz would
finish the game with six receptions for
134 yards and a score.
"We needed to make big plays in

this game," said Taylor. "[Cal] brings
their best every time we play them. We
needed that, and we needed to score
on the road, too, to get it off our shoul
ders. We can always get better and
score more. So we're going to go prac
tice."

The Cardinal headed into the lock
er rooms with a 21-3 lead at halftime,
not knowing that it wouldn't score
another point in the second half.
As it turned out, Stanford didn't
need to.

The Bears mustered only 10 yards
of offense in the third quarter; the
front seven made big open-field tack
les even when Maynard managed to
move out of the pocket, while the sec
ondary went in lockdown mode on
Allen, whose offensive output consist
ed of just four catches for 43 yards.
Thomas, a midseason Ail-
American first-team selection by
Sports Illustrated, paved the
Cardinal's brilliant defensive perform
ance with seven tackles, including four
tackles for loss and a sack. In addition
to his fumble recovery in the second
quarter, the senior outside linebacker
also forced a fumble and broke up a
pass.

Even by its own high standards, the
Stanford defense shone all afternoon,
recording 11 tackles for loss and forc
ing three turnovers. As the game pro
gressed, Stanford increasingly forced
Cal to become a one-dimensional
passing offense. The Bears came into
the game ranked third in the confer
ence with an average of almost 175
rushing yards per game, but on
Saturday, they couldn't even reach
double, let alone triple, digits.

But Stanford had no trouble with
its running game, thanks to Taylor's
relentless efficiency and the offensive

line's consistent blocking. The senior
captain took the bulk of the carries in
the second half, wearing down Cal's
defense and eating up the clock at the
same time. En route to notching his
fifth 100-yard rushing game this sea
son, Taylor set a career high by rum
bling for 189 yards on 28 carries.
During the third quarter, Taylor
passed former Stanford star running
back Toby Gerhart to become second
on the all-time Stanford career rush
ing list. He now needs 417 more yards
to overtake Darrin Nelson, who
amassed 4,033 yards on the ground
during his distinguished career at
Stanford.
"I can't say enough about [Taylor]
as a person," said Shaw. "I can't say
enough about him as a football play
er."
Nunes, who finished the game 16-
of-31 passing for 214 yards and a
touchdown, threw an interception
right into the hands of Marc Anthony
while the Cardinal was driving in the
red zone during the fourth quarter.
But the Stanford defense stood tall
once again on Cal's next possession
when sophomore corner Wayne
Lyons picked off Maynard near the
goal line on fourth-and-11.
Nine of Cal's drives ended in either
three-and-outs or turnovers. Failing to
convert 13 out of 14 third downs was
the telltale sign of the Bears' dismal
afternoon.
"You don't want to be that class
that gives the Axe away," said Taylor.
"The seniors made it a point that we
want to keep the Axe."
Point taken. For at least another
year, the Axe stays with Stanford.
