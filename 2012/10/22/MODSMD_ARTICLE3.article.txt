# KISS OUR AXE
## STANFORD DOMINATES CAL IN 115 TH BIG GAME 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
It couldn't have been a more fitting end on
Saturday afternoon, as Stanford players hoisted
the Axe in celebration of their Big Game victo
ry over Cal for the third straight season. After
all, they had just axed Cal's offense for the
entirety of four quarters.

Playing in the 115 th edition of the Big
Game, No. 17 Stanford (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) took
down Cal (3-5,2-3) 21-3 at the newly renovated
California Memorial Stadium to pick up its first
road win of the season. With the victory, the

Cardinal keeps its Pac-12 championship and
Rose Bowl dreams alive.
"This is a blueprint game," said head coach
David Shaw. "This is what we want to do."
Stanford's sheer defensive dominance was the
big story on Saturday afternoon. Held to just 3
total rushing yards by the Cardinal's stifling run
defense, Cal's ground game amassed as many
yards as the number of points that they put up on
the scoreboard.
It also helped that the Cardinal offense finally
found its groove on the road, racking up 475
yards. After failing to score a single offensive
touchdown in its last two away games, Stanford
reached the end zone three times, all in the first
half
But it was still far from perfect, especially in
the early going.
Quarterback Josh Nunes killed the game
opening drive when he fumbled the ball in Bear

territory. Chase Thomas' sack on quarterback
Zach Maynard moved Cal back 7 yards during its
first possession, but the Cardinal's next promising
drive ended when Jordan Williamson's 40-yard
field goal went just wide left.
Midway through the first quarter, Stanford
scored its long-awaited first offensive touch
down on the road. A nifty 37-yard punt return
by senior Drew Terrell gave the Cardinal a short
field to work with, and a 16-yard reception by
tight end Zach Ertz set up Stepfan Taylor's
touchdown run on first-and-goal.
"It felt good to get that first touchdown on
the road out of our system," Nunes said. "It was
like, 'OK, that's done. Now let's do what we
want to do.'"
Stanford's defense certainly did what it want
ed to do all afternoon by consistently making
