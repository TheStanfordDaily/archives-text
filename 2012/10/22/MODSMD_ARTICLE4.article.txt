## Sweet shop to open in Tresidder 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
Decadence, a sweet shop managed
by Residential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE), is under construction at
Tresidder next to Fraiche Yogurt and will
fill the space fonnerly occupied by Peet's
Coffee. The store's opening date is cur
rently unknown.
According to Michael Gratz, execu
tive director of Stanford Hospitality and
Auxiliaries, Decadence will offer a vari
ety of the Bay Area's "best desserts,"
including cakes, chocolate, cupcakes and
pastries

The store is one of several "food con
cepts" created by R&DE to operate
within the Union Square area inside
Tresidder Union. R&DE introduced
two other food concepts over the sum
mer — Basils, which serves Italian
entrees like deep-dish pizza, baked
lasagna and pasta dishes, and Heirlooms,

which rebranded the Tresidder salad bar.
"When you look at the entire serving
area and all the food options in that
space, [R&DE is] trying to develop
things that complement one another,"
said Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
operations and student unions
Smith-Laws said that R&DE typi
cally surveys students or holds focus
groups before deciding to introduce a
new food concept and often changes
their menus in order to "keep up with
the food trends"
According to Smith-Laws R&DE
previously managed the Peet's Coffee
that is now being replaced by
Decadence. Though she could not con
firm that R&DE shut down Peet's
because of the installation of Starbucks
in Tresidder this summer, she said that it
"doesn't make sense" to have two coffee
retailers competing in one student
union.

Kenny Johnson' 14 said that while he
doesn't often dine at Tresidder, he
believes the sweet shop will fill a unique
niche and is an appropriate use of the
available space.
"It's hard to put in a bigger restau
rant, so a sweet shop kind of makes
sense," he said. "There are more
grandiose, better food options that I
would like to have, but I know that space
is pretty small so it would be really hard."
According to Smith-Laws, R&DE's
introduction of new food concepts like
Decadence has contributed to the effort
to "revitalize Tresidder and make
Tresidder the best place it can be" by
drawing student interest.
"I'm glad they are opening a new food
establishment," Ketaki Shiiram 'l3 said.'l
don't go to Tresidder that much, but IU go
there to check out the sweet shop."
Carolyn Rennels 14 agreed.
"I don't really know much about it
