## Tech founders speak at Startup School 2012 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
"No matter how hard it looks, it's
harder than it looks."
Ben Horowitz, founder and gener
al partner of the venture capital firm
Andreessen Horowitz, set the tone for
Saturday's Startup School, a sympo
sium run by YCombinator, a startup
incubator, and the Business Association
of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students
(BASES). He joined Mark
Zuckerberg and a number of promi
nent Silicon Valley figures who dis
cussed their experiences with founding
and growing startup companies.
Startup School admitted 1,800
attendees, covering a range of profes
sional and nonprofessional levels, after

an application process that ended in
September.

"We used to have around 900
attendees come to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and this year we were able
to accommodate about 1,900," said
Ruby Lee 'l3, co-president of BASES.
"The draw isn't just the talks", said
Dean Cooney, a sophomore at the
University of Chicago, who flew in for
the event. "It's more the people who
come here. People come from all over
in fact, I noticed more people who
came in from elsewhere, instead of
people from California."
Mark Zuckerberg kicked off the
event with a discussion of his experi
ences during the early startup phases of
Facebook. FEs talk was moderated by

Phil Graham, a YCombinator founder.
Zuckerberg's talk was greeted by rau
cous applause and was often punctuat
ed by claps or laughs from the audi
ence.
"It was really hard to decide to start
a company," he admitted. He said that
while he felt that there was space for a
new social network in the market, at
the time of Facebook's founding, he
doubted his own abilities.
"I thought it would be someone big
like Microsoft," he said, discussing his
surprise with Facebook's popularity
and growth in the social network
sphere.
Zuckerberg also emphasized the
need to develop something that is
unique and that can present a clear

alternative to the competition. He sub
stantiated it with an anecdote from his
early days of expanding and growing
Facebook in new markets.
"Some schools would take longer
than others," he said. "So we wanted to
go to the schools that would be the
hardest for us to succeed at."
His rationale was that by entering
markets where it would be most diffi
cult to succeed, he would know
through success or failure whether he
had a product that was truly special. He
went on to admit his own naivete at the
time of Facebook's creation.
"I never really understood the psy
chology of starting a company," he said.
Later in the day, Travis Kalanick,
founder and CEO of Ãœber, a luxury
vehicle hire company, added to the
day's theme of disruption and pioneer
ing new fields.
"When you do something success
ful, not everybody is happy the older
the industry you're attacking is, the
more it is protected."
Kalanick added that having a
unique solution to a unique problem is
what really matters in the startup world.
If there was one consistent theme
running through every speaker's talk, it
was the difficulty of executing an idea
unique enough for people to want, and
eventually to need.
Horowitz explained that from the
point of view of venture capitalists, "A
breakthrough idea is something people
can't see at first."
"All great investments look contro

versial at the time; a startup founder
needs the courage to have a break
through idea," he said.
He argued that the key is to make
something that people first want, and
then slowly need, to use,
"Come on, you all need Facebook,"
he joked, referring to the social net
work's increasing global popularity.
Horowitz went on to stress the
importance of management in the slow
transition from a startup to a full-scale
company.
While Horowitz acknowledged that
the founders' technical skills are the
basis for the establishment of any com
pany he said the ability to "articulate a
vision that can get people to follow
you" is key to its growth.
Livingston had emphasized similar
ideas earlier during the event, explain
ing the importance of dedication in the
success of any entrepreneurial initiative.
"If you execute well, then eventual
ly you will win people over While
the process is like a roller coaster, start
ups are hard, not impossible," he said.
"The product is the only thing that

matters, and everything you add makes
everything else less important," said
Tom Preston-Warner, CEO of Github.
"If you can argue about something that
matters, and not the people behind it,
you can have a good product... and
throw all your titles away."
