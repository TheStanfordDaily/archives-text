# ELECTION 2012
## Props 30,38 divide PTA, school board 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) Parent Teacher
Association (PTA) Council and the
Board of Education are split on endors
ing competing Propositions 30 and 38.
The November ballot propositions
would raise tax revenues to provide edu
cation funding.
The PTA and the board officially
endorse Proposition 38, but only the
board endorses both to ensure that at
least one passes. The division of endorse
ment comes out of the confusion over
which proposition best meets the needs
of state education.
"It's not clear which is better for
education or not," Camille Townsend,
president of the PAUSD Board of
Education said.
David Plank, Stanford professor and
executive director of Policy Analysis for
California Education, echoed
Townsend's sentiments, saying there is
ambiguity over which proposition would
provide the most direct and effective
funds for education.
Proposition 30, created by Governor
Jerry Brown, would generate $7 billion
in tax revenues by raising the state sales
tax by a quarter of a percent and increas
ing income tax rates over seven years for
people making over $250,000 annually.
Under existing Proposition 98, 89
percent of these revenues would go
toward K-12 education and 11 percent
toward institutions of higher education,
like the University of California system
and community colleges.
