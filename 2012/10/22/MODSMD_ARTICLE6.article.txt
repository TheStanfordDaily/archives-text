# ELECTION 2012
## Props 30,38 divide PTA, school board 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) Parent Teacher
Association (PTA) Council and the
Board of Education are split on endors
ing competing Propositions 30 and 38.
The November ballot propositions
would raise tax revenues to provide edu
cation funding.
The PTA and the board officially
endorse Proposition 38, but only the
board endorses both to ensure that at
least one passes. The division of endorse
ment comes out of the confusion over
which proposition best meets the needs
of state education.
"It's not clear which is better for
education or not," Camille Townsend,
president of the PAUSD Board of
Education said.
David Plank, Stanford professor and
executive director of Policy Analysis for
California Education, echoed
Townsend's sentiments, saying there is
ambiguity over which proposition would
provide the most direct and effective
funds for education.
Proposition 30, created by Governor
Jerry Brown, would generate $7 billion
in tax revenues by raising the state sales
tax by a quarter of a percent and increas
ing income tax rates over seven years for
people making over $250,000 annually.
Under existing Proposition 98, 89
percent of these revenues would go
toward K-12 education and 11 percent
toward institutions of higher education,
like the University of California system
and community colleges.
Proposition 38, created by
attorney Molly Munger and
sponsored by the PTA of
California, would raise $1.7 bil
lion within the first four years by
increasing income taxes across
the board on a progressive scale
for 12 years, starting with earners
slightly above the $7,000 line.
Unlike Proposition 30, the
funds raised by 38 would first go
to debt retirement and the gen
eral fund and then directly into
the K-12 public school system,
without having to go through
Sacramento, Plank said.
According to both Plank and
Townsend, there is a unique risk
in these propositions because the
California educational budget
was signed with the assumption
that Proposition 30 would pass
and be enacted to avoid $5 bil
lion in "trigger cuts."
The trigger cuts could play
out in various ways across the
state, but Plank said that the cur
rently discussed plan if the trig
ger cuts are implemented is to
cut the school year from 180
days to 165, bringing negative
consequences to teachers and
students alike.

"If you assume that time is
necessary to learning, it's a pretty
dramatic cut," Plank said.
Plank argued that if Prop 30
were to fail, the revenue raised

by Prop 38 would not be enough
to buffer the effects of the trigger
cuts.

However, Nancy Krop, vice
president of advocacy for
PAUSD's PTA Council, argued
that Prop 38 would raise enough
funds both to buffer the effects
of the trigger cuts and to provide
for a long-term solution to the
state's poor educational per
formance.

She said that Prop 30 would
ultimately only sustain the cur
rent status quo of education,
since more cuts could happen
after the seven years of tax
increase.

"The PTA won't endorse a
proposition that will end up after
seven years with a negative cut
to education," Krop said to
explain why the PTA is endors
ing only Proposition 38.

Given the confusion over
which proposition best serves
the needs of education,
Townsend said the board
endorses both because "if we
start debating the two proposi
tions, my fear is that they will
both lose."

Townsend added that in
anticipation of the trigger cuts
PAUSD has already incorporat
ed the trigger cut effects into the
2012-13 school year budget. In
the last couple of years, the
board cut overtime and positions
in the business office, and it cut
five district office positions in the
last several years.
The district has also steadily
increased classroom sizes to pre

vent laying off teachers.
"We're getting to the point
where our class sizes are where
we hate to raise them any more,"
Townsend said.
However, Plank said that
while PAUSD will be affected by
the trigger cuts, "Where there'd
be hurricanes in other parts of
the state, there'd be a strong
breeze in PAUSD."
In 2010, 75 percent of Palo
Alto voters approved a partial
measure to help fund district
teachers, an example of the strong
support Plank says will help
PAUSD handle the trigger cuts.
Though officially endorsing
its own proposition, Krop said
the PTA Council unofficially
recognizes the need for either
one to pass
In light of this, Krop hosted a
neutral public forum on both
propositions on Oct. 10 to edu
cate voters on the impact each
will have on restoring the state's
education quality to its former
glory.
"There was a time when
California was at the top, so we
can choose to be at the top
again," Krop said.
While the ambiguity over
each proposition remains,
endorsers of both agree that the
state cannot afford for both to
fail.
"If they both fail, it is a des
perate day for the schoolchildren
of California," Townsend said.

again," Krop said.
While the ambiguity over
each proposition remains,
endorsers of both agree that the
state cannot afford for both to
fail.
"If they both fail, it is a des
perate day for the schoolchildren
of California," Townsend said.

The Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) Parent Teacher
Association (PTA) Council and the
Board of Education are split on endors
ing competing Propositions 30 and 38.
The November ballot propositions
would raise tax revenues to provide edu
cation funding.
The PTA and the board officially
endorse Proposition 38, but only the
board endorses both to ensure that at
least one passes. The division of endorse
ment comes out of the confusion over
which proposition best meets the needs
of state education.
"It's not clear which is better for
education or not," Camille Townsend,
president of the PAUSD Board of
Education said.
David Plank, Stanford professor and
executive director of Policy Analysis for
California Education, echoed
Townsend's sentiments, saying there is
ambiguity over which proposition would
provide the most direct and effective
funds for education.
Proposition 30, created by Governor
Jerry Brown, would generate $7 billion
in tax revenues by raising the state sales
tax by a quarter of a percent and increas
ing income tax rates over seven years for
people making over $250,000 annually.
Under existing Proposition 98, 89
percent of these revenues would go
toward K-12 education and 11 percent
toward institutions of higher education,
like the University of California system
and community colleges.
Proposition 38, created by
attorney Molly Munger and
sponsored by the PTA of
California, would raise $1.7 bil
lion within the first four years by
increasing income taxes across
the board on a progressive scale
for 12 years, starting with earners
slightly above the $7,000 line.
Unlike Proposition 30, the
funds raised by 38 would first go
to debt retirement and the gen
eral fund and then directly into
the K-12 public school system,
without having to go through
Sacramento, Plank said.
According to both Plank and
Townsend, there is a unique risk
in these propositions because the
California educational budget
was signed with the assumption
that Proposition 30 would pass
and be enacted to avoid $5 bil
lion in "trigger cuts."
The trigger cuts could play
out in various ways across the
state, but Plank said that the cur
rently discussed plan if the trig
ger cuts are implemented is to
cut the school year from 180
days to 165, bringing negative
consequences to teachers and
students alike.

"If you assume that time is
necessary to learning, it's a pretty
dramatic cut," Plank said.
Plank argued that if Prop 30
were to fail, the revenue raised

by Prop 38 would not be enough
to buffer the effects of the trigger
cuts.

However, Nancy Krop, vice
president of advocacy for
PAUSD's PTA Council, argued
that Prop 38 would raise enough
funds both to buffer the effects
of the trigger cuts and to provide
for a long-term solution to the
state's poor educational per
formance.

She said that Prop 30 would
ultimately only sustain the cur
rent status quo of education,
since more cuts could happen
after the seven years of tax
increase.

"The PTA won't endorse a
proposition that will end up after
seven years with a negative cut
to education," Krop said to
explain why the PTA is endors
ing only Proposition 38.

Given the confusion over
which proposition best serves
the needs of education,
Townsend said the board
endorses both because "if we
start debating the two proposi
tions, my fear is that they will
both lose."

Townsend added that in
anticipation of the trigger cuts
PAUSD has already incorporat
ed the trigger cut effects into the
2012-13 school year budget. In
the last couple of years, the
board cut overtime and positions
in the business office, and it cut
five district office positions in the
last several years.
The district has also steadily
increased classroom sizes to pre

vent laying off teachers.
"We're getting to the point
where our class sizes are where
we hate to raise them any more,"
Townsend said.
However, Plank said that
while PAUSD will be affected by
the trigger cuts, "Where there'd
be hurricanes in other parts of
the state, there'd be a strong
breeze in PAUSD."
In 2010, 75 percent of Palo
Alto voters approved a partial
measure to help fund district
teachers, an example of the strong
support Plank says will help
PAUSD handle the trigger cuts.
Though officially endorsing
its own proposition, Krop said
the PTA Council unofficially
recognizes the need for either
one to pass
In light of this, Krop hosted a
neutral public forum on both
propositions on Oct. 10 to edu
cate voters on the impact each
will have on restoring the state's
education quality to its former
glory.
"There was a time when
California was at the top, so we
can choose to be at the top
again," Krop said.
While the ambiguity over
each proposition remains,
endorsers of both agree that the
state cannot afford for both to
