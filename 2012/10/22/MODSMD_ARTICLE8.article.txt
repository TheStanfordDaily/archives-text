## High-speed rail debate heats up 
### STEPHANY YONG 
After the federal government approved the first
leg of California's high-speed rail project in mid-
September, controversy has surrounded the project
on the Peninsula.
Most of the funding in a spring bill to begin con
struction on the high-speed rail line will go to con
struction of the first Central Valley segment, but the
bill also provides $705 million to electrify Caltrain.
These funds will be shifted from the ends of the line
to the Central Valley segment if there are cost over
runs.
"The last [state] legislation that went through
made that decision on the Central Valley, allocating
money to the bookends, which means the electrifica
tion of Caltrain," Palo Alto City Councilman Pat
Burt said. "That's our city's focus right now: how to
do a successful modernization of Caltrain, which
means electrification, and how do we look at all the
impacts and benefits of that project."
The $69 billion project aims to construct the
nation's first high-speed rail line, connecting Los
Angeles to San Francisco. The 800-mile track would
stretch through Menlo Park and Palo Alto, affecting
36.2 acres of Stanford-owned land. Although feder
al and state approval have cleared the way for con
struction to begin in 2013, pressing budget con
straints and an onslaught of lawsuits have local lead
ers skeptical of the actual progress that will be made
on the high-speed rail project.
The City of Palo Alto continues its involvement
in litigation against the California High-Speed Rail
Authority with regard to the adequacy of its
Environmental Impact Report from Merced to San
Francisco. Palo Alto City Council Rail Committee
Chair Larry Klein doubts the environmental bene
fits associated with the high-speed rail itself
"Environmental studies show that the high
speed rail is not environmentally beneficial, because
it would require so much concrete and earth mov
ing," Klein said. "It is true that once it is completed,
taking a train would put less carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere than flying, but the deficit created dur
ing construction would take about 70 years to bal
ance out."
Klein was also concerned that the rail's design
would lead to the construction of a wall through
Palo Alto in order to elevate the track going through
the city.
"If the high-speed rail were ever built, we will
remain on our guard in anticipation of [them] bring
back plans for an elevated structure," Klein said.
"Beyond that, the rest of it seems so far out in the
future now that we're not particularly concerned
about it."
The electrification of Caltrain may pose issues of
its own at Palo Alto's rail-street intersections, which

according to Burt are notorious for causing traffic
delays.

"The potential impact is if the number of trains
per hour goes up significantly at a certain point in
town, we have a potential increase in grade cross
ings," Burt said. "The biggest concern for the city is
that when we get an improved Caltrain, there will be
more trains per hour at peak hours.
"We're already pretty congested at those grade
crossings at rush hour with a lot of traffic backup," he
said. "If there are more trains, there will be more
backup."

Members of neighboring communities have also
been active in evaluating the high-speed rail project.
William Grindley, an Atherton resident and former
member of the Atherton Rail Committee, has met
with members of the Community Coalition on
High-Speed Rail and the civic organization High-
Speed Boondoggle, which believes that the
California High-Speed Rail Authority has misled
voters. Having co-authored 36 reports regarding the
financial and operational implications of the high
speed rail project, Grindley is a critic of the "blend
ing" system in which Caltrain and high-speed rail
trains share Caltrain's existing tracks on a system
that remains substantially within the existing
Caltrain corridor.

"The $69 billion is a marketing gimmick"
Grindley said. "It only gets a rider from somewhere
in the San Fernando Valley to San Jose. The $69 bil
lion is also a low-ball estimate, even to construct the
illegal 'blended' system."

"Every megaproject exceeds its budget by an
average of 45 percent," he said. "The ridership num
bers are phony and have been challenged by experts
not paid for by the Fligh-Speed Rail Authority."
Burt believes the improvement of the
Peninsula's rail system could help to alleviate traffic
congestion, some of which is caused by Stanford
related traffic. The University provides Caltrain Go
Passes to its employees, an initiative that was recent
ly expanded to inciude hospital employees
"We're a big station [in Palo Alto] and Stanford's
a big part of that," he said. "As we electrify, we'll have
faster trains that go to more and more locations and
transport people more quickly. We have to look at
the impact in the context of the community."
