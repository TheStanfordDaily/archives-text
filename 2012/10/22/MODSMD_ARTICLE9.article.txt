## School of Medicine debuts new 'flipped classroom' method 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Walk into a School of Medicine class and you
likely won't find a stern professor lecturing stu
dents in front of a projector. Instead, groups of
medical students may be scattered across the
room, working together on activities ranging from
case studies to simulations.
This "flipped classroom" approach of teaching
is part of the newly formed Stanford Medical
Interactive Learning Initiatives (SMILI), which
emphasizes interactive learning through technol
ogy and supports faculty who are interested in
developing new strategies to improve their effec
tiveness in classrooms as teachers.
According to Charles Prober, senior associate
dean for medical education at the School of
Medicine, this has led to two main changes in the
classroom: the delivery of the content and how
students spend their time in a classroom. Rather
than the traditional lecture model, material is
delivered through small video lectures for stu
dents to watch on their own time, while class time
is reserved for working on problems with their
peers.
"The videos give the information, and the
classroom is where we put principles into practice.
We did a little pilot last year, which was well
received by students," said Neil Gesundheit, who
teaches an endocrinology module.
The School of Medicine has been recording its
lectures and posting them online for over 20 years,
but SMILI intends to utilize the advantages of
placing content into videos to present course
material in a more purposeful way.
"[SMILI's concept of teaching is] more
dynamic and makes the material more live, rele

vant and engaging," Prober said. "It makes a big
ger impact and becomes more memorable."
"When you teach these tilings the same way in
a lecture format for 30 hours a week for many
weeks at a time, it gets monotonous and not very
exciting. In-class activities force the student to be
an active learner," he added.
Prober also added that the program has been
popular among students.
"The feedback we have heard from students is
that it is more dynamic and motivational than the
older, more passive way of teaching," he said.
Prober first became very interested in the
flipped classroom model a year and a half ago,
when he noticed that online courses were
extremely impactful simply because of the way
the information was packaged and delivered. He
was interested in looking at the model in a med
ical context and subsequently wrote a paper on
the subject for the New England Journal of
Medicine.
The paper discussed the pilot SMILI course,
which was the Medical School's core biochemistry
course. In the 2011-12 school year, the class was
redesigned to follow a flipped classroom model.
As a result, positive student reviews increased
substantially and class attendance rose from 30
percent to 80 percent.
The SMILI initiative only officially began four
months ago, but according to Prober the group of
supporters has been increasingly growing, made
up not only of faculty but also of residents and
practicing physicians.
SMILI is not confined to Stanford. Prober has
also spoken with Sal Khan, founder of Khan
Academy, who was interested in supporting the
