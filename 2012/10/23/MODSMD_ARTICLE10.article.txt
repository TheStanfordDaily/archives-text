# STUDENT LIFE
## Haus Mitt theme plays on Arrillaga donations 
### BRITTANY TORREZ 
A sign posted on the Upper Row
may lead the gullible student to think
that John Arrillaga '92 MBA '9B
endowed yet another program at
Stanford. But the Arrillaga Center for
German Living and Culture is not the
billionaire's newest contribution to
Stanford; it is the invention of Haus
Mitteleuropa's house staff.
"The theme is inspired by the
ongoing joke on campus 'lt's in
Arrillaga,' 'Which Arrillaga?' since
John Arrillaga has been so generous
to Stanford," Resident Assistant
(RA) Wesley Dunnagan 'l3 said. "So
why not make Haus the Arrillaga
Center for German Culture and
Living?"
The self-op's theme which
Community Manager Chrissy
Scannell 'l3 said is Residential
Education's favorite this year

includes a kitchen that has been reti
tled the Arrillaga Center for Culinary
Arts and a bar labeled the Arrillaga
Center for Beer Education and
Appreciation.
House staff said that they enjoyed
themselves as they explored the cre
ative possibilities that this theme
offered.

"It just came up randomly during
a brainstorming session," Dunnagan
said. "We were excited to have a
theme that wasn't a pun."
Staff put fake bills on the wall sur
rounding plastic palm tree hang-ups.
As residents enter the house, they can

see "Haus Mitt" spelled out on the
staircase in $lOO bills. Haus Mitt staff
also included basketball decorations
to reference the fact that Arrillaga
attended Stanford on a basketball
scholarship in the late 19505.
Some favorites of the staff include
the Arrillaga Center for Fashion and
Design (the laundry room) and the
Arrillaga Center for Meditation and
Music Appreciation (the lounge).
Every dorm room door is labeled
with a signed check addressed to the
residents of the room.
"We have had only positive reac
tions from everyone we've encoun
tered," Scannell said. "Some have
thought it was actually a new center
funded by Arrillaga, but as soon as
they realize it's the just house theme,
they break out laughing."
From the $lOO-bill-covered walls
to the Arrillaga Center for Hygiene
and Bodily Functions (the bath
room), some residents wondered if
Arrillaga himself would enjoy the
theme.
"I think he would take it for what
it is: a joke," resident Matthew Rios
'l3 said. "He would have a good laugh
along with us."
"We have no idea if he knows or
not," added Dunnagan. "But we hope
that he knows that we appreciate
everything he has done for this cam
pus and that he himself will enjoy a
nice chuckle."

Haus Mitteleuropa's theme, the Arrillaga Center for German Living and
Culture, pokes fun at the ubiquity of John Arrillaga's name on the
Stanford campus. Renamed rooms include the lounge (above).
