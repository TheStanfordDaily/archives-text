## Four Acronyms to Know 
### Emily Cohodes 
For week two of the Stanford stu
dent's guide to resources on cam
pus, I'll be focusing on services
that all too often go unnoticed and
unused. (If you missed the first part of
this list, check out last week's column.)
Tucked into various offices all across
campus, these are four free, on-campus
services that may come in handy dur
ing your time on the Farm. Read this
list! If you think you'll never need sup
port after a sexual assault, pregnancy
test or HIV testing, college might sur
prise you. And even if it doesn't, you'll
know where to send a friend in need.
The Office of Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse (SARA)

What it is: SARA is Stanford's on
campus resource for students dealing
with relationship abuse and the aca
demic, residential and interpersonal
difficulties that can result.
How to use it: Contact SARA at
650-725-9129 or
saraoffice@stanford.edu. Office
appointments are available Monday-
Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Helpful hints: If you suspect that
someone you know may be the victim
of relationship abuse, contact SARA
for guidance about how to help that
person get the support that they need.
In addition to SARA, contact
Stanford's 24-hour confidential and
anonymous Rape Crisis Counseling
Line at 650-725-9955 for round the
clock medical, emotional and legal
support.

Student Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC)
What it is: SHPRC is Stanford's go
to on-campus sexual health resource
that provides both walk-in and phone
counseling by trained student coun
selors and a selection of items for sale
that promote safe sex.
How to use it: Contact SHRPC by
phone at 650-SAFE-SEX (723-3739)
or stop by the office on the second
floor of Vaden, Monday-Thursday, 12
p.m. to 6 p.m. and Friday 12 p.m. to 5
p.m. for counseling or advice on all
things sexual, or to purchase condoms,
pregnancy tests, lube and toys from
their store. SHPRC also has an exten
sive library of books ranging from 50
Shades of Grey to The Guide to
Getting It On that can be checked out
for up to a week.
Helpful hints: Undergrads â€”be
sure to stop by to pick up your 30 free
condoms per quarter! The people who
work at SHRPC are old pros with this
stuff, (you'll see them walking around
campus wearing shirts that say "Let's
Talk About Sex"), so you coming in to
pick up a few condoms really won't be
that awkward and you might even get
to meet the Tree who has a regular
shift on staff!

lIIVPACI (HTV Peer Anonymous
Counseling and Testing)

What it is: HIV*PACT is a service
run by iThrive (formerly Health
Promotion Services) that offers free,
anonymous and fast HIV testing;
you'll get your results by the end of the
day. Tests are administered by students
who are trained to provide informa
tion, emotional support and counsel
ing.
How to use it: Make an appoint
ment online at hiv.stanford.edu
Helpful hints: You should know
that for some reason Vaden doesn't
permit your friend or partner to come
into the exam room with you during
your appointment, so while I recom
mend taking a good friend along if you
need support, don't be surprised by
this policy. HIV*PACT offers both
needle and saliva tests for maximum
comfort both options are extremely
accurate. If you think you may have
come in contact with HIV, do not wait
to get tested and contact HIV*PACT
immediately as there are some treat
ments that can prevent infection if
taken within 72 hours of exposure.
LGBT Community Resources
Center
What it is: The LGBT-CRC offers
support to students on a wide range of
issues surrounding gender identity and
sexual orientation. The center offers
counseling as well as referrals to
appropriate community resources and
runs a program for LGBT and ques
tioning freshmen at Stanford called
Community Academic Support and
Advising (CASA) to support first
year students as they transition to life
at Stanford and navigate campus
stereotypes, personal relationships,
dorms and family relations.
How to use it: The LGBT
Community Resource Center is locat
ed at the Fire Truck House at 433
Santa Teresa St. Stop by to find out
about more events and programs or
call 650-725-4222. Find out more at
lgbt.stanford.edu
Helpfid hints: The LGBT-CRC is
just one of many on-campus resources
for LGBT and questioning students
and their allies. Other student groups
and services include the Queer
Straight Alliance and Stanford Pride.
