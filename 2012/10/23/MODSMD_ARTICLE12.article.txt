## Winning Big Game deserves a celebration 
### PETER "SHOTGUN" MCDONALD '11 
On Saturday, as you may have
heard, we won Big Game.
There was a rally in White
Plaza, complete with the Band and
the Axe. I know it wasn't well publi
cized, just an email sent out two hours
beforehand, but after three years of
this, you should know the deal, and
really, gatherings in public squares for
the purposes of celebration shouldn't
need to be prescribed by the adminis
tration anyway. Its kind of why public
squares exist in the first place. Either
way, you weren't there, and that was
super not cool.
The Band doesn't like to com
plain, what with being merry meisters
of musical mayhem and all, so I'm
going to do it for them. Most people
don't understand how much work
goes into being the LSJUMB, but it is
a great deal, and for Big Game Week
in particular. Big Game Week is filled
with rehearsals and rallies at the
expense of class time and one's better
judgment. All told, it added up to
around 28 hours of commitment this
year, and that's not even including
Saturday.
On Saturday, everyone wakes up
at 5 a.m. in order to be at Berkeley by
7:30. Afterward, most everyone
would like nothing more than to
enter a cryogenic chamber for three
years of recuperation, but instead, on
the occasions of a Big Game victory,
the Band saddles up for a rally
around campus that's supposed to
end with a massive convergence in
White Plaza: they do it all for you and
they are damn grateful for the oppor
tunity. It is, then, not the best feeling
in the world for them to discover that

they are playing to no one, especially
since you clearly heard them, because
they are very hard to ignore. And if
you, the reader, might be so inclined
as to write this grievance off as #first
worldproblems, I would just suggest
that it is highly impolite to criticize
the people that play music for you,
especially when they do it for free.
In many ways, this is not a new
trend. The phenomenon of the Band
playing to a nonexistent student body
is nothing new, and student enthusi
asm for football will never reach the
level it did back when they allowed
beer in the stadium, but this is a facile
analysis. Five years ago, when
Stanford beat USC as 42-point under
dogs, there was a bonfire in the mid
dle of the Quad. Later that year, when
Stanford won Big Game against all
odds, the student body turned out.
Any essentialist argument about the
apathy of Stanford fans is just straight
up wrong (like all essentialist argu
ments, really). Maybe success has
made you complacent. Maybe it's
been too long since the bad old days
for you to truly understand how lucky
you are. No matter the cause, it is a
problem that needs to be addressed.
That rally around campus five
years ago when I was a wee freshman
is one of my most bliss-filled memo
ries. I would like nothing more than
to see it repeated, but this isn't about
me. If you really do love Stanford in
that classic collegiate sense, if you
really do believe that the Band is the
embodiment of the spirit of Stanford,
then you should, you know, act like it
when celebration is warranted, and
winning Big Game always warrants a

celebration. Certainly there are opti
mal and suboptimal ways to channel
and express one's fandom, and I even
welcome a debate as to whether or
not college football should even exist
as an institution (though I doubt
many of you were staying home out
of protest), but asking people to party
together for 30 minutes in one place
on a Saturday night is not that out
landish a request.
