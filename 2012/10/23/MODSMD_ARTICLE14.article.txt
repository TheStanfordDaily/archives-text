# Victims of Comfort
## 
### Chris Herries 
Making friends has always
been hard for me. That is, of
course, a symptom of my per
sonality, not some commentary on
society being closed or judgemental. I
am not an easy person to get along
with, my humor is coarse and my
tastes are different, to say the least. I
went through freshman year getting
close to one, maybe two people,
thinking that would suffice. I never
had a group of people I went to par
ties with, I chose not to go to team
events, and I failed to properly seek
out friends in other areas. Frankly, I

am great at talking to strangers, ask
ing questions and getting to know
people, but that has never amounted
to even a casual friendship. Coming
into sophomore year I wasn't worried
about making friends or keeping old
ones. I figured if I made time for new
people and invited them places,
they'd reciprocate.
I was wrong.
Now this could simply be my expe
rience; I have never claimed to speak
for anyone other than myself. It could
be because I am a little bit older, or a
little more morose than others, but I
don't think so. My belief is that sopho
mores are not too keen on making
time for new people on a genuine level,
and we all know there is a limit to how
many times you can put yourself out on
the line for someone. It is a symptom of
the tranquility of routine, the love of
repetition and a desire to do what one
is comfortable with. Although I pride
myself on trying to meet new people
and broaden my horizons, I imagine I
fall short on many occasions. We are all
victims of comfort.
One of my goals for the quarter is
simple: Look at the Stanford events
calendar and attend two events a
week. They could be games, art
exhibits, lectures, concerts, etc. I choose
two and I invite someone I want to get
to know better. Sadly, only one person
has ever chosen to go with me out of
nearly a dozen invitations. Now this
isn't some maudlin cry for help or
some profession of deep loneliness
I cherish the time to introspect
rather it is a comment on our lives. Are
you so busy that two hours cannot be

spared to get to know someone new?
Or, more importantly, to get to know
someone you thought you knew? My
one friend and I agreed that, if we are
not available for each at least once a
week, than our lives are screwed up.
I firmly believe that you can never
have trouble prioritizing you just
prioritize. You pick certain aspects of
your life and make them more impor
tant than others.
I'm not in the business of criticizing
someone's priorities, but I am in the
business of reflection. Make sure your
priorities are what you want them to
be and not what you think they should
be. Be able to live with the decisions
you make because in the end, you will
have to. When I set out goals for the
quarter they are not garbage goals like
"get straight A's." They're things that
are genuinely important to me, like
"make at least two new friends," "find
a new favorite book," "work on my
power cleans," "visit the cactus gar
den" and "make time for people
whether or not it is convenient for
me."
I ran into someone from my dorm
at the Axe and Palm earlier this
month. She had expressed the same
friend-finding disillusionment I had.
However, she had been a little more
proactive. She said she was joining
new student groups and taking fewer
classes in order to find her niche on
campus. She knows what she wants,
and she is trying to find it. She is
someone we can all respect.
