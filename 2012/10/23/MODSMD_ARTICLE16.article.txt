## Show the Bears some love 
### Tom Taylor 
Sorry Cal, but try as you
might, I just can't find it in
me to really hate you. The
truth of the matter is that the
Stanford-Berkeley rivalry is
felt far more strongly across on your
side of the Bay. Students here on the
Farm are far more irreverent and
relaxed about this whole thing.

Take the Band. What makes the
LSJUMB so great is that it is so idio
syncratically Stanford. Few, even
among the student section, really get
the Band's jokes or have much idea
about what its members are doing out
there. But not only does that not mat
ter, it is really a key part of what makes
the Band great.
Unlike most college marching
bands, Stanford's lacks any kind of
military discipline. It has infuriated
and upset the powers that be across
this great nation, from the University
of Notre Dame to ESPN and the
entire state of Oregon. Why? Because
it felt the need to show off Stanford's
superiority? No. Really because it just
seemed funny at the time.

One of the Band's most famous
moments was "The Play," when it
rushed the field and inadvertently
turned victory into defeat for the
Cardinal. On Saturday, at every break
in play, the announcers at Memorial
Stadium delightfully reminded every
one that this year was the 30th
anniversary of perhaps the most
bizarre ending of a college football
game ever. We heard from commenta
tors and Cal teammates who had wit
nessed or been part of the game, but
glaringly absent were any of the key
players who had gifted Berkeley that
win.

From a Stanford perspective that
was a shame. It might seem odd to
you, but the Band's accidental treach
ery is one of my favorite anecdotes
from Cardinal history. It's a lasting
episode that defies the seriousness
with which many take these intercol
legiate rivalries.
The truth is, I have never really
found it in my heart to hate California.
Of course it feels good to beat the
Bears, but it just generally feels good
to beat anyone. I also have a lot of
friends who went to school across the
Bay and, being a much bigger univer
sity than Stanford, we are pretty much
surrounded by Berkeley alumni in the
Bay Area.
Cal has never truly hurt me per
sonally, and beyond a feeling of alle
giance to the place I have enjoyed call
ing home for the last few years, it is
easy to feel a soft spot for our nearby
cousins. To feel a sense of NorCal
brotherhood.

For whatever reason it might be,
many Berkeley students really don't
like us. Perhaps it is because of the per
ceived slights from Stanford students
chanting "safety school" or the percep
tion of the entitlement of students
here. Both are undeseiving reasons for
hatred. Stanford and UC-Berkeley are
clearly two of the top schools in the
entire world U.S. News has them
ranked 11th and 21st, respectively.
I've had my skirmishes with Cal
fans in the past, besides the now infa
mous exploits of Ink Bowls past. Last
year, on the way down to see Stanford
defeat USC in the Los Angeles
Coliseum I walked unsuspectingly into
an In-N-Out restaurant heav
ing with students wearing blue
and gold, on their way to watch
their own team face UCLA;
never did I think wearing a red
shirt would get me so much
attention.

Caught in the moment, the
atmosphere felt edgy or at
least as edgy as you can get
with college students; this isn't
European soccer after all
and while a handful were will
ing to cross the divide and chat
to me, there was a general feel
ing of a standoff.
There is nothing like being
outnumbered by an opposing
team's fans to inspire dark
thoughts. To want to see

Berkeley defeated, humiliated,
to see the Golden Bears suffer.
To see its fans deserting their
team and streaming out of the
stadium with a large part of the
contest still to run. When you
are suddenly the minority in a
crowd of blue and gold it is
easy to want to close ranks.
When you begin to notice the
obvious bias of the stadium
announcers something that
just never seems to quite so
blatant at home you pray
for their embarrassment.
But in the cold light of day,
far from the antagonism of a
football stadium, it is hard to
hate your neighbors.
