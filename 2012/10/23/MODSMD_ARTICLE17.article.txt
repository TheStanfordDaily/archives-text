# SENIOR NIGHT
## FIELD HOCKEY TO HOST HOME SEASON FINALE 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Tonight the Stanford field hockey team will fin
ish off its regular season schedule by hosting archri
val California on Senior Night.
The No. 14 Cardinal (11-6, 5-0 NorPac) swept
both the University of the Pacific and UC-Davis
over the weekend to seal its fourth consecutive
NorPac West Division regular season championship
and will wait for next week's NorPac Tournament to
return to action after tonight's game. Berkeley (5-
10,1-3 NorPac) meanwhile enters this contest on a
streak of three straight defeats and with just two
wins out of eight road games this season.
Last Friday the Cardinal out-shot the Tigers 32-
5 to win 5-1 at home and make it 13 consecutive
wins against Pacific.
Although Stanford freshman midfielder Maddie
Secco opened the scoring ten minutes in, the Tigers
did not back down and attacker Melissa Maultsby
curled a shot past the Cardinal defenders to draw
level just four minutes later. Flowever, the tie was
short-lived and sophomore midfielder Alex
McCawley quickly put the Card back in front to
stay.
In the second half, senior defender Becky Dru,
senior attacker Emily Henriksson and senior
attacker Katie Mitchell each added a goal to put the
game firmly out of Pacific's reach Dru's penalty
shot was the 50th goal of the All-American's colle
giate career.
Then on Saturday in Davis, Calif., Stanford
secured the conference West Division title with a 4-
2 defeat of the home team.
It was a closer ordeal than Friday's contest, with
Stanford holding narrow leads on shots (9-7) and
penalty corners (5-3). By the half, goals from fresh
man attacker Lauren Becker and sophomore mid
fielder Shannon Herold had given the Cardinal a 2-
0 lead, but early in the second period senior attack
er Nadia Namdari got one back for the Aggies and

tightened things once again.
When Becker struck again sixteen minutes later,
the Aggies were once again up to the task and UC-
Davis midfielder Jamie Garcia narrowed the gap
back down to shortly after. Dru found the cage
three minutes before full-time, however, for the
final nail on the coffin.
Tonight's game against California will be Senior
Night for six members of the Stanford team: Dru,
Henriksson, attacker Kelsey Lloyd, Mitchell, mid
fielder Colleen Ryan and midfielder Alysha
Sekhon. Their four years on the Farm rank as the
best in the field hockey program's history, including
four NorPac regular season titles, two NorPac
Tournament titles and three NCAA Tournament
appearances.
In her time on the Farm, Dru also received Ail-
American and NorPac Player of the Year honors in
2011 and was named NorPac Defensive Player of
the Year in 2010 and 2011 and Rookie of the Year
in 2009.
Recent history against Berkeley has the
Cardinal winning ten out of the last 14 meetings, a
complete reversal of an 18-game winning streak
held by the Golden Bears prior to the 2007 NorPac
Tournament title game.
The relatively close rivalry of the last few years,

in which the last six NorPac Championships have
seen the two schools meet in the title game, has
been subdued this year, with California absent from
the list of the nation's top-25 schools.
The Cardinal, however, lost last season's NorPac
Tournament to the Bears and would be wise to be
wary of its biggest collegiate rival.
Sophomore attacker Lara Kruggel leads
California with 15 goals, notably ahead of Dru's
nine, but while Stanford can count on significant
contributions from elsewhere on the field, including
junior attacker Courtney Haldeman and her eight
tallies, Kruggel is the lone goal-scoring standout for
the Bears.
The statistics on assists hint at a similar story,
Stanford having totaled up 44 so far this year to
California's 21.
Stanford will start its campaign in the NorPac
Tournament on Thursday Nov. 1 in Farmville, Va., at
Longwood University. It is set to play the fourth
place team from the East Division, a spot currently
occupied by Radford University.
The contest between Stanford and California
tonight will be televised live on the Pac-12
Networks from the Varsity Turf at 7 p.m.
