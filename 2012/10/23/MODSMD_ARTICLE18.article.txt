# Card sees red yet again
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING WRITER 
In what amounted to a near carbon copy of
last weekend's result, Stanford's men's soccer
team conceded a late goal to Washington and
couldn't find the equalizer in a somewhat sloppy
and very physical 2-1 loss to the Huskies.
With the victory, Washington (10-3-3, 5-0-2
Pac-12) cemented its spot atop the Pac-12 stand
ings, and sent the Cardinal (6-7-1, 3-3-1) to a
defeat it could ill afford to take.

It was clear from the beginning of the game
that Stanford was determined to be the aggres
sor on offense and dictate the tempo. The
Cardinal kept the pace of the game high and
pressed the Huskies even higher.
Much of head coach Jeremy Gunn's game
plan seemed designed to counteract the result of
last weekend's loss on the road against
Washington, when the Huskies slowed the pace
of the game to a crawl and hard fouls and yellow
cards were abundant.
An early red card to freshman defender
Brandon Vincent in that game forced Stanford
to play down a man for the entire second half
and it ultimately led to the breakdowns that gave
Washington the 2-0 victory.
Gunn tried hard to ensure that Sunday's
encounter would not follow a similar path, and in

the early going things were certainly looking up.
Eric Anderson stepped up on his Senior Day,
working a nice run down the right sideline in the
22nd minute and crossing the ball to Adam Jahn
on the near post. Washington goalie Spencer
Richey raced out to try and block Jahn, but the
ball slipped past Jahn with just a slight touch and
fell to Zach Batteer all alone in front of the goal.

A strong start from junior J.J. Koval and the
Cardinal midfield led to an early lead for
Stanford, but Washington found an equalizer and scored again late in a 2-1 victory
that was marred by fouls.
The sophomore forward easily
passed the ball into the net for his
fifth goal in the last six games.
"It was a good goal," Gunn said.
"We want Eric to beat players and
get crosses off, so he's done that
well, and Zach got in and scored
again. It was a great goal and we
managed to take the initiative and
we just needed to be able to consol
idate that."

But as the game got more and
more physical, the tempo began to
slow and the referee had trouble get
ting things under control. The
Huskies took advantage of the slow
er tempo to take more touches on
the ball and finally broke through on
one their only dangerous chances of
the half in the 36th minute.

Washington senior Patrick
Pacheco made a very nice run
down the left side and sent a good
cross toward goal that James
Moberg nodded past Stanford
goalie Drew Hutchins.
While disappointed, Gunn
noted that at that point in the game,
Stanford was still controlling play.
"I thought we played great," he
said. "We gave away one early
chance then after that I really felt
we passed the ball well, we were
very much the better team. The way
we were playing we were always
looking dangerous."
But just seven minutes later
and two minutes before halftime
another Cardinal freshman was
goaded into a silly foul that cost

Stanford dearly. Midfielder Ty
Thompson became entangled with
Moberg near the sideline but off
the ball, eventually throwing a
vicious elbow that connected with
Moberg's chest and brought an
immediate red card from the refer
ee, remarkably the third straight
game in which the Fluskies' oppo
nent has had a player sent off.
Down to 10 men, Stanford man
aged to maintain its composure
early on in the second half, and cre
ated several scoring chances.
Flowever, the man-advantage once
again paid dividends in the long run
for Washington.
Moberg found Nate Sackeyfio
down the left side in the 71st
minute and the forward ripped a
shot to the near post that Flutchins
was hopeless to reach.
The Cardinal pressed desper
ately after that, nearly scratching
out an equalizer a few minutes later
on a bouncing ball in the box and
earning several dangerous corner
kicks that forced the Huskies into
some frantic defending.
The game went down to the final
seconds, literally, as Sackeyfio
picked up the game's seventh yellow
card for stalling with four seconds to
play, and the Cardinal had one last

chance with a free kick from 40-
yards out. The volley was cleared
wide and Stanford fell once again.
"In soccer you look at the
results and it comes down to goals
scored, but we dominated the play,
dominated the game, we just could
n't quite get that goal we needed,"
Gunn said. "A couple of those
chances were those where you just
couldn't figure out how they didn't
go in. I'm just really proud of the
way the boys played and the way
they kept going. We were the fresh
er team, the fitter team, the
stronger team and we always
looked like the team that was going
to score. But they took what few
opportunities they had and mean
while we kept banging on the door
and couldn't get in."
The loss puts a lot of pressure
on Stanford this weekend when the
team takes on No. 16 UC-Santa
Barbara on the road. Sitting in third
place in the Pac-12 standings
behind No. 7 UCLA and the
Huskies, the Cardinal needs to
boost its resume and likely win out
in its remaining conference matches
to reach the NCAA Tournament.
