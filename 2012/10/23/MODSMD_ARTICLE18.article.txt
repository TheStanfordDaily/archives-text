# Card sees red yet again
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING WRITER 
In what amounted to a near carbon copy of
last weekend's result, Stanford's men's soccer
team conceded a late goal to Washington and
couldn't find the equalizer in a somewhat sloppy
and very physical 2-1 loss to the Huskies.
With the victory, Washington (10-3-3, 5-0-2
Pac-12) cemented its spot atop the Pac-12 stand
ings, and sent the Cardinal (6-7-1, 3-3-1) to a
defeat it could ill afford to take.

10/22, Laird Q. Cagan Stadium

It was clear from the beginning of the game
that Stanford was determined to be the aggres
sor on offense and dictate the tempo. The
Cardinal kept the pace of the game high and
pressed the Huskies even higher.
Much of head coach Jeremy Gunn's game
plan seemed designed to counteract the result of
last weekend's loss on the road against
Washington, when the Huskies slowed the pace
of the game to a crawl and hard fouls and yellow
cards were abundant.
An early red card to freshman defender
Brandon Vincent in that game forced Stanford
to play down a man for the entire second half
and it ultimately led to the breakdowns that gave
Washington the 2-0 victory.
Gunn tried hard to ensure that Sunday's
encounter would not follow a similar path, and in

the early going things were certainly looking up.
Eric Anderson stepped up on his Senior Day,
working a nice run down the right sideline in the
22nd minute and crossing the ball to Adam Jahn
on the near post. Washington goalie Spencer
Richey raced out to try and block Jahn, but the
ball slipped past Jahn with just a slight touch and
fell to Zach Batteer all alone in front of the goal.

A strong start from junior J.J. Koval and the
Cardinal midfield led to an early lead for
Stanford, but Washington found an equalizer and scored again late in a 2-1 victory
that was marred by fouls.
