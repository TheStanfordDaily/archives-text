## Quick out of the blocks STANFORD SWEEPS DAY TWO OF PACIFIC INVITE 
### RYAN HOAGLUND 
The Cardinal delivered a dominating performance
in its first meet of the season, coming out of the Pacific
Invite in Stockton, Calif., with a sweep of all of the
day's nine events. Despite only participating in day two
of the meet, Stanford racked up enough points to place
second with 1,063 points, finishing just 16 points shy of
the meet's host, University of the Pacific (1,079).
The performance is just what the new coaching
staff, headed by long-time assistant Ted Knapp, was
looking for. "All in all, it was very encouraging for this
time of year considering the workload the team is
dealing with," Knapp said. "The performances by our
relays were indicative of a great team attitude."
The Cardinal set the tone for the rest of the meet,
taking first, second and third in the 200 freestyle relay.
The A squad, composed of Aaron Wayne, Ben Lovefi,
Jeff Gamier and Jack Lane, took first with a time of
1:23.10, out-touching the B squad (Andrew Saeta,
Sean Duggan, Cole Davis and Christian Brown) by
just over four tenths of a second.
Freshman Gray Umbach (1:48.58) kept up the
momentum with a win in the 200 butterfly, leading
Stanford's sweep of the first seven spots in the event.
Umbach would go on to finish his first collegiate meet
in impressive fashion, posting a time of 49.07 to nar-
rowly beat out fellow freshman
Tom Kremer (49.70) in the 100
fly-
Despite losing several of its
top swimmers in the freestyle
events in last year's graduating
class, the Cardinal proved it had
the depth to fill the gaps, taking
the first nine spots in the 100
freestyle. Senior Wayne (43.65)
led the way, followed by class
mate Satae (44.60) and freshman
Duggan (45.57). The same would
prove true in the 500 freestyle,
with sophomore David Nolan
(4:24.50) and freshman Danny
Thompson (4:26.68) leading a
sweep of the first 11 places.
Stanford would continue to

control the meet, moving into
the 200 individual medley.
Sophomore Jack Lane (1:50.88)
won the event, beating
Thompson (1:50.97) to the wall
by just nine hundredths of a sec
ond. After Matt Thompson,
seven more Stanford swimmers
would finish before the first
competitor from other schools.

The 200 backstroke was the
same story as Matt Thompson
(1:46.03) and Matthew Swantson
(1:46.99) finished within a second
of each other for the top two
positions. In yet another sweep,
five of Stanford's six swimmers
competing in the event were
unbeaten by the opposing teams.

Junior Mason Shaw
(2:01.91) won the 200 breast
stroke relatively comfortably. A
nearly four-second margin sepa
rated him from classmate Will
Gunderson in second place

(2:05.57).
The Cardinal didn't let up
going into the final event, the
800 freestyle relay. Robert
Hummel, David Nolan, Chris
Kckard and Thomas Stephens
formed the winning squad with
a time of 6:33.54, followed by
three other Stanford teams.
Despite Stanford's unmatched
success on day two, it was not
quite enough to win as the
meet's host, University of the
Pacific, had amassed enough
points on day one to hold on by
16 points.
Next up for the Cardinal is
Friday's home dual meet against
the University of Wisconsin. The
team will look to build off this past
weekend's momentum as it
moves into the dual meet season.
