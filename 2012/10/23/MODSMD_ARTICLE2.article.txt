## UVote registers fewer students, centralizes registration 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Stanford's pilot partnership with UVote, a voter registra
tion program created at Northwestern University, registered
786 students and faculty to vote this year. The California
voter registration deadline passed on Oct. 22.
The new voter registration program replaced less cen
tralized student group efforts from past years, but did not
register as many voters.
According to Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of the
Stanford Democrats, one of the most effective methods
used in past years was having "dorm captains" in each resi
dence responsible for asking students if they were registered
to vote. Lamont estimates that approximately 1,000 stu
dents registered to vote in each of the 2008 and 2010 elec
tion seasons.
Sixty-six percent of new voters at Stanford this year reg
istered to vote in California. UVote staff also helped out-of
state students fill out absentee ballot requests and mailed
these forms when possible.
"UVote was less effective in terms of total number of stu
dents registered," Lamont said. "But it was much more effec
tive in giving students the opportunity to register to vote out of
state and helping them request absentee ballots."
Tom Schnaubelt, executive director of the Haas Center,
was approached by the Northwestern University's Center
for Civic Engagement about the possibility of launching
UVote at Stanford. Schnaubelt agreed after hearing about

the program's success rate at Northwestern, where 90 per
cent of the incoming freshman class registered to vote in the
program's pilot year.
At Northwestern, every freshman had to go through a
UVote station during university registration. UVote volun
teers at Stanford set up tables at the fall activities fair, the
Haas Center's public service open house and in dining halls
and near bike registration lines during New Student
Orientation to target freshmen. However, only 320 of
Stanford's UVote registrees were freshmen, according to
Haas Center executive assistant Maria Fraboni.
"It was a little hard coming off the Northwestern plan,"
Lamont said. "We just didn't have that type of administra
tive support."
Along with Northwestern and Stanford, six other col
leges partnered with UVote this year. Stanford is the only
school on the West Coast to partner with UVote the
other universities are located in Illinois, Virginia and
Missouri.
Voter registration at colleges has become increasingly
popular as campaigns target young voters. According to the
Center for Information and Research and Engagement at
Tufts University, there are approximately 11 million college
students between the ages of 18 and 24 who can vote in the
2012 presidential election, and 16.8 million young people
who were not eligible to vote in the 2008 election can vote

this year.
According to an Oct. 13 article in
The New York Times, more than 60
colleges across the country now offer
voter registration programs. Some uni
versities, such as Harvard, use
Internet-based programs like
Turbo Vote.
"A lot of the research shows that if it
is web-based, saying, 'Go here to regis
ter to vote,' people don't end up doing
it," Schnaubelt said. "The way that
UVote works is that all of the materials
are right there. You fill it out and in the
cases that we can, we mail it."
Although Stanford's pilot program
with UVote was not as successful as
Northwestern's, Schnaubelt believes
his goal of 100 percent registration of
the incoming class can be achieved
with better planning. The Haas Center
and ResEd are currently in discussion
about partnering with UVote next
year to bring the drive into students'
living spaces.
Schnaubelt also has a number of
ideas to improve the program.
"We would rather just have one
location where we know all frosh are
going to actually go by at one point
and take advantage of that line,"
Schnaubelt said. "The biggest amount
of the work besides doing the process
ing was taking all of the stuff to all of
the locations."
Lamont, who managed a UVote
site near bike registration, said that
although students were "fairly recep
tive" to UVote, she is not convinced
that Stanford should rely solely on
UVote next year.
"It's too easy for students to walk
by a table and say, 'Oh, I'll do it next
time,' and later forget," Lamont said.
"Making it as easy as possible through
online registration or having a UVote
box in the dorm would probably be the
best way to do it."

of the work besides doing the process
ing was taking all of the stuff to all of
the locations."
Lamont, who managed a UVote
site near bike registration, said that
although students were "fairly recep
tive" to UVote, she is not convinced
that Stanford should rely solely on
UVote next year.
"It's too easy for students to walk
by a table and say, 'Oh, I'll do it next
time,' and later forget," Lamont said.
"Making it as easy as possible through
online registration or having a UVote
box in the dorm would probably be the
best way to do it."

Stanford's pilot partnership with UVote, a voter registra
tion program created at Northwestern University, registered
786 students and faculty to vote this year. The California
voter registration deadline passed on Oct. 22.
The new voter registration program replaced less cen
tralized student group efforts from past years, but did not
register as many voters.
According to Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of the
Stanford Democrats, one of the most effective methods
used in past years was having "dorm captains" in each resi
dence responsible for asking students if they were registered
to vote. Lamont estimates that approximately 1,000 stu
dents registered to vote in each of the 2008 and 2010 elec
tion seasons.
Sixty-six percent of new voters at Stanford this year reg
istered to vote in California. UVote staff also helped out-of
state students fill out absentee ballot requests and mailed
these forms when possible.
"UVote was less effective in terms of total number of stu
dents registered," Lamont said. "But it was much more effec
tive in giving students the opportunity to register to vote out of
state and helping them request absentee ballots."
Tom Schnaubelt, executive director of the Haas Center,
was approached by the Northwestern University's Center
for Civic Engagement about the possibility of launching
UVote at Stanford. Schnaubelt agreed after hearing about

the program's success rate at Northwestern, where 90 per
cent of the incoming freshman class registered to vote in the
program's pilot year.
At Northwestern, every freshman had to go through a
UVote station during university registration. UVote volun
teers at Stanford set up tables at the fall activities fair, the
Haas Center's public service open house and in dining halls
and near bike registration lines during New Student
Orientation to target freshmen. However, only 320 of
Stanford's UVote registrees were freshmen, according to
Haas Center executive assistant Maria Fraboni.
"It was a little hard coming off the Northwestern plan,"
Lamont said. "We just didn't have that type of administra
tive support."
Along with Northwestern and Stanford, six other col
leges partnered with UVote this year. Stanford is the only
school on the West Coast to partner with UVote the
other universities are located in Illinois, Virginia and
Missouri.
Voter registration at colleges has become increasingly
popular as campaigns target young voters. According to the
Center for Information and Research and Engagement at
Tufts University, there are approximately 11 million college
students between the ages of 18 and 24 who can vote in the
2012 presidential election, and 16.8 million young people
who were not eligible to vote in the 2008 election can vote

UVote, a voter registration system created at Northwestern University, provided a more centralized
method of registration on campus this year but the numbers failed to meet the last two election averages.
this year.
According to an Oct. 13 article in
The New York Times, more than 60
colleges across the country now offer
voter registration programs. Some uni
versities, such as Harvard, use
Internet-based programs like
Turbo Vote.
"A lot of the research shows that if it
is web-based, saying, 'Go here to regis
ter to vote,' people don't end up doing
it," Schnaubelt said. "The way that
UVote works is that all of the materials
are right there. You fill it out and in the
cases that we can, we mail it."
Although Stanford's pilot program
with UVote was not as successful as
Northwestern's, Schnaubelt believes
his goal of 100 percent registration of
the incoming class can be achieved
with better planning. The Haas Center
and ResEd are currently in discussion
about partnering with UVote next
year to bring the drive into students'
living spaces.
Schnaubelt also has a number of
ideas to improve the program.
"We would rather just have one
location where we know all frosh are
going to actually go by at one point
and take advantage of that line,"
Schnaubelt said. "The biggest amount
of the work besides doing the process
ing was taking all of the stuff to all of
the locations."
Lamont, who managed a UVote
site near bike registration, said that
