# Outside linebacker Trent Murphy named a semifinalist for Butkus Award
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Stanford senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy
was named one of the 12 semifinalists for the Butkus
Award on Monday by the Butkus Foundation. The
annual award goes to the top linebacker in college foot
ball.

Murphy has been a pass rushing force for the
Cardinal in 2012, leading the team with 4.5 sacks and
tying for the team lead with nine tackles for a loss. The
highlight of his season though was a 40-yard intercep
tion returned for a touchdown at Washington in
September. On the play, Murphy used all of his 6-foot
-6 frame to tap Keith Price's pass up to himself and then
outrun the Washington offense to the end zone.

On Nov. 20, the Butkus Foundation will narrow the
12 semifinalists down to a group of finalists, from which
it will announce the recipient on Dec. 4. The only other
semifinalist from the Pac-12 is Oregon linebacker Dion
Jordan.
