# INSTANT REPLAY Zach Ertz and the high-low read
## 
### â€“ Winston Shi 
In the 115 th Big Game on Saturday, California defensive coordinator
Clancy Pendergast drew up a very aggressive game plan to stop Stanford's
offense, Stanford responded by using Cal's aggressiveness against them sev
eral times throughout the game, including this 68-yard pass play to tight end
Zach Ertz.
Before the snap Stanford is in its power running set, with three tight ends
(X, Y and Z), a fullback (F) and a running back (R). In response, Cal lines up
in a 4-3 under formation, which means that in addition to the four linemen,
the strongside linebacker (S) moves to the line of scrimmage. The strong safe
ty ($) moves down from the middle of the field to occupy the spot left open
by the strongside linebacker. This formation is very effective against the run.
When tight end Zach Ertz (Z) moves from the backfield to a position
right next to Y, ostensibly to add another blocker at the line of scrimmage for
a power running play, Cal's free safety Josh Hill (F/S) moves closer to the line
of scrimmage, leaving the middle of the field wide open.

Since Stanford typically runs out of the power set, Cal sells out to stop the
run. Unbeknownst to Cal, Stanford actually intends to pass.
The main play is to attack the cornerback on the right side, Michael Lowe
(C), with a high-low combination. Ertz runs a 12-yard corner route above
Lowe, while fullback Ryan Hewitt (F) runs underneath him, putting Lowe in
a bind (shown in blue) with a difficult choice of whom to cover. The most
common high-low read is the smash concept, where the corner route is com
plemented by a short hitch route to the outside, but by varying the looks and
routes, Stanford manages to achieve the same effect while retaining the
advantage of surprise.
The other receivers, X and Y, run a deep post and a short hook, respective
ly the first to exploit the open hole in the middle of the field, and the sec
ond to provide an open receiver that Nunes can quickly throw to in case of
an all-out blitz. Running back Stepfan Taylor (R) checks for a blitz. If Cal
blitzes, he stays in pass protection, and if not, he runs a delayed route, giving
quarterback Josh Nunes (Q) another passing option.
Nunes fakes a handoff to Taylor and Cal immediately attacks the run,
sending eight men, including critically the strong safety. Taylor stays in
pass protection as a result and saves Nunes from nearly getting decapitated.
The deep post draws Hill's attention and he retreats to the middle of the field.
Lowe, expecting that Hill will cover Ertz, covers Hewitt on the underneath
route.
Nunes doesn't even have to look to his other receivers. With Ertz imme
diately open, Nunes throws the corner just 1.4 seconds after the snap, and
with over 70 yards of open space in front of him, Ertz catches the ball and
explodes for a massive gain.
Last week, Stanford ran the same play against Notre Dame and Ertz
picked up a 22-yard reception. Notre Dame plays an unusually conservative
scheme, however, and because of Cal's aggressiveness, Ertz covered over two
thirds of the field with just one catch, setting up an easy touchdown pass to
Levine Toilolo just two plays later.
