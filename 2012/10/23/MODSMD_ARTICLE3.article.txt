# ARP back under scrutiny
## Town hall meetings on sexual assault policy reform begin tonight 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU and the Office of
Community Standards (OCS) will host
two public town hall meetings on Oct.
23 and Oct. 24 to discuss the Alternative
Review Process (ARPj, the judicial
procedure for cases involving sexual
assault, stalking and relationship vio
lence.

The ARP was developed in April
2010 in response to data showing that
only three out of 104 cases of sexual
assault went to hearing between 1996
and 2009. In the two years since the
ARP's inception, 13 of 21 reported
cases went to trial. Since its implemen
tation, the ARP has been unilaterally
revised by the Office of the President
and extended through a clause in the
University's judicial charter granting
the president the right to enforce reg
ulations governing student conduct in
"extraordinary circumstances."
In April 2011, President Hennessey
changed the standard of proof to "pre
ponderance of evidence" from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" after the
Office of Civil Rights published the
Dear Colleague Letter, an interpreta
tion of federal anti-discrimination law
Title IX. His executive action also gave
both the responding and impacted stu
dent equal power of appeal.
Like all judicial proceedings on
campus, the ARP is under the authori
ty of the ASSU, of which all graduate
and undergraduate students are mem
bers. The ASSU bylaws delegate man
agement of judicial hearings to the
OCS, although the Undergraduate
Senate, the Graduate Student Council
and the President of the University
have maintained the power to over
rule any suggested policy of the OCS.

Office of the President
Because the ASSU Constitution
contains a clause on the rights of the
accused, namely the right "to be con
sidered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt," President

Hennessey's order would normally
violate students' rights as ensured by
the ASSU Constitution, a legally bind
ing contract between the University
and the student body.
At ASSU Senate meetings last
year, former President Michael Cruz
'l2 expressed concern that responding
students who are found responsible
under a standard of preponderance of
evidence may be able to sue the
University for breach of contract
because of this apparent contradiction.
According to Cruz, the ARP is
only legally legitimate by Hennessey's
authority to override his contractual
obligations to the ASSU. This primary
power comes from a clause in the
Judicial Charter of 1997, granting the
President the right to enforce regula
tions governing student conduct in
"extraordinary circumstances."
The ASSU
When it approved the ARP charter
in 2010, the Board on Judicial Affairs
emphasized "that [the ARP] is a pilot
program..." and wrote that it
"intends that the program will con
clude at the end of June 2012." Yet,
despite contentious debate from all
sides, the ARP continues today with
out any approval from the student
body.
In recent interviews, ASSU
President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 indi
cated that he expects the ARP to
remain in force until some replace
ment procedure is approved.
Although both the 13th and 14th
Graduate Student Councils and
Undergraduate Senates have engaged
in debate about the ARP, Zimbroff
reported in September that there has
been very little work toward a resolu
tion.
At their second-to-last meeting of
the 2011-12 academic year, the OCS
decided to organize a working group
over the summer under the direction
of Dean of Student Life Chris Griffith.
Zimbroff said that the group, consisting
of several ASSU representatives and
members of the OCS, met once this
summer to discuss mostly logistical
issues concerning how to engage stu
dents.
"There wasn't a whole lot of coordi
nated effort," he said.
At their Oct. 16 meeting, the
Undergraduate Senate decided to
delay ARP discussion until after this
week's town halls.
"I still think a lot of people including
myself still don't feel 100 percent com
fortable making a decision as big as
ARP knowing that it will affect many
people," Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5
said, "[But] it would be nice to come to
a conclusion and finally have some sort
of an endorsement from the Senate for
a particular way of handling the ARP."

ponderance of evidence" from
"beyond a reasonable doubt" after the
Office of Civil Rights published the
Dear Colleague Letter, an interpreta
tion of federal anti-discrimination law
Title IX. His executive action also gave
both the responding and impacted stu
dent equal power of appeal.
Like all judicial proceedings on
campus, the ARP is under the authori
ty of the ASSU, of which all graduate
and undergraduate students are mem
bers. The ASSU bylaws delegate man
agement of judicial hearings to the
OCS, although the Undergraduate
Senate, the Graduate Student Council
and the President of the University
have maintained the power to over
rule any suggested policy of the OCS.

Office of the President
Because the ASSU Constitution
contains a clause on the rights of the
accused, namely the right "to be con
sidered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt," President

Hennessey's order would normally
violate students' rights as ensured by
the ASSU Constitution, a legally bind
ing contract between the University
and the student body.
At ASSU Senate meetings last
year, former President Michael Cruz
'l2 expressed concern that responding
students who are found responsible
under a standard of preponderance of
evidence may be able to sue the
University for breach of contract
because of this apparent contradiction.
According to Cruz, the ARP is
only legally legitimate by Hennessey's
authority to override his contractual
obligations to the ASSU. This primary
power comes from a clause in the
Judicial Charter of 1997, granting the
President the right to enforce regula
tions governing student conduct in
"extraordinary circumstances."
The ASSU
When it approved the ARP charter
in 2010, the Board on Judicial Affairs
emphasized "that [the ARP] is a pilot
program..." and wrote that it
"intends that the program will con
clude at the end of June 2012." Yet,
despite contentious debate from all
sides, the ARP continues today with
out any approval from the student
body.
In recent interviews, ASSU
President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 indi
cated that he expects the ARP to
remain in force until some replace
ment procedure is approved.
Although both the 13th and 14th
Graduate Student Councils and
Undergraduate Senates have engaged
in debate about the ARP, Zimbroff
reported in September that there has
been very little work toward a resolu
tion.
At their second-to-last meeting of
the 2011-12 academic year, the OCS
decided to organize a working group
over the summer under the direction
of Dean of Student Life Chris Griffith.
Zimbroff said that the group, consisting
of several ASSU representatives and
members of the OCS, met once this
summer to discuss mostly logistical
issues concerning how to engage stu
dents.
"There wasn't a whole lot of coordi
nated effort," he said.
At their Oct. 16 meeting, the
Undergraduate Senate decided to
delay ARP discussion until after this
week's town halls.
"I still think a lot of people including
myself still don't feel 100 percent com
fortable making a decision as big as
ARP knowing that it will affect many
people," Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5
said, "[But] it would be nice to come to
a conclusion and finally have some sort
of an endorsement from the Senate for
a particular way of handling the ARP."
