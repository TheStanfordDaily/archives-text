## Pre-med advising disappoints 
### RAVALI REDDY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A quarter to a third of students in
every incoming class enter Stanford
with the intention of following a pre
medical track. Specialized advising
for these students is only offered
through three Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) pre
med advisers.
Students find that while UAR
premed advisers provide useful
resources for logistical questions,
their lack of personal experiences as
pre-med undergraduates is a setback.
"On an elementary level, [the
premed advisers] did a great job, but
they didn't help me become a com
petitive applicant," said Muthu
Alagappan 'l2, a first-year medical
student at the Stanford Medical
School.
Since Stanford does not offer a
pre-med major, students are required
to choose a major and complete its
requirements while also fulfilling pre
med curriculum requirements, includ
ing a full year each of general chem
istry, organic chemistry, physics and
biology, among others.
These students have the option of
working with a pre-med adviser in
addition to their pre-major or major
adviser and academic director.
UAR currently has two full-time
pre-med advisers and one part-time
adviser, who doubles as the primary
pre-law adviser, on staff.
"We help students deal with
scheduling, figuring out when's a
good time for them to take the
MCAT, whether they need to get
some clinical exposure, almost any
thing," said Yunny Yip, a UAR pre
med adviser who also serves as the
director of upper-division advising
and preprofessional programs.

About 300 to 400 Stanford stu
dents and recent alumni apply to
medical school every year and use
UAR advising services.
Yip also stated that while none of
the three pre-med advisers went to
medical school themselves, all three
have had preprofessional training
and attend pre-med-related confer
ences in order to ensure that they
know how to properly guide stu
dents.

"We're not going to be a physi
cian saying, 'This was my path and
this is what I did to get here,"' Yip
said. "But we have the professional
development and we've made con
nections with pre-med advisers
nationally, so we know what medical
schools are looking for."

Despite these resources, pre-med
students have expressed a desire to
have access to advisers who have
personal experience with medical
school.
"I do wish they had someone in
the medical school also advising
undergraduates," Monica Dey 'l5
said. "It would be nice to hear from
someone firsthand what kind of
things med schools are looking for."
Some pre-meds have also
expressed concerns regarding the
premed advisers' inability to answer
anything beyond logistical questions.
"It's much easier to shoot a text
to a friend that I know, rather than
schedule an appointment and have
to calculate what you say," Aishu
Venkataraman 'l4 said. "My ques
tions these days tend not to be about
the logistics of applying but about
personal experiences."
Among Venkataraman's ques
tions that the pre-med advisers were
unable to answer were such topics as,
"Do you think it's wise to be a resi
dent assistant in a freshman dorm
and study for the MCAT at the same
time?"
Even in the case of logistics, pre
med advisors are unable to directly
answer financial aid questions about
applying to medical school. Instead

premed advisors organize yearly
events where they bring in adminis
trative individuals from medical
schools to talk about financial aid,
Yin said.

For Judith Pelpola 'l5 this indi
rect assistance is not enough.
"I think it would help if [the
premed advisors] knew more about
financial aid or could point us in the
right direction and knew who we
could ask to get those questions
answered," Pelpola said.
Alagappan said that even when it
came to logistical concerns of apply
ing to medical school, he first had to
consult friends before approaching
his adviser. He recommends that
Stanford create a more structured
peer-mentoring program.
"I wish there was a stronger peer
mentoring program that was formalized,
mainly because those students are closer
in age to us and just went through the
process, so they know what works now as
opposed to having a theoretical sense of
application trends," he said.
An alternative for students seek
ing pre-med advice is the Stanford
Premedical Association (SPA) run
by Stanford School of Medicine fac
ulty. It organizes events such as pre
med ice cream socials, mock MCATs
and medical school admissions inter

views.
"The point of SPA is to help
bring premeds together and provide
them with the information and
resources that they need to be
informed, while also providing them
with away to socialize and remove
the stress from pre-med," said Kathy
Zabrocka an SPA board member.
While only SPA board members
meet regularly, the association hosts
events throughout the year while
staying in touch with students
through a Piazza forum, a regularly
updated website and a mailing list.
"Students have really appreciat
ed the weekly newsletter that SPA
emails out because it includes
research positions, volunteer oppor
tunities, jobs listings and other things
that can make being a pre-med easi
er," Zabrocka said.
While the UAR advisers recog
nize that students may look to alter
native means such as friends and the
SPA for more relatable advice, they
encourage students to build relation
ships with advisers.
"The more we get to know some
one, the better the advising is for
them," Yip said.

right direction and knew who we
could ask to get those questions
answered," Pelpola said.
Alagappan said that even when it
came to logistical concerns of apply
ing to medical school, he first had to
consult friends before approaching
his adviser. He recommends that
Stanford create a more structured
peer-mentoring program.
"I wish there was a stronger peer
mentoring program that was formalized,
mainly because those students are closer
in age to us and just went through the
process, so they know what works now as
opposed to having a theoretical sense of
application trends," he said.
An alternative for students seek
ing pre-med advice is the Stanford
Premedical Association (SPA) run
by Stanford School of Medicine fac
ulty. It organizes events such as pre
med ice cream socials, mock MCATs
and medical school admissions inter

views.
"The point of SPA is to help
bring premeds together and provide
them with the information and
resources that they need to be
informed, while also providing them
with away to socialize and remove
the stress from pre-med," said Kathy
Zabrocka an SPA board member.
While only SPA board members
meet regularly, the association hosts
events throughout the year while
staying in touch with students
through a Piazza forum, a regularly
updated website and a mailing list.
"Students have really appreciat
ed the weekly newsletter that SPA
emails out because it includes
research positions, volunteer oppor
tunities, jobs listings and other things
that can make being a pre-med easi
er," Zabrocka said.
While the UAR advisers recog
nize that students may look to alter
native means such as friends and the
SPA for more relatable advice, they
encourage students to build relation
ships with advisers.
"The more we get to know some
one, the better the advising is for
them," Yip said.

A quarter to a third of students in
every incoming class enter Stanford
with the intention of following a pre
medical track. Specialized advising
for these students is only offered
through three Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR) pre
med advisers.
Students find that while UAR
premed advisers provide useful
resources for logistical questions,
their lack of personal experiences as
pre-med undergraduates is a setback.
"On an elementary level, [the
premed advisers] did a great job, but
they didn't help me become a com
petitive applicant," said Muthu
Alagappan 'l2, a first-year medical
student at the Stanford Medical
School.
Since Stanford does not offer a
pre-med major, students are required
to choose a major and complete its
requirements while also fulfilling pre
med curriculum requirements, includ
ing a full year each of general chem
istry, organic chemistry, physics and
biology, among others.
These students have the option of
working with a pre-med adviser in
addition to their pre-major or major
adviser and academic director.
UAR currently has two full-time
pre-med advisers and one part-time
adviser, who doubles as the primary
pre-law adviser, on staff.
"We help students deal with
scheduling, figuring out when's a
good time for them to take the
MCAT, whether they need to get
some clinical exposure, almost any
thing," said Yunny Yip, a UAR pre
med adviser who also serves as the
director of upper-division advising
and preprofessional programs.

About 300 to 400 Stanford stu
dents and recent alumni apply to
medical school every year and use
UAR advising services.
Yip also stated that while none of
the three pre-med advisers went to
medical school themselves, all three
have had preprofessional training
and attend pre-med-related confer
ences in order to ensure that they
know how to properly guide stu
dents.

"We're not going to be a physi
cian saying, 'This was my path and
this is what I did to get here,"' Yip
said. "But we have the professional
development and we've made con
nections with pre-med advisers
nationally, so we know what medical
schools are looking for."

Despite these resources, pre-med
students have expressed a desire to
have access to advisers who have
personal experience with medical
school.
"I do wish they had someone in
the medical school also advising
undergraduates," Monica Dey 'l5
said. "It would be nice to hear from
someone firsthand what kind of
things med schools are looking for."
Some pre-meds have also
expressed concerns regarding the
premed advisers' inability to answer
anything beyond logistical questions.
"It's much easier to shoot a text
to a friend that I know, rather than
schedule an appointment and have
to calculate what you say," Aishu
Venkataraman 'l4 said. "My ques
tions these days tend not to be about
the logistics of applying but about
personal experiences."
Among Venkataraman's ques
tions that the pre-med advisers were
unable to answer were such topics as,
"Do you think it's wise to be a resi
dent assistant in a freshman dorm
and study for the MCAT at the same
time?"
Even in the case of logistics, pre
med advisors are unable to directly
answer financial aid questions about
applying to medical school. Instead

premed advisors organize yearly
events where they bring in adminis
trative individuals from medical
schools to talk about financial aid,
Yin said.

For Judith Pelpola 'l5 this indi
rect assistance is not enough.
"I think it would help if [the
premed advisors] knew more about
financial aid or could point us in the
right direction and knew who we
could ask to get those questions
answered," Pelpola said.
