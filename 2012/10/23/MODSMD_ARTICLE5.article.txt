## STUDENT GROUPS Senate to fund new traditions 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
This year's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
plans to use the remaining $743 in its $13,000
traditions fund to sponsor new traditions, a
change from last year when the fund's leftover
money was allocated to one-time events and a
student group.

The idea of the traditions fund was first pro
posed by former Senator Alex Katz 'l2 in May
2010. The fund was created in 2010, and has held
between $12,500 and $14,500 each year since.
Unused money in the traditions fund is auto
matically transferred to the endowment fund at
the end of the year.

"The official purpose of the traditions fund
is to preserve traditional campus-wide Stanford
events that may be at risk of underfunding,"
said Appropriations Committee Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4. "The traditions fund's top priorities
are Mausoleum and Full Moon on the Quad
(FMOTQ), although there is a pot for other
emergency expenses."

The Senate allocated $6,500 from the fund
to FMOTQ and will vote to approve $5,257 for
this Friday's Mausoleum party at its Oct. 23
meeting. The lack of guidelines concerning the
fund means the remaining money can be used
at the discretion of the Senate. In the past, sen-

ators have drawn from the traditions
fund in winter and spring quarters for
a variety of purposes.
"We don't just want the money to
sit there and not get used, so a lot of
times people might tap into [the
fund] to help out the junior and soph
omore class presidents, since they
don't get a lot of funding to begin
with," said Senate Chair Branden
Crouch 'l4.
Last year, senators used $1,400
from the traditions fund to transport
students to the USC football game

and $3OO for a junior class gathering.
After learning that they still had $6OO
left in the fund in April, senators
voted to allocate the money to the
Product Design Association.
The process of obtaining tradi
tions fund money is similar to other
funding requests, though these
requests are submitted by email
instead of through the MyGroups2
program. Pham said that while a typ
ical group requesting funding has to
meet with the Appropriations
Committee, the "main correspon
dence" regarding a traditions funds
request occurs online.
According to Pham, a group
requesting traditions fund money
specifically asks for these funds, and
the Senate has not yet independently

proposed spending traditions fund
money for an event. Both types of
funding require the creation of a bill
that the Senate has to approve.
At their Oct. 2 meeting, the
Senate voted to allocate $5OO from
the fund to a football game viewing
party in front of the Sigma Nu fra
ternity that was sponsored by the
senior class. Though some senators
were initially concerned about
using traditions fund money for the
event, they unanimously voted in
favor of the funding bill after two
senior class presidents attended a
Senate meeting and announced their
intent to make the event a new tradi
tion.

"They want to do that every year
for people who can't make it to the

faraway games or don't feel like
going to the game," Crouch said.
"That is an event that should be com
ing back next year and the year after
and the year after."
Though Crouch does not know
what other new events will be sup
ported using the remaining money in
the fund, he believes that it will be
"used to the fullest."
"When you say 'traditions,' there
are questions about what counts as a
tradition," he said. "How you are
making decisions about the money is
a big deal, and we will have discus
sions about that as the year pro
gresses."
