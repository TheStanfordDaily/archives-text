## Course Work alternatives focus on social New course management systems try to challenge Course Work's dominance 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This article is the second of two on Stanford's
course management software. The first part
addressed criticisms of Stanford's most popular sys
tem, Course Work.
While Course Work, Stanford's centrally sup
ported and oft-criticized class management system,
remains the dominant platform among Stanford
users, The Daily recently took a look at some of the
many ventures seeking to complement or replace
it.
InYourClass
Developed by four Albanian immigrants who
met at The City College of New York, InYourClass
which adds a social element to more traditional
course management platforms has enjoyed
remarkable success in less than three years of oper
ation. It currently boasts 480,000 students of the
City University of New York system and has
undergone trials at Stanford.
Arber Ruci, InYourClass's founder, framed the
platform's positive reception as reflective of
InYourClass's ability to address the desires of actu
al platforms users students and incorporate a
number of different functions under one system.
"We really want to slap everyone in the face
who had ever created a [learning management sys
tem] ... because they're awful," Ruci said. "When
we call [lnYourClass] that, we're simply going after
the idea that everything out there kind of sucks."
According to Ruci, the platform's effort to
bridge the gap between students' social and educa-
tional lives has resulted in page
views per user much higher than
other platforms.
Ruci and his colleagues are cur
rently working on applying
InYourClass to a Stanford audience
a rare positive legacy of the
University's failed bid for a New
York City campus made in partner
ship with NYC in a task compli
cated by Stanford's security and pro
tocol requirements. Ruci expressed
gratitude, however, for the platform's
reception by Stanford administrators
and subsequent access to opportuni
ties for further partnerships.
"This is a good place to be if
you're doing something like this,"
Ruci said.
He acknowledged, however, that
the entrenched nature of the class
management system market and
fluctuations in student and faculty
preferences meant that
InYourClass's success at Stanford is
far from assured, especially as devel
opers continue to work on full inte
gration into Stanford's WebAuth
system.
"Stanford doesn't limit [itself] to
one thing," said Fani Maksakuli, one
of Ruci's principal collaborators.
"They like to experiment with
everything, and they go with what
faculty and students like."
Class Owl
Class Owl, a Stanford student
startup, shares InYourClass's intent

of introducing a social aspect to class
management systems but, according
to co-founder Sam Purtill 'l3, it aims
to do so in conjunction with
Course Work rather than offering a
competitor platform.
"[CourseWork] does the job [of
providing document storage]... it's
not trying to be social," Purtill said.
"Course Work is an open-source proj
ect, and it can be hard for open-source
projects to keep up with technology."
In an attempt to complement
Course Work, Class Owl aims to offer
a centralized location for students to
find all relevant information regard
ing their academic, social and profes
sional lives, effectively synchronizing
various syllabi into a single offering.
"What we're trying to replace is
the syllabus," Purtill said. "There
should be a standard for syllabi and
you should be able to consume that
in an easy, standardized way."
Class Owl currently has around
3,500 unique Stanford users, and
Purtill expressed cautious optimism
about the platform's future
prospects as full integration into
Course Work continues.
"A lot of people come up to us
and say they really like it," Purtill
said. "With the University backing
us, it's made it a lot easier."
Blackboard
An offering largely similar to
Course Work, Blackboard has been
used extensively at the School of
Education while falling victim to
many of the same criticisms, such as
a lack of social networking features.
Paul Kim, assistant dean of the
School of Education, asserted that
Blackboard's advantages lie in

accessibility to outside speakers
who lack the SUNet ID required to
use Course Work and the avail
ability of numerous mobile versions,
in part the product of the iStanford
mobile application.
He acknowledged, however, that
the platform is vulnerable to trends
in online education, which could
potentially make traditional learn
ing management systems redundant.
"There are some experimental
online courses we are offering and I
am encouraging our faculty members
to try different tools and learning
environments," Kim wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Technology
keeps evolving; so should pedagogy."
Online offerings
Even while various offerings com
pete with Course Work to serve the
Stanford community, the University
continues to emphasize platforms
focused on online education and the
accompanying potential for reaching
thousands of students. Internally
developed platforms such as Class2Go
and startups such as Coursera have
found applications both within and
beyond Stanford in a shift supported
by University administrators. Many
of these integrate the essential fea
tures of course management software
within the massive open online
course platform.
"We want to get ahead of this
wave," said University President
John Hennessy to the Faculty Senate
in January, speaking on online educa
tion. "I want to be surfing the wave,
not drowning in it."
