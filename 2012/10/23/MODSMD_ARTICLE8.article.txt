## 
### Julia Enthoven 
January 2008 The Office of Judicial Affairs extends the statute of limitations from
six months to two years for all cases thot would fall under the Alternative Review
Process (ARP), which has not yet been implemented.
April 2010 The Office of Judicial Affairs approves the ARP as a two-year pilot program.
April 6,2011 The Office of Civil Rights publishes the "Dear Colleague" letter
requiring that universities change their procedures for cases involving sexual assault
by lowering the burden of proof from beyond a reasonable doubt to a 'preponder
ance of evidence' (more likely than not). Additionally, the letter demands both par
ties have equal rights of appeal and the responding student's right to face their
accuser be removed.
April 12,2011 Hennessey employs his authority as the President of the
University to override the existing judicial affairs charter and ASSU Constitution,
revising the ARP in accordance with the federal interpretation.
July 19, 2011 An article in the New York Post from a member of the Foundation
for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) mocks Stanford's definition of sexual
assault and the ARP, bringing national scrutiny.
Oct. 25,2011 The Board of Judicial Affairs votes to extend ARP to winter quarter
of 2012.

May 1,2012 Elliot Wolf, the former president of the Duke student body, speaks at
the meeting of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate, warning the representatives of the
dangers of removing procedural protections from the judicial charter, particularly for
procedures involving sexual assault.
May 1,2012 After several long debates, the 13th Undergraduate Senate holds a
series of straw-poll votes on different provisions of the ARP but fails to approve or
deny the new ARP charter, leaving its legal status in limbo and passing the decision
to approve or reject the ARP to the 14th Undergraduate Senate.
May 2,2012 FIRE writes the Graduate Student Council, urging them to reject the
ARP's preponderance of evidence standard of proof.
May 8, 2012 The Board of Judicial Affairs votes unanimously to reinstate an
assumed innocence clause into the ARP.
Summer 2012 A small working group consisting mainly of ASSU elected officials
and representatives from the Office of Community Standards meets to discuss the
format of student feedback sessions.
Oct. 23 and 24, 2012 Office of Community Standards and ASSU Executive are
scheduled to host two town halls designed to teach students about the ARP and
gather their feedback.
