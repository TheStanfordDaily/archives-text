## Blood transfers in mice shown to slow aging process 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Natasha Weaser 
A recent study conducted by School of Medicine
researcher Saul Villeda found that that injection of blood
from young mice into older mice reversed certain aging
effects, especially those related to cognitive learning and
memory.
Villeda used a method known as heterochronic para
biosis, connecting the circulatory systems of an old and a
young mouse to allow their blood to combine. He found
that the number of stem cells in the brains of the treated
older mice increased and that there was a 20 percent
increase in neural connections between their brain cells.

The young blood "topped up" levels of key chemical
factors that normally decline in the blood as the mice age.
The researchers have not determined exactly what chemi
cal factors in the blood cause the anti-aging effect.

To see if the physical changes led to behavioral modifi
cations, Villeda employed a memory test using a water
maze and found that the treated older mice performed at
same level as young mice, while untreated old mice consis
tently made mistakes.
Villeda presented the research, which built on previous
findings, at the annual meeting for the Society of
Neuroscience in New Orleans on Oct. 17. The previous
findings showed the effect in reverse younger mice that
were injected were the blood of older mice begun to age
more rapidly and were published science journal
Nature in September 2011. The latest findings have yet to
be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
While this research has yet to be translated to humans,
Villeda is confident that there is a possibility in the future
for humans to reverse the signs of aging and other diseases
such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
"Do I think that giving young blood could have an
effect on a human? I'm thinking more and more that it
might," Villeda said in an interview with The Guardian.
