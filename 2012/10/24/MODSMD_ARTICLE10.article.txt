# COUGARS COMING
## SHAW UPBEAT AS TY MONTGOMERY HEALS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The mood around Stanford football was light
hearted again, as Stanford could finally exhale after
a dominant Big Game performance. For the first
time since Sept. 8 against Duke, Stanford had a com
fortable lead at the end of the game, a welcome sight
on the Farm.

Certainly adding to the festive mood was the
news that Ty Montgomery returned to practice

Monday night. Coach David Shaw plans to evaluate
how Montgomery feels in practice this week before
deciding how much the receiver will play against
Washington State, if at all. Still, even if Montgomery
does not play on Saturday against an overmatched
Cougar squad, this development is a big step
towards the starting receiver's eventual return to
the field.

At Cal, Montgomery was not desperately missed,
thanks to a dominant performance on the ground
and defensively. Shaw thought there were around
nine guys who played great defense, including red
shirt senior Chase Thomas, who coach thought
played maybe the most complete game of his career.
Shaw was especially impressed by a pass rush
move Thomas used to get to Cal quarterback Zach

Maynard. The move is called an ice pick spin move, a
term which no members of the media recognized on
Tuesday. This led to the press conference highlight of
the season, when Shaw demonstrated the pass rush
move on San Francisco Chronicle writer Tom
Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald and Shaw have had some tense
moments over the course of the season, leading to
friendly jeers from around the room sarcastically
egging the two on. That moment seemed to signify to
the world that Shaw has moved forward from some
of his most defensive moments earlier this season,
going so far as to add, "Tom and I are buddies."
The laughs were free-flowing all morning, show-

Sophomore wide receiver Ty Montgomery (above) could be set for a return to action this weekend against Washington State after sitting out
last Saturday's Big Game due to injury. Though missing a key player, Stanford dominated the game and defeated rival California 21-3.
