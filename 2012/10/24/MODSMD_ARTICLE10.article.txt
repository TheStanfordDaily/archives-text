# COUGARS COMING
## SHAW UPBEAT AS TY MONTGOMERY HEALS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The mood around Stanford football was light
hearted again, as Stanford could finally exhale after
a dominant Big Game performance. For the first
time since Sept. 8 against Duke, Stanford had a com
fortable lead at the end of the game, a welcome sight
on the Farm.

Certainly adding to the festive mood was the
news that Ty Montgomery returned to practice

Monday night. Coach David Shaw plans to evaluate
how Montgomery feels in practice this week before
deciding how much the receiver will play against
Washington State, if at all. Still, even if Montgomery
does not play on Saturday against an overmatched
Cougar squad, this development is a big step
towards the starting receiver's eventual return to
the field.

At Cal, Montgomery was not desperately missed,
thanks to a dominant performance on the ground
and defensively. Shaw thought there were around
nine guys who played great defense, including red
shirt senior Chase Thomas, who coach thought
played maybe the most complete game of his career.
Shaw was especially impressed by a pass rush
move Thomas used to get to Cal quarterback Zach

Maynard. The move is called an ice pick spin move, a
term which no members of the media recognized on
Tuesday. This led to the press conference highlight of
the season, when Shaw demonstrated the pass rush
move on San Francisco Chronicle writer Tom
Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald and Shaw have had some tense
moments over the course of the season, leading to
friendly jeers from around the room sarcastically
egging the two on. That moment seemed to signify to
the world that Shaw has moved forward from some
of his most defensive moments earlier this season,
going so far as to add, "Tom and I are buddies."
The laughs were free-flowing all morning, show-

ing just how much the Big
Game victory really meant to
the team. Shaw couldn't contain
his laughter when asked
whether Joshua Garnett, the
325-pound offensive lineman
who has spent some time at full
back in jumbo sets, might be
given a carry near the goal line.
When it got back to busi
ness, the biggest personnel
move discussed was Alex
Carter's promotion to a starting
cornerback position. The true
freshman is a freak athlete
Shaw called his vertical jump,
broad jump, 40-time, and body
fat percentage "NFL Combine
numbers" at the age of 17
and now is starting to get the
feel of the cornerback position.
Carter, whose father played

cornerback at Notre Dame
before a long NFL career, had
an interesting experience two
weeks ago in South Bend. His
parents and two younger sis
ters flew to Notre Dame for the
game, but everyone in the fami
ly wore Notre Dame gear
except his mother, who proudly
displayed Carter's Stanford
jersey.

"There's nothing I can do,"
Carter said. "The older one
wants to go to Notre Dame and
the younger one is an Oregon
fan."

The other freshman seeing
a dramatic increase in playing
time is quarterback Kevin
Hogan. The redshirt freshman
Hogan, after running read
option a couple of times with
Remound Wright over the past
few weeks, started to see his
playbook open up against Cal.
This development culminated in
a touchdown pass from Hogan
to tight end Levine Toilolo.

Hogan, who is the best runner
among the Stanford quarter
backs, rolled out to his right and
found Toilolo in the end zone.

Hogan told the media that
his first instinct on that play is
to run the ball, and about half
the time he runs the play in
practice he is able to run the
football. However, because Cal
was able to defend it well, he
was forced to throw, and
showed that he can deliver a
strike on the run.

Look for Hogan's role to
increase, potentially in the way
iy Montgomery appeared mid
way through 2011. Stanford his
torically has tried to run up to
ten plays per game with an ath
letic quarterback, most recently
with Alex Loukas. If Hogan
continues to have success in
practice, he could continue to
earn more snaps very soon.

of his most defensive moments earlier this season,
going so far as to add, "Tom and I are buddies."
The laughs were free-flowing all morning, show-

Sophomore wide receiver Ty Montgomery (above) could be set for a return to action this weekend against Washington State after sitting out
last Saturday's Big Game due to injury. Though missing a key player, Stanford dominated the game and defeated rival California 21-3.
ing just how much the Big
Game victory really meant to
the team. Shaw couldn't contain
his laughter when asked
whether Joshua Garnett, the
325-pound offensive lineman
who has spent some time at full
back in jumbo sets, might be
given a carry near the goal line.
When it got back to busi
ness, the biggest personnel
move discussed was Alex
Carter's promotion to a starting
cornerback position. The true
freshman is a freak athlete
Shaw called his vertical jump,
broad jump, 40-time, and body
fat percentage "NFL Combine
numbers" at the age of 17
and now is starting to get the
feel of the cornerback position.
Carter, whose father played

cornerback at Notre Dame
before a long NFL career, had
an interesting experience two
weeks ago in South Bend. His
parents and two younger sis
ters flew to Notre Dame for the
game, but everyone in the fami
ly wore Notre Dame gear
except his mother, who proudly
displayed Carter's Stanford
jersey.

"There's nothing I can do,"
Carter said. "The older one
wants to go to Notre Dame and
the younger one is an Oregon
fan."

The other freshman seeing
a dramatic increase in playing
time is quarterback Kevin
Hogan. The redshirt freshman
Hogan, after running read
option a couple of times with
Remound Wright over the past
few weeks, started to see his
playbook open up against Cal.
This development culminated in
a touchdown pass from Hogan
to tight end Levine Toilolo.

Hogan, who is the best runner
among the Stanford quarter
backs, rolled out to his right and
found Toilolo in the end zone.

Hogan told the media that
his first instinct on that play is
to run the ball, and about half
the time he runs the play in
practice he is able to run the
football. However, because Cal
was able to defend it well, he
was forced to throw, and
showed that he can deliver a
strike on the run.

Look for Hogan's role to
increase, potentially in the way
iy Montgomery appeared mid
way through 2011. Stanford his
torically has tried to run up to
ten plays per game with an ath
letic quarterback, most recently
with Alex Loukas. If Hogan
continues to have success in
practice, he could continue to
earn more snaps very soon.
