# Opportunity knocking for Card
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team came home from a strenuous,
tense but ultimately successful road
trip to Washington this weekend with a
highly sought-after prize a No. 1
national ranking. After beating
Washington and Washington State, the
Card kept its undefeated record in the
Pac-12 and passed Penn State for the
top spot in the national polls.
The turnaround for Stanford is
quick as its next challengers,
Arizona and Arizona State, visit the
Farm this week. The Cardinal (18-2,
10-0 Pac-12) will face off against
Arizona (12-9, 4-6 Pac-12) tonight and
Arizona State (14-9, 3-7 Pac-12) on

Friday, putting its both its undefeated
record at home and its 16-game win
ning streak.
The Wildcats are coming off a dom
inant performance against Oregon
State where they won in four sets. The
win gives Arizona much-needed
momentum in the Pac-12. But even
though Stanford hit a season low (.110)
against Washington over the weekend
and only has a two day rest after a five
set game against Washington State,
Arizona will need more than its per
formance against Oregon State to
upset the Cardinal.
The two teams have already met
twice this season, and in both meetings

Freshman outside hitter Jordan Burgess (23) and her Cardinal teammates will face both Arizona and Arizona State at home this weekend.
No. 1 Stanford is undefeated in the Pac-12 conference.
Stanford won in four sets.
While Arizona's sophomore
outside hitter Madi Kingdon
had a match-high 13 kills in its
victory over Oregon State she
will hard pressed to match the
hitting and blocking power of
Stanford's middle blocker
Carly Wopat, who is really
rounding into top form at the
moment. Wopat, a 6-foot-2 jun
ior from Santa Barbara, Calif.,
had two solid games last week
end and was the key to
Stanford's win against No. 11
Washington. Her 15 kills and
crucial blocks also helped her
pick up Pae-12 Offensive Player

of the Week honors. If Wopat
can build off her strong per
formance as a leader for the
team, the Cardinal shouldn't
have too many problems leav
ing Maples with a win on
Friday night.
Stanford's freshman middle
blocker Inky Ajanaku has also
has been proving that age does
not have to be a factor and has
thus far been a great compli
ment to Wopat. Freshmen out
side hitters Jordan Burgess
and Brittany Howard will also
look to add to their recent suc
cess, hoping to repeat a com
bined 34-dig performance
against Washington, and fresh
man setter Madi Bugg will also
be put on display at Maples.
Stanford showed this weekend
that its young players have
plenty of fight; while the team

struggled at certain points
against the Huskies and trailed
early, perseverance paid off in
the fifth set with the Cardinal
winning 15-7.
Stanford is also likely to see
little challenge to its near per
fect season from Arizona State,
which is two places below Arizona
in the Phc-12 table. While they
beat Oregon State last Friday,
the Sun Devils are coming off a
loss to Oregon in three sets.
The Sun Devils' leading
attackers, freshman outside hit
ter Macey Gardner and senior
outside hitter Erica Wilson,
have both had strong perform
ances in the last two games.
Gardner posted a team-best 12
kills against Oregon, and
Wilson proved she can provide
points at crucial moments.
Neither player, however, is a

match for the Cardinal's hitting
power, and Stanford will look to
have a strong blocking and
defensive night against Arizona
State's middle blockers.
The Card has had a very
demanding and challenging
last few weeks four out of its
last six opponents were ranked
when Stanford played them
but the young squad has man
aged to come out on top, setting
itself up as the team to beat, not
only in the Pac-12 but also
nationally.
Fans at Maples have yet to
see Stanford lose so far this
season, and this is an unlikely
week for that to start. Tonight's
match will start at 7 p.m., tele
vised on the Pac-12 Networks.
