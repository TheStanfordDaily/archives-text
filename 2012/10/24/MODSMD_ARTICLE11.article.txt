# Opportunity knocking for Card
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team came home from a strenuous,
tense but ultimately successful road
trip to Washington this weekend with a
highly sought-after prize a No. 1
national ranking. After beating
Washington and Washington State, the
Card kept its undefeated record in the
Pac-12 and passed Penn State for the
top spot in the national polls.
The turnaround for Stanford is
quick as its next challengers,
Arizona and Arizona State, visit the
Farm this week. The Cardinal (18-2,
10-0 Pac-12) will face off against
Arizona (12-9, 4-6 Pac-12) tonight and
Arizona State (14-9, 3-7 Pac-12) on

Friday, putting its both its undefeated
record at home and its 16-game win
ning streak.
The Wildcats are coming off a dom
inant performance against Oregon
State where they won in four sets. The
win gives Arizona much-needed
momentum in the Pac-12. But even
though Stanford hit a season low (.110)
against Washington over the weekend
and only has a two day rest after a five
set game against Washington State,
Arizona will need more than its per
formance against Oregon State to
upset the Cardinal.
The two teams have already met
twice this season, and in both meetings
