# SENIOR SITDOWN
## JAKE KNELLER 
### 
Jake Knefler is the lone sen
ior on this year's men's vol
leyball team. Gone are Ail-
Americans Brad Lawson
and Erij Shoji, along with
the rest of the class of 2012 that set a
school record with 86 wins in four sea
sons.
Kneller, a 6-foot4 outside hitter
from Westlake Village, Calif., stands
by himself as the only member of the
team who was on the roster for
Stanford's NCAA Championship in
2010. A co-captain with junior Brian
Cook, Kneller sat down with The
Daily to discuss the volleyball squad's
musical tastes and all things Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):As a sen
ior, how do you take on a leadership
role as the only guy on the team who
has tasted the kind of success that is
an NCAA title?
Jake Kneller (Kneller):lt's a little
weird. I'm the only senior, and all the
other classes are pretty large so it is
kind of funny in that way I do defi
nitely feel added responsibility and
pride, mostly just focusing on con
ducting myself the right way on and
off the court.
When you're younger, you can
kind of get away with stuff, not in a
bad way, but just in that you can have
a game where you aren't totally into it
physically and mentally. Now the
freshmen are looking at the way I
play and act all the time to see how to
conduct themselves. I enjoy doing
that, and it's nice to play that roll for a
change.
TSD:You've only had a couple of
weeks playing together this year, but
what's the team dynamic like so far
with the younger classes making up
such a large proportion of the roster?
Kn eller: Fbom the first day of practice,
we said that everyone on the team is
going to have the opportunity to be
leaders. Every person brings some
thing and there's going to be a time
and place where we need them to take
on a leadership role. It's definitely a
different dynamic from last year with
seven seniors gone, three or four of
them had been starting the whole

time, so it was reaily a senior-heavy
team.

This season it's almost like we
have been wiped clean. I am the only
one left from the 2010 national team,
and that team was kind of really tied
to the guys that graduated—Brad
[Lawson], Erik [Shoji], Gus [Ellis],
We have a lot to prove, and while we
don't have that senior experience,
from an on-court perspective the
experience comes from all over the
places. It comes from Cook and [Eric]
Maholski, from the two freshmen set
ters, one of whom has to start because
they're the only ones on the roster.
We have to come together and it has
to be that way to lead us to victory.
TSD:Ok, well let's transition a little to
a couple of lighter topics. What's play
ing on the iPod in the locker room
these days?
Kneller: Oh, well definitely "Walking
on Broken Glass" by Annie Lennox,
been listening to that quite a bit.
Probably "Shark in the Water," the
Louis la Roche remix. And we're
pretty big T-Swift fans, so "I Knew
You Were TVouble" off the new album.
TSD:Ahight very nice. Where can
you find the best meal on campus and
what is it?
Kndleri'd have to say burrito night
at Kappa Alpha [Kneller's residence].
Every other Wednesday night with
my boy Billy [KAs house chef] is
where it's at.
TSD:What's the greatest moment
you've been a part of with the team?
Kndlerißas to be winning a national
championship at Maples Pavilion in
front of a sold-out crowd my tresh
man year. Trying to get back there is
the goal this year. We've got the 2013
NCAA Championship circled on the
board in our locker room already We
know we've got the skill and heart,
and now we have to put in the work
because everyone wants it. Now it's
about wanting it more than the next
guy It's a journey and you have to
