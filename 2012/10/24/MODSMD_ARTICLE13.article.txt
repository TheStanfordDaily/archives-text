# OPINIONS
## Politics as Sport 
### John Murray 
It seemed only fair to find the last
presidential debate on foreign pol
icy doing battle with Game 7 of the
NLCS over which competitive event
would grace the sole big screen TV of
the Kappa Sigma house. Political
junkies clashed with Giants fanatics,
with the presidential debate narrowly
winning out once the Giants took a
commanding 5-0 lead in the bottom of
the third.

It was post-channel switch when it
hit me: the mood in the room hadn't
really changed all that much, and, in an
odd way, the nature of the do-or-die
series deciding game really didn't
seem that far off from the tension sur
rounding the final debate.

Here we had fans of both the candi
dates and of mostly the Giants, who
didn't know either man or any player
on any team, yet were as passionate as
can be in supporting their mm, or their
team. Certainly, various political ten
dencies were a bit more subtle during
the debate-watching, but a click scroll
through my newsfeed only confirmed
my hunch: sentence-long opinions were
being blasted across friend circles and
Twitter feeds, memes celebrating the
Giants win and mocking Romney's lack
of geography skills were being pro
duced at near-instantaneous rates.
Public pages for Obama and Romney
were being liked and various quotes
blown up over pictures of the candi
dates' faces were being shared while
hordes of Bay Area folks posted vari
ous updates along the lines of "HOLY
S#*T GIANTS GOING TO 'SHIR"

In game, and in debate, pitches
were dueling with batters, while
Obama and Romney traded lyrical
blows back and forth, trying to score
various rhetorical points while seem
ing to want to avoid most of the tricki
er foreign policy issues (really, no men
tion of the economic crisis in Europe
that could actually drag us "towards
Greece" as Romney likes to say? No
mention of the environment?). Post
debate highlight clips were compiled in
a Sports Center-like manner, as
zingers the political equivalent to
slam dunks and home runs were
run over and over again as if they actu
ally had any political substance.
It was nauseating, to be honest,
and the more I thought about it, the
more I began to see more clearly the
connection between competitive ath
letics and presidential elections.
Which I can't admit to feeling too
hot about.

Sports have rules and laws and eti
quette and strategies that are all
meant to result in the designation of
various winners in various events. And
in polities, we in turn have winners of

debates and of elections. The differ
ence between politics and sports,
though, is that political winners actual
ly have a public responsibility once the
game is over. Clever rhetoric and effec
tive advertising may get you into the
White House, but it isn't going to solve
any problems. Still, it seems to be the
primary substance of the current elec
toral process.

I almost feel as though we saw a win
dow into the underbelly of democracy
last night, the inherent game of elec
toral politics in which the primary
incentive in these debates isn't to legit
imately talk about the issues (or even
attempt to cooperate on the issues),
but rather to sway voters through poll
tested anecdotes and one-liners. And
in a post-Citizens United world, the
incentive seems only higher to pander
to powerful factions farther from the
middle aisle cooperation is taboo.
Like in sports, you help your team, and
your team only.

And presidential elections
they're the Super Bowls of politics, the
one time every four years when people
actually seem to give a damn about
what's happening in the nation and in
the world at large. Sports are delicate,
high-flying affairs in which single
moments can or break seasons or
careers. That's not how politics should
be treated, yet we're going to spend
the next week talking about horses and
bayonets and polls and predictions
rather than actual foreign policy
issues. The vanity of it all seems to be
especially evident when we think about
the consequences of foreign policy:
unlike discussing marginal rates of
taxation, when you talk about foreign
policy, even when you mask it in vari
ous Orwellian bullshit of "comprehen
sive military strategies" or "being
tough on Iran," you're talking about
life and death, of Syrians being blown
apart by their own government,
Pakistani citizens falling before the
drone colossus.

I'm sure I sound pretty middle
school whiny right now. But I just can't
feel good about this current electoral
cycle. I'm watching a game of gaffes
and punditry, memes and commercials,
one that transforms issues into talking
points, favors attack over cooperation,
and leaves me flipping between ESPN
and CNN with equal zeal as if its the
Giants who're going to deal with
Israeli settlements, and it's Obama or
Romney who will be holding the
Commissioner's Trophy in a week.

Think Obama can pinch-run for
the Giants or Romney can pitch
for the Tigers ,? Tell John atjhmur
