# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
We write to respond to the article in October
18th's The Stanford Daily about the lack of
rehearsal spaces for performing arts students on
campus. It is very much the case that we, as a
campus and a department, have a need for more
rehearsal and performance spaces; however, we
want to correct some of the assumptions and mis
statements that appear in the article.

The statement that the new Stanford Aits
Institute is in any way responsible for the lack of
rehearsal space is completely erroneous. Indeed,
they are major sponsors of student work and the
aits initiatives on campus that are open to all. At
least one of the spaces in question was reserved for
Stanford Theater and Performance Studies (TAPS)
classes and in fact features Stanford alumnae, who
have returned to work with students as our guest
artists. We therefore wish to underscore the fact
that Roble is a space that prioritizes student work
—particularly those of our majors, minors and
graduate students. We regret any misunderstand
ings that may have occurred as a result of how the
space was saved last spring on the website.
We are in agreement with the desire for more
space for performing arts (Arrillaga Dining Hall
has a room with a sprung floor!). We are working
collaboratively with the Stanford Arts Institute
and other arts departments on finding new

spaces and would welcome the opportunity to dis
cuss these issues with the student groups as well.

We are writing in response to the article in
October ISth's Daily about rehearsal and per
formance spaces for student arts groups. We are
in complete agreement with the author that the
campus needs more spaces for student arts-mak
ing. We have been working over the last year with
representatives from across the university
including ASSU and student arts leadership
to create new spaces for student rehearsal and
performance, because we strongly believe these
should be more easily available. The recently
built Arrillaga Family Dining Commons houses a
studio space with sprung floors that can be used
for dance and other rehearsals. A recent upgrade
to the theater in Roble Hall is just a fust step in
a more long-term plan that involves upgrading
existing spaces and creating new ones. We would

welcome the opportunity to work with Viraj
Bindra and other student leaders on these plans.
We would like, however, to correct some false
impressions created by the article. There are
numerous minor inaccuracies, but two larger
ones stand out.

The Stanford Arts Institute has no program
ming in Roble Dance Studio or in Braun Music
Center and plays no role in scheduling those facil
ities. Roble Dance Studio is programmed by the
Department of Theater and Performance Studies
and Braun Music Center is programmed by the
Department of Music.

It is also not accurate to say that Elliott
Program Center is open only to Governor's
Corner residents. In fact, over the past year EPC
has been prioritized for arts use and made avail
able to arts-makers from across campus, thanks
to efforts by our colleague James Cadena, the
Director of Arts in Residential Education.
We are concerned that no effort was made to
contact us to verify the accuracy of your informa
tion or to obtain our perspective, and we hope
that you will make every effort to verify the accu
racy of your reporting in the future.

We share the frustration over the lack of
space for student arts-making and are working to
create more opportunities for students to create,

rehearse, and perform around campus. We wel
come the opportunity for dialogue and for work
ing together to make improvements for student
artists.
