In "Performing arts groups struggle to find
rehearsal spaces" (Oct. 17), The Daily incorrectly
reported that the Elliott Program Center is only
open to Governor's Corner residents. In fact, all
students can use the center. Additionally, The
Daily misrepresented the level of Stanford Arts
Institute (SAl)'s involvement due to clerical
errors by the Department of Theater and
Performance Studies that led to incorrect book
ings remaining on the Roble calendar since last
spring. The SAI still funds at least one class using
space in the Roble gym complex, though that
class may have been able to run without SAI
funding. The Daily regrets these errors.
