### Tom Taylor 
Redshirt junior forward Courtney Verloo earned her first Pac
-12 Player of the Week honors yesterday, after scoring two goals and
making one assist in the Cardinal's wins over Washington and
Washington State last weekend.

The Tualatin, Ore., native leads the team on overall offensive
statistics this season, and with six goals is second only to senior for
ward Mariah Nogueira. After missing last year due to injury,
Verloo's return has played an important part in No.l Stanford's 14-
1-1 overall record and unbeaten conference schedule so far.

This weekend the Cardinal heads down to Los Angeles to face
USC on Friday ahead of a top-of-the-rankings clash with N0.2
UCLA on Sunday.
