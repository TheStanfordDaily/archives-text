## Focus groups to review student unions 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University has recently launched a
series of focus groups to gain feedback from
undergraduates about the state of Stanford's
student unions. Despite the presence of exter
nal architects and members of Capital
Planning at the first focus group session held
on Oct. 12, University administrators maintain
that there are currently no established plans
for a new or renovated student union.

"We are just trying basically to reach out to
students right now and see what they think of
the existing campus center facilities," said Zach

Poznei; senior campus planner. "This is part of
an ongoing effort to see if what's there is suffi
cient for them, or if there are other things
they'd like to see there."
Discussion at the first focus group session,
attended by a group of roughly 25 student lead
ers, revolved largely around identifying short
comings with Old Union and Tresidder Union's
current offerings. Participants noted a lack of
practice space, a shortage of electrical outlets
and a desire for a more relaxed 24-hour study
space than the one currently offered in Meyer
Library.
"People were just going around, sharing
ideas," said Taylor Winfield 'l3, a former ASSU

chair of health and wellness and attendee of the
meeting. "It seemed like they had collected a
really representative group of students... We
sort of built off of each other."

All members of the focus group session
received invitations to attend from Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations and student
unions. When deciding which students to invite,
Smith-Laws said she sought out recommenda
tions from University administrators, looking
for students who would be able to think about
the needs of students outside of their own
immediate groups.

and Tresidder Memorial Union. Student group leaders, architects and University administrators attended the first session.
