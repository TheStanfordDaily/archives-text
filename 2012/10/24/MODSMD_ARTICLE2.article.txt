## Focus groups to review student unions 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University has recently launched a
series of focus groups to gain feedback from
undergraduates about the state of Stanford's
student unions. Despite the presence of exter
nal architects and members of Capital
Planning at the first focus group session held
on Oct. 12, University administrators maintain
that there are currently no established plans
for a new or renovated student union.

"We are just trying basically to reach out to
students right now and see what they think of
the existing campus center facilities," said Zach

Poznei; senior campus planner. "This is part of
an ongoing effort to see if what's there is suffi
cient for them, or if there are other things
they'd like to see there."
Discussion at the first focus group session,
attended by a group of roughly 25 student lead
ers, revolved largely around identifying short
comings with Old Union and Tresidder Union's
current offerings. Participants noted a lack of
practice space, a shortage of electrical outlets
and a desire for a more relaxed 24-hour study
space than the one currently offered in Meyer
Library.
"People were just going around, sharing
ideas," said Taylor Winfield 'l3, a former ASSU

chair of health and wellness and attendee of the
meeting. "It seemed like they had collected a
really representative group of students... We
sort of built off of each other."

All members of the focus group session
received invitations to attend from Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations and student
unions. When deciding which students to invite,
Smith-Laws said she sought out recommenda
tions from University administrators, looking
for students who would be able to think about
the needs of students outside of their own
immediate groups.

Student Affairs held its first focus group on Oct. 12 to collect feedback about student union space, including Old Union
and Tresidder Memorial Union. Student group leaders, architects and University administrators attended the first session.
She acknowledged, however, the
need for broader feedback from the
Stanford community moving forward.
According to Smith-Laws, administra
tors will be sending out campus-wide
surveys in the coming weeks and will be
holding more focus group sessions.
"We want to hear from students who
we might not necessarily hear from all
the time," Smith-Laws said. "We want to
hear from a range of students with a
broad range of interests."
"We realize that this is just the start
ing point, but the tree keeps branching
after that," said David Geet 'l2, who was
recently hired by the Office of the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs to help study
student unions. Geet led the Oct. 12 focus
group session.
Pozner downplayed the significance
of the presence of a group of New York
based architects at the focus group,
framing their participation as only com
plementary to student perspectives.
"Bringing in some additional expert
ise this time is not really out of the ordi
nary," Pozner said.
According to Smith-Laws, the dis
cussion group is way to explore the
nature of an ideal student union on a
campus where student unions have
diminished in their significance as facili
ties have sprung up elsewhere. The focus
groups coincided with the 50th anniver
sary of Tkesidder Union, which original
ly incorporated an art gallery and bowl
ing alley as well as student spaces.
Through the focus groups, Smith-
Laws said the University is hoping to
create a master plan for student spaces
moving forward.
"We are trying to create a complete

picture, so we can do phases," Smith-
Laws said. "We are trying to create that
campus center that brings students
together and out of their residences,
[that students] really think is a student
union."
Focus group participants echoed
Smith-Laws's sentiments, expressing
support for a campus social hub while
also aiming to preserve well-received
aspects of existing facilities.
"[Student unions spaces] can defi
nitely be improved and be more inclusive
for all student groups and student
types," said Rebecca Yanes 'l5, a staff
member at El Centre Chicano. "Making
an all-inclusive student union doesn't
mean we don't need community cen
ters."
"There's no communal hub," said
ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2. "I
would love a place that —and this is the
big thing lacking at Stanford and Palo
Alto—you know is the place to watch
the game."
According to Zimbroff the ASSU
has yet to become involved in the process
while it remains largely in its conceptual
stage. He predicted that this would
change if plans solidify.
"I do think that's a place where the
ASSU gets to have a say in what's going
on," Zimbroff said. "Right now the gist of
it was that they're trying to see if that's
something that would even be useful."
Smith-Laws said there is not cur
rently any planned funding for renova
tion or construction purposes, but added
that the focus groups and subsequent
outreach could serve as a starting point
for planning a new facility, pending fund
ing and other considerations.
