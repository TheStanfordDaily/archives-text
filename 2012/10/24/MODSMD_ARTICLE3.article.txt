## Students more likely to identify as multiracial 
### TAYLOR CHAMBERS 
Erika Roach 'l3 identifies herself as
"Blasian", while Marcus Montanez-Leaks 'l3
says he's "Blexican."
These terms and others used to describe
mixed race individuals are becoming more
common in conversation and student groups
focused on mixed race issues have begun pop
ping up on campus, a trend mirroring the rise
in applications.
Mixed race applicants to Stanford are "one
of the fastest growing groups," according to
Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw
During the 2011-12 academic year, 11.6

percent of undergraduates identified their
racial/ethnic category as "two or more races,"
up from 8.4 percent the previous year. 2010-11
was the first year the University began collect
ing data on mixed race individuals.
In 2011, the Department of Education
started requiring universities to collect more
information about applicants' race and ethnici
ty. Many college applications, including the
Common Application that Stanford uses, now
allow students to check multiple boxes when it
comes to describing their racial and ethnic
identities.

"Students [telling] us exactly what their
racial background is...is not a mandatory

request. It is optional," Shaw said. He added
that the ability to self-identify accurately is a
critical part of the college admissions process.
For students who identify with more than
one heritage, the ability to check all that apply
on the racial background section of college
admissions proves crucial to establishing their
identity.

"When we were younger, a lot of times we
were torn," Roach, who is Puerto Rican on her
father's side and Filipino on her mother's side,
said. "Which box do you check when you iden
tify with both sides? People were telling you
that you'd have to choose between your
heritage."

The new boxes and check marks on
the Common Application didn't come
without criticism. A 2011 New York
Times article raised concerns that these
increased options may enable students
to cheat admissions and favor the race
they believe will boost their admission
chances, assuming the college uses affir
mative action in admissions decisions.

Michele Elam, English professor
and author of a 2011 book on mixed
race, The Souls of Mixed Folk: Race,
Politics and Aesthetics in the New
Millennium, argues that diversity
remains an important consideration
among many others in college admis
sions, but does not believe that stu
dents are simply "cynically trying to
game the system by checking as many

boxes as possible."
"A lot of young high school students
when doing college admissions are just
coming of age politically and racially,"
Elam said. "Some may not have thought
of themselves as having a distinct mixed
identity before being asked to check
multiple boxes."

For Montanez-Leaks, whose mother
is Mexican and father is African
American, race is a matter of pride.
"It's my identity," he said. "It's part
of who I am."

Elam also said the more specific
application boxes help to promote diver
sity on campus. Without the option to
identify race, or races as the case may
be, on college applications, colleges
could not document statistics or ensure a
truly diverse student body with regard
to race and ethnicity.

Montanez-Leaks and Roach serve
as presidents of The Multiracial
Identified Community at Stanford
(MICS), which Montanez-Leaks said
"provides a space where you can com
pletely be yourself." Likewise, Roach

feels at liberty to explore her identity
through multiple lenses.

"I think race is very much who I am,
"Roach said. "I identify with black
issues. I identify with Filipino issues. I
identify with Asian issues. I don't ever
let other people try to define me by my
race. I am proud to represent both of my
races and I feel they are very much a
part of me."

For Roach, the community and the
option to mark both races with which
she identifies allow her to present her
self in accordance with her self-image.

"I marked both boxes because
that's who I am," Roach said. "I always
knew how I identified, it was very con
venient on the application to have those
options."

While college applications and
University statistics are quickly catch
ing up, Elam says the process is far from
over. Progress is admirable, but mixed
race is still a "category in the making."
