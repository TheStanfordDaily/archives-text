# House staff pay inequity faces review
## Discrepancy most evident between PHE,RA salary 
### NATASHA VON KAEPPLER 
Salaries for student housing positions do not reflect the
training and responsibility required for each position,
according to many housing staff members, coordinators and
Health Promotion Services (HPS). The discrepancy is most
obvious in the pay gap between resident assistants (RAs)
and peer health educators (PHEs).
Student Affairs is currently 18 months into a study on
discrepancy in pay between staffing positions. According to
Dean of Residential Education (ResEd) Deborah Colder,
the study will be concluded this school year. Changes will
not be implemented until ResEd, a sub-unit of Student
Affairs, is able to survey stakeholders and gain support for
new pay structures.
Under-eompensation for PHEs is an ongoing problem
that the Vaden Health Center and Carole Pertofsky, direc
tor of Health Promotion Services, have dealt with for years.
Vaden and HPS have repeatedly submitted requests to the
Vice Provost of Student Affairs for increased budgets in
order to increase the PHE salary, Pertofsky said. Those
requests have all been denied.
Colder agrees that housing staffs are an integral part of
the Stanford residential experience and that the students'
commitments to their roles as staff members is not to be
diminished, saying the discrepancy may be outdated.
"Compensation levels when they started, in my opinion,
were probably accurate to what the roles were... but the
work is not the same as what it originally was," Golder said.
"The goal is to have the right people in the right places
doing the right things for the right amount of pay," said
Jennifer Calvert, associate dean of Res Ed.
However, according to reports from student staff mem
bers, that goal has not yet been met.
"I put in as many hours as a PHE in a freshman dorm as
I do now as an RA for nine and a half times the salary I
made last year," said Tessa Smith 'l3, a current RA in
Kimball and former PHE in Stern.
RAs, in addition to free housing and a meal plan, are paid
the amount of 75 percent of their room and board tuition
a salary that averages to about $9,000 per year. PHEs also
live for free in-house but are paid roughly $2,000 a year.
Smith, along with PHE Coordinator Colin Campbell 'll,
said that in terms of specialized training, time investment
and responsibility, PHEs are on par with RAs and undoubt
edly qualify for equal pay.
"The PHE program is really beneficial to residential
education, and it is sad that so many qualified people will not
or cannot consider being a PHE due to the low wage with
the hours and commitment that the job requires," Smith
said.
The salary discrepancies exist, Golder said, because
most staff members take on more responsibilities in the
house than is in the letter of the job description.
"I think people come to residential work from an ethic of
care and altruism and a desire to serve the community,"
Golder said. "I have long been concerned that we are abus
ing that generosity, and that's not ok."
The staff hiring process is divided between depart-
ments relevant to each staff position,
meaning that at minimum five differ
ent groups are hiring housing staff
for any given year. Academic
Computing Services hires residential
computing consultants (RCCs),
Residential Education (ResEd) hires
row managers community man
agers, financial managers, self-op
kitchen managers, co-op managers
and co-op kitchen managers and
RAs, ResEd and affiliated depart
ments for themed houses hire theme
house staffs, the Center for Teaching
and Learning and the Hume Writing
Center hire resident tutors and resi
dent writing tutors and iThrive at

Vaden Health Center hires PHEs.
Charlie Fierro 'l3, a current
Kimball RCC and former Stern RCC,
said that RCCs do more than their
salaries suggest, particularly in fresh
man dorms.
Academic Computing Services pay
RCCs in freshman dorms twice as much
as those in Row houses and apartment
style houses. Still, the highest RCC
salary is one quarter of an RA salary.
Despite the discrepancies in pay,
Smith, Campbell and Fierro all agreed
that there is no stigma among staff
members based on pay. Fierro and his
friends applied to be on in-house staffs
because of the residents, the resident
fellows (RFs) and complimentary
housing, not for the monetary compen
sation.
