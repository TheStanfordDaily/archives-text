## Senate debates less flexibility on attendance 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate unanimously
approved a total of $19,116.03 in funding for 11 stu
dent organizations during their Oct. 23 meeting,
including $5,257 from the traditions fund for
Stanford's annual Mausoleum party.
With the exception of Appropriations Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4, all senators were present at the
meeting. ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and
Vice President William Wagstaff 'l2 were also in
attendance and spoke to senators about the Oct. 24
town hall meeting regarding the Alternative Review
Process (ARP). Senators were slated to give a recom
mendation about the ARP to the Faculty Senate two
weeks ago but chose to delay discussion until after
town hall meetings conclude tomorrow.
"It is a great opportunity for you guys to hear
what students are thinking and how they feel. The
feedback, if it goes nowhere, doesn't mean anything,"
Zimbroff said.
The senate also discussed amending the bylaws to
clarify attendance policy. According to the bylaws,
senators who are absent for three or more meetings
per quarter will automatically have a bill for expulsion
drawn against them (Article 2, section 1, part D).
Administration and Rules Committee Chair Lauren Miller
'l5 suggested the addition of a clause specifying a maximum
of two excused and one unexcused absence each quarter.
"It is still going to be three absences per quarter, these
are just stricter guidelines," Miller said. "We are basically
trying to make it a little more strict to hold us more account
able."
The Senate's bylaws also state, "A salary shall not be paid
out if an officer does not attend at least 90 percent of required
meetings (as defined by these bylaws) in a timely fashion.
Excused absences shall not count toward the requirement."
According to this policy, a senator who has one unexcused
absence should not receive his or her salary because the
Senate will only have nine meetings this quarter.
Viraj Bindra 'l5, Janhavi Vartak 'l5 and Brandon
Hightower 'l5 have missed one meeting this year, and Nancy
Pham 'l4, Christos Haveles 'l4 and Anna Brezhneva 'l4 have
been absent for two meetings.
None of these absences were announced as excused
except for Pham's absence from the Oct. 2. meeting. Bylaws
state that members of the Senate shall individually deter
mine what constitutes an excused absence.
Miller explained that senators would be granted an
excused absence if they were out of town, sick, had a family
emergency, had to take a midterm or had a "legitimate aca
demic reason" for missing a meeting, such as a field trip. She
stated that, if possible, senators should email the senate chair
24 hours before the meeting that they will miss in order to
have then- absence excused. The Senate has yet to retroac
tively determine whether past missed meetings are excused
under this new agreement.
Senate Chair Branden Crouch 'l4 said that he is deter
mined to have better attendance at Senate meetings for the
second half of the quarter.
"We're going to meet with people who have missed meet
ings and try to work this out before it's a consistent problem
where people just don't show up," Crouch said.
Associate Dean and Director for Student Activities and
Leadership Nanci Howe solicited the help of senators to fill
empty spots on Faculty Senate committees, recruiting Jack
Weller 'l5 and Anna Brezhneva 'l5 to serve on the
Committee for the Review of Undergraduate Majors and
Viraj Binda 'l5 to serve on the Committee on Academic
Computing and Information Systems. Howe said that a fac
ulty member had written to her "in desperation" looking for
undergraduate representatives for these committees and
that she had been waiting since May to fill the positions.
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 also announced his decision to
make need-blind financial aid for international students a
"priority" of his committee. He said that he plans to discuss
the issue with the Board of Trustees and the Office of
Financial Affairs in order to determine the potential cost and
brainstorm fundraising opportunities.
"If you look at our peer institutions, schools like Harvard
and Yale have for many years had need-blind financial aid for
international applicants," Fadavi said, adding that Stanford
is "lagging behind" these schools.
Senators received a bill of previous notice for the approval
of four executive cabinet members to be voted on at the Oct.
30 meeting, though Zimbroff and Wagstaff left before the bill
was discussed. Sharma said that she hopes the appointees
will attend the meeting to answer questions from senators
about the allocation of cabinet tasks but expects that the
Senate will approve all four appointments.
