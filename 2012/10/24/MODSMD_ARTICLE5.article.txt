## Senate debates less flexibility on attendance 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate unanimously
approved a total of $19,116.03 in funding for 11 stu
dent organizations during their Oct. 23 meeting,
including $5,257 from the traditions fund for
Stanford's annual Mausoleum party.
With the exception of Appropriations Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4, all senators were present at the
meeting. ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 and
Vice President William Wagstaff 'l2 were also in
attendance and spoke to senators about the Oct. 24
town hall meeting regarding the Alternative Review
Process (ARP). Senators were slated to give a recom
mendation about the ARP to the Faculty Senate two
weeks ago but chose to delay discussion until after
town hall meetings conclude tomorrow.
"It is a great opportunity for you guys to hear
what students are thinking and how they feel. The
feedback, if it goes nowhere, doesn't mean anything,"
Zimbroff said.
The senate also discussed amending the bylaws to
clarify attendance policy. According to the bylaws,
senators who are absent for three or more meetings
per quarter will automatically have a bill for expulsion
