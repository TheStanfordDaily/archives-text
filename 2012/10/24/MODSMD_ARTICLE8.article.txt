## Judge Fletcher dies at age 89 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Judge Betty Binns Fletcher '43, a former mem
ber of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal best
known for being a trailblazer for women in the legal
profession, died Monday night of natural causes. She
was 89.
"As a woman who broke down many barriers,
your example will be an inspiration for decades to
come," President Jimmy Carter wrote in 2009 to
congratulate Fletcher on her 30th year as a federal
judge. Carter appointed Fletcher to the court in
1979, a post she would keep until her death. She took
senior status in 1996 to open the way for her son,
William Fletcher, to be appointed to the court upon
nomination from President Bill Clinton.
After receiving a bachelor of arts from Stanford
in history at the age of 19, Fletcher went on to attend
University of Washington School of Law, graduating
at the top of her class in 1956. Despite her strong
academic credentials, Fletcher found it difficult to
get a job at a law firm, according to her grandson
Josh Weiner 'O7.
"She spent months and months interviewing with
the big law firms in Seattle, and they wouldn't hire a
woman," Weiner said.
She finally received a job offer from Preston
Gates & Ellis, which has since become K&L Gates.
She became not only the firm's first female partner,
but also one of the first female partners at any major
law firm in the country. Her former partners Jim
Ellis, Bill Gates Sr. and Kari Glover would later
write an op-ed to The Seattle Times to celebrate her
accomplishments in 2009.
"Fletcher has always displayed the pioneering
spirit to speak up for what is right, to challenge per
ceptions about what can be achieved and to break
new ground for the sake of building a more humane
community," they wrote.
During the time she sat on the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, Fletcher was known for being an
influential liberal-leaning judge, authoring opinions
that protected immigration rights, supported affir
mative action and addressed environmental issues.
She is also identified for her work in attempting to
overturn death penalty cases.
"At the end of the day, if you asked her what she
would want her legacy to be, it would be being a
leader for women in law, being a champion for vul
nerable members of society and a voice for justice,"
Weiner said.
He added, however, that despite her well-known
professional life, he cannot help but remember her as
his grandmother first. Two weeks ago, Fletcher offi
ciated Weiner's wedding to his fiancee of seven
years, which was held in Massachusetts.
"It was a miracle," Weiner said. "She was not
doing well the week before our wedding, [and] it was
really unclear if she was going to be able to get on a
plane from Seattle. But she did do it. It meant the
world for us."
Despite officiating the wedding from a wheel
chair, Weiner said Fletcher "completely captivated
the room."
Fletcher is survived by four children and numer
ous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
