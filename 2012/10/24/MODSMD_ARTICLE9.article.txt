## Running under the radar 
### George Chen 
In a nation full of jitterbug running
backs, Stepfan Taylor stands
apart. Coming into the season as
one of the most underrated backs
in college football, Taylor has
been quietly imposing his will on defens
es on a weekly basis. Despite gaining
some national attention after the USC
upset, he has dropped below the radar
for the most part.
But that hasn't taken away from his
high level of performance on the field.
In Saturday's Big Game, the senior
captain put on a show by rushing for a
career-high 189 yards, and in the
process, surpassed Toby Gerhart to
become second on the all-time Stanford
career rushing list.
As Taylor singlehandedly ran down
the clock and demoralized the Cal
defense in the fourth quarter with big
run after big run, no player, coach or fan
in the stadium could deny that he was
taking the game over.
But what exactly is it about Taylor
that makes him an absolute beast?
Sure, he's fast, but he doesn't have
electrifying speed like Oregon's Kenjon
Barner or De' Anthony Thomas. Taylor
might not even be the fastest running
back at Stanford; if it came down to a
footrace, Kelsey Young and Anthony
Wilkerson would almost certainly beat
him.
At 5 feet 11 inches tall and 215
poounds, Taylor isn't the biggest guy on
the field either. He can and will absorb
every hit he takes, but he can't quite
bulldoze over every linemen and line
backers in the way for which Gerhart
became famous.
What makes Taylor a special mining
back is his well-roundedness: he does
everything well and nothing poorly.
When it comes to running the ball,
efficieny is Taylor's game. Rarely will he
be tackled for a loss in a game, and he
has yet to fumble the ball once thise sea
son. For every yard that the offensive
line blocks for him on any given play,
he'll gain an extra yard. And while he
may not be able to knock defenders off
their feet every time, he has no problem
with dragging them along for the ride.
Whether it's barrelling ahead out of the
I-formation or darting past on a draw
play out of the shotgun, Taylor's low
center of gravity virtually guarantees
positive yardage, even when blocks are
missed.
Not only that, but Taylor has also
shown that he's dangerous in the screen
game and his pass blocking has devel
oped tremendously in the last couple
years as well.
Head coach David Shaw will be the
first person to tell you how special
Taylor truly is, even comparing him to
Jacksonville Jaguar tailback Maurice
Jones-Drew. When asked about Taylor
flying relatively under the radar, Shaw
simply replied, "You know who knows
about him? NFL scouts."
Regardless of whether college foot
ball appreciates Taylor's talents or not,
he will probably still be selected in the
third or fourth round of this year's draft
come April.
Taylor has rarely been mentioned in
the Heisman conversation. In truth, the
chances of him clutching the trophy in
December is slim. (Although I don't
really understand how Kansas State's
Colin Klein is now all of the sudden a
frontrunner just because managed to
shred an awful West Virginia second
ary.)
Just as unfortunate is that Barner or
Nevada's Stefphon Jefferson are cur
rently primed to take the Doak Walker
award. After all, it's hard to make a case
against a player who's making viewers
hold their breath every time he touches
the ball and gaining almost seven yards
every carry, or a player who's averaging
156 yards and almost two touchdowns
per game.
Saying that those accolades have no
significance to Taylor would be as silly
as saying that the Heisman Trophy did
n't mean anything to Andrew Luck last
year. But just like his former teammate,
Taylor is completely team-oriented. He
puts in the same amount of effort in
blocking for Josh Nunes on a pass play
as he does in carrying the ball himself.
The legacy that he leaves for Stanford
football isn't one that consists of only
rushing yards and touchdowns; it's his
legacy as a selfless teammate that paral
lels what Luck meant to the program.
It's only fitting then that by the end
of his collegiate career, Taylor will go
down as one of the best running backs,
if not the best running back in school
history and be more than prepared to
embark on a distinguished NFL career.
No, he won't talk about the school
records that will soon fall at his feet. No,
he won't get the national spotlight that
Barner gets every weekend. But he will
continue to be the dependable, special
running back that he is in his own quiet
way.
