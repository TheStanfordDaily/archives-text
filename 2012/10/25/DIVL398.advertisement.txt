CA Health and Safety Code Section 125325: "Egg donation involves a screening process. Not all potential egg donors are selected. Not all selected egg
donors receive the monetary amounts or compensation advertised. As with any medical procedure, there may be risks associated with human egg donation.
Before an egg donor agrees to begin the egg donation process, and signs a legally binding contract, she is required to receive specific information on the known
risks of egg donation. Consultation with your doctor prior to entering into a donor contract is advised."
