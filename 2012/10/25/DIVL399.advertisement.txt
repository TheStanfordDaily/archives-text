Mendelssohn Explained,
with the Saint Michael Trio
Felix Mendelssohn was many things: a painter, a gifted
writer, a capable administrator, and an institution builder.
The world, of course, remembers him as an extraordinary
musician, but here too he was multi-faceted—at once a
composer, conductor, pianist, organist, violinist, and a
tireless promoter of musical causes and other composers.
The Saint Michael Trio will perform—and elucidate— the
second-to-last piece Mendelssohn ever wrote, his Piano
Trio No. 2 in C Minor (Opus 66). In a presentation incorporating
slides and demonstrations of Mendelssohn's compositional
devices, the performers will unfold a work that is magisterial
in scope and shows the composer at the height of his
expressive powers. They will also show that he wrote it
with a sense of impending finality.
