### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
Jonathan Harold Roise, editor in chief of
Volume 149 of The Stanford Daily, passed away on
Oct. 14 after a series of cancer treatments. He
was 67. Roise, who em-oiled at Stanford in 1963,
led The Daily during the Vietnam War, a time of
anti-war and anti-draft protests, teach-ins,
marches, sit-ins and strikes.

An ardent opponent of the war, Roise took a
strong editorial stance in support of protests and
sit-ins, the lights of individual students, free
speech and student liberties. Michael Couzens '6B,
Roise's former roommate and colleague at The
Daily, reminisced about then- regular "discussions
about the anti-war movement, religion and sit
ins."

At Stanford, Roise was a part of Project South,
a radio-documentary group that presented on
KZSU. He also worked closely with a group of
professors who merged religious studies with
matters of social conscience, such as Michael
Novak and Davie Napier, dean at the chapel. He
volunteered for the United Farm Workers and
left Stanford to pursue work in Seattle with
Environmental Works, a nonprofit community
development organization.

In 1990, Roise moved to Managua, the capital
of Nicaragua, to work as the director of the
Quaker Center. He co-founded Si a la Vida, an
organization that aimed to provide street children
with mentorship and structured lifestyles to tran
sition them to autonomous adulthood. The organ
ization went on to open two centers in Nicaragua.
Couzens remembered how he and Roise lived

in a "broken-down boarding house" off campus
during their Stanford years.

"We would have a conference on Sunday and
declare things that we needed to do, like stop
smoking or do the laundry or catch up on doing
homework," Couzens recalled. "There were many
new-leaf weeks."

Roise did not go on to graduate from Stanford.
"I always felt like of all the people I'd known at
Stanford who later become eminent one way or
another... he was a credit to the university as
much as anybody," Couzens said.
Roise is survived by his son, Joshua, and two
siblings. A memorial service is scheduled for 10:30
a.m. on Oct. 27 at Eagle Harbor Church, 105
Winslow Way West, Bainbridge Island, Wash.
