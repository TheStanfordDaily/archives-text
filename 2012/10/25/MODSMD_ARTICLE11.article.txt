In "House staff pay inequity
faces review" (Oct. 24), The Daily
incorrectly reported that some stu
dent staff receive free housing and
meal plans. No house staff mem
bers get free housing or meal plans.

The ailicle also stated that Peer
Health Educators are paid roughly
$2,000 per year. They are in fact
paid $l,OOO per year.
Undergraduate Resident Computer
Consultants are paid between $1,125
and $2,417 per quai'ter. This means
that the maximum RCC salary is
roughly 7/9 of the salai-y of a
Resident Assistant, not 1/4 of the
RA salary as was reported in the
article.

RA salaries are approximately
$9,000 per year depending on the
house, as reported in the article.
However, it was stated in the article
that this is 75 percent of room and
board. In fact, it is less than 75 per
cent. The actual percentage depends
upon exact pay for each house.
The Daily regrets these errors.
