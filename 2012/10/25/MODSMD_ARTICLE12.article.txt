## IN HOSTILE TERRITORY 
### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite its celebrated nickname
of "Soccer Heaven," UC-Santa
Barbara's Harder Stadium is any
thing but heavenly for visiting
teams. Home to soccer nation's
most loyal and dedicated group of
college fans, Harder is notably one
of the most intimidating venues for
opposing players and coaches alike.
This Friday, the Stanford men's
soccer team will try their luck in
the infamous stadium when they
face off against the UC-Santa
Barbara Guachos. Although the
game seems to be an insignificant

out-of-conference matchup, much
more is at stake. If unranked
Stanford can pull off a win against
the Guachos, who are currently No.
25 in the NCAA rankings, they
would be in a good position to make
a run at the NCAA tournament.

Cardinal coach Jeremy Gunn
recognizes the challenges that his
team will face on Friday, noting
that the UCSB soccer program is
one of the best in the country. The
Guachos are currently fifth in the
Big West Conference, but the team
went undefeated through the first
seven weeks of their season, rely
ing heavily on a resilient defense.
UCSB's rookie goalie, Austin

Manser, has a .767 saves average
and five shutouts to his name, rank
ing third in the nation.
Despite their stingy defense and
historical dominance on the West
Coast UCSB has won five Big
West titles in the last five years
Stanford freshman midfielder Ty
Thompson said the Gauchos pedi
gree is mostly mental.
"I'm not really intimidated by
them," Thompson said, "especially
if we play our game. The way we
put pressure on the ball, it makes it
very difficult for the other team, no
matter who they are."

After a difficult 2-1 loss to the
University of Washington this past

weekend, the Stanford team is frus
trated after failing to protect an
early lead. According to Thompson,
"the guys are definitely hungry," so
the key to the UCSB game is to
take advantage of the dynamism
and positive energy from Sunday.
They hope to use their restlessness
to follow through on set pieces, a
marked weakness of the team so
far this season.

E specially maddening is the fact
that Stanford has outshot their
opponents 245 shots to 139 shots
this season, a figure that further
emphasizes the team's baffling
inability to convert their fluid
movement into marks on the score

board.
On Friday, the team will look to
sophomore Zach Batteer, Pac-12
Player of the Week two weeks ago,
and senior Adam Jahn, the team's
leading scorer with eight goals this
season, to finish on corners or free
kicks.

Despite the strong defensive
shape of the men's team, the mid
field will be highly contested. The
Guachos' offense is led by midfield
er Nic Ryan, who leads the UCSB
team in both scoring and assists. As
a result, the Cardinal will rely heav
ily on both Thompson and midfield

er JJ Koval, a solid player who has
consistently helped hold down the
midfield. The men also look to take
advantage of the loss of key UCSB
players Achille Campion and
Machael David.

"The boys have been putting in
a lot of good scoring opportuni
ties," Gunn said. "In soccer, you
can dominate in so many areas, but
if you don't finish your chances,
then you're out a win. The line
between winning and losing is so
fine."
In a showdown between two
strong defensive teams, a draw is
not an option for Stanford. Neither
is a loss if Stanford hopes to main
tain their chance at an NCAA tour
nament run, the team needs to fin
ish their upcoming away game
with a resounding victory, espe
cially considering their 6-7-1
record.
Gunn acknowledged the impor
tance of this Friday, saying that
the game "is a bit like World Cup
finals ... we have to go out and get
results."

After a difficult 2-1 loss to the
University of Washington this past

weekend, the Stanford team is frus
trated after failing to protect an
early lead. According to Thompson,
"the guys are definitely hungry," so
the key to the UCSB game is to
take advantage of the dynamism
and positive energy from Sunday.
They hope to use their restlessness
to follow through on set pieces, a
marked weakness of the team so

E specially maddening is the fact
that Stanford has outshot their
opponents 245 shots to 139 shots
this season, a figure that further

"The boys have been putting in
a lot of good scoring opportuni
ties," Gunn said. "In soccer, you
can dominate in so many areas, but
if you don't finish your chances,
then you're out a win. The line
between winning and losing is so
fine."
