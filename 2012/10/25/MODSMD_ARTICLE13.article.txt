## Wildcats no match for Card 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
On Wednesday, the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team returned home to
Maples Pavilion riding a 16-game winning
streak, matching the Cardinal's longest
streak since 2008.
Just three sets later, Stanford dispatched
the Arizona Wildcats and stretched their
streak to 17.

The Wildcats (12-10, 4-7 Pac-12) entered
their showdown with the Cardinal having
won three of their last four matches, an
impressive turnaround after a five-game los
ing streak. Unfortunately for Arizona fans, it
didn't take long for them to return to their
losing ways.
The Cardinal (19-2,11-0) beat Arizona 3-
1 in Tuscon in their last meeting, and was
able to do one better this time around, win
ning 25-19, 25-18, 25-20.
The first set began relatively back-and
forth, with both teams putting together
large runs, but neither gaining an advantage
over the other. With the teams locked at 12-
12, Stanford finally seized control with four
straight kills. The deficit proved too large to
overcome, as the Cardinal took the first set
25-19.
Freshman middle blocker Inky Ajanaku
was the star of the set, recording six kills and
three blocks in the set. She finished with 11
kills and four blocks, while hitting .526 on the
match.
The Wildcats came out firing in the sec
ond set, winning four of the first five points.
The Cardinal soon stormed back to tie the
set at four apiece, beginning a back-and
forth volley in which neither side gained an
advantage.
