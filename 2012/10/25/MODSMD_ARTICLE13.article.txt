## Wildcats no match for Card 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
On Wednesday, the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team returned home to
Maples Pavilion riding a 16-game winning
streak, matching the Cardinal's longest
streak since 2008.
Just three sets later, Stanford dispatched
the Arizona Wildcats and stretched their
streak to 17.

The Wildcats (12-10, 4-7 Pac-12) entered
their showdown with the Cardinal having
won three of their last four matches, an
impressive turnaround after a five-game los
ing streak. Unfortunately for Arizona fans, it
didn't take long for them to return to their
losing ways.
The Cardinal (19-2,11-0) beat Arizona 3-
1 in Tuscon in their last meeting, and was
able to do one better this time around, win
ning 25-19, 25-18, 25-20.
The first set began relatively back-and
forth, with both teams putting together
large runs, but neither gaining an advantage
over the other. With the teams locked at 12-
12, Stanford finally seized control with four
straight kills. The deficit proved too large to
overcome, as the Cardinal took the first set
25-19.
Freshman middle blocker Inky Ajanaku
was the star of the set, recording six kills and
three blocks in the set. She finished with 11
kills and four blocks, while hitting .526 on the
match.
The Wildcats came out firing in the sec
ond set, winning four of the first five points.
The Cardinal soon stormed back to tie the
set at four apiece, beginning a back-and
forth volley in which neither side gained an
advantage.

With the game tied at 16-all, jun
ior outside hitter Rachel Williams
entered the game and immediately
made her presence felt. Her kill
started a 9-2 Stanford run that
ended the set in a 25-18 Cardinal
victory. Williams accounted for five
of the nine points herself, with four
kills and a block. She finished with
eight kills and five blocks on the

night, while hitting .412.
Stanford entered the third set
knowing that a victory would
stretch then- win streak to 17, but
the Wildcats refused to go down
without a fight. Arizona won the
first three points and didn't back
down, refusing to relinquish the
lead until freshman outside hitter
Jordan Burgess's back-to-back kills
gave Stanford the 11-10 advantage.
Williams followed Burgess with
two kills of her own, giving the
Cardinal a decisive lead. Stanford
would ultimately take the final set
25-20, causing yet another team to

leave Maples Pavilion in defeat.
The Cardinal was led on offense
by its middle blocking tandem of
Ajanaku and junior Carly Wopat,
who continued her strong play of
late by tallying nine kills and three
blocks while hitting .500.
Stanford only hit .292 on the
match, but was able to put the
Wildcats away through their usual
tremendous defense, holding Arizona
to just .130 hitting. Sophomore
libero Kyle Gilbert continued her
terrific defense, with 18 digs on the
night.
The setter combination of senior

Karissa Cook and sophomore Madi
Bugg had 22 and 18 sets, respec
tively, while contributing eight digs
each.

Ultimately, the game was anoth
er impressive triumph for the
Stanford team, giving it a solid claim
to its No. 2 national ranking. On
Friday, the Cardinal hopes to
extend its win streak against the
Arizona State Sun Devils. The
match will start at 7 p.m. from
Maples Pavilion.
