According to the Senior CLASS Award
website, candidates worthy of recognition
must have notable achievements in four
areas: community, classroom, character and
competition.
With those criteria in mind, it's easy to
understand how Stanford senior Mariah
Nogueira was recently named a finalist for
the 2012 award.

For four years, the holding midfielder has
patrolled the center of Cagan Stadium, prov
ing to be a dominating presence for the
women's soccer team.

"Mariah is a great leader on the field, and
[a] great competitor," said Stanford head

coach Paul Ratcliffe. "She can make plays
and she can win the ball. She's just the heart
in the center of midfield for us."

While nominally a defensive player,
Nogueira contributes plenty to the Cardinal
attack as well. During her career at Stanford,
she has recorded 14 goals and 14 assists for
42 points. Much of that can be attributed to
her prowess in the air; over the past two sea
sons, the 5-foot-8-inch midfielder scored 10
of her 11 goals with her head.

"She's the best header of the ball that I've
ever seen in the college game," Ratcliffe said.
"Both defensive or attacking, she finds the
ball, but I think the special quality is that she
has the ability to score with her head. It's not
just getting up and winning it she can
direct the ball right into the goal."

Nogueira credits her family for develop
ing her heading ability.
"My dad and my dad's mother were huge
soccer players and fans," Nogueira said. "As
a child, my grandmother would literally
throw balls at my head so that I would learn
to head."

During the 2011 season, the early training
paid off in a big moment. In the 88th minute
of a tied game against defending national
champion Notre Dame, Nogueira rose up to
redirect a corner kick for the winning goal. It
was a play that teammates and coaches say
they will never forget.
"She's had a lot of clutch goals in her
career, but one that does stick out is the
