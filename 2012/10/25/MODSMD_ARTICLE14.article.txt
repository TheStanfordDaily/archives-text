# UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT

### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
According to the Senior CLASS Award
website, candidates worthy of recognition
must have notable achievements in four
areas: community, classroom, character and
competition.
With those criteria in mind, it's easy to
understand how Stanford senior Mariah
Nogueira was recently named a finalist for
the 2012 award.

For four years, the holding midfielder has
patrolled the center of Cagan Stadium, prov
ing to be a dominating presence for the
women's soccer team.

"Mariah is a great leader on the field, and
[a] great competitor," said Stanford head

coach Paul Ratcliffe. "She can make plays
and she can win the ball. She's just the heart
in the center of midfield for us."

While nominally a defensive player,
Nogueira contributes plenty to the Cardinal
attack as well. During her career at Stanford,
she has recorded 14 goals and 14 assists for
42 points. Much of that can be attributed to
her prowess in the air; over the past two sea
sons, the 5-foot-8-inch midfielder scored 10
of her 11 goals with her head.

"She's the best header of the ball that I've
ever seen in the college game," Ratcliffe said.
"Both defensive or attacking, she finds the
ball, but I think the special quality is that she
has the ability to score with her head. It's not
just getting up and winning it she can
direct the ball right into the goal."

Nogueira credits her family for develop
ing her heading ability.
"My dad and my dad's mother were huge
soccer players and fans," Nogueira said. "As
a child, my grandmother would literally
throw balls at my head so that I would learn
to head."

During the 2011 season, the early training
paid off in a big moment. In the 88th minute
of a tied game against defending national
champion Notre Dame, Nogueira rose up to
redirect a corner kick for the winning goal. It
was a play that teammates and coaches say
they will never forget.
"She's had a lot of clutch goals in her
career, but one that does stick out is the

Senior midfielder Mariah Nogueira, recently named a finalist for the 2012 Senior CLASS Award, has recorded 14 goals and 14 assists
for 42 points in her Stanford career. Head coach Paul Ratcliffe praised her as the best header of the ball he's ever seen in college.
game we won against Notre
Dame where she scored on a
header," said fellow senior
and tri-captain Rachel Quon.
"That's the kind of pres
ence she has and the com
petitive drive she has,"
Ratcliffe added. "She want
ed to prove that we should
have beat [Notre Dame]
because we lost to them in
the [2OlO College Cup final].
That was a great moment."
Although a top recruit
out of Marina High School in
Westminster, Calif.,
Nogueira wasn't always des
tined for Stanford.
"Stanford wasn't even on
my radar for a while, because
I didn't even think that I
could get in," Nogueira said.
"Then my mom kind of
threw it out there as an
option, and when I heard
that [Ratcliffe] was interest
ed it's really hard to
imagine anyone who has that
opportunity and turns it
down."

Nogueira seized a start
ing role her freshman year
and hasn't given it up since.
"From the beginning of
her freshmen year, she
made a big impact," Quon
said. "I think her presence
on the field is huge. You
always know that she's on
the field and she always
leaves it all on the field."

This past season, Ratcliffe
chose Nogueira as one of three
captains of the team.
"She has great leadership
qualities," Ratcliffe said. "In
fact, she probably could have
been a captain last year as
well, but we always have so
many great leaders here at
Stanford."

Among the numerous
awards accumulated over
her career, Nogueira has
been selected to the NCSAA
All-American third team, the

NSCAA All-Pacific Region
first team and the AU-Pac-10
team. The Cardinal has a
record 87-3-4 over that time,
and won the 2011 National
Championship.

"I think that our team has
a huge amount of respect for
each other, so for them to
pick me and for the coaches
to pick me was really hum
bling," Nogueira said. "I've
always tried to be a leader
by example, but now there's
more of a responsibility to be
a little bit more of a vocal
leader."

Off the field, whether it's
studying, volunteering or
playing the ukulele, Nogueira
also excels. It is this well
rounded success that helped
the senior stand out when
applying for the award.
Nogueira is currently on
track to graduate in 2013
with a degree in psychology.
She also participates in sev
eral other volunteer activities
such as the Special Olympics,
the Bay Area Women's Sports
Initiative and tutoring pro
grams for students in East
Palo Alto.
"The most memorable
[program] was a trip to the
Dominican Republic through
an organization called Kids
Alive," Nogueira said. "That
was a huge eye-opening expe
rience and an opportunity to
be completely selfless and
help others who are less for
tunate."

"I also really enjoyed
when our team tutored in
East Palo Alto my sopho
more year. That was a lot of
fun, since working with kids
is always the best."
Despite her many com
mitments, it's not all work
and no play for the senior.

"I love all outdoor activi
ties. During preseason, we
always go fountain-hopping,
and we went kayaking and
surfing a lot," Nogueira said.
"I also love music. I will do
self-proclaimed jam sessions
with [sophomore midfielder]
Alex Doll. She'll play the

piano and I'll play the
ukulele."
Teammates and coaches
say that Nogueira is some
what shy about her musical
talent.

"I'm actually still waiting
for her to play the ukulele,"
Ratcliffe joked. "I hear she's
pretty good, so I've been want
ing to hear that."

After the close of her
Cardinal career, Nogueira
hopes to continue playing soc
cer.

"[My plans] after gradua
tion are still kind of up in the
air. I'm most likely going to
try to play professionally,
either abroad or here if the
league in the U.S. ends up
working out," Nogueira
explained. "So that's probably
the plan for a year or two,
and hopefully I will continue
with the youth national team
program. Eventually, I will
probably come back to
school for grad school, most
likely in psychology."
In the meantime, Nogueira
has her sights set on a second
consecutive national title.

"Hopefully we can win
another [championship]

that's the ultimate goal,"
Nogueira said. "I'm looking
forward to enjoying every
possible second that I can. I
know everyone says it, but
the girls on your team become
your best friends. I'm going
to miss them a bunch."

"I think it's a great
honor, and it's great that
people are recognizing her
for her talent and all she's
done for Stanford soccer,"
Ratcliffe said. "My hope is
that she can win the award
and represent Stanford."

According to the Senior CLASS Award
website, candidates worthy of recognition
must have notable achievements in four
areas: community, classroom, character and
competition.
With those criteria in mind, it's easy to
understand how Stanford senior Mariah
Nogueira was recently named a finalist for
the 2012 award.

For four years, the holding midfielder has
patrolled the center of Cagan Stadium, prov
ing to be a dominating presence for the
women's soccer team.

"Mariah is a great leader on the field, and
[a] great competitor," said Stanford head

coach Paul Ratcliffe. "She can make plays
and she can win the ball. She's just the heart
in the center of midfield for us."

While nominally a defensive player,
Nogueira contributes plenty to the Cardinal
attack as well. During her career at Stanford,
she has recorded 14 goals and 14 assists for
42 points. Much of that can be attributed to
her prowess in the air; over the past two sea
sons, the 5-foot-8-inch midfielder scored 10
of her 11 goals with her head.

"She's the best header of the ball that I've
ever seen in the college game," Ratcliffe said.
"Both defensive or attacking, she finds the
ball, but I think the special quality is that she
has the ability to score with her head. It's not
just getting up and winning it she can
direct the ball right into the goal."

Nogueira credits her family for develop
ing her heading ability.
"My dad and my dad's mother were huge
soccer players and fans," Nogueira said. "As
a child, my grandmother would literally
throw balls at my head so that I would learn
to head."

During the 2011 season, the early training
paid off in a big moment. In the 88th minute
of a tied game against defending national
champion Notre Dame, Nogueira rose up to
redirect a corner kick for the winning goal. It
was a play that teammates and coaches say
they will never forget.

career, but one that does stick out is the

Senior midfielder Mariah Nogueira, recently named a finalist for the 2012 Senior CLASS Award, has recorded 14 goals and 14 assists

game we won against Notre
Dame where she scored on a
header," said fellow senior
and tri-captain Rachel Quon.
"That's the kind of pres
ence she has and the com
petitive drive she has,"
Ratcliffe added. "She want
ed to prove that we should
have beat [Notre Dame]
because we lost to them in
the [2OlO College Cup final].
That was a great moment."
Although a top recruit
out of Marina High School in
Westminster, Calif.,
Nogueira wasn't always des
tined for Stanford.
"Stanford wasn't even on
my radar for a while, because
I didn't even think that I
could get in," Nogueira said.
"Then my mom kind of
threw it out there as an
option, and when I heard
that [Ratcliffe] was interest
ed it's really hard to
imagine anyone who has that
opportunity and turns it
down."

Nogueira seized a start
ing role her freshman year
and hasn't given it up since.
"From the beginning of
her freshmen year, she
made a big impact," Quon
said. "I think her presence
on the field is huge. You
always know that she's on
the field and she always
leaves it all on the field."

This past season, Ratcliffe
chose Nogueira as one of three
captains of the team.
"She has great leadership
qualities," Ratcliffe said. "In
fact, she probably could have
been a captain last year as
well, but we always have so
many great leaders here at
Stanford."

Among the numerous
awards accumulated over
her career, Nogueira has
been selected to the NCSAA
All-American third team, the

NSCAA All-Pacific Region
first team and the AU-Pac-10
team. The Cardinal has a
record 87-3-4 over that time,
and won the 2011 National
Championship.

"I think that our team has
a huge amount of respect for
each other, so for them to
pick me and for the coaches
to pick me was really hum
bling," Nogueira said. "I've
always tried to be a leader
by example, but now there's
more of a responsibility to be
a little bit more of a vocal
leader."

Off the field, whether it's
studying, volunteering or
playing the ukulele, Nogueira
also excels. It is this well
rounded success that helped
the senior stand out when
applying for the award.
Nogueira is currently on
track to graduate in 2013
with a degree in psychology.
She also participates in sev
eral other volunteer activities
such as the Special Olympics,
the Bay Area Women's Sports
Initiative and tutoring pro
grams for students in East
Palo Alto.
"The most memorable
[program] was a trip to the
Dominican Republic through
an organization called Kids
Alive," Nogueira said. "That
was a huge eye-opening expe
rience and an opportunity to
be completely selfless and
help others who are less for
tunate."

"I also really enjoyed
when our team tutored in
East Palo Alto my sopho
more year. That was a lot of
fun, since working with kids
is always the best."
Despite her many com
mitments, it's not all work
and no play for the senior.

"I love all outdoor activi
ties. During preseason, we
always go fountain-hopping,
and we went kayaking and
surfing a lot," Nogueira said.
"I also love music. I will do
self-proclaimed jam sessions
with [sophomore midfielder]
Alex Doll. She'll play the

piano and I'll play the
ukulele."
Teammates and coaches
say that Nogueira is some
what shy about her musical
talent.

"I'm actually still waiting
for her to play the ukulele,"
Ratcliffe joked. "I hear she's
pretty good, so I've been want
ing to hear that."

After the close of her
Cardinal career, Nogueira
hopes to continue playing soc
cer.

"[My plans] after gradua
tion are still kind of up in the
air. I'm most likely going to
try to play professionally,
either abroad or here if the
league in the U.S. ends up
working out," Nogueira
explained. "So that's probably
the plan for a year or two,
and hopefully I will continue
with the youth national team
program. Eventually, I will
probably come back to
school for grad school, most
likely in psychology."
In the meantime, Nogueira
has her sights set on a second
consecutive national title.

"Hopefully we can win
another [championship]

that's the ultimate goal,"
Nogueira said. "I'm looking
forward to enjoying every
possible second that I can. I
know everyone says it, but
the girls on your team become
your best friends. I'm going
to miss them a bunch."
