## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD In search of Stanford's social currency 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
UT had to take the batteries
I out of my vibrator and put
-Lthem in my calculator for
my midterm." Not going to say
where I overhead that, or from
whom. Besides being funny, the
sentiment here is useful. Even
poetic, one could argue. Identity is
fickle in any twenty-year-old, espe
cially at a place with as many differ
ent social currencies as Stanford.
In some groups, good grades are
currency. In others, how much you
work out is currency. As much as I
hate the fact that this is true, there
are definitely situations on campus
where your looks are currency.
Transitioning between groups
and situations requires more than
changing your clothes or your tone
of voice. It requires personality
shape-shifting to meet competing
and sometimes conflicting expecta
tions and values. When you first
meet your Math 51 study group you
need brains, good grades and a TI
-89 calculator. When you first meet
your roommate's boyfriend and his
fraternity brothers, you need wit,
good looks and a Corona in your
hand. You wouldn't want to tell the
people who only know you as a cal
culator-wielding whiz that the bat
teries are borrowed from your
vibrator.

Sometimes I feel like if I go out
and party I'll be pegged as a "social
person," and if I stay in and study
I'll be pegged as a "serious person."
I have a sense that students are
placed into tidy categories with lit
tle room for flow between them.
The dichotomies don't stop at social
vs. serious either. I feel like if I pro
fess my love for dessert, I can't also
profess my love for healthy foods.
If I like Walt Whitman's poetry
then I can't decide to major in biol
ogy. If I'm a nerd, I can't be cool.
This kind of thinking is a trap,
because the people I know and love
best in the world are cool nerds
who love their Melville and also
love their Heisenberg. They are
passionate about their studies and
also love to go out dancing. They
eat dessert. And they are not hyp-

ocrites because of it: they are whole
people.
It's a terrible thing to cut a per
sonality into little pieces and evalu
ate each bit separately and critical
ly. It misses the point. And it makes
it impossible to live along a spec
trum of being social, being alone,
eating chocolate cake, reading the
news and everything else that
makes up your day-to-day. That
kind of scrutinizing and labeling
distorts the spectrum of human
experience into two antagonistic
extremes. The extremes are a falla
cy in and of themselves, and negate
the reality of a spectrum. Even if
some extremes do exist on campus,
they aren't mutually exclusive,
either.

This is why I love the example of
the vibrator batteries. I don't want
you to get too caught up in the
image of vibrator vs. calculator and
simplify the analogy to mean sex
life vs. school life. The poetic part of
the analogy is the batteries. They
work just the same in both situa
tions. Zooming out, maybe there is
some kind of social currency that
works across your Math 51 study
group and your friend's fraternity
brothers. Or across your friends
from your freshman dorm and your
new friends from junior year. I
would argue that there are several.
Generosity, goodwill, earnestness
and levity for starters. Consistency
of character, but also flexibility and
openness to change.
Identity can shift from situation
to situation, even moment to
moment, and that gives you the
wiggle room to interact with a mul
titude of different people and expe
rience a rich variety of experiences.
Maybe the fluctuating nature of
identity is something not to criti
cize, but to celebrate. You have your
own set of triple-A batteries that
work across any situation you step
into. So don't sweat the categories,
and be resourceful with your bat
teries.

What's your currency? Let Renee
know at rdonovan@stanford.edu.

simplify the analogy to mean sex
life vs. school life. The poetic part of
the analogy is the batteries. They
work just the same in both situa
tions. Zooming out, maybe there is
some kind of social currency that
works across your Math 51 study
group and your friend's fraternity
brothers. Or across your friends
from your freshman dorm and your
new friends from junior year. I
would argue that there are several.
Generosity, goodwill, earnestness
and levity for starters. Consistency
of character, but also flexibility and
openness to change.
Identity can shift from situation
to situation, even moment to
moment, and that gives you the
wiggle room to interact with a mul
titude of different people and expe
rience a rich variety of experiences.
Maybe the fluctuating nature of
identity is something not to criti
cize, but to celebrate. You have your
own set of triple-A batteries that
work across any situation you step
into. So don't sweat the categories,
and be resourceful with your bat
teries.

What's your currency? Let Renee
know at rdonovan@stanford.edu.
