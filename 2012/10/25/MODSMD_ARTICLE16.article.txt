# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Criticizing popular pro-choice justifications 
### Adam Johnson 
Before delving into the sub
stance of this opinion, a few
words are necessary.
Abortion is certainly a complex and
contentious issue, and I want to
devote multiple articles to the topic
to ensure that I provide each of
these distinct, albeit related,
subtopics an adequate treatment.
Accordingly, in this first piece I will
focus on critiquing three popular
justifications for pro-choice policies.
All of the justifications below are
actual quotes from various online
sources. The three justifications I
list here are by no means compre
hensive. I will readily admit that
they are not, in my mind, the
strongest arguments the pro-choice
position has to offer. Rather, they
are commonly cited arguments that
I believe people, regardless of their
ultimate opinion on the legal and
moral status of abortion, should
refuse to accept.
1. "An unwanted life can be
worse than no life at all."
Although whether or not the
fetus is wanted may be a relevant
question for the mother, it should be
irrelevant for justifying abortion
more broadly. Would we allow an
unwanted fetus that is days away
from birth to be aborted? Many
would say no, but then argue that it
is OK to abort an unwanted fetus at
a far earlier point in the pregnancy.
These people are not necessarily
hypocritical; a life can be unwanted
at any time in its development, but
at a certain point society draws the
line and demands that the life be
cared for, regardless of whether or
not it is wanted. Where we draw
this line has nothing to do with
whether the life is wanted, but
rather how we reconcile the rights
of the mother with the rights (if
any) of the fetus.
If one justifies abortion on the
grounds that an unwanted life can
be worse than no life at all, then one
should view some abortions
those that involve severely unwant-

Ed fetuses as more justified than
others. One should also hold that
those who will be unwanted by soci
ety should be aborted, all other
things equal, at greater rates. Some
go to these lengths and justify abor
tions by citing the socioeconomic
benefits they create for society:
lower populations, fewer disabled
children in need of medical atten
tion, lower crime rates and more. I
would imagine, however, that not
many current pro-choice advocates
embrace these positions, and for
good reason; they represent utili
tarian approaches to what many
perceive as a fundamental human
right. Under the utilitarian
approach, an abortion that involves
a fetus who would be born into a
desirable environment is less justi
fied. This scenario is not a mere
hypothetical; Nazi Germany legal
ized abortions for everyone but
healthy "Aryan" females.
2. "We cannot have some peo
ple forcing their beliefs on us all."
Yet this is precisely one of the
functions of the modern state.
Think about seat belt laws, compul
sory school attendance, trans fat
bans, conscription and the countless
other examples of paternalistic gov
ernment. In these cases, a govern
ing body composed of "some peo
ple" imposes their beliefs on every
one else. Government, then, clearly
can force some people's beliefs on
others. Which triggers the ques
tion: should a government be
allowed to do so? Political philoso
phers have been discussing this
question for centuries, with most
agreeing that in an ideal society, cit
izens give up certain freedoms to
the state.

Although we may not be able to
expertly defend our vision for the
proper role of government, we
should at least be consistent in how
we regard government interven
tions into the personal sphere; if we
make certain exceptions, we
should provide strong rea
sons for doing so.
Unfortunately, much of the
current discourse around the
role of the state in cases of
abortion starts and ends with
"my body, my choice." That
slogan is a fine rallying call,
but as a generalized political
philosophy it necessarily
opposes many widely accept
ed left-wing policies and inns
counter to the trend of larger
government.

3. "If abortion is crimi
nalized, a lot of women will

still seek abortions."
This is a pragmatic argu
ment to support legal abor
tions at this moment in time.
It does not, however, say
why the right to an abortion
should be a legal right, or
why we should favor legal
ized abortions in general. If
you are staunch advocate of
gun control, would you
change your position if
someone told you that peo
ple would still purchase
assault rifles if they were
criminalized? You probably
wouldn't.
Rather than bind the dis
cussion with present facts
and realities, we should
instead ask ourselves what
an ideal world might look like
and try to promote measures

to realize that end. In an
ideal world, might abortions
rarely be needed? What if we
could lessen the primary
stressors for abortion and/or
give significant financial and
emotional support to preg
nant mothers who opt to
have children in the face of
hardship? What if we could
increase access to sexual
education and contraception?
I would argue that the status
quo is not ideal; abortion for
many is a "choice" between a
bad outcome and a worse
one. Yet the above argument
does nothing to argue
against the status quo —if
anything, it tolerates it.

I would argue that the status
quo is not ideal; abortion for
many is a "choice" between a
bad outcome and a worse
one. Yet the above argument
does nothing to argue
against the status quo —if
anything, it tolerates it.

Before delving into the sub
stance of this opinion, a few
words are necessary.
Abortion is certainly a complex and
contentious issue, and I want to
devote multiple articles to the topic
to ensure that I provide each of
these distinct, albeit related,
subtopics an adequate treatment.
Accordingly, in this first piece I will
focus on critiquing three popular
justifications for pro-choice policies.
All of the justifications below are
actual quotes from various online
sources. The three justifications I
list here are by no means compre
hensive. I will readily admit that
they are not, in my mind, the
strongest arguments the pro-choice
position has to offer. Rather, they
are commonly cited arguments that
I believe people, regardless of their
ultimate opinion on the legal and
moral status of abortion, should
refuse to accept.
1. "An unwanted life can be
worse than no life at all."
Although whether or not the
fetus is wanted may be a relevant
question for the mother, it should be
irrelevant for justifying abortion
more broadly. Would we allow an
unwanted fetus that is days away
from birth to be aborted? Many
would say no, but then argue that it
is OK to abort an unwanted fetus at
a far earlier point in the pregnancy.
These people are not necessarily
hypocritical; a life can be unwanted
at any time in its development, but
at a certain point society draws the
line and demands that the life be
cared for, regardless of whether or
not it is wanted. Where we draw
this line has nothing to do with
whether the life is wanted, but
rather how we reconcile the rights
of the mother with the rights (if
any) of the fetus.
If one justifies abortion on the
grounds that an unwanted life can
be worse than no life at all, then one
should view some abortions
those that involve severely unwant-

Ed fetuses as more justified than
others. One should also hold that
those who will be unwanted by soci
ety should be aborted, all other
things equal, at greater rates. Some
go to these lengths and justify abor
tions by citing the socioeconomic
benefits they create for society:
lower populations, fewer disabled
children in need of medical atten
tion, lower crime rates and more. I
would imagine, however, that not
many current pro-choice advocates
embrace these positions, and for
good reason; they represent utili
tarian approaches to what many
perceive as a fundamental human
right. Under the utilitarian
approach, an abortion that involves
a fetus who would be born into a
desirable environment is less justi
fied. This scenario is not a mere
hypothetical; Nazi Germany legal
ized abortions for everyone but
healthy "Aryan" females.
2. "We cannot have some peo
ple forcing their beliefs on us all."
Yet this is precisely one of the
functions of the modern state.
Think about seat belt laws, compul
sory school attendance, trans fat
bans, conscription and the countless
other examples of paternalistic gov
ernment. In these cases, a govern
ing body composed of "some peo
ple" imposes their beliefs on every
one else. Government, then, clearly
can force some people's beliefs on
others. Which triggers the ques
tion: should a government be
allowed to do so? Political philoso
phers have been discussing this
question for centuries, with most
agreeing that in an ideal society, cit
izens give up certain freedoms to
the state.

Although we may not be able to
expertly defend our vision for the
proper role of government, we
should at least be consistent in how
we regard government interven
tions into the personal sphere; if we
make certain exceptions, we
should provide strong rea
sons for doing so.
Unfortunately, much of the
current discourse around the
role of the state in cases of
abortion starts and ends with
"my body, my choice." That
slogan is a fine rallying call,
but as a generalized political
philosophy it necessarily
opposes many widely accept
ed left-wing policies and inns
counter to the trend of larger
government.

3. "If abortion is crimi
nalized, a lot of women will

still seek abortions."
This is a pragmatic argu
ment to support legal abor
tions at this moment in time.
It does not, however, say
why the right to an abortion
should be a legal right, or
why we should favor legal
ized abortions in general. If
you are staunch advocate of
gun control, would you
change your position if
someone told you that peo
ple would still purchase
assault rifles if they were
criminalized? You probably
wouldn't.
Rather than bind the dis
cussion with present facts
and realities, we should
instead ask ourselves what
an ideal world might look like
and try to promote measures

to realize that end. In an
ideal world, might abortions
rarely be needed? What if we
could lessen the primary
stressors for abortion and/or
give significant financial and
emotional support to preg
nant mothers who opt to
have children in the face of
hardship? What if we could
increase access to sexual
education and contraception?
