## Setting the record straight on ARP and sexual assault 
### JONATHAN POTO '13 
With 125 reported cases of
sexual assault on the
Stanford campus since
1996, it is easy to make the argu
ment that sexual assault is the most
important challenge we face. Sexual
assault in any shape or form under
mines the ability of our campus to
provide a safe and healthy space for
its students to both live and learn.

One incredibly important tool in
preventing sexual assault at any
university is a fair and comprehen
sive judicial process that (1) encour
ages those with legitimate sexual
assault cases to come forward, (2)
rightly identifies those who are
guilty and (3) delivers punishment
against perpetrators that gives at
least a semblance of justice and clo
sure to the victim. Without such a
system, Stanford cannot hope to be
credible in its commitment to stu
dents, especially women, to take
every case of sexual assault serious
ly-

The Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for sexual assault cases was
created in April 2010 with the inten
tion of addressing these challenges.
The new ARP protected victims and
the accused from cross-examina
tion. A year later, President
Hennessy strengthened the ARP
when he responded to the U.S.
Department of Education's "Dear
Colleague" letter by lowering the
standard of guilt in ARP cases from

"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"preponderance of evidence" or,
roughly speaking, "more likely to be
guilty than not."
Since these landmark decisions,
the ARP has been subject to a num
ber of important changes and to
many criticisms some valid,
some absurd. One of the most trou
blesome criticisms has been that of
the lowered standard of guilt in
ARP cases. Former ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2, for
example, pointed to the potential
for a party found guilty in an ARP
case to sue the University for violat
ing students' legal protections as
stipulated by the ASSU
Constitution. This argument is false
and encourages a bad policy of
returning ARP cases to the
"beyond a reasonable doubt" bench
mark.

As Cruz himself stated, the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997
empowers the University President
to override the ASSU Constitution
under "extraordinary circum
stances." It is clear that the Dear
Colleague letter, as a federally
endorsed legal position that
requires Stanford to lower its bur
den of proof in sexual assault cases
on the basis of Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972,
and by extension threatens to cut
federal funding to Stanford, creates
an extraordinary circumstance.

Others, such as the Foundation for
Individual Rights in Education
(FIRE), have argued that Stanford
should stand up to the U.S.
Department of Education because
this Title IX argument is flawed and
the burden of proof is too low. I dis
agree.

Title IX is intended to prevent a
person, on the basis of sex, from
being "excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or subject
ed to discrimination under any edu
cation program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance." The
reality of sexual assault is that this
issue disproportionally affects
women; according to the U.S
Department of Justice, a woman
was more than three times more
likely to suffer rape or sexual
assault than a man in the years
between 1993 and 2008.

Furthermore, when considering
Stanford's judicial system, one must
contextualize it within our own legal
system. While criminal cases
demand evidence to prove guilt
"beyond a reasonable doubt," civil
courts often allow "preponderance of
evidence" as sufficient cause for guilt.
A famous example is O.J. Simpson,
who was found liable (read: guilty) in
civil suit for the wrongful death of
Ron Goldman on the basis of "pre
ponderance of guilt."
A university legal system is a far
weaker judicial authority than a
civil court. Since a university lacks
the power to impose punitive dam
age, students can choose to drop out
should they be charged with a fine,
injunction or other punishment.
Stanford's judicial processes should
therefore be free to adjudicate by an
even lower standard for example,
that of "substantial evidence."

Ultimately, the big picture in the
upcoming ASSU town meetings and
all future debates on sexual assault
judicial processes should be that the
ARP, combined with the lower "pre
ponderance of evidence" bench
mark, has contributed toward sig
nificant progress in improving our
university's response to sexual
assault. This is particularly true in
the realm of moving victims of sexu
al assault who report these offenses
on a path to gain justice through the
University's own judicial system.

This is a measurable fact. Out of
21 reported incidences between
2009 and today, 12 made it to hear

ings, as compared to only three
cases going to judicial hearings out
of the 104 reported in the thirteen
years prior. Maintaining a reason
able standard of guilt is essential to
continuing this trend.
There are a number of other,
more important issues to be consid
ered in the debate over ARP,
among them the exceedingly low
number of reported sexual assault
cases. An April 2012 study by
Stanford's Health Promotion
Services found that 360 out of 4000
(9 percent) students on campus
reported having being sexually
assaulted at Stanford. The number

of incidents reported, however,
remains fewer than 10 per year,
nearly the same pace as before the
installation of ARP. Debates over
the definition of guilt are unneces
sary and detract from discussion
and progress in other areas of the
sexual assault judicial review
process.

Finally, I want to take on those
who say this lowered standard is
unfair to the accused. Ultimately, I
believe that Stanford students are
able bear the responsibility of act
ing in a manner that does not any
where approach that benchmark of
preponderance of evidence of a sex

ual assault. We should hold our
selves to high standards, rather
than be concerned about our free
dom to act irresponsibly in situa
tions where there is legal uncertain
ty regarding our sexual interactions
with others.

The strength of our anti-assault
judicial processes depends on their
consequences being credible.
Reinstating standards deemed
legally unjust under Title IX would
undermine that credibility, both as
a preventative tool and as a means
of seeking justice.

assault in any shape or form under
mines the ability of our campus to
provide a safe and healthy space for
its students to both live and learn.

One incredibly important tool in
preventing sexual assault at any
university is a fair and comprehen
sive judicial process that (1) encour
ages those with legitimate sexual
assault cases to come forward, (2)
rightly identifies those who are
guilty and (3) delivers punishment
against perpetrators that gives at
least a semblance of justice and clo
sure to the victim. Without such a
system, Stanford cannot hope to be
credible in its commitment to stu
dents, especially women, to take
every case of sexual assault serious
ly-

The Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for sexual assault cases was
created in April 2010 with the inten
tion of addressing these challenges.
The new ARP protected victims and
the accused from cross-examina
tion. A year later, President
Hennessy strengthened the ARP
when he responded to the U.S.
Department of Education's "Dear
Colleague" letter by lowering the
standard of guilt in ARP cases from

"beyond a reasonable doubt" to
"preponderance of evidence" or,
roughly speaking, "more likely to be
guilty than not."
Since these landmark decisions,
the ARP has been subject to a num
ber of important changes and to
many criticisms some valid,
some absurd. One of the most trou
blesome criticisms has been that of
the lowered standard of guilt in
ARP cases. Former ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2, for
example, pointed to the potential
for a party found guilty in an ARP
case to sue the University for violat
ing students' legal protections as
stipulated by the ASSU
Constitution. This argument is false
and encourages a bad policy of
returning ARP cases to the
"beyond a reasonable doubt" bench
mark.

As Cruz himself stated, the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997
empowers the University President
to override the ASSU Constitution
under "extraordinary circum
stances." It is clear that the Dear
Colleague letter, as a federally
endorsed legal position that
requires Stanford to lower its bur
den of proof in sexual assault cases
on the basis of Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972,
and by extension threatens to cut
federal funding to Stanford, creates
an extraordinary circumstance.

Others, such as the Foundation for
Individual Rights in Education
(FIRE), have argued that Stanford
should stand up to the U.S.
Department of Education because
this Title IX argument is flawed and
the burden of proof is too low. I dis
agree.

Title IX is intended to prevent a
person, on the basis of sex, from
being "excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or subject
ed to discrimination under any edu
cation program or activity receiving
federal financial assistance." The
reality of sexual assault is that this
issue disproportionally affects
women; according to the U.S
Department of Justice, a woman
was more than three times more
likely to suffer rape or sexual
assault than a man in the years
between 1993 and 2008.

Furthermore, when considering
Stanford's judicial system, one must
contextualize it within our own legal
system. While criminal cases
demand evidence to prove guilt
"beyond a reasonable doubt," civil
courts often allow "preponderance of
evidence" as sufficient cause for guilt.
A famous example is O.J. Simpson,
who was found liable (read: guilty) in
civil suit for the wrongful death of
Ron Goldman on the basis of "pre
ponderance of guilt."
A university legal system is a far
weaker judicial authority than a
civil court. Since a university lacks
the power to impose punitive dam
age, students can choose to drop out
should they be charged with a fine,
injunction or other punishment.
Stanford's judicial processes should
therefore be free to adjudicate by an
even lower standard for example,
that of "substantial evidence."

Ultimately, the big picture in the
upcoming ASSU town meetings and
all future debates on sexual assault
judicial processes should be that the
ARP, combined with the lower "pre
ponderance of evidence" bench
mark, has contributed toward sig
nificant progress in improving our
university's response to sexual
assault. This is particularly true in
the realm of moving victims of sexu
al assault who report these offenses
on a path to gain justice through the
University's own judicial system.

This is a measurable fact. Out of
21 reported incidences between
2009 and today, 12 made it to hear

ings, as compared to only three
cases going to judicial hearings out
of the 104 reported in the thirteen
years prior. Maintaining a reason
able standard of guilt is essential to
continuing this trend.
There are a number of other,
more important issues to be consid
ered in the debate over ARP,
among them the exceedingly low
number of reported sexual assault
cases. An April 2012 study by
Stanford's Health Promotion
Services found that 360 out of 4000
(9 percent) students on campus
reported having being sexually
assaulted at Stanford. The number

of incidents reported, however,
remains fewer than 10 per year,
nearly the same pace as before the
installation of ARP. Debates over
the definition of guilt are unneces
sary and detract from discussion
and progress in other areas of the
sexual assault judicial review
process.

Finally, I want to take on those
who say this lowered standard is
unfair to the accused. Ultimately, I
believe that Stanford students are
able bear the responsibility of act
ing in a manner that does not any
where approach that benchmark of
preponderance of evidence of a sex

ual assault. We should hold our
selves to high standards, rather
than be concerned about our free
dom to act irresponsibly in situa
tions where there is legal uncertain
ty regarding our sexual interactions
with others.

The strength of our anti-assault
judicial processes depends on their
consequences being credible.
Reinstating standards deemed
legally unjust under Title IX would
undermine that credibility, both as
a preventative tool and as a means
of seeking justice.
With 125 reported cases of
sexual assault on the
Stanford campus since
1996, it is easy to make the argu
ment that sexual assault is the most
important challenge we face. Sexual
