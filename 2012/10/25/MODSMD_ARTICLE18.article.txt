# I WANT TO GO TO THERE
## The 						day after the election 
### Annie Graham 
The last presidential debate
concluded on Monday. Both
candidates accomplished what
they needed to accomplish: Obama
mentioned the word "women"
seven times, according to the
debate transcript, while Romney
mentioned the word once, and it
was successfully not preceded by
"binders full of." The candidates
repeatedly avoided discussing for
eign policy. We all came away with
advanced knowledge of "horses and
bayonets," and the major news net
works got to show their mastery of
Twitter, rapid-fire exit polls and cor
nering rooms full of voters.
This was just a drill. We'll be
ready for Nov. 6.

The moderator ended the debate
with a quote from his mom, "Go
vote. It will make you feel big and
strong."
I agree. Go vote! I hope that you
care enough to vote. Stanford stu
dents are from all over the country
send your early ballots far and
wide back to where you're regis
tered, or walk down the street to
vote in California. Students who
cannot vote in a U.S. election,
encourage friends to vote; you've
had to suffer through a bitter elec
tion season just the same.
And for all of us, we should be
assured that Nov. 6 is just the
beginning.
If you watch the results arrive
for local and national elections, a
roller coaster of emotions will fol
low: ballot propositions and local
candidates and the presidency, oh
my! If we're really lucky, CNN will
bring back the hologram feature for
a day, unifying us all to care about
something distinctly peripheral to
the actual election results.

But amidst all the yelling and
giant touch-screen graphics, a pres

ident will be elected, and he will
make decisions that affect the whole
world. This one guy will not imme
diately make those decisions, nor
will his opinions on them remain the
same over time; after all, he has 535
other elected officials to confer with
in Washington, D.C. Bipartisanship
hasn't been a big theme this election
season, but it is still a noble goal to
connect reasonable voices across
political parties.
This opinion surely comes from
having a foot in the camps of both
major parties; the right one has
been at home in Phoenix for 20
years, while I've been stepping in
the left one more and more at
Stanford.
My convention-watching experi
ence is a good indicator of this situ
ation.
Because I'm part of a family of
Republicans, I watched the entire
Republican National Convention
this year. Partly because I'm a
young, queer college student, and a
woman (pander to me, dammit!), I
watched the Democratic National
Convention as well. Neither one dis
appointed. By which I mean, both
conventions were gung-ho
American, red, white, and blue, rock
music bonanzas designed to show
commitment to a thriving American
spirit.
I watched both conventions with
a television audience cheering their
own party Republicans cheering
for leaders who promised to "make
the hard decisions," and Democrats
cheering for leaders who promised
to make, well, the other "hard deci
sions."
My Republican family members
got chills when certain points from
the RNC rang true; the Democrats
I sat with were nearly brought to
tears by stories from Democratic

leaders. I don't pretend to be the
only impartial and insightful party
here both groups also offered
critiques and occasional disap
proval. I just happen to be the
omniscient narrator of this particu
lar story.
But I found it incredibly inter
esting to see both groups of voters
wooed by unabashedly partisan talk
because I greatly respect both of
them, and I know they've thought
long and hard about what they
think. They're older and wiser, and
know their swooning will be
checked by the gridlock of the polit
ical process.
That is not to say politicians are
just useless cogs. The result of the
presidential election will have very
serious consequences, and I am not
trying to negate that. What I am
saying is this: thoughtful people
exist within both major parties.
Those thoughtful people will neces
sarily function in the political struc
ture, and fight for their constituen
cy. Constituencies will continue to
fight, either through avenues of the
government or not, for the issues
closest to their hearts. Others will
continue to agitate the process and
spur dialogue, reminding everyone
that there is much more to consider
than the platforms of the two major
parties.
And so the political process con
tinues, whether or not your chosen
candidate is in the highest office. On
the morning of Nov. 7, we will eval
uate the election results, reorient
our political tactics, and move
ahead.
That being said, none of this is
decided yet, and the old ladies at the
polls are waiting for you. Go vote!
