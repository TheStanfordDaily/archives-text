The Cardinal men and women will run for
pride this weekend at the Robinson Ranch
Golf Course in Santa Clarita, Calif, for the
Pac-12 Cross Country Championships. The
Cardinal will be looking to build on its suc
cess from two weeks ago at the Wisconsin
Invite, as this competition is one of Stanford's
final two meets before the NCAA West
Regional meet.

The women's 6k race is scheduled to start
at 9:40 a.m., and it should be a close team
race. The competition will probably be decid
ed among the top-10 team competing:
Oregon (No. 3), Stanford (No. 4), Arizona
(No. 5) and Washington (No. 6). Still, any of
the other eight teams may be play spoiler,
including defending champion, Colorado,
currently ranked No. 21.

In the individual race, Stanford senior
Kathy Rroeger, coming off a fifth-place finish
in Madison two weeks ago, will be one of the
prime contenders, as she has been runner-up
at this meet each of the last two years.
Kroeger's main competition will include
Oregon seniors Alexi Pappas and Jordan
Hasay, who both had top-five finishes at the
NCAA Pre-Nationals meet, and Washington
junior Katie Flood, who is the defending
champion but finished 29th at Wisconsin.

Also in the mix will be Arizona junior Elvin
Kibet and California sophomore Kelsey
Santisteban.
The men's 8k scheduled for 10:40 a.m.,
also looks be a tightly contested team compe
tition. The major contenders figure to be No.
3 Stanford, No. 8 Oregon and No. 2 Colorado,
the defending champion.
The individual title may once again be
decided between the dominant Arizona duo
of sophomore Lawi Lalang, the defending
champion, and senior Stephen Sambu. But
other top runners will factor in as well,
including Stanford sophomores Jim Rosa and
Joe Rosa, Colorado junior Jake Hurysz and
Oregon senior Trevor Dunbar.
This year, the men's and women's races will
be aired on television for the first time, albeit
with a tape delay, on the Pac-12 Networks. Live
results will be provided at http://champi
onships.pac-12.c0m/cross-country.
Overall, this meet will be a great opportu
nity for the Cardinal to gauge where it stands
nationally, since several top teams are com
peting. And the conference championship will
be one last chance for Stanford runners to
get some confidence before the NCAA
Championships arrive.
