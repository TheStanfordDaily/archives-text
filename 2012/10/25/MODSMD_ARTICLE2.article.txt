# Students discuss ARP as vote approaches
## 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Faculty Senate action on the
Alternative Review Process (ARP)
cannot be taken until the ASSU leg
islative bodies pass a bill on it,
University officials confirmed
Wednesday
About 50 undergraduate students
attended Wednesday's town hall on

the ARI? the second of two sessions
co-hosted by the ASSU Executive
and the Office of Community
Standards (OCS), which oversees
ARP proceedings.

Senior University Counsel Lauren
Schoenthaler also confirmed that the
ARP was currently operating on
University President John
Hennessy's power to intervene in
judicial affairs in "extraordinary cir

cumstances." However, she main
tained that although the ARP does
violate the rights-of-the-accused pro
vision of the ASSU Constitution, any
contract is unenforceable if the con
tract violates federal law. The
University has interpreted a failure to
extend the ARP as a violation of the
Dear Colleague letter, thus making
the constitutional provision unen
forceable.

"We're compelled by law to [disre
gard the ASSU Constitution],"
Schoenthaler said. 'Actually, I would
turn the question around and say
'Gosh, ASSU, aren't you worried that
the federal government is going to
come talk to you about the fact that
your constitution conflicts with Title
IX?"'

Both forums were entirely infor
mational; beyond what was implied by

the intonation of questions, no student
directly expressed an opinion about
any of the ARP's provisions.
"It was a very educational night,
and I think that was the right way to
go," ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 said. "I'm glad it didn't
turn into strictly voicing whatever
opinion you came in the room with,
because I think there were a lot of
questions that might have helped peo
ple form more informed opinions."
Only one graduate student who
was not affiliated with ASSU legisla
tive bodies attended the graduate
community forum on TUesday. Also in
attendance were three representa
tives from the University, one mem
ber of the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) and three representatives
from the ASSU Executive. The
forum lasted 20 minutes.

"I think graduate [students] are
generally harder to get to a physical
location," Zimbroff said. "Graduate
representatives were telling me...
[that] we can do a better job soliciting
input by email, which we will do."
Wednesday's undergraduate
forum lasted for well over an hour,
featuring a full presentation about the
ARP by OCS Associate Director
Jamie Pontius-Hogan.
Pontius-Hogan confirmed that the
ARP will continue in its current form
until it is approved or rejected by the
Faculty Senate. However, the
Undergraduate Senate and GSC
must pass a bill on ARP before it can
be submitted to the Faculty Senate
for review. Last year's
Undergraduate Senate deferred
their decision to this year's senators,
who have in turn delayed discussions
until after this week's town halls.
When a student asked what would
happen if the Faculty Senate rejects
the ARR Pontius-Hogan said she
"wasn't prepared to answer that
question yet."
Previously, Zimbroff had stated
that he hoped the town halls would

engage people in discussions about
the ARP who would not have other
wise shown interest in the process.
"We did try to reach out to people
across campus, in eveiy comer, and I
hope that they came," Zimbroff said.
Several students who attended
said they appreciated the chance to
ask questions and learn more about
the process.
"I'm really glad to see so many
people here, because a lot of the
debate around this hasn't seemed
informed," Leanna Keyes 'l4 said.
"For example, I didn't know the
extent to which Title IX impacted
this, and the fact that it's not even an
option to go back to the standard we
used before [we used] preponderance

of the evidence... really informs this
debate for me."

Sarah Roberts 'l5, who works at
the Women's Community Center, said
she believes the ARP is important
because it is both less traumatizing
for victims and brings assailants to
justice.
"Two-thirds of rapists will rape
again, [so] it's really a matter not of
my personal safety but also of com
munity safety," she said.
Zimbroff and Pontius-Hogan
encouraged students to give feedback
via the online forms on the ASSU and
the OCS websites.
