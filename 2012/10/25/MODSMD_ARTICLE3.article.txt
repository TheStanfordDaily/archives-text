## Library budget bounces back 
### TAIWON KIM 
Following sharp budget cuts during the global economic reces
sion, Stanford's libraries will experience their first significant
funding increase this academic year. The University allocated an
additional $1 million to the $19.5 million library materials budget,
the fund that supports the libraries' collection of academic
resources.
Although the increase in fixnds has different implications for
different collections, the addition will enable the library system to
recover some of its lost purchasing power.
Libraries experience setback
From 2009 to 2011, the University slashed Stanford
University Libraries and Academic Information Resources'
budget by 10 percent, while money from donors to the libraries
also decreased by 15 percent. At the same time, book and journal
prices steadily increased as well, adding to the fiscal difficulties.
Libraries at peer institutions, such as Harvard and Yale, also
experienced cuts, according to Zachary Baker, head of collection
development in the humanities and social sciences. While the
reductions were not devastating, they demanded a more judicious
allocation of funds.
To avoid impacting book collections, the libraries chose to cut
out most of their discretionary funding, including allowances for
professional travel. They also reduced staffing by roughly 20 per
cent, laying off 32 foil-time employees.
"That was a very painful thing to do, but we did everything we
could to try to protect the collection budget," said Robert
Schwarzwalder, associate university librarian for the science and
engineering libraries. "For a lot of people, especially doing
research, this is really a key component.... We take that very seri
ously"
Annette Keogh, curator for British and American literature,
said that while the budget cuts did not have a large impact on cur
rent publications and major novels, they did significantly affect
special purchases, such as the acquisition of rare books.
"We felt constrained in our ability to acquire the full range of
materials and resources that we had been able to do through 2008-
09," Baker said. "We had to be more selective."
According to Schwarzwalder, this year's increase in funds has
allowed the libraries to bolster collections in the sciences that had
suffered in previous years as a result of the recession.
Keogh said, however, that extra funds will only result in a 3.42
percent budget increase in her field of specialty
"It's not a huge increase in funds," she said. "If you look at
book and serial prices, they are also increasing at that level, if not
more, so it's equivalent to a cost-of-living adjustment."
The selection process
Stanford's libraries rely on 45 subject specialists, each of whom
cooperates closely with their corresponding departments to
determine which materials need to be purchased. Routine meet
ings with faculty and surveys of student demand are both part of
this process. Specialists also keep track of the current topics being
researched or taught by faculty members.
"You really keep on top of where the University is going,"
Schwarzwalder said. "There are a lot of trends at Stanford that
are highly interdisciplinary If you look
at engineering— bioengineeiing and
biomedical engineering are big and
growing areas."

The collection on South Asia has
also seen growth in recent years
because scholars of the region have
joined Stanford's faculty. Part of this
burgeoning collection is an electronic
archive of South Asian newspapers,
which was requested by the faculty
However, not all purchases are a
direct result of faculty or student
demand.

For example, Stanford's libraries
have been purchasing various
"writer's papers," according to
Keogh. "Writer's papers" are the
unpublished collection of a writer's
correspondences, journals, notes,
drafts and other personal materials
that provide new insight into a writer.
The papers of Allen Ginsburg and
John Steinbeck, among others, are
owned by the libraries and can be
accessed by anyone in the Stanford
community.
"We [also] buy a lot of small
press American avant-garde poetry
that might not get the kind of read
ership that, say, a popular novel
would," Keogh said. "But, we think...
[somebody might be] interested 50 to
100 years down the line."
Stanford's libraries are also prepar
ing for the fixture by investing in a dig
ital library Due to limitations on physi
cal space on campus, the University is
attempting to shift the collections'
focus from piint to electronic xesoxxrces
wherever feasible.

"This is something especially the
case in the sciences and engineering,"
Baker said.
Reference books in computer sci
ence become outdated very quickly he
said. Having those books in electronic
form can make content updates much
more efficient.
"We're not collecting to make this a
great museum of publications," Baker
said. "We're all about... satisfying the
research and teaching needs of the
entire Stanford community"

Following sharp budget cuts during the global economic reces
sion, Stanford's libraries will experience their first significant
funding increase this academic year. The University allocated an
additional $1 million to the $19.5 million library materials budget,
the fund that supports the libraries' collection of academic
resources.
Although the increase in fixnds has different implications for
different collections, the addition will enable the library system to
recover some of its lost purchasing power.
Libraries experience setback
From 2009 to 2011, the University slashed Stanford
University Libraries and Academic Information Resources'
budget by 10 percent, while money from donors to the libraries
also decreased by 15 percent. At the same time, book and journal
prices steadily increased as well, adding to the fiscal difficulties.
Libraries at peer institutions, such as Harvard and Yale, also
experienced cuts, according to Zachary Baker, head of collection
development in the humanities and social sciences. While the
reductions were not devastating, they demanded a more judicious
allocation of funds.
To avoid impacting book collections, the libraries chose to cut
out most of their discretionary funding, including allowances for
professional travel. They also reduced staffing by roughly 20 per
cent, laying off 32 foil-time employees.
"That was a very painful thing to do, but we did everything we
could to try to protect the collection budget," said Robert
Schwarzwalder, associate university librarian for the science and
engineering libraries. "For a lot of people, especially doing
research, this is really a key component.... We take that very seri
ously"
Annette Keogh, curator for British and American literature,
said that while the budget cuts did not have a large impact on cur
rent publications and major novels, they did significantly affect
special purchases, such as the acquisition of rare books.
"We felt constrained in our ability to acquire the full range of
materials and resources that we had been able to do through 2008-
09," Baker said. "We had to be more selective."
According to Schwarzwalder, this year's increase in funds has
allowed the libraries to bolster collections in the sciences that had
suffered in previous years as a result of the recession.
Keogh said, however, that extra funds will only result in a 3.42
percent budget increase in her field of specialty
"It's not a huge increase in funds," she said. "If you look at
book and serial prices, they are also increasing at that level, if not
more, so it's equivalent to a cost-of-living adjustment."
The selection process
Stanford's libraries rely on 45 subject specialists, each of whom
cooperates closely with their corresponding departments to
determine which materials need to be purchased. Routine meet
ings with faculty and surveys of student demand are both part of
this process. Specialists also keep track of the current topics being
researched or taught by faculty members.
"You really keep on top of where the University is going,"
Schwarzwalder said. "There are a lot of trends at Stanford that
are highly interdisciplinary If you look
at engineering— bioengineeiing and
biomedical engineering are big and
growing areas."

The collection on South Asia has
also seen growth in recent years
because scholars of the region have
joined Stanford's faculty. Part of this
burgeoning collection is an electronic
archive of South Asian newspapers,
which was requested by the faculty
However, not all purchases are a
direct result of faculty or student
demand.

For example, Stanford's libraries
have been purchasing various
"writer's papers," according to
Keogh. "Writer's papers" are the
unpublished collection of a writer's
correspondences, journals, notes,
drafts and other personal materials
that provide new insight into a writer.
The papers of Allen Ginsburg and
John Steinbeck, among others, are
owned by the libraries and can be
accessed by anyone in the Stanford
community.
