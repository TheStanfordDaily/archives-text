## ResEd grants to foster religious dialogue 
### KATIE ZINGHEIM 
The Office of Residential Education
(ResEd) is offering a new source of fund
ing to encourage discussions of religion
and race within dorms. The initiative,
started in collaboration with the Center
for Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity (CCSRE) and the Department
of Religious Studies, allows students and
faculty to apply for up to $1,500 to pay for
events that foster dialogue about racial
and religious issues, according to Steven
Weitzman, a professor of religious stud
ies.

The grants are part of a larger initia
tive proposed by faculty from several
departments to bring together the
CCSRE, the Department of Religious
Studies, and other groups such as The
Center for South Asia and The Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies. The umbrel
la program has been given a grant of
roughly $250,000 from President John
Hennessy's discretionary fund according
to Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to the
president.

Prom the grant, ResEd has been
given $15,000 a year for three years to
offer to students and dorm staff.

Typically, ResEd is in charge of
reviewing and approving proposals for
residential grants. For this program,
Weitzman, who was involved in the cre
ation of the program, said that he and
ResEd decided to create a three-person
committee of faculty involved with the
larger initiative rather than from within
Res Ed.

Because the smaller grants are
focused on residential programming,
there are two resident fellows on the
committee: Weitzman, who is an RF in
Roble Hall, and Geoffrey Baker, an RF in
Larkin. The third member of the com
mittee is ResEd Field Operations Officer
Chris Corces-Zimmerman. ResEd will
retain final approval of grants to the com
mittee.

"I'm really excited to have this oppor
tunity to engage students on these issues
that a lot of them care about but they
don't have organized opportunities to
talk about them, outside their own partic
ular community," Weitzman said.
He said that the types of proposals
that will be accepted are ideas that pro
mote learning and conversation about
cultural and ideological differences, such
as bringing in a guest speaker or going

on a field trip. The money will not go to
proposals that advocate for a specific reli
gion or involve worship.

"There's not a lot of opportunity for
people to talk about religious differences
or talk about questions they might be
struggling with," Weitzman said. "I think
there is a lack of discussion on religion."
According to an email announcing the
new program that Weitzman wrote on
behalf of the CCSRE, Department of
Religious Studies, and the Taube Center
for Jewish Studies, extra consideration
will be given to proposals that are
already receiving funding from other
sources.

This approach is similar to the
process of the President's office discre
tionary spending.

According to Watchtel, the
President's office prefers proposals that
have significant support, and is more
interested in supplementing the funding
of a new program than providing it
entirely. This favors programs that are
likely to succeed beyond the three to five
years that the grant guarantees and is a
precaution against new programs being

associated directly with the
President's office rather than the
departments and faculty imple
menting it.
The three-year grant length for
the new program was described by
both Wachtel and Weitzman as a
sweet spot for this type of new ini
tiative: long enough to work out any
flaws but not long enough to
become a burden in case it fails.

"By limiting [a grant] to three to
five years, it's a good chance to take
a second look to see if the program
is succeeding," Wachtel said. "One
of the things that we're really great
at here is coming up with new
things to do and new ideas. It's
much more difficult to terminate a
program, so what we've built in with
this system is a chance to review
something."

The larger initiative surround
ing the three-year ResEd grants is
focused on global issues.
"[Projects] will hopefully con
nect different departments and
units on campus for the study of and
better understanding of religious
and ethnic conflict around the
globe," Weitzman said.
One of the current projects
under the umbrella program will
focus on the ethnic diversity of
India. Another will look at religion
in Europe, including the rising ten
sions that have accompanied
Muslim immigration.
Weitzman said that developing
an ineorporative worldview in both
dorms and classrooms is the main
goal.
"Stanford produces global lead
ers," he said. "I feel it's important
for them to understand that religion
is really an important part of global
culture."
