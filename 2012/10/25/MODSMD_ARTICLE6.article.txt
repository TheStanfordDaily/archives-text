## Fighting the jargon in science writing 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
Kristin Sainani M.S. '99 Ph.D. 'O2, clinical assistant pro
fessor in health research and policy, is on a campaign
against bad science writing.

"I think scientists really need to know how to write
well," she said. "Why shouldn't [the general public] be able
to understand why research and work is being done?"
Sainani, who was motivated by what she saw as an
excessive amount of jargon and poor writing standards in
the sciences, started a course called Writing in the Sciences
in 2003. This year, she is teaching her class online on
Coursera, a massive open online course (MOOC) platform
founded by Stanford computer science professors. Nearly
30,000 students are signed up for the class online.
"When you're in your own culture of science, you do
develop your own language," she said. "You start using jar
gon because everyone in your own little niche of academia
uses the same jargon."

The scientific community, she feels, has created a self
perpetuating culture of complexity.

"I don't think it's intentional, but that's just the way
things are done. Unfortunately, this creates a situation
where things are hard to read even for scientists."
