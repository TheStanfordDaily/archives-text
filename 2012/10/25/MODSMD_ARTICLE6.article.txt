## Fighting the jargon in science writing 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
Kristin Sainani M.S. '99 Ph.D. 'O2, clinical assistant pro
fessor in health research and policy, is on a campaign
against bad science writing.

"I think scientists really need to know how to write
well," she said. "Why shouldn't [the general public] be able
to understand why research and work is being done?"
Sainani, who was motivated by what she saw as an
excessive amount of jargon and poor writing standards in
the sciences, started a course called Writing in the Sciences
in 2003. This year, she is teaching her class online on
Coursera, a massive open online course (MOOC) platform
founded by Stanford computer science professors. Nearly
30,000 students are signed up for the class online.
"When you're in your own culture of science, you do
develop your own language," she said. "You start using jar
gon because everyone in your own little niche of academia
uses the same jargon."

The scientific community, she feels, has created a self
perpetuating culture of complexity.

"I don't think it's intentional, but that's just the way
things are done. Unfortunately, this creates a situation
where things are hard to read even for scientists."
"If you're going to write for an
audience that is wider than that little
niche, then all those acronyms and
that jargon are going to get in the
way of getting your point across," she
added, jokingly suggesting that the
problem creates job security in the
sciences.

Although the effort seems innocu
ous, Sainani has faced some backlash.
"People worry that you're going to
be less precise, and that you're going
to 'dumb down science,"' she said.

A desire to make her lessons
more widely accessible and a seed
grant from the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning led
Sainani to move her class online this
year.

In the past, she had received
email requests for her class materials
and tried sharing them through
online PowerPoint presentations and
You Tube videos. Wanting to make the
process simpler, she designed a mod
ule-based version of her in-class
course, based on a short video-lec
ture format.

"It took some time to figure out
how to take the material and put it in

these smaller modules to adapt it to
the smaller format," she said. "All my
didactic content is now in modulized
videos...in class, we can do some
actual writing and editing."

Much of her advice to writers is
closer to common sense than
advanced writing techniques.
"When I was a graduate student,
you just learned to write papers by
looking at what was around you," she
said. "Teaching writing formally can
go a long way to teach scientists to
write things that are understandable.
They're very simple tips, but are not
usually taught to scientists."
So far, feedback from students
has been positive.
"I'm more than happy with the ini
tiative," said Carol Croffield, a student
taking the course online. "Professor
Sainani has delivered outstanding lec
tures far exceeding my expectations for
an online course."

With characteristic conciseness,
Sainani summarized the one piece of
advice she has for all technical writ
ers.

"Envision that your audience is
not just the technical person sitting
next to you, and write intending to
show [your work] to a larger audi
ence," she said.
