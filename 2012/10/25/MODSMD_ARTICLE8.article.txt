## Wealthy stay in Calif. despite tax hikes 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
A new joint study between
Stanford and Princeton researchers
shows that California's increases in
taxes on the wealthy have not
caused high net worth individuals to
flee from the state, and in fact coin
cided with slower emigration of mil
lionaires.

This information comes two
weeks before California voters
decide on Proposition 30, a proposal
by Governor Brown to raise income
taxes on those earning more than
$250,000 per year by up to 3 percent
and increase the sales tax by 0.25
percent.
The study was conducted by
Cristobal Young, assistant professor
of sociology, and Charles Varner,
doctoral candidate in sociology at
Princeton. Both researchers are
affiliated with Stanford's Center on
Poverty and Inequality.
Young and Varner examined
whether the California's 2005
Mental Health Services Tax, which
raised the tax rate on income above
$1 million by 1 percent, led to a tax

flight of high earners from the state.
Starting with the question, "Do
changes in California's top income
tax rates lead to changes in the
migration of top incomes?", the
researchers found that millionaires
showed low responsiveness to the
studied tax increases.

'At the most, migration accounts
for 1.2 percent of annual changes to
the millionaire population," the
study states. The remaining 98.8
percent of changes in California's
millionaire population is due to
changes in income levels the
number of individuals attaining or
losing millionaire status.
Using "difference-in-difference
models," the study's authors con
trasted migration trends of wealthy
individuals immune from tax
changes to a group of high-income
earners who felt the impact of the
2005 tax increase.
Their conclusion was that emi
gration did not increase due to the
tax increases, and out-migration
actually declined among millionaires
after the tax's passing. As the study
states, "The highest-income
Californians were less likely to leave

the state after the millionaire tax
was passed."
Varner and Young created a cen
sus of California millionaires using
income tax records from 1994 to
2007.

"California income tax records
provide a virtual census of million
aires, and show when millionaires
enter or exit the state," the study
said. "These data offer a unique con
tribution to the policy discourse on
state taxation of top incomes."
"This new research dispels one
of the most persistent myths about
state tax policy," said Chris Hoene,
executive director of the California
Budget Project, a Sacramento
based think tank, in a statement.
"With California voters turning
their attention to the November bal
lot, this new research undercuts the
claim by opponents of Proposition
30 that this measure's personal
income tax increase, which would
largely affect the top 1 percent, will
drive high earners out of the state,"
he said.
