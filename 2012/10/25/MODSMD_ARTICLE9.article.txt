# NEWS BRIEF
## Engineering professor to share $1.3 million National Science Foundation grant 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marwa Farag 
Oyekunle Olukotun, professor of
electrical engineering and computer
science and director of the Pervasive
Parallelism Laboratory, has received
a $1.3 million grant from the National
Science Foundation (NSF). He will
share the research grant with
Srinivas Aluru, professor of comput
er engineering at lowa State
University, and Wu-chun Feng, asso
ciate professor of computer science
and electrical and computer engi
neering at Virginia Tech.
The project may lead to promis
ing advances in the fields of
genomics and metagenomics.
Olukotun, Aluru and Feng hope to
"develop core techniques and soft
ware libraries to enable scalable,
efficient, high-performance comput
ing solutions" for next-generation
DNA sequencing. According to the
proposal abstract, these software

libraries will be open-source releas
es, and the project will allow train
ing of postdoctoral and graduate
students in "big data analytics and
computer science-driven interdisci
plinary research.
The research project, titled
"Genomes Galore Core Techniques,
Libraries, and Domain Specific
Languages for High-Throughput
DNA Sequencing," is funded under
the NSF Big Data Initiative.

The National Institutes of
Health-supported initiative
announced $l5 million in "funda
mental research" on Oct. 3, with the
aim of developing new ways of using
large data sets to drive progress in
the fields of science and engineering.
"By advancing the techniques and
technologies for data management
and knowledge extraction, these new
research awards help to realize the
enormous opportunity to capitalize
on the transformative potential of
data," said Farnam Jahanian, assis
tant director for NSF's Directorate
for Computer and Information
Science and Engineering.
Olukotun's project is one of the
first to receive this funding.
