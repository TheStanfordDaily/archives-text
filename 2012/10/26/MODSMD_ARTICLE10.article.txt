# IN SEARCH OF A TITLE
## 
### KAMARIA TAYLOR 
The No. 1 Cardinal (14-1-1,8-0)
faces a season-defining weekend
as it heads to Los Angeles to play
the University of Southern
California (5-8-3, 2-4-2) Friday
and No. 2 University of California
Los Angeles (14-0-2, 7-0-1)
Sunday. The matchup with the
Bruins will be the pivotal match in
Stanford's season up to this point:
losing will guarantee that it falls in
the rankings, but winning will
more or less assure a fourth-con
secutive Pac-12 victory.
The match against unranked
USC will be considerably less
challenging for Stanford.
Stanford's record against the
Trojans is a favorable 14-3-3, and
the team has not lost to USC since
2005. Last season, Stanford easily
defeated USC at the Cagan
Stadium 3-0. USC has also strug
gled this season, having failed to
win six of the past seven matches.
Nonetheless, they are a tough
team given that six of the past
seven games ended in either
draws or one-goal results.
"We're definitely not overlook
ing USC," junior goalkeeper
Emily Oliver said. "They always
come to play."
Stanford and UCLA stand
pretty even with an all-time
record of 10-9-3 slightly in favor of
the Cardinal. But in recent years,
Stanford has had the edge, win
ning the past five matches against
UCLA with a total score of 13-2.
UCLA's last victory dates back to
a 1-0 match in October 2008, which
also marks the last time Stanford
lost in the Pac-12, a feat that
equates to 39 undefeated confer
ence games.

Still, Sunday's match will pres
ent grueling competition for the
Card. UCLA remains undefeated
in NCAA Division I this season,
and it has failed to win only once in
conference play with a 0-0 draw

against Washington State. The
Bruins have also only conceded six
goals this season, the fewest in the
nation. Bruins senior Zakiya
Bywaters is the nation's leading
scorer with 11 goals and was an

all-Pac-12 first team selection last
season.

However, Stanford has also
had a mighty season and is well
matched against UCLA. Last
week, the Farm welcomed
Washington State and the
University of Washington, beating
both teams. While the match
against UW was a routine 3-0
shutout, Washington State proved
a tougher battle for the Card.
After going up 2-0 after just 21
minutes with goals from sopho
more Chioma Ãœbogagu and red
shirt junior Courtney Verloo,
Stanford went into halftime tied 2-
2, letting go of a two-goal lead for
the first time since 1999. Senior
captain and leading scorer Mariah
Noguiera provided another clutch
goal in the 62nd minute to assure
victory. Oliver also proved crucial,
coming up with three big saves in
the second half.
After sitting out the first half
of the season due to injury, miss
ing eight matches, Oliver has
come back in top form having
started the past seven matches.
With a career goals against aver
age of .31, Oliver could finish the
season as the best goalkeeper in
Stanford's history.
Another player back from
injury is redshirt junior Courtney
Verloo, who spent all of last season
on the sidelines. Verloo had a
strong weekend against the
Washington schools with two goals
and an assist, achievements that
earned her her first Pac-12 Player
of the Week.
As for this weekend's game
plan, the Card has no significant
changes under way.

Senior Mariah Nogueria (20) scored the game-winner last weekend
against Washington State. Stanford needs her to be on form to knock
off No. 2 UCLA in a de facto Pac-12 title game on Sunday.
"We're just doing the
same thing we've always
done," said freshman for
ward Katie Donahue. "We
really focus on a connecting
game. We try and play a lot
of passes before we go for
ward," Donahue continued.
Following its potentially
title-deciding trip to Los
Angeles, Stanford heads to
Berkeley for a rivalry match
next weekend. No. 21
California is the final game
before the regular season

ends and tournament play
begins.
"Everybody's been
working hard," Oliver said.
"This is the time of the sea
son where it's not the play
offs yet, but it's deep into
conference play."
The Cardinal kicks off
Friday at 7 p.m. at the Los
Angeles Coliseum; there
will be a live audio stream
via gostanford.com. Play
begins against UCLA on
Sunday at 6 p.m. at the
Drake Stadium and can be
watched on the Pac-12
Networks.
