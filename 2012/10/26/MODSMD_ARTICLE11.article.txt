# IT'S AN UPHILL BATTLE
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, Stanford took part in three
blowout games. In each of these matchups, a
team scored at least 14 goals. The problem is
that Stanford was on the losing end of one of
those poundings, a 14-8 conference loss at N0.7
UC-Berkeley.

The loss dropped Stanford (8-4, 2-2 MPSF)
to fourth place in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation and leaves them with an uphill battle
to get to the NCAA tournament. They play two

more MPSF teams this weekend, and while both
opponents are winless in the conference, the
Cardinal cannot afford another slipup.
"We just have to win almost every game from
here on out. So it's kind of a lot of pressure,"
freshman driver Bret Bonanni said.

Stanford was bombarded with six goals from
the MPSF's third-leading scorer, driver Collin
Smith, in that loss to Cal. This week will provide
another test, when the fifth and sixth leading
scorers in the conference come to Palo Alto
wearing the gold and blue of No. 6 UC-lrvine.
Saturday's game against UC-lrvine will be

closely followed by a matchup against No. 10
Long Beach State on Sunday. Both games will
start at noon and take place at Avery Aquatic
Center.
Irvine comes into this game in a very similar
position as Cal's last Saturday, including being 0-
2 in the MPSF. The major difference between
the two is that Irvine's losses have come against
middle-of-the-road teams, while Cal had fallen to
the nation's two best teams.
Irvine is in the midst of a tough streak, hav
ing lost four out of their last six games, including
their first two conference games of the season.
Much of that can be attributed to the team's con
ference-worst defense, which is allowing 8.74
goals per game. In each of their last four losses,
they have allowed at least 10 goals.
Stanford's defense is in need of a pick-me-up
as well, after giving up a season-high 14 goals to
Cal last weekend. The goals seemingly came
from every distance or angle in the pool, making
it impossible to place the blame on a single area
or person.
When asked what the team was focusing on
this week, freshman driver Brett Bonanni noted
that it was clear they needed "just better
defense."
His teammates, likewise, were unable to pin
point any more specialized areas that needed
more work than others, preferring to note that
their problems encompassed the entirety of the
defensive effort.
"Defensively, we've worked on shutting other
teams down," redshirt junior driver lan Gamble

Despite a loss last weekend to Cal, Stanford still has an outside shot at a NCAA Tournament
berth. The Card can't afford to slip up this weekend against UC-lrvine and Long Beach State.
