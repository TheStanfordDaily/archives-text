## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR An end to email interviews 
### 
Effective immediately, The
Stanford Daily will no longer
conduct news interviews via
email.
Our colleagues at The Harvard
Crimson recently announced an
end to allowing quote approval
from Harvard's administration.
Quote approval (allowing sources to
edit quotes and strike some from
the record after the interview) is a
fairly straightforward violation of
journalism ethics and is not
employed by The Daily. However,
email interviews are too similar to
quote approval for comfort.
For at least the past few years,
Daily writers have been strongly
encouraged to do interviews in per
son or over the phone, with email as
a last resort. Unfortunately, this
has led to far too many email inter
views, requested by both writers
and the sources.
In many cases, this is done sim
ply for convenience. However, some
sources also demand email-only
interviews so that they can control
the message more tightly. In all
cases, this leads to reverse quote
approval: because interviewees can
write out exactly what they want
and review it before hitting 'send,'
they can review any and all quotes
before they even reach the
reporters.
By allowing email interviews,
we are failing our readers in our
duty to give them quality journal
ism and not serve merely as a con
duit for community PR.
Obviously, this requires a major
commitment from our staff to
increase training for all reporters
to ensure that they are recording
interviews, safeguarding against

any issues with misquoting. We
understand that many of our
sources, especially professors and
administrators, are extremely
busy; we are requiring reporters to
give sources sufficient notice to
respond to interview requests and
be accommodating with their class
schedules for sources.
In rare circumstances where a
source is out of the country and is
unable to do an interview via Skype
or other technology, the managing
editor of news or editor in chief will
approve email interviews on a case
by-case basis.
We will continue to use email for
simple inquiries, such as data
requests and statements. In the
past, we have attributed all email
responses as "wrote in an email to
The Daily." From now on, we will
treat anything in an email as its
true nature, a press release,
attributing it as "wrote in a state
ment."
We have already discussed this
policy and received very positive
reactions with campus leaders in
Residential Education and
Residential & Dining Enterprises,
two of the departments we inter
view the most.
To our trusted sources, we hope
this is the start of a more personal
relationship as we both work to serve
the community. To our readers, we
hope you see the difference in our
reporting and in the quality of access
we have, as we constantly work to
produce better content for you.

Best,
BILLY GALLAGHER
