# What is diversity?
## 
### Chris Herries 
Affirmative action is a notori
ously difficult subject to think
about, so imagine how hard it
is to write about! Admittedly, I feel
completely torn on this important
and contentious issue. On the one
hand, I support a private universi
ty's right to accept whomever it
wants. It is evidenced, or at least
posited, that diversity is a positive
thing for a college environment, a
veritable boon for all parties
involved. However, it is hard to
deny someone who is more qualified
a position on the basis of race.
Frankly, when I am part of a team
or student group, I am interested in
hard-working, dedicated and moti
vated peers. I could not care less
about a person's race.
The arguments are far more com
plex than my inadequate presenta
tion, but they are not my main con
cern. The question that I want to
drive home is this: What is diversity?
The color of your skin doesn't man
date a cultural heritage and certain
ly does not qualify you as different
from me. My friend and I are of two
different races, but we share many
of the same social, political and eco
nomic concerns. I firmly believe his
race is not what differentiates our
pasts, but rather, his decisions, geog
raphy and family.

Some people will immediately
throw up their hands, perhaps
with good reason, claiming that
race affects all three of those. I am
not a sociologist, so I have no con
crete evidence either way.
However, I do know that in this
country, as much as in any, your
birth is not a determinant of your
future. It may be a predictor, but it
is not a determinant. Likewise, it
is childish to think that all black
people are poor, Latinos foreign or
whites affluent.

I do not have any solid answers
for what does qualify as diversity,
but it is something that institutions
need to address. In my mind at
least, socioeconomic class as an
admissions factor could not only
bridge the race gap, but it could also
supply schools with a greater spec
trum of the American people. In
that way, we would move towards a
university where all strata of socie
ty are represented. Now I imagine
there are sound arguments against
using class as a factor for admis
sions, which I hope will be elaborat
ed in the comments section on The
Daily's website and in conversa
tions across campus.
