# SEEING GREEN
## The
						days of the dead 
### Holly Moeller 
With Halloween just around
the corner, storefronts,
lawn ornaments and gen
eral decor have adjusted to reflect
our temporary obsession with
creepy-crawlies, scary monsters
and, most of all, death.
The latter topic is something
that we, college and graduate stu
dents generally in the prime of our
lives, rarely think about. Then, last
weekend, while standing at the
counter of a BBQ joint, I encoun
tered a particularly graphic rendi
tion of a severed hand. Since I'm a
relatively recent convert to vege
tarianism, I appreciated the
appetite killer, and, much later, the
musings it engendered about the
fate of our bodies postmortem.
Of the friends and family I've
lost, almost everyone has had their
remains handled in one of two
ways: either cremation or a "tradi
tional" funeral, complete with
embalming and a hefty casket.
They've been entombed in pictur
esque cemeteries, or scattered to
the winds in places that they loved.
Recently, however, the "green
washing" that has turned many of
us on to local, organic produce and
given corporations a major market
ing facelift has turned up in funeral
homes as well. But what exactly is a
"green burial," or a "green crema
tion?"

It seems that the common idea
behind both is to reduce the carbon
footprint and environmental dam
age of traditional funeral methods.
It takes carbon dioxide-releasing
energy (usually from methane gas)
to cremate human remains. And
the embalming process, used to
preserve the deceased for viewing
and burial, requires formaldehyde,
a known carcinogen toxic both to
funeral home workers and to the
environment surrounding grave
yards. In this country, each year, we
go through 827,000 gallons of
embalming fluid (the equivalent of
an Olympic-sized swimming pool
more than 8 feet deep).
Additionally, cemeteries in the

United States annually inter 1.6
million tons of concrete and 104,000
tons of steel alongside the bodies
they bury. And many use some
unsavory pesticides and herbicides
to maintain their pristine grounds.
By contrast, the United States
Green Burial Council advocates
simpler methods: avoiding any
preservatives in the preparation of
the body (which may necessitate a
speedier funeral), eschewing
decomposition-resistant contain
ment, and generally facilitating the
return of the body to the earth. In
many respects, these "natural bur
ial" methods represent a return to
the way humans have handled
death for the majority of our
species' existence; only in relatively
modern times have we resorted to
elaborate contrivances to preserve
the physical form of the deceased.
(There are, of course, notable cul
tural exceptions, like the
Egyptians.)

Then there's the so-called
"green cremation," or "resoma
tion." The process is straightfor
ward enough: rather than burning
the body to ash, heated potassium
hydroxide is used to dissolve away
the soft tissues. (The bones are
ground and returned to the family
of the deceased.) While the process
is said to release a fraction of the
greenhouse gases of a regular cre
mation, I can't help but wonder
about the downstream environmen
tal effects of the concentrated base
solution, which is washed into the
sewage system after the body has
been dissolved. The first green cre
matoriums have only come online in
the past few months; I'm sure we'll
hear more about their environmen
tal impacts if and when they catch
on.

All in all, there's a lot to think
about when it comes to the "green
ing" of death.
As an ecologist, I'm trained to
think of humans indeed, all liv
ing things as temporary amalga
mations of raw materials that are
part of global cycles much larger

and longer lasting than our corpo
real forms. I like to imagine that
some of my calcium was once pre
cipitated by a coral, that some of
my oxygen once also nourished a
Tyrannosaurus Rex and that, after
my death, the energy and nutrients
trapped in my chemical bonds will
temporarily boost the growth of a
tiny microbial food web. If to be
"green" in death means to minimize
the barriers between me and this
natural recycling, then I'm all in
favor.
Of course, what happens to our
bodies after death, good or bad for
the environment, represents only a
small fraction of the impact we've
had over the course of our lives. You
can't make up for a lifetime of
Hummer driving (or, in my case, of
cross-country flights) by going
green in the afterlife. But perhaps
thinking about our shared ultimate
fate demise and decomposition
will remind us of our fundamen
tal interconnectedness with the
most basic cycles of life on this
planet and thereby motivate us to
protect and maintain them. Ashes
to ashes, ocean to ocean, dust to
dust.
