According to Cady Heron, Halloween is a time when
you can dress like a total slut and no one can say any
thing. True, Mean Girls, but so are Exotic Erotic,
FMOTQ, Let's Get Physical, and really most weekend parties.
While we all appreciate Spirit Halloween's Officer Bombshell
uniforms and those Smokin' Hot Firefighter getups, here are
a few ideas if you are trying to step up your game this
Halloween season.
The Couple's Costume
It's a well-known fact that the man himself, Jay-Z, is not hav
ing girl problems. While not every man can claim Beyonce,
they can still show off their main squeeze with these cute
football-inspired jerseys. Will also accept innuendo cos
tumes, like a plug and outlet.
Old Spice Guy
A costume guaranteed to reel in the ladies. The Old Spice
man is swoll beyond compare, but his masculinity is height
ened because he's always toting around one of the company's
popular grooming products. Be the fantasy of every girl on
Halloween and dress up as the Old Spice guy. Swing by CVS
and invest in an Old Spice swagger deodorant stick. Wrap a
towel around your waist and add a little towel tuck as the
final touch. Body oil optional. Old Spice bottle doubles as
flask.
Barista, Please-ta-Meetcha
What better way to welcome Starbucks to the Stanford com
munity than dressing up as a barista. Grab a green apron and
a to-go cup with Starbucks' (in)famous logo and you're good
to go. For a more risque look, feel free to hem up the apron
to your desired length. Get creative and come up with your
own customized Frappuccino. One or two shots with that?
So Stanford
Grab your roommate and send homage to one of Stanford's
finest eateries: The Axe and Palm. One of you can represent
the axe, and the other can assume the role of the palm tree.
Actual executions for this costume are open to individual
interpretations and approaches. (Upperclassmen, you might
also get some use out of your Frosh lanyards and go as a
younger you.)
The Last-Minute Costume
It is not uncommon to come across students racing to finish
up that last problem on their pset or squeezing in some sleep
in their jam-packed schedules. Before you get a chance to
devise an original costume idea, Halloween hits and you're
desperate for a grab-and-go costume. Take the burden off
yourself and dress up as "The Dish": simple and to the point.
Step one: grab a plate from your nearest dining hall. Step
two: tape the plate to your shirt (Command strips highly rec
ommended). Step three: return plate to its rightful dining
hall. Remember, Arrillaga keeps tabs.

Wiley Webb has been going to
electronic dance music
(EDM) festivals since he
was 15. He has produced music for
nearly four years and just a few weeks
ago, he played at Ruby Skye with the
likes of 3lau. He has even hung out
with Ferry Corsten backstage. All of
this, mind you, before completing his
first year at Stanford.
In person, Webb seems like a nor
mal freshman, eager to eat off campus
before we begin our interview, asking
for somewhere more exciting than
Chipotle since this is a "rare opportuni
ty for a wee little freshman." While cer
tainly not Stanford's first EDM DJ,
Wiley is one of the few who have made
significant strides in the world of elec
tronic dance music.
INTERMISSION: How did you get
into DJing?
WEBB: DJing really for me was just a
side thing off of producing music,
making music, so that's just the per
formance aspect of producing dance
music. I started off playing parties at
my high school.
INT: What about producing music?
WEBB: Playing around in Logic, which
is the software I've used for a while
now, probably four years or something.
Just fooling around, gradually learning,

but I didn't really pursue music pro
duction intensely whatsoever until
about two years ago.
INT: What changed two years ago?
WEBB: I think I just really began lov
ing music, appreciating it, and I just
reached a point where I felt like I was
doing quality work that was good
sounding and different from what
other people were making. A track I
made that was a hallmark of that era
was my remix of Kaskade's "Dynasty,"
and today, that's still my most popular
track. It kinda went semi-viral on blogs
and stuff, and I made that when I was
sixteen and a half.
INT: What was it like playing at Ruby
Skye?
WEBB: It was really fun. Actually, when
I got into Stanford, one of the first
things I did was do some research on
San Francisco and identify what I
thought was the best club in the city,
and that was Ruby Skye. I set a goal
way back in December that I'd play at
Ruby Skye within two years, so it was
pretty awesome to have that specific
goal realized within two weeks of being
on campus.
INT: How did that happen?
WEBB: I'm friends with Justin 3lau, the
headliner that night, and he his

manager, rather got me the gig
because he knew I was in the area and
they both wanted to help out because
they're great guys.
INT: How did it feel in front of the
crowd?
WEBB: It was great. Sure it makes you a
little nervous being on stage, but I did
have some preparation playing a big gig
in Boulder, Colorado in May. That was
my first real show, as in a venue, and
not a house. And that's where I met
3lau because he was also opening for
another guy we both knew. There, I just
learned a lot how to have a presence in
front of a crowd, how to interact with
them, and just how to de-stress and de
nerve.
INT: How do you balance Stanford life
with producing music?
WEBB: I'm still learning. It's still such a
struggle to get enough time everyday.
Today's Tuesday, right? So that's seven
days straight of getting 4 hours of sleep
average. This weekend was performing
at Ruby Skye, Facebook Hackathon,
and then our scavenger hunt in San
Francisco, so I'm still catching up. I'm
still getting used to that, so I really have
to figure out if there's even time for me
to work on digital music while I'm
here, and maybe DJing is all I can really
do, but we'll see, especially when I stop
