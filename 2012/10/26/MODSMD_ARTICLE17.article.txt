# 'BODYSONGS'
## HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL BEATS

f | a certain loneliness that can only be experi
enced on a crowded dance floor. "Little Sleepwalker,"
.A. Born Gold's sophomore effort, borrows from hip-hop
and club music to create an introspective and personal song
collection. Moving away from the bright hyperpop of
"BODYSONGS," Born Gold created an album that is less
outspoken but equally intricate one best enjoyed in the
dark, in the dead of night.
The first lines of "Pulse Thief," the distorted mutterings
of "Euphoria's asleep/1 took her timid pulse," are a roadmap
for the entire work. This dreamy darkness translates into the
instrumentation of the track, where the synth and the echo
of the drum give the song a sinister, otherworldly feel.
"That Way" continues to toy with the idea of dance
music, even employing a thumping 4-4 beat. Frena deadpans
the overused line," Girl I know what you want" only to pull
the listener's mind out of the gutter by following it with," So
let your eyes roll back/ Sleepwalk through these woods!'
Throughout the record, Born Gold uses the tropes of differ
ent styles of music and transforms them in unexpected ways.
"Lethe" uses a synth reminiscent of Justin Timberlake's
celebratory "My Love" to create a world that is menacing
and eerie. The track draws its haunting strength from the
juxtaposition of complex instrumentation with half-sec
ond silences, where the beat drops out and the last uttered

lyrics linger.
"I: Ferocious Body" is a delightful treat for click, bell and
whistle enthusiasts. In a recent interview, Frena said he chal
lenged himself on "Little Sleepwalker" to start the songwrit
ing process with beats, and his attentiveness to percussion is
one of the strongest parts of the album. This carries through
to the accompanying track, "Against Silence," which expands
upon the ideas in "I: Ferocious Body" using bits and pieces of
his stylized vocals to form the only lyrics of the song, the
simple statement, "7 am not afraid'
The one fleeting sight of pop on the album is the cheerful
"Skybicycle," but even this track manages to break out of a
conventional structure, surprising the listener with a
chopped up and rhythmically interesting bridge. "Little
Sleepwalker" doesn't linger in a major key, instead taking a
turn for the cosmic on "Black Sonar." I could almost hear
Death Grips' MC Ride rapping over the track, yet another
sign of the new interconnectedness between hip-hop and
electronica. The album concludes with "Gauze Pillars," an
elaborate track that seems to occupy the space between wak
ing and dreaming.
What ultimately makes "Little Sleepwalker" a successful
experiment is that, despite its sleepy and ephemeral theme, it
successfully creates a haunting sound that carries the listener
through a unique world.
