# IN GOOD TASTE: Grace Klaris | FELLOW Late Night Bites
## 
### 
-w- A -r-hether you're up at the wee
% /\ / hours of the night cram
â–¼ V ming for a chemistry
midterm or stumbling back to your
dorm on a Friday night, few words
sound more glorious than, "Let's go to
late night." It's practically a scientific
fact: food just tastes better after 11 p.m.
This week, I decided to eat at all three
of Stanford's late night dining establish
ments in an attempt to declare one an
official winner.
Lakeside at Lag
Without a doubt, Lakeside's
biggest draw is its selection. I opted to
try some of the more obscure items to
truly test the kitchen's level of expertise.
Unfortunately, this is not where
Lakeside thrives. The Thai BBQ chick
en was a major disappointment, and
the bland veggie noodle pho left me
scouring the table for salt. Like many a
food excursion, however, the key to
success is proper ordering. I was pleas
andy surprised by a near-perfect
"brain-boosting" berry smoothie and
satisfying turkey and avocado wrap.
These are fantastic healthy alternatives
when you're feeling slighdy less indul
gent. Nevertheless, we all know that late
night snacking doesn't always follow
ordinary rules of healthfulness. To
many college students, there is nothing
better at 2 a.m. than a tri-combo plate
of hot wings, garlic fries and tater tots.
Bottom line is: stick to the basics, and I
promise you won't be disappointed.
Pros: Hands down best selection
Cons: Not open Friday or
Saturday
Must-haves: any of the "Late Night
favorites," milkshakes, berry smoothie
The Axe and Palm:
Here, steer clear of the pre-made
dishes and specialty beverages. Unless
you are dying for some painfully
mediocre sushi or a McDonald's-style
smoothie, you're better off with the hot
food. If you're a "meaty" kind of per-

son, get the Pac-12 with BBQ bacon
and Angus beef. If you're looking for
something a bit leaner, you won't be
disappointed by the Billy Erb turkey
burger. It did, however, lack any real
"kick," so I would highly recommend
hitting up th-e condiments bar to add
some famaican relish, salsa and
jalapenos for a makeshift sauce. But as
good as the burgers are, the real gems
are the sides. I had some of the best
onion rings and sweet potato fries on
campus. And trust me: you have not
lived until you've tried their brownie k
la mode. This decadent treat comes
piping hot with a scoop of ice cream,
whipped cream and hot fudge, and
puts all other late night dishes to
shame.
Pros: Best individual dishes
Cons: Slow service, minimal selec
tion
Must-haves: Pac-12, onion rings,
sweet potato fries, brownie a la mode
The Dish at Arrillaga
As a Stern resident, I am slightly
biased to this neighborhood hangout.
But aside from convenience, there is a
reason why I continue to find myself
walking up those familiar steps. At
Arrillaga, especially for residents living

in nearby dorms, it's all about the expe
rience. Head over late one Friday or
Saturday night and you'll find yourself
laughing among friends as the evening
begins to wind down. The selection
doesn't come close to Lakeside, and the
quality pales in comparison to Axe and
Palm, but if you're looking for a place
to end your night, my vote is still The
Dish. You barely need to step fully into
the dining hall to feel the welcoming
energy of intoxicated college students
wolfing down greasy chicken tenders
and waffle fries both highly recom
mended. You'll see old friends, hopeful
ly make some new ones and leave with
memories that'll last much longer than
that plate of pizza. In the end, it's all
about the people watching ... and the
warm chocolate chip cookie.
Pros: Open every night, fast serv
ice, great atmosphere
Cons: Limited selection, no real
"standout" dishes
Must-haves: chicken tenders, waf
fle fries, chocolate chip cookie
The bottom line: stick to Lakeside
and Axe and Palm during the week for
solid food, but hit up Arrillaga on the
weekends for some unbeatable people
watching and long-lasting memories.
