# LESSONS FROM LITERATURE WITH
## J.M. COETZEE 
### Emma Townley-Smith | FELLOW 
J. M. Coetzee knows how to work with silence. From the
quiet tones of his characters waiting out the night to his
short and stoic responses to interview questions, the win
ner of the Nobel Prize in Literature carefully weighs every
statement he makes.
Coetzee's Monday evening lan Watt lecture was intro
duced by Stanford comparative literature doctoral candi
date Lucy Alford, who described the award-winning
author's work as being full of "ethical quandaries," issues
that had impacted her deeply as she made her way
through his collections of work. She described his style as
a pair of invisible hands, guiding the reader carefully down
a path of social and political questioning, an omnipresent
force to remind his audience of what is truly important.
Coetzee lent himself a gentle and serious tenor by keeping
his own introduction short, humorously presenting him
self as "at most, an amateur," even "a muddlehead" when it
came to novels. He is widely known for his absence from
the public eye, most notably, for his refusal to show up at
ceremonies to accept some of his prestigious awards.
A reading like the one given at the Center for the Study of
the Novel is rare, and Coetzee indicated that he was hon
ored to receive the lan Watt lecture for the year.
He presented an hour-long excerpt from his forthcoming
novel, "The Childhood of Jesus," due to be released in
March, inducting the audience into the moving tale of a
man who wanted to help a small child find his mother, but
for whom every door was closed, literally and metaphori
cally. Perseverance in the face of hardship and aggravation
in the face of injustice were evident throughout his tale,
connecting not only with the themes of his other works,
but also with themes that are explored in his own political
engagements in human rights, animal rights and law.
Alford told the audience that Coetzee would teach them
"how to engage politically in a human language," whether
that human language is the sigh of an old man's back as he
carries heavy sacks on and off a swaying boat or the gentle
way that Coetzee read as he narrated this tale of a man
who had so much to give.
In the conversation following the reading, Nancy
Ruttenburg, the William Robertson Coe Professor of
American Literature in the English Department, reflected
on the themes and constructions of Coetzee's novels. She
compared his style to that of J.D. Salinger, Philip Roth and
James Baldwin, among others that she characterized as
having a close, almost disorientating author-protagonist
relationship.
Though his works are somewhat biographical, Coetzee
insisted on a measure of space between author and protag
onist, declaring in some cases that he was "not the right
person to ask" about what his writing meant because the
fiction took on its own life out of his hands.
Whether audience members came to hear the excerpt or
to marvel at a discussion of whether Coetzee belonged to
the Dostoevsky or Tolstoy camp of thought, each left with
the sense that something significant had passed.
In parting, Alford said that "writers teach us more than
they are aware of," a note on which Coetzee, with his sub
tle dichotomy of narrative and biography, declined to
comment.
