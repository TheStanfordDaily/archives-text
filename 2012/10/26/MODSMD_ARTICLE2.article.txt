MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 34, WAZZU 7: Mike
Leach won't be caught dead trying to run the
ball against Stanford's front seven. That's not
saying much since signature offense has
rarely been one to ground and pound. The
stats don't lie the Cougars are next to last
in the nation in rushing yards and yards per
carry and they don't stop the run much
better. Even on the off chance Jeff Tuel can
pull off a miracle and somehow escape
Stanford's relentless pass rush long enough
to find receivers downfield, the Cardinal
won't have many problems putting up points
at home when quarterback Josh Nunes'
play-action fake will actually need to be
respected.

STANFORD 31, WAZZU 1 7: Mike
Leach's "air raid" might have worked at
Texas Tech, but it certainly hasn't worked for
Washington State this season. Sure, the
Cougars have a pass-oriented spread
offense much like Arizona does. And sure,
Arizona blasted the Cardinal defense
through the air. But that similarity hardly mat
ters when Leach can barely decide who the
quarterback of his team is. The Cougars
have the second worst run defense in the
Pac-12, so look for Stepfan Taylor to have
over 150 rushing yards and two touchdowns.
I also think that Josh Nunes is due for a 60-
percent completion game. The Cardinal
shouldn't underestimate the Cougars, but
let's be honest: it won't get another tough
test until it faces juggernaut Oregon in two
weeks.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 41, WAZZU 17: This is
a perfect matchup for Stanford. The Card
finally found its running game in the team's
first road win at Cal last weekend. A week
earlier, Washington State allowed over 300
yards on the ground to the same Cal team
that Stanford held to three rushing yards on
Saturday. This one could get ugly quick,
especially when Stanford moves to the play
action. Cardinal will take this one easily, with
the score not indicating the beating that The
Cougars will endure all afternoon long
thanks to a late Marquess Wilson touchdown
against Stanford's backups.
