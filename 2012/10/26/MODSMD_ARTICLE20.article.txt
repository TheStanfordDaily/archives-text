# Set Talk. with the Tree: THE EX SEX
## 
### 
I had just finished an episode of that show we used to watch
together as we cuddled to go to sleep. I remembered the
warmth of his body against mine, the laughs that we shared. I
found myself automatically picking up my phone and begin a text
to him. My ex.
The rest was like a fast-forwarded scene from a movie where
some cheesy Smiths song narrates in the background. On the way
to his house, I knew I was taking a step backwards. I could feel my
conscience rolling her eyes at me. My mind told me I shouldn't
see him, but before I knew it I was laying in bed with him.
Why do we torture ourselves post breakup?
Dialogue often focuses on physical sex and sexual health, but
how do emotions play into the health of our relationships or sex
ual encounters?
It always seems to go the same way. Break up, fight, attack
each other with some hurtful, personal remarks, maybe hook up
with someone else. And then, perhaps you have a little too much
wine, or you sit in your room a little too long alone and make the
text. The text to your ex ... for sex.
When you broke up with your partner the first time, it
seemed like a great idea. You knew all the things you didn't like
about him or her ... shoot, you may have even made a list to
remind yourself why you ended the relationship.
You know that your relationship issues won't work them
selves out overnight, yet the moment you see them again on this
surprisingly small campus, with that familiar smile, your stomach
sinks. How do all those feelings that seemed to disappear come
back in an instant?
So why do we do it? Why do we let ourselves go back for
more? Sex is often about fantasy. The fantasy in ex-sex can be
realized because in that moment it is as if time stands still and
there are no problems in the relationship. It is just about you
and your partner. It reminds you of a better time when things
were ok and working out. Maybe it takes away feelings of loneli
ness, maybe it gives you hope that the relationship might work
out or maybe it's just mind-blowing. And the sex
... well let's be real, they know your body. And thev
are probably trying to win you back by giving you
the best they have.
It is difficult enough to remain friends after a
breakup; adding sex into the mix just complicates
things even more. Whether we want to admit it

or not, sex with an ex brings back feelings,
emobons and a sense of intimacy that can
truly cause mixed emotions towards your ex.

Sex can be an act that solidifies a sense of
attachment; having sex with an ex can hin
der your healing process at a crucial post-

breakup time.
One part of you feels like this reconnec
tion might make you two fall back into love,

and the other part of you knows that you
broke up for a reason. Most likely, this reasor
cannot be fixed with great sex.
Unfortunately.
This is not to say that sex with
an ex can't work. Perhaps you're
lucky and the break was
mutual, and now you're just
looking for something casual.
Sex with an ex can work if
enough time has passed, i
both people are clearly
over each other emotion
ally and there are clear
expectations that it is purely
physical. It sounds ideal (if
they were good in bed); they know what turns you on and how to
please you. Unlike that 3 a.m. tearful drunken text fueled by emo
tions, a conscious determination to have casual sex can be fun and
healthy.
Aside from the emotional tug of war that sex with an ex
causes, though, it can also be physically risky. While you were
dating, perhaps you were on birth control and didn't always use
a condom, but you knew your partner was clean and trusted
that he or she wasn't sneaking around with other people

behind your back.
After a breakup, however, as much as it turns our stomachs
to imagine our former lover with another person, it is possible
that they have been intimate with other people. As my eccentric
aunt used to say, the best way to get over someone is to get under
someone else (maybe not the best advice). If you are going to get
freaky with your ex again, be sure to protect yourself physically as
well. Use a barrier method like a condom.
Just remember, if you wanted to move on and find some
body new, make sure that you are making time to do just that. If
you have no intention of getting back with your ex, but you spend
a lot of time between the sheets (or outside, or in a shower, wher
ever you like to do it), just remember that this is time taken away
from meeting new people.
