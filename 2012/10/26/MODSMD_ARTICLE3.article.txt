## WAZZU PAYS NO. 17 CARD A VISIT 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
With five games left in the
regular season, Stanford's
postseason picture
remains as unclear as it
was a few weeks ago. The
Cardinal is currently sitting in third place in
the Pac-12 North race, but its dreams of a
conference championship and a Rose Bowl
berth are still reachable.
Tomorrow, the team can take a tangible
step toward those goals: win and become
bowl-eligible for the fourth season in a row.
Rejuvenated by a 21-3 defensive domina
tion of Cal last weekend, No. 17 Stanford (5-
2, 3-1 Pac-12) will play host to Washington
State (2-5, 0-4) in its second straight Pac-12
North matchup tomorrow afternoon.
After giving up only three total rushing
yards and racking up 475 yards of offense in

last Saturday's Big Game, the players have
put their earlier losses on the road against
Washington and Notre Dame behind for
good.
Don't expect the Cardinal to take its foot
off the gas pedal.
"We aren't nearly as good as we can be,"
senior fullback Ryan Hewitt said. "That
alone should drive us. We haven't come close
to putting together four quarters of good
football. I don't think we can become compla
cent, but I don't think we need to worry
about that. We're still striving to be as good
as we can be."
The Cardinal has simply manhandled the
Cougars the past four years, winning by an
average margin of 31 points. There was no
shortage of preseason hype surrounding
first-year head coach Mike Leach and his
knowledge of the pass-oriented spread
offense, but the "air raid" that proved to be a
high-flying scoring machine at Texas Tech
has yet to materialize into a consistent,
potent offense at Washington State.
Given that the Leach dials up passing
plays 70 percent of the time, it's no surprise
that the Cougars' running game, which aver
ages just 40 yards per game, is dead last in

the Pac-12.
But Washington State's passing game
hasn't exactly offset its nonexistent rushing
attack. Quarterback Jeff Tuel, making his
first start since Sept. 8, regains the starting
role under center after being replaced by
Connor Halliday in the last few weeks.
Struggling to find a steady rhythm all sea
son, Tuel is 94-of-145 passing for 908 yards
and five touchdowns, but has been sacked 12
times and picked off on three occasions. The
senior had a respectable 320-yard passing
performance against Cal two weeks ago, but
was unable to find the end zone consistently
as the Cougars fell to the Bears 31-17.
Halliday hasn't fared much better either,
having thrown more interceptions than
touchdowns this year.
Still, Washington State is not without an
arsenal of weapons on offense. The Cardinal
secondary has already faced some of the best
wide receivers in the nation, including
Marqise Lee, Robert Woods, Keenan Allen
and Conner Vernon. Tomorrow afternoon, it
will have to contain yet another dangerous
wideout in junior Marquess Wilson, who has

Saturday will be a big day for Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) and the Stanford running game, which will face off against a beleaguered
Washington State run defense. Taylor ran for a career-high 189 yards with a touchdown in the Cardinal's 21-3 win over Cal in the Big
Game.
been averaging over 16 yards per
catch.
"Wilson is up there with all the
wide receivers [we've faced]," head
coach David Shaw said. "Every
time you seen Wilson, he beats
guys. He beats them at the line, he
beats them down the field. When
he's double covered, he goes up,
makes plays and runs after the
catch ... That's a challenge for us.
The last big-time passing offense
that we saw, we gave up a whole
bunch of yards to. We have a guy
coming in who's pretty special, so
we have to make sure that we min
imize the damage that he's going to
cause."
Following its lights-out per
formance against Cal, the Stanford
defense comes into the game
ranked third in the nation in tack
les for loss, fourth in rushing
defense and eighth in sacks. The
Cardinal pass defense may be giv
ing up 270 yards through the air
per game, but through seven con
tests, it has held opponents to
seven passing touchdowns and
come up with nine interceptions.
One of the emerging stars in the
Stanford secondary is freshman
cornerback Alex Carter, who made
his first career start last weekend

against Cal. The true freshman
caught the eyes of the coaching
staff with his physical talents long
ago, but is now quickly translating
those skills to big-time plays on the
field.
"[Carter is] under 10 percent
body fat," said Shaw. "His vertical
jump is 40 [inches], he broad jumps
10 feet and he runs in the 4.4 range.
Those are NFL combine numbers.
And then you say, 'Wow, he's 17.'"
Stanford's offense finally scored
a touchdown on the road and won
the time of possession battle by
almost 14 minutes last Saturday,
but neither Shaw nor the offensive
players were content about being
held scoreless for the second half.
Quarterback Josh Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz early and often
in the first half against Cal, but he
is still completing only 53 percent
of his passes and currently ranked
seventh in the conference in terms
of passing efficiency.
"Josh played good [against Cal],
but he can play better," Shaw said.
"We're making too many mistakes
on the road that may look like the
quarterback's fault. But dropping
passes is inexcusable and we've got
to run routes at the proper depth.
Even so, Josh has got to be ready
for it. If a guy's not where he's sup
posed to be, Josh has got to be
ready and take off."
After throwing his first career
touchdown last Saturday, redshirt
freshman quarterback Kevin

Hogan will likely be seeing even
more action out of the unique
"Hogan packages." As Shaw
emphasized, Hogan's arm strength
and passing-first mentality force
the defense to be honest when he's
in for an offensive play.
"It's kind of like having, excuse
me for saying it, but like a Tim
Tebow on our team," Hewitt said.
"He relishes the role. He likes it."
Coming off a career-high 189-
yard game against the Golden
Bears, running back Stepfan
Taylor looks to wear down a sus
ceptible Cougars defense that has
given up over 175 yards per game
on the ground. The senior tailback
needs 417 more yards and seven

more carries to surpass Darrin
Nelson as the all-time Stanford
leader in those respective cate
gories.

"[Taylor] is a workhorse,"
Nunes said. "We know we can rely
on him any point in the game. He
always gives everything he's got.
It's a testament to the work he does
in camp and summer workouts.
He's a guy who always spends
extra time in the weight room."

The Cardinal offensive line will
especially need to be wary of
Washington's star linebacker,
Travis Long. The 245-pound senior
has 27 solo tackles on the season
along with 7.5 sacks, and his versa
tility at various places on the field
has given offensive linemen night
mares when it comes to blocking
him.

"I'm impressed by Long's ver
satility," said Shaw. "He can line up
as weak side linebacker or a strong
side linebacker. He'll line up off the
ball as the defensive end and the
next thing you know, he's standing
in the A-gap, a yard and a half from
your quarterback. He's good wher

RYAN HEWITT,
senior fullback
With five games left in the
regular season, Stanford's
postseason picture
remains as unclear as it
was a few weeks ago. The
Cardinal is currently sitting in third place in
the Pac-12 North race, but its dreams of a
conference championship and a Rose Bowl
berth are still reachable.
Tomorrow, the team can take a tangible
step toward those goals: win and become
bowl-eligible for the fourth season in a row.
Rejuvenated by a 21-3 defensive domina
tion of Cal last weekend, No. 17 Stanford (5-
2, 3-1 Pac-12) will play host to Washington
State (2-5, 0-4) in its second straight Pac-12
North matchup tomorrow afternoon.
After giving up only three total rushing
yards and racking up 475 yards of offense in

last Saturday's Big Game, the players have
put their earlier losses on the road against
Washington and Notre Dame behind for
good.
Don't expect the Cardinal to take its foot
off the gas pedal.
"We aren't nearly as good as we can be,"
senior fullback Ryan Hewitt said. "That
alone should drive us. We haven't come close
to putting together four quarters of good
football. I don't think we can become compla
cent, but I don't think we need to worry
about that. We're still striving to be as good
as we can be."
The Cardinal has simply manhandled the
Cougars the past four years, winning by an
average margin of 31 points. There was no
shortage of preseason hype surrounding
first-year head coach Mike Leach and his
knowledge of the pass-oriented spread
offense, but the "air raid" that proved to be a
high-flying scoring machine at Texas Tech
has yet to materialize into a consistent,
potent offense at Washington State.
Given that the Leach dials up passing
plays 70 percent of the time, it's no surprise
that the Cougars' running game, which aver
ages just 40 yards per game, is dead last in

the Pac-12.
But Washington State's passing game
hasn't exactly offset its nonexistent rushing
attack. Quarterback Jeff Tuel, making his
first start since Sept. 8, regains the starting
role under center after being replaced by
Connor Halliday in the last few weeks.
Struggling to find a steady rhythm all sea
son, Tuel is 94-of-145 passing for 908 yards
and five touchdowns, but has been sacked 12
times and picked off on three occasions. The
senior had a respectable 320-yard passing
performance against Cal two weeks ago, but
was unable to find the end zone consistently
as the Cougars fell to the Bears 31-17.
Halliday hasn't fared much better either,
having thrown more interceptions than
touchdowns this year.
Still, Washington State is not without an
arsenal of weapons on offense. The Cardinal
secondary has already faced some of the best
wide receivers in the nation, including
Marqise Lee, Robert Woods, Keenan Allen
and Conner Vernon. Tomorrow afternoon, it
will have to contain yet another dangerous
wideout in junior Marquess Wilson, who has

"Wilson is up there with all the

coach David Shaw said. "Every

that we saw, we gave up a whole

coming in who's pretty special, so
we have to make sure that we min

cause."
Following its lights-out per
formance against Cal, the Stanford
defense comes into the game
ranked third in the nation in tack
les for loss, fourth in rushing
defense and eighth in sacks. The
Cardinal pass defense may be giv
ing up 270 yards through the air
per game, but through seven con
tests, it has held opponents to
seven passing touchdowns and
come up with nine interceptions.
One of the emerging stars in the
Stanford secondary is freshman
cornerback Alex Carter, who made
his first career start last weekend

against Cal. The true freshman
caught the eyes of the coaching
staff with his physical talents long
ago, but is now quickly translating
those skills to big-time plays on the
field.
"[Carter is] under 10 percent
body fat," said Shaw. "His vertical
jump is 40 [inches], he broad jumps
10 feet and he runs in the 4.4 range.
Those are NFL combine numbers.
And then you say, 'Wow, he's 17.'"
Stanford's offense finally scored
a touchdown on the road and won
the time of possession battle by
almost 14 minutes last Saturday,
but neither Shaw nor the offensive
players were content about being
held scoreless for the second half.
Quarterback Josh Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz early and often
in the first half against Cal, but he
is still completing only 53 percent
of his passes and currently ranked
seventh in the conference in terms
of passing efficiency.
"Josh played good [against Cal],
but he can play better," Shaw said.
"We're making too many mistakes
on the road that may look like the
quarterback's fault. But dropping
passes is inexcusable and we've got
to run routes at the proper depth.
Even so, Josh has got to be ready
for it. If a guy's not where he's sup
posed to be, Josh has got to be
ready and take off."
After throwing his first career
touchdown last Saturday, redshirt
freshman quarterback Kevin

Hogan will likely be seeing even
more action out of the unique
"Hogan packages." As Shaw
emphasized, Hogan's arm strength
and passing-first mentality force
the defense to be honest when he's
in for an offensive play.
"It's kind of like having, excuse
me for saying it, but like a Tim

ago, but is now quickly translating
those skills to big-time plays on the
field.
"[Carter is] under 10 percent
body fat," said Shaw. "His vertical
jump is 40 [inches], he broad jumps
10 feet and he runs in the 4.4 range.
Those are NFL combine numbers.
And then you say, 'Wow, he's 17.'"
Stanford's offense finally scored
a touchdown on the road and won
the time of possession battle by
almost 14 minutes last Saturday,
but neither Shaw nor the offensive
players were content about being
held scoreless for the second half.
Quarterback Josh Nunes found
tight end Zach Ertz early and often
in the first half against Cal, but he
is still completing only 53 percent
of his passes and currently ranked
seventh in the conference in terms
of passing efficiency.
"Josh played good [against Cal],
but he can play better," Shaw said.
"We're making too many mistakes
on the road that may look like the
quarterback's fault. But dropping
passes is inexcusable and we've got
to run routes at the proper depth.
Even so, Josh has got to be ready
for it. If a guy's not where he's sup
posed to be, Josh has got to be
ready and take off."
After throwing his first career
touchdown last Saturday, redshirt
freshman quarterback Kevin

Hogan will likely be seeing even
more action out of the unique
"Hogan packages." As Shaw
emphasized, Hogan's arm strength
and passing-first mentality force
the defense to be honest when he's
in for an offensive play.
"It's kind of like having, excuse
me for saying it, but like a Tim
Tebow on our team," Hewitt said.
"He relishes the role. He likes it."
Coming off a career-high 189-
yard game against the Golden
Bears, running back Stepfan
Taylor looks to wear down a sus
ceptible Cougars defense that has
given up over 175 yards per game
on the ground. The senior tailback
needs 417 more yards and seven

more carries to surpass Darrin
Nelson as the all-time Stanford
leader in those respective cate
gories.

"[Taylor] is a workhorse,"
Nunes said. "We know we can rely
on him any point in the game. He
always gives everything he's got.
It's a testament to the work he does
in camp and summer workouts.
He's a guy who always spends
extra time in the weight room."

The Cardinal offensive line will
especially need to be wary of
Washington's star linebacker,
Travis Long. The 245-pound senior
has 27 solo tackles on the season
along with 7.5 sacks, and his versa
tility at various places on the field
has given offensive linemen night
mares when it comes to blocking
him.

"I'm impressed by Long's ver
satility," said Shaw. "He can line up
as weak side linebacker or a strong
side linebacker. He'll line up off the
ball as the defensive end and the
next thing you know, he's standing
in the A-gap, a yard and a half from
your quarterback. He's good wher
ever they put him; he outworks

Saturday's contest between the
Cardinal and the Cougars at
Stanford Stadium is scheduled for
a 3:15 p.m. kickoff, with television
coverage on the Pac-12 Networks.

It's kind of
like having a
Tim Tebow
on our team.
