## WAZZU PAYS NO. 17 CARD A VISIT 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
With five games left in the
regular season, Stanford's
postseason picture
remains as unclear as it
was a few weeks ago. The
Cardinal is currently sitting in third place in
the Pac-12 North race, but its dreams of a
conference championship and a Rose Bowl
berth are still reachable.
Tomorrow, the team can take a tangible
step toward those goals: win and become
bowl-eligible for the fourth season in a row.
Rejuvenated by a 21-3 defensive domina
tion of Cal last weekend, No. 17 Stanford (5-
2, 3-1 Pac-12) will play host to Washington
State (2-5, 0-4) in its second straight Pac-12
North matchup tomorrow afternoon.
After giving up only three total rushing
yards and racking up 475 yards of offense in

last Saturday's Big Game, the players have
put their earlier losses on the road against
Washington and Notre Dame behind for
good.
Don't expect the Cardinal to take its foot
off the gas pedal.
"We aren't nearly as good as we can be,"
senior fullback Ryan Hewitt said. "That
alone should drive us. We haven't come close
to putting together four quarters of good
football. I don't think we can become compla
cent, but I don't think we need to worry
about that. We're still striving to be as good
as we can be."
The Cardinal has simply manhandled the
Cougars the past four years, winning by an
average margin of 31 points. There was no
shortage of preseason hype surrounding
first-year head coach Mike Leach and his
knowledge of the pass-oriented spread
offense, but the "air raid" that proved to be a
high-flying scoring machine at Texas Tech
has yet to materialize into a consistent,
potent offense at Washington State.
Given that the Leach dials up passing
plays 70 percent of the time, it's no surprise
that the Cougars' running game, which aver
ages just 40 yards per game, is dead last in

the Pac-12.
But Washington State's passing game
hasn't exactly offset its nonexistent rushing
attack. Quarterback Jeff Tuel, making his
first start since Sept. 8, regains the starting
role under center after being replaced by
Connor Halliday in the last few weeks.
Struggling to find a steady rhythm all sea
son, Tuel is 94-of-145 passing for 908 yards
and five touchdowns, but has been sacked 12
times and picked off on three occasions. The
senior had a respectable 320-yard passing
performance against Cal two weeks ago, but
was unable to find the end zone consistently
as the Cougars fell to the Bears 31-17.
Halliday hasn't fared much better either,
having thrown more interceptions than
touchdowns this year.
Still, Washington State is not without an
arsenal of weapons on offense. The Cardinal
secondary has already faced some of the best
wide receivers in the nation, including
Marqise Lee, Robert Woods, Keenan Allen
and Conner Vernon. Tomorrow afternoon, it
will have to contain yet another dangerous
wideout in junior Marquess Wilson, who has

Saturday will be a big day for Stepfan Taylor (above with ball) and the Stanford running game, which will face off against a beleaguered
Washington State run defense. Taylor ran for a career-high 189 yards with a touchdown in the Cardinal's 21-3 win over Cal in the Big
Game.
