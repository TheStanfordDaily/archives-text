## Faculty Senate debates online education 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a report
on online education for the second time
in the past six months at its Thursday
afternoon meeting in an effort to fur
ther explore faculty concerns with and
goals for the rapidly developing field.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, pro
fessor of civil and environmental engi
neering, opened the meeting by
applauding the recent election of four
School of Medicine faculty to the
Institute of Medicine, as well as the
selection of Alvin Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D.
'74 as the 2012 winner of the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
echoed Levitt's congratulatory tone in
announcing the selection of Chi-Chang
Kao as the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory's fifth director. Kao, who is
currently an associate laboratory direc
tor at SLAC, will assume his new posi
tion on Nov. 1.
"He's a spectacular scientist and an
extremely talented administrator,"
Etchemendy said. "We did an absolute
ly thorough international search, and
we found the right person right here in
our backyard."
Newly appointed Vice Provost for
Online Learning (VPOL) John Mitchell
framed his report on the state of online
education at Stanford as a natural fol
low-up to the Senate's discussion in

April on the same subject. He insisted
that the University should continue to
prioritize on-campus students even as
online education grows in popularity.
"Our primary educational mission is
to teach students admitted to our pro
grams," Mitchell said.
He added, though, that technology
used in online education could compli
ment offerings for on-campus students,
potentially creating an overlap between
the two options.
"We can develop material that is
multi-purpose and use it [in] various
ways," Mitchell said. "We should take
this as an opportunity to invest... and
take advantage of opportunities."
While Mitchell said existing
University regulations should generally
suffice in guiding course ownership and
faculty regulations, he drew attention to
concerns about faculty conflicts of inter
est which he equated to working at
another physical university and
online sites that aggregate Stanford
content without giving due credit to the
University.
"[Stanford] should get some recogni
tion," Mitchell said. "It would be better
to have things packaged in away that
gives our University some acknowl
edgement."

Reviewing VPOLs work since the
end of the last academic year, Mitchell
noted the availability of seed grants for
