## Faculty Senate debates online education 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a report
on online education for the second time
in the past six months at its Thursday
afternoon meeting in an effort to fur
ther explore faculty concerns with and
goals for the rapidly developing field.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, pro
fessor of civil and environmental engi
neering, opened the meeting by
applauding the recent election of four
School of Medicine faculty to the
Institute of Medicine, as well as the
selection of Alvin Roth M.A. '73 Ph.D.
'74 as the 2012 winner of the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
echoed Levitt's congratulatory tone in
announcing the selection of Chi-Chang
Kao as the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory's fifth director. Kao, who is
currently an associate laboratory direc
tor at SLAC, will assume his new posi
tion on Nov. 1.
"He's a spectacular scientist and an
extremely talented administrator,"
Etchemendy said. "We did an absolute
ly thorough international search, and
we found the right person right here in
our backyard."
Newly appointed Vice Provost for
Online Learning (VPOL) John Mitchell
framed his report on the state of online
education at Stanford as a natural fol
low-up to the Senate's discussion in

April on the same subject. He insisted
that the University should continue to
prioritize on-campus students even as
online education grows in popularity.
"Our primary educational mission is
to teach students admitted to our pro
grams," Mitchell said.
He added, though, that technology
used in online education could compli
ment offerings for on-campus students,
potentially creating an overlap between
the two options.
"We can develop material that is
multi-purpose and use it [in] various
ways," Mitchell said. "We should take
this as an opportunity to invest... and
take advantage of opportunities."
While Mitchell said existing
University regulations should generally
suffice in guiding course ownership and
faculty regulations, he drew attention to
concerns about faculty conflicts of inter
est which he equated to working at
another physical university and
online sites that aggregate Stanford
content without giving due credit to the
University.
"[Stanford] should get some recogni
tion," Mitchell said. "It would be better
to have things packaged in away that
gives our University some acknowl
edgement."

Reviewing VPOLs work since the
end of the last academic year, Mitchell
noted the availability of seed grants for
faculty innovation in online
and blended courses. He also
said efforts to reach out to
departments have been high
ly fruitful, citing as an exam
ple the School of Medicine's
exploration of the "flipped
classroom" concept.
"We'd like to leverage fac
ulty creativity and initiative,
and help [them] do some
thing exciting in their teach
ing activities," Mitchell said.
Bernd Girod, senior asso
ciate dean for online learning
at the School of Engineering,
was quick to discern between
Stanford courses with an
online component and online
courses offered without
Stanford credentials, such as
massive open online courses
(MOOCs). He said that while
MOOCs should have the low
est priority, these courses do
have significant value.
"These MOOCs can be a
wonderful showcase for us,
for Stanford engineering and
Stanford education," Girod
said.
Charles Prober, senior
associate dean for medical
education at the School of
Medicine, agreed that effec
tively combining online and
physical resources, citing the
"flipped classroom" model as
a tried method of creating
more interactive and effec
tive learning sessions
between students and facul
ty-
Discussion of the report
focused largely on the impact
of online education options
on higher education, along
with the risk that the inex
pensive nature of online
offerings could outcompete
lower-profile physical coun
terparts, if not Stanford
itself.
"It could well be that an
online degree could be as
valuable or even more valu
able than the education you
would receive in a struggling
regional university," Girod
said.
Prober offered a more
restrained outlook on the
potential for significant dis
ruption, arguing that an
equilibrium point in the mid
dle, where online and in-per
son education are effectively

combined, is ultimately more
likely.
"For many students, they
may get the content [online],"
Prober said. "When they see
you, they have the opportunity
to interact with you in a small
er ratio."
Eric Roberts, professor
of computer science, probed
Mitchell's claim that there is
University-wide enthusiasm
for online education.
"There's excitement all
over the University [but] it
would be fair to say there's
also concern all over the
University," Roberts said,
drawing attention to what he
described as the "missionary
zeal" of online education
advocates.
"I worry about that in
this rush to embrace this
technology there has been
some fudging of the data or
selective reporting," Roberts
said.
Roberts subsequently
called for a more vocal advo
cacy of University adminis
trators of the significance of
residential education, argu
ing that personal contact
between students and faculty
offers more effective devel
opment of critical thinking.
"Those are things you

can't assess in that way,"
Roberts said. "We need to
stand firm for what has made
the Stanford educational
experiment so important for
so long."
Richard Sailer, dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, noted that his
school's varied composition
meant that promoting a gen
eral approach to online edu
cation would be complex, but
expressed caution about
being excessively adventur
ous.

"At this point, we're tak
ing a segmented approach,"
Sailer said. "The attitude of
the faculty are varying quite
significantly from one place
to the next... I'm not at this
point prepared to push facul
ty who don't see the value
themselves."

Michael Shaw, a graduate
student in physics and repre
sentative on the ASSU
Graduate Student Council,
expressed concern that the
shift towards online educa
tion could potentially dis
tance students from faculty
and lead to an accentuated
and highly varied workload
being placed on graduate and
postgraduate teaching assis
tants.

"There are wonderful
opportunities here, but
there's also a significant
downside," Shaw said.
Prober countered that, by
using online tools to allow
students to access materials
comprehensively before
class, TAs could be more
effective in their interaction
with students by having a
greater ability to engage in
discussion.

"Our goal is to be time
neutral," Prober said.
"That's absolutely feasible."

Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) Harry Elam framed
the use of online tools as
potentially making faculty
interaction with students
more efficient while resolv
ing time constraints and con
flicts for athletes and stu
dents planning to study
abroad.

"There are untold possi
bilities as to how it might
enrich the undergraduate
experience rather than
degrade it," Elam said.

The Senate will hear a
report on VPUE from Elam
at its next meeting on Nov. 8.
