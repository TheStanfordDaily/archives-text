## VANDERVEER RELOADS

The Stanford women's basket
ball team has a hard act to Mow
this year. On the heels of a 35-2 sea
son and perfect 18-0 Pac-12 slate,
the Card heads into this season
without Nnemka Ogwumike, an All-
American last season and the
WNBA rookie of the year this year
after being selected in the WNBA
Draft. The level of competition that
coach Tara VanDerveer's team
encounters this season will not pro
vide the Card with any time to
breathe, either. They will face both
Baylor and Tennessee on the road,
and take on the University of
Connecticut at home, games that
are always accompanied by plenty
of hype.
As VanDerveer said, a tough
schedule is just part of Stanford's
identity as a top program. "When
you play a great schedule like we do,
it gives you a sense of urgency
eveiy day in practice," she said.
"Baylor is undefeated and won the
national championship, we lost to
them last year. Connecticut we lost
to last year. Tennessee we beat, but
we're playing there and we haven't
beat them there in a long time. So
we know that it's a really big chal
