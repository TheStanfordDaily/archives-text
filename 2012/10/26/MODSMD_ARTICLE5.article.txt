# BACK TO WORK
## VANDERVEER RELOADS 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team has a hard act to Mow
this year. On the heels of a 35-2 sea
son and perfect 18-0 Pac-12 slate,
the Card heads into this season
without Nnemka Ogwumike, an All-
American last season and the
WNBA rookie of the year this year
after being selected in the WNBA
Draft. The level of competition that
coach Tara VanDerveer's team
encounters this season will not pro
vide the Card with any time to
breathe, either. They will face both
Baylor and Tennessee on the road,
and take on the University of
Connecticut at home, games that
are always accompanied by plenty
of hype.
As VanDerveer said, a tough
schedule is just part of Stanford's
identity as a top program. "When
you play a great schedule like we do,
it gives you a sense of urgency
eveiy day in practice," she said.
"Baylor is undefeated and won the
national championship, we lost to
them last year. Connecticut we lost
to last year. Tennessee we beat, but
we're playing there and we haven't
beat them there in a long time. So
we know that it's a really big chal

Following the departure of several seniors, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike will have to step up her game this season for Stanford to compete in a deep Pac-12 conference.
lenge for us so it brings that sense of
urgency eveiy day to practice."
Although Stanford graduated
four players last year (Nneka
Ogwumike, Lindy La Rocque, Sarah
Boothe, and Grace Mashore), the
Cardinal does have a core of veteran,
if younger players. VanDerveer
expects that leadership will stem
from junior Wade Trophy candidate
and All-American Chiney Ogumike,
who averaged 15.0 points per game,
10.1 rebounds per game, and shot
58.3 percent from the field last sea
son.

"Cbiney is an excellent leader, a
fabulous rebounder, she has improved
her perimeter shooting, she knows
what we're doing, she concentrates
and works hard everyday,"
VanDerveer said. "She is going to be
the center of our team, no doubt. She's
going to have to come out and play
hard and play well every night for us
to be successful, but she does. She's a
warrior and I love coaching Chiney
and I think she'll have a great year."
Also joining Chiney in the return
ing starting lineup is senior Joslyn
Tinkle (8.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 39.7 3-pt FG
pet). As the only true senior on the
team, she brings a lot of experience to
a team that only boasts five upper
classmen. VanDerveer expects her to
help fill the leadership role.

It's a position Tinkle is prepared
to step into straightaway.
"Coming in, obviously, we've
talked about how a lot of the success
of our team came from seniors last
year," Tinkle said. "Obviously we all
bring different things to the table so
this year what I'm really focusing on
is attacking that position of being the
team leader, knowing that I'm the
only senior and being motivated that
this is the last year that I will ever be
able to play with these girls and wear
that Stanford jersey out there.
"I have a lot of experience and I've
been fortunate enough to be on three
successful teams that have advanced
to the Final Four so I know what it
takes to get there," she said.
With the young team, Tinkle
admits that there is a different feeling
to the team this year: "We've changed
our offense and our kind of strategy,
how to score, how to defend, and I
would say we are one of the quicker
teams that I have ever played on here
at Stanford and so it's been really fun
to see eveiyone's versatility come into
play and match that with our new
game plan," she said.
VanDerveer also pointed out that
returners Amber Orrange and Toni
Kokenis should be key contributors
on the team. Kokenis was an All-Pac
-12 guard as a sophomore last year

and Orrange was named honorable
mention to the Pac-12 All-Freshman
Team. VanDerveer said that Orrange
has improved even more since last
year and that Kokenis continues to
work hard in practice.
The major change in dynamic that
will come into play will be for
Ogwumike, as she starts the season
without the presence of her sister. She
relishes the chance to fill the void and
take over the game.
"I don't think I'm going to do any
thing different. We just go; we play
games. I'm not worried about creat
ing any legacy; I'm just worried about
getting our team to win," Ogwumike
said. "So it's about just working hard
every day in practice. I don't worry
about things that come in a day or a
week or a month. It's more about
what's gong on in the now. It was a
great two years [with my sister] but
I'm excited to be myself and figure
out who I'm going to be for the next
two years. So it's sort of bitter sweet
but I'm excited for this year."
This year will definitely hold some
excitement for the Card as they enter
the 2012-13 campaign with two pro
gram record-breaking streaks. They
claim the nation's longest home win
ning streak, having won 79 games in a
row at Maples Pavilion since the start
of the 2007-08 season, and they've

won a conference record 78 straight
games against Pac-12 schools.
In addition, the Card aims to cut
down the nets in March for the pro
gram's third national title since 1992,
and make their 12th Final Four
appearance. VanDerveer hopes that
the energetic and experienced duo of
Ogwumike and Tinkle will help guide
the team in the right direction and
help them realize their goals.
For Ogwumike, her list of goals is
focused and ambitious. "I'm just
focusing on trying to make sure we
have a great foundation for winning
another Pac-12 championship, anoth
er Pac-12 tournament championship,
and advancing to another Final Four,"
she said "Those are the only three
things that are on my mind."
Considering the mixture of young
talent and veteran experience on this
Stanford squad, these goals have a
great chance to be realized if the team
can fill the voids created by losing the
elder Ogwumike from what was a
truly dominant frontcourt.
Stanford will take the floor to open
the season with two exhibition games
next week and the official preseason
opener at home against Fresno State
on Nov. 9.
