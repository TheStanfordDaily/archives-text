# CAMPUS LIFE
## Safety report shows theft, assault trends 
### MAX BLOCK ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Despite a gradual decrease in the number of report
ed thefts, bicycle thefts remain the most common crime
on campus, according to the 2012 Stanford University
Safety, Security and Fire Report. The number of report
ed sexual assaults declined from 21 in 2010 to 12 in 2011,
the same number as in 2009. Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS) Chief Laura
Wilson described the campus as "a safe place to live and
work."
Sexual assaults
SUDPS did not offer an explanation for the
reported drop in sexual assaults. According to
Assistant Dean of Student Life Angela Exson and
Wilson, sexual assault often goes unreported.
"It is my belief that the number of reported
assaults is lower than the actual number of assaults
that take place on campus," Wilson wrote in an email
to The Daily. "Sexual assault has traditionally been an
under-reported crime according to national surveys."
According to the Justice Department's National
Crime Victimization Survey, 54% of sexual assaults
between 2006 and 2010 went unreported.
"We think there are more cases out there, they're
just not reported to us," SUDPS Public Information
Officer Bill Larson said.
SUDPS is taking steps to increase the frequency at
which sexual assault is reported, particularly through
outreach events designed to develop trust between the
police and the larger community.

"People are more apt to report crimes such as sex
ual assault or domestic violence to the police when
they have a personal relationship with an officer,"
Wilson said.
SUDPS officers spend time getting to know stu
dents through programs such as LAWGEN 209Q:
Community Police Academy, a one-unit course in
which students practice law enforcement skills like
evidence collection, self-defense tactics, field sobriety
testing and even high-speed driving. Between 16 and
28 faculty members and students have enrolled in the
course every year for the past four years.
According to Exson, who is also the director of the
Sexual Assault and Relationship Abuse Office
(SARA), around 84 percent of sexual assault victims
on college campuses know the perpetrator, which can
decrease the likelihood that a victim will report the
event. Exson also linked alcohol education and sexual
assault prevention.
"Simultaneous prevention efforts are necessary to
address alcohol and sexual assault as separate but co
related issues that are of great concern on college
campuses," Exson wrote in an email to The Daily.
According to Larson, individuals should not mis
take the connection between alcohol and sexual
assault for a causal relationship.
"We don't want people to think alcohol is the rea
son people commit sexual assault," Larson said. "It
may contribute to it, but the perpetrator is responsi
ble for their actions."
