## Stanford researchers develop long-lasting batteries 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Alice Phillips 
Researchers at the School of
Engineering have developed a bat
tery that can last one thousand
charge cycles —when a battery is
fully charged, depleted and
recharged without suffering from
electrode degradation, which is the
cause of charge capacity loss.
Yi Cui, associate professor of
Materials Science and Engineering,
led the research group. The study
appears in the October 2012 edition
of Nature Communications.
Typically, batteries degrade over
time due to the process of repeated
ly forcing ions from the cathode to
the anode when charging, then
allowing the ions to flow to the cath-

ode, providing the electrical current
during use.

Cui's team addressed the issue of
battery degradation by covering the
cathode with copper hexacyanofer
rate, which allows ions to easily
move to and from the cathode. The
team constructed the anode out of
activated carbon and polypyrrole, a
conductive polymer, to allow ions to
flow freely to and from the anode
without causing loss of the anode's
ability to hold a charge.
The battery's core is composed
of potassium ions in liquid solution.
The team highlighted the need to
provide power options in cases when
solar or wind-generated energy is
insufficient in a power grid.
"New types of energy storage
are needed in conjunction with the
deployment of solar, wind and other
volatile renewable energy sources
and then* integration with the elec
tric grid," the researchers wrote in
the article's abstract.
