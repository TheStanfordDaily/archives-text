## Break out the Power game 
### Sam Fisher 
Jumbo I-formation with two
tight ends. Taylor behind
Hewitt behind Eitz behind
Nunes. Ertz motions to the
wing. Snap. Power. Gain of
seven. Repeat.
Oh how beautifully ugly it was at
Memorial Stadium on Saturday
afternoon. Stanford's offense looked
Harbaugh-esque. Cal knew exactly
what play was coming (Power), and
exactly where Stepfan Taylor was
going, but couldn't stop it, allowing
the Card to run out the clock in a no
stress Big Game win.
Washington State comes into
town this weekend before the Card
takes a road trip to Colorado. These
next two opponents are the worst in
the Pac-12, and it just makes me want
to see Power all the more.

Let's put this into statistical per
spective. Against Stanford on
Saturday, Cal rushed for three yards
on 28 carries, coming out to a pathet
ic 3.9 inches per carry. The weekend
before, when Cal faced Washington
State in Pullman, the Golden Bears
rushed for 318 yards on 50 carries, or
an average of 6.4 yards per carry.
Let me make this very clear:
Washington State cannot stop
Stanford's running game. Stanford
will move the ball, dominate time of
possession and score enough points
to win easily. Any other result would
be a complete embarrassment and a
horrible omen for the tougher games
that lie ahead against Oregon State,
at Oregon, and at UCLA.
Power alone will not be enough in
those tougher games. However, if the
Big Game is any indication,
Stanford's offense is exponentially
more effective when Power works. I'd
love to see quarterback Josh Nunes
and the passing game make progress
over the next few weeks, but the con
tinuation of Stanford's success with
Power is absolutely vital, and is itself
the key to the game.

Stanford Offensive Line vs. WSU
Buck Travis Long
Travis Long is a man without a
true position. Listed as a buck line
backer by head coach Mike Leach,
Long spends his time moving
around between defensive line and
linebacker. However, no matter
where he lines up, Long is a pass
rushing menace. Since arriving at
Wazzu as a true freshman, Long has
started every single game the
Cougars have played and consistent
ly produced in those games.
Recruited as a tight end, Long
has the athleticism to rush the pass
er from anywhere on the field, and
his pass-rushing techniques take
advantage of this. Look for Long to
line up at defensive end like Ben
Gardner, at outside linebacker like
Trent Murphy, or shoot the A-gap
on the snap like Shayne Skov.
Stanford does have the pass
blocking talent on the offensive line
and in the backfield to stop Long
and his 7.5 sacks. The key to doing
so will be communication between
all of the offensive linemen, and Josh
Nunes needs to get the team to the
line of scrimmage with enough time
for center Sam Schwartzstein and
company to identify the correct
blocking scheme for Long.
If the offensive line ends up hav
ing trouble with Long, look for
Stanford to keep Stepfan Taylor in
the backfield to block on more pass
ing plays. Taylor is one of the best
pass-blocking backs in the country,
and definitely could be the one who
saves the day when Long runs free.
Stanford Secondary vs. WSU Wide
Receiver Marquess Wilson
It seems like every week,
Stanford is forced to go up against
one of the nation's top receivers, but
that's life in the 2012 Pac-12. Wilson,
a junior, is well on his way to his
third-consecutive 1,000-yard season
and is always looking for an oppor
tunity to prove his talent.
The last time Stanford hosted
Wazzu in 2010, Wilson had a field
day against Stanford's secondary.
The First-Team Freshman All-
American reeled in six catches for
150 yards, including burning the
Card on a 74-yard touchdown
reception. Wilson has the talent to
go off at any moment, making it
vital for Stanford to be completely
aware of his position on the field at
all times.
Washington State has little to no
running game, freeing up Stanford
to spend most of its time in the
nickel package. Expect Stanford to
try to keep Terrence Brown on
Wilson as much as possible, and no
matter who is matched up on
Wilson, look for safeties
Jordan Richards and Ed
Reynolds to help out over the
top.

The game changer in
Stanford's attempt to cover
Wilson could be the blitz.
Washington State is prone to
giving up the sack, and the
quicker Stanford's dominant
pass rushers can get to quar
terback Jeff Tuel, the less time
Wilson has to get open.
Stanford Tight End Zach
Ertz vs. WSU Defense
This is the matchup that
should have Stanford fans
licking their chops. Zach Ertz
is having perhaps the best

season in the country for a
tight end, leading the
Cardinal with 31 receptions
and 505 receiving yards,
while tying Levine Toilolo for
the team lead with three
touchdown catches.
Ertz's combination of 6-
foot-6-inch frame and bas
ketball player agility presents
matchup nightmares for
opponents of all levels.
Washington State has
nobody in its back seven who
stands over 6-foot-1. Zach
Ertz will be open all game to
the good throw.
Now add in Washington
State's struggles in stopping
the run, and it starts to get
really ugly. The Cougars let
Cal run for over 300 yards on
the ground in their last out
ing. Stepfan Taylor will look
to simply dominate on the
ground and take control of

the game.
If Taylor and the rest of
Stanford's running game are
successful, it will only add to
Zach Ertz's huge matchup
advantage. As Taylor's rush
ing yards increase,
Washington State's safeties
will creep closer and closer to
the line of scrimmage, setting
up play-action off of power.
Look for Ertz to break a few
big receptions off by the end
of the third quarter, fully seal
ing Stanford's easy win.

Sam Fisher is listed at 6-
foot-1 on his driver's license,
but is about as close to 6-foot
-1 as Levine Toilolo is to 5-
foot-1. Email him, reasons
