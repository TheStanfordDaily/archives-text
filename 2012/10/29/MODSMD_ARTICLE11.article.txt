# ROXY SASS
## CYBER lovin' 
### 
Like any other Stanfordian, Roxy
has a million things to do in a
(lay, not to mention people. Being
a campus-wide sexual icon takes up
more time than you'd think, and some
weeks Roxy is so exhausted that she
can't find the time to pick over and pick
up new boy toys (the figurative ones
Roxy always has time for toys ).
Recently, Roxy has embarked on a new
adventure to help with this conundrum:
online dating.
That's right Roxy Sass is trying
out a different type of "cyber," and she
made a profile on DateMySchool to
seek out some other lovers that are also
too ... tied up ... to meet people. Plus,
Roxy gets to lie on her back and let the
site do all the hard work for her. Roxy's
profile happens to be even more reveal
ing than her Saturday night outfits.
Roxy: interested in? You. Looking
for? A fun casual time. Likes? Orally
stimulating conversation and blood
pumping physical activities. Message me
now if you'll agree to massage me later;).
A lot of students are worried that
Internet daters are weird, but Roxy
promises that on this site, people are
only freaks in the sheets. Roxy recom
mends the experience to anyone textual
ly curious and ready to get caught in the
World Wide Web of desire. Except the
site isn't worldwide it's for college
and graduate students only.
Speaking of graduate students,
one sweet medical student got up the
courage to ask Roxy to brunch. Let's
just say he was hoping for more than
just buttering her biscuit. That's not to
say he was one of those typical sketchy
grads; Roxy's doctor of love turned out
to be just the medicine she needed. Yes,
he was able to give very thorough
physical examinations, but he was so
much more than that (as evidenced by
his extensive profile on
DateMySchool). And despite the
countless party hookups and hundreds
of adoring fans, Roxy has been craving
a little extra tender love and care.
Don't get Roxy wrong she's not
about to go looking for a serious rela
tionship ... but that's not what online
dating is about. How many people has
Roxy biked past on her way to class,
people like Doctor Love, who she
would have never met were it not for
sites like DateMySchool? Roxy's advice?
Take a chance on doing a little online
love searching yourself, you'll be sur
prised at what you'll find.
