# ROBLE RENDITION PAYS HOMAGE TO SWEDISH PLAYWRIGHT WITH 'MISS JULIE'
## 
### Rachel Mewes I FELLOW 
Imagine, for a moment, a world in which
having premarital sex leaves a woman with
no option but suicide.
In 1888, when August Strindberg wrote
"Miss Julie," such a scenario was entirely plau
sible. On Oct. 15 and Oct. 16, in a crowded and
sweltering Roble lounge, Stanford celebrated
the 100-year anniversary of the death of the
esteemed Swedish playwright by staging per
formances of this controversial play, which
explores the sordid topics of lust, love, class and
gender. Rehm Rush Ph.D. 'B5 directed Gabriel
Marin (Jean), Danielle Thys (Kristin) and
Arwen Anderson (Miss Julie) within the short
timespan of three weeks.
"Miss Julie" follows a similar trajectory to
"A Doll's House" and "Hedda Gabler," both
written by Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian play
wright who was writing around the same time
period as Strindberg. In both of Ibsen's plays,
a woman rebels against the stifling rigidity of
social expectations, and in the end must pay
the price. Both Ibsen and Strindberg were pio
neers of realism, taking theatre into the living
rooms of everyday people going about their
lives and exploring situations that were actual
ly possible, instead of using fantastical story
lines and having the actors speak to the audi
ence.
"Miss Julie" consists of three characters:
the flirtatious and strong-willed Count's
daughter, Miss Julie; Jean, the servant to the
Count; and the pious and obedient cook,
Christine. There is also a fourth character, the
Count himself, whom we never actually see but
who maintains an ominous presence on stage
in the form of a pair of black leather boots and

a bell which he uses to give Jean orders.
Miss Julie, on the night of Midsummer's
Eve, falls victim to passion and sleeps with Jean.
In that time, an unmarried woman engaging in
sexual relations with someone socially beneath
her is catastrophic, and Miss Julie is left with
two equally unpalatable options: if she stays,
she brings shame to herself and to her father; if
she goes, she risks ending up on the streets. In
the final minutes of the play, Jean hands her a
razor, and she walks offstage.
Miss Julie is a play rife with tension, drama
and taboo, regardless of having only three char
acters and no scene or costume changes.
However, the performance lacked the necessary
strength to make the characters and the situa
tion believable. The actors playing Miss Julie
and Jean were scattered in their portrayal of the
characters' emotions, making it difficult to
track their motives, and the attraction between
them seemed forced and awkward. The play
seemed to be divided into two parts: before and
after sex. The before sex portion was reasonably
fun, flirty and fight; the after, on the other
hand, was melodramatic chaos. One element
that came across very well, however, was the
obvious power shift from Miss Julie (based on
class) to Jean (based on gender) after they exit
ed the bedroom.
The play may not have fully embodied the
realism of Strindberg and Ibsen, but the panel
that followed with Drs. Bjorn Meidal, Myra
Strober and Irv Yalom engagingly examined
Strindberg and "Miss Julie" from multiple per
spectives.
Yalom, as a psychiatry professor,
approached the play as though Miss Julie were

his patient and took the audience step by step
through the hypothetical conversations he
would have and the medication he would pre
scribe.
He concluded by saying, "I think the real
patient I would like to see is Strindberg."
Meidal brought an expert s opinion to the
table, as the former president of the Strindberg
Society and the writer of several books on the
playwright. He teased out the differences
between Ibsen and Strindberg, explaining that
Ibsen stuck to a particular style, while
Strindberg was in a constant state of reinvention
and would fill whatever role was available to
him. When it came to his view on women, "the
position of the feminist writer was already taken
[by Ibsen], so he took the view of the misogy
nist," Meidal said.
As the Founding Director of the Clayman
Institute of Gender Research at Stanford,
Strober responded to Meidal's point by
explaining that, to some feminists, Strindberg
could appear misogynistic and to others, he
could be considered a feminist.
"To feminists today, he was a misogynist,"
Strober said. "For women who are man-hating,
this could be a feminist play."
The panelists discussed many aspects of
Strindberg's play with the audience, ranging
from the overarching themes of class, gender
and power, to the elements of Greek tragedy in
"Miss Julie," to whether or not Miss Julie actu
ally committed suicide in the end. The high
attendance and the engaging post-performance
discussion showed that "Miss Julie" and
Strindberg still resonate more than a hundred
years after their creation.
