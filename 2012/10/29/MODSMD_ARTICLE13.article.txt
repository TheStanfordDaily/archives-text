# THE 						TOP FIVE

Some months just don't
get enough credit.
November is so much
more than dropping tempera
tures and constant midterms. A
closer look at these underrated
30 days of autumn joy shows
how much potential this month
can have. Here are a few of
Intermission's favorite
November highlights.
■ THANKSGIVING
'Nuff said. As the quarter nears
its close and the doom of finals
approaches, Thanksgiving peeks
its head just in time for you to
eat away your sorrows, with

pious reverence paid to our
forefathers and without the
shame of everyday binge eating.
California's perpetual heat
begins to wane around this
time, but luckily mashed pota
toes and juicy turkey stuffing
assist in packing on some extra
pounds for warmth. Plus, after
two and a half months of dining
hall food, your palette will give
its thanks to finally taste a little
variety.
■ NO SHAVE NOVEMBER
Yes, NorCal hipsters tend to cel
ebrate this year-round, but for
the rest of the gents out there
November provides an oppor
tunity to experiment with that
chinstrap goatee-beard thing
that Ryan Gosling pulls off so
well. But, let's not promote gen
der inequality here ladies,
you can participate too. Call it
"Pas de Raser Novembre" and
pass that razor to the trashcan

so you can fully embrace your
new French hippie persona.
■ SCORPIOS
Anyone who was born this
month before the 21st is proba
bly the best person you know.
How could that be? Because
that person is a Scorpio fear
less, passionate, loyal and all
around awesome. The birthday
bashes that take place this
month always are the most
elaborate and memorable, so
don't decline any party invites
unless you want to miss the
soiree of the year!
■ DEMOCRACY, YEAH!
Every four years in the begin
ning of November, the coun
try's entire political atmosphere
changes. Presidential elections,
aside from the clamor of
democracy, present the most
visible chance for us new adults
to exercise our influence over

the government. Even though
folks between 18 and 24 are the
least likely to vote, Stanford stu
dents tend to defy this stereo
type and get so heated by poli
tics that they completely lose
their California cool.
■ SWEATER WEATHER
From April to October, chances
are the Farm is sunny and 80.
But come November, adorable
knits and trendy utilitarian boots
make a comeback and steal the
show. Scarves, skinny pants and
sweaters, oh my! The trendy
intellectuals show off how they
are smart dressers too, and
everyone around you looks cozy
and stylish at the same time.
H—ipsters' hoodies, scarves and
beanies suddenly become
unironic! Expert tip: Try out
those fall pickup lines too. "Nice
Northface. What do you look
like down south?" Works zero
percent of the time, every time.
