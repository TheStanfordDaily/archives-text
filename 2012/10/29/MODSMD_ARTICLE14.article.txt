WOMEN'S SOCCER
STANFORD 2
UCLA 1
10/27, Los Angeles

In the weekend's first match, the
small field affected the style of play.
The game took place in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, a stadium intend
ed for another type of football.
"It was difficult to open up the
play," Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe told GoStanford.com. "Abu
couldn't play wide, because there
was no width. And you couldn't play
over the defense because there was
no depth."
Stanford outshot USC 25-12
over the course of the game but was
unable to solve USC goalkeeper
Caroline Stanley during regulation.
In the first overtime, USC
appeared to win the match when
junior Elizabeth Eddy beat
Cardinal goalkeeper Emily Oliver
from close range. The goal was dis
allowed because of an offside call.
Stanford's three senior captains
teamed up to score the goal that
kept Stanford's Pac-12 title hopes
alive. Rachel Quon served in a fee
kick from just beyond midfield. Mariah
Nogueira found the ball and flicked it
on to a charging Garciamendez, who
directed the ball past Stanley to give
the Cardinal the win. It was the sen
ior defender's sixth goal of the sea
son.
"It was a crazy game," Ratcliffe
said. "And if you look at how tight
the field was, it was a good win."
The Cardinal then traveled to
UCLA's Drake Stadium for a
matchup between the nation's top
two teams. The game began at a

relentless pace as both teams
showed off their speed and athleti
cism. Seven minutes into the match,
sophomore midfielder Alex Doll had
Stanford's first opportunity when
she cracked a shot from 12 yards out
that bounced off the post.
UCLA answered in the 18th
minute when sophomore Sam
Mewis challenged Oliver with a long
shot, but the junior answered with a
clean save.
As the half continued the pace
didn't let up, but Stanford was able
to establish longer stretches of sus
tained possession.
With 15 minutes until halftime,
Stanford had a beautiful passing
sequence down the middle of the
field that led to a dangerous chance
by Stanford forward Chioma
Übogagu. The sophomore's shot
from eight yards out went just over
the crossbar.

Four minutes into the second
half, Mewis knocked Garciamendez
off the ball deep in the Stanford half.

The Cardinal bench appealed for a
foul, but no whistle came. On the
ensuing play, the Stanford defense
blocked three consecutive UCLA
shots before the ball fell to Bruin
freshman forward Taylor Smith on
the right side of the six-yard box.
Smith hit a slow roller that Oliver
could only watch as it trickled into
the net.

Throughout the game, the
Cardinal defense struggled to con
tain the speed of the Bruin attack.
Senior Madeleine Thompson, who
earned her third consecutive start in
the UCLA game, and Quon had
their hands full with speedy UCLA
forward Zakiya Bywaters, who is
currently leading the Pac-12 in goals.
In the 55th minute, Bywaters
blazed down the sideline and beat
her defender, but her shot was right
at Oliver.

In the 68th minute, Ratcliffe
substituted defender Annie Case
for forward Lo'eau Laßonta, push
ing freshman defender Laura

Liedle to the right side and Quon
into the attack. Immediately after
the substitution, Bywaters broke
through once again, but Oliver
made a leaping save to tip the shot
over the net.

The substitution began to pay
dividends, as Stanford was able to
move the majority of the play into
the UCLA half. With 13 minutes
left in the game, Übogagu received
the ball in the center of the field
approximately 30 yards away from
goal. The forward turned and ran at
the Bruin defense before taking a
sneaky shot that slid inside the right
post to tie the game it was just
the seventh goal UCLA had allowed
all season.

Quon made Ratcliffe's choice
look even better when she gave the
Cardinal the lead in the 79th minute.
After sustained Stanford pressure,
Übogagu crossed the ball in from
the left side. Quon took one touch to

Senior outside back Rachel Quon scored in the 78th minute on Sunday to give the No. 1 Stanford
women's soccer squad a 2-1 victory over No. 2 UCLA. Capping off a successful road trip to Los Angeles,
the Cardinal also defeated USC on Friday night and clinched its fourth consecutive conference title.
settle the ball and calmly slotted it
past Rowland. It was the first time
this year that the Bruins had allowed
more than a single goal.
"Quon is a fantastic player and I
know she is capable of playing cen
tral midfield," Ratcliffe said. "She is
capable of creating goals and scoring
goals, and she scored a great winner

today."
UCLA didn't go down without a
fight, but Oliver and the Cardinal
defense refused to break. With eight
minutes left, the Ail-American goal
keeper made another diving save on
a long-range effort from midfielder
Chelsea Cline to close the game for
the Cardinal.
With the win, Stanford broke
UCLAs 24-game undefeated run
and extended its own winning streak
within the Pac-12 to 41 consecutive
games.
"[The girls] work so hard,"
Ratcliffe said. "They showed their
character. I was very impressed with
how they came back and won that
game, because UCLA is a fantastic
team."
"We had two goals at the begin
ning of the season. The first was the
Pac-12 championship, and the sec
ond was another national title,"
Ratcliffe continued. "Our focus now
is to prepare for the postseason, and
hopefully we can go on a good run."
The regular season finale is next
weekend against Cal, leaving
Stanford one win from its fourth
straight perfect conference season.
After that, the Cardinal will all but
assuredly host its first NCAA tour
nament match on Friday Nov. 9.
