# Pac-12 title for Kroeger
## 
### NICOLAS SHUMP 
The Pac-12 Championship brought out the
best in both Stanford cross country teams on
Saturday, as they scored 82 points each to earn
top-three finishes at the Robinson Ranch Golf
Course in Santa Clarita, Calif.
In the women's 6-kilometer race, Arizona
junior Elvin Kibet and Oregon freshman Allie
Woodward pushed the pace early, but other top
runners including Stanford senior Kathy Kroeger
and Oregon senior Jordan Hasay did not let them
break away The last kilometer was an all-out
sprint in which Kroeger finally captured the elu
sive individual Pac-12 title Stanford's first since
2007 edging out Hasay by four seconds, 20:06
to 20:10. Kibet finished third (20:11) and
Woodward came in fifth (20:16), behind senior
teammate Alexi Pappas (20:12).
The No. 3 Oregon women (47 points) cap
tured their first team title since 1995, beating
out No. 5 Arizona (69) and No. 4 Stanford (82).
Led by Kroeger's victory, the Cardinal women
also received a top-10 finish from sophomore
Aisling Cuffe, who came in 10th overall (20:32).
Stanford's top five was rounded out by Jessica
Tonn in 13th (20:37), Cayla Hatton in 22nd
(20:52) and Megan Lacy in 37th (21:25).
After the race, a Pac-12 official interviewed
head coach Chris Miltenberg to ask for his reac
tion to Kroeger's victory.
"I'm so proud of her," he said. "You know, it's
her last Pac-12s. Yesterday she said, 'I want to
win.' I said, Well, let's work on how we're going to
run the race, and if we win that'll be the outcome.
And let's work on how we're going to execute it.'
She did a great job with working on all the things
we talked about that are really going to help her a
lot at NCAAs in three weeks. Stanford coming
home, Kathy, Pac-12 champion."
Kroeger herself talked about the strategy
early in the race, when Kibet and Woodward
tried to break away. "I tried to stay paced in and
stay composed and tucked in there and just wait
for a chance."
As the race unfolded, Kroeger said there was
no reason to leave anything in the tank. "I was
just giving it all I had," she said. "I knew it was
... almost finished and it ended up just being me
and Jordan on the home stretch, and I had a lit
tle bit left in my legs. It's not too often I'm able
to chase down Jordan Hasay, but today I was
able to so it was really fun."
Coming down to the finish line in first place
was a dream come true for the senior who had
finished second at Pac-12s the last two seasons.
"I knew I could do it today if the right situation
played out, and it did," she said. "I got lucky and
had a little bit of legs left at the end."
The men's 8-kilometer race, on the other
hand, did not have as much excitement at the

finish. Early on, the heavily favored Arizona duo
of Lawi Lalang and Stephen Sambu broke away
from the main pack, challenged only by Oregon
runners Trevor Dunbar and Parker Stinson. In
the second third of the race, they dropped the
Ducks as well. Lalang defended his individual
title by finishing one second ahead of his team
mate, 22:49 to 22:50. Dunbar and Stinson came
in next with the same time of 23:28. The
Cardinal men had two top-10 finishes, from Joe
Rosa in sixth (23:35) and Benjamin Johnson in
10th (23:43).
In the team competition, No. 2 Colorado
dominated with its effective pack running scor
ing just 49 points to defend its title, beating
N0.3 Stanford (82 points) and No.B Oregon (105
points). The Buffaloes, led by Blake Theroux in
7th (23:40), had 6 runners in the top 15, who
were separated by only 10 seconds. The rest of
the top five for the Cardinal men were comfort
ably in the top 30 Tyler Stutzman 17th
(24:03), Miles Unterreiner 20th (24:10) and Erik
Olson 29th (24:18).
Overall, the Cardinal performed well at
Santa Clarita, as it continues to build toward the
West Regional in two weeks and the NCAA
Championship in three. Both teams will end
their regular seasons next Saturday at the Doc
Adams Invitational in Davis, Calif.

teammate Alexi Pappas (20:12).
The No. 3 Oregon women (47 points) cap
tured their first team title since 1995, beating
out No. 5 Arizona (69) and No. 4 Stanford (82).
Led by Kroeger's victory, the Cardinal women
also received a top-10 finish from sophomore
Aisling Cuffe, who came in 10th overall (20:32).
Stanford's top five was rounded out by Jessica
Tonn in 13th (20:37), Cayla Hatton in 22nd
(20:52) and Megan Lacy in 37th (21:25).
After the race, a Pac-12 official interviewed
head coach Chris Miltenberg to ask for his reac
tion to Kroeger's victory.
"I'm so proud of her," he said. "You know, it's
her last Pac-12s. Yesterday she said, 'I want to
win.' I said, Well, let's work on how we're going to
run the race, and if we win that'll be the outcome.
And let's work on how we're going to execute it.'
She did a great job with working on all the things
we talked about that are really going to help her a
lot at NCAAs in three weeks. Stanford coming
home, Kathy, Pac-12 champion."
Kroeger herself talked about the strategy
early in the race, when Kibet and Woodward
tried to break away. "I tried to stay paced in and
stay composed and tucked in there and just wait
for a chance."
As the race unfolded, Kroeger said there was
no reason to leave anything in the tank. "I was
just giving it all I had," she said. "I knew it was
... almost finished and it ended up just being me
and Jordan on the home stretch, and I had a lit
tle bit left in my legs. It's not too often I'm able
to chase down Jordan Hasay, but today I was
able to so it was really fun."
Coming down to the finish line in first place
was a dream come true for the senior who had
finished second at Pac-12s the last two seasons.
"I knew I could do it today if the right situation
played out, and it did," she said. "I got lucky and
had a little bit of legs left at the end."
The men's 8-kilometer race, on the other
hand, did not have as much excitement at the

finish. Early on, the heavily favored Arizona duo
of Lawi Lalang and Stephen Sambu broke away
from the main pack, challenged only by Oregon
runners Trevor Dunbar and Parker Stinson. In
the second third of the race, they dropped the
Ducks as well. Lalang defended his individual
title by finishing one second ahead of his team
mate, 22:49 to 22:50. Dunbar and Stinson came
in next with the same time of 23:28. The
Cardinal men had two top-10 finishes, from Joe
Rosa in sixth (23:35) and Benjamin Johnson in
10th (23:43).
In the team competition, No. 2 Colorado
dominated with its effective pack running scor
ing just 49 points to defend its title, beating
N0.3 Stanford (82 points) and No.B Oregon (105
points). The Buffaloes, led by Blake Theroux in
7th (23:40), had 6 runners in the top 15, who
were separated by only 10 seconds. The rest of
the top five for the Cardinal men were comfort
ably in the top 30 Tyler Stutzman 17th
(24:03), Miles Unterreiner 20th (24:10) and Erik
Olson 29th (24:18).
Overall, the Cardinal performed well at
Santa Clarita, as it continues to build toward the
West Regional in two weeks and the NCAA
Championship in three. Both teams will end
their regular seasons next Saturday at the Doc
Adams Invitational in Davis, Calif.
