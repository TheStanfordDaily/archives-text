## Card keeps streak intact 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a battle from the beginning, but
the Stanford women's volleyball team
clinched its 18th consecutive win of the sea
son Friday night at Maples Pavilion against
the Arizona State Sun Devils to improve
their record to 20-2 overall. The matchup
started the second half of conference play
for the Card after it came out of the first half
leading the Pac-12 with an undefeated 12-0
record.

"When you get to the second half of the
season you are kind of prepared by the first
half," said head coach John Dunning. "We
want to keep improving so we can get some
distance between us and other people. When
we played at Arizona State six weeks ago we
won 25-23 in the fourth and it was a battle the
whole time, and our team remembers that and
knows we really had to step up. We beat them
and they wanted to beat us, and it was pretty
close. Almost every match in the Pac-12 is like
that, where we have to keep fighting."
The momentum started out in the Card's
favor as it hit .472 in the first set and commit
ted only one attack error. An impressive defen
sive start held the ASU offense to just .176,
and the Card decisively won the set 25-15.
The rest of the game, however, would prove
to be a struggle. ASU outhit Stanford .255 to
.200 in the second set and held the lead
throughout. A 5-0 run by Stanford tied the
game at 15, but a 6-0 run by ASU was too
much for the Card to overcome as the Sun
Devils took the set 25-19.
"Everyone was a little frustrated because
we knew we could do better, and everyone
knew what they needed to work on individual
ly," said junior outside hitter Rachel Williams.
"There was a lot of focus in the locker room
and we went over the list of things we needed
to get better at, and then we went out and did
it for the most part."
Williams led the team with 13 kills and
recorded a career-high .684 attack percentage.
Middle blocker Carly Wopat was another jun
ior who let her presence be known as the Card
came back strong in the third set. Wopat, who
made her 400 th career block, totaled seven
kills and four blocks.

"I think there was a shift in the
third game," Wopat said. "We start
ed going after balls that weren't per
fect and really scrambling for plays
that were difficult, but it gave us a lot
of energy. And I think that's where
the shift happened and we just start
ed making more and more plays and
we started playing our style of vol
leyball â€”just scrappy and every sin
gle player just playing together."
In the third set, the Card played
a completely different game defen
sively and held ASU to a .070 attack
percentage. It finished the match in
the fourth set with a 25-20 win.
Though ASU rallied late in the set to
come within just two points, fresh
man Brittany Howard and Williams
had four kills each to lead Stanford.
Freshman Inky Ajanaku added
three kills, while libero Kyle Gilbert
collected five digs. Macey Gardner
finished with a match-high 20 kills to
lead the Sun Devils. Arizona State's
record dropped to 15-10 overall, 4-10
in the Pac-12.
Freshman Jordan Burgess record
ed another double-double with 12
kills and seven digs, Ajanaku hit an
impressive .556 and Howard also
recorded a double-double with 10
kills and 14 digs. However, it was the
poise and experience ofWilliams and
Wopat that helped the Card snag the
3-1 victory.

Wopat recognized the need for a
resurgence of energy after the sec
ond-set loss and provided the pas
sionate spark to get the team going.
"Our team has been in a lot of tough
situations this year, and we have this
style of play where we go after every
ball and we're mentally tough. So I
think we did a really good job of
doing that," she said.
Next week, the Card travels to
play Oregon State and Oregon.
While Stanford remains the only
Pac-12 team undefeated in confer
ence play, Oregon has dropped just
one conference game, to the

Cardinal earlier in the season.
Dunning stressed the importance
of the Oregon game for the rest of
the season.
"We could put ourselves in the
driver's seat if we win, so there's no
way our team isn't going to be ready
for that," he said. "We know how
good they are and we know how we
played against them last time. I
think we learned a lot about how to
play them, and I'm sure it will be a
good match."
