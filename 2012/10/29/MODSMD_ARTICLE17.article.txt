# What's your deal, fans?

### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
As a Stanford student, it's
pretty hard to complain
very much. I go to a top
notch school that gives
me a scholarship, access
to great professors and facilities and
doesn't make me wait by the comput
er at 12:01 to pray I can get into maybe
my third- or fourth-choice classes
unless it's spring quarter wine tasting.
The people are mostly great. The
weather is awesome. I mean, besides
the ridiculous sticker price that is
inescapable at private schools these
days, it's hard to go wrong.
Now I know that I have a pretty
laid-back personality and I rarely get
too high or too low. But when it comes
to sports, I make a few exceptions.
And at the risk of sounding exactly like
the snobbish rich kid complaining
about minutiae that I spent three
paragraphs trying to avoid, Stanford
has got to be better when it comes to
our attendance at sporting events.
When I sat down to write this, I
was mostly upset because I had just
watched Stanford football slog
through four quarters of a game that it
should have dominated and escaped
by the skin of its not-so-threatening
teeth.
But I was one of a select few in
Stanford Stadium on Saturday. The
announced attendance was some
where around 41,000, but I'd take a
good guess that no more than 20,000
people walked through the gates at
any point during the game.
Students, the Red Zone was pretty
filled to start the game. Yay But then
it thinned, and thinned some more,
just as Washington State started to
come back and turn it into a pretty
hectic final 15 minutes.
That shouldn't happen just
because our team isn't the most excit
ing brand of Pac-12 football, with the
Marqise Lees and the spread offenses.
And it shouldn't happen because there
is no Andrew Luck. And it shouldn't
happen because Washington State is
winless in conference play
Because I was at the game when
San Jose State came to the Harm, and
there were a lot more than 20,000 peo
ple on hand for that humdinger of an
opponent. And I was at the game
when Duke was in town, and the Blue
Devils are a heck of a more unattrac
tive opponent then any Pac-12
matchup.
Worst of all, those games were
before school even was in session!
I was ashamed to sit in the press
box and listen to the reporters all but
openly mocking Stanford and its fans
for an abysmal showing in the stands
two weeks ago against Arizona. That
game was supposed to be our
Homecoming, and even if it was an
early Mckoff, how could we not have
the stands at least three-quarters
filled for what turned out to be a very
exciting game that went to overtime?
I get that we lost to Washington
and that really was a drag. And the
loss to Notre Dame was definitely
heartbreaking and we kind of got
robbed, no question about it. But just
because we haven't met the sky-high
expectations that Luck and company
put in place does not mean that I don't
expect people to come out and watch.
The team is still good, like really
good. If you haven't noticed, we are
knocking on the door of the top 10 in
the BCS once again, and we actually
control our own destiny in the Pac-12
title race with a clear path to the Rose
Bowl. Sure, it's unlikely because we
have to beat Oregon and Oregon
State, but wasn't that the exact same
scenario that presented itself last sea
son, and didn't we expect to lose to
USC earlier in the year?
I want to feel the same way I did
looking out on a packed Stanford
Stadium going nuts after the Trojans
fell, even if it's unreasonable to expect
that there aren't at least a few butts
missing from the seats. But 30,000
empty chairs and a noise level so low
that Washington State's fans were
louder than we were at one point and I
could hear some of the quarterback's
calls fi*om the press box? Stop it.
The problem is not that I can't
enjoy the games when there aren't
fans in the stands, because it really
doesn't affect me. But when the televi
sion broadcast can't pan over the
crowd and resorts to the same two sec
tions of fans for eveiy one of its cut
aways, it reflects poorly on our entire
community as fans.
The pundits love to talk about how
smart the students at Stanford are,
particularly when the baseball team or

basketball team is traveling and seen
studying gasp—for a final a few
hours before a game.
But they also love to talk about
how the Stanford culture is different
and doesn't have anywhere near the
same kind of respect and love for the
game that the SEC or Big 10 or pret
ty much any other region of the coun
try does.
That bugs me. Because last night I
watched the No. 1 women's soccer
team score twice in two minutes to put
UCLA in its place and win a fourth
consecutive Pac-12 crown. They
haven't lost a conference match in 41
games.
The game was in LA, so I was
n't there and mostly likely neither
were you, but I know the attendance
was over 4,000, and when I watched
the team knock off Washington at
home for Senior Night last week
end, there were definitely some
empty seats.
Just like I know that there was
plenty of room in the stands for view
ers to spread out when the No. 2
women's volleyball team swept past
Aizona State for its 18th win in a row
and 12th consecutive Pac-12 victory.
That kind of dominance and excel

lence deserves to be experienced and
rewarded by Stanford fans near and
far. And when basketball season gets
into gear, I dorit want to look into
the rafters to see line after line of
empty rows and a Sixth Man section
half-filled with students sitting
down.
I know that all of us are prideful
beings, and many of us don't care for
sports at all. More power to you.
There are plenty of Stanford fans out
there that are missing the boat with
these games, however. How lucky are
we, Class of 2013, that we have never
seen USC triumph over the Cardinal
on the gridiron, have had a national
championship to celebrate every year
and have gotten get to soak up the
attention that Andrew Luck, Jim
Harbaugh and being good has
brought to the University as a whole?
We are a lucky brand of people at
Stanford, for innumerable different
reasons.
But for that reason you must take
pride in what you do, if what you do
is like Stanford athletics.
If you were heading to AT&T Park

and it was $6OO a pop for standing
room.-only tickets.... Email him your
