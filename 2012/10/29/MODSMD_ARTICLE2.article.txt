# Casa's Pizzeria sells out in record time
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
The 200 available tickets to Casa Italiana's
Nov. 3 Pizzeria event were sold out in 22 sec
onds after the reservation form opened at 10
p.m. on Saturday. The waitlist was closed 13
minutes later after 552 people signed up,
according to Casa Financial Manager Mak
Klein 'l4. This is the fastest sell-out time in
Pizzeria history.

"I think... the reason it's so attractive to
people at Stanford is it's a nice middle ground
between a party and away to hang out with
your friends," Casa Community Manager Alex
Walker 'l3 said. "It's a once-a-quarter thing, so
people leap at the opportunity."
Casa Italiana's Pizzeria originated decades
ago as a small weekly dinner for the house
before becoming a quarterly event open to any
body with a ticket salad, pizza, gelato and,
for those over 21, wine included on Casa's
lawn, weather permitting.
Students who successfully submitted the
form from the first link posted on the Pizzeria
Facebook page will attend Pizzeria, pending
payment. Students must pay $l5 per attendee
for their full reservations by 8 p.m. on Oct. 31.
Once the 207 th person completed the reserva
tion form, Klein closed it, then opened the wait
list form at 10:03 p.m.
Ticket sales for next weekend's event were
capped at 15 per reservation. Most reserva

tions were for groups of eight to 15, and while
students were allowed to make multiple reser
vations of 15 tickets, none did.
"Because it went so fast, people didn't have
enough time to do the form twice to get a group
of 30," Klein said. "People who were on the
website right at 10 and filled it out didn't get
[tickets]."
He added that much of the anticipation for
fall Pizzeria is due to the positive experiences
that attendees reported at the spring Pizzeria,
which hosted its 450 guests, a record-high
number, in two successive seatings. Tickets
sold out in four hours, which at the time had
been unprecedented, according to Klein.

While winter Pizzeria is always smaller
because of the unpredictable weather, Klein
said Casa staff is planning to repeat last
spring's Pizzeria format this spring. Klein said
that the staff would like to do two big seatings
again to accommodate as many people as possi
ble.

"The reason it was such a successful
process this year is because the staff worked so
hard to put the event together," Walker said.
"[We're] really excited to have people over and
show them what Casa is all about."
