## Film program low on production offerings 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
Stanford's undergraduate film program,
created in 2005, is one of the University's
smallest programs, with 26 majors and seven
minors, and rarely shows up on any national
rankings. While the major suffers from a lack
of production classes, limiting hands-on expe
rience in film creation, alumni and current
majors praise the analytical and theoretical
foundation that Stanford classes offer.

According to film and media studies assis

tant professor Jamie Meltzer, while Stanford's
master's degree in documentary film is "leg
endary," the undergraduate equivalent is pri
marily focused on film analysis, with a much
smaller production component.
Because only seven of the 26 course offer
ings in the film program are production
based, students seeking production experi
ence often turn to the Stanford Film Society
(SFS), which hosts weekly advanced film
workshops that allow students to discuss proj
ects they are working on independently.

According to Alex Simon 'l4, the director
of the Advanced Film Workshop, the
University does not provide advanced produc
tion resources for independent student use.
All the cameras and equipment used by the
estimated 30 students who attend the work
shop every week have to be purchased by the
SFS using special fees funding, which Simon
said is enough to cover the expenses.
Simon said she teaches students how to use
cameras and the Final Cut Pro
editing software in the workshop,
as these skills are not emphasized
in the film department's classes.
"The vast majority of the class
es are theory-based. You're not
really getting to make films in
hardly any of the classes," Simon
said.

Most of the classes focus on
screenwriting, leading students to
search elsewhere for experience,
said Shaine Meulmester 'l4, a film
and media studies major.

"For students who have more
of a desire to participate in film
production, they don't find it in the
department, but in other outlets
on campus," Meulmester said. "A
lot of the film production happens
outside of the courses; it is more of
an independent initiative by stu
dents."

Meulmester, who came to
Stanford wanting to study film,
said that Stanford "didn't make
any of the lists" of top film schools.
"I just don't think people natu
rally associate Stanford with film,"
she said, adding that only five to
10 other students in the Class of
2014 share her major.
This analytical focus is not
unique to Stanford. UC-
Berkeley's film program is also

mostly based on theory, with a
much smaller production compo
nent. But schools in Southern
California, especially those in or
near Los Angeles, show a much
more intense focus on film produc
tion.

UCLA's School of Theater,
Film and Television offers a
Bachelor of Arts in film and televi
sion, as well as a film, television
and digital media minor. The uni
versity is offering 82 film courses
this year, 35 of which have a pro
duction or laboratory component.
The University of Southern
California's School of Cinematic
Arts has 848 undergraduate
majors and minors, with 85 full
time and 200 part-time staff. It
offers five different Bachelor of
Arts majors and one interdiscipli
nary Bachelor of Science major.
For the fall semester, USC offered
almost 200 courses in the School of
Cinematic Arts, with 63 courses
focused on various aspects of pro
duction.

"[USC] just has a better pro
gram," said Will Rogers 'O9, a film
and media studies alumnus.
Rogers believes that Stanford's
film and media studies program is
purposely based on analysis, not
production, in order to avoid com
parison with schools like USC.

"Stanford doesn't want to
attempt to compete with the big
film school programs," he said. "It
would make Stanford look bad to
go up against the other California

schools that really cater to the
type of student that wants to go to
college to study film."
Meulmester agreed and said
she has heard a similar theory
expressed by some of the faculty
in the film department. She said
this might explain why Stanford
has not attempted to expand the
program's production component.
According to Meulmester,
Stanford has only one real produc
tion course, Film Prod 114:
Introduction to Film and Video
Production, which she said is diffi
cult to get into because of high
demand.
Rogers said that when he
attended Stanford, approximately
half of the 12 students in the film
studies program wanted more pro
duction opportunities that the
University could not provide.
Meulmester reported similar
demand.
Stanford's production class
offerings may not be as robust as
other schools, but both
Meulmester and Rogers agreed
that Stanford's program provides
a valuable and strong foundation
in film analysis.
"Stanford offers some qualita
tive pieces that allow us to catch
up in the long run," Rogers said.
"We are at an immediate disad
vantage, but it is pretty easy to
catch up."

ects they are working on independently.

According to Alex Simon 'l4, the director
of the Advanced Film Workshop, the
University does not provide advanced produc
tion resources for independent student use.
All the cameras and equipment used by the
estimated 30 students who attend the work
shop every week have to be purchased by the
SFS using special fees funding, which Simon
said is enough to cover the expenses.
Simon said she teaches students how to use
cameras and the Final Cut Pro
editing software in the workshop,
as these skills are not emphasized
in the film department's classes.
"The vast majority of the class
es are theory-based. You're not
really getting to make films in
hardly any of the classes," Simon
said.

Most of the classes focus on
screenwriting, leading students to
search elsewhere for experience,
said Shaine Meulmester 'l4, a film
and media studies major.

"For students who have more
of a desire to participate in film
production, they don't find it in the
department, but in other outlets
on campus," Meulmester said. "A
lot of the film production happens
outside of the courses; it is more of
an independent initiative by stu
dents."

Meulmester, who came to
Stanford wanting to study film,
said that Stanford "didn't make
any of the lists" of top film schools.
"I just don't think people natu
rally associate Stanford with film,"
she said, adding that only five to
10 other students in the Class of
2014 share her major.
This analytical focus is not
unique to Stanford. UC-
Berkeley's film program is also

mostly based on theory, with a
much smaller production compo
nent. But schools in Southern
California, especially those in or
near Los Angeles, show a much
more intense focus on film produc
tion.

UCLA's School of Theater,
Film and Television offers a
Bachelor of Arts in film and televi
sion, as well as a film, television
and digital media minor. The uni
versity is offering 82 film courses
this year, 35 of which have a pro
duction or laboratory component.
The University of Southern
California's School of Cinematic
Arts has 848 undergraduate
majors and minors, with 85 full
time and 200 part-time staff. It
offers five different Bachelor of
Arts majors and one interdiscipli
nary Bachelor of Science major.
For the fall semester, USC offered
almost 200 courses in the School of
Cinematic Arts, with 63 courses
focused on various aspects of pro
duction.

"[USC] just has a better pro
gram," said Will Rogers 'O9, a film
and media studies alumnus.
Rogers believes that Stanford's
film and media studies program is
purposely based on analysis, not
production, in order to avoid com
parison with schools like USC.

"Stanford doesn't want to
attempt to compete with the big
film school programs," he said. "It
would make Stanford look bad to
go up against the other California

schools that really cater to the
type of student that wants to go to
college to study film."
Meulmester agreed and said
she has heard a similar theory
expressed by some of the faculty
in the film department. She said
this might explain why Stanford
has not attempted to expand the
program's production component.
According to Meulmester,
Stanford has only one real produc
tion course, Film Prod 114:
Introduction to Film and Video
Production, which she said is diffi
cult to get into because of high
demand.
Rogers said that when he
attended Stanford, approximately
half of the 12 students in the film
studies program wanted more pro
duction opportunities that the
University could not provide.
Meulmester reported similar
demand.
Stanford's production class
offerings may not be as robust as
other schools, but both
Meulmester and Rogers agreed
that Stanford's program provides
a valuable and strong foundation
in film analysis.
"Stanford offers some qualita
tive pieces that allow us to catch
up in the long run," Rogers said.
"We are at an immediate disad
vantage, but it is pretty easy to
catch up."

Stanford's undergraduate film program,
created in 2005, is one of the University's
smallest programs, with 26 majors and seven
minors, and rarely shows up on any national
rankings. While the major suffers from a lack
of production classes, limiting hands-on expe
rience in film creation, alumni and current
majors praise the analytical and theoretical
foundation that Stanford classes offer.

According to film and media studies assis

tant professor Jamie Meltzer, while Stanford's
master's degree in documentary film is "leg
endary," the undergraduate equivalent is pri
marily focused on film analysis, with a much
smaller production component.
Because only seven of the 26 course offer
ings in the film program are production
based, students seeking production experi
ence often turn to the Stanford Film Society
(SFS), which hosts weekly advanced film
workshops that allow students to discuss proj
ects they are working on independently.
