# STUDENT GROUPS
## Stripping down at Stanford Nudity is a key part of many beloved student traditions 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has more than a few odd
traditions, from rallying the freshmen
with Band Run and making out with the
Tree once a year to jumping around
campus fountains and screaming out
windows when finals come around. But
only one tradition runs through almost
all the others nudity.
And while co-ops organize clothing
optional events most frequently, not all
proud birthday-suit-wearers belong to
the co-op community.
Co-ops Synergy, Columbae and Chi
Theta Chi are famous for their resi
dents' proclivity for baring skin, but
some all-campus parties, like 680
Lomita's Exotic Erotic and Kappa
Sigma's now-defunct Foam Party, also
encourage at least partial nudity.
Stanford Sierra Camp is another
non-co-op group that is known for its
comfort with nudity. However, most of
the nudity from Sierra Camp occurs far
from campus, at camp in Fallen Leaf,
Calif.

"To be able to show who you are
completely... and not hiding any part of
you, is a really liberating feeling," said
Mia Divecha 'l3 who has previously
worked at Stanford Sierra Camp.
For the modest strippers, body paint
covers up what clothing doesn't.
"Especially at Frill Moon [on the
Quad] where there are more freshmen,
[body paint] makes the nakedness sillier
and less intimidating," said Elizabeth
Matus 'l4, a Synergy resident. "We're
not trying to make anybody feel bad
about being naked; we're just trying to
lighten the mood."
"It's cool to use your body as a can
vas for art," said Francisca Gilmore 'l3,
Columbae community manager.
