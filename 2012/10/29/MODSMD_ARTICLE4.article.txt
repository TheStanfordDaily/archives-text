# STUDENT GROUPS
## Stripping down at Stanford Nudity is a key part of many beloved student traditions 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has more than a few odd
traditions, from rallying the freshmen
with Band Run and making out with the
Tree once a year to jumping around
campus fountains and screaming out
windows when finals come around. But
only one tradition runs through almost
all the others nudity.
And while co-ops organize clothing
optional events most frequently, not all
proud birthday-suit-wearers belong to
the co-op community.
Co-ops Synergy, Columbae and Chi
Theta Chi are famous for their resi
dents' proclivity for baring skin, but
some all-campus parties, like 680
Lomita's Exotic Erotic and Kappa
Sigma's now-defunct Foam Party, also
encourage at least partial nudity.
Stanford Sierra Camp is another
non-co-op group that is known for its
comfort with nudity. However, most of
the nudity from Sierra Camp occurs far
from campus, at camp in Fallen Leaf,
Calif.

"To be able to show who you are
completely... and not hiding any part of
you, is a really liberating feeling," said
Mia Divecha 'l3 who has previously
worked at Stanford Sierra Camp.
For the modest strippers, body paint
covers up what clothing doesn't.
"Especially at Frill Moon [on the
Quad] where there are more freshmen,
[body paint] makes the nakedness sillier
and less intimidating," said Elizabeth
Matus 'l4, a Synergy resident. "We're
not trying to make anybody feel bad
about being naked; we're just trying to
lighten the mood."
"It's cool to use your body as a can
vas for art," said Francisca Gilmore 'l3,
Columbae community manager.
The Honor Code and Rindamental
Standard are silent about nudity and
though it is illegal for someone to
"willfully and lewdly" expose them
selves in public according to the
California Penal Code, the Stanford
University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) interprets the law
on indecent exposure liberally.
"The important aspect of this law
is the introduction, which indicates
the behavior must be willful and
lewd. ...As a general rule, police
officers are taught that nudity in and
of itself is not a crime," Police Chief
Laura Wilson said in a statement to
The Daily.
Students who choose to shed
their clothing on campus claim lewd
ness is not the goal, but rather
acceptance and trust.
"It's not about being naked, it's
about being comfortable and having
fun," Gilmore said.
"It really helps when you get a
bunch of people 0f... different
shapes and colors to ... make people

realize that if this person can run
around naked and is comfortable ...
then maybe I could too," Matus said.
In 2007, a group of students even
used nudity as a form of protest
against clothing made in sweatshops
bearing the Stanford University
logo.
Communities such as co-ops and
Sierra Camp that engage in group
nudity believe the community's
closeness creates a trusting atmos
phere that allows students to feel
comfortable clothes-free.
"I think when that when that
care is there, there is a comfort level
that people have with each other,
and I think there is less fear of judg
ment," Divecha said.
However, people from Synergy,
Columbae and Stanford Sierra
Camp all emphasized that part of
the trust and comfort in their com
munity included being comfort
able enough to say, "Enough nudi
ty-"
"We encourage people to find
their own comfort level in the
house," Gilmore said.
Gaieties and Rill Moon on the
Quad have passed, though students
still have several reliable chances to
see their classmates in the nude,

notably the libraries during Dead
Week and Spring Quarter Band
Run.
"I get naked to feel body-posi
tive," said Synergy resident Elias
Rodriques 'l3. "Once you're out
there it's like, 'Well, it's not that big
of a deal. This is my body.'"
