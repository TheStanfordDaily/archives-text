# CRISIS AVERTED
## NO. 14 STANFORD HOLDS OFF LATE WAZZU RALLY 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
That's why on Saturday after
noon the second-worst defense in
the conference found away to limit
a Doak Walker Award candidate
to 58 yards on the ground. That's
why on Saturday afternoon a pass
defense that gives up over 287
yards through the air each game
managed to hold a quarterback to
136 passing yards. It's why on
Saturday afternoon the outcome
of the game was much closer than
many predicted.
A win is a win, but it certainly
was not the way head coach David
Shaw drew it up.
A 24-point favorite going in to
the game, No. 14 Stanford (6-2,4-
1 Pac-12) escaped with an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory over a scrap
py Washington State (2-6, 0-5)
team that refused to quit.
"We played to about 70-75 per
cent of our capabilities," said Shaw.
"We did not play as well as we
practiced. We played hard, but the

execution was lacking."
The Stanford defense broke a
school record by sacking Cougars
quarterback Jeff Tuel 10 times but
also allowed the senior to complete
over 71 percent of his passes for
401 yards. One-upping its domi
nant shutdown of Cal a week ago,
the Cardinal run defense also held
Washington State to -16 yards on
the ground, a statistic made less
impressive only by the fact that
the Cougars rushing attack is cur
rently ranked dead last in the
nation.
However, finding bright spots
in the Cardinal offense's perform
ance is a different story, as
Washington State outgained
Stanford 385 yards to 256.
Quarterback Josh Nunes had one
of his worst outings at home,
underthrowing and overthrowing
open receivers on numerous occa
sions to finish the game with 7-of
-15 passing for only 136 yards and a
touchdown.

"We had a good practice,"
Nunes commented. "It just didn't
show up out there in the game.
They did some good things, but I
feel like we shot ourselves in the
foot a decent amount, too. We
know that we can get more pro
duction out there and that there
were some plays that we left out

Games are always played out
differently on the field than they
are on paper.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Free safety Ed Reynolds (29) intercepted Wazzu's Jeff Tuel for a pick-six to give the Cardinal a 14-point lead in
the early minutes of the fourth quarter. The junior is ranked second in the nation in interception yardage.
there."
Dating the redshirt junior
to throw all afternoon, the
Cougars' defense effectively
loaded the box and limited
Stanford's ground game to 120
yards. On some run plays, sen
ior halfback Stepfan Taylor
had to do all he could just to
get back to the line of scrim
mage.
"Stepfan got the ball at
least five times off the top of
my head and as soon as he
touched the ball there was a
guy in the backfield," said
Shaw. 'A guy that should've
been accounted for ...For
Stepfan to have 20 carries and
the limited yards that he had,
that's not up to our standard.
We can do so much better and
we didn't."
Stanford's opening drive
didn't exactly foreshadow the
offensive struggles it would
have later in the game. True
freshman wide receiver Kodi
Whitfield made his first career
catch to pick up a first down,
and a 17-yard dash by the
speedy Anthony Wilkerson
two plays later allowed Jordan
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal. Just like that, the
Cardinal was up 3-0.
"It was great finally having
the hard work pay off," said
Whitfield. "The coaches put in
a plan for me and got me an
early touch. It just feels good
to finally transfer practice into
the game."

Wazzu had trouble main
taining its drives in the early
going. Though Thel managed

to convert a few third downs
with accurate passes to wide
outs Gabe Marks and Gino
Simone, the Cougars failed to
cross its own 40-yard line on all
three of its possessions in the
first quarter. It also didn't help
that the Stanford front seven
was manhandling Washington
State's offensive line and
bringing the heat on Thel, who
was sacked five times by four
different Cardinal defenders in
the first quarter alone.
But it was only a matter of
time before Mike Leach's air
raid would inflict some dam
age.

After an inconsequential
Stanford possession, the
Cougars took a 7-3 lead in the
early minutes of the second
quarter when Dominique
Williams, who finished with a
game-high nine receptions for
100 yards, hauled in Tuel's
back-shoulder pass for a 3-yard
touchdown, despite being
interfered with. The score
capped an 11-play, 88-yard
drive that saw Tuel taking
whatever the Stanford second
ary was giving him by finding
his targets on short passes
beneath the coverage.
"We're no stranger to Jeff
Tuel," said Ben Gardner, who
recorded 2.5 tackles for loss
and 1.5 sacks. "We've seen him
the past two years and he
always seems to play well
against us. That guy battles.
He took some hits tonight and
he got back up and kept fight
ing. He's a heck of a quarter
back. He's a warrior."

The Cardinal struck right
back on its next drive to retake
the lead as Nunes connected
with a wide-open Jamal-
Rashad Patterson for a 70-
yard touchdown. Nunes was

averaging less than a yard per
pass attempt before the touch
down throw, which also ended
up accounting for over half of
his total passing production.
"I thought there were a
couple times [Nunes] made
good plays," commented Shaw
"We still got our hands on a
couple balls we should've
caught, but he missed a couple
throws we need to make."

In closing out the first half,
Tuel took advantage of the
Cardinal's soft coverage and
engineered a field-goal-scor
ing drive to tie the game at 10
apiece. The Cougar quarter
back converted a critical
fourth-and-6 at the Stanford
40 before driving all the way
down to the 6-yard line, where
Andrew Furney hit a 24-yard
field goal as time expired.
The Cardinal's first posses
sion of the third quarter
proved to be its best drive of
the game, a 13-play, 78-yard
touchdown-scoring chive that
took almost seven minutes
a vast improvement for
Stanford after being out-pos
sessed by over 12 minutes in
the first half. Recording his
first touchdown of the season
and the first rushing touch
down of his career, fullback
Ryan Hewitt punched it in on
third-and-goal from the
Cougars' 1-yard line to give the
Cardinal a 17-10 lead.

After stifling Washington
State's offense for the entire
third quarter, it seemed as if
Stanford had finally put the
pesky Cougars away for good
when free safety Ed Reynolds
intercepted Thel in the fourth
quarter and took it to the
house for a 25-yard touch
down. It was Reynolds' fourth
interception and second pick

six of the season, and the soph
omore standout is now second
in the nation in interception
yardage.
"I just read the call that
allowed me to cheat over
there," said Reynolds. "The
quarterback just stared a little
bit and had been playing most
ly to that side all game, the free
man side. I went, stole second
and got one. For myself, it's
just keep going out and work
ing on the little things to help
this team get better."
But the two-touchdown
deficit did little to faze
Washington State.
Ihel rattled off eight com
pletions on the ensuing drive to
put seven points on the board
in a hurry, with Kristoff
Williams' 10-yard touchdown
reception sealing the deal.
Stanford proceeded to run
down the clock as much as pos
sible on its next possession.
Nunes found Whitfield for a
critical third-down conversion,
but the Cougars' defense
locked down and forced the
drive to stall near midfield.

"I'm not going to take any
thing away from those

[Washington State] guys," said
Shaw, "H'avis Long is proba
bly one of my favorite guys in
our conference that's not on
our team. That guy plays hard
... he beat us a few times
tonight."
Long's five tackles on the
day didn't do justice to the
impact he had on the game
he consistently disrupted plays
in the backfield and made crit
ical stops on Taylor in the
fourth quarter to give the
Cougars a fighting chance.
Washington State got the
ball back with 3:37 left in the
game, needing a touchdown
to send the game into over
time. Tuel methodically
dished the ball to four differ
ent receivers and miraculous
ly converted a fourth-and-21
to march the Cougars all the
way down to the Stanford 9-
yard line.
But a costly intentional
grounding penalty took 10
seconds off the clock and
moved Wazzu back 10 yards.
On second-and-goal at the
Stanford 19, Tuel dropped
back and scanned for an open
target in the end zone, but

was gobbled up by defensive
end Henry Anderson before
he could unload. With no
timeouts left, the Cougars
could only watch the clock run
down to zero as their come
back fell short.

"It definitely wasn't the
kind of game we wanted to
play," said Nunes. "Coach
Shaw said it earlier: We can
definitely play better. The
defense did a lot of great things
all night. Offensively, we have
to get going, we have to be
more efficient get the
chains moving on third down
and get [the defense] a break."
With Oregon State falling
to Washington on Saturday
night, the Cardinal is currently
tied with the Beavers for sec
ond place in the Pac-12 North
standings and controls its own
postseason destiny
Up next for Stanford is a
road trip to Boulder, where the
Cardinal hopes to take care of
business against Colorado
before its showdown with
Oregon State in two weeks.

That's why on Saturday after
noon the second-worst defense in
the conference found away to limit
a Doak Walker Award candidate
to 58 yards on the ground. That's
why on Saturday afternoon a pass
defense that gives up over 287
yards through the air each game
managed to hold a quarterback to
136 passing yards. It's why on
Saturday afternoon the outcome
of the game was much closer than
many predicted.
A win is a win, but it certainly
was not the way head coach David
Shaw drew it up.
A 24-point favorite going in to
the game, No. 14 Stanford (6-2,4-
1 Pac-12) escaped with an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory over a scrap
py Washington State (2-6, 0-5)
team that refused to quit.
"We played to about 70-75 per
cent of our capabilities," said Shaw.
"We did not play as well as we
practiced. We played hard, but the

execution was lacking."
The Stanford defense broke a
school record by sacking Cougars
quarterback Jeff Tuel 10 times but
also allowed the senior to complete
over 71 percent of his passes for
401 yards. One-upping its domi
nant shutdown of Cal a week ago,
the Cardinal run defense also held
Washington State to -16 yards on
the ground, a statistic made less
impressive only by the fact that
the Cougars rushing attack is cur
rently ranked dead last in the
nation.
However, finding bright spots
in the Cardinal offense's perform
ance is a different story, as
Washington State outgained
Stanford 385 yards to 256.
Quarterback Josh Nunes had one
of his worst outings at home,
underthrowing and overthrowing
open receivers on numerous occa
sions to finish the game with 7-of
-15 passing for only 136 yards and a
touchdown.

"We had a good practice,"
Nunes commented. "It just didn't
show up out there in the game.
They did some good things, but I
feel like we shot ourselves in the
foot a decent amount, too. We
know that we can get more pro
duction out there and that there
were some plays that we left out

10/27, Stanford Stadium


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Free safety Ed Reynolds (29) intercepted Wazzu's Jeff Tuel for a pick-six to give the Cardinal a 14-point lead in
the early minutes of the fourth quarter. The junior is ranked second in the nation in interception yardage.
there."
Dating the redshirt junior
to throw all afternoon, the
Cougars' defense effectively
loaded the box and limited
Stanford's ground game to 120
yards. On some run plays, sen
ior halfback Stepfan Taylor
had to do all he could just to
get back to the line of scrim
mage.
"Stepfan got the ball at
least five times off the top of
my head and as soon as he
touched the ball there was a
guy in the backfield," said
Shaw. 'A guy that should've
been accounted for ...For
Stepfan to have 20 carries and
the limited yards that he had,
that's not up to our standard.
We can do so much better and
we didn't."
Stanford's opening drive
didn't exactly foreshadow the
offensive struggles it would
have later in the game. True
freshman wide receiver Kodi
Whitfield made his first career
catch to pick up a first down,
and a 17-yard dash by the
speedy Anthony Wilkerson
two plays later allowed Jordan
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal. Just like that, the
Cardinal was up 3-0.
"It was great finally having
the hard work pay off," said
Whitfield. "The coaches put in
a plan for me and got me an
early touch. It just feels good
to finally transfer practice into
the game."

Wazzu had trouble main
taining its drives in the early
going. Though Thel managed

to convert a few third downs
with accurate passes to wide
outs Gabe Marks and Gino
Simone, the Cougars failed to
cross its own 40-yard line on all
three of its possessions in the
first quarter. It also didn't help
that the Stanford front seven
was manhandling Washington
State's offensive line and
bringing the heat on Thel, who
was sacked five times by four
different Cardinal defenders in
the first quarter alone.
But it was only a matter of
time before Mike Leach's air
raid would inflict some dam
age.

After an inconsequential
Stanford possession, the
Cougars took a 7-3 lead in the
early minutes of the second
quarter when Dominique
Williams, who finished with a
game-high nine receptions for
100 yards, hauled in Tuel's
back-shoulder pass for a 3-yard
touchdown, despite being
interfered with. The score
capped an 11-play, 88-yard
drive that saw Tuel taking
whatever the Stanford second
ary was giving him by finding
his targets on short passes
beneath the coverage.
"We're no stranger to Jeff
Tuel," said Ben Gardner, who
recorded 2.5 tackles for loss
and 1.5 sacks. "We've seen him
the past two years and he
always seems to play well
against us. That guy battles.
He took some hits tonight and
he got back up and kept fight
ing. He's a heck of a quarter
back. He's a warrior."

The Cardinal struck right
back on its next drive to retake
the lead as Nunes connected
with a wide-open Jamal-
Rashad Patterson for a 70-
yard touchdown. Nunes was

averaging less than a yard per
pass attempt before the touch
down throw, which also ended
up accounting for over half of
his total passing production.
"I thought there were a
couple times [Nunes] made
good plays," commented Shaw
"We still got our hands on a
couple balls we should've
caught, but he missed a couple
throws we need to make."

In closing out the first half,
Tuel took advantage of the
Cardinal's soft coverage and
engineered a field-goal-scor
ing drive to tie the game at 10
apiece. The Cougar quarter
back converted a critical
fourth-and-6 at the Stanford
40 before driving all the way
down to the 6-yard line, where
Andrew Furney hit a 24-yard
field goal as time expired.
The Cardinal's first posses
sion of the third quarter
proved to be its best drive of
the game, a 13-play, 78-yard
touchdown-scoring chive that
took almost seven minutes
a vast improvement for
Stanford after being out-pos
sessed by over 12 minutes in
the first half. Recording his
first touchdown of the season
and the first rushing touch
down of his career, fullback
Ryan Hewitt punched it in on
third-and-goal from the
Cougars' 1-yard line to give the
Cardinal a 17-10 lead.

After stifling Washington
State's offense for the entire
third quarter, it seemed as if
Stanford had finally put the
pesky Cougars away for good
when free safety Ed Reynolds
intercepted Thel in the fourth
quarter and took it to the
house for a 25-yard touch
down. It was Reynolds' fourth
interception and second pick

six of the season, and the soph
omore standout is now second
in the nation in interception
yardage.
"I just read the call that
allowed me to cheat over
there," said Reynolds. "The
quarterback just stared a little
bit and had been playing most
ly to that side all game, the free
man side. I went, stole second
and got one. For myself, it's
just keep going out and work
ing on the little things to help
this team get better."
But the two-touchdown
deficit did little to faze
Washington State.
Ihel rattled off eight com
pletions on the ensuing drive to
put seven points on the board
in a hurry, with Kristoff
Williams' 10-yard touchdown
reception sealing the deal.
Stanford proceeded to run
down the clock as much as pos
sible on its next possession.
Nunes found Whitfield for a
critical third-down conversion,
but the Cougars' defense
locked down and forced the
drive to stall near midfield.

"I'm not going to take any
thing away from those

[Washington State] guys," said
Shaw, "H'avis Long is proba
bly one of my favorite guys in
our conference that's not on
our team. That guy plays hard
... he beat us a few times
tonight."
Long's five tackles on the
day didn't do justice to the
impact he had on the game
he consistently disrupted plays
in the backfield and made crit
ical stops on Taylor in the
fourth quarter to give the
Cougars a fighting chance.
Washington State got the
ball back with 3:37 left in the
game, needing a touchdown
to send the game into over
time. Tuel methodically
dished the ball to four differ
ent receivers and miraculous
ly converted a fourth-and-21
to march the Cougars all the
way down to the Stanford 9-
yard line.
But a costly intentional
grounding penalty took 10
seconds off the clock and
moved Wazzu back 10 yards.
On second-and-goal at the
Stanford 19, Tuel dropped
back and scanned for an open
target in the end zone, but

was gobbled up by defensive
end Henry Anderson before
he could unload. With no
timeouts left, the Cougars
could only watch the clock run

bly one of my favorite guys in
our conference that's not on
our team. That guy plays hard
... he beat us a few times
tonight."
Long's five tackles on the
day didn't do justice to the
impact he had on the game
he consistently disrupted plays
in the backfield and made crit
ical stops on Taylor in the
fourth quarter to give the
Cougars a fighting chance.
Washington State got the
ball back with 3:37 left in the
game, needing a touchdown
to send the game into over
time. Tuel methodically
dished the ball to four differ
ent receivers and miraculous
ly converted a fourth-and-21
to march the Cougars all the
way down to the Stanford 9-
yard line.
But a costly intentional
grounding penalty took 10
seconds off the clock and
moved Wazzu back 10 yards.
On second-and-goal at the
Stanford 19, Tuel dropped
back and scanned for an open
target in the end zone, but

was gobbled up by defensive
end Henry Anderson before
he could unload. With no
timeouts left, the Cougars
could only watch the clock run
down to zero as their come
back fell short.

"It definitely wasn't the
kind of game we wanted to
play," said Nunes. "Coach
Shaw said it earlier: We can
definitely play better. The
defense did a lot of great things
all night. Offensively, we have
to get going, we have to be
more efficient get the
chains moving on third down
and get [the defense] a break."
With Oregon State falling
to Washington on Saturday
night, the Cardinal is currently
tied with the Beavers for sec
ond place in the Pac-12 North
standings and controls its own
postseason destiny
Up next for Stanford is a
road trip to Boulder, where the
Cardinal hopes to take care of
business against Colorado
before its showdown with
Oregon State in two weeks.

That's why on Saturday after
noon the second-worst defense in
the conference found away to limit
a Doak Walker Award candidate
to 58 yards on the ground. That's
why on Saturday afternoon a pass
defense that gives up over 287
yards through the air each game
managed to hold a quarterback to
136 passing yards. It's why on
Saturday afternoon the outcome
of the game was much closer than
many predicted.
A win is a win, but it certainly
was not the way head coach David
Shaw drew it up.
A 24-point favorite going in to
the game, No. 14 Stanford (6-2,4-
1 Pac-12) escaped with an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory over a scrap
py Washington State (2-6, 0-5)
team that refused to quit.
"We played to about 70-75 per
cent of our capabilities," said Shaw.
"We did not play as well as we
practiced. We played hard, but the

execution was lacking."
The Stanford defense broke a
school record by sacking Cougars
quarterback Jeff Tuel 10 times but
also allowed the senior to complete
over 71 percent of his passes for
401 yards. One-upping its domi
nant shutdown of Cal a week ago,
the Cardinal run defense also held
Washington State to -16 yards on
the ground, a statistic made less
impressive only by the fact that
the Cougars rushing attack is cur
rently ranked dead last in the
nation.
However, finding bright spots
in the Cardinal offense's perform
ance is a different story, as
Washington State outgained
Stanford 385 yards to 256.
Quarterback Josh Nunes had one
of his worst outings at home,
underthrowing and overthrowing
open receivers on numerous occa
sions to finish the game with 7-of
-15 passing for only 136 yards and a
touchdown.

"We had a good practice,"
Nunes commented. "It just didn't
show up out there in the game.
They did some good things, but I
feel like we shot ourselves in the
foot a decent amount, too. We
know that we can get more pro
duction out there and that there
were some plays that we left out

Games are always played out
differently on the field than they
are on paper.

10/27, Stanford Stadium


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Free safety Ed Reynolds (29) intercepted Wazzu's Jeff Tuel for a pick-six to give the Cardinal a 14-point lead in
the early minutes of the fourth quarter. The junior is ranked second in the nation in interception yardage.
there."
Dating the redshirt junior
to throw all afternoon, the
Cougars' defense effectively
loaded the box and limited
Stanford's ground game to 120
yards. On some run plays, sen
ior halfback Stepfan Taylor
had to do all he could just to
get back to the line of scrim
mage.
"Stepfan got the ball at
least five times off the top of
my head and as soon as he
touched the ball there was a
guy in the backfield," said
Shaw. 'A guy that should've
been accounted for ...For
Stepfan to have 20 carries and
the limited yards that he had,
that's not up to our standard.
We can do so much better and
we didn't."
Stanford's opening drive
didn't exactly foreshadow the
offensive struggles it would
have later in the game. True
freshman wide receiver Kodi
Whitfield made his first career
catch to pick up a first down,
and a 17-yard dash by the
speedy Anthony Wilkerson
two plays later allowed Jordan
Williamson to nail a 48-yard
field goal. Just like that, the
Cardinal was up 3-0.
"It was great finally having
the hard work pay off," said
Whitfield. "The coaches put in
a plan for me and got me an
early touch. It just feels good
to finally transfer practice into
the game."

Wazzu had trouble main
taining its drives in the early
going. Though Thel managed

to convert a few third downs
with accurate passes to wide
outs Gabe Marks and Gino
Simone, the Cougars failed to
cross its own 40-yard line on all
three of its possessions in the
first quarter. It also didn't help
that the Stanford front seven
was manhandling Washington
State's offensive line and
bringing the heat on Thel, who
was sacked five times by four
different Cardinal defenders in
the first quarter alone.
But it was only a matter of
time before Mike Leach's air
raid would inflict some dam
age.

After an inconsequential
Stanford possession, the
Cougars took a 7-3 lead in the
early minutes of the second
quarter when Dominique
Williams, who finished with a
game-high nine receptions for
100 yards, hauled in Tuel's
back-shoulder pass for a 3-yard
touchdown, despite being
interfered with. The score
capped an 11-play, 88-yard
drive that saw Tuel taking
whatever the Stanford second
ary was giving him by finding
his targets on short passes
beneath the coverage.
"We're no stranger to Jeff
Tuel," said Ben Gardner, who
recorded 2.5 tackles for loss
and 1.5 sacks. "We've seen him
the past two years and he
always seems to play well
against us. That guy battles.
He took some hits tonight and
he got back up and kept fight
ing. He's a heck of a quarter
back. He's a warrior."

The Cardinal struck right
back on its next drive to retake
the lead as Nunes connected
with a wide-open Jamal-
Rashad Patterson for a 70-
yard touchdown. Nunes was

averaging less than a yard per
pass attempt before the touch
down throw, which also ended
up accounting for over half of
his total passing production.
"I thought there were a
couple times [Nunes] made
good plays," commented Shaw
"We still got our hands on a
couple balls we should've
caught, but he missed a couple
throws we need to make."

In closing out the first half,
Tuel took advantage of the
Cardinal's soft coverage and
engineered a field-goal-scor
ing drive to tie the game at 10
apiece. The Cougar quarter
back converted a critical
fourth-and-6 at the Stanford
40 before driving all the way
down to the 6-yard line, where
Andrew Furney hit a 24-yard
field goal as time expired.
The Cardinal's first posses
sion of the third quarter
proved to be its best drive of
the game, a 13-play, 78-yard
touchdown-scoring chive that
took almost seven minutes
a vast improvement for
Stanford after being out-pos
sessed by over 12 minutes in
the first half. Recording his
first touchdown of the season
and the first rushing touch
down of his career, fullback
Ryan Hewitt punched it in on
third-and-goal from the
Cougars' 1-yard line to give the
Cardinal a 17-10 lead.

After stifling Washington
State's offense for the entire
third quarter, it seemed as if
Stanford had finally put the
pesky Cougars away for good
when free safety Ed Reynolds
intercepted Thel in the fourth
quarter and took it to the
house for a 25-yard touch
down. It was Reynolds' fourth
interception and second pick

six of the season, and the soph
omore standout is now second
in the nation in interception
yardage.
"I just read the call that
allowed me to cheat over
there," said Reynolds. "The
quarterback just stared a little
bit and had been playing most
ly to that side all game, the free
man side. I went, stole second
and got one. For myself, it's
just keep going out and work
ing on the little things to help
this team get better."
But the two-touchdown
deficit did little to faze
Washington State.
Ihel rattled off eight com
pletions on the ensuing drive to
put seven points on the board
in a hurry, with Kristoff
Williams' 10-yard touchdown
reception sealing the deal.
Stanford proceeded to run
down the clock as much as pos
sible on its next possession.
Nunes found Whitfield for a
critical third-down conversion,
but the Cougars' defense
locked down and forced the
drive to stall near midfield.

"I'm not going to take any
thing away from those

[Washington State] guys," said
Shaw, "H'avis Long is proba
bly one of my favorite guys in
our conference that's not on
our team. That guy plays hard
... he beat us a few times
tonight."
