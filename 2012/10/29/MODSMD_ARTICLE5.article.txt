# CRISIS AVERTED
## NO. 14 STANFORD HOLDS OFF LATE WAZZU RALLY 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
That's why on Saturday after
noon the second-worst defense in
the conference found away to limit
a Doak Walker Award candidate
to 58 yards on the ground. That's
why on Saturday afternoon a pass
defense that gives up over 287
yards through the air each game
managed to hold a quarterback to
136 passing yards. It's why on
Saturday afternoon the outcome
of the game was much closer than
many predicted.
A win is a win, but it certainly
was not the way head coach David
Shaw drew it up.
A 24-point favorite going in to
the game, No. 14 Stanford (6-2,4-
1 Pac-12) escaped with an uncon
vincing 24-17 victory over a scrap
py Washington State (2-6, 0-5)
team that refused to quit.
"We played to about 70-75 per
cent of our capabilities," said Shaw.
"We did not play as well as we
practiced. We played hard, but the

execution was lacking."
The Stanford defense broke a
school record by sacking Cougars
quarterback Jeff Tuel 10 times but
also allowed the senior to complete
over 71 percent of his passes for
401 yards. One-upping its domi
nant shutdown of Cal a week ago,
the Cardinal run defense also held
Washington State to -16 yards on
the ground, a statistic made less
impressive only by the fact that
the Cougars rushing attack is cur
rently ranked dead last in the
nation.
However, finding bright spots
in the Cardinal offense's perform
ance is a different story, as
Washington State outgained
Stanford 385 yards to 256.
Quarterback Josh Nunes had one
of his worst outings at home,
underthrowing and overthrowing
open receivers on numerous occa
sions to finish the game with 7-of
-15 passing for only 136 yards and a
touchdown.

"We had a good practice,"
Nunes commented. "It just didn't
show up out there in the game.
They did some good things, but I
feel like we shot ourselves in the
foot a decent amount, too. We
know that we can get more pro
duction out there and that there
were some plays that we left out

Games are always played out
differently on the field than they
are on paper.

the early minutes of the fourth quarter. The junior is ranked second in the nation in interception yardage.
