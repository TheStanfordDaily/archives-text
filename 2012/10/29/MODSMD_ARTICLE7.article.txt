# OPINIONS
## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE Nosce te ipsum 
### Chris Herries 
In high school I had a serious
problem with exaggeration.
Since I was always a bit awk
ward, I would often try to impress
people by seeming cooler, sterner or
smarter than I actually am. I twist
ed and turned my actual interests to
project an image I wanted other
people to accept. Frankly, I did not
believe my actual self to be accept
able.
I was aided in the transition to
college by a gap year where I
worked abroad. I was able to work,
roam around and get a better image
of my "self" —whatever that is. So
after coming to college I was no
longer afraid to say and be who I
was, or what I was feeling.
Two things struck me immedi
ately. The first was that my notions
in high school were right I made
far fewer friends by being myself. A
good friend of mine quipped that I
am the only person who can win a
Nobel Prize and be convicted of a
crime on the same day. A former
dormmate, upon seeing me last
month, remarked that I look like
less of an asshole this year, and so I
must be hiding it well. Those are
probably pretty accurate depic
tions.
However, the second thing that
struck me was how little I cared
about the first. I no longer wanted to
make friends by being someone else.
It's true: I'm probably not the best
person to sit down and eat lunch
with. Yet I would rather eat lunch
alone than show up and make
friends by pretending to be some
one I am not.

It reminds me of my confirma
tion. I was confirmed in the
Lutheran church, much to my cha
grin. Not that there is anything
wrong with the Lutherans it's
just that I did not feel anything for
the religion. Why should I go
through an elaborate ceremony
lying to myself and the congrega
tion? I remember crying that night
because I should have felt some
thing and did not. I knelt next to an
altar and lied to God himself

because it was something other peo
ple wanted to see. That is how I feel
when I fake a personality, so I have
made it my mission to stop.
You may now be wondering how
my stories are applicable to life at
Stanford. We all know what a fake
personality is because we have all
been fake at some point. During
sorority rush, I am sure you feigned
interest in plenty of things. I hope
what you did as a fraternity pledge
was against your will. Have you
ever met someone and felt like they
just handed you a beefed up
resume? Have you ever been the
one shilling out said resume? And,
of course, Stanford's most common
lie: "Your student group is my top
priority!"
It could be a symptom of today's
society or our hectic lives or some
other fond scapegoat we blame to
compensate for our shortcomings.
Either way, it's harmful. If you want
real interactions then you have to
be your real self.
On my end, I am done with the
soothing balm of fakeness. People
will come and go out of your life;
only you will remain constant. Be
able to look at yourself in the mirror
and accept your daily decisions.
Your acceptance is more important
than their acceptance.
Moreover, if you ever meet me,
know that if you come as yourself I
will accept you. Straight, gay, trans,
queer, black, white, Latino, political,
apathetic, athletic, lethargic, jock,
nerd, bro, boss, prude, slut, rich,
poor, techie, fuzzy, busy, bored,
happy sad or undecided I will lis
ten to anybody who comes to me as
their whole self, ashamed or proud.
My late grandmother once told
me that there is good in my heart,
and I should bring it with me wher
ever I go. She was wrong in number,
not sentiment. We all have good in
our hearts, and we all should bring
it with us. Get better every day

Moreover, if you ever meet me,
know that if you come as yourself I
will accept you. Straight, gay, trans,
queer, black, white, Latino, political,
apathetic, athletic, lethargic, jock,
nerd, bro, boss, prude, slut, rich,
poor, techie, fuzzy, busy, bored,
happy sad or undecided I will lis
ten to anybody who comes to me as
their whole self, ashamed or proud.
My late grandmother once told
me that there is good in my heart,
and I should bring it with me wher
ever I go. She was wrong in number,
not sentiment. We all have good in
our hearts, and we all should bring
it with us. Get better every day
Nosce te ipsum know thyself.
