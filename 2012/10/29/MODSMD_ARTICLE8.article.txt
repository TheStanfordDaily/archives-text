## Profs spar over alleged academic harassment 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A contentious national debate
about the future of mathematics
education recently became personal
at Stanford, as Jo Boaler, a School of
Education professor, took to the
Internet to call out "harassment
and persecution" by two mathemat
ics scholars, one a Stanford faculty
member emeritus.

In her post, Boaler whose
research into reforming mathemat
ics education has won awards and
received extensive funding in both
the United Kingdom and the United
States wrote that critiques of her
work by James Milgram, professor
emeritus of math, and Wayne
Bishop, professor of mathematics at
California State University, Los
Angeles, have moved beyond aca
demic disputes and into the realm of
personal and unethical attacks.

"Honest academic debate lies at
the core of good scholarship,"
Boaler wrote, identifying a trail of
grievances going back to 1999.
"Milgram and Bishop have gone
beyond the bounds of reasoned dis
course in a campaign to systemati
cally suppress empirical evidence
that contradicts their stance."

Boaler's principal grievance lies
with an essay co-authored by
Milgram and Bishop, which claims
to disprove findings from Boaler's
research indicating a significant
benefit to students who receive
math education based on collabora
tive work and real-world examples.
Boaler's research suggests her
methods are effective both general
ly and in terms of engaging demo
graphic groups who statistically
struggle in math.
"Students who engage more
actively with math do better,"
Boaler said. "They achieve at high
er levels, they were more positive
about math, they were able to use it
better. ...We have a decade of
research showing that's what's best
for kids."

Boaler also expressed concern
that attempts to identify the schools
used in the study in question runs
afoul of federal regulations protect
ing the anonymity of minor
research subjects, and noted that
Milgram and Bishop's paper has yet

to be peer-reviewed or published.
According to Milgram, the paper
was accepted for publication in an
education journal, but Boaler's 2006
departure from Stanford she
returned in 2010 removed the
need to provoke further controver
sy-
"Many people in the education
world pressured me not to actually
complete the publishing process,"
Milgram said in a statement to The
Daily. "They argued that since
Boaler had left Stanford, we had de
facto 'won.'"
While a 2006 University investi
gation into allegations of scientific
misconduct against Boaler was ter
minated after finding no wrongdo
ing, Milgram and Bishop's paper, "A
Close Examination of Jo Boaler's
Railside Report," remains available
on a Stanford website.
"I'm curious about that," Boaler
said about the paper's continued
availability.
Milgram, meanwhile, has sus
tained his objections to Boaler's
work and denied any type of aca
demic bullying, acknowledging the
unsatisfactory current state of math
education but arguing for an
increased emphasis on educating
teachers rather than the student
focused solution Boaler has advo
cated.
"Those of us who actually know
the subject strongly believe that in
order to improve outcomes we have
to dramatically increase teacher
knowledge of the subject, and that
teachers need to more or less
directly impart that knowledge to
students," Milgram wrote.
Boaler framed the decision to
publish her grievances online as a
means of offering supporters access
to it as a resource, considering the
extensive use of Milgram and
Bishop's paper in online forums as a
means of discrediting her research.
"I took advice to just ignore it,
but that was the wrong advice,"
Boaler acknowledged, arguing that
a more strident advocacy of math
education reform is necessary
"There's a huge gap between
what we know from research and
what happens in most math class
rooms," she added.
