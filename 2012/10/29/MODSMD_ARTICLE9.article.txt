# Do You MIND?
## Queer yo' mind, yo! 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
Being queer-identified is not
the same thing as being
queer-minded.
While I've had variations of this
thought since I first encountered the
term "queer" two years ago in the
LGBT-CRC's weekly lunch series
for freshmen, I was unable to articu
late this idea so clearly until last
Friday at San Francisco State
University.
I'd gone to San Francisco State
for the 2012 "Queer Yo' Mind" con
ference, which I attended with a del
egation of Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation (SSQL).
The conference "works to use
Queer as a tool to empower and unite
people from all backgrounds to cri
tique and 'dismantle' the dominant
LGBTQ politics and realize the radical
potential of queer community and
queer scholarship," according to its
website.
I'd come to know the term
"queer" as a noun and a verb. As a
noun, it encompasses people with
various gender and sexual identities
in an inclusive and uniting way that
the term "LGBT" does not; as a
verb, it represents creating active
challenge resistance to multiple sys
tems of oppression that affect queer
people: class inequality, racism, col
orism, sexism and national identity,
to name a few.
Taking the noun and verb impli
cations of queer together, I thought
to be queer meant to step outside of
the dominant frameworks of society
that privilege white, straight, cis
gendered and financially stable men
among all other groups.
But as I've written about multi
ple times this volume, my own and
others' experiences of interacting
within Stanford's queer community
have not necessarily meshed with
my conception of queer.
I first articulated the argument
that frames this column over lunch
with a SSQL friend. I'd mentioned a
difference between having a queer
gender or sexual identity and enact
ing the principles queer politics aim
to follow.

"You're talking about being
queer-minded and not just queer
identified" my friend said.
And that's when the idea crystal
lized.

Using the term queer alone to
refer to queer-identified communi
ties on our campus and in the larger
world, I'd experienced a disconnect
in realizing that these spaces were
not necessarily queer-minded.
So my biggest question now is
this: How can our queer-identified
communities work to align more
closely with queer-minded politics?
Even though I'm black and
queer in a country where being in
those minority groups may bring me
harm, I still am a man in a world
where power and privilege favor my
gender identity. It is therefore easy
for me to ignore the particular con
cerns of women or transgender peo
ple by saying, "I feel generally safe
and comfortable in spite of my
minority statuses, therefore even
with exceptions the world is a
safe and comfortable place for
everyone."
In the same way, I imagine, a stu
dent who is queer-identified and
white —or from a comfortable
socioeconomic background irrespec
tive of race may have difficulty
acknowledging the concerns and
specific issues that queer people of
color and/or queer people with limit
ed resources face.
Difficulty empathizing or com
fort with one's own situation should
not preclude actively fighting for
the inclusion of groups that do
experience discomfort, though.
This is especially true for anyone
who identifies as queer, because in
different contexts or times, we can
very easily experience harm or dis
comfort. "Queer" politics are ones
that everyone regardless of gen
der or sexual identity should
seek to follow.

Trying to forge my own role in
fostering the synthesis of our queer
identified communities with queer
minded politics, I embark on offer
ing a three-part series, "Beyond the

Rainbow: Exploring Race in the
Queer-Identified Community."
This Thursday, I will present a
series of articles, student experi
ences and my own reflections on
being black in the gay (male) com
munity as part of the Ujamaa
Scholars residential education pro
gram.

The following day, I will co-lead a
moderated student panel on larger
issues of race (and gender and class)
in Stanford's queer-identified com
munity at Terra House. We plan to
crowdsource the questions that
shape the discussion, by circulating
an anonymous Google form before
the event and asking people to sug
gest topics/questions and to share
experiences (difficult or redemptive)
they've had as minorities or allies
within the queer community.
Finally, next Sunday, we'll wrap
up the series with a conversation at
the LGBT-CRC on how to action
ably address making our queer
identified spaces and communities
safer, more comfortable and more
inclusive for minorities of all kinds.
So far, SSQL and Queer and
Asian at Stanford have agreed to co
sponsor this series, and the LGBT
CRC is providing support. As I
await response from other queer
voluntary student organizations
(VSOs) and ethnic VSOs, I hope to
build as wide a coalition of voices
represented and attendees as possi
ble.
The most important part of this
series is making these discussions
ones of collective inquiry —of
responding to topics and issues our
community has experienced in the
aggregate more than to particular
instances of alienation.
Let's queer our minds, yo!

The following day, I will co-lead a
moderated student panel on larger
issues of race (and gender and class)
in Stanford's queer-identified com
munity at Terra House. We plan to
crowdsource the questions that
shape the discussion, by circulating
an anonymous Google form before
the event and asking people to sug
gest topics/questions and to share
experiences (difficult or redemptive)
they've had as minorities or allies
within the queer community.
Finally, next Sunday, we'll wrap
up the series with a conversation at
the LGBT-CRC on how to action
ably address making our queer
identified spaces and communities
safer, more comfortable and more
inclusive for minorities of all kinds.
So far, SSQL and Queer and
Asian at Stanford have agreed to co
sponsor this series, and the LGBT
CRC is providing support. As I
await response from other queer
voluntary student organizations
(VSOs) and ethnic VSOs, I hope to
build as wide a coalition of voices
represented and attendees as possi
ble.
The most important part of this
series is making these discussions
ones of collective inquiry —of
responding to topics and issues our
community has experienced in the
aggregate more than to particular
instances of alienation.
Let's queer our minds, yo!

Being queer-identified is not
the same thing as being
queer-minded.
While I've had variations of this
thought since I first encountered the
term "queer" two years ago in the
LGBT-CRC's weekly lunch series
for freshmen, I was unable to articu
late this idea so clearly until last
Friday at San Francisco State
University.
I'd gone to San Francisco State
for the 2012 "Queer Yo' Mind" con
ference, which I attended with a del
egation of Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation (SSQL).
The conference "works to use
Queer as a tool to empower and unite
people from all backgrounds to cri
tique and 'dismantle' the dominant
LGBTQ politics and realize the radical
potential of queer community and
queer scholarship," according to its
website.
I'd come to know the term
"queer" as a noun and a verb. As a
noun, it encompasses people with
various gender and sexual identities
in an inclusive and uniting way that
the term "LGBT" does not; as a
verb, it represents creating active
challenge resistance to multiple sys
tems of oppression that affect queer
people: class inequality, racism, col
orism, sexism and national identity,
to name a few.
Taking the noun and verb impli
cations of queer together, I thought
to be queer meant to step outside of
the dominant frameworks of society
that privilege white, straight, cis
gendered and financially stable men
among all other groups.
But as I've written about multi
ple times this volume, my own and
others' experiences of interacting
within Stanford's queer community
have not necessarily meshed with
my conception of queer.
I first articulated the argument
that frames this column over lunch
with a SSQL friend. I'd mentioned a
difference between having a queer
gender or sexual identity and enact
ing the principles queer politics aim
to follow.

"You're talking about being
queer-minded and not just queer
identified" my friend said.
And that's when the idea crystal
lized.

Using the term queer alone to
refer to queer-identified communi
ties on our campus and in the larger
world, I'd experienced a disconnect
in realizing that these spaces were
not necessarily queer-minded.
So my biggest question now is
this: How can our queer-identified
communities work to align more
closely with queer-minded politics?
Even though I'm black and
queer in a country where being in
those minority groups may bring me
harm, I still am a man in a world
where power and privilege favor my
gender identity. It is therefore easy
for me to ignore the particular con
cerns of women or transgender peo
ple by saying, "I feel generally safe
and comfortable in spite of my
minority statuses, therefore even
with exceptions the world is a
safe and comfortable place for
everyone."
In the same way, I imagine, a stu
dent who is queer-identified and
white —or from a comfortable
socioeconomic background irrespec
tive of race may have difficulty
acknowledging the concerns and
specific issues that queer people of
color and/or queer people with limit
ed resources face.
Difficulty empathizing or com
fort with one's own situation should
not preclude actively fighting for
the inclusion of groups that do
experience discomfort, though.
This is especially true for anyone
who identifies as queer, because in
different contexts or times, we can
very easily experience harm or dis
comfort. "Queer" politics are ones
that everyone regardless of gen
der or sexual identity should
seek to follow.

Trying to forge my own role in
fostering the synthesis of our queer
identified communities with queer
minded politics, I embark on offer
ing a three-part series, "Beyond the

Rainbow: Exploring Race in the
Queer-Identified Community."
This Thursday, I will present a
series of articles, student experi
ences and my own reflections on
being black in the gay (male) com
munity as part of the Ujamaa
Scholars residential education pro
gram.
