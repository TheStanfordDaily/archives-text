# CARD IS CLUTCH
## STANFORD UPSETS GAUCHOS 
### ANNA BLUE 
The Stanford men's soccer
team has proven that when push
comes to shove, it can get things
done. Faced with the despairing
reality that a loss to UC-Santa
Barbara would mean the end to
their hopes for a postseason run in
the NCAA tournament, the
Cardinal fought until an overtime
golden goal from senior Adam
Jahn in the 96th minute proved the
final source of salvation for a team
in need of a win.

The 1-0 win against the
Gauchos — at one time the No. 3
team in the country — is the sec
ond time that Stanford has
knocked off a ranked team on the
road this year after defeating then-
No. 11 UC-Irvine on the road in
the preseason. The overtime win
devastated the UCSB team on
their senior night, making up for
Stanford's loss to Washington on
their own senior night.
"At that point, things weren't
looking too good; we were out of
the Pac-12 running, but we just had
to stay confident," Jahn said about
the team's mental state after the
loss to Washington.
Jahn is one of four seniors on
the team, commended by head
coach Jeremy Gunn for being a
tremendous group that "set a great
standard for the team [during the
game]."
Within the first five minutes
of the game, the Cardinal threat
ened the Gauchos with two cor
ner kicks, neither of which yield
ed an early goal. Three early
shots by the Stanford men that
missed just wide were additional
evidence of the determination of
the team as the Cardinal tried to
take advantage of the slow
UCSB start. The Gauchos chose
not to field their starting goal
keeper, Austin Mansker, in favor
of their No. 2 keeper Andre

Grandt, a factor that noticeably
unsettled the UCSB team's usual
confidence.

As the game continued, howev
er, UCSB fell into rhythm, spread

ing the field with their strategic
long passes. The UCSB team dom
inated in terms of possession, frus-

trating the Cardinal defenders,
who, nevertheless, managed to

maintain their cool patience.
According to Jahn, the boys had
previously struggled in the shift
from defense to offense.
But against the Gauchos, the
Stanford defenders showed consid
erable restraint that made the
transition after winning the ball
from UCSB players smooth and
effective. The contribution of
Stanford goalkeeper Drew Hutchins,
who racked up his fifth clean sheet
of the season, was immeasurable.
In the 35th minute, off a corner
kick from freshman Aaron Kovar,
junior midfield J.J. Koval managed
to head the ball on frame, but was
not able to convert as the ball
sailed over the crossbar.
Although Stanford matched
UCSB nine for nine in the shot
count in the first half, UCSB out
shot the Cardinal 7-3 in the second
half, four of the shots coming from
leading UCSB senior Peter
McGlynn. (In the Gauchos loss on
Sunday night, McGlynn was
reportedly arrested on the field for
assaulting an official after drawing
a red card in overtime.)
The best chance for UCSB
came with less than 30 seconds left
in regulation time, when player
Dion Acoff beat several Stanford
defenders to cut toward the box
and fired a shot. The shot by Acoff
was heart-stopping, but the save
by Hutchins as he deftly deflected
the ball wide was even more so.
In Stanford's first chance in
overtime, sophomore Jimmy
Callinan skillfully found Adam
Jahn at the far post with his cross,
leading to the game-winning goal.
Jahn remarked, "Throughout the
game, we just kept knocking on the
door, and it finally came through."
Amid the ecstasy and excite
ment the players felt as Jahn's
header cross the goal line, there
were definite feelings of relief as
well. The win brings the Cardinal
back to an even record, now at 7-7-
1, but it also boosts the team before
their final three games of the regu
lar season.
This Thursday the team travels
to Los Angeles to face UCLA, a
team that has won four NCAA
championships and is currently
ranked seventh in national rank
ings. The Stanford team has never
won at UCLA, so the boys have a
formidable challenge ahead of
them.

Jahn remarked, "Throughout the
game, we just kept knocking on the
door, and it finally came through."
Amid the ecstasy and excite
ment the players felt as Jahn's
header cross the goal line, there
were definite feelings of relief as
well. The win brings the Cardinal
back to an even record, now at 7-7-
1, but it also boosts the team before
their final three games of the regu
lar season.
This Thursday the team travels
to Los Angeles to face UCLA, a
team that has won four NCAA
championships and is currently
ranked seventh in national rank
ings. The Stanford team has never
won at UCLA, so the boys have a
formidable challenge ahead of
them.

Senior Adam Jahn (12) came through in the clutch with the game-winning goal as Stanford knocked off UC-Santa Barbara in overtime
on Friday night and kept the Cardinal's postseason hopes alive.
The Stanford men's soccer
team has proven that when push
comes to shove, it can get things
done. Faced with the despairing
reality that a loss to UC-Santa
Barbara would mean the end to
their hopes for a postseason run in
the NCAA tournament, the
Cardinal fought until an overtime
golden goal from senior Adam
Jahn in the 96th minute proved the
final source of salvation for a team
in need of a win.

The 1-0 win against the
Gauchos — at one time the No. 3
team in the country — is the sec
ond time that Stanford has
knocked off a ranked team on the
road this year after defeating then-
No. 11 UC-Irvine on the road in
the preseason. The overtime win
devastated the UCSB team on
their senior night, making up for
Stanford's loss to Washington on
their own senior night.
"At that point, things weren't
looking too good; we were out of
the Pac-12 running, but we just had
to stay confident," Jahn said about
the team's mental state after the
loss to Washington.
Jahn is one of four seniors on
the team, commended by head
coach Jeremy Gunn for being a
tremendous group that "set a great
standard for the team [during the
game]."
Within the first five minutes
of the game, the Cardinal threat
ened the Gauchos with two cor
ner kicks, neither of which yield
ed an early goal. Three early
shots by the Stanford men that
missed just wide were additional
evidence of the determination of
the team as the Cardinal tried to
take advantage of the slow
UCSB start. The Gauchos chose
not to field their starting goal
keeper, Austin Mansker, in favor
of their No. 2 keeper Andre

Grandt, a factor that noticeably
unsettled the UCSB team's usual
confidence.

As the game continued, howev
er, UCSB fell into rhythm, spread

ing the field with their strategic
long passes. The UCSB team dom
inated in terms of possession, frus-

trating the Cardinal defenders,
who, nevertheless, managed to

maintain their cool patience.
According to Jahn, the boys had
previously struggled in the shift
from defense to offense.
But against the Gauchos, the
Stanford defenders showed consid
erable restraint that made the
transition after winning the ball
from UCSB players smooth and
effective. The contribution of
Stanford goalkeeper Drew Hutchins,
who racked up his fifth clean sheet
of the season, was immeasurable.
In the 35th minute, off a corner
kick from freshman Aaron Kovar,
junior midfield J.J. Koval managed
to head the ball on frame, but was
not able to convert as the ball
sailed over the crossbar.
Although Stanford matched
UCSB nine for nine in the shot
count in the first half, UCSB out
shot the Cardinal 7-3 in the second
half, four of the shots coming from
leading UCSB senior Peter
McGlynn. (In the Gauchos loss on
Sunday night, McGlynn was
reportedly arrested on the field for
assaulting an official after drawing
a red card in overtime.)
The best chance for UCSB
came with less than 30 seconds left
in regulation time, when player
Dion Acoff beat several Stanford
defenders to cut toward the box
and fired a shot. The shot by Acoff
was heart-stopping, but the save
by Hutchins as he deftly deflected
the ball wide was even more so.
In Stanford's first chance in
overtime, sophomore Jimmy
Callinan skillfully found Adam
Jahn at the far post with his cross,
leading to the game-winning goal.
Jahn remarked, "Throughout the
game, we just kept knocking on the
door, and it finally came through."
Amid the ecstasy and excite
ment the players felt as Jahn's
header cross the goal line, there
were definite feelings of relief as
well. The win brings the Cardinal
back to an even record, now at 7-7-
1, but it also boosts the team before
their final three games of the regu
lar season.
