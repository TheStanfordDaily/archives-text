# Offense powers MPSF sweep

Saturday's result: Stanford
men's water polo 15, UC-Irvine 4,
freshman driver Brett Bonanni 8.
Sunday's result: Stanford 12, Long
Beach State 11, sophomore utility
Alex Bowen 6.

Bonanni and Bowen willed the
Cardinal (12-4, 4-2 MPSF) to two
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) wins this weekend,
accounting for 20 of the team's 27
goals. No other Stanford player
scored more than one goal in either
game, but the dynamic duo made
sure that didn't matter on the final
score line.
Both Bowen and Bonanni are
among the top 10 in the MPSF in
goals per game Bowen was sev
enth before this weekend and
Bonanni was second. And while
Bonanni has scored 12 more goals
on the season than his teammate,
Bowen has had a knack for piling
on goals in the biggest games.
This weekend, for example,
Bonanni's huge scoring perform
ance helped Stanford run away

from a potentially tricky Irvine
team.

Bowen looks at that game as an
example of what the team needs to
do going forward.
"We came out there and just
crushed it from the very begin
ning," Bowen said. "I think we need
to play like that a little bit more and
make teams just give up."
Sunday's game against Long Beach
state followed a different script,
however, as Bowen proved yet
again that he can put up big num
bers even in a hard-fought, back
and-forth game.
He shied away from taking per
sonal credit after the six-goal game
though which was a personal
season high pointing out that his
teammates put him in the right
positions.
"I just had the hot hand today.
The guys really worked to get me
the ball, and I got set up really
well," Bowen said.

Bonanni was no slouch in
Saturday shoot-out with Long
Beach either, coming up with four
goals of his own. The two of them
can both be successful on any given
day because they realize their
opportunities come out of the
offense working well. Neither
pushes too hard or gets in the way

Sophomore Alex Bowen (above with ball) had the hot hand with
eight goals in Stanford's win over Long Beach State. Bowen and
freshman Bret Bonnani combined for 20 goals over the weekend.
of the other getting their
chances.

"Just whoever gets it in
the flow of the offense is
going to get the shots,"
Bowen said of their two-man
attack in the pool.
On Saturday, the
Cardinal broke open a 6-1
lead midway through the
second quarter, by which
time Bonanni already had a
hat trick. The rest of the
game turned into a scoring
showcase, as goal after goal
got past the Anteater starter
and then back-up goalies.
The array was highlighted
by a lob shot from Bonanni
that floated into the opposite
top right corner and left
Irvine's goalie, Michael
Bailey, in a dismayed stupor.

Stanford scored almost
as many times on Sunday as
it had against Irvine, but the
defense didn't hold up as
well. The score was tight
throughout, but Stanford

kept its cool and continued
to execute when it needed to,
at least on the offensive end.

"The score might not
reflect that, but I think we
had the game pretty much
under control," said Bowen.
The mood, if not the
score, certainly reflected a
safe victory. Long Beach
took an early lead, and had
the game tied at 7-7 in the
third quarter. Stanford then
took the lead for good on a
goal by Bowen, and immedi
ately answered every subse
quent Long Beach goal with
one of their own.
The wins move Stanford
into third place in the MPSF,

behind USC and UCLA.
Neither of those top two
teams has lost a conference
game a fact Stanford has
a chance to change when
they visit the Bruins in two
weeks.

Before that, the Cardinal
has to take care of business
on the road against UC-
Davis and Santa Clara
neither of which are in the
MPSF. The game at Davis
will start at noon on
Saturday, and the game at
Santa Clara is scheduled for
noon on Sunday.
