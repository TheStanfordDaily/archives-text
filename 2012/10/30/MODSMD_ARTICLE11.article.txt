# Offense powers MPSF sweep
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Saturday's result: Stanford
men's water polo 15, UC-Irvine 4,
freshman driver Brett Bonanni 8.
Sunday's result: Stanford 12, Long
Beach State 11, sophomore utility
Alex Bowen 6.

Bonanni and Bowen willed the
Cardinal (12-4, 4-2 MPSF) to two
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) wins this weekend,
accounting for 20 of the team's 27
goals. No other Stanford player
scored more than one goal in either
game, but the dynamic duo made
sure that didn't matter on the final
score line.
Both Bowen and Bonanni are
among the top 10 in the MPSF in
goals per game Bowen was sev
enth before this weekend and
Bonanni was second. And while
Bonanni has scored 12 more goals
on the season than his teammate,
Bowen has had a knack for piling
on goals in the biggest games.
This weekend, for example,
Bonanni's huge scoring perform
ance helped Stanford run away

from a potentially tricky Irvine
team.

Bowen looks at that game as an
example of what the team needs to
do going forward.
"We came out there and just
crushed it from the very begin
ning," Bowen said. "I think we need
to play like that a little bit more and
make teams just give up."
Sunday's game against Long Beach
state followed a different script,
however, as Bowen proved yet
again that he can put up big num
bers even in a hard-fought, back
and-forth game.
He shied away from taking per
sonal credit after the six-goal game
though which was a personal
season high pointing out that his
teammates put him in the right
positions.
"I just had the hot hand today.
The guys really worked to get me
the ball, and I got set up really
well," Bowen said.

Bonanni was no slouch in
Saturday shoot-out with Long
Beach either, coming up with four
goals of his own. The two of them
can both be successful on any given
day because they realize their
opportunities come out of the
offense working well. Neither
pushes too hard or gets in the way
