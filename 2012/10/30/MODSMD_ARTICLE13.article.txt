## 
### Sam Fisher 
Stanford baseball scrimmaged against the
University of San Francisco on Sunday at
Sunken Diamond, marking the Card's first action
against an opponent since the Super Regional
loss at Florida State in June.

Senior Mark Appel, who this summer decided
not to sign when drafted ninth by the Pittsburgh
Pirates, drew a modest crowd
of MLB scouts for his two
inning start. Appel touched
97 mph with his fastball, while
sitting 94 to 96.
But the highlight of the
day for Stanford and the fans
came from Austin Wilson.
The junior centerfielder, one

of the top sluggers returning
this season, hit a monster
home run to dead center field.
The ball was still flying fast
when it struck the "K" on the
"Klein Field" sign on top of
the batter's eye in dead cen
ter field. Amateur estimates
had the projected distance
around 450 feet or more.
Former Stanford catcher
Eric Smith, who signed with
the Dodgers this summer
after a successful junior sea
son as Stanford's starting

catcher, was on hand to watch
the team. Smith had a break
out year in his first season in
the minor leagues, hitting
.336 for the Ogden Raptors of
the Pioneer League.
Stanford takes on San
Jose State on Sunday in
another informal scrimmage.
The Spartans swept Stanford
in a home-and-home series in
