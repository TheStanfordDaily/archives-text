## Is week seven the worst? 
### Emil Cohodes 
In return for free housing in the
beautiful Rogers House, sum
mer live-in staffers at the
Bridge do their fair share of
answering calls in the middle of the
night and also complete a sum
mer project. Last summer, senior
Emma Pierson 'l2 spent her two
months at the Bridge producing an
in-depth statistical report on
Bridge counsels. She analyzed
what students seem to be most con
cerned about each week, what time
of day most of our calls come in and
the number of calls fielded by each
staff member. One of the most
interesting things to come out of
her incredible analysis was that
during week seven, the Bridge
receives 30 percent more calls than
during any other week.

Why might this be? Could it be that
week seven means more exams,
papers, and general stress than any
other week? Emma thought the
same thing and did a second analy
sis of when midterms of over twen
ty randomly selected popular
Stanford classes typically occur. It
turns out the peak of midterms
occurs during weeks five and six,
with the number of midterms
taken, on average, dropping signifi
cantly during week seven.
While the data is a bit noisy and
we can't be sure that this trend rep
resents all undergraduates accu
rately, my theory is that Stanford
students spend weeks five and six
of the quarter cramming so much
for midterms, studying so hard and
obsessing so much about exams
and papers, that they often let rela
tionships, anxiety levels, stress and
other "less important" issues fall by
the wayside in an attempt to just
push through two of the toughest
weeks on campus. Living, working
and playing on a campus defined by
its academic rigor, late nights at the
library and the epitome of a "work
hard, play hard" culture fosters a
community in which students seem
to prioritize the task at hand, read
ily concentrating on just academics,
or just friends and fun depending
on where we are in the quarter. We
all too often adopt the mentality
that we just have to "get through" a
hellish week or "survive" a few
more tests or midterms and then
all will be better.

The problem with this "work
hard, play hard" mentality that so
many of us subscribe to is that we
are more than just students. Even
during the toughest weeks of the
quarter, we are more than just
essay-writing, p-set-completing,
exam-cramming machines. We are
living, breathing, dynamic individu
als with emotions that need regu

lating, thoughts and words that
need to be listened to, and selves
that need earing for. It is typically
not until after the stormy condi
tions of weeks five and six pass,
that, Emma's analysis suggests,
students begin picking up the
pieces, dealing with personal issues
outside of the classroom and taking
proactive steps to make our person
al lives look as good as our midterm
scores.

There's also a more serious side
to this week seven spike. Not only
does the Bridge receive more calls
in general, but the number of calls
we get related to depression and
suicide are also higher in week
seven than any other week. Smaller
problems compound into bigger
ones, and after these tough weeks
of pushing everything aside for aca
demics, some students find them
selves at an all-time low.
It's no coincidence that I'm wilt
ing this column this week. It's
Tuesday of week six, which accord
ing to my theory, is one of those
brutish weeks that we all just want
to push through and "survive"
before landing on the other side in
a field of rainbows and sunflowers
(week seven). I beg you to look at
this differently. Rather than map
ping your personal life onto the
demands of the quarter, nurture
your whole self every week. Now
I'm not suggesting that we should
all take hour-long meditation
breaks at 10 p.m. instead of writing
the research paper that's due the
next day, but there might be ways
to find more balance in our lives
and adopt more of a "be well" atti
tude.

Make time for exercise, even if it
means cramming for that midterm
for half an hour less. Stop and take
time to eat real meals in the compa
ny of others rather than grabbing a
few goldfish out of the open kitchen.
Take time to breathe and feel grate
ful for your surroundings on the
way to class; take a minute to call
home. Take care of yourself now
and try to dedicate time to both
your studies and your relationships,
both your problem sets and the sets
of problems that arise in the per
sonal, non-academic life of any
Stanford student. Because if you
push these concerns away now and
just power through without taking
time for yourself, chances are those
issues that you push aside won't be
any easier to handle next week.

Have other thoughts about why stu
dents seem to be more stressed out
week seven than any other week?

other "less important" issues fall by
the wayside in an attempt to just
push through two of the toughest
weeks on campus. Living, working
and playing on a campus defined by
its academic rigor, late nights at the
library and the epitome of a "work
hard, play hard" culture fosters a
community in which students seem
to prioritize the task at hand, read
ily concentrating on just academics,
or just friends and fun depending
on where we are in the quarter. We
all too often adopt the mentality
that we just have to "get through" a
hellish week or "survive" a few
more tests or midterms and then
all will be better.

The problem with this "work
hard, play hard" mentality that so
many of us subscribe to is that we
are more than just students. Even
during the toughest weeks of the
quarter, we are more than just
essay-writing, p-set-completing,
exam-cramming machines. We are
living, breathing, dynamic individu
als with emotions that need regu

lating, thoughts and words that
need to be listened to, and selves
that need earing for. It is typically
not until after the stormy condi
tions of weeks five and six pass,
that, Emma's analysis suggests,
students begin picking up the
pieces, dealing with personal issues
outside of the classroom and taking
proactive steps to make our person
al lives look as good as our midterm
scores.

There's also a more serious side
to this week seven spike. Not only
does the Bridge receive more calls
in general, but the number of calls
we get related to depression and
suicide are also higher in week
seven than any other week. Smaller
problems compound into bigger
ones, and after these tough weeks
of pushing everything aside for aca
demics, some students find them
selves at an all-time low.
It's no coincidence that I'm wilt
ing this column this week. It's
Tuesday of week six, which accord
ing to my theory, is one of those
brutish weeks that we all just want
to push through and "survive"
before landing on the other side in
a field of rainbows and sunflowers
(week seven). I beg you to look at
this differently. Rather than map
ping your personal life onto the
demands of the quarter, nurture
your whole self every week. Now
I'm not suggesting that we should
all take hour-long meditation
breaks at 10 p.m. instead of writing
the research paper that's due the
next day, but there might be ways
to find more balance in our lives
and adopt more of a "be well" atti
tude.

Make time for exercise, even if it
means cramming for that midterm
for half an hour less. Stop and take
time to eat real meals in the compa
ny of others rather than grabbing a
few goldfish out of the open kitchen.
Take time to breathe and feel grate
ful for your surroundings on the
way to class; take a minute to call
home. Take care of yourself now
and try to dedicate time to both
your studies and your relationships,
both your problem sets and the sets
of problems that arise in the per
sonal, non-academic life of any
Stanford student. Because if you
push these concerns away now and
just power through without taking
time for yourself, chances are those
issues that you push aside won't be
any easier to handle next week.

dents seem to be more stressed out
week seven than any other week?

In return for free housing in the
beautiful Rogers House, sum
mer live-in staffers at the
Bridge do their fair share of
answering calls in the middle of the
night and also complete a sum
mer project. Last summer, senior
Emma Pierson 'l2 spent her two
months at the Bridge producing an
in-depth statistical report on
Bridge counsels. She analyzed
what students seem to be most con
cerned about each week, what time
of day most of our calls come in and
the number of calls fielded by each
staff member. One of the most
interesting things to come out of
her incredible analysis was that
during week seven, the Bridge
receives 30 percent more calls than
during any other week.

Why might this be? Could it be that
week seven means more exams,
papers, and general stress than any
other week? Emma thought the
same thing and did a second analy
sis of when midterms of over twen
ty randomly selected popular
Stanford classes typically occur. It
turns out the peak of midterms
occurs during weeks five and six,
with the number of midterms
taken, on average, dropping signifi
cantly during week seven.
While the data is a bit noisy and
we can't be sure that this trend rep
resents all undergraduates accu
rately, my theory is that Stanford
students spend weeks five and six
of the quarter cramming so much
for midterms, studying so hard and
obsessing so much about exams
and papers, that they often let rela
tionships, anxiety levels, stress and
other "less important" issues fall by
the wayside in an attempt to just
push through two of the toughest
weeks on campus. Living, working
