## FLIP: Confronting the challenges of socioeconomic class on campus 
### 
The first few weeks at Stanford
can be overwhelming. From
figuring out what a "discus
sion section" means to finding EBF
on a map, you've got a lot on your
proverbial plate.

But coming to campus is more
than just learning new acronyms
it's a shift to a totally new socioeco
nomic situation. This transition is

particularly taxing in our resi
dences, where class identities are
most apparent. Maybe you're the
only student in your dorm that
knows what the FAFSA is; maybe
your roommate came to Stanford
with suitcases full of designer
clothes. Or maybe you were sur
prised when she asked you what
your parents did, or when he invit
ed you to a dinner in Palo Alto that
you definitely couldn't afford.
The disparity of wealth at
Stanford can make students of all
socioeconomic backgrounds feel
isolated and frustrated. It might
seem like there's a certain silence
and ignorance around class on cam
pus, since having wealth appears to
be the norm here. All of the cars
and Macbooks and iPhone apps
create a culture that can feel exclu
sive and alienating.
The good news is that there's a
group of students who understand
what you're going through. The
First Generation Low Income
Partnership, or FLIg was created
to end the silence around class at
Stanford, and to create a support
ive community for students who
identify as first-generation and/or
low-income students.
Student organizations and com
munity centers have been support
ing first-generation and low-income
students for decades. But in recent
years, students have been inspired
to create a specific community cen
tered around class. FLIP was
established by a group of students
who felt that their socioeconomic
background played a major role in
shaping their identity and perspec
tive. Frustrated by the apparent
lack of discussion and acknowledge
ment of class identities at Stanford,
these students created a safe, open
space to discuss and explore socioe
conomic diversity at Stanford.
Today, FLIP is a group where you
can meet students with similar per
spectives on class and college, and

chat about the little things that
seem too awkward to bring up with
your friends and dormmates. We
get what it's like to have a room
mate who can make you feel out of
place.
But FLIP isn't just for first-gen
and/or low-income students. I was
that roommate, the girl who was
ignorant and insensitive. I had no
idea what "Quest√üridge" meant,
and I didn't consider how my
actions and possessions might have
made my roommate feel uncomfort
able. It wasn't until my junior year
that I began to understand what
class privilege was. I started to rec
ognize that I had a class identity,
and that I shouldn't try so hard to
hide it. Instead, I decided to work
on being a better ally to friends who
identify as low-income and/or first
generation college students. I
became more invested in combating
classism on campus, and decided to
get more involved in FLIP I'm now
on the leadership core, and I'm
working toward raising awareness
about class privilege among stu
dents who have it by organizing
workshops and discussion groups.
We need to work toward a more
comprehensive conversation about
class on campus. It's easy to think
that because we all share the same
lecture and dining halls, there's no
difference between us. Everyone
experiences Stanford in very dif
ferent ways based on our own
experiences with money. Classism
is pervasive, but it's often subtle
and seemingly harmless. Let's
learn together and create a more
inclusive Stanford community.
