# INSTANT REPLAY
## 
### Ed Reynolds' pick-six Winston Shi 
In last Saturday's Stanford-Washington
State football game, Washington State quar
terback Jeff TRel, aided by head coach and
offensive guru Mike Leach, torched the
Stanford secondary for 401 yards. However,
with Washington State trying to pull off a
comeback in the fourth quarter, Stanford
safety Ed Reynolds returned Tbel's only
interception of the afternoon for a touch
down that put the Cardinal up 24-10.
Before the play, Washington State was
down 17-10 with 10:55 left in the 4th quar
ter and backed up at their own 13-yard
line: They need to score, and as Stanford's
power running game is very effective at
eating up the clock, they need to score
quickly. Facing third and ten, Leach calls
one of his high-risk, high-reward deep
strike combinations.

The key insight of Leach and his so
called "air raid" offense is that putting
additional passing options on the field can
drastically increase the complexity of the
passing game. Washington State is lined
up in a trips left formation: three
receivers to the left, and one to the right.
Quarterback Jeff Tuel is in the shotgun,
five yards behind the line of scrimmage.
Running back Carl Winston (R) lines up
to his right.

Because of Washington State's pass
heavy offense, Stanford is in their dime
package, with six defensive backs (F/S, $,
N, and the three Cs). The middle line
backer (M) plays a "robber" technique
and patrols the middle of the field. The
cornerbacks opposite X, Z, H and Y are
ostensibly playing straight man-to-man
coverage. Stanford defensive coordinator
Derek Mason only sends four pass rush
ers S, T, E and W at Tuel, prefer
ring to keep as many players in the open
field as possible.

The key read for Tuel to make on this
play is the post route with X. Since the
post-wheel combination is an air raid sta
ple, Stanford has prepared accordingly.
The cornerback opposite X reroutes him
slightly, forcing X to run slightly off-kilter

On the trips side, Leach first draws up
a post-wheel combination, where the X
receiver runs a post route that breaks
towards the middle of the field, and the Z
receiver runs to the outside and then
streaks to the end zone. Because X and Z
pass by each other during their routes,
the combination generally confuses the
defenders opposite them, much like a
pick-and-roll in basketball, in which case
at least one of the receivers should be
open for a big play. The H receiver runs a
short pivot route to draw defenders
towards him. The net effect of these three
routes is to create a "triangle stretch"
(shown in blue), where the X and H
receivers stretch the field vertically, and
the Z and H receivers stretch the field lat
erally. This puts a huge amount of strain
on defenses, which makes busted cover
ages and big plays even more likely.
In case Stanford brings more pass
rushers to attack Tuel than the
Washington State offensive line can han
dle, Leach includes two alert routes: a
quick slant by the Y receiver, and a flat
route by the R receiver. If Stanford has
sent enough players to force the alert, at
least one of the two should be open with
plenty of open space in front of him. â– 

and disrupting his timing. After that, he
transfers the coverage responsibility for
X to the safeties behind him and helps to
cover Z.

By now, Tuel's eyes have completely
locked onto X, and it is obvious to every
one that he intends to throw the post. The
Stanford safeties strong safety Jordan
Richards ($) and free safety Ed Reynolds
(F/S) sandwich X: Richards plays
above X and Reynolds jumps the route
underneath him. (Tuel's throw is high
lighted in green.) As it turns out,
Reynolds' timing is perfect, and he inter
cepts the ball and returns it 24 yards for a
touchdown a score that would prove to
be the deciding points in Stanford's favor.
