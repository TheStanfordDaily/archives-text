# STUDENT LIFE
## SIW students affected by Sandy 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford in Washington (SIW) students
hunkered down in the program's Bass Center
as Hurricane Sandy approached Monday,
spending the day playing Risk, watching
movies and catching up on homework.
In anticipation of the storm, one of the cen
ter's security guards along with the chef and his
wife spent Monday night at the house, accord
ing to Program Coordinator Emma
Ogiemwanye 'l2. The house still had power as
of midnight EDT on Monday even though some
residences in the neighborhood had lost power.
The Bass Center is equipped with a backup
generator to supply power in the event of an
outage.

"The program staff is really awesome about
preparedness, so we've always all had flash
lights and tons of bottled water, like 24 cases or
something absurdly high like that," said
Meredith Wheeler 'l4. "That's definitely never
been a concern. They've been talking about
stocking up since mid-last week."
Non-emergency federal government

employees were granted administrative leave
in anticipation of the storm, giving the students
Monday and Tuesday off from their intern
ships.

"When I left my internship on Friday, we
didn't even make a plan because no one thought
we were going to have [days] off of work or any
thing," Miguel Boluda 'l4 said. "The whole
storm just really exploded over the weekend in
terms of intensity."

Two of the three regularly scheduled classes
were held Monday evening at the house on
Connecticut Avenue and no professors have
canceled class yet for Tuesday, according to
Ogiemwanye.

While most students did not leave the house
Monday, those who did were met with increas
ingly dangerous conditions outdoors. Six stu
dents went out to lunch at about 2 p.m. in fine
conditions, but by the time they returned it was
raining and very windy, according to Wheeler.
By the time Matthew Colford 'l4 went to
work out just before dinner, Hurricane Sandy
was making its presence felt.
"I went across the street to the gym, which
was a big mistake because even just walking

across the street was really intense," he said. "I
regretted it the minute I started crossing the
street."

Boluda, dubbed the program's "resident
storm watcher" by his classmates, peered out
his windows to try to get the best possible view
of the storm, but said he could only really see
the street emptying out as the day wore on.
"As much as I wanted to [go outside], and I
was very tempted to, they really begged us not
to unless you really had something to do,"
Boluda said. "I kept myself on my computer all
day just monitoring. I offered the updates for
everyone else."
Although Coif or d said that he expects com
mercial businesses in the area to open some
time Tuesday, the Metro is not scheduled to
reopen and is closed until at least Tuesday
afternoon, giving SIW students at least one
more hurricane day off.
"I think the students enjoyed it more than
anything because they didn't have to go to
work," Ogiemwanye said.
