# Q&A
## John Hennessy: 'The Wild West' 
### 
Stanford University President
John Hennessy sat down with
The Stanford Daily on Oct. 29
to discuss a wide range of
topics, including online edu
cation, Stanford's failed campaign for
a New York City campus last fall,
Stanford's fundraising successes and
more. This is the first of three install
ments of that interview; this one focus
es on online education.
President Hennessy was on sabbati
cal for the second half of'winter quar
ter and all of spring quarter 2012.
During that time he still participated
in a number of Stanford events, visit
ing Beijing to dedicate the Stanford
Center at Peking University, stopping
by campus for the launch, of the
Campaign for Stanford Medicine and
visiting the Bing Overseas Program
in Florence.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How was
your sabbatical?
John Hennessy (JH): It was good. It
was a nice opportunity to get some

reading done and do some thinking
about long-term things and the kind
of thing that you don't have the
opportunity to do when you have a
schedule just jam packed with...
events.
TSD: How did that prepare you for
this year and future years?
JH: Well, I had a very large stack of
books on higher education, every
thing from trends to changes to
what's happening with student pop
ulation and how they're thinking
about college. [The sabbatical] gave
me a chance to read them. Some of
them have been sitting there for a
few years, so it was a good opportu
nity to do that. Then... thinking
about long-term directions for the
University, what are the key things
to understand and begin to contem
plate, what do we want to do about
online education? And what role
does it have at Stanford? How do we
think about doing what's right for us
