# Q&A
## John Hennessy: 'The Wild West' 
### 
Stanford University President
John Hennessy sat down with
The Stanford Daily on Oct. 29
to discuss a wide range of
topics, including online edu
cation, Stanford's failed campaign for
a New York City campus last fall,
Stanford's fundraising successes and
more. This is the first of three install
ments of that interview; this one focus
es on online education.
President Hennessy was on sabbati
cal for the second half of'winter quar
ter and all of spring quarter 2012.
During that time he still participated
in a number of Stanford events, visit
ing Beijing to dedicate the Stanford
Center at Peking University, stopping
by campus for the launch, of the
Campaign for Stanford Medicine and
visiting the Bing Overseas Program
in Florence.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How was
your sabbatical?
John Hennessy (JH): It was good. It
was a nice opportunity to get some

reading done and do some thinking
about long-term things and the kind
of thing that you don't have the
opportunity to do when you have a
schedule just jam packed with...
events.
TSD: How did that prepare you for
this year and future years?
JH: Well, I had a very large stack of
books on higher education, every
thing from trends to changes to
what's happening with student pop
ulation and how they're thinking
about college. [The sabbatical] gave
me a chance to read them. Some of
them have been sitting there for a
few years, so it was a good opportu
nity to do that. Then... thinking
about long-term directions for the
University, what are the key things
to understand and begin to contem
plate, what do we want to do about
online education? And what role
does it have at Stanford? How do we
think about doing what's right for us

as a University in the online
space as opposed to what
everyone else thinks we
should do?
The Faculty Senate has
heard two reports in the past
six months on online educa
tion. In August, John
Mitchell was appointed the
inaugural vice provost for
online educat ion; this is just
the third vice provost office
created in the past 20 years.
TSD: What do you think the
biggest challenge for us in
terms of the online space is?
JH: Well, I think there's
more than one. I mean the
first challenge is probably to
say, "How do we use that
technology to make the
learning experience for our
on-campus students bet
ter?" And right now, we're
trying a bunch of different
things: flipped classroom
and things like that, but we
haven't yet gotten to the
stage where we say, "Okay,
now we think we have an
idea well worked out. Now
let's go try to scientifically
understand whether or not
students are learning more
in that environment,
whether they're better
engaged, how they feel
about the experience." So
we're going to have to clo this
whole process of actually
saying, "Is online better? Is
it worse? Is it the same?"

does with the rest of the
world, particularly those
who don't have access to
education.

The data is quite com
pelling in this. If you look at
sub-Saharan Africa, the
place where education is
hardest to achieve —in the
Western world, 70 percent of
the students of college age
are enrolled in either a two
year or a four-year program
and the average years of
education you can expect if
you were born today in the
United States is 16 years. If
you were born in sub-
Saharan Africa, then less
than 10 percent of the kids
go to any kind of college [or]
any kind of post-high school,
and your average years of
education are eight. So
there's something I think to
add to the rest of the world.

Let's not just do it anec
dotally but build up the
capability to do an assess
ment so we can say, "We've
got data. These students in
the online class are learning
as well [compared to current
methods]." So that's going to
be a key for all of this.... It's
early on. It's the Wild West
out there. So that's okay, but
there's way too much anec
dotal, situational [evidence].
Then I think, figuring out
what role Stanford wants to
have. The MOOCs [massive
open online classes] are
more about self-made, moti
vated learners than they are
about having another 10,000
students at Stanford.
They're more about sharing
some of what the University

... And that's a good thing for
Stanford to do, it's a good
thing to do for the rest of the
world, and then we can do it
with relatively little cost
associated with us at the
end.

So we have our on-cam
pus students and we have
this broad outreach sort of
thing, in the middle I think
we think about how can we
use online to enhance what
we do today perhaps in pro
fessional and continuing
education, perhaps with
respect to master's degrees.
I don't see fundamentally
changing the undergradu
ate, four-year, residential
experience because that is,
in some sense, the gold stan
dard. It's the thing we do
know how to do really well.
Now, will other institutions
in the United States try to
develop an online alternative
to that? Yes, they will,
because the gold standard is,
by its nature, expensive. So
it is, in my mind, the ideal
educational opportunity for
the really best students for
the institutions that can
afford to provide that
together with families. But it

can't be the entire solution
given the cost of education in
the U.S. So people are going
to have to figure out how to
use online in that other
space and should we con
tribute content to it? What
role could content coming
from Stanford play in that?
We don't know the answers
to that, but there probably
are opportunities there that
would be good things.
Numerous Stanford stu
dents, professors and affili
ates have founded online
education startups, such as
Coursera, Udacity,
Class2Go and Venture Labs.
All but Udacity have formal
partnerships with the
University.
TSD: There are a lot of affiliat
ed, Stanford-related groups in
the online education space.
How do you feel about that?
Is that encouraged? Do you
encourage faculty to experi
ment with this stuff and do
their own thing or is it just
sort of something you don't
actively discourage?
JH: Well we don't discourage
it and I think in some cases
we felt, to move the technol
ogy along, it would be nice to
have something out there
that had a similar kind of
business model and similar
approach to what we were
thinking so we could develop
a good working relationship
with them. So I think it's a
combination: We believe that
getting some external enti
ties out there will probably
accelerate the rate at which
this technology moves,
which I think it has. And
that's generally a good
thing.

topics, including online edu
cation, Stanford's failed campaign for
a New York City campus last fall,
Stanford's fundraising successes and
more. This is the first of three install
ments of that interview; this one focus

President Hennessy was on sabbati
cal for the second half of'winter quar
ter and all of spring quarter 2012.
During that time he still participated
in a number of Stanford events, visit
ing Beijing to dedicate the Stanford
Center at Peking University, stopping
by campus for the launch, of the
Campaign for Stanford Medicine and
visiting the Bing Overseas Program
in Florence.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How was
your sabbatical?
John Hennessy (JH): It was good. It
was a nice opportunity to get some

reading done and do some thinking
about long-term things and the kind
of thing that you don't have the
opportunity to do when you have a
schedule just jam packed with...
events.
TSD: How did that prepare you for
this year and future years?
JH: Well, I had a very large stack of
books on higher education, every
thing from trends to changes to
what's happening with student pop
ulation and how they're thinking
about college. [The sabbatical] gave
me a chance to read them. Some of
them have been sitting there for a
few years, so it was a good opportu
nity to do that. Then... thinking
about long-term directions for the
University, what are the key things
to understand and begin to contem
plate, what do we want to do about
online education? And what role
does it have at Stanford? How do we
think about doing what's right for us

as a University in the online
space as opposed to what
everyone else thinks we
should do?
The Faculty Senate has
heard two reports in the past
six months on online educa
tion. In August, John
Mitchell was appointed the
inaugural vice provost for
online educat ion; this is just
the third vice provost office
created in the past 20 years.
TSD: What do you think the
biggest challenge for us in
terms of the online space is?
JH: Well, I think there's
more than one. I mean the
first challenge is probably to
say, "How do we use that
technology to make the
learning experience for our
on-campus students bet
ter?" And right now, we're
trying a bunch of different
things: flipped classroom
and things like that, but we
haven't yet gotten to the
stage where we say, "Okay,
now we think we have an
idea well worked out. Now
let's go try to scientifically
understand whether or not
students are learning more
in that environment,
whether they're better
engaged, how they feel
about the experience." So
we're going to have to clo this
whole process of actually
saying, "Is online better? Is
it worse? Is it the same?"

does with the rest of the
world, particularly those
who don't have access to
education.

The data is quite com
pelling in this. If you look at
sub-Saharan Africa, the
place where education is
hardest to achieve —in the
Western world, 70 percent of
the students of college age
are enrolled in either a two
year or a four-year program
and the average years of
education you can expect if
you were born today in the
United States is 16 years. If
you were born in sub-
Saharan Africa, then less
than 10 percent of the kids
go to any kind of college [or]
any kind of post-high school,
and your average years of
education are eight. So
there's something I think to
add to the rest of the world.

Let's not just do it anec
dotally but build up the
capability to do an assess
ment so we can say, "We've
got data. These students in
the online class are learning
as well [compared to current
methods]." So that's going to
be a key for all of this.... It's
early on. It's the Wild West
out there. So that's okay, but
there's way too much anec
dotal, situational [evidence].
Then I think, figuring out
what role Stanford wants to
have. The MOOCs [massive
open online classes] are
more about self-made, moti
vated learners than they are
about having another 10,000
students at Stanford.
They're more about sharing
some of what the University

... And that's a good thing for
Stanford to do, it's a good
thing to do for the rest of the
world, and then we can do it
with relatively little cost
associated with us at the
end.

So we have our on-cam
pus students and we have
this broad outreach sort of
thing, in the middle I think
we think about how can we
use online to enhance what
we do today perhaps in pro
fessional and continuing
education, perhaps with
respect to master's degrees.
I don't see fundamentally
changing the undergradu
ate, four-year, residential
experience because that is,
in some sense, the gold stan
dard. It's the thing we do
know how to do really well.
Now, will other institutions
in the United States try to
develop an online alternative
to that? Yes, they will,
because the gold standard is,
by its nature, expensive. So
it is, in my mind, the ideal
educational opportunity for
the really best students for
the institutions that can
afford to provide that
together with families. But it

can't be the entire solution
given the cost of education in
the U.S. So people are going
to have to figure out how to
use online in that other
space and should we con
tribute content to it? What
role could content coming
from Stanford play in that?
We don't know the answers
to that, but there probably
are opportunities there that
would be good things.
Numerous Stanford stu
dents, professors and affili
ates have founded online
education startups, such as
Coursera, Udacity,
Class2Go and Venture Labs.
All but Udacity have formal
partnerships with the
University.
TSD: There are a lot of affiliat
ed, Stanford-related groups in
the online education space.
How do you feel about that?
Is that encouraged? Do you
encourage faculty to experi
ment with this stuff and do
their own thing or is it just
sort of something you don't
actively discourage?
JH: Well we don't discourage
it and I think in some cases
we felt, to move the technol
ogy along, it would be nice to
have something out there
that had a similar kind of
business model and similar
approach to what we were
thinking so we could develop
a good working relationship
with them. So I think it's a
combination: We believe that
getting some external enti
ties out there will probably
accelerate the rate at which
this technology moves,
which I think it has. And
that's generally a good
thing.
