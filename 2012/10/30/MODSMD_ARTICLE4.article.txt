## Gas line to be fixed within week PG&E has no estimate of amount of gets released 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
expects to complete repairs on the
damaged gas pipeline at the inter
section of Junipero Serra
Boulevard and Campus Drive West
within the week, according to
PG&E spokesperson Jason King.
Crews will have to install a new
valve on gas line #132 before bring
ing the pipe on line.
King said he does not know how
much gas leaked out of the pipe
before the hole could be plugged.
He also could not estimate the cost
of repairing the damaged pipe.
The damage occurred when a
PG&E crew doing repair work hit a
2-inch valve that is fed from the 24-
inch main pipe. An SUAlert the
campuswide alert email, text mes
sage and voicemail system was
issued to campus at about 6:45 p.m.,
warning people to stay indoors if
they were within a three-quarter
mile radius of the intersection.
Some West Campus residents live
within this radius.
The six customers affected by
the shut down in the damaged sec
tion of line #132 are currently being
supplied with backup gas service
that bypasses the isolated segment
containing the broken valve, King
said. He added that PG&E is get
ting gift certificates for people who
were eating at the Stanford Grill
when the gas leak occurred, forcing
the diners to leave the area.
The PG&E crew on site isolated
the section of the pipe where the
damage occurred and vented all of
the gas in that section by 1 a.m.
Saturday. Secondary valves were
opened at Sand Hill Road and
Branner Drive to relieve pressure
in line #132.
By 5 a.m. Saturday, crews had
finished excavating the area around
the damaged valve and had
removed the valve to plug the hole
in the 24-inch pipe.
Junipero Serra Boulevard was
closed to all traffic between Alpine
Road and Campus Drive East until
around 8:45 a.m. on Saturday. By 10
a.m., metal plates were placed over
the excavated area to allow traffic
for the football game.
The Palo Alto Fire Department,
California Highway Patrol and Stanford
Department of Public Safety responded to
the scene. All Palo Alto Fire units had left the
scene by 1:30 a.m.

Line #132 is the same line that failed in
September 2010 in San Bruno, causing an
explosion that killed eight people. Tests con

ducted in November 2011 found two sections
that required repair one along from Alma
Road in Palo Alto to Branner Drive in Menlo
Park and another starting at the intersection
of Sand Hill Road and Branner, running
north to Interstate 280 but did not indicate
a need to replace the pipeline.
The Oct. 24 controlled venting procedure
from PG&E line #lO9 on the Stanford Golf
Course was unrelated to the damage at line
#132.
