# STUDENT LIFE
## Mausoleum mostly frosh 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Mausoleum attendance was roughly
equivalent to the attendance last year despite
the lack of a bus service to transport students
from dorm areas to the party. Freshmen
attendance rose sharply to 72 percent of total
Mausoleum attendees, compared to 49 per
cent last year.
The SUID cards of 1,417 students were
scanned at the entrance this year, compared
with the 1,477 scanned last year. According to
Snehal Naik, assistant dean and associate
director of Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL), the number of actual attendees varied
from the number of scanned IDs by 100 to
200 students.
Buses axed
The junior class presidents decided to
cancel buses for "safety reasons," according
to Junior Class President Hunter Kodama
'l4.
"We've had a number of issues with buses
before, more so with overly intoxicated peo
ple trying to get on the bus being impatient,
getting the bus drivers and other staff like
security very frustrated," Naik said. "The
payoff was just not there, [after] analyzing
the problems versus the benefits."
Cost also factored into the decision to cut
the bus service. According to Kodoma, the
round trip from Tresidder Union to the
Mausoleum on a bus takes approximately 30
minutes and a single bus fits 50 riders.
Coordination at multiple bus stops also
proved difficult last year. In addition to the
barricades and security personnel needed at
each bus stop, these problems became logis
tically and financially prohibitive.
After initially deciding to bus students
only from the Oval to the Mausoleum, the
presidents eliminated buses entirely. They
moved the party's entrance pathway to the
intersection of Palm Drive and Campus
Drive and added lighting and signage to help
students find the Mausoleum.
Kodama and Naik emphasized that stu
dent residences are not much further from
Mausoleum than they are from Stanford
Stadium, where students walk to attend foot
ball games.
Kodama attributed the low turnout
among upperclassmen to the elimination of
the bus system, but noted that he believes

attendance will even out in future years
because rising classes will not expect buses to
be available.
"Ultimately what the decision came down
to was the cost effectiveness," Kodama said.
"In order to safely and properly implement a
bus system would require many more buses.
... We decided to instead take some of that
money we'd save and put it towards making
the event itself better."
Alcohol concerns
In a presentation on May 18, 2012, repre
sentatives from the Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) called Full Moon on
the Quad (FMOTQ) and Mausoleum "high
risk social events" for alcohol abuse. Alcohol
transports were down at both events this
year.
Mausoleum had one alcohol transport this
year, compared with "five or six" last year,
according to Naik. Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
Public Information Officer Bill Larson
reported no arrest or altercations. According
to Larson, Kathy Harris, Stanford
Emergency Medical Service (StEMS) super
visor reported only "a handful of small med
ical issues."
"The information that went out about the
event, about what exactly happens at the
mausoleum, is very important... [such as]
how the flyer was made specifically mention
ing about zero tolerance for intoxication,"
Naik said.
Cardinal Nights sponsored Scream on the
Green, a movie screening of two Halloween
themed films on Levin Field, simultaneously
with Mausoleum. The first screening began
at 9 p.m. and, according to Kodama, gave stu
dents an "alternative to pre-gaming." He
said that the second screening at 11 p.m. pro
vided a social venue for students "not into the
party scene at Mausoleum."
Kodama also reported positive feedback
from resident assistants (RAs) in freshmen
dorms regarding the elimination of the
buses. RAs were able to advise their resi
dents to remain sober enough to be able to
navigate to the Mausoleum and some walked
their dorms in groups to the party.
SAL also doubled the number of profes
sional student affairs staff at the event.
"I saw at FMOTQ that staff did better
when they were paired up
with somebody," Naik said.
In the past, three or four
student affairs staff mem
bers attended Mausoleum
but this year eight attended.
OAPE added a training
session for Mausoleum sober
monitors. Around 50 student
volunteers helped staff the
event, a significant portion of
whom were not affiliated
with the junior class cabinet
or the ASSU, according to
Kodama.

Mausoleum changes
There were also changes
to the physical set-up for the
party, including the entry
pathway decorations and
speaker system set-up.
The pathway from the
intersection of Palm and
Campus Drives was decorat
ed to emulate a "Halloween
funhouse at a fair," accord
ing to Kodama. Stanford
Event Services staff mem
bers lit the pathway to

match the Halloween theme
and the junior class presi
dents arranged for a "scary
performer" to frighten stu
dents on their way in. A sep
arate speaker system played
Halloween-themed music to
"set the mood."

Organizers rented barri
cades in order to seal off the
Mausoleum and ensure
attendees used the scanner
equipped entrance. Usually,
these barricades are rented
from SUDPS but this year
they were rented from an
outside organization because
the SUDPS barricades had
already been set up for the
Stanford v. Washington
State football game the next
day.

The cabinet also added a
truss above the DJ booth to
"improve the look" of the
party and a photo booth,
which Kodama described as
a "huge hit." Photos from
the night are available on the
Mausoleum Facebook page.
Naik described the light
ing as the best he has seen in
five years of working with
junior class presidents to
plan the event.
Organizers and SAL

were also wary of the poten
tial for noise complaints.
This year, SUDPS shut
down FMOTQ early due to
numerous noise complaints
from Palo Alto residents. At
Mausoleum, SAL supervi
sors used a decibel reader to
monitor the sound level.

"Every time you do an
outside event there's always
an awareness that we have
as part of the community, as
students and residents in the
local area," Naik said. "I
think we made a good faith
effort to make sure that the
sound was reasonable"
There was a smaller
sound system on hand to be
used in the event of noise
complaints, but none were
reported.

"Aside from the one
transport, I think every
thing else was fantastic,"
Naik said. "The students did
a great job, it was really a
joint effort of putting togeth
er this event and making it a
success, from the details of
how it looked to the messag
ing and the publicity."

their dorms in groups to the party.
SAL also doubled the number of profes
sional student affairs staff at the event.
"I saw at FMOTQ that staff did better
when they were paired up
with somebody," Naik said.
In the past, three or four
student affairs staff mem
bers attended Mausoleum
but this year eight attended.
OAPE added a training
session for Mausoleum sober
monitors. Around 50 student
volunteers helped staff the
event, a significant portion of
whom were not affiliated
with the junior class cabinet
or the ASSU, according to
Kodama.

Mausoleum changes
There were also changes
to the physical set-up for the
party, including the entry
pathway decorations and
speaker system set-up.
The pathway from the
intersection of Palm and
Campus Drives was decorat
ed to emulate a "Halloween
funhouse at a fair," accord
ing to Kodama. Stanford
Event Services staff mem
bers lit the pathway to

match the Halloween theme
and the junior class presi
dents arranged for a "scary
performer" to frighten stu
dents on their way in. A sep
arate speaker system played
Halloween-themed music to
"set the mood."

Organizers rented barri
cades in order to seal off the
Mausoleum and ensure
attendees used the scanner
equipped entrance. Usually,
these barricades are rented
from SUDPS but this year
they were rented from an
outside organization because
the SUDPS barricades had
already been set up for the
Stanford v. Washington
State football game the next
day.

The cabinet also added a
truss above the DJ booth to
"improve the look" of the
party and a photo booth,
which Kodama described as
a "huge hit." Photos from
the night are available on the
Mausoleum Facebook page.
Naik described the light
ing as the best he has seen in
five years of working with
junior class presidents to
plan the event.
Organizers and SAL

were also wary of the poten
tial for noise complaints.
This year, SUDPS shut
down FMOTQ early due to
numerous noise complaints
from Palo Alto residents. At
Mausoleum, SAL supervi
sors used a decibel reader to
monitor the sound level.

"Every time you do an
outside event there's always
an awareness that we have
as part of the community, as
students and residents in the
local area," Naik said. "I
think we made a good faith
effort to make sure that the
sound was reasonable"
There was a smaller
sound system on hand to be
used in the event of noise
complaints, but none were
reported.

"Aside from the one
transport, I think every
thing else was fantastic,"
Naik said. "The students did
a great job, it was really a
joint effort of putting togeth
er this event and making it a
success, from the details of
how it looked to the messag
ing and the publicity."

Mausoleum attendance was roughly
equivalent to the attendance last year despite
the lack of a bus service to transport students
from dorm areas to the party. Freshmen
attendance rose sharply to 72 percent of total
Mausoleum attendees, compared to 49 per
cent last year.
The SUID cards of 1,417 students were
scanned at the entrance this year, compared
with the 1,477 scanned last year. According to
Snehal Naik, assistant dean and associate
director of Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL), the number of actual attendees varied
from the number of scanned IDs by 100 to
200 students.
Buses axed
The junior class presidents decided to
cancel buses for "safety reasons," according
to Junior Class President Hunter Kodama
'l4.
"We've had a number of issues with buses
before, more so with overly intoxicated peo
ple trying to get on the bus being impatient,
getting the bus drivers and other staff like
security very frustrated," Naik said. "The
payoff was just not there, [after] analyzing
the problems versus the benefits."
Cost also factored into the decision to cut
the bus service. According to Kodoma, the
round trip from Tresidder Union to the
Mausoleum on a bus takes approximately 30
minutes and a single bus fits 50 riders.
Coordination at multiple bus stops also
proved difficult last year. In addition to the
barricades and security personnel needed at
each bus stop, these problems became logis
tically and financially prohibitive.
After initially deciding to bus students
only from the Oval to the Mausoleum, the
presidents eliminated buses entirely. They
moved the party's entrance pathway to the
intersection of Palm Drive and Campus
Drive and added lighting and signage to help
students find the Mausoleum.
Kodama and Naik emphasized that stu
dent residences are not much further from
Mausoleum than they are from Stanford
Stadium, where students walk to attend foot
ball games.
Kodama attributed the low turnout
among upperclassmen to the elimination of
the bus system, but noted that he believes

attendance will even out in future years
because rising classes will not expect buses to
be available.
"Ultimately what the decision came down
to was the cost effectiveness," Kodama said.
"In order to safely and properly implement a
bus system would require many more buses.
... We decided to instead take some of that
money we'd save and put it towards making
the event itself better."
Alcohol concerns
In a presentation on May 18, 2012, repre
sentatives from the Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) called Full Moon on
the Quad (FMOTQ) and Mausoleum "high
risk social events" for alcohol abuse. Alcohol
transports were down at both events this
year.
Mausoleum had one alcohol transport this
year, compared with "five or six" last year,
according to Naik. Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
Public Information Officer Bill Larson
reported no arrest or altercations. According
to Larson, Kathy Harris, Stanford
Emergency Medical Service (StEMS) super
visor reported only "a handful of small med
ical issues."
"The information that went out about the
event, about what exactly happens at the
mausoleum, is very important... [such as]
how the flyer was made specifically mention
ing about zero tolerance for intoxication,"
Naik said.
Cardinal Nights sponsored Scream on the
Green, a movie screening of two Halloween
themed films on Levin Field, simultaneously
with Mausoleum. The first screening began
at 9 p.m. and, according to Kodama, gave stu
dents an "alternative to pre-gaming." He
said that the second screening at 11 p.m. pro
vided a social venue for students "not into the
party scene at Mausoleum."
Kodama also reported positive feedback
from resident assistants (RAs) in freshmen
dorms regarding the elimination of the
buses. RAs were able to advise their resi
dents to remain sober enough to be able to
navigate to the Mausoleum and some walked
their dorms in groups to the party.
SAL also doubled the number of profes
