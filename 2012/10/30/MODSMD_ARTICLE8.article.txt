### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Alice Phillips 
The University Entrepreneurship Report,
released Monday by CB Insights, said that
Stanford alumni raised the most funding of six
universities studied for venture capital and
angel deals from 2007 to 2011. Graduates or
dropouts from the schools studied in the
report Stanford, Harvard, MIT, NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Pennsylvania
—were responsible for $12.6 billion in trans
actions over 559 deals.
Stanford alumni companies made 203 ven
ture capital and angel deals, totaling $4.1 bil
lion in investment funding.
Harvard came in second in both categories,
with its alumni making 112 deals for $3.8 bil
lion in investment. However, if financing asso
ciated with Facebook is exempted from calcu
lations then Harvard's funding for investment
drops to $l.B billion.
UC-Berkeley came in third in both cate
gories, with 90 investment deals and $1.3 bil
lion in investment. NYU and UPenn both had
$1.2 billion in investment, with NYU netting
48 venture capital and angel deals and UPenn
making 46. MIT was fourth in number of deals
with 60 but sixth in amount of investment by
university alumni with $l.O billion.
The study also measured which universi
ties are growing the fastest in the venture cap
ital investment world, with Harvard and NYU
posting the highest rates of growth in financial
activity since 2007.
