## Where's the big rush? 
### Tom Taylor 
Wait, it's over already?
I was just about to
get into this World
Series but now it
seems the Giants
have gone and swept Detroit 4-0. I
realize baseball is not my strongest
suit, but I can't quite believe I missed
that entirely. My local team won the
biggest prize in Major League
Baseball and there's me out pumpkin
carving. Please, no one tell my man
aging editor; he might revoke my
sports editor privileges.
Last year I made fun of a friend in
these pages for worrying why
Andrew Luck hadn't yet found a job,
even though the NFL Draft was still
a few weeks away. Yesterday she paid
the favor back, pointing out my own
sporting knowledge deficiencies. You
reap what you sow.
Worse, I should admit to a sum
mer of procrastination. I meant to go
to at least one baseball game or watch
at least one from start to finish on TV
One hundred and sixty-two games
lushed by, the playoffs really only
crept into my consciousness since one
of my other friends is a big Cardinals
fan and just as I was thinking about
trying to and meet up with Mends in
the city to watch on TV of course
the Giants win the World Series on
their return to AT&T Park, the sea
son is over.

I now face six months of feeling
guilty before I can apologize in the
only way that really counts, actually
showing up at either of the Bay
Area's two ballparks to enjoy a couple
of hours of America's national pas
time.

However, though I know I'll get
some haters for saying this no one
likes a foreigner coming and telling
you what's wrong with the way you
do things I can't quite help but feel
it's not entirely my fault.
I hate the way tied college soccer
games end in the United States. First
of all, teams have to play up to two
periods of overtime to escape the
dreaded draw, instead of embracing
it. Secondly, and more infuriatingly,
they play the golden-goal rule.

This sudden-death rule means
that the first team to score wins the
game immediately. There is no
chance for the opposing players to
get one back; the game simply ends.
All the built-up emotion and
atmosphere in the stadium, the hopes
and dreams of players and support
ers, are both ignited and killed in one
single second. That's it, game over, no
feeling that there could still be hope
even as time is running out.
Goodnight, goodbye, can someone
turn the lights off on the way out?

The rule was intended to avert the
lottery that is a penalty shootout, but
the devastation of losing by golden
goal was so bad that teams simply
played more defensively, more scared
of conceding than hopeful of scoring.
It was such an unpopular' rule that
the International Football
Association Board (IFAB) stripped
both it and its successor, the silver
goal, from the Laws of the Game in
2004.

Yet here it persists. Maybe that
points to some crucial difference
between the American and British
psyches, either that you actually like
sudden death, or that it is simply a
lesser evil compared with a tie.

I realize of course that the World
Series isn't exactly the same thing;
that the only reason it ended up
being sudden death for Detroit so
early was due to the Tigers' inabili
ty to win one game, just one single
game, against the Giants. But it still
seems just a little bit of a let down
that San Francisco fans didn't get to
see their team one last time in their
city.

If you disagree with me as I
suspect you do maybe I should
make it a little clearer where I'm
coming from. Baseball's interna
tional equivalent would probably be
cricket and a sequence of games
with about the same importance as
the World Series would be the bian
nual Ashes series played between
England and Australia. This con
sists of five Test matches that can
last up to five days each, played in
different grounds in one of the
countries; the right to be host
rotates every two years.
However, no part of the Ashes
appears remotely like sudden
death. If a team is too far behind in
a match to win, it can just try to
hold on until time expires and force
a tie. And even if one team comes
out and wins the first three games
straight, clinching the title, the
remaining games are still played.
For nothing else but pure pride,
