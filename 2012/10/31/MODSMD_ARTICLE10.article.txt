# Midweek Football Notes
## HOGAN TO TAKE MORE SNAPS AT QB 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There was big news at Stanford
head coach David Shaw's weekly press
conference on Tuesday. Sophomore
Kevin Hogan, who has seen a few snaps
at quarterback over the past few
weeks, will see significantly more play
ing time moving forward.
Earlier this season, Shaw pro
claimed that he didn't believe in rotating
quarterbacks. But now, after current
starter senior Josh Nunes' struggles
and Hogan's continued development,
Shaw felt that he had to do something.
This is beginning to feel like the
beginning of the end for Nunes' tenure
as the Stanford starting quarterback.
When asked if he could see a situation
in which Hogan could earn the starting
role with continued good play, Shaw
simply said "yes."
It's a dramatic shift from the rheto
ric heard earlier this season, and
turned heads all around the program.
Shaw's most jarring point was that
Nunes and Hogan are now competing
for every play in practice. Whoever
runs a play better in his practice reps
will run that play in the game.
For this week, Shaw thinks this will
lead to somewhere between 12 and 20
snaps for Hogan. Shaw also hopes to
include some combination of short
stretches of plays and full drives for the
sophomore signal caller.
Nunes didn't seem visibly shaken by
the move when speaking to reporters
yesterday, but he is always fairly calm
during these sessions. He reiterated
that he needs to be more consistent, a
constant message from week to week
by the quarterback.
Lost in this new battle is Nunes'
main contender from August's train
ing camp, Brett Nottingham. The
redshirt sophomore has been pretty
much an afterthought for most of this
season. When asked about how
Nottingham has looked at practice
during the season, Shaw simply said
that he's looked "fine," followed by a
long silence before the next question.
Another freshman seeing his play
ing time rise recently is offensive tack
le Andrus Peat. The true freshman Peat
played almost every play of the second
