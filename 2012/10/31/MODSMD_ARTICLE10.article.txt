# Midweek Football Notes
## HOGAN TO TAKE MORE SNAPS AT QB 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
There was big news at Stanford
head coach David Shaw's weekly press
conference on Tuesday. Sophomore
Kevin Hogan, who has seen a few snaps
at quarterback over the past few
weeks, will see significantly more play
ing time moving forward.
Earlier this season, Shaw pro
claimed that he didn't believe in rotating
quarterbacks. But now, after current
starter senior Josh Nunes' struggles
and Hogan's continued development,
Shaw felt that he had to do something.
This is beginning to feel like the
beginning of the end for Nunes' tenure
as the Stanford starting quarterback.
When asked if he could see a situation
in which Hogan could earn the starting
role with continued good play, Shaw
simply said "yes."
It's a dramatic shift from the rheto
ric heard earlier this season, and
turned heads all around the program.
Shaw's most jarring point was that
Nunes and Hogan are now competing
for every play in practice. Whoever
runs a play better in his practice reps
will run that play in the game.
For this week, Shaw thinks this will
lead to somewhere between 12 and 20
snaps for Hogan. Shaw also hopes to
include some combination of short
stretches of plays and full drives for the
sophomore signal caller.
Nunes didn't seem visibly shaken by
the move when speaking to reporters
yesterday, but he is always fairly calm
during these sessions. He reiterated
that he needs to be more consistent, a
constant message from week to week
by the quarterback.
Lost in this new battle is Nunes'
main contender from August's train
ing camp, Brett Nottingham. The
redshirt sophomore has been pretty
much an afterthought for most of this
season. When asked about how
Nottingham has looked at practice
during the season, Shaw simply said
that he's looked "fine," followed by a
long silence before the next question.
Another freshman seeing his play
ing time rise recently is offensive tack
le Andrus Peat. The true freshman Peat
played almost every play of the second

Sophomore wide receiver Ty Montgomery (88) may return for Stanford against Colorado this weekend.
He has been absent due to injury since the No. 14 Cardinal beat Arizona on Oct. 6.
half against Washington
State at left tackle, with jun
ior David Yankey in at left
guard.
However, this ascension
took a blow Monday night,
when Peat injured his finger
at practice. Shaw's initial
prognosis is that Peat will not
play against Colorado, but
nothing is official yet.
But there is good news for
Stanford on the injury front.
Sophomore wide receiver iy
Montgomery is continuing to
recover from his lower leg
injury. Shaw did say that he
probably still won't know if
Montgomery will play until
Thursday, but it's certainly
an encouraging sign.
Besides the injuries,
Stanford's biggest concern
this week is with the altitude
at Colorado. Boulder is locat
ed at over a mile above sea
level, presenting a challenge
this Stanford team hasn't
faced since 1990.
Shaw related his memo
ries from that 1990 game,
which was shockingly close
for Buffalo fans. Stanford led
14-0 early and then 17-14 in
the fourth quarter against
the sixth-ranked Buffs.
However, thanks to two ques
tionable calls on fourth down,
Colorado scored to win the
game with under a minute
left, a reminder that Stanford

has had officiating issues for
a very long time.
Shaw, in addition to his
experience back in 1990, does
have a significant amount of
experience coaching at alti
tude. As a member of the
Oakland Raiders coaching
staff, he traveled to Denver
every year to face the division
rival Broncos.
Contrary to what many
people would think, Shaw
told reporters that the
biggest challenge for players
at altitude is the first quarter
and half of the game. Players
struggle to get used to the
shortness of breath, but once
they do, it usually isn't a huge
issue. Shaw plans on rotating
players more than usual very
early in the game to combat
this problem.
One of the Stanford play
ers at the press conference,
junior offensive guard Dillon
Bonnell, is very familiar with
altitude issues. Bonnell grew
up about one hour outside of
Boulder and played his high
school ball up in the moun
tains.
In his opinion, the altitude
shouldn't be too much of an
issue for the Cardinal. He
believes the effect is felt
more strongly when a team
that practices at altitude
plays at sea level. For the
first time in his life, Bonnell
will truly find out what it's
like to visit home as the low
altitude opponent.
