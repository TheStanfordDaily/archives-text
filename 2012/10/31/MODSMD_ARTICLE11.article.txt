## Op-Ed Action, not discourse, will fight injustice 
### JESSICA ANDERSON'14 
During all of my time at this
prestigious institution, the
discourse about social injus
tice has always outweighed the
activism. And in one instant this
week, I realized just how much that
reality matters to me.
Here in Washington D.C., where
I'm studying with Stanford in
Washington (SIW), a woman
named Sharmeka Moffitt recently
suffered from third degree burns
on over 60% of her body. Some
reports claimed that Moffitt had
been burned by members of the
Klu Klux Klan; Moffitt reported
that three hooded men attacked
her and then etched "KKK" on her
car windshield.
I returned to the SIW house
ready to share the news with other
students. When I did, some stu
dents acted completely surprised,
asked why it had not made national
news, and then immediately
returned to eating their grilled
salmon, rice pilaf and assorted
desserts.
I could not help but question
everything around me at that
moment. How many women would
have to burn in order for people to
respond? Do we honestly believe
that one provocative question and a
moment of silence will put an end to
the innumerable injustices that still
exist in our society? While the
details of the Moffitt case are now
uncertain, I have nonetheless been
left questioning our approach to
injustice. Consequently, I have
spent a good deal of my time here
at Stanford in Washington grap
pling with the many sociopolitical
issues that have somehow escaped
the presidential campaign agenda,
escaped Stanford's agenda and ulti
mately may have escaped this
nation's agenda.
I find it hard to ignore that of
the children born in 2001, one in
every three Black youth and one in
every six Latino youth will be
incarcerated.
I find it hard to ignore that 75
percent of this generation will be
unable to qualify for participation
in the military due to their "inabili
ty" to demonstrate reading profi
ciency.
I find it hard to ignore that after
600,000 American deaths in the
Civil War, 3,437 lynchings of Black
Americans since the
Reconstruction, and dozens of
deaths during the nonviolent civil
rights struggles of the 19605, 9,000
African-Americans are still mur
dered each year. And 93% of those
deaths are caused by other African-
Americans.
I find it hard to ignore that less
than two years ago, UC San Diego
students hung a lynch rope from a
light fixture on campus, imitated
what they considered "life in the
ghetto" and called many Black
Student Union members a wide
array of racial epithets.
I find it hard to ignore that a
child dies of poor sanitation every
20 seconds.
I find it hard to ignore that
America is number one in number
of billionaires and number one in
number of those incarcerated.
I find it hard to ignore that of
234 American cities, 53% prohibit
begging and 40% prohibit sleeping
in public places.
I find it hard to ignore that in
2009, over 6,600 hate crimes took
place based upon race, gender,
(dis)ability, sexual orientation, reli
gion or ethnicity.
Booker T. Washington once said,
"Success may injure individuals,
institutions and countries more
than poverty." I am of the belief
that many of us, already positioned
on our various paths to success,
may rely too heavily on the success
of the change agents that came
before us, that we somehow may in
fact believe that all the work has
been done.
We are content with three
minute, 30-minute or three-hour
round table discussions about race,
class and privilege and are thus sat
isfied with conversations that many
times present no new information,
to the same old faces that always
engage in these conversations.
Consequently, we revel in our suc
cess while we are poor in change,
poor in action and poor in dedica
tion to the issues that could ruin
this century.
Many talk big and act small.
I am afraid that this generation
will stagnate and ultimately
regress by resting complacently
upon the literature and legacies of
the many 20th-century leaders who
actually acted upon their beliefs
after spending nights discussing
the crippling issues that pervaded
society.

I am afraid that after all of the
work we do here, we will think
we've pulled ourselves up by the
bootstraps and lose sight of the fact
that so many don't have boots in the
first place.

I am afraid that we have become
so critical of resume building that
we now masquerade under guises
of social activism and service.

I am afraid that this generation
will only have conversations and,
even worse, only those that are
comfortable.

I am afraid that we will return
to our communities, return to our
"usual" surroundings, and forget
about the "unusual" circumstances
of those who are homeless, in
poverty or serving time in prison.
I am afraid that we will get
caught up in the suspended reali
ties that Stanford culture creates
and fail to recognize the prevalence
of race-based, ethnically based,
gender-based, faith-based and ori
entation-based discrimination.
I am afraid that we will be too
busy to remember victims, honor
survivors and become advocates.

I am afraid that we will be a gen
eration that says everything and
does nothing.

Work is the foundation of a life
of meaning. If we don't do the work,
we leave nothing of significance
behind. What work have we done?
What work are we doing now?
What work are we going to do to
fight the many ills that plague us on
a local, national and international
level?

I leave you with one more quote
one that sums up my critique of
Stanford approaches to social
issues:

"It's not the critic who counts.
Not the man who points out where
the strong man stumbled or where
the doer of great deeds could have
done better. The credit belongs to
the man who is actually in the
arena. Whose face is marred by
dust and sweat and blood. Who
strives valiantly, who errs and
comes up short again and again.
And who, while daring greatly,
spends himself in a worthy cause so
that his place may not be among
those cold and timid souls who
know neither victory nor defeat."
Theodore Roosevelt
I don't want us to spend our
lives being critics when we can fight
in the ring, when we can put our
leadership, abilities, even our very
lives behind our rhetoric to fight
injustice. We can overcome this
enemy of injustice with the weapon
that can truly have the most
impact: real action.
I hope to return to a campus
that is as dedicated to action as it is
to discourse.

the many 20th-century leaders who
actually acted upon their beliefs
after spending nights discussing
the crippling issues that pervaded
society.

I am afraid that after all of the
work we do here, we will think
we've pulled ourselves up by the
bootstraps and lose sight of the fact
that so many don't have boots in the
first place.

I am afraid that we have become
so critical of resume building that
we now masquerade under guises
of social activism and service.

I am afraid that this generation
will only have conversations and,
even worse, only those that are
comfortable.

I am afraid that we will return
to our communities, return to our
"usual" surroundings, and forget
about the "unusual" circumstances
of those who are homeless, in
poverty or serving time in prison.
I am afraid that we will get
caught up in the suspended reali
ties that Stanford culture creates
and fail to recognize the prevalence
of race-based, ethnically based,
gender-based, faith-based and ori
entation-based discrimination.
I am afraid that we will be too
busy to remember victims, honor
survivors and become advocates.

I am afraid that we will be a gen
eration that says everything and
does nothing.

Work is the foundation of a life
of meaning. If we don't do the work,
we leave nothing of significance
behind. What work have we done?
What work are we doing now?
What work are we going to do to
fight the many ills that plague us on
a local, national and international
level?

I leave you with one more quote
one that sums up my critique of
Stanford approaches to social
issues:

"It's not the critic who counts.
Not the man who points out where
the strong man stumbled or where
the doer of great deeds could have
done better. The credit belongs to
the man who is actually in the
arena. Whose face is marred by
dust and sweat and blood. Who
strives valiantly, who errs and
comes up short again and again.
And who, while daring greatly,
spends himself in a worthy cause so
that his place may not be among
those cold and timid souls who
know neither victory nor defeat."
Theodore Roosevelt
I don't want us to spend our
lives being critics when we can fight
in the ring, when we can put our
leadership, abilities, even our very
lives behind our rhetoric to fight
injustice. We can overcome this
enemy of injustice with the weapon
that can truly have the most
impact: real action.
I hope to return to a campus
that is as dedicated to action as it is
to discourse.

The discourse
has always
outweighed the
activism
During all of my time at this
prestigious institution, the
discourse about social injus
tice has always outweighed the
activism. And in one instant this
week, I realized just how much that
reality matters to me.
Here in Washington D.C., where
I'm studying with Stanford in
Washington (SIW), a woman
named Sharmeka Moffitt recently
suffered from third degree burns
on over 60% of her body. Some
reports claimed that Moffitt had
been burned by members of the
Klu Klux Klan; Moffitt reported
that three hooded men attacked
her and then etched "KKK" on her
car windshield.
I returned to the SIW house
ready to share the news with other
students. When I did, some stu
dents acted completely surprised,
asked why it had not made national
news, and then immediately
returned to eating their grilled
salmon, rice pilaf and assorted
desserts.
I could not help but question
everything around me at that
moment. How many women would
have to burn in order for people to
respond? Do we honestly believe
that one provocative question and a
moment of silence will put an end to
the innumerable injustices that still
exist in our society? While the
details of the Moffitt case are now
uncertain, I have nonetheless been
left questioning our approach to
injustice. Consequently, I have
spent a good deal of my time here
at Stanford in Washington grap
pling with the many sociopolitical
issues that have somehow escaped
the presidential campaign agenda,
escaped Stanford's agenda and ulti
mately may have escaped this
nation's agenda.
I find it hard to ignore that of
the children born in 2001, one in
every three Black youth and one in
every six Latino youth will be
incarcerated.
I find it hard to ignore that 75
percent of this generation will be
unable to qualify for participation
in the military due to their "inabili
ty" to demonstrate reading profi
ciency.
I find it hard to ignore that after
600,000 American deaths in the
Civil War, 3,437 lynchings of Black
Americans since the
Reconstruction, and dozens of
deaths during the nonviolent civil
rights struggles of the 19605, 9,000
African-Americans are still mur
dered each year. And 93% of those
deaths are caused by other African-
Americans.
I find it hard to ignore that less
than two years ago, UC San Diego
students hung a lynch rope from a
light fixture on campus, imitated
what they considered "life in the
ghetto" and called many Black
Student Union members a wide
array of racial epithets.
I find it hard to ignore that a
child dies of poor sanitation every
20 seconds.
I find it hard to ignore that
America is number one in number
of billionaires and number one in
number of those incarcerated.
I find it hard to ignore that of
234 American cities, 53% prohibit
begging and 40% prohibit sleeping
in public places.
I find it hard to ignore that in
2009, over 6,600 hate crimes took
place based upon race, gender,
(dis)ability, sexual orientation, reli
gion or ethnicity.
Booker T. Washington once said,
"Success may injure individuals,
institutions and countries more
than poverty." I am of the belief
that many of us, already positioned
on our various paths to success,
may rely too heavily on the success
of the change agents that came
before us, that we somehow may in
fact believe that all the work has
been done.
We are content with three
minute, 30-minute or three-hour
round table discussions about race,
class and privilege and are thus sat
isfied with conversations that many
times present no new information,
to the same old faces that always
engage in these conversations.
Consequently, we revel in our suc
cess while we are poor in change,
poor in action and poor in dedica
tion to the issues that could ruin
this century.
Many talk big and act small.
I am afraid that this generation
will stagnate and ultimately
regress by resting complacently
upon the literature and legacies of
the many 20th-century leaders who
actually acted upon their beliefs
after spending nights discussing
the crippling issues that pervaded
society.
