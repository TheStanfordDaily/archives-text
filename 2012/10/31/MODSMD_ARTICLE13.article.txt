# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Keep it casual 
### Renée Donovan 
Being a senior in high school is
like being the tallest building
in Daly City. So a wise high
school teacher told me. You're a
pretty big deal at 18 years old with
an acceptance letter to Stanford.
Then you show up here and you are
unequivocally, irrevocably average.
What once seemed like worldly,
unique accomplishments take on a
more provincial nature. You scored
2200 on your SATs? That's accept
able. You were class president?
That's cute. The bottom line is that
you got into Stanford ... and so did
everyone else here.
I notice a common strategy for
dealing with feeling average.
Students do not try, as you might
expect, to stand out. If everyone
here is successful, success is not
enough. You realize quickly that on
this campus, there will always be
someone smarter, funnier or pretti
er than you. Instead, students cope
with their average standing by try
ing to give off the impression that
they aren't trying.
There is a high premium on
casual. Casual greetings, casual
responses, casual sex. Implicit in
formality is a level of effort that
students avoid like the plague. If

you reveal how many hours you
studied for an exam, you expose
your ordinariness. And God forbid
you get caught pursuing someone
romantically. You wouldn't want to
concede that it is in fact difficult for
you to get somebody's attention.
School is easy, hookups "just hap
pen" and success falls from the sky.
There are two primary dangers
when everything is casual. For one,
the pressure to keep calm and
carry on can ironically make stu
dents crack. It is maddening to put
on a circus show of apathy and ease
when there is a very frustrated per
son backstage who cares so much
and tries so hard. Secondly, the pre
mium on keeping your cool breeds
disrespect. When you preemptively
ignore someone so that they have to
make the effort to say hello, you are
being disrespectful. When you
exclusively communicate via text
message, you are copping out. I see
(and experience) plenty of compas
sionate interactions at Stanford,
but I also notice plenty that are dis
respectful or plain indecent. What
results is a culture whose dogma is
to keep it casual and whose motto is
"chill out, man."

Besides engendering disrespect

and unnecessary stress, keeping
your cool limits you to a narrow
range of emotions. When you admit
that you care about someone or
something, the stakes are higher.
High stakes make failure more dev
astating and success more honest.
When you deny that you care about
anything, you mute your feelings
towards everything. You feel less
disappointment and also less
excitement. You end up with a posi
tive feedback loop that transforms
feigned apathy into real apathy.
Breaking the loop is no easy
task. It starts with compassion
towards yourself and others
something I'm still working on.
Check yourself when you start to
feel cynical or jaded. Try to replace
judgment with curiosity. Treat your
peers with respect and decency,
even if people mock you for being
overly polite. Most of all, don't be
afraid to commit to something that
you care about, and to show that
you care. You may not be the tallest
building, but you made it out of
Daly City.
