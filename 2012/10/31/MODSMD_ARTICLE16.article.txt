## Stanford fourth at Cypress 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
As one of eight teams
participating in the Stanford
Classic, Patrick Rodgers,
Cameron Wilson and the
rest of the No. 19 Cardinal
had an opportunity to do
what Tiger Woods, Rory
Mcllroy or most of the
world's best golfers never

did: compete at the Cypress
Point Club.
While Stanford's dreams
of taking the team title faded
in the face of a red-hot Texas
squad on Ihesday, the chance
to play competitive rounds on
the No. 2 course in Golf
Magazine's 2011 Best Courses
in America was certainly a
thrill and great opportunity
for the team.
From 1947 until 1991,

Cypress Point was one of the
three courses used in the
Crosby/AT&T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am. But after
being dropped from the
AT&T Pro-Am rotation in
1991, only member events
have been held on the course
famed for its finishing holes
along the Pacific Ocean.
Seeded seventh in the
eight-team event, Stanford
took advantage of those
holes during Monday's first
round match against No. 2
seed Washington. In cold and
wet conditions, the Cardinal
beat the Huskies 10-2 in the
four-ball format that saw
three two-man teams from
each side compete in head
to-head matchups.
Junior Cameron Wilson
returned from an early
injury and freshman
David Boote led the charge,
capturing six of the team's
total points.
But in round two of the
championship bracket,
Stanford ran into No. 10
Duke. Sophomore Patrick
Rodgers and junior Shane
Lebow shutout their oppo
nent in the single ball, alter
nating shot format. Wilson
and Boote could only earn
half a point and senior Steve
Kearney and freshman
Dominick Francks were
shutout as the Blue Devils
took the match 7.5-4.5.
That put Duke through to
the championship match
against No. 9 UCLA, and the
Cardinal into the consolation
final against No. 2 Texas on
Tuesday.
The Longhorns, led by
Jordan Spieth, put together
an impressive performance
in the individual match play

pairings. The six one-man
"teams" from each school
had four points up for grabs:
two points to the winner of
the 18 holes, one point for
winning the front and back
nines.
Wilson had little trouble
dispatching Texas' Julio
Vegas, earning all four avail
able points. Boote, too, con
tinued his strong play of late
and captured three points
from the Longhorns Kramer
Kickok.
But Lebow took only one
point from Toni Hakula,
Rodgers managed just half a
point against Spieth, and
Kearney and Francks were
both shut out as Texas won
the match 15.5- 8.5.
In the championship
match, UCLA stayed hot
and took the team title with
a dominating 18-6 victory
over Duke.
Stanford still has one
tournament left in the fall
season, breaking out the
clubs for the Gifford
Intercollegiate at CordeValle
next week before a three
month layoff until the
spring season begins in
earnest at the Amer Ari
Invitational from Kona,
Hawaii.
