## Haas Center seeks to address gender gap Females participate more in public service

Jared Naimark 'l4 is the male president of
what has for a long time been a predominantly
female association. STAND, a student coalition
against genocide, is one of the many groups
that offer students the opportunity to get
involved in public service. And like most public
service organizations on campus, gender imbal
ance is the norm.

Take a look at any public service group and
you'll notice the startling gender disparity.
Thomas Schnaubelt, executive director of the
Haas Center for Public Service, has worked in
more than 36 civic engagement institutions. He
confirmed that the phenomenon of female pub
lic engagement tramping male participation is
not limited to Stanford, saying that some
research has shown the typical ratio for male to
female participation in public service is approx
imately 3 to 7.
But just because this phenomenon is quan
tifiable does not mean it's explainable. For
years the Haas Center has not only been trying
to find ways of increasing male participation in
public service, but also attempting to shed light
on the roots of this gender gap.
Naimark proposed a "self-perpetuating
cycle" in which women are drawn to public
service.

"While lots of people come to our initial
meetings, women are much more likely than
men to maintain the commitment and become

active members," Naimark said. "I think that
when people look to get involved in public
engagement activities, they are also looking for
a community, and seeing lots of women already
involved... sends off the signal to men of [public
service] being a more feminine occupation."
Naimark questioned whether the gender
gap is an issue of time and priority, rather than
"lack of interest." He believes that women are
more likely to prioritize public service.
"You won't hear [men] saying they think
public service is stupid," Naimark said. "They
do believe in it. However, they are much more
likely to cite study, sports, work and general
lack of time as excuses for not being part of
public service."

In STAND as well as in other student
organizations, the gender disparity has not
gone unnoticed. A project pioneered by Haas
Center faculty co-director Larry Diamond '73
M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO is currently examining this
trend on the American undergraduate level
with the help of doctoral students in education
and sociology.
The Haas Center has also attempted to
close the widening gender gap, particularly tar
geting students in "male-dominated" areas,
such as engineering and computer science,
according to Schnaubelt. For example, Code
the Change is a program founded and directed
by Sam King 'l2 M.S. 'l3 that allows students to
use their programming and design skills for
social change in areas like public health, democ

racy and governance, education, and entrepre
neurship.
"Sam is a brilliant young computer scientist
who sees his role of doing good in the world and
is very much connected to public service,"
Schnaubelt said. "He's the kind of role model
who could potentially influence young people,
and we are working with people like Sam to find
touch points in different parts of university."
As director of Student Development and
Leadership Programs at the Haas Center,

Kristina Lobo is also looking forward to inves
tigating the gender trend in public service on
campus. She has made efforts to increase the
number of male participants in Haas Center
programs.

"We have always worked hard to get men
into our programs, but this year we're making
an even greater effort than we ever have
before, because the numbers are so glaringly

Jared Naimark '14 is the male president of STAND, a student coalition against genocide.
He believes that the low representation of males in public service on campus is the result
of a "self-perpetuating cycle" of female involvement and a difference in gender priorities.
