# CAMPUS LIFE
## Stanford's spooky history 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has a darker history
that its palm trees and mission-style
arcades suggest. From a string of
unsolved murders in the 1970s to
rumors that the idea for the
University came during a seance,
the campus has its fair share of
encounters with the eerie and the
supernatural. In honor of
Halloween, The Daily takes a look at
some of the spookier, gloomier and
scarier moments of Stanford's histo
ry.
Cult murder in MemChu
On Oct. 12, 1974, Steve
Crawford of the Stanford Police
Department closed and locked all
the doors to Memorial Church. But
when he returned in the morning,
Crawford would discover not only
an unlocked door, but also the
corpse of Arlis Perry, who lay nude
from the waist down, violated with
a candlestick, near the altar of the
church.
The homicide of Arlis Perry, a 19-
year-old from Bismarck, N.D., who
had just been married to sophomore
premedical student Bruce Perry,
has remained one of the most endur
ing mysteries of the Stanford cam
pus.
The day after the crime, investi
gating officers said there was no evi
dence to link Arlis's murder with
four other slayings that had
occurred during the past year and a
half ("Police Find No Evidence To
Link Campus Killings," Oct. 14,
1974). One of those murders the
death of physics student David S.
Levine, who was stabbed to death
between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on Sept.
11,1973, while walking near Meyer
Library was believed to have
been the work of a satanic cult called
Death Angels.
Two days after the murder, a
Santa Clara County spokesperson
told The Daily that the case was
"definitely a sex crime," but that
there was no evidence of a "ritualis
tic 'black mass' slaying" ("No
Suspects Yet in Murder Case," Oct. 15,1974).
Husband Bruce Perry emerged as the pri
mary suspect for a short time, but was ruled
out, according to a 2004 San Jose Mercury
News article. In June 2012, The Great Plains
Examiner published an article suggesting
that a secret cult called The Process Church
may have been responsible.

Ghost in Tresidder Memorial Union
Those who work at Tresidder Memorial
Union have long held that the site is haunted,
according to Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
operations and student unions.
When opened in 1962, Tresidder was the
home of a 14-lane bowling alley, which was
located in the southwest corner of the build
ing. While the University eventually closed
the alley down in the 1980s when it no longer
became profitable, campus legend has it that
one of the facility's maintenance workers con
tinues to haunt the grounds after being man
gled by the pin machine.

"People come out of there running some
times," said Howard Konrad, who has been a
barber at Stanford Hair for the past 28 years.
"I've seen it happen three or four times."
According to fellow hair stylist Marjorie
Guidry, Jamba Juice workers along with
one of her co-workers' dog often refuse to
enter a narrow corridor leading to the storage
room, which currently occupies the space
where the bowling alley once was.

Seances with Jane Stanford
In an 1891 statement, Jane Stanford
rejected the notion that the decision to found
Stanford came during an seance, according to
a Stanford Magazine article published in 2000.
Earlier that year, Maud Lord Drake had
claimed that she was the medium that brought
Jane and Leland Stanford the supernatural
revelation that they should establish a univer
sity.
Despite her protests, there exists confir
mation that the Stanfords attended seances in
Paris after the death of their son. They also
attended a seance in New York City in 1884
with their friends, former U.S. President
Ulysses S. Grant and his wife.
Death of Mausoleum Watchman
The current site of the Stanford family
mausoleum was initially intended as the site
of their Palo Alto country home until the
unexpected death of Leland Stanford Jr. in
1884.
Ten years later, a watchman died in the
guardhouse overlooking the mausoleum,
prompting The Daily Palo Alto (now The
Stanford Daily) to run an article stating that the
"successor to new guard is superstitious." Judy
Adams, a librarian at the University Archives,
told The Daily in 1986 that she "remembered a
day when she wanted to have a picnic on the
lawn in front of the mausoleum" only to have a
friend warn her that there were rumors of a
"man who jumped from the bushes near the
mausoleum with a knife." ("Stanford tomb alive
with mystery," Oct. 31,1986).
