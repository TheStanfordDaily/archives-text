## Hennessy on failed NYC bid 
### Billy Gallagher 
Stanford University President John
Hennessy sat down with The Stanford
Daily on Oct. 29 to discuss a wide
range of topics, including online educa
tion, Stanford's failed campaign for a
New York City campus last fall, Stanford's
fundraising prowess and more.
This is the second of four installments of that
interview; this one focuses on Stanford's failed
attempt in 2011 to win New York City's compe
tition for an applied sciences and engineering
campus. Cornell University won the competi
tion and will build a campus on Roosevelt
Island.
TSD: Sort of tangentially related to [online edu
cation] is the New York City campus. When you
talk about satellite campuses, is that something
that the school is very focused on?
JH: We're not right now. The New York City sit
uation was rather unique in the sense that it
was a location in the world where we could
imagine recruiting faculty and where we would
imagine students would want to go. It's harder
to find other places where it's just as easy to
recruit faculty.
There are lots of people who would like us to
set up things, but the key thing is... if you can't
recruit faculty, and the veiy best faculty, then
you're going to have something which is not of a

University President John Hennessy, above addressing parents last February, says that he
"pulled the plug" on Stanford's bid for a NYC applied science campus in 2011 because
the city was dumping too much risk on the University without additional compensation.
Stanford caliber and I think
there's no interest in doing
that, in taking the
University's brand and, in
some sense, diluting it by hav
ing something that's less,
lower quality.

TSD: So if Stanford were to
do a second campus in the
future, do you think New York
would still be the first choice?
JH: I think it might well be...
we'll see what happens in the
city's trajectory in the next
few years ahead as the person
who's been mayor for 12 years
will be stepping down and
that... will certainly be a
change in the city. How big of
a change? That's unclear, I
think. So New York comes
with the advantage of being a
magnet for highly talented
people and intellectuals. It
comes with the disadvantages
that it's a very hard place to
do business. Very expensive. I
found a place that's more
expensive than building on
our campus, and that's New
York City... that's its down
side and that has to balance
against the [positives].
My guess is for the next
few years, we'll be asking
questions about how we use
online, because I think we're
already in the best place in the
world we could possibly be.
It's right here. So, a question
is, "Can we use online to
amplify what we can do on
campus? And are there ways
to do it that would still provide
students with an opportunity
to be on our campus but
maybe use online to magnify
that effect somehow?" We'll
see.
TSD: Looking back on this
process, a year removed, and
looking back a little more
deeply on New York, are
there any regrets you have on
the Stanford end of things or
on the way New York or
Cornell handled things?

we found ourselves in negoti
ating a deal. I mean, perhaps
we could have figured it out
sooner. But I'm not sure of
that. It was a very hard thing
to ascertain.

Other than that, I think the
other thing, probably, is the
cost hurdles for the project
grew significantly from the
first impressions of them.
And, again, this project ran on
at race neck speed for a
University project. It was run
ning much faster than any
thing we've ever done before.
So in some sense, I don't know
how we could have figured out,
for example, that the cost to
activate Roosevelt Island and
bring it to the place where you
had done the infrastructure
and you were ready to build
the first building was three
times higher than we initially
estimated. I don't know how
you could have figured that
out faster, but it certainly
would have been nice if we
could have figured that out
faster. Because that would
have said the hurdle was high
er and maybe we would have
then said, "The hurdle's high
er, we need to have a different
set of terms under which
we're negotiating this deal
given that." What that would
have done, if anything, was it
would have probably raised
some objections earlier before
we got into the final negotia
tion process and maybe we
could have cut bait sooner. I'm
not sure, but it's worth asking.
I don't think there's any
thing else that I wanted there.
I thought we should win the
process on the basis of the
merits of our proposal and our
willingness to invest in it. I
didn't think conducting a
political campaign was the
right thing. And I don't think,
in the end, it was the big issue
anyway. But, anyway, it's an
interesting process to go
through.

JH: You know, perhaps we
could have figured out or
detected some things earlier
than we did that we didn't
figure out or detect until we
got into final negotiations. But
I'm not sure because it's very
hard to separate out the
dynamics of what was going
on from the details of where

TSD: It seemed at least, from

an outsider's perspective, like
the University had a lot of
momentum going and had
done a ton of work on this pro
posal and then very abruptly
withdrew. Was there one term
that came up that caused that
or was it just sort of eventual
ly, you met with other people
and decided?

JH: Well, the straw that broke
the camel's back I suppose, in
the end, it was just there were
too many conditions imposed
on the project and I think it
just got to the point where the
University was being asked to
carry the lion's share of risk.
The city was dumping risk on
the University and wasn't giv
ing us anything in return. It's
not like they were saying,
"Okay, we're going to give you
more land or we're going to
give you more money. No, you
take all the risk and if it fails,
even if it's our fault, you pay
us." I mean ...that was just
crazy.

50... I had told the Board
if we didn't get a deal we liked,
I was going to pull the plug.
So, the team was back there
negotiating, I was getting
daily reports on that and I
just said, "This is going the
wrong way." And we realized
that, that was the team we
were going to have to work
with for the next decade-plus
if we went ahead with the
project. I just said, "This is
not a partnership between a
nonprofit that's investing far
more than the city, I mean five
to 10 times over 20, 30 years
what the city was going to
invest." So, I just said and I
told the Trustees if it was
n't a good deal, I'll pull the
plug. And they were nervous I
wasn't going to pull the plug
but I did.

Tomorrow's installment will
focus on Stanford's fundrais
ing success and uses of that
numey.

I didn't think conducting
a political campaign
was the right thing.

University president, on failed NYC bid
