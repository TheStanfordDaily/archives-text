# ELECTION 2012
## Campus student groups gear up for election day 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Campus political groups have been accelerat
ing their get-out-the-vote and canvassing
efforts, rallying supporters both on campus and
out of state. Nearing the final week of the cam
paign, both the Stanford College Republicans
and Stanford Democrats have sent students on
canvassing trips in Nevada and are seeing
increased enthusiasm as the Nov. 6 election
draws nearer.

Because California is not going to be a com
petitive state in the presidential race, campus
political groups have focused on phone banking
to mobilize support elsewhere.
According to Nick Ahamed 'l5, a neighbor
hood team leader for President Obama's grass
roots campaign, a group of about 50 Stanford
Democrats have made around 18,000 phone calls
to swing states for the November elections. The
past two weekends, the Democrats have been
calling from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. asking voters to sup
port the president.

The Stanford College Republicans are phone
banking as well, but have no information about
how many Stanford students have been calling
on behalf of Mitt Romney. Rather, the College
Republicans connect interested students direct
ly with campaigns, according to President Mary
Ann Toman-Miller 'l3.

Both political groups have their eyes on near
by Nevada, whose six electoral votes are impor
tant for both candidates' White House aspira
tions. A group of Democrats spent the week
end working with Obama's field office in
Reno and will be returning this weekend.
Ahamed estimates 30 students will be going
to Reno with the Democrats on Friday.
Stanford Republicans have also facilitat
ed volunteering with the Romney ground
operation in Nevada. According to Winston
Chang 'l4, vice-president of the College
Republicans, around 15 students traveled to
Nevada last weekend and the same number
will be campaigning for the Republican can
didate this coming weekend.
While the top of the ticket is the focus for
both groups' campaigns, Stanford students
have also been active in other races.
Members of the Stanford Democrats have
travelled to Stockton, Calif, to support the
city council campaign of Michael Tubbs 'l2
and organized people to phone bank for him.
According to Lamont, it is easier to get
students energized for the presidential con
test than for down-ballot races or referenda.

"At Stanford, the majority of students are
not from California," she said. "It's a lot eas
ier to get people involved with the presiden
tial election than with state-specific issues."
On campus, both the Stanford Democrats
and College Republicans have been using
policy events to engage the student body.
"We are trying to engage [students]
through the issues by inviting speakers to
address election topics on campus," said
Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of the
Stanford Democrats. Last week the
Democrats co-hosted a dinner and discussion
with Lupe Rodriguez, director of public affairs
for Planned Parenthood San Mateo. Political
Science Professor Gary Segura addressed the
group Monday about the impact of the Latino
vote.

The Stanford Review sponsored an event
featuring the Libertarian vice presidential candi
date Jim Gray on Oct. 25 at the Graduate School
of Business. The College Republicans hosted
Bob Inglis, a former South Carolina congress
man, who discussed environmental issues on
Oct. 10. Difficulties in scheduling guests have
hampered some of their event plans.
"Unfortunately [a lot of] Stanford profes
sors are out travelling around the United
States," Chang said.
So far in the campaign, political groups

have taken a low-key approach to rallying
support. While, according to Toman-Miller,
the College Republicans continue relying on
"word-of-mouth," the Democrats are ramp
ing up their presence on campus in the week
leading up to the election. They will be host
ing a rally in White Plaza Nov. 2 in an
attempt to revive the enthusiasm voters felt
for Obama four years ago.
"[2ooB] was a lot more exciting of an elec
tion," Ahamed said. "I don't know the num
bers, but [supporters in 2008] were doing
two or three times the number of calls we're
doing now... some students feel frustrated
with Obama."
As the election nears, a sense of urgency
has descended upon Democratic supporters,
who logged 2,700 phone calls to voters last
Thursday night alone, more than the entire
quarter last spring.
Political organizations on the right are
also sensing more urgency as Romney's poll
numbers have improved in the closing weeks
of the campaign. Conservatives are confident
that students will turn out to support Mitt
Romney.
"There's a lot more enthusiasm behind
Romney than there was during the 2008 cam
paign, or even in 2010," said Kyle Huwa'l3,
president of the Stanford Conservative Society.
According to Chang, the mission of the
College Republicans to translate that enthu
siasm into increased turnout for conserva
tive candidates.
"We get those people who are registered
Republicans, who want to work on the cam
paign, [and] help them support Romney," he
said. "That's our purpose."

Democrats have made around 18,000 phone calls
to swing states for the November elections. The
past two weekends, the Democrats have been
calling from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. asking voters to sup
port the president.

The Stanford College Republicans are phone
banking as well, but have no information about
how many Stanford students have been calling
on behalf of Mitt Romney. Rather, the College
Republicans connect interested students direct
ly with campaigns, according to President Mary
Ann Toman-Miller 'l3.

Both political groups have their eyes on near
by Nevada, whose six electoral votes are impor
tant for both candidates' White House aspira
tions. A group of Democrats spent the week
end working with Obama's field office in
Reno and will be returning this weekend.
Ahamed estimates 30 students will be going
to Reno with the Democrats on Friday.
Stanford Republicans have also facilitat
ed volunteering with the Romney ground
operation in Nevada. According to Winston
Chang 'l4, vice-president of the College
Republicans, around 15 students traveled to
Nevada last weekend and the same number
will be campaigning for the Republican can
didate this coming weekend.
While the top of the ticket is the focus for
both groups' campaigns, Stanford students
have also been active in other races.
Members of the Stanford Democrats have
travelled to Stockton, Calif, to support the
city council campaign of Michael Tubbs 'l2
and organized people to phone bank for him.
According to Lamont, it is easier to get
students energized for the presidential con
test than for down-ballot races or referenda.

"At Stanford, the majority of students are
not from California," she said. "It's a lot eas
ier to get people involved with the presiden
tial election than with state-specific issues."
On campus, both the Stanford Democrats
and College Republicans have been using
policy events to engage the student body.
"We are trying to engage [students]
through the issues by inviting speakers to
address election topics on campus," said
Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of the
Stanford Democrats. Last week the
Democrats co-hosted a dinner and discussion
with Lupe Rodriguez, director of public affairs
for Planned Parenthood San Mateo. Political
Science Professor Gary Segura addressed the
group Monday about the impact of the Latino
vote.

The Stanford Review sponsored an event
featuring the Libertarian vice presidential candi
date Jim Gray on Oct. 25 at the Graduate School
of Business. The College Republicans hosted
Bob Inglis, a former South Carolina congress
man, who discussed environmental issues on
Oct. 10. Difficulties in scheduling guests have
hampered some of their event plans.
"Unfortunately [a lot of] Stanford profes
sors are out travelling around the United
States," Chang said.
So far in the campaign, political groups

have taken a low-key approach to rallying
support. While, according to Toman-Miller,
the College Republicans continue relying on
"word-of-mouth," the Democrats are ramp
ing up their presence on campus in the week
leading up to the election. They will be host
ing a rally in White Plaza Nov. 2 in an
attempt to revive the enthusiasm voters felt
for Obama four years ago.
"[2ooB] was a lot more exciting of an elec
tion," Ahamed said. "I don't know the num
bers, but [supporters in 2008] were doing
two or three times the number of calls we're
doing now... some students feel frustrated
with Obama."
As the election nears, a sense of urgency
has descended upon Democratic supporters,
who logged 2,700 phone calls to voters last
Thursday night alone, more than the entire
quarter last spring.
Political organizations on the right are
also sensing more urgency as Romney's poll
numbers have improved in the closing weeks
of the campaign. Conservatives are confident
that students will turn out to support Mitt
Romney.
"There's a lot more enthusiasm behind
Romney than there was during the 2008 cam
paign, or even in 2010," said Kyle Huwa'l3,
president of the Stanford Conservative Society.
According to Chang, the mission of the
College Republicans to translate that enthu
siasm into increased turnout for conserva
tive candidates.
"We get those people who are registered
Republicans, who want to work on the cam
paign, [and] help them support Romney," he
said. "That's our purpose."

Campus political groups have been accelerat
ing their get-out-the-vote and canvassing
efforts, rallying supporters both on campus and
out of state. Nearing the final week of the cam
paign, both the Stanford College Republicans
and Stanford Democrats have sent students on
canvassing trips in Nevada and are seeing
increased enthusiasm as the Nov. 6 election
draws nearer.

Because California is not going to be a com
petitive state in the presidential race, campus
political groups have focused on phone banking
to mobilize support elsewhere.
