## Senate forms committee to study sexual assault policy 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
Following last week's town halls about the
Alternative Review Process (ARP), the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate created a judi
cial review committee to study the sexual
assault and harassment policy. According to
Administration and Rules Committee Chair
Lauren Miller 'l5, the Senate will likely not
have a decision on the ARP until the end of
this fall quarter.

"I don't want to say [what our timeline is]
because we haven't started yet," she said.
"But [approval from the Undergraduate
Senate] will be the part that happens at the
beginning of winter quarter."
The newly formed committee will gather
information and student feedback about the
ARP to present to the Senate. The Senate
will then author a bill regarding the ARP
that will eventually be sent to the Faculty
Senate, where the final decision on the ARP
will be made.

Senators Daniela Olivos 'l5, Brandon
Hightower 'l5, Garima Sharma 'l5, Kimberly
Bacon 'l5 and Viraj Binda 'l5 joined Miller in
volunteering to serve on the committee.
"It is hard for all 14 of us to be super
knowledgeable about the proposed judicial
change, so [the committee] is supposed to be
away for a few of us to get really involved
and help inform the rest of the Senate and
make better decisions as a result," Miller
said. She says she expects the faculty senate
to come to a decision on the ARP before
spring quarter.

Additionally, Senator Janhavi Vartak 'l5
was absent at this week's meeting, which was
her third absence of the quarter. According
to Article II of the Senate's bylaws, a bill for
her expulsion must be drawn.

Miller said that the bill will be put on pre
vious notice next week and will be proposed
to the Senate the following week, though the
Senate does not have to vote on the bill.
Miller said she could not predict the result if
the Senate did decide to vote.
"I'm not sure what each individual senator
is going to do, but we are obviously going to
have a serious conversation with the person
who has been missing meetings," Miller said.
"We want to help them and make sure they
can give their full contribution to the
Senate."

Ashley Harris 'l5 was automatically
expelled from the Senate earlier this year for
taking a medical leave of absence. Because
Harris has not been replaced, the Senate
only has 14 members. Bacon reminded sena
tors of the attendance policy at the end of the
meeting, and told them that any excused
absences need to be cleared by the chair or
the deputy chair 24 hours before the meeting.
"Especially since we only have 14 people,
it is really important that we have enough
people to vote and have quorum and have
meetings," Bacon said.

Executive Cabinet candidates Kaela
Farrise 'l4, Norian Watson 'l3 and Michelle
Pan 'l5 were present to answer questions
from senators about their roles in the cabinet
before the Senate approved their appoint
ments. Although Anjney Midha 'l5, the
fourth cabinet member, was unable to attend,
the Senate unanimously approved the bill.
Senators also approved $9,335.14 in fund
ing bills for student organizations, of which
$4,900 was for the Stanford Transhumanist
Association.
