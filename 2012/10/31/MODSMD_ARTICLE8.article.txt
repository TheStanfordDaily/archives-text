## Optimistic in the face of Oregon 
### George Chen 
It's always hard for me to not be
a pessimistic sports fan. When
the Patriots met the Giants in
last year's Super Bowl, I had
the uneasy feeling that the Pats
would fall to their nemesis again.
After all, is there any quarterback in
the NFL that has out-clutched Tom
Brady like Eli Manning has?
I was right. In what was the sequel
to the 2008 nightmare, Manning once
again engineered a game-winning
drive to give the G-men their second
Lombardi Trophy in four years.

When the Celtics took a 3-2 series
lead over the Heat in last year's
Eastern Conference Finals, I knew it
was only a matter of time before
Le√üron James would singlehandedly
find away to beat us.
I was right again. Silencing every
critic for good, the Michael Jordan of
this generation brought Boston's Big
Three era to a disappointing end.
Don't get me wrong, I rooted for
the Pats and the Celtics, hoping that
they would be able pull it off. Being
pessimistic doesn't mean that you
don't cheer for your teams as passion
ately as the next guy. But, as I'm sure
many of you sports fans would agree,
you can't help but think in the back of
your mind that everything that can go
wrong with your teams will go wrong.
That being said, what do I think of
Stanford's chances of making it to the
Rose Bowl? There's still four games
left, but it's never too early to try to
predict where the team will land in the
postseason.
To begin with, at this point of the
season there are two ways that the
Cardinal can reach "The Granddaddy
of Them All." Option A is straightfor
ward: win out and beat whomever it
faces in the Pac-12 Championship.
Option B is a bit more complicated:
win the rest of its games except for
Oregon and then hope that the Ducks
go to the national championship and
that the BCS has us in the top 14.
Needless to say both roads are
daunting and bumpy.
When it comes to describing what
Option A entails, there's no phrase
that's more appropriate than "control
ling one's own destiny." If Stanford
doesn't lose another game for the rest
of the season, a Rose Bowl berth
would virtually be guaranteed.
But that's a huge "if." Beating
Oregon State at home is tough enough,
and defeating the Pac-12 South winner
in the conference championship won't
be a cakewalk either, but the biggest
challenge will undoubtedly be upset
ting Oregon in Autzen.
On paper, the Stanford-Oregon
matchup is almost comical. We're talk
ing about the team that came down to
the Farm last season to completely
whoop and demoralize an Andrew
Luck-led Stanford. What's scary is
that this year's Ducks might be even
better. Sure, Darren Thomas and
LaMichael James are gone, but the
flashy duo of Kenjon Barner and
De' Anthony Thomas would have even
Alabama's defense shaking in its boots.
How does rookie quarterback Josh
Nunes, who has played dismally on the
road, stand any chance in front of the
loudest 59,000 fans in the country?
So at first glance, Option B seems
to be the easier path. It looks tempt
ing because while Stanford would still
have to beat Oregon State and
UCLA, it wouldn't need to concern
itself with knocking off Oregon or
beat the Pac-12 South champion. (If
it's USC, Matt Barkley would proba
bly rather quit football than lose to us
for the fifth straight time.)
But there's a small problem. At
the end of the regular season,
Stanford needs to be in the top 14 in
the BCS standings to be eligible for
the Rose Bowl. The Cardinal is cur
rently 14th right now and with a win
over Oregon State in two weeks, it
could potentially leap into the top ten.
But when it loses to Oregon, it'll most
likely fall out of the top 15, and a win
over UCLA in the last game of the
season probably won't make up
enough ground. I can't really justify a
three-loss team, even if it is Stanford,
being in the top 14.
Maybe things would be different if
the Oregon game was scheduled ear
lier in the year, but having to play
against the Ducks in the second-to
last game of the season doesn't give
Stanford any opportunity to re-climb
up the rankings. I also think that a big
reason why we're in the top 14 right
now is because we went toe-to-toe
with Notre Dame, so this is one of the
few times we can be thankful of the
fact that the overrated Irish is the
BCS's golden boy. But that also
means that if the Irish were to slip in
any of its remaining games, we would
take a hit in the rankings as
well.

No team wants its fate to
be decided by voters.
Especially not by BCS voters.
In that case, the most realistic
scenario for Stanford to make
the Rose Bowl is through
Option A, which involves beat
ing Oregon.
Fitting enough, isn't it?
Two years ago, Oregon was
our only loss of the season and
it cost a trip to Pasadena. A
season ago, Oregon burned
our national title hopes to the
ground. And this year, it's
Oregon once again that stands
between us and the Rose Bowl.

Talk about being an obstacle.
If you asked me what I
think the chances are that
Stanford reaches the Rose
Bowl, I would truthfully say
around 10 percent. Maybe 15
percent at the most.
As pessimistic as I can be, I
believe in our chances.

It might not make a lot of
sense considering that the
chances of the Patriots beating
the Giants in the Super Bowl
or the Celtics eliminating the
Heat in the Eastern
Conference Finals were a lot
higher than the chance of
Stanford making it to the Rose
Bowl.

But for me, there's some
thing different about rooting
for Stanford sports. The pes
simist side of me magically
turns off. Maybe it's the result
of being both a Stanford stu

dent and fan. Maybe it's
because I think making it to
the Rose Bowl with a quarter
back named Josh Nunes would
be the most epic story ever. Or
maybe it's just because I'm
foolish enough to think that
being optimistic will lead to
good things.
I'm not quite sure, but
whatever the reason, it's good
enough for me to be optimistic
about Stanford athletics.

Roses in January. That
doesn't sound too bad.

George Chen is feeling so
optimistic about Stanford's
chances that he's already
planning a road trip down to
Los Angeles and try ing to get
tickets for the Rose Bowl,
