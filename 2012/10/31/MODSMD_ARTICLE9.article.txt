# NORPAC UP NEXT
## CARD IN POSTSEASON 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite the damage left along the
East Coast by Hurricane Sandy, the
Stanford women's field hockey team
hopes to remain in Earmville, Va.
through next week. An earlier
return would mean that the season
has ended for the No. 13 Cardinal.
After closing out the regular sea
son with a 2-0 win over Cal last week
end, it is now officially win-or-go-home
time for the squad. In order to make
the NCAA tournament, Stanford (12-
6, 6-0 NorPac) needs to win the
NorPac conference tournament and
then a neutral site play-in game.
Stanford enters the tournament
unbeaten within the NorPac and
holding the number one seed in the
West Division.
But as Stanford knows all too
well, regular season success does not
guarantee postseason titles. Last
season, the Cardinal was also unde
feated in conference play until falling
to Cal 1-0 in the NorPac champi
onship game.
The path begins with a matchup
against East Division No. 4 seed
Radford. The Highlanders enter the
game with a 2-17 overall record, with
both wins coming against NorPac
cellar-dweller Appalachian State.
Stanford handed Radford one of
their losses on Sept. 22 in Chapel
Hill, North Carolina when the
Cardinal defeated the Highlanders
2-0 behind goals from freshmen
Lauren Becker and Jessica
Chisholm.
Unlike last year*, when the tour
nament was held within the friendly
confines of the Varsity Thrf, this sea
son the Cardinal has to fly across the
country for the postseason. It
remains to be seen how the long
flight will affect the squad, since

Stanford has struggled somewhat on
the road this year four of its six
losses have come away from home.

The Cardinal will look to senior
captain Becky Din to continue carry
ing the scoring load. Dru has record
ed nine goals and eight assists for 26
points this season and the 2011 Ail-
American defender would like to
extend her Stanford career as long as
possible.

Behind Dm, Stanford has seen
scoring from a variety of sources.
Junior attacker Hope Burke (15
points on the season) and freshman

midfielder Maddie Secco (13 points)
will be counted upon to support the
attack. The Cardinal will also be look
ing to junior attacker Courtney
Haldeman (eight goals) to provide a
spark off the bench.
At the other end of the field, goal
keeper Dulcie Davies is currently sec
ond in the conference in goals against
average with a 1.58 mark. The fresh
man has started all 18 games this
season and recorded five shutouts.

If the Cardinal advances, it will
continue a tough streak of three
games in three days. The winner of

the Stanford-Radford game will take
on the winner of the Longwood-
California game on Friday. The
NorPac championship game is sched
uled for Saturday afternoon.

If Stanford wins the NorPac
championship, the NCAA play-in
game would be held in Farmville on
Nov. 6. The Cardinal has qualified for
the NCAA tournament for the past
three years but has never advanced
past the first round.
