# NOW OR NEVER

### ANNA BLUE 
When senior Adam Jahn's
header found the back of net early
in overtime on Friday night, it sent
several thousand UC-Santa
Barbara fans home disappointed
on Senior Night and the Stanford
men's soccer team back to campus
with a critical upset win over the
No. 25 Gauchos on the road.
Tonight offers a similar oppor
tunity for the Cardinal to replicate
the success of last weekend
against a different team UCLA
and with its playoff chances all
but-guaranteed to be on the line.
Stanford (7-7-1, 3-3-1 Pac-12) is
currently tied for third in the Pac
-12 standings, too far behind con
ference-leading Washington to
make a bid for the title with just
three games remaining, but in
position to put together a strong
case for an at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament with a good
run to end the season.
The Cardinal will need to
impress the selection committee,
however, and tonight's match on
the road against the No. 5 Bruins
(11-2-2, 6-1) provides a great
opportunity to do just that.
After knocking off Washington
on Monday night, the Bruins are
poised to move past the Huskies in
the standings, needing just six
points in the final three matches to
secure their fourth Pac-12 title in
five years.
But Stanford is aiming to make
earning those six points a difficult
task, even if the Bruins have dom
inated the matchup historically.
The Cardinal and Bruins have met
on the soccer field a total of 53
times. While UCLA boasts a strik

ing 40 wins, Stanford has only six
to its name, an intimidating statis
tic that doesn't accurately portray
the intense and competitive histo
ry between the two teams. The
competition came to a head in
2002, in the NCAA Championship
final, when UCLA eked out a win.
Jahn, however, leads an offen
sive attack that is gaining some
momentum after struggling to
score earlier in the season. The El
Macero, Calif, native was named
Pac-12 Men's Soccer Player of the
Week after his third match-winner
of the 2012 campaign in last
Friday's game. Jahn followed in
the footsteps of fellow teammate,
sophomore Zach Batteer, who was
Pac-12 Player of the Week four
weeks ago. The resilient backline
is led by keeper Drew Hutchins,
with an impressive 39 saves this
season.

The momentum of each team,
still high from the exhilaration of
such important wins, will surely
generate fast-paced, aggressive
play from both the Cardinal and
the Bruins. But the quick turnover
for UCLA, compared to Stanford's
extensive recovery time, could be
the deciding factor this Thursday.
Stanford hoes to capitalize on the
tired legs and weariness of the
Bruins' players, especially in the
midfield.
Hutchins will meet his match
this Thursday, when UCLA goal
keeper Earl Edwards takes the
field. Edwards has consistently
managed to shut down attacks by
his opponents, and he leads the
Pac-12 with his .807 save percent
age. Bruins senior midfielder and
captain Ryan Hollingshead,
recently named to the National

Team of the Week, seems to be on
a scoring streak, having scored in
UCLA's last two games against
the Huskies and the Beavers.

UCLA is not invincible, though;
for the 26 total goals they have
scored this season, they have
allowed 15 themselves. Bateer,
with five goals this season, has one
of the best chances of penetrating
UCLA's defense and getting a shot
off, and Jahn is ranked second in
the Pac-12 with 20 individual
points.

Looking for revenge for their
Sept. 29 loss to UCLA, the
Cardinal faces off against the
Bruins at 7 p.m. tonight from
Westwood in a game that will be
broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.
By maintaining their focus and
calm, and by being quick on the
ball, the team can take a big step
toward punching a ticket to the
NCAA Tournament.

With goals at a premium, junior defender Tyler Conklin (25) and the
Stanford defense need to shut down the No. 5 UCLA Bruins' high-powered
offensive attack in order for the Cardinal to have a chance
to score a major upset and potentially grab an NCAA tournament bid.
