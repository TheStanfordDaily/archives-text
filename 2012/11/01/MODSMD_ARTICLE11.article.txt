# Q&A
## Scott Platshon 
### 
After being named an
Ail-American as a high
school senior at Menlo
School, a stone's throw
from Palm Drive, sen
ior Scott Platshon earned the start
ing goalkeeper job this season for
the Stanford men's water polo team.
Platshon allowed just one goal in his
first career start and has No. 3
Stanford set to make a run at a
NCAA Tournament berth when the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament begins on Nov. 23.
Platshon sat down with The
Daily ahead of this weekend's
matches against UC-Davis and
Santa Clara to discuss all things
Stanford, 80s music and water polo.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Let's
start off with a softball. If there
was a top-five most played on
your iPod or on the locker room
iPod, what would be on it?
Scott Platshon (Platshon): It's
funny you ask that, because I'm
actually the DJ every day before
practice. We have a nice Bose
sound system in the locker and I
DJ, which is especially important
before morning practice when we
need to get the morale up. I go
mostly 80s, kind of a lot of Bruce
Springsteen, and a lot of Journey.

And then since I really have to
cater to the whole team, and on
our team trip to Hawaii a song
called "Don't Drop that Dun-Dun-
Dun" became like our team song,
as well as "Let's Do It Again" by J
Boog Those two are when we real
ly need a morale boost before a
6:30 a.m. practice. The team's
looking tired and mad at having to
be there, so you throw that on the
speakers, heads start lifting up,
and you know you're going to
have a good practice.
(TSD): As someone who's been
there and kind of done that in
your fourth year on the Farm, and
especially as the goalie on the
team who anchors the defense,
what is your role as a leader for
the team?
(Platshon): Those are two good
points you bring up. Just by being
the goalie you're kind of thrust
into a leadership position. The
goalie has a special opportunity,
first because you're supposed to
block everything that comes at
you, but also because you have the
ability to block stuff when the
defense kind of messes up, and
save your teammates in away, and
that right there is a morale boost
that can change the whole game.

It's a special position.
Outside of being the goalie, it's
a really long season. We're here
all summer, have three weeks of
intense preseason, and then play
every weekend until December.
So it's really important to strike a
balance between having a ton of
fun at practice and keeping the
mood light but at the same time
staying focused. I've been on
teams in the past, and there were
years [when] we were far too seri
ous and tense. And then water
polo didn't become as fun and the
level of play declined. But there
have been years when we've also
been too goofy. I see myself as
someone who can read the mood,
and if we need to be serious buck
le down, but then also at times
keep things light and fun.
(TSD): Kids don't exactly flock to
water polo. How did you get into
the sport and what was it that
made you want to take it to such a
high level?
(Platshon): My beginning in
water polo comes from my broth
ers, and is kind of also why I'm a
goalie. We have a little pool at my
house, and both my brothers

played. My brother [Kevin]
won two NCAA titles at Cal.
They'd come home from
practice and [want to] shoot,
so they would throw me in
the goal. I couldn't block any
thing for years and years and
years, but then I kind of
learned to play better. And I
always kind of stuck with
goalie. So that was my path
to water polo.

But the reason I love the
sport so much, in the sim
plest terms I can put it, is that
it's just a beautiful combina
tion of the good things offered
in other sports. I love fast
paced sports—l could never
play baseball—and I love that
there's never any down time in
water polo. It's an incredibly
demanding sport and it com
bines everything I loved in the
games I was playing when I
was younger. I loved being in
the water and the fast pace of
basketball, and I ended up
being decently good at water
polo.

(TSD): Where should I go if
I'm looking for a killer meal
at any hour of the day.

(Platshon): Burrito night
on Wednesdays at KA. For
sure. Hmm, I'm trying to
think of any hidden gems I
have. I'll say my go-to study
spot I like to drink coffee
so sometimes I sneak it into
the library from Coupa, but
that's kind of difficult. My
spot is the secret Starbucks.
.. .You get a soup from
Safeway for $1.29, get your
self a coffee and settle down
for two, three hours to crush
some studying.

(TSD): What has been your
favorite experience with
water polo here at Stanford?
(Platshon): My freshman
year I had a pretty special
opportunity to train under
Jimmy Sandman. He was a
fifth-year senior so it was
only for one quarter, but
training with him, just emu
lating what he did in the goal,
and learning his style how
to communicate, how to lead,
how to carry yourself on the
team was an incredible
experience, and I credit that
with a lot of my success right
now.
But one of the most fun
moments I had, I'd have to
say winning NorCals my
freshman year was awesome.
Even though I played zero
minutes in that whole tour
nament, you really feel like
you're part of the team chal
lenging your teammates
every day in practice and
being there. But then also
starting and playing in a big
game for the first time is
awesome. Going to overtime
in my second start ever
against USC was kind of like
what I had been working for
since I was a 12-and-under.
We lost the game but I
wouldn't trade anything for
that experience. I can't wait
to be in that situation again.
That's when I feel like I
thrive and our team thrives
and that's why I play sports.
(TSD): Everyone's asking
this time of year, but do you
have any post-graduation
plans?
(Platshon): I'm trying to go
to medical school at some
point, and I shadowed a doc
tor in the ER two years ago.
That's something I might be

interested in, and they say
they love ex-student athletes
in the ER because it's almost
the same as sports. You have
to deal with a situation as a
team, it's high pressure, high
intensity and it gave me that
same adrenaline you get
playing high-level sports.
(TSD):: OK, you're stranded
on a desert island and you
can spare three books not to
use as kindling. What're you
reading for the next 50
years? (TSD):
(Platshon): This is a tough
one. Let's start with Harry
Potter. And the Hunger
Games.
(TSD): That's like 10 books
right there, Scott.
(Platshon): I can't just take
the whole series? Damn! OK,
then "Bringing Down the
House," by Ben Mezrich.
"Holes," by Louis Sachar.
And if I'm on an island, I
have to have something of
value. "Great Expectations"
a little C-Dickens. When
you're reading the first 50
pages it's kind of boring, but
then you get into it.
(TSD):Last question. What's
the worst thing about spend
ing all of your days in a pool?
(Platshon): Well you're
always pruning and wrinkly.
But there's nothing worse
than coming out of the locker
room in a Speedo when it 45
degrees outside and then
having to jump into a pool
that you think is like 32
degrees.
(TSD): That just sounds ter
rible. Thanks so much Scott.
(Platshon): No, thank you.

lating what he did in the goal,
and learning his style how
to communicate, how to lead,
how to carry yourself on the
team was an incredible
experience, and I credit that
with a lot of my success right
now.
But one of the most fun
moments I had, I'd have to
say winning NorCals my
freshman year was awesome.
Even though I played zero
minutes in that whole tour
nament, you really feel like
you're part of the team chal
lenging your teammates
every day in practice and
being there. But then also
starting and playing in a big
game for the first time is
awesome. Going to overtime
in my second start ever
against USC was kind of like
what I had been working for
since I was a 12-and-under.
We lost the game but I
wouldn't trade anything for
that experience. I can't wait
to be in that situation again.
That's when I feel like I
thrive and our team thrives
and that's why I play sports.
(TSD): Everyone's asking
this time of year, but do you
have any post-graduation
plans?
(Platshon): I'm trying to go
to medical school at some
point, and I shadowed a doc
tor in the ER two years ago.
That's something I might be

interested in, and they say
they love ex-student athletes
in the ER because it's almost
the same as sports. You have
to deal with a situation as a
team, it's high pressure, high
intensity and it gave me that
same adrenaline you get
playing high-level sports.
(TSD):: OK, you're stranded
on a desert island and you
can spare three books not to
use as kindling. What're you
reading for the next 50
years? (TSD):
(Platshon): This is a tough
one. Let's start with Harry
Potter. And the Hunger
Games.
(TSD): That's like 10 books
right there, Scott.
(Platshon): I can't just take
the whole series? Damn! OK,
then "Bringing Down the
House," by Ben Mezrich.
"Holes," by Louis Sachar.
And if I'm on an island, I
have to have something of
value. "Great Expectations"
a little C-Dickens. When
you're reading the first 50
pages it's kind of boring, but
then you get into it.
(TSD):Last question. What's
the worst thing about spend
ing all of your days in a pool?
(Platshon): Well you're
always pruning and wrinkly.
But there's nothing worse
than coming out of the locker
room in a Speedo when it 45
degrees outside and then
having to jump into a pool
that you think is like 32
degrees.
(TSD): That just sounds ter
rible. Thanks so much Scott.
(Platshon): No, thank you.
After being named an
Ail-American as a high
school senior at Menlo
School, a stone's throw
from Palm Drive, sen
ior Scott Platshon earned the start
ing goalkeeper job this season for
the Stanford men's water polo team.
Platshon allowed just one goal in his
first career start and has No. 3
Stanford set to make a run at a
NCAA Tournament berth when the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament begins on Nov. 23.
Platshon sat down with The
Daily ahead of this weekend's
matches against UC-Davis and
Santa Clara to discuss all things
Stanford, 80s music and water polo.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Let's
start off with a softball. If there
was a top-five most played on
your iPod or on the locker room
iPod, what would be on it?
Scott Platshon (Platshon): It's
funny you ask that, because I'm
actually the DJ every day before
practice. We have a nice Bose
sound system in the locker and I
DJ, which is especially important
before morning practice when we
need to get the morale up. I go
mostly 80s, kind of a lot of Bruce
Springsteen, and a lot of Journey.

And then since I really have to
cater to the whole team, and on
our team trip to Hawaii a song
called "Don't Drop that Dun-Dun-
Dun" became like our team song,
as well as "Let's Do It Again" by J
Boog Those two are when we real
ly need a morale boost before a
6:30 a.m. practice. The team's
looking tired and mad at having to
be there, so you throw that on the
speakers, heads start lifting up,
and you know you're going to
have a good practice.
(TSD): As someone who's been
there and kind of done that in
your fourth year on the Farm, and
especially as the goalie on the
team who anchors the defense,
what is your role as a leader for
the team?
(Platshon): Those are two good
points you bring up. Just by being
the goalie you're kind of thrust
into a leadership position. The
goalie has a special opportunity,
first because you're supposed to
block everything that comes at
you, but also because you have the
ability to block stuff when the
defense kind of messes up, and
save your teammates in away, and
that right there is a morale boost
that can change the whole game.

It's a special position.
Outside of being the goalie, it's
a really long season. We're here
all summer, have three weeks of
intense preseason, and then play
every weekend until December.
So it's really important to strike a
balance between having a ton of
fun at practice and keeping the
mood light but at the same time
staying focused. I've been on
teams in the past, and there were
years [when] we were far too seri
ous and tense. And then water
polo didn't become as fun and the
level of play declined. But there
have been years when we've also
been too goofy. I see myself as
someone who can read the mood,
and if we need to be serious buck
le down, but then also at times
keep things light and fun.
(TSD): Kids don't exactly flock to
water polo. How did you get into
the sport and what was it that
made you want to take it to such a
high level?
(Platshon): My beginning in
water polo comes from my broth
ers, and is kind of also why I'm a
goalie. We have a little pool at my
house, and both my brothers

played. My brother [Kevin]
won two NCAA titles at Cal.
They'd come home from
practice and [want to] shoot,
so they would throw me in
the goal. I couldn't block any
thing for years and years and
years, but then I kind of
learned to play better. And I
always kind of stuck with
goalie. So that was my path
to water polo.

But the reason I love the
sport so much, in the sim
plest terms I can put it, is that
it's just a beautiful combina
tion of the good things offered
in other sports. I love fast
paced sports—l could never
play baseball—and I love that
there's never any down time in
water polo. It's an incredibly
demanding sport and it com
bines everything I loved in the
games I was playing when I
was younger. I loved being in
the water and the fast pace of
basketball, and I ended up
being decently good at water
polo.

(TSD): Where should I go if
I'm looking for a killer meal
at any hour of the day.

(Platshon): Burrito night
on Wednesdays at KA. For
sure. Hmm, I'm trying to
think of any hidden gems I
have. I'll say my go-to study
spot I like to drink coffee
so sometimes I sneak it into
the library from Coupa, but
that's kind of difficult. My
spot is the secret Starbucks.
.. .You get a soup from
Safeway for $1.29, get your
self a coffee and settle down
for two, three hours to crush
some studying.

(TSD): What has been your
favorite experience with
water polo here at Stanford?
(Platshon): My freshman
year I had a pretty special
opportunity to train under
Jimmy Sandman. He was a
fifth-year senior so it was
only for one quarter, but
training with him, just emu
lating what he did in the goal,
and learning his style how
to communicate, how to lead,
how to carry yourself on the
team was an incredible
experience, and I credit that
with a lot of my success right

a really long season. We're here
all summer, have three weeks of
intense preseason, and then play
every weekend until December.
So it's really important to strike a
balance between having a ton of
fun at practice and keeping the
mood light but at the same time
staying focused. I've been on
teams in the past, and there were
years [when] we were far too seri
ous and tense. And then water
polo didn't become as fun and the
level of play declined. But there
have been years when we've also
been too goofy. I see myself as
someone who can read the mood,
and if we need to be serious buck
le down, but then also at times
keep things light and fun.
(TSD): Kids don't exactly flock to
water polo. How did you get into
the sport and what was it that
made you want to take it to such a
high level?
(Platshon): My beginning in
water polo comes from my broth
ers, and is kind of also why I'm a
goalie. We have a little pool at my
house, and both my brothers

played. My brother [Kevin]
won two NCAA titles at Cal.
They'd come home from
practice and [want to] shoot,
so they would throw me in
the goal. I couldn't block any
thing for years and years and
years, but then I kind of
learned to play better. And I
always kind of stuck with
goalie. So that was my path
to water polo.

But the reason I love the
sport so much, in the sim
plest terms I can put it, is that
it's just a beautiful combina
tion of the good things offered
in other sports. I love fast
paced sports—l could never
play baseball—and I love that
there's never any down time in
water polo. It's an incredibly
demanding sport and it com
bines everything I loved in the
games I was playing when I
was younger. I loved being in
the water and the fast pace of
basketball, and I ended up
being decently good at water
polo.

(TSD): Where should I go if
I'm looking for a killer meal
at any hour of the day.

(Platshon): Burrito night
on Wednesdays at KA. For
sure. Hmm, I'm trying to
think of any hidden gems I
have. I'll say my go-to study
spot I like to drink coffee
so sometimes I sneak it into
the library from Coupa, but
that's kind of difficult. My
spot is the secret Starbucks.
.. .You get a soup from
Safeway for $1.29, get your
self a coffee and settle down
for two, three hours to crush
some studying.

(TSD): What has been your
favorite experience with
water polo here at Stanford?
(Platshon): My freshman
year I had a pretty special
opportunity to train under
Jimmy Sandman. He was a
fifth-year senior so it was
only for one quarter, but
training with him, just emu
lating what he did in the goal,
and learning his style how
to communicate, how to lead,
how to carry yourself on the
team was an incredible
experience, and I credit that
with a lot of my success right
now.
But one of the most fun
moments I had, I'd have to
say winning NorCals my
freshman year was awesome.
Even though I played zero
minutes in that whole tour
nament, you really feel like
you're part of the team chal
lenging your teammates
every day in practice and
being there. But then also
starting and playing in a big
game for the first time is
awesome. Going to overtime
in my second start ever
against USC was kind of like
what I had been working for
since I was a 12-and-under.
We lost the game but I
wouldn't trade anything for
that experience. I can't wait
to be in that situation again.
That's when I feel like I
thrive and our team thrives
and that's why I play sports.
(TSD): Everyone's asking
this time of year, but do you
have any post-graduation
plans?
(Platshon): I'm trying to go
to medical school at some
point, and I shadowed a doc
tor in the ER two years ago.
That's something I might be

interested in, and they say
they love ex-student athletes
in the ER because it's almost
the same as sports. You have
to deal with a situation as a
team, it's high pressure, high
intensity and it gave me that
same adrenaline you get
playing high-level sports.
(TSD):: OK, you're stranded
on a desert island and you
can spare three books not to
use as kindling. What're you
reading for the next 50
years? (TSD):
(Platshon): This is a tough
one. Let's start with Harry
Potter. And the Hunger
Games.
(TSD): That's like 10 books
right there, Scott.
(Platshon): I can't just take
the whole series? Damn! OK,
then "Bringing Down the
House," by Ben Mezrich.
"Holes," by Louis Sachar.
And if I'm on an island, I
have to have something of
value. "Great Expectations"
a little C-Dickens. When
you're reading the first 50
pages it's kind of boring, but
then you get into it.
(TSD):Last question. What's
the worst thing about spend
ing all of your days in a pool?
(Platshon): Well you're
always pruning and wrinkly.
But there's nothing worse
than coming out of the locker
room in a Speedo when it 45
degrees outside and then
having to jump into a pool
that you think is like 32
degrees.
(TSD): That just sounds ter
rible. Thanks so much Scott.
(Platshon): No, thank you.
