# Q&A
## Scott Platshon 
### 
After being named an
Ail-American as a high
school senior at Menlo
School, a stone's throw
from Palm Drive, sen
ior Scott Platshon earned the start
ing goalkeeper job this season for
the Stanford men's water polo team.
Platshon allowed just one goal in his
first career start and has No. 3
Stanford set to make a run at a
NCAA Tournament berth when the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament begins on Nov. 23.
Platshon sat down with The
Daily ahead of this weekend's
matches against UC-Davis and
Santa Clara to discuss all things
Stanford, 80s music and water polo.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Let's
start off with a softball. If there
was a top-five most played on
your iPod or on the locker room
iPod, what would be on it?
Scott Platshon (Platshon): It's
funny you ask that, because I'm
actually the DJ every day before
practice. We have a nice Bose
sound system in the locker and I
DJ, which is especially important
before morning practice when we
need to get the morale up. I go
mostly 80s, kind of a lot of Bruce
Springsteen, and a lot of Journey.

And then since I really have to
cater to the whole team, and on
our team trip to Hawaii a song
called "Don't Drop that Dun-Dun-
Dun" became like our team song,
as well as "Let's Do It Again" by J
Boog Those two are when we real
ly need a morale boost before a
6:30 a.m. practice. The team's
looking tired and mad at having to
be there, so you throw that on the
speakers, heads start lifting up,
and you know you're going to
have a good practice.
(TSD): As someone who's been
there and kind of done that in
your fourth year on the Farm, and
especially as the goalie on the
team who anchors the defense,
what is your role as a leader for
the team?
(Platshon): Those are two good
points you bring up. Just by being
the goalie you're kind of thrust
into a leadership position. The
goalie has a special opportunity,
first because you're supposed to
block everything that comes at
you, but also because you have the
ability to block stuff when the
defense kind of messes up, and
save your teammates in away, and
that right there is a morale boost
that can change the whole game.

It's a special position.
Outside of being the goalie, it's
a really long season. We're here
all summer, have three weeks of
intense preseason, and then play
every weekend until December.
So it's really important to strike a
balance between having a ton of
fun at practice and keeping the
mood light but at the same time
staying focused. I've been on
teams in the past, and there were
years [when] we were far too seri
ous and tense. And then water
polo didn't become as fun and the
level of play declined. But there
have been years when we've also
been too goofy. I see myself as
someone who can read the mood,
and if we need to be serious buck
le down, but then also at times
keep things light and fun.
(TSD): Kids don't exactly flock to
water polo. How did you get into
the sport and what was it that
made you want to take it to such a
high level?
(Platshon): My beginning in
water polo comes from my broth
ers, and is kind of also why I'm a
goalie. We have a little pool at my
house, and both my brothers
