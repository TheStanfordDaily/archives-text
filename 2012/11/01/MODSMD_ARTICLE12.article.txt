## Wisconsin in town for early test 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday afternoon, the Avery
Aquatic Center will come alive for
Stanford men's swimming and div
ing's first dual meet of the season.
The Cardinal will face No. 25
Wisconsin as the Badgers set out on a
two-meet Pac-12 road trip.
Last weekend Stanford dominat
ed the competition at the two-day
Pacific Invite in Stockton. Despite sit
ting out of day one on Friday, the
Cardinal nearly managed to win the
meet, sweeping each of Saturday's
nine events. On Friday, the team will
look to build off of last week's success.
"When we came back from the
[UOP] meet, there were a lot of
smiles," said head coach Ted Knapp.
"And I think that is an indication of
their attitude at this point."
Unlike an invitational, where the
competition is spread out between
several teams, the dual meet format
triggers a much more personal and
competitive dynamic, in which the
focus is placed squarely on the team
result rather than on individual times.
The outcome of the meet regularly
comes down to the final few events.
While the swimmers are certainly
primarily concentrated on beating
out the opposing team, competition is
also heating up within the team itself.
"I'm looking for a lot of intra
team races," Knapp said. "There are
a couple of events where we've set it
up so there's some good intra-team
rivalry."
One such example will be the but
terfly events, where freshman Gray
Umbach barely came away with wins
in both the 100 and 200 last weekend.
In the 100 butter-fly he beat out fellow
freshman Tom Kremer by less than a
second, and in the 200 he touched the
wall just three-tenths of a second
before senior Mack Montgomery.
Additionally, the sprint freestyle
should be a tightly contested event,
with senior Aaron Wayne leading the
way, followed by senior Andrew Saeta
and freshman Sean Duggan.
The most emotional events in any
dual meet are the relays, which show
the true team nature of swimming
and often determine the outcome of
the meet. The last relay this Friday
will be the 4x200 freestyle relay and,
according to Knapp, "there's a
lot of excitement amongst the
sprinters about making that a
pretty special relay."
In a normal season, the
Cardinal hardly ever faces a
Big-10 team in a dual meet, so
opening against Wisconsin is a
rare opportunity and a chance
for the team to get a glimpse
at some of the country's top

competition not based in the
Pac-12. Although the Badgers
are currently 3-2 on the sea
son and only 1-2 in confer
ence, Wisconsin has histori
cally been home to a strong
swimming program.

In this year's U.S. Olympic
Trials, Badgers posted a num
ber of strong performances,
highlighted by Michael Weiss'
fifth-place finish in the 400-
yard individual medley
Still, Knapp believes
Stanford has a strategic
advantage because of the
number of swimmers it has

competing in multiple events.
"I think our depth is really
going to showcase our suc
cess," he said. "We have a
very versatile team and about
half the team could probably
swim in five or six different
events."

After the Pacific Invite,
Knapp stressed the impor
tance of "continuing to get
better every meet."
Friday will be the first
chance to do this.
