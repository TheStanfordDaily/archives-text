## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Why Obama hasn't earned my vote 
### Adam Johnson 
I largely identify with the Democratic
Party but I will not vote for Resident
Obama. I cannot endorse his
vision for America. A Republican
making this argument might cite the
economy, taxes, healthcare and other
domestic factors as reasons for this
position. My argument, however, is
grounded in the fact that many of
Obama's national security policies,
from indefinite detention without
trial to drone strikes, have little to no
regard for human rights.
Take, for instance, the Obama
administration's persecution of whis
tle-blowers. Despite campaigning on
the notion that a government employ
ee speaking out was an "act of
courage and patriotism," in the past
four years the Obama administra
tion has charged six people under
the Espionage Act of 1917 for reveal
ing classified information to journal
ists. This number may not seem like
a lot, but all past administrations
combined had only charged three
government officials for providing
classified information to the media.
One of the six people charged is John
Kiriakou, the former CIA officer
who in 2007 exposed the CIAs use of
waterboarding to interrogate al-Qaida
prisoners. As Jesselyn Radack, a direc
tor on the Government Accountability
Project, said, "pursuing whistle-blow
ers as spies is heavy-handed and
beyond the scope of the law."
Certainly not all leaked informa
tion is diligently investigated by the
administration; no one has been
charged for leaking classified infor
mation to The New York Times about
the drone program and Obama's "kill
list." Nor has anyone been charged
regarding the detailed leak, also to
The New York Times, from top
administration officials regarding the
"highly classified" use of the Stuxnet
computer worm against Iran. It
appears, then, that Obama and
Attorney General Eric Holder only
aggressively pursue leaks that are
deemed harmful to the administra
tion. These political prosecutions,
along with considerable increases in
government surveillance of phone
and email communication, inevitably
result in a substantial chilling effect
on free speech and the exposure of
governmental wrongdoing.
The Obama administration's
hawkish policies do not end there.
On Dec. 31, 2011, President Obama
signed into law the 2012 National
Defense Authorization Act, which
allows for the indefinite detention
without trial of anyone (including
American citizens) suspected of sup
porting hostile or "associated
forces." Although Obama claimed in
public that he had reservations
about these controversial provisions,
his administration has fervently
defended the act in response to court
challenges and, from the start, has

maintained that the "detention
authority [is] essential to our ability
to protect the American people."
This logic, though, is hardly distin
guishable from the Bush-era argu
ment that "enhanced interrogation
techniques" were a necessary tool to
save American lives.
And then there are the drone
strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and
Somalia, which have substantially
increased under the Obama presi
dency. Obama claims to be a scholar
on just war theory, which places con
siderable emphasis on distinguish
ing enemy combatants from civil
ians. And yet, not only are hundreds
of innocent women, children, and
first-responders being killed and
injured by these strikes, but all mili
tary-aged males targeted and killed
in drone strikes are assumed to be
enemy combatants unless proven
otherwise posthumously. Regardless
of whether one views drone strikes
as morally acceptable (many do not),
they underestimate the number of
civilians killed and violate the rights
of innocent foreigners to live their
lives free from terror.
President Obama defends these
and other questionable practices as
necessary for the security of this
nation. One has to wonder, however,
if such policies are actually in
America's best interests. At the very
least, we have little claim to being a
world leader on human rights. And
there is a strong case that these poli
cies increase sympathy for, and
membership in, anti-American
efforts. As the Stanford/NYU report
"Living Under Drones" concluded,
"evidence suggests that US strikes
have facilitated recruitment to vio
lent non-state armed groups, and
motivated further violent attacks."
If a Republican president were
behind these policies, Democrats
would be up in arms. To be fair, many
on the left do criticize Obama for his
record on human rights, but these
critiques are outweighed by admira
tion of his strong national security
tactics. We should not give Obama a
free pass on human rights just
because he is a Democrat. And
Romney, whose foreign policy posi
tions are influenced by a host of neo
con advisers, will likely do no better.
There are, however, a few third
party candidates who agree that a
pervasive disregard of human rights
is not the way forward. None of
them will win this election. But since
your vote will, in all likelihood, not
matter, you might as well use it on
whichever candidate you feel best
exemplifies your vision for America's
future, whatever that may be.

Adam is still undecided which third
party candidate, if any, he will vote
for. Try to persuade him at

ers as spies is heavy-handed and
beyond the scope of the law."
Certainly not all leaked informa
tion is diligently investigated by the
administration; no one has been
charged for leaking classified infor
mation to The New York Times about
the drone program and Obama's "kill
list." Nor has anyone been charged
regarding the detailed leak, also to
The New York Times, from top
administration officials regarding the
"highly classified" use of the Stuxnet
computer worm against Iran. It
appears, then, that Obama and
Attorney General Eric Holder only
aggressively pursue leaks that are
deemed harmful to the administra
tion. These political prosecutions,
along with considerable increases in
government surveillance of phone
and email communication, inevitably
result in a substantial chilling effect
on free speech and the exposure of
governmental wrongdoing.
The Obama administration's
hawkish policies do not end there.
On Dec. 31, 2011, President Obama
signed into law the 2012 National
Defense Authorization Act, which
allows for the indefinite detention
without trial of anyone (including
American citizens) suspected of sup
porting hostile or "associated
forces." Although Obama claimed in
public that he had reservations
about these controversial provisions,
his administration has fervently
defended the act in response to court
challenges and, from the start, has

maintained that the "detention
authority [is] essential to our ability
to protect the American people."
This logic, though, is hardly distin
guishable from the Bush-era argu
ment that "enhanced interrogation
techniques" were a necessary tool to
save American lives.
And then there are the drone
strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and
Somalia, which have substantially
increased under the Obama presi
dency. Obama claims to be a scholar
on just war theory, which places con
siderable emphasis on distinguish
ing enemy combatants from civil
ians. And yet, not only are hundreds
of innocent women, children, and
first-responders being killed and
injured by these strikes, but all mili
tary-aged males targeted and killed
in drone strikes are assumed to be
enemy combatants unless proven
otherwise posthumously. Regardless
of whether one views drone strikes
as morally acceptable (many do not),
they underestimate the number of
civilians killed and violate the rights
of innocent foreigners to live their
lives free from terror.
President Obama defends these
and other questionable practices as
necessary for the security of this
nation. One has to wonder, however,
if such policies are actually in
America's best interests. At the very
least, we have little claim to being a
world leader on human rights. And
there is a strong case that these poli
cies increase sympathy for, and
membership in, anti-American
efforts. As the Stanford/NYU report
"Living Under Drones" concluded,
"evidence suggests that US strikes
have facilitated recruitment to vio
lent non-state armed groups, and
motivated further violent attacks."
If a Republican president were
behind these policies, Democrats
would be up in arms. To be fair, many
on the left do criticize Obama for his
record on human rights, but these
critiques are outweighed by admira
tion of his strong national security
tactics. We should not give Obama a
free pass on human rights just
because he is a Democrat. And
Romney, whose foreign policy posi
tions are influenced by a host of neo
con advisers, will likely do no better.
There are, however, a few third
party candidates who agree that a
pervasive disregard of human rights
is not the way forward. None of
them will win this election. But since
your vote will, in all likelihood, not
matter, you might as well use it on
whichever candidate you feel best
exemplifies your vision for America's
future, whatever that may be.

party candidate, if any, he will vote

I largely identify with the Democratic
Party but I will not vote for Resident
Obama. I cannot endorse his
vision for America. A Republican
making this argument might cite the
economy, taxes, healthcare and other
domestic factors as reasons for this
position. My argument, however, is
grounded in the fact that many of
Obama's national security policies,
from indefinite detention without
trial to drone strikes, have little to no
regard for human rights.
Take, for instance, the Obama
administration's persecution of whis
tle-blowers. Despite campaigning on
the notion that a government employ
ee speaking out was an "act of
courage and patriotism," in the past
four years the Obama administra
tion has charged six people under
the Espionage Act of 1917 for reveal
ing classified information to journal
ists. This number may not seem like
a lot, but all past administrations
combined had only charged three
government officials for providing
classified information to the media.
One of the six people charged is John
Kiriakou, the former CIA officer
who in 2007 exposed the CIAs use of
waterboarding to interrogate al-Qaida
prisoners. As Jesselyn Radack, a direc
tor on the Government Accountability
Project, said, "pursuing whistle-blow
ers as spies is heavy-handed and
beyond the scope of the law."
