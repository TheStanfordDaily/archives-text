# University reassessing role of Tresidder Union
## 
### HELIN GAO 
As Stanford commemorates the
50th anniversary of Tresidder
Union this year, the University has
begun re-examining the state of the
student unions, questioning
whether the spaces are still meeting
the needs of Stanford undergradu
ates.
While Tresidder has taken on a
more commercial role in recent
years, focus groups held by the
University have injected new
momentum for the space to return
to being a student union that is "all
about students," according to
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
operations and student unions.
"Part of the Tresidder 50th is to
see where Tresidder will be year's
from now," Smith-Laws said. "We
are looking for creative ways to
make use of the spaces there."
Nested into a cluster of oak
trees, Tresidder was initially
designed with the students in mind
and dedicated to Donald Tresidder,
the fourth president of Stanford
University who was known for his
commitment to students. The space
hosted an open patio space scat
tered with wire mesh Eames-style
chairs, a 14-lane bowling alley and a
pool hall.
"When Tresidder Union was
opened in 1962, it was ahead of its
time," Smith-Laws said. "We had
air-conditioning, meeting rooms,
retail spaces, [a] music listening

room....The second floor was all
open lounge spaces."
She recalled seeing a diverse
array of events in Tresidder, span
ning from the telecast with famed
CBS News President Fred Friendly
to the wedding of a Stanford
employee, Brenda Sepolen.
"If you can think of an event, we
have done it here," Smith-Laws
said. "Before those other places
were built, this was the place where
people came."
Eventually, those "other places"
entered into the picture. Since
Tresidder opened, the University
has seen a multitude of new residen
tial complexes and meeting centers
budding across campus, making
meeting spaces in Tresidder less
essential.
Tresidder has also transformed
over the years. The old tattered Pac
Man machine in the arcade was
replaced by a 24-inch plasma screen
TY and the 14-lane, no-waiting
bowling alley is now the CoHo.
According to Smith-Laws, some
of these changes have been rejuve
nating. This August, the University
introduced Starbucks to Tresidder,
making it the first full-service store
built and operated by the coffee
chain on a college campus anywhere
in the country.
'"lt is breathing life into this
space," Smith-Laws said. "It has
provided a social hang-out place
that we didn't have before."
Meanwhile, new student enter

prises have found their way into
Tresidder as well. Among them is
the Stanford Student Store, run by
Stanford Student Enterprises, a
student organization that provides
hands-on business experience to
student employees. According to
Erica Yuen 'l4, a junior working
part-time in Student Store,
Starbucks is also helping drive cus
tomers to other Tresidder stores.

Because of meeting room rentals
and retail stores like Starbucks,
Tresidder collects enough funds to
sustain the operations of both itself
and Old Union, according to Smith-
Laws.
"I call Tresidder Union the
workhorse," Smith-Laws said about
its role in generating revenue. "It
really all goes back to students if
you think about it, because it is how

we stay open."
Some students have expressed
concerns about the commercializa
tion of the student union. Doctoral
candidate and Daily staffer Tom
Taylor, M.S. 'O4, said the University
had finally "sold us out" in a Sept.

University will be trying a
pilot program during finals

open for 24 hours.
Tresidder may hardly
resemble its original form
but according to Howard
Konad, who has worked at
Stanford Hair for the past 28
years, the space hasn't
changed as much as it seems.
"I have been here since
1984," Konad said. "And it
has been the same because
the students are the same."

As Stanford commemorates the
50th anniversary of Tresidder
Union this year, the University has
begun re-examining the state of the
student unions, questioning
whether the spaces are still meeting
the needs of Stanford undergradu
ates.
While Tresidder has taken on a
more commercial role in recent
years, focus groups held by the
University have injected new
momentum for the space to return
to being a student union that is "all
about students," according to
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
operations and student unions.
"Part of the Tresidder 50th is to
see where Tresidder will be year's
from now," Smith-Laws said. "We
are looking for creative ways to
make use of the spaces there."
Nested into a cluster of oak
trees, Tresidder was initially
designed with the students in mind
and dedicated to Donald Tresidder,
the fourth president of Stanford
University who was known for his
commitment to students. The space
hosted an open patio space scat
tered with wire mesh Eames-style
chairs, a 14-lane bowling alley and a
pool hall.
"When Tresidder Union was
opened in 1962, it was ahead of its
time," Smith-Laws said. "We had
air-conditioning, meeting rooms,
retail spaces, [a] music listening

room....The second floor was all
open lounge spaces."
She recalled seeing a diverse
array of events in Tresidder, span
ning from the telecast with famed
