# ELECTION 2012
## Q&A with Rep. Anna Eshoo 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D) is
the representative for California's
14th Congressional District. Since
1993, Eshoo has been serving the
district, which covered parts of
Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties,
including the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Redwood City until the 2012 redistricting. She is
currently running for election in the redrawn
18th Congressional Distinct, which now includes
Palo Alto.
Eshoo, who is the ranking member of the
House Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology, spoke at the PoliSci 51K: Election
2012 seminar series on Oct. 30 and later sat down
to speak with The Daily about working in a divid
ed Congress, the upcoming elections and issues
concerning college students and Silicon Valley.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What do you feel are
the top three political issues for American voters
today, and what are the top three issues for col
lege students today?
Anna Eshoo (AE): Generally, in terms of the
electorate, they have a laser-beam focus on the
national economy how more jobs can be creat
ed, certainly the debt and the deficit and also how
a dysfunctional Congress can start working again
for the benefit of the country. The electorate [is]
very troubled that Congress has not functioned,
in their view, for their benefit. So those are the
top issues.
For college students, I feel that there is a
reflection of those main concerns. They may
express them in a different way, but certainly, the
affordability of a college education, our national
economy, the opportunities for their future and
also the fiscal situation in the country.
TSD: What are the most pressing legislative
issues for your district, and Silicon Valley in par
ticular?
AE: The top issues that the very small startup
companies talk to me about, right up to the
largest one and everyone in between, are immi
gration, education [and] patent reform....
Immigration [reform] is embraced across the
board among my constituents, especially in the
private sector. They see that there is a demand
for scientists and engineers and that there need
to be reforms to our immigration systems in the
visas and all that applies to [them],
TSD: What particular immigration reform poli
cies would you yourself advocate?
AE: I have always been for comprehensive immi
gration reform, number one, because the system
is broken across the spectrum... Having said
