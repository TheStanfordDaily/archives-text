# ELECTION 2012
## Q&A with Rep. Anna Eshoo 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D) is
the representative for California's
14th Congressional District. Since
1993, Eshoo has been serving the
district, which covered parts of
Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties,
including the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Redwood City until the 2012 redistricting. She is
currently running for election in the redrawn
18th Congressional Distinct, which now includes
Palo Alto.
Eshoo, who is the ranking member of the
House Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology, spoke at the PoliSci 51K: Election
2012 seminar series on Oct. 30 and later sat down
to speak with The Daily about working in a divid
ed Congress, the upcoming elections and issues
concerning college students and Silicon Valley.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What do you feel are
the top three political issues for American voters
today, and what are the top three issues for col
lege students today?
Anna Eshoo (AE): Generally, in terms of the
electorate, they have a laser-beam focus on the
national economy how more jobs can be creat
ed, certainly the debt and the deficit and also how
a dysfunctional Congress can start working again
for the benefit of the country. The electorate [is]
very troubled that Congress has not functioned,
in their view, for their benefit. So those are the
top issues.
For college students, I feel that there is a
reflection of those main concerns. They may
express them in a different way, but certainly, the
affordability of a college education, our national
economy, the opportunities for their future and
also the fiscal situation in the country.
TSD: What are the most pressing legislative
issues for your district, and Silicon Valley in par
ticular?
AE: The top issues that the very small startup
companies talk to me about, right up to the
largest one and everyone in between, are immi
gration, education [and] patent reform....
Immigration [reform] is embraced across the
board among my constituents, especially in the
private sector. They see that there is a demand
for scientists and engineers and that there need
to be reforms to our immigration systems in the
visas and all that applies to [them],
TSD: What particular immigration reform poli
cies would you yourself advocate?
AE: I have always been for comprehensive immi
gration reform, number one, because the system
is broken across the spectrum... Having said
that, I think that we have some
opportunities for pieces of legisla
tion to repair the system as well. The
whole area of those who come to the
United States for their higher edu
cation ... our immigration system
does not allow them to stay. I've
always taken the view that we
should staple that green card to
their degree because our country
[and] our economy would benefit
enormously. Instead, these gradu
ates are going to their countries of
origin and competing hard against
us. That doesn't make sense to me.
TSD: Do you feel that Congress is
equipped or that its members are
well enough informed to create a
regulatory framework that will keep
up with Silicon Valley's innovation?
AE: Well, first of all, government
does not keep up with the rapidity of
change. It always lags behind.
Having said that, I do think at the
time I first entered the Congress...
there was hardly anybody who knew
the issues or understood them. But
the advocacy from Silicon Valley, and
the dramatic changes Silicon Valley
has brought about not only in our
country but also in the world, speaks
for itself. I would describe it in the
following way: There is a broader
appreciation of what [Silicon Valley]
represents, but I don't believe that
there is a deep understanding across

the entirety of the Congress about
the issues. Many of them are
extraordinarily complex, but I do
think that it has changed. It has
changed in part because members
are using the technology them
selves, certainly their families are,
and they see the changes there.
TSD: In your opinion, and from
what you have observed this elec
tion, how much have political dona
tions impacted this election relative
to the last presidential election?
AE: The whole issue of money in
campaigns is a total turn-off to the
electorate because it chips away
their confidence in representation.
What the Supreme Court unleashed
with the Citizens United case is
unspeakably undemocratic. I think
it is one of the most disastrous deci
sions any Supreme Court in the his
tory of the country has rendered,
because it has changed everything.
You have anonymity in terms of
donors, in unspecified amounts.
That is not democratic, and I think
most people find that sickening.
TSD: This Congress has passed the
fewest laws of any Congress in 65
years. What do you feel are the caus
es of this lack of productivity?
AE: When you have a party that
says, through its leadership, on the
heels of the inauguration, that its top
goal is that the president does not
have a second term, that's quite
stunning. And they kept that prom
ise. When you decide that you're
going to say 'No' before you've ever
had a conversation, the American

people are going to lose. But what
happened with this is that there is a
pox on both houses, on both parties.
What happened was unprecedented.
TSD: How will you gain back the
trust of your constituents if you are
re-elected?
AE: I've always produced results
and victories for my constituents,
regardless of whether I'm serving in
the minority.... I'm always on the
hunt for, or always begin with, a
Republican lead on my legislation
and I keep building on that. And
sometimes it doesn't work, but that's
not because of the lack of my trying.
... Together with Congressman Greg
Walden (R-0re.)... we wrote legisla
tion [reallocating spectrum
allowances] and successfully passed
it. It may not be an issue that is writ
ten about above the fold in major
newspapers, but it is a significant
accomplishment. That took almost
15 months to accomplish, and I was
bound and determined that the leg
islation would not fall apart because
of a lack of bipartisanship. It does
take determination.
If you start out with your eye on
the prize, and... you'll do everything
possible to keep things together and
on track, it can be done. Is it diffi
cult? Of course it is. But the framers
did not design our system to be an
easy one, and I always keep that at
the back of my mind. There are days
when I think that things are falling
apart... but you have to stay at the
table and keep it together.

trust of your constituents if you are
re-elected?
AE: I've always produced results
and victories for my constituents,
regardless of whether I'm serving in
the minority.... I'm always on the
hunt for, or always begin with, a
Republican lead on my legislation
and I keep building on that. And
sometimes it doesn't work, but that's
not because of the lack of my trying.
... Together with Congressman Greg
Walden (R-0re.)... we wrote legisla
tion [reallocating spectrum
allowances] and successfully passed
it. It may not be an issue that is writ
ten about above the fold in major
newspapers, but it is a significant
accomplishment. That took almost
15 months to accomplish, and I was
bound and determined that the leg
islation would not fall apart because
of a lack of bipartisanship. It does
take determination.
If you start out with your eye on
the prize, and... you'll do everything
possible to keep things together and
on track, it can be done. Is it diffi
cult? Of course it is. But the framers
did not design our system to be an
easy one, and I always keep that at
the back of my mind. There are days
when I think that things are falling
apart... but you have to stay at the
table and keep it together.
Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D) is
the representative for California's
14th Congressional District. Since
1993, Eshoo has been serving the
district, which covered parts of
Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties,
including the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Redwood City until the 2012 redistricting. She is
currently running for election in the redrawn
18th Congressional Distinct, which now includes
Palo Alto.
Eshoo, who is the ranking member of the
House Subcommittee on Communications and
Technology, spoke at the PoliSci 51K: Election
2012 seminar series on Oct. 30 and later sat down
to speak with The Daily about working in a divid
ed Congress, the upcoming elections and issues
concerning college students and Silicon Valley.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What do you feel are
the top three political issues for American voters
today, and what are the top three issues for col
lege students today?
Anna Eshoo (AE): Generally, in terms of the
electorate, they have a laser-beam focus on the
national economy how more jobs can be creat
ed, certainly the debt and the deficit and also how
a dysfunctional Congress can start working again
for the benefit of the country. The electorate [is]
very troubled that Congress has not functioned,
in their view, for their benefit. So those are the
top issues.
For college students, I feel that there is a
reflection of those main concerns. They may
express them in a different way, but certainly, the
affordability of a college education, our national
economy, the opportunities for their future and
also the fiscal situation in the country.
TSD: What are the most pressing legislative
issues for your district, and Silicon Valley in par
ticular?
AE: The top issues that the very small startup
companies talk to me about, right up to the
largest one and everyone in between, are immi
gration, education [and] patent reform....
Immigration [reform] is embraced across the
board among my constituents, especially in the
private sector. They see that there is a demand
for scientists and engineers and that there need
to be reforms to our immigration systems in the
visas and all that applies to [them],
TSD: What particular immigration reform poli
cies would you yourself advocate?
AE: I have always been for comprehensive immi
gration reform, number one, because the system
is broken across the spectrum... Having said
that, I think that we have some
opportunities for pieces of legisla
tion to repair the system as well. The
whole area of those who come to the
United States for their higher edu
cation ... our immigration system
does not allow them to stay. I've
always taken the view that we
should staple that green card to
their degree because our country
[and] our economy would benefit
enormously. Instead, these gradu
ates are going to their countries of
origin and competing hard against
us. That doesn't make sense to me.
TSD: Do you feel that Congress is
equipped or that its members are
well enough informed to create a
regulatory framework that will keep
up with Silicon Valley's innovation?
AE: Well, first of all, government
does not keep up with the rapidity of
change. It always lags behind.
Having said that, I do think at the
time I first entered the Congress...
there was hardly anybody who knew
the issues or understood them. But
the advocacy from Silicon Valley, and
the dramatic changes Silicon Valley
has brought about not only in our
country but also in the world, speaks
for itself. I would describe it in the
following way: There is a broader
appreciation of what [Silicon Valley]
represents, but I don't believe that
there is a deep understanding across

the entirety of the Congress about
the issues. Many of them are
extraordinarily complex, but I do
think that it has changed. It has
changed in part because members
are using the technology them
selves, certainly their families are,
and they see the changes there.
TSD: In your opinion, and from
what you have observed this elec
tion, how much have political dona
tions impacted this election relative
to the last presidential election?
AE: The whole issue of money in
campaigns is a total turn-off to the
electorate because it chips away
their confidence in representation.
What the Supreme Court unleashed
with the Citizens United case is
unspeakably undemocratic. I think
it is one of the most disastrous deci
sions any Supreme Court in the his
tory of the country has rendered,
because it has changed everything.
You have anonymity in terms of
donors, in unspecified amounts.
That is not democratic, and I think
most people find that sickening.
TSD: This Congress has passed the
fewest laws of any Congress in 65
years. What do you feel are the caus
es of this lack of productivity?
AE: When you have a party that
says, through its leadership, on the
heels of the inauguration, that its top
goal is that the president does not
have a second term, that's quite
stunning. And they kept that prom
ise. When you decide that you're
going to say 'No' before you've ever
had a conversation, the American

people are going to lose. But what
happened with this is that there is a
pox on both houses, on both parties.
What happened was unprecedented.

trust of your constituents if you are
