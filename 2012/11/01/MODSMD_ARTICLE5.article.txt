## Online ed. raises intellectual property issues 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
Although Stanford's recent foray into online edu
cation has been met with cautious praise, faculty
members have raised concerns surrounding intellec
tual property rights in the online space.
The advent of Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs) has led to questions about control of intel
lectual property. Since instructional materials have
become widely available on the web and are easily
accessible by the general public, ownership rights
have become even murkier than before.
MOOC Intellectual Property Ownership
MOOCs are large-scale, free and publicly avail
able courses that have become increasingly popular
in higher education. The concept's breakthrough
came in 2011, when Sebastian Thrun, lecturer in
Stanford's Computer Science Department, taught a
MOOC on artificial intelligence for which 160,000 stu
dents signed up.
MOOC platforms such as Coursera, Udacity, edX
and Class2Go have all launched in the past 18
months. They've generated a great deal of interest in
the press and have set out a possible path for provid
ing education at a low cost for millions around the
world.
According to Vice Provost for Online Learning
John Mitchell, course material produced by Stanford
faculty, including MOOC material, belongs to
Stanford University.
"With our terms of service, we are not transfer
ring ownership to [MOOC platforms]," Mitchell said.
"We are just letting them show the material on our
website."
He cited the University's agreement with
Coursera, which he said allows the company to deliv-
er the course but not to own it.
However faculty members like
Amin Saberi, associate professor
in the Management Science and
Engineering Department and the
developer of Venture Lab, another
MOOC platform, argue that stan
dards may need to be developed
to a higher degree.
"We need more...developmen
tal standards, policies in terms of
control and ownership, [and]
responsible online practice with
in the University," he said.
Mitchell was firm in express
ing the University's support for
faculty.
"Stanford will protect faculty
if there is any problem with
Stanford online courses,"
Mitchell said.
Another potential intellectual
property issue Mitchell identified
is plagiarism.
"If someone else wants to
read some of my ideas or the out
line of my course, that's fine with
me," he said. "But I don't want
them to copy it and claim it as
their own work. I think that
whenever there is material on
the web, you have this issue of
plagiarism."
Mitchell affirmed that this
matter is indeed an issue that the
university is taking seriously.
"We are interested in making
sure that people get appropriate
credit, and that things are not
stolen or not credited," he said.
Fair use and copyrighted con
tent online
Lauren Schoenthaler, senior
University counsel, acknowledged
that copyright infringement could
become a serious issue in the use
of third-party materials in
MOOCs. This is because currently
faculty members enjoy a copy
right exception on materials that
they show in on-campus classes,
because they are using them for
educational purposes.
"The face-to-face teaching
exception allows faculty to show
cartoons, photographs or graphs
within an on-campus classroom
setting," she said. "But that
exception does not apply to
unmediated, no-credit MOOCs
that are open to the public."
Although the creators and
professors of MOOCs may rely
on fair use as a basis to use mate
rials, Schoenthaler suggests that
faculty should be cognizant of the
nuances of the fair use of content,
such as photographs, in certain

situations. She highlighted two
examples where faculty could
legitimately use copyrighted con
tent in online courses.
"First, [if] the image shown is
being directly criticized, for
example, in a photography
course, a photo is being shown to
illustrate the problems with over
exposing film," Schoenthaler
said. "The image is being used in
a transformative way; that is, the
purpose for use in the course is
completely different than its
original purpose."
"In a course about web
design, it is acceptable to show a
web screen shot of an auction
from eßay to illustrate a web
design technique; that is, the
transformative purpose is to
illustrate a web design principle,
completely different from eßay's
intended purpose of hosting an
online auction," she added.
Aside from this type of fair
use, it is also acceptable for facul
ty to utilize limited portions of
copyrighted materials that
directly relate to the educational
goal.
"In particular, limited images
that demonstrate or illustrate the
educational concept at issue could
be found to be fair use when used
sparingly and appropriately," she
said. For example, a plant cell
dividing in a biology course would
like qualify as fair use.
She recommended that facul
ty use public domain media
rather than its copyrighted coun
terpart.
"I often advise MOOC cre
ators to avoid copyright concerns
by relying on the many websites
that offer either public domain or
freely licensed images," she said.
She remains optimistic that
these legal concerns will be a hin
drance to the advancement of
online education.
"Putting together slides for
MOOCs definitely requires more
intentionality around the sourc
ing of images compared to stan
dard in-class presentations," she
said. "In the end though, copy
right concerns are definitely sur
mountable and should never
present a barrier."
Mitchell shares the same
view.
"I think that that the legal
issues should be manageable," he
said. "If we have good ideas and
material that we think is useful
for our students or we want to
make available publicly, there are
ways to do that that use the law
to protect us and allow us to do
the things that we want to do."
