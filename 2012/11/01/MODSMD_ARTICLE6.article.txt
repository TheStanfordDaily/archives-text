# Q&A
## Hennessy: A 'transformative vision 
### – Billy Gallagher 
Stanford University President John
Hennessy sat down with The
Stanford Daily on Oct. 29 to discuss
a wide range of topics, including
online education, Stanford's failed
campaign for a New York City campus last
fall, Stanford's fundraising prowess and
more. This is the third of four installments of
that interview; this one focuses on Stanford's
success in fundraising and the use of that
money.

TSD: Apart of that [New York City campus]
proposal... [was] how much money
Stanford's raised and how it could raise very
significant capital, billions of dollars, for

that campus. Will Stanford still be embark
ing on an aggressive fundraising campaign?
And, if so, what will the money be used for?
JH: I think the question is, "Will Stanford ...
still have ambitious things to do?" And then
I think we'll have a fundraising campaign
that I don't know that we'll have a large,
integrated campaign like we've just finished
recently but we'll certainly be raising
money for important University priorities
and I think, to the extent that we have com
pelling, visionary things to do. That's what
was attractive about New York: it was com
pelling, it was visionary, it was very differ
ent and it opened up some new opportuni
ties for the University.

But if we have other and I'm sure we
will have other compelling, important
things we want to do, then I think we will
certainly turn to our alumni and supporters
for help with those.
TSD: Over the past few years Stanford's
been almost mind-bogglingly successful at
raising money. What do you think con
tributes to that success? I mean, whether
it's on our end or if it's just the alumni lov
ing the school?
JH: It's clearly tremendous affection and
loyalty from the alumni. It's
a compelling vision of what
we are able to do, whether it
be the SEED [Stanford
Institute for Innovation in
Developing Economies]
project in the business
school, talking about using
entrepreneurism as the way
to generate economic
growth in the poorest coun
tries in the world, or it's
moving ahead on a new Bing
Concert Hall, doing some
thing to really raise the qual
ity of the arts and our spaces
for the arts at Stanford.
Those are big ideas, big
vision. They're the kinds of
things people say, "That's
transformative. If Stanford
can do that, that will trans
form the experience that the
students, faculty and
Stanford community have."
I think they get excited
about that sort of opportuni
ty. I mean the hospital,
rebuilding the hospital and
building a state-of-the-art,
brand new hospital. That's a
compelling vision. That's
what people like to back: [a]
compelling vision that they
think is going to make a dif
ference. ... You think about
philanthropy, people think
about it as a philanthropic
investment. It's an invest
ment [that] doesn't have a
monetary return; it has a
social return. But they want
to see that it's going to have
a large social return. And
then they have great faith in
the University as a steward
of their philanthropy.

TSD: Do you think that this
huge philanthropy and huge
fundraising success will be
one of the major hallmarks
of your tenure here at
Stanford, or do you think
other things will be pointed
to?
JH: In the end, it's what you
do with the money. So, what
we've been able to do in
terms of financial aid, you
know, I was just looking at
the financial aid numbers
and... the nationally defined
standard — net tuition,
namely. You take tuition, you

subtract all the financial aid.
So our net tuition number
means students are paying
about the same amount,
after inflation, as they were
in the early '9os. So we've
managed to actually bring
the effective affordability of
a Stanford education down
for many families. That's a
compelling, really com
pelling thing for people at a
time when, particularly mid
dle-class families, are having
a lot of stress about financial
aid.

Rebuilding the engineer
ing side of campus. That side
of campus ... it looked like an
industrial slum. I mean liter
ally— pipes on the outside
of buildings and all these lit
tle cinder block buildings
and the streets were all
every-which-way. I remem
ber when I got here and the
parking lot I parked my car
in, I then walked over the
top of this old building that
housed part of the accelera
tor stuff in it... on a wooden
bridge that went over the
top of this old ramshackle
building with barbed wire
fences on both sides and
things like that.... It was
horrible. So that's all gone
and that part of campus
looks really great. We used
to never take visitors on the
tour to the side of engineer
ing campus because it was so
ugly; now you can walk down
there and it looks great.
The new business school
... the concert hall, obviously,
and the new Anderson col
lection. Those are really
going to be transformative
things.

And then faculty: we've
managed to raise [money
for] hundreds of endowed
chairs, and that's going to
enable us to continue to
attract the best faculty. So in
the end, it's really the invest
ments you make of the
money. It's true that our
enormous fundraising suc
cess has allowed us to accel
erate a lot of projects....

When we first heard about
the business school project,
the provost and I thought [it
would take] 10 to 15 years
for them to rebuild their
entire campus. 10 to 15
years. Because we thought,
"They'll build the classroom
building and then they'll
fundraise the next building."
But they have a lot of
alumni who not only love the
business school and found it
transformative in their lives,
but [who] really saw this
vision of a new way of teach
ing in business schools that
was much more small group
oriented, that needed a dif
ferent kind of classroom
structure, that engaged the
rest of the University more
and they found the vision
compelling and ... the new
buildings and new campus
were needed to fulfill the
vision. And they managed to
raise the money they needed
in three years instead of 10
or 12 years. So that's a good
sign.

building with barbed wire
fences on both sides and
things like that.... It was
horrible. So that's all gone
and that part of campus
looks really great. We used
to never take visitors on the
tour to the side of engineer
ing campus because it was so
ugly; now you can walk down
there and it looks great.
The new business school
... the concert hall, obviously,
and the new Anderson col
lection. Those are really
going to be transformative
things.

And then faculty: we've
managed to raise [money
for] hundreds of endowed
chairs, and that's going to
enable us to continue to
attract the best faculty. So in
the end, it's really the invest
ments you make of the
money. It's true that our
enormous fundraising suc
cess has allowed us to accel
erate a lot of projects....

When we first heard about
the business school project,
the provost and I thought [it
would take] 10 to 15 years
for them to rebuild their
entire campus. 10 to 15
years. Because we thought,
"They'll build the classroom
building and then they'll
fundraise the next building."
But they have a lot of
alumni who not only love the
business school and found it
transformative in their lives,
but [who] really saw this
vision of a new way of teach
ing in business schools that
was much more small group
oriented, that needed a dif
ferent kind of classroom
structure, that engaged the
rest of the University more
and they found the vision
compelling and ... the new
buildings and new campus
were needed to fulfill the
vision. And they managed to
raise the money they needed
in three years instead of 10
or 12 years. So that's a good
sign.

Tomorrow's installment mil
focus on President Hennessy's
future at Stanford and on long
term projects for the University.
Stanford University President John
Hennessy sat down with The
Stanford Daily on Oct. 29 to discuss
a wide range of topics, including
online education, Stanford's failed
campaign for a New York City campus last
fall, Stanford's fundraising prowess and
more. This is the third of four installments of
that interview; this one focuses on Stanford's
success in fundraising and the use of that
money.

TSD: Apart of that [New York City campus]
proposal... [was] how much money
Stanford's raised and how it could raise very
significant capital, billions of dollars, for

that campus. Will Stanford still be embark
ing on an aggressive fundraising campaign?
And, if so, what will the money be used for?
JH: I think the question is, "Will Stanford ...
still have ambitious things to do?" And then
I think we'll have a fundraising campaign
that I don't know that we'll have a large,
integrated campaign like we've just finished
recently but we'll certainly be raising
money for important University priorities
and I think, to the extent that we have com
pelling, visionary things to do. That's what
was attractive about New York: it was com
pelling, it was visionary, it was very differ
ent and it opened up some new opportuni
ties for the University.

But if we have other and I'm sure we
will have other compelling, important
things we want to do, then I think we will
certainly turn to our alumni and supporters
for help with those.
TSD: Over the past few years Stanford's
been almost mind-bogglingly successful at
raising money. What do you think con
tributes to that success? I mean, whether
it's on our end or if it's just the alumni lov
ing the school?
JH: It's clearly tremendous affection and
loyalty from the alumni. It's
a compelling vision of what
we are able to do, whether it
be the SEED [Stanford
Institute for Innovation in
Developing Economies]
project in the business
school, talking about using
entrepreneurism as the way
to generate economic
growth in the poorest coun
tries in the world, or it's
moving ahead on a new Bing
Concert Hall, doing some
thing to really raise the qual
ity of the arts and our spaces
for the arts at Stanford.
Those are big ideas, big
vision. They're the kinds of
things people say, "That's
transformative. If Stanford
can do that, that will trans
form the experience that the
students, faculty and
Stanford community have."
I think they get excited
about that sort of opportuni
ty. I mean the hospital,
rebuilding the hospital and
building a state-of-the-art,
brand new hospital. That's a
compelling vision. That's
what people like to back: [a]
compelling vision that they
think is going to make a dif
ference. ... You think about
philanthropy, people think
about it as a philanthropic
investment. It's an invest
ment [that] doesn't have a
monetary return; it has a
social return. But they want
to see that it's going to have
a large social return. And
then they have great faith in
the University as a steward
of their philanthropy.

TSD: Do you think that this
huge philanthropy and huge
fundraising success will be
one of the major hallmarks
of your tenure here at
Stanford, or do you think
other things will be pointed
to?
JH: In the end, it's what you
do with the money. So, what
we've been able to do in
terms of financial aid, you
know, I was just looking at
the financial aid numbers
and... the nationally defined
standard — net tuition,
namely. You take tuition, you

subtract all the financial aid.
So our net tuition number
means students are paying
about the same amount,
after inflation, as they were
in the early '9os. So we've
managed to actually bring
the effective affordability of
a Stanford education down
for many families. That's a
compelling, really com
pelling thing for people at a
time when, particularly mid
dle-class families, are having
a lot of stress about financial
aid.

Rebuilding the engineer
ing side of campus. That side
of campus ... it looked like an
industrial slum. I mean liter
ally— pipes on the outside
of buildings and all these lit
tle cinder block buildings
and the streets were all
every-which-way. I remem
ber when I got here and the
parking lot I parked my car
in, I then walked over the
top of this old building that
housed part of the accelera
tor stuff in it... on a wooden
bridge that went over the
top of this old ramshackle
building with barbed wire
fences on both sides and
things like that.... It was
horrible. So that's all gone
and that part of campus
looks really great. We used
to never take visitors on the
