## Hennessy: A 'transformative vision 
### â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Stanford University President John
Hennessy sat down with The
Stanford Daily on Oct. 29 to discuss
a wide range of topics, including
online education, Stanford's failed
campaign for a New York City campus last
fall, Stanford's fundraising prowess and
more. This is the third of four installments of
that interview; this one focuses on Stanford's
success in fundraising and the use of that

Stanford's raised and how it could raise very

And, if so, what will the money be used for?

that I don't know that we'll have a large,
integrated campaign like we've just finished
recently but we'll certainly be raising
money for important University priorities
and I think, to the extent that we have com
pelling, visionary things to do. That's what
was attractive about New York: it was com
pelling, it was visionary, it was very differ

ties for the University.

But if we have other and I'm sure we
will have other compelling, important
things we want to do, then I think we will
certainly turn to our alumni and supporters
for help with those.
TSD: Over the past few years Stanford's
been almost mind-bogglingly successful at
raising money. What do you think con
tributes to that success? I mean, whether
it's on our end or if it's just the alumni lov
ing the school?
JH: It's clearly tremendous affection and
