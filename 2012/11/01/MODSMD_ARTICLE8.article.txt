Professor of political science and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice addressed 200 members of
the Class of 2014 in an event organized by the junior class presidents. She spoke about her decision as
a college junior to take up an international politics major instead of concert piano, and encouraged students
to follow their passion. She emphasized that she has no plans to return to Washington D.C., regardless
of the outcome of the Tuesday election. Twelve students and community members held signs criticizing
Rice in a protest organized by Stanford Says No to War (SSNW).
