## Luck is all around 
### Sam Fisher 
A few days ago, a short
video from Showtime
surfaced on the
Internet about a dying
Colts fan's last wish.
Danny Webber wanted to meet
Andrew Luck at a Colts game before
dying of the terminal cancer that had
put him in hospice care.
If you haven't seen the video,
which you can find by searching
"Danny Webber Meets Colts QB
Andrew Luck," I certainly recom
mend doing so soon. It's a powerful
glimpse into the effort of a few great
people to give Danny one last happy
moment in his life.
In the video, the Colts grant
Danny's last wish by inviting him to a
game and giving him passes to go on
the field before the game. During his
time on the field, a few Colts players
and coaches greet Danny and show
him support. The climax of Danny's
visit was Andrew stopping by to talk
quickly and to present him with an
autographed football.
When I showed this video to
friends in person and on Facebook, I
was surprised by the reaction it
received. Everyone here focused on
how proud they were of Andrew and
how great of a person Andrew is. This
was a very different message than I
expected to hear.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge
Andrew Luck fan. I think Andrew's a
great guy, and what he did for Danny
Webber was very kind. But you and I
know that most people in that situa
tion would have done something very
similar for Mr. Webber.
When I think about Danny
Webber's story, I think about how
lucky we are all at Stanford. Someone
on this earth's last wish was to meet
Andrew Luck. Think about this for a
minute. For his last happy day on this
earth, Danny Webber wanted thirty
seconds with Andrew.
How many of you reading this
spent a lot more than thirty seconds
with Andrew Luck during his time on
The Farm? How many others have
spent days, weeks, or even years
with someone else who is truly amaz
ing on this campus? I'm guessing it's
a pretty big list, and certainly
includes me.
This place is really frickin' cool.
When midterms are at their worst,
you're pulling an all-nighter for a
paper, or you just can't figure out that
last question on the CS 103 problem
set, try to remember how lucky we
really are. I can't imagine wanting to
be anywhere else. I think my friend
Jacob Jaffe said it best in his last ever
column at The Daily before graduat
ing in June:
'At Stanford, you get to meet
some of the greatest athletes in the
world and you get to see champi
onships every year. But you also get
everything else that goes with it. You
don't need to work for the newspaper
or radio station to get an up-close and
personal look at all these games. You
don't need to be in the right frat or
sorority to know the athletes person
ally, as friends instead of just icons.
And you don't need to be in the
LSJUMB to have your blood pump
ing when All Right Now' plays."
I'll add to Jacob that you don't
need to focus on the highest-profile
sporting events either. Andrew Luck
might have received front-page cov
erage throughout his career, but even
with him gone, there is plenty of
greatness left behind that you can
experience almost any day
I'm not kidding with that any day
either. Start tonight at 7 p.m. Head to
Maples Pavilion to see Chiney
Ogwumike, a preseason First Team
All-American basketball player, open
up her junior season. Just like
Andrew, Chiney is one of the best
players in her sport in the entire
world and an awesome person off the
court. The difference between Chiney
and Andrew, lucky for you, is that
Chiney will be here for two more
years.

The beauty of this campus,
besides all the palm trees, is that even
with all the time I spend covering ath
letics, I'm certain that there are so
many more amazing people I haven't
even heard of who are leaving their
legacy on The Farm. Go out and meet
them. Watch them be great. You're
lucky. You don't have to wait until
your dying breath to have the oppor
tunity.

Sam Fisher has spent close to 300
minutes with Andrew Luck, but
hopes one day to earn a little face
time with Henry "Goose" Anderson,
to discuss the intricacies of FIFA
Set the two of them up together at
