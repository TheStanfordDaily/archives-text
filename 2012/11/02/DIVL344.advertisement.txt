Mittß-BO FOR
PRESIDENT?
Yes, you know the
Republocrats
Who continue to offer you nothing but the
poor choice of which royal family will
increasingly rule your life's choices.
Does it really make sense to keep voting for
"the lesser of two evils"?
The hoped-for change with "the lesser of two
evils " has never gotten us ahead... 0

• Republocrats either don't know how the economy works, or they lie
to us. Their promises behind their "stimulus" plans were simply wrong.
Are we better off today?

• Republocrats will continue the wasteful spending of your money for
"stimulus" plans and bailouts to transfer more of your money to their
crony insiders and special interests, which create phantom jobs but no
value-creating, sustainable jobs.

• It is immoral to force our children and grandchildren to pay for all of this
deficit spending. Republocrats will continue to wage wars around the
globe with our money and the lives of our young people. Bombing people
into democracy will not work—it simply lowers our standing in the world
and throws us deeper in debt. If democracy is not in the hearts and minds
of people, it is not to be.

• Republocrats will continue to invade your person with dictates as to
what you will eat, who you will associate with, where your children will go
to school, what doctor you can see and when, and every other decree they
make. Do they really know what is best for you and your family? If we
don't do what our elite Republocrats demand, they'll throw us in jail.
