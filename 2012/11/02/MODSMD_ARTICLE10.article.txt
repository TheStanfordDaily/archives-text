## Colorado on the short end of the stick 
### Sam Fisher 
Another week, another ugly victory
for the Cardinal. Stanford's 7-
point win against Washington
State was anything but pretty;
the Cardinal had no excuse to let
the Cougars hang around, but the game came
down to the last drive. Nov; Stanford heads to
Boulder to take on the woeful Colorado
Buffaloes, whose only win of the season came
against the very same Washington State team
that challenged the Cardinal a week ago.
To be fair, Washington State has come a long
way since that disastrous loss in Pullman, and in
that same period, the Buffaloes have shown little
life. However, Stanford has consistently demon
strated that it can play down to competition.
With the exception of Cal, Stanford's road
games have been an adventure of offensive futil
ity Earlier this week, Coach Shaw indicated
Kevin Hogan will see more playing time, which
could help. Fortunately for the Cardinal, since
Colorado is so overmatched in this game, Hogan
won't have to be a miracle worker for Stanford
to get out of Boulder with a win. If Stanford exe
cutes even moderately well, it should be a long
afternoon for the Buffaloes, and here's why:
Colorado's Quarterback/Offensive Line
Issues
Stanford isn't the only team with a bit of a
quarterback controversy this week. Colorado
head coach Jon Embree declined to name a
starting quarterback for the Stanford game
at his weekly press conference.
The current starter, Kansas transfer
Jordan Webb, has been very disappointing.
Webb is completing just over 56 percent of his
passes with seven interceptions and only
eight touchdowns. Those numbers are not
good enough to win games in the Pac-12
unless, of course, you have Stanford's
defense.
The trouble for Colorado is that its back
ups might not be any better. Connor Wood
and Nick Hirschman, who both lost the com
petition to Webb earlier this year, have been
pretty bad in limited action. Neither has com
pleted more than 50 percent of his passes on
the year, an ugly sign even given the small
sample size.
The biggest disappointment of the unit
has to be Connor Wood. Wood originally
attended Texas but transferred after losing
out in that quarterback competition to David
Ash and Case McCoy Wood, a redshirt soph
omore who actually considered Stanford in
his initial recruiting and transfer search,
started the US Army All-America Bowl as a
senior in high school but just hasn't panned
out in the college game.
To be fair to all three quarterbacks, they
haven't been helped too much by Colorado's
offensive line. The Buffs have allowed 35
sacks, and with Stanford's aggressive front
seven coming to town it's hard to imagine a
scenario in which the starter doesn't end up
on his back for most of the afternoon. Even if
Stanford struggles offensively, I just can't
believe Colorado can survive the defensive
onslaught the Cardinal brings. And that
brings me to my defensive key: Continue get
ting good pressure and it won't matter who
plays quarterback.
Colorado's Porous Defense
For Colorado, it all starts with attacking
on the ground. The Buffs allow opponents an
average of 5.32 yards per carry and 204 yards
per game rushing. Those numbers are
absurd, and (though slightly inflated by some
great running offenses) signify a gaping hole
that Stanford should be able to exploit.
I know that I made a similar argument
last week about Washington State, which
ended up stopping Stepfan Taylor as well as
anybody. However, as bad as Washington
State's run defense was, Colorado's is still
much worse.
Amazingly, Colorado also allows over 300
yards per game through the ah: This comes
out to an average of 505 yards allowed per
game, and a very balanced attack by the
Buffs' opponents. Stanford has struggled
maintaining a balanced offense for much of
the season, but if there's any game to find a
remedy, Colorado's the choice.
The one caveat to all of these numbers is
that Stanford still has to execute. Against
Washington State, whose ran defense was
disastrous for much of the season, Stanford
could not move the ball. This came from a
combination of missed blocks and inability to
throw. Washington State's safeties were fly
ing to meet Stepfan Taylor in the backfield.
Stanford can't let Colorado or anyone else on
its schedule commit so strongly to stopping
the run.
That's where my wildcard, Kevin Hogan,
comes in. Teams are going to key in on Hogan
as more of a running quarterback, as Hogan's
only thrown the ball one time in his career.
However, Hogan has a great arm and the
ability to use it on the ran. Look for Hogan to
hit Colorado with a big play-action pass to
break open the game. Stanford needs just a
few key successful play-action plays to bring
the running game together. That's the key to
the offensive game plan to beat the Buffs.

If Kevin Hogan's first game with significant
playing time, goes well Sam will be picketing
Ike's to put a "Hogan Hoagie" on the menu.
