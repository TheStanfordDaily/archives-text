# OVERMATCHED
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRTIER 
A powerhouse in Div. I women's basketball,
Stanford is expected to take care of business
when playing Div. II Corban University, but
Thursday night's exhibition game at Maples
Pavilion was a matchup comparable to the
WNBA Sparks playing Palo Alto High as
Stanford took its first game of the season 117-
33.
Corban started the game with the energy
and excitement that should accompany a
matchup against such a notable team.
However, its confidence quickly waned as the
Cardinal's domination became too much to
handle. Corban shot only 27 percent from the
field and tallied 28 turnovers.
It was clear from the start that this year's
Cardinal squad was eager to start the season
and establish authority in its top-five ranking.
This is the fifth consecutive season that
Stanford has stalled the season ranked in the
top five.
Stanford's starting five comprised of soph
omores Taylor Greenfield and Amber
Orrange, juniors Chiney Ogwumike and Sara
James and senior Joslyn Tinkle, did not
include one of last season's major contributors
and starters, Junior Toni Kokenis, who wasn't
feeling well and did not see action in last
night's game. The rest of the team was able to
earn plenty of playing time, and the crowd was
introduced to freshmen Tess Picknell (eight
rebounds), Kiran Lakhian (three points) and
Denia Ebersole (1-1 free throws).
After sustaining injuries early last season
and missing the majority of the year, Mikaela
Ruef and Jasmine Camp were also able to get
their game legs back underneath them with
four assists each.
Coach Tara VanDerveer noted the impor
tance of giving different players more playing
experience early in the season.
"There were a lot of young people who had
a chance to get on the court, like our fresh
man," VanDerveer said. "But we also had a lot
of people out with injuries [last year], like
Jasmine Camp and Mikaela Ruef, that really
needed to just get a uniform back on. I think a
lot of people played really well, so it's about
getting confidence. I like playing in front of the
crowd and just getting the bugs out."
The Card took advantage of Corban's pas
sive defense and lit it up behind the three
point line, shooting an impressive 56 percent
from the perimeter. Sophomore forward
Bonnie Samuelson led the team with 27 points,
21 of which came from three pointers, and
seven rebounds off the bench. Stanford's
shooting ace from last season shot 7-for-12
from behind the arc and was 4-for-4 from the
free-throw line.

"It felt awesome," Samuelson said. "I got a
lot of shots off in the offseason and I'm ready
for the pressure. My coaches have a lot of con
fidence in me so that makes me confident [in
my shooting]. If they need me to go in for a few
minutes, I'm in there and I'll knock down a
shot or stay in there a little longer. I would love
to do that."
It was evident early on that Ogwumike was
the target of Corban's defense as foul after
foul was committed against her. Ogwumike,
however, maintained her composure and con
tinued to play aggressively on both ends of the
court. She finished her first game of the sea
son with 12 points and seven rebounds in only
16 minutes of game action.
VanDerveer emphasized earlier last week
the leadership position that Tinkle would have
to assume in order for the team to be success
ful this season. Tinkle filled that role immedi
ately at the start of the game with Stanford's
first basket of the season, playing 17 minutes
but contributing 15 points and four rebounds.
The confidence and energy that Tinkle
brought to the court was contagious, as
Cardinal players hustled all over the court and

dove for loose balls up until the end of the
game. The speed and quick hands of Orrange
were displayed with eight early steals, as she
turned in a well-rounded game with 10 points,
three rebounds and seven assists.
Orrange and her fellow sophomores are
expected to contribute greatly to this young
Stanford squad and did not disappoint last
night.
"Chiney and Joslyn, I know what to expect
from them because I've coached them for so
many years," VanDerveer said. "But I thought
Amber played really well, her defense got us
going. Bonnie came in and I know she can
make her shots, and she did, like last year. And
Sara looked so much more improved than last
year."
James was the second-leading scorer in the
game, with 24 points, three rebounds, and
three assists.
The Cardinal has another exhibition game
this Saturday at 2 p.m., when it will host
Vangaurd University.

tance of giving different players more playing
experience early in the season.
"There were a lot of young people who had
a chance to get on the court, like our fresh
man," VanDerveer said. "But we also had a lot
of people out with injuries [last year], like
Jasmine Camp and Mikaela Ruef, that really
needed to just get a uniform back on. I think a
lot of people played really well, so it's about
getting confidence. I like playing in front of the
crowd and just getting the bugs out."
The Card took advantage of Corban's pas
sive defense and lit it up behind the three
point line, shooting an impressive 56 percent
from the perimeter. Sophomore forward
Bonnie Samuelson led the team with 27 points,
21 of which came from three pointers, and
seven rebounds off the bench. Stanford's
shooting ace from last season shot 7-for-12
from behind the arc and was 4-for-4 from the
free-throw line.

"It felt awesome," Samuelson said. "I got a
lot of shots off in the offseason and I'm ready
for the pressure. My coaches have a lot of con
fidence in me so that makes me confident [in
my shooting]. If they need me to go in for a few
minutes, I'm in there and I'll knock down a
shot or stay in there a little longer. I would love
to do that."
It was evident early on that Ogwumike was
the target of Corban's defense as foul after
foul was committed against her. Ogwumike,
however, maintained her composure and con
tinued to play aggressively on both ends of the
court. She finished her first game of the sea
son with 12 points and seven rebounds in only
16 minutes of game action.
VanDerveer emphasized earlier last week
the leadership position that Tinkle would have
to assume in order for the team to be success
ful this season. Tinkle filled that role immedi
ately at the start of the game with Stanford's
first basket of the season, playing 17 minutes
but contributing 15 points and four rebounds.
The confidence and energy that Tinkle
brought to the court was contagious, as
Cardinal players hustled all over the court and

dove for loose balls up until the end of the
game. The speed and quick hands of Orrange
were displayed with eight early steals, as she
turned in a well-rounded game with 10 points,
three rebounds and seven assists.
Orrange and her fellow sophomores are
expected to contribute greatly to this young
Stanford squad and did not disappoint last
night.
"Chiney and Joslyn, I know what to expect
from them because I've coached them for so
many years," VanDerveer said. "But I thought
Amber played really well, her defense got us
going. Bonnie came in and I know she can
make her shots, and she did, like last year. And
Sara looked so much more improved than last
year."
James was the second-leading scorer in the
game, with 24 points, three rebounds, and
three assists.
The Cardinal has another exhibition game
this Saturday at 2 p.m., when it will host
Vangaurd University.

Shooting over the reach of an undersized Corban team, sophomore Bonnie Samuelson
drained a career-high seven three-pointers and finished with 27 points in the win.
A powerhouse in Div. I women's basketball,
Stanford is expected to take care of business
when playing Div. II Corban University, but
Thursday night's exhibition game at Maples
Pavilion was a matchup comparable to the
WNBA Sparks playing Palo Alto High as
Stanford took its first game of the season 117-
33.
Corban started the game with the energy
and excitement that should accompany a
matchup against such a notable team.
However, its confidence quickly waned as the
Cardinal's domination became too much to
handle. Corban shot only 27 percent from the
field and tallied 28 turnovers.
It was clear from the start that this year's
Cardinal squad was eager to start the season
and establish authority in its top-five ranking.
This is the fifth consecutive season that
Stanford has stalled the season ranked in the
top five.
Stanford's starting five comprised of soph
omores Taylor Greenfield and Amber
Orrange, juniors Chiney Ogwumike and Sara
James and senior Joslyn Tinkle, did not
include one of last season's major contributors
and starters, Junior Toni Kokenis, who wasn't
feeling well and did not see action in last
night's game. The rest of the team was able to
earn plenty of playing time, and the crowd was
introduced to freshmen Tess Picknell (eight
rebounds), Kiran Lakhian (three points) and
Denia Ebersole (1-1 free throws).
After sustaining injuries early last season
and missing the majority of the year, Mikaela
Ruef and Jasmine Camp were also able to get
their game legs back underneath them with
four assists each.
