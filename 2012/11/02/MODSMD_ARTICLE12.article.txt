# CARD IS ALMOST PERFECT

### KAMARIA TAYLOR 
The No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team
(16-1-1, 10-0-0 Pac-12) will head to the East
Bay this weekend to finish up the regular
season with a rivalry game against No. 23
Cal (15-4-0,8-2-0). Though it sealed its fourth
consecutive conference championship
against UCLA last Sunday, this weekend the
Cardinal hopes to complete another unde
feated Pac-12 campaign as well. Having
already won the Pac-12, however, Stanford
can partially turn its attention to the play
offs.
"Prom the beginning, our two big goals
were to win the Pac-12 league and then win
the national championship," said senior cap
tain and outside back Rachel Quon. "It's
obviously on the back of our mind that that's
our main goal, and it's getting close to that
time and this is where big teams play, and it's
time to step it up."
The Bears come into the game sitting in
third place in the Pac-12. They have suffered
only one loss in their past 10 matches, having
fallen to No. 2 UCLA on Friday, but Cal
responded with resolution and defeated
use.
Against the Trojans, the score remained
0-0 until the 74th minute when freshman
Ifeoma Onumonu put Cal ahead 1-0.
Onumonu's game winner against the Trojans
marked her team-leading 11th goal of the
season and cast a warning for Pac-12 teams
in the years to come.
The match against the Bruins on Friday
was more costly for the Golden Bears.
Though the score had also been tied 0-0 as
the teams went in for halftime, UCLA got in
position for the win by scoring a goal in the
49th minute. The Bruins assured their victo
ry with two more goals in the second half.
Stanford also traveled to Southern
California this weekend to face USC and
UCLA, but the trip proved more successful
for the Cardinal as they returned home with
two victories. On Friday, the team was pitted
against USC in a match that ultimately went
scoreless into overtime, but a 103 rd minute
goal from senior Alina Garciamendez gave
the Cardinal the sudden-death decision.
Had Stanford lost against USC, it would
not have been able to claim its fourth Pac-12
title at the Drake Stadium against UCLA
last Sunday. In fact, Stanford almost left Los
Angeles without the title after going down 1-
0 at the start of the second half. Still, two late

goals within 72 seconds from sophomore
Chioma Ãœbogagu and Quon put the Card
ahead and won the team the title.
After the trip to Los Angeles, Quon and
redshirt junior goalkeeper Emily Oliver
respectively earned offensive and defensive
Pac-12 Player of the Week honors. Oliver
made a total 13 saves during the two games
and allowed only one goal against two of the
league's top scoring teams. Quon is now a
four-year starter and has notched five goals
and 19 assists during her Stanford career.
She provided the extra-time assist against
USC with a set piece to Garciamendez and
scored the 79th-minute winner against
UCLA. Her contributions will likely prove
vital yet again at Cal.

Like any rivalry game, the team is
expecting a tough battle that will require
plenty of attention and effort, particularly if
it is to acquire the top seed for tournament
play. With the playoffs fast approaching, the
team cannot afford to slow down.
"I think we can always improve," head
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "We need to keep
growing as a team and improving all aspects
of our game, and it's going to be important to
stay healthy and to stay sharp and keep
building on our confidence."
The Cardinal faces off against the Bears
Sunday at 11 a.m. at Edwards Stadium.
