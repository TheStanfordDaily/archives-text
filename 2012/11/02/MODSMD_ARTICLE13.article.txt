## SEEING GREEN Shelter from the Storm 
### Holly Moeller 
Four days after Hurricane
Sandy slammed into New
Jersey, I still haven't heard
from my dad.
He's a "no news is good news"
kind of guy, and my hometown is
sufficiently far from the coast that
I'm not too worried. Still, he
undoubtedly lost power and there
fore cell phone service at some
point when the "Frankenstorm"
passed through the region. I'm just
hoping a tree didn't fall through the
roof in the process.
Sandy, a freak weather hybrid
built from a hurricane traveling
north and a cold front traveling
east, knocked out power for mil
lions, decimated the New York and
New Jersey public transportation
systems, and produced 20-foot
waves on Lake Michigan.
But perhaps the most dramatic
imagery of the storm's effects came
from the Atlantic coastline, where a
full moon's high tides amplified the
storm surge, putting huge swaths of
expensive shorefront property
under water. Looking at the slowly
draining streets, 100-foot gaps in
boardwalks, and crumpled homes,
we're forced to remember just how
fragile our grip on the coastline can
be.
Why, then, do we perch our
major cities and our prized vacation
homes at the perilous boundary
between land and sea?
In part, we build on the coasts,
particularly in more sheltered
areas, for practical reasons: this
was where, centuries ago, we came
ashore as colonists. This was where
we launched (and still launch) ships
loaded with goods bound for foreign
markets.
And then, of course, there are
aesthetic reasons. We have salt
water in our veins. Perhaps some
deeply seated part of our biology
recalls our oceanic ancestors. Or
perhaps we crave the restorative
properties of salt air, or the per
spective granted by the rugged
power of the waves.
Unfortunately, as we expand and
perch more structures and more
investment along the coastline, we
also undermine our natural buffers
against disasters like Hurricane
Sandy.
My home state is the perfect
example. Much of New Jersey's
coast has long been protected natu
rally by a string of barrier islands
that are essentially large sand
dunes a couple of miles out to sea.
The islands, which bear the brunt of
storm fronts coming through, are
backed by relatively calm bays and
expansive salt marshes that inci
dentally, provide temporary hous
ing for millions of migratory birds
(and permanent housing for lots of
other biodiversity) twice a year.
Today, rather than semi-perma
nent lines of dunes drifting slowly
northward with the prevailing cur
rents, these barrier islands are
home to the casinos of Atlantic City,
endless lines of pastel-colored vaca
tion rentals and countless rock jet
ties intended (but failing) to pin the
sand in place. Only a few spots, like
state parks and old military pre
serves, still capture the iconic,
dune-grass-covered, bayberry
scented scene that once prevailed

along the eastern seaboard.
We've also lost plenty of wet
lands but that's hardly a purely
New Jersey phenomenon. Across
the country, we've "reclaimed" half
of our marshy areas; here in
California, we've destroyed 90% of
them. Tremblingly, like the barrier
islands which intercept storm
surges and huge waves, wetlands
buffer us against changes in water
level by sponging up overflow that,
in their absence, floods roads and
punctures dams.
Beyond their protective role,
wetlands provide other services to
us, from hours of entertainment for
birdwatchers, to nursery grounds
for baby fish, to filtration of pollu
tants and even to natural "lazy
river" rides, if you time the tides
right on broader inlets. And yet, we
habitually fail to respect them,
choosing instead to drain the land
for other uses.
Perhaps our shifting climate will
yet remind us of the valuable assets
we've paved over. Though no sci
ence, not even the best climate
model, is set in stone, we do know
that warm surface ocean waters
(which will become more common
on a warmer planet) probably
helped spur Sandy on to her East
Coast rendezvous. And this year's
dramatic Arctic sea ice minimum
might have influenced the stalled
air masses over Greenland that
pushed Sandy inland. But most
importantly, because warmer air
temperatures mean warmer sea
temperatures, and warmed water,
just like warmed air, expands, sea
level rise will bring storm surges
that much higher. Each new storm
will flood more homes and subway
lines, driving us further back from
the coastline.
In some places, the storms will
scrub our imprint from the land.
The sand scoured from New
Jersey's beaches will come to rest
on a new shore. Another little girl
will walk with her father at the edge
of the sea, carefully skirting the
newly established dune grasses at
his gentle insistence.

And then, of course, there are
aesthetic reasons. We have salt
water in our veins. Perhaps some
deeply seated part of our biology
recalls our oceanic ancestors. Or
perhaps we crave the restorative
properties of salt air, or the per
spective granted by the rugged
power of the waves.
Unfortunately, as we expand and
perch more structures and more
investment along the coastline, we
also undermine our natural buffers
against disasters like Hurricane
Sandy.
My home state is the perfect
example. Much of New Jersey's
coast has long been protected natu
rally by a string of barrier islands
that are essentially large sand
dunes a couple of miles out to sea.
The islands, which bear the brunt of
storm fronts coming through, are
backed by relatively calm bays and
expansive salt marshes that inci
dentally, provide temporary hous
ing for millions of migratory birds
(and permanent housing for lots of
other biodiversity) twice a year.
Today, rather than semi-perma
nent lines of dunes drifting slowly
northward with the prevailing cur
rents, these barrier islands are
home to the casinos of Atlantic City,
endless lines of pastel-colored vaca
tion rentals and countless rock jet
ties intended (but failing) to pin the
sand in place. Only a few spots, like
state parks and old military pre
serves, still capture the iconic,
dune-grass-covered, bayberry
scented scene that once prevailed

along the eastern seaboard.
We've also lost plenty of wet
lands but that's hardly a purely
New Jersey phenomenon. Across
the country, we've "reclaimed" half
of our marshy areas; here in
California, we've destroyed 90% of
them. Tremblingly, like the barrier
islands which intercept storm
surges and huge waves, wetlands
buffer us against changes in water
level by sponging up overflow that,
in their absence, floods roads and
punctures dams.
Beyond their protective role,
wetlands provide other services to
us, from hours of entertainment for
birdwatchers, to nursery grounds
for baby fish, to filtration of pollu
tants and even to natural "lazy
river" rides, if you time the tides
right on broader inlets. And yet, we
habitually fail to respect them,
choosing instead to drain the land
for other uses.
Perhaps our shifting climate will
yet remind us of the valuable assets
we've paved over. Though no sci
ence, not even the best climate
model, is set in stone, we do know
that warm surface ocean waters
(which will become more common
on a warmer planet) probably
helped spur Sandy on to her East
Coast rendezvous. And this year's
dramatic Arctic sea ice minimum
might have influenced the stalled
air masses over Greenland that
pushed Sandy inland. But most
importantly, because warmer air
temperatures mean warmer sea
temperatures, and warmed water,
just like warmed air, expands, sea
level rise will bring storm surges
that much higher. Each new storm
will flood more homes and subway
lines, driving us further back from
the coastline.
In some places, the storms will
scrub our imprint from the land.
The sand scoured from New
Jersey's beaches will come to rest
on a new shore. Another little girl
will walk with her father at the edge
of the sea, carefully skirting the
newly established dune grasses at
his gentle insistence.

Four days after Hurricane
Sandy slammed into New
Jersey, I still haven't heard
from my dad.
He's a "no news is good news"
kind of guy, and my hometown is
sufficiently far from the coast that
I'm not too worried. Still, he
undoubtedly lost power and there
fore cell phone service at some
point when the "Frankenstorm"
passed through the region. I'm just
hoping a tree didn't fall through the
roof in the process.
Sandy, a freak weather hybrid
built from a hurricane traveling
north and a cold front traveling
east, knocked out power for mil
lions, decimated the New York and
New Jersey public transportation
systems, and produced 20-foot
waves on Lake Michigan.
But perhaps the most dramatic
imagery of the storm's effects came
from the Atlantic coastline, where a
full moon's high tides amplified the
storm surge, putting huge swaths of
expensive shorefront property
under water. Looking at the slowly
draining streets, 100-foot gaps in
boardwalks, and crumpled homes,
we're forced to remember just how
fragile our grip on the coastline can
be.
Why, then, do we perch our
major cities and our prized vacation
homes at the perilous boundary
between land and sea?
In part, we build on the coasts,
particularly in more sheltered
areas, for practical reasons: this
was where, centuries ago, we came
ashore as colonists. This was where
we launched (and still launch) ships
loaded with goods bound for foreign
markets.
And then, of course, there are
aesthetic reasons. We have salt
water in our veins. Perhaps some
deeply seated part of our biology
recalls our oceanic ancestors. Or
perhaps we crave the restorative
properties of salt air, or the per
spective granted by the rugged
