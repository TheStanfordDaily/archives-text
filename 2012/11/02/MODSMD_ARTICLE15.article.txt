Down goes the plate steaming
with spaghetti. Grace.
Someone say grace. We hold
hands. We close our eyes. I eye my
spaghetti. Amen. My fellow diners
gracefully pluck their forks and
knives in between thumb and point

over a lukewarm burger.
For my dad and I, eating was like
island-hopping. We were more like a
pair of tourists than a couple of din
