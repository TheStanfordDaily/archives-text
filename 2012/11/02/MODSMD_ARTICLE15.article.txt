# Adventures in Food
## 
### Alex Bayer 
Down goes the plate steaming
with spaghetti. Grace.
Someone say grace. We hold
hands. We close our eyes. I eye my
spaghetti. Amen. My fellow diners
gracefully pluck their forks and
knives in between thumb and point
er finger. "How was your day,
honey?" she asks. Not to me,
because this isn't my house. "School
was all right..." my friend begins.
This is my chance. I plunge fork into
noodle. Four minutes in I'm done. I
look up. My friend is looking over at
me, slightly horrified. That fork is
still daintily pressed between her
fingers and a single, sinewy
spaghetti strand is curled in it, the
same piece of spaghetti, I think, she

had four minutes ago.
My relationship with what I eat
is at a complicated impasse. I have
never known what it's like to sit
down at a dinner table at 6 p.m.
Whenever I sit down to eat at a
friend's house I feel like a bear sit
ting at a table of humans, unsure of
the etiquette in this neck of the
woods. Don't get me wrong. It's a
lovely experience, but one I came to
appreciate a little too late. By now
my concept of restraint has already
been molded into the tiniest of
Pillsbury dough balls.
My parents divorced young
enough that my only memory of a
meal shared between us was at a
gloomy, poorly lit restaurant. The

mood had already been set: we had
just driven three hours through
Northern Connecticut to get to Six
Flags, and it was closed. Closed.
Something about thunderstorms.
This, and my parents already
resented each other. Forget conver
sation. The best you could ask for
was a word or two muttered bitterly
over a lukewarm burger.
For my dad and I, eating was like
island-hopping. We were more like a
pair of tourists than a couple of din
ers. You know that lonely pair you
see through the window at a Thai
restaurant on Tuesday night at 10?
Yeah, that was us, hunched over
soft-shell crab, speaking in spurts of
soft-spoken conversation. For some
reason we could hold a real conver
sation here. At home, it was a differ
ent story. We failed at making con
versation. "How was your day?" "It
was okay." We gave the routine our
best shot, but our eyes were already
preparing for the impending migra
tion. Down our gazes went, back to
our plates and then the copy of
Time. My dad always felt guilty
about not making dinner more
often, but I really didn't mind.
Eating for us was a solitary pleas
ure, one spent hunched over a mag
azine instead of words that to us felt
empty.
I love food madly. I love and hate
it. You know the drill. For girls my
age, Venus is a lanky fourteen-year
old Teen Vogue model. It doesn't
matter how ideologically I abhor
beauty ideals; I see this girl every
where, and in every smoky-eyed
perfume ad she is equated with
beauty, romance and happiness. The
road to real self-acceptance is such a
daunting journey; zero percent
body fat is quicker. Last year I
would go on these stupid yo-yo
diets. I would eliminate carbs
bread, sugar, fruit and then rav
ished, I would eat everything in the
kitchen I'd been salivating over for
the last week and boom, it's all back.
I'm back to square one and utterly
contemptuous of my measly
willpower. A day later I realize how
unwise it was to do such a thing to
my body, until I get to feeling my
curves and dreams of thin limbs
haunt me once again.
I read about food like a fanboy.
There's an interesting article in The
New York Times about the diet
company Jenny Craig. They were
trying to export the brand to Prance
and having a hard time. Valerie
Bignon is a French woman and a
director at Nestle France, which is
overseeing the Gallicization of
Jenny Craig. "If I were the minister
of health in America and I was in
charge of the battle against obesity,"
she says in the article, "the most
powerful, brilliant thing I could do
would be to communicate this mes

sage: let's not worry too much about
what's on the table. I'd say let's con
cern ourselves with sitting at the
table together and preparing a
meal." Her point is this: America's
approach to food is individualistic as
opposed to social. In Prance, the
notion of to-go food or even self
serve is anathema. On the other
hand, when you sit down at the table
and have a well-rounded, quality
meal, there's little impetus to snack
throughout the day. Plus, she says,
the presence of others reinforces
healthy eating habits like "helping
yourself to only so much" and "the
habit of discipline and moderation,"
lessons that were largely absent in
my single-parent adolescence.
A second article I recently read
at first sounded too good to be true.
This also came from The New York
Times, and it was about Ikaria, a
sleepy Greek isle whose inhabitants
live remarkably long, many of them
past a hundred. Not only that, but
the quality of their lives is enviable;
it's not unusual to see a centenarian
gossiping over a glass of wine with
old friends come evening. As in
Prance, part of the secret is what
they eat: vegetables, bread, goat's
milk, honey, wine, herbal tea. All of
it is grown and produced on the
island. Experts also point out that
the typical Mediterranean diet is
high in antioxidants and low in satu
rated fats, among other plusses.
The other part of the equation,
as in Prance as well, is the social cul
ture around food. In Ikaria, the
most available foods are also the
healthiest. When your neighbors
come over, they'll bring over vegeta
bles from their garden, tea, or wine,
not a casserole. It is not uncommon
to spend an evening with friends,
chatting for hours over a couple
glasses of wine. Your closest friends,
family, neighbors essentially,
every single person around you
reinforces this healthy eating style.
Consider this excerpt from the arti
cle about Seventh-day Adventists,
who eat a plant-based diet:
"Adventists hang out with other
Adventists. When you go to an
Adventist picnic, there's no steak
grilling on the barbecue; it's a vege
tarian potluck. No one is drinking
alcohol or smoking." Furthermore,
'As Nicholas Christakis, a physician
and social scientist at Harvard,
found when examining data from a

long-term study of the residents of
Framingham, Mass., health habits
can be as contagious as a cold virus.
By his calculation, a Framingham
individual's chances of becoming
obese shot up by 57 percent if a
friend became obese. Among the
Adventists we looked at, it was
mostly positive social contagions
that were in circulation."
On the other hand, in main
stream America, we're tantalized by
junk food on a regular basis. You
can't buy a bottle of shampoo at
CYS without passing a display box
full of candy placed ingeniously next
to the register. The great thing about
living in a co-op like Columbae is that
the kitchen is full of fresh produce.
We sit down and eat dinner together.
But as soon as I leave the premises,
it's back to the status quo. I can't get
a cup of coffee without staring down
a tray of cake pops.
In the U.S., there's a multi-bil
lion dollar industry devoted to diet
ing. Companies like Weight
Watchers and Jenny Craig tend to
focus exclusively on what we eat or
how much of it. Obediently, we com
partmentalize an hour of exercise
into our schedules. For a typical
America, weight management is
nothing if it's not a science. It is an
equation, and its units are calories; a
deficit of calories results in less fat,
and if perfume ads are to be
believed, that damned elusive con
tentment.
Sooner or later, having quietly
pined over a hundred bags of Rolos,
I'm going to cave. It'll be back to the
drawing board of self-loathing, and
then one more stab at it. Fighting
the American culinary status quo is
a difficult mission because we are by
nature influenced by the culture
that surrounds us. I swore off fries
and fast food long ago, but I still
struggle with moderation. Quinoa
and lentils are tasty, but that pack of
Sour Punch Straws at the conces
sion stand looks mighty delicious. If
I have five minutes to get to class
thanks to my self-torturous twenty
units, am I more likely to make an
egg scramble or grab a to-go bar?
What's in our food is an important
question, one I'm glad we're asking.
But how we eat may be just as cru
cial, if not more so.

meal." Her point is this: America's
approach to food is individualistic as
opposed to social. In Prance, the
notion of to-go food or even self
serve is anathema. On the other
hand, when you sit down at the table
and have a well-rounded, quality
meal, there's little impetus to snack
throughout the day. Plus, she says,
the presence of others reinforces
healthy eating habits like "helping
yourself to only so much" and "the
habit of discipline and moderation,"
lessons that were largely absent in
my single-parent adolescence.
A second article I recently read
at first sounded too good to be true.
This also came from The New York
Times, and it was about Ikaria, a
sleepy Greek isle whose inhabitants
live remarkably long, many of them
past a hundred. Not only that, but
the quality of their lives is enviable;
it's not unusual to see a centenarian
gossiping over a glass of wine with
old friends come evening. As in
Prance, part of the secret is what
they eat: vegetables, bread, goat's
milk, honey, wine, herbal tea. All of
it is grown and produced on the
island. Experts also point out that
the typical Mediterranean diet is
high in antioxidants and low in satu
rated fats, among other plusses.
The other part of the equation,
as in Prance as well, is the social cul
ture around food. In Ikaria, the
most available foods are also the
healthiest. When your neighbors
come over, they'll bring over vegeta
bles from their garden, tea, or wine,
not a casserole. It is not uncommon
to spend an evening with friends,
chatting for hours over a couple
glasses of wine. Your closest friends,
family, neighbors essentially,
every single person around you
reinforces this healthy eating style.
Consider this excerpt from the arti
cle about Seventh-day Adventists,
who eat a plant-based diet:
"Adventists hang out with other
Adventists. When you go to an
Adventist picnic, there's no steak
grilling on the barbecue; it's a vege
tarian potluck. No one is drinking
alcohol or smoking." Furthermore,
'As Nicholas Christakis, a physician
and social scientist at Harvard,
found when examining data from a

long-term study of the residents of
Framingham, Mass., health habits
can be as contagious as a cold virus.
By his calculation, a Framingham
individual's chances of becoming
obese shot up by 57 percent if a
friend became obese. Among the
Adventists we looked at, it was
mostly positive social contagions
that were in circulation."
On the other hand, in main
stream America, we're tantalized by
junk food on a regular basis. You
can't buy a bottle of shampoo at
CYS without passing a display box
full of candy placed ingeniously next
to the register. The great thing about
living in a co-op like Columbae is that
the kitchen is full of fresh produce.
We sit down and eat dinner together.
But as soon as I leave the premises,
it's back to the status quo. I can't get
a cup of coffee without staring down
a tray of cake pops.
In the U.S., there's a multi-bil
lion dollar industry devoted to diet
ing. Companies like Weight
Watchers and Jenny Craig tend to
focus exclusively on what we eat or
how much of it. Obediently, we com
partmentalize an hour of exercise
into our schedules. For a typical
America, weight management is
nothing if it's not a science. It is an
equation, and its units are calories; a
deficit of calories results in less fat,
and if perfume ads are to be
believed, that damned elusive con
tentment.
Sooner or later, having quietly
pined over a hundred bags of Rolos,
I'm going to cave. It'll be back to the
drawing board of self-loathing, and
then one more stab at it. Fighting
the American culinary status quo is
a difficult mission because we are by
nature influenced by the culture
that surrounds us. I swore off fries
and fast food long ago, but I still
struggle with moderation. Quinoa
and lentils are tasty, but that pack of
Sour Punch Straws at the conces
sion stand looks mighty delicious. If
I have five minutes to get to class
thanks to my self-torturous twenty
units, am I more likely to make an
egg scramble or grab a to-go bar?
What's in our food is an important
question, one I'm glad we're asking.
But how we eat may be just as cru
cial, if not more so.

Down goes the plate steaming
with spaghetti. Grace.
Someone say grace. We hold
hands. We close our eyes. I eye my
spaghetti. Amen. My fellow diners
gracefully pluck their forks and
knives in between thumb and point
er finger. "How was your day,
honey?" she asks. Not to me,
because this isn't my house. "School
was all right..." my friend begins.
This is my chance. I plunge fork into
noodle. Four minutes in I'm done. I
look up. My friend is looking over at
me, slightly horrified. That fork is
still daintily pressed between her
fingers and a single, sinewy
spaghetti strand is curled in it, the
same piece of spaghetti, I think, she

had four minutes ago.
My relationship with what I eat
is at a complicated impasse. I have
never known what it's like to sit
down at a dinner table at 6 p.m.
Whenever I sit down to eat at a
friend's house I feel like a bear sit
ting at a table of humans, unsure of
the etiquette in this neck of the
woods. Don't get me wrong. It's a
lovely experience, but one I came to
appreciate a little too late. By now
my concept of restraint has already
been molded into the tiniest of
Pillsbury dough balls.
My parents divorced young
enough that my only memory of a
meal shared between us was at a
gloomy, poorly lit restaurant. The

mood had already been set: we had
just driven three hours through
Northern Connecticut to get to Six
Flags, and it was closed. Closed.
Something about thunderstorms.
This, and my parents already
resented each other. Forget conver
sation. The best you could ask for
was a word or two muttered bitterly
over a lukewarm burger.
For my dad and I, eating was like
island-hopping. We were more like a
pair of tourists than a couple of din
ers. You know that lonely pair you
see through the window at a Thai
restaurant on Tuesday night at 10?
Yeah, that was us, hunched over
soft-shell crab, speaking in spurts of
soft-spoken conversation. For some
reason we could hold a real conver
sation here. At home, it was a differ
ent story. We failed at making con
versation. "How was your day?" "It
was okay." We gave the routine our
best shot, but our eyes were already
preparing for the impending migra
tion. Down our gazes went, back to
our plates and then the copy of
Time. My dad always felt guilty
about not making dinner more
often, but I really didn't mind.
Eating for us was a solitary pleas
ure, one spent hunched over a mag
azine instead of words that to us felt
empty.
I love food madly. I love and hate
it. You know the drill. For girls my
age, Venus is a lanky fourteen-year
old Teen Vogue model. It doesn't
matter how ideologically I abhor
beauty ideals; I see this girl every
where, and in every smoky-eyed
perfume ad she is equated with
beauty, romance and happiness. The
road to real self-acceptance is such a
daunting journey; zero percent
body fat is quicker. Last year I
would go on these stupid yo-yo
diets. I would eliminate carbs
bread, sugar, fruit and then rav
ished, I would eat everything in the
kitchen I'd been salivating over for
the last week and boom, it's all back.
I'm back to square one and utterly
contemptuous of my measly
willpower. A day later I realize how
unwise it was to do such a thing to
my body, until I get to feeling my
curves and dreams of thin limbs
haunt me once again.
I read about food like a fanboy.
There's an interesting article in The
New York Times about the diet
company Jenny Craig. They were
trying to export the brand to Prance
and having a hard time. Valerie
Bignon is a French woman and a
director at Nestle France, which is
overseeing the Gallicization of
Jenny Craig. "If I were the minister
of health in America and I was in
charge of the battle against obesity,"
she says in the article, "the most
powerful, brilliant thing I could do
would be to communicate this mes

sage: let's not worry too much about
what's on the table. I'd say let's con
cern ourselves with sitting at the
table together and preparing a
meal." Her point is this: America's
approach to food is individualistic as
opposed to social. In Prance, the

What's in our food is an important
question, one I'm glad we're asking.
But how we eat may be just as cru
cial, if not more so.

Down goes the plate steaming
with spaghetti. Grace.
Someone say grace. We hold
hands. We close our eyes. I eye my
spaghetti. Amen. My fellow diners
gracefully pluck their forks and
knives in between thumb and point
er finger. "How was your day,
honey?" she asks. Not to me,
because this isn't my house. "School
was all right..." my friend begins.
This is my chance. I plunge fork into
noodle. Four minutes in I'm done. I
look up. My friend is looking over at
me, slightly horrified. That fork is
still daintily pressed between her
fingers and a single, sinewy
spaghetti strand is curled in it, the
same piece of spaghetti, I think, she

had four minutes ago.
My relationship with what I eat
is at a complicated impasse. I have
never known what it's like to sit
down at a dinner table at 6 p.m.
Whenever I sit down to eat at a
friend's house I feel like a bear sit
ting at a table of humans, unsure of
the etiquette in this neck of the
woods. Don't get me wrong. It's a
lovely experience, but one I came to
appreciate a little too late. By now
my concept of restraint has already
been molded into the tiniest of
Pillsbury dough balls.
My parents divorced young
enough that my only memory of a
meal shared between us was at a
gloomy, poorly lit restaurant. The

mood had already been set: we had
just driven three hours through
Northern Connecticut to get to Six
Flags, and it was closed. Closed.
Something about thunderstorms.
This, and my parents already
resented each other. Forget conver
sation. The best you could ask for
was a word or two muttered bitterly
over a lukewarm burger.
For my dad and I, eating was like
island-hopping. We were more like a
pair of tourists than a couple of din
ers. You know that lonely pair you
see through the window at a Thai
restaurant on Tuesday night at 10?
Yeah, that was us, hunched over
soft-shell crab, speaking in spurts of
soft-spoken conversation. For some
reason we could hold a real conver
sation here. At home, it was a differ
ent story. We failed at making con
versation. "How was your day?" "It
was okay." We gave the routine our
best shot, but our eyes were already
preparing for the impending migra
tion. Down our gazes went, back to
our plates and then the copy of
Time. My dad always felt guilty
about not making dinner more
often, but I really didn't mind.
Eating for us was a solitary pleas
ure, one spent hunched over a mag
azine instead of words that to us felt
empty.
I love food madly. I love and hate
it. You know the drill. For girls my
age, Venus is a lanky fourteen-year
old Teen Vogue model. It doesn't
matter how ideologically I abhor
beauty ideals; I see this girl every
where, and in every smoky-eyed
perfume ad she is equated with
beauty, romance and happiness. The
road to real self-acceptance is such a
daunting journey; zero percent
body fat is quicker. Last year I
would go on these stupid yo-yo
diets. I would eliminate carbs
bread, sugar, fruit and then rav
ished, I would eat everything in the
kitchen I'd been salivating over for
the last week and boom, it's all back.
I'm back to square one and utterly
contemptuous of my measly
willpower. A day later I realize how
unwise it was to do such a thing to
my body, until I get to feeling my
curves and dreams of thin limbs
haunt me once again.
I read about food like a fanboy.
There's an interesting article in The
New York Times about the diet
company Jenny Craig. They were
trying to export the brand to Prance
and having a hard time. Valerie
Bignon is a French woman and a
director at Nestle France, which is
overseeing the Gallicization of
Jenny Craig. "If I were the minister
of health in America and I was in
charge of the battle against obesity,"
she says in the article, "the most
powerful, brilliant thing I could do
would be to communicate this mes

sage: let's not worry too much about
what's on the table. I'd say let's con
cern ourselves with sitting at the
table together and preparing a
meal." Her point is this: America's
approach to food is individualistic as
opposed to social. In Prance, the
notion of to-go food or even self
serve is anathema. On the other
hand, when you sit down at the table
and have a well-rounded, quality
meal, there's little impetus to snack
throughout the day. Plus, she says,
the presence of others reinforces
healthy eating habits like "helping
yourself to only so much" and "the
habit of discipline and moderation,"
lessons that were largely absent in
my single-parent adolescence.
A second article I recently read
at first sounded too good to be true.
This also came from The New York
Times, and it was about Ikaria, a
sleepy Greek isle whose inhabitants
live remarkably long, many of them
past a hundred. Not only that, but
the quality of their lives is enviable;
it's not unusual to see a centenarian
gossiping over a glass of wine with
old friends come evening. As in
Prance, part of the secret is what
they eat: vegetables, bread, goat's
milk, honey, wine, herbal tea. All of
it is grown and produced on the
island. Experts also point out that
the typical Mediterranean diet is
high in antioxidants and low in satu
rated fats, among other plusses.
The other part of the equation,
as in Prance as well, is the social cul
ture around food. In Ikaria, the
most available foods are also the
healthiest. When your neighbors
come over, they'll bring over vegeta
bles from their garden, tea, or wine,
not a casserole. It is not uncommon
to spend an evening with friends,
chatting for hours over a couple
glasses of wine. Your closest friends,
family, neighbors essentially,
every single person around you
reinforces this healthy eating style.
Consider this excerpt from the arti
cle about Seventh-day Adventists,
who eat a plant-based diet:
"Adventists hang out with other
Adventists. When you go to an
Adventist picnic, there's no steak
grilling on the barbecue; it's a vege
tarian potluck. No one is drinking
alcohol or smoking." Furthermore,
'As Nicholas Christakis, a physician
and social scientist at Harvard,
found when examining data from a

long-term study of the residents of
Framingham, Mass., health habits
can be as contagious as a cold virus.
By his calculation, a Framingham
individual's chances of becoming
obese shot up by 57 percent if a
friend became obese. Among the
Adventists we looked at, it was
mostly positive social contagions
that were in circulation."
On the other hand, in main
stream America, we're tantalized by
junk food on a regular basis. You
can't buy a bottle of shampoo at
CYS without passing a display box
full of candy placed ingeniously next
to the register. The great thing about
living in a co-op like Columbae is that
the kitchen is full of fresh produce.
We sit down and eat dinner together.
But as soon as I leave the premises,
it's back to the status quo. I can't get
a cup of coffee without staring down
a tray of cake pops.
In the U.S., there's a multi-bil
lion dollar industry devoted to diet
ing. Companies like Weight
Watchers and Jenny Craig tend to
focus exclusively on what we eat or
how much of it. Obediently, we com
partmentalize an hour of exercise
into our schedules. For a typical
America, weight management is
nothing if it's not a science. It is an
equation, and its units are calories; a
deficit of calories results in less fat,
and if perfume ads are to be
believed, that damned elusive con
tentment.
Sooner or later, having quietly
pined over a hundred bags of Rolos,
I'm going to cave. It'll be back to the
drawing board of self-loathing, and
then one more stab at it. Fighting
the American culinary status quo is
a difficult mission because we are by
nature influenced by the culture
that surrounds us. I swore off fries
and fast food long ago, but I still
struggle with moderation. Quinoa
and lentils are tasty, but that pack of
Sour Punch Straws at the conces
sion stand looks mighty delicious. If
I have five minutes to get to class
thanks to my self-torturous twenty
units, am I more likely to make an
egg scramble or grab a to-go bar?
What's in our food is an important
question, one I'm glad we're asking.
But how we eat may be just as cru
cial, if not more so.
