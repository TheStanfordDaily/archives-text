# OP-ED
## Stanford should think twice before lowering evidentiary standard 
### JOSEPH COHN, legislative policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education GREG LUKIANOFF J.D. '00, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education 
Since November 2011, accusations of
sexual misconduct at Stanford
University have been adjudicated
under a temporary "Alternate Review
Process" (ARP) that reduces the standard
of evidence from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to the lower "preponderance of the
evidence." The current standard is, in other
words, "more likely than not," or with
50.01% certainty. As The Daily's readers
undoubtedly know, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council are considering changing
the university's charter (which requires the
higher standard) in order to adopt the ARP
permanently. Doing so would be a mistake.
Advocates for the preponderance stan
dard argue that sexual misconduct is com
monplace at universities, including
Stanford, in part because victims of sexual
misconduct allegedly do not receive a fail
shot at proving their claims when the bur
den of proof requires more than 50.01% cer
tainty. As a result, these advocates argue,
victims choose not to bring claims forward
at all.
This argument may be attractive, but it
does not withstand scrutiny.
There is no doubt that sexual misconduct
occurs on campus and must always be taken

seriously. Data suggests that sexual crimes
are often underreported, perhaps because
of victims' perceptions that their complaints
will be ignored. But a university that pro
vides immediate support to every alleged
victim, conducts a prompt and thorough
investigation, and provides a fair hearing to
the accused even one employing a higher
burden of proof is in no way ignoring a
victim's allegation. There need be no ten
sion between a university's moral and legal
obligation to respond to every allegation of
sexual misconduct in a prompt, thorough
way and the corresponding obligation to
ensure that accused students receive appro
priate due process protections.
Nevertheless, preponderance advocates
insist that high standards of proof are to
blame for the underreporting. This is a sim
ple narrative, but likely untrue. Some col
leges have been using the preponderance
standard for years, yet advocates have pro
vided no evidence that reporting statistics
at those schools are distinguishable from
those at institutions employing higher bur
dens of proof.
Even apart from the question of report
ing, the fundamental problem with employ-
ing the preponderance of the evi
dence standard to adjudicate sexu
al misconduct allegations is that
punishing a student because a fact
finder thought that they were
50.01% likely to be guilty
indeed, finding that the accused
was a mere .01% more likely than
not to be responsible offends
our time-honored conception of
justice. After all, there is scarcely
any difference in believing that an
accusation is 49.99% likely to be
true and believing that it is 50.01%
likely to be true. The difference is
so insignificant that for all practical
purposes, it amounts to just a
hunch that the accused is guilty.
Long-established principles of jus
tice demand a system where more
than a hunch is required before
imposing life-altering discipline.
Compounding the problem fur
ther, Stanford fails to define sexual
harassment in a manner consistent
with Supreme Court precedent
aimed at ensuring that protected
speech isn't swept into the defini
tion. A vague definition of sexual
harassment and a low burden of
proof is a proven recipe for error.
The problems with preponder
ance are amplified because there
are few additional safeguards to
ensure that findings are reliable.
Unlike courts, where there are

many protections provided to
ensure basic fairness, like the right
to counsel, rules of evidence
excluding irrelevant testimony and
hearsay, discovery, witnesses
under oath subject to perjury
charges if they lie and so forth, the
campus judiciary's most meaning
ful procedural protection is the
burden of proof. Gutting that safe
guard invites injustice.
Some argue that Stanford must
make this change or it will lose fed
eral funding. While it is true that
the Department of Education's
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) may
try to strip Stanford of its funding
if it does not fall in line, it is hardly
likely that the OCR would prevail.
Remember, nothing in Title IX
mandates the preponderance stan
dard. Stanford owes it to its stu
dents to decide for itself what sys
tem best protects their interests.
The only system of justice that is in
the student body's best interest is
one that produces trustworthy,
reliable findings of guilt and inno
cence. The preponderance stan
dard, especially when implemented
without meaningful due process
protections, requires less certainty
and thus fails that crucial test.
