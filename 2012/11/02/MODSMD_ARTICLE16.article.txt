## Stanford should think twice before lowering evidentiary standard

Since November 2011, accusations of
sexual misconduct at Stanford
University have been adjudicated
under a temporary "Alternate Review
Process" (ARP) that reduces the standard
of evidence from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to the lower "preponderance of the
evidence." The current standard is, in other
words, "more likely than not," or with
50.01% certainty. As The Daily's readers
undoubtedly know, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and Graduate
Student Council are considering changing
the university's charter (which requires the
higher standard) in order to adopt the ARP
permanently. Doing so would be a mistake.
Advocates for the preponderance stan
dard argue that sexual misconduct is com
monplace at universities, including
Stanford, in part because victims of sexual
misconduct allegedly do not receive a fail
shot at proving their claims when the bur
den of proof requires more than 50.01% cer
tainty. As a result, these advocates argue,
victims choose not to bring claims forward
at all.
This argument may be attractive, but it
does not withstand scrutiny.
There is no doubt that sexual misconduct
occurs on campus and must always be taken

seriously. Data suggests that sexual crimes
are often underreported, perhaps because
of victims' perceptions that their complaints
will be ignored. But a university that pro
vides immediate support to every alleged
victim, conducts a prompt and thorough
investigation, and provides a fair hearing to
the accused even one employing a higher
burden of proof is in no way ignoring a
victim's allegation. There need be no ten
sion between a university's moral and legal
obligation to respond to every allegation of
sexual misconduct in a prompt, thorough
way and the corresponding obligation to
ensure that accused students receive appro
priate due process protections.
Nevertheless, preponderance advocates
insist that high standards of proof are to
blame for the underreporting. This is a sim
ple narrative, but likely untrue. Some col
leges have been using the preponderance
standard for years, yet advocates have pro
vided no evidence that reporting statistics
at those schools are distinguishable from
those at institutions employing higher bur
dens of proof.
Even apart from the question of report
ing, the fundamental problem with employ-
