# Stanford must secure the campus wireless network
## 
### NAFTALI HARRIS, doctoral candidate, statistics 
On Wednesday the University's Information
Security Office (ISO) blocked Internet
access from people who had not watched
the required 15 minute video about computer
security.
While it is important to raise awareness
about information security issues, requiring
everyone on campus to watch a video about
computer security is ironic when Stanford has
not taken an important measure that would
substantially increase information security on
campus: securing the Stanford wireless net
work.
When you connect your computer to the
Internet through Stanford's unsecured wire
less network, all of the communication
between your computer and the websites you
visit is broadcasted unencrypted through the
air. What this means is that everybody else in
your vicinity can also see which websites you
are visiting and much of the information you
send them.
(Stanford's wireless network isn't "open,"
in that the Stanford routers won't let just any
body connect to the Internet, which is why you
had to register your computer the first time
you connected to the Internet. But it is unen
crypted, allowing people to read the traffic).
Unfortunately, there is no way to detect
whether somebody is listening in, the same

way that you can't tell who's listening to a
radio broadcast. And the ability to eavesdrop
on your web-surfing is not limited to elite
hackers; anybody can download free software
like Wireshark to make listening in easy.
Stanford's unsecured wireless network is
problematic for two reasons: It compromises
our security and allows our privacy to be vio
lated.
Transmitting our unencrypted informa
tion through the air makes it easier for iden
tity thieves to steal our information. It also
makes us more vulnerable to "man in the
middle" attacks, in which a malicious
machine pretends to be the router we wish to
communicate with.
And even if we could trust every single
member of the Stanford community to behave
honestly, we would still be vulnerable to these
attacks from Stanford machines that have
been compromised by crackers and from
malicious users outside the Stanford commu
nity.
An unsecured wireless network also allows
our privacy to be violated. Many people
assume that nobody else can find out which
websites they visit, a common misconception
that the ISO video made no attempt to clear
