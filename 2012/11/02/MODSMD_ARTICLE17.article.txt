# Stanford must secure the campus wireless network
## 
### NAFTALI HARRIS, doctoral candidate, statistics 
On Wednesday the University's Information
Security Office (ISO) blocked Internet
access from people who had not watched
the required 15 minute video about computer
security.
While it is important to raise awareness
about information security issues, requiring
everyone on campus to watch a video about
computer security is ironic when Stanford has
not taken an important measure that would
substantially increase information security on
campus: securing the Stanford wireless net
work.
When you connect your computer to the
Internet through Stanford's unsecured wire
less network, all of the communication
between your computer and the websites you
visit is broadcasted unencrypted through the
air. What this means is that everybody else in
your vicinity can also see which websites you
are visiting and much of the information you
send them.
(Stanford's wireless network isn't "open,"
in that the Stanford routers won't let just any
body connect to the Internet, which is why you
had to register your computer the first time
you connected to the Internet. But it is unen
crypted, allowing people to read the traffic).
Unfortunately, there is no way to detect
whether somebody is listening in, the same

way that you can't tell who's listening to a
radio broadcast. And the ability to eavesdrop
on your web-surfing is not limited to elite
hackers; anybody can download free software
like Wireshark to make listening in easy.
Stanford's unsecured wireless network is
problematic for two reasons: It compromises
our security and allows our privacy to be vio
lated.
Transmitting our unencrypted informa
tion through the air makes it easier for iden
tity thieves to steal our information. It also
makes us more vulnerable to "man in the
middle" attacks, in which a malicious
machine pretends to be the router we wish to
communicate with.
And even if we could trust every single
member of the Stanford community to behave
honestly, we would still be vulnerable to these
attacks from Stanford machines that have
been compromised by crackers and from
malicious users outside the Stanford commu
nity.
An unsecured wireless network also allows
our privacy to be violated. Many people
assume that nobody else can find out which
websites they visit, a common misconception
that the ISO video made no attempt to clear
up.
Especially for those of us who
live on campus, it is reasonable to
expect that webpages we visit in the
privacy of our campus homes are as
private as the conversations we have
or the books we read there. Using
Stanford's wireless network, howev
er, allows strangers to see most of
our Internet activity.
Fortunately, some sites, like
Facebook, Gmail and the websites of
major banks, encrypt our communi
cation with them through the
HTTPS protocol.
But exploitation continues to be
found due to flawed implementa
tions of security measures, even at
major websites. Two years ago, for
example, software developer Eric
Butler released an add-on to Firefox

called Firesheep that took advan
tage of the fact that many websites,
including Facebook, Amazon and
Twitter, sent the cookies stored on
our computers unencrypted over the
network. Firesheep, which is still
freely available, allowed a malicious
user to crack into our accounts on
these websites, effectively stealing
our identity.
The Stanford Daily was quick to
report on Firesheep and the havoc it
allowed.
But despite this clear warning
sign, Stanford did not implement
wireless encryption, which would
have prevented this session hijack
ing attack.
The fact is that we do not know
where the next major security
breach will come from or how bad it
will be. What we do know, however,
is that adding an extra layer of secu
rity can prevent security breaches in
other layers from harming us. As
the ISO video itself says, "It's good
to use multiple defenses because

there is no secret recipe for staying
100% safe."
Wireless encryption has been
standardized since the 19905, an
eternity ago in Internet time, and
security researchers, including
those at Stanford, have continued to
strengthen these standards since
then.
Many of our peer universities,
including Harvard, Yale, and the
University of Chicago, have recog
nized the importance of secure and
private network access and have
implemented wireless encryption.
It is embarrassing that a univer
sity renowned for being at the cut
ting edge of information technology
still uses unsecured wireless.
Before the ISO puts out another
video about what we can do to
improve computer security,
Stanford should secure the campus
wireless network.
