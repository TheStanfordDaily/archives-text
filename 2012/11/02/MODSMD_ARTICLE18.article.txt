# OP-ED
## From One Stanford 1960s War Protestor To Another 
### 
To:
Mr. Willard Mitt Romney
Candidate for the Presidency of the
United States
Dear Mr. Romney:
Your and my time as students
at Stanford University over
lapped between 1964 and
1968. You and I did not know each
other at Stanford, but it now
appears that our paths certainly
crossed: I, too, was a protestor, but I
protested against the Vietnam War
and for civil rights and interna
tional human rights.
When the Stanford Sigma Chi
Fraternity recruited me to become a
member in 1965, the national gover
nors of that fraternity kicked the
Stanford Chapter out of the national
membership. I am African-American.
The Sigma Chi elders refused to
integrate the fraternity. Many other
white-only fraternities, private
clubs and religious denominations
expressed solidarity with the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter and
abolished their anti-black, anti-
Jewish and anti-woman traditions.
My beliefs, my experiences and
my commitments then inform who I
am today as one would have to
believe yours do as well. I am a busi
nessman, father and grandfather
who is unequivocally committed to
human rights, workers' rights and
especially the women's rights that
your political party is trying to
destroy.
This year it was revealed that at

Stanford you were a "protestor" for
the Vietnam War.
You protested in favor of the
defining war of our generation
but you refused to actually fight in
it. The record shows that you
cheered the conscription of our fel
low countrymen as you stood use
lessly on the sidelines with pro-war
signs held high. And in the most des
picable and unforgivable act of cow
ardice for an able-bodied war advo
cate: You refused to go. You pro
claimed that North Vietnam was a
threat that justified the lives of our
generation, but you felt yourself to
be too precious to risk losing yours.
Mr. Romney, that is shameful, dis
graceful and outrageous.
Your five able-bodied sons sup
ported the Iraq War. But neither they,
your father, nor any of your Romney
grandfathers has ever served in the
military defense of this nation.
I am humbled and honored that
Stanford students have twice in the
past ten years invited me to campus
to present talks about the human
rights reforms that we accom
plished at Stanford in the 19605; I
was also a co-founder of the
Stanford Black Student Union. The
religious canon of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,
in which you were an elder during
this same period, was grounded in
so-called "edicts from God," which
proclaimed me, other people of
color, Jews and certain other non-
Mormons, as sub-humans.
Even so, the fact that you were
an elder in this aggressive belief

system would be a moot point if you
were not in 2012 enthusiastically
leading a political party whose social
and governing policy is to deny
women sovereignty over their own
bodies and promote racial bigotry
and the abuse of workers.
What is the evidence that you
have any degree of the kind of char
acter that American citizens look for
in their President?
The United States represents
the very highest aspirations of
humanity. Since 1965, there has
been for the first time in human his
tory a society in which the rights of
all are equally protected, as
inscribed in the sacred text of our
14th Amendment. Blacks, women,
newly immigrated citizens of color,
gays and all previously marginalized
groups now have expanded access to
political leadership, business oppor
tunities, cultural influence and
employment appropriate to our
skills.
Despite the best efforts of Rush
Limbaugh, Michelle Bachman,
Donald Trump, Jack Welch, Newt
Gingrich, Paul Ryan and others of
your political persuasion, the United
States will continue moving inex
orably forward. We will lead the
world as a society that is racially,
ethnically and gender-diverse under
the courageous, ethical and vision
ary leadership of President Barack
Hussein Obama.

in their President?
The United States represents
the very highest aspirations of
humanity. Since 1965, there has
been for the first time in human his
tory a society in which the rights of
all are equally protected, as
inscribed in the sacred text of our
14th Amendment. Blacks, women,
newly immigrated citizens of color,
gays and all previously marginalized
groups now have expanded access to
political leadership, business oppor
tunities, cultural influence and
employment appropriate to our
skills.
Despite the best efforts of Rush
Limbaugh, Michelle Bachman,
Donald Trump, Jack Welch, Newt
Gingrich, Paul Ryan and others of
your political persuasion, the United
States will continue moving inex
orably forward. We will lead the
world as a society that is racially,
ethnically and gender-diverse under
the courageous, ethical and vision
ary leadership of President Barack
Hussein Obama.
Sincerely,
KENI WASHINGTON '6B
