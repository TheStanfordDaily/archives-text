COLORADO [l-7,1-4 PAC-12]
MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 45, COLORADO 7:
College football is one of the great bastions
of parity in sports today. You have your
George Masons in NCAA basketball, your
wild card contenders in MLB and occasional
ly your feel-good stories in the NFL. But usu
ally, the house wins and it wins often.
College football has seen upset after upset
this year and in years past. From Stanford's
"Biggest Upset Ever" to Boise State's statue
of liberty play that knocked off Oklahoma,
the college gridiron produces some crazy
results. Saturday will not be one of them.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 34, COLORADO 13:
This is a tough one for me to call. I have no
doubt that Stanford will win, but I just don't
know which Cardinal unit we're going to see
out there. Colorado is not a very good foot
ball team, but they can run the football
against anyone in this conference. If
Stanford continues to struggle moving the
ball on offense, it could be close for a while.
In the end, I think the Kevin Hogan experi
ment will break the game wide open, and
Stanford will pull away for a comfortable win.
It's going to be scary for a while though.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 37, COLORADO 10:
It's funny that Stanford is favored to win by
four touchdowns because against most
teams, I'm not even sure if the Cardinal is
capable of scoring four touchdowns
unless the defense scores half of them, of
course. Good thing we're playing against
Colorado. If Stanford can't put up 30 points
against the worst defense in the Pac-12,
then it doesn't deserve to and won't beat
Oregon State and Oregon in the coming
weeks. Even if it came a bit late, coach
Shaw made the right call by giving Kevin
Hogan more snaps. The problem with Nunes
isn't that he gets rattled; it's that he gets too
complacent sometimes. With Hogan compet
ing with him for the starting job, Nunes will
finally elevate his level of play. Hogan will
also play well, but not well enough for Shaw
to make him the starter. Stepfan Taylor
should also bounce back in emphatic fash
ion, rushing for over 150 yards and getting in
the end zone twice.
