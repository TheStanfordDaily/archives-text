# FREAKY FRIDAY: The Varied First Time
## 
### D.S. '13 | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For a while in high school, I had
my mind made up that I'd lose
my virginity on top of a water
tower. Back home, there's this great set
of rolling hills at one edge of town, and
kids would drive up there at night to
mess around. A short hike up the hill
from one of these spots, you can scale
the chain link fence and haul yourself
up the ladder to the top. The first time
I stood up there, looking down at the
twinkling lights of suburbia with the
wind on my face, I made up my mind.
This would be the spot.
I did have other requirements for
my first time: for one thing, I wanted to
be in love. I figured throwing out my
crazy water tower suggestion to
whichever guy I fell in love with would
be a pretty great test of compatibility.
Plus, my first time had to be epic. I was
totally averse to the idea of doing it on
a couch with some action movie sequel
playing in the background.
I wanted to make a really big deal
over it. After all, wasn't I supposed to
do that? Lose it. Don't lose it. Save it for
marriage. Make your first time special.
Get it over with already. My friends,
parents, teachers and boyfriends all had
different things to say about virginity!
This week, in an anonymous sur
vey, I asked other students to lend me
their perspectives on the following: If
you've chosen to have sex, how did you
know you were ready for your first
time? If you haven't done it yet, how
will you know you're ready?
Many of the students surveyed
expressed the need for a deep emotion
al connection with a first-time sexual
partner:
"The reason why I decided I was
ready to have sex with my boyfriend
was because I knew I loved him and
felt comfortable sharing myself with
him in away that I hadn't done with

anyone else. He didn't pressure me; in
fact, I initiated it, which made me feel
even more sure about my decision."
"I think it will feel right when I've
been with someone I really love for a
while, and I trust that person com
pletely. I've waited this long, I don't just
want to give it away to someone who
doesn't deserve it, you know?"
"I feel like I lost my virginity twice:
when it actually happened the first
time and when I had sex with someone
I felt emotionally connected to for the
first time. An emotional connection
has since become a deal breaker for me
when it comes to deciding whether or
not to have sex."
For many other students surveyed,
love was not necessarily a factor. They
explained that they felt ready and able
to have great, fulfilling sexual experi
ences when they found partners who
respected their needs and made them
feel comfortable:
"There is a lot of pressure to wait
for "true love," especially for girls, and a
lot of stigma surrounding losing your
virginity to someone you are not in a
serious, committed relationship with.
But once I reached an age where I
knew I was emotionally ready to have
sex, I realized that I could not let wait
ing for a boyfriend dictate my life
choices."
"I think you have to trust yourself
and ask the questions, 'Do I feel com
fortable with this person? Do I trust
this person? Am I comfortable in this
setting? Am I making this decision for
myself or for someone else? Will I use a
level/type of protection that makes me
feel safe?"'
"I think I'll be ready when I know
it's with somebody who is thinking
about me just as much as, or more,
than they are thinking about them
selves."
"I felt comfortable talking with my
boyfriend about being a virgin. I felt

comfortable voicing my fears and con
cerns. He was prepared to go slow, walk
me through it, take our time. I didn't
feel pressured. He was patient and
skilled and we had great conversations
about what felt good for me and what
felt good for him. He got tested, he
wore condoms every time and I was on
the pill, so I felt totally safe."
"Really, all I wanted from my "first
time" was to be with a guy that made
me feel comfortable, treated me right,
and whom I was sure was going to call
the next day. And, I have no regrets!"
The awesome truth is you can
define your virginity however you
want. Your first sexual experience can
be a gift you share with someone you
love, or something you take for yourself
to celebrate your own sexual desires;
for many people, it's somewhere in the
middle. Whether you're waiting for a
wedding ring or a Ryan Gosling look
alike, the important thing is to decide
what you want out of your sexual
experiences, and to not settle for less.
And regardless of the level of
attraction or connection you may be
looking for in a partner, it's incredibly
important that you feel comfortable
communicating your sexual bound
aries and discussing methods of pro
tection with that person.
So did I end up having sex on top
of that water tower? The answer is no.
I'm proud to say I lost my virginity on
a couch, with 2 Fast 2 Furious playing
in the background. An action movie
sequel and everything. It was exactly
what I said I'd never do, but it didn't
feel like I was settling in the least. This
particular night was the night I realized
I really didn't really care about that
view from the top of the hill. Sharing
my first sexual experience with some
one I loved and trusted was all I really
wanted at the time. I knew it was
enough for me, and that's how I knew I
was ready.
