# SHOEGAZE

### Ben Holguin Tom Schmidt | CONTRIBUTING WRITERS 
Are you a "fuzzy"? Do you like putting all of your pic
tures through filters like a hip little shit? Do you like
acid? If you answered yes to any of these questions,
you'd probably also enjoy taking the time to listen to some
vacuum sounds.
Shoegaze is a musical genre that takes core tenants and
instrumentations of rock n' roll, stretches them like saltwater
taffy and passes them through an assembly line of noisy fil

ters and effects that would shame Foxconn. Borrowing muc
of the distortion and general amplitude from its predecessoi
noise pop, and combining it with the droopy, melting song
structures of the non-popular dream pop, shoegaze has a
knack for making you want to wrap yourself in an Afghan
and pass out on a bean bag as you lose track of time while
the grinding and whirring reverberates through your impec
cably chiseled cheek bones.
That is, until the doorbell rings and it's the pizza guy
and when did you order pizza and wow, you're pretty high
right now.
For many shoegaze albums, trying to understand the
album on first listen proves impossible. There are simply to(
many layers to take in at once, and the noise can often end
up sounding like just noise. However, much like a
Tamagotchi, the more time you spend with an album, the
more layers you will unwrap and the more the album will
fully impregnate your subconscious.
Let's run through a few of the more notable shoegaze
albums, along with a few of our personal favorites.
My Bloody Valentine "Loveless"
By most critics' standards (and ours), "Loveless" is
shoegaze's greatest accomplishment. After working for nearl

two years in produc
tion at a cost that
almost bankrupted
their label, Kevin
Shields and his band
of merry machinery
cranked out their sem
inal work that is truly
one of a kind. Save
the rather innocuous
sounding drum hits
on the opening track
