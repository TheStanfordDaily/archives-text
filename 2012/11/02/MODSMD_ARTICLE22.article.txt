"Only Shallow," "Loveless" slathers the listener in a melange
of groaning guitars, echoey drums and washed-out QTPi
vocals to create an atmosphere rich in emotion without the
saccharine fluff.
While many albums suffer from every-track-sounds
the-same syndrome, you would be hard-pressed to confuse
the ego death-inducing space trip of "To Here Knows When"
with the earthy crunch of the bass-driven "Sometimes." And
yet, despite these differences, tracks seamlessly blend together
like the ingredients of some sort of cosmic burrito.
Key tracks: "To Here Knows When," "Come In Alone,"
"Soon"
Should "A Folding Sieve"
Though most won't recognize their album art from

Billboard lists or fresh
man dorm rooms,
Should's 1995 "A
Folding Sieve" is a
favorite of ours and a
standout work in the
3 genre. "Sieve" trades the
layers of filtered guitars
popularized by
"Loveless" in favor of a
much simpler and

rawer sound. Tracks like "Breathe Salt" and "Clean" feature a
lone, droning string instrument that spans the entire song,
and while the drums echo on, they live in the background
rather than overtaking the subtler elements, as many
shoegaze albums tend to do.
As a whole, "A Folding Sieve" strips away much of the
thick sound that shoegaze is known for while sticking to ele
ments of the noise and fuzz that define the genre.
Key tracks: "Clean," "Own Two Feet," "Pop Apology"

The Jesus and Mary Chain "Psychocandy"
Ever seen "Lost in Translation?" Remember that won
derful song about cunnilingus that plays during the final
scene? That's The Jesus and Mary Chain's "Just Like Honey,"
and boy does that song rock. "Just Like Honey" encapsulates


everything great about The Jesus
and Mary Chain's landmark 1985
album "Psychocandy": it's the
Ronettes' "Be My Baby" doused in
reverb and fuzzed-out guitar feed
back. And what's truly remarkable
about "Psychocandy" is how well it
works this formula throughout the
rest of the album.
Half the songs take 60s pop
song structures and add lots and
lots of noise, while the other half
combine the Velvet Underground's
"White Light/White Heat" with
Beach Boys' melodies. And every
damn song is good. It's one of the
best (and coolest) albums of the
past 30 years and it played an enor
mous role in the development of
shoegaze.
Key tracks: "Just Like Honey," "The
Hardest Walk," "Never
Understand," "Cut Dead"
Slowdive "Souvlaki"

Slowdive's best and most
important album, "Souvlaki" is
dreamy, atmospheric, and sooth
ing. Brian Eno too. Best listened to
on a Persian rug during a rain
storm. Good for studying, sleeping
and drags!
Key tracks: "Alison," "Souvlaki
Space Station," "Machine Gun"
Bands influenced by other
shoegaze bands: Deerhunter, MB3,
Beach House, Pains of Being Pure
at Heart, Spacemen 3,
Spiritualized, Yo La Tengo, Mazzy
Star, Have a Nice Life

layers of filtered guitars
popularized by
"Loveless" in favor of a
much simpler and

rawer sound. Tracks like "Breathe Salt" and "Clean" feature a
lone, droning string instrument that spans the entire song,
and while the drums echo on, they live in the background
rather than overtaking the subtler elements, as many
shoegaze albums tend to do.
As a whole, "A Folding Sieve" strips away much of the
thick sound that shoegaze is known for while sticking to ele
ments of the noise and fuzz that define the genre.
Key tracks: "Clean," "Own Two Feet," "Pop Apology"

The Jesus and Mary Chain "Psychocandy"
Ever seen "Lost in Translation?" Remember that won
derful song about cunnilingus that plays during the final
scene? That's The Jesus and Mary Chain's "Just Like Honey,"
and boy does that song rock. "Just Like Honey" encapsulates


everything great about The Jesus
and Mary Chain's landmark 1985
album "Psychocandy": it's the
Ronettes' "Be My Baby" doused in
reverb and fuzzed-out guitar feed
back. And what's truly remarkable
about "Psychocandy" is how well it
works this formula throughout the
rest of the album.
Half the songs take 60s pop
song structures and add lots and
lots of noise, while the other half
combine the Velvet Underground's
"White Light/White Heat" with
Beach Boys' melodies. And every
damn song is good. It's one of the
best (and coolest) albums of the
past 30 years and it played an enor
mous role in the development of
shoegaze.
Key tracks: "Just Like Honey," "The
Hardest Walk," "Never
Understand," "Cut Dead"
Slowdive "Souvlaki"

Slowdive's best and most
important album, "Souvlaki" is
dreamy, atmospheric, and sooth
ing. Brian Eno too. Best listened to
on a Persian rug during a rain
storm. Good for studying, sleeping
and drags!
Key tracks: "Alison," "Souvlaki
Space Station," "Machine Gun"
Bands influenced by other
shoegaze bands: Deerhunter, MB3,
Beach House, Pains of Being Pure
at Heart, Spacemen 3,
Spiritualized, Yo La Tengo, Mazzy
