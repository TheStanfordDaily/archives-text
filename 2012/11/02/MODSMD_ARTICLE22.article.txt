"Only Shallow," "Loveless" slathers the listener in a melange
of groaning guitars, echoey drums and washed-out QTPi
vocals to create an atmosphere rich in emotion without the
saccharine fluff.
While many albums suffer from every-track-sounds
the-same syndrome, you would be hard-pressed to confuse
the ego death-inducing space trip of "To Here Knows When"

Key tracks: "To Here Knows When," "Come In Alone,"
"Soon"
Should "A Folding Sieve"
Though most won't recognize their album art from

Billboard lists or fresh

layers of filtered guitars
popularized by
"Loveless" in favor of a

rawer sound. Tracks like "Breathe Salt" and "Clean" feature a
lone, droning string instrument that spans the entire song,
and while the drums echo on, they live in the background

Key tracks: "Clean," "Own Two Feet," "Pop Apology"

The Jesus and Mary Chain "Psychocandy"
Ever seen "Lost in Translation?" Remember that won
derful song about cunnilingus that plays during the final
scene? That's The Jesus and Mary Chain's "Just Like Honey,"
and boy does that song rock. "Just Like Honey" encapsulates
