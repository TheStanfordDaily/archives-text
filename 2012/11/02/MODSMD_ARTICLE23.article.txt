# Sex Talk with the Tree:
## DRESSING UP TO GET DOWN 
### 
I counted 18 "cats" last night.
And by cats, of course, I mean
girls in black booty shorts, a
corset and some indiscernible ears
cat or mouse?
What is it about Halloween
that gives us an excuse to dress
provocatively? To quote Mean
Girls (the obvious mecca for prop
er girl advice), "Halloween is the
one night a year when girls can
dress like a total slut and no other
girls can say anything about it." I
myself have been a sexy nurse, sul
try Alice in Wonderland and sen
sual Batgirl. I was even a cat, too,
though that was a full body suit I
wore when I was eight and it was
modeled after Cats the Musical
(but that's besides the point).
As I walked down the aisles of
Diddam's searching for Halloween
costume ideas for this year, it was,
as always, difficult to find a realis
tic version of anything. From
princess to nurse costumes, there
was not a single outfit that did not
feature a busty lady wearing "come
ravish me" boots on the cover. But
isn't that the whole point of
Halloween? To be something we
are not, since we don't have to
worry about being judged by any
one or people developing precon
ceived notions about us?
So, is Halloween a time for us
to live out our fantasies? Freshman
year I kissed a guy at Mausoleum
who was dressed as an old man ...
or something with a onesie. Does
this mean I want to hook up with
geriatric men? No, not really. He
just happened to be cute, and I am
a sucker for onesies. And to be

honest, I have definitely been hit
on and/or hooked up with guys
while wearing zombie makeup. We
are talking white face makeup, fake
blood and a black eye. I doubt
many people go to Halloween par
ties and think, "Wow, I really want
to make out with that dead-look
ing chick tonight!"
Or maybe they do, in which
case, lucky me.
So, I set out to ask a few peo
ple what their ideal costume fanta
sy was (for an intimate context).
Some responses:
"A doctor. There's something
about going to a doctors office and
getting examined ... thoroughly."
"A farmer ... with muscular
arms and a farmer's tan."
"Cowboy."
"A pirate."
"Slutty superhero."
And of course, the ever-pop
ular "sexy librarian or a catholic
school girl." A lot of people, it
turns out, desire the sexy librarian,
but how many of us have actually
seen a sexy librarian? My high
school librarian was about 100
years old, short grey bob haircut,
and topped out at 4 feet 11 inches.
This might be your type, but I
personally did not think, "Whoa, I
wish my partner would dress up
as her tonight!"
Even after Halloween,
though, dressing up sometimes for
your partner can be really fun and
special. There are a few golden
rules when it comes to role-play
and dress up, however. We all have
our fantasies, and it is very impor
tant to be sensitive when our part

ner confides in us what might turn
them on.
This can be difficult; some of
our fantasies are very private and
it may take your partner a lot of
courage to tell you what they are
into or would like to try. This
doesn't mean you have to dress up
as something that you are uncom
fortable doing, by any means, but
try to be kind and open-minded
with your partner's fantasies.
As one of my fellow SHPRC
counselors always says, "Don't
yuck someone's yum": Don't make
someone feel bad or shunned for
something that turns them on,
unless they are unwillingly hurting
others.
Next, I wouldn't recommend
playing dress-up role-play on
your first date or first sexual
encounter, but after dating some
one for a while, it is nice to keep
things exciting by dressing up
every once in a while. It is also
another way to really get to know
your partner on an intimate level.
And for the guys reading this, I
personally would love to have my
man dress up too! I love to get
dressed up for my partner, so it
would be even more fun if he
returned the gesture!
But why can't we wear what
we want and show off our bodies
and feel sexy on a daily basis? Why
is it a negative thing to wear some
thing that makes us feel confident?
Why does this have to be limited
to one day or during a role-play in
our bedroom? This is not to say
that you should go to class dressed
as a fireman in hopes of attracting

potential partners, but whatever
you decide to wear, just own it. In
my opinion, you look how you
feel. If you feel confident and sexy,
others will start to think so too.
But remember, just because
someone is dressed in away that
you might deem provocative, that
does not mean that they are asking
for sex (*note: for more support
or info on this, check out
Stanford's "Slutwalk," supporting
the campaign "A dress is not a
yes.")
Everyone should be able to
wear what they want without hav
ing to worry about being labeled
as a "slut." I know it seems like a
lot of the items that make us feel
sexy seem immodest, but maybe
covering up more and leaving
something to the imagination
makes you feel sexy — that is cool
too!
On a personal note, if you
and your partner have a Stanford
Tree dress-up fantasy, the answer
is no, I won't lend you my cos
tume. But I'd love to help you
make your own.

As I walked down the aisles of
Diddam's searching for Halloween
costume ideas for this year, it was,
as always, difficult to find a realis
tic version of anything. From
princess to nurse costumes, there
was not a single outfit that did not
feature a busty lady wearing "come
ravish me" boots on the cover. But
isn't that the whole point of
Halloween? To be something we
are not, since we don't have to
worry about being judged by any
one or people developing precon
ceived notions about us?
So, is Halloween a time for us
to live out our fantasies? Freshman
year I kissed a guy at Mausoleum
who was dressed as an old man ...
or something with a onesie. Does
this mean I want to hook up with
geriatric men? No, not really. He
just happened to be cute, and I am
a sucker for onesies. And to be

honest, I have definitely been hit
on and/or hooked up with guys
while wearing zombie makeup. We
are talking white face makeup, fake
blood and a black eye. I doubt
many people go to Halloween par
ties and think, "Wow, I really want
to make out with that dead-look
ing chick tonight!"
Or maybe they do, in which
case, lucky me.
So, I set out to ask a few peo
ple what their ideal costume fanta
sy was (for an intimate context).
Some responses:
"A doctor. There's something
about going to a doctors office and
getting examined ... thoroughly."
"A farmer ... with muscular
arms and a farmer's tan."
"Cowboy."
"A pirate."
"Slutty superhero."
And of course, the ever-pop
ular "sexy librarian or a catholic
school girl." A lot of people, it
turns out, desire the sexy librarian,
but how many of us have actually
seen a sexy librarian? My high
school librarian was about 100
years old, short grey bob haircut,
and topped out at 4 feet 11 inches.
This might be your type, but I
personally did not think, "Whoa, I
wish my partner would dress up
as her tonight!"
Even after Halloween,
though, dressing up sometimes for
your partner can be really fun and
special. There are a few golden
rules when it comes to role-play
and dress up, however. We all have
our fantasies, and it is very impor
tant to be sensitive when our part

ner confides in us what might turn
them on.
This can be difficult; some of
our fantasies are very private and
it may take your partner a lot of
courage to tell you what they are
into or would like to try. This
doesn't mean you have to dress up
as something that you are uncom
fortable doing, by any means, but
try to be kind and open-minded
with your partner's fantasies.
As one of my fellow SHPRC
counselors always says, "Don't
yuck someone's yum": Don't make
someone feel bad or shunned for
something that turns them on,
unless they are unwillingly hurting
others.
Next, I wouldn't recommend
playing dress-up role-play on
your first date or first sexual
encounter, but after dating some
one for a while, it is nice to keep
things exciting by dressing up
every once in a while. It is also
another way to really get to know
your partner on an intimate level.
And for the guys reading this, I
personally would love to have my
man dress up too! I love to get
dressed up for my partner, so it
would be even more fun if he
returned the gesture!
But why can't we wear what
we want and show off our bodies
and feel sexy on a daily basis? Why
is it a negative thing to wear some
thing that makes us feel confident?
Why does this have to be limited
to one day or during a role-play in
our bedroom? This is not to say
that you should go to class dressed
as a fireman in hopes of attracting

potential partners, but whatever
you decide to wear, just own it. In
my opinion, you look how you
feel. If you feel confident and sexy,
others will start to think so too.
But remember, just because
someone is dressed in away that
you might deem provocative, that
does not mean that they are asking
for sex (*note: for more support
or info on this, check out
Stanford's "Slutwalk," supporting
the campaign "A dress is not a
yes.")
Everyone should be able to
wear what they want without hav
ing to worry about being labeled
as a "slut." I know it seems like a
lot of the items that make us feel
sexy seem immodest, but maybe
covering up more and leaving
something to the imagination
makes you feel sexy — that is cool
too!
On a personal note, if you
and your partner have a Stanford
Tree dress-up fantasy, the answer
is no, I won't lend you my cos
tume. But I'd love to help you
make your own.

I counted 18 "cats" last night.
And by cats, of course, I mean
girls in black booty shorts, a
corset and some indiscernible ears
cat or mouse?
What is it about Halloween
that gives us an excuse to dress
provocatively? To quote Mean
Girls (the obvious mecca for prop
er girl advice), "Halloween is the
one night a year when girls can
dress like a total slut and no other
girls can say anything about it." I
myself have been a sexy nurse, sul
try Alice in Wonderland and sen
sual Batgirl. I was even a cat, too,
though that was a full body suit I
wore when I was eight and it was
modeled after Cats the Musical
(but that's besides the point).
