# ELECTION 2012
## Obama heavily favored by Stanford employee donors 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the 2012 presidential election just
four days away, many Stanford University
employees have already voted with their wal
lets— most offering support for President
Barack Obama's bid for a second term.
Stanford donors have given a total of
$473,372 to Obama's reelection campaign
through Oct. 25, according to Federal Election
Commission (FEC) filings. Contributions to
Governor Mitt Romney's campaign from
Stanford employees over the same period total
only $45,615, a little under 10 percent of the
Obama total.
These individual contribution figures only
represent contributions made directly to pres
idential campaigns by donors who reported
working for Stanford University. Only dona
tions over $2OO are tallied.
According to the Center for Responsive
Politics, Stanford employees constitute the
seventh-largest group of donors to Obama in
the 2012 electoral cycle and the third-largest
among universities, behind only Harvard and
the University of California system.
"This [imbalance in support] is very typical
of universities," said Adam Bonica, associate
professor of political science. 'Academics also
have a high propensity to give, compared to
other professionals."
Obama's 2012 fundraising totals from
Stanford employees, however, are lower than
in 2008, when he received $595,716. Larry
Diamond '73 M.A '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a Hoover

Institution senior fellow who has donated
$1,250 in the 2012 cycle to Obama, framed the
decrease in donor enthusiasm as reflective of
2008's unique circumstances.
"2008 was quite exceptional and extremely
unlikely to be repeated in enthusiasm or
scale," Diamond said. "A lot of faculty who are
somewhere between left and moderate are
sure to have disappointments with Obama."
Diamond said his continued support for
Obama emanates largely from the hope that
he'll continue the work of his first term, citing
the electoral slogan that "Osama Bin-Laden is
dead, and General Motors is alive," while turn
ing to address issues like the federal deficit
and climate change.
"When you look at his accomplishments,
they've been significant," Diamond argued.
Keith Hennessey '9O, a Graduate School of
Business lecturer who has donated the maxi
mum individual contribution of $5,000 to
Romney, framed his donation as an attempt to
address the nation's current economic strug
gles and growing national debt.
"I care most about economic policy and
have more confidence in both Governor
Romney and his economic policy agenda,"
Hennessey wrote in a statement.
Hennessey and Diamond both dismissed
the notion that faculty involvement in the pres
idential campaign would have detrimental
effects on classroom dynamics.
"You can't ask faculty to surrender their
political views and their sense of responsibility
to the country," Diamond said. "What you can
ask faculty to do is to keep then* politics out of

the classroom, and I've tried pretty hard to do
that."
"My professional background is in policy
rather than politics," Hennessey, who was a
senior economic adviser to former President
George W Bush, wrote. "I see my goal as mak
ing sure students understand a wide range of
different approaches to policy, including views
with which I strongly disagree."
Democratic, national leanings
Stanford's lean towards Democratic candi
dates extends to candidates further down the
ballot as well, as does the fall in enthusiasm
from 2008.
Just 12.6 percent of donations from
Stanford employees in the 2012 cycle went to
Republican candidates and committees, which
is less than the 20.9 percent for American uni
versities as a whole but more than Harvard's
9.9 percent. That 2012 percentage is the sec
ond lowest in Stanford's history since 1980 and
is half of the 24 percent given in 2008 to
Republicans.
The total amount of donations to federal
level candidates and campaigns has also fallen
between 2008 and 2012 from $3,422,293.90 to
$2,854,128.60, as did the number of contribut
ing employees, from 1585 to 1262, though both

figures could rise in the final week of the campaign.
Bonica framed the historical dominance of federal-level
donations (so far this cycle, only $8,503.30 has gone to state or
local recipients) as typical of a faculty focus on national issues
rather than local concerns, a stance echoed both by
Hennessey and by Diamond.
"When it comes to universities, their donations really
seem to be tuned into national politics," Bonica said. "They're
more or less removed from state-level issues... Most giving
by university employees is an expression of ideological pref
erence."
While the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. FEC
decision has led to a highly contentious increase in corporate
involvement in politics, University employees have also been
able to take advantage of the ruling, with Griffith Harsh, a
School of Medicine professor, providing the largest Stanford
employee donation of $lOO,OOO to Restore Our Future, a pro-
Romney political action committee. Harsh declined to com
ment on his donation.
Bonica, however, downplayed the ruling's significance,
noting that affluent individuals have historically had an array
of means for funding political activities, such as the Swift
Boat Veterans for Truth 527 group of the 2004 presidential
election.
"In the past, if you really wanted to give a lot of money,
you always had a vehicle to do so," Bonica said. "They didn't
emerge out of thin air after Citizens United."
Other Stanford donors, like Carol Winograd, professor
emeritus in the School of Medicine, and her husband Terry
Winograd, professor emeritus of computer science, gave
heavily through accumulated donations to individuals and
party committees, amassing over $300,000 in total for
Democratic causes.
Even while Stanford employees largely remove them
selves from state and local politics, some faculty members
remain active in promoting propositions set to appear on the
2012 ballot for California initiatives.
David Mills, senior lecturer at the Law School, said his
decision to donate $500,000 to Proposition 36, a movement to
amend California's three-strikes law, emanated from his sup
port for civil rights.
"We can't continue to imprison people with these extreme
ly lengthy sentences especially since so many of these peo
ple are [people] of color without there being a great chal
lenge to the fundamental equality of our society," Mills said.

With the 2012 presidential election just
four days away, many Stanford University
employees have already voted with their wal
lets— most offering support for President
Barack Obama's bid for a second term.
Stanford donors have given a total of
$473,372 to Obama's reelection campaign
through Oct. 25, according to Federal Election
Commission (FEC) filings. Contributions to
Governor Mitt Romney's campaign from
Stanford employees over the same period total
only $45,615, a little under 10 percent of the
Obama total.
These individual contribution figures only
represent contributions made directly to pres
idential campaigns by donors who reported
working for Stanford University. Only dona
tions over $2OO are tallied.
According to the Center for Responsive
Politics, Stanford employees constitute the
seventh-largest group of donors to Obama in
the 2012 electoral cycle and the third-largest
among universities, behind only Harvard and
the University of California system.
"This [imbalance in support] is very typical
of universities," said Adam Bonica, associate
professor of political science. 'Academics also
have a high propensity to give, compared to
other professionals."
Obama's 2012 fundraising totals from
Stanford employees, however, are lower than
in 2008, when he received $595,716. Larry
Diamond '73 M.A '7B Ph.D. 'BO, a Hoover

Institution senior fellow who has donated
$1,250 in the 2012 cycle to Obama, framed the
decrease in donor enthusiasm as reflective of
2008's unique circumstances.
"2008 was quite exceptional and extremely
unlikely to be repeated in enthusiasm or
scale," Diamond said. "A lot of faculty who are
somewhere between left and moderate are
sure to have disappointments with Obama."
Diamond said his continued support for
Obama emanates largely from the hope that
he'll continue the work of his first term, citing
the electoral slogan that "Osama Bin-Laden is
dead, and General Motors is alive," while turn
ing to address issues like the federal deficit
and climate change.
"When you look at his accomplishments,
they've been significant," Diamond argued.
Keith Hennessey '9O, a Graduate School of
Business lecturer who has donated the maxi
mum individual contribution of $5,000 to
Romney, framed his donation as an attempt to
address the nation's current economic strug
gles and growing national debt.
"I care most about economic policy and
have more confidence in both Governor
Romney and his economic policy agenda,"
Hennessey wrote in a statement.
Hennessey and Diamond both dismissed
the notion that faculty involvement in the pres
idential campaign would have detrimental
effects on classroom dynamics.
"You can't ask faculty to surrender their
political views and their sense of responsibility
to the country," Diamond said. "What you can
ask faculty to do is to keep then* politics out of

the classroom, and I've tried pretty hard to do
that."
"My professional background is in policy
rather than politics," Hennessey, who was a
senior economic adviser to former President
George W Bush, wrote. "I see my goal as mak
ing sure students understand a wide range of
different approaches to policy, including views
with which I strongly disagree."
Democratic, national leanings
Stanford's lean towards Democratic candi
dates extends to candidates further down the
ballot as well, as does the fall in enthusiasm
from 2008.
Just 12.6 percent of donations from
Stanford employees in the 2012 cycle went to
Republican candidates and committees, which
is less than the 20.9 percent for American uni
versities as a whole but more than Harvard's
9.9 percent. That 2012 percentage is the sec
ond lowest in Stanford's history since 1980 and
is half of the 24 percent given in 2008 to
Republicans.
The total amount of donations to federal
level candidates and campaigns has also fallen
between 2008 and 2012 from $3,422,293.90 to
$2,854,128.60, as did the number of contribut
ing employees, from 1585 to 1262, though both

figures could rise in the final week of the campaign.
Bonica framed the historical dominance of federal-level
donations (so far this cycle, only $8,503.30 has gone to state or
local recipients) as typical of a faculty focus on national issues
rather than local concerns, a stance echoed both by
Hennessey and by Diamond.
"When it comes to universities, their donations really
seem to be tuned into national politics," Bonica said. "They're
more or less removed from state-level issues... Most giving
by university employees is an expression of ideological pref
erence."
While the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. FEC
decision has led to a highly contentious increase in corporate
involvement in politics, University employees have also been
able to take advantage of the ruling, with Griffith Harsh, a
School of Medicine professor, providing the largest Stanford
employee donation of $lOO,OOO to Restore Our Future, a pro-
Romney political action committee. Harsh declined to com
ment on his donation.
Bonica, however, downplayed the ruling's significance,
noting that affluent individuals have historically had an array
of means for funding political activities, such as the Swift
Boat Veterans for Truth 527 group of the 2004 presidential
election.
"In the past, if you really wanted to give a lot of money,
you always had a vehicle to do so," Bonica said. "They didn't
emerge out of thin air after Citizens United."
Other Stanford donors, like Carol Winograd, professor
emeritus in the School of Medicine, and her husband Terry
Winograd, professor emeritus of computer science, gave
heavily through accumulated donations to individuals and
party committees, amassing over $300,000 in total for
Democratic causes.
Even while Stanford employees largely remove them
selves from state and local politics, some faculty members
remain active in promoting propositions set to appear on the
2012 ballot for California initiatives.
David Mills, senior lecturer at the Law School, said his
decision to donate $500,000 to Proposition 36, a movement to
amend California's three-strikes law, emanated from his sup
port for civil rights.
"We can't continue to imprison people with these extreme
ly lengthy sentences especially since so many of these peo
ple are [people] of color without there being a great chal
lenge to the fundamental equality of our society," Mills said.
