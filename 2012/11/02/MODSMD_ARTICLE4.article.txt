## Stanford takes on the Buffaloes as season enters the home stretch 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
With four games
left in the regular
season, tomor
row's matchup
against a strug
gling Colorado team will be the
calm before the storm for the
Cardinal
No. 15 Stanford (6-2,4-1 Pac-12)
will finish out the year by taking on
three ranked Pac-12 teams No. 2
Oregon, No. 11 Oregon State and
No. 25 UCLA in a row to deter
mine its postseason fate. But before
diving into its grueling late-season
stretch, the Cardinal must take
care of business at Colorado (1-7,1-
4) tomorrow.
The Buffaloes may be four
touchdown underdogs, but after
Stanford's unconvincing 24-17 win
over Washington State last week
end, nothing seems to be guaran
teed anymore. Tack on the fact that
the Cardinal has only won one of its
three road games this season, and
that 28-point spread appears
almost too generous.
"We had some guys who made
some individual plays [against
Washington State] that were out
standing, but I think we can play so
much better, and we're going to
need to," head coach David Shaw
said.
In the biggest story of the week,
Shaw announced during Tuesday's
press conference that quarterback
Kevin Hogan will have an expanded
role as the redshirt freshman looks
to get 12-20 snaps throughout the
game. Hogan has carried the ball
seven times for 16 yards on option
plays this year and his only pass
was a 9-yard touchdown to tight
end Levine Toilolo that came dur
ing Stanford's 21-3 victory over Cal
two weeks ago.
Given that the Stanford offense
averages around 60 plays per con
test, Hogan will likely be under
center between one-fifth to one
third of the time.
"Kevin has played so well with
what we've given him to do that we
can't not give him more," Shaw
said. "His athletic ability in space is
exceptional. We want to make sure

One of the top return men in the Pac-12, senior Drew Terrell (4) and the rest of the Stanford team
will have to deal with playing at altitude against Colorado. Boulder is 5,430 feet above sea level.
