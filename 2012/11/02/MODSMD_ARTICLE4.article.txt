## Stanford takes on the Buffaloes as season enters the home stretch 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
With four games
left in the regular
season, tomor
row's matchup
against a strug
gling Colorado team will be the
calm before the storm for the
Cardinal
No. 15 Stanford (6-2,4-1 Pac-12)
will finish out the year by taking on
three ranked Pac-12 teams No. 2
Oregon, No. 11 Oregon State and
No. 25 UCLA in a row to deter
mine its postseason fate. But before
diving into its grueling late-season
stretch, the Cardinal must take
care of business at Colorado (1-7,1-
4) tomorrow.
The Buffaloes may be four
touchdown underdogs, but after
Stanford's unconvincing 24-17 win
over Washington State last week
end, nothing seems to be guaran
teed anymore. Tack on the fact that
the Cardinal has only won one of its
three road games this season, and
that 28-point spread appears
almost too generous.
"We had some guys who made
some individual plays [against
Washington State] that were out
standing, but I think we can play so
much better, and we're going to
need to," head coach David Shaw
said.
In the biggest story of the week,
Shaw announced during Tuesday's
press conference that quarterback
Kevin Hogan will have an expanded
role as the redshirt freshman looks
to get 12-20 snaps throughout the
game. Hogan has carried the ball
seven times for 16 yards on option
plays this year and his only pass
was a 9-yard touchdown to tight
end Levine Toilolo that came dur
ing Stanford's 21-3 victory over Cal
two weeks ago.
Given that the Stanford offense
averages around 60 plays per con
test, Hogan will likely be under
center between one-fifth to one
third of the time.
"Kevin has played so well with
what we've given him to do that we
can't not give him more," Shaw
said. "His athletic ability in space is
exceptional. We want to make sure

will have to deal with playing at altitude against Colorado. Boulder is 5,430 feet above sea level.
we utilize that."
Despite the expansion of the
Hogan package, Josh Nunes is still
the starter for now, at least.
"[Hogan] is not ready to take it
all right now, and I'm not ready to
take it all away from Josh," said
Shaw. "There are things Josh has
done well that we're pleased with
and things Josh has not done well
that we're not pleased with. This is
what's prudent... It's not neces
sarily to compete to be the 'starter.'
It's competing for plays."
"As I said in front of the team,
this is big-time college football," he
continued. "There's competition
everywhere ... We'll let that play
out. Each guys has their things
[sic] that we are packing together
that will hopefully make us a more
efficient offense."
Efficiency is something that the
Cardinal offense desperately needs
sooner than later. Last year's
Andrew Luck-led squad sat atop
the Pae-12 by converting nearly 53
percent of its third downs. This
year, the conversion rate has fallen
to 35 percent. Even a more dis
couraging sign is that Stanford's
pass efficiency is ranked eighth out
of the twelve teams in the confer
ence; Nunes' completion rate
stands at 52.6 percent, well below
the minimum 60 percent standard
set by Shaw.
Nunes, for one, voiced no com
plaints about ceding some playing
time to Hogan.
"[Hogan] has done a lot of good
things on the field," Nunes said. "If
it helps us get a 'W,' I'm all for it."
But it's not just the passing
game that Stanford needs to
improve in a hurry. Stanford's
high-powered running game mus
tered only 120 yards against a sub
par Wazzu-run defense and senior
running back Stepfan Taylor was
held to a season-low 58 yards. To be
fair, Nunes' inconsistencies allowed
the Cougars to play aggressively
against the run by loading the box,
but key blocks by the offensive line
were also missed.
"We can't have another half
where we had 15 plays in the first
half," commented Shaw. "We have
to be more efficient."
The Cardinal has a golden
opportunity to figure things out
tomorrow, when it looks to exploit a
vulnerable Colorado defense that
has at times been the laughing
stock of the Pac-12.

The Buffs, who were utterly
helpless in giving up 70 points to
Oregon last weekend, are ranked
last in the conference in six defen
sive categories: total defense (505
yards per game), rushing defense
(204 yards per game), pass defense
efficiency (177.9), interceptions (3),
opponent first downs (25.6 per
game) and red zone defense (94.1
percent).
With hard-hitting safety
Patrick Orms most likely sitting
out on Saturday after suffering a
concussion two weeks in a row,
Colorado's secondary looks even
more exposed. The normally prolif
ic tight end duo of Zach Ertz and
Levine Toilolo seeks to play a much
bigger impact after an unproduc
tive outing against Washington
State Ertz only had one recep
tion for 20 yards while Toilolo
never got his hands on the ball.
The Colorado offense hasn't
been exactly spectacular, either.
Ranked last in the Pac-12 in scor
ing offense, pass efficiency and
third down conversions, the
Buffaloes are having some quarter
back controversy of their own.
Junior Jordan Webb started in all
eight games so far this year, but
sophomore Nick Hirschmann is in
contention for the starting role fol
lowing the smackdown that Oregon
laid on the Buffs.
Stanford's defensive unit hopes
to continue its dominant play that
has allowed the Cardinal to get
away with sloppy execution on
offense in the last couple games.
Following its ten-sack performance
against the Cougars, the stout unit
has continued to climb higher in
national rankings in multiple
defensive categories.
The Cardinal currently leads
the country in tackles for loss (9.50
per game) and sits at third in sacks
(4.00 per game). Giving up just 65
yards on the ground per game,
Stanford's fearsome run defense is
second in the nation, behind only
Alabama.
The last time that Stanford
traveled to Boulder to play
Colorado was in 1990, when the
Cardinal lost to the Buffs 21-17.
Shaw was redshirted as a freshman
that season, and remembers that
Colorado's mascot, Ralph, "scared
the crap out of" him.
Hopefully Shaw's second trip
will turn out to be more pleasant.
Stanford and Colorado square
off at Folsom Field tomorrow, with
kickoff slated for 11:00 a.m. PT and
television coverage on FX.

Shaw. "There are things Josh has
done well that we're pleased with
and things Josh has not done well
that we're not pleased with. This is
what's prudent... It's not neces
sarily to compete to be the 'starter.'
It's competing for plays."
"As I said in front of the team,
this is big-time college football," he
continued. "There's competition
everywhere ... We'll let that play
out. Each guys has their things
[sic] that we are packing together
that will hopefully make us a more
efficient offense."
Efficiency is something that the
Cardinal offense desperately needs
sooner than later. Last year's
Andrew Luck-led squad sat atop
the Pae-12 by converting nearly 53
percent of its third downs. This
year, the conversion rate has fallen
to 35 percent. Even a more dis
couraging sign is that Stanford's
pass efficiency is ranked eighth out
of the twelve teams in the confer
ence; Nunes' completion rate
stands at 52.6 percent, well below
the minimum 60 percent standard
set by Shaw.
Nunes, for one, voiced no com
plaints about ceding some playing
time to Hogan.
"[Hogan] has done a lot of good
things on the field," Nunes said. "If
it helps us get a 'W,' I'm all for it."
But it's not just the passing
game that Stanford needs to
improve in a hurry. Stanford's
high-powered running game mus
tered only 120 yards against a sub
par Wazzu-run defense and senior
running back Stepfan Taylor was
held to a season-low 58 yards. To be
fair, Nunes' inconsistencies allowed
the Cougars to play aggressively
against the run by loading the box,
but key blocks by the offensive line
were also missed.
"We can't have another half
where we had 15 plays in the first
half," commented Shaw. "We have
to be more efficient."
The Cardinal has a golden
opportunity to figure things out
tomorrow, when it looks to exploit a
vulnerable Colorado defense that
has at times been the laughing
stock of the Pac-12.

The Buffs, who were utterly
helpless in giving up 70 points to
Oregon last weekend, are ranked
last in the conference in six defen
sive categories: total defense (505
yards per game), rushing defense
(204 yards per game), pass defense
efficiency (177.9), interceptions (3),
opponent first downs (25.6 per
game) and red zone defense (94.1
percent).
With hard-hitting safety
Patrick Orms most likely sitting
out on Saturday after suffering a
concussion two weeks in a row,
Colorado's secondary looks even
more exposed. The normally prolif
ic tight end duo of Zach Ertz and
Levine Toilolo seeks to play a much
bigger impact after an unproduc
tive outing against Washington
State Ertz only had one recep
tion for 20 yards while Toilolo
never got his hands on the ball.
The Colorado offense hasn't
been exactly spectacular, either.
Ranked last in the Pac-12 in scor
ing offense, pass efficiency and
third down conversions, the
Buffaloes are having some quarter
back controversy of their own.
Junior Jordan Webb started in all
eight games so far this year, but
sophomore Nick Hirschmann is in
contention for the starting role fol
lowing the smackdown that Oregon
laid on the Buffs.
Stanford's defensive unit hopes
to continue its dominant play that
has allowed the Cardinal to get
away with sloppy execution on
offense in the last couple games.
Following its ten-sack performance
against the Cougars, the stout unit
has continued to climb higher in
national rankings in multiple
defensive categories.
The Cardinal currently leads
the country in tackles for loss (9.50
per game) and sits at third in sacks
(4.00 per game). Giving up just 65
yards on the ground per game,
Stanford's fearsome run defense is
second in the nation, behind only
Alabama.
The last time that Stanford
traveled to Boulder to play
Colorado was in 1990, when the
Cardinal lost to the Buffs 21-17.
Shaw was redshirted as a freshman
that season, and remembers that
Colorado's mascot, Ralph, "scared
the crap out of" him.
Hopefully Shaw's second trip
will turn out to be more pleasant.
Stanford and Colorado square
off at Folsom Field tomorrow, with
kickoff slated for 11:00 a.m. PT and
television coverage on FX.

With four games
left in the regular
season, tomor
row's matchup
against a strug
gling Colorado team will be the
calm before the storm for the
Cardinal
No. 15 Stanford (6-2,4-1 Pac-12)
will finish out the year by taking on
three ranked Pac-12 teams No. 2
Oregon, No. 11 Oregon State and
No. 25 UCLA in a row to deter
mine its postseason fate. But before
diving into its grueling late-season
stretch, the Cardinal must take
care of business at Colorado (1-7,1-
4) tomorrow.
The Buffaloes may be four
touchdown underdogs, but after
Stanford's unconvincing 24-17 win
over Washington State last week
end, nothing seems to be guaran
teed anymore. Tack on the fact that
the Cardinal has only won one of its
three road games this season, and
that 28-point spread appears
almost too generous.
"We had some guys who made
some individual plays [against
Washington State] that were out
standing, but I think we can play so
much better, and we're going to
need to," head coach David Shaw
said.
In the biggest story of the week,
Shaw announced during Tuesday's
press conference that quarterback
Kevin Hogan will have an expanded
role as the redshirt freshman looks
to get 12-20 snaps throughout the
game. Hogan has carried the ball
seven times for 16 yards on option
plays this year and his only pass
was a 9-yard touchdown to tight
end Levine Toilolo that came dur
ing Stanford's 21-3 victory over Cal
two weeks ago.
Given that the Stanford offense
averages around 60 plays per con
test, Hogan will likely be under
center between one-fifth to one
third of the time.
"Kevin has played so well with
what we've given him to do that we
can't not give him more," Shaw
said. "His athletic ability in space is
exceptional. We want to make sure

will have to deal with playing at altitude against Colorado. Boulder is 5,430 feet above sea level.
we utilize that."
Despite the expansion of the
Hogan package, Josh Nunes is still
the starter for now, at least.
"[Hogan] is not ready to take it
all right now, and I'm not ready to
take it all away from Josh," said
Shaw. "There are things Josh has

and things Josh has not done well
