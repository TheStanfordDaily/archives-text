### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the late stages of overtime, a player
dressed in UCLA powder-blue kicks a
beautiful, arcing ball that soars gloriously
over half the length of the field and lands
neatly at the feet of his teammate. The ball
only remains on the ground a few short mil
liseconds before it is again launched into
the air, this time connecting with the under
side of the crossbar and taking a fateful
bounce across the line and into the goal.
Game over. Dozens of players wearing blue
jerseys sprint from all over the field to
come together and celebrate an electrify
ing victory.

In short, it was a beautiful scene in col
lege soccer, a thrilling competition that
came down to the last touch. But if you're

STANFORD 1
UCLA 2
11/1, Los Angeles
from a Stanford team in need of a
victory to keep its postseason
chances alive, you probably see
things differently.
The Cardinal (7-8-1,3-4-1 Pac-12)
headed into Los Angeles on
Thursday night looking to use the
momentum from last week's over
time victory at UC-Santa Barbara
to score an upset against the No. 5
Bruins (12-2-2, 7-1-0). With the end
of the regular season rapidly
approaching, Stanford's players
knew they would probably have to
win out to have a chance at making
the NCAA tournament.
Them dreams were likely thwart
ed Thursday night with a 2-1 defeat,
but not before Stanford challenged
the heavily-favored Bruins to an
exhilarating, double-overtime match
in which the Cardinal controlled a
significant portion of the game.
The game started at a quick pace
with sophomore Zach Batteer forc
ing a save from UCLA keeper Earl
Edwards, who would prove to be
very active throughout the game as
Stanford continued to press on the
attack.
Just 16 minutes into the game,
UCLA got on the board when it exe
cuted perfectly on a corner kick and
was a little fortunate. Hutchins man
aged to save the first attempt off a
header from junior Joe Sofia but
couldn't hold the ball, and Victor
Chavez was there to volley in the
loose ball.
With the lead, the Bruins played
back on the ball, staying conserva
tive to avoid getting burned on the
counterattack. It appeared that this
strategy was working and that
UCLA was going to get out of the
game with an easy victory, but
Stanford started to wear down the
Bruins' defense toward the end of
the half.
In the 33rd minute, freshman
Thompson was able to sneak a ball
past the defense to Hunter Gorskie,
who drilled the ball in for what
looked like the equalizing goal.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Gorskie could only celebrate for a
matter of seconds as the play was
blown dead for offside.
In the closing seconds of the half,
Zach Batteer broke away on a coun
terattack and gave the team a good
rush of confidence going into half
time.
Head coach Jeremy Gunn
reflected his team's confidence at
halftime, saying he still expected to

win out and earn a berth in the
NCAA tournament.
"I think you've written us off too
early," he told the Pac-12 Network's
Cobi Jones. "If we win all three of
these games we'll be flying up the
RPl's with a chance to get into the
tournament."
The second half was all Stanford.
The Cardinal came up with a num
ber of close opportunities. Adam
Jahn broke free for a good shot in
the 49th minute but had it blocked
by the UCLA defense; minutes later,
J.J. Koval snuck past for a close
range shot but had it blocked by the
keeper; in the 63rd minute, Dersu
Abolfathi got off two shots but nei
ther was able to get past the Bruin
defense.
The equalizer came in the 73rd
minute off a throw-in, when Koval's
volley got past the keeper to the far
post, netting the team's first goal of
the game and his second of the sea
son.
The rest of the half was tightly
contested, but neither team was able
to come up with the deciding goal.
Batteer came close, though, receiv
ing the ball at the top of the box and
forcing a save from Edwards. The
Bruin keeper was called into duty
twice more, once on another strike
from Batteer and again on an
attempt by Jahn.
The Cardinal could breathe a
sigh of relief when UCLA forward
Reed William's 88th-minute shot
sailed just over the top of the

Stanford goal. At the end of regula
tion, it would remain 1-1.
In the eighth minute of overtime,
Aaron Kovar came inches from hit
ting the golden goal as his shot
missed just wide of the woodwork.
Stanford goalie Drew Hutchins
made a highlight-reel kind of play
to fend off the Bruins a little longer,
diving to his left to deflect forward
Ryan Hollingshead's strike at goal.
The junior made one more save in
the first overtime, allowing the
team to regroup for second over
time.
After 102 full minutes of play, in
just the third minute of second over
time, the Bruins struck the brutal
blow. Off a perfect pass by senior
Chris Cummings, forward Fernando
Monge broke free of the Stanford
defense and fired off a game-ending
shot from directly in front of the
Cardinal net.
As the UCLA players rushed out
onto the field to celebrate, the
Stanford players began to realize
that their hopes at a postseason had
all but faded. Despite the disap
pointing result, however, Stanford
did anything but fold under pres
sure.
Stanford will travel to San Diego
State on Saturday for a 7 p.m. road
contest, in need of a win and some
help from the NCAA selection com
mittee.
