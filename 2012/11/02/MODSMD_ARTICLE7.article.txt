FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTING FEDERAL CRIMES (for 29 years)?
by Leland Yoshitsu - Amazon • B&NNook • Sony • eßookPie
1. You are purchasing an eßook (or paperback) that contains a collection of historic and legal
documents which PROVES THE FACT that the US Federal Government and a major American
Corporation, NBC, have COMMITTED A NUMBER OF CRIMES AGAINST A US CITIZEN,
Leland Yoshitsu, to secretly and intentionally DEFRAUD him from receiving and obtaining Truth
and Justice.
2. This is a unique documentary book that spans 29 years - an authentic 'one-of-a-kind' learning
instrument that reveals to the public the 'real-inner-workings' of the US Federal Government and
Corporate America (NBC).
3. Do the US Federal Government and Corporate America (NBC) have too cozy a relationship?
4. Is the US Federal Government owned, operated, and controlled by Corporate America (as many
Patriotic Americans have always insisted)?
5. Can the US Federal Government function separately and independently from Corporate America
(NBC)?
6. The US Federal Government should publicly respond to all of the allegations of Crime, Cover-up,
Corruption, and Obstruction of Justice that are outlined in this book to reassure the Public that the
General Welfare of the People is SAFE and SECURE as intended by the US Constitution and the
Founding Fathers.
7. President Obama should acknowledge His commitmenttoTRANSPARENCY by voluntarily making
a 'Public Statement in Good Faith' about all the issues that He has already responded to in this book
especially, if there is a collection of documented evidence of alleged Crime, Cover-up, Corruption, and
Obstruction of Justice in the US Postal Service and in the US Federal Government by Corporate
America (NBC).
