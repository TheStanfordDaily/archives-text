# Q&A
## The 						13th year: Looking to the future 
### – Billy Gallagher 
Stanford University President
John Hennessy sat down with
The Stanford Daily on Oct. 29
to discuss a wide range of top
ics, including online education,
Stanford's failed campaign for a New
York City campus last fall, Stanford's
fundraising prowess and more. This is
the fourth and final installment of that
interview; this one focuses on President
Hennessy's future at Stanford.
TSD: This is your 13th year as
President, correct?
JH: Yes.
TSD: Obviously all of these projects are
a ton to manage. How do you stay fresh
every year and stay energized?
JH: That's a good question. I was just
giving a convocation address at [the]
University of Waterloo, getting an hon
orary degree, and I said, "You have to
love what you're doing. If you love what
you're doing, then you approach it with
energy and excitement and enthusi
asm." Otherwise, I said, I cannot do my
job well unless I love it... and unless I
love seeing the rewards of what we're
able to do.

You find, what you have to find out
about yourself, is that you enjoy the sec
ondary, indirect rewards. When you're a
faculty member, you're sitting in the
classroom, you're working with stu
dents, there's a lot of immediate feed
back, you're working on a research proj
ect, there's a lot of very immediate feed
back.

When you're in a leadership role like
this one, all your feedback is indirect.
But you have those days when one of
your colleagues wins a Nobel Prize or a
student does something extraordinary
... so you find your enjoyment in that. In
seeing that you've had a hand, however
indirect, in helping them get to that
point and seeing them achieve what
they're able to achieve.
If you can't do that, if you can't get
excited on the first day when the school
year's going to open and on commence
ment, even though its your 13th com
mencement or 13th opening... then it's
time to stop doing the job because you
don't have the energy and enthusiasm
you need.
TSD: Do you have a long-term idea of
how long you want to stay at the
University?
JH: We have a couple things now we're
really trying to get finished. We're real
ly trying to push through the arts initia
tive. At some point, there will be a bal
ance of either, "I don't have the energy,"

or "It's healthy for the University to
have new leadership." But I think we'd
really like to see some of the projects
we're working on get to fruition, or at
least get under way. Then it will be time
to get new leadership, which I think is
healthy in its own right.
TSD: Which projects?
JH: I'd like to see the arts projects fin
ish: Bing we're going to open, Anderson
and then the McMurtry art building.
Those are things I want to see happen,
then I want to see the hospital break
ground. That's a long project so it's five
or six or seven years before it'll be done.
But I'll want to see it break ground [and]
at least get started. And eventually I'll
need that hospital, so I want to make
sure it's done before I need it.
The Bing Concert Hall will open in
January 2013; the Anderson
Collectimi building is on track to be
completed in 201b and the
McMurtry art building is sched
uled to be completed in the spring
or summer of 2015. The new
Stanford hospital is set to break
ground in 2013.
If all of these projects stay on
schedule, they will be completed by
the end of the 2014-15 school year.
That would be Hennessy's 15th
year as University President.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's
third President, held office for 27
years, from 1916 to 194-3. Hennessy
is the longest-tenured president in

Stanford's recent era as a world
renowned institution. Stanford's
seventh president, Richard W.
Lyman, wrote in his memoir,
"Stanford in Turmoil," that
Stanford ascended from a regional
institution in the 1950s to a
"nationally and internationally
prestigious university by the time
the '7os were over."
Lyman served for 10 years, from
1970 to 1980, and was followed by
Donald Kennedy, who was presi
dent for 12 years. Hennessy's
immediate predecessor, Gerhard
Casper, ran the University for
eight years.
TSD: If and when you decide to leave, do
you have a plan for what you want to do
after Stanford?
JH: I would like to go back to teaching,
that's what I've missed the most. I'm not
about to start a big research program
simply because I'm an experimental
computer scientist, so I'd have to build
up a group and get a lot of students and
it takes several years to just build up the
group. But I would like to teach, and
maybe spend time you know I've had
a little time working with student entre
preneurs, but very little just because I
don't have a lot of time but I'd like to
spend time with them.
We have a lot of students who have an
entrepreneurial bent and we've made a
lot of progress in trying to build educa
tional opportunities for them so they're
better prepared, but I think we can
think some more about what we might
do there, to help ensure our brilliant stu
dents with great ideas can be successful.
TSD: On the same wavelength, the com
puter science (CS) program keeps grow
ing and growing. How do you feel this
affects other parts of the University,
especially underrepresented majors in
the humanities and the aits?
JH: I think this is part of there's both
some local phenomena at work and some
global phenomena. I think it's great that
the introductory course is attracting
some large percentage 80 or 90 per
cent of the student body. I think it's
great because information technology is
such a core part of the way you get
things done in the world, no matter what
your interests and majors are. So I think
its great we're giving students that kind
of exposure.
The number of [engineering] majors
and the corresponding drop in the
humanities which is occurring, as there's


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
been growth both in the social sci
ences and engineering... I find it
somewhat dispiriting to see stu
dents and I think it's the society
we live in [with] so much focus on
career and being prepared for that
first job, that in many cases we've
undermined the traditional role of
undergraduate education to pre
pare you to be an intelligent life
long learner who's being prepared
for the rest of their life, not just
their first job.
I think we're going to try some
things, working with our colleagues
in the humanities, to see what we
can do to stimulate the rethinking
of that equation. That has involved
a whole set of things: some out
reaches from some of the deans in
the professional schools to talk
about the fact that humanities
undergraduates actually make
great business school candidates,
you don't just have to major in eco
nomics, you can major in many oth
ers things.

In some ways, I think we're
fighting an uphill battle against a
societal force that's pushing more
and more students toward things
that are directly connected with
their first job. There are internal
forces too. I mean I think one of the
reasons CS has done so well is they
have worked really hard on their
undergraduate curriculum. You
look at our completion rates for the
introductory CS course, they're the
best in the country for large institu
tion. In many places in the country,
the dropout rates from the intro
ductory CS course are gigantic.
Our faculty and instructors
there are doing a great job in mak
ing a compelling opportunity for our
students, and that's a good thing
actually. I think we need to work
across this spectrum and we need to
educate students better about their
major choices and get them to think
about what the alternatives are.
Because we have space —we could
have more humanities majors here
easily in the institution [to ask]
what we can do to generate that
kind of enthusiasm and attract stu
dents who want to do it.
