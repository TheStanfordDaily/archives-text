## Radical Cameras Photo League students photograph "ordinary life " for March exhibition 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD 
Eighteen students will travel to San Francisco
this weekend to see a photography exhibit for the
Robinson Photo League's second year. The trip is the
first part of a three-part project led by Robinson
House Resident Fellow Kristen Taylor, whose person
al passion for photography inspired her to found and
direct the program.
This year, the Photo League will see The Radical
Camera: New York's Photo League at the
Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. The
program will continue with a photography workshop
in January and conclude in March, when the Photo
League students will display their own work.
Taylor, a professional photographer, began the
program last year as away to introduce students to
photography and help seasoned photographers grow.
"I wanted to provide the opportunity for those who
do not have experience in photography to develop an
interest and encourage the people who already have
experience to grow and get to know different photog
raphers," Taylor said.
She chose this year's exhibit at the Contemporary
Jewish Museum because of its historic importance.
"The Radical Camera" consists mainly of historical
documentary photography exposing Depression-era
social issues.
"The [members of New York's Photo League]
helped document reality while communicating per
sonal perspectives," Taylor said. "It's about us learn
ing about the time period, the work that they did and
the effect that they had."
She hopes the exhibit will act as a guiding tool for
the students to explore social perspectives in their
own work. To teach both photography amateurs and
veterans, Robinson Photo League participants will
attend a workshop in January. They will use SLR dig
ital cameras to create photojournalistic portrayals of
ordinary life, a theme inspired by the exhibit at the
Contemporary Jewish Museum.
The third and final component of Taylor's program
is an exhibit that showcases one photo taken by each
participant. It will open in March on the first floor of
Robinson House, replacing photos taken by last
year's students.
This year's continuation of the three-part program
was spurred in part by the success of last year's
League. Taylor led a group to see Bill Owen's
Ordinary Folks exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art
and was impressed by students' work after the pilot
workshop.
"It was amazing how many different areas on cam
pus people covered," Taylor said. "Everything from
Quidditch matches to courtside of a men's basketball
game."
According to John Machacon 'l3, a program partic
ipant this year, beginner photographers appreciate the
addition of the post-trip photography workshop.
"It's really exciting for people who haven't already
gotten into photography," he said. "A program like
this really pays homage to the history of photography
itself."
