## Op-Ed Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the SLE 
### TAYLOR BRADY'13 
Six and a half weeks ago, I
trudged, dejected, up the
stairs to Faisan, my new resi
dence. Dadaist art adorned the
walls. How appropriate for this
ridiculous situation, I thought. After
missing staff training due to a
Stanford TAPS performance in
Greece, I had been fired from my
staffing position in a house I'd occu
pied and loved for two years prior.
Then I was reassigned to Faisan.
My fragile expectations for my
"awesome senior year" Row,
staff, single were abruptly dis
mantled. Shock therapy: a broken
Stanford snowglobe.
But now I think about things dif
ferently.
The Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) program at
Stanford provides a forum for thor
ough critical engagement unparal
leled elsewhere in required under
graduate classes. Though SLE's not
currently a requirement, it
absolutely should be especially
for STEM majors who want to truly
and deeply consider the implications
and ancillary effects of what they
are creating. Our undergraduate
curriculum does not challenge that
part of them. At best, IHUM or
Thinking Matters courses engage a
few critical minds with a semi-rigor
ous set of texts but often, and at
worst, they don't go far enough.
Stanford undergraduates want
and deserve better. Most upper
classmen that I talk to didn't appre
ciate their humanities requirement
because it was not rigorous enough

to draw their interest.
Staring out steamy panes of
glass in winter malaise, I'd often
wonder why I itched with discom
fort at what surrounded me. Not
until very recently did I stop deny
ing that I'd always felt intellectually
repressed here.
Allow me to be clear. Any
metonymic characterization of
"Stanford" is a platitude one that
over-generalizes a complex, semi
cohesive conglomeration of people
with very different priorities. In
addition to civil engineering courses,
I've been taking language every
quarter: Spanish, Mandarin and
Cantonese. At Pigott Hall, I plant
myself in front of one of several col
orful bulletin boards wallpapered
like spilled tarot cards with posters
advertising activities to engage the
critical mind. I do this to remind
myself that you cannot say
"Stanford is anti-intellectual" with
out sounding like one of the puenle
sentence patterns that I was forced
to practice to death in intro lan
guage courses. You can be as intel
lectual here as you wish.
At Stanford, however, I have
often confronted what I consider
profoundly anti-intellectual atti
tudes. The stigma manifests itself in
predictable ways when I meet
somebody new at a party, for exam
ple, and they ask where I live.
"Faisan "
"One of the SLE dorms?"
"Yes."
"Oh, that sucks."
But my response now is, invari

ably, no, it does not suck. It does not
prevent me from having a vibrant
social life. I love SLE precisely
because I have had fantastic intel
lectual and emotional engagement
with my dormmates. Previously, I
denigrated the opinions of people
younger than me. I belittled their
emotions. The freshman residents
of Faisan, so willing to critique aca
demia, religion, athletics, have dyna
mited that prejudice. People dis
agree with me here, and I am just
another opinion.
The thing is, I think that so many
of us want that. We want IHUM or
Thinking Matters to be better, our
conversations to be better. We want
to be humbled, our prejudices aired
and alleviated. We want to consider

varied voices of human wisdom. We
want to focus the lens on our very
lives: why it might be reprehensible
to take a job at, say, a missile manu
facturing corporation. Critical
analysis really hurts our job
prospects.
To seniors, I'd say this: Please
stop caring, for a minute, what other
people think when you speak with
nuance and erudition. I'd love to
converse with the you that's not
withholding your intellect.
To Stanford University: Do not
purport to provide your students
with a thorough liberal education
when undergraduate requirements
do not fully reflect that project.
And to my freshman dormmates:
Thank you for simultaneously

exposing my prejudices, engaging
me as an intellectual equal and mak
ing me feel welcome in our home.
As of yesterday, I have with
drawn my reassignment application
and will be living in Faisan a SLE
dorm for the rest of the year.
Sometimes living away from my
friends encourages me to go even
more out of my way to make sure
that I see them, and we don't take it
for granted when we do. I under
stand that Faisan may not be the
place for everybody, but maybe, just
maybe, if you're wrenched from the
warm quilt of your comfort zone in
your years here, you'll discover that
you love running in the snow.
