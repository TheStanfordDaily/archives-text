## Self-immolation: The voice of Tibetans 
### TENZIN TOPDEN '14 
ur\ hange does not roll in on
I the wheels of inevitability,
V_y but comes through contin
uous struggle. And so we must
straighten our backs and work for
our freedom. A man can't ride you
unless your back is bent." Martin
Luther King, Jr.
It has been over 53 years since
the Dalai Lama and thousands of
Tibetan exiles first set foot in
Tezpur, India. Who knows when
they will be able to set foot on then
native soil again.
Growing up as a Tibetan, I share
my people's agony and the dire need
to return to our homeland. I write
this not only to shed light on the
Tibetan issue, but to urge all of you
living in a free country to come to
the aid of my people's cause before it
is too late.
In the high plateaus of Tibet, the
Tibetan population is diminishing as
the Chinese government encour
ages mass Han Chinese migration
to the area. The opening of the
Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006 fur
ther acted as a catalyst to the
Sinicization of Tibet, resulting in the
ongoing degeneration of Tibetan
identity, culture and religion. The
Chinese government's effort to halt
the flow of information out of Tibet
has been a consistent success in
enlarging the gap between fact and
cynical fabrication. By enchanting
the world community with its make
believe stories of Tibet's history and
current situation, the Chinese gov
ernment has been able to control the
dissemination of factual information
and mute international criticism.
The recent wave of Tibetan self
immolations and protests reflect
pervasive anger over the lack of
human rights and fundamental free
doms in Tibet under the Chinese
government. In the early morning
of Dec. 17,2010, Ibnisian street ven
dor Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on
fire and fanned the flames of the
Tunisian Revolution and the wider
Arab Spring. Since February of
2009, at least 62 Tibetans have self
immolated inside Tibet, and all but
10 have died. In October 2012 alone,
10 people self-immolated. So why
haven't the Tibetan self-immola
tions received as much attention as
the Bouazizi incident?
Revolutions against tyranny can
never really succeed until they
become the right thing at the right
time. Bouazizi's sacrifice took place
at an opportune moment, and he
became a catalyst for a wave of
revolts that shook the Middle East.
That is why the recent string of
Tibetan self-immolations have failed
to stir up the political clamor that
Bouazizi started.
Second, Tibetan Buddhism plays
a central role in the lives of
Tibetans. The Dalai Lama, our reli

gious leader, has a special place in
our hearts. The Chinese Communist
Party's constant accusation of the
Dalai Lama as a "splittist" and as
the mastermind behind the self
immolations is a direct assailment
on our faith and belief. Since the
2008 Tibetan unrest and the subse
quent crackdown inside Tibet, the
Communist Party has been reluc
tant to find the root cause of this
calamity, but instead accuses the
Dalai Lama for inciting a spate of
protests and self-immolations in
Tibet. It is no accident that after
every political uproar in Tibet,
Chinese authorities move quickly to
confiscate pictures, videos and bod
ies of the self-immolators; they are
well aware of the impact of such
iconic demonstrations.
Self-immolations by Tibetans
reflect a deep sense of despair and
affliction. In accordance with our
deep faith in Tibetan Buddhism,
self-immolation is not and should
not be viewed as suicide. In the
words of Jampa Gyaco Geshe
Rinpoche, "The self-immolation of
the Tibetan monks, nuns and lay
men do not violate the Buddhist
teachings of no killing, nor is it con
trary to Buddhist views, nor does it
violate any other religious com
mandment, because their motiva
tion and purpose is in no way con
taminated by selfish personal gain,
but rather is done to protect and
sustain the Buddhist doctrine, to
fight for democracy and freedom of
the Tibetan people."
For nearly six decades, China
has violently suppressed Tibet.
Tibet's hope for political, ethnic, cul
tural and religious sovereignty has
been diminished by the minute.
With absolutely no avenues through
which to exercise fundamental
rights, self-immolation has become
the sole way to raise awareness on
the Tibetan issue. It is the
Communist regime and its repres
sive policies over many years that
have driven Tibetans inside Tibet to
such extreme actions.
Self-immolation is a very painful
yet exceptionally courageous act.
Some critics beg the people of Tibet
to seek other ways of expressing
their feelings. But when the rights
of the people come not from their
creator, as they should, but are
instead controlled by an oppressive
government and its leaders,
Tibetans have few other options.
As the citizen of a free country
built on the principles of a free
republic, I urge you to have a better
understanding of the occurring self
immolations and help us in bringing
change to Tibet. Tibetans' pain and
sense of crisis should not be difficult
to understand.
