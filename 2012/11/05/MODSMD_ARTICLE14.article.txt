## ELECTION WOES 
### Alex Kennedy | STAFF WRITER 
Election day looms ahead, even though
we're only just fresh out of the midterm
woods of weeks five and six. With so much
on the line this Tuesday, and with two very dif
ferent political paths riding on the presidential
election, tensions are running high even on this
happiest and sunniest of campuses. For the sake
of your nail beds, back pain and blood pressure,
Intermission has compiled a list of the top five
ways to scratch that political itch until the ballots
are in.

This election, more than any other, has
underscored the growing importance of social
media in political participation. While there's still
a lot of theorizing, research and studying to do
before we go making predictions about the future
roles of Twitter, Facebook, etc. in elections, there
are a handful of hysterical contributions to the
field, and especially for us technology-proficient
youths.
One genre we recommend is the
@YABOY/YAGIRL accounts. Be sure to check out
@YABOYMITT for tidbits of wisdom like "i dont
understand poverty like get money b" and "my
favorite part in Bambi is when his mom gets
killed 10l capitalism." See also the Obama coun
terpart @YABOYOBAMA ("Drake just called me
crying again. Starting to regret giving him my
number in exchange for Rihanna's.), and the not
political but equally hilarious @YABOYBILLNYE
if you need a break from the politics game.
| You Tube therapy
Unlike Facebook, with its endless comment
fueled flame wars, You Tube is a social media plat
form that lends itself to popularizing some of the
funnier political commentaries. Though a few
week's old, College Humor's "Mitt Romney style"
parody is a classic video which offers an impres
sive and detail-oriented imitation of PSY's sensa
tion, "Gangnam Style."
If you socialize with some of the more liber
al-leaning circles at Stanford, you may have also

seen FullFrontalFreedom's One Direction parody,
"Disclosure," which features several scantily clad,
studly-looking men calling (or singing, rather)
for Romney to disclose his full tax returns.
Also not to be missed are the classics by Bad
Lip Reading (BLR), including the recent debate
edition ("Eye of the Sparrow"). Intermission will
always carry a torch for the Herman Cain edition
("I could prob'ly freak on you!" Too good!).
■ Get your adrenaline pumping ... go
base jumping!
Because carpe diem and all that jazz, right?
But seriously, seize these couple days to do your
high-risk extracurriculars, 'cause you'll want that
spinal trauma covered by insurance companies.
It'll be pretty darn expensive to foot the bill for
even a handful of CT scans and the ambulance
ride. Might as well rack up those injuries (and
bills, bills, bills, in the immortal words of
Destiny's Child) now, or you run the risk that
Romney gets elected before you're admitted to the
hospital and immediately swipes that coverage. I
hear it's happening on literally his first day, eh?
| Consider the counterfactuals
Which is to say, think about all the potential
ly scarier or more disastrous turns this election
could have taken. The easiest way to do this is, of
course, to watch "Game Change," and at the end,
when it closes by hinting at the implications of
Sarah Palin's meteoric rise to popularity, breathe
a sigh of relief that Sarah Palin didn't run for
president this year.
■ VOTE
Do your part to stand up for what you
believe in and send our fair country in the direc
tion you believe it should be going. Yes,
California's no swing state, but you can still take the
opportunity to exercise your right as a citizen, and
to actually make a difference in a lot of non-presi
dential races, like state propositions and local gov
ernment races. Retweets are not actually votes, so
send in your absentee ballots or get your asses to
the polls on Tuesday!
