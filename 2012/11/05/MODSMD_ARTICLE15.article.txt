# IN GOOD TASTE:
## Sweet Treats 
### Rachel Zarrow | STAFF WRITER 
After dinner in Palo Alto, one has
two options for nightlife: beer
or frozen yogurt. When it's too
early for beer, or when it's just time for
something sweet, the Palo Alto dessert
scene seems to be a barren landscape
offering only froyo and the occasional
cupcake.
But tucked behind floor-to-ceiling
windows, chef cases of the sweetest treats
await those willing to search.
When I'm craving a hit of the
strong stuff — rich, dark chocolate I
like to treat myself to a truffle at
Monique's Chocolates. Monique's,
located on Bryant Street, is truly one of

Palo Alto's hidden
gems. And
though it J
opened in 2010, I
not many stu- |
dents know it

exists. Proprietor
Mark West makes the
truffles in house with

chocolate from all over
the globe. Monique's also has a build
your-own hot chocolate menu; cus
tomers can choose the chocolate (in per
centage ranging from milk to dark), the
liquid (milks, water, etc.) and the spices.
Another specialty is the s'more, a bar
made of all of the traditional s'mores
ingredients but served flambeed.
At Monique's, the specialty truffles
change seasonally; my current favorite is
the chai truffle, spiced with chai and
topped with crystallized gin-

ger. In a similar stroke of creative genius
a few years ago, West developed a back
to-school truffle with peanut butter and
jelly. For Halloween this year, one of the
truffles is studded with peppercorns, and
another contains bits of spicy red pepper.
To satisfy any other sugar cravings,
one can delight in Chantal Guillon, a
small sweet spot specializing in mac
arons made with all-natural ingredi
ents, which just opened downtown.
Although purists might cringe, my
favorite flavors were the pumpkin and
the red velvet. The pumpkin macaron
filled with a creamy puree wasn't too
heavy on the spices. The red velvet,
which some consider the nouveau riche
of macaron flavors, was surprisingly
sweet, more like classic cupcake frosting
rather than ordinary macaron filling.
The best part about the spread of
options is that rather than tasting like
imitations, the flavors taste exacdy as
they should. The only downside is that
Chantal Guillon closes pretty early, at
8:00 p.m. on Friday and 9:00 p.m. on
Saturday, making it less than ideal for
post-party snacking.
While both Monique's and Chantal
Guillon do well with the classics per
fectly composed truffles at the former
and crumbly pistachio macarons at the
latter both shops triumph with their
seasonal specials. I recommend that you
try both spots, especially before an
upcoming holiday. That way, you can try
one of the seasonal specials and buy all
of your holiday gifts.
