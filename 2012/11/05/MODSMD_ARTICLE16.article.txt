# Obaminey's Sartorial Showdown:
## WHICH CANDIDATE WORE IT BETTER? 
### Renjie Wong | FELLOW 
As far as politics goes, the October presidential debates
were hilariously non sequitur Foreign policy? Yes,
but let's talk about my plans for the economy first. Yet
Intermission felt the fashion frenzy of the thrilling
exchange of style ripostes between President Obama
and Gov. Romney. We haven't seen this level of sarto
rial substance in Presidential candidates since JFK.
As we eagerly await the election outcome, we
take a look at the two candidates' fashion mettle
and their wives', too.

Suits
While both politicians were excellently turned
out, President Obama's suits, unfortunately, weren't
quite as well fitted as they should have been. His shoul
der line extended a little too far, which, when com
bined with the soft, unpadded tailoring of his suit,
made him look somewhat shriveled and shabby â€”
perhaps not the best look for our head of state.
Romney, in opting for a more modern fit, came across a lot
sprightlier than the POTUS, whose pants were also distractingly
loose a la grandpa. Guess the economy isn't the only one in need
of a little Taylorism.

The key (or is it donkey?)
to being sartoriaUy bullet
proof is avoiding the

Obama s handcrafted
suits from Roman tailor

make even McCarthy proud.
While he wasn't by any
means sloppy-looking,
Obama could definitely
have stepped up his game;
the point hence goes to the
ever-fashionable Romney. J

Accessories
Accoutrements-wise, Republicans are tradi
tionally the more stylish of the lot the RNC is,
after all, our preferred source of formal wear inspi
ration and Gov. Romney, who appears not to
have met a repp tie he did not like, clearly has a

far more exciting tie rack than President
Obama.
We would, however, have to hand the tie
knot award to Obama. Wisely avoiding the
chunky, stiff Windsor knot
favored by Romney and pick-

>Hey
Barack, are
those your
grandpa's
pants?

ing perfectly craft
ed, narrower four
in-hand knots that
frame his lean face
and stature far better, Obama proved
that he has the swag locked down
and his omnipresent tie dimple con
firms it all. Besides, the four-in-hand

is much easier to craft, and we'd like to think that our com
mander in chief spends more of his morning routine assess
ing the state of our economy than navigating the intrica
cies of necktie niggles.

And no, Gov. Romney, no presidential candidate
Republican or otherwise ever needs a lapel pin of such
elephantine proportions. Perhaps he could take a cue from
our shrinking navy/horse/bayonet populations by wearing a
subtler pin, before it veers irrevocably into
nametag-at-business-conference territory.

pocket squares and tie bars, but gone are the
glory days of Truman's horn-rims and Wilson's
club collars. Meanwhile, President Obama,
help yourself to this point.

Presidential partners
\ One could hardly watch the
debates and not notice the ele

out of their traditional
binders.

It surely is a daunting
task to go up against some
one who has been variously
compared to every style icon

we'd argue that Ann Romney
admirably held her own. Noticeably

Bush.
The FLOTUS, on the
other hand, kept to her
signature youthful
V style, scoring major
| PR points with the
fashion crowd by a)
wearing exalted

emerging designers like Preen and Thorn Browne, and b) re
wearing her outfits. We didn't forget the (first) lady who
popularized Prabal Gurung also keeps her consumer cool.
The first lady fashion faceoff came to a head when both
women showed up at the second debate in identical shades
of Pepto-Bismol pink, with Michelle Obama in a Michael
Kors dress-and-bolero-jacket number, and Ann Romney in a
cap-sleeved tweed shift dress by her go-to designer.
Many debates have been had in the Intermission news
room over this issue, but the verdict falls in favor of the
impeccable Michelle O. The model-armed first lady wins top
spot with her youthful yet regal sartorial sensibilities.
The final verdict: Who wore it better?
Ultimately, President Obama and his team come out tops
in the fashion debate if the elections were solely based on
dress sense, we'd go right ahead and endorse the man.
Whoever becomes the next POTUS this Tuesday,

though, we wish him all the best in his sartori- JL
al endeavors. *J
