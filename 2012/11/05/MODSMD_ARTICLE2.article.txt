## Long-term decrease in double majors Increase in major unit requirements may be reason for declining interest 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
Human biology and political science: two sub
jects that, on the surface, appear* to be quite differ
ent. Eric Mattson 'l5, however, finds his passion in
the reconciliation of these two worlds.

"I am interested in anatomy, physiology and
the life sciences," Mattson said. "But I'm also
equally interested in access to health care and
public health issues in general."
Cesar Torres 'l3 also ascribes to the philoso
phy of "one [major] informing the other." As a dou
ble major in computer science and ait, he says tak
ing classes in both of his interest areas has helped
to enrich his designing skills.
Both students are in a shrinking minority of
double majors, according to an October Fhculty
Senate report. While nearly 10 percent of
Stanford undergraduates graduated with a double
major in 1990, that number has dropped by half
two decades later, hoveling just above 5 percent in
2010.

This data might be skewed, according to the
report's author, biology professor Martha Cyert,
because undergraduates in the 1989-90 data set
were not allowed to minor. During the same 20-
year period, the number of students choosing to
minor has grown to encompass nearly 25 percent
of the undergraduate population.
Despite this fact, department chairs say they
have continued to feel the effects of fewer students
double majoring in more recent years. Increasing
number's of units required for
majors in areas like economics,
English, earth systems and
international relations likely
contribute to this trend.

"Undoubtedly the number
of our double majors has
declined in the last few years,"
said Gavin Jones, chair of the
English Department, during
the Oct. 11 Faculty Senate
meeting. "We used to have a lot
of English/Humßio double
majors and double majors in
other subjects, and that's gone
down quite a bit."
Josiah Ober, chair* of the
Political Science Department,
has also seen a drop in students
graduating with a double major
in his department.
Still, nearly 20 percent of
students in the Political Science
Department have a double
major, and 10 percent have at
least one minor, according to
Ober. He said these statistics
are due to the department's
number of major require
ments, which recognizes that
students may have other aca
demic interests outside of the
department.
"I think that the logic is that
we keep that number as low as
possible within the framework
of the units required to have the
necessary command of the sub
ject," Ober said.
Approximately 20 percent
of students in the History
Department graduate with a
double major as well.
According to Karen Wigen,
chair- of the department, the
history major requirement of
65 units is "not a heavy load."
"We value intellectual explo
ration," Wigen said. "That's one
reason why we've kept it rela
tively light. You don't have to
study history from the very
first day in order to be able to
major in it —we don't want
that to be the case. You can
stumble into a history class in
sophomore year and still be
able to major in it. We want peo
ple to be able to find us."
And indeed, most under
graduates do change their
minds once or more while
choosing a major. Mattson
came to Stanford as a bioengi
neering major with a premed
focus. For him, the turning
point was his Alternative
Spring Break experience.
"I went to [Washington]
D.C. on the project to mobilize
voter's during election year;"
Mattson said. "The experience
really solidified my passion for
political science."
Finding room for intellectu
al exploration, however,
becomes difficult for students

double majoring. Students who
double major often have to plan
earlier how they are going to
meet all their requirements in
time to graduate in four years.
"The most challenging part
has been keeping track of all of
the unique requirements for
each major and making sure
that I planned ahead to com
plete all of the respective
requirements in time," Torres
said.

While Wigen said it is
"impressive" that a student
should have the enthusiasm
and passion to delve deeply into
two academic disciplines, she
also cited advantages to explor
ing a variety of courses.
"There's a very high payoff
to taking one course in a field,"
Wigen said. 'As long as it's
deliberate and thoughtful, I
think it's a really good use of
time to explore disciplines in a
specific way, especially as the
disciplines are working very
hard to create gateway courses
for non-majors."
Wigen also points to
advanced language work, study
abroad and research projects
that all enhance an undergrad
uate career.

'You should think carefully
before double majoring at the
expense of all that other stuff,"
she said.

Kirsti Copelend, director of
residentially based advising,
agrees. For her, Stanford is "a
candy shop of opportunities,"
and double majoring is not the
only way of living two passions.
"Choose your major, and
imagine for yourself how you're
going to tell the narrative of
your transcript, and the other
courses you took outside of that
major—it can be just as pow
erful when you're talking to an
employer or graduate school,"
Copeland said.
This philosophy is precisely
the one that guides Mattson's
journey as a Stanford under
graduate. He is heavily involved
in on-campus extracurricular
activities and wants to study
abroad during a quarter. He
acknowledges that he might
rethink his choice of double
majoring if that began to affect
other things he cared about.

"I'll be comfortable with
the fact that if that doesn't ulti
mately come through, I'll still
be able to say that I have a
true passion for the subject
I might just not have a major
in the subject," Mattson said.
"At the end of the day, taking
advantage of all the opportu
nities here at Stanford is
going to be more important
than just being able to say
that I have more than one
major."
