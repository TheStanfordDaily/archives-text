Human biology and political science: two sub
jects that, on the surface, appear* to be quite differ
ent. Eric Mattson 'l5, however, finds his passion in
the reconciliation of these two worlds.

"I am interested in anatomy, physiology and
the life sciences," Mattson said. "But I'm also
equally interested in access to health care and
public health issues in general."
Cesar Torres 'l3 also ascribes to the philoso
phy of "one [major] informing the other." As a dou

to enrich his designing skills.
Both students are in a shrinking minority of
double majors, according to an October Fhculty
Senate report. While nearly 10 percent of
Stanford undergraduates graduated with a double
major in 1990, that number has dropped by half
two decades later, hoveling just above 5 percent in
2010.

This data might be skewed, according to the
report's author, biology professor Martha Cyert,
because undergraduates in the 1989-90 data set
were not allowed to minor. During the same 20-
year period, the number of students choosing to
minor has grown to encompass nearly 25 percent
of the undergraduate population.
Despite this fact, department chairs say they
have continued to feel the effects of fewer students
double majoring in more recent years. Increasing
