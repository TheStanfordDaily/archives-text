# Rhode to the finish line
## Student-athlete to choose between NCAA championship and Rhodes interview 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
On Friday, Nov. 16, Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.S. 'l3 will
fly the 2,300-mile distance from his Rhodes Scholarship
interview in Seattle, Wash., to the NCAA Division I Cross
Country Championships in Louisville, Ky.
At 1:15 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 17, Unterreiner will
leave the starting line at E.E "Tom" Sawyer Park. He will
cross the finish line about half an hour later. He was
informed to be present and waiting for a potential Rhodes
follow-up interview in Seattle by 3:30 p.m. Pacific time on
Nov. 17. There are no direct flights from Louisville to
Seattle.

"It's going to be really difficult to find a flight back that
would get me there remotely close to 4 o'clock, so it's going
to be a tough situation to work out," Unterreiner, also The
Stanford Daily's managing editor of opinions, said.
Unterreiner is one of 10 to 16 finalists from District 14,
which includes California as well as Alaska, Idaho,
Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. The 2012 interviews take
place on Nov. 16 and 17. Winner selections are announced
on Nov. 17.
Unterreiner has said that faced with the choice between
running for his team and interviewing for the scholarship,
he will without a doubt choose the running. He remains
hopeful, however, that the conflict will be resolved.
"Usually interview slots are assigned by a random draw
process, so I emailed them to let them know that I had this
meet on the Saturday," Unterreiner said. "I asked if it was
possible if I could have an interview Friday, and they were
really, really nice and they said, 'Sure, we can give you
that.'"
