# Rhode to the finish line
## Student-athlete to choose between NCAA championship and Rhodes interview 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
On Friday, Nov. 16, Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.S. 'l3 will
fly the 2,300-mile distance from his Rhodes Scholarship
interview in Seattle, Wash., to the NCAA Division I Cross
Country Championships in Louisville, Ky.
At 1:15 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 17, Unterreiner will
leave the starting line at E.E "Tom" Sawyer Park. He will
cross the finish line about half an hour later. He was
informed to be present and waiting for a potential Rhodes
follow-up interview in Seattle by 3:30 p.m. Pacific time on
Nov. 17. There are no direct flights from Louisville to
Seattle.

"It's going to be really difficult to find a flight back that
would get me there remotely close to 4 o'clock, so it's going
to be a tough situation to work out," Unterreiner, also The
Stanford Daily's managing editor of opinions, said.
Unterreiner is one of 10 to 16 finalists from District 14,
which includes California as well as Alaska, Idaho,
Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. The 2012 interviews take
place on Nov. 16 and 17. Winner selections are announced
on Nov. 17.
Unterreiner has said that faced with the choice between
running for his team and interviewing for the scholarship,
he will without a doubt choose the running. He remains
hopeful, however, that the conflict will be resolved.
"Usually interview slots are assigned by a random draw
process, so I emailed them to let them know that I had this
meet on the Saturday," Unterreiner said. "I asked if it was
possible if I could have an interview Friday, and they were
really, really nice and they said, 'Sure, we can give you
that.'"

Miles Unterreiner '12 M.S. '13 will compete in the NCAA Division |
Cross Country Championships in Louisville, Ky., Nov. 17. He is expected to be in Seattle, Wash., for a potential Rhodes inteview hours later.
The Rhodes Scholarship,
which funds up to three
years of postgraduate study
at the University of Oxford in
the United Kingdom, is
annually awarded to 80
recipients worldwide. In the
U.S., two applicants from
each of the country's 16 dis
tricts are selected following
interviews held the weekend
before Thanksgiving.
However, Unterreiner
said that the first interview
on Friday is meaningless if
he cannot find away to get
back to Seattle in time for
the second interview.
"It's kind of either or nei
ther," he said. "If I don't
make it to the Saturday one,
there's really no point show
ing up to the Friday one, I
think, because they're both

mandatory."
While the Rhodes inter
views are scheduled on the
same weekend annually, 2012
is the first year since World
War II that the Division I
Cross Country national
championships have been
held the Saturday before
Thanksgiving. The meet is
usually held the Monday
before Thanksgiving.
Indiana State cross coun
try coach John McNichols,
who proposed the permanent
schedule change nearly three
years ago as a member of the
NCAA Track & Field
Subcommittee, told the Indiana
State athletic department
that holding the meet on a
Saturday would allow more
fans to attend and draw a
larger television audience.
When Unterreiner applied
for the scholarship, he knew
that the meet and the finalist
interviews would be held on
the same day but was not
aware that the time slot

between the championship in
Louisville and the interview
in Seattle would be so nar
row.

"I was hopeful that it
would end up working out,
but the timing was really
strange because usually the
meet is earlier in the morn
ing," he said. "This one is fur
ther in the afternoon, so it's
going to be much more diffi
cult to get back."
Unterreiner is a key mem
ber of the men's cross country
team, finishing 23rd overall at
the team's breakout Wisconsin
Adidas Invitational, posting
the Cardinal's third best time
with a 23:46 finish.
The team is has moved up
to the number three ranking
nationally going into the
NCAA championship after
being ranked ninth in presea
son.
"We should be on the podi
um; I know we're good enough
to do that, and if we have a
really good day I think we can

win the title," Unterreiner
said. "There's no way I could
let my teammates down and
not be there when we have
that chance."

In his Rhodes application,
Unterreiner has proposed to
study philosophy, politics and
economics (PPE) at Oxford
and said he would like to earn
a joint J.D/Ph.D. in history at
some point. He majored in his
tory with a concentration in
history and law, wilting a the
sis on the 1885 anti-Chinese
ethnic riots that occurred near
his hometown of Gig Harbor,
Wash., and is currently earn
ing his pursuing his master's
degree in history as a coter
minal student.
If Unterreiner cannot find
away to get back to Seattle
in time for a potential sec
ond-round interview, he will
still be eligible to apply in the
2013 cycle.

strange because usually the
meet is earlier in the morn
ing," he said. "This one is fur
ther in the afternoon, so it's
going to be much more diffi
cult to get back."
Unterreiner is a key mem
ber of the men's cross country
team, finishing 23rd overall at
the team's breakout Wisconsin

"We should be on the podi

win the title," Unterreiner
said. "There's no way I could
let my teammates down and
not be there when we have
that chance."

On Friday, Nov. 16, Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.S. 'l3 will
fly the 2,300-mile distance from his Rhodes Scholarship
interview in Seattle, Wash., to the NCAA Division I Cross
Country Championships in Louisville, Ky.
At 1:15 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 17, Unterreiner will
leave the starting line at E.E "Tom" Sawyer Park. He will
cross the finish line about half an hour later. He was
informed to be present and waiting for a potential Rhodes
follow-up interview in Seattle by 3:30 p.m. Pacific time on
Nov. 17. There are no direct flights from Louisville to
Seattle.

"It's going to be really difficult to find a flight back that
would get me there remotely close to 4 o'clock, so it's going
to be a tough situation to work out," Unterreiner, also The
Stanford Daily's managing editor of opinions, said.
Unterreiner is one of 10 to 16 finalists from District 14,
which includes California as well as Alaska, Idaho,
Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. The 2012 interviews take
place on Nov. 16 and 17. Winner selections are announced
on Nov. 17.
Unterreiner has said that faced with the choice between
running for his team and interviewing for the scholarship,
he will without a doubt choose the running. He remains
hopeful, however, that the conflict will be resolved.
"Usually interview slots are assigned by a random draw
process, so I emailed them to let them know that I had this
meet on the Saturday," Unterreiner said. "I asked if it was
possible if I could have an interview Friday, and they were
really, really nice and they said, 'Sure, we can give you
that.'"

Miles Unterreiner '12 M.S. '13 will compete in the NCAA Division |
Cross Country Championships in Louisville, Ky., Nov. 17. He is expected to be in Seattle, Wash., for a potential Rhodes inteview hours later.
The Rhodes Scholarship,
which funds up to three
years of postgraduate study
at the University of Oxford in
the United Kingdom, is
annually awarded to 80
recipients worldwide. In the
U.S., two applicants from
each of the country's 16 dis
tricts are selected following
interviews held the weekend
before Thanksgiving.
However, Unterreiner
said that the first interview
on Friday is meaningless if
he cannot find away to get
back to Seattle in time for
the second interview.
"It's kind of either or nei
ther," he said. "If I don't
make it to the Saturday one,
there's really no point show
ing up to the Friday one, I
think, because they're both

mandatory."
While the Rhodes inter
views are scheduled on the
same weekend annually, 2012
is the first year since World
War II that the Division I
Cross Country national
championships have been
held the Saturday before
Thanksgiving. The meet is
usually held the Monday
before Thanksgiving.
Indiana State cross coun
try coach John McNichols,
who proposed the permanent
schedule change nearly three
years ago as a member of the
NCAA Track & Field
Subcommittee, told the Indiana
State athletic department
that holding the meet on a
Saturday would allow more
fans to attend and draw a
larger television audience.
When Unterreiner applied
for the scholarship, he knew
that the meet and the finalist
interviews would be held on
the same day but was not
aware that the time slot

between the championship in
Louisville and the interview
in Seattle would be so nar
row.

"I was hopeful that it
would end up working out,
but the timing was really
strange because usually the
meet is earlier in the morn
ing," he said. "This one is fur
ther in the afternoon, so it's
going to be much more diffi
cult to get back."
