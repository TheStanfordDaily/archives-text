## Palo Alto looks to solve parking shortage 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
Palo Alto officials are looking into
radical solutions to the downtown
parking shortage, going so far as sus
pending rules that have allowed
monetary fees to substitute off
street parking requireemnts for
developers since the mid-1980s.
The Palo Alto City Council
imposed a 45-day moratorium in
mid-October on a municipal code
parking exemption that allowed
developers to pay a fee instead of

creating off-street parking for the
first-floor areas of buildings.
The square footage of upper-floor
development is still subject to the
standard square-foot-to-parking
place ratio present in the municipal
code, which varies depending upon
the type of building.
"The moratorium is very limit
ed," Palo Alto City Council Member
Larry Klein said. "It's just on this
one section of our zoning rules.... It
wouldn't have any effect one way or
another on either future projects or
the present parking problem."
Although Klein said that the

moratorium will have no effect on
parking in Palo Alto, city staff and
consultants will study the parking in
the downtown area during these 45
days to determine the best course of
action to solve Palo Alto's parking
problems, according to Palo Alto
Director of Planning and
Community Environment Curtis

Williams.
"We have quite a few parking lots
around town, and any one of those
theoretically could be turned into a
parking structure that could accom
modate four* times as much parking
as it has on the one level of the lot

The Palo Alto City Council will study parking in downtown Palo Alto to
determine how to solve Palo Alto's parking problems. Store workers
complain that customers have trouble finding parking under city code.
right now," he said.

Williams added that consultants
will also conduct a downtown devel
opment analysis to see if current reg
ulations could be changed to ensure
that new development is not worsen
ing the parking situation.
In the past two years, two devel
opers requested to use the exemp
tion, which Klein said was an unusu
ally high rate. In response, the city
council staff studied the exemption to
determine if it was appropriate to
apply the exemption for these two
developers. Klein said that the devel
opers will likely be allowed to go for
ward with their projects as planned
under the exemption, but that the
city has yet to determine what the
proper parking fund payment is for
each developer.
Williams said that the exemption
never realized its intended impact on
downtown development.
"I don't think that it really played
much of a role in stimulating that
development, initially anyway, and
certainly it isn't needed today,"
Williams said. "There's plenty of
activity as far as development goes
without provisions like that."
The city zoning code caps down
town development at 350,000 square
feet of commercial space, with an
automatic stop on development once
that cap is reached. The code also
requires that the city study the park
ing exemption if the 350,000-square
foot development were to be reached.

However, the code also recommends
that the city conduct that study long
before the 350,000-square-foot cap,
when commercial development
approaches 235,000 square feet.
A recent 50,000-square-foot proj
ect at 101 Lytton Ave. prompted the
city to impose the moratorium
because it put the development
square footage at about 10,000 under
the 235,000-square-foot mark,
according to Williams.
Employees of downtown Palo
Alto businesses have concerns about
parking, especially with regard to the
current color zone system, which
implements different parking restric
tions based on colored signage. The
color zone system allows people to
park their cars in certain areas of
downtown for only two hours at a
time without a permit. Visitor per
mits cost $l6 per day, and permits for
using the existing parking structures
cost over $540 per year.
"There are only purple zones for
miles around my business, and it's
impossible to park for more than two
horn's, especially when I work an 11-
hour shift," said Jeremy Thomas Lay,
an assistant manager at SPOT: A
Pizza Place. "Every two hours, you

can't re-park in the purple zone, so you
have to park a mile away just to go to
work. We've actually lost a couple of
customers because they can't find
places to park around our business."
However, Williams said that the
study is more concerned with long
term permitted parking downtown
and what developers will be required
to provide than with short-term visi
tor parking issues.
"Basically, in all counts we've
done, there seems to always be space
[for visitors]," Williams said. "It may
not be the most convenient, but
there's always space and [visitors
can buy a one-day $l5 parking per
mit]."

Another concern regarding park
ing in the city is non-residents who
park in residential neighborhoods to
avoid paying permit fees for down
town zones. According to Klein, resi
dents of Professorville, a Palo Alto
district, are lobbying the city council
to create a residential parking permit
program that would prohibit non-res
idents from parking in the areas on
either side of University Avenue.
