## Palo Alto looks to solve parking shortage 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
Palo Alto officials are looking into
radical solutions to the downtown
parking shortage, going so far as sus
pending rules that have allowed
monetary fees to substitute off
street parking requireemnts for
developers since the mid-1980s.
The Palo Alto City Council
imposed a 45-day moratorium in
mid-October on a municipal code
parking exemption that allowed
developers to pay a fee instead of

creating off-street parking for the
first-floor areas of buildings.
The square footage of upper-floor
development is still subject to the
standard square-foot-to-parking
place ratio present in the municipal
code, which varies depending upon
the type of building.
"The moratorium is very limit
ed," Palo Alto City Council Member
Larry Klein said. "It's just on this
one section of our zoning rules.... It
wouldn't have any effect one way or
another on either future projects or
the present parking problem."
Although Klein said that the

moratorium will have no effect on
parking in Palo Alto, city staff and
consultants will study the parking in
the downtown area during these 45
days to determine the best course of
action to solve Palo Alto's parking
problems, according to Palo Alto
Director of Planning and
Community Environment Curtis

Williams.
"We have quite a few parking lots
around town, and any one of those
theoretically could be turned into a
parking structure that could accom
modate four* times as much parking
as it has on the one level of the lot

The Palo Alto City Council will study parking in downtown Palo Alto to
determine how to solve Palo Alto's parking problems. Store workers
complain that customers have trouble finding parking under city code.
