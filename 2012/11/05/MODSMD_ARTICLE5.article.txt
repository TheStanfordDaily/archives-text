# HOGAN'S HEROES
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Two things we learned on Saturday:
Not all quarterbacks are created equal,
and sometimes a little change goes a
long way.

Replacing the inconsistent Josh
Nunes under center two chives into the
game, redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan
injected some much-needed life into the
Cardinal offense as No. 14 Stanford (7-
2,5-1 Pac-12) trounced Colorado (1-8,1-
5) in a 48-0 drubbing.
"We knew we were going to give
Josh the first two series and give Kevin
the next series," said Shaw. "Kevin
took the ball and ran with it and did a
heck of a job He is fast, he can run,
he's athletic, he can throw on the move
to the left or to the right. I'm very
impressed with him. We will look really
hard and find a couple negatives but I
feel really good about what he did
today."
While Shaw did not confirm that
Hogan would be the starter against
Oregon State this Saturday, he did say,
"You'll see a whole lot of Kevin Hogan."
The big decision won't be announced
until later this week, but the starting

role could very well be handed to the
dual-threat redshirt freshman, who fin
ished the game 18-of-23 passing for 184
yards and two touchdowns along with
seven rashes for 48 yards.
In keeping with what has been the
theme of this season, the defense gave
the Cardinal a jumpstart when safety
Ed Reynolds intercepted Jordan Webb
for a 52-yard touchdown return on
Colorado's second drive. The junior
Reynolds, who also came up with a pick
six last weekend against Washington
State, now leads the nation in intercep
tion yards and is tied for second with
five interceptions.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek
Mason] just made a call where I was the
free guy and it was triple coverage,"
explained Reynolds. "Once again, it was
the front getting pressure and me
being able to capitalize on the opportu
nity. ... I capitalized and took it straight
to the house."
Stanford's offense looked sluggish
in the early going, seemingly picking up
right where it left off against Wazzu.
Three consecutive passing plays on the
first possession resulted in a three-and
out, and a costly offensive holding
penalty called on left tackle David
Yankey stalled the second drive.
Against one of the worst defenses in the
conference, the Cardinal was once
again tanking in a nightmarish fashion

Senior tight end Zach Ertz had six catches and a touchdown as
quarterback Kevin Hogan looked promising in his first extended
playing time of the year in Saturday's 48-0 rout of Colorado.
