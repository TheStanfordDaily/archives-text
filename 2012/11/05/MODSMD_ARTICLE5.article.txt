# HOGAN'S HEROES
## 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Two things we learned on Saturday:
Not all quarterbacks are created equal,
and sometimes a little change goes a
long way.

Replacing the inconsistent Josh
Nunes under center two chives into the
game, redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan
injected some much-needed life into the
Cardinal offense as No. 14 Stanford (7-
2,5-1 Pac-12) trounced Colorado (1-8,1-
5) in a 48-0 drubbing.
"We knew we were going to give
Josh the first two series and give Kevin
the next series," said Shaw. "Kevin
took the ball and ran with it and did a
heck of a job He is fast, he can run,
he's athletic, he can throw on the move
to the left or to the right. I'm very
impressed with him. We will look really
hard and find a couple negatives but I
feel really good about what he did
today."
While Shaw did not confirm that
Hogan would be the starter against
Oregon State this Saturday, he did say,
"You'll see a whole lot of Kevin Hogan."
The big decision won't be announced
until later this week, but the starting

role could very well be handed to the
dual-threat redshirt freshman, who fin
ished the game 18-of-23 passing for 184
yards and two touchdowns along with
seven rashes for 48 yards.
In keeping with what has been the
theme of this season, the defense gave
the Cardinal a jumpstart when safety
Ed Reynolds intercepted Jordan Webb
for a 52-yard touchdown return on
Colorado's second drive. The junior
Reynolds, who also came up with a pick
six last weekend against Washington
State, now leads the nation in intercep
tion yards and is tied for second with
five interceptions.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek
Mason] just made a call where I was the
free guy and it was triple coverage,"
explained Reynolds. "Once again, it was
the front getting pressure and me
being able to capitalize on the opportu
nity. ... I capitalized and took it straight
to the house."
Stanford's offense looked sluggish
in the early going, seemingly picking up
right where it left off against Wazzu.
Three consecutive passing plays on the
first possession resulted in a three-and
out, and a costly offensive holding
penalty called on left tackle David
Yankey stalled the second drive.
Against one of the worst defenses in the
conference, the Cardinal was once
again tanking in a nightmarish fashion

Senior tight end Zach Ertz had six catches and a touchdown as
quarterback Kevin Hogan looked promising in his first extended
playing time of the year in Saturday's 48-0 rout of Colorado.
and only had a 7-0 lead over
Colorado at the end of the first quar
ter.
Enter Kevin Hogan.
The next six drives resulted in
five touchdowns and a field goal as
the offense started firing on all cylin
ders with Hogan at the helm.
"I was preparing myself to play
as much as they needed me: getting
ready and staying warm," Hogan
said. "So that's what I did."
After inside linebacker A.J.
Tarpley recovered freshman corner
back Alex Carder's forced fumble on
wideout Nick Kasa also one of the
season's hardest hits from Carter in
his second career start Stanford
was handed a short field to work
with at the Colorado 40. Hogan dart
ed ahead for 7 yards on the option
keeper and then found fullback Ryan
Hewitt on the right side for a 7-yard
completion. Hewitt would then
throw a key block on the ensuing
play, allowing running back Stepfan
Taylor to burst through for a 26-yard
touchdown.
Taylor finished the game with 44
yards and two rushing touchdowns
but only carried the ball 10 times
before Stanford built a large enough
lead that Shaw could safely rest his
senior tailback.
Colorado had trouble getting
anything going on offense all game
against the Cardinal's steel-curtain
defense. Six of the Buffs' seven
drives in the first half ended in either
a three-and-out or a turnover. Three
different quarterbacks would come
in for Colorado, but no one found a
way to start the engine as the Buffs
had six first downs all game two
of which were defensive penalty
freebies.
"We had to prove that we could
finish, we know we have a great
defense," said Shaw. "We needed to
prove that we could play 60 minutes.
No matter who we put in there we
have groups of guys who can play at
a high level for us. ...Our guys
played extremely well. It was a great
game plan and our guys played it to
perfection."
Churning out dominant perform
ances week after week, the Cardinal
defense recorded its first shutout in
almost two years, manhandling a
Buffs offense that hasn't been held
scoreless since Nov. 15, 1986, a
stretch of 150 games.
Stanford held the Buffaloes to 97
yards through the ah; but more
impressively sent them reeling back

wards for -21 yards on the ground.
In the process, the Cardinal sur
passed No. 1 Alabama yes,
Alabama â€”to become the top
ranked run defense in the country in
terms of rushing yards allowed per
game.

"As a defense, our goal is to get a
goose egg," said Reynolds. "It was a
blessing today that we were able to
execute. It was exactly how we want
ed; we didn't give up any big plays.
We swarmed the ball and took away
the run game early. We focused in on
who we knew the big targets were,
and it was mainly the tight end. It's
just guys doing their jobs."
On his second drive, Hogan once
again capitalized off a three-and-out
by the Buffs. His back-to-back first
down completions to tight end Zach
Ertz and Hewitt set up Jamal-
Rashad Patterson's 42-yard run on a
reverse handoff. Following
Colorado's impressive goal line
stand, Remound Wright finally
punched it in on third-and-goal at the
Buffs 1-yard line to give Stanford a
21-0 lead with 12:34 left in the second
quarter.
The onslaught didn't end there.
Hogan displayed his quickness
on the next possession by scrambling
for 20 yards on third down and then

connected with tight end Levine
Toilolo deep down the right side for a
32-yard haul. A third-down-convert
ing Taylor run next allowed Hogan
to fool the entire Buffs defense with
a play-action pass, finding a wide
open Ertz in the end zone for a 1-
yard touchdown reception.
"Whatever gets this touchdown,
it works," Hogan commented on the
play. "[Ertz] made it easy. He's been
working hard all week preparing for
the game.... Not all my balls were
perfect, but they made great catch
es. The line did a great job protecting
me and made it a lot easier."
The redshirt freshman wasn't too
bad at managing the clock either, as
he successfully turned a two-minute
drill at the end of the first half into
seven points. First-down comple
tions to Taylor, Ertz and Patterson
moved the ball efficiently down the
field, and Taylor eventually reward
ed Hogan's poise with a 2-yard
touchdown run that also gave
Stanford a 35-0 lead heading into the
locker rooms.

After scoring five touchdowns in
the last two games, the Cardinal
scored four in the second quarter
alone on Saturday.

Stanford came out in the third
quarter with the same level of focus

and execution. After Jordan
Williamson capped the opening drive
with a 31-yard field goal, Hogan
threw a beautiful back-shoulder pass
to Toilolo for a 19-yard touchdown to
increase the margin to 45-0.

The Cardinal offense suffered its
first three-and-out with Hogan
under center toward the end of the
third quarter a drive that was
stalled by a Ty Montgomery drop
and a rare sack by the Buffs'
defense. Hogan's day was over, and
Shaw sent backups Brett
Nottingham and Robbie Picazo into
the game for mop-up duty. Another
Williamson field goal early in the
fourth quarter resulted in the final
48-0 score.

"There's a couple things here and
there that I have to work on," said
Hogan. "I'm going to get in the film
room and get more comfortable. It'll
get better."
Last week, Shaw made it clear
that Nunes was still the starter, but
Hogan would be getting 12-20 snaps.
On Saturday, Hogan ended up get
ting 48 snaps. The redshirt freshman
certainly made a big statement on
the field today, but it's Shaw who has
to decide whether the team is mov
ing forward with Hogan for good.

"It's whatever the coaches want
to do," Ertz said. "Obviously he
played great. I think four incomple
tions for the entire game, that speaks
for itself."
What did the man himself have to
say about all of this?
"Whatever the coaches think,"
Hogan said. "It was a good team win.
Whatever they choose, I'm happy
with."

The Cardinal played perhaps its
most complete game of the season on
Saturday. But take it with a grain of
salt. Given that the brilliant perform
ance came against the worst team in
the conference and that the final
three opponents on Stanford's
schedule are all ranked in the top 20,
the Cardinal has no time to celebrate
the victory.
"It's one game," Ertz said. "If we
don't play well next week, it doesn't
mean anything. It's one game at a
time. That's the way we're looking at
it."
Stanford hosts No. 11 Oregon
State on Saturday in a critical Pac-12
North matchup carrying potential
conference and BCS implications.

"We knew we were going to give
Josh the first two series and give Kevin
the next series," said Shaw. "Kevin
took the ball and ran with it and did a
heck of a job He is fast, he can run,
he's athletic, he can throw on the move
to the left or to the right. I'm very
impressed with him. We will look really
hard and find a couple negatives but I
feel really good about what he did
today."
While Shaw did not confirm that
Hogan would be the starter against
Oregon State this Saturday, he did say,
"You'll see a whole lot of Kevin Hogan."
The big decision won't be announced
until later this week, but the starting

role could very well be handed to the
dual-threat redshirt freshman, who fin
ished the game 18-of-23 passing for 184
yards and two touchdowns along with
seven rashes for 48 yards.
In keeping with what has been the
theme of this season, the defense gave
the Cardinal a jumpstart when safety
Ed Reynolds intercepted Jordan Webb
for a 52-yard touchdown return on
Colorado's second drive. The junior
Reynolds, who also came up with a pick
six last weekend against Washington
State, now leads the nation in intercep
tion yards and is tied for second with
five interceptions.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek
Mason] just made a call where I was the
free guy and it was triple coverage,"
explained Reynolds. "Once again, it was
the front getting pressure and me
being able to capitalize on the opportu
nity. ... I capitalized and took it straight
to the house."
Stanford's offense looked sluggish
in the early going, seemingly picking up
right where it left off against Wazzu.
Three consecutive passing plays on the
first possession resulted in a three-and
out, and a costly offensive holding
penalty called on left tackle David
Yankey stalled the second drive.
Against one of the worst defenses in the
conference, the Cardinal was once
again tanking in a nightmarish fashion

Senior tight end Zach Ertz had six catches and a touchdown as
quarterback Kevin Hogan looked promising in his first extended
playing time of the year in Saturday's 48-0 rout of Colorado.
and only had a 7-0 lead over
Colorado at the end of the first quar
ter.
Enter Kevin Hogan.
The next six drives resulted in
five touchdowns and a field goal as
the offense started firing on all cylin
ders with Hogan at the helm.
"I was preparing myself to play
as much as they needed me: getting
ready and staying warm," Hogan
said. "So that's what I did."
After inside linebacker A.J.
Tarpley recovered freshman corner
back Alex Carder's forced fumble on
wideout Nick Kasa also one of the
season's hardest hits from Carter in
his second career start Stanford
was handed a short field to work
with at the Colorado 40. Hogan dart
ed ahead for 7 yards on the option
keeper and then found fullback Ryan
Hewitt on the right side for a 7-yard
completion. Hewitt would then
throw a key block on the ensuing
play, allowing running back Stepfan
Taylor to burst through for a 26-yard
touchdown.
Taylor finished the game with 44
yards and two rushing touchdowns
but only carried the ball 10 times
before Stanford built a large enough
lead that Shaw could safely rest his
senior tailback.
Colorado had trouble getting
anything going on offense all game
against the Cardinal's steel-curtain
defense. Six of the Buffs' seven
drives in the first half ended in either
a three-and-out or a turnover. Three
different quarterbacks would come
in for Colorado, but no one found a
way to start the engine as the Buffs
had six first downs all game two
of which were defensive penalty
freebies.
"We had to prove that we could
finish, we know we have a great
defense," said Shaw. "We needed to
prove that we could play 60 minutes.
No matter who we put in there we
have groups of guys who can play at
a high level for us. ...Our guys
played extremely well. It was a great
game plan and our guys played it to
perfection."
Churning out dominant perform
ances week after week, the Cardinal
defense recorded its first shutout in
almost two years, manhandling a
Buffs offense that hasn't been held
scoreless since Nov. 15, 1986, a
stretch of 150 games.
Stanford held the Buffaloes to 97
yards through the ah; but more
impressively sent them reeling back

wards for -21 yards on the ground.
In the process, the Cardinal sur
passed No. 1 Alabama yes,
Alabama â€”to become the top
ranked run defense in the country in
terms of rushing yards allowed per
game.

"As a defense, our goal is to get a
goose egg," said Reynolds. "It was a
blessing today that we were able to
execute. It was exactly how we want
ed; we didn't give up any big plays.
We swarmed the ball and took away
the run game early. We focused in on
who we knew the big targets were,
and it was mainly the tight end. It's
just guys doing their jobs."
On his second drive, Hogan once
again capitalized off a three-and-out
by the Buffs. His back-to-back first
down completions to tight end Zach
Ertz and Hewitt set up Jamal-
Rashad Patterson's 42-yard run on a
reverse handoff. Following
Colorado's impressive goal line
stand, Remound Wright finally
punched it in on third-and-goal at the
Buffs 1-yard line to give Stanford a
21-0 lead with 12:34 left in the second
quarter.
The onslaught didn't end there.
Hogan displayed his quickness
on the next possession by scrambling
for 20 yards on third down and then

connected with tight end Levine
Toilolo deep down the right side for a
32-yard haul. A third-down-convert
ing Taylor run next allowed Hogan
to fool the entire Buffs defense with
a play-action pass, finding a wide
open Ertz in the end zone for a 1-
yard touchdown reception.
"Whatever gets this touchdown,
it works," Hogan commented on the
play. "[Ertz] made it easy. He's been
working hard all week preparing for
the game.... Not all my balls were
perfect, but they made great catch
es. The line did a great job protecting
me and made it a lot easier."
The redshirt freshman wasn't too
bad at managing the clock either, as
he successfully turned a two-minute
drill at the end of the first half into
seven points. First-down comple
tions to Taylor, Ertz and Patterson
moved the ball efficiently down the
field, and Taylor eventually reward
ed Hogan's poise with a 2-yard
touchdown run that also gave
Stanford a 35-0 lead heading into the
locker rooms.

After scoring five touchdowns in
the last two games, the Cardinal
scored four in the second quarter
alone on Saturday.

Stanford came out in the third
quarter with the same level of focus

and execution. After Jordan
Williamson capped the opening drive
with a 31-yard field goal, Hogan
threw a beautiful back-shoulder pass
to Toilolo for a 19-yard touchdown to
increase the margin to 45-0.

The Cardinal offense suffered its
first three-and-out with Hogan
under center toward the end of the
third quarter a drive that was
stalled by a Ty Montgomery drop
and a rare sack by the Buffs'
defense. Hogan's day was over, and
Shaw sent backups Brett
Nottingham and Robbie Picazo into
the game for mop-up duty. Another
Williamson field goal early in the
fourth quarter resulted in the final
48-0 score.

"There's a couple things here and
there that I have to work on," said
Hogan. "I'm going to get in the film
room and get more comfortable. It'll
get better."
Last week, Shaw made it clear
that Nunes was still the starter, but
Hogan would be getting 12-20 snaps.
On Saturday, Hogan ended up get
ting 48 snaps. The redshirt freshman
certainly made a big statement on
the field today, but it's Shaw who has
to decide whether the team is mov
ing forward with Hogan for good.

"It's whatever the coaches want
to do," Ertz said. "Obviously he
played great. I think four incomple
tions for the entire game, that speaks
for itself."
What did the man himself have to
say about all of this?
"Whatever the coaches think,"
Hogan said. "It was a good team win.
Whatever they choose, I'm happy
with."

The Cardinal played perhaps its
most complete game of the season on
Saturday. But take it with a grain of
salt. Given that the brilliant perform
ance came against the worst team in
the conference and that the final
three opponents on Stanford's
schedule are all ranked in the top 20,
the Cardinal has no time to celebrate
the victory.
"It's one game," Ertz said. "If we
don't play well next week, it doesn't
mean anything. It's one game at a
time. That's the way we're looking at
it."
Stanford hosts No. 11 Oregon
State on Saturday in a critical Pac-12
North matchup carrying potential
conference and BCS implications.

Despite playing a mile above sea level, Stanford's pass rush was
relentless in pressuring Colorado's rotating quarterbacks all afternoon. The Buffs never got in rhythm and were shut out, 48-0.
Two things we learned on Saturday:
Not all quarterbacks are created equal,
and sometimes a little change goes a
long way.

Nunes under center two chives into the
game, redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan

feel really good about what he did
today."
While Shaw did not confirm that
Hogan would be the starter against
Oregon State this Saturday, he did say,
"You'll see a whole lot of Kevin Hogan."
The big decision won't be announced
until later this week, but the starting

role could very well be handed to the
dual-threat redshirt freshman, who fin
ished the game 18-of-23 passing for 184
yards and two touchdowns along with
seven rashes for 48 yards.
In keeping with what has been the
theme of this season, the defense gave
the Cardinal a jumpstart when safety
Ed Reynolds intercepted Jordan Webb
for a 52-yard touchdown return on
Colorado's second drive. The junior
Reynolds, who also came up with a pick
six last weekend against Washington
State, now leads the nation in intercep
tion yards and is tied for second with
five interceptions.
"[Defensive coordinator Derek
Mason] just made a call where I was the
free guy and it was triple coverage,"
explained Reynolds. "Once again, it was
the front getting pressure and me
being able to capitalize on the opportu
nity. ... I capitalized and took it straight
to the house."
Stanford's offense looked sluggish
in the early going, seemingly picking up
right where it left off against Wazzu.
Three consecutive passing plays on the
first possession resulted in a three-and
out, and a costly offensive holding
penalty called on left tackle David
Yankey stalled the second drive.
Against one of the worst defenses in the
conference, the Cardinal was once
again tanking in a nightmarish fashion

Senior tight end Zach Ertz had six catches and a touchdown as
quarterback Kevin Hogan looked promising in his first extended
playing time of the year in Saturday's 48-0 rout of Colorado.
and only had a 7-0 lead over
Colorado at the end of the first quar
ter.
Enter Kevin Hogan.
The next six drives resulted in
five touchdowns and a field goal as
the offense started firing on all cylin
ders with Hogan at the helm.
"I was preparing myself to play
as much as they needed me: getting
ready and staying warm," Hogan
said. "So that's what I did."
After inside linebacker A.J.
Tarpley recovered freshman corner
back Alex Carder's forced fumble on
wideout Nick Kasa also one of the
season's hardest hits from Carter in
his second career start Stanford
was handed a short field to work
with at the Colorado 40. Hogan dart
ed ahead for 7 yards on the option
keeper and then found fullback Ryan
Hewitt on the right side for a 7-yard
completion. Hewitt would then
throw a key block on the ensuing
play, allowing running back Stepfan
Taylor to burst through for a 26-yard
touchdown.
Taylor finished the game with 44
yards and two rushing touchdowns
but only carried the ball 10 times
before Stanford built a large enough
lead that Shaw could safely rest his
senior tailback.
Colorado had trouble getting
anything going on offense all game
against the Cardinal's steel-curtain
defense. Six of the Buffs' seven
drives in the first half ended in either
a three-and-out or a turnover. Three
different quarterbacks would come
in for Colorado, but no one found a
way to start the engine as the Buffs
had six first downs all game two
of which were defensive penalty
freebies.
"We had to prove that we could
finish, we know we have a great
defense," said Shaw. "We needed to
prove that we could play 60 minutes.
No matter who we put in there we
have groups of guys who can play at
a high level for us. ...Our guys
played extremely well. It was a great
game plan and our guys played it to
perfection."
Churning out dominant perform
ances week after week, the Cardinal
defense recorded its first shutout in
almost two years, manhandling a
Buffs offense that hasn't been held
scoreless since Nov. 15, 1986, a
stretch of 150 games.
Stanford held the Buffaloes to 97
yards through the ah; but more
impressively sent them reeling back

wards for -21 yards on the ground.
In the process, the Cardinal sur
passed No. 1 Alabama yes,
Alabama â€”to become the top
ranked run defense in the country in
terms of rushing yards allowed per
game.

"As a defense, our goal is to get a
goose egg," said Reynolds. "It was a
blessing today that we were able to
execute. It was exactly how we want
ed; we didn't give up any big plays.
We swarmed the ball and took away
the run game early. We focused in on
who we knew the big targets were,
and it was mainly the tight end. It's
just guys doing their jobs."
On his second drive, Hogan once
again capitalized off a three-and-out
by the Buffs. His back-to-back first
down completions to tight end Zach
Ertz and Hewitt set up Jamal-
Rashad Patterson's 42-yard run on a
reverse handoff. Following
Colorado's impressive goal line
stand, Remound Wright finally
punched it in on third-and-goal at the
Buffs 1-yard line to give Stanford a
21-0 lead with 12:34 left in the second
quarter.
The onslaught didn't end there.
Hogan displayed his quickness
on the next possession by scrambling
for 20 yards on third down and then

connected with tight end Levine
Toilolo deep down the right side for a
32-yard haul. A third-down-convert
ing Taylor run next allowed Hogan
to fool the entire Buffs defense with
a play-action pass, finding a wide
open Ertz in the end zone for a 1-
yard touchdown reception.
"Whatever gets this touchdown,
it works," Hogan commented on the
play. "[Ertz] made it easy. He's been
working hard all week preparing for
the game.... Not all my balls were
perfect, but they made great catch
es. The line did a great job protecting
me and made it a lot easier."
The redshirt freshman wasn't too
bad at managing the clock either, as
he successfully turned a two-minute
drill at the end of the first half into
seven points. First-down comple
tions to Taylor, Ertz and Patterson
moved the ball efficiently down the
field, and Taylor eventually reward
ed Hogan's poise with a 2-yard
touchdown run that also gave
Stanford a 35-0 lead heading into the
locker rooms.

After scoring five touchdowns in
the last two games, the Cardinal
scored four in the second quarter
alone on Saturday.

Stanford came out in the third
quarter with the same level of focus

and execution. After Jordan
Williamson capped the opening drive
with a 31-yard field goal, Hogan
threw a beautiful back-shoulder pass
to Toilolo for a 19-yard touchdown to
increase the margin to 45-0.

The Cardinal offense suffered its
first three-and-out with Hogan
under center toward the end of the
third quarter a drive that was
stalled by a Ty Montgomery drop
and a rare sack by the Buffs'
defense. Hogan's day was over, and
Shaw sent backups Brett
Nottingham and Robbie Picazo into
the game for mop-up duty. Another
Williamson field goal early in the
fourth quarter resulted in the final
48-0 score.

"There's a couple things here and
there that I have to work on," said
Hogan. "I'm going to get in the film
room and get more comfortable. It'll
get better."
Last week, Shaw made it clear
that Nunes was still the starter, but
Hogan would be getting 12-20 snaps.
On Saturday, Hogan ended up get
ting 48 snaps. The redshirt freshman
certainly made a big statement on
the field today, but it's Shaw who has
to decide whether the team is mov
ing forward with Hogan for good.

"It's whatever the coaches want
to do," Ertz said. "Obviously he
played great. I think four incomple
tions for the entire game, that speaks
for itself."
What did the man himself have to
say about all of this?
"Whatever the coaches think,"
Hogan said. "It was a good team win.
Whatever they choose, I'm happy
with."

The Cardinal played perhaps its
most complete game of the season on
Saturday. But take it with a grain of
salt. Given that the brilliant perform
ance came against the worst team in
the conference and that the final
three opponents on Stanford's
schedule are all ranked in the top 20,
the Cardinal has no time to celebrate
the victory.
"It's one game," Ertz said. "If we
don't play well next week, it doesn't
mean anything. It's one game at a
time. That's the way we're looking at
it."
Stanford hosts No. 11 Oregon
State on Saturday in a critical Pac-12
North matchup carrying potential
conference and BCS implications.

Despite playing a mile above sea level, Stanford's pass rush was
relentless in pressuring Colorado's rotating quarterbacks all afternoon. The Buffs never got in rhythm and were shut out, 48-0.
Two things we learned on Saturday:
Not all quarterbacks are created equal,
and sometimes a little change goes a
long way.

Replacing the inconsistent Josh
Nunes under center two chives into the
game, redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan
injected some much-needed life into the
Cardinal offense as No. 14 Stanford (7-
2,5-1 Pac-12) trounced Colorado (1-8,1-
5) in a 48-0 drubbing.
"We knew we were going to give
Josh the first two series and give Kevin
the next series," said Shaw. "Kevin
took the ball and ran with it and did a
heck of a job He is fast, he can run,
he's athletic, he can throw on the move
to the left or to the right. I'm very
impressed with him. We will look really
hard and find a couple negatives but I
feel really good about what he did
today."
While Shaw did not confirm that
Hogan would be the starter against
