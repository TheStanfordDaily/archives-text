## Ira Glass on humor, storytelling "This American Life" host details narrative process 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE EXECUTIVE EDITOR 
"Radio is your most visual medi
um," radio host Ira Glass told a full
CEMEX Auditorium on Sunday
afternoon. He paused for several
moments as the audience remained
quiet.
"That's not actually true, but if
you say it in a certain tone of voice ...
Glass is the host of "This
American Life (TAL)," a critically
acclaimed weekly public radio show
with around 1.7 million listeners.
The show uses the power of story
telling to focus listeners on the emo
tional moments that traditional
reporting often overlooks.
Glass played various clips from
different broadcast shows through
out the two-hour presentation and
drew a sharp line of contrast
between "mainstream" media out
lets and his work at TAL.
"Mainstream broadcast journal
ism uses everything in its power, at
all times, to convince you that what
it is saying is really, really impor
tant," Glass said, noting that TAL
prefers to use the "fundamental
force" of narrative rather than dra
matic soundtracks and heavy-hand
ed tone.
"When someone tells a story
about themselves in away that it's
possible to imagine being them... it
just touches you. It's a real thing, a
profound thing, and its something
you can give people," he said.
While Glass said he respects the
work of traditional journalists, as
the presentation went on it became
clear his criticisms were both inci
sive and encompassing.
Glass said the failure of tradi
tional journalism to incorporate the
funny with the serious was a "failure
of craft," and described how the gravitas
and above-it-all nature of network news
had a "weird nervousness to it."
TALs shift from this style comes main
ly in the narrative presentation of the
show. Instead of following a traditional
script of a radio program, interviewing
two sides and providing a brief moment of
analysis, Glass tries to make the listener
feel a sense of satisfaction that only comes
from hearing a great story.
"What's that made of? What produces
that? What creates that feeling?" asked
Glass.
And while TAL isn't the only program
that seeks to tell stories, its success comes
from its stories' ability to consistently
move and impact the emotions of listen
ers.
Glass described one segment, of a
shark-bite victim who endured a punc
tured bowel with no medication, which
caused several intense, physical reactions
from listeners.
Listeners wrote emails, describing
hearing the segment and immediately
beginning to shake and in some cases
black out, with one even crashing her car.
Glass singled out one listener who
described a similar reaction and later told
him, "On the way back home I tried to lis
ten to it again ... "
"That is narrative control," said Glass
to laughter from the audience. "I'm mak
ing her physically sick, and she's saying, 'I
need to get back [to the story]."'

Keeping true to TALs style, Glass
mixed the serious with the funny in his
presentation. Moments before playing the
clip in which the shark-attack victim
described feeling like she was on fire,
Glass was busy making a balloon animal
for an audience member. One thing Glass
wanted to impart to the student members
of the audience was the importance of
amusing yourself in your work.
"The more you amuse yourself, the
better your work will be," he said.
Glass also teased a possible spinoff of
"This American Life," based on an
episode he has already produced called
"This Week." In an interview after the
presentation, Glass stressed he wasn't
sure he would actually go forward with
the idea, but he is currently exploring the
idea of a weekly show, in the style of TAL,
that takes on current news events.

Interestingly, though he said no com
parison would be perfect, Glass used John
Stewart's style of incisive news analysis as
a possible model for the new show.
During the presentation, Glass told the
audience of how when he was a 19-year
old intern at NPR, he would always put
one thing into a segment that was just for
him.

Later, an audience member asked him
if he'd put one thing into Sunday's presen
tation. With a smile, Glass said everything
was for him now. He does the same thing
he did as an NPR intern, except instead of
one nugget per story, he gets an hourlong
radio show.

"If it's not touching me, then there's
no point in doing it."
