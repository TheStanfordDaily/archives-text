## Rumble in the political jungle 
### Tom Taylor 
Tomorrow the serious news
will be invading the con
sciousness of even the most
ardent sports fans. It is, in
case you hadn't quite real
ized yet, the battle for the White House,
Obama vs. Romney the greatest show
down of 2012.

As rivalries go, this is the big one:
Democrats vs. Republicans, America
vs. real America, socialism vs. plutocra
cy liberalism vs. traditionalism, reigning
champion vs. pretender to the crown.
It's perhaps not something that normal
ly breaks into the sports pages, but
maybe it should be; sports and politics
have a lot in common.
Take the fans. Just a few short
months ago die-hard Republicans hated
Romney They saw him as the antithesis
of everything they stood for, almost as
bad as President Obama. Back then he
wasn't yet officially on their team, but
now that he is their candidate, and that
he seems to have a realistic chance of
winning the big prize, that dark episode
is conveniently forgotten; Romney-
Ryan 2012 is suddenly the great hope
that will save America. I have to admit
that however much I hate Real
Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, it would be
a lot easier to forgive all of his many per
sonality flaws if he was—inconceivably
I admit —wealing a Reading FC shirt.
Politics is supposed to be about hard
facts, about serious things. Voters are
supposed to weigh the policies of all can
didates and thus come to a reasoned
decision about which person or party
better represents them, and which will
most ably lead their country Sports,
meanwhile, are seen as ultimately triv
ial. In the face of war; famine, disease or
any of the other disasters that would
seem to threaten our civilization at
every step, sport is nothing but enter
tainment Unlike voters, fans support
their teams through thick and thin, no
matter how terrible their* seasons or
objectionable the people leading or
playing for them may be.
But wait —are they really that dif
ferent?

Many people vote for a party out of
nothing more than family allegiance.
Few; depressingly few; on either side
even read the opposition's plans, let
alone those of their own party And
switching allegiance would be an
unthinkable betrayal.
Instead of trying to create a real
head-to-head understanding of the dif
ferences between what Obama and
Romney want to, and can, achieve once
in office, we force them to square off on
live TV in three presidential debates.
Does anything actually get debated?
No. This is no more than reality TY; a
chance for us to see the candidates tak
ing cheap shots at each other, leaving
the arena bloodied and bruised.
Viewers don't use the opportunity to
inform themselves whom they should
vote for, but merely to further underline
their long-held support for one party or
the other.

Winning is always far more impor
tant than how you play the game, or
anything else—just ask Lance
Armstrong.
Sports journalists often struggle to
be truly impartial when their childhood
teams are in action, but it seems many
of then political counterparts have
refieshingly given up any attempt at a
fagade of neutrality The most memo
rable games in sports history are usual
ly made all the better by a commenta
tor's personal bias —a love of one team
or a hatred of the other —breaking
through. Political commentator's give
this great performance every time they
are on the screen, airwaves or on paper.
Is this a depressing view of the state
of the once lofty ideals passed down by
America's Founding Fathers? Maybe to
you, but I'm not from here; I don't get to
vote anyway Beyond the fear of it
affecting my visa status or America's
next president launching World War
111, I really don't have any political cap
ital invested in this.

No, to me this is great. I can just sit
back and enjoy the mayhem, as both
sides struggle to push their teams over
the line in the dying seconds of the con
test, rival fans insulting and berating
each other fiom the sidelines. There
really doesn't have to be anything ath
letic about a competition to suck us
sports fans in; why else would ESPN
cover poker? Or golf?
Unlike most of you, I'll be watching
tomorrow night's final showdown as a
truly independent fan. I don't care who
wins; I just want a good, close, fight—
the dirtier the better. And with any luck,
like Bush vs. Gore in 2000, this will go to
overtime.

Tom Taylor attributes much of his
apathy toward the U.S. presidential
race to his first experience with the
circus back in "2000 and a certain
"pregnant chad" incident in Florida
