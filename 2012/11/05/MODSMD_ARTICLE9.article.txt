# PAC-12 PERFECTION
## 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It didn't take long for the No. 1
Stanford women's soccer team to
ruin Cal's Senior Day. Less than
four minutes into the game, the
Cardinal (17-1-1,11-0-0 Pac-12) took
the lead and then held on the rest of
the way to finish the regular season
with a 1-0 victory over the Bears.
With the win, Stanford complet
ed its fourth consecutive perfect
conference season and extended its
conference winning streak to 42.
This year's senior class has never
lost a match in the Pac-12.

"Every year our goal is to win
every single game in the Pac-12,"
senior captain Alina Garciamendez
told GoStanford.com. "We really
wanted to finish strong, but not just
because of what it would mean to
our senior class. It was a true team
effort."
It was a tale of two halves for the
Cardinal on Sunday morning in
Berkeley.
Stanford quickly seized the lead
in the fourth minute when freshman
defender Laura Liedle brought the
ball down the left side and passed it
off to sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu. Übogagu slashed
through the box and slotted the ball
back to redshirt junior Courtney
Verloo, who smashed a shot over
Cal goalkeeper Emily Kruger. It
was Verloo's seventh goal of the sea
son, tying her for the team lead.
Stanford kept the heat on the
Bears' defense by earning three
consecutive corner kicks almost
immediately after the goal. The
pressure continued throughout the
first half as Stanford dominated
possession and chances. The
Cardinal had 10 shots from seven
different players in the first half.
Just before halftime, the Bears

mounted their first serious attacks
on Stanford goalkeeper Emily
Oliver's net, including a shot by Cal
forward Grace Leer that smashed
off the crossbar.
The late Cal pressure would be a
forewarning of what was to come
after halftime. In the second half, it
was the Bears who maintained con
trol of the ball and created opportu
nities.
Early in the half, Cal forwards
Leer and freshman Ifeoma
Onumonu continually broke down
the Cardinal defense but struggled
to put shots on frame. Onumonu got
behind Oliver twice but shot high
both times.
A Bear shot off the post with
about 20 minutes left appeared to
re-energize the Cardinal attack.
Verloo made two strong runs down
the right side, but Stanford was
unable to capitalize on the ensuing
crosses. Two minutes later,
Übogagu and junior Sydney Payne
both fired long-range shots that
skimmed just wide of the Cal net.
The last 10 minutes of the match
featured end-to-end action as both
teams had dangerous chances.
With six minutes left, the
Cardinal had the opportunity to
close out the game when Übogagu
broke in alone, but Rruger
stretched high to make the save.
Sophomore Alex Doll got to the
rebound, but a Cal defender
blocked the shot. Although the ball
appeared to hit the arm of the Cal
player, no whistle came, so play con
tinued.
An insurance goal would have
allowed the Cardinal to breathe eas
ier for the final five minutes as the
Bears tried desperately to equalize.
After a corner kick with three min
utes left, Cal had series of opportu
nities, but Oliver and the Cardinal
defense were able to preserve the
win. The junior goalkeeper made
one save to earn her fourth shutout
of the season and 20th of her career.
One cause for concern for the
Cardinal is the status of starting
midfielder Nina Watkins. The sen

ior left the game in the 20th minute
with an undisclosed injury, although
she did return for the final 90 sec
onds.

For paid of the second half, soph
omore Lo'eau Laßonta took
Watkins' place in midfield, where
Laßonta played most of her
Stanford career before moving to
forward earlier this season.

After the game, the Cardinal
officially celebrated its fourth con
secutive Pac-12 championship,
which it clinched last weekend by
coming back to defeat UCLA. The
Cardinal's last three games have all
been decided by a single goal.

"There are no easy games in the
Pac-12," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "That's going to pre
pare us for the playoffs."
Stanford will begin its NCAA
title defense on Friday against an
opponent to be announced Monday
afternoon.

"From here on out, it's a differ
ent mindset," Verloo said. "You lose
and you're done. Every game is
going to be hard from the begin
ning. Today was a great reminder of
that."

Berkeley.
Stanford quickly seized the lead
in the fourth minute when freshman
defender Laura Liedle brought the
ball down the left side and passed it
off to sophomore forward Chioma
Übogagu. Übogagu slashed
through the box and slotted the ball
back to redshirt junior Courtney
Verloo, who smashed a shot over
Cal goalkeeper Emily Kruger. It
was Verloo's seventh goal of the sea
son, tying her for the team lead.
Stanford kept the heat on the
Bears' defense by earning three
consecutive corner kicks almost
immediately after the goal. The
pressure continued throughout the
first half as Stanford dominated
possession and chances. The
Cardinal had 10 shots from seven
different players in the first half.
Just before halftime, the Bears

mounted their first serious attacks
on Stanford goalkeeper Emily
Oliver's net, including a shot by Cal
forward Grace Leer that smashed
off the crossbar.
The late Cal pressure would be a
forewarning of what was to come
after halftime. In the second half, it
was the Bears who maintained con
trol of the ball and created opportu
nities.
Early in the half, Cal forwards
Leer and freshman Ifeoma
Onumonu continually broke down
the Cardinal defense but struggled
to put shots on frame. Onumonu got
behind Oliver twice but shot high
both times.
A Bear shot off the post with
about 20 minutes left appeared to
re-energize the Cardinal attack.
Verloo made two strong runs down
the right side, but Stanford was
unable to capitalize on the ensuing
crosses. Two minutes later,
Übogagu and junior Sydney Payne
both fired long-range shots that
skimmed just wide of the Cal net.
The last 10 minutes of the match
featured end-to-end action as both
teams had dangerous chances.
With six minutes left, the
Cardinal had the opportunity to
close out the game when Übogagu
broke in alone, but Rruger
stretched high to make the save.
Sophomore Alex Doll got to the
rebound, but a Cal defender
blocked the shot. Although the ball
appeared to hit the arm of the Cal
player, no whistle came, so play con
tinued.
An insurance goal would have
allowed the Cardinal to breathe eas
ier for the final five minutes as the
Bears tried desperately to equalize.
After a corner kick with three min
utes left, Cal had series of opportu
nities, but Oliver and the Cardinal
defense were able to preserve the
win. The junior goalkeeper made
one save to earn her fourth shutout
of the season and 20th of her career.
One cause for concern for the
Cardinal is the status of starting
midfielder Nina Watkins. The sen

ior left the game in the 20th minute
with an undisclosed injury, although
she did return for the final 90 sec
onds.

For paid of the second half, soph
omore Lo'eau Laßonta took
Watkins' place in midfield, where
Laßonta played most of her
Stanford career before moving to
forward earlier this season.

After the game, the Cardinal
officially celebrated its fourth con
secutive Pac-12 championship,
which it clinched last weekend by
coming back to defeat UCLA. The
Cardinal's last three games have all
been decided by a single goal.

"There are no easy games in the
Pac-12," said Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe. "That's going to pre
pare us for the playoffs."
Stanford will begin its NCAA
title defense on Friday against an
opponent to be announced Monday
afternoon.

"From here on out, it's a differ
ent mindset," Verloo said. "You lose
and you're done. Every game is
going to be hard from the begin
ning. Today was a great reminder of
that."

Thanks to senior Courtney Verloo (5), Stanford beat Cal 1-0 to end
the regular season undefeated in the Pac-12. In addition, Stanford's
senior class capped its conference career with a perfect 42-0 record.
It didn't take long for the No. 1
Stanford women's soccer team to
ruin Cal's Senior Day. Less than
four minutes into the game, the
Cardinal (17-1-1,11-0-0 Pac-12) took
the lead and then held on the rest of
the way to finish the regular season
with a 1-0 victory over the Bears.
With the win, Stanford complet
ed its fourth consecutive perfect
conference season and extended its
conference winning streak to 42.
This year's senior class has never
lost a match in the Pac-12.

"Every year our goal is to win
every single game in the Pac-12,"
senior captain Alina Garciamendez
told GoStanford.com. "We really
wanted to finish strong, but not just
because of what it would mean to
our senior class. It was a true team
effort."
It was a tale of two halves for the
Cardinal on Sunday morning in
Berkeley.
