## STILL ON FIRE STANFORD SWEEPS OREGON SCHOOLS 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 1 ranked Stanford women's
volleyball team returns fiom a two
game road trip through Oregon on
a high note, with decisive victories
over both Oregon State and
Oregon.

The Card extended its win
streak to an unprecedented 20 con
secutive games and asserted its
position as the leader in women's
volleyball. This is the largest win
ning streak the team has experi
enced since the 1999 season and the
longest streak since head coach
John Dunning took over the pro
gram's reins in 2001.
Freshman Brittany Howard led
the Cardinal with her fifth double
double of the season, finishing with
14 kills and 13 digs. Junior middle
blocker Carly Wopat added 12 kills
on 17 attempts with no errors for a
career-high .706 hitting percentage,
one of the highest percentages in
program history. Junior Rachel
Williams totaled eight kills, seven
digs and three blocks for the
Cardinal, while freshman Jordan
Burgess logged nine kills and 10
digs.

Splitting time as setters, senior
Karissa Cook and freshman Madi
Bugg had 21 and 18 assists, respec
tively. Sophomore libero Kyle
Gilbert finished the game with 20
digs, her ninth game of the season
in which she reached the 20 dig
mark Stanford ended the game
out-hitting OSU .261 to .151.
The beginning of the first set

remained close until Stanford went
on a 5-1 run and took the set 25-18.

OSU did not give up in the sec
ond set, however, and the Cardinal
barely escaped with a 32-30 win
that took extra points to be decided
in the second set. Stanford jumped
out to an early lead, but OSU tied it
at 21-21. From there, OSU and
Stanford would trade off points
until Stanford came out on top.
The third set proved to be a
much easier time for the Card as
the outmatched Beavers weren't
able to keep their momentum
going. The Card won 25-14 and
managed to hold the OSU offense
to just .050.
With Oregon State having won
only three games in conference
play, however, the decisive win was
not unexpected. The bigger win of
the weekend came Sunday in
Eugene against the No. 2 Oregon
Ducks (20-3,11-3).
After beating Oregon in a gruel
ing five-set match in the first half of
the season, the Card expected to
have another tough matchup this
time around. Last week coach
Dunning stressed the importance
this game could have in putting his
team "in the driver's seat" in
regards to the postseason.
After Sunday's win, Dunning's
team certainly has put themselves
in a good position.
Despite playing without fresh
man starter Jordan Burgess, who
left the Oregon State match with a
leg injury, the Cardinal put on one of
its best offensive displays of the
year, outhitting Oregon .344 to .188.
Juniors Rachel Williams and Carly
Wopat led the team with 10 kills
each. Wopat also posted a team-high
nine blocks in the match. Freshman
outside hitter Brittany Howard
added eight kills and four blocks,

while freshman Inky Ajanaku had
five kills and sophomore Lydia Bai
finished with four kills.

Freshman setter Madi Bugg con
trolled the offense with 30 assists,
and added three kills, three digs
and two service aces. Sophomore
libero Kyle Gilbert registered a
match-high 15 digs for Stanford.
Stanford came out on fire, and
from its first possession controlled
the pace of the game. They cap
tured the opening set 25-20 and
posted a .567 attack percentage,
putting down 17 kills on 30 swings
with no errors. Oregon also hit well
offensively, recording a .371 hitting
percentage.
The second set wasn't nearly as
easy as the Card pulled off a 25-22
win to take a 2-0 lead in the match.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead,
but Oregon capitalized on some
Cardinal mistakes to tie late in the
set at 21-21. A 4-1 run by Stanford
held off a late comeback by the
Ducks. Stanford recorded a .321 hit
ting percentage, while holding
Oregon to just .150.
Despite only hitting .156 in the
third set, Stanford completed the
sweep and came from behind to
grab a 25-21 victory. The Card's
defense was what did Oregon in as
the Ducks were held to a .071 attack
percentage. Wopat was instrumen
tal in this defense, collecting four
blocks in the set out of team total of
five and a half blocks.

The Card will continue Pac-12 play
this week at home against
Washington State on Wednesday and
Washington on Thursday, the matchup
against the Huskies figures to be one
of the team's biggest remaining hur
dles in conference play

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshmen setter Maddi Bugg tallied 18 assists in Stanford's 3-0 victory
over Oregon State on the road last Friday. Ranked No. 1 in the nation,
the Cardinal also easily swept Oregon on Saturday and extended its
winning streak to 20 games, its longest since the 1999 season.
The No. 1 ranked Stanford women's
volleyball team returns fiom a two
game road trip through Oregon on
a high note, with decisive victories
over both Oregon State and
Oregon.

The Card extended its win
streak to an unprecedented 20 con
secutive games and asserted its
position as the leader in women's
volleyball. This is the largest win
ning streak the team has experi
enced since the 1999 season and the
longest streak since head coach
John Dunning took over the pro
gram's reins in 2001.
Freshman Brittany Howard led
the Cardinal with her fifth double
double of the season, finishing with
14 kills and 13 digs. Junior middle
blocker Carly Wopat added 12 kills
on 17 attempts with no errors for a
career-high .706 hitting percentage,
one of the highest percentages in
program history. Junior Rachel
Williams totaled eight kills, seven
digs and three blocks for the
Cardinal, while freshman Jordan
Burgess logged nine kills and 10
digs.

Splitting time as setters, senior
Karissa Cook and freshman Madi
Bugg had 21 and 18 assists, respec
tively. Sophomore libero Kyle
Gilbert finished the game with 20
digs, her ninth game of the season
in which she reached the 20 dig
mark Stanford ended the game
out-hitting OSU .261 to .151.
The beginning of the first set

remained close until Stanford went
on a 5-1 run and took the set 25-18.

OSU did not give up in the sec
ond set, however, and the Cardinal
barely escaped with a 32-30 win
that took extra points to be decided
in the second set. Stanford jumped
out to an early lead, but OSU tied it
at 21-21. From there, OSU and
Stanford would trade off points
until Stanford came out on top.
The third set proved to be a
much easier time for the Card as
the outmatched Beavers weren't
able to keep their momentum
going. The Card won 25-14 and
managed to hold the OSU offense
to just .050.
With Oregon State having won
only three games in conference
play, however, the decisive win was
not unexpected. The bigger win of
the weekend came Sunday in
Eugene against the No. 2 Oregon
Ducks (20-3,11-3).
After beating Oregon in a gruel
ing five-set match in the first half of
the season, the Card expected to
have another tough matchup this
time around. Last week coach
Dunning stressed the importance
this game could have in putting his
team "in the driver's seat" in
regards to the postseason.
After Sunday's win, Dunning's
team certainly has put themselves
in a good position.
Despite playing without fresh
man starter Jordan Burgess, who
left the Oregon State match with a
leg injury, the Cardinal put on one of
its best offensive displays of the
year, outhitting Oregon .344 to .188.
Juniors Rachel Williams and Carly
Wopat led the team with 10 kills
each. Wopat also posted a team-high
nine blocks in the match. Freshman
outside hitter Brittany Howard
added eight kills and four blocks,

while freshman Inky Ajanaku had
five kills and sophomore Lydia Bai
finished with four kills.

Freshman setter Madi Bugg con
trolled the offense with 30 assists,
and added three kills, three digs
and two service aces. Sophomore
libero Kyle Gilbert registered a
match-high 15 digs for Stanford.
Stanford came out on fire, and
from its first possession controlled
the pace of the game. They cap
tured the opening set 25-20 and
posted a .567 attack percentage,
putting down 17 kills on 30 swings
with no errors. Oregon also hit well
offensively, recording a .371 hitting
percentage.

easy as the Card pulled off a 25-22
win to take a 2-0 lead in the match.
