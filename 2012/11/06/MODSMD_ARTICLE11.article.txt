# INSTANT REPLAY
## Stepfan Taylor's power burst 
### Winston Shi 
"Power" is perhaps the best (and definitely the
coolest-sounding) play in all of football, and Stanford
football's recent return to prominence was built on its
ability to power run. Put simply, the Cardinal's game
plan is to send waves and waves of blocking offensive
linemen, tight ends and fullbacks to clear the way for
the running back until the defense is completely
exhausted.
Case in point: Last Saturday at Colorado, Stanford
hung 48 points on the beleaguered Buffaloes defense.
The game was over in the second quarter and many of
Stanford's starters sat out most of the second half.
Running back Stepfan Taylor, in particular, did most of
his damage in the first half, putting the Cardinal up by
two scores with this 26-yard touchdown run early in
the second quarter.

Before the snap, Stanford has a first-and-ten
deep inside Colorado territory with 14:37 remaining
in the second quarter. The Cardinal lines up in its
power running set, with three tight ends (X, Y and
Z), a fullback (F) and Taylor at running back (R).
Colorado counters with a 4-3 under defense, in which
the strong side linebacker (S) moves to the line of
scrimmage; a miscommunication has led its best
run-stopping linebackers (S and M) to be placed
away from the right side, where Stanford has the
most blockers.
Determined to stop the run, Colorado rolls down
both safeties (F/S and S) to the level of the M and W
linebackers so they can attack the run faster. The cor
nerbacks (both Cs) play well to the outside because
Stanford is well-known for the quick outside pass to full
back Ryan Hewitt (F) out of the power set, and in fact
threw that exact pass to Hewitt on the previous play.
As the example with Hewitt shows, Stanford often
uses the power set to disguise its true intentions for
example, Stanford faked the run out of the power set
against Cal and threw a 68-yard pass to Zach Ertz
but sometimes when Stanford lines up in power forma
tion, it's because they actually intend to run the ball.
The "power" play is Stanford's bread and butter, and
they run it 15 to 20 times a game.
