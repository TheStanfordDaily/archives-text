## Card overcomes sloppy start 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While many of the faces on this year's
Stanford Cardinal Men's basketball team
are the same as last year's squad that fin
ished 10-8 in conference, there is one
major difference: serious self-confidence.

The Cardinal has not been a threat in
the Pac-12 since Brook and Robin Lopez
packed them bags and headed to the

NBA in 2008, but things appear to be dif
ferent this season. Following a successful
2011 campaign that saw Stanford take
home a National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) championship, head
coach Johnny Dawkins has the Card
poised to make a run into the NCAA
tournament. Led by sophomore guard
Chasson Randle and backcourt partner
Aaron Bright, team expectations are as
high as they've been in the last five years.
The pursuit of a Pac-12 title and
NCAA tournament appearance began
this Sunday, as the UNC Pembroke
Braves traveled to Maples Pavilion to
take on Stanford in an exhibition
matchup.

The Braves got off to a quick start,
jumping out to an early 8-2 lead after
George Blakeney grabbed an offensive
rebound and finished at the hoop for an
easy bucket. The Cardinal looked sloppy,
turning the ball over and lacking any
defensive intensity. However, this trend
would not last, as a quick 8-0 run, high
lighted by a fast-break dunk from
Randle, helped the Card capture the
lead. It would be relatively smooth sail
ing from there, as the Card did not fall
behind again for the remainder of the
contest.
Still, UNC Pembroke managed to

keep it interesting, as Stanford
never managed to pull away. After
Bright set up fellow junior John
Gage with an open three-point look,
stretching Stanford's lead to nine,
the Bruins immediately countered
with a three point bucket of their
own from senior guard Shahmel
Brackett. The two squads traded
buckets for the rest of the first half,
leading up to a three pointer from
freshman Quamain Rose with 26
seconds left to make the score 31-31
going into the break.

The second half would be an
almost identical story, as the
Cardinal managed to hold off every
UNC Pembroke run. Bright, Gage,
and junior Josh Huestis closed out
the game, going a combined six for
six from the free throw line in the
final 3:30. Stanford managed a solid,
although less than convincing, 85-71
victory While then* offensive effi
ciency was high, there are clearly
some holes on the defensive end
that the Card will need to improve
upon throughout the next few
weeks. Still, a win is a win, and
Stanford's confidence should be
high going forward.
The backcourt duo of Bright and
Randle led the way for the Card.
Bright was the high scorer, putting
up 21 points on 5-10 shooting from
the field. This included an 8-12 per
formance from the free throw line.
Randle added 16 points of his own
(7-15 shooting), but was a major fac
tor distributing the ball. His six
assists led the team. Huestis
pitched in with 16 points of his own,
shooting at a 50 percent clip (6-12).
Randle was happy with the
effort, but knows his team needs to
improve in order to reach their lofty
goals. "It was good to start off the
year with a win, but as a team, we
know that we could have played bet
ter," Randle said. "We will look to
improve from this game," he said.
The Pac-12 conference appears
as strong as it has been in the last
several seasons, meaning these
early season matchups cannot be
overlooked with national rankings
and momentum at stake. Thanks to
an influx of solid recruits and
improved player development, the
Pac-12 will potentially regain its sta
tus as one of college basketball's
powerhouse conferences.
Randle agreed, noting that the

team feels it is in the mix for a Pac
-12 title after coaches picked the
Card to finish fourth in the presea
son poll.
"I'm very excited about this sea
son ... and I expect us to do great
things. I feel like we have the talent
to beat anybody in the country, but

for us to achieve our goals, we are
going to have to play tougher,

smarter, and more together than
our opponents."
Stanford's next game is against
the University of San Francisco on
Friday, with tip off scheduled for 8
p.m. from Oracle Arena, home of
the Golden State Warriors.
