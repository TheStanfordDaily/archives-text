## Card overcomes sloppy start 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While many of the faces on this year's
Stanford Cardinal Men's basketball team
are the same as last year's squad that fin
ished 10-8 in conference, there is one
major difference: serious self-confidence.

The Cardinal has not been a threat in
the Pac-12 since Brook and Robin Lopez
packed them bags and headed to the

NBA in 2008, but things appear to be dif
ferent this season. Following a successful
2011 campaign that saw Stanford take
home a National Invitational
Tournament (NIT) championship, head
coach Johnny Dawkins has the Card
poised to make a run into the NCAA
tournament. Led by sophomore guard
Chasson Randle and backcourt partner
Aaron Bright, team expectations are as
high as they've been in the last five years.
The pursuit of a Pac-12 title and
NCAA tournament appearance began
this Sunday, as the UNC Pembroke
Braves traveled to Maples Pavilion to
take on Stanford in an exhibition
matchup.

The Braves got off to a quick start,
jumping out to an early 8-2 lead after
George Blakeney grabbed an offensive
rebound and finished at the hoop for an
easy bucket. The Cardinal looked sloppy,
turning the ball over and lacking any
defensive intensity. However, this trend
would not last, as a quick 8-0 run, high
lighted by a fast-break dunk from
Randle, helped the Card capture the
lead. It would be relatively smooth sail
ing from there, as the Card did not fall
behind again for the remainder of the
contest.
Still, UNC Pembroke managed to
