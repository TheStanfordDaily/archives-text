The last six NorPac women's field
hockey finals have featured Bay Area
rivals Stanford and Cal. This season, only
one-half of the field was the same as No.
14 Stanford took on upstart Liberty
University. The unfamiliar opponent did
n't faze the Cardinal (15-6, 6-0 NorPac)
as it posted a 3-0 win to earn its fifth
NorPac title in six years.
Stanford reached the conference final
by first rolling through Radford and Cal.

In the opening round on Thursday
afternoon in Farmville, Va., Stanford beat
Radford 2-0 in a game that was much
more lopsided than the score showed.
The Cardinal outshot the Highlanders 31-
4 and held a 17-2 advantage in penalty
corners. Only Radford goalie Sidney
Encarnacion's 11 saves kept the game

close.
In the 39th minute Stanford finally
cashed in when sophomore defender
Kelsey Harbin scored from a penalty cor
ner. Junior Hope Burke and freshman
Maddie Secco were credited with assists.
Becky Dru closed out the game when
she scored on her ninth shot of the game
with less than five minutes remaining.
Secco and junior Elise Ogle assisted the
play.

Senior Colleen Ryan and the No. 14 Stanford women's field hockey squad defeated Liberty 3-0 in the NorPac final after
dominating Radford and Cal in the earlier rounds. The Cardinal will next face Miami for a spot in the NCAA tourney.
the third time this season to
advance to the final. With the win,
the Cardinal earned a measure of
revenge. The Golden Bears took
last year's championship with a 1-0
victory over Stanford in the final.
The Cardinal offense, paced by
Burke's second hat trick of the sea
son, exploded to score five unan
swered goals en route to a 6-2 victo
ry,
The junior attacker's first goal
came in the 22nd minute with an
assist from Harbin. Junior defender
Anna Simmons then scored her first
career goal just before halftime to
give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead heading
into the break.
Burke added two more goals
early in the second half, sandwiched
around another goal from Harbin,
to push the lead to 5-0.
For the final nineteen minutes of
the game, the Golden Bears played
with an empty net in an attempt to
get back into the game. Cal broke
Stanford's scoreless streak in the
62nd minute, but Ogle immediately
answered with an unassisted goal. A
late Cal score from midfielder
Shannon Elmitt proved inconse
quential to the result.
The Cardinal completed a tough
stretch of three games in three days
with a dominating 3-0 win over
Liberty. Although this was the
Flames' second season overall and
first playing in the conference,
Liberty entered the tournament as
the No. 1 overall seed.
Stanford continued to be suc
cessful on offense as 10 different
players attempted a shot for the
Cardinal. With less than a minute
remaining before halftime, sopho
more midfielder Alex McCawley
sent a cross in to Secco. The fresh
man then fired the ball past Liberty
goalkeeper Mallory Cuccio to give
the Cardinal the lead.
Immediately after halftime,
McCawley registered her second

assist on a deep pass to freshman
Lauren Becker, who finished from
the right side. The Cardinal iced the
game on a penalty corner that led to
a goal by Dru. It was the senior cap
tain's team-leading 11th goal of the
season.
Freshman goalkeeper Dulcie
Davies recorded her seventh
shutout of the season to help lead
the Cardinal to the title.
The NorPac All-Tournament
Team was also announced after the
game. Stanford senior Becky Dru
was named tournament MVP while
Harbin, McCawley and Davies also
earned All-Tournament recognition.
Earlier in the week, the All-
NorPac awards were handed out
with heavy representation from the
Cardinal. Dru was named Player of
the Year for the second consecutive
year, Harbin claimed Defensive
Player of the Year and head coach
Tara Danielson repeated as Coach
of the Year. Burke, Davies,
McCawley and Secco also were also
named to the All-Conference team.
The Cardinal now moves on to
the NCAA tournament play-in
game, which will be held on Thesday
again from Farmville. Stanford will
face off against MAC champion
Miami (OH) to earn a spot in the
championship field. Stanford is 3-1
all-time in NCAA play-in games but
has never won an NCAA tourna
ment match.
