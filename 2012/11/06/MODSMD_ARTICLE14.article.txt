## Should this be required reading? 
### Emily Cohodes 
I'm a senior, which means I'm
double-checking my list of DBs
and ECs to make sure I gradu
ate. Every time I look over the list of
required courses in the Bulletin, the
thought hits me: Why are Stanford
students not held to the some stan
dard of emotional or mental growth
during their four years on the
Farm? Just as the toddlers at Bing
are expected to meet certain friend
ship and communicative standards
before moving onto kindergarten,
why shouldn't we have to do the
same before we are let out into the
real world, wherever that may be?
As we've seen demonstrated by
students who are forced to stop out
each quarter because they are over
whelmed by academic or personal
stress and unable to manage the
extreme mental balancing act asked
of us as full-time students at one of
the most rigorous schools in the
world, our "depth and breadth" as
individuals does little for us if we are
unable to function in daily life.
Apart from academics, there are
a few essential skills that should be
learned in college. Students should
graduate from an institution like
Stanford with a basic knowledge of
sexual health, relationships (what
constitutes good communication
with your partner, and how to main
tain a healthy relationship with your
partner), mental wellness (i.e. the
causes and symptoms of depression,
what to do if you or someone you
know seems depressed), and basic
listening skills (how to really listen
to someone, not just pretend you are
listening as you finish a problem
set). In an ideal world, we would
pick up these skills outside of class,
on the weekends, and in everyday
interactions with peers, partners
and professors, but my fear is that
in our current overachiever, busy
24/7 culture, these essential skills
are being pushed to the periphery
and replaced by prep for consulting
interviews and what can seem like
thousands of applications for sum
mer jobs.

I view this issue as one similar to
the common principle that some lib
eral parents adopt: Let a teenager
experiment with alcohol while
they're still living at home and then
they won't die of alcohol poisoning in
college because they'll have learned
their limits. It's the same thing with

college students Stanford should
be educating us and making sure we
get these essential developmental
experiences before we're turned
loose.

I worry that these essential life
skills are being pushed out of the
way as we try to meet our academic
requirements at college. These are
things that all students should be
learning prior to having to live in an
apartment somewhere away from
the security of campus, find friends
in a big world where not everyone
has the common tie of Stanford love
and where our ties to the people
around us are put to an even greater
test.

In addition, these courses would
surely de-stigmatize discussions of
such issues on campus because they
would bring an element of universal
ity to the conversation about health
resources among students, would
train students to detect potentially
serious issues in themselves and in
others for the rest of them lives and
would give students much-needed
information about how to deal with
the more personal issues of balanc
ing a demanding academic career
issues that are usually left to fringe
resources outside of the classroom
or relegated to a self-selecting
group of students who naturally
want to get involved with mental
health resources on campus.

I see no other solution to this
issue than Stanford requiring
undergraduates to take at least one
wellness course during their under
graduate career that would focus on
some element of mental health, from
sex education to stress management
to meditation. In an ideal world, I
think Stanford should require stu
dents to take a differently themed
wellness course each year, but I'm
starting with a simple request. In
the post-IHUM era, this require
ment would surely not upset any
great academic plans and might
even help students get through then
course loads. Chances are, knowing
how to talk to your girlfriend may
end up serving you better in the
long run than any gender studies
class on female voices in literature!

requirements at college. These are
things that all students should be
learning prior to having to live in an
apartment somewhere away from
the security of campus, find friends
in a big world where not everyone
has the common tie of Stanford love
and where our ties to the people
around us are put to an even greater
test.

In addition, these courses would
surely de-stigmatize discussions of
such issues on campus because they
would bring an element of universal
ity to the conversation about health
resources among students, would
train students to detect potentially
serious issues in themselves and in
others for the rest of them lives and
would give students much-needed
information about how to deal with
the more personal issues of balanc
ing a demanding academic career
issues that are usually left to fringe
resources outside of the classroom
or relegated to a self-selecting
group of students who naturally
want to get involved with mental
health resources on campus.

I see no other solution to this
issue than Stanford requiring
undergraduates to take at least one
wellness course during their under
graduate career that would focus on
some element of mental health, from
sex education to stress management
to meditation. In an ideal world, I
think Stanford should require stu
dents to take a differently themed
wellness course each year, but I'm
starting with a simple request. In
the post-IHUM era, this require
ment would surely not upset any
great academic plans and might
even help students get through then
course loads. Chances are, knowing
how to talk to your girlfriend may
end up serving you better in the
long run than any gender studies
class on female voices in literature!

Your next required reading assign
ment: emailing Emily at eco
hodes@stanford.edu to let her know
what you think!
