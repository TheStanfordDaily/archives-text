# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## The 						future is now 
### Chris Herries 
One was an old man named
Thurman and I had just res
cued his model airplane from
a tree. He was a professor at
Foothill who came to Lake Lag once
a week to fly his friend's model
planes. His friend had died a few
years back, and Thurman had
promised to fly them. To quote
Thurman, "I am not about to break
a promise to a friend."
Another was a young Yemeni I
met near the summit of
Kilimanjaro. His name eludes me,
but I recall him saying that he was
carrying his friend's ashes to the
top of the mountain.
Mountaineering was something
they had wanted to do together.
There was this guy I worked
with in a South African township
who spent his own money on
recorders so the kids could learn
music. He would even spare some
time to teach them piano.
There was a bodybuilder in
Athlone, Cape Town, who opened
up a gym, at great financial cost to
himself, so that the teenagers would
have a place to go after school. I was
fortunate enough to lift with him.
In Jordan I met with a group of
women who took young girls out of
the refugee districts to participate
in a summer camp. It was a place
for the girls to adventure, play and
make friends. Their memories of
that place will always be fond.
Lastly, there are my parents.
Whenever I tell them about my
summer options, or the courses I
am taking, they comment on how
that is something they would have
loved to do. It was not until last
week that I realized they never had
the chance to do it. Still, I have
never heard a grudging word when
it comes to funding or support.
All these people know that the
most important thing you can do in

life is serve others. For them, serv
ice is never a question. Their serv
ice is away of giving back to the
world. Carrying your friend's ashes
to the top of a mountain is not going
to solve hunger. Being dedicated to
your friends, though, no matter
what it takes, will certainly ignite
change. Putting others before your
self takes the realization that you
are not the center of the world. That
your problems might not be nearly
as large as someone else's. It takes
the realization that your schedule
will never be as important as a
human being.
This all clicked for me on
Saturday morning when my team
mate and I were doing a rugby
workout at Steuber Field. There
was a girls' club soccer game going
on and a little 8-year-old boy had
been dragged by his mother to
watch. I saw him playing with some
of our equipment. Rather than
telling him to bugger off, I invited
him to join us. He ran the agility
ladder and belted out some pull
ups. We even got him a little five
pound weight so he could do some
cleans. I looked at how happy, active
and involved he was and thought,
"This kid is going somewhere."
Sure, it slowed our workout down,
and we had to make sure he wasn't
going to hurt himself, but those
types of things fall by the wayside
when you are serving someone.
That was when I realized that we
are now the present. For all of our
lives we had been the future. Our
parents told us about all the won
derful things we would do, and how
the world would be bettered by our
presence. They beamed when they
thought about how we would carry
their mantle into the future. As chil
dren, we would be lifted onto their
shoulders to get a better view
of the world. Expectations
were pinned to our futures.
That fiiture is now.

The burden of being the
present means we have a
duty to that little boy. We
need to make sure that he
grows up with honest, decent
men to look up to. Ultimately,
we need to serve children like

him. Our lives need to be ded
icated to making the world a
better place, so when we lift
them on our shoulders they
will not shudder at the sight.
If you are at Stanford, I
can assure you that you have
the skills necessary to better
the world. You have the skills
needed to make sure that
that boy does not grow up in
a world at war. To make sure
he does not feel alone or iso
lated. You have the ability to
generate ideas and technolo
gies that can eliminate
hunger and cure diseases.

You can be a motivated
teacher who inspires or a
responsible policeman who
protects. You not only have
the skills to make the world a
better place you have the
mandate.
That mandate does not
begin at graduation. It does
not begin in med school or at
your first job. It begins now.
We are no longer the future,
we are the present. It is time
to start acting like it.

the realization that your schedule
will never be as important as a
human being.
This all clicked for me on
Saturday morning when my team
mate and I were doing a rugby
workout at Steuber Field. There
was a girls' club soccer game going
on and a little 8-year-old boy had
been dragged by his mother to
watch. I saw him playing with some
of our equipment. Rather than
telling him to bugger off, I invited
him to join us. He ran the agility
ladder and belted out some pull
ups. We even got him a little five
pound weight so he could do some
cleans. I looked at how happy, active
and involved he was and thought,
"This kid is going somewhere."
Sure, it slowed our workout down,
and we had to make sure he wasn't
going to hurt himself, but those
types of things fall by the wayside
when you are serving someone.
That was when I realized that we
are now the present. For all of our
lives we had been the future. Our
parents told us about all the won
derful things we would do, and how
the world would be bettered by our
presence. They beamed when they
thought about how we would carry
their mantle into the future. As chil
dren, we would be lifted onto their
shoulders to get a better view
of the world. Expectations
were pinned to our futures.
That fiiture is now.

The burden of being the
present means we have a
duty to that little boy. We
need to make sure that he
grows up with honest, decent
men to look up to. Ultimately,
we need to serve children like

him. Our lives need to be ded
icated to making the world a
better place, so when we lift
them on our shoulders they
will not shudder at the sight.
If you are at Stanford, I
can assure you that you have
the skills necessary to better
the world. You have the skills
needed to make sure that
that boy does not grow up in
a world at war. To make sure
he does not feel alone or iso
lated. You have the ability to
generate ideas and technolo
gies that can eliminate
hunger and cure diseases.

You can be a motivated
teacher who inspires or a
responsible policeman who
protects. You not only have
the skills to make the world a
better place you have the
mandate.
That mandate does not
begin at graduation. It does
not begin in med school or at
your first job. It begins now.
We are no longer the future,
we are the present. It is time
to start acting like it.

One was an old man named
Thurman and I had just res
cued his model airplane from
a tree. He was a professor at
Foothill who came to Lake Lag once
a week to fly his friend's model
planes. His friend had died a few
years back, and Thurman had
promised to fly them. To quote
Thurman, "I am not about to break
a promise to a friend."
Another was a young Yemeni I
met near the summit of
Kilimanjaro. His name eludes me,
but I recall him saying that he was
carrying his friend's ashes to the
top of the mountain.
Mountaineering was something
they had wanted to do together.
There was this guy I worked
with in a South African township
who spent his own money on
recorders so the kids could learn
music. He would even spare some
time to teach them piano.
There was a bodybuilder in
Athlone, Cape Town, who opened
up a gym, at great financial cost to
himself, so that the teenagers would
have a place to go after school. I was
fortunate enough to lift with him.
In Jordan I met with a group of
women who took young girls out of
the refugee districts to participate
in a summer camp. It was a place
for the girls to adventure, play and
make friends. Their memories of
that place will always be fond.
Lastly, there are my parents.
Whenever I tell them about my
summer options, or the courses I
am taking, they comment on how
that is something they would have
loved to do. It was not until last
week that I realized they never had
the chance to do it. Still, I have
never heard a grudging word when
it comes to funding or support.
All these people know that the
most important thing you can do in

life is serve others. For them, serv
ice is never a question. Their serv
ice is away of giving back to the
world. Carrying your friend's ashes
to the top of a mountain is not going
to solve hunger. Being dedicated to
your friends, though, no matter
what it takes, will certainly ignite
change. Putting others before your
self takes the realization that you
are not the center of the world. That
your problems might not be nearly
as large as someone else's. It takes
the realization that your schedule
will never be as important as a
human being.
