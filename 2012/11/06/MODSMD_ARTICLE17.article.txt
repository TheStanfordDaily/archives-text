# Do You MIND?
## Why I'm not voting for Obama 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
On Nov. 4,2008,1 stood with my
father and brother, hand over
hand in a small booth and
pulled the lever to east our vote for
Barack Hussein Obama. There we
were, three black men, exercising a
privilege that our ancestors had
fought and died for, to cast a vote for
the man who would become the first
black president of the United
States. I spent Nov. 5 walking
around a smiling fool, giddy and
hopeful for a future where the sky
was the limit because we'd broken
one of the harshest glass ceilings in
our country's history.
Four years later, my smile is
decidedly gone as is a lot of my
hope.

As someone whose political con
sciousness has grown at a radical
rate this quarter, I largely denounce
the economic and political ideology
that this "great nation" is built upon
and currently employs. I think the
corporate-sponsored two-party sys
tem cheats Americans out of policies
and political representation that
would lead to a fairer society for
everyone but especially for the
poor and brown folk.
And tomorrow —on Nov. 6,
when I cast a presidential vote for
the first time on my own I will not
be voting for Baraek Obama.
The future safety and success of
our nation depends on building an
accord with our global family and on
addressing internal strife prima
rily along lines of class inequality
and racism.

Both candidates and their poli
cies ultimately fail us on these lines,
but especially Barack Obama,
whose intelligence, eloquence and
insight on racial injustice do not
yield us a fundamentally different
outcome than his primary chal
lenger, whom many might say lacks
all three characteristics.

"Some nations may be able to
turn a blind eye to atrocities in other
countries," President Obama said in
March 2011, discussing intervention
in Libya with the rest of the demo
cratic world. "The United States of
America is different. Wherever peo
ple long to be free, they will find a
friend in the United States."

Not only has Obama as president
of the United States ignored atroci
ties in other countries as people
cried for freedom, but he has also
either perpetrated or been silently
complicit in some of the larger
atrocities to face our generation.
As researchers from Stanford

and NYU Law showed this fall, the
policy of unmanned drone attacks
that President Obama inherited
from his predecessor terrorize
Pakistani civilians on a daily basis.
Not only do the drones (the
legality of which is still unclear) ter
rorize people on whom the United
States has not declared war, they
have also caused an unacceptable
number of civilian deaths:

Between June 2004 and September
2012, 474 to 881 of Pakistanis killed
by drone attacks were civilians; 176
were children.

For a Nobel Peace Prize winner
who's spent so long lambasting the
unconstitutional extensions of exec
utive power that his predecessor uti
lized, Obama seems to be following
in many of his predecessor's foot
steps.

And on "terror," Obama seems to
have his hands tied trying to fight
bands of terrorism in some areas
while letting the source of much
Islamic fundamentalism go quietly
unchecked in others.

I'm talking about Saudi Arabia,
one of (if not the) biggest ally we
have in the Middle East, which is
also one of the most fundamentalist
Islamic states notably more so
than Iran.

Saudi's dominant religion is inex
tricably fundamentalist. Osama bin
Laden was born, educated and radi
calized in Saudi. Fifteen out of the
19 of the Sept. 11 hijackers were
Saudi citizens.

Yet, because of Saudi Arabia's
strategic importance to American
interests, we allow them to propa
gate the same human rights viola
tions that we criticize Iran for
even though Saudi Arabia commits
them to worse degrees.
If American interests were truly
about combating terrorism and/or
injustice, we'd have to hold this ally
accountable. Because we don't, all
sorts of questions are raised about
the motivations behind where and
how this country decides to fight
terrorism and where its interests
actually lie.

Harkening back to the presi
dent's comments on being friends of
people longing to be free, we must
also consider the largely silent tale
of the 2011 Bahraini protests
which Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
allies played an important role sup
pressing.

Tens of thousands of Bahrainis
first demanded the right to public
protests and that then* rule by a

Sunni minority monarchy be
replaced with a constitutional
democracy.

Political dissidents, protesting
footballers and even the doctors who
treated those injured, tortured or
killed by state-sponsored bullets,
beatings and tear gas remain
imprisoned.

The Bahraini repression of its
people's secular revolution was not
an isolated incident. Members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council a polit
ical and economic union of six Gulf
states provided security forces to
quash the uprising. Arab revolu
tions were okay in North Africa, but
not anywhere near the oil fields that
provide so much political immunity
to the Gulf region and wealth to the
world.

Our president's words are laugh
able when played back in this con
text.

Obama's words are further
laughable when we consider the fact
that the president unquestioningly
continues to support one of the most
well-known human rights and inter
national law violations of our time
the Israeli government's occupation
of Palestine. Obama continues the
American tradition of giving more
annual foreign aid to Israel than it
does to Latin America and Africa
combined (roughly $8 billion) and
the United States continues to be
one of two forces that block
Palestine's adoption into the United
Nations as a member state.

Finally, we turn domestically to
the fact that Barack Obama has
mentioned topics of race and racism
the least of any president since 1961.
His silence on a very real and
pressing issue is especially infuriat
ing as the incarceration of black and
Latino men becomes the biggest
civil rights issue of our era, creating,
as Michelle Alexander named it, a
"new Jim Crow" caste system of
unrecognized, unsupportable,
unemployable parolees. (Please,
please, please read this September
feature in The Atlantic on "The Fear
of a Black President" for a much
longer treatment of these topics.)
I have felt tempted to vote for
Obama because I could tell those
who come later that "I voted for the
first black president of the United
States," albeit for his reelection. But
racial ties do not smooth over the
larger moral objections I have to his
infuriatingly contradictory policies,
nor should they.
Earlier this quarter, I
read a Facebook status of a
friend who said he would not
vote because both presiden
tial candidates and their par
ties disappointed him.
I shared part of this senti
ment, but I also felt a moral
obligation to vote. I regis
tered to vote in 2008 at the
gravesite of Vernon Dahmer
Sr. in Hattiesburg, Miss.
Dahmer, a local NAACP
organizer, died trying to
defend his family from a mob
attack after attempting to
register blacks in his commu

nity to vote. Surrounded by
his surviving family mem
bers and reading his epitaph
"If you don't vote, you don't
count," I filled out a symbolic
California voter's registra
tion form.

With this legacy of death
for the right to vote in my cul
tural history, I cannot simply
renege on my obligation. And
with so many important
propositions on the ballot in
California, my obligation is
even stronger.
Those of us who look up to
Obama as symbolizing a new
found horizon for black boys
and girls must recognize that
our struggle is only just
beginning: The United States
has become less racially tol
erant since Obama took
office, possibly since the

president has been so silent
on issues of race. We also
must recognize that Obama's
race and his historical status
do not exempt him from crit
icism. Our standards for
judgment should be no less
high because he's "the first."

That Obama has such
intelligence, eloquence and
charm and still espouses the
same problematically con
flicting foreign policies and
exercises the same extrajudi
cial atrocities as his predeces
sors— all with that charm
ing smile makes his
actions even worse.

But don't worry, y'all
I'm not voting for Romney,
either.
