# OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION
## 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
The offensive fireworks contin
ued this weekend for No. 3 Stanford
(14-4,4-2 MPSF) as it scored 18 goals
on Saturday against UC-Davis
before recording a season high of 24
goals on Sunday, trouncing Santa
Clara 24-7.

Four players freshman driver
Bret Bonanni, sophomore utility Alex
Bowen, freshman driver B.J.
Churnside and redshirt sophomore
Nick Hoversten recorded hat
tricks in both games. Two more play
ers had hat tricks against Santa
Clara, and nine players scored in all.
Both games were out of confer
ence, providing something of a
respite from the more grueling
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) regular season schedule.
The top nine teams in the nation are
all from the MPSF, while Davis is at
No. 16 and Santa Clara at No. 19.

"It's nice to have just a break
from MPSF teams," said redshirt
junior goalie Scott Platshon. "It lets
us work on getting in sync on
defense, trying a few new plays, see
ing what's working and what's not
working."

Platshon made ten saves in the
first game, and then was given a rest
for the second game, during which
redshirt freshman Clayton Evans

and redshirt junior Hunter Ploch
split playing time.
The Cardinal allowed seven goals
in each game, a higher number than
they had hoped against these oppo
nents.

Platshon doesn't necessarily see
the goals scored against the Cardinal
this weekend as something to dwell
on, however.
"It was a really good chance for
us work on some stuff and prep for
our game at UCLA where the
defense is going to need to be even a
step better," he said.

Not to mention that this week
end's games were never closely con
tested. Stanford scored the first four*
unanswered goals on Saturday at
Davis, and then they topped that by
scoring the first six goals of the game
against Santa Clara.
With the easy wins, the Cardinal
is now in the midst of a six-game win
ning streak, its longest of the season.
Since its brutal 14-8 loss to Cal over
three weeks ago, Stanford has
outscored its opponents by a score of
87-34.

In that stretch they have scored
at least 12 goals in each game, and
have won every game (except for a
closer-than-hoped 12-11 victory over
Long Beach State) by a margin of 11
or more goals.
Stanford is now in sole possession
of third place in the MPSF standings

with a 4-2 record, trailing 6-0 USC
and 4-0 UCLA. The team has a
chance to surpass the Bruins for sec
ond place if it takes care of business
at UCLA next weekend. Stanford
would also have to win its MPSF
finale against Pacific and hope that
UCLA loses to the Trojans in its final
game.

The Cardinal will be hoping that
they can repeat the offensive variety
from this weekend, as their goal scor
ing has been increasingly limited to
Bonanni and Bowen in recent games.
Bonanni held onto his spot as the
MPSF's second leading scorer, while
Bowen is sixth.

No other Stanford player is in the
top 25 in goals per game. If either
member of the two-pronged scoring
attack is shut down, it has yet to be
shown that other players will step up
and pick up the slack.
This Friday at No. 2 UCLA will
be a big test for the Cardinal's potent
offense, and we will find out if
Bonanni and Bowen have enough
firepower to bring home a victory
against an elite team, or if this past
weekend's prolific scoring success
can continue.

Saturday's contest between
Stanford and UCLA is slated for a
7:00 p.m. start time.

us work on some stuff and prep for
our game at UCLA where the
defense is going to need to be even a
step better," he said.

Not to mention that this week
end's games were never closely con
tested. Stanford scored the first four*
unanswered goals on Saturday at
Davis, and then they topped that by
scoring the first six goals of the game
against Santa Clara.
With the easy wins, the Cardinal
is now in the midst of a six-game win
ning streak, its longest of the season.
Since its brutal 14-8 loss to Cal over
three weeks ago, Stanford has
outscored its opponents by a score of
87-34.

In that stretch they have scored
at least 12 goals in each game, and
have won every game (except for a
closer-than-hoped 12-11 victory over
Long Beach State) by a margin of 11
or more goals.
Stanford is now in sole possession
of third place in the MPSF standings

with a 4-2 record, trailing 6-0 USC
and 4-0 UCLA. The team has a
chance to surpass the Bruins for sec
ond place if it takes care of business
at UCLA next weekend. Stanford
would also have to win its MPSF
finale against Pacific and hope that
UCLA loses to the Trojans in its final
game.

The Cardinal will be hoping that
they can repeat the offensive variety
from this weekend, as their goal scor
ing has been increasingly limited to
Bonanni and Bowen in recent games.
Bonanni held onto his spot as the
MPSF's second leading scorer, while
Bowen is sixth.

No other Stanford player is in the
top 25 in goals per game. If either
member of the two-pronged scoring
attack is shut down, it has yet to be
shown that other players will step up
and pick up the slack.
This Friday at No. 2 UCLA will
be a big test for the Cardinal's potent
offense, and we will find out if
Bonanni and Bowen have enough
firepower to bring home a victory
against an elite team, or if this past
weekend's prolific scoring success
can continue.

Saturday's contest between
Stanford and UCLA is slated for a
7:00 p.m. start time.

Sophomore Alex Bown recorded two hat tricks over the weekend in both of Stanford's dominant victories
over No. 16 UC-Davis and No. 19 Santa Clara. With its offense firing on all cylinders, the No. 3 Cardinal
extended its winning streak to six and hopes to knock off No. 2 UCLA on the road this Saturday.
