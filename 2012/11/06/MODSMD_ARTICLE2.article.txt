# Tubbs gears up for Election Day
## Stanford grad aims for 60 percent of the vote in Stockton City Council race 
### DANNY GIFFORD 
Around 40 students stood in
White Plaza for the Stanford
Democrats' final rally before
Election Day on Nov. 2. Michael
Tubbs 'l2, the 22-year-old
Democratic candidate for Stockton
City Council's sixth district, was
unimpressed.
"I don't know.... This is a rally,
right? A rally ?" he said as he
jumped onto a platform overlooking
the Claw. "This is where I'm sup
posed to be?"
For the first time all afternoon,
the sleeping crowd stood up and
began to cheer.
"It wasn't turned up," he said
after his speech. "I had to turn it
up."

Tubbs has had a bit of practice
firing up audiences, having spent
the last nine months trying to con
vince Stockton that he has the pas
sion and dedication to effect positive
change in the ailing city.

Named "America's Most
Miserable City" by Forbes last year,
Stockton faces unemployment of
17.2 percent and made headlines in
June as the nation's largest city
ever to file for bankruptcy. It has
suffered more than 60 homicides
this year alone.
Addressing Stockton's issues
from a city council seat may seem
ambitious, but Tubbs said he thinks

the city's lack of guidance gives him
a unique opportunity.
"I think, at this point, people are
so clamoring for leadership that
they don't care who it is," he said.
"It'd be interesting to [make
change] from a lowly city council
seat."

Hibbs' opponent is incumbent
Republican Dale Fritchen, whom he
described as "a good man but a bad
leader for Stockton." Tubbs criti
cized the incumbent for failing to
take a leader's stand on Stockton's
crime problems.
"His campaign strategy is...
defeatist. [Fritchen says,] 'Stockton
is going to be crime-ridden, so lock
your doors at night.' That's stupid,"
Ribbs said. "That's not leadership."
Hibbs has convinced some big
names that, despite his youth, he's
ready to lead. Back in May, Tbbbs
made ripples on campus when he
received a high-profile endorsement
from Oprah Winfrey, which made
him only the third politician she has
ever endorsed, joining President
Barack Obama and Newark Mayor
Cory Booker '9l MA '92. More
recently, Tubbs has also gotten local
support from Stockton-area rap
per M.C. Hammer, who led a can
vass for Thbbs and Congressman
Jerry McNerney on Nov. 5.
"M.C. Hammer might be [at my
post-election party]," he said.
"We're going to do it big."

While the big names surely gave
Thbbs a recognition boost, celebrity
endorsements don't win city council
elections. He and his staff, including
a full-time field director and cam
paign manager, have been fundrais
ing and going door to door since
February, raising almost $BO,OOO
and meeting large numbers of his
district's 48,000 residents.
Tubbs believes these efforts are

the keys to his campaign's success.
"I always say that if we raise
more money and knock on more
doors there's no way we can lose,
and we've done both of those things
to the best of our abilities," he said.
Tubbs approached his campaign
with an underdog's mentality, but
that changed on Oct. 21, when he

mindset of an underdog, but after securing endorsements from The
Stockton Record, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and M.C.
Hammer, he enters today's race at the front of the polls.
secured a surprising endorse
ment from The Stockton
Record, which has a circula
tion of almost 50,000 daily.
"[The endorsement] was a
huge deal," he said. "No one
thought we would get it
because [The Record] is a
really conservative paper."

It wasn't until after The
Record's endorsement that
Ribbs realized he wasn't an
underdog anymore and he
set his sights on a landslide.
"I personally would like 60
percent," he said. "I think a
landslide victory would be
g00d.... It would give a nice
little mandate for change. But

as long as I'm in office, things
are going to change."
Throughout the campaign
Itibbs has balanced his time
between politics and his job
as the coordinator of the
University of the Pacific's
community environment pro
gram.

Itibbs isn't running alone,
utilizing his network of
friends and volunteers to
reach the Stockton communi
ty. Christian Beauvoir 'l4, a
friend from Stanford, went to
Stockton in September and
knocked on hundreds of
doors a day. Members of the
Stanford Democrats have
also driven the hour and a
half north to canvass.

At this point, Tubbs is
optimistic.
"I'm not nervous at all,
because I know we've done

everything we can do," he
said.

In any case, he believes
his campaign has been a suc
cess, regardless of the out
come.

"I'm expecting a win... but
if we don't win I think we real
ly showed what is possible,"
he said. "I think we really
inspired a lot of people in
Stockton, but also every
where ... to make communi
ties better places."
Win or lose, the cham
pagne will taste extra sweet
on election night.
"We haven't been drinking
for the last 40 days of the
campaign," he said. "So
everybody's itching for
Ibesday."'
