# SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Men, women cruise past Wisconsin 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's and women's
swimming and diving teams got a
rare chance to compete together on
Friday, with both teams taking on the
University of Wisconsin.
On the men's side, it was the first
dual meet of the season and a great
opportunity to match up against
another ranked program in No. 25
Wisconsin. Coach Ted Knapp was
pleased with his team's performance,
as his squad was able to cruise to a
184-104 victory.
"We got a chance to race a visiting
team, we got a chance to race our
teammates and we got a chance to
race the clock," Knapp said. 'M in all
it was exactly what we were looking
for tonight."
Although Knapp minimizes the
importance of rankings, saying the
real focus is the NCAA champi
onships at the end of March, the
team will likely maintain its position
at No. 3 in the nation following
Friday's result.
The women were equally success
ful Friday, picking up their second
straight dual meet win to start off the
season. For the No. 5 Cardinal, No.
23 Wisconsin proved a formidable
matchup, but in the end, Stanford's
depth held off the Badgers 159-130.

The meet started with the
women's 400-yard medley relay, with
Maddy Schaefer, Katie Olsen, Haley
Sims and Andi Murez picking up the
win with a time of 3:47.11.

The men's squad of Will
Gunderson, David Nolan, Matthew
Swanston and Aaron Wayne domi
nated the field, posting an impressive
3:15.65 and finishing well ahead of
the competition. Next into the wall
was the Stanford B team of Tom
Kremer, Sebastian Wigstrom, Gray
Umbach and Andrew Saeta.

The Badgers' Jenny Holtzen
(10:01.99) took the 1,000-yard
freestyle. Stanford's Allison Brown
touched second with a time of
10:05.65.
In the men's 1,000 free, it was
freshman Danny Thomson dominat
ing the competition. Starting out fast,
he maintained his pace and ended up
lapping the closest Badger swimmer
to take first with an impressive time
of 9:07.31.

Schaefer (1:48.57) picked up her
first individual win of the day in the
200 freestyle, where she out-touched
teammate Maya Dißado (1:48.98) by
under a second. She would go on to
win the 50-yard freestyle to make it
two individual wins on the day, with
the third coming on the 400 medley
relay.

Led by Biyan Offutt (1:39.28), the
men took second, third, fourth and
fifth in the 200 free, losing only to
Michael Weiss, the Badgers' star
swimmer, who took fifth in the
Olympic trials last year in the 400
individual medley.

Both the women and the men

swept the 100 backstroke, with
Annemarie Thayer winning it for the
women and Swanston taking first in
the men's event.

Freshman Sarah Haase (1:03.17)
won the 100 breaststroke, getting to
the wall less than half a second
before teammate K.C. Moss
(1:03.52). Moss (2:16.56) would also
take second in the 200 breaststroke,
with Olsen (2:15.29) getting the win.

For the men it was Mason Shaw
picking up victories in both the 100
and 200 breaststroke, with times of
55.99 and 2:02.81, respectively.
Once again the men and women
teamed up to sweep the 200 butterfly.
Andie Taylor (2:02.30) won it for the
women, and Mack Montgomery
(1:49.26) picked up the win for the
men.

Schaefer (22.81) outsprinted
Wisconsin's Ivy Martin (23.09) by
under three tenths of a second to win
the 50 freestyle.
Jake Hartley (20.48) led the way
for the men, finishing first in a
Cardinal sweep of the first four
spots.

The trio of divers Stephanie
Phipps, Sloan Brazina and
Alexandra Clay swept the three
meter competition.
Kristian Ipsen —an Olympic
bronze medalist in London— won
the one-meter competition for the
men with 400.95 points.
The women's 100 freestyle
proved one of the more exciting races
of the day. Wisconsin's Ruby Martin
(51.36) and Ivy Martin (51.40) fin
ished first and second in the 100
freestyle, just barely getting to the
wall before Stanford's Julia Ama
(51.49).
The men would complete a sweep
of the same event, with Sean Duggan
posting a winning time of 45.57.
Stanford's Andie Taylor (4:55.53)
picked up an individual victory in the
500 freestyle.

Michael Weiss of Wisconsin won
the 500 free for the men, but Robert
Hummel, Burke Sims, Chris Pickard
and Mack Montgomery took second,
third, fourth and fifth, respectively.
Freshman Jaynie Pulte came up
with second place in the 100 fly. For
the men, Aaron Wayne won the event
in his only individual event of the day
with a time of 48.15.

The meet was capped off with the
200 freestyle relay. The women's
event went to Wisconsin's A team of
Ruby Martin, Ivy Martin, Rebecka
Palm and Laura Miller. The Cardinal
men swept the event, with its D team
finishing before Wisconsin's A team
in an event that certainly energized
the team.

This week, the men are looking
ahead to Wednesday's home
matchup with Cal. The women will
have a break in the dual meet season,
with the diving team heading to the
Arizona Diving Invite this weekend.
