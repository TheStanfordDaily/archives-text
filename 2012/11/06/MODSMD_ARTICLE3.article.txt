# ELECTION 2012
## Tech valley leans blue, less excited Leaders concerned about immigration, innovation 
### MARIANNE LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Silicon Valley and Washington
D.C. are 3,000 miles apart, but pol
icy and economics tie them closely
together. Though technology policy
and regulation rarely make it into
candidates' stump speeches, the
policies of the next president will
impact the hiring of foreign work
ers, government investment in
technology and privacy laws all
of which have profound impacts on
companies based in Silicon Valley.

Political trends in the Valley
Silicon Valley, like most of
Northern California, traditionally
votes democratic. According to
Mark Lemley, director of Stanford
Law School's program in Law,
Science and Technology, the
Democratic Party favors big gov
ernment and is more likely to invest
in innovation.
While President Obama received
significant support from Silicon
Valley donors in 2008, there has been
a noticeable drop in enthusiasm for
this coming election. Although Lemley
acknowledged Silicon Valley's demo
cratic inclinations, he noted a ten
sion between support for Obama's
stance on technology innovation
and opposition to government reg-
ulation in the technology
industry.
"My guess is that if you
had to describe a dominant
political philosophy [for
Silicon Valley], it would be
libertarian," Lemley said.
"Neither the Democrats nor
the Republicans are particu
larly libertarian these days.
Republicans want to lower
taxes, but want to regulate
personal life. Democrats tra
ditionally want more govern
ment ... regulation but more
personal liberties."
Bruce Cain, political sci
ence professor, echoed
Lemley in a statement.
"The Silicon Valley is a lit
tle more divided this election
as compared to last," Cain
wrote. "Romney offers lower
tax rates and a light regula
tory touch, but is less invest
ed in green tech."
According to a recent
article published by The New
York Times, some Silicon
Valley CEOs who had sup
ported Obama in 2008
switched allegiances this
year, donating money to the
Romney campaign. The same
article stated that many of
these CEOs find Governor
Romney's business back
ground appealing. In addi
tion, as attention moves to
Internet policy and privacy
issues, many technology
companies find Romney's
stated aversion to regulation
appealing.
Still, Obama has raised
significantly more funding
from the tech industry than
Romney. According to the
Center for Responsive
Politics, the computers/inter
net industry donated a total
of $7,092,464 to the Obama
campaign and $2,966,214 to
the Romney campaign.
Immigration
Immigration policy is
another issue of concern for
Silicon Valley voters. While
the candidates' discussion of
immigration policy most
often refers to illegal immi
gration policy, members of
the tech industry remain con
cerned about the candidates'
decisions with regard to H
-1B visas.
The H-1B visa program
allows U.S. companies to
employ foreign workers with
a particular specialty. At
present, the H-1B program
limits visas to 65,000 foreign
nationals. One of the criti
cisms of the H-1B visa pro
gram is that it causes job out
sourcing. There does not
appear to be a significant dif
ference on H-1B positions
between the candidates.
Obama outlined in the White
House immigration blueprint
a plan to strengthen the H
-1B program, while Romney
favors removal of the visa
cap.
Yet, Cain believes
Romney's stance on immi
gration could challenge his
ability to attract voters from
the Silicon Valley.
"The [Silicon Valley] has
long wanted an easing of H
-1B visa limits as part of a
comprehensive immigration
policy, but Romney is more
committed to a restrictive
immigration policy given
pressure from his activist
party base," Cain said.
Hank Greely, professor at
Stanford Law School,
expressed more ambivalence,
stating that the immigration
of highly skilled workers

could bode well for either
candidate's platforms and
ideologies.

"I think the Obama
administration would be
more open to [the immigra
tion of highly skilled work
ers]," he said. "They're more
open to immigration reform
generally, but, then again
Romney himself would likely
be sympathetic to the high
tech industry's concern to
hire and keep high-tech citi
zens but his party seems
unlikely to accept any
change."
Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo indicated that small
startups in the area are most
concerned about immigration
policy for highly skilled
workers. The majority of her
constituents support immi
gration reform, hoping to
retain a greater proportion of
international students, who
come to the United States to
refine their technical skills.

Venture capitalist Theresia
Ranzetta further emphasized
the importance of H-1B visas,
during a seminar in the
Election 2012 series.
Ranzetta cited that 15 per
cent of tech companies have a
foreign founder or co
founder. She stated that
while the United States is
able to attract technical tal
ent to its universities, the
current immigration policies
prevent such talent from
remaining in the country. She
added that many of the bene
ficiaries of H-1B visas go on
to start companies that, in
the long run, are large net
job creators.

University President
John Hennessy stated in the
Election 2012 panel that his
main concern was companies
deciding to establish interna
tional divisions to make up
for insufficient technical tal
ent in the United States.

Business impact
On Oct. 13, both candi
dates released statements
detailing their plan to grow
the technology startup indus
try. Obama cited that in his
first term he created the
chief technology officer posi
tion, overhauled patent
reform and legalized crowd
funding. Romney stated he
would reform immigration
policy for high-skilled work
ers and create the "Reagan
Economic Zone" or an organ
ization "committed to the
principles of free enterprise."
Predictably, the winner of
today's election will influence
Silicon Valley's future busi
ness practices.
"There is ... the question
of whether companies like
Apple that do so much of
their manufacturing over
seas in China will run into
problems with a second-term
Obama administration com
mitted to not favoring com
panies that ship jobs over
seas," he said.
During his 2008 cam
paign, Obama stated he
would eliminate tax breaks
for companies that out
sourced labor. The president
revisited this campaign
promise in his State of the
Union address this past

January.
"Companies get tax
breaks for moving jobs and
profits overseas. ...
Meanwhile, companies that
choose to stay in America get
hit with one of the highest tax
rates in the w0r1d.... It
makes no sense ... so let's
change it," he said.
In particular, policy
toward China will have an
impact on Silicon Valley man
ufacturing techniques. While

both candidates have empha
sized a tough policy toward
China, Romney reiterated in
the Oct. 22 presidential
debate that he would label
China a currency manipula
tor on the first day of his
presidency.

"One area where Silicon
Valley is probably very con
cerned is Romney's position
with regard to trade and
China," Greely said "China is
practically an adjunct to
Silicon Valley.... Major impli
cations would follow that
would have negative conse
quences for Silicon Valley
and for the whole country.
It's hard to believe he'll actu
ally do it."
Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math
(STEM) funding is also a
major concern.
"The Obama administra
tion has been much more
willing than a Romney
administration [would be] to
invest in science and technol
ogy, to get the government
involved in research and
clean energy," Lemley said.
"One area where Romney
has spoken out is to criticize
the federal government's
investment in Tesla. We can
infer something from that for
support for government
funding."
While Romney indicated
in his statement that the gov
ernment should avoid picking
"winners and losers," he did
state he would "focus govern
ment resources on research
programs that advance the
development of knowledge,
and on technologies with
widespread application and
potential to serve as the
foundation for private sector
innovation and commercial
ization."
Tech policy
In spite of the need for
technology policy reform, the
panelists at Tuesday's elec
tions class agreed that the
majority of lawmakers fail to
understand the technical
complexities behind the poli
cies they wish to implement.
Ranzetta also cited that tech
nology's rapid progress could
make policies obsolete.
Regulation of technology will
continue to be a topic of dis
cussion, regardless of who is
elected.
Congresswoman Eshoo
said Obama's appointment of
Todd Park as chief technolo
gy officer reflected his com
mitment to technology inno
vation.
On Oct. 20, tech industry
leaders released a two
minute video, endorsing
Obama. Linkedln founder
Reid Hoffman and Entelo
founder Jon Bischke were
among the leaders featured
in the video.
"I support Obama
because I personally realized
how much he cares about
innovation and future to
which we all aspire to build,"
Hoffman said.
In addition, Obama has
gained endorsements from
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer
and former Google CEO Eric
Schmidt. Former Hewlett-
Packard CEO Meg Whitman,
on the other hand, has
endorsed Romney.
"If the industry wants to
avoid regulation, it is proba
bly better off with a
Republican president,"
Greely said. "To the extent
they want regulation, like
privacy regulation, they
might be better off with a
Democratic president."

tory touch, but is less invest
ed in green tech."
According to a recent
article published by The New
York Times, some Silicon
Valley CEOs who had sup
ported Obama in 2008
switched allegiances this
year, donating money to the
Romney campaign. The same
article stated that many of
these CEOs find Governor
Romney's business back
ground appealing. In addi
tion, as attention moves to
Internet policy and privacy
issues, many technology
companies find Romney's
stated aversion to regulation
appealing.
Still, Obama has raised
significantly more funding
from the tech industry than
Romney. According to the
Center for Responsive
Politics, the computers/inter
net industry donated a total
of $7,092,464 to the Obama
campaign and $2,966,214 to
the Romney campaign.
Immigration
Immigration policy is
another issue of concern for
Silicon Valley voters. While
the candidates' discussion of
immigration policy most
often refers to illegal immi
gration policy, members of
the tech industry remain con
cerned about the candidates'
decisions with regard to H
-1B visas.
The H-1B visa program
allows U.S. companies to
employ foreign workers with
a particular specialty. At
present, the H-1B program
limits visas to 65,000 foreign
nationals. One of the criti
cisms of the H-1B visa pro
gram is that it causes job out
sourcing. There does not
appear to be a significant dif
ference on H-1B positions
between the candidates.
Obama outlined in the White
House immigration blueprint
a plan to strengthen the H
-1B program, while Romney
favors removal of the visa
cap.
Yet, Cain believes
Romney's stance on immi
gration could challenge his
ability to attract voters from
the Silicon Valley.
"The [Silicon Valley] has
long wanted an easing of H
-1B visa limits as part of a
comprehensive immigration
policy, but Romney is more
committed to a restrictive
immigration policy given
pressure from his activist
party base," Cain said.
Hank Greely, professor at
Stanford Law School,
expressed more ambivalence,
stating that the immigration
of highly skilled workers

could bode well for either
candidate's platforms and
ideologies.

"I think the Obama
administration would be
more open to [the immigra
tion of highly skilled work
ers]," he said. "They're more
open to immigration reform
generally, but, then again
Romney himself would likely
be sympathetic to the high
tech industry's concern to
hire and keep high-tech citi
zens but his party seems
unlikely to accept any
change."
Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo indicated that small
startups in the area are most
concerned about immigration
policy for highly skilled
workers. The majority of her
constituents support immi
gration reform, hoping to
retain a greater proportion of
international students, who
come to the United States to
refine their technical skills.

Venture capitalist Theresia
Ranzetta further emphasized
the importance of H-1B visas,
during a seminar in the
Election 2012 series.
Ranzetta cited that 15 per
cent of tech companies have a
foreign founder or co
founder. She stated that
while the United States is
able to attract technical tal
ent to its universities, the
current immigration policies
prevent such talent from
remaining in the country. She
added that many of the bene
ficiaries of H-1B visas go on
to start companies that, in
the long run, are large net
job creators.

University President
John Hennessy stated in the
Election 2012 panel that his
main concern was companies
deciding to establish interna
tional divisions to make up
for insufficient technical tal
ent in the United States.

Business impact
On Oct. 13, both candi
dates released statements
detailing their plan to grow
the technology startup indus
try. Obama cited that in his
first term he created the
chief technology officer posi
tion, overhauled patent
reform and legalized crowd
funding. Romney stated he
would reform immigration
policy for high-skilled work
ers and create the "Reagan
Economic Zone" or an organ
ization "committed to the
principles of free enterprise."
Predictably, the winner of
today's election will influence
Silicon Valley's future busi
ness practices.
"There is ... the question
of whether companies like
Apple that do so much of
their manufacturing over
seas in China will run into
problems with a second-term
Obama administration com
mitted to not favoring com
panies that ship jobs over
seas," he said.
During his 2008 cam
paign, Obama stated he
would eliminate tax breaks
for companies that out
sourced labor. The president
revisited this campaign
promise in his State of the
Union address this past

January.
"Companies get tax
breaks for moving jobs and
profits overseas. ...
Meanwhile, companies that
choose to stay in America get
hit with one of the highest tax
rates in the w0r1d.... It
makes no sense ... so let's
change it," he said.
In particular, policy
toward China will have an
impact on Silicon Valley man
ufacturing techniques. While

both candidates have empha
sized a tough policy toward
China, Romney reiterated in
the Oct. 22 presidential
debate that he would label
China a currency manipula
tor on the first day of his
presidency.

"One area where Silicon
Valley is probably very con
cerned is Romney's position
with regard to trade and
China," Greely said "China is
practically an adjunct to
Silicon Valley.... Major impli
cations would follow that
would have negative conse
quences for Silicon Valley
and for the whole country.
It's hard to believe he'll actu
ally do it."
Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math
(STEM) funding is also a
major concern.
"The Obama administra
tion has been much more
willing than a Romney
administration [would be] to
invest in science and technol
ogy, to get the government
involved in research and
clean energy," Lemley said.
"One area where Romney
has spoken out is to criticize
the federal government's
investment in Tesla. We can
infer something from that for
support for government
funding."
While Romney indicated
in his statement that the gov
ernment should avoid picking
"winners and losers," he did
state he would "focus govern
ment resources on research
programs that advance the
development of knowledge,
and on technologies with
widespread application and
potential to serve as the
foundation for private sector
innovation and commercial
ization."
Tech policy
In spite of the need for
technology policy reform, the
panelists at Tuesday's elec
tions class agreed that the
majority of lawmakers fail to
understand the technical
complexities behind the poli
cies they wish to implement.
Ranzetta also cited that tech
nology's rapid progress could
make policies obsolete.
Regulation of technology will
continue to be a topic of dis
cussion, regardless of who is
elected.
Congresswoman Eshoo
said Obama's appointment of
Todd Park as chief technolo
gy officer reflected his com
mitment to technology inno
vation.
On Oct. 20, tech industry
leaders released a two
minute video, endorsing
Obama. Linkedln founder
Reid Hoffman and Entelo
founder Jon Bischke were
among the leaders featured
in the video.
"I support Obama
because I personally realized
how much he cares about
innovation and future to
which we all aspire to build,"
Hoffman said.
In addition, Obama has
gained endorsements from
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer
and former Google CEO Eric
Schmidt. Former Hewlett-
Packard CEO Meg Whitman,
on the other hand, has
endorsed Romney.
"If the industry wants to
avoid regulation, it is proba
bly better off with a
Republican president,"
Greely said. "To the extent
they want regulation, like
privacy regulation, they
might be better off with a
Democratic president."

Silicon Valley and Washington
D.C. are 3,000 miles apart, but pol
icy and economics tie them closely
together. Though technology policy
and regulation rarely make it into
candidates' stump speeches, the
policies of the next president will
impact the hiring of foreign work
ers, government investment in
technology and privacy laws all
of which have profound impacts on
companies based in Silicon Valley.

Political trends in the Valley
Silicon Valley, like most of
Northern California, traditionally
votes democratic. According to
Mark Lemley, director of Stanford
Law School's program in Law,
Science and Technology, the
Democratic Party favors big gov
ernment and is more likely to invest
in innovation.
While President Obama received
significant support from Silicon
Valley donors in 2008, there has been
a noticeable drop in enthusiasm for
this coming election. Although Lemley
acknowledged Silicon Valley's demo
cratic inclinations, he noted a ten
sion between support for Obama's
stance on technology innovation
and opposition to government reg-
ulation in the technology
industry.
"My guess is that if you
had to describe a dominant
political philosophy [for
Silicon Valley], it would be
libertarian," Lemley said.
"Neither the Democrats nor
the Republicans are particu
larly libertarian these days.
Republicans want to lower
taxes, but want to regulate
personal life. Democrats tra
ditionally want more govern
ment ... regulation but more
personal liberties."
Bruce Cain, political sci
ence professor, echoed
Lemley in a statement.
"The Silicon Valley is a lit
tle more divided this election
as compared to last," Cain
wrote. "Romney offers lower
tax rates and a light regula

Yet, Cain believes
Romney's stance on immi
gration could challenge his
ability to attract voters from
the Silicon Valley.
"The [Silicon Valley] has
long wanted an easing of H
-1B visa limits as part of a
comprehensive immigration
policy, but Romney is more
committed to a restrictive
immigration policy given
pressure from his activist
party base," Cain said.
Hank Greely, professor at
Stanford Law School,
expressed more ambivalence,
stating that the immigration
of highly skilled workers

could bode well for either
candidate's platforms and
ideologies.

"I think the Obama
administration would be
more open to [the immigra
tion of highly skilled work
ers]," he said. "They're more
open to immigration reform
generally, but, then again
Romney himself would likely
be sympathetic to the high
tech industry's concern to
hire and keep high-tech citi
zens but his party seems
unlikely to accept any
change."
Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo indicated that small
startups in the area are most
concerned about immigration
policy for highly skilled
workers. The majority of her
constituents support immi
gration reform, hoping to
retain a greater proportion of
international students, who
come to the United States to
refine their technical skills.

Venture capitalist Theresia
Ranzetta further emphasized
the importance of H-1B visas,
during a seminar in the
Election 2012 series.
Ranzetta cited that 15 per
cent of tech companies have a
foreign founder or co
founder. She stated that
while the United States is
able to attract technical tal
ent to its universities, the
current immigration policies
prevent such talent from
remaining in the country. She
added that many of the bene
ficiaries of H-1B visas go on
to start companies that, in
the long run, are large net
job creators.

University President
John Hennessy stated in the
Election 2012 panel that his
main concern was companies
deciding to establish interna
tional divisions to make up
for insufficient technical tal
ent in the United States.

Business impact
On Oct. 13, both candi
dates released statements
detailing their plan to grow
the technology startup indus
try. Obama cited that in his
first term he created the
chief technology officer posi
tion, overhauled patent
reform and legalized crowd
funding. Romney stated he
would reform immigration
policy for high-skilled work
ers and create the "Reagan
Economic Zone" or an organ
ization "committed to the
principles of free enterprise."
Predictably, the winner of
today's election will influence
Silicon Valley's future busi
ness practices.
"There is ... the question
of whether companies like
Apple that do so much of
their manufacturing over
seas in China will run into
problems with a second-term
Obama administration com
mitted to not favoring com
panies that ship jobs over
seas," he said.
During his 2008 cam
paign, Obama stated he
would eliminate tax breaks
for companies that out
sourced labor. The president
revisited this campaign
promise in his State of the
Union address this past

January.
"Companies get tax
breaks for moving jobs and
profits overseas. ...
Meanwhile, companies that
choose to stay in America get
hit with one of the highest tax
rates in the w0r1d.... It
makes no sense ... so let's
change it," he said.
In particular, policy
toward China will have an
impact on Silicon Valley man
ufacturing techniques. While

both candidates have empha
sized a tough policy toward
China, Romney reiterated in
the Oct. 22 presidential
debate that he would label
China a currency manipula
tor on the first day of his
presidency.

"One area where Silicon
Valley is probably very con
cerned is Romney's position
with regard to trade and
China," Greely said "China is
practically an adjunct to
Silicon Valley.... Major impli
cations would follow that
would have negative conse
quences for Silicon Valley
and for the whole country.
It's hard to believe he'll actu
ally do it."
Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math
(STEM) funding is also a
major concern.
"The Obama administra
tion has been much more
willing than a Romney
administration [would be] to
invest in science and technol
ogy, to get the government
involved in research and
clean energy," Lemley said.
"One area where Romney
has spoken out is to criticize
the federal government's
investment in Tesla. We can
infer something from that for
support for government
funding."
While Romney indicated
in his statement that the gov
ernment should avoid picking
"winners and losers," he did
state he would "focus govern
ment resources on research
programs that advance the
development of knowledge,
and on technologies with
widespread application and
potential to serve as the
foundation for private sector
innovation and commercial
ization."
Tech policy
In spite of the need for
technology policy reform, the
panelists at Tuesday's elec
tions class agreed that the
majority of lawmakers fail to
understand the technical
complexities behind the poli
cies they wish to implement.
Ranzetta also cited that tech
nology's rapid progress could
make policies obsolete.
Regulation of technology will
continue to be a topic of dis
cussion, regardless of who is
elected.
Congresswoman Eshoo
said Obama's appointment of
Todd Park as chief technolo
gy officer reflected his com
mitment to technology inno
vation.
On Oct. 20, tech industry
leaders released a two
minute video, endorsing
Obama. Linkedln founder
Reid Hoffman and Entelo
founder Jon Bischke were
among the leaders featured
in the video.
"I support Obama
because I personally realized
how much he cares about
innovation and future to
which we all aspire to build,"
Hoffman said.
In addition, Obama has
gained endorsements from
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer
and former Google CEO Eric
Schmidt. Former Hewlett-
Packard CEO Meg Whitman,
on the other hand, has
endorsed Romney.
"If the industry wants to
avoid regulation, it is proba
bly better off with a
Republican president,"
Greely said. "To the extent
they want regulation, like
privacy regulation, they
might be better off with a
Democratic president."

Silicon Valley and Washington
D.C. are 3,000 miles apart, but pol
icy and economics tie them closely
together. Though technology policy
and regulation rarely make it into
candidates' stump speeches, the
policies of the next president will
impact the hiring of foreign work
ers, government investment in
technology and privacy laws all
of which have profound impacts on
companies based in Silicon Valley.

Political trends in the Valley
Silicon Valley, like most of
Northern California, traditionally
votes democratic. According to
Mark Lemley, director of Stanford
Law School's program in Law,
Science and Technology, the
Democratic Party favors big gov
ernment and is more likely to invest
in innovation.
While President Obama received
significant support from Silicon
Valley donors in 2008, there has been
a noticeable drop in enthusiasm for
this coming election. Although Lemley
acknowledged Silicon Valley's demo
cratic inclinations, he noted a ten
sion between support for Obama's
stance on technology innovation
and opposition to government reg-
ulation in the technology
industry.
"My guess is that if you
had to describe a dominant
political philosophy [for
Silicon Valley], it would be
libertarian," Lemley said.
"Neither the Democrats nor
the Republicans are particu
larly libertarian these days.
Republicans want to lower
taxes, but want to regulate
personal life. Democrats tra
ditionally want more govern
ment ... regulation but more
personal liberties."
Bruce Cain, political sci
ence professor, echoed
Lemley in a statement.
"The Silicon Valley is a lit
tle more divided this election
as compared to last," Cain
wrote. "Romney offers lower
tax rates and a light regula
tory touch, but is less invest
ed in green tech."
According to a recent
article published by The New
York Times, some Silicon
Valley CEOs who had sup
ported Obama in 2008
switched allegiances this
year, donating money to the
Romney campaign. The same
article stated that many of
these CEOs find Governor
Romney's business back
ground appealing. In addi
tion, as attention moves to
Internet policy and privacy
issues, many technology
companies find Romney's
stated aversion to regulation
appealing.
Still, Obama has raised
significantly more funding
from the tech industry than
Romney. According to the
Center for Responsive
Politics, the computers/inter
net industry donated a total
of $7,092,464 to the Obama
campaign and $2,966,214 to
the Romney campaign.
Immigration
Immigration policy is
another issue of concern for
Silicon Valley voters. While
the candidates' discussion of
immigration policy most
often refers to illegal immi
gration policy, members of
the tech industry remain con
cerned about the candidates'
decisions with regard to H
-1B visas.
The H-1B visa program
allows U.S. companies to
employ foreign workers with
a particular specialty. At
present, the H-1B program
limits visas to 65,000 foreign
nationals. One of the criti
cisms of the H-1B visa pro
gram is that it causes job out
sourcing. There does not
appear to be a significant dif
ference on H-1B positions
between the candidates.
Obama outlined in the White
House immigration blueprint
a plan to strengthen the H
-1B program, while Romney
favors removal of the visa
cap.
Yet, Cain believes
Romney's stance on immi
gration could challenge his
ability to attract voters from
the Silicon Valley.
"The [Silicon Valley] has
long wanted an easing of H
-1B visa limits as part of a
comprehensive immigration
policy, but Romney is more
