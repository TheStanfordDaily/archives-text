## PAUSD to build new elem. school Enrollment growth prompts talks of new Palo Alto school 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Recent statistics on student enroll
ment and housing growth plans in
Palo Alto have encouraged the Palo
Alto Unified School District (PAUSD)
to open a thirteenth elementary
school, according to district Chief
Technology Officer Ann Dunkin.
"Basically the district has been
growing at a rate between one and
three percent a year, and it's been a
straight line for a number of years,
which suggests long term growth,"
Dunkin said.
A soon-to-be-appointed commit
tee will be considering two locations
for the school re-opening either
the Garland campus at 870 N.
California Ave. or the Greendell cam
pus at 4120 Middlefield Rd. The
Greendell campus would be used
jointly with district property at 525
San Antonio Rd.
"We're going to be looking at the
advantages and disadvantages of each
school," PAUSD Superintendent
Kevin Skelly said. "We're going to
use those things to help us make a
determination, as well as community
input."
The eventual decision will be
based on different factors, including
a consideration of commute (mini
mizing the number of busy streets
students would have to cross, for
example) and a desire to group
neighborhood classmates together
for middle and high school in the
future. Dunkin also added that the
committee will have to decide
between opening another school that
zones children into its population
regionally or opening a choice school
that is not zoned to a particular part
of the district.
