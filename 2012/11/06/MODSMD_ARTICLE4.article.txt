## PAUSD to build new elem. school Enrollment growth prompts talks of new Palo Alto school 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
Recent statistics on student enroll
ment and housing growth plans in
Palo Alto have encouraged the Palo
Alto Unified School District (PAUSD)
to open a thirteenth elementary
school, according to district Chief
Technology Officer Ann Dunkin.
"Basically the district has been
growing at a rate between one and
three percent a year, and it's been a
straight line for a number of years,
which suggests long term growth,"
Dunkin said.
A soon-to-be-appointed commit
tee will be considering two locations
for the school re-opening either
the Garland campus at 870 N.
California Ave. or the Greendell cam
pus at 4120 Middlefield Rd. The
Greendell campus would be used
jointly with district property at 525
San Antonio Rd.
"We're going to be looking at the
advantages and disadvantages of each
school," PAUSD Superintendent
Kevin Skelly said. "We're going to
use those things to help us make a
determination, as well as community
input."
The eventual decision will be
based on different factors, including
a consideration of commute (mini
mizing the number of busy streets
students would have to cross, for
example) and a desire to group
neighborhood classmates together
for middle and high school in the
future. Dunkin also added that the
committee will have to decide
between opening another school that
zones children into its population
regionally or opening a choice school
that is not zoned to a particular part
of the district.
The committee is expect
ed to make a final decision of
the location and timing of
the new elementary school
in the spring of 2013.
According to Skelly, the
district had deliberated on
opening a school six years
ago but was unable to
because of economic con
straints. Rather than adding
a new school, class sizes were
increased in existing
schools.
"For almost five years we
were postponing [opening a
new elementary school,] but
given the growth we're
expecting, we can't postpone
it anymore," Skelly said.
Allowing time for deci
sion-making and construc
tion, the soonest a new
campus could be available
is 2017-18 school year,
according to Dunkin.
While many aspects of
the new school have yet to
be decided, enrollment is
planned to be just over 500
students, with four classes
per grade level. With 24

classes in total, Dunkin
said that this should meet
Palo Alto's growth rate for
several years to come.
The addition of another
zoned neighborhood school
would alter the existing
school zone boundaries. The
board would have to decide
on a redistricting scheme
that would be the least dis
ruptive for families, Dunkin
said.
Dunkin also reported
declining growth in the
north end of Palo Alto with
the exception of Addison
Elementary, which is grow
ing in enrollment and will
need support.
The district is also look
ing to add a fourth middle
school to alleviate the enroll
ment growth that will move
from the elementary schools
to the middle schools as stu
dents age.
"We'll definitely need a
fourth middle school for the
2020-21 school year,"
Dunkin said. "We'll be fair
ly tight at that point to be
honest, and we need to
meet the educational needs
in middle school."
