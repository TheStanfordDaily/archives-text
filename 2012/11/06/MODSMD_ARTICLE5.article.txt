# STUDENT GROUPS
## Stanford Splash helps students become teachers 
### HELIN GAO 
This past weekend, over 2,000 people came
to campus for Stanford Splash, a biannual
event in which middle and high school stu
dents participate in 255 classes taught by
Stanford students and Palo Alto community
members. This weekend's event, featuring
classes ranging from "Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence" to "Scottish Highland Dance,"
was the second largest in Splash history.
Organizers advertised in schools, drawing
most of their attendees from California,
though some flew in from as far away as
Maryland, Georgia and even London. 1,505
students, 250 volunteer teachers and around
200 volunteers showed up for the two-day
program.

New this year were walk-in seminars,
taught mostly by Stanford students.

According to Tim Huang 'l4, co-president of
Stanford Splash, about 10 to 20 classes are
cancelled by Splash teachers at the last
minute every year. That means that many
students are left without classes to attend
after traveling all the way to Stanford.
"Stanford students have very busy sched
ules and they often inform us [of cancella
tions] at the last minute," Huang said. "[Walk
in seminars] are meant to combat that. We
want to provide students with a place to go."
Splash participants are charged $4O for
the event, though need-based financial aid
and free transportation were offered to more
than 300 students.

"That [charge] helps to cover the opera
tion for Splash, making sure that we have the
reserved room, food and transportation,"
Huang said. "A portion of it goes back to stu
dents from under-resourced, low-income

background."
According to Huang, most seminars were
well-attended, with walk-in seminars fulfilling
their intended purpose. One favorite was a
seminar on acting and stage management,
put on by The Stanford Shakespeare
Company.

As Splash grows, Stanford has started
hosting student leaders from other universi
ties. Splash student leaders from Duke
University, Rice University, San Jose State
University and the University of Chicago
have all come to campus to study the Stanford
Splash model, according to Huang.
"It's really inspiring to see so many people
working together to put it on," said Rebekah
Johnston, president of Duke's Splash pro
gram, "Duke has a much smaller

weekend as a part of Stanford Splash, which gave middle and high schoolers the chance to take classes taught by Stanford students.
Splash....Our goal is to be
like Stanford Splash."
Huang emphasized the
importance of undergradu
ate and graduate student
collaboration in organizing
Splash program.
"What makes us unique
above all is that we have a
very unique undergraduate
to graduate ratio," Huang
said. "I think what the

undergraduates bring are a
lot of passion, a lot of energy,
while the graduate [stu
dents] bring a lot of stability
in terms of managing logis
tics."

Along with the classes
offered to students, Learning
Unlimited, a non-profit edu
cational institution that spon
sors 15 Splash programs
nationwide, offered a pro
gram for parents.
Daniel Zaharopol,
Learning Unlimited's chief
executive officer, said the
parent program gives par
ents a platform to discuss

educational opportunities for
their children, but also offers
students greater independ
ence more space away
from their parents while
at Stanford.

"This is my third year
attending the parent pro
gram," said Anju Marang,
whose two children both
attended Splash this year. "I
learned a lot [about] how to
deal with teenagers and
how to find passion in
them."
