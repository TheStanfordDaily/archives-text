## Humanities & Sciences exploring online courses 
### SAJJAN SRI-KUMAR 
"It's no secret that the reputation of
Stanford engineering and sciences puts the
humanities and arts in the shade," said Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities &
Sciences.

Despite Stanford's ranking as the top
humanities and arts university in the world,
according to the 2012-13 Times Higher
Education World University Arts and
Humanities report, the visibility of the humani
ties at Stanford is a distant second to science,
technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) fields.

The Office of the Vice Provost for Online
Learning (VPOL) and faculty from the School
of Humanities & Sciences are looking to offer
online courses in the humanities this academic
year to remedy this problem.

Although Stanford is offering 16 massive
online open courses (MOOCs) this fall quarter,
almost all are STEM-related. Election 2012, a
class cross-listed under the departments of
History, Political Science and Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, is the only
Stanford class categorized under humanities on
Coursera.

Debra Satz, senior associate dean for the
humanities and arts, began thinking of creating
online courses in the humanities after reading
the list of online courses on offer for fall quarter
this year and noticing the lack of humanities
courses. Faculty from departments in the
humanities initially met with Mitchell on Oct. 30
to begin discussions on the online presence of
the humanities.

"We would like to see Stanford humanities
and arts have a higher public profile than they
do right now," Sailer said. He called Stanford's
excellence in the arts and humanities a "well
kept secret."

"We're hoping that some massive online
courses might draw attention to the quality of
faculty that we have here," he said.

The discussion of online courses in the
humanities follows President Hennessy's direc
tive to explore online education's role in the
University. The establishment of the new office
of the VPOL and debates in the faculty senate
create a "mood across campus" that surrounds
this discussion, according to Vice Provost for
Online Learning John Mitchell.
Humanities faculty members pointed to a
number of possible reasons their departments
may lag behind STEM departments in online
education.

Sailer speculated that a lack of awareness of
technological opportunity among the humani
ties faculty discouraged online courses.
"I think that the humanities faculty in gener

al are much less aware than in computer sci
ence, where a lot of this is originating," he said.
Mitchell pointed to the need for greater tech
nological training among humanities faculty to
develop expertise with online learning tools.
However, unfamiliarity is not the only barri
er. The often discussion-based format of human
ities classes translates to online courses with
more difficulty than lecture-based learning.
Classics professor lan Morris, who attended
the Oct. 30 meeting, said many successful online
courses have had to face the problem of moder
ating an enormous number of comments on a
discussion board.
"You have this problem of how on earth do
you deal with 10,000 comments, all coming in at
the same time?" Morris said.
Morris said that while there was no defini
tive way to deal with the problem, efforts had
been made to create algorithms to showcase
certain comments or to shrink the discussion
into smaller groups in order to replicate the
effect of a seminar classroom.
However, he said the problem in principle
was not different from trying to grade discus
sion in a classroom setting, as both are inherent
ly subjective.
Both Sailer and Moms said that the difficul
ty in grading discussion participation might
cause discussion-based classes to forgo tradi
tional grading.
Another concern particular to the humani
ties is the variety in the potential audience.
English professor Eavan Boland speculated
there might be a bigger audience for classes in
the humanities than for STEM courses, since
science courses often require technical knowl
edge that establishes common proficiency.
"The sciences require a familiarity with
the language and the language of the sciences
requires usually quite high levels of expert
ise," she said. "When you get to the humanities,
it's much less clear who is going to be the audi
ence."

Boland said that it was possible that the
audience could range from high school dropouts
who loved reading but never got to explore that
passion, or teachers who wanted to improve
their own classes. Standardizing online courses
for this audience may prove difficult.
Although no precise timeline has been creat
ed, Mitchell has encouraged faculty to consider
classes they would like to offer online.
"I asked the faculty to think about what they
feel most passionate about," he said. "I think
people will do best if they try to focus on their
strongest interests and produce things that they
find compelling."

who loved reading but never got to explore that
passion, or teachers who wanted to improve
their own classes. Standardizing online courses
for this audience may prove difficult.
Although no precise timeline has been creat
ed, Mitchell has encouraged faculty to consider
classes they would like to offer online.
"I asked the faculty to think about what they
feel most passionate about," he said. "I think
people will do best if they try to focus on their
strongest interests and produce things that they
find compelling."

"It's no secret that the reputation of
Stanford engineering and sciences puts the
humanities and arts in the shade," said Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities &
Sciences.

Despite Stanford's ranking as the top
humanities and arts university in the world,
according to the 2012-13 Times Higher
Education World University Arts and
Humanities report, the visibility of the humani
ties at Stanford is a distant second to science,
technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) fields.

The Office of the Vice Provost for Online
Learning (VPOL) and faculty from the School
of Humanities & Sciences are looking to offer
online courses in the humanities this academic
year to remedy this problem.

Although Stanford is offering 16 massive
online open courses (MOOCs) this fall quarter,
almost all are STEM-related. Election 2012, a
class cross-listed under the departments of
History, Political Science and Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity, is the only
Stanford class categorized under humanities on
Coursera.

Debra Satz, senior associate dean for the
humanities and arts, began thinking of creating
online courses in the humanities after reading
the list of online courses on offer for fall quarter
this year and noticing the lack of humanities
courses. Faculty from departments in the
humanities initially met with Mitchell on Oct. 30
to begin discussions on the online presence of
the humanities.

"We would like to see Stanford humanities
and arts have a higher public profile than they
do right now," Sailer said. He called Stanford's
excellence in the arts and humanities a "well
kept secret."

"We're hoping that some massive online
courses might draw attention to the quality of
faculty that we have here," he said.

The discussion of online courses in the
humanities follows President Hennessy's direc
tive to explore online education's role in the
University. The establishment of the new office
of the VPOL and debates in the faculty senate
create a "mood across campus" that surrounds
this discussion, according to Vice Provost for
Online Learning John Mitchell.
Humanities faculty members pointed to a
number of possible reasons their departments
may lag behind STEM departments in online
education.

Sailer speculated that a lack of awareness of
technological opportunity among the humani
ties faculty discouraged online courses.
"I think that the humanities faculty in gener

al are much less aware than in computer sci
ence, where a lot of this is originating," he said.
Mitchell pointed to the need for greater tech
nological training among humanities faculty to
develop expertise with online learning tools.
However, unfamiliarity is not the only barri
er. The often discussion-based format of human
ities classes translates to online courses with
more difficulty than lecture-based learning.
Classics professor lan Morris, who attended
the Oct. 30 meeting, said many successful online
courses have had to face the problem of moder
ating an enormous number of comments on a
discussion board.
"You have this problem of how on earth do
you deal with 10,000 comments, all coming in at
the same time?" Morris said.
Morris said that while there was no defini
tive way to deal with the problem, efforts had
been made to create algorithms to showcase
certain comments or to shrink the discussion
into smaller groups in order to replicate the
effect of a seminar classroom.
However, he said the problem in principle
was not different from trying to grade discus
sion in a classroom setting, as both are inherent
ly subjective.
Both Sailer and Moms said that the difficul
ty in grading discussion participation might
cause discussion-based classes to forgo tradi
tional grading.
Another concern particular to the humani
ties is the variety in the potential audience.
English professor Eavan Boland speculated
there might be a bigger audience for classes in
the humanities than for STEM courses, since
science courses often require technical knowl
edge that establishes common proficiency.
"The sciences require a familiarity with
the language and the language of the sciences
requires usually quite high levels of expert
ise," she said. "When you get to the humanities,
it's much less clear who is going to be the audi
ence."

Boland said that it was possible that the
audience could range from high school dropouts
who loved reading but never got to explore that
passion, or teachers who wanted to improve
their own classes. Standardizing online courses
for this audience may prove difficult.
Although no precise timeline has been creat
ed, Mitchell has encouraged faculty to consider
classes they would like to offer online.

feel most passionate about," he said. "I think
people will do best if they try to focus on their
strongest interests and produce things that they
find compelling."
