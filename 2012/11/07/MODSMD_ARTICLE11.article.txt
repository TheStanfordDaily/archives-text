## Calif. repeals three-strike law, upholds death penalty 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Proposition 36, which reforms California's
three-strikes law, is headed for passage while
voters have rejected Proposition 34, which would
have eliminated the death penalty, and
Proposition 37, which would have mandated the
labeling of genetically-modified food. Governor
Jerry Brown's signature ballot initiative,
Proposition 30, will likely pass.
Prop 30 headlined the eleven referenda on
the ballot; its passage would temporarily
increase income tax on individuals making over
$250,000 and sales tax for all consumers. Brown,
the main proponent of the proposition, maintains
that the increased tax revenue is necessary to
head off billions of dollars in education cuts.
"If 30 fails, K-12 education will be cut by $5
billion," said David Plank, executive director of
Policy Analysis for California Education and a
professor at the School of Education. "Not fatal,
but a very severe blow to public education in
California. The system will go on, but it's very
difficult."
Another proposition that would have tun
neled tax revenue to education was Proposition
38, which will likely fail by a large margin. It
would have temporarily increased the state
income tax for most Californians, taking the rev
enue and earmarking it for pre-K to grade 12
education. Because of possible cuts to Palo Alto
public schools, the Palo Alto Unified School
District has endorsed both propositions 30 and
38.
"[Prop] 38 was doomed from the start," Plank
said "[lt was] much too complicated for the vot
ers ... two revenue propositions on the same bal
lot made it almost impossible to pass either one."
The passage of proposition 36 revises the
three-strikes law so that life-in-prison sentences
would only apply if the third conviction were
deemed "serious or violent." California's three
strikes law was approved in 1994.
"[Prop 36's passage] tells California citizens
that it is possible to change California law but
still keep California safe," said David Mills, a
professor at Stanford Law School who helped
author the proposition and donated almost $1

million to secure its passage. "Hopefully, it will
result in more humane sentencing."
For Prop 36 proponent and law professor
Lawrence Marshall, the proposition's passage
marks a turning point in California referenda.
"It's been presumed that the only kind of
measure that can get passed drives the book
harder at criminals without any sense of propor
tionality," he said. "This reform shows that
California voters are prepared to recognize that
we need to be sane and rational in our
approach."
Proposition 34, which eliminates the death
penalty and replaces it with life in prison without
parole, was trailing by several percentage points
at the time of publication. The law would have
applied retroactively to the 725 Californians on
death row.
Proposition 37 is a complicated piece of legis
lation that intends to label all genetically-modi
fied food products. However, worries about spe
cial interest loopholes and exceptions may have
played a part in its rejection by voters.
"Proposition 37 is not a strong piece of legis
lation," said Roz Naylor, director of the Center
on Food Security and the Environment. "Most of
the GM-based food that Californians eat is not
covered by the labeling act, and, as a result, the
labeling will be misleading to consumers."
California voters also failed Props 31, 32 and
33, rejecting a budgetary constitutional amend
ment, restrictions on certain political donations
and changes to car insurance regulations.
Two propositions that are coasting to easy
passage are Prop 35, the "Californians Against
Sexual Exploitation" initiative, and Prop 40, a
proposition that would keep the current
California State Senate boundaries as drawn by
a citizens' commission for the 2010 redistricting
cycle. Opponents of the map announced they
would stop campaigning against the map in July
though the referendum remained on the ballot.
The passage of Prop 35 increases prison
terms for human traffickers and mandates police
training on human trafficking, though the initia
tive does not make clear how its provisions will
be funded.

Proposition 34, which eliminates the death
penalty and replaces it with life in prison without
parole, was trailing by several percentage points
at the time of publication. The law would have
applied retroactively to the 725 Californians on
death row.
Proposition 37 is a complicated piece of legis
lation that intends to label all genetically-modi
fied food products. However, worries about spe
cial interest loopholes and exceptions may have
played a part in its rejection by voters.
"Proposition 37 is not a strong piece of legis
lation," said Roz Naylor, director of the Center
on Food Security and the Environment. "Most of
the GM-based food that Californians eat is not
covered by the labeling act, and, as a result, the
labeling will be misleading to consumers."
California voters also failed Props 31, 32 and
33, rejecting a budgetary constitutional amend
ment, restrictions on certain political donations
and changes to car insurance regulations.
Two propositions that are coasting to easy
passage are Prop 35, the "Californians Against
Sexual Exploitation" initiative, and Prop 40, a
proposition that would keep the current
California State Senate boundaries as drawn by
a citizens' commission for the 2010 redistricting
cycle. Opponents of the map announced they
would stop campaigning against the map in July
though the referendum remained on the ballot.
The passage of Prop 35 increases prison
terms for human traffickers and mandates police
training on human trafficking, though the initia
tive does not make clear how its provisions will
be funded.
