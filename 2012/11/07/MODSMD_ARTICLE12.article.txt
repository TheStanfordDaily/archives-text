## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD The
						bully in my brain 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
There is a very loud, very
obnoxious Stanford student in
my brain who almost always
outcompetes the other voices in
there. Whenever I ask a question,
she waves her hand and yelps so
that I have to call on her. When I'm
feeling vulnerable or uncertain, she
bullies me and calls me a wimp. She
shirks leisure time and scoffs at self
acceptance.
I think a part of Stanford does
too. Self-acceptance is couched in
terms of "a fine grade," "a good
effort" or "you did your best." What
in reality is a daunting and noble
endeavor is made to sound like set
tling for less.
Self-betterment is the name of
the game here. I see this crazed
behavior most clearly in the fitness
culture on campus. At least once a
week, I engage in conversations
with students, men and women
alike, about shedding five more
pounds of fat or squeezing in 10
more minutes of cardio. I also hear a
lot of resolutions to stop eating
meat, dairy, gluten and sugar for the
rest of the year. I hope you like veg
etables. Underlying this attitude is
the assumption that you can change
the way you look in an act of self
improvement. This assumption frus
trates me. Yes, you can manipulate
your body, sometimes to drastic
extremes, but to what end? A cos
metic one? An addictive one?
The perfectionist impulse, when
applied to vague terms like a
"healthy lifestyle," can take you into
dangerous territory. I think it is
very unhealthy to never eat dessert
and never take a week off of exercis
ing. That kind of compulsive behav
ior breeds fear and not much else. I
am very lucky to be thin in a culture
that values being thin, and I don't
want to sound like a Pollyanna. Still,
I think that most of the students
here who adhere to six-day-a-week
workout schedules and carb-free
diets could benefit from taking a
break from that insanity. A break is
worthwhile, if for no other reason
than to show yourself that you won't
gain three pounds if you eat a candy
bar, or several candy bars. As I'm
writing this, the pushy Stanford stu
dent in my head is yelling her head
off calling me lazy, gluttonous and

undisciplined. I'm telling her to shut
the hell up.

Besides taking up an inordinate
amount of prime real estate brain
space, indulging the fantasy that
you can always change the way you
look can be irresponsible. You can
live your life thinking about what
you eat and how much you sweat 90
percent of the time, or you can do
something intrepid and radical: You
can accept the way you look.
Everyone has parts of their body
they wish they could change. It
takes a great deal of maturity, poise
and moxie to resist the temptation
to keep fussing over changing your
body and to deal with it. Maybe you
can even celebrate your body for the
gift that it is, a la Walt Whitman.

Let me be clear I have
immense sympathy for the great
number of students on campus who
suffer from eating disorders. My
heart goes out to you. I don't want
my readers to get the impression
that I am ridiculing anyone, or that
I am insensitive to the demons
some people have to face. I don't
write this article without an under
standing of how lonely and fright
ening an eating disorder can be. I
am wary of offering any advice on a
topic that is so fragile and emotion
ally charged. I would, though, offer
the gentle suggestion to be kind to
yourself. What I am saying about
the quest for physical perfection can
be said of any obsessive behavior at
Stanford: perfectionism about
grades, sports, problem sets, reputa
tion. I chose the example of the fit
ness craze because it is concrete and
easy to illustrate, and I can only hope
I did not hurt anyone in doing so.
That persuasive, critical
Stanford student in your brain will
tell you that you are being self
indulgent if you start to ease off
the self-criticism. I would argue
that succumbing to self-criticism
out of fear is the indulgent behav
ior. Grow up. Stop living in a fairy
land where you can someday reach
perfection. Step into the real world
and accept who you are. You might
just like it.
