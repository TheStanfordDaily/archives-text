# SITTIN' ON THE JOHN
## The 						Day After 
### John Murray 
Thank God it's over. At this
point, I could give a damn if
Donald Trump somehow man
aged to pay the 50 percent of
Americans who don't vote to write
him in and send him and his birth
certificate to the Oval Office.
Campaigns have never been my
cup of tea, but this one left me with a
particularly nasty taste in my mouth.
I don't want to come across as
that naive, jaded teen (though I cer
tainly am, in a sense), acting as
though presidential campaigns used
to be a fine gentlemen's sport that,
like face-to-face communication and
classic roll and roll, have slowly dete
riorated and been destroyed by the
forces of modern culture. Heck, back
in 1884, James Blaine ran against
Grover Cleveland with the slogan
"Ma, Ma, Where's my Pa, Gone to
the White House, Ha, Ha, Ha" in ref
erence to the out-of-wedlock child
that Cleveland had allegedly
fathered. (Cleveland got into the fun
as well, running on "Blaine, Blaine,
James G. Blaine, The Continental
Liar from the State of Maine." Good
luck getting either of those on a
bumper sticker.)
But in the light of ever intrusive
and constant media, and in a post-
Gtizens United world, it really does
feel like we may have hit a new low,
reaching an embarrassing level of
triviality and competitiveness.
This was a race that began with a
Republican primary in which it often
seemed that the majority of the
national conversation was focusing
on which part of Kenya Obama was
born in. Trump, a man known most
ly for his TV show and his hair,
became a political player. Michele
Bachmann and Herman Cain were
considered contenders at one point.
Then Romney was nominated,
and Republicans nationwide began
their Jeb Bush 2016 campaign. (As
disturbing as various parts of
Romney's campaign were, I can't
help but be impressed by his ability
to go from best-of-the-worst to the
only-thing-standing-between-us-
and-Armageddon among his
Republican base.)

Ayn Rand became relevant with
the Paul Ryan VP pick. P9ox and
marathon times entered the discus
sion, as "Paul Ryan shirtless" was
googled 9x as often as "Paul Ryan
budget."
The endless gaffe war continued,
fueled by everyone's new favorite
number —47 and the "unchain
ing" of Wall Street. Horses and bay
onets and binders full of women
unleashed cyber firestorms of end
less memes, replacing the age-old
bumper sticker as the cheap political
medium of the modern era.
Clint Eastwood debated health
care with a chair.
A single debate performance
(and a flood of over-dramatic media
spin) actually made people think the
debates mattered.
And then there were the count
less tweets and Facebook posts and
blogs and pundits that told us that
this was the biggest presidential
election in years, that this was a war
to decide the future of political cul
ture in America, and that you had to
vote this way or that.
I'm calling bull.
These were two technocrats, two
managers, who've talked out of the
left and right sides of their mouths in
order to jazz up their respective
bases, and, with a record-setting
advertising effort, were able to heat
up this campaign to an undeserving
high.
Obama was never going to radi
cally redistribute wealth. Romney
was never going to send women's
rights back to the Middle Ages. The
economy is recovering, and it
appears that 12 million jobs are
headed our way no matter who's up
on Capitol Hill. A presidential vote in
this election seemed less like a vote
for one ideology or another than a
vote for who is going to get to claim
to have presided over the economic
recovery and who will get to han
dle the ever-approaching super
budget-debt-deficit deal that, no
matter whether Romney or Obama
had been elected, would have includ
ed both huge budget cuts and, yes,
some tax hikes.

This was not as controversial a
decision as it was made out to be, or
nearly as colorful. It was an election
that was simply overdone, both with
its focus on the trivial and in its rad
icalization of what the candidates
would have actually done in the
White House, and to America.
We lost this election. We lost it
when we spent weeks discussing
binders full of women, or when we
spent nights listening to pundits tell
us how one candidate was certain to
send this country to hell.
I watched the electoral score
board light up for much of yesterday.
I wasn't waiting to see who hit 270
first; I was counting to 538: the total
number of electoral votes. Because
once we hit that, it was all over.
At least until the endless wave of
"analysis" comes to shore.

feel like we may have hit a new low,
reaching an embarrassing level of
triviality and competitiveness.
This was a race that began with a
Republican primary in which it often
seemed that the majority of the
national conversation was focusing
on which part of Kenya Obama was
born in. Trump, a man known most
ly for his TV show and his hair,
became a political player. Michele
Bachmann and Herman Cain were
considered contenders at one point.
Then Romney was nominated,
and Republicans nationwide began
their Jeb Bush 2016 campaign. (As
disturbing as various parts of
Romney's campaign were, I can't
help but be impressed by his ability
to go from best-of-the-worst to the
only-thing-standing-between-us-
and-Armageddon among his
Republican base.)

Ayn Rand became relevant with
the Paul Ryan VP pick. P9ox and
marathon times entered the discus
sion, as "Paul Ryan shirtless" was
googled 9x as often as "Paul Ryan
budget."
The endless gaffe war continued,
fueled by everyone's new favorite
number —47 and the "unchain
ing" of Wall Street. Horses and bay
onets and binders full of women
unleashed cyber firestorms of end
less memes, replacing the age-old
bumper sticker as the cheap political
medium of the modern era.
Clint Eastwood debated health
care with a chair.
A single debate performance
(and a flood of over-dramatic media
spin) actually made people think the
debates mattered.
And then there were the count
less tweets and Facebook posts and
blogs and pundits that told us that
this was the biggest presidential
election in years, that this was a war
to decide the future of political cul
ture in America, and that you had to
vote this way or that.
I'm calling bull.
These were two technocrats, two
managers, who've talked out of the
left and right sides of their mouths in
order to jazz up their respective
bases, and, with a record-setting
advertising effort, were able to heat
up this campaign to an undeserving
high.
Obama was never going to radi
cally redistribute wealth. Romney
was never going to send women's
rights back to the Middle Ages. The
economy is recovering, and it
appears that 12 million jobs are
headed our way no matter who's up
on Capitol Hill. A presidential vote in
this election seemed less like a vote
for one ideology or another than a
vote for who is going to get to claim
to have presided over the economic
recovery and who will get to han
dle the ever-approaching super
budget-debt-deficit deal that, no
matter whether Romney or Obama
had been elected, would have includ
ed both huge budget cuts and, yes,
some tax hikes.

This was not as controversial a
decision as it was made out to be, or
nearly as colorful. It was an election
that was simply overdone, both with
its focus on the trivial and in its rad
icalization of what the candidates
would have actually done in the
White House, and to America.
We lost this election. We lost it
when we spent weeks discussing
binders full of women, or when we
spent nights listening to pundits tell
us how one candidate was certain to
send this country to hell.
I watched the electoral score
board light up for much of yesterday.
I wasn't waiting to see who hit 270
first; I was counting to 538: the total
number of electoral votes. Because
once we hit that, it was all over.
At least until the endless wave of
"analysis" comes to shore.

Thank God it's over. At this
point, I could give a damn if
Donald Trump somehow man
aged to pay the 50 percent of
Americans who don't vote to write
him in and send him and his birth
certificate to the Oval Office.
Campaigns have never been my
cup of tea, but this one left me with a
particularly nasty taste in my mouth.
I don't want to come across as
that naive, jaded teen (though I cer
tainly am, in a sense), acting as
though presidential campaigns used
to be a fine gentlemen's sport that,
like face-to-face communication and
classic roll and roll, have slowly dete
riorated and been destroyed by the
forces of modern culture. Heck, back
in 1884, James Blaine ran against
Grover Cleveland with the slogan
"Ma, Ma, Where's my Pa, Gone to
the White House, Ha, Ha, Ha" in ref
erence to the out-of-wedlock child
that Cleveland had allegedly
fathered. (Cleveland got into the fun
as well, running on "Blaine, Blaine,
James G. Blaine, The Continental
Liar from the State of Maine." Good
luck getting either of those on a
bumper sticker.)
But in the light of ever intrusive
and constant media, and in a post-
Gtizens United world, it really does
feel like we may have hit a new low,
reaching an embarrassing level of
triviality and competitiveness.
