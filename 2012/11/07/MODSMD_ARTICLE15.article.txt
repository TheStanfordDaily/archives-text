# I WANT TO GO TO THERE
## The 						other elections: Progress and lack thereof 
### Annie Graham 
After the large news networks
called it for Obama last night,
it may have been easy to for
get countless other national elec
tions. But even today, some political
races continue. When analysis of
Obama's victory (or Romney's loss)
gets old, there are other stories to
focus on that show interesting
shifts in the nation.

First of all, Missouri Senator
Claire McCaskill defeated Todd
Akin in her race for re-election.
Perhaps you remember Todd Akin
from earlier in election season as
the man who declared that the
female body has ways to shut down
a "legitimate rape." Though many
prominent Republicans pressured
him to drop out after such an offen
sive and ignorant comment one
that revealed his deep-seated
beliefs; he did not. In his concession
speech tonight he claimed,
"Washington doesn't need more
money, it needs more courage."
Thank goodness it is not the type of
courage that aims to define what is
and what is not "legitimate rape."
Good job, Claire McCaskill.
Elizabeth Warren won a Democratic
Senate seat in Massachusetts, defeat
ing the Republican Scott Brown who
attracted so much attention in 2010.
Winning this seat helped the
Democrats to maintain control of the
U.S. Senate. She even got to borrow
an early gaffe from Obama and use it
in regards to her victory, "Let me be
clear. I didn't build that; you built
that."
Tammy Baldwin won a historic
race last night, becoming the first
openly gay Senator in U.S. history.
Not only that, but she is also the
first female senator to represent
the state of Wisconsin.
Marriage equality was on the
ballot in four states last night. In
Maine, voters decided to legalize
marriage for same-gender couples.
In Maryland, voters decided to
maintain a state law passed earlier
this year that recognizes marriage
for same-gender couples. As of
press time, it looks like Washington

will maintain a similar law passed
by their state. In Minnesota, a
"Yes" vote would have created a
constitutional ban on same-gender
marriage, but it was voted down.
Marriage equality might come
away with four victories.
In other news, Washington and
Colorado passed marijuana legal
ization last night. With this along
side marriage equality in
Washington, I'm waiting for the
exact date of the apocalypse from
the religious right.
Because I'm from Arizona, I'm
acutely aware of the results coming
from there. There was an interest
ing race in the 9th Congressional
District between African-American
Republican Vernon Parker and
openly bisexual Democrat Kyrsten
Sinema. The race remained close
late into the night, but ultimately
Sinema prevailed. These candi
dates are so interesting, especially
running against each other,
because Arizona is a notably con
servative state (one of those that
Romney won last night).
And finally, in news that is bad
for the nation as a whole, Sheriff
Joe Arpaio won his sixth term in
office last night. He has been in
office since 1993, and has been
accused of a slew of human rights
violations, largely due to his bla
tantly racist immigration enforce
ment policies. I hope that reason
able voices on immigration policy in
my state win out regardless of this
re-election. They do exist, and they
will speak louder.
Meanwhile, Obama. That guy won.
