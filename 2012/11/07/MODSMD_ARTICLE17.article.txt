## ASSU Senator dodges expulsion 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate (US) unanimous
ly approved student group funding for 13 Voluntary
Student Organizations (VSO) at their Thesday meeting.
Administrations & Rules Committee Chair Lauren
Miller 'l5 dismissed the only action item, a bill which
she co-authored to expel senator Janhavi Vartak 'l5
from the senate.

The bill was written to adhere to the Senate Bylaws,
which state that, "In the event that any member of the
US misses three meetings in a quarter, a bill for expul
sion must be presented to the US at the meeting(s) fol
lowing the third absence." Vartak has missed three
meetings this quarter.

However, Miller and Senate Chair Branden Crouch
'l4 dismissed the proposal for expulsion, conditional on
Vartak's attendance at every meeting for the remainder
of the quarter.

"I owe you an apology," Vartak said after the bill was
dismissed, "This quarter was a mess, and I do owe the
senate my time. I really will commit to [the] senate.
The Senate's bylaws also state that, "a salary shall
not be paid out if an officer does not attend at least 90
percent of required meetings (as defined by these
bylaws)." Since there are only nine meetings in a quar
ter, one unexcused absence can disqualify a senator
under this definition.

However, Miller said that since the senate had not
previously provided a clear definition for an excused

absence, she anticipates that all senators will receive
their $4OO stipend regardless of their absences before
the policy was clarified.
Viraj Bindra 'l5 delivered an update on the first
meeting of the Alternative Review Process (ARP)
Committee. Composed of six senators, the senate
formed the committee last week to create a more pro
ductive and focused discussion about the individual ele
ments of the ARP
"We are focusing most exclusively on outreach right
now, and how to get enough relevant and representative
feedback, and [how to] make sure we reach as much
demographics on campus as possible," ARP Committee
Chair Bindra said. He reported that the committee is
working on developing a timeline for the ARP's revi
sion.
Miller said that, after they reach conclusions, the
committee plans to draft a bill including their recom
mendations for the ARR
"Right now, we're looking at the... Title IX guide
lines and what we can actually change," Miller said.
Echoing updates from previous weeks, senators
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, Brandon Hightower 'l5 and Bindra
reported some progress on previously announced initia
tives, including collaboration with Stanford First-
Generation Low Income Partnership (FLIP), pursuing
need-blind admissions for international students and
providing practice spaces for independent musicians.
