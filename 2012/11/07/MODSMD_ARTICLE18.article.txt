## HOGAN IN AT QB 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Well, now it's official.
Stanford head coach David
Shaw confirmed today at his week
ly press conference and in the offi
cial depth chart that Kevin Hogan
will start at quarterback on
Saturday when Stanford takes on
Oregon State.
"As everybody knows, Kevin
Hogan will start at quarterback for
u5.... Over those [last few] games
Kevin Hogan has shown a lot of
promise in practice, which is why
Kevin began to play."
This is a fairly unique situation
for Stanford. As one of the writers
pointed out during the press con
ference, very rarely do you see a
team with as good a record as

Stanford has switch quarterbacks
for performance reasons. However,
these last few weeks, Shaw has
been very impressed with Hogan's
progression through practice, and
combined with some subpar play by
his predecessor Josh Nunes, that
has made Hogan the starter.
The big impetus for Kevin's
ascension to the starting role,
though, is his newfound command
of the offense. His shoulders
dropped" Shaw said, emphasiz
ing that Hogan really started to
make progress in understanding
pass protections, run blocking and
audibles in practice recently. Now,
in Shaw's estimation, Hogan has
command of about 80 percent of the
offense. The rest, Shaw thinks will
be offset by Hogan's extreme ath
leticism.

Though expected since
Saturday's win over Colorado, this
is big news for the Cardinal offense.
Hogan led four consecutive touch
down drives and six consecutive
scoring drives in relief of Josh
Nunes on Saturday, providing the
spark Stanford needed to pull away
from the Buffaloes. Now the ques
tion is whether that spark will
ignite Stanford's offense for a bru
tal three-game home stretch. It's
certainly a sign to hear players on
the defensive side, like senior line
backer Jarek Lancaster, speak
highly of Hogan.
"The boy can sling it, as we saw
last Saturday. I don't see that
changing.... At spring ball it was
really hard to tackle him. ...It's
exciting to see him play."
Hogan's offense should be run

ning at close to full health this
week. Sophomore wide receiver Ty
Montgomery came back from a leg
injury to play against Colorado.
Though he didn't start, Montgomery's
extensive playing time with
Stanford's big lead is definitely a
sign that the coaches aren't too
worried about him aggravating his
injury.
Shaw said that Montgomery is
improving health-wise, and was
better Monday than on game day.
However, Shaw announced that
senior Jamal-Rashad Patterson will
start at wide receiver. Additionally,
Montgomery will probably not see
time at kick returner for the fore
seeable future, as Stanford's priori
ty will be to get him back in the flow

of the regular offense.
The only key injury left on the
offensive side is Andrus Peat's fin
ger situation. Shaw announced last
week that Peat was unlikely to play
after picking up the injury at
Monday's practice. Peat did travel
to Colorado, but did not play in the
game. For this week, Andrus is
playing a lot better. He practiced
Monday night in a soft cast and was
able participate in contact drills.
"Andrus isn't a guy who shows a
lot of emotion," Shaw said, "but he
smiled Monday night and said he
couldn't wait for practice tomor
row. ... He's excited to get going. It
feels a lot better."
Hogan isn't the only freshman
whose role is continuing to grow
every week. One of the biggest sur
prises of the midseason has been
the ascent of true freshman Alex
Carter to the starting cornerback
role. Shaw has been as impressed
as anyone with the young corner's
skill set.
"Quick, fast, explosive, aggres
sive, tough, great ball skills, he's
grown every single week and he's
still growing," Shaw said. "He's
kind of what you want out there as
a corner.... He's just got more size
and weight than those other guys.
When he comes up and hits you, he
lets you feel it."
Carter forced a fumble against
the Buffaloes on one of the hardest
tackles of the season, and his and
the rest of the defense's play will be
key over the next few weeks if
Stanford wants to win out and take
the Pac-12 championship.
However, much of the pressure
is going to sit squarely on the
shoulders of the offense and
Hogan. As Shaw said, "We needed
that extra bit of efficiency we were
not getting," and for Stanford to
meet its goal and make it to
Pasadena, Hogan will have to pro
vide it.
