### ELIZA THOMPSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford women's volleyball is coming off anoth
er successful weekend, with two significant victo
ries on the road against then-No. 2 Oregon and
Oregon State. And with a unanimous No. 1 ranking
in hand, Stanford (22-2,14 -0 Pac-12) seems to keep
fortifying its dominance within the Pac-12 and
national scene week by week.
The Cardinal shut out both the Ducks and
Beavers this past weekend, increasing its winning
streak to 20 games. It's the longest winning streak
for Stanford since the 1999 season, and also head
coach John Dunning's longest winning streak since
he took over on the Farm.
This weekend widened the gap in Pac-12 stand
ings between the Cardinal, which is still undefeated
in conference play, and 2nd-place Oregon; the gap
currently sits at three games. But with the frenetic
pace of conference play, Stanford will put its stand
ing and win streak on the line just two days after
returning from its swing through the Pacific
Northwest.

The Cardinal will face off against Washington

(19-4, 10-4) and Washington State (12-14, 2-12), in
the final matchups this season with the Washington
schools. Stanford will play Washington State
Wednesday, Nov. 7, and No. 5 Washington Thursday,
Nov. 8.

Stanford is looking stay undefeated at Maples
and make crucial steps toward a perfect season in
the Pac-12. Stanford can use its strong perform
ance in Oregon as momentum in its game against
WSU on Wednesday. Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat led the Cardinal in its 3 -0 victory against
Oregon State, with a .706 hitting percentage thanks
to 12 kills and zero hitting errors. She continued
her near-perfect hitting performance against
Oregon, where she hit .692, earning her Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
She must continue her solid hitting performance
against Washington State, which she did during the
teams' meeting earlier this season. The Cougars
are coming off their first Pac-12 weekend sweep
and first Pac-12 victories this season, with two vic
tories over Colorado and Utah.

The No. 1 Stanford women's volleyball team owns a 20-game winning streak. Senior Karissa Cook
(15) recorded 21 assists in the Cardinal's win over Oregon State. A two-time all-conference honoree,
Cook has formed a formidable tandem at setter next to freshman Madi Bugg.
against Colorado with 15 kills and
zero attacking errors. Libero Kate
Sommer also contributed signifi
cantly with 19 digs. Washington
State had only eight attacking
errors in their game against
Colorado, so the Cardinal will look
to control the game and force
Washington State into riskier
attacks.

Regardless of Washington
State's weekend sweep, Stanford
will be a heavy favorite at home.
The matchup with No. 5
Washington, however, will most
likely be a harder task for
Stanford. Both teams are coming
off exhausting schedules the
Cardinal and Huskies will end this
week having played three games in
a span of five days, with two games
back to back.

When the two played each other
at Washington last month, Wopat
once again had a big game with 15
kills, and sophomore libero Kyle
Gilbert had a tremendous perform
ance with 25 digs. While
Washington proved to be a tough
opponent, the Cardinal came out
on top in five games.
Stanford will need to depend on
Wopat for consistency and her
strong hitting and blocking power.
Freshman outside hitter and Pac
-12 Freshman of the Week Brittany
Howard has been improving every
game, and needs to continue her

strong offensive performance
against Washington.
The ankle injury to fellow fresh
man outside hitter Jordan Burgess
suffered in the Oregon State
match â€”is troubling, however. If
Burgess is unable to play, expect to
see a lot more of junior Rachel
Williams, who had 10 kills in the
win over Oregon.
Washington, on the other hand,
will be coming off a shakier week
end. The Huskies found them
selves down 0-2 against Utah,
which sits in the middle of the Pac
-12 standings. While Washington
was able to come back and win the
match in a fifth set, it will be hard
er to come from behind against
Stanford.

The Huskies will need a strong
performance from sophomore
Krista Vansant, who had a career
high eight blocks and 17 digs
against Utah. She represents one
of the tougher tests Stanford will
face against Washington's strong
blocking power the Huskies had
19 blocks against the Utes.
With the Cardinal holding the
momentum, and with its undefeat
ed Pac-12 and home record on the
line, Stanford sits in prime position
to push on toward the postseason
and a national seed in the NCAA
tournament. With just four more
conference games to play after this
week, a potential perfect Pac-12
record and conference crown is
also seeming more and more possi
ble.
