Stanford women's volleyball is coming off anoth
er successful weekend, with two significant victo
ries on the road against then-No. 2 Oregon and
Oregon State. And with a unanimous No. 1 ranking
in hand, Stanford (22-2,14 -0 Pac-12) seems to keep
fortifying its dominance within the Pac-12 and
national scene week by week.
The Cardinal shut out both the Ducks and
Beavers this past weekend, increasing its winning
streak to 20 games. It's the longest winning streak
for Stanford since the 1999 season, and also head
coach John Dunning's longest winning streak since
he took over on the Farm.
This weekend widened the gap in Pac-12 stand
ings between the Cardinal, which is still undefeated
in conference play, and 2nd-place Oregon; the gap
currently sits at three games. But with the frenetic
pace of conference play, Stanford will put its stand
ing and win streak on the line just two days after
returning from its swing through the Pacific
Northwest.

The Cardinal will face off against Washington

(19-4, 10-4) and Washington State (12-14, 2-12), in
the final matchups this season with the Washington
schools. Stanford will play Washington State
Wednesday, Nov. 7, and No. 5 Washington Thursday,
Nov. 8.

Stanford is looking stay undefeated at Maples
and make crucial steps toward a perfect season in
the Pac-12. Stanford can use its strong perform
ance in Oregon as momentum in its game against
WSU on Wednesday. Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat led the Cardinal in its 3 -0 victory against
Oregon State, with a .706 hitting percentage thanks
to 12 kills and zero hitting errors. She continued
her near-perfect hitting performance against
Oregon, where she hit .692, earning her Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week honors.
She must continue her solid hitting performance
against Washington State, which she did during the
teams' meeting earlier this season. The Cougars
are coming off their first Pac-12 weekend sweep
and first Pac-12 victories this season, with two vic
tories over Colorado and Utah.

(15) recorded 21 assists in the Cardinal's win over Oregon State. A two-time all-conference honoree,
Cook has formed a formidable tandem at setter next to freshman Madi Bugg.
