# PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
## ELECTION 2012 Tubbs new Stockton councilman Alum captures over 60 percent of vote in Calif. hometown 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
Michael Tubbs 'l2 has been elected
to Stockton City Council's sixth district,
beating incumbent Republican Dale
FHtchen.
Just after midnight, with 132
precincts reporting, Tubbs had secured
60.3 percent of votes compared to
Fritchen's 39.7 percent.
The 29,699 ballots cast for Tubbs, a
Democrat, make him the most popular
Stockton city official elected today. At
the time of publication he was over his
pre-election goal of 60 percent of the
vote.
Only 22, Tubbs graduated from
Stanford in June and is the third politi
cian to be endorsed by Oprah Winfrey,
behind President Barack Obama and
mayor Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92 of
Newark, N.J.
"I think we really showed what is
possible," Tubbs told The Daily. "I think
we really inspired a lot of people in
Stockton, but also everywhere, t0...
make communities better places."
Tubbs, who was born to a single
mother and an incarcerated father,
grew up in Stockton before enrolling at



TAMER SHABANI/The Stanford Daily
Stanford in 2008. Since his June
graduation, he has been splitting his
time on the campaign trail with his
job as coordinator of the University
of the Pacific's community environ
ment program.

His activism in the Stockton
community includes the founding of
nonprofit organizations like Save
Our Stockton, which he founded as
a sophomore at Stanford, and the
Summer Success and Leadership
Academy at the University of the
Pacific. Most recently, he founded
the Phoenix Scholars, a mentorship
and college admissions program for
underprivileged youth.
In 2010, he served as an inter

governmental affairs intern at the
White House, working under Senior
Adviser Valerie Jarrett and study
ing responses by different cities to
issues of violence and crime.
As the city council campaign
entered its final weeks, Tubbs unex
pectedly secured the endorsement
of The Stockton Record, Stockton's
daily newspaper. He has also been
endorsed by Stockton-area figures
Congressman Jerry McNerney and
rapper M.C. Hammer.
His margin of victory tonight
may have been a surprise to some,
but for Tubbs, it all went according
to plan.
"I personally would like 60 per
cent," he said to The Daily in a pre
election interview. "It would give a
nice little mandate for change."
