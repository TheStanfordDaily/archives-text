## Stanford men's crew in action at Newport Autumn Rowing Festival 
### 
The men's varsity eight and frosh
eight boats took to the water on
Sunday at the Newport Autumn
Rowing Festival in Newport Beach,
Calif., with the frosh boat taking first
place in its class and the varsity eight
taking third.
Cal's "A" entry won the varsity
eight class, finishing the course in
13:11, with the Cardinal's "A" team
crossing the line just four seconds
later. Stanford's "B" entry took sixth
in 13:49 and its "C" team 19th in
14:59.
"The focus of the Newport trip
has always been on team. Being a
good teammate and working together
to put one another in the best position
for success is paramount on this trip,"
said Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian. "The racing went well
with the varsity eight finishing just
four seconds back of Cal. The frosh
raced even with Cal also. All in all a
strong team building experience for
our young squad and a great chance to
uphold one another on the road."
Stanford will compete in the final
race of the fall season next Sunday in
the Head of the Lagoon event from
Foster City, Calif.
