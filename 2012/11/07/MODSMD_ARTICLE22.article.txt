# Defining or denying greatness
## 
### Vignesh Venkatamaran 
Few words in sports elicit
such varying degrees of
responses as the simple
phrase, "He's clutch."
Tony Romo? Please, don't
slander the good name of clutch by
mentioning him and it in the same
sentence. Eli Manning? Come playoff
time, he is unstoppable. Give him a
third and 99, and he will use super
glue, helmets and uncalled holding
penalties to somehow convert.
Michael Jordan? His Airness was the
very definition of clutch. Leßron
James? Just doesn't have it. He can't
win the big one... oh, wait. Houston,
we have a problem.
In team sports, there are so many
variables, so many moving parts that
it is nigh impossible to determine who
is clutch and who isn't. Players are
often dogged by stigmas of "clutch"
and "anticlutch" throughout their
careers, putting them in absurd
amounts of pressure to succeed and
lessening their abilities to perform at
the highest level.
Most devastating of all, however,
are the insane levels of achievement
necessary to be considered clutch. It
is in this columnist's humble opinion
that even God Almighty might not be
considered clutch in this day and age,
given the truly absurd requirements
to be given such a designation.
Take, for instance, the curious case
of a certain Thomas Edward Brady,
the golden-boy quarterback who
ascended the NFEs highest peak as
Super Bowl XXXVI champion when
he was just 24 years of age. For a
while, it seemed that Tom Brady
could do no wrong; with three Super
Bowl victories in his first four years of
play innumerable improbable come
backs and a supermodel wife to boot,
his clutch factor (if we define such a
thing) was off the charts. But slowly,
the league adjusted. The little tiny
breaks that went Brady's way in his
victories started to be the margin of
defeat in his painful losses.
Somewhere along the way, Brady lost
his invincibility, and the Golden Boy
became the Tarnished Bronze Man.
Living on the flip side is Leßron
James, who has struggled so mightily
in the playoffs and who redeemed
himself so exceptionally with his her
culean efforts last spring.
Behind an unfathomably good
Eastern Conference finals, where in
Game 6 he unleashed unholy terror
on the Celtics in an elimination con
test, Leßron proceeded to nearly
average a triple-double while routine
ly playing lockdown defense and play
ing all five positions on the court. It
was a display of incredible virtuosity
not seen since Magic Johnson took
the floor as a center when Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar got injured in his rook
ie season.
Despite his fast-receding hairline,
Leßron even managed to make a com
mercial that involved him getting a
haircut this summer. However, despite
championships at the national and
international levels, the perception
that Leßron is unclutch remains com
mon; it is the one demon that he will
likely never shake as a result of his
early-career struggles in the limelight.
The truth is that such debates
have raged throughout sporting histo
ry. We want to be able to say with cer
tainty that a specific player always
comes through, that he never let us
down, that he saved our bacon on
many an occasion.
Certain players have been demo
nized in the past for their choke jobs;
that selfsame Magic Johnson, who
buiied the Celtics in 1987 with a tran
scendental baby-sky-hook that
remains one of the most unforgettable
plays in NBA history, was once nearly
run out of LA for his performance
against the Celtics in 1984, where he
clanged free throws, turned the ball
over and otherwise wore goat-horns
throughout a miserable series.
John Elway lost playoff games in
the most gut-wrenching ways imagi
nable before finding redemption with
two brilliant Super Bowl victories in
his last two years in the league. The
difference is that these players have
rewritten the script and now go down
in history as winners.
The problem, then, is our instant
reaction subscription to sports in this
day and age. In many ways, this has
become both a blessing and a curse.
The dawn of the Twitterverse has
heralded the rise of armchair analysts
and instant judgment calls on players
and situations that aren't necessarily
so easy to judge.
We are so quick to critique, to dis
miss, and to tear down, while simulta
neously being so slow to build up and
support. The level of magnification on
each individual game, however small
and meaningless, has by extension
