# ELECTION 2012
## Obama defeats Romney, turns focus to second term 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Hope and Change" has found its
second wind.

Four years after then-Senator
Barack Obama rode an unprecedent
ed wave of enthusiasm and optimism
all the way to his election as the first
African-American president of the
United States, the Democratic incum
bent succeeded in his re-election bid
Tuesday night.

President Obama emphatically
overcame the challenge of Republican
nominee and former Mass. Governor
Mitt Romney to win a second term in
the Oval Office, securing 303 electoral
votes to Romney's 206. Twenty-nine
Electoral College votes from Florida
remain unallocated at the time of pub
lication.

Stanford professors largely
described the lopsided electoral out
come as expected, arguing that
national and state polls had indicated
such an outcome throughout the gen
eral election campaign.

"I'm not even remotely surprised,"
said Gary Segura, professor of politi
cal science. "The race went almost
exactly the way professionals said it
would go."
Jon Krosnick, professor of com
munication, argued that greater pub
lic awareness of the details of
Obama's signature 2010 health care
law and less racial intolerance among
the electorate might have further
extended the scale of Obama's tri
umph.
"If the public had been better edu
cated ... or if anti-black attitudes were
not as prevalent, his margin of victory
would have been quite a bit larger,"
Krosnick argued.
David Kennedy, professor of histo
ry, took the opposing viewpoint, not
ing the historical lack of precedent for
the re-election of a Democrat incum
bent in times of economic struggles.
"It wasn't predictable by any
means," Kennedy said. "He's only the
second Democrat to be elected to a

second term since FDR. He was
also bucking the unemployment
numbers."
"We're excited to see where we go
from here"
The Stanford Democrats,
watching the election unfold at the
Treehouse campus eatery, rapidly
shifted from apprehensive sus
pense to celebration, viewing
Obama's victory as the culmination

of months of student campaigning
and dedication.
"I'm nervous because I feel like
it's a lot closer than a lot of pundits
predicted," said Bianca Chavez 'l5
as the first set of states reported
their results. "After working on this
campaign for the last three months,
the thought of losing terrifies me."
Even as caution turned to exulta
tion, liberal students started look
ing ahead to Obama's second term.
Lindsay Lamont 'l3, president of
Stanford Democrats, insisted that
Obama will immediately turn his
attention to pressing issues facing
the nation.
"We'll hit the ground running,"

Lamont said. "We're excited to see
where we go from here."
In his victory speech, Obama
expressed similar sentiments,
establishing a second-term agenda
of rapidly increasing equality and
opportunity.
"Tonight... the task of perfect
ing our union moves forward,"
Obama said, after a raucous wel
come from the assembled Chicago
crowd and repeated chants of "four
more years."
"It moves forward because of
you," Obama added. "We are an
American family and we rise and
fall together as one nation."
Conservative students, who
gathered in the Mitchell Earth
Sciences Building to watch the
election, framed Obama's victory
as somewhat expected, if disap
pointing, and noted that the
Republican Party's retention of the
House of Representatives will pre
serve some Republican influence.
"I'm disappointed, obviously,"
said Kenny Capps 'l3, a Stanford
Conservative Society officer. "It
was going to be super close, but
[Obama] was probably expected to
win, so as far as that goes I'm
pleased. [Romney] did better than
McCain did, so that's good."
While Obama's 2008 call for
change prompted a remarkable
outpouring of support from stu
dents on campus and across the
nation, the impact of a bitterly par
tisan political atmosphere and the
subsequent Congressional stale
mate over the past few years was
evident last night in the increased
preference of student groups for
private election viewings over the
raucous celebrations of 2008.
"I think 2008 was a special
moment in the country's history,
one that young people were an
integral part of," wrote Elise
Timtim 'l3, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), in a prepared
statement. SIG co-hosted a 2008
election-viewing event at the
CoHo, which drew 500 students.
"A large, campus-wide celebra
tion [in 2008] was appropriate and
necessary," Timtim added. The
most attended public viewing this
year, the Stanford Democrats'
event, drew only 50 students.
"Right back where we started?"
Even as Obama supporters
savor Tuesday's hard-fought victo
ry, attention will soon turn to the
policies that an Obama administra
tion may pursue in its second term.
The nation's continuing economic
struggles, as well as an approach
ing debt ceiling debate and the
"fiscal cliff" combination of domes
tic spending cuts and Bush tax cut
expirations set to kick in at the end
of the year, will likely prompt
action from Obama even before his
second inauguration, although his
ability to do so effectively was
questioned by some faculty.
"We're essentially right back
where we started," Kennedy said.
"I don't think we should look to the
reelected president for any grand
vision of what the future holds and
we should not have expectations of

grand visions going forward ... He
did not get in this election the type
of mandate that will allow him to
get bold initiatives on those
[issues]."
"We're looking at a very close
popular vote, we're looking at little
change in Congress, and I think
there are just a lot of contradic
tions out there and we haven't fully
decided what to do about the prob
lems we face," said Morris Fiorina,
professor of political science.
"We're reluctant to really make
any hard choices at this point, and
I must say I'm a little discouraged
about what the future holds."
In a concession speech to sup
porters in Boston, Romney con
gratulated Obama and recognized
the need for bipartisan collabora
tion to resolve the most pressing
issues facing the nation.
"This is a time of great chal
lenges for America, and I pray that
the president will be successful in
guiding our nation," Romney said.
Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92, the
mayor of Newark, N.J., framed his
state's unified response to
Hurricane Sandy in which N.J.
Governor Chris Christie, a
Republican, worked closely with
Obama as evidence that crises
could prompt greater collaboration
between the two parties. He cred
ited the "strength that comes
through unity" for the ability to
work through crises.
For the Republican Party, the
future is less clear. Romney's nom
ination of Paul Ryan, a conserva
tive congressman from Wisconsin,
as his running mate was reflective
of the Party's shift to a more fiscal
ly and socially right-wing stance.
With Romney's defeat and the
inability of the GOP to obtain a
majority in the Senate despite
extensive external support and
funding, however, where the party
goes from here will be the subject
of much internal and public debate.
In his concession speech,
Romney applauded Ryan's work
within the Romney-Ryan ticket's
electoral campaign, tacitly
acknowledging him as a potential
future party leader.
"I'd like to thank Paul Ryan for
all he's done for our campaign and
our country," Romney said.
"Beside my wife Ann, Paul is the
best choice I've ever made."
Clayborne Carson, professor of
history, argued that the emphatic
electoral defeat might prompt the
Republican Party to return to
more centrist policies.
"Maybe this will send another
message," Carson said. "If Obama
has a successful second term and
they lose a few more elections,
they'll either become irrelevant as
a political party or get the message
that they have to change."
"How much do Republicans
want to rethink where they've
been? They've lost Senate seats
because of the way their primary
politics work [and] they lost at
least two tonight on that basis,"
said Jack Rakove, professor of
political science.
Reviewing the election's out

come, Carson drew attention to the
significance of Obama's re-election
as an African-American incum
bent.

"The biggest thing it showed
[was] that the American electorate
has changed," Carson said. "A
majority of white Americans have
not voted for a democratic presi
dential candidate in 50 years...
That's what the election showed,
that if you have a candidate that
can turn out voters and if all seg
ments of the voting population vote
in equal numbers, a candidate like
Obama is going to win."
For some students watching at
the Black Community Services
Center, however, Obama's race is
of immediate importance to their
political participation.
"I think it gives [the black com
munity] more reason to stay
engaged and know that a lot of the
issues that we hold near and dear
as the Stanford community and the
black community are issues that
our president cares about as well,"
said Garry Mitchell 'l3.
Beyond the significance of
Obama's race, the election also sig
naled the growing significance of
Hispanic voters within the elec
torate, particularly in swing states
such as Colorado where Romney's
hardline stance on immigration
may have cost him electorally.
"It's entirely possible that the
Latino community put the
President over the top," Segura
said, who still played down the like
lihood of comprehensive immigra
tion reform in Obama's second
term. "It's the first time in history."
Looking beyond the United
States, Larry Diamond '73 M.A.
'7B Ph.D. 'BO, Hoover Institution
senior fellow, suggested that
Obama's re-election may improve
perceptions of the United States
abroad and lead to a less con
frontational foreign policy towards
rising powers like China while
maintaining a strong posture
towards regional threats such as
Iran.
"Iran is definitely the most diffi
cult foreign policy issue he
[Obama] will have to deal with in
the next four years," Diamond said.
Obama will enter his second
term faced with significant chal
lenges but, removed from the pres
sures of re-election, with much less
to lose. In his Chicago victory
speech, he was adamant that his
second term will bring renewed
opportunities and advances for the
nation as a whole.
"We know that, in our hearts,
for the United States of America,
the best is yet to come," Obama
said. "I've never been more hopeful
about our future... I've never been
more hopeful about America."
