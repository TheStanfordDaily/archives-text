# Stanford vote leans left

### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Voters at campus precincts overwhelmingly supported the re
election of President Barack Obama. 88.11 percent of campus
voters favored granting the Democratic candidate a second term
according to an exit poll conducted by The Daily. Obama received
89.12 percent of the Stanford votes four years ago during the his
toric 2008 presidential race.

His opponent, Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney, received less than
seven percent of on-campus votes, down from the 9.52 percent
received by fellow Republican Sen. John McCain in 2008. Third
party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gov. Gary
Johnson of the Libertarian Party, picked up three percent and
two percent of this year's votes, respectively.
The Daily conducted an exit poll from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. by ask
ing every fifth voter at two Stanford precincts polling stations
at Tresidder Memorial Union and the Haas Center for Public
Service to complete an anonymous survey. A third campus
precinct was located at Nixon Elementary School.
In the 306 anonymous surveys collected, respondents were
divided about the issue that most influenced their presidential

voie: nearly percent
cited the economy, 32 per
cent social issues and 11
percent foreign policy. This
represents a shift from
2008 when 51 answered the
economy, 16.7 the war in
Iraq or Afghanistan and
only 9.4 social issues.
Campus voters continued
to align with the
Democratic Party, with
respondents supporting
Dianne Feinstein for U.S.
Senate and Anna Eshoo for
U.S. Representative of
California's 18th congres
sional district by large mar
gins.
High voter turnout sur
prised officials at the
Tresidder precinct, which
ran out of ballots early in
the afternoon. While the
polling center started off
the day with 525 ballots,
nearly 670 community
members ended up voting
at this location, according
to precinct inspector
Letitia Lai.
Lai said she noticed early
in the day that the polling
location would not have
enough ballots. She called
the Santa Clara County
Registrar, which at first
recommended giving vot
ers ballots printed in non-
English languages.
Instead, polling officials

used sample ballots to tide them
over while the Registrar
searched for extra ballots at
nearby precincts.
Tresidder voting officials also
sent voters filling out provisional
ballots to the Haas polling center

after exhausting their supply.
Provisional ballots are given to
voters who do not appear on an
electoral roll.
Megan Gage 'l5, a poll work
er at Haas, said she noticed an
influx of voters directed to their
polling location from Tresidder
midway through the afternoon.
Many voters decided to cast
their ballots at Tresidder, despite
the fact that they were not on its
roster, due to its central location

on campus.
"Because of the higher num
ber of students who went to
Tresidder, they required a high
er number of provisional bal
lots," Gage said. 'As with [our
precinct], it's mainly graduate
students who knew what was
going on and had all their stuff
together."
Almost 68 percent of voters
at the Haas polling center identi
fied as graduate students, com
pared to the Tresidder polling
center, where 74 percent of
respondents were undergradu
ates.
According to Lai, Tresidder
polling officials had to turn away
or give provisional ballots to a
large number of these students
because they were registered to
vote in another state or another
county. Some of these voters
stated that they had not been
mailed their absentee ballot in
time.
"A lot of them are freshmen
they followed the rules and
tried to do the right thing, but
for some reason, they didn't
receive their absentee ballot in
time," Lai said. "I felt bad for the
people who tried to vote, but
could not."
Despite these problems,
92.17 percent of those who suc
cessfully voted reported satisfac
tion with their- polling location.
Campus voters surveyed also
supported Proposition 34, the
initiative that would repeal the
state's death penalty for life in
prison without parole, and
Proposition 37, which would
require food sold to consumers
with "genetically modified"
material to be identified as such.
