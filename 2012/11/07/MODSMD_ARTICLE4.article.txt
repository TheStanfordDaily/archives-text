### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Voters at campus precincts overwhelmingly supported the re
election of President Barack Obama. 88.11 percent of campus
voters favored granting the Democratic candidate a second term
according to an exit poll conducted by The Daily. Obama received
89.12 percent of the Stanford votes four years ago during the his
toric 2008 presidential race.

His opponent, Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney, received less than
seven percent of on-campus votes, down from the 9.52 percent
received by fellow Republican Sen. John McCain in 2008. Third
party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gov. Gary
Johnson of the Libertarian Party, picked up three percent and
two percent of this year's votes, respectively.
The Daily conducted an exit poll from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. by ask

at Tresidder Memorial Union and the Haas Center for Public
Service to complete an anonymous survey. A third campus
precinct was located at Nixon Elementary School.
In the 306 anonymous surveys collected, respondents were
divided about the issue that most influenced their presidential

cited the economy, 32 per
cent social issues and 11
percent foreign policy. This
represents a shift from
2008 when 51 answered the
economy, 16.7 the war in
Iraq or Afghanistan and
only 9.4 social issues.
Campus voters continued
to align with the
Democratic Party, with
respondents supporting
Dianne Feinstein for U.S.
Senate and Anna Eshoo for
U.S. Representative of
California's 18th congres
sional district by large mar
gins.
High voter turnout sur
prised officials at the
Tresidder precinct, which
ran out of ballots early in
the afternoon. While the
polling center started off
the day with 525 ballots,
nearly 670 community
members ended up voting
at this location, according
to precinct inspector
Letitia Lai.
Lai said she noticed early
in the day that the polling
location would not have
enough ballots. She called
the Santa Clara County
Registrar, which at first
recommended giving vot

English languages.
