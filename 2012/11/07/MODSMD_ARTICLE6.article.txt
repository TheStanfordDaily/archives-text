# ELECTION 2012
## D.C. students join W.H. rally 
### MOLLY VORWERCK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Twenty-six Stanford students were in Washington
D.C. for Obama's win last night, but President Obama
was in Chicago. As replacements, the students took card
board cutouts of Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as
Vice-President Joe Biden, to a gathering outside the
White House, where a small crowd formed to celebrate
the incumbent's re-election.
"Someone carrying an Obama cardboard cutout thru
the crowd outside the WH. A woman yells, "There he is!
Obama!" People cheer for the cutout," Buzz Feed Capitol
Hill reporter Rebecca Berg reported in a tweet at around
12:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
"Hundreds of college students gathered outside the
White House cheering Pres. Obama's projected re-elec
tion," tweeted CBS News White House Correspondent
Mark Knoller. "The students are chanting 'four more
years' and carrying signs of support for Pres Obama,
including life-size cutouts."
The brief moment of fame the Stanford in Washington
(SIW) students and their cutouts enjoyed was not the
only way this year's election has affected their experience
in the nation's capital. In fact, for most SIW students, the
election was the satisfying culmination of a quarter of
political mania.
James Honsa 'l4, an intern at the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy, chose to participate in
SIW during fall quarter of his junior year in part because
of the opportunity to experience Washington, D.C. during
an election.
"I was already excited to get a taste of D.C. culture
and lifestyle, and I thought being here during election
season would amplify the experience," Honsa said.
In the days leading up to election night, students can
vassed for both Obama and Romney, and also volunteered
with Election Protection, a nonpartisan organization
aimed at providing polling location information to voters.
The organization notably helped prevent the disenfran
chisement of communities whose voting locations had
been damaged as Hurricane Sandy passed through the
region.

"We got a lot of calls from New Jersey and states
affected by the storm, and a lot of them asked about
whether their polling places had power," said Patricia Ho
'l4, a phone bank volunteer. "Helping out with the phone
bank would have been useful in any year, but in this par
ticular election, given recent events, I felt like I was con
tributing more than I might have been normally."
For some students, the election was even more a part
of daily life. Danna Seligman 'l4 is an intern at the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The elec

tions both presidential and congressionalâ€”were piv
otal in shaping her work experience.
"My job has been to organize the collective online
campaign to maintain a majority in the Senate for
Democrats, and the ups and downs of the campaigns
mandated what I was doing on a daily basis," SeHgman
said.
Even students whose internships were not affected by
the election were exposed to an almost constant dialogue
about the elections.
Lauren Felice 'l4, an intern for the Senate Finance
Committee, argued that the elections affected everything
within the SIW experience, from the events the students
attended and volunteered at to daily dinner table conver
sations among program participants.
"I feel like there's a heightened level of political activ
ity and engagement on the issues," Felice said. "We talk
about these things more than we normally would."
Students waited for the results with an election night
party held in the SIW basement's Distance Learning
Center, chatting about the state-by-state outcomes,
snacking on politically-themed treats including don
key and elephant shaped sugar cookies and watching
the coverage on CNN as it aired live on the east coast.
Two students, Aditya Todi 'l4 and Lindsay Fhnk 'l3,
live-blogged the election during the festivities. Both stu
dents were responsible for reporting election news for a
specific state on PolicyMic, a bipartisan political news site
co-founded by Jake Horowitz 'O9.
At approximately 11:20 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
most news stations had projected Barack Obama's re
election after he clinched Ohio and led in Florida. The
news was met with mostly cheers, and the predominant
ly liberal group of students celebrated the victory with
their late night trip to the White House.
According to Lauryn Williams 'l4, who voted for
Obama in this year's election, the announcement of his
victory was greeted with both excitement and relief.
"I think after the twists and turns this election has
taken, and the fact that it has taken [up] the better part of
two years, I'm just relieved to get to this point," Williams
said.
With the election over, students are now able to reflect
on their experiences at the epicenter of American politics.
"It didn't hit me until I woke up this morning... that I
was here at this really truly historic moment for politics
and for our generation," Seligman said. "For someone
who is incredibly idealistic about politics, even seeing all
of the craziness that goes on behind campaigns hasn't
shaken my determination to make a positive difference
politics and elections in the future."
