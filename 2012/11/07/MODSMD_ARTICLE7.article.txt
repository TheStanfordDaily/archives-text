# Q&A
## Castro '96 on Latino vote, Obama victory 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Julian Castro '96, mayor of San
Antonio, spoke to The Daily
shortly after Barack Obama
was reelected to his second
term as president of the
United States. Castro was elected
mayor of San Antonio in 2009 and
was, at the time, the youngest
mayor in the history of America's
50 largest counties.
Castro attracted national media
attention this September as the
keynote speaker at the Democratic
National Convention. He spoke
with The Daily on the president's
re-election, the Latino vote and the
election of twin his brother Joaquin
Castro '96 to the U.S. House of
Representatives.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Your
reactions for the election result,
Mayor Castro?

Julian Castro (JC): Very happy
that the President has been reelect
ed; he earned it. The nation made a
lot of progress over the last four
years, and voters rewarded the
president for the progress we've
made as a nation under his watch.

TSD: How will the shifting demo
graphics of the United States shape
presidential elections to come?

JC: The Republican Party has
backed itself into a political corner.
The Democratic Party is the big
tent party in America now. This
election and the 2008 election made
this very clear. It's necessary for
the Republican Party to reach out
more to Hispanics and women, and
go beyond the right-wing ideology
that has propelled it over the last
few electoral cycles.

TSD: Do you think Latinos played
a big role in Obama's re-election
tonight?
JC: Absolutely. The exit polling
from tonight shows that more than
70 percent of Latinos supported the
president. That's more than any
candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996,
