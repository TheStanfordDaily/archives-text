# Q&A
## Castro '96 on Latino vote, Obama victory 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Julian Castro '96, mayor of San
Antonio, spoke to The Daily
shortly after Barack Obama
was reelected to his second
term as president of the
United States. Castro was elected
mayor of San Antonio in 2009 and
was, at the time, the youngest
mayor in the history of America's
50 largest counties.
Castro attracted national media
attention this September as the
keynote speaker at the Democratic
National Convention. He spoke
with The Daily on the president's
re-election, the Latino vote and the
election of twin his brother Joaquin
Castro '96 to the U.S. House of
Representatives.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Your
reactions for the election result,
Mayor Castro?

Julian Castro (JC): Very happy
that the President has been reelect
ed; he earned it. The nation made a
lot of progress over the last four
years, and voters rewarded the
president for the progress we've
made as a nation under his watch.

TSD: How will the shifting demo
graphics of the United States shape
presidential elections to come?

JC: The Republican Party has
backed itself into a political corner.
The Democratic Party is the big
tent party in America now. This
election and the 2008 election made
this very clear. It's necessary for
the Republican Party to reach out
more to Hispanics and women, and
go beyond the right-wing ideology
that has propelled it over the last
few electoral cycles.

TSD: Do you think Latinos played
a big role in Obama's re-election
tonight?
JC: Absolutely. The exit polling
from tonight shows that more than
70 percent of Latinos supported the
president. That's more than any
candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996,

and particularly in battleground
states, the Latino vote has grown
quickly and made a big impact.
What the Latino surge in voting
means for the Republican Party is
that they need to change their
stance on immigration, in invest
ment in education and in healthcare
or they risk losing an even greater
share of the fastest growing com
munity in the United States.
TSD: You famously said in your
DNC speech, "It starts with educa
tion." What will President Obama
do with a second term in the space
of education, and what do you hope
he will do?
JC: I hope he'll continue to invest in
Pell grants and student loans that
make college more affordable and
more accessible to young people. I
hope that he will continue to invest
in Race to the Top and other educa
tion reforms that improve public
schools around the country. And I
hope that he'll work with
Republicans to find common
ground on those education issues.
TSD: What will President Obama's
re-election mean for San Antonio
residents in particular?
JC: San Antonio is a city on the rise.
San Antonio is a city of many peo
ple who are aspiring, a lot of work
ing class families who believe that
they will be benefited by
Obamacare, by investment in Pell
grants and by student loan reform.
And so I'm confident that the vast
majority of San Antonio will be
benefited by the president's poli
cies. San Antonio also has a seat at
the table with the administration,
so that will be healthy.
TSD: The subject of immigration is
a testy, difficult one that many con
gresses have attempted to solve,

unsuccessfully. How should immi
gration reform be addressed by the
president and the new Congress?
JC: The president will have a prime
opportunity to address immigra
tion reform in his next term I'm
convinced that he'll do it. The
Republicans heard a strong mes
sage from the Latino community
tonight that they must address
comprehensive immigration reform
and the Dream Act, and I believe
they will.
TSD: Your brother enters perhaps
one of the most dysfunctional
organs of America's governing
body. How will a once again divided
Congress impact the legislation
that comes out of Washington?
JC: It's hard to tell, but President
Obama certainly got a mandate
tonight. My hope is that the
Republican Congress with him and
Democrats to meet in the middle.
That's the overwhelming message
that American voters sent tonight.
Hopefully my brother will enter a
Congress where there will be more
compromise than before.
TSD: On day one of the new presi
dent's day in office, what's the
agenda?
JC: To continue focusing on creat
ing jobs, bringing the economy
back, to collaborate with both par
ties [and] find common ground on
important issues that affect the
American people, like education,
immigration reform and others.
TSD: And finally, how are you cele
brating tonight?
JC: Well, I already went to two vic
tory parties for my brother, and we
had an education initiative on the
ballot that's called Pre-K 4 SA
[which passed], and now I'm going
to go meet up with many of the vol
unteers and the staff to thank them.
Right now, I'm actually at City Hall
watching the election coverage.
