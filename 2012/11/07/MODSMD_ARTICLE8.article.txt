## 'A mandate for Congress': Booker on Obama's re-election 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92 is
the mayor of Newark,
N.J., a position he has
held since 2006. Booker,
who has been a promi
nent campaign surrogate for
President Barack Obama, spoke to
The Daily before the winner of the
2012 presidential election was
announced to discuss his predictions,
the impact of Hurricane Sandy on
governance and bipartisanship and
the most pressing issues that the
president of the United States will
need to address.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
do you believe will be the election's
outcome?
Cory Booker (CB): I'm very confi
dent that Barack Obama is going to
win. I saw the latest polling before
the actual election took place and he
was ahead in Ohio, ahead in Florida,
close but ahead in Pennsylvania, so I
feel pretty confident that he's going
to win. And again, often that polling
does not capture voters who are part
of this enthusiastic surge [of] non
traditional voters people who are
not likely voters so I have a lot of
hope and belief that President
Obama will win.
TSD: What can the citizens of
Newark expect with an Obama victo
ry, or a Romney victory?
CB: There have been a lot of changes
that have already been made, that
Obama has done, that have changed
the city. Everything from foreign
policy so many of our kids were
fighting in Iraq and he's brought
them home [to] the health care

bill that is really going to empower
our city and give more people access
to a?ordable health care.
We have a stimulus program that
really did create jobs in our cities
and made critical investments in
infrastructure. We had a lot of pro
grams that helped small businesses
in our city and improve their ability
to endure the very tough economy.
We had, with President Obama, a lot
of women's issues, from the Lily
Ledbetter law to ... frankly just
standing up for the basic right for a
woman to choose what happens with
her body.
I could go on and on [on] the ways
Obama has already changed the city
in the last four years you know
Pell Grants, giving our people more
access to higher education. I feel
what Obama will do in his second
term is in many ways a direct contin
uation along those issues that a?ect
our economy. We're going to continue
to push for a jobs program that will
empower our kids, and then he's
going to deal with a lot of other
issues, from immigration to continu
ing to expand our energy policy so
that America moves further towards
energy independence.
TSD: What should Hurricane Sandy
and the efforts to contain its after
math teach the next president about
bipartisanship and reaching across
the aisle?
CB: Especially in my home state of
New Jersey we saw a lot of examples
of people working together across
the aisle. Obviously many of us have

heard about [Governor] Chris
Christie and Obama working
together across the aisle. I think
what's encouraging about this time
of crisis is not just the fact that peo
ple are working across the aisle but
between multiple layers of govern
ment. To have the president of the
United States reaching out to me on
the night of a storm, talking to cabi
net members on the federal level,
talking to the Christie administra
tion all of these things have made
for a very hopeful time [with] the
ability to work together in a time of
crisis and with the strength that
comes through unity.
TSD: What are the most pressing
legislative concerns that the presi
dent faces?
CB: We have problems with the
fiscal cliff, we have the debt ceiling
issue coming up again, and I'm hop
ing that the president's jobs plan
will be able to include some invest
ment. All of these things will have to
be dealt with right away. The next
president hopefully it will be
Baraek Obama will have to deal
with these immediately.
TSD: What will the e?ect of a divid
ed legislative branch be on the pres

ident's agenda?
CB: We've already seen that... it's
very difficult to move on the very
big issues from immigration to eco
nomic expansion. The nimble bits of
our government in these complicat
ed times seem to be ground down.
The debt ceiling crisis is a great
example of that. I'm hoping that if
Barack Obama is re-elected that it
will serve as a mandate to Congress,
that the American people really
believe in this president and his
vision for the future.
TSD: What mandate will Obama
have if he is elected?
CB: Well, I hope that there is obviously
a mandate for healthcare, you know
he's come out and endorsed a Simpson-
Bowles type plan for decreasing our
debt, which involves cuts in spending as
well as some revenue.
I'm hoping that he has a man
date around immigration and some
of the changes that remain there.
I'm hoping that he brings momen
tum on the larger issues that still
undermine our country's e?ective
ness. At Stanford University for
example, you have all of these
incredible minds that come and
study at our universities on student
visas, but as soon as they graduate
they're kicked out of our country.
These are the sort of things that
need to be addressed and hopefully
the president will be able to bring
our legislature together to actually
do things that actually build our

economy, like the visas necessary to
keep people here... that will create
our nation's economic growth.
TSD: What are two moments that
stood out in this presidential race?
CB: I was actually asked this ques
tion on Meet the Press. One thing
that stuck out in my mind as a
moment of disappointment was dur
ing the Republican primaries when
they were asked if they...would
accept $lO in revenue cuts for $1 of
revenue increase. It's a logical thing
to do, but all of the Republicans,
Romney included, said that they
would not do it, which shows to me
that they do not have a balanced
approach to solve our problems.
You had major CEOs come out
and embrace this approach, you had
Simpson-Bowles endorse a bal
anced approach, but here was this
Republican Party digging its heels
in the ground and becoming more
ideological than practical. [lt]
reminded me of a certain trend in
the Republican Party... as that Tea
Party is pulling the Republican
Party to an extreme.
The other highlight for me was
Bill Clinton's convention speech.
That was a wonderful, plainspoken
analysis of what was really going on
in our country. And his focus on arith
metic, as he called it, was a shot of
adrenaline for the Democratic Party
and Barack Obama specifically.
