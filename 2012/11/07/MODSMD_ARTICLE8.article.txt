## 'A mandate for Congress': Booker on Obama's re-election 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Cory Booker '9l M.A. '92 is
the mayor of Newark,
N.J., a position he has
held since 2006. Booker,
who has been a promi
nent campaign surrogate for
President Barack Obama, spoke to
The Daily before the winner of the
2012 presidential election was
announced to discuss his predictions,
the impact of Hurricane Sandy on
governance and bipartisanship and
the most pressing issues that the
president of the United States will
need to address.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
do you believe will be the election's
outcome?
Cory Booker (CB): I'm very confi
dent that Barack Obama is going to
win. I saw the latest polling before
the actual election took place and he
was ahead in Ohio, ahead in Florida,
close but ahead in Pennsylvania, so I
feel pretty confident that he's going
to win. And again, often that polling
does not capture voters who are part
of this enthusiastic surge [of] non
traditional voters people who are
not likely voters so I have a lot of
hope and belief that President
Obama will win.
TSD: What can the citizens of
Newark expect with an Obama victo
ry, or a Romney victory?
CB: There have been a lot of changes
that have already been made, that
Obama has done, that have changed
the city. Everything from foreign
policy so many of our kids were
fighting in Iraq and he's brought
them home [to] the health care

bill that is really going to empower
our city and give more people access
to a?ordable health care.
We have a stimulus program that
really did create jobs in our cities
and made critical investments in
infrastructure. We had a lot of pro
grams that helped small businesses
in our city and improve their ability
to endure the very tough economy.
We had, with President Obama, a lot
of women's issues, from the Lily
Ledbetter law to ... frankly just
standing up for the basic right for a
woman to choose what happens with
her body.
I could go on and on [on] the ways
Obama has already changed the city
in the last four years you know
Pell Grants, giving our people more
access to higher education. I feel
what Obama will do in his second
term is in many ways a direct contin
uation along those issues that a?ect
our economy. We're going to continue
to push for a jobs program that will
empower our kids, and then he's
going to deal with a lot of other
issues, from immigration to continu
ing to expand our energy policy so
that America moves further towards
energy independence.
TSD: What should Hurricane Sandy
and the efforts to contain its after
math teach the next president about
bipartisanship and reaching across
the aisle?
CB: Especially in my home state of
New Jersey we saw a lot of examples
of people working together across
the aisle. Obviously many of us have
