# STROKE OF GENIUS
## WILSON SHOOTS 61 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Riding a record effort from
junior Cameron Wilson, the men's
golf team finished second at the
Gifford Collegiate at CordeValle
to close out the fall schedule for
Stanford.
Buoyed by Wilson's course
record 61 in the opening round,
the No. 20 Card finished just eight
strokes behind No. 8 UCLA and
had three golfers in the top-10
individually, led by Wilson's sec
ond-place finish.
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers
and freshman David Boote fin
ished in a tie for ninth place at 1-
up (214) while freshman Dominick
Francks recorded the best result
of his young collegiate career with
a tie for 20th, four strokes behind
Boote and Rodgers. Senior Steve
Kearney and junior Shane Leßow
completed the team scoring in a
tie for 41st.
But it was Wilson who had the
galleries buzzing after opening
with a round of -10 on the
CordeValle Resort course on
Monday. The score was one stroke
better than the previous low
round on the Robert Trent Jones
designed course, most recently
posted by PGA players John
Mallinger and Nick O'Hern at the
2012 Frys.com Open in October. It
was also the lowest score posted
anywhere in the history of
Stanford's golf program, tying
Tiger Woods's round at the 1996
Pac-12 Championships.

"Cameron's round today was
one of the best in Stanford's golf
program history," head coach
Conrad Ray said. "Cameron
seemed very comfortable from
the first tee shot today. This is his
third year competing in the
Gifford Intercollegiate Golf
Championship, and he likes the
CordeValle course."
Like it he does, as he fired a -bl
under-par 30 on the front nine
the only blemish on the card being
a bogey on the par-4 fourth hole
and followed it up with a -bl
under-par 31 on the back nine,
including a birdie at 18.
Stanford was just two strokes
back of the Bruins after the open
ing round, and Wilson was seven
strokes clear of the field in first
place.
But it is hard to maintain such
impressive play for an entire
event, and two double bogeys
proved costly for Wilson on the
second and third day, giving him a
career-best finish of second with
an incredible 15 birdies over 54
holes.
While the 61 was unexpected,
there have definitely been signs
that Wilson's game has been shap
ing up to go very low. After quali
fying for the U.S. Open at the
Olympic Club over the summer,
Wilson missed a pair of early-sea
son tournaments for the Cardinal
recovering from a back injury, but
posted a 69 in his return at the
U.S. Intercollegiate.

Thanks to junior Cameron Wilson's first-round 61, the men's golf team
placed second at the Gifford Collegiate this week. Wilson set the
CordeValle Resort course record with 11 birdies and one bogey en
route to a runner-up finish in the individual competition.
With a very formidable
scoring tandem in Wilson and
Rodgers (a PING AU-American
last season and currently the
No. 1 golfer in Golfweek's col
legiate rankings), as well as
two youngsters in Boote and
Francks who have shown real
signs of potential, Stanford
should prove a tough oppo
nent to beat when the regular

season kicks off in February.
If Kearney, Leßow or per
haps sophomore Patrick
Grimes, who competed as an
individual at CordeValle and
finished in a tie for 16th after
shooting a second round 66,
can provide a boost to the back
end of the lineup, the Cardinal
will be competing with defend
ing champion Cal and the rest
of the top 10 for a spot in the
NCAA Championships come
May.

season kicks off in February.
If Kearney, Leßow or per
haps sophomore Patrick
Grimes, who competed as an
individual at CordeValle and
finished in a tie for 16th after
shooting a second round 66,
can provide a boost to the back
end of the lineup, the Cardinal
will be competing with defend
ing champion Cal and the rest
of the top 10 for a spot in the
NCAA Championships come
May.
