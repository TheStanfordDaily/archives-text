## BRUINS FIRMLY IN THE WAY 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 3 Stanford versus No. 2 UCLA under the
lights on a Friday night. The stage is set brilliantly
for one of the most important regular season
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match-ups of
the season.
"When you're going on the road you know its
going to be a crazy environment, a night game at
UCLAâ€” huge game," redshiit junior goalie
Scott Platshon said.

This will be a match-up of two effective, but

very different, offenses. UCLAleads the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation in team goals with an
eye-popping 14.67 goals per game. The Bruins
have only have two of the top-25 scorers however,
neither of whom is in the top eight, a sign of their
depth.
Stanford has two players in the top 25 in scor
ing as well, but they have been much more prolific
than UCLAs duo. Freshman driver Brett Bonanni
comes in as the conference's second leading scorer,
while sophomore utility Alex Bowen is sixth. These
two have scored the vast majority of Stanford's
goals, especially of late, which could explain why

Stanford is sixth out of eight teams in goals per
game.
This unbalanced scoring has led to plenty of
wins recently, as Stanford is on a season-high six
game winning steak. The most astounding statis
tic from these six games is that Bonanni has scored
at least three goals in every one of them.
"[Bonanni] is starting to adjust to the level of
college play and learn really how to read goalies
and how to read defenses," Platshon said.
UCLA is a step above the teams the Cardinal
