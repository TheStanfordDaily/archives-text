## BRUINS FIRMLY IN THE WAY 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 3 Stanford versus No. 2 UCLA under the
lights on a Friday night. The stage is set brilliantly
for one of the most important regular season
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match-ups of
the season.
"When you're going on the road you know its
going to be a crazy environment, a night game at
UCLAâ€” huge game," redshiit junior goalie
Scott Platshon said.

This will be a match-up of two effective, but

very different, offenses. UCLAleads the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation in team goals with an
eye-popping 14.67 goals per game. The Bruins
have only have two of the top-25 scorers however,
neither of whom is in the top eight, a sign of their
depth.
Stanford has two players in the top 25 in scor
ing as well, but they have been much more prolific
than UCLAs duo. Freshman driver Brett Bonanni
comes in as the conference's second leading scorer,
while sophomore utility Alex Bowen is sixth. These
two have scored the vast majority of Stanford's
goals, especially of late, which could explain why

Stanford is sixth out of eight teams in goals per
game.
This unbalanced scoring has led to plenty of
wins recently, as Stanford is on a season-high six
game winning steak. The most astounding statis
tic from these six games is that Bonanni has scored
at least three goals in every one of them.
"[Bonanni] is starting to adjust to the level of
college play and learn really how to read goalies
and how to read defenses," Platshon said.
UCLA is a step above the teams the Cardinal
has been playing though, and
simply trying to outscore them
will not be enough without a
strong defensive effort. The
defense has faltered in major
games this year, and even dur
ing this winning streak it has
been less than airtight.
"Our offense is awesome.
What's going to determine the
rest of our season is the
defense," Platshon said.
But there isn't much sea
son left, and every game is
meaningful from here on out.
Stanford has only one regular
season game left after UCLA,
the Senior Day game against
Pepperdine. Those results will
have strong postseason impli
cations for both the MPSF
Tournament and the NCAAs.
"A win puts us in a really
good spot right now," Platshon
said. "It keeps us alive in the
at-large race and sets us up
with a really good seed going
into the MPSF Tournament."
One factor that will make

this game unusual is that it will
be the first meeting of the sea
son between the two teams.
Stanford has already played
each of the other top five teams
at least two times this season,
which is more of the norm.
This year however, Stanford
and UCLA did not meet dur
ing the preseason tourna
ments and their regular season

match-up was scheduled for
the second-to-last week.
"It is a little weird that we
haven't played them yet,"
Platson said, adding that
Stanford is fairly familiar with
UCLAs roster because they
have faced those players many
times in past years.
Both teams will be happy to
get a full scouting report on

each other, because it is very
likely that their next meeting
will be in the MPSF
Tournament with a trip to the
finals on the line.
The game is scheduled to
start this Friday at 7 p.m. in
Los Angeles.
