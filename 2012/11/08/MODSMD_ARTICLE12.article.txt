# Q&A Rachel QUON
## 
### TSD: Thanks so much, Rachel. Quon: Thank you 
As a member of Stanford women's soc
cer's class of 2013, Rachel Quon will
complete her collegiate careers as one
of the few athletes who has no idea
what it feels like to lose a conference
match.
In her four year's on the Farm, the three-time All-
Pac-12 honoree and 2010 All-American Quon and the
Cardinal have gone a perfect 40-0 in first Pac-10 and
then Phc-12 play After two seasons that ended in
defeat in the NCAA Championship match, Stanford
broke through last season with a 1-0 victory over
Duke to win the program's first national title.
The attacking outside back from Lake Forest, 111.
sat down with The Daily to take on all things
Stanford soccer.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How difficult is it to
focus on the N CAA Tournament being in the same
situation with a Pac-12 title in hand for the fourth
year in a row?
Rachel Quon (Quon): I think that Paul [Ratcliffe]
and all the rest of the coaches do a great job of
keeping us focused. In the beginning of the season
we have two main goals: win the Pac-12 and then
win the NCAA Championship. And I think espe
cially when we get into Pac-12 play we take it one
game at a time. Each game counts if you want to
win the Pac-12 and each game is always very
tough. You know that every conference game is
going to be a good one, so once we locked down Cal
[in the regular season finale] and were able to a
win there, our next mindset is the national champi
onship. Paul emphasizes one game at a time and I
think that's what we do and each week is a new
week and focusing on a new opponent.
TSD: To some extent, this is old hat for you. You're
the defending national champs with a strong sen
ior class: what's the team dynamic like?
Quon: I think that experience is definitely an
advantage for us and I hope it comes through dur
ing the tourney. And again we know each game is
going to be hard it's the playoffs so you have to
win or you're out. So having that experience, hav
ing a lot of players who've been in this situation in
the Final Four already is an advantage knowing
what to expect and the mindset we have to bring.
TSD: What kind of legacy do you hope to leave
when all is said and done? At this point, you have
to kind of be like, "Wow, this is close to being done,
there's five games left."
Quon: Six games, don't remind me.
TSD: [Laughs] Well what does it mean to do that,
not losing a single Pac-12 game in four years? Is
that at some point just staggering?

Quon: Well, yeah. I know our senior class wants to
make just a positive difference, and it's not just the
senior class, it's the whole team; and I think we
have a mindset of wanting to do it for each other
and for the people ahead of us who've made the
program what it is today and teaching the younger
ones what Stanford's all about.

TSD: I know you're very competitive. What is

your favorite part of this time of year when the
playoffs come rolling around?
Quon: This is the time where we really have to
come together, and you really see it; everyone is
trying their best, whether they're on bench, start
ing, a sub, everyone knows their role and they
want to do it for the team. And I think that's my
favorite part, seeing everyone do it for the whole
team and the cause of helping us win. With win
ning comes a lot of fun.
TSD: Do you guys have any superstitions or ritu
als?
Quon: Our team is actually pretty superstitious,
it's kind of funny. Personally I always have the
same pre-game meal a grilled chicken sand
wich and fruit and I almost always walk to the
field with Lo'eau [Labonta]. She calms me down,
makes me laugh before the game, which is good.
TSD: What songs are playing on the locker room's
iPod?
Quon: Well whose iPod is in the locker room?
TSD: Good question. Whose is in there?
Quon: Well really it's whoever gets there first. We
have a lot of country fans, so there's usually a lot
of country playing. Last week we had Michael
Jackson. Before games Emily [Oliver] usually
plays her iPod. "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore is
an up-and-coming one right now.
TSD: Okay, what's your go-to study spot?
Quon: I like studying in my room, but if not there,
then in the Alumni Cafe.
TSD:Best meal on campus?
Quon:Has to be Lake Lag Late Nite breakfast
burritos. Too bad I don't have Cardinal dollars
anymore!
TSD: Anything left for you to do here? What do
you want to accomplish before graduation in June?
Quon:Oh, I have a long bucket list. A lot people
are going to be like, "Are you kidding me." One, I
want to finish the season off right and by right I
mean, just do everything I can and have no
regrets. And then, a lot of people are going to
laugh at me for a lot of this, but I want to run cam
pus loop, walk the Dish, go steam tunneling, take
a class in the glass room in the front of Arrillaga,
I want to golf at the Stanford golf course. I want
to go see every sport on campus I've been to a
lot, but not some of the more obscure ones like
rowing. But I've been to squash...

playoffs come rolling around?
Quon: This is the time where we really have to
come together, and you really see it; everyone is
trying their best, whether they're on bench, start
ing, a sub, everyone knows their role and they
want to do it for the team. And I think that's my
favorite part, seeing everyone do it for the whole
team and the cause of helping us win. With win
ning comes a lot of fun.
TSD: Do you guys have any superstitions or ritu
als?
Quon: Our team is actually pretty superstitious,
it's kind of funny. Personally I always have the
same pre-game meal a grilled chicken sand
wich and fruit and I almost always walk to the
field with Lo'eau [Labonta]. She calms me down,
makes me laugh before the game, which is good.
TSD: What songs are playing on the locker room's
iPod?
Quon: Well whose iPod is in the locker room?
TSD: Good question. Whose is in there?
Quon: Well really it's whoever gets there first. We
have a lot of country fans, so there's usually a lot
of country playing. Last week we had Michael
Jackson. Before games Emily [Oliver] usually
plays her iPod. "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore is
an up-and-coming one right now.
TSD: Okay, what's your go-to study spot?
Quon: I like studying in my room, but if not there,
then in the Alumni Cafe.
TSD:Best meal on campus?
Quon:Has to be Lake Lag Late Nite breakfast
burritos. Too bad I don't have Cardinal dollars
anymore!
TSD: Anything left for you to do here? What do
you want to accomplish before graduation in June?
Quon:Oh, I have a long bucket list. A lot people
are going to be like, "Are you kidding me." One, I
want to finish the season off right and by right I
mean, just do everything I can and have no
regrets. And then, a lot of people are going to
laugh at me for a lot of this, but I want to run cam
pus loop, walk the Dish, go steam tunneling, take
a class in the glass room in the front of Arrillaga,
I want to golf at the Stanford golf course. I want
to go see every sport on campus I've been to a
lot, but not some of the more obscure ones like
rowing. But I've been to squash...

As a member of Stanford women's soc
cer's class of 2013, Rachel Quon will
complete her collegiate careers as one
of the few athletes who has no idea
what it feels like to lose a conference
match.
In her four year's on the Farm, the three-time All-
Pac-12 honoree and 2010 All-American Quon and the
Cardinal have gone a perfect 40-0 in first Pac-10 and
then Phc-12 play After two seasons that ended in
defeat in the NCAA Championship match, Stanford
broke through last season with a 1-0 victory over
Duke to win the program's first national title.
The attacking outside back from Lake Forest, 111.
sat down with The Daily to take on all things
Stanford soccer.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How difficult is it to
focus on the N CAA Tournament being in the same
situation with a Pac-12 title in hand for the fourth
year in a row?
Rachel Quon (Quon): I think that Paul [Ratcliffe]
and all the rest of the coaches do a great job of
keeping us focused. In the beginning of the season
we have two main goals: win the Pac-12 and then
win the NCAA Championship. And I think espe
cially when we get into Pac-12 play we take it one
game at a time. Each game counts if you want to
win the Pac-12 and each game is always very
tough. You know that every conference game is
going to be a good one, so once we locked down Cal
[in the regular season finale] and were able to a
win there, our next mindset is the national champi
onship. Paul emphasizes one game at a time and I
think that's what we do and each week is a new
week and focusing on a new opponent.
TSD: To some extent, this is old hat for you. You're
the defending national champs with a strong sen
ior class: what's the team dynamic like?
Quon: I think that experience is definitely an
advantage for us and I hope it comes through dur
ing the tourney. And again we know each game is
going to be hard it's the playoffs so you have to
win or you're out. So having that experience, hav
ing a lot of players who've been in this situation in
the Final Four already is an advantage knowing
what to expect and the mindset we have to bring.
TSD: What kind of legacy do you hope to leave
when all is said and done? At this point, you have
to kind of be like, "Wow, this is close to being done,
there's five games left."
Quon: Six games, don't remind me.
TSD: [Laughs] Well what does it mean to do that,
not losing a single Pac-12 game in four years? Is
that at some point just staggering?

Quon: Well, yeah. I know our senior class wants to
make just a positive difference, and it's not just the
senior class, it's the whole team; and I think we
have a mindset of wanting to do it for each other
and for the people ahead of us who've made the
program what it is today and teaching the younger
ones what Stanford's all about.

TSD: I know you're very competitive. What is
