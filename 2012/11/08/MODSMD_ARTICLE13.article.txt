## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Voting does not fulfill civic duty 
### Adam Johnson 
On Election Day, I noticed
dozens of Facebook status
updates asking friends and
family to "go vote." From a purely
economic standpoint, these appeals
are almost worthless. There is a
small probability that one person's
impersonal directive will turn a non
voter into a voter. This probability
likely decreases the more competi
tive a state is voters from Ohio
are reminded to vote plenty and
therefore these appeals are least
likely to influence the voters who
matter the most.
Even if someone does vote
because of your Facebook status,
there is no guarantee that he will
vote for your preferred candidate
and, in most states, there is almost
no chance that his vote will sway the
election. I'll leave the calculations to
Nate Silver, but I would guess that
the expected economic value from
such a Facebook post is on the order
of fractions of a cent; something
more than economics must be lead
ing people to make these and similar
public declarations.
One explanation is that these
posts derive value from civic duty, or
the responsibilities we have as citi
zens. Elections, and the days leading
up to them, are generally high on
civic duty: thousands tune into
debates, oftentimes just to gain a
better understanding of certain
issues and policies; people from all
backgrounds volunteer to count bal
lots; and millions vote for president,
even though many voters have prac
tically no chance of shaping the
national election. As the Facebook
examples show, civic duty is also
something we expect of other citi
zens. As the title of a Haas Center
for Public Service webpage goes,
"Fhlfill Your Civic Duty and Register
to Vote."

Quite frankly, though, I regard
voting as one of the least meaningful
ways to abide by one's civic duty. Is a
voter who casts her ballot for
President Obama because he plays
basketball fulfilling her civic duty?
One could argue that she is in fact
shirking her civic duty and would
have been a more responsible citizen
by not voting at all. Although this is
obviously an extreme example, there
are countless statistics showing the
general ignorance of Americans, a
fact that is certainly not helped by
the polarization of news media.
America's "best and brightest"
are not perfect, either. How many
Stanford students knew the plat
forms of the third party candidates
listed on their ballots? I'm guessing
not many. We cannot all be experts,
but we can at least provide ourselves
with a basic understanding of the

candidates and the issues. We can
also seek out opportunities to debate
with those who hold different politi
cal perspectives; rather than label
these people, we should engage with
them. In short, civic duty is not
merely voting, but having an
informed vote.

Civic duty is also more than par
ticipating in our democracy every
two years; what we do in between
the elections is equally, if not more,
important. President Obama may
have stated this best when, in
Tuesday's victory speech, he said
that "the role of citizens in our
democracy does not end with your
vote. America's never been about
what can be done for us; it's about
what can be done by us together."
Civic duty then involves activities
like participating in public service or
advocacy, paying taxes, and devoting
oneself to better understanding
American government and culture.
Although voting may accord with
one's civic duty, in almost all cases it
does nothing to effect change at the
local, state, or national level. Voting
should therefore not be viewed as a
"fulfillment" of civic duty but rather
just one of many actions we as
responsible citizens should pursue.
In this vein, I would like to briefly
praise Michael Tubbs 'l2, who by all
measures seems to be fulfilling his
civic duty. I do not know him person
ally, but his resume suggests that he
could have found a prestigious job in
Washington after graduation.
Instead, he returned to his struggling
Central Valley hometown to run for
an unglamorous city-council seat. As
he explained in an interview in The
Stanford Dailylast year, "I like
making a difference for people, and
the best way to do that in Stockton
now, in my opinion, is through the
political system." Itibbs won his seat
decisively and I wish him the best of
luck in his future endeavors. He is
dedicating his life to the tenets of
civic duty and people like him should
be applauded.

Tubbs' efforts seem to make vot
ing pale in comparison. But we are
not all fit to run for city-council, nor
should we; many people such as
teachers, civil rights lawyers and
more devote their lives to being
responsible citizens in other ways.
We can also be responsible citizens
by contributing to our communities,
whether that means serving on the
PTA or collecting litter in parks. In
short, there are hundreds of ways
we can adhere to our civic duty. It is
time we recognize these.

Haw do you adhere to your civic duty ?
