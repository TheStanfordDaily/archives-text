# UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEMS OF OUR TIME
## A 						systems approach to environmentalism 
### Samrawit Tessema 
Yesterday I was accosted by a
well-meaning, unassuming
representative of an interna
tional environmental non-profit (he
was stationed right on University
Ave in case you want to avoid him).
He explained to me the impor
tance of the role of the individual
in stopping patterns of environ
mental degradation. I was touched
by the pathos of his pleas, and gen
uinely surprised at my own will
ingness to stop what I was doing to
listen.

He then asked me to fill out a
membership form. I subsequently
tried to explain why I couldn't afford
the membership at the moment.
He pointed to my conspicuous
cup of organic peppermint tea. "But
you can afford that?" He asks, rais
ing his colorless, pierced eyebrow.
I had nothing left to say.

After about 20 minutes of awk
ward, ethically-inclined banter, I
managed to walk away, having com
pleted the membership form, having
understood the great significance of
my monthly $l5 contribution to the
cause of saving the rain forests of the
world except give my credit card
information to this organization over
the phone.
I left, thoroughly ashamed. At the
risk of seeming vastly unoriginal,
perhaps I resented that young man
for forcing me to stop and really
think about the value of what I'm
doing right here, right now. I suppose
there comes a point when those who

are willing to take action do, and
those who like the idea of taking
action flop.
So was I a pretentious flip-Hopper
who only likes to engage in self
absorbed thoughts and discussions?
What separates me from the people
pounding the pavement collecting
signatures and new memberships?
Have I been morally compromised
by the looming shadow of the ivory
tower?
Finally, lodged within the confines
of my self-indulgent melodrama, I
realized I was being totally ridiculous
and self-absorbed.
What I have come to accept is
that in that moment, we both were
wrong. If every person in the world
became a member of this nonprofit
today, would we actually save the
rain forests of the world? Maybe, but
probably not. I'm guessing the issue
is a bit more complicated than that.
Certainly, the actions of individuals
can create positive change. However,
thinking about the actions of individ
uals as inputs into a system of insti
tutions and behavioral norms is com
paratively more interesting and
plausibly more impactful on a larger
scale.

In the past few weeks, I have
been working with a group called
Change Labs, which is located with
in the Mechanical Engineering Design
Group. The focus of Change Labs is
to develop new approaches for
achieving rapid, large-scale impact
on the world's most pressing chal

lenges. We conduct research, imple
ment initiatives and pilot theories
and frameworks that pertain to the
dynamics of rapid transformation.
Change Labs aims to create a
space for this sort of research within
the innovative and collaborative
atmosphere of Stanford and Silicon
Valley. We want to be able to think
about issues like protecting the rain
forests of the world, but we want to
do it from a holistic, systems-orient
ed perspective. The issues our world
faces have become increasingly
interconnected. The forces of global
ization and increased socio-political
interactions have created many new
comparative benefits in trade and
culture, but we have also inherited
new problems. As such, it is incum
bent upon the entire human family to
iterate new sets of tools that enable
us to think about and collectively
address these problems.
I'm thrilled to be a part of
Change Labs, and I certainly have a
lot to learn. I want to be intentional
about the actions I choose to take
and that doesn't include being lured
into paying $l5 per month to pas
sively save the trees. Instead, I'm
choosing to become more informed
about how various systems operate
and to act accordingly. I hope you
will follow me on this journey of
learning and doing as one pathway
to serving the world.
