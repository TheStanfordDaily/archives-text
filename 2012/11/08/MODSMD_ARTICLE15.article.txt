# I WANT TO GO TO THERE
## All the single ladies, and other Democrats 
### Annie Graham 
/ / "X "T"ow put your hands up, up
l\l in the club..." if you voted
-L. i against Mitt Romney
because of the frightfully conserva
tive ideals that have enveloped and
ultimately consumed the Republican
party, and spit out in its place some
monster party that generates
repeatedly ignorant statements on
women's health issues, immigration
reform and LGBT issues. Now let
me put an opinion on it.
Even though I have lady hor
mones that cause me to have lots of
feelings all the time, I'm well aware
that there is a broad range of politi
cal issues to consider, beyond said
social gripes. I agree with Nicholas
Kristof, who said in a recent column
that the phrase "war on women"
should be reserved for violent poli
cies of rape or rampant denial of
girls' education committed globally
against women.
However, Romney represented a
set of Republican ideals that threat
en the repeal of already-won rights
for women. He also championed an
immigration policy that would fur
ther separate families and deprive
undocumented youth of educational
opportunities (I admit Obama is far
from perfect in this regard). Finally,
Romney signed the National
Organization for Marriage's pledge
last year, promising to defend
DOMA and create a constitutional
amendment defining marriage as
between one man and one woman,
amongst other things. Michele

Bachmann and Rick Santorum were
also quick to sign that pledge.
Romney represented the refusal
to respect the changing face of the
nation.

Represented, past tense. And
now he has lost the election. Still,
the ideals he promoted as a tempo
rary figurehead live on in the
Republican Party.
There is certainly room and rea
son for difference between political
parties. But when that difference is
so alienating to large demographics
that they blatantly avoid your politi
cal party, it seems a matter of smart
politics to change.
The majority within the follow
ing groups quite clearly avoided vot
ing for a Republican president on
Tuesday: women favored Obama by
11 percentage points; more drasti
cally, single women favored Obama
by 36 percentage points; Latinos
favored Obama by 44 percentage
points; African-Americans favored
Obama by 87 percentage points.
Finally, those who identified as gay,
lesbian, or bisexual* favored Obama
by 54 percentage points.
Leading up to Election Day,
Republican Senator Lindsay
Graham mused about a potential
Romney loss, "If I hear anybody say
it was because Romney wasn't con
servative enough I'm going to go
nuts. We're not losing 95 percent of
African-Americans and two-thirds
of Hispanics and voters under 30
because we're not being hard-ass

enough."
Maybe both political parties
need some more real-talk sessions.
Some Republicans are more than
willing to call out forms of extrem
ism in their party. And that is impor
tant. I am not condemning an entire
political party, knowing that the
Democrats have their fail* share of
flaws. Listen, I even have a
Republican friend... wait, he said I
could use that word, is it still okay?
In all seriousness, politicians who
dedicate themselves to public serv
ice in both parties inspire me. My
family is comprised of Republicans
who have served their communities
to the best of their abilities.
Republicans are, you know, people:
mothers and brothers and sisters
and step-brothers-in-law and great
aunts and that-family-member-who

just-keeps-showing-up.
But my family is also made of the
type of Republicans that love me
and all of my gayness, believe in pro
choice politics, believe in reasonable
immigration reform. And that just
doesn't seem common on the nation
al Republican stage. Here's a less
than-bold statement: that is decid
edly not common on the national
Republican stage.
The election is over, and we will
move on to work together. That is
how the narrative goes, and that is
the narrative I want to believe. But
as of now, Republican politics are an
unwelcome place for the majority of
female, non-white, and queer peo
ple, according to the exit polls. And
here's the thing: they vote. In fact,
they just voted some guy into office
yesterday.

What will it take for more mod
erate voices to take hold in the
Republican Party, and respect the
demographic shifts of the nation?
That is, to recognize that we're here,
and this country is changing regard
less of whom is in charge.

ing groups quite clearly avoided vot
ing for a Republican president on
Tuesday: women favored Obama by
11 percentage points; more drasti
cally, single women favored Obama
by 36 percentage points; Latinos
favored Obama by 44 percentage
points; African-Americans favored
Obama by 87 percentage points.
Finally, those who identified as gay,
lesbian, or bisexual* favored Obama
by 54 percentage points.
Leading up to Election Day,
Republican Senator Lindsay
Graham mused about a potential
Romney loss, "If I hear anybody say
it was because Romney wasn't con
servative enough I'm going to go
nuts. We're not losing 95 percent of
African-Americans and two-thirds
of Hispanics and voters under 30
because we're not being hard-ass

enough."
Maybe both political parties
need some more real-talk sessions.
Some Republicans are more than
willing to call out forms of extrem
ism in their party. And that is impor
tant. I am not condemning an entire
political party, knowing that the
Democrats have their fail* share of
flaws. Listen, I even have a
Republican friend... wait, he said I
could use that word, is it still okay?
In all seriousness, politicians who
dedicate themselves to public serv
ice in both parties inspire me. My
family is comprised of Republicans
who have served their communities
to the best of their abilities.
Republicans are, you know, people:
mothers and brothers and sisters
and step-brothers-in-law and great
aunts and that-family-member-who

just-keeps-showing-up.
But my family is also made of the
type of Republicans that love me
and all of my gayness, believe in pro
choice politics, believe in reasonable
immigration reform. And that just
doesn't seem common on the nation
al Republican stage. Here's a less
than-bold statement: that is decid
edly not common on the national
Republican stage.
The election is over, and we will
move on to work together. That is
how the narrative goes, and that is
the narrative I want to believe. But
as of now, Republican politics are an
unwelcome place for the majority of
female, non-white, and queer peo
ple, according to the exit polls. And
here's the thing: they vote. In fact,
they just voted some guy into office
yesterday.

What will it take for more mod
erate voices to take hold in the
Republican Party, and respect the
demographic shifts of the nation?
That is, to recognize that we're here,
and this country is changing regard
less of whom is in charge.

/ / "X "T"ow put your hands up, up
l\l in the club..." if you voted
-L. i against Mitt Romney
because of the frightfully conserva
tive ideals that have enveloped and
ultimately consumed the Republican
party, and spit out in its place some
monster party that generates
repeatedly ignorant statements on
women's health issues, immigration
reform and LGBT issues. Now let
me put an opinion on it.
Even though I have lady hor
mones that cause me to have lots of
feelings all the time, I'm well aware
that there is a broad range of politi
cal issues to consider, beyond said
social gripes. I agree with Nicholas
Kristof, who said in a recent column
that the phrase "war on women"
should be reserved for violent poli
cies of rape or rampant denial of
girls' education committed globally
against women.
However, Romney represented a
set of Republican ideals that threat
en the repeal of already-won rights
for women. He also championed an
immigration policy that would fur
ther separate families and deprive
undocumented youth of educational
opportunities (I admit Obama is far
from perfect in this regard). Finally,
Romney signed the National
Organization for Marriage's pledge
last year, promising to defend
DOMA and create a constitutional
amendment defining marriage as
between one man and one woman,
amongst other things. Michele

Bachmann and Rick Santorum were
also quick to sign that pledge.
Romney represented the refusal
to respect the changing face of the
nation.

Represented, past tense. And
now he has lost the election. Still,
the ideals he promoted as a tempo
rary figurehead live on in the
Republican Party.
There is certainly room and rea
son for difference between political
parties. But when that difference is
so alienating to large demographics
that they blatantly avoid your politi
cal party, it seems a matter of smart
politics to change.
