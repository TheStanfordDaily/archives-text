# The 						Lorenz Eitner Lecture on Classical Art and Culture
## THE 						EMBODIED THEATER COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA 
### Dr. PETER MET NECK 
In this illustrated talk incorporating live demon
strations. Peter Meineck will suggest a new method
for approaching ancient drama using research drawn
from the cognitive sciences. Can ncnroscicntific
studies and modern cognitive theories be applied to
the ancient Athenian brain? Can recent advances
from the affective sciences offer us an array ot new
tools tor better understanding the experience of an
cient performance? This talk will suggest that the
dramatic mask operating in a muitisensory dynamic
environment provided a dccplv personal emotional
anchor to music, narrative and movement of ancient
drama and that new research in face recognition,
neuroaesthetics, eye-tracking, human propriocep
tion and sensory processing can indeed illuminate
important aspects ot the ancient world.
