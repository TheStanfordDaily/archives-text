# STUDENT LIFE
## House staff application rules change Students can now apply for multiple staffing positions 
### JANA PERSKY 
For the first time ever, students
applying for 2013-2014 Residential
Education (ResEd) house staff posi
tions will be able to simultaneously sub
mit applications across a broader range
of positions, according to Associate
Dean of ResEd Jennifer Calvert.

Previously, potential staffers had to
choose between one of four application
tracks: Peer Health Educator (PHE),
Resident Computer Consultant (RCC),
Resident Tutor (RT), Resident
Assistant (RA) or the House Manager
or Theme House staff track. Students
were only able to cross-apply within the
final track. For 2013-14, applicants can
apply to any combination of jobs exclud
ing Thtor positions.

This year's application will be
released on Dec 3. The application for
PHE, RA, RCC, House Manager and
Theme House positions will be due on
Jan. 17. Applications for tutoring staff
will be due on Jan 28.

"In the old system, choice gets
forced without good information,"
Calvert said. "You might hedge your
bets and decide you want to be X posi
tion because you have a greater likeli
hood of getting it. We want to put the
right people in the right places."

It remains to be seen how these
changes will affect the number of candi
dates for staff positions. Both Calvert
and Peer Health Education Coordinator
Colin Campbell 'll said they expect that
there will be an increase in the number
of PHE applications.

"Before the application process even
started in past years, prospective PHEs
and prospective RAs would have to
choose which path they wanted to
apply," Campbell said. "The idea is that
[the new application] will increase our
numbers because so many people con
tacted me in the process saying 'I really
want to be a PHE, but I might want to
be an RA, Is there any way I can do
both?' This is the first year you can
apply to be an RA in Twain and a PHE
in Cedro and an RCC in West
Lagunita."

Current Serra PHE Nathan Polanco
'l4 expressed similar thoughts.
"I don't know if [the new system]
would make it more competitive, but I
think that it's a better way to do it,"
Polanco said. "There's a lot of people
who try out to be an RA, but then they
end up not actually getting the position,
