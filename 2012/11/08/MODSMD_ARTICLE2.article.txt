# STUDENT LIFE
## House staff application rules change Students can now apply for multiple staffing positions 
### JANA PERSKY 
For the first time ever, students
applying for 2013-2014 Residential
Education (ResEd) house staff posi
tions will be able to simultaneously sub
mit applications across a broader range
of positions, according to Associate
Dean of ResEd Jennifer Calvert.

Previously, potential staffers had to
choose between one of four application
tracks: Peer Health Educator (PHE),
Resident Computer Consultant (RCC),
Resident Tutor (RT), Resident
Assistant (RA) or the House Manager
or Theme House staff track. Students
were only able to cross-apply within the
final track. For 2013-14, applicants can
apply to any combination of jobs exclud
ing Thtor positions.

This year's application will be
released on Dec 3. The application for
PHE, RA, RCC, House Manager and
Theme House positions will be due on
Jan. 17. Applications for tutoring staff
will be due on Jan 28.

"In the old system, choice gets
forced without good information,"
Calvert said. "You might hedge your
bets and decide you want to be X posi
tion because you have a greater likeli
hood of getting it. We want to put the
right people in the right places."

It remains to be seen how these
changes will affect the number of candi
dates for staff positions. Both Calvert
and Peer Health Education Coordinator
Colin Campbell 'll said they expect that
there will be an increase in the number
of PHE applications.

"Before the application process even
started in past years, prospective PHEs
and prospective RAs would have to
choose which path they wanted to
apply," Campbell said. "The idea is that
[the new application] will increase our
numbers because so many people con
tacted me in the process saying 'I really
want to be a PHE, but I might want to
be an RA, Is there any way I can do
both?' This is the first year you can
apply to be an RA in Twain and a PHE
in Cedro and an RCC in West
Lagunita."

Current Serra PHE Nathan Polanco
'l4 expressed similar thoughts.
"I don't know if [the new system]
would make it more competitive, but I
think that it's a better way to do it,"
Polanco said. "There's a lot of people
who try out to be an RA, but then they
end up not actually getting the position,
so if they still wanted to be a
staff member, they could be a
PHE or something else."

Polanco said that the new
system would not have affect
ed his own application process
because he was only interest
ed in the PHE position.
Over the past several
years, the number of RA
applications has steadily
increased. For the current
school year, ResEd received
429 applications, up from 329
for 2011-2012 and 307 for
2010-2011.

According to Calvert and
Campbell, approximately 30
PHEs, 180 RAs, 44 Theme

House Staff and 200 House
Managers are hired each year.
They expect those numbers to
remain consistent next year.

Also different in the hous
ing staff application process
this year is Res Ed's new
application software system.
"For a student's experi
ence, I think the new plat
form will feel less 1982 and
more 2012, which is great,"
Calvert said. "The biggest
functionality difference that
applicants and houses will
experience is that the way
that you set up interviews is
much more fluid."

According to Calvert, the
platform automates emails to
applicants so they no longer
have to log in to the ResEd
website to find out hiring
decisions.

Campbell said that he

hopes the new system will
also lead to a better overall
result of the staff hiring
process.

"In some ways, on the
administrative side, we are
making this a little more diffi
cult," Campbell said. "But we
have students who are apply
ing to these staff positions
that take up a lot of time and
are a huge part of your
Stanford experience, so we
give them more options and it
will hopefully lead to overall
satisfaction."
The Residential Education
Convention job fair for
prospective staffers will take
place on the first week of win
ter quarter, according to
Res Ed's website.

or Theme House staff track. Students
were only able to cross-apply within the
final track. For 2013-14, applicants can
apply to any combination of jobs exclud
ing Thtor positions.

This year's application will be
released on Dec 3. The application for
PHE, RA, RCC, House Manager and
Theme House positions will be due on
Jan. 17. Applications for tutoring staff
will be due on Jan 28.

"In the old system, choice gets
forced without good information,"
Calvert said. "You might hedge your
bets and decide you want to be X posi
tion because you have a greater likeli
hood of getting it. We want to put the
right people in the right places."

It remains to be seen how these
changes will affect the number of candi
dates for staff positions. Both Calvert
and Peer Health Education Coordinator
Colin Campbell 'll said they expect that
there will be an increase in the number
of PHE applications.

"Before the application process even
started in past years, prospective PHEs
and prospective RAs would have to
choose which path they wanted to
apply," Campbell said. "The idea is that
[the new application] will increase our
numbers because so many people con
tacted me in the process saying 'I really
want to be a PHE, but I might want to
be an RA, Is there any way I can do
both?' This is the first year you can
apply to be an RA in Twain and a PHE
in Cedro and an RCC in West
Lagunita."

Current Serra PHE Nathan Polanco
'l4 expressed similar thoughts.
"I don't know if [the new system]
would make it more competitive, but I
think that it's a better way to do it,"
Polanco said. "There's a lot of people
who try out to be an RA, but then they
end up not actually getting the position,
so if they still wanted to be a
staff member, they could be a
PHE or something else."

Polanco said that the new
system would not have affect
ed his own application process
because he was only interest
ed in the PHE position.
Over the past several
years, the number of RA
applications has steadily
increased. For the current
school year, ResEd received
429 applications, up from 329
for 2011-2012 and 307 for
2010-2011.

According to Calvert and
Campbell, approximately 30
PHEs, 180 RAs, 44 Theme

House Staff and 200 House
Managers are hired each year.
They expect those numbers to
remain consistent next year.

Also different in the hous
ing staff application process
this year is Res Ed's new
application software system.
"For a student's experi
ence, I think the new plat
form will feel less 1982 and
more 2012, which is great,"
Calvert said. "The biggest
functionality difference that
applicants and houses will
experience is that the way
that you set up interviews is
much more fluid."

According to Calvert, the
platform automates emails to
applicants so they no longer
have to log in to the ResEd
website to find out hiring
decisions.

Campbell said that he

hopes the new system will
also lead to a better overall
result of the staff hiring
process.

"In some ways, on the
administrative side, we are
making this a little more diffi
cult," Campbell said. "But we
have students who are apply
ing to these staff positions
that take up a lot of time and
are a huge part of your
Stanford experience, so we
give them more options and it
will hopefully lead to overall
satisfaction."
The Residential Education
Convention job fair for
prospective staffers will take
place on the first week of win
ter quarter, according to
Res Ed's website.
