# A
						night at The Bridge
## Live-in student counselors provide support to callers around the clock 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
It's 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. Half a block
down, on Mayfield Avenue, the music at Sigma
Chi is dying down, but at Rogers House, home of
The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, the party's
just getting started.

Maria Mateen 'l3, who has been a Bridge
counselor for three years, sings softly as she
rolls cookie dough in sugar her fourth or fifth
batch of the night. Strewn on the counter behind
her are baking materials, dirty dishes, a laptop
and a dozen bottles of spices and condiments.
Altogether, the look is not one of a typical coun
seling clinic: that's because The Bridge is also
home to four student "live-ins" who man the 24-
hour phone counseling service.
Mateen, the self-professed "mom of the
house," is the resident night owl.
"Can you help me find the cinnamon?" she
asks me, hopping from the stove to the oven to
back to the counter.

By 2:30 a.m., things begin to settle down.

Most of the lights are off (Maria is still baking)
and finally some calm is descending on The
Bridge.

Not for long. The phone rings, and I hear the
sound of shoes on stairs comes from the second
floor. The house blinks back to life.
Live-in counselor Emma Pierson 'l3 is on call
tonight. Wrapped in a blanket in a small side
room, she takes the call. It's a serious one a
housing staff member calling on behalf of a resi
dent, possibly one considering suicide. The door
closes to give the caller confidentiality.
Meanwhile, Mateen's head pops out from the
kitchen doorway. "Want a cookie?" she asks.
For Mateen and Pierson, it's just another day
at The Bridge. They live at the center, their beds
above the counseling center's two main rooms
for walk-in and phone counsels.
"We get mostly phone calls," Pierson said.
"It's more convenient and more personal than
having to come in and sit down."
Normally there are more than a dozen
trained peer counselors, manning the phones in
the front room and counseling students in per

son. For calls that come in between midnight and
9 a.m., however, it's up to the live-ins to face
whatever problems arise.

"When the phone rings and you're on call, I
don't think about getting to the phone, but I'm
there," Pierson said, comparing her thought
process to the Pavlovian experiments that condi
tioned dogs so they would behave a certain way
on command. "It's probably not healthy."
Even Pierson, a veteran of several dozen
counseling calls, has trouble describing exactly
what it's like to counsel someone in the middle of
the night.

"Talking to someone in the middle of the
night when you're just coming out of sleep is a
pretty surreal experience," she said. "It's just
you and this stranger, and they're just confiding
their intimate secrets to you. I feel very privi
leged, but it's almost like being in a dream."
It's a dream that sometimes gives the coun
selors demons of their own. Providing round
the-clock emotional support for everybody who

Four student counselors currently live in The Bridge Peer Counseling Center to provide 24/7 assistance. The most common subject of calls
to counselors is relationships, followed by stress/anxiety, academics, gender/sexuality, family, depression, suicide and substance abuse.
