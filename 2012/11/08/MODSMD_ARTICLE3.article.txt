# A 						night at The Bridge
## Live-in student counselors provide support to callers around the clock 
### EDWARD NGAI DESK EDITOR 
It's 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. Half a block
down, on Mayfield Avenue, the music at Sigma
Chi is dying down, but at Rogers House, home of
The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, the party's
just getting started.

Maria Mateen 'l3, who has been a Bridge
counselor for three years, sings softly as she
rolls cookie dough in sugar her fourth or fifth
batch of the night. Strewn on the counter behind
her are baking materials, dirty dishes, a laptop
and a dozen bottles of spices and condiments.
Altogether, the look is not one of a typical coun
seling clinic: that's because The Bridge is also
home to four student "live-ins" who man the 24-
hour phone counseling service.
Mateen, the self-professed "mom of the
house," is the resident night owl.
"Can you help me find the cinnamon?" she
asks me, hopping from the stove to the oven to
back to the counter.

By 2:30 a.m., things begin to settle down.

Most of the lights are off (Maria is still baking)
and finally some calm is descending on The
Bridge.

Not for long. The phone rings, and I hear the
sound of shoes on stairs comes from the second
floor. The house blinks back to life.
Live-in counselor Emma Pierson 'l3 is on call
tonight. Wrapped in a blanket in a small side
room, she takes the call. It's a serious one a
housing staff member calling on behalf of a resi
dent, possibly one considering suicide. The door
closes to give the caller confidentiality.
Meanwhile, Mateen's head pops out from the
kitchen doorway. "Want a cookie?" she asks.
For Mateen and Pierson, it's just another day
at The Bridge. They live at the center, their beds
above the counseling center's two main rooms
for walk-in and phone counsels.
"We get mostly phone calls," Pierson said.
"It's more convenient and more personal than
having to come in and sit down."
Normally there are more than a dozen
trained peer counselors, manning the phones in
the front room and counseling students in per

son. For calls that come in between midnight and
9 a.m., however, it's up to the live-ins to face
whatever problems arise.

"When the phone rings and you're on call, I
don't think about getting to the phone, but I'm
there," Pierson said, comparing her thought
process to the Pavlovian experiments that condi
tioned dogs so they would behave a certain way
on command. "It's probably not healthy."
Even Pierson, a veteran of several dozen
counseling calls, has trouble describing exactly
what it's like to counsel someone in the middle of
the night.

"Talking to someone in the middle of the
night when you're just coming out of sleep is a
pretty surreal experience," she said. "It's just
you and this stranger, and they're just confiding
their intimate secrets to you. I feel very privi
leged, but it's almost like being in a dream."
It's a dream that sometimes gives the coun
selors demons of their own. Providing round
the-clock emotional support for everybody who

has their number The
Bridge has received calls
from as far away as the East
Coast can stress coun
selors out too. They're coun
seling mostly focuses on rela
tionships and stress, but also
about body image, sexuality
and, occasionally, suicide.

"Some counselors will
hang up [after a call] and cry,"
Mateen said. "They've been
there for the counselee, and
when they hang up, they need
to cry."
It's tough at times, but
over the years, The Bridge
has developed an internal
support system of its own.
"The reason why you can
support everyone is because
everyone [at The Bridge]
supports you," Mateen said.
"It's never a drain on me
because I have this amazing
support system... I never feel
I'm fighting the battle alone."
For day counselors like
Alexandria Price 'l4, that
support system starts and
ends with the live-ins.

"[Supporting day coun
selors] is something [the live
ins are] there for and really
great at, especially if you've
had a really tough call," she
said. "Anything you want,
they'll talk to you about
the call, reassure you, even
counsel you."
This week, Price was
stuck with the midnight shift:
Friday from 9 p.m. to mid
night. While most students
would lament the loss of half a

weekend night, she empha
sized how remarkable it is to
work at The Bridge.
"With just three hours a
week of time you can feel like
'I really helped someone
there,'" she said. "That's a
pretty amazing thing as a
peer counselor, to have that
kind of impact, to get some
one the help they need."
Most of the time, that help
isn't at The Bridge.
Counselors don't tell people
how to solve their problems,
oftentimes just talking through
issues and listening. More seri
ous problems are referred to
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), where stu
dents can get medical help.
"I'm supremely unquali
fied to tell people what psy
chologically to do," Pierson
said. "It's a collaborative
process."

While they may not be
doctors, Pierson and Mateen
have unique opportunities to
diagnose what troubles
Stanford students, as they
themselves experience the
private insecurities and fail
ures of a student body facing
incredible pressures to suc
ceed.

"It's a part of the person
ality that we cultivate here,
your Stanford personality,"
Mateen said. "We're always
trying to perform the best we
can, climb mountains, cure
cancer. We're so focused on
our own successes and fail
ures, it drives us apart."
According to Pierson, this
pressure might not only come
from high-achieving peers,
but from an internal drive as
well.
"The kind of drive you

need to get to a place like
here does not always make
you the most psychologically
healthy person," she said.
'Almost always, the person
you're talking to is in pain, in
some way."
Sometimes, that pain
leaves a mark on even the
most experienced counselors,
but The Bridge family has a
way of propping each other
up.

"There have been times
when all four of the live-ins
have been overwhelmed,"
Pierson said. "When that's
true, you're like, 'I can't take
another call, can you take my
call?' It's a web [of support]."

For the counselors at The
Bridge, it's all about expand
ing that web of support out of
the house and making sure
that no one feels alone in their
struggles.

"The mission of The
Bridge is to show people that
you may be stressed, or sad,
or broken, but you're okay,"
Mateen said.
As the clock ticks towards
3 a.m., Mateen takes her final
batch of cookies out of the
oven. They're burnt and the
bottoms stick to the sheet as
she tries to scrape them onto
a plate.
"It's breaking," I say as a
cookie crumbles and splits
onto the counter, the rest of it
still stubbornly attached to
the metal.

Mateen picks up the shard
of sugar cookie and pops it in
her mouth.

"It's broken, but they're
still good."

It's 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. Half a block
down, on Mayfield Avenue, the music at Sigma
Chi is dying down, but at Rogers House, home of
The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, the party's
just getting started.

Maria Mateen 'l3, who has been a Bridge
counselor for three years, sings softly as she
rolls cookie dough in sugar her fourth or fifth
batch of the night. Strewn on the counter behind
her are baking materials, dirty dishes, a laptop
and a dozen bottles of spices and condiments.
Altogether, the look is not one of a typical coun
seling clinic: that's because The Bridge is also
home to four student "live-ins" who man the 24-
hour phone counseling service.
Mateen, the self-professed "mom of the
house," is the resident night owl.
"Can you help me find the cinnamon?" she
asks me, hopping from the stove to the oven to
back to the counter.

By 2:30 a.m., things begin to settle down.

Most of the lights are off (Maria is still baking)
and finally some calm is descending on The
Bridge.

Not for long. The phone rings, and I hear the
sound of shoes on stairs comes from the second
floor. The house blinks back to life.
Live-in counselor Emma Pierson 'l3 is on call
tonight. Wrapped in a blanket in a small side
room, she takes the call. It's a serious one a
housing staff member calling on behalf of a resi
dent, possibly one considering suicide. The door
closes to give the caller confidentiality.
Meanwhile, Mateen's head pops out from the
kitchen doorway. "Want a cookie?" she asks.
For Mateen and Pierson, it's just another day
at The Bridge. They live at the center, their beds
above the counseling center's two main rooms
for walk-in and phone counsels.
"We get mostly phone calls," Pierson said.
"It's more convenient and more personal than
having to come in and sit down."
Normally there are more than a dozen
trained peer counselors, manning the phones in
the front room and counseling students in per

son. For calls that come in between midnight and
9 a.m., however, it's up to the live-ins to face
whatever problems arise.

"When the phone rings and you're on call, I
don't think about getting to the phone, but I'm
there," Pierson said, comparing her thought
process to the Pavlovian experiments that condi
tioned dogs so they would behave a certain way
on command. "It's probably not healthy."
Even Pierson, a veteran of several dozen
counseling calls, has trouble describing exactly
what it's like to counsel someone in the middle of
the night.

"Talking to someone in the middle of the
night when you're just coming out of sleep is a
pretty surreal experience," she said. "It's just
you and this stranger, and they're just confiding
their intimate secrets to you. I feel very privi
leged, but it's almost like being in a dream."

selors demons of their own. Providing round

Bridge has received calls
from as far away as the East
Coast can stress coun
selors out too. They're coun

tionships and stress, but also
about body image, sexuality
and, occasionally, suicide.

"Some counselors will
hang up [after a call] and cry,"
Mateen said. "They've been
there for the counselee, and
when they hang up, they need
to cry."
It's tough at times, but
over the years, The Bridge
has developed an internal
support system of its own.
"The reason why you can
support everyone is because
everyone [at The Bridge]
supports you," Mateen said.
"It's never a drain on me
because I have this amazing
support system... I never feel
I'm fighting the battle alone."
For day counselors like
Alexandria Price 'l4, that
support system starts and
ends with the live-ins.

"[Supporting day coun
selors] is something [the live
ins are] there for and really
great at, especially if you've
had a really tough call," she
said. "Anything you want,
they'll talk to you about
the call, reassure you, even
counsel you."
This week, Price was
stuck with the midnight shift:
Friday from 9 p.m. to mid
night. While most students
would lament the loss of half a

weekend night, she empha
sized how remarkable it is to
work at The Bridge.
"With just three hours a
week of time you can feel like
'I really helped someone
there,'" she said. "That's a
pretty amazing thing as a
peer counselor, to have that
kind of impact, to get some
one the help they need."
Most of the time, that help
isn't at The Bridge.
Counselors don't tell people
how to solve their problems,
oftentimes just talking through
issues and listening. More seri
ous problems are referred to
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), where stu
dents can get medical help.
"I'm supremely unquali
fied to tell people what psy
chologically to do," Pierson
said. "It's a collaborative
process."

While they may not be
doctors, Pierson and Mateen
have unique opportunities to

Stanford students, as they
themselves experience the
private insecurities and fail
ures of a student body facing
incredible pressures to suc
ceed.

"It's a part of the person
ality that we cultivate here,
your Stanford personality,"
Mateen said. "We're always
trying to perform the best we
can, climb mountains, cure
cancer. We're so focused on
our own successes and fail
ures, it drives us apart."
According to Pierson, this
pressure might not only come
from high-achieving peers,
but from an internal drive as
well.
"The kind of drive you

need to get to a place like
here does not always make
you the most psychologically
healthy person," she said.
'Almost always, the person
you're talking to is in pain, in
some way."
Sometimes, that pain
leaves a mark on even the
most experienced counselors,
but The Bridge family has a
way of propping each other
up.

"There have been times
when all four of the live-ins
have been overwhelmed,"
Pierson said. "When that's
true, you're like, 'I can't take
another call, can you take my
call?' It's a web [of support]."

For the counselors at The
Bridge, it's all about expand
ing that web of support out of
the house and making sure
that no one feels alone in their
struggles.

"The mission of The
Bridge is to show people that
you may be stressed, or sad,
or broken, but you're okay,"
Mateen said.
As the clock ticks towards
3 a.m., Mateen takes her final
batch of cookies out of the
oven. They're burnt and the
bottoms stick to the sheet as
she tries to scrape them onto
a plate.
"It's breaking," I say as a
cookie crumbles and splits
onto the counter, the rest of it
still stubbornly attached to
the metal.
