## British PM advisor seeks to improve government 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"When you try and make change happen,
that's not easy," conceded Steve Hilton, currently
on sabbatical from his position as senior advisor
for British Prime Minister David Cameron.
"There are vested interests, people have different
views."

Hilton, whose formidable reputation in British
politics stems largely from his leading role in the
rise of Cameron to the leadership of the
Conservative Party and eventually the U.K., is

certainly no stranger to implementing dramatic
change. Under his guidance, Cameron's govern
ing coalition rapidly implemented austerity meas
ures while moving to promote a "Big Society"
concept based on embracing people power.
"It may turn out that today was the day when
the coalition's radical heart stopped beating," The
Economist wrote in March, referring to the
announcement that Hilton would take a year's
sabbatical in California.

Hilton, who currently serves as a visiting fel
low at the Hoover Institution and a visiting schol
ar at the Freeman Spogli Institute for

International Studies, framed the decision to
move across the Atlantic as personal rather than
professional, in order to accommodate his wife
Rachel Whetstone, a senior executive at Google.
"Stanford was naturally the first place to look
in terms of doing something that was both inter
esting and useful, and that would help me use my
skills and allow me to contribute to the communi
ty here," Hilton said. "I'm absolutely loving being
here at Stanford. What's really striking is the
sense of openness, the energy, the entrepreneur-
ial spirit."
While the Hilton family
lived briefly in California
before Cameron was elected,
Hilton insisted that the pres
sures of being in government
would prevent him from effec
tively advising Cameron from
afar, instead requiring a clean
break.
"It wasn't really remotely
feasible for me to try and do
my job from here, which is
why I took a sabbatical,"
Hilton said.
At Stanford, Hilton cur
rently teaches a class, Public
Policy 235, that looks at inno
vation in government, guiding
students in developing solu
tions to real-world issues and
turning them into policy.
"I'm trying to complement
students' academic grounding
with a more practical under
standing of how things really
work," Hilton said. "That's the
basic theme of the course
how to make change happen."
Hilton's involvement in the
class is certainly appropriate,
considering his repeated
clashes with a British civil
service bureaucracy and his
reputation for "blue sky think
ing," but he framed his aca
demic work as one focused on
allowing students to channel
then- energy toward an issue.
"What I see in my students
is what motivates me and
many other people who work
in government or public policy,
which is a real desire to make
the world a better place,"
Hilton said. "[The class] has
been incredibly useful for me
in seeing some of the mistakes
we might have made [and]
how to do things better in the
future."
Hilton first formed a close
friendship with Cameron in
the early 19905, while both
recent Oxford University grad

uates were working at the
Conservative Party Central
Office, though he described
their relationship in office as
"totally professional."
"When you're in govern
ment you have to focus on the
mission you're trying to
accomplish, the ideas you're
trying to turn into real
change," Hilton said.

Hilton's affiliation with
Conservative causes has been
both informal and formal in a
career that encompassed
stints in advertising, market
ing and business consulting.
He framed his diverse work
experience as beneficial for his
political endeavors, noting the
connection between policies
themselves and their effective
marketing.

"You need one to achieve
the other," Hilton said. "The
thing that drives you forward
is [the ability] to change
something, to make the world
a better place. You can't do
that if you're not in govern
ment. Being in government
requires winning elections.
Winning elections requires
you to persuade people to vote
for you."

The concept of greater
popular involvement in gov
ernment is a particular inter
est of Hilton's, and also, given
the recent domination of the
American political system by
corporate influence, a poten
tial area of concern.

'A lot of people do feel
excluded from the political
process [in the U.S.]," Hilton
said. "Political parties don't
necessarily represent the
combination of views that they
[nominally] hold."
For Hilton, the manner in
which politics has lagged
behind other sectors in incor
porating technology is both
inexcusable and an issue that
should prompt bipartisan con
cern.

"It's definitely apolitical,"
Hilton said. "I think people on
the left and the right would
agree that it's a good thing for

people to have more power
and control of their lives, and I
think left and right would
agree that it's a good thing if
people are more involved in
politics."
At least part of the solution
may, however, come from
third-party organizations such
as Social Teeth, a political
crowd-funding site founded by
Elaine Chang 'lO. Hilton
advises Social Teeth, which he
described as "Kickstarter for
political advertising."
"It's away of putting polit
ical ads in people's hands so
that it's not just billionaires
and super PACs dominating
the airwaves," Hilton said. "I
think that is a great example
of how technology can make a
difference in politics."
"There are a whole range
of issues that the government
involves itself in that we really
have the ability to rethink,"
Hilton added, noting that his
experiences at Stanford have
made him more optimistic
about society's ability to do so.
"It's not just about politics."
Hilton, who said he has no
set date for when he might
return to the U.K., said he
hopes his time at Stanford
helps to encourage students
to challenge existing issues
with new solutions. He
described his focus as encom
passing issues both narrow,
such as a winter quarter
course he will teach at the
Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design on Bay Area poverty,
and broad, like planned
research on the "post-bureau
cratic age."
"What we mean by that is
how can we rethink the way
government works, the way
public services are delivered,
taking account of the latest
thinking in business and tech
nology [and] moving away
from the twentieth century top
down bureaucratic model,"
Hilton said.
