## Stanford Libraries acquires Bahá'í collection 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Natasha Weaser 
Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has estab
lished the first academic, university-based Baha'i
collection in the U.S. after acquiring one of the most
extensive collections on the Baha'i faith in private
hands.
The renowned collection, composed of over 1000
letters, books and pictures among other material,
was donated by Arden Lee. SUL has also estab
lished the Jack H. Lee and Arden T. Lee Fund for
Baha'i Studies to fund continual growth of the
archive.
The new addition is pari, of a growing group of
library collections focusing on world religions.
"It became particularly apparent to me recently
that we are building a deep range of collections with
religious foci," Andrew Herkovic, SUL director of
communications and development, wrote in the
Stanford University Libraries October Newsletter.
Arden Lee has been a follower of the Baha'i
faith since 1952 and an ardent collector of Baha'i
items. She established the collection and fund in
honor of her late husband, Jack Lee.
"The addition of this collection is a great founda
tion for a collection to provide resources for our
researchers. The endowment being set up will
assure that the collection continues to grow as more
research needs develop," said John Eilts, the cura
tor for the libraries' Islamic and Middle Eastern
collection, in an interview with the Stanford News
Service.
The Baha'i religion, founded in Persia in the

mid-nineteenth century, is the world's youngest
monotheistic religion with over 5 million followers
worldwide.
"The recognition of religious minorities and the
preservation of their ongoing history will enrich
those who access this important history. I commend
the Stanford University Libraries on its work to
build a lasting collection of Baha'i materials in our
community," said newly re-elected U.S.
Representative for California 18th Congressional
District Anna Eshoo, co-chair of the congressional
Caucus on Religious Minorities in the Middle East,
in an interview with the Stanford News Service.

at Stanford on Oct. 8, 1912 — the only time in
Stanford history that classes were cancelled so stu
