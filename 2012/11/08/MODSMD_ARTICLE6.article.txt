### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Natasha Weaser 
The Stanford Criminal Justice Center (SCJC)
has been awarded a number of grants totaling
$650,000 to fund research on California's Public
Safety Realignment Legislation, which transfers
revenue and responsibilities from state to local gov
ernments. According to SCJC Director Robert
Weisberg, the Center hopes to help the state "get
Realignment right."
The 2011 Public Safety
Realignment legislation,
implemented on Oct. 1, pro
vided $6.3 billion to local gov
ernments and transferred
authority for non-violent
felons from the state prison
and parole system to local
counties in an effort to reduce
the chronic overcrowding in
the California prison system.
The SCJC will use the
giants to fund research on the
effects of the Realignment.
Researchers expect to share
findings by late summer 2013
or fall 2013 with key policymak
ers including the Board of State
and Community Corrections,
the California State
Legislature, the California
Attorney General and the
Office of the Governor.
"For too long, the state's
prison system has been a
revolving door for lower-level
offenders and parole violators
who are released within
months often before they
are even transferred out of a
reception center," Governor
Jerry Brown said in a 2011
press release upon signing the
Realignment legislation.
"Cycling these offenders
through state prisons wastes
money, aggravates crowded
conditions, thwarts rehabilita
tion, and impedes local law
enforcement supervision."
Four research projects will
be directly funded by the new
grants: an analysis of all 58
counties' approaches to realign
ment, case studies of specific
counties, a statewide judges
and prosecutors discretion
study and a study of front-end
effects and best practices.
"Through our research, we
want the data to tell us exactly
what the effects are of shifting
responsibility and discretion
from the state to the county—
how that impacts rates of incar
ceration versus probation
supervision versus community
programs, and so on," said
Robert Weisberg, professor of
Law and faculty co-director of
the SCJC, in an interview with
the Stanford Law School news
service.
The new grants were award
ed by the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office of Justice
Programs, National Institute
of Justice, James Irvine
Foundation and Public
Welfare Foundation.
Stanford Law School affil
iates also authored
Proposition 36, a ballot initia
tive which passed on Thesday.
The proposition amended
California's three-strikes law
and is projected to decrease
prison overcrowding.
