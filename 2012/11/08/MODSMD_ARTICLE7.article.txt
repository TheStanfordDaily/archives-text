## GSC starts initial ARP discussions 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members began discussions on the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
Stanford's judicial procedure for cases
involving sexual assault, stalking and rela
tionship violence, at their Nov. 7 meeting.
GSC co-chair Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3
said that the goal is for the GSC,
Undergraduate Senate and Faculty
Senate to approve the ARP by the end of
the academic year. Co-chair David Hsu, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering,
added that he does not think the GSC will
make a decision until the end of winter
quarter.
"I think it's going to take a while," Hsu
said. "It's been going on for so many
years. We haven't even started discussing
the procedural yet."
Until both the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate pass bills regard
ing the ARIJ the Faculty Senate will not
take action. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) will also have to approve
any changes suggested by the GSC or
Undergraduate Senate.
GSC members listened to a presenta
tion about the ARP by Judicial Officer
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, Associate Dean
and OCS Director Koren Bakkegard, and
Senior University Counsel Lauren
Schoenthaler. Several GSC members
asked questions regarding the format of

sexual assault hearings, how cases are
investigated and what role the GSC will
play in determining the future of the ARE
Although some GSC members sug
gested that the Undergraduate Senate
and GSC submit a joint proposal to the
Board of Judicial Affairs, others doubted
whether the 30 representatives from the
two legislative bodies would be able to
reach a consensus.
'A thirty-person conversation is not as
useful as you might imagine," Shaw said.
"It's possible that a better solution would
be a sub-committee of people interested in
the topic and willing to put in the time."
ASSU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 sug
gested creating several sub-committees to
present different options regarding the
ARE He said last year's Undergraduate
Senate was unable to reach a consensus
on the ARE because of the format of their
discussions.
"Fifteen people talking about the same
issue didn't work at all," Bindra said. "It
was a massive amount of opinions contra
dicting each other."
Regardless of whether or not the GSC
decides to create separate sub-commit
tees or submit a joint proposal with the
Undergraduate Senate, Hogan encour
aged GSC members to review the Board
of Judicial Affairs' meeting minutes from
winter quarter 2011 with regard to the
ARP before making a deci
sion.

"They had a lot of really
thoughtful conversations,"
Hogan said. "Reading the min
utes would provide some back
ground for why they made the
decisions they made."

GSC members said that
they would also like to get
more feedback from students
before submitting their pro
posal. Voting member-at-large
Hrishi Goel M.S. 'l3 said he
believes the town hall meet
ings about the ARP were not
very productive because many
students who were interested
in attending struggled to fit
the meeting into their sched
ules.

"Given that most of our
students are online most of the
time, if there is something we
do want to get student feed
back on, we should be using
those platforms a lot more,"
Goel said.

Hogan emphasized that the
Office of Community
Standards (OCS) is "open to
feedback on any point that stu
dents feel strongly about" and

said that she hopes students
take advantage of the ability to
comment on or ask questions
about the ARP on the OCS'
website.

Although the GSC hopes to
make a recommendation to the
Faculty Senate in winter quar
ter, ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 predicted that the
GSC will be discussing sexual
assault on campus for the next
few years. Zimbroff referenced
the results of a recent Health
and Promotion and Services
(HPS) survey of 4,000 under
graduate and graduate stu
dents as a call to action for the
Stanford community.
"The survey came out with
some pretty staggering num
bers about sexual assault,
domestic violence, unwanted
and aggressive behavior that
indicates this is a problem
across campus," Zimbroff said.
"The ARP is one part of a big
ger thing that the GSC should
talk about."
At the end of the meeting,
Bindra, on behalf of the
Undergraduate Senate, asked
the GSC to form a sub-commit
tee on the ARP Shaw said the
GSC would discuss the propos
al in their Nov. 14 meeting.

Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members began discussions on the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
Stanford's judicial procedure for cases
involving sexual assault, stalking and rela
tionship violence, at their Nov. 7 meeting.
GSC co-chair Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3
said that the goal is for the GSC,
Undergraduate Senate and Faculty
Senate to approve the ARP by the end of
the academic year. Co-chair David Hsu, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering,
added that he does not think the GSC will
make a decision until the end of winter
quarter.
"I think it's going to take a while," Hsu
said. "It's been going on for so many
years. We haven't even started discussing
the procedural yet."
Until both the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate pass bills regard
ing the ARIJ the Faculty Senate will not
take action. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) will also have to approve
any changes suggested by the GSC or
Undergraduate Senate.
GSC members listened to a presenta
tion about the ARP by Judicial Officer
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, Associate Dean
and OCS Director Koren Bakkegard, and
Senior University Counsel Lauren
Schoenthaler. Several GSC members
asked questions regarding the format of

sexual assault hearings, how cases are
investigated and what role the GSC will
play in determining the future of the ARE
Although some GSC members sug
gested that the Undergraduate Senate
and GSC submit a joint proposal to the
Board of Judicial Affairs, others doubted
whether the 30 representatives from the
two legislative bodies would be able to
reach a consensus.
'A thirty-person conversation is not as
useful as you might imagine," Shaw said.
"It's possible that a better solution would
be a sub-committee of people interested in
the topic and willing to put in the time."
ASSU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 sug
gested creating several sub-committees to
present different options regarding the
ARE He said last year's Undergraduate
Senate was unable to reach a consensus
on the ARE because of the format of their
discussions.
"Fifteen people talking about the same
issue didn't work at all," Bindra said. "It
was a massive amount of opinions contra
dicting each other."
Regardless of whether or not the GSC
decides to create separate sub-commit
tees or submit a joint proposal with the
Undergraduate Senate, Hogan encour
aged GSC members to review the Board
of Judicial Affairs' meeting minutes from
winter quarter 2011 with regard to the
ARP before making a deci
sion.

"They had a lot of really
thoughtful conversations,"
Hogan said. "Reading the min
utes would provide some back
ground for why they made the
decisions they made."

GSC members said that
they would also like to get
more feedback from students
before submitting their pro
posal. Voting member-at-large
Hrishi Goel M.S. 'l3 said he
believes the town hall meet
ings about the ARP were not
very productive because many
students who were interested
in attending struggled to fit
the meeting into their sched
ules.

"Given that most of our
students are online most of the
time, if there is something we
do want to get student feed
back on, we should be using
those platforms a lot more,"
Goel said.

Hogan emphasized that the
Office of Community
Standards (OCS) is "open to
feedback on any point that stu
dents feel strongly about" and

said that she hopes students
take advantage of the ability to
comment on or ask questions
about the ARP on the OCS'
website.

Although the GSC hopes to
make a recommendation to the
Faculty Senate in winter quar
ter, ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 predicted that the
GSC will be discussing sexual
assault on campus for the next
few years. Zimbroff referenced
the results of a recent Health
and Promotion and Services
(HPS) survey of 4,000 under
graduate and graduate stu
dents as a call to action for the
Stanford community.
"The survey came out with
some pretty staggering num
bers about sexual assault,
domestic violence, unwanted
and aggressive behavior that
indicates this is a problem
across campus," Zimbroff said.
"The ARP is one part of a big
ger thing that the GSC should
talk about."
At the end of the meeting,
Bindra, on behalf of the
Undergraduate Senate, asked
the GSC to form a sub-commit
tee on the ARP Shaw said the
GSC would discuss the propos
al in their Nov. 14 meeting.
