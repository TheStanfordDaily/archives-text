## GSC starts initial ARP discussions 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
members began discussions on the
Alternative Review Process (ARP),
Stanford's judicial procedure for cases
involving sexual assault, stalking and rela
tionship violence, at their Nov. 7 meeting.
GSC co-chair Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3
said that the goal is for the GSC,
Undergraduate Senate and Faculty
Senate to approve the ARP by the end of
the academic year. Co-chair David Hsu, a
doctoral student in electrical engineering,
added that he does not think the GSC will
make a decision until the end of winter
quarter.
"I think it's going to take a while," Hsu
said. "It's been going on for so many
years. We haven't even started discussing
the procedural yet."
Until both the GSC and the
Undergraduate Senate pass bills regard
ing the ARIJ the Faculty Senate will not
take action. The Office of Community
Standards (OCS) will also have to approve
any changes suggested by the GSC or
Undergraduate Senate.
GSC members listened to a presenta
tion about the ARP by Judicial Officer
Jamie Pontius-Hogan, Associate Dean
and OCS Director Koren Bakkegard, and
Senior University Counsel Lauren
Schoenthaler. Several GSC members
asked questions regarding the format of

sexual assault hearings, how cases are
investigated and what role the GSC will
play in determining the future of the ARE
Although some GSC members sug
gested that the Undergraduate Senate
and GSC submit a joint proposal to the
Board of Judicial Affairs, others doubted
whether the 30 representatives from the
two legislative bodies would be able to
reach a consensus.
'A thirty-person conversation is not as
useful as you might imagine," Shaw said.
"It's possible that a better solution would
be a sub-committee of people interested in
the topic and willing to put in the time."
ASSU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 sug
gested creating several sub-committees to
present different options regarding the
ARE He said last year's Undergraduate
Senate was unable to reach a consensus
on the ARE because of the format of their
discussions.
"Fifteen people talking about the same
issue didn't work at all," Bindra said. "It
was a massive amount of opinions contra
dicting each other."
Regardless of whether or not the GSC
decides to create separate sub-commit
tees or submit a joint proposal with the
Undergraduate Senate, Hogan encour
aged GSC members to review the Board
of Judicial Affairs' meeting minutes from
winter quarter 2011 with regard to the
