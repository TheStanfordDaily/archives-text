## Nothing beats plain old fandom 
### Joey Beyda 
When Stepfan Thylor
was controversially
"stuffed" on the goal
line in overtime
against Notre Dame,
Joey Beyda—the kid who had kicked,
screamed and yelled at every close play
in the last decade and a half of Stanford
football —just got up, turned and
walked silently out of the Lantana
lounge and back to his room without a
word, off to write his column. And then
every time someone brought the game
up over the next week, he told them that
that the refs had made the right call.
It was fundamentally un-me. It was
wrong. Of course, it was my own fault.
When The Daily was deciding how
to organize its football beat this
September, I made it known early and
often that I would not, could not and
most definitely should' not cover
games from the press box. A son of
two Stanford alums, my 15 seasons of
Cardinal football had made me way
too attached to the team for that role.
Telling me to shut up and take notes
quietly in the press box, smack dab in
the middle of Stanford football's spon
taneous heyday I had seen just two
bowl-eligible teams in my first 11
years of fanhood—would be akin to
making David Shaw give up the
power run or asking Stanford to
admit athletes with sub-par GPAs:
Some things are just too foundational
to give up.
At the same time, I found myself
with once-in-a-lifetime access to the
team I had grown up loving. After
poring so many hours over sports
journalism in high school and as a
freshman here, how could I pass up
the chance to interview players who
were filling the shoes of my childhood
idols? How could I ignore the oppor
tunity to share my passion for
Stanford football with the student
body, whose interest was at an all-time
high after back-to-back BCS bowls?

So I carved out a little niche for
myself. Besides working on features
of lesser-known players and team
defining trends, I would write game
analysis columns from a fan's point of
view, watching from the stands before
presenting my unique, semi-emotion
al take on where the team stood, if not
why it won or lost.
The features, I hope, were as
enriching for readers as they were for
me; I hope to continue them in the
future. But those analytical columns
were another story entirely.
Eveiy time I wrote one of those
pieces, a little part of the fan in me
died. It wasn't as fun to watch games
anymore, even though for the first
time I could say I had met most of the
players on that field. Whenever I had
a point to make I didn't discuss it with
the people I was watching with;
instead, I stored the witty lines in the
back of my head for later regurgita
tion into Monday morning's Daily.
Even though I was standing in the
Red Zone and not sitting in the press
box, every play was another chance
for realistic, unbiased analysis of the
variety I just wasn't accustomed to
giving about Stanford football.
So after filling these pages with
120,000 words over the last two years,
I (temporarily) quit writing for The
Daily the day after that Notre Dame
game. It was time to take back the fan
in me.

At Big Game the next week I
pulled out all the stops. A constant
stream of booing and heckling at
everything Cal left me voiceless by
the end of the second quarter. That
was truly a shame, because I couldn't
shout anything after the longest run
by a Berkeley affiliate all afternoon:
the halftime dash by a Cal streaker.
(Zing.)
I honestly couldn't care less that
Stanford's offense stagnated in the
second half and that the Bears were
just a late red-zone conversion from
making it a game; we had the Axe,
and nothing else deserved mention.
The next night, I watched the San
Fbancisco Giants dominate Game 6 of
the NLCS from literally the worst
seats in AT&T Park—so high up in
left field, I actually felt my nose start
to bleed a few innings in. But from a
vantage point not much better than
the helicopter shots you see on T\£ I
was still raucously calling balls and
strikes like a veteran umpire. Sitting
in Sunken Diamond's low box last
spring covering Stanford, that temp
tation had never arisen.
The Giants' World Series run
embodied so much of what I was
growing to understand about sports.
Burdened by midterms and classes,
the analytical, utilitarian fan in me
didn't even tune in to watch Game 3
against Cincinnati or Game 5 against
