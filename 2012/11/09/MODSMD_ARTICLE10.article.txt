## FacSen to implement SUES changes 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard a report at
its Nov. 8 meeting about how the
University is working to implement the
changes to undergraduate education
suggested by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), which was approved by the
Senate in May.
President John Hennessy opened the
meeting by briefly noting the recent
selection of Stanford alum Peter Salovey
'BO M.A. 'BO as President of Yale
University.
Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam then began his
report, stating that his office is working
to pare down the SUES committee's 55
recommendations. Elam identified
efforts to integrate majors within a
broader education, as well as integrating
classroom study into students' residen
tial experience.
"Looking at the Stanford journey
that students go on, I can [break] it down
to three words integrate, innovate
and inspire," Elam said.
The emphasis on innovation, Elam
noted, has already been explored sub
stantially at Stanford, with concepts such
as the flipped classroom and an
increased emphasis on project-based
learning. He said such efforts should be
further encouraged.
"There are amazing things that facul
ty are doing already," Elam said.
Elam also reminded the Senate of the
broader significance of a Stanford educa
tion in providing students with the tools
to make a difference in the outside world.
"We want to inspire students to find
their own Stanford," Elam said. "We
want them to be empowered... to really
find their own path."
"We want to deliver an education
that's vital and enduring," he added,
acknowledging student concerns about a
perceived lack of vocational content. "We
have to be concerned about these
things."
Turning his attention to Thinking
Matters, the freshman requirement that
replaced IHUM this academic year,
Elam cited the breadth and number of
courses offered as a significant success.

He noted that 88 percent of freshmen
were selected for their first-choice
Thinking Matters course, and 54 percent
of incoming freshmen said they intended
to take more than one.
While the Faculty Senate decided last
May to not make freshmen introductory
seminars mandatory, Elam noted that
seminars have enjoyed a rise in popular
ity over previous years, with 91.5 percent
of incoming freshmen planning to take at
least one. Elam credited the program's
voluntary nature as a contributor to its
success.
He acknowledged, however, that
scheduling conflicts and required appli
cation statements might preclude
greater involvement in seminars by ath
letes and students from under-resourced
backgrounds, respectively.
"We have to work with both these

groups to allow more flexibility and
make them feel that that's not a hurdle to
getting into seminars," Elam said.
Elam also briefly applauded the
Cardinal Compass portal —an online
tool offering guidance in course selection
—as a success in channeling curious
freshmen into appropriate classes,
though he noted that the portal's offer
ings could be further expanded.

"There a real sense that this device
has worked," Elam said.
Looking to future reforms, Elam
highlighted the potential benefits of helix
courses sequences of classes built
around an overarching topic and "cap
stone" projects offering students a
means of effectively summing up their
Stanford experience.

Harry Elam discussed the success of new freshman programs at the Thursday
Faculty Senate meeting. He said 10 percent more freshmen are taking
Introductory Seminars than last year, and that 54 percent of freshman said they
intended to take more than one of the required Thinking Matters courses.
"We want to offer inter
disciplinary synthesis,"
Elam said. "What this has
the potential to be is some
thing that's uniquely
Stanford."

According to Elam, his
office will soon send out a
survey to faculty that will
examine topics like teaching
practices and the relation
ship between scholarship
and classroom teaching.
"This is an exciting
moment here at Stanford to
take advantage of," Elam
said.

A brief discussion period
largely focused on the
reforms' implications for
methods of education and

feedback that might be
solicited from students.

Gabriella Safran, profes
sor of Slavic languages and
literatures, applauded the
general shift towards a
"capacity rather than
content based" method of
education, but wondered if
the shift would create ten
sions among faculty mem
bers weighing the two
approaches.
"It's going to take time,"
Elam said. "It's going to
take adjustment. It's some
thing that faculty are going
to have to find their own way
in."

Susan Holmes, professor
of statistics, questioned the
wisdom of soliciting student
feedback in course evalua
tions conducted at the end of
the quarter, calling for a
more long-term view.
"That's like evaluating

the dentist right after you've
gotten out of the dentist's
chair," Holmes said.
Caroline Hoxby, profes
sor of economics, argued
that despite offerings like
Cardinal Compass, fresh
men students still tend to
take either broadly sub
scribed introductory offer
ings or highly specific class
es geared towards older stu
dents.

"Most of the freshmen
don't have a very good
understanding of all the dif
ferent fields," Hoxby said.
"They appear to choose
them kind of idiosyncratical
ly. It would be good to help
freshmen think about the
fact that a good course for
freshmen is one that helps
them explore."
