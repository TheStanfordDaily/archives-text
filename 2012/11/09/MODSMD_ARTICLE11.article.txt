## Keys to yet another top-15 showdown 
### Sam Fisher 
Stanford's football team has
arrived at Murder's Row.
Oregon State, Oregon and
UCLA, the last three oppo
nents of the regular season,
are a combined 15-3 in conference and
23-3 overall. That's a tiny bit better
than Stanford's previous two oppo
nents, Washington State and
Colorado, who had one win combined,
and that was only because they had to
play each other.
It tells you something about the
difficulty of the last three games when
the No. 11 Oregon State Beavers
might be the easiest test left. You
always have to be careful reading too
far into the rankings, but in this case,
it's certainly a sign of how evenly
matched these teams are. Here are a
few key matchups that could make the
difference in the game.
Stanford's defensive line vs. Oregon
State's offensive line
Oregon State's offensive fire
power comes from its star receivers
Markus Wheaton and Brandin
Cooks. The two have combined for
just shy of 1,700 receiving yards
already this season. Stanford's sec
ondary will have to step up to keep
those two in check. However, stop
ping Wheaton and Cooks doesn't
start with the secondary; it starts
right up front, where Stanford has a
huge advantage.
The Cardinal leads the nation in
sacks with 40, which is a big reason
why Stanford is 7-2 in spite of its
inconsistent offensive play. Oregon
State has given up 18 sacks, but five
of them came in its last game
against Arizona State. The Beavers
offensive line showed that it has
holes, and Stanford is the perfect
team to take advantage of them.
The Kevin Hogan/Ryan Hewitt
connection
Fullback Ryan Hewitt was a
favorite target of Andrew Luck in
2011. Last year, Hewitt caught 34
passes for 282 yards and 5 touch
downs â€” pretty impressive num
bers for a fullback. Through six
games with Josh Nunes this season
(Hewitt missed the first two games
of the season with an ankle injury),
Hewitt caught only three passes for
19 yards and no scores.
In the Colorado game, we could
already see the difference Hogan
makes to Hewitt's productivity.
Hewitt caught two passes for 18
yards, effectively matching his pre
vious totals for the entire season.
The first completion came on
Hogan's second play of the after
noon, which picked up a key first
down.
Not all of Hewitt's added produc
tivity from Hogan's insertion at
quarterback appears on the stat
sheet. On the very next play,
Hewitt's defender stayed back to
respect his receiving ability, allow
ing Hewitt to easily kick him out and
set up a Stepfan Taylor rushing
touchdown.
This is a great example of how
effective Stanford's offense can be
by just getting Ryan Hewitt
involved. First and foremost, he
provides an easy outlet for picking
up the first down on a few key third
down plays throughout the game.
Additionally, once Hewitt is involved
in the offense, he becomes another
threat for opponents to worry
about, making the power run even
deadlier. If Stanford can continue to
take advantage of the apparent
chemistry between Hogan and
Hewitt, it could make a huge differ
ence for Stanford against Oregon
State.
Stanford limiting Oregon State's big
plays
Oregon State lives off the big
play on both offense and defense.
On the offensive side of the ball, one
of the biggest sources of the big play
is Wheaton, the star receiver.
Mike Riley uses Wheaton very
similarly to how he utilized James
Rodgers during his career at
Oregon State. Not only is Wheaton
a great receiving threat, averaging
just shy of 100 yards per game
through the air, but he also provides
big plays on the ground.
Wheaton and Cooks have com
bined for 161 yards and a touch
down rushing this season. Mike
Riley especially likes using
Wheaton on the jet sweep to get the
ball in Wheaton's hands running at
full speed toward the sideline.
Stanford needs to be aware of
Wheaton and Cooks at all times.
This will be tricky for Stanford,
because the Card's propensity to
bring the blitz means that it's con-
