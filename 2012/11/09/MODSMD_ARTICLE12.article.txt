## TITLE DEFENSE BEGINS IN TOURNEY OPENER 
### KAMARIA TAYLOR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a tight victory over
rival Cal in Berkeley last week
end granted the No. 1 Cardinal
(17-1-1 Pac-12) its fourth consec
utive undefeated Pac-12 season,
Stanford must now refocus as it
turns its eyes toward the real
prize, an NCAA title. On Friday
the defending national champi
ons and overall No. 1 seed wel
come Idaho State (11-5-3) for the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment.

Against the Golden Bears, a
fourth-minute goal was the only
tally of the match. Redshirt jun
ior forward Courtney Verloo fin
ished sophomore forward
Chioma Übogagu's cross follow
ing an impressive run down the
sideline that beat two defenders.
Stanford held Cal to a shutout,
though the Bears were particu
larly threatening late in the
match, with shots coming off the
crossbar and the post.

Nonetheless, the win was the

team's 42nd straight in the Pac
-12, meaning the senior class will
finish a perfect 40-0 in the con
ference.

"It was a really good game
before the tournament to pre
pare," Verloo said. "I think it was
a good reminder to us that every
game in the tournament is going
to be a good game and to make
sure we finish our chances."

In addition to being the reign
ing champs, the Card approach
es the tournament looking for its
fourth consecutive final and
fifth-straight appearance in the
College Cup. However,
Stanford's 16-team bracket
holds tough competition. If it
defeats Idaho State, the team
will play the winner of Santa
Clara (11-3-6) versus Long
Beach State (12-7).
The main challenges within
the bracket come from other
seeded teams, like No. 3 UCLA
(15-2-2) and No. 2 San Diego
State (19-1-1), one of which

Senior defender Alina Garciamendez proved herself a clutch performer
last year when she scored a goal in the national semifinal.
She will be a huge part of Stanford's title defense this postseason.
Stanford will have to face to
earn a spot in the College
Cup. The Card defeated
UCLA just two weeks ago in
a tough comeback game that
saw it squeeze out a 2-1 vic
tory to secure the confer
ence title. San Diego State
also proved to be a narrow
victory during the Santa
Clara Classic, but a free kick
from Courtney Verloo deliv
ered the win.

Tight but well-earned
victories have been the story
of Stanford's season. Seven
of the past nine games have
been won with one-goal mar
gins, including the trip to
Los Angeles two weeks ago
that featured an overtime
victory against USC along
with the late comeback
against UCLA. Verloo noted
how this was a highlight for
the team.

"In general this season
has been amazing just
because of the character this
team has shown.... I think
that every time we're able to
come out of a game like that,
like against UCLA or USC,
it's just been really exciting
and given our team confi
dence," she said.

But Stanford has also
dealt a few thrashings this
season.

Against Oregon State,

for example, Stanford netted
five goals, each coming from
a different player. What's
more, the team has not lost
or tied since back-to-back
matches against West
Virginia and Boston College
in August.
Stanford's first-round
competition, Idaho State,
returns to the NCAA tour
nament for the first time
since 2006 thanks to a 4-3
penalty shootout victory in
the Big Sky Conference
championship against
University of Montana. The
shootout featured three
saves from freshman goal
keeper Sheridan Hapsic,
who also stepped up in the
Bengals' conference semifi
nal win against Weber State.
That game was also decided
on penalties.
The Card also enters
tonight's game with a boost
of confidence after the annu
al Pac-12 awards were
announced earlier in the
week. While a Stanford play
er did not win Pac-12 Player
of the Year for the first time
since 2008, five team mem
bers earned a spot on the
All-Pac-12 First Team, two
made the All-Freshman
team and two received other

awards.
Stanford kicks off its
playoff campaign tonight at
7 p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.

After a tight victory over
rival Cal in Berkeley last week
end granted the No. 1 Cardinal
(17-1-1 Pac-12) its fourth consec
utive undefeated Pac-12 season,
Stanford must now refocus as it
turns its eyes toward the real
prize, an NCAA title. On Friday
the defending national champi
ons and overall No. 1 seed wel
come Idaho State (11-5-3) for the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment.

Against the Golden Bears, a
fourth-minute goal was the only
tally of the match. Redshirt jun
ior forward Courtney Verloo fin
ished sophomore forward
Chioma Übogagu's cross follow
ing an impressive run down the
sideline that beat two defenders.
Stanford held Cal to a shutout,
though the Bears were particu
larly threatening late in the
match, with shots coming off the
crossbar and the post.

Nonetheless, the win was the

team's 42nd straight in the Pac
-12, meaning the senior class will
finish a perfect 40-0 in the con
ference.

"It was a really good game
before the tournament to pre
pare," Verloo said. "I think it was
a good reminder to us that every
game in the tournament is going
to be a good game and to make
sure we finish our chances."

In addition to being the reign
ing champs, the Card approach
es the tournament looking for its
fourth consecutive final and
fifth-straight appearance in the
College Cup. However,
Stanford's 16-team bracket
holds tough competition. If it
defeats Idaho State, the team
will play the winner of Santa
Clara (11-3-6) versus Long
Beach State (12-7).
The main challenges within
the bracket come from other
seeded teams, like No. 3 UCLA
(15-2-2) and No. 2 San Diego
State (19-1-1), one of which

Senior defender Alina Garciamendez proved herself a clutch performer
last year when she scored a goal in the national semifinal.
She will be a huge part of Stanford's title defense this postseason.
Stanford will have to face to
earn a spot in the College
Cup. The Card defeated
UCLA just two weeks ago in
a tough comeback game that
saw it squeeze out a 2-1 vic
tory to secure the confer
ence title. San Diego State
also proved to be a narrow
victory during the Santa
Clara Classic, but a free kick
from Courtney Verloo deliv
ered the win.

Tight but well-earned
victories have been the story
of Stanford's season. Seven
of the past nine games have
been won with one-goal mar
gins, including the trip to
Los Angeles two weeks ago
that featured an overtime
victory against USC along
with the late comeback
against UCLA. Verloo noted
how this was a highlight for
the team.

"In general this season
has been amazing just
because of the character this
team has shown.... I think
that every time we're able to
come out of a game like that,
like against UCLA or USC,
it's just been really exciting
and given our team confi
dence," she said.

But Stanford has also
dealt a few thrashings this
season.

Against Oregon State,

for example, Stanford netted
five goals, each coming from
a different player. What's
more, the team has not lost
or tied since back-to-back
matches against West
Virginia and Boston College
in August.
