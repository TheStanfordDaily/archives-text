# MEN'S SENIORS PLAY LAST GAME TONIGHT AT CAL
## 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even with the NCAA tourna
ment all but officially out of reach,
Stanford men's soccer will get to
end its season with a meaningful
game as they travel to Berkeley to
face the rival Golden Bears today.
Stanford (8-8-1, 4-4-1 Pac-12) is
coming off an impressive 4-0 thrash
ing of San Diego State, which
allowed the team to take out its
frustration after a heart-breaking
overtime loss at UCLA the week
before. In both of those games, the
Cardinal has displayed some of its
best play this season and will look to
continue this trend going into the
season finale.

"We've been playing some great
soccer and now we're looking for
ward to the last match against Cal.
We'll be excited to play again this
week," head coach Jeremy Gunn
told GoStanford.com.
There are few better conclusions
to a Stanford athlete's career than a
victory over the Golden Bears, and
seniors Dersu Abolfathi, Eric
Anderson, Hunter Gorskie and
Adam Jahn will get a chance to do

just that. Abolfathi and Jahn both
found the back of the net in the San
Diego State match, with Jahn pick
ing up his team-leading 10th goal of
the season, the program's largest
scoring outburst since Roger
Levesque netted 14 in 2001.
Sophomore forward Zach
Batteer will also play a critical role
for the Cardinal offense. Last time
Stanford matched up with Cal,
Batteer scored both goals in a 2-0
home victory and won Pac-12 Player
of the Week honors. If he and Jahn
can continue to play well together
on the attack, Stanford will certain
ly find its share of chances on goal.
Converting these chances will
prove crucial on Friday. In a host of
games this season, Stanford has
played a full 90 minutes of convinc
ing soccer, controlling the match
and dominating nearly every statis
tical category, but failed to cash in
on their good play to get the right
result.

Cal has scored only three goals
in their last four games and will be
looking to their top scorers, senior
midfielder Tony Salciccia and soph-

Adam Jahn (9), awaiting a pass above, will play what will likely be his
final game of college soccer today at Cal. Jahn is among the nation's
leaders with 10 goals this season, but the Cardinal is a long shot for an
NCAA tournament bid in Jeremy Gunn's first season as head coach.
