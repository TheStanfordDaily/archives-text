# Tourney curse to be tested

### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After recording a 3-0 win over
Miami (OH) on Tbesday, the No. 11
Stanford field hockey team qualified
for the NCAA Tournament for the
12th time in school history and the
fifth time in the last six years.
The Cardinal (16-6, 6-0 NorPac)
enters the tournament riding a
seven-game win streak, but faces a
tough road as it meets No. 1 North
Carolina in the first round tomorrow
from Chapel Hill, N.C.

Stanford is 0-11 all-time in NCAA
tournament games. Last season, the
Cardinal lost in the NorPac finals and
had to rely on an at-large bid to get
into the 16-team field. Stanford then
fell to Duke 5-0 in the first round.

"This year, we played into a spot,
leaving no stone unturned, which has
been fantastic," said head coach Tara
Danielson. "This was the goal from
the beginning â€”to get into the
NCAA tournament and not just get
there but perform. I think we are
right on track for the expectations of
the program."

The Cardinal has already faced
the Tar Heels once this season, also
in Chapel Hill. On Sept. 23, Stanford
lost 6-2. In that game, the Cardinal
jumped out to a 1-0 lead just eight
minutes into the game, but the Tar
Heels came back with five unan
swered goals before halftime.
"Let's face it, UNC is a very, very
polished team," Danielson said.
"They were clearly the best in the
country early this season, no doubt
about it. However, we're quite differ
ent than when we saw them in
September. We've improved proba

bly 25 percent since last time that we
played them."
UNC comes into the game as the
ACC champion after defeating
defending national champion
Maryland 4-2 in the final the Tar
Heels have not lost since Sept. 1.
The Tar Heels are led by three
time All-American senior midfielder
Kelsey Kolojej chick and two-time
All-American senior back Caitlin Van
Sickle.

But Stanford has an Ail-
American of its own in defender
Becky Dru, who was recently named
NorPac Player of the Year for the
second consecutive season. The
Cardinal will look to Dru, who has a
team-high 35 points, to lead the team
to an upset in what could be the
senior's final game.
The Cardinal will be bolstered by
the presence of All-Conference play
ers Kelsey Harbin and Maddie
Secco. During the team's first
matchup against the Tar Heels, both
Harbin and Secco were absent from
the game to compete in the Junior
Pan American Championships.
"I think [the presence of Harbin
and Secco] just puts all the pieces of
the puzzle together for our team,"
Danielson said. "We've really been
building and shaping the team, so by
having those two players it creates a
different look and a different feel to
the program."
The game will start at 8:30 a.m.
Pacific time in Chapel Hill, N.C. The
team is well acclimatized to the time
difference, since they have been on
the East Coast since the NorPac
tournament began on Nov. 1.
"We've allocated a lot of study
hours," Danielson laughed. "The

those fortunes against top-ranked North Carolina tomorrow, despite the upstart Cardinal's confidence.
girls should actually be get
ting ahead [in school] because
they have so much study time
here. They are taking it in
stride."
Despite the strong opposi
tion, Danielson remained opti
mistic about her team's
chances.
"We're excited to play
UNC. We've already played
them once this year, so we
have an idea of what they look
like," Danielson said. "They're
clearly the No. 1 team in the
country, but we are looking
forward to the challenge."

The winner of the
Stanford-UNC match will
play the winner of Old
Dominion-Mchigan on Sunday
morning.
