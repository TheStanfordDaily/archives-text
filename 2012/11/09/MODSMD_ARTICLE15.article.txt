## SEEING GREEN Tall, Dark and Successful 
### Holly Moeller 
BOSTON, Mass. "The trees
are certainly shorter out
here," said Luke.
The East Coaster in me bristled
instantly. "Well, sure, nothing's
going to measure up to a Redwood,"
I said. "But these guys along the
road are hardly the best that
Massachusetts has to offer."
As Luke mused out loud about
the tall trees that could be found in
his home state of Oregon, I thought
about what the forests of the north
eastern United States would have
looked like centuries before the
highway we now cruised was con
structed.
I grew up in the heartland of the
deciduous tree, embedded within
the wedge of our country, whose
rainfall and temperature regimes
are ideal for colorful broadleaf trees.
The backyard of my childhood home
was packed with red maples, sweet
gums and hundred-year-old oaks,
towering overhead in their climato
logical niche. Yet even these trees
didn't represent a northeastern for
est at its prime: Our neighborhood
was built on old farmland, cleared of
its forest centuries earlier, during
colonial time.
Since the Mayflower made
landfall in Plymouth, Mass. in 1620,
we've cut down one quarter of the
four million square kilometers of
forest that covered our country.
Much of the initial land-clearing
occurred along the Eastern
seaboard, as each new resident of
the future United States carved out
a hectare or two of farmland. The
land that wasn't cleared was often
selectively logged particularly
for tall, straight-as-a-die trees like
the Atlantic White Cedar, a popular
choice for ship masts.
The wood did not go to waste. It
built, furnished, and heated homes.
It fenced in pastures and supported
plows. Eventually, however, the land
lost its appeal. Farmers moved west,
chasing a new frontier, or to cities,
chasing a different career, leaving
their hard-won farmland to lie fallow.
But in the Northeast, old fields
do not remain fields for long. Slowly
but surely, they undergo the ecolog
ical process of succession, transi
tioning from weedy pasture to
shrubland to pine forest to hard
wood forest.
The trajectory of this reforesta
tion varies dramatically across loca
tions. Each tree has its own habitat
preferences, evolved over millennia.
Differences in things like topogra
phy, which can render one spot
boggy and an adjacent one dry, and
soil type, gauged in one by the rela
tive proportions of sand and clay,
can produce dramatic shifts in the
set of tree species inhabiting a site.
Meanwhile, disturbances like wild
fires and storms provide an addi
tional environmental filter, selecting

for species with special tolerances or
that bounce back quickly, and press
an occasional reset button on suc
cession. And, to add another layer of
complexity, random processes like
the casual arrival of an unusual seed
at the right place at the right time
can sometimes dramatically alter
the course of a plant community's
development.
That's why, as a group, ecologists
have moved away from the old con
cept of "climax communities": the
idea that a group of plants and ani
mals would eventually converge on
some regional average and remain
there indefinitely.
Yet we still use terms like "old
growth" and "primary forest" to
describe the few remnants of north
eastern forest that remain relatively
untouched by man. These are our
icons, our vision of what the forests
were, what they could yet be, and
my way to contradict Luke's West
Coast snobbery. Red oaks soar well
past the height of ten-story build
ings. Hemlocks stand equally tall,
some more than 500 years old.
Sugar maples run sweet in the
spring and flush red with the fading
of summer. The ground rolls gently
underfoot, flowing over the hum
mocks of old logs and into the hol
lows between.
On our two-day whirlwind trip
back East, Luke and I won't get a
chance to stop by any of these
forests or (as Luke would prefer)
hunt for salamanders in their cool,
dark recesses. Even if we had, we
wouldn't really have seen a glimpse
back in time. The American chest
nut tree has vanished from the
region, victim to a foreign disease.
Passenger pigeons no longer crowd
the branches. Some changes are
here to stay.
Yet the forests themselves
and their up-and-coming relatives
springing up alongside highways or
on abandoned fields remind us
that, at least in this system, recov
ery is possible. Understanding this
recovery, and its varied possible tra
jectories, helps us understand the
limits to ecosystem resilience. And
witnessing the sheer amount of time
it takes hundreds of years to
even approach the look and feel of
"old growth" reminds us to safe
guard the uncut forests that remain,
like Luke's beloved, towering
Douglas-fir.
