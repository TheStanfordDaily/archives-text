## Depression, Shakespeare and the Madness of a Taboo 
### Alex Bayer 
The idea that we are all blissful
at this stage of our lives is
ludicrous, ludicrous. To
think of all the breakups that take
place, the identity-searching that is
adolescence, the existential crises I
experience on a daily basis. I wres
tle with the realization that my
youth is running out, the uncertain
ty of what lies ahead, who my real
friends are, who I am. We are all
engaged in an identical struggle,
played over the span of our lives, to
be and to become our best selves.
The problem I have with this
depression stigma is that it's non
sensical. We are humans partaking
in the game of life. No good song, no
good film, is without intimations of
the fear and insecurity that we all
struggle with. No good literature,
not a single book, is written about
people who are happy all the time.
Would you watch a movie about
happy people? What's remotely
interesting about that?
Depression sounds very dark
and brooding and clinical, but really
it's quite simple and quite natural.
Some of the greatest actors, artists,
comedians, scholars, poets and writ
ers have suffered from depression.
Abraham Lincoln was famously
afflicted with melancholia, and
some experts think it was his result
ing introversion that made him so
deeply thoughtful and visionary a
leader. People like Winston Churchill,
Eminem, William Faulkner, Jon
Hamm, Demi Lovato, Lupe Fiasco,
Ann Hathaway, Beyonce, Mozart,
Isaac Newton, Nietzsche, J.K.
Rowling, Gwen Stefani, Mark Twain,
Kurt Vonnegut, Van Gogh, Reese
Witherspoon and Oprah yes,

even Oprah have suffered from
depression. I don't mean to glorify
depression (though I do believe it's
an individual's decision to address
depression in the way they see fit).
What I mean to do is point out how
normal this supposed syndrome is.
Depression is, at its simplest,
the affliction of coming to terms
with life's inherent unanswered
questions: the losses that have no
point, the relationship that was not
to be, the failure of parents we
expect to be invincible and upstand
ing. We are left, at every turn, with
a mini identity crisis and a larger
one: the disillusionment that
accompanies an awareness of our
parent's fallibility and the flippancy
with which the universe dispenses
out bad luck.
Once you scratch the surface,
I've found much everyone I've
talked to at Stanford has their own
set of insecurities and angsts and
medication. And why not? We are at
college, prime time for the nitty
gritty of self-exploration. It's a
beautiful thing, a painful thing, but
above all, a process that is central to
our very humanity. How could there
be shame in that?
The university experience is
much more than four years of aca
demics and intellectual questioning.
For many, it is the messy but funda
mental period where we shape the
trajectory of who we are. Stanford
has a responsibility to honor not
just the former side of the coin but
also the latter. I applaud Vaden's
efforts, but the university has fallen
short in other crucial areas. Its
close-lipped attitude in the wake of
student suicides was shameful.

What may be contributing to the
problem is Stanford's growing
emphasis on job recruiting, a pres
sure felt by many students. It may
lead to an attractive endowment,
but it causes students to fixate on
getting that lucrative job at the end
of the tunnel, an ambition that dis
tracts from the deep, if unspoken,
purpose of a well-rounded liberal
arts education: learning who we are
and getting an inkling of how we fit
into the larger picture. College is
not a means to an end.
It is a journey in its own right, a
voyage replete with trials so com
monplace they are rites of passage.
It is life in motion, and here I find
myself back to sentence one.
Depression is the result of living
life. It can be overcome, but never,
for any reason, should one feel the
need to repress it. Stanford needs
to do its part in validating the real
truth of adolescent angst beyond
just offering services to students. If
the stigma is to really fall away, the
administration itself needs to make
a vocal and brave declaration about
the normalcy of depression and the
"myth" of the impossibly happy
Stanford student.
To be, or not to be. Why does
Hamlet's line captivate us so? For
so concise a line, it encapsulates the
infinite. The infinite questions that
nip at our feet, the doubts that
haunt our every step. Have no
shame in dealing with depression or
fear in disclosing it. Rest assured
that you're in the company of not
only luminaries, but all of mankind.

much more than four years of aca
demics and intellectual questioning.
For many, it is the messy but funda
mental period where we shape the
trajectory of who we are. Stanford
has a responsibility to honor not
just the former side of the coin but
also the latter. I applaud Vaden's
efforts, but the university has fallen
short in other crucial areas. Its
close-lipped attitude in the wake of
student suicides was shameful.

What may be contributing to the
problem is Stanford's growing
emphasis on job recruiting, a pres
sure felt by many students. It may
lead to an attractive endowment,
but it causes students to fixate on
getting that lucrative job at the end
of the tunnel, an ambition that dis
tracts from the deep, if unspoken,
purpose of a well-rounded liberal
arts education: learning who we are
and getting an inkling of how we fit
into the larger picture. College is
not a means to an end.
It is a journey in its own right, a
voyage replete with trials so com
monplace they are rites of passage.
It is life in motion, and here I find
myself back to sentence one.
Depression is the result of living
life. It can be overcome, but never,
for any reason, should one feel the
need to repress it. Stanford needs
to do its part in validating the real
truth of adolescent angst beyond
just offering services to students. If
the stigma is to really fall away, the
administration itself needs to make
a vocal and brave declaration about
the normalcy of depression and the
"myth" of the impossibly happy
Stanford student.
To be, or not to be. Why does
Hamlet's line captivate us so? For
so concise a line, it encapsulates the
infinite. The infinite questions that
nip at our feet, the doubts that
haunt our every step. Have no
shame in dealing with depression or
fear in disclosing it. Rest assured
that you're in the company of not
only luminaries, but all of mankind.

The idea that we are all blissful
at this stage of our lives is
ludicrous, ludicrous. To
think of all the breakups that take
place, the identity-searching that is
adolescence, the existential crises I
experience on a daily basis. I wres
tle with the realization that my
youth is running out, the uncertain
ty of what lies ahead, who my real
friends are, who I am. We are all
engaged in an identical struggle,
played over the span of our lives, to
be and to become our best selves.
The problem I have with this
depression stigma is that it's non
sensical. We are humans partaking
in the game of life. No good song, no
good film, is without intimations of
the fear and insecurity that we all
struggle with. No good literature,
not a single book, is written about
people who are happy all the time.
Would you watch a movie about
happy people? What's remotely
interesting about that?
Depression sounds very dark
and brooding and clinical, but really
it's quite simple and quite natural.
Some of the greatest actors, artists,
comedians, scholars, poets and writ
ers have suffered from depression.
Abraham Lincoln was famously
afflicted with melancholia, and
some experts think it was his result
ing introversion that made him so
deeply thoughtful and visionary a
leader. People like Winston Churchill,
Eminem, William Faulkner, Jon
Hamm, Demi Lovato, Lupe Fiasco,
Ann Hathaway, Beyonce, Mozart,
Isaac Newton, Nietzsche, J.K.
Rowling, Gwen Stefani, Mark Twain,
Kurt Vonnegut, Van Gogh, Reese
Witherspoon and Oprah yes,

even Oprah have suffered from
depression. I don't mean to glorify
depression (though I do believe it's
an individual's decision to address
depression in the way they see fit).
What I mean to do is point out how
normal this supposed syndrome is.
Depression is, at its simplest,
the affliction of coming to terms
with life's inherent unanswered
questions: the losses that have no
point, the relationship that was not
to be, the failure of parents we
expect to be invincible and upstand
ing. We are left, at every turn, with
a mini identity crisis and a larger
one: the disillusionment that
accompanies an awareness of our
parent's fallibility and the flippancy
with which the universe dispenses
out bad luck.
Once you scratch the surface,
I've found much everyone I've
talked to at Stanford has their own
set of insecurities and angsts and
medication. And why not? We are at
college, prime time for the nitty
gritty of self-exploration. It's a
beautiful thing, a painful thing, but
above all, a process that is central to
our very humanity. How could there
be shame in that?
