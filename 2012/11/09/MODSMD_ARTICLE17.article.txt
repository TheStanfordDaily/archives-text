# SEASON OPENS AT MAPLES
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off of two decisive exhi
bition victories last week, the
Stanford women's basketball team
is primed and ready to start the
2012-13 regular season campaign.
The No. 4 Cardinal opens the season
tonight against the Fresno State
Bulldogs hoping to continue its dom
inance in season openers. It has
been a decade since Stanford lost its
first game of the year.
It won't be a walk in the park
against the Bulldogs, who won the
Western Athletic Conference last
year but are now part of Mountain
West Conference and are pegged to
finish fourth. Preseason All-
Mountain West selections Kiki
Moore (16.8 ppg last year) and soph
omore Alex Sheedy (6.0 ppg) lead
Fresno State into Maples.

The Cardinal enters the season
ranked fourth in the nation, the sth
consecutive year that they have
been pegged as a top five-team. This
is also the 13th straight season that
the Card has been a clear favorite to
win the Pac-12, and they will get
plenty of media recognition this sea
son, as they are featured more than
any other team on the Pac-12
Networks.

The future success of this team,
however, is by no means guaran
teed, as the team is looking to
regroup after losing Nneka
Ogwumike to graduation.
Ogwumike was an All-American and
the No. 1 pick in the 2012 WNBA
Draft.
"Let's not sugarcoat it we

miss Nneka," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "We counted on one
player a lot last year, and this year
we're going to count a lot on a lot of
players."
The core of this year's team will
be comprised of Wade Trophy-can

didate and Chiney Ogwumike
Nneka's younger sister sopho
mores Amber Orrange and Taylor
Greenfield, senior Joslyn Tinkle and
junior Toni Kokenis, the likely
starters on the court.
VanDerveer will look to a variety

of players to fill the gaps in rebound
ing and defense left by Nneka
Ogwumike.
"Even though [sophomore for
ward] Erica Payne is small, she's

Senior Joslyn Tinkle will have one last chance to win a national title this year after three straight Final Four
appearances. That quest begins tonight in the season opener against Fresno State, as the Cardinal looks to
overcome the loss of top draft pick Nneka Ogwurmike with a younger core of starters playing with Tinkle.
aggressive when she gets in
there. We're also counting on
getting some rebounding
from someone like Taylor
[Greenfield] as a guard, or
someone like Bonnie
[Samuelson]," VanDerveer
said. "I think Bonnie has
improved her rebounding."
Orrange did an excellent
job defensively in the exhibi
tion game against Corban,
recording eight steals on the
night. Her presence at point
guard will be instrumental in
leading the team.
"I think she can compete
with any point guard in the

country.... As long as she's
confident, that makes us
super, super aggressive,
because defensively she's all
over the ball pressuring,"
Chiney Ogwumike said.
The exhibition game over
Vanguard also showed
VanDerveer that the team
needed to focus on defense
and rebounding in practice
before starting the season.

Freshman Tess Picknell
should be able to jump in and
grab rebounds off the bench.
Picknell, who is 6 foot 5 inch
es tall, is the Card's tallest
player and the biggest post
presence on a team that has
good size but less authority
in the paint.
The coaches also expect a
lot out of Samuelson. As the
sixth man off the bench, they

are confident that she will be
more than just the three
point specialist of last year.
With a young team that
has loads of talent,
VanDerveer expects there to
be an 11-player rotation to
start the season off "until the
players start to separate
themselves." In the past,
Stanford has relied on only
seven or eight players to con
sistently contribute through
out the season. VanDerveer
says that an early rotation
should help "complete the
puzzle."

The glue of this Stanford
team, however, lies in the vet
eran partnership of
Ogwumike and Tinkle.
"Chiney and I have a very
close, really special friend
ship bond, and it portrays

over on the basketball court
as well, because we want to
play hard for each other and
we know that we have to not
only rely on each other, but
on ourselves," Tinkle said.
"We're held accountable to
help lead this team and take
it where we want to go."
This season, Tinkle real
izes that she will have to step
up her rebounding and
aggression, and Ogwumike
says she is focused on getting
her hands onto every loose
ball as well as on blocking out
defensively.

The Card takes on the
Bulldogs tonight in the sea
son opener at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.

Coming off of two decisive exhi
bition victories last week, the
Stanford women's basketball team
is primed and ready to start the
2012-13 regular season campaign.
The No. 4 Cardinal opens the season
tonight against the Fresno State
Bulldogs hoping to continue its dom
inance in season openers. It has
been a decade since Stanford lost its
first game of the year.
It won't be a walk in the park
against the Bulldogs, who won the
Western Athletic Conference last
year but are now part of Mountain
West Conference and are pegged to
finish fourth. Preseason All-
Mountain West selections Kiki
Moore (16.8 ppg last year) and soph
omore Alex Sheedy (6.0 ppg) lead
Fresno State into Maples.

The Cardinal enters the season
ranked fourth in the nation, the sth
consecutive year that they have
been pegged as a top five-team. This
is also the 13th straight season that
the Card has been a clear favorite to
win the Pac-12, and they will get
plenty of media recognition this sea
son, as they are featured more than
any other team on the Pac-12
Networks.

The future success of this team,
however, is by no means guaran
teed, as the team is looking to
regroup after losing Nneka
Ogwumike to graduation.
Ogwumike was an All-American and
the No. 1 pick in the 2012 WNBA
Draft.
"Let's not sugarcoat it we

miss Nneka," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "We counted on one
player a lot last year, and this year
we're going to count a lot on a lot of
players."
The core of this year's team will
be comprised of Wade Trophy-can

didate and Chiney Ogwumike
Nneka's younger sister sopho
mores Amber Orrange and Taylor
Greenfield, senior Joslyn Tinkle and
junior Toni Kokenis, the likely
starters on the court.
VanDerveer will look to a variety

of players to fill the gaps in rebound
ing and defense left by Nneka
Ogwumike.
"Even though [sophomore for
ward] Erica Payne is small, she's

Senior Joslyn Tinkle will have one last chance to win a national title this year after three straight Final Four
appearances. That quest begins tonight in the season opener against Fresno State, as the Cardinal looks to
overcome the loss of top draft pick Nneka Ogwurmike with a younger core of starters playing with Tinkle.
aggressive when she gets in
there. We're also counting on
getting some rebounding
from someone like Taylor
[Greenfield] as a guard, or
someone like Bonnie
[Samuelson]," VanDerveer
said. "I think Bonnie has
improved her rebounding."
Orrange did an excellent
job defensively in the exhibi
tion game against Corban,
recording eight steals on the
night. Her presence at point
guard will be instrumental in
leading the team.
"I think she can compete
with any point guard in the

country.... As long as she's
confident, that makes us
super, super aggressive,
because defensively she's all
over the ball pressuring,"
Chiney Ogwumike said.
The exhibition game over
Vanguard also showed
VanDerveer that the team
needed to focus on defense
and rebounding in practice
before starting the season.

Freshman Tess Picknell
should be able to jump in and
grab rebounds off the bench.
Picknell, who is 6 foot 5 inch
es tall, is the Card's tallest
player and the biggest post
presence on a team that has
good size but less authority
in the paint.
The coaches also expect a
lot out of Samuelson. As the
sixth man off the bench, they

are confident that she will be
more than just the three
point specialist of last year.
With a young team that
has loads of talent,
VanDerveer expects there to
be an 11-player rotation to
start the season off "until the
players start to separate
themselves." In the past,
Stanford has relied on only
seven or eight players to con
sistently contribute through
out the season. VanDerveer
says that an early rotation
should help "complete the
puzzle."

The glue of this Stanford
team, however, lies in the vet
eran partnership of
Ogwumike and Tinkle.
"Chiney and I have a very
close, really special friend
ship bond, and it portrays

over on the basketball court
as well, because we want to
play hard for each other and
we know that we have to not
only rely on each other, but
on ourselves," Tinkle said.
"We're held accountable to
help lead this team and take
it where we want to go."
This season, Tinkle real
izes that she will have to step
up her rebounding and
aggression, and Ogwumike
says she is focused on getting
her hands onto every loose
ball as well as on blocking out
defensively.

The Card takes on the
Bulldogs tonight in the sea
son opener at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion.
