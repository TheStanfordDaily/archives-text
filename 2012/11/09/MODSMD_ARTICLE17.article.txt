# SEASON OPENS AT MAPLES
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off of two decisive exhi
bition victories last week, the
Stanford women's basketball team
is primed and ready to start the
2012-13 regular season campaign.
The No. 4 Cardinal opens the season
tonight against the Fresno State
Bulldogs hoping to continue its dom
inance in season openers. It has
been a decade since Stanford lost its
first game of the year.
It won't be a walk in the park
against the Bulldogs, who won the
Western Athletic Conference last
year but are now part of Mountain
West Conference and are pegged to
finish fourth. Preseason All-
Mountain West selections Kiki
Moore (16.8 ppg last year) and soph
omore Alex Sheedy (6.0 ppg) lead
Fresno State into Maples.

The Cardinal enters the season
ranked fourth in the nation, the sth
consecutive year that they have
been pegged as a top five-team. This
is also the 13th straight season that
the Card has been a clear favorite to
win the Pac-12, and they will get
plenty of media recognition this sea
son, as they are featured more than
any other team on the Pac-12
Networks.

The future success of this team,
however, is by no means guaran
teed, as the team is looking to
regroup after losing Nneka
Ogwumike to graduation.
Ogwumike was an All-American and
the No. 1 pick in the 2012 WNBA
Draft.
"Let's not sugarcoat it we

miss Nneka," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "We counted on one
player a lot last year, and this year
we're going to count a lot on a lot of
players."
The core of this year's team will
be comprised of Wade Trophy-can

didate and Chiney Ogwumike
Nneka's younger sister sopho
mores Amber Orrange and Taylor
Greenfield, senior Joslyn Tinkle and
junior Toni Kokenis, the likely
starters on the court.
VanDerveer will look to a variety

of players to fill the gaps in rebound
ing and defense left by Nneka
Ogwumike.

Senior Joslyn Tinkle will have one last chance to win a national title this year after three straight Final Four
appearances. That quest begins tonight in the season opener against Fresno State, as the Cardinal looks to
overcome the loss of top draft pick Nneka Ogwurmike with a younger core of starters playing with Tinkle.
