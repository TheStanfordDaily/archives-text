# Men's basketball opens season tonight in Oakland
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The last game the Stanford
men's basketball team played that
counted was during NIT Finals in
New York's Madison Square
Garden. Seven months after win
ning that tournament, the Cardinal
will open its 2012-13 campaign with
another matchup in an NBA venue
when it meets San Francisco tonight
at Oracle Arena in Oakland.
Since last March, Stanford has
graduated guard Jarrett Mann as
well as big men Josh Owens,
Andrew Zimmermann and Jack
Trotter. Junior Dwight Powell and
senior Stefan Nastic will look to fill
that void in the key, though neither
appeared in Sunday's exhibition win
against UNC Pembroke.
The Cardinal's three freshmen
center Grant Verhoeven, forward
Rosco Allen and guard Christian
Sanders all appeared in that
exhibition, shooting a combined 5
for 8 with five rebounds.
San Francisco is fresh off its first
20-win season in 30 years and will
play Stanford for the first time since
2005.

Junior guard Aaron Bright was
Stanford's second-leading scorer
a season ago with 11.7 points
per game. He will be a key piece
of a Cardinal team hoping to
make the NCAA Tournament.
