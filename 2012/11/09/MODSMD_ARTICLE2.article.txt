# NEW BLOOD
## Hogan starts with Rose Bowl hopes on the line 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On a chilly, rainy day in Corvallis,
Ore. around this time last year,
Andrew Luck didn't need to be in
his usual flawless form for Stanford
to drop lowly Oregon State 38-13. It
might have been a trap game for the Cardinal, but
it was the Beavers who were left trapped when
the four quarters were over.
Sandwiched between Stanford's triple-over
time thriller against USC and the crushing loss to
Oregon, the game was a mere afterthought in the
grand scheme of things. The paths travelled by
the two teams last season couldn't have contrast
ed more; the Cardinal wound up earning its sec
ond straight BCS bowl berth while the Beavers
would finish second-to-last in the Pac-12 North
and miss the postseason.
What a difference a year can make.
This time around, everything is on the line for
both programs: Pac-12 North title goals, confer
ence championship dreams and Rose Bowl aspi
rations. A victory for Oregon State would be the
cherry on top of its remarkable turnaround under
head coach Mike Riley. A victory for Stanford
would not only affirm its ability to beat the
nation's elites —no Luck needed but also
maintain its status as a rising powerhouse.
In a marquee matchup pitting two of the best
defenses in the country, No. 14 Stanford (7-2, 4-1
Pac-12) plays host to Oregon State (7-1, 5-1)
tomorrow in what is a de facto semifinal game for
the Pac-12 North Division title.
"They are the quintessential Mike Riley
team," head coach David Shaw said of Oregon
State. "They're efficient. They're not out of posi
tion. You don't see them giving up a whole bunch
of big plays. Defensively, they run to the ball, they
don't break contain. They don't make mistakes."
The Cardinal and the Beavers might be the two
most similar teams in a conference that places so
much emphasis on high-octane offenses.
Stanford and Oregon State boast defenses
that are ranked first and second respectively in
the conference in both scoring defense and rush
ing defense. In fact, the Cardinal sits atop the
country in run defense (55.6 yards per game),
sacks (4.4 per game) and tackles for loss (9.2 per
game). The Beavers also aren't too far behind on

the national stage, with a rush
defense (91.8 per game) that is
ranked fifth overall.
While the Cardinal's infamous
front seven has left opposing offens
es quaking in their boots on a week
ly basis, the team's secondary is also
shaping up. True freshman Alex
Carter has quickly developed into a
hard-hitting cornerback, comple
menting sophomore Jordan Richards'
sound tackling play at strong safety,
which has been critical in defending
against both the pass and the run.
But the one player who has stood
out above everyone else is junior
free safety Ed Reynolds, the dan
gerous ball hawk who currently
leads in the nation in total intercep
tion yards (221) and pick sixes (3).
"There are some things you can't
teach," said Shaw. "You can't teach
instincts, you can't teach anticipa
tion. You teach guys scheme and you
tell them where to go. But Ed does a
great job of reading the quarter
back's eyes and understanding route
concepts."
Oregon State has a playmaking
Reynolds of its own. The lockdown
corner duo of Rashaad Reynolds and
Jordan Poyer has taken care of busi
ness all year, with Rashaad Reynolds
fifth in the nation in passes defended
(1.75 per game) and Poyer leading
the country in interceptions per game
(0.71). Poyer sat out last week against
Arizona State with a knee injury, but
is expected to start tomorrow.
"I liked to talk about [Oregon
Sate] the same way I talk about our
team," Shaw said. "Tough and
aggressive. They don't waver; they
don't change depending on the score.
They play hard the whole game. I
told my team [on Monday], 'You're
going to have to beat a team like this.
They're not going to give you the
game.'"

Up front, defensive end Scott
Crichton has turned into a force to
be reckoned with. The sophomore
All-American candidate has already
recorded nine sacks seventh in
the country —to go along with 14
tackles made for a loss.

"They don't give up a ton of
plays," commented Shaw. "They
play extremely hard, and they'll hit
your quarterback. You can't take a
play off blocking somebody because
they'll beat you because they don't
ever stop."
Adding further to the similarities
between Stanford and Oregon State
is the recent changes at the quarter

back position for both teams.
Shaw announced on Tuesday that
redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan,
who completed 18 of 23 passes for
184 yards and two touchdowns in the
Cardinal's 48-0 blowout of Colorado
last weekend, will be the starting
quarterback against the Beavers.
"There's no misconception that
we're going to take the entire game
plan and throw it on a redshirt fresh
man's shoulders," Shaw said. "But
[Hogan's] shown that he can handle
enough of our game plan that we
don't have to change what we do."
Even players on the other side of
the ball have voiced their faith in
Hogan.
"The boy can sling it," said senior
inside linebacker Jarek Lancaster,
who tallied two sacks against the
Buffaloes. "I don't see that changing.
If anything, he's got more confidence

now that he's playing in the big
games. I expect a lot in this game."
Senior running back Stepfan
Taylor is expected to see more action
after getting some important rest last
Saturday. Just 53 yards away from a
school record of three consecutive
1,000-yard rushing seasons, Taylor
has come through during crunch time
for the Cardinal all season.

"[Taylor's] been carrying the ball
a lot," said Shaw. "And we don't run a
whole bunch of fly sweeps; we run
between the tackles. We wanted to
get the other guys in the field some
time and give Stepfan a rest."
For the Beavers, it's Cody Vaz
who has become the new signal
caller. After filling in for an injured
Sean Mannion, Vaz eventually won
the job following Mannion's awful
four-interception performance
against Washington State, which

handed the Beavers their only loss of
the season so far.
"Mannion was playing at such a
high level, you'd figure there was
going to be a drop-off," Shaw said.
"But [Vaz] came in and won a big game
for them. It didn't seem like he was a
young kid coming in and just throwing
stuff against the wall....He's been
very effective running the offense."
Vaz has plenty of weapons to work
with, starting with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton.
Forming one of the most prolific wide
receiver combinations in the country,
Cooks is seventh in the nation in
receiving yards per game (113.3)
while Wheaton is 13th (98.4). Other
than West Virginia, Oregon State is
the only team in the country with two
receivers ranked in the top 13.
"[Oregon State] is fast," said
Lancaster. "Those Oregon teams,

they've got some speed. We know
that, but I'm pretty excited about see
ing how we match up with them. I feel
like we've got a very, very good front
seven, and we've got some great pass
coverage, so we'll see just how well
their offense does against us."
Tomorrow's game is Senior Day
for the Cardinal. In keeping with
tradition, the players in their last
year of eligibility will make "The
Walk," marking the final time that
they will enter Stanford Stadium.
"It's going to be a heck of a col
lege football game," Shaw said.
Stanford and Oregon State clash
tomorrow in one of the biggest Pac
-12 matchups of the season. Kickoff is
at 12 p.m., with television coverage

Saturday. Just 53 yards away from a
school record of three consecutive
1,000-yard rushing seasons, Taylor
has come through during crunch time
for the Cardinal all season.

"[Taylor's] been carrying the ball
a lot," said Shaw. "And we don't run a
whole bunch of fly sweeps; we run
between the tackles. We wanted to
get the other guys in the field some
time and give Stepfan a rest."
For the Beavers, it's Cody Vaz
who has become the new signal
caller. After filling in for an injured
Sean Mannion, Vaz eventually won
the job following Mannion's awful
four-interception performance
against Washington State, which

handed the Beavers their only loss of
the season so far.
"Mannion was playing at such a
high level, you'd figure there was
going to be a drop-off," Shaw said.
"But [Vaz] came in and won a big game
for them. It didn't seem like he was a
young kid coming in and just throwing
stuff against the wall....He's been
very effective running the offense."
Vaz has plenty of weapons to work
with, starting with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton.
Forming one of the most prolific wide
receiver combinations in the country,
Cooks is seventh in the nation in
receiving yards per game (113.3)
while Wheaton is 13th (98.4). Other
than West Virginia, Oregon State is
the only team in the country with two
receivers ranked in the top 13.
"[Oregon State] is fast," said
Lancaster. "Those Oregon teams,

they've got some speed. We know
that, but I'm pretty excited about see
ing how we match up with them. I feel
like we've got a very, very good front
seven, and we've got some great pass
coverage, so we'll see just how well
their offense does against us."
Tomorrow's game is Senior Day
for the Cardinal. In keeping with
tradition, the players in their last
year of eligibility will make "The
Walk," marking the final time that
they will enter Stanford Stadium.
"It's going to be a heck of a col

ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Senior tight end Levine Toilolo was called on to make a tackle after an interception at Cal, but he usually makes his hay with leaping catches,
nabbing one for quarterback Kevin Hogan last week at Colorado. The Hogan-Toilolo connection will be a weapon for Stanford this weekend.
On a chilly, rainy day in Corvallis,
Ore. around this time last year,
Andrew Luck didn't need to be in
his usual flawless form for Stanford
to drop lowly Oregon State 38-13. It
might have been a trap game for the Cardinal, but
it was the Beavers who were left trapped when
the four quarters were over.
Sandwiched between Stanford's triple-over
time thriller against USC and the crushing loss to
Oregon, the game was a mere afterthought in the
grand scheme of things. The paths travelled by
the two teams last season couldn't have contrast
ed more; the Cardinal wound up earning its sec
ond straight BCS bowl berth while the Beavers
would finish second-to-last in the Pac-12 North
and miss the postseason.
What a difference a year can make.
This time around, everything is on the line for
both programs: Pac-12 North title goals, confer
ence championship dreams and Rose Bowl aspi
rations. A victory for Oregon State would be the
cherry on top of its remarkable turnaround under
head coach Mike Riley. A victory for Stanford
would not only affirm its ability to beat the
nation's elites —no Luck needed but also
maintain its status as a rising powerhouse.
In a marquee matchup pitting two of the best
defenses in the country, No. 14 Stanford (7-2, 4-1
Pac-12) plays host to Oregon State (7-1, 5-1)
tomorrow in what is a de facto semifinal game for
the Pac-12 North Division title.
"They are the quintessential Mike Riley
team," head coach David Shaw said of Oregon
State. "They're efficient. They're not out of posi
tion. You don't see them giving up a whole bunch
of big plays. Defensively, they run to the ball, they
don't break contain. They don't make mistakes."
The Cardinal and the Beavers might be the two
most similar teams in a conference that places so
much emphasis on high-octane offenses.
Stanford and Oregon State boast defenses
that are ranked first and second respectively in
the conference in both scoring defense and rush
ing defense. In fact, the Cardinal sits atop the
country in run defense (55.6 yards per game),
sacks (4.4 per game) and tackles for loss (9.2 per
game). The Beavers also aren't too far behind on

the national stage, with a rush
defense (91.8 per game) that is
ranked fifth overall.
While the Cardinal's infamous
front seven has left opposing offens
es quaking in their boots on a week
ly basis, the team's secondary is also
shaping up. True freshman Alex
Carter has quickly developed into a
hard-hitting cornerback, comple
menting sophomore Jordan Richards'
sound tackling play at strong safety,
which has been critical in defending
against both the pass and the run.
But the one player who has stood
out above everyone else is junior
free safety Ed Reynolds, the dan
gerous ball hawk who currently
leads in the nation in total intercep
tion yards (221) and pick sixes (3).
"There are some things you can't
teach," said Shaw. "You can't teach
instincts, you can't teach anticipa
tion. You teach guys scheme and you
tell them where to go. But Ed does a
great job of reading the quarter
back's eyes and understanding route
concepts."
Oregon State has a playmaking
Reynolds of its own. The lockdown
corner duo of Rashaad Reynolds and
Jordan Poyer has taken care of busi
ness all year, with Rashaad Reynolds
fifth in the nation in passes defended
(1.75 per game) and Poyer leading
the country in interceptions per game
(0.71). Poyer sat out last week against
Arizona State with a knee injury, but
is expected to start tomorrow.
"I liked to talk about [Oregon
Sate] the same way I talk about our
team," Shaw said. "Tough and
aggressive. They don't waver; they
don't change depending on the score.
They play hard the whole game. I
told my team [on Monday], 'You're
going to have to beat a team like this.
They're not going to give you the
game.'"

Up front, defensive end Scott
Crichton has turned into a force to
be reckoned with. The sophomore
All-American candidate has already
recorded nine sacks seventh in
the country —to go along with 14
tackles made for a loss.

"They don't give up a ton of
plays," commented Shaw. "They
play extremely hard, and they'll hit
your quarterback. You can't take a
play off blocking somebody because
they'll beat you because they don't
ever stop."
Adding further to the similarities
between Stanford and Oregon State
is the recent changes at the quarter

back position for both teams.
Shaw announced on Tuesday that
redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan,
who completed 18 of 23 passes for
184 yards and two touchdowns in the
Cardinal's 48-0 blowout of Colorado
last weekend, will be the starting
quarterback against the Beavers.
"There's no misconception that
we're going to take the entire game
plan and throw it on a redshirt fresh
man's shoulders," Shaw said. "But
[Hogan's] shown that he can handle
enough of our game plan that we
don't have to change what we do."
Even players on the other side of
the ball have voiced their faith in
Hogan.
"The boy can sling it," said senior
inside linebacker Jarek Lancaster,
who tallied two sacks against the
Buffaloes. "I don't see that changing.
If anything, he's got more confidence

now that he's playing in the big
games. I expect a lot in this game."
Senior running back Stepfan
Taylor is expected to see more action
after getting some important rest last
Saturday. Just 53 yards away from a
school record of three consecutive
1,000-yard rushing seasons, Taylor

instincts, you can't teach anticipa
tion. You teach guys scheme and you
tell them where to go. But Ed does a
great job of reading the quarter
back's eyes and understanding route
concepts."
Oregon State has a playmaking
Reynolds of its own. The lockdown
corner duo of Rashaad Reynolds and
Jordan Poyer has taken care of busi
ness all year, with Rashaad Reynolds
fifth in the nation in passes defended
(1.75 per game) and Poyer leading
the country in interceptions per game
(0.71). Poyer sat out last week against
Arizona State with a knee injury, but
is expected to start tomorrow.
"I liked to talk about [Oregon
Sate] the same way I talk about our
team," Shaw said. "Tough and
aggressive. They don't waver; they
don't change depending on the score.
They play hard the whole game. I
told my team [on Monday], 'You're
going to have to beat a team like this.
They're not going to give you the
game.'"

Up front, defensive end Scott
Crichton has turned into a force to
be reckoned with. The sophomore
All-American candidate has already
recorded nine sacks seventh in
the country —to go along with 14
tackles made for a loss.

"They don't give up a ton of
plays," commented Shaw. "They
play extremely hard, and they'll hit
your quarterback. You can't take a
play off blocking somebody because
they'll beat you because they don't
ever stop."
Adding further to the similarities
between Stanford and Oregon State
is the recent changes at the quarter

back position for both teams.
Shaw announced on Tuesday that
redshirt freshman Kevin Hogan,
who completed 18 of 23 passes for
184 yards and two touchdowns in the
Cardinal's 48-0 blowout of Colorado
last weekend, will be the starting
quarterback against the Beavers.
"There's no misconception that
we're going to take the entire game
plan and throw it on a redshirt fresh
man's shoulders," Shaw said. "But
[Hogan's] shown that he can handle
enough of our game plan that we
don't have to change what we do."
Even players on the other side of
the ball have voiced their faith in
Hogan.
"The boy can sling it," said senior
inside linebacker Jarek Lancaster,
who tallied two sacks against the
Buffaloes. "I don't see that changing.
If anything, he's got more confidence

now that he's playing in the big
games. I expect a lot in this game."
Senior running back Stepfan
Taylor is expected to see more action
after getting some important rest last
Saturday. Just 53 yards away from a
school record of three consecutive
1,000-yard rushing seasons, Taylor
has come through during crunch time
for the Cardinal all season.

"[Taylor's] been carrying the ball
a lot," said Shaw. "And we don't run a
whole bunch of fly sweeps; we run
between the tackles. We wanted to
get the other guys in the field some
time and give Stepfan a rest."
For the Beavers, it's Cody Vaz
who has become the new signal
caller. After filling in for an injured
Sean Mannion, Vaz eventually won
the job following Mannion's awful
four-interception performance
against Washington State, which

handed the Beavers their only loss of
the season so far.
"Mannion was playing at such a
high level, you'd figure there was
going to be a drop-off," Shaw said.
"But [Vaz] came in and won a big game
for them. It didn't seem like he was a
young kid coming in and just throwing
stuff against the wall....He's been
very effective running the offense."
Vaz has plenty of weapons to work
with, starting with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton.
Forming one of the most prolific wide
receiver combinations in the country,
Cooks is seventh in the nation in
receiving yards per game (113.3)
while Wheaton is 13th (98.4). Other
than West Virginia, Oregon State is
the only team in the country with two
receivers ranked in the top 13.
"[Oregon State] is fast," said
Lancaster. "Those Oregon teams,

they've got some speed. We know
that, but I'm pretty excited about see
ing how we match up with them. I feel
like we've got a very, very good front
seven, and we've got some great pass
coverage, so we'll see just how well
their offense does against us."
Tomorrow's game is Senior Day
for the Cardinal. In keeping with
tradition, the players in their last
year of eligibility will make "The
Walk," marking the final time that
they will enter Stanford Stadium.
"It's going to be a heck of a col
lege football game," Shaw said.
Stanford and Oregon State clash
tomorrow in one of the biggest Pac
-12 matchups of the season. Kickoff is
at 12 p.m., with television coverage
on Fox.

ROGER CHEN/The Stanford Daily
Senior tight end Levine Toilolo was called on to make a tackle after an interception at Cal, but he usually makes his hay with leaping catches,
nabbing one for quarterback Kevin Hogan last week at Colorado. The Hogan-Toilolo connection will be a weapon for Stanford this weekend.
