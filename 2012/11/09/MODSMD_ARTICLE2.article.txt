# NEW BLOOD
## Hogan starts with Rose Bowl hopes on the line 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
On a chilly, rainy day in Corvallis,
Ore. around this time last year,
Andrew Luck didn't need to be in
his usual flawless form for Stanford
to drop lowly Oregon State 38-13. It
might have been a trap game for the Cardinal, but
it was the Beavers who were left trapped when
the four quarters were over.
Sandwiched between Stanford's triple-over
time thriller against USC and the crushing loss to
Oregon, the game was a mere afterthought in the
grand scheme of things. The paths travelled by
the two teams last season couldn't have contrast
ed more; the Cardinal wound up earning its sec
ond straight BCS bowl berth while the Beavers
would finish second-to-last in the Pac-12 North
and miss the postseason.
What a difference a year can make.
This time around, everything is on the line for
both programs: Pac-12 North title goals, confer
ence championship dreams and Rose Bowl aspi
rations. A victory for Oregon State would be the
cherry on top of its remarkable turnaround under
head coach Mike Riley. A victory for Stanford
would not only affirm its ability to beat the
nation's elites â€”no Luck needed but also
maintain its status as a rising powerhouse.
In a marquee matchup pitting two of the best
defenses in the country, No. 14 Stanford (7-2, 4-1
Pac-12) plays host to Oregon State (7-1, 5-1)
tomorrow in what is a de facto semifinal game for
the Pac-12 North Division title.
"They are the quintessential Mike Riley
team," head coach David Shaw said of Oregon
State. "They're efficient. They're not out of posi
tion. You don't see them giving up a whole bunch
of big plays. Defensively, they run to the ball, they
don't break contain. They don't make mistakes."
The Cardinal and the Beavers might be the two
most similar teams in a conference that places so
much emphasis on high-octane offenses.
Stanford and Oregon State boast defenses
that are ranked first and second respectively in
the conference in both scoring defense and rush
ing defense. In fact, the Cardinal sits atop the
country in run defense (55.6 yards per game),
sacks (4.4 per game) and tackles for loss (9.2 per
game). The Beavers also aren't too far behind on
