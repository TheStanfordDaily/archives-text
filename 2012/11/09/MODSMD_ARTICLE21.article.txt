# AND ESPECIALLY LIFESTLYE
## Intermission DOES Lifestyle AND WE'RE DOIN' IT, DOIN'IT, DOIN'IT WELL 
### Sasha Arijanto | MANAGING EDITOR 
In our pessimistic, postmodern times,
change feels confined to Obama posters
and Beyonce videos. But true change has
taken over Intermission, and what was
once your beloved "Arts and
Entertainment section" now proudly
hosts all things cultural di Stanford. That's
right, we've gone Lifestyle.
Baffled ye may be, but those deceit
ful claims that "Stanford has no culture"
will be annulled faster than Kim's mar
riage. We're keeping our critic caps on
with film and music reviews, but we're
amping up our Stanford coverage, look
ing at what Stanford's doing. Not just stu
dent performers and artists, but profes
sors, visitors and our neighbors down
Palm Drive.
"But we already have a lifestyle sec
tion. It's called sports," you say. At such a
thought we throw our hashtag LOLs!
So far we've added profiles of student
groups, the Fresh Set -a feature of notable
Stanfordians, like student DJ Wiley
Webb— and our pages boast two regular
sex columns (but we're looking for more
perspectives, if you know what we mean).
And this issue premieres two more install
ments that hold the mirror up to
Stanford.
The first, Tattoo Tales will feature
one student's tattoo and all the inky
details. This week, Charlotte Camacho
gets the scoop on Tom Mallon's track
inspired tat. The second, Scene at
Stanford, marks the beginning of our
visual exhibition of Stanford people and
culture.
We've assembled a master team of
student photographers with lenses poised
to shoot residents of our fair Farm. We
hope to highlight the vibrant aesthetics of
students pedaling fixies down Santa
Theresa and plucking violins in the
CoHo. So buff those wing-tips and prac
tice your pucker, because, when post
apocalyptic Pangeans discover The Daily
Archives, will you want Stanford to only
be remembered for its clutch athletics and
blase sweatpants?
