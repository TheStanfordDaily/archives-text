## Tom Mallon's Track Tat 
### Charlotte Camacho | FELLOW 
Imagine running in an 800-meter race against a Stanford
student. Now imagine that student passing you, and, as you
struggle to keep up, seeing a USA Track and Field symbol
tattooed in sleek black across his upper back. Feel intimidated?
That's the point.
Tom Mallon 'l4, a native of Philadelphia, was tatted back
in 2010 during the spring of his freshman year on the Farm. A
pair of wings flanking a star adorns his back, nearly covering
his shoulder blades. He's been running since his freshman year
of high school and mainly competes in middle distances, like
the 800.
When Tom originally got the tat, his mom didn't buy his
unconvincing text message (interestingly sent on April Fools'
Day —the tattoo artist could have pulled a number of awfully
good pranks). So Tom waited until he got home from school,
and then revealed it to them. Although initially upset, his par
ents got used to the tattoo and became supportive, similar to
how they always have in the past about his track career.
When asked if he ever had regrets about the tattoo, Tom
chuckled and assured me that unless he allowed his back to get
saggy (which he seemed convinced would not happen), it
would always look good. Inspired by a shirt he used to wear
while running during high school, the tattoo was in the works
for a while before Tom actually followed through with his idea.
When asked why he got the tattoo, he reminded me of the
fact that all great athletes have times of weakness. Although
Tom was injured both his freshman and sophomore years, he
uses the tattoo to remind himself of his ultimate goal: to be on
the USA Track and Field team.
