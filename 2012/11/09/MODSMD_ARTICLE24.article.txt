# 'SKYFALL'
## BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO 'BOND' 
### Alex Bayer | STAFF WRITER 
kyfall" is the breath of fresh air
James Bond series needs after
V/ the dismal "Quantum of Solace."
But the movie's originality lies not in its
plot—Bond is up to his old tricks —but in
the nuanced execution.
It's not a perfect film. Like many
third acts, "Skyfall" is in part about Bond's
(Daniel Craig) resurrection. After a near
fatal fall during a botched assassination
attempt in Turkey, he rises from the ashes
(nursed, of course, by an attractive
woman) and returns to London unshaven,
alcoholic and out of shape. He's an old hat
in an intelligence world that's becoming
increasingly reliant on technology.
M (Judi Dench) is busy defending
Ml 6's relevance to the British government
when a crisis strikes: a hacker with a dark
sense of humor has infiltrated the agency's
ironclad database, exposing the identities
of active agents and putting them in peril.
Someone is out to get MI6, someone with
a personal vendetta against M—someone,
she says ominously, from within.
The pending doom of his agency
throws Bond on an expedition to
Shanghai, a visual playground director
Sam Mendes mines for its sensuality. Bond

stalks his target through a high-tech high
rise. All is silent. Cat and mouse are alter
nately illuminated, obscured and illumi
nated again in a floating dreamscape of
colors. In a hand-to-hand combat set, the
fighters' silhouettes are backlit by a sensu
ous blue jellyfish that gives way to twin
kling stars. Where the script fails in poetic
depth, Mendes compensates with stunning
visuals.
Though resplendent with beautiful
females (the femme fatale, the plucky
assistant; I will save my two cents on gen
der representation for another day), the
film hones in on Bond's relationship with
M, which in many ways is his most gen
uine. Bond also returns to his roots,
though not with the substance as one
would hope. Goldmember's origin story
was deeper than this.
The film scratches at the surface of
Bond's wounds, his exterior of invulnera
bility, but it never lets him truly break his
composure. That might have been a dif
ferent film, and an interesting one, akin to
what Christopher Nolan did with our
time's Bruce Wayne. The screenwriters
may have feared that it would take away
from Bond's untouchable coolness, but

more psychological spelunking wouldn't
hurt.
Part of the fun in challenging Bond is
that it brings out his icy wit. Probe anoth
er layer, past this famous defense mecha
nism—can he function without it? Can
Bond be as nuanced and vulnerable as
Bruce Wayne and still be Bond?
The plot is not as strong and cohe
sive as "Casino Royale," and you may leave
wishing the film had probed a few inches
deeper into Bond's wounds. Nevertheless,
it has what audiences missed in
"Quantum": British wit; the spunky,
blonde Javier Bardem as a villain (think a
more flamboyant, sassier version of his
"No Country for Old Men" psychopath);
and Ralph Fiennes.
Like Bond himself, "Skyfall" is an old
horse with new tricks (and some old: wel
come back, Aston Martin DBS). There are
shades of the Zeitgeist, including technolo
gy eclipsing the need for personnel and
Asia as a rising superpower. Sam Mendes
handles his material with the grace and
sophistication you expect of "Bond —
James Bond," and with arrestingly poetic
visuals, "Skyfall" does the Bond series a big
favor.
