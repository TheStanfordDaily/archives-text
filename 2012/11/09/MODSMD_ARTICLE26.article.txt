# U.S. POET LAUREATE
## NATASHA TRETHEWY CRUSADER OF HER CRAFT 
### Emma Townley-Smith | FELLOW 
The woman sitting next to me
leaned in. "Do you think I
could talk to her?"
We watched the poet from a few
rows back as she spoke with creative
writing faculty and set up for her Q&A
session. Over the course of an hour,
U.S. Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey
fielded questions about history, her
writing process and discussions of race
and ethnicity in the classroom.
"Sure," I replied. "Isn't that what
she's here for?"
The key task of the Poet Laureate,
a title bestowed upon Trethewey this
year, is to make the reading and writing
of poetry more accessible to a larger
audience. Trethewey draws equally
from history and from her personal
experiences, using human detail and
emotion to inform our understanding
of our nation's past. She uses the con
text of the Civil War or the casta paint
ings of colonial Mexico for what Eavan
Boland, director of the Creative Writing
Program, described as "a dialogue of
belonging and not belonging" amidst
the "complications of race and memo
ry."
Trethewey credited much of the
evolution of her latest book of poems,
"Thrall," to "serendipity" She promoted
poetry as a means for her "to deal with
what seems unspeakable," whether that
meant the domestic violence of the
Civil War or the domestic violence of
her own childhood. She spoke of writ
ing as a method of "convergence"—a
way for her to connect a "quarrel with
the nation" to a quarrel within herself.
Prior to being named poet laure

ate, Trethewey was Poet Laureate of
Mississippi, won a Pulitzer for her col
lection "Native Guard" and holds a
professorship at Emory University.
Later this school year, she will take
up residence in Washington, D.C. to
work on her own projects nationwide
and in cooperation with the Library of
Congress. At 46, she is among the
youngest poets to be appointed to the
position.
Tobias Wolff, novelist and profes
sor of English, prompted Trethewey to
share with her audience what she
planned to do with the "bully pulpit" of
U.S. Poet Laureate, arguably one of the
most influential positions for a poet to
hold in the modern age. Trethewey said
that she was looking forward to contin
uing her exploration of historical
memory and erasure, and hoped that
she could encourage more people to
become involved with poetry, whether
or not they liked her as the messenger
of such a pursuit.
When asked for a message for the
larger Stanford community, Trethewey
had one: "Read more poetry!"
