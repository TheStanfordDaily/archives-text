MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 31, OREGON STATE
21 :I didn't show enough faith in the Stanford
offense last week, underselling the Kevin
Hogan hype even against a downright awful
Colorado defense. This week, I'm saying
Hogan and Co. do it again. It's Senior Day on
the Farm, and if I know my classmates
Shayne, Kulabafi, Zach, Benny G, Trent, Josh,
Drew, Brent, Jerek, Levine and more, they will
be fired UP to get a chance to make a state
ment that Stanford Football is here to stay. The
Card is only favored by 4.5 because the
Beavers are legit, but Stanford always covers
at home. Oregon State doesn't have Sean
Mannion this week, and that's big because
Cody Vaz has yet to be really tested and the
Cardinal defense is elite. I don't think Hogan
will be able to find as many open targets as he
did against the Buffs, but look for Taylor to take
advantage of the Beavers' inside pressure to
bounce a few outside. If Hogan finds the tight
ends at all, I believe that Stanford is headed to
Autzen with a chance to smell roses.

STANFORD 34, OREGON STATE
13: Oregon State is a good football team,
but I just don't know how good they really are.
I've got a funny feeling that Stanford is going
to drop some jaws this week. The team is
revitalized under Kevin Hogan. It's a fresh
start and a new beginning for the toughest
three-game stretch of the season, and I think
Stanford's going to start it off with a bang.
Stanford's defense gets to Cody Vaz early
and often, Kevin Hogan plays out of his mind
and Stepfan Taylor becomes the first player in
Stanford history to rush for 1,000 yards three
consecutive years on Senior Day. Stanford
crushes Oregon State and sends the Beavers
back to Corvallis without a stop at In-N-Out.
Stanford by three touchdowns, 34-13.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 24, OREGON STATE 20:
A week ago, I would've picked Oregon State to
win this game hands-down. Stanford's offense
was running more inefficiently than a Hummer
and the only reason why the team escaped
Washington State was because of clutch defense.
But things have changed. With Kevin Hogan as
the new signal-caller, the team adds a much
needed dimension, with his scrambling abilities
that keep a defense honest. The Beavers have
one of the best defenses in the nation, but Hogan
will find away to make some big plays. The red
shirt freshman throws for over 250 yards and a
touchdown, while also reaching the end zone
once with his feet. Stanford's defense makes
Cody Vaz uncomfortable in the pocket, especially
early in the game, but Vaz mounts a late rally that
falls just short. With Pac-12 North title and Rose
Bowl hopes at stake, both teams will play well. But
Stanford finds away to make one fewer mistake
and rises as the main contender to challenge
Oregon's Pac-12 supremacy.
