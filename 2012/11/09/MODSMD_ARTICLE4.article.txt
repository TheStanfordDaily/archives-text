# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU buffer fund larger than peers' 
### JUSTINE MOORE OLIVIA MOORE 
During a time of funding shortfalls for uni
versities and student groups across the coun
try, the ASSU has not only avoided running a
deficit, but has continued to add to its $1.2 mil
lion general fees reserves and buffer funds
in large part because it seldom fully spends
the money it receives from student fees.
According to ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the ASSU col
lected about $3 million this year from student

fees for undergraduates, this means $l4O
per student per quarter. Approximately $2.25
million was allocated through special fees and
$650,000 was left for the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC) to
allocate to groups through the general fees
funding process.
According to Trusheim, one-third of general
fees and special fees go unused or unallocated
every year. This surplus can occur when a spe
cial fees or general fees group does not spend
its entire budget or when the Senate does not
allocate the entire general fees fund.

The leftover money goes into a general
reserve fund or a specific organization's
reserves, depending on whether the funds were
collected through general fees or special fees.
"I think that student money that comes in
every year should be spent for the benefit of the
students who pay it," Trusheim said. "In an
ideal world, we would spend all the money that
we brought in every year."
Current ASSU finance projections predict
that the undergraduate general fee reserve
funds will total $863,606 by the end of
the 2012 fiscal year. The general fee
reserves have grown by an average
of $67,240 every year since 2007.
The ASSU also has buffer funds,
which are maintained by charging
students an extra 5 to 10 percent
more than what is actually necessary
to fund special fees groups each year.
This ensures that the groups will
have adequate funding even if enroll
ment fluctuates or an unusually large
number of students apply for fee
waivers, which every student is
allowed to do.

According to data provided by
Trusheim, the Undergraduate Buffer
Rmd grew from $301,909 at the end
of the 2006 fiscal year- to $559,440 at
the end of the 2011 fiscal year an
increase of over $250,000.

Some of Stanford's peer institu
tions charge a much smaller student
fee. Harvard's Undergraduate
Council charges an annual $75 stu
dent activities fee, and UC Berkeley's
Associated Students of the University
of California (ASUC) charges an
annual fee of $55. Stanford under
graduates pay a fee of about $420 per
year.

Trusheim said that part of the rea
son why Stanford's fees are so high
compared to other schools is that
Stanford's system allows for student
groups to apply for money from stu
dents, instead of the entire budget
being allocated by the legislative
body. He said that this distinction is
"reflective of Stanford's entrepre
neurial culture."

"It leads to higher student fees,
but maybe those higher student fees
contribute to better student life,"
Trusheim said.

Harvard, Princeton and UC
Berkeley's student governments typ
ically spend all of their annual rev

enues from student activities fees and
have less money in their reserves.
Harvard's Undergraduate
Council has $73.82 in their reserve
fund for the 2012-2013 academic year,
according to the council's budget
information. While they held several
thousand dollars in their reserves in
previous years, it was largely spent
last year.

The student governments of both
Harvard and Princeton spent their
entire budget last year.
"We try to spend all the money
because that is what is best for the
students," said Princeton USG
Treasurer Lillian Cartwright in a
statement.

UC Berkeley's student govern
ment, which has a policy of spending
all of the approximately $1.6 million
that it collects from student fees
each year, recently announced a
budget deficit of $50,000 because it
allocated too much money to student
groups during the spring allocation
process.

Although the ASUC could dip
into its $400,000 reserves fund or liq
uidate the approximately $2.7 million
it holds in real estate and invest
ments, ASUC Finance Officer Amir
Chini said that this would only be
done as a last resort. He also
expressed concern that the reserves
fund had been depleted at an unsus
tainable rate, as the ASUC has been
running a deficit for several years.
"Right now, the situation is not
dire, but people in the ASUC are
worried because they don't want to
give up more power," he said.

Stanford's GSC has also been
depleting its reserves, but as part of a
strategic policy enacted in 2007. The
size of their general reserve fund has
decreased from $572,267 at the end of
2006 to $396,998 at the end of 2011, as
the GSC has pulled money from
reserves to fund more student events
without increasing the student fee.
"There is a benefit in responsibly
using the general fee reserves to fund
increased levels of programming,"

Trusheim said.
He predicted that the GSC could
continue this policy for seven to 10
years before their ftind depletes.
"They are doing the best that
they can," he said. "[The GSC plan to
use its reserves] was a good policy
back in 2007, and it remains a good
policy today."
Trusheim said that he would not
necessarily recommend that the
Undergraduate Senate adopt the
same policy, but said the Senate
should consider it as an option for
reducing the size of the reserves.
After attending an ASSU finance
presentation hosted by Trusheim and
Stanford Student Enterprises CEO
Neveen Mahmoud 'll, senators
expressed their desire to take advan
tage of the reserve and buffer funds.
They do not currently have any spe
cific plans for the money.

every year. This surplus can occur when a spe
cial fees or general fees group does not spend
its entire budget or when the Senate does not
allocate the entire general fees fund.

The leftover money goes into a general
reserve fund or a specific organization's
reserves, depending on whether the funds were
collected through general fees or special fees.
"I think that student money that comes in
every year should be spent for the benefit of the
students who pay it," Trusheim said. "In an
ideal world, we would spend all the money that
we brought in every year."
Current ASSU finance projections predict
that the undergraduate general fee reserve
funds will total $863,606 by the end of
the 2012 fiscal year. The general fee
reserves have grown by an average
of $67,240 every year since 2007.
The ASSU also has buffer funds,
which are maintained by charging
students an extra 5 to 10 percent
more than what is actually necessary
to fund special fees groups each year.
This ensures that the groups will
have adequate funding even if enroll
ment fluctuates or an unusually large
number of students apply for fee
waivers, which every student is
allowed to do.

According to data provided by
Trusheim, the Undergraduate Buffer
Rmd grew from $301,909 at the end
of the 2006 fiscal year- to $559,440 at
the end of the 2011 fiscal year an
increase of over $250,000.

Some of Stanford's peer institu
tions charge a much smaller student
fee. Harvard's Undergraduate
Council charges an annual $75 stu
dent activities fee, and UC Berkeley's
Associated Students of the University
of California (ASUC) charges an
annual fee of $55. Stanford under
graduates pay a fee of about $420 per
year.

Trusheim said that part of the rea
son why Stanford's fees are so high
compared to other schools is that
Stanford's system allows for student
groups to apply for money from stu
dents, instead of the entire budget
being allocated by the legislative
body. He said that this distinction is
"reflective of Stanford's entrepre
neurial culture."

"It leads to higher student fees,
but maybe those higher student fees
contribute to better student life,"
Trusheim said.

Harvard, Princeton and UC
Berkeley's student governments typ
ically spend all of their annual rev

enues from student activities fees and
have less money in their reserves.
Harvard's Undergraduate
Council has $73.82 in their reserve
fund for the 2012-2013 academic year,
according to the council's budget
information. While they held several
thousand dollars in their reserves in
previous years, it was largely spent
last year.

The student governments of both
Harvard and Princeton spent their
entire budget last year.
"We try to spend all the money
because that is what is best for the
students," said Princeton USG
Treasurer Lillian Cartwright in a
statement.

UC Berkeley's student govern
ment, which has a policy of spending
all of the approximately $1.6 million
that it collects from student fees
each year, recently announced a
budget deficit of $50,000 because it
allocated too much money to student
groups during the spring allocation
process.

Although the ASUC could dip
into its $400,000 reserves fund or liq
uidate the approximately $2.7 million
it holds in real estate and invest
ments, ASUC Finance Officer Amir
Chini said that this would only be
done as a last resort. He also
expressed concern that the reserves
fund had been depleted at an unsus
tainable rate, as the ASUC has been
running a deficit for several years.
"Right now, the situation is not
dire, but people in the ASUC are
worried because they don't want to
give up more power," he said.

Stanford's GSC has also been
depleting its reserves, but as part of a
strategic policy enacted in 2007. The
size of their general reserve fund has
decreased from $572,267 at the end of
2006 to $396,998 at the end of 2011, as
the GSC has pulled money from
reserves to fund more student events
without increasing the student fee.
"There is a benefit in responsibly
using the general fee reserves to fund
increased levels of programming,"

Trusheim said.
He predicted that the GSC could
continue this policy for seven to 10
years before their ftind depletes.
"They are doing the best that
they can," he said. "[The GSC plan to
use its reserves] was a good policy
back in 2007, and it remains a good
policy today."
Trusheim said that he would not
necessarily recommend that the
Undergraduate Senate adopt the
same policy, but said the Senate
should consider it as an option for
reducing the size of the reserves.
After attending an ASSU finance
presentation hosted by Trusheim and
Stanford Student Enterprises CEO
Neveen Mahmoud 'll, senators
expressed their desire to take advan
tage of the reserve and buffer funds.
They do not currently have any spe
cific plans for the money.

During a time of funding shortfalls for uni
versities and student groups across the coun
try, the ASSU has not only avoided running a
deficit, but has continued to add to its $1.2 mil
lion general fees reserves and buffer funds
in large part because it seldom fully spends
the money it receives from student fees.
According to ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the ASSU col
lected about $3 million this year from student

fees for undergraduates, this means $l4O
per student per quarter. Approximately $2.25
million was allocated through special fees and
$650,000 was left for the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC) to
allocate to groups through the general fees
funding process.
According to Trusheim, one-third of general
fees and special fees go unused or unallocated
every year. This surplus can occur when a spe
