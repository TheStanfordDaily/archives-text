# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU buffer fund larger than peers' 
### JUSTINE MOORE OLIVIA MOORE 
During a time of funding shortfalls for uni
versities and student groups across the coun
try, the ASSU has not only avoided running a
deficit, but has continued to add to its $1.2 mil
lion general fees reserves and buffer funds
in large part because it seldom fully spends
the money it receives from student fees.
According to ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the ASSU col
lected about $3 million this year from student

fees for undergraduates, this means $l4O
per student per quarter. Approximately $2.25
million was allocated through special fees and
$650,000 was left for the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council (GSC) to
allocate to groups through the general fees
funding process.
According to Trusheim, one-third of general
fees and special fees go unused or unallocated
every year. This surplus can occur when a spe
cial fees or general fees group does not spend
its entire budget or when the Senate does not
allocate the entire general fees fund.

The leftover money goes into a general
reserve fund or a specific organization's
reserves, depending on whether the funds were
collected through general fees or special fees.
"I think that student money that comes in
every year should be spent for the benefit of the
students who pay it," Trusheim said. "In an
ideal world, we would spend all the money that
we brought in every year."
