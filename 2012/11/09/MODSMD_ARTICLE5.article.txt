## $10.4 million trail proposal up for vote 
### SABELLE SMYTHE 
On Nov. 20, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors will vote on five
proposals one of which is backed by
Stanford University for spending
$10.4 million in Stanford University
funds, capping off a 12-year debate over
the funding.
In conjunction with the City of Palo
Alto, Stanford has proposed building an
8.5-mile trail network, portions of which
would be located on campus, with the
funding. If approved, the project would
involve building a new bicycle boulevard

and a bicycle and pedestrian bridge
over Highway 101 in addition to con
structing new trails and improving
old ones.
Some involved with the project
feel that the other plans, which pri
marily involve updating trails and
other recreational facilities in the
area, fail to satisfy the conditions of
the agreement with Santa Clara
County because their distance from
campus will prevent campus resi
dents from regularly using them for
recreation.
"We actually don't think any of
the competing proposals satisfy the
conditions of the contract at all,"
said James Sweeney Ph.D. '7l, pro
fessor of management sciences and
engineering and president of
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders (SCRL), a community
organization of homeowners on the
Stanford campus. "We think some
times people from campus may use
them, but it won't be regularly used
recreation."

Because SCRL does not have
the requisite nonprofit status to
submit an independent proposal for
the money, it is partnering with the
University and the City of Palo Alto.
On Nov. 2, Sweeney, Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, Palo
Alto Vice Mayor Greg Scharff and
Palo Alto School Board President
Camille Townsend cosigned an open
letter to the community that
encouraged people to contact the
Santa Clara Board of Supervisors
to support the University-backed
proposal.
"It's rare to see such unanimous
community support," said Larry
Horton '62 M.A.'66, senior associate
vice president and director of gov
ernment and community relations
for Stanford University. The pro
posal is also backed by local law
enforcement, Palo Alto Unified
School District and a number of
area businesses.
The controversy surrounding
the trail dates back to 2000, when
Santa Clara County issued a new
General Use Permit (GUP) to
Stanford, allowing the University
over two million square feet in new
and expanded buildings. As one of
the conditions of the permit,

Stanford agreed to provide funds
to build two trails, the SI trail and
the CI trail, along the perimeter of
campus lands.
"There was a group of people
that wanted to reopen the question
of where the trails are, and they
wanted to put the trails on the mid
dle of our land," Horton said.
"Well, we didn't like that."
After nearly six years of
debate, Stanford signed the
Agreement for Trail Easements,
Construction Management, and
Maintenance and Grant of
Easements, or Trail Agreement,
which placed the trails at their ini
tial location along the perimeter of
campus.
The SI trail, located entirely on
Stanford lands, was built soon
thereafter. The CI trail encoun
tered further difficulties. Its pro
posed route passed through four
jurisdictions Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, unincorporated San Mateo
County and Portola Valley and
Stanford offered both San Mateo
County and Portola Valley funding
to repair the trails, but San Mateo
County rejected the offer.
"San Mateo County has no
money to fix a trail like this, and

Stanford was financially obligated
to do it as part of the General Use
Permit conditions, so right now
there's no way to fix it," said PJ
Utz, associate professor of
immunology and member of the
Committee to Fix Lower Alpine
Trail. "I'm working with the super
visors very hard to try to have them
allocate money."

In accordance with the Trail
Agreement signed by Stanford in
early 2006, the money that could not
be paid to San Mateo County
because its Board of Supervisors
rejected the offer was then paid to
Santa Clara County.
Last summer, Santa Clara
County established a process for
government agencies and certain
nonprofits in the area to submit pro
posals with recommendations about
how to use the fund.
"By rights it should be an easy
decision," Sweeney said of the five
competing proposals. "But local pol
itics isn't always as easy as that, and
so it really is important for people
who think it's a good thing to weigh
in."

Stanford lands, was built soon
thereafter. The CI trail encoun
tered further difficulties. Its pro
posed route passed through four
jurisdictions Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, unincorporated San Mateo
County and Portola Valley and
Stanford offered both San Mateo
County and Portola Valley funding
to repair the trails, but San Mateo
County rejected the offer.
"San Mateo County has no
money to fix a trail like this, and

Stanford was financially obligated
to do it as part of the General Use
Permit conditions, so right now
there's no way to fix it," said PJ
Utz, associate professor of
immunology and member of the
Committee to Fix Lower Alpine
Trail. "I'm working with the super
visors very hard to try to have them
allocate money."

In accordance with the Trail
Agreement signed by Stanford in
early 2006, the money that could not
be paid to San Mateo County
because its Board of Supervisors
rejected the offer was then paid to
Santa Clara County.
Last summer, Santa Clara
County established a process for
government agencies and certain
nonprofits in the area to submit pro
posals with recommendations about
how to use the fund.
"By rights it should be an easy
decision," Sweeney said of the five
competing proposals. "But local pol
itics isn't always as easy as that, and
so it really is important for people
who think it's a good thing to weigh
in."

On Nov. 20, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors will vote on five
proposals one of which is backed by
Stanford University for spending
$10.4 million in Stanford University
funds, capping off a 12-year debate over
the funding.
In conjunction with the City of Palo
Alto, Stanford has proposed building an
8.5-mile trail network, portions of which
would be located on campus, with the
funding. If approved, the project would
involve building a new bicycle boulevard

Stanford University, along with the City of Palo Alto, the Palo Alto school board and others,
is backing one of five competing proposals to build a trail network in the region.
and a bicycle and pedestrian bridge
over Highway 101 in addition to con
structing new trails and improving
old ones.
Some involved with the project
feel that the other plans, which pri
marily involve updating trails and
other recreational facilities in the
area, fail to satisfy the conditions of
the agreement with Santa Clara
County because their distance from
campus will prevent campus resi
dents from regularly using them for
recreation.
"We actually don't think any of
the competing proposals satisfy the
conditions of the contract at all,"
said James Sweeney Ph.D. '7l, pro
fessor of management sciences and
engineering and president of
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders (SCRL), a community
organization of homeowners on the
Stanford campus. "We think some
times people from campus may use
them, but it won't be regularly used
recreation."

Because SCRL does not have
the requisite nonprofit status to
submit an independent proposal for
the money, it is partnering with the
University and the City of Palo Alto.
On Nov. 2, Sweeney, Provost
John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, Palo
Alto Vice Mayor Greg Scharff and
Palo Alto School Board President
Camille Townsend cosigned an open
letter to the community that
encouraged people to contact the
Santa Clara Board of Supervisors
to support the University-backed
proposal.
"It's rare to see such unanimous
community support," said Larry
Horton '62 M.A.'66, senior associate
vice president and director of gov
ernment and community relations
for Stanford University. The pro
posal is also backed by local law
enforcement, Palo Alto Unified
School District and a number of
area businesses.
The controversy surrounding
the trail dates back to 2000, when
Santa Clara County issued a new
General Use Permit (GUP) to
Stanford, allowing the University
over two million square feet in new
and expanded buildings. As one of
the conditions of the permit,

Stanford agreed to provide funds
to build two trails, the SI trail and
the CI trail, along the perimeter of
campus lands.
"There was a group of people
that wanted to reopen the question
of where the trails are, and they
wanted to put the trails on the mid
dle of our land," Horton said.
"Well, we didn't like that."
After nearly six years of
debate, Stanford signed the
Agreement for Trail Easements,
Construction Management, and
Maintenance and Grant of
Easements, or Trail Agreement,
which placed the trails at their ini
tial location along the perimeter of
campus.
The SI trail, located entirely on
Stanford lands, was built soon
thereafter. The CI trail encoun
tered further difficulties. Its pro
posed route passed through four
