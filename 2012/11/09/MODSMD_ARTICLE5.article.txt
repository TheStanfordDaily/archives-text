### SABELLE SMYTHE 
On Nov. 20, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors will vote on five
proposals one of which is backed by
Stanford University for spending
$10.4 million in Stanford University
funds, capping off a 12-year debate over
the funding.
In conjunction with the City of Palo
Alto, Stanford has proposed building an
8.5-mile trail network, portions of which
would be located on campus, with the
funding. If approved, the project would
involve building a new bicycle boulevard
