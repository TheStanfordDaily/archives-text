## Construction begins on power plant 
### ALEC POWELL 
Construction work on East Campus near
Stern, Crothers and Encina Halls will contin
ue into next year as part of the Stanford
Energy System Innovations (SESI) project.
After four years of planning, the project
began this October with ground breaking on
Stanford's new energy facility on Oct. 10 and
East Campus construction work on Oct. 17.
SESI is designed to meet Stanford's ener
gy needs through 2050. Estimated for com
pletion in Spring 2015, the $438 million SESI
project was approved by the Board of
Trustees in December 2011 and received
approval for construction by Santa Clara
County in September of this year.
New plant
The new energy facility will reduce carbon
emissions by 50 percent and save the univer
sity an estimated $3OO million over the next 35
years.
Currently, Stanford obtains nearly all of
its energy supply from the Cardinal
Cogeneration plant, which is owned and oper
ated by Cardinal Cogen, a subsidiary of
General Electric. The plant, commissioned in
1987, uses efficient natural gas-fired cogener
ation to produce steam, chilled water and
electricity for the campus.
Unlike the cogeneration plant, the new
central energy facility will be almost entirely
electric. This will dramatically reduce
Stanford's carbon impact to comply with the
stringent levels imposed by California's AB
32 Global Wanning Solutions Act.
The new facility will also act as a heat
recovery plant, enabling Stanford to regener
ate the waste heat that the cogeneration plant
would have discarded.
"We're taking what nature gives us," said
Joseph Stagner, executive director of
Sustainability and Energy Management.
In 2008, as part of SESI's Energy and
Climate Plan, Stagner led a review of tech
nologies that Stanford could use to meet its
energy needs in a more sustainable way. In

that review, he found that 70 percent of the
heat being wasted by the cogeneration plant
could be used to satisfy 80 percent of the uni
versity's heating demands.
"My jaw hit my desk and I said, 'I can't
believe it, what an opportunity,"' Stagner said.
Additionally, the new facility will feature
both hot- and cold-water storage, unique for
an energy plant.
Stanford-designed technology
The most unique part about the new facili
ty is its automated control system, invented at
Stanford by Stagner. Called the Central
Energy Plant Optimization Model (CEPOM),
the system works by finding the most cost-effi
cient electricity available to use. It also has the
ability to operate the facility autonomously,
which cuts down on labor costs. Stagner start
ed mapping out the software in late 2009, and
employed six students to test the model in 2010.
In February 2011, Stanford filed for a
patent on the technology. The system has
spawned a startup, Root 3 Energy Systems,
which secured an exclusive license on the soft
ware in February for possible commercial use.
The new central energy facility is only one
part of the SESI project. The other major
component of the project is the conversion of
the campus thermal distribution system from
steam to hot water.
Over the course of the next few years, con
struction workers will be working in phases to
install new underground hot water piping and
convert all buildings on campus so they are
able to receive hot water instead of steam.
The new pipes will be more energy-efficient,
reducing heat losses from 14 percent to under
four percent.
With all of the improvements being imple
mented by the SESI project, students can
expect to see a lot more construction around
campus.
"We know it's going to be disruptive for
the next three years, but it will set us up for
the next 35," Stagner said.
