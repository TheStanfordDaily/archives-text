## Tour guides explain, promote Stanford to diverse set of visitors

Stanford tour guides introduce over 100,000
visitors annually to the Farm through campus
walking tours overseen by Stanford Visitor
Information Services (VIS). And they do it all
while walking backwards.

"You get to be the face of Stanford to the 20
people on your tour," said tour guide Eric
Mattson 'l5. "It's very gratifying, getting to
show people around the campus. That has done

hires guides beginning in mid-March, giving
successful applicants "the VIS Bible," or the

torn 1 guide training manual. They then attend an
orientation session, shadow five or six tours and
are paired with a more experienced guide.
The most crucial tool in the tour guide kit is
the training manual, a 200-page binder filled
with facts about Stanford. It gives detailed
information about Stanford academics, athlet
ics, housing and student groups. And guides
aren't joking when they call it the Bible: the
manual's preface includes instructions like "duct
tape it to your torso" and "make it a part of you."
Facts inside such as "Did you know the
Bookstore is the second-largest university book
store in the U.S.?" change from year to year.
"It's based on the previous years' manuals,
and then every year we may add or take away
depending on how things change," said
Christina Zieglei; VIS administrative associate.
"For example, this year, the Thinking Matters
program is coming out, so we're going to kind of

Stanford tour guides compile their facts from a training manual, a 200-page binder guides
have nicknamed "the Bible." The speeches to visitors change depending on the group.
