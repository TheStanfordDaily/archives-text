# STUDENT GROUPS
## Tour guides explain, promote Stanford to diverse set of visitors 
### RAE STABEN 
Stanford tour guides introduce over 100,000
visitors annually to the Farm through campus
walking tours overseen by Stanford Visitor
Information Services (VIS). And they do it all
while walking backwards.

"You get to be the face of Stanford to the 20
people on your tour," said tour guide Eric
Mattson 'l5. "It's very gratifying, getting to
show people around the campus. That has done
a lot for me personally."

"[Training] is pretty intensive," said tour
guide Kristi Bohl 'l3. "It takes about two
months from the point at which you are hired
before you give your own tours.... The VIS quiz
is thorough and it goes point by point through
all the major facts."

To become a tour guide, students must go
through training for most of spring quarter. VIS
hires guides beginning in mid-March, giving
successful applicants "the VIS Bible," or the

torn 1 guide training manual. They then attend an
orientation session, shadow five or six tours and
are paired with a more experienced guide.
The most crucial tool in the tour guide kit is
the training manual, a 200-page binder filled
with facts about Stanford. It gives detailed
information about Stanford academics, athlet
ics, housing and student groups. And guides
aren't joking when they call it the Bible: the
manual's preface includes instructions like "duct
tape it to your torso" and "make it a part of you."
Facts inside such as "Did you know the
Bookstore is the second-largest university book
store in the U.S.?" change from year to year.
"It's based on the previous years' manuals,
and then every year we may add or take away
depending on how things change," said
Christina Zieglei; VIS administrative associate.
"For example, this year, the Thinking Matters
program is coming out, so we're going to kind of

have nicknamed "the Bible." The speeches to visitors change depending on the group.
have to do a lot more than we would
normally do to put together informa
tion about that for the guides."
But not every tour will use the
same facts.

"We try to give way more infor
mation than you would every give on
a torn 1 so you can kind of pick and
choose what is important to share on
each tour," Ziegler said. "If it's a
group of thud graders coming, facts
that [torn- guides] share are going to
be different than if it is international

businessmen coming, because obvi
ously the group is going to have dif
ferent interests."
Guides continue professional
development throughout their tour
guiding career. They practice public
speaking, complete workshops on
customer service and go on tours of
specific areas of campus, such as
Hoover Tower, to learn more
detailed information.

Despite the training tour guides
complete, some errors slip through.
On a recent tour, a guide claimed
human biology is the most popular
major at Stanford, followed by com
puter science. Last year; though,
220 students declared a computer
science major, making it the most

popular major at Stanford. The
guide also flubbed the total
Stanford population, overestimating
by several thousand students.
Errors with numbers may be the
result of recalling over 200 pages
worth of information while, of course,
walking backwards. However, many
errors stem from oversimplifications
of University policies.
For example, one guide said that
all sections for large lecture classes
are capped at 16 students. Though
the majority of large classes have
small sections, larger sections of
about forty students are also com
mon.
Another maintained that
Stanford offers need-blind financial

aid for all students, though this is not
true of international students.
Many of the tour guides use mis
takes as learning experiences, taking
their errors in stride so they can be
more accurate in the future.
"It was actually not even a tour
with other people," Mattson said,
recalling an instance of giving incor
rect information on a practice tour.
"I literally had no idea what to say,
and so I just started babbling. That
was a good learning experience. It
prompted me to go back and make
sure that what I'm saying is substan
tiated in the manual."
