On a cold Friday night at Cagan
Stadium, the No. 1 women's soccer team
heated up quickly. Seven minutes into the
game, sophomore midfielder Alex Doll
opened the scoring and from that point on,
the Cardinal (18-1-1) never looked back on
its way to a 3-0 win over Idaho State in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
Idaho State, the Big Sky conference
champion, was clearly overmatched against
a Cardinal squad looking to defend its
national title.

"We didn't know much about Idaho
State, but with this being the NCAA
Tournament, every game from tonight on is
do-or-die," Doll said. "No matter the oppo
nent, we have to take every game serious
ly."

The first goal developed from an attack
by forward Chioma Übogagu. The sopho
more crossed the ball from the left side to
senior Nina Watkins. Watkins chested the
ball down for Doll to finish with one touch
from three yards out.

The Cardinal didn't let up after opening
the scoring. Idaho State freshman goal
keeper Sheridan Hapsic was kept very
busy as Stanford peppered the Bengal net
with chances. The Cardinal outshot the
Bengals 17-2 in the first half and 31-7 for
the game.

In the 21st minute, Übogagu registered
another assist on a Courtney Verloo goal.
Übogagu picked up the ball in the center of
the field and slotted a diagonal ball directly
into the path of a streaking Verloo. The red
shirt junior then placed the ball just inside

the far post to double Stanford's lead—it
was the forward's team-leading Bth goal of
the season.

The Cardinal almost added another in
the 24th minute when senior captain Rachel
Quon rushed down the right sideline and
sent a cross into the box. Her classmate
Mariah Nogueira was there for the diving
header, but Hapsic made a great save to
keep the ball out.

Stanford would break through again
just before halftime. After the Bengals
cleared the ball, Cardinal defender
Madeleine Thompson put the pressure
back on with a long ball over the top. Junior
Sydney Payne tiptoed the offside line to
receive the ball in plenty of space. The for
ward turned and ripped a half volley into
the upper corner that Hapsic had no chance
to stop.

"I always like to bring a spark to the
team and I think I did that tonight," Payne
said. "I was glad I could help out with a
goal. It was one of the best goals I've had in
a while. It was a fun one."

Idaho State began the game by trying
to press Stanford all over the field, but
shifted into a defensive shell after halftime.
The change made little difference as the
Cardinal continued to pick apart the Bengal
defense.

The game was only kept close by the
efforts of Idaho State goalkeeper Sheridan
Hapsic. The freshman led the Bengals into
the tournament by winning two penalty
shootouts in the Big Sky playoffs and con
tinued her strong play in the first round of
the NCAA tournament. Hapsic recorded 10
saves on the night.

In the 50th minute, Doll's shot from
twelve yards out was just barely tipped
over the bar by Hapsic. Three minutes
later, Nogueira hit a rocket from outside the
box that missed the upper corner by inches.
