# CROSS COUNTRY
## Both teams easily through to NCAAs 
### NICOLAS SHUMP CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Friday, the Cardinal men and women kept
their seasons alive at the NCAA West Regional
in Seattle, Washington. To qualify for the nation
al championships, teams had to place in the top
two slots at their regional meet or hope for one
of the thirteen at-large bids. Stanford left noth
ing to chance, winning the men's race and finish
ing as the runner-up in the women's event.
The men moved up to the 10K distance for
this meet, instead of the typical 8K they have
run for most of the regular' season. The individ
ual competition had a familiar feel to it, as the
University of Arizona took yet another 1-2 finish
in good racing conditions on Jefferson Park Golf
Course, with defending NCAA individual cham

pion Lawi Lalang running away from teammate
Stephen Sambu 29:02 to 29:38. But the Rosa
twins kept contact with the lead group and led
Stanford with top-six finishes, Joe in fourth
(29:44) and Jim in sixth (29:52).
In the team competition, No. 3 Stanford dom
inated with 45 points, easily finishing ahead of
No. 9 Portland (107 points). The Cardinal had
four top-20 finishers in addition to the Rosas
redshirt junior Tyler Stutzman in 10th (29:56),
redshirt senior Benjamin Johnson 12th (30:00),
junior Erik Olson 13th (30:01) and redshirt sen
ior Miles Unterreiner 16th (30:04).

It was the 13th men's title for the Cardinal
and first under head coach Chris Miltenberg
since he took over the Stanford running pro
gram this year. "We did everything we talked
about," Miltenberg said. "We did all the things

we needed to practice going into next week:
being assertive, building together and running
strong to the finish."
The women's race was the normal 6K and the
individual finish was tighter than the men's.
Oregon senior Jordan Hasay edged Cal Poly
freshman Laura Hollander, the surprise winner
of the Wisconsin Invitational, to claim the indi
vidual title, 19:16 to 19:22. Stanford senior
Kroeger, the Pac-12 champion, kept contact with
that duo, finishing in 19:27 to claim third.
For the team competition, the results were
similar to two weeks before at Pac-12s. The
Ducks, led by Hasay, won comfortably with 64
points ahead of No. 5 Stanford and No. 4
Arizona. The Cardinal and Wildcats
both had 85 points, but Stanford
claimed second on a rare tiebreak
er. Normally, only the top five fin
ishers count for the team score and
the lowest total of their points wins.
But this time, the sixth runner's
finish was the deciding factor since
the top five were even.
The Cardinal top five was
rounded out by Cayla Hatton in
fifth (19:51), Aisling Cuffe ninth
(19:53), Jessica Tonn 27th (20:19)
and Megan Lacy 41st (20:46). And
Justine Pedronic's 64th place finish
was well ahead of Arizona's six run
ner Clea Formaz's 79th.

"This was a huge step for our
women," Miltenberg told
GoStanford.com. "They took a big

step forward in terms of keeping
their composure and running
together."

Both Stanford teams will look to
end their year with strong show
ings at the NCAA championships in
Louisville, Kentucky. As noted by
The Daily in our feature on
Unterreiner, this meet was normal
ly held the Monday before
Thanksgiving, but the NCAA has
now moved it to the traditional day
for cross country races of Saturday.
It will be then that Miltenberg, the
who coached last year's women's
champion Georgetown, will look to
bring Stanford its first cross coun
try title in five years.
"The biggest thing is that we
run the way we've always been run
ning," Miltenberg said. "If we focus
on what we're doing, anything is
possible."
