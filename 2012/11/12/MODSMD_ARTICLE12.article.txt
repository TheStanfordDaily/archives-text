The Stanford women's volleyball team contin
ued its reign of excellence this week, beating both
Washington State and Washington to extend its
winning streak to 22-straight and give the Cardinal
a solid claim to the title of hottest team in the nation
in any sport.

No. 1 Stanford (24-2, 16-0 Pac-12) started its
week with a bang, sweeping the Washington State
Cougars (12-16, 2-14) on Wednesday. The Cougars
had given the Cardinal fits in their last matchup, as

Washington State continued to match-up well
against the Cardinal, playing Stanford to a draw
throughout the first set. With the score locked at
19-19, Stanford finally broke out in a big way.

Stanford barely edged out a five-set victory.
