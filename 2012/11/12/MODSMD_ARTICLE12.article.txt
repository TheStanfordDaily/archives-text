SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Junior middle blocker Carly Wopat (2) was a steadying presence tor the Cardinal as it beat No.
5 Washington on Thursday to win its 22nd consecutive match and remain perfect in the Pac-12.
Freshman middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku and senior outside hitter
Hayley Spelman each racked up two
kills as the Cardinal closed out the
Cougars with a 6-0 run.
The Cougars continued to play
well in the second set, however,
going back-and-forth with Stanford.
The teams were tied as late as 17-17,
before Stanford again began to close
with authority. Freshman setter
Madi Bugg recorded four assists
and two kills, leading Stanford on an
8-4 run.

As the Maples Pavilion fans were
entertained by the annual "Libero
Bounce Contest" between men's vol
leyball players Grant Delgado and
Scooter Sakaida, the Stanford
women readied themselves to pre
vent Washington State from giving
them any more trouble in the deci
sive third set.

From the start, it was clear that
the break was exactly what the
Cardinal needed, as it reeled off an
early four-point run and didn't look
back, closing the Cougars out 25-15
for its third sweep in a row.
Junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat, fresh off winning Pac-12
Offensive Player of the Week hon
ors, again played a starring role,
recording 12 kills and three blocks
while hitting a career high .706.
Her fellow junior, outside hitter
Rachel Williams, also had a big
game, hitting .429 on her way to 11
kills. Freshman outside Brittney
Howard also chipped in 10 kills,
earning her sixth double-double of
the season as she also recorded 12
digs.

On Thursday night, Stanford had
another tough matchup against No.
5 Washington (20-5, 11-5), who also
took the Cardinal to five sets in then
previous meeting.

The Huskies seemed to control
the first set, taking an early lead and
refusing to look back. Stanford, how
ever, refused to give up and fought
back. After two straight Washington

errors gave Stanford its first lead of
the game at 21-20, the Cardinal
refused to let Washington regain the
advantage, squeaking out the 25-23
victory.

The second set was an absolute
different story, as the Cardinal
dominated the Huskies in all facets
of the game, taking the set 25-11.
Stanford played well on offense,
hitting .371 in the set, but stole the
show with its ferocious defense.
The Huskies were held to .000 hit
ting, as the Cardinal recorded 28
digs in the set alone.

Howard led the defensive move
ment in the best game of her young
career, recording 12 digs in the sec
ond set alone. She would finish with
31 digs, which tied former Stanford
libero Gabi Ailes for third most in
Cardinal history. She also led the
team with 12 kills, earning her sev
enth double-double of the season.

Sophomore libero Kyle Gilbert
chipped in 10 of her 24 digs in the set
as well, continuing her excellent play
of late.

The Husky defense fought back
in the third set, holding Stanford to
a .034 hitting percentage. While the

Cardinal gave Washington a fight,
the Huskies were able to prevail 25-
21, preventing Stanford from earn
ing its fourth straight sweep.
The fourth set seemed as though
it would go to Washington as well,
with the Huskies taking an early
lead. Washington led 22-18 and
seemed poised to take Stanford to
five sets again, before the Cardinal
took over.
Stanford rallied off a 7-0 run
behind three kills from Williams and
two from Wopat. The duo also com
bined for a block, as the Cardinal
held off the Huskies for a 25-22 win.

With just four games left,
Stanford is securely in first in the
Pac-12, holding a three-game lead
over No. 2 Oregon. The Cardinal
does have a tough road trip ahead,
having dates with No. 8 USC on
Thursday and No. 6 UCLA on
Friday. Stanford will then return
home for its final games of the regu
lar season against Colorado and Cal
before awaiting its seed in the
NCAA Tournament.

Freshman middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku and senior outside hitter
Hayley Spelman each racked up two
kills as the Cardinal closed out the
Cougars with a 6-0 run.
The Cougars continued to play
well in the second set, however,
going back-and-forth with Stanford.
The teams were tied as late as 17-17,
before Stanford again began to close
with authority. Freshman setter
Madi Bugg recorded four assists
and two kills, leading Stanford on an
8-4 run.

As the Maples Pavilion fans were
entertained by the annual "Libero
Bounce Contest" between men's vol
leyball players Grant Delgado and
Scooter Sakaida, the Stanford
women readied themselves to pre
vent Washington State from giving
them any more trouble in the deci
sive third set.

From the start, it was clear that
the break was exactly what the
Cardinal needed, as it reeled off an
early four-point run and didn't look
back, closing the Cougars out 25-15
for its third sweep in a row.

Wopat, fresh off winning Pac-12

Howard also chipped in 10 kills,
earning her sixth double-double of
the season as she also recorded 12
digs.

another tough matchup against No.
5 Washington (20-5, 11-5), who also
took the Cardinal to five sets in then
previous meeting.

The Huskies seemed to control
the first set, taking an early lead and
refusing to look back. Stanford, how
ever, refused to give up and fought
back. After two straight Washington

errors gave Stanford its first lead of
the game at 21-20, the Cardinal
refused to let Washington regain the
advantage, squeaking out the 25-23
victory.

The second set was an absolute
different story, as the Cardinal
dominated the Huskies in all facets
of the game, taking the set 25-11.
Stanford played well on offense,
hitting .371 in the set, but stole the
show with its ferocious defense.
The Huskies were held to .000 hit
ting, as the Cardinal recorded 28
digs in the set alone.

Howard led the defensive move
ment in the best game of her young
career, recording 12 digs in the sec
ond set alone. She would finish with
31 digs, which tied former Stanford
libero Gabi Ailes for third most in
Cardinal history. She also led the
team with 12 kills, earning her sev
enth double-double of the season.

Sophomore libero Kyle Gilbert
chipped in 10 of her 24 digs in the set
as well, continuing her excellent play
of late.

The Husky defense fought back
in the third set, holding Stanford to
a .034 hitting percentage. While the

Cardinal gave Washington a fight,
the Huskies were able to prevail 25-
21, preventing Stanford from earn
ing its fourth straight sweep.
The fourth set seemed as though
it would go to Washington as well,
with the Huskies taking an early
lead. Washington led 22-18 and
seemed poised to take Stanford to
five sets again, before the Cardinal
took over.
Stanford rallied off a 7-0 run
behind three kills from Williams and
two from Wopat. The duo also com
bined for a block, as the Cardinal
held off the Huskies for a 25-22 win.
