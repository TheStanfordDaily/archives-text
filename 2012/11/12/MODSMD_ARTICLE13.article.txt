## Stanford rolls at Oracle 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With last season's NIT Championship
packed away, the Stanford men's basketball
team is kicking off this year with a blank
slate. The Cardinal returns four players
from that championship squad, but is taking
the idea of a new beginning to heart in open

Stanford, picked to finish fourth in the
Pac-12 in the preseason coaches poll,

the training room.
All of those were things of the past on
Friday night, however, as Powell dropped a
career-high 27 points on the Dons mostly as
part of Stanford's half-court attack. At 6-

the resulting versatility that allows him to
play either forward position and create seri
ous matchup problems.
Although the Dons weren't lacking for
size, the struggle to contain Powell, who fin
ished 9-14 from the floor and 7-9 from the
line.
Noticeably bulked up (he says he has added
15 pounds to his frame in the offseason),
Powell also pulled down seven rebounds and
