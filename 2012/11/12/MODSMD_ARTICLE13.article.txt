## Stanford rolls at Oracle 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With last season's NIT Championship
packed away, the Stanford men's basketball
team is kicking off this year with a blank
slate. The Cardinal returns four players
from that championship squad, but is taking
the idea of a new beginning to heart in open
ing Maples Pavilion for action this year by
taking on a team it has never played before,
Cal State FUllerton.
Stanford, picked to finish fourth in the
Pac-12 in the preseason coaches poll,
opened the regular season in style, taking
down the University of San Francisco 74-62.
The game was played at Oracle Arena,
home of the NBA's Oakland Warriors, and
provided a glimpse of the court several
Stanford players might have a chance to
play on later in their careers.
Junior Dwight Powell, in particular,
broke out for the best game in three years
on the Farm. Coming in as one of the
nation's top recruits from IMG Academy in
Toronto, Powell has dealt with several
injuries that often had him shuffling
between the starting lineup, the bench and
the training room.
All of those were things of the past on
Friday night, however, as Powell dropped a
career-high 27 points on the Dons mostly as
part of Stanford's half-court attack. At 6-
foot-11, Powell's prowess comes in large
part because of his length, athleticism and
the resulting versatility that allows him to
play either forward position and create seri
ous matchup problems.
Although the Dons weren't lacking for
size, the struggle to contain Powell, who fin
ished 9-14 from the floor and 7-9 from the
line.
Noticeably bulked up (he says he has added
15 pounds to his frame in the offseason),
Powell also pulled down seven rebounds and
altered several shots.
"We worked out a lot during the
offseason," Powell said after the
game. "Right now everything feels
good."
It wouldn't have felt nearly as
good, however, if Stanford hadn't
picked up the pace after halftime.
After taking an early 14-point lead
over USF midway through the first
half, the Cardinal looked ready to
run away from the Dons.
Junior forward Josh Huestis hit a
three-pointer on the first possession
of the game and Stanford's defense
forced the Dons into several ill
advised shots, particularly from
behind the three-point line as the
Cardinal's interior defense was
swarming.
"Offensively we were inept," San
Francisco coach Rex Walters said.
"Guys were trying to do too much
and we got away from what we want
ed to do."
But Stanford didn't take exactly
take advantage on offense, scoring
just five points in the first five min
utes. Slowly, however, guard Aaron
Bright had four assists in the half,
and a three-pointer by Powell had
Stanford up 21-7 with nine minutes
to play before the break.
The Dons proceed to go on a 24-9
run from that point, with freshman
Avry Holmes hitting four of his first
five shots off the bench to take a
brief 31-30 lead before a late driving
layup by sophomore Chasson

Randle in the waning seconds sent
the Card to the locker room up 32-31.
It was a heightened defensive
push by Stanford after the break
made all the difference. The Dons
scored three points in the first five
minutes as the Cardinal went on a
14-3 run to bump the margin to dou
ble digits.
USF threatened a few times, but
never seriously, as Powell took over
the game. He scored 18 points in the
second half before departing with a
few minutes to play with leg cramps.
Bright chipped in with seven
points and three more assists while
the offense finished 13-26 in the half
and four of eight from beyond the
arc. Huestis finished with 11 points
and nine boards, and Randle had
eight points and three assists.
But perhaps the most intriguing
storyline of the night was the emer
gence of senior Andy Brown as a
potential boost off the bench. Three
ACL tears have wreaked havoc on
his Stanford career —he saw his
first action in nine games last season
since first coming to the Farm but
the forward scored eight points in 10
minutes off the bench.

With the starters all playing at
least 29 minutes, coach Johnny
Dawkins will have to find key con
tributors from outside the first five if
Stanford is to contend in the confer
ence or NCAA Tourney.
With the Titans in town, watch
out for D.J. Seeley and Kwame
Yaugh, the only returners from last
season and by far the most danger
ous players for Fullerton.

14-3 run to bump the margin to dou
ble digits.
USF threatened a few times, but
never seriously, as Powell took over
the game. He scored 18 points in the
second half before departing with a
few minutes to play with leg cramps.
Bright chipped in with seven
points and three more assists while
the offense finished 13-26 in the half
and four of eight from beyond the
arc. Huestis finished with 11 points
and nine boards, and Randle had
eight points and three assists.
But perhaps the most intriguing
storyline of the night was the emer
gence of senior Andy Brown as a
potential boost off the bench. Three
ACL tears have wreaked havoc on
his Stanford career —he saw his
first action in nine games last season
since first coming to the Farm but
the forward scored eight points in 10
minutes off the bench.

With the starters all playing at
least 29 minutes, coach Johnny
Dawkins will have to find key con
tributors from outside the first five if
Stanford is to contend in the confer
ence or NCAA Tourney.
With the Titans in town, watch
out for D.J. Seeley and Kwame
Yaugh, the only returners from last
season and by far the most danger
ous players for Fullerton.

With last season's NIT Championship
packed away, the Stanford men's basketball
team is kicking off this year with a blank
slate. The Cardinal returns four players
from that championship squad, but is taking
the idea of a new beginning to heart in open
ing Maples Pavilion for action this year by
taking on a team it has never played before,
Cal State FUllerton.
Stanford, picked to finish fourth in the
Pac-12 in the preseason coaches poll,
opened the regular season in style, taking
down the University of San Francisco 74-62.
The game was played at Oracle Arena,
home of the NBA's Oakland Warriors, and
provided a glimpse of the court several
Stanford players might have a chance to
play on later in their careers.
Junior Dwight Powell, in particular,
broke out for the best game in three years
on the Farm. Coming in as one of the
nation's top recruits from IMG Academy in
Toronto, Powell has dealt with several
injuries that often had him shuffling
between the starting lineup, the bench and
the training room.
All of those were things of the past on
Friday night, however, as Powell dropped a
career-high 27 points on the Dons mostly as
part of Stanford's half-court attack. At 6-
foot-11, Powell's prowess comes in large
part because of his length, athleticism and
the resulting versatility that allows him to
play either forward position and create seri
ous matchup problems.
Although the Dons weren't lacking for
size, the struggle to contain Powell, who fin
ished 9-14 from the floor and 7-9 from the
line.
Noticeably bulked up (he says he has added
15 pounds to his frame in the offseason),
Powell also pulled down seven rebounds and
altered several shots.
"We worked out a lot during the
offseason," Powell said after the
game. "Right now everything feels
good."
It wouldn't have felt nearly as
good, however, if Stanford hadn't
picked up the pace after halftime.
After taking an early 14-point lead
over USF midway through the first
half, the Cardinal looked ready to
run away from the Dons.
Junior forward Josh Huestis hit a
three-pointer on the first possession
of the game and Stanford's defense
forced the Dons into several ill
advised shots, particularly from
behind the three-point line as the
Cardinal's interior defense was
swarming.
"Offensively we were inept," San
Francisco coach Rex Walters said.
"Guys were trying to do too much
and we got away from what we want
ed to do."
But Stanford didn't take exactly
take advantage on offense, scoring
just five points in the first five min
utes. Slowly, however, guard Aaron
Bright had four assists in the half,
and a three-pointer by Powell had
Stanford up 21-7 with nine minutes
to play before the break.
The Dons proceed to go on a 24-9
run from that point, with freshman
Avry Holmes hitting four of his first
five shots off the bench to take a
brief 31-30 lead before a late driving
layup by sophomore Chasson

Randle in the waning seconds sent
the Card to the locker room up 32-31.
It was a heightened defensive
push by Stanford after the break
made all the difference. The Dons
scored three points in the first five
minutes as the Cardinal went on a
14-3 run to bump the margin to dou
ble digits.
USF threatened a few times, but
never seriously, as Powell took over
the game. He scored 18 points in the
second half before departing with a

points and three more assists while

and four of eight from beyond the
