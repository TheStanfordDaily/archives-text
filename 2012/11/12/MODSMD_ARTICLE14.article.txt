## EDITORIAL Dissolve the ASSU Senate 
### 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate is an abject failure. It
should be immediately dis
solved and what little authority it has
should be transferred in full to the
ASSU Executive.
The Senate fails to fairly and accu
rately represent the student body.
Senators run, mostly as freshmen, for
an organization they know close to
nothing about, and quickly realize
they've inherited an impossible set of
rules and regulations. And, for what
ever reason, the institutional inertia
of this organization and shortcomings
of its members preclude the possibili
ty of any reform from within. We are
now convinced that our best, indeed
our only, chance at serious reform is
complete dissolution.
Any regular attendee of Senate
meetings can describe how obtuse
parliamentary procedures delay the
passage of meaningless bills that are
ignored by students and administra
tors equally. Discussion either goes
on for far too long or far too short and
real issues are avoided in favor of rou
tine funding bills or, occasionally,
abstract declarations about interna
tional affairs.
The problem has compounded
itself year after year, as senators do
not seek reelection and the Senate
makeup shifts even more exclusively
towards rising freshmen. The 13th
Undergraduate Senate straggled to
pass meaningful legislation, wasting
its time on seemingly endless bills
and initiatives that had zero impact
on the student body. No members of
the 13th Undergraduate Senate
sought reelection.
At many schools, student govern
ment senate elections are hotly con
tested. During our 2012 election, by
contrast, only 18 students less than
.003% of the undergraduate popula
tion —ran for 15 spots. 13 of the 15
elected senators were freshmen. It
was the first time in seven years that
less than 30 students sought election
and voter turnout in 2012 was the low
est it has been in at least five years.
When these figures are compared to
the hundreds of students who try out
for a cappella groups, publications and
any number of student groups that
often require a larger time commit
ment than the ASSU Senate, it is dif
ficult to comprehend how the Senate
pretends to represent the entire stu
dent body.
We're less than one-fifth of the
way through the school year, and
already we are seeing the boredom,
complacency and frustration we have
come to expect from our student repre
sentatives in the Senate. Attendance

problems plague the Senate, with one
senator stepping down for medical
reasons and another missing enough
meetings to automatically trigger a
bill to expel them from the Senate.
Why does all this matter? There's
the obvious answer of money sena
tors are paid $4OO a year and manage
discretionary accounts worth several
thousand more. But more important
ly, despite the lack of student interest,
government representation remains
a crucial function of life at Stanford.
As the University administration con
tinues to expand its bureaucracy and
the decision-makers who affect stu
dent life are increasingly removed
from students, the ability to speak
and act as a unified student body
becomes more important.
The Senate is currently responsi
ble, for example, for approving the
new Alternative Review Process,
which determines Stanford's policy
regarding sexual assault, on behalf of
the undergraduate student body. The
Foundation for Individual Rights in
Education has given Stanford a "yel
low light" warning, listing four
administrative policies that "too easi
ly encourage administrative abuse
and arbitrary application."
Compounded with the revocation of
Chi Theta Chi's lease and its larger
implications for student housing and
overall independence, as well as a
harsher, ominous crackdown on
underage drinking and the gradual
shift away from residential dining
programs, it is clear there are real
challenges to be addressed at this
University.
By allowing a small group that
completely changes every year to
ineffectively represent our interests,
the student body is allowing the
University administration to ignore a
kangaroo court as the "student repre
sentation," rather than listening to
individual students, well-organized
student groups and student staff for
feedback. We must stop this.
This is not about individual sena
tors. As the journalists who go to
ASSU meetings and who have read
the hundreds of pages of their gov
erning documents, the organization's
bylaws and a convoluted institutional
structure are more to blame for the
chaos than the actions of any specific
representatives.
Dissolving the Senate has been
suggested before. To quote from a
victorious 1985 Chaparral slate for
ASSU Executive: "The time has
come to change, even to replace,

action again.
The real work of the Undergraduate
Senate, namely funding and repre
sentation, can be accomplished more
effectively and equally transparently
by the ASSU Executive. We strongly
encourage the ASSU Executive to
write a short and clear Constitutional
amendment transferring all powers
of the Undergraduate Senate to the
executive branch, obtain the required
signatures of 15% of the undergradu
ate population and submit their peti

tion to the ASSU Elections commis
sion, forcing a vote on the issue.
We need a system of student rep
resentation that doesn't suffer from
the same gridlock and absurdity with
which the ASSU Senate has been
plagued for several years now.
Understanding the hand the
Senators been dealt, we can't blame
them for accomplishing so little. But
we can work toward fixing the prob
lem, and we can transfer authority to
positions that aren't drowning in
their own bureaucracy. Tell ASSU
Executives Robbie Zimbroff (rmz@
stanford.edu) and William Wagstaff
(wagstaff@stanford.edu) to propose
an amendment dissolving the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and assume
its responsibilities. The ASSU
Executive has proven itself compe
tent and responsive so far this year*,
and we think they've earned the
chance to fix this mess.

pretended to serve the student
interest. No longer. Even that pre

Daily endorsed that Senate
destroying Chappie slate in 1985,
and we'd like to endorse the same
action again.
The real work of the Undergraduate
Senate, namely funding and repre
sentation, can be accomplished more
effectively and equally transparently
by the ASSU Executive. We strongly
encourage the ASSU Executive to
write a short and clear Constitutional
amendment transferring all powers
of the Undergraduate Senate to the
executive branch, obtain the required
signatures of 15% of the undergradu
ate population and submit their peti

tion to the ASSU Elections commis
sion, forcing a vote on the issue.
We need a system of student rep
resentation that doesn't suffer from
the same gridlock and absurdity with
which the ASSU Senate has been
plagued for several years now.
Understanding the hand the
Senators been dealt, we can't blame
them for accomplishing so little. But
we can work toward fixing the prob
lem, and we can transfer authority to
positions that aren't drowning in
their own bureaucracy. Tell ASSU
Executives Robbie Zimbroff (rmz@
stanford.edu) and William Wagstaff
(wagstaff@stanford.edu) to propose
an amendment dissolving the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate and assume
its responsibilities. The ASSU
Executive has proven itself compe
tent and responsive so far this year*,
and we think they've earned the
chance to fix this mess.

All they need to do now is ask for it.
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate is an abject failure. It
should be immediately dis
solved and what little authority it has
should be transferred in full to the
ASSU Executive.
The Senate fails to fairly and accu
rately represent the student body.
Senators run, mostly as freshmen, for
an organization they know close to
nothing about, and quickly realize
they've inherited an impossible set of
rules and regulations. And, for what
ever reason, the institutional inertia
of this organization and shortcomings
of its members preclude the possibili
ty of any reform from within. We are
now convinced that our best, indeed
our only, chance at serious reform is
complete dissolution.
Any regular attendee of Senate
meetings can describe how obtuse
parliamentary procedures delay the
passage of meaningless bills that are
ignored by students and administra
tors equally. Discussion either goes
on for far too long or far too short and
real issues are avoided in favor of rou
tine funding bills or, occasionally,
abstract declarations about interna
tional affairs.
The problem has compounded
itself year after year, as senators do
not seek reelection and the Senate
makeup shifts even more exclusively
towards rising freshmen. The 13th
Undergraduate Senate straggled to
pass meaningful legislation, wasting
its time on seemingly endless bills
and initiatives that had zero impact
on the student body. No members of
the 13th Undergraduate Senate
sought reelection.
At many schools, student govern
ment senate elections are hotly con
tested. During our 2012 election, by
contrast, only 18 students less than
.003% of the undergraduate popula
tion —ran for 15 spots. 13 of the 15
elected senators were freshmen. It
was the first time in seven years that
less than 30 students sought election
and voter turnout in 2012 was the low
est it has been in at least five years.
When these figures are compared to
the hundreds of students who try out
for a cappella groups, publications and
any number of student groups that
often require a larger time commit
ment than the ASSU Senate, it is dif
ficult to comprehend how the Senate
pretends to represent the entire stu
dent body.
We're less than one-fifth of the
way through the school year, and
already we are seeing the boredom,
complacency and frustration we have
come to expect from our student repre
sentatives in the Senate. Attendance

problems plague the Senate, with one
senator stepping down for medical
reasons and another missing enough
meetings to automatically trigger a
bill to expel them from the Senate.
Why does all this matter? There's
the obvious answer of money sena
tors are paid $4OO a year and manage
discretionary accounts worth several
thousand more. But more important
ly, despite the lack of student interest,
government representation remains
a crucial function of life at Stanford.
As the University administration con
tinues to expand its bureaucracy and
the decision-makers who affect stu
dent life are increasingly removed
from students, the ability to speak
and act as a unified student body
becomes more important.
The Senate is currently responsi
ble, for example, for approving the
new Alternative Review Process,
which determines Stanford's policy
regarding sexual assault, on behalf of
the undergraduate student body. The
Foundation for Individual Rights in
Education has given Stanford a "yel
low light" warning, listing four
administrative policies that "too easi
ly encourage administrative abuse
and arbitrary application."
Compounded with the revocation of
Chi Theta Chi's lease and its larger
implications for student housing and
overall independence, as well as a
harsher, ominous crackdown on
underage drinking and the gradual
shift away from residential dining
programs, it is clear there are real
challenges to be addressed at this
University.
By allowing a small group that
completely changes every year to
ineffectively represent our interests,
the student body is allowing the
University administration to ignore a
kangaroo court as the "student repre
sentation," rather than listening to
individual students, well-organized
student groups and student staff for
feedback. We must stop this.
This is not about individual sena
tors. As the journalists who go to
ASSU meetings and who have read
the hundreds of pages of their gov
erning documents, the organization's
bylaws and a convoluted institutional
structure are more to blame for the
chaos than the actions of any specific
representatives.
Dissolving the Senate has been
suggested before. To quote from a
victorious 1985 Chaparral slate for
ASSU Executive: "The time has
come to change, even to replace,
this government that once at least
