# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Laptops and classrooms don't mix 
### Chris Herries 
The Ã¼biquity of laptops in
classrooms troubles me. I'll
be the first to admit that I am
like a centenarian when it comes to
technology, but I think the point is
still an important one. I think we
need to all admit that nobody with a
laptop in front of them pays full
attention to a speaker. That type of
self-control just does not exist any
more.

The first objection will be that
glancing at emails once or twice
during lecture does not actually
interrupt a person's attention.
Essentially, this argument goes, as
long as you are not browsing
Memebase, reddit, 4ehan or some
other asinine waste of time, then
you are okay to take notes. I think
this is a gross misconception.
First, the vast majority of people
I have seen are glued to the screen
perusing a website, especially in
classes that lack visual aids. What I
have noticed is that when a person is
not occupied with visual stimulation
at the front of the room, they gener
ate that stimulus themselves. For
many students, this is not just a
quick look at emails. They are surf
ing the web something that could
easily be done at home.
Second, periodically checking
your email during class is still a
problem. What you are saying is
that those things are on your mind.
Facebook, email, texts all have
some grip on your attention, even if
you consider it minimal. The prob

lem with multi-tasking is that you
end up doing two things poorly,
rather than one well. Just because
you are generating notes does not
mean the talk has significance for
you. Lectures, especially in the
humanities, require active mental
engagement. I often scribble notes
about my notes during lectures,
because even the information fed to
us by professors requires scrutiny.
You should never be a passive
receptacle to information.
Lastly, web surfing or text mes
saging during talks is simply rude.
I was in a relatively small lecture
class, with roughly thirty people,
where the boy in front of me was
blatantly texting on his phone the
entire time. The speaker saw this
and, at least for an instant, was vis
ibly perturbed. He was a guest
speaker asked to come talk to us
about a topic of interest. That is not
the way I was taught to receive a
guest, and it certainly does not
reflect well on the student body.
If you truly feel a lecturer is
incompetent, or that his lecture is
wasting your time, then leave. It is
better to leave then to stay on and
mindlessly record notes you could
grab from a friend. There is no need
to keep up the charade of paying
attention when you are, in fact, not.

Let Chris know what you think by
emailing him at herriesc@ Stan
ford. edu. Just don't do it during
class.
