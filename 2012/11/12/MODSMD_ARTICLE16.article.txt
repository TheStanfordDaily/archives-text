# Do You MIND?
## A
						call to action: Nu-Progressivism in the age of Nu-Obama 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
MTI [people] believe that
I Obama was the best choice,
-I. they shouldn't just leave it
to Obama to carry out any kind of
progressive agenda," Clayborne
Carson, director of the Martin
Luther King Research Institute
said to me in a post-election inter
view last Tuesday.

Carson's words stemmed from a
conversation we'd had in our
Modern African American Freedom
Struggle class earlier that day,
when he had recalled addressing a
group of Morehouse students the
day before President Obama's 2009
inauguration with the warning,
"The most important day is not
tomorrow, but the day after."

Barack Obama's reelection is not
a political end nor does it guar
antee the beginning of a future that
values human rights and social jus
tice.

As I wrote in last week's column
"Why I Am Not Voting for Barack
Obama," the president's record of
actively aggravating human rights
abuses in the Middle East and his
silence on issues of race and racism
suggest the president will have a
negative impact on the success of
our collective futures.

However, I felt dissatisfied with
the treatment I gave to the relation
ship I perceived between foreign
policy and domestic justice.

It was not until Professor
Carson's history class later that day
that I was able to see the explicit
connection between the plights of
our brown families in the Middle
East and the plights of our brown
families at home.
The connection came from the
words of Dr. King (emphases are
my own):
"7 am convinced that if we
are to get on the right side of the
world revolution, we as a nation
must undergo a radical revolution
of values," King said in his 1967
"Beyond Vietnam" speech. "We
must rapidly begin the shift
from a 'thing-oriented' society to
a 'person-oriented' society. When
machines and computers, profit
motives and property rights are
considered more important than

people, the giant triplets of
racism, materialism and mili
tarism are incapable of being con
quered."
To be clear, issues of racism at
home and abroad are inextrica
bly bound with the preponderance
of the state's use of force (through
the military or the police). And both
of these issues are also tied to the
ideology of "free-market" capital
ism that "justifies" Euro-American
expansion into every crevice of the
world, resorts to discrimination on
the basis of race to determine which
bodies are treated as expendable,
surplus labor for such production
and uses military action as a last
ditch effort to coerce resistant
actors into compliance.

The constant threat and attack
American drones put on our sisters
in Pakistan are the same as the con
stant threat and attack American-
Israeli military occupation put on
our Palestinian sisters in Gaza and
the West Bank and are the same as
the constant threat and attack
America puts on our black and
brown sisters in the US.

"Let's fight for fairer elections
repeal the electoral system,
introduce a run-off, whatever but
not at the eleventh hour when so
much is at stake," one commenter
said in response to my column last
week.

The biggest stakes this and
other people identified were that
the Republican party platform
greatly threatens women's and
minority rights rights that the
Democratic platform champions.
I was (and am) critical of those
who gleefully celebrated Obama's
reelection without pause for reflec
tion because Obama and Democrats
were allegedly proponents of these
rights.

While the Republican platform
did threaten these issues in some
specific sense, taking a step back
reveals that the Democratic Party is
ultimately harmful to these goals as
well.

High rates of incarceration of
black/brown men and women,
increased profiling of Muslim peo
ple and the splitting of migrant fam

ilies through unprecedented levels
of deportation all have impacts on
women and minorities. And on a
global scale, killing and terrorizing
women (and men and children) with
drones does nothing to advance
women's rights.
An additional problem with the
"X supports Y rights" logic is that
this model does nothing to address
the underlying and fundamental
systems of oppression that create
marginalized groups in the first
place it merely assimilates them
into being comfortable reproducing
these systems of oppression.
The eleventh hour is still going
on and we still have much at stake
in our collective futures.

So, to return to the man who
framed today's column, I present a
charge from Clayborne Carson:
"[What] I hope will happen over
the next four years is that there will
not be this sitting back and waiting
for Obama to act, but rather people
will understand they have to act on
them own and force Obama to follow
their will," Carson said.
I submit this piece as a rallying
call for left-leaning/progressive
minded/justice-oriented students to
join a movement to build a self-sus
taining coalition of Stanford
activists.

For the past two weeks, STAT
IC, Stanford's progressive blog and
journal, has hosted coalition-build
ing discussions to begin pushing our
campus/national/global politics in
the direction it needs to be going,
and to thereby give students prac
tice for similar organizing post
graduation. Roughly 50 different
students have attended one or more
of these meetings so far.
We will meet this Wednesday to
begin the process of formalizing
what such a coalition would look like
structurally and what actionable
aims we might work towards.
Please join us from 9-10:30 p.m. in
the El Centro Chicano conference
room.
Let's not sit back and wait any
longer.
