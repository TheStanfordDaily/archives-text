# THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## The
						benefits of midterm student feedback 
### Adam Johnson 
Last week, one of my classes
underwent a Small Group
Evaluation (SGE) conducted
by a trained evaluator from
Stanford's Center for Teaching and
Learning. For those unfamiliar
with the process, the professor or
section leader leaves the classroom
for the last 20 minutes of class, dur
ing which time the evaluator solic
its feedback from the students. The
feedback is then provided to the
instructor through a private con
sultation, and the instructor can
institute as many changes as she
feels comfortable with.

Despite being a senior, this was
my first such session. I wonder why.
I've had some great professors here,
but I've also had some, well, not-so
great ones. It is not that those in the
latter group do not care about the
class they often do. Rather, their
teaching practice is simply not up to
par. Some professors, no matter
how hard they try, simply cannot
convey the material in an effective
manner. These instructors would

likely not benefit significantly from
a small group evaluation.
The SGE could, however, be
beneficial for a professor who can
convey the material well enough,
but lacks skill in other areas.
Perhaps the examinations are
unfair, the readings aren't relevant,
the office hours are poorly sched
uled, the lecture slides are incoher
ent or there is no midway break for
longer classes.
These minor details add up, yet
they often go unaddressed until the
end-of-quarter Axess evaluations.
Sometimes students will take it
upon themselves to email the pro
fessor or TAs, yet this method has
certain flaws: There is no trained
evaluator to filter comments or for
the professor to consult, and email
feedback only represents the opin
ions of a small, self-selecting frac
tion of the class. Before the small
group evaluation, for instance, I
was sure that the class would bene
fit from a laptop ban. Yet once I
suggested this to the evaluator, it

was met with protests from every
corner of the room. Although I may
not agree with my peers' opinions, I
trust the evaluator will suggest a
reasonable course of action on that
front to my instructor.
If you are an instructor, I would
encourage you to utilize SGEs.
Even the best classes I've had
could have benefited from some
tweaks here and there. If you are a
student, I would encourage you to
recommend this resource to the
professors or TAs who you think
could use some immediate feed
back; if you think that a class has
flaws, there is a strong chance that
a lot of other students feel the same
way. Rather than provide the
instructor with just your opinions,
have the class provide its collective
feedback to a trained evaluator who
can appropriately relay that infor
mation.
