## ACOUSTIC JUKEBOX RESTORING INTIMACY TO STANFORD PERFORMANCE 
### Katharine Schwab | FELLOW 
Listening to music should be an inti
mate experience, but on a campus
as large as Stanford's, that often
proves difficult. Danny Smith 'l3 sought to
fix this last spring, when he began the
weekly music series Acoustic Jukebox as
an independent project in the lounge of
Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), where he
has lived for the past two years. Ever since,
on Mondays at EBF, Jukebox has provided
a haven for student musicians desiring a
more intimate performance venue.
"Sometimes when you are playing
really personal stuff, you don't want to put
yourself out there unless you know it's
going to be heard. I wanted to make a place
that was respectful and intimate," Smith
said.
From the first event with only ten
attendees, Acoustic Jukebox has grown into
a vibrant weekly space. Last week 50 stu
dents arrived to share a piece of Jukebox's
warmth, sitting on couches and in arm
chairs as they listened to performances by
earth sciences graduate student Matt
Winnick and Chris Tang 'l4, who played a
collection of originals and covers. The
scheduled acoustic set ended with everyone
singing along to Tang's crowd-pleasing ver
sion of Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here."
Next up were the Stanford
Improvisers, who had everyone laughing
with original scenes. An open mic closed a

laid-back evening of music and mirth,
while Claire Torchiana 'l3's art provided a
backdrop.
This year, the series is sponsored by
the Student Organizing Committee for the
Arts (SOCA). Smith is co-director, along
with Mayukh Sen 'l4, and together they
have helped to turn Acoustic Jukebox into
a venue featuring visual art as well as stu
dent musicians and performers.
"It's a really awesome, intimate venue.
[You] really get to interact with the people
there," said Ally Arrieta 'l5, who performed
her original music at Acoustic Jukebox
both last spring and this fall.
Smith has been recording many of the
performances and posting them on
Sound Cloud. He hopes Acoustic Jukebox
will become a space for students to discov
er independent musicians on campus.
Sen believes that Acoustic Jukebox is a
much-needed addition to the Stanford art
scene.
"There are so many dormant artistic
talents on this campus. Some of them
express it through being in dance groups or
whatever, but a lot of them don't. People

say, yeah, I'm [majoring in mechanical
engineering], but I also like to do this.
School doesn't afford them that kind of
space, just by the nature of the quarter sys
tem and the hectic academic environment,"
Sen said.
Beyond providing a space for artists,
the series is about creating an artistic com
munity centered on collaboration. In such
a rigorous academic environment, stu
dents' artistic expression often falls by the
wayside.
As co-directors of SOCA, Smith and
Sen want to help create an artistic commu
nity supported by more than just quarterly
events. Arts groups often compete for
space, time and resources, but "it makes
sense to do things together," Smith said,
noting that Acoustic jukebox and SOCA
"aren't the only people doing this right
now. I feel like there's a bigger movement
happening with this collaborative feeling."

This Monday's Acoustic Jukebox, 8:30 p.m. to
midnight, will feature music from Charlie
Glick 'l3 and Chris Beachy 'l3 and visual
art from Susha Roy 'l3.
