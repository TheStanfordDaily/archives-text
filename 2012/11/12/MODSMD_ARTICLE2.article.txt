## CoHo survives new Starbucks 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
Employees at the Coffee House (CoHo) braced for
the worst when they first heard that a new Starbucks
was opening just doors down from their long-standing
Tresidder location. The Starbucks shop, which opened
in August, would be the first full-service store built
and operated by the coffee chain on a college campus
anywhere in the country.
Three months later, however, the effect of the new
coffee shop has not impacted CoHo's sales as much as
anticipated, according to Erick Guzman, director of
operations at CoHo.
"We actually expected worse, because as a busi
ness, that's what you prepare for," Guzman said. "So
far, if I base it on our sales, we're coming through."
In the first month of Starbucks' opening, CoHo's
sales "took a hit," reflected by a 10 percent drop in

sales compared to the previous year. Since then, how
ever, CoHo's "sales have stabilized and are flat versus
last year," according to Guzman.
Guzman was as surprised as the rest of the
Stanford community when he found out about the
arrival of Starbucks this summer as the construction
was underway. He described the process as "hush
hush" and "covert," but quickly came to terms with
the move.
"You know, it's here now," Guzman said, with a
shrug. "We just have to contend with it best that we
can, and we've been doing okay."
In order to contend with Starbucks and keep its
customer base, the CoHo has updated its menu prac
tically daily, according to Guzman, who described the
effort as "diligent."

Despite a small drop after Starbucks opened next door in Tresidder Union in August, the CoHo has
returned sales to last year's levels. The CoHo, a campus landmark, has been in operation since 1966.
Students reported that the
shop's menu is one of the main rea
sons they go to CoHo over
Starbucks.
"CoHo is way better for meals
than Starbucks," Adebia Ntoso 'l5
said.
"If I want a double chocolate
chip vanilla bean Frappuccino with
whipped cream and chocolate
chips, I go to Starbucks," Jeremy
Gilfor 'l5 said. "Panini? CoHo."
According to Guzman, "the food

and coffee categories have con
tributed the same sales percentage
as they have in past years."
CoHo hopes to maintain its
unique ambience as away of distin
guishing itself from Starbucks,
according to Guzman. In part
because of CoHo's comfortable
couches and background smooth
jazz, many students mark it as a
favorite campus study spot.
CoHo also features several com
munity performances a week, such
as Stanford Jazz performances on
Mondays, monthly open-mic nights
and Thursday Night Live Concerts
hosted by the Stanford Concert
Network.
The CoHo has almost continu

ously resided in its current
Tresidder location since 1966,
under different management.
When the shop was almost closed
in 2007 due to Old Union renova
tions, students spoke out in favor
for its return, helping to bring
CoHo back in June 2008.
"Even though I love Starbucks,
it's not a Stanford establishment,"
Graciela Arango 'l5 said. "CoHo is
only at Stanford I go to it and
feel like it's part of my Stanford
experience. After I graduate, I'm
going to remember going to CoHo,
not Starbucks."
