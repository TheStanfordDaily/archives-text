## CoHo survives new Starbucks 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
Employees at the Coffee House (CoHo) braced for
the worst when they first heard that a new Starbucks
was opening just doors down from their long-standing
Tresidder location. The Starbucks shop, which opened
in August, would be the first full-service store built
and operated by the coffee chain on a college campus
anywhere in the country.
Three months later, however, the effect of the new
coffee shop has not impacted CoHo's sales as much as
anticipated, according to Erick Guzman, director of
operations at CoHo.
"We actually expected worse, because as a busi
ness, that's what you prepare for," Guzman said. "So
far, if I base it on our sales, we're coming through."
In the first month of Starbucks' opening, CoHo's
sales "took a hit," reflected by a 10 percent drop in

sales compared to the previous year. Since then, how
ever, CoHo's "sales have stabilized and are flat versus
last year," according to Guzman.
Guzman was as surprised as the rest of the
Stanford community when he found out about the
arrival of Starbucks this summer as the construction
was underway. He described the process as "hush
hush" and "covert," but quickly came to terms with
the move.
"You know, it's here now," Guzman said, with a
shrug. "We just have to contend with it best that we
can, and we've been doing okay."
In order to contend with Starbucks and keep its
customer base, the CoHo has updated its menu prac
tically daily, according to Guzman, who described the
effort as "diligent."

Despite a small drop after Starbucks opened next door in Tresidder Union in August, the CoHo has
returned sales to last year's levels. The CoHo, a campus landmark, has been in operation since 1966.
