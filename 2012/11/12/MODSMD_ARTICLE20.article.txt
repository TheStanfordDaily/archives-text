# IN GOOD TASTE: Decadence
## 
### Grace Klaris | FELLOW 
For the past five
weeks of school,
"Decadence" has
been a word of mystery.
While scarfing down
your Panda Express or
indulging in some
pumpkin Fraiche, you've
probably noticed this
curiously enticing vendor
"coming soon" to
Tresidder. And the cur
tain has finally been
unveiled: Decadence,
Stanford's first-ever
sweet shop, has made its
debut.
Decadence doesn't
limit itself to one special
ty. Although chocolate
seems to be the main

appeal, this confectioner has
much selection to offer. It's easy to get swept up in the allure of the
"Rocky Road Cheesecake" or "Chocolate Tower," but your ventures to test
out the rest of the spread will prove fruitful.

The hot, freshly baked chocolate chip cookie was one of the best I've
had on campus and is not to be overlooked. Pro tip: any cookie can be
heated upon request; so don't settle for room temperature. In addition,
an unassuming petite fort was surprisingly satisfying ultra moist vanil
la and apricot cake coated in rich white chocolate.
The shop's whimsical approach shines through in some of its more
creative items. "Shooters," small, portable dessert cups, come in a variety
of seasonal flavors like chocolate mousse, eggnog, and pumpkin. These
miniature treats make for a perfect end to your Heirlooms salad or as a
pick-me-up before your 1:15 Chem class.
Decadence also rotates cakes often, so their "Cake du Jour" may be
"Mochalicious" one day and "Chocolate Heaven" the next. I got to sample the
"Niagra," which combined dark chocolate cake with layers of cream and vanilla
frosting. Although its flavor was lacking depth and richness or even "deca
dence," its presentation was impressive. Similarly, the "Tira Misu Cylinder" was
exquisitely constructed, but lacked the quintessential kick of espresso of any
classic tiramisu.

One of the more successful desserts is the "Chocolate Lava Cake."
Disclaimer: this treat comes with directions. After paying, march your
cake over to the nearby microwave and heat until desired level of gooey
ness is obtained. Remove, eat, enjoy.

Overall, the shop succeeds in filling a much-needed gap in Stanford's
dining options. It offers beautifully displayed desserts that, for the most
part, taste as good as they look. And if you're stressing about a friend's
birthday or the upcoming holiday season, Decadence is the perfect place
to find great gifts. Boxes of dainty macaroons and chocolate truffles will
be a welcomed change of pace from the Ã¼biquitous bookstore parapher
nalia. (Who doesn't need 15 pairs of Stanford underwear?) But don't wait
until then to head over; Decadence encourages us to indulge a little bit
every day, and I can't argue with that.
