# THEATRE OF THE ABHORED
## 'ELEKTRA' A
						COMPLEX VENDETTA 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
Sophocles' "Elektra" is, in many ways, the older sister of
"Hamlet": a woman named Elektra (Rene Augesen)
whose father, the king, was killed by her mother
Clytemnestra (Carol Lagerfelt), and her mother's lover, is so
destroyed by her father's death that she is in a constant state of
lament and eventually seeks vengeance.
Unlike Hamlet, Elektra cannot avenge her father's death
herself; instead, she awaits the return of her brother, Orestes
(Nick Steen), who consummates the task of killing the new
king. In the meantime, she mourns, whines and gripes, hating
her mother and sister for maintaining her place in her moth
er's favor. But where "Hamlet" was a complicated story of fam
ily dynamics, responsibility, the complications of love and
finding one's place in the world, "Elektra" is a simple tale of
violence breeding violence, with everyone's deaths preor
dained by a vicious cycle and by the will of the gods.
Carey Perloff s new production is caught in a failed
attempt to modernize the play, with a modem set, modem
dress and sometimes-modern interpretations of characters,
while maintaining its origins in Greek tragedy. The Choms
consists of just one actor: Olympia Dukakis. While she pos
sesses the dramatic weight to carry out the role, she seems out
of place in all of the scenes: without a program to tell you she's
the Chorus, you find yourself wondering who she is, what her
relationship is to the other characters and why she's there. The
most problematic of the modem costumes is Elektra's see-

through costume, which is very distracting; she may be
enslaved and a beggar, but without alluding to prostitution, it
struck me as a cop out for suggesting her vulnerability and
didn't necessarily fit into modem times.

The set is part of the problem, too. There is a dark stately
building, the palace, charred black and fenced in by barbed
wire, which appears to be part of the modern and corrupt
world. It is so cut off from the rest of the world, yet of rank
similar to Hamlet's Elsinore, that you can't help drawing paral
lels to the homes of today's one percent. But since the actors
switch between modern diction and overtly dramatic line
readings that signal they're in a Greek tragedy, it's hard to
chronologically place the play.
But while the direction is spotty at best, the all-star cast
does give a fantastic and weighty performance. The standout
was Carol Lagenfelt as Clytemnestra: dressed to look like
Queen Elizabeth during her Jubilee, she is cool, calculating,
brilliant and just sincere enough to make us question Elektra's
vendetta and unwavering loyalty to her father â€”she did, after
all, kill one of her sisters. Lagenfelt is best known on the small
screen for her role as CeCe Rhodes on "Gossip Girl," and there
are interesting parallels to be drawn between CeCe and
Clytemnestra, who both seem to sell out for wealth and com
fort, yet still exude a level of wisdom that makes them impos
sible to hate, despite how we are told we should. Rene
Augesen, American Conservatory Theater's star actress (for
good reason), does what she can with a character who could
be one-note; Augesen s Elektra, instead, is tormented, grieving
and full of conviction. Additionally, both Anthony Fusco as the
Tutor and Nick Steen as Orestes are absolutely perfect.

"Elektra" runs through Sunday, Nov. 18 at the American
Conservatory Theater in San Francisco at Nov. 13-17 at 8 p.m.
and Nov. 14,17 and 18at2p.m.
