# Faculty numbers continue to rise
## Peer institutions static while Stanford continues post-recession expansion 
### NATASHA VON KAEPPLER 
Stanford's faculty development is
steadily on the rise, unlike that of peer
institutions struggling to recover from
the 2008 recession.
Over the past decade, Stanford's
faculty has grown by over 230 mem
bers, said Karen Cook '6B, vice
provost for faculty development and
diversity. In the 2010-11 academic
year, there was a small dip in the total
number of instructional faculty from
1,023 to 1,014, but last year the total
reached 1,452, according to the
University common data set.
"We've been able to recover more
quickly from the recession than our
peers have," Cook said, crediting
University management for the suc
cess.
At Yale, faculty growth has
remained stagnant over the past four
years, according to the Yale Daily
News.
"The size of the Faculty of Arts

and Sciences has been held at roughly
700 since the financial downturn tore a
$350 million hole in Yale's budget,"
The News reported.
In comparison, Stanford has main
tained a working budget to allow for
the increases in faculty hiring. The
2012-13 University Budget Plan
showed a 5 percent increase in
salaries and benefits, continuous from
2011-12.
"The increases reflect both a rise
in salaries and the increase in number
of staff and faculty," Provost John
Etchemendy said in a May 2011 meet
ing of the Faculty Senate.
At the departmental level, depart
ment chairs report adequate faculty
hiring rates.
Paula Findlen, former history
department chair, said there is wide
spread approval of recent faculty
development in her department.
"We are certainly happy with
the hiring opportunities that the uni
versity has offered the History
Department," Findlen wrote in a state
ment.

Faculty diversity
As the amount of faculty hiring
increases, Stanford's Office of Faculty
Development and Diversity can focus
more on diversifying the demographics of
faculty members. At the May 2011
Faculty Senate meeting, Special Assistant
to the Provost for Faculty Diversity
Albert Camarillo called Stanford the "pre
mier university" in the field.
More than 20 percent of the total
instructional faculty members at Stanford
are "members of minority groups." Eight
years ago, it was 16.3 percent.
The Faculty Development and
Diversity website states its commitment
to a diverse faculty for its "increasingly
diverse student population."

Camarillo said in a statement that of
his department's several new appoint
ments in the past five years, at least half
have been women.

The divide between appointments in
the School of Humanities and Sciences
and the School of Engineering is clear.
Computer Science professor Eric
Roberts pointed out the underrepresen
tation of minority faculty in his depart

ment.
While Roberts praised the represen
tation of female faculty in computer sci
ence, specifically the appointment of
Department Chair Jennifer Widom, he
said he would like to have much greater
diversity than currently exists. He
believes this can go hand-in-hand with
faculty growth.
"Nationally in computer science
we're seeing a huge increase in the num
ber of positions being advertised because
there is so much more interest in it,"
Roberts said.
Programs like the Faculty Incentive
Fhnd, started when Condoleezza Rice
was Provost, aim to develop the faculty's
diversity. The Faculty Development
Initiative, headed by Camarillo, was
launched in 2007 as an extension of the
Faculty Incentive Rind.
The Initiative, jointly administered
through the Office of the Provost and the
Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity, has produced 11 faculty
hires since 2008.
Cook sees Stanford continuing an
upward projection in faculty develop
ment and diversity, more so than its peer
institutions.
"I think Stanford has really done a
good job recently in terms of supporting
new faculty and being engaged in broad
searches to bring in first-rate faculty
from all over the world," Cook said. "I
think it'll only get better."

More than 20 percent of the total
instructional faculty members at Stanford
are "members of minority groups." Eight
years ago, it was 16.3 percent.
The Faculty Development and
Diversity website states its commitment
to a diverse faculty for its "increasingly
diverse student population."

Camarillo said in a statement that of
his department's several new appoint
ments in the past five years, at least half
have been women.

The divide between appointments in
the School of Humanities and Sciences
and the School of Engineering is clear.
Computer Science professor Eric
Roberts pointed out the underrepresen
tation of minority faculty in his depart

ment.
While Roberts praised the represen
tation of female faculty in computer sci
ence, specifically the appointment of
Department Chair Jennifer Widom, he
said he would like to have much greater
diversity than currently exists. He
believes this can go hand-in-hand with
faculty growth.
"Nationally in computer science
we're seeing a huge increase in the num
ber of positions being advertised because
there is so much more interest in it,"
Roberts said.
Programs like the Faculty Incentive
Fhnd, started when Condoleezza Rice
was Provost, aim to develop the faculty's
diversity. The Faculty Development
Initiative, headed by Camarillo, was
launched in 2007 as an extension of the
Faculty Incentive Rind.
The Initiative, jointly administered
through the Office of the Provost and the
Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity, has produced 11 faculty
hires since 2008.
Cook sees Stanford continuing an
upward projection in faculty develop
ment and diversity, more so than its peer
institutions.
"I think Stanford has really done a
good job recently in terms of supporting
new faculty and being engaged in broad
searches to bring in first-rate faculty
from all over the world," Cook said. "I
think it'll only get better."
