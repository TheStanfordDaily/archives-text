## Profs. examine legalization of self-driving cars 
### ISSA YOUSIF 
Governor Jerry Brown's bill to legalize
autonomous vehicles for the first time in
California has come under scrutiny by
Stanford researchers involved in the develop
ment and legal study of self-driving cars.
Christian Gerdes, director of the Center for
Automotive Research (CAR) at Stanford, who
is currently working on autonomous vehicle
research believes Brown's deadline is too early.
'At the moment there is not a model of a
self driving car," Gerdes said. "A lot of things
are still evolving, and it's hard to write stan
dards for something that is evolving so quick
ly"
Senate Bill 1298, signed by Brown on Sept.
25, requires the Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) to establish safety standards and per
formance requirements for the testing and
operation of autonomous vehicles on public
roads by 2015.
Nevada became the first state to legalize
driverless vehicles last June, and similar laws
have now been introduced before legislatures
in Florida and Hawaii. However,
Gerdes distrusts the level of expert
ise of the California DMV compared
to that of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
"They are being tasked with
doing things that their organization
isn't set-up to do," Gerdes said, while
acknowledging the DMV has
reached out to experts at the nation
al administration and as well as at
the Institute of Transportation
Studies at UC-Berkeley for profes
sional advice.
Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at
the Stanford Law School whose
research focuses on the law and pol
icy of self-driving vehicles, and who
serves a DMV contact, also believes
the bill is flawed.
"[The bill is doing] too much in
the sense that it is looking far ahead
to technology that doesn't exist yet,
and we won't know what form they
will exist... and it doesn't address
how existing law applies to automat
ed vehicles," Walker Smith said.
According to the bill, the State of
California does not currently pro
hibit or specifically regulate the
operation of autonomous vehicles on
public roads.
The biggest advantage of auto
mated cars, according to Walker
Smith, is to reduce the 90 percent of
collisions that are caused by human
error.
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration reported over
32,000 deaths and over 2.24 million
injuries by motor vehicles crashes in
the United States in 2010 alone.
"Even though there is great
potential to reduce human error in
driving, you have the chance of
introducing human error from pro
gramming," Gerdes said.
An autonomous vehicle, as

defined by the bill, is a "motor vehi
cle that uses computers, sensors,
and other technology and devices
that enable the vehicle to safely
operate without the active control
and continuous monitoring of a
human operator."
Situations unforeseen by the pro
grammer could lead to an incorrect
decision on brakes or steering that
may have serious consequences.
For instance, questions come up
about whether the car should have
any sense of self-preservation.
Gerdes explained that if faced with a
situation where the car could swerve
out of the way, sacrificing itself
instead of hitting a human being,
how the car should make that choice
and who should be responsible for
the decision is yet unclear.
The greatest challenge is to cre
ate a car that can operate as well as
humans and be able to make judg
ments and ethical decisions.

Gerdes regularly faces this chal
lenge as he leads Stanford's
Dynamic Design Lab, which has
produced the robot-guided Audi
TTS named Shelley in partnership
with the Volkswagen Electronics
Research Lab.

Researchers working on Shelley
are currently trying to modify the

algorithms that drive Shelley to
make the car operate more like a
professional racecar driver. The
team is also applying their racing
work to show how their work on
Shelley can lead to collision avoid
ance algorithms that could help
avoid pedestrians or bicycles on the
road.

The car now determines the path
around the racetrack itself and can
calculate a racing line, or route the
vehicle will take, that is comparable
to the best human drivers.

Currently, Shelley is faster than
most humans on the racetrack, and
comes within just a few seconds of
professional drivers. However,
Gerdes said there is still much work
to be done before Shelley qualifies
as a working model for automated
vehicles.

"If you want a self-driving car
that can drive as well as the best
humans, you're setting a very high
bar," Gerdes said.
Regardless, he hopes that
Shelley will play a role in the
research and development that the
DMV and various institutions will
conduct in the upcoming months.

the United States in 2010 alone.
"Even though there is great
potential to reduce human error in
driving, you have the chance of
introducing human error from pro
gramming," Gerdes said.
An autonomous vehicle, as

defined by the bill, is a "motor vehi
cle that uses computers, sensors,
and other technology and devices
that enable the vehicle to safely
operate without the active control
and continuous monitoring of a
human operator."
Situations unforeseen by the pro
grammer could lead to an incorrect
decision on brakes or steering that
may have serious consequences.
For instance, questions come up
about whether the car should have
any sense of self-preservation.
Gerdes explained that if faced with a
situation where the car could swerve
out of the way, sacrificing itself
instead of hitting a human being,
how the car should make that choice
and who should be responsible for
the decision is yet unclear.
The greatest challenge is to cre
ate a car that can operate as well as
humans and be able to make judg
ments and ethical decisions.

Gerdes regularly faces this chal
lenge as he leads Stanford's
Dynamic Design Lab, which has
produced the robot-guided Audi
TTS named Shelley in partnership
with the Volkswagen Electronics
Research Lab.

Researchers working on Shelley
are currently trying to modify the

algorithms that drive Shelley to
make the car operate more like a
professional racecar driver. The
team is also applying their racing
work to show how their work on
Shelley can lead to collision avoid
ance algorithms that could help
avoid pedestrians or bicycles on the
road.

The car now determines the path
around the racetrack itself and can
calculate a racing line, or route the
vehicle will take, that is comparable
to the best human drivers.

Currently, Shelley is faster than
most humans on the racetrack, and
comes within just a few seconds of
professional drivers. However,
Gerdes said there is still much work
to be done before Shelley qualifies
as a working model for automated
vehicles.

"If you want a self-driving car
that can drive as well as the best
humans, you're setting a very high
bar," Gerdes said.
Regardless, he hopes that
Shelley will play a role in the
research and development that the
DMV and various institutions will
conduct in the upcoming months.

Governor Jerry Brown's bill to legalize
autonomous vehicles for the first time in
California has come under scrutiny by
Stanford researchers involved in the develop
ment and legal study of self-driving cars.
Christian Gerdes, director of the Center for
Automotive Research (CAR) at Stanford, who
is currently working on autonomous vehicle
research believes Brown's deadline is too early.
'At the moment there is not a model of a
self driving car," Gerdes said. "A lot of things
are still evolving, and it's hard to write stan
dards for something that is evolving so quick
ly"
Senate Bill 1298, signed by Brown on Sept.
25, requires the Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) to establish safety standards and per
formance requirements for the testing and
operation of autonomous vehicles on public
roads by 2015.
Nevada became the first state to legalize
driverless vehicles last June, and similar laws
have now been introduced before legislatures
in Florida and Hawaii. However,
Gerdes distrusts the level of expert
ise of the California DMV compared
to that of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
"They are being tasked with
doing things that their organization
isn't set-up to do," Gerdes said, while
acknowledging the DMV has
reached out to experts at the nation
al administration and as well as at
the Institute of Transportation
Studies at UC-Berkeley for profes
sional advice.
Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at
the Stanford Law School whose
research focuses on the law and pol
icy of self-driving vehicles, and who
serves a DMV contact, also believes
the bill is flawed.
"[The bill is doing] too much in
the sense that it is looking far ahead
to technology that doesn't exist yet,
and we won't know what form they
will exist... and it doesn't address
how existing law applies to automat
ed vehicles," Walker Smith said.
According to the bill, the State of
California does not currently pro
hibit or specifically regulate the
operation of autonomous vehicles on
public roads.
The biggest advantage of auto
mated cars, according to Walker
Smith, is to reduce the 90 percent of
collisions that are caused by human
error.
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration reported over
32,000 deaths and over 2.24 million
injuries by motor vehicles crashes in
the United States in 2010 alone.

potential to reduce human error in
