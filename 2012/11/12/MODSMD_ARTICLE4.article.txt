## Profs. examine legalization of self-driving cars 
### ISSA YOUSIF 
Governor Jerry Brown's bill to legalize
autonomous vehicles for the first time in
California has come under scrutiny by
Stanford researchers involved in the develop
ment and legal study of self-driving cars.
Christian Gerdes, director of the Center for
Automotive Research (CAR) at Stanford, who
is currently working on autonomous vehicle
research believes Brown's deadline is too early.
'At the moment there is not a model of a
self driving car," Gerdes said. "A lot of things
are still evolving, and it's hard to write stan
dards for something that is evolving so quick
ly"
Senate Bill 1298, signed by Brown on Sept.
25, requires the Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) to establish safety standards and per
formance requirements for the testing and
operation of autonomous vehicles on public
roads by 2015.
Nevada became the first state to legalize
driverless vehicles last June, and similar laws
have now been introduced before legislatures
