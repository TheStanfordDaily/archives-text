## Stanford vets discuss war experiences Veterans Day panel features six student veterans, documentary 
### NIUNIU TEO 
On Veterans Day, six student veterans joined
a panel to discuss their experiences of war. The
event, titled "Voices from the front: Stanford
students returning home from war;" was hosted
by the Stanford Storytelling Project. These are
some of their stories.
Anne Hsieh
Captain Anne Hsieh M.A J.D. 'l2 serves as
a military lawyer. She has completed missions in
Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Iraq
and Afghanistan.
"I didn't have any military background in my
family, but I thought it sounded cool," Hsieh said.
"I just kind of wanted something a little differ
ent, and a little challenging. So I visited [West
Point], fell in love with it, and decided to give it a
try."
A former military engineer, Hsieh
realized the most difficult part of serv
ing was being away from home.
"I expected it to be a lot harder
than it really was, in the sense of
physical hardships. And it wasn't so
much that way for me, which was
almost kind of disappointing," she
said. "The hardest thing [was] always
just being away from people I loved,
just hands down."
However, for Hsieh, the military's
rewards were always worth the phys
ical and emotional strain of serving in
the Army
"I actually don't mind deploy
ments, because you get to do your job.
In the army you're always training,
training, training, to do a job that
most people are hoping you never
have to do," Hsieh said. "But I think
the incredible thing about the last 10
years is that [though] we've been
stretched really thin, we've been able

to do our job."
William Treseder
Sergeant William Treseder 'll
served in the Marine Coips for 10
years, serving in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
"I think I was just looking for a
reason to challenge myself" he said.
"I wasn't a very good student in high
school so I tried to be part of some
thing where I thought I'd get the kind
of training I needed as a young man."
For TVeseder, the most defining
aspect of his military service was the
style of leadership it required.
"People who have never been in
the military have the general sense
that you point at people and shout at
them," he said. "But the Marine
Corps is a place where you're going to
learn the limitations of trying to lead
people that way very quickly."
Leading soldiers into combat
came with the unavoidable conse
quences of losing men, and watching
an officer trying to save one of his
fatally injured soldiers etched a last
ing image into Treseder's mind.
"I think that was one of the

moments I really realized the burden
of leadership," he said. "It's not his
fault, it's not his responsibility, but he
was obviously internalizing and tak
ing responsibility for it. It's an unfix
able situation, and that was a really
powerful reminder for me."
He reflected critically on the
reception veterans receive from civil
ians.
'As a group, I think we are proba
bly over-appreciated. I think there's a
certain degree of hero worship with
the military that's sort of disturbing.
Sort of a lionization of veterans, like a
general uncritical appreciation,"
Treseder said.
'"Thank you for your service' is
kind of a meaningless phrase ... It's
the equivalent of a rhetorical bumper
sticker, if that makes sense," he said.
Dustin Barfield
Dustin Barfield 'l2 served two
tours in Iraq as a Marine.
"I enlisted in December of 2001, a
couple months after Sept. 11. I had
never really considered the military
an option before that and I could not
abide my peers going off to war with

out me," he said. "I was the first
Marine in my family—the first one
in combat, the first one to have bullets
whizzing by."

Barfield's transition back to civilian
life was relatively smooth. However,
the marks of war still stay with him.

"Sometimes the transition from
the military culture to [civilian cul
ture] is a little difficult, and sometimes
the people don't truly understand
your experience or the effect that
they have on you," he said. "Veterans
do have unique struggles and you can
feel very isolated at times. So I've
struggled with that from time to time,
but it's been something that I've
coped with."

Russell Toll
Russell Toll M.S. 'l2 served on a
15-month Army tour in Iraq in 2006.
His decision to serve was prompted
by the possibility of being a part of
history.
"One of the [West Point's] slogans
was, 'Much of the history we teach
was made by those we taught,' and I
was like, 'Yeah, I want a piece of
that,"' he said.

However, war left him with heart
wrenching memories nothing hurt
more than "losing one of your guys."
Next to the body of a fellow soldier in
a funeral home, Toll reflected on the
experience of sitting next to a still
body he only ever knew in action.
"The strangest part is, you're
looking at his face and thinking about
all your memories, and a smell hits
you," he said. "And it's not the burning
grass, rain, livestock smell of Iraq, but
old formaldehyde. It really blurs your
memory and your reality."
But like Treseder, the pomp and
circumstance of appreciation on
Veterans Day leaves Toll with mixed
feelings.
"I really don't like the country
music twang songs," Toll said. "If I
was to give a recommendation for
what people should do on Veterans
Day, I would say to just take five min
utes to just sit on a bench somewhere
and look around you and marvel at
what we've created and what it took to
get there."

stretched really thin, we've been able

to do our job."
William Treseder
Sergeant William Treseder 'll
served in the Marine Coips for 10
years, serving in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
"I think I was just looking for a
reason to challenge myself" he said.
"I wasn't a very good student in high
school so I tried to be part of some
thing where I thought I'd get the kind
of training I needed as a young man."
For TVeseder, the most defining
aspect of his military service was the
style of leadership it required.
"People who have never been in
the military have the general sense
that you point at people and shout at
them," he said. "But the Marine
Corps is a place where you're going to
learn the limitations of trying to lead
people that way very quickly."
Leading soldiers into combat
came with the unavoidable conse
quences of losing men, and watching
an officer trying to save one of his
fatally injured soldiers etched a last
ing image into Treseder's mind.
"I think that was one of the

moments I really realized the burden
of leadership," he said. "It's not his
fault, it's not his responsibility, but he
was obviously internalizing and tak
ing responsibility for it. It's an unfix
able situation, and that was a really
powerful reminder for me."
He reflected critically on the
reception veterans receive from civil
ians.
'As a group, I think we are proba
bly over-appreciated. I think there's a
certain degree of hero worship with
the military that's sort of disturbing.
Sort of a lionization of veterans, like a
general uncritical appreciation,"
Treseder said.
'"Thank you for your service' is
kind of a meaningless phrase ... It's
the equivalent of a rhetorical bumper
sticker, if that makes sense," he said.
Dustin Barfield
Dustin Barfield 'l2 served two
tours in Iraq as a Marine.
"I enlisted in December of 2001, a
couple months after Sept. 11. I had
never really considered the military
an option before that and I could not
abide my peers going off to war with

out me," he said. "I was the first
Marine in my family—the first one
in combat, the first one to have bullets
whizzing by."

Barfield's transition back to civilian
life was relatively smooth. However,
the marks of war still stay with him.

"Sometimes the transition from
the military culture to [civilian cul
ture] is a little difficult, and sometimes
the people don't truly understand
your experience or the effect that
they have on you," he said. "Veterans
do have unique struggles and you can
feel very isolated at times. So I've
struggled with that from time to time,
but it's been something that I've
coped with."

Russell Toll
Russell Toll M.S. 'l2 served on a
15-month Army tour in Iraq in 2006.
His decision to serve was prompted
by the possibility of being a part of
history.
"One of the [West Point's] slogans
was, 'Much of the history we teach
was made by those we taught,' and I
was like, 'Yeah, I want a piece of
that,"' he said.

However, war left him with heart
wrenching memories nothing hurt
more than "losing one of your guys."
Next to the body of a fellow soldier in
a funeral home, Toll reflected on the
experience of sitting next to a still
body he only ever knew in action.
"The strangest part is, you're
looking at his face and thinking about
all your memories, and a smell hits
you," he said. "And it's not the burning
grass, rain, livestock smell of Iraq, but
old formaldehyde. It really blurs your
memory and your reality."
But like Treseder, the pomp and
circumstance of appreciation on
Veterans Day leaves Toll with mixed
feelings.
"I really don't like the country
music twang songs," Toll said. "If I
was to give a recommendation for
what people should do on Veterans
Day, I would say to just take five min
utes to just sit on a bench somewhere
and look around you and marvel at
what we've created and what it took to
get there."

On Veterans Day, six student veterans joined
a panel to discuss their experiences of war. The
event, titled "Voices from the front: Stanford
students returning home from war;" was hosted
by the Stanford Storytelling Project. These are
some of their stories.
Anne Hsieh
Captain Anne Hsieh M.A J.D. 'l2 serves as
a military lawyer. She has completed missions in
Thailand, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Iraq
and Afghanistan.
"I didn't have any military background in my
family, but I thought it sounded cool," Hsieh said.
"I just kind of wanted something a little differ
ent, and a little challenging. So I visited [West
Point], fell in love with it, and decided to give it a
try."
A former military engineer, Hsieh
realized the most difficult part of serv
ing was being away from home.
"I expected it to be a lot harder
than it really was, in the sense of
physical hardships. And it wasn't so
much that way for me, which was
almost kind of disappointing," she
said. "The hardest thing [was] always
just being away from people I loved,
just hands down."
However, for Hsieh, the military's
rewards were always worth the phys
ical and emotional strain of serving in
the Army
"I actually don't mind deploy
ments, because you get to do your job.
In the army you're always training,
training, training, to do a job that
most people are hoping you never
have to do," Hsieh said. "But I think
the incredible thing about the last 10
years is that [though] we've been
stretched really thin, we've been able

to do our job."
