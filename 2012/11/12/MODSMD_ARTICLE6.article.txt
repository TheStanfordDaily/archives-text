It was a game of blown leads and inspir
ing comebacks, of frustrating turnovers and
flawless plays, of high emotions and relent
less physicality, of meeting adversity and
overcoming adversity and of mistakes and
redemption.
In short, it was everything college football
has to offer.

Oregon State kicker Trevor Romaine had
just nailed a 44-yard field goal right through
the uprights with five minutes left in the third
quarter. Stanford fans fell dead silent, incredu
lously watching then- team's early two-touch
down lead and Rose Bowl dreams dissipate in
the blink of an eye.

11/10, Stanford Stadium
In the visitor's section, Oregon State fans
erupted in a sea of orange, sensing that the
Beavers were poised to deliver the final cut
and parade out of the Farm with a trail of
felled Trees in their wake. After all, the
Beavers had just rattled off 23 unanswered
points and had all the momentum on its side.
But the Trees stood.

Overcoming four turnovers and a nine
point deficit with the third quarter winding
down, No. 13 Stanford (8-2, 6-1 Pac-12)
stormed back to upend No. 16 Oregon State

(7-2,5-2) 27-23 on an emotional Senior Day and

Bowl aspirations alive.
"I'll just start off first telling you guys what
I said to the team," head coach David Shaw

Stanford football was in four-plus years ago,
these guys came in with a great attitude,
they've worked extremely hard to make this a
great place for football."
The first half was a tale of two quarters for
the Cardinal.

Redshirt junior tight end Zach Ertz (86) made up for an early fumble with a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Cardinal the
lead, allowing No. 14 Stanford to beat No. 11 Oregon State, 27-23, on Saturday. A midseason candidate for the John Mackey
Award, Ertz is also a candidate to declare for the NFL Draft early and is forecast as a likely first-round pick if he enters.
its next two possessions following a
pair of three-and-outs by the
Beavers.

With Kevin Hogan making his
first career start under center, the
Cardinal seemed to score at will in
the early going. Bad position field on
Stanford's own 7-yard line didn't faze
Hogan as the redshirt freshman
found three different targets
Levin Toilolo, Stepfan Taylor and
Kelsey Young for completions of
over ten yards. Hogan and Taylor
picked up big chunks of yardage with
their feet on back-to-back plays,
before Taylor punched it in for a 1-
yard touchdown run on third-and
goal. The 13-play, 93-yard drive was
Stanford's longest drive of the season
and gave it an early 7-0 lead.
"[Hogan's] earned our trust,"
Shaw said. "When you start a new
guy at quarterback early in the week,
we knew he could handle quite a bit,
but we didn't know how much. But by
the end of the week we knew we
could give him the ability to change
protections, runs to passes and pass
es to runs."
The Cardinal's next possession
ran just as smoothly. To get things
rolling, Hogan rolled out to his left
and dumped the ball off to fullback
Ryan Hewitt, who ran with it for 24
yards to midfield. The pah* would
hook up two more times on the same
chive, with the last one resulting in a
12-yard touchdown that came off the
play-action bootleg. Just like that,
the Cardinal extended its lead over
the Beavers to two touchdowns.
It seemed too good to be true and
it was, because Oregon State
responded emphatically in a hurry.
The Beavers finally found some
rhythm on offense to start the second
quarter. Quarterback Cody Vaz easi
ly connected with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton under
neath the coverage while running
back Storm Woods saw some day
light and picked up four first downs.
On second-and-three, Terron Ward
found the endzone from seven yards

out to cut into Stanford's lead 14-7.
Oregon State's defense also start
ed to lock down, sacking Hogan on
the next drive and forcing the
Cardinal to go three-and-out for the
first time that afternoon. Five con
secutive completions by Yaz had the
Beavers knocking on the door once
again, but a critical pass bat-down by
Chase Thomas on third-and-two held
Oregon State to a 19-yard field goal.
With Hogan running the two
minute drill efficiently, it seemed as if
the Cardinal would be able to put up
some points right before the half
ended. But the unthinkable hap
pened. Taylor, who hadn't fumbled in
his last 261 touches, lost the ball at
the Beavers 21-yard line. Although
the Stanford defense controlled the
damage, the team headed into the
locker room with a 14-10 lead instead
of the two-possession cushion it
could've had.

"That's uncharacteristic of us,
and the team will hear about it loud
and clear on Monday because that's
not us," Shaw commented on his
team's four turnovers. "And it was
two of our guys, two of our best play
ers: Stepfan Taylor and Zach Ertz.
Thankfully they came back, and
made some plays to win the game.
Shakespearean to a certain degree."
Whatever adjustments head
coach Mike Riley made earlier in the
game worked because the Beavers'
offense came out in the third quarter
firing on all cylinders. Helped out by
offside penalties called on nose guard
Terrence Stephens and inside line
backer Shayne Skoy Oregon State
moved the ball methodically with a
steady balance of run-and-pass
attack. The Cardinal defense seemed
to wake up when it forced the
Beavers into a third-and-16 situation
at the Stanford 22, but a wide-open
Wheaton took Vaz's short pass for a
22-yard touchdown.
For the first time all game, the
Cardinal found itself trailing.
It didn't help that on the
Cardinal's ensuing possession,

Hogan's pass was tipped at the line of
scrimmage and picked off by safety
Ryan Murphy. But the Stanford
defense remained stout when it need
ed to be, sending Cooks and Woods
backwards on their carries and forc
ing the Beavers to settle for a 42-
yard field goal.
Four minutes later, the consistent
Romaine sent another 44-yarder
right down the middle, capping a
stretch that saw Oregon State
explode with 23 unanswered points
and take a two-possession lead.
Taylor's redemption couldn't have
come at a better time.
On second-and-6 at the Beavers
40-yard line, Hogan escaped what
appeared to be a sure sack by check
ing down to an isolated Taylor on the
left side of the field as he was going
down. Taylor dashed down the side
lines, cut back to the middle, convinc
ingly stiff-armed a defender onto the
ground and rumbled into the end
zone for a 40-yard touchdown that
got the team back into the game as
the third quarter ended.
"If [Hogan] doesn't see his pro
gression, I try to stay in his ear to hit
the check down and that I'm open,"
Taylor said. "He didn't see anything
downfield and I was downfield and he
saw me, so I was able to score. That
was where I'm supposed to be if I'm
not blocking anybody. He saw me
and I was able to get the ball."

The Doak Walker Award semifi
nalist would finish the game with
nineteen carries for 119 yards, 47
receptions yards and two touch
downs. Prior to his costly fumble in
the second quarter, Taylor became
the first running back in school histo
ry to have three straight 1,000-yard
rushing seasons.
"[Taylor's] done something that
nobody's been able to do," Shaw said.
"I can't say how proud I am of that
guy."

Stanford got a much-needed
break when Josh Mauro landed on
the lost fumble by Vaz, who had been
careful with protecting the ball all

afternoon. Setting up shop at the
Beavers' 29-yard line, an unflappable
Hogan drove the offense down the
field for the go-ahead, 13-yard touch
down strike to Ertz.

"I just saw good coverage," said
Hogan, who finished the game 22-of
-29 passing for 254 yards, three touch
downs and two interceptions. "They
were playing man. Anytime you can
get Zach one-on-one, not many peo
ple can cover him, if any. He ran a
great route to get behind the
defense. And made a great catch for
a touchdown."

As it has done all year, Stanford's
defense clamped down when it need
ed to and did not allow the Beavers to
cross midfield on their last two drives
of the game. Alex Debniak sealed the

deal with a 12-yard sack that took Vaz
out of the game, rewarding the
Cardinal's gutsy performance on
Senior Day with a victory.
"You want to win your last home
game," said Taylor. "You owe it to
your teammates, especially the sen
iors. You go through the whole sea
son and you don't want this last one
to get away."
Taylor and the seniors didn't let
this one get away.
Looking to pull off the huge upset
and capture the elusive Pac-12 North
Division title, Stanford travels to
Autzen this Saturday to square off
against big, bad No. 2 Oregon.

Redshirt junior tight end Zach Ertz (86) made up for an early fumble with a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Cardinal the
lead, allowing No. 14 Stanford to beat No. 11 Oregon State, 27-23, on Saturday. A midseason candidate for the John Mackey
Award, Ertz is also a candidate to declare for the NFL Draft early and is forecast as a likely first-round pick if he enters.
its next two possessions following a
pair of three-and-outs by the
Beavers.

With Kevin Hogan making his
first career start under center, the
Cardinal seemed to score at will in
the early going. Bad position field on
Stanford's own 7-yard line didn't faze
Hogan as the redshirt freshman
found three different targets
Levin Toilolo, Stepfan Taylor and
Kelsey Young for completions of
over ten yards. Hogan and Taylor
picked up big chunks of yardage with
their feet on back-to-back plays,
before Taylor punched it in for a 1-
yard touchdown run on third-and
goal. The 13-play, 93-yard drive was
Stanford's longest drive of the season
and gave it an early 7-0 lead.
"[Hogan's] earned our trust,"
Shaw said. "When you start a new
guy at quarterback early in the week,
we knew he could handle quite a bit,
but we didn't know how much. But by
the end of the week we knew we
could give him the ability to change
protections, runs to passes and pass
es to runs."
The Cardinal's next possession
ran just as smoothly. To get things
rolling, Hogan rolled out to his left
and dumped the ball off to fullback
Ryan Hewitt, who ran with it for 24
yards to midfield. The pah* would
hook up two more times on the same
chive, with the last one resulting in a
12-yard touchdown that came off the
play-action bootleg. Just like that,
the Cardinal extended its lead over
the Beavers to two touchdowns.
It seemed too good to be true and
it was, because Oregon State
responded emphatically in a hurry.
The Beavers finally found some
rhythm on offense to start the second
quarter. Quarterback Cody Vaz easi
ly connected with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton under
neath the coverage while running
back Storm Woods saw some day
light and picked up four first downs.
On second-and-three, Terron Ward
found the endzone from seven yards

out to cut into Stanford's lead 14-7.
Oregon State's defense also start
ed to lock down, sacking Hogan on
the next drive and forcing the
Cardinal to go three-and-out for the
first time that afternoon. Five con
secutive completions by Yaz had the
Beavers knocking on the door once
again, but a critical pass bat-down by
Chase Thomas on third-and-two held
Oregon State to a 19-yard field goal.
With Hogan running the two
minute drill efficiently, it seemed as if
the Cardinal would be able to put up
some points right before the half
ended. But the unthinkable hap
pened. Taylor, who hadn't fumbled in
his last 261 touches, lost the ball at
the Beavers 21-yard line. Although
the Stanford defense controlled the
damage, the team headed into the
locker room with a 14-10 lead instead
of the two-possession cushion it
could've had.

"That's uncharacteristic of us,
and the team will hear about it loud
and clear on Monday because that's
not us," Shaw commented on his
team's four turnovers. "And it was
two of our guys, two of our best play
ers: Stepfan Taylor and Zach Ertz.
Thankfully they came back, and
made some plays to win the game.
Shakespearean to a certain degree."
Whatever adjustments head
coach Mike Riley made earlier in the
game worked because the Beavers'
offense came out in the third quarter
firing on all cylinders. Helped out by
offside penalties called on nose guard
Terrence Stephens and inside line
backer Shayne Skoy Oregon State
moved the ball methodically with a
steady balance of run-and-pass
attack. The Cardinal defense seemed
to wake up when it forced the
Beavers into a third-and-16 situation
at the Stanford 22, but a wide-open
Wheaton took Vaz's short pass for a
22-yard touchdown.
For the first time all game, the
Cardinal found itself trailing.
It didn't help that on the
Cardinal's ensuing possession,

Hogan's pass was tipped at the line of
scrimmage and picked off by safety
Ryan Murphy. But the Stanford
defense remained stout when it need
ed to be, sending Cooks and Woods
backwards on their carries and forc
ing the Beavers to settle for a 42-
yard field goal.
Four minutes later, the consistent
Romaine sent another 44-yarder
right down the middle, capping a
stretch that saw Oregon State
explode with 23 unanswered points
and take a two-possession lead.
Taylor's redemption couldn't have
come at a better time.
On second-and-6 at the Beavers
40-yard line, Hogan escaped what
appeared to be a sure sack by check
ing down to an isolated Taylor on the
left side of the field as he was going
down. Taylor dashed down the side
lines, cut back to the middle, convinc
ingly stiff-armed a defender onto the
ground and rumbled into the end
zone for a 40-yard touchdown that
got the team back into the game as
the third quarter ended.
"If [Hogan] doesn't see his pro
gression, I try to stay in his ear to hit
the check down and that I'm open,"
Taylor said. "He didn't see anything
downfield and I was downfield and he
saw me, so I was able to score. That
was where I'm supposed to be if I'm
not blocking anybody. He saw me
and I was able to get the ball."

The Doak Walker Award semifi
nalist would finish the game with
nineteen carries for 119 yards, 47
receptions yards and two touch
downs. Prior to his costly fumble in
the second quarter, Taylor became
the first running back in school histo
ry to have three straight 1,000-yard
rushing seasons.
"[Taylor's] done something that
nobody's been able to do," Shaw said.
"I can't say how proud I am of that
guy."

Stanford got a much-needed
break when Josh Mauro landed on
the lost fumble by Vaz, who had been
careful with protecting the ball all

afternoon. Setting up shop at the
Beavers' 29-yard line, an unflappable
Hogan drove the offense down the
field for the go-ahead, 13-yard touch
down strike to Ertz.

"I just saw good coverage," said
Hogan, who finished the game 22-of
-29 passing for 254 yards, three touch
downs and two interceptions. "They
were playing man. Anytime you can
get Zach one-on-one, not many peo
ple can cover him, if any. He ran a
great route to get behind the
defense. And made a great catch for
a touchdown."

As it has done all year, Stanford's
defense clamped down when it need
ed to and did not allow the Beavers to
cross midfield on their last two drives
of the game. Alex Debniak sealed the

deal with a 12-yard sack that took Vaz
out of the game, rewarding the
Cardinal's gutsy performance on
Senior Day with a victory.
"You want to win your last home
game," said Taylor. "You owe it to
your teammates, especially the sen
iors. You go through the whole sea
son and you don't want this last one
to get away."
Taylor and the seniors didn't let
this one get away.
Looking to pull off the huge upset
and capture the elusive Pac-12 North
Division title, Stanford travels to
Autzen this Saturday to square off
against big, bad No. 2 Oregon.

Redshirt junior tight end Zach Ertz (86) made up for an early fumble with a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Cardinal the
lead, allowing No. 14 Stanford to beat No. 11 Oregon State, 27-23, on Saturday. A midseason candidate for the John Mackey
Award, Ertz is also a candidate to declare for the NFL Draft early and is forecast as a likely first-round pick if he enters.
its next two possessions following a
pair of three-and-outs by the
Beavers.

With Kevin Hogan making his
first career start under center, the
Cardinal seemed to score at will in
the early going. Bad position field on
Stanford's own 7-yard line didn't faze
Hogan as the redshirt freshman
found three different targets
Levin Toilolo, Stepfan Taylor and
Kelsey Young for completions of
over ten yards. Hogan and Taylor
picked up big chunks of yardage with
their feet on back-to-back plays,
before Taylor punched it in for a 1-
yard touchdown run on third-and
goal. The 13-play, 93-yard drive was
Stanford's longest drive of the season
and gave it an early 7-0 lead.
"[Hogan's] earned our trust,"
Shaw said. "When you start a new
guy at quarterback early in the week,
we knew he could handle quite a bit,
but we didn't know how much. But by
the end of the week we knew we
could give him the ability to change
protections, runs to passes and pass
es to runs."
The Cardinal's next possession
ran just as smoothly. To get things
rolling, Hogan rolled out to his left
and dumped the ball off to fullback
Ryan Hewitt, who ran with it for 24
yards to midfield. The pah* would
hook up two more times on the same
chive, with the last one resulting in a
12-yard touchdown that came off the
play-action bootleg. Just like that,
the Cardinal extended its lead over
the Beavers to two touchdowns.
It seemed too good to be true and
it was, because Oregon State
responded emphatically in a hurry.
The Beavers finally found some
rhythm on offense to start the second
quarter. Quarterback Cody Vaz easi
ly connected with wideouts Brandin
Cooks and Markus Wheaton under
neath the coverage while running
back Storm Woods saw some day
light and picked up four first downs.
On second-and-three, Terron Ward
found the endzone from seven yards

out to cut into Stanford's lead 14-7.
Oregon State's defense also start
ed to lock down, sacking Hogan on
the next drive and forcing the
Cardinal to go three-and-out for the
first time that afternoon. Five con
secutive completions by Yaz had the
Beavers knocking on the door once
again, but a critical pass bat-down by
Chase Thomas on third-and-two held
Oregon State to a 19-yard field goal.
With Hogan running the two
minute drill efficiently, it seemed as if
the Cardinal would be able to put up
some points right before the half
ended. But the unthinkable hap
pened. Taylor, who hadn't fumbled in
his last 261 touches, lost the ball at
the Beavers 21-yard line. Although
the Stanford defense controlled the
damage, the team headed into the
locker room with a 14-10 lead instead
of the two-possession cushion it
could've had.

"That's uncharacteristic of us,
and the team will hear about it loud
and clear on Monday because that's
not us," Shaw commented on his
team's four turnovers. "And it was
two of our guys, two of our best play
ers: Stepfan Taylor and Zach Ertz.
Thankfully they came back, and
made some plays to win the game.
Shakespearean to a certain degree."
Whatever adjustments head
coach Mike Riley made earlier in the
game worked because the Beavers'
offense came out in the third quarter
firing on all cylinders. Helped out by
offside penalties called on nose guard
Terrence Stephens and inside line
backer Shayne Skoy Oregon State
moved the ball methodically with a
steady balance of run-and-pass
attack. The Cardinal defense seemed
to wake up when it forced the
Beavers into a third-and-16 situation
at the Stanford 22, but a wide-open
Wheaton took Vaz's short pass for a
22-yard touchdown.
For the first time all game, the
Cardinal found itself trailing.
It didn't help that on the
Cardinal's ensuing possession,

Hogan's pass was tipped at the line of
scrimmage and picked off by safety
Ryan Murphy. But the Stanford
defense remained stout when it need
ed to be, sending Cooks and Woods
backwards on their carries and forc
ing the Beavers to settle for a 42-
yard field goal.
Four minutes later, the consistent
Romaine sent another 44-yarder
right down the middle, capping a
stretch that saw Oregon State
explode with 23 unanswered points
and take a two-possession lead.
Taylor's redemption couldn't have
come at a better time.
On second-and-6 at the Beavers
40-yard line, Hogan escaped what
appeared to be a sure sack by check
ing down to an isolated Taylor on the
left side of the field as he was going
down. Taylor dashed down the side
lines, cut back to the middle, convinc
ingly stiff-armed a defender onto the
ground and rumbled into the end
zone for a 40-yard touchdown that
got the team back into the game as
the third quarter ended.
"If [Hogan] doesn't see his pro
gression, I try to stay in his ear to hit
the check down and that I'm open,"
Taylor said. "He didn't see anything
downfield and I was downfield and he
saw me, so I was able to score. That
was where I'm supposed to be if I'm
not blocking anybody. He saw me
and I was able to get the ball."

The Doak Walker Award semifi
nalist would finish the game with
nineteen carries for 119 yards, 47
receptions yards and two touch
downs. Prior to his costly fumble in
the second quarter, Taylor became
the first running back in school histo
ry to have three straight 1,000-yard
rushing seasons.
"[Taylor's] done something that
nobody's been able to do," Shaw said.
"I can't say how proud I am of that
guy."

Stanford got a much-needed
break when Josh Mauro landed on
the lost fumble by Vaz, who had been
careful with protecting the ball all

afternoon. Setting up shop at the
Beavers' 29-yard line, an unflappable
Hogan drove the offense down the
field for the go-ahead, 13-yard touch
down strike to Ertz.

"I just saw good coverage," said
Hogan, who finished the game 22-of
-29 passing for 254 yards, three touch
downs and two interceptions. "They
were playing man. Anytime you can
get Zach one-on-one, not many peo
ple can cover him, if any. He ran a
great route to get behind the
defense. And made a great catch for
a touchdown."

As it has done all year, Stanford's
defense clamped down when it need
ed to and did not allow the Beavers to
cross midfield on their last two drives
of the game. Alex Debniak sealed the

deal with a 12-yard sack that took Vaz
out of the game, rewarding the
Cardinal's gutsy performance on
Senior Day with a victory.
"You want to win your last home
game," said Taylor. "You owe it to
your teammates, especially the sen
iors. You go through the whole sea
son and you don't want this last one
to get away."
Taylor and the seniors didn't let
this one get away.
Looking to pull off the huge upset
and capture the elusive Pac-12 North
Division title, Stanford travels to
Autzen this Saturday to square off
against big, bad No. 2 Oregon.

In his first career start, redshirt freshman quarterback Kevin Hogan (8)
showed great poise leading Stanford's fourth-quarter rally to its win
over Oregon State. He finished with 254 yards and three TD passing.
It was a game of blown leads and inspir
ing comebacks, of frustrating turnovers and
flawless plays, of high emotions and relent
less physicality, of meeting adversity and
overcoming adversity and of mistakes and
redemption.
In short, it was everything college football
has to offer.

Oregon State kicker Trevor Romaine had
just nailed a 44-yard field goal right through
the uprights with five minutes left in the third
quarter. Stanford fans fell dead silent, incredu
lously watching then- team's early two-touch
down lead and Rose Bowl dreams dissipate in
the blink of an eye.

11/10, Stanford Stadium
In the visitor's section, Oregon State fans
erupted in a sea of orange, sensing that the
Beavers were poised to deliver the final cut
and parade out of the Farm with a trail of
felled Trees in their wake. After all, the
Beavers had just rattled off 23 unanswered
points and had all the momentum on its side.
