It was a game of blown leads and inspir
ing comebacks, of frustrating turnovers and
flawless plays, of high emotions and relent
less physicality, of meeting adversity and
overcoming adversity and of mistakes and
redemption.
In short, it was everything college football
has to offer.

Oregon State kicker Trevor Romaine had
just nailed a 44-yard field goal right through
the uprights with five minutes left in the third
quarter. Stanford fans fell dead silent, incredu
lously watching then- team's early two-touch
down lead and Rose Bowl dreams dissipate in
the blink of an eye.

In the visitor's section, Oregon State fans
erupted in a sea of orange, sensing that the
Beavers were poised to deliver the final cut
and parade out of the Farm with a trail of
felled Trees in their wake. After all, the
Beavers had just rattled off 23 unanswered
points and had all the momentum on its side.
But the Trees stood.

Overcoming four turnovers and a nine
point deficit with the third quarter winding
down, No. 13 Stanford (8-2, 6-1 Pac-12)
stormed back to upend No. 16 Oregon State

(7-2,5-2) 27-23 on an emotional Senior Day and
kept is conference championship and Rose
Bowl aspirations alive.
"I'll just start off first telling you guys what
I said to the team," head coach David Shaw
said. "Got emotional in there ... [For the sen
iors] to go through their careers, the state that
Stanford football was in four-plus years ago,
these guys came in with a great attitude,
they've worked extremely hard to make this a
great place for football."
The first half was a tale of two quarters for
the Cardinal.

Redshirt junior tight end Zach Ertz (86) made up for an early fumble with a fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Cardinal the
lead, allowing No. 14 Stanford to beat No. 11 Oregon State, 27-23, on Saturday. A midseason candidate for the John Mackey
Award, Ertz is also a candidate to declare for the NFL Draft early and is forecast as a likely first-round pick if he enters.
