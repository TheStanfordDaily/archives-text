## Denae Hannah: Dancing to New York City and back 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
A girl wearing an ill-fitting, bor
rowed leotard struggled to keep up
with the steps of the other dancers
whizzing by her. She didn't know
that it's considered bad form to talk
during auditions and asked her
peers whether they can make sense
of the choreography. They danced
on, ignoring her; clearly, she wasn't
going to make it.
Ten years later, Denae Hannah
'O6 is an acclaimed professional
dancer and choreographer in New
York, returning to Stanford to teach
in the same room she struggled so
mightily in during her years as an
undergraduate.
New York-based Hannah finds
herself back on the Farm this aca
demic year as a commissioned artist,
whose role is to not only to teach
theatre work to students as it is per
formed in the real world, but also to
offer them an insight into the life of
a professional.
Hannah did not always have her
heart set on dance. When she
arrived at Stanford, she had been a
cross-country runner for thirteen
years and only took up dance classes
as a means of staying fit.
Right away, Diane Franks, a lec
turer in choreography and modern
dance and now Hannah's rehearsal
director, saw physical talent, but
realized she had a project on her
hands.
"[Hannah's] body had an
appetite and a desire for challenge
that probably exceeded her skill set
at the time," she said.
Unlike many of her classmates,
Hannah had no prior dance experi
ence. Even by her own account, her
first dance audition "didn't go very
well."
"I participated in the Bates
Dance Festival during the summer
after my freshman year and was in
their work-study program. They
had dance classes for kids who were
in foster care or orphanages. I start
ed taking more [dance] classes dur
ing my sophomore year," she said.
During her sophomore summer
she used a Stanford research grant
to research the history of African-
American dance in New York City.
She began choreographing her own
work for her dance classes her jun
ior year.
Over time, personal experience
started to lead her down an artistic
path that fused her passions of
dance and social issues. Her current

work is imbued with an acute aware
ness of social realities.
She choreographed a comment
on the incarceration of young black
men, titled "Incarce(race)ion." The
dance resonated on a personal level:
at the time, her older brother was in
jail, serving a 10-year sentence.
"[My brother's sentence] was
always very much something on my
mind how [having a loved one in
jail] affects families," she said. "That
was the first time I brought some
thing really personal to my work."
Indeed, each of Hannah's choreo
graphies has a theme that enthralls
and challenges her as much as her
audience.
"Blue Magic," named after an
old-school hair product, is inspired
by black women's frustrations with
their hair. At its heart, it is a com
ment on the everyday struggles of
black women.
"The piece is about another plan
et, where there is no rain, humidity
or sweat or cotton pillowcases to
mess with black women's hair."
"Five Star Chick," her latest cre
ation, is inspired by a hip-hip song
by Yo Gotti about the perfect
woman.
"[The song] is this three-minute
long list of everything a woman is
supposed to be," she said. "I was
interested in addressing the subject
manner, but not in a teaching tone."
After selling performances of
"Five Star Chick" in New York, con
temporary dance's biggest city,
Hannah looks back through the
haze of her work and remembers
stepping out of the Stanford bubble
and being shocked by Big Apple cul
ture.
"NYC definitely has a drive to it.
There is a hustle. The risks are high
er. You have to approach your work
with more intensity and focus, and
be ready to go at all times. Stay
ready so you don't have to get
ready." she said. "You are your own
brand and you have to be able to sell
yourself in thirty seconds."
In many ways, however, she
never really lost touch: Stanford was
always very present, even in New
York. Continuing to communicate
with her professors played a role in
her decision to come back and teach.
"My relationship with profes
sors, I maintained them," she said.
"That was a big part of me coming
back."

be ready to go at all times. Stay
ready so you don't have to get
ready." she said. "You are your own
brand and you have to be able to sell
yourself in thirty seconds."
In many ways, however, she
never really lost touch: Stanford was
always very present, even in New
York. Continuing to communicate
with her professors played a role in
her decision to come back and teach.
"My relationship with profes
sors, I maintained them," she said.
"That was a big part of me coming
back."

A girl wearing an ill-fitting, bor
rowed leotard struggled to keep up
with the steps of the other dancers
whizzing by her. She didn't know
that it's considered bad form to talk
during auditions and asked her
peers whether they can make sense
of the choreography. They danced
on, ignoring her; clearly, she wasn't
going to make it.
Ten years later, Denae Hannah
'O6 is an acclaimed professional
dancer and choreographer in New
York, returning to Stanford to teach
in the same room she struggled so
mightily in during her years as an
undergraduate.
New York-based Hannah finds
herself back on the Farm this aca
demic year as a commissioned artist,
whose role is to not only to teach
theatre work to students as it is per
formed in the real world, but also to
offer them an insight into the life of
a professional.
Hannah did not always have her
heart set on dance. When she
arrived at Stanford, she had been a
cross-country runner for thirteen
years and only took up dance classes
as a means of staying fit.
Right away, Diane Franks, a lec
turer in choreography and modern
dance and now Hannah's rehearsal
director, saw physical talent, but
realized she had a project on her
hands.
"[Hannah's] body had an
appetite and a desire for challenge
that probably exceeded her skill set
at the time," she said.
Unlike many of her classmates,
Hannah had no prior dance experi
ence. Even by her own account, her
first dance audition "didn't go very
well."
"I participated in the Bates
Dance Festival during the summer
after my freshman year and was in
their work-study program. They
had dance classes for kids who were
in foster care or orphanages. I start
ed taking more [dance] classes dur
ing my sophomore year," she said.
During her sophomore summer
she used a Stanford research grant
to research the history of African-
American dance in New York City.
She began choreographing her own
work for her dance classes her jun
ior year.
Over time, personal experience
started to lead her down an artistic
path that fused her passions of
dance and social issues. Her current

work is imbued with an acute aware
ness of social realities.
She choreographed a comment
on the incarceration of young black
men, titled "Incarce(race)ion." The
dance resonated on a personal level:
at the time, her older brother was in
jail, serving a 10-year sentence.
"[My brother's sentence] was
always very much something on my
mind how [having a loved one in
jail] affects families," she said. "That
was the first time I brought some
thing really personal to my work."
Indeed, each of Hannah's choreo
graphies has a theme that enthralls
and challenges her as much as her
audience.
"Blue Magic," named after an
old-school hair product, is inspired
by black women's frustrations with
their hair. At its heart, it is a com
ment on the everyday struggles of
black women.
"The piece is about another plan
et, where there is no rain, humidity
or sweat or cotton pillowcases to
mess with black women's hair."
"Five Star Chick," her latest cre
ation, is inspired by a hip-hip song
by Yo Gotti about the perfect
woman.
"[The song] is this three-minute
long list of everything a woman is
supposed to be," she said. "I was
interested in addressing the subject
manner, but not in a teaching tone."
After selling performances of
"Five Star Chick" in New York, con
temporary dance's biggest city,
Hannah looks back through the
haze of her work and remembers
stepping out of the Stanford bubble
and being shocked by Big Apple cul
ture.
"NYC definitely has a drive to it.
There is a hustle. The risks are high
er. You have to approach your work
with more intensity and focus, and
be ready to go at all times. Stay
ready so you don't have to get
ready." she said. "You are your own
brand and you have to be able to sell
yourself in thirty seconds."
In many ways, however, she
never really lost touch: Stanford was
always very present, even in New
York. Continuing to communicate
with her professors played a role in
her decision to come back and teach.
"My relationship with profes
sors, I maintained them," she said.
"That was a big part of me coming
