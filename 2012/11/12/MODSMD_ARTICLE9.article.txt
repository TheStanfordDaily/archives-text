## View from across the Pond 
### Tom Taylor 
For the first time in eight
years, I sat on the sunny
side of Stanford Stadium
on Saturday. Far from the
noise and youthful enthusi
asm of the Red Zone, I was doing my
bit for the greater cause of Cardinal
football; I was introducing my parents
to college football.

My dad had actually been once
before, back in the days of the old bowl
when I'd only ever sat in the East side
of the stands, and when I still had no
concrete idea of what was going on out
on the field. Since I had found a real
interest and at least some under
standing — however, neither of my
folks had been through this; the clos
est they'd come had been watching a
quarter or so of the Orange Bowl with
me from the UK in 2011, before confu
sion and sleepiness had gotten the bet
ter of them.

Britain and the U.S. disagree pret
ty substantially on the subject of foot
ball. The most vocal and ill
informed on either side will dispar
age the other's definition of a sport,
and even among the moderate major
ity there is a feeling of suspicion based
in large part on a simple lack of knowl
edge. Not purely knowledge of the
rules, but rather of everything that
makes us fans. Stay up late in the UK
to watch the Super Bowl and it will
likely be an experience free of atmos
phere, emotion, fan vs. fan banter, his
tory, even those one-off commercials.
Suddenly it becomes an excruciatingly
long and mystifying contest keeping
us from the comfort of our beds.

The role of being an ambassador
for the sport was easy in the first quar
ter. That early Stanford fumble swept
aside, a 14-0 score raised hopes around
the stadium of the team's sixth home
win of the season. Relaxed and happy,
relaying the general rules and tactics
of the game and teaching my parents
some of the chants and synchronized
movements that I could both hear and
see across the field in the student sec
tion was enjoyable.

Oregon State's resurgence in the
second quarter dampened spirits a lit
tle, but added a bit of reality to the
whole contest. There was no way the
then-No. 11 team wouldn't score
against the then-No. 14 school; the
Beavers weren't exactly as overrated
as national-title chasing LSU from last
year. But it was the start of the second
half, the bulk of the third quarter,
which darkened a bright and sunny
day.

Late in the third, it dawned on me.
Not only did Stanford not seem to
have an answer to the Beavers, who
raced from 0-14 down to 23-14 ahead,
not only were any hopes of an upset
next weekend against Oregon becom
ing steadily meaningless, but sitting
parallel to the South end zone, my par
ents weren't even going to see, up
close, a Cardinal touchdown. So far,
every single point had been scored
down the other end of the field, the
end that was one hundred yards clos
er to Corvallis than to us.

With just seconds left on the clock,
on second-and-six, even though
Stanford had the ball, it was 40 yards
short of where it needed to be. For the
home team to win this one, we needed
to hope for as little action as possible
from hereon in.

Because of my persistence, my
parents had flown out here last week
end. They of course came to see me,
but I also wanted to give them a small
taste of college football; this (hopeful
ly) being my last year on the Farm, it
was their last chance to get that. When
I bought the tickets a few months
back, I had no idea how important this
game would be. I suspected Stanford
might already be out of the running
for any serious postseason action, and
even if it was still in with a shout, I did
n't expect a major challenge from
Oregon State.

Now it mattered, though. And now,
it looked over. I've never been good at
putting on a brave face in defeat —
and being both an England and
Reading FC fan I've had my fair share
of opportunities to practice and
now I had to find away to entertain
them through what was going to be a
painful fourth quarter and not waste
the few days that I had with them
under a cloud of sporting depression.
But then it happened: a trio of
Taylors sitting together in the stands
were treated to running back Stepfan
Taylor's sensational run from a
dumped pass that quarterback Kevin
Hogan barely released in time.
Somehow, he avoiding being forced
out of bounds and, cutting back infield,
stiff-armed his way out of trouble.
When a handful of Beavers finally
caught him it was already too late; the
clock may have run dead, but Taylor
had dragged Stanford back into this
contest.
The rest, as they say is history.
