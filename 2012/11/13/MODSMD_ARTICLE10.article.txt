## Ertz a semifinalist for John Mackey Award, Taylor for the Doak Walker 
### â€“ George Chen 
Redshirt junior tight end Zach
Ertz was named one of eight semi
finalists for the 2012 John Mackey
Award, given annually to the most
outstanding tight end in college
football.
Having piled up 47 catches for
641 yards and five touchdowns so
far this season, Ertz caught game
winning touchdowns against USC
and Oregon State. The redshirt
junior was also named John
Mackey Tight End of the Week in
September for his clutch touch
down reception against the
Trojans.
Despite not being on the John
Mackey Award preseason watch
list, Ertz has gained a consider
able amount of national attention
and is one of the top tight end
prospects for the 2013 NFL Draft
should he declare for the draft

after this year.
Senior halfback Stepfan Taylor
also made the cut as one of eight
semifinalists for the 2012 Doak
Walker Award, given annually to
the most outstanding collegiate
running back in the nation.
Taylor is averaging almost 118
yards on the grounds each game
and has 11 total touchdowns on the
season. En route to a 114-yard
rushing performance against the
nation's fifth-best run defense in
Oregon State last Saturday, Taylor
became the first player in school
history to have three consecutive
1,000-yard rushing seasons.
With at least three games left
in the season, Taylor needs 202
more yards to overtake Darrin
Nelson as the all-time Stanford
rushing leader.
The recipients of the John Mackey
Award and the Doak Walker
Award will both be announced on
Dec. 6.
