## Stanford falls to fourth in MPSF UCLA HANDS CARD FIFTH LOSS 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 3 Stanford took a third con
ference loss this Friday, putting a
damper on their late-season momen
tum and stifling their hopes for an
NCAA Tournament birth. The
Cardinal's prolific scoring duo, fresh
man driver Bret Bonanni and sopho
more utility Alex Bowen, were held
to a goal a piece as Stanford fell 9-5
at UCLA in their second-to-last reg
ular-season game.

11 /9, Los Angeles
Stanford (14-5, 4-3 MPSF) has
now lost all three of their in-confer
ence games against teams with win
ning Mountain Pacific Sports
Federations records. The Cardinal
will chop to fourth place in the con
ference, behind the three teams it
has lost to, USC, UCLA, and UC-

Berkeley, with one game left to play
before the Mountain Pacific Sports
Foundation (MPSF) Tournament.
The only route to the NCAA
postseason is now a first place finish
at the MPSF Tournament. Stanford
is out of the running for the one at
large bid to NCAAs since both USC
and UCLA have better records
overall and are undefeated in con
ference play (they play each other

in the season finale, which will
determine the top seed for the con
ference playoffs).
Friday's loss to UCLA ended
Stanford's six-game winning streak,
and it also ended Bonanni's streak
of six hat tricks in a row. Sophomore
utility Nick Hoversten tried to
make it up with two third-quarter
goals of his own, but they were not
enough.
Hoversten's goals kept the game
within striking distance the
score was 6-5 late in the third quar
ter — but the final nine minutes
went decisively in UCLAs favor.
The Bruins rode a fourth-quarter
shutout to score the last three goals
of the contest.
True to form, UCLAs scoring
was spread out throughout their
roster. Three players netted two
goals each, and three others chipped
in with a goal each. They have been
using this balanced formula all year
—which has allowed them to lead
the conference in scoring even
though they have only one player in
the top 15 in goals per game.
The second-ranked Bruin
defense came up big as well. They
were able to essentially shut down
Bonanni and Bowen, whom
Stanford has leaned on heavily dur
ing their winning streak. Both are
in the top six in scoring in the
league, and they have accounted for
over half of the Cardinal's total
goals this season.
The cluo kept Stanford close in
the early stages of the game
though. Bonanni's goal gave them a

2-1 advantage four minutes
into the first quarter. The
early lead was important for
Stanford, especially since they
were playing away from home
and had the UCLA fans to deal
with for a FHday night game.
Bowen's lone goal, which
halted a 3-0 run by UCLA,
made the score 4-3 going into
halftime. Going into the lock
er rooms, the evenly played
game was anyone's for the
taking.

The Bruins did take it in
the second half though, scor
ing twice in the first three
minutes of the third quarter
to build a 6-3 lead. Hoversten
kept Stanford's hopes alive
with his two goals, but the
fourth quarter was dominated
by UCLAs defense.
In the end, the game was

defined by UCLAs scoring
runs, and by Stanford's inabil
ity to respond on their offen
sive possessions.
It is a troubling trend for
Stanford, whose last four
losses have each come by at
least three goals. Just as trou
bling is that that those losses
have all come against the
teams they expect to face in
the later stages of the MPSF
Tournament.

Stanford is 0-2 against top
ranked USC, 0-1 against
UCLA, and 1-1 against third
seeded California (the win
came in the third-place game
of a preseason tournament).

Stanford now turns its
attention to its season finale
against Pacific, a team that has
proven it can compete with the
top teams in the conference.
That Senior Day game will be
Friday at 5 p.m. at Avery
Aquatic Center.

Stanford couldn't find the answers on offense at UCLA on
Friday, deflating the team's NCAA Tournament hopes. The
Card faces an uphill battle to win the MPSF.
