# Field hockey eliminated
## 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford field hockey
team's 2012 campaign came to a
close on Saturday morning in
Chapel Hill, N.C. The Cardinal (16-
7,6-0 NorPac) was eliminated in the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment with a 4-1 loss to No. 1 North
Carolina. Four different Tar Heels
registered goals, while Kelsey
Harbin scored for Stanford.

North Carolina, the two-time
national runner-up, opened the scor
ing just 10 minutes into the game
when sophomore Charlotte
Craddock blasted a hard shot from
the top of the circle.
In the 28th minute, the Tar
Heels doubled their lead when
Emma Bozek put a shot past
Stanford goalkeeper Dulcie
Davies and into the upper left cor
ner of the cage.
Davies and the Cardinal defense
fought off five penalty corners in the
first half to keep the deficit at two
through halftime; in the final game
of her freshman season, Davies tal
lied four saves.
Immediately after the break,
North Carolina took a 3-0 lead on a
deflection from the left side of the
net.
The Cardinal finally answered in
the 60th minute, when Harbin
scored her fifth goal of the season on
a penalty corner assisted by senior

Becky Dru. Until the sophomore's
goal, Stanford had not scored in an
NCAA Tournament game since
2010, also against North Carolina.
Stanford had 10 shots and four
penalty corners on the day but was
unable to add a second goal.
Cardinal attackers Dru, Harbin,
Alex McCawley and Maddie Secco
each had two shots as Stanford
unsuccessfully tried to close the gap
and extend its season.
In the 68th minute, the Tar
Heels all but put the game out of
reach when junior Sinead Loughran
finished a cross from Bozer for a 4-1
lead.
The Cardinal previously lost to
the Tar Heels 6-2 in September.
With this most recent loss, Stanford
fell to 0-12 in NCAA Tournament
games.
Stanford ended the year with a
16-7 record and a NorPac champi
onship.
"This season was a great suc
cess," said head coach Thra Danielson.
"We were absolutely undefeated in
our conference and decisively, I
should say, won our conference."
According to Danielson, the
team's tough nonconference sched
ule was designed to prepare them
for the postseason. Stanford played
three of the four NCAA semifinal
ists in the regular season. Stanford
also played the nation's top team
(at the time of the game) four dif
ferent times over the course of the
year. Although it never defeated
the top-ranked team, the Cardinal
did record signature wins against
then-No.lo lowa and then-No. 18
Drexel.
