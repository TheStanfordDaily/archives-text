## Have space for one more class next quarter? 
### Emily Cohodes 
Last week I wrote about
Stanford's need for a "well
ness" GER and explored how
this might change campus percep
tion of mental health stigma and
personal happiness. This week, I've
created a list of course suggestions
for winter quarter so you can take
advantage of the wonderful well
ness course offerings even with
out being required to do so! If you
have one or two units free in your
winter schedules, consider trying
out one of these winter courses on
wellness topics, on everything from
safe sex practices to emotional
intelligence.
