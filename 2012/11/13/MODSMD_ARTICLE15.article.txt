# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## The 						pain of caring 
### Chris Herries 
lam fortunate enough to be
staffing for the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center this quarter.
One important concept in counselling
is the idea of self-care. You cannot
help others if you yourself are
unwell. Therefore, the Bridge class,
which I highly recommend taking,
devotes an entire unit to taking care
of yourself both physically and emo
tionally.

Even so, some people may won
der why self-care is important. A lot
of peer counseling is fairly routine.
There are protocols to follow and
general structures we use to help
guide counselees. While no one type
of counseling maps perfectly onto
this system, there is a general flow to
follow that makes counseling easier.
It is not the stress of counseling itself
that makes self-care important. The
stress of caring about the people you
counsel is what weighs upon you
most heavily. Most people choose to
staff at the Bridge because they care

deeply about the mental health and
well-being of their peers. But caring
comes with a price.

Caring about people or causes
leads to an inevitable vulnerability.
That is what makes relationships so
difficult. If two people did not care
deeply about each other, then
breakups would be no big deal. A lot
of people do not even bother forming
these close relationships simply
because their dissolution hurts. But
therein lies the problem: The only
way to have a deep connection to
something or someone is to care
about it.

I feel that caring is not a popular
thing to do on Stanford's campus.
Excuses are often designed to
divorce us from caring about the sub
ject. When someone does poorly in a
class, I often hear them remark how
stupid the class is. I did poorly
because it's just a club sport. I'm not
calling him because he is not calling
me. I can show up late, it's just a pet

project. I got that "B" because my
TA is incompetent.

For most people, it is easier to go
through life claiming you do not have
a care in the world. It is easier to go
with the flow or just slip by. The fact
of the matter is, caring can really
suck. It can be an unimaginably diffi
cult thing to cope with. If you just
simply dispose of your cares, then
that pain will go away. I cannot lose
Mends I do not have, and I cannot
fail at something I never try.
The problem is, if you go through
life without giving a damn, one day
you will realize that you are numb.
You never had an intimate relation
ship because you were too afraid to
be weak. You never stood up for a
cause because you were embar
rassed. You never learned a new
hobby because bumbling around as a
beginner is not fun. You did not let
yourself get caught up in a passion
because you did not know where it
would lead. You were afraid of the
pain caring can bring.
But the people I most respect
are the ones that give a damn. This
does not just apply to Olympians or
Rhodes Scholars, though those peo

pie certainly demonstrate devotion.
Caring is the club rugby player on
my team who shows up half an hour
early to practice and stays late. It
is my friend who tried to show up at
my dorm with brownies when I was
feeling sad. It is the 70-year-old
man in my Greek mythology class
who just wants to learn. It is the
ASB leaders at the Haas Center
who invest themselves in social
causes.
Now is the time to honestly

assess who or what you care about.
Although caring can bring pain, it is
a requisite for love. Love is a mani
festation of the care and admiration
you invest into something or some
one. Tolstoy once wrote that "there
are as many loves as there are
hearts." That love starts with caring,
and caring is up to you.
