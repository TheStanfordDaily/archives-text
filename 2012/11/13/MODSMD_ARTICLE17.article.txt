# SITTIN' ON THE JOHN
## A 						long time ago, before Disney broke my heart 
### John Murray 
Disney recently bought my
childhood for $4.05 billion,
and I'm about as hurt as Luke
was when, yes, he found out who his
father was. Just look at George
Lucas' face when he signed away
part of his own soul/Lucasfilms. You
know what you did, George.
And you, Disney. Go to hell.
Look, I've seen money-grabbing
commercialization ruin a good
thing before (to put it in basic
terms), and I was mostly fine.
I could handle having Jersey
Shore shoved down my throat. I
could bear the fact that "Twilight"
might end up being the "Anna
Karenina" of our time. I don't mind
that Snoop Dogg, err, Lion, has
sold out to both the pistachio and
microwavable pizza-burrito indus
tries.
Nickelback doesn't even really
bother me that much.
Because there has always been
better TVJ literature and music;
there's always something else,
though maybe not as popular, that
can fill in.
But damn it Disney, there's only
one "Star Wars," and while the first
"Star Wars" movies may have
helped bring about the conception
of the big, epic blockbuster, this
isn't 1977, and when I hear that
Disney is going to try to release a
new "Star Wars" movie every two
or three years, it sounds to me like
a death sentence.
I admit that it's somewhat silly
to be making verdicts at this point
in reality, there's a slim chance
that these new movies could re
energize the series in away that
the recent "Skyfall" seems to have
done for the James Bond saga.
But I don't have much hope.
The idea of new "Star Wars"
movies simply screams of a corpo
rate studio-driven money grab.
Sure, every (or at least nearly
every) commercial movie is a prod
uct trying to be sold for a profit
but there is still variation in which

artistic qualities a studio is willing
to sacrifice and/or compromise for
the sake of the dollar. And when I
see things like "Angry Birds Star
Wars" or when I hear that Harrison
Ford, coming off a yes-I'm-that
desperate-for-money performance
in "Cowboys & Aliens," is "open" to
the idea of bringing Han Solo back
to the big screen in 2015, I can't
help but cringe.
Look, "Star Wars" is huge.
Beyond the six movies are count
less books, TV shows, video games,
action figures, Lego sets and
Halloween costumes. The bottom
line is that this seventh episode
won't be the first time "Star Wars"
has ventured beyond the original
movie series. But what's made
"Star Wars" so great is not just its
cultural relevance, but also its abil
ity to balance its popularity with a
feeling of inclusiveness. This is part
of what separates "Star Wars" from
similar ongoing series like James
Bond or Indiana Jones: "Star
Wars" is a cult, in the loosest of
interpretations. While membership
is free, there is a certain amount of
investment that is needed from a
viewer for him or her to fully appre
ciate the "Star Wars" movie experi

The idea of a
new"StarWars"
screams of
a corporate
money grab.
ence.
Which is part of what makes
this inevitable future endeavor so
tragic. Because there's something
about "Star Wars." There's some
thing beyond the lasers, and the
cute little Ewoks and James Earl
Jones' rumbling growl, something
in the heart of those first three
movies that simply connected with
viewers and fans at a different level
than the standard blockbuster
does. "Star Wars" wasn't
Hitchcock, but it wasn't
"Transformers" either. I can't put a
name on what makes "Star Wars"
special and wouldn't want to, for
fear of ruining it. But mark my
words, there was something there,
and no amount of Disney magic is
going to bring it back.
Disney doesn't make cult
movies, and as many fantastic
movies that have been made by the
big D, the odds are that this next
"Star Wars" will most likely be a
commercial success and a cinemat
ic failure.

Which, to be honest, may only
be fair.

After all, it was that first "Star
Wars" movie back in 1977 that gave
birth to the summer blockbuster:
Its emphasis was on a simple, good
vs. evil narrative, dosed in origi
nal special effects, loaded with
memorable lines and characters
and helping to generate a template
for how to make freakin' epic
movies.
But the summer blockbusters
have been stuck in a downward spi
ral for decades. "Star Wars" was
the first, and there have certainly
been some good ones since (see
"E.T." and "The Dark Knight"),
but this genre has been slowly
strangled by its over-emphasis on
eye-pleasing technology, and it's
hard to imagine these new "Star
Wars" breaking that cycle.
It can all be traced back to that
fateful opening scene from "A New
Hope": that first Imperial ship
never seeming to end, the possibil
ities for this new cinematic frontier
stretching before the virgin view
er's eyes.
But now it's past, and god
dammit, it looks like Mickey Mouse
is about to drive that thing straight
into oblivion.
Oh, a long time ago...
