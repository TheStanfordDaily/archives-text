# INSTANT REPLAY
## Pattern-match coverage 
### â€“ Winston Shi 
Last Saturday's football game against Oregon State was close from start to finish. On the
Beavers' final drive, Stanford faced a critical situation: up 27-23 on third and 4 at the
Oregon State 43. With 2:28 left in the fourth guarter and no OSU timeouts left, Stanford
could run out the clock and secure a victory with one last stop. As it turned out, Stanford
linebacker Alex Debniak sacked OSU guarterback Cody Vaz for a 12-yard loss on this play,
setting up a massive fourth and 16 that OSU failed to convert.

In desperation time, Oregon State has to
pass the ball. They line up with two
receivers to each side. Stanford comes out
in its nickel package (five defensive backs
instead of the usual four) and only three
players in the box (M and the two Ts).
Three linebackers (W, B and S) are posi
tioned outside in coverage, although B and
S still present the threat of a blitz. The two
safeties (F/S and S) are playing very deep
to take away the big play.
OSU's can run many different route

Post-flat: The Z receiver runs a deep post to
draw away the safeties, while the running
back (R) runs to the flat behind him. In
man coverage, the cornerback (C) opposite
the Z receiver should follow Z, leaving
nobody to cover R.
Double snags: The X and A receivers run
guick snag routes towards the middle of
the field, and if Stanford is playing zone
coverage, M (the only defender in the
area) should be in a bind as to whom to
cover.

combinations, providing options against
man and zone coverages in the same
play: the post-flat (Z and R), the double
snags (X and A), and the snag-wheel (A
and Y).

Snag-wheel: The A receiver sets a screen
for the Y receiver's wheel route before run
ning his snag route. This generally causes
mistakes and miscommunications in man
coverage.

Stanford only rushes three players at the
quarterback: the two tackles and Debniak
(B in the previous diagram). In addition,
the middle linebacker (M) plays slightly off
the OSU offensive line in case Vaz (Q) tries
to scramble for the first down. For ease of
reference, these four players are omitted
from the above diagram.
Stanford plays pattern-match cover
age, where the defensive players play tight
ly to the receivers within their zones. This
makes it harder for receivers to get open.
The key play is made by nickelback
Usua Amanam (N): Although OSU's play is
supposed to beat the W linebacker in zone

coverage with the double snags, Amanam
fights A's screen for Y long enough that A
doesn't complete his route in time, effec
tively blowing up the play.
Time, of course, is the most precious
commodity in football. A charging pass
rusher will sack the quarterback eventual
ly, even if it is three rushers against five
offensive linemen. With Stanford's cover
age blanketing OSU's receivers, Vaz has
nowhere to throw, and after five seconds
an eternity in the passing game
Debniak records his fourth sack of the year
and victory is, finally, in sight.
