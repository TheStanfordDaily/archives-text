# Dining hall employees seek balance
## Workers struggle to manage degree coursework and dining hall shifts 
### ANNA WOHL 
Victor Quiroz, a 27-year-old full
time chef at the Arrillaga Family
Dining Commons, is also a student.
Quiroz, who started cutting fruit for
Coffee House (CoHo) crepes when
he was 14, is currently pursuing his
bachelor's degree in accounting at
San Francisco State University
(SFSU). By his senior year of high
school, Quiroz was a full-time
employee working night shifts.
"I never saw myself cooking,"
Quiroz said. "It was just a weekend
job."

When the CoHo temporarily
closed in September 2007, Quiroz
moved to Stern Dining, where he
learned to cut vegetables and chick
en. Now he runs the omelette bar
and grill at Arrillaga Dining.
Quiroz is one of many dining hall
employees who moonlight as stu
dents, several of whom don't feel
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises supports or encour
ages them to pursue a degree.

'The other guys think I'm crazy'
Up until this year, Quiroz
worked at night and attended class
es in the mornings while earning his
associate degree in accounting from
Foothill College. Now he works at
Arrillaga from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
and takes classes towards his bach
elor's degree at SFSU after work.
Quiroz said he usually has time
to take three classes per semester
and is currently taking marketing,
Japanese history and ecotourism.

"One time I took a lot of classes
and I ended up failing because it
was too much work," he said. "But
even taking three is kind of hard. I
basically am either working or
studying."
Quiroz's biggest challenge is
time management.
"Last week, I ended up getting
off at work and staying here until
two or three in the morning," he
said. "Then I just didn't even go
home because I had to come back
here at 5:30 in the morning, so I just
did my homework here and came
downstairs and started working."
Despite the exhausting sched
ule, Quiroz said he has no doubts
about finishing his education. After
earning his bachelor's degree, he
wants to make the switch from chef
