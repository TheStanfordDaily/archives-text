# Dining hall employees seek balance
## Workers struggle to manage degree coursework and dining hall shifts 
### ANNA WOHL 
Victor Quiroz, a 27-year-old full
time chef at the Arrillaga Family
Dining Commons, is also a student.
Quiroz, who started cutting fruit for
Coffee House (CoHo) crepes when
he was 14, is currently pursuing his
bachelor's degree in accounting at
San Francisco State University
(SFSU). By his senior year of high
school, Quiroz was a full-time
employee working night shifts.
"I never saw myself cooking,"
Quiroz said. "It was just a weekend
job."

When the CoHo temporarily
closed in September 2007, Quiroz
moved to Stern Dining, where he
learned to cut vegetables and chick
en. Now he runs the omelette bar
and grill at Arrillaga Dining.
Quiroz is one of many dining hall
employees who moonlight as stu
dents, several of whom don't feel
Stanford Residential and Dining
Enterprises supports or encour
ages them to pursue a degree.

'The other guys think I'm crazy'
Up until this year, Quiroz
worked at night and attended class
es in the mornings while earning his
associate degree in accounting from
Foothill College. Now he works at
Arrillaga from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
and takes classes towards his bach
elor's degree at SFSU after work.
Quiroz said he usually has time
to take three classes per semester
and is currently taking marketing,
Japanese history and ecotourism.

"One time I took a lot of classes
and I ended up failing because it
was too much work," he said. "But
even taking three is kind of hard. I
basically am either working or
studying."
Quiroz's biggest challenge is
time management.
"Last week, I ended up getting
off at work and staying here until
two or three in the morning," he
said. "Then I just didn't even go
home because I had to come back
here at 5:30 in the morning, so I just
did my homework here and came
downstairs and started working."
Despite the exhausting sched
ule, Quiroz said he has no doubts
about finishing his education. After
earning his bachelor's degree, he
wants to make the switch from chef
to accountant.
"I feel like that is my obstacle: to
graduate," he said. "This job is
good, but I want to look for more
challenging jobs."
Although Quiroz said that he is
the only full-time chef at Arrillaga
who is also a student "The other
guys think I'm crazy because I
never get any sleep, and I'm always
tired," he said â€”the dual role is
relatively common among part-time
dining hall employees.
Part-time scheduling issues
For part-time employees, work
ing shifts at inconsistent times
makes it difficult to schedule class
es and find adequate time to study.
Ruby Segura, 19, works at Wilbur
Dining and takes sociology and
English at Foothill College.
"If you're working somewhere
else, you can start at a certain time
and finish at the end of the day," she
said. "But here it's set differently
every single time. If you want to
take a class in between that time,
but you can't work at a different
time, then sometimes you can't
work at all."
Stephanie Ortiz, who works at
Stern Dining and is a student at
Foothill College, said her dining
managers take her class schedule
into account.
"Sometimes we'll let them know
if we have an upcoming test. I
remember on Wednesday I had a
chemistry test, and I couldn't come
on TUesday, and they were really
flexible about that," Ortiz said.
In addition to chemistry, Ortiz,
22, is taking microbiology, history
and yoga. She is majoring in nutri
tion and international relations and
is currently pursuing local intern
ships focused on nutrition.
Other part-time employees
expressed a different sentiment
about encouragement from the
management. Stephanie Martinez
works at Wilbur Dining and takes

classes at Canada College.
"They don't really support us on
that side," Martinez said other edu
cational commitments. She added
that while management is under
standing of conflicts, there is little
encouragement to pursue educa
tion.

Martinez plans to transfer from
Canada College to SFSU and study
to become a nurse.

"At first I wanted to be a pedia
trician, but it costs a lot of money,
and I'm not really in that position,"
she said. "I think for someone who
grows up with the money, it's easier.
I have to actually work for myself to
go to school."

Dom Lacy is planning to start
classes at San Jose City College in
the spring. In addition to working
at Wilbur Dining, he works part
time for UPS in San Jose.

"They don't really encourage it
[at Stanford]," Lacy said of his
choice to pursue an education. "At
UPS, they give you a $2,000 reim
bursement for school. They really,
really push you to go to school, and
that's one of the reasons why I'm
going. Here, people tell me I should
go to school but only as a personal
thing, not business."
Lacy hopes to complete the gen
eral education program at San Jose
City College, transfer to San Jose

State University and eventually
find a career in law enforcement.

Stern Dining employee Silvia
Ramirez, a psychology major at
Foothill College, hopes to transfer
to Santa Clara University and
become a guidance counselor at a
middle school. Despite the chal
lenges of balancing a busy work and
school schedule, Ramirez said that
getting her education is worth it.
"You just have to prioritize,"
Ramirez said. "What's more impor
tant to you: school or work? For me,
it's school."
