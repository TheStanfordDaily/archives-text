# Classified docs displayed at Hoover Archives
## Four documents on Bahrain removed after FBI investigation 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
The Hoover Institution unwittingly displayed clas
sified documents to the public in a collection donated
by James Hitselberger, a linguist contracted by the
Navy, according to an Aug. 6 affidavit filed by the FBI.
The affidavit was unsealed on Nov. 5.

Hitselberger was charged on two counts of unlawful
retention of national defense information under the
Espionage Act, for which he pleaded not guilty on Oct.
26.

The information in question came from several doc
uments, some of which were reports from the Joint
Special Operations Task Force, and one of which was a
regional analysis conducted by the Navy Central
Command.

An investigation conducted jointly by the FBI and
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
yielded the information that four documents with
secret classification had been stored in public and pri
vate sections of the Hoover Archives.

Hitselberger, a Georgetown graduate in Arabic and
history, worked as a linguist for the communications
company Titan Corp. in a variety of "forward operat
ing locations" in Iraq from October 2004 to February
2007. After a hiatus from translating, he resumed lin
guistic work in June 2011 with Global Linguist
Solutions (GLS), a Virginia-based contracting compa
ny that provides linguistic support for the U.S. military
effort.

After receiving counterintelligence screening from
GLS, Hitselberger was deployed to Bahrain in
September 2011 to support the Joint Special
Operations Task Force-Gulf Cooperation Council
(JSOTF). He served as a translator and was privy to
raw intelligence data in Arabic,

"Through this data, Hitselberger obtained intimate
knowledge of sensitive source operations, including true
names and addresses of sources," the affidavit claims.

Lost documents and travels
On April 11, 2012, Hitselberger was observed by


MADELINE SIDES/The Stanford Daily
The Hoover Archives, in the foreground, accidentally displayed classified documents.

two of his supervisors printing
two documents classified as
secret in the JSOTF restricted
access area and then putting them
in his backpack and leaving the
office, an action for which he was
not authorized.
He was followed and confronted
and he gave up the documents
after a discussion with two of his
superiors. This purported attempt
to take the documents prompted a
search and seizure of Hitselberger's
living quarters, which resulted in
the discovery of a part of another
confidential document that was
later found to be a report on U.S.
forces and their activities in the
region.

The document had been manu
ally altered in such away that the
classification markings in the
header and footer had been
removed. In two interviews with
Hitselberger conducted by NCIS
agents he claimed ignorance about
the classification of the documents
and said he had printed the materi
als to read in his quarters.
Due to security concerns, on
April 12 Hitselberger was removed
from Bahrain by GLS after a
request from JSOTF to have him
replaced. On a layover in Germany
on the same day, he "abruptly
changed his travel plans and left
the airport." According to a GLS

security officer, Hitselberger was
"highly deceptive" with GLS as to
his travel plans and eventually,
according to information from his
email accounts, was found to have
subsequently traveled to Sweden,
Malta, Bulgaria and Albania.

Classified materials in the
archive
It was in the interviews conduct
ed by the NCIS that Hitselberger
informed the authorities of his col
lection at the Hoover Archives.

On an unspecified date "agents
visited the Hoover Archives and
reviewed the collection. In an area
open to the public, the agents
found a classified document titled,
'Bahrain Situation Update' dated
Feb. 13, 2012."

The document was altered sim
ilarly to the one in Hitselberger's
room, and another similar docu
ment was found in the Hoover
Archive's public collections. In the
nonpublic areas, "agents also discov
ered two other documents marked
secret" and a correspondence between
Hitselberger and the former asso
ciate archivist for collection for the
Hoover Archives showing that he
was aware of the fact that the doc
ument was classified.

FBI agents later interviewed
the deputy archivist at the Hoover
Institute (presumed to be Linda
Bernard) who, after the interview,
informed Hitselberger in an email
that "in light of the FBI investiga
tion of your collection here at
Hoover, we will no longer accept
additions to the collection, as we

don't want to risk receiving more
classified material."
"There were classified materi
als? I am sure they brought
unwanted excitement. Yes, there
was indeed an incident in Bahrain.
I was unable to locate my regular
reading glasses that day over a
month ago and I did not notice the
'secret' designation at the bottom,"
Hitselberger responded, according
to the FBI affidavit, which claimed
his response contained "a number
of falsehoods."
Representatives of the Hoover
Archives declined to comment for
this article and would not discuss
the details of the investigation with
The Daily.
Collection contents
A Daily examination of ten of
the boxes within the Hitselberger
Collection showed that Hitselberger
had kept a number of diverse
materials over a period spanning
from 1978 to 2012. The collection,
which included 18 unique boxes of
materials donated to the Hoover
Archives, was eclectic and included
materials from Iran, the United
States, Iraq and Bahrain.
Hitselberger's documents from
his time in Iran mostly consisted
of materials created by the
Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, or the
People's Mujahedin of Iran.

The Online Archive of California's
website describe the contents of
Hitselberger's Iran folders as
"broadsides, flyers, leaflets, serial
issues and sound recordings, relat
ing to political conditions in Iran

under the reign of the Shah, the
Iranian political opposition, the
revolution of 1979, post-revolution
ary conditions in Iran, and political
opposition to the new Iranian
regime." Most of the materials are

in Farsi.
The archive also housed a num
ber of documents of mixed political
opinions in English produced by
student groups at Georgetown
University, presumably from
Hitselberger's time as a student.

More recent materials included
several boxes of 2006 newspapers.
The majority of the periodicals
kept by Hitselberger were Iraqi,
Arabic-medium newspapers.
Among the most common ones were
A1 Sabah al-Jadeed, Addustour
Iraq, Al-Adala and Al-Mada.

There were also several
English-medium military news
materials found in Hitselberger's
collections, including Phantom
News and Ivy Leaf.
The most recent boxes princi
pally contained flyers, advertise
ments, Grand Prix promotional
materials and emails from his time
in Bahrain. The handwritten notes
attached to each item seemed to
suggest a disdain for Bahrain's rul
ing regime and a number of docu
ments produced by government
opposition groups were also found.
One example of an email found
was regarding "Joint Security
Area Bahrain Liberty Policy,"
which detailed security concerns
and measures to be taken to pre
vent harm to U.S. forces, civilians
and contractors in the context of

anti-government protests in
December 2011.

The Daily's examination of
Hitselberger's most recent
archives did not reveal any docu
ments similar to the ones that the
FBI detailed in their criminal com
plaint. Carol Leadenham, associ
ate archivist, refused to comment
on whether or not the relevant doc
uments had indeed been removed
from the collection.
Aftermath and extradition
After eight months, during
which the FBI claims he lived "as a
fugitive," a statement Hitselberger's
counsel has strongly protested,
Hitselbei'ger was extradited from
Kuwait. Although authorities were
aware of his whereabouts, the
countries in which he was traveling
would not extradite him for a polit
ical offense.
Deborah Robinson, U.S. magis
trate judge, ordered that Hitselberger
be held without bond pursuant to
the Order of Detention filed by the
FBI.
"While the government con
cedes that Defendant has no histo
ry of violence and did not dissemi
nate the classified information to a
"foreign power,"... the undersigned
finds that Defendant's retention of
classified documents poses a dan
ger to the community by potentially
compromising national security,"
she wrote in a Nov. 5 memorandum

The Hoover Institution unwittingly displayed clas
sified documents to the public in a collection donated
by James Hitselberger, a linguist contracted by the
Navy, according to an Aug. 6 affidavit filed by the FBI.
The affidavit was unsealed on Nov. 5.

Hitselberger was charged on two counts of unlawful
retention of national defense information under the
Espionage Act, for which he pleaded not guilty on Oct.
26.

The information in question came from several doc
uments, some of which were reports from the Joint
Special Operations Task Force, and one of which was a
regional analysis conducted by the Navy Central
Command.

An investigation conducted jointly by the FBI and
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
yielded the information that four documents with
secret classification had been stored in public and pri
vate sections of the Hoover Archives.

Hitselberger, a Georgetown graduate in Arabic and
history, worked as a linguist for the communications
company Titan Corp. in a variety of "forward operat
ing locations" in Iraq from October 2004 to February
2007. After a hiatus from translating, he resumed lin
guistic work in June 2011 with Global Linguist
Solutions (GLS), a Virginia-based contracting compa
ny that provides linguistic support for the U.S. military
effort.

After receiving counterintelligence screening from
GLS, Hitselberger was deployed to Bahrain in
September 2011 to support the Joint Special
Operations Task Force-Gulf Cooperation Council
(JSOTF). He served as a translator and was privy to
raw intelligence data in Arabic,

"Through this data, Hitselberger obtained intimate
knowledge of sensitive source operations, including true
names and addresses of sources," the affidavit claims.

Lost documents and travels
On April 11, 2012, Hitselberger was observed by

The donor has been charged with unlawfully retaining national defense information.
two of his supervisors printing
two documents classified as
secret in the JSOTF restricted
access area and then putting them
in his backpack and leaving the
office, an action for which he was
not authorized.
He was followed and confronted
and he gave up the documents
after a discussion with two of his
superiors. This purported attempt
to take the documents prompted a
search and seizure of Hitselberger's
living quarters, which resulted in
the discovery of a part of another
confidential document that was
later found to be a report on U.S.
forces and their activities in the
region.

The document had been manu
ally altered in such away that the
classification markings in the
header and footer had been
removed. In two interviews with
Hitselberger conducted by NCIS
agents he claimed ignorance about
the classification of the documents
and said he had printed the materi
als to read in his quarters.
Due to security concerns, on
April 12 Hitselberger was removed
from Bahrain by GLS after a
request from JSOTF to have him
replaced. On a layover in Germany
on the same day, he "abruptly
changed his travel plans and left
the airport." According to a GLS

security officer, Hitselberger was
"highly deceptive" with GLS as to
his travel plans and eventually,
according to information from his
email accounts, was found to have
subsequently traveled to Sweden,
Malta, Bulgaria and Albania.

Classified materials in the
archive
It was in the interviews conduct
ed by the NCIS that Hitselberger
informed the authorities of his col
lection at the Hoover Archives.

On an unspecified date "agents
visited the Hoover Archives and
reviewed the collection. In an area
open to the public, the agents
found a classified document titled,
'Bahrain Situation Update' dated
Feb. 13, 2012."

The document was altered sim
ilarly to the one in Hitselberger's
room, and another similar docu
ment was found in the Hoover
Archive's public collections. In the
nonpublic areas, "agents also discov
ered two other documents marked
secret" and a correspondence between
Hitselberger and the former asso
ciate archivist for collection for the
Hoover Archives showing that he
was aware of the fact that the doc
ument was classified.

FBI agents later interviewed
the deputy archivist at the Hoover
Institute (presumed to be Linda
Bernard) who, after the interview,
informed Hitselberger in an email
that "in light of the FBI investiga
tion of your collection here at
Hoover, we will no longer accept
additions to the collection, as we

don't want to risk receiving more
classified material."
"There were classified materi
als? I am sure they brought
unwanted excitement. Yes, there
was indeed an incident in Bahrain.
I was unable to locate my regular
reading glasses that day over a
month ago and I did not notice the
'secret' designation at the bottom,"
Hitselberger responded, according
to the FBI affidavit, which claimed
his response contained "a number
of falsehoods."

Collection contents
A Daily examination of ten of
the boxes within the Hitselberger

had kept a number of diverse
materials over a period spanning
from 1978 to 2012. The collection,
which included 18 unique boxes of
materials donated to the Hoover
Archives, was eclectic and included
materials from Iran, the United
States, Iraq and Bahrain.
Hitselberger's documents from
his time in Iran mostly consisted
of materials created by the
Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, or the
People's Mujahedin of Iran.

The Online Archive of California's
website describe the contents of
Hitselberger's Iran folders as
"broadsides, flyers, leaflets, serial
issues and sound recordings, relat
ing to political conditions in Iran

under the reign of the Shah, the
Iranian political opposition, the
revolution of 1979, post-revolution
ary conditions in Iran, and political
opposition to the new Iranian

It was in the interviews conduct
ed by the NCIS that Hitselberger
informed the authorities of his col
lection at the Hoover Archives.

On an unspecified date "agents
visited the Hoover Archives and
reviewed the collection. In an area
open to the public, the agents
found a classified document titled,
'Bahrain Situation Update' dated
Feb. 13, 2012."

The document was altered sim
ilarly to the one in Hitselberger's
room, and another similar docu
ment was found in the Hoover
Archive's public collections. In the
nonpublic areas, "agents also discov
ered two other documents marked
secret" and a correspondence between
Hitselberger and the former asso
ciate archivist for collection for the
Hoover Archives showing that he
was aware of the fact that the doc
ument was classified.

FBI agents later interviewed
the deputy archivist at the Hoover
Institute (presumed to be Linda
Bernard) who, after the interview,
informed Hitselberger in an email
that "in light of the FBI investiga
tion of your collection here at
Hoover, we will no longer accept
additions to the collection, as we

don't want to risk receiving more
classified material."
"There were classified materi
als? I am sure they brought
unwanted excitement. Yes, there
was indeed an incident in Bahrain.
I was unable to locate my regular
reading glasses that day over a
month ago and I did not notice the
'secret' designation at the bottom,"
Hitselberger responded, according
to the FBI affidavit, which claimed
his response contained "a number
of falsehoods."
Representatives of the Hoover
Archives declined to comment for
this article and would not discuss
the details of the investigation with
The Daily.
Collection contents
A Daily examination of ten of
the boxes within the Hitselberger
Collection showed that Hitselberger
had kept a number of diverse
materials over a period spanning
from 1978 to 2012. The collection,
which included 18 unique boxes of
materials donated to the Hoover
Archives, was eclectic and included
materials from Iran, the United
States, Iraq and Bahrain.
Hitselberger's documents from
his time in Iran mostly consisted
of materials created by the
Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, or the
People's Mujahedin of Iran.

The Online Archive of California's
website describe the contents of
Hitselberger's Iran folders as
"broadsides, flyers, leaflets, serial
issues and sound recordings, relat
ing to political conditions in Iran

under the reign of the Shah, the
Iranian political opposition, the
revolution of 1979, post-revolution
ary conditions in Iran, and political
opposition to the new Iranian
regime." Most of the materials are

in Farsi.
The archive also housed a num
ber of documents of mixed political
opinions in English produced by
student groups at Georgetown
University, presumably from
Hitselberger's time as a student.

More recent materials included
several boxes of 2006 newspapers.
The majority of the periodicals
kept by Hitselberger were Iraqi,
Arabic-medium newspapers.
Among the most common ones were
A1 Sabah al-Jadeed, Addustour
Iraq, Al-Adala and Al-Mada.

There were also several
English-medium military news
materials found in Hitselberger's
collections, including Phantom
News and Ivy Leaf.
The most recent boxes princi
pally contained flyers, advertise
ments, Grand Prix promotional
materials and emails from his time
in Bahrain. The handwritten notes
attached to each item seemed to
suggest a disdain for Bahrain's rul
ing regime and a number of docu
ments produced by government
opposition groups were also found.
One example of an email found
was regarding "Joint Security
Area Bahrain Liberty Policy,"
which detailed security concerns
and measures to be taken to pre
vent harm to U.S. forces, civilians
and contractors in the context of

anti-government protests in
December 2011.

The Daily's examination of
Hitselberger's most recent
archives did not reveal any docu
ments similar to the ones that the
FBI detailed in their criminal com
plaint. Carol Leadenham, associ
ate archivist, refused to comment
on whether or not the relevant doc
uments had indeed been removed
from the collection.
Aftermath and extradition
After eight months, during
which the FBI claims he lived "as a
fugitive," a statement Hitselberger's
counsel has strongly protested,
Hitselbei'ger was extradited from
Kuwait. Although authorities were
aware of his whereabouts, the
countries in which he was traveling
would not extradite him for a polit
ical offense.
Deborah Robinson, U.S. magis
trate judge, ordered that Hitselberger
be held without bond pursuant to
the Order of Detention filed by the
FBI.
"While the government con
cedes that Defendant has no histo
ry of violence and did not dissemi
nate the classified information to a
"foreign power,"... the undersigned
finds that Defendant's retention of
classified documents poses a dan
ger to the community by potentially
compromising national security,"
she wrote in a Nov. 5 memorandum
of findings.
