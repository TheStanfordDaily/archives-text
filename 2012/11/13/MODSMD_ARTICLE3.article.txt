# Classified docs displayed at Hoover Archives
## Four documents on Bahrain removed after FBI investigation 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
The Hoover Institution unwittingly displayed clas
sified documents to the public in a collection donated
by James Hitselberger, a linguist contracted by the
Navy, according to an Aug. 6 affidavit filed by the FBI.
The affidavit was unsealed on Nov. 5.

Hitselberger was charged on two counts of unlawful
retention of national defense information under the
Espionage Act, for which he pleaded not guilty on Oct.
26.

The information in question came from several doc
uments, some of which were reports from the Joint
Special Operations Task Force, and one of which was a
regional analysis conducted by the Navy Central
Command.

An investigation conducted jointly by the FBI and
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)
yielded the information that four documents with
secret classification had been stored in public and pri
vate sections of the Hoover Archives.

Hitselberger, a Georgetown graduate in Arabic and
history, worked as a linguist for the communications
company Titan Corp. in a variety of "forward operat
ing locations" in Iraq from October 2004 to February
2007. After a hiatus from translating, he resumed lin
guistic work in June 2011 with Global Linguist
Solutions (GLS), a Virginia-based contracting compa
ny that provides linguistic support for the U.S. military
effort.

After receiving counterintelligence screening from
GLS, Hitselberger was deployed to Bahrain in
September 2011 to support the Joint Special
Operations Task Force-Gulf Cooperation Council
(JSOTF). He served as a translator and was privy to
raw intelligence data in Arabic,

"Through this data, Hitselberger obtained intimate
knowledge of sensitive source operations, including true
names and addresses of sources," the affidavit claims.
