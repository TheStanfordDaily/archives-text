## Stanford researchers develop self-healing'skin' 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Alice Phillips 
A Stanford School of Engineering research
group has developed a skin-like synthetic mate
rial that heals itself in 30 minutes if torn or cut.

Led by chemical engineering professor
Zhenan Bao, the team created the material from
a mix of plastic polymers, which give the materi
al its self-healing ability, and nickel particles,

which give the material its conductive property.
To test the material's conductive properties,
the researchers cut a strip in half with a scalpel.
Seventy-five seconds later they rejoined the
material at the incision site and observed that
the material retained 75 percent of both its orig
inal strength and electrical conductivity within
seconds. In half an hour, the material regained
nearly 100 percent functionality. The team also
found that the same material could be cut and
repaired as many as 50 times while maintaining
its original bending and stretching capabilities.
The plastic was made up of long polymers
connected by weak hydrogen bonds, allowing for

easy reconnection of the easily broken bonds
upon damage.

Chee-Keong Tee, lead author on the research
paper published in Nature Nanotechnology on
Nov. 11, said that the material would be able to
detect the pressure of a handshake and other
physiological properties like pressure and flex
ion in ways that would make the material useful
in prosthetics.

Because the nickel particles conduct the elec
tricity in the material, changing distances
between nickel particles causes a change in elec-
trical current flow. This can then
register as pressure or tension
information.
Potential commercial uses include
using the material to coat wiring or
electronic screens.
According to Bao, previous dis
coveries in self-healing materials
had always presented major prob
lems such as the need to be exposed
to high temperature to function, the
ability to heal only once or the
inability to conduct electricity.
