# CAMPUS LIFE
## Campus families find a home in EV

LaToya Baldwin Clarke's alarm
goes off at 6:45 a.m. She barely has time
to wish her husband a good day before
he is out the door and off to work. By
7:45 a.m. she yells, "Let's go!" to her
two oldest children, Ahmir and Amina,
and soon all three mount their scooters
to head over to Escondido Elementary
School. After kisses goodbye, Baldwin
Clarke goes back home to greet the
babysitter for her six-month-old son,
Ahman. By 9 a.m. she is in a classroom
at the Stanford Law School, looking
forward to family dinner later in the
night.
Baldwin Clarke is a sixth-year grad
uate student and J.DyPh.D. candidate
in sociology and law. Her family lives in
a relatively large house in Escondido
Village (EV), surrounded by 254 other
graduate student families. EV is the
only on-campus housing for graduate
students with families.
While their home is on the larger
side, since her family falls into the 13
percent of EV families with three or
more children, the Clarkes' backyard is

the same as everyone else's: a grassy
park with a playground in the middle,
complete with a jungle gym, swings
and a sandbox. There are nine of these
courtyards that interconnect the EV
houses.

"I haven't seen anything in the sur
rounding areas that is comparable in
price or a better place to raise a child,"
said Diego Roman, a fifth-year gradu
ate student in the School of Education.

"In my courtyard, kids range from
zero to three, so they all play with each
other and it makes for a fantastic place
to have Mends... and to talk about your
kids," Roman said. "You're all having
the same experience."

Roman's son, Andres, is two and a
half, and knows how to show it on his
fingers. The Roman family's one-child
house in Escondido Village has a play
table decked out with a Thomas the
Tank Engine play set in their living
room.

"I want to show you something!"
shouts Andres, mimicking his "Papi,"
who is providing a tour of the house.

LaToya Baldwin Clarke reads with her children in their Escondido Village home. There are 255 graduate
student families living in EV's nine courtyards for student families, the only such on-campus
housing. One-third of graduate student families are international and 13 percent have three or
more children.
