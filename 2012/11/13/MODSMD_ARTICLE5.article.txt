# CAMPUS LIFE
## Campus families find a home in EV 
### LIAM KINNEY 
LaToya Baldwin Clarke's alarm
goes off at 6:45 a.m. She barely has time
to wish her husband a good day before
he is out the door and off to work. By
7:45 a.m. she yells, "Let's go!" to her
two oldest children, Ahmir and Amina,
and soon all three mount their scooters
to head over to Escondido Elementary
School. After kisses goodbye, Baldwin
Clarke goes back home to greet the
babysitter for her six-month-old son,
Ahman. By 9 a.m. she is in a classroom
at the Stanford Law School, looking
forward to family dinner later in the
night.
Baldwin Clarke is a sixth-year grad
uate student and J.DyPh.D. candidate
in sociology and law. Her family lives in
a relatively large house in Escondido
Village (EV), surrounded by 254 other
graduate student families. EV is the
only on-campus housing for graduate
students with families.
While their home is on the larger
side, since her family falls into the 13
percent of EV families with three or
more children, the Clarkes' backyard is

the same as everyone else's: a grassy
park with a playground in the middle,
complete with a jungle gym, swings
and a sandbox. There are nine of these
courtyards that interconnect the EV
houses.

"I haven't seen anything in the sur
rounding areas that is comparable in
price or a better place to raise a child,"
said Diego Roman, a fifth-year gradu
ate student in the School of Education.

"In my courtyard, kids range from
zero to three, so they all play with each
other and it makes for a fantastic place
to have Mends... and to talk about your
kids," Roman said. "You're all having
the same experience."

Roman's son, Andres, is two and a
half, and knows how to show it on his
fingers. The Roman family's one-child
house in Escondido Village has a play
table decked out with a Thomas the
Tank Engine play set in their living
room.

"I want to show you something!"
shouts Andres, mimicking his "Papi,"
who is providing a tour of the house.

LaToya Baldwin Clarke reads with her children in their Escondido Village home. There are 255 graduate
student families living in EV's nine courtyards for student families, the only such on-campus
housing. One-third of graduate student families are international and 13 percent have three or
more children.
Roman responds to his child in
Spanish and Andres' mother repeats
to him in English, "Do you want to
show him Thomas?"
Roman explains that a multilin
gual household is not uncommon in
EY; the couple next door is from
Israel, and they speak to their child in
Hebrew. International students con
stitute one-third of graduate student
families at Stanford.
This diversity is an integral part of
the courtyard atmosphere. Andres,
for example, knows all of the neigh
boring children. The Roman family
regularly attends barbeques with
their neighbors.
Guinevere Allen, a second-year
Ph.D. student in the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages
and single mother, came to Stanford
from her graduate program at UC-
Berkeley. She does not regret her
move to Stanford because of the
unparalleled community in EY but
she has noticed a decline in financial
support.
'At UC-Berkeley, because it's a
large public school, they have more
democratic funds available," Allen
said.
Allen used to receive a grant
worth $B,OOO each year and a full
funding state subsidy for her son to
attend a private preschool.
"Those types of programs that I
feel are more geared towards minori
ty situations do not yet exist at
Stanford," Allen said.
Roman also acknowledged the
financial issue. He claimed that hav
ing a spouse who works is a huge
advantage in terms of receiving
health care benefits and another
source of income. Roman said that a
graduate student stipend is not
enough to raise a family especially
since rent at Escondido Village is paid
yearly with no monthly payment
plan.
"Grad students aren't used to pay
ing so much up front," he said. "Then,
if there's an emergency, what do we
have?"

Despite occasional flare-ups between
EV residents and the University, such
as an incident a few years ago when
EV was renovated and parents rallied
together to voice then- disapproval for
cutting down trees in the parks and
another in August regarding herbicide
spray graduate student families report
high levels of satisfaction with then*
housing.
Eighty-two percent of Baldwin
Clarke's neighbors agree that they
"feel people in this community care
about each other" according to the
2010-11 survey of graduate student
families living in EV by the Office of
the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education. One hundred sixty-two
survey responses noted a positive
response of community organization
in EV with 74 percent reporting they
feel connected to others in the EV
community.
The University employs nine
graduate students, called courtyard
assistants (CAs), to overlook the
upkeep of the parks and to organize
monthly and holiday events within

their respective courtyards.
"The courtyard assistants have
their own fund, and about once a
month we have a courtyard party,"
Allen said. "They hired a bluegrass
music artist last month and next
month they're doing holiday photog
raphy for our neighborhood."
The CAs also respond to requests
and complaints from within court
yards. Roman claims that when his
washing machine broke, the CA
called in a mechanic and the school
paid for it. Eighty-seven percent of
respondents to the 2010-11 survey
reported that CA communication is
effective.
While EV housing provides cer
tain conveniences, for some families it
doesn't provide the necessary perma
nence of a family home.
Anna Baumgarten and her hus
band Magnus Johansson, a postdoc
toral research fellow in the School of
Medicine, chose apartments off cam
pus when they moved here from
Sweden with their three children this
past summer. They prefer to live in a
place they could call home even after
Johansson finishes his post-doctoral
work in structural biology.
"We're only here for my husbands
post-doc, but we'll wait and see then,"
Bamgarten said. "Our plan for now is
to move back but you never know
what will happen in the long run."
The search for schools, however,
was not a problem for the Johansson-
Baumgartens. Part of the appeal of
choosing an apartment off campus
was that they could pick how close to
their children's school they would be.
"Standing on our balcony in our
apartment complex, we look down on
the preschool," Baumgarten said.
'And the kindergarten is a really good
school. [Palo Alto] seems like a really
good schooling area."
Baumgarten is right. Not only can
Stanford claim good quality of their
early education facilities, but also
quantity and proximity.
"There are many day care cen

ters on campus, so for one thing, child
care is very accessible." Baldwin
Clarke said. "There is a range of
options pricewise, but they all require
different things."
"People come all the way from San
Francisco to put their children in the
Bing Preschool," Roman said. The
Roman family put their name on the
waiting list at the Bing Nursery and
Preschool before Andres was born,
but he was not cleared by the time
Mrs. Roman was scheduled to return
to work.
Beyond the aggressive pre-school
process, Stanford has some other
issues to address before it can call its
graduate family life ideal. Like the
Baldwin Clarke and Roman families,
most need to hire a babysitter or
nanny. Stanford offers no program for
finding nannies and the market is
aggressive in Palo Alto.
"The nannies have to park on El
Camino, too," Roman said, pointing
out that EV planning does not
account for the amount of extra help
required.
However, students have seen
some responsiveness to their
demands in the past few years.
As of this past year; graduates stu
dents can add their children as depen
dants on their health insurance,
according to the Office of the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education. The
CCSC also offers a pay option that
allows parents to trade some of their
time for a subsidized rate.
Despite problems securing
babysitters and slots in prestigious
daycares, residents of EV agree that
Stanford is responsive to the needs of
the graduate families.
"I've been to Yale, I've been to the
University of Chicago, I've been to
UC-Berkeley and I've never seen a
campus that is more geared toward
family life," Allen said. "No ques
tion."

their respective courtyards.
"The courtyard assistants have
their own fund, and about once a
month we have a courtyard party,"
Allen said. "They hired a bluegrass
music artist last month and next
month they're doing holiday photog
raphy for our neighborhood."
The CAs also respond to requests
and complaints from within court
yards. Roman claims that when his
washing machine broke, the CA
called in a mechanic and the school
paid for it. Eighty-seven percent of
respondents to the 2010-11 survey
reported that CA communication is
effective.
While EV housing provides cer
tain conveniences, for some families it
doesn't provide the necessary perma
nence of a family home.
Anna Baumgarten and her hus
band Magnus Johansson, a postdoc
toral research fellow in the School of
Medicine, chose apartments off cam
pus when they moved here from
Sweden with their three children this
past summer. They prefer to live in a
place they could call home even after
Johansson finishes his post-doctoral
work in structural biology.
"We're only here for my husbands
post-doc, but we'll wait and see then,"
Bamgarten said. "Our plan for now is
to move back but you never know
what will happen in the long run."
The search for schools, however,
was not a problem for the Johansson-
Baumgartens. Part of the appeal of
choosing an apartment off campus
was that they could pick how close to
their children's school they would be.
"Standing on our balcony in our
apartment complex, we look down on
the preschool," Baumgarten said.
'And the kindergarten is a really good
school. [Palo Alto] seems like a really
good schooling area."
Baumgarten is right. Not only can
Stanford claim good quality of their
early education facilities, but also
quantity and proximity.
"There are many day care cen

ters on campus, so for one thing, child
care is very accessible." Baldwin
Clarke said. "There is a range of
options pricewise, but they all require
different things."
"People come all the way from San
Francisco to put their children in the
Bing Preschool," Roman said. The
Roman family put their name on the
waiting list at the Bing Nursery and
Preschool before Andres was born,
but he was not cleared by the time
Mrs. Roman was scheduled to return
to work.
Beyond the aggressive pre-school
process, Stanford has some other
issues to address before it can call its
graduate family life ideal. Like the
Baldwin Clarke and Roman families,
most need to hire a babysitter or
nanny. Stanford offers no program for
finding nannies and the market is
aggressive in Palo Alto.
"The nannies have to park on El
Camino, too," Roman said, pointing
out that EV planning does not
account for the amount of extra help
required.
However, students have seen
some responsiveness to their
demands in the past few years.
As of this past year; graduates stu
dents can add their children as depen
dants on their health insurance,
according to the Office of the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education. The
CCSC also offers a pay option that
allows parents to trade some of their
time for a subsidized rate.
Despite problems securing
babysitters and slots in prestigious
daycares, residents of EV agree that
Stanford is responsive to the needs of
the graduate families.
"I've been to Yale, I've been to the
University of Chicago, I've been to
UC-Berkeley and I've never seen a
campus that is more geared toward
family life," Allen said. "No ques
tion."

LaToya Baldwin Clarke's alarm
goes off at 6:45 a.m. She barely has time
to wish her husband a good day before
he is out the door and off to work. By
7:45 a.m. she yells, "Let's go!" to her
two oldest children, Ahmir and Amina,
and soon all three mount their scooters
to head over to Escondido Elementary
School. After kisses goodbye, Baldwin
Clarke goes back home to greet the
babysitter for her six-month-old son,
Ahman. By 9 a.m. she is in a classroom
at the Stanford Law School, looking
forward to family dinner later in the
night.
Baldwin Clarke is a sixth-year grad
uate student and J.DyPh.D. candidate
in sociology and law. Her family lives in
a relatively large house in Escondido
Village (EV), surrounded by 254 other
graduate student families. EV is the
only on-campus housing for graduate
students with families.
While their home is on the larger
side, since her family falls into the 13
percent of EV families with three or
more children, the Clarkes' backyard is

the same as everyone else's: a grassy
park with a playground in the middle,
complete with a jungle gym, swings
and a sandbox. There are nine of these
courtyards that interconnect the EV
houses.

"I haven't seen anything in the sur
rounding areas that is comparable in
price or a better place to raise a child,"
said Diego Roman, a fifth-year gradu
ate student in the School of Education.

"In my courtyard, kids range from
zero to three, so they all play with each
other and it makes for a fantastic place
to have Mends... and to talk about your
kids," Roman said. "You're all having
the same experience."

Roman's son, Andres, is two and a
half, and knows how to show it on his
fingers. The Roman family's one-child
house in Escondido Village has a play
table decked out with a Thomas the
Tank Engine play set in their living
room.

"I want to show you something!"
shouts Andres, mimicking his "Papi,"
who is providing a tour of the house.

LaToya Baldwin Clarke reads with her children in their Escondido Village home. There are 255 graduate
student families living in EV's nine courtyards for student families, the only such on-campus
housing. One-third of graduate student families are international and 13 percent have three or
more children.
Roman responds to his child in
Spanish and Andres' mother repeats
to him in English, "Do you want to
show him Thomas?"
Roman explains that a multilin
gual household is not uncommon in
EY; the couple next door is from
Israel, and they speak to their child in
Hebrew. International students con
stitute one-third of graduate student
families at Stanford.
This diversity is an integral part of
the courtyard atmosphere. Andres,
for example, knows all of the neigh
boring children. The Roman family
regularly attends barbeques with
their neighbors.
Guinevere Allen, a second-year
Ph.D. student in the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages
and single mother, came to Stanford
from her graduate program at UC-
Berkeley. She does not regret her
move to Stanford because of the
unparalleled community in EY but
she has noticed a decline in financial
support.
'At UC-Berkeley, because it's a
large public school, they have more
democratic funds available," Allen
said.
Allen used to receive a grant
worth $B,OOO each year and a full
funding state subsidy for her son to
attend a private preschool.
"Those types of programs that I
feel are more geared towards minori
ty situations do not yet exist at
Stanford," Allen said.
Roman also acknowledged the
financial issue. He claimed that hav
ing a spouse who works is a huge
advantage in terms of receiving
health care benefits and another
source of income. Roman said that a
graduate student stipend is not
enough to raise a family especially
since rent at Escondido Village is paid
yearly with no monthly payment
plan.
"Grad students aren't used to pay
ing so much up front," he said. "Then,
if there's an emergency, what do we
have?"

Despite occasional flare-ups between
EV residents and the University, such
as an incident a few years ago when
EV was renovated and parents rallied
together to voice then- disapproval for
cutting down trees in the parks and
another in August regarding herbicide
spray graduate student families report
high levels of satisfaction with then*
housing.
Eighty-two percent of Baldwin
Clarke's neighbors agree that they
"feel people in this community care
about each other" according to the
2010-11 survey of graduate student
families living in EV by the Office of
the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education. One hundred sixty-two
survey responses noted a positive
response of community organization
in EV with 74 percent reporting they
feel connected to others in the EV
community.
The University employs nine
graduate students, called courtyard
assistants (CAs), to overlook the
upkeep of the parks and to organize
monthly and holiday events within

their respective courtyards.
"The courtyard assistants have
their own fund, and about once a
month we have a courtyard party,"
Allen said. "They hired a bluegrass
music artist last month and next
month they're doing holiday photog
raphy for our neighborhood."
The CAs also respond to requests
and complaints from within court

"In my courtyard, kids range from
zero to three, so they all play with each
other and it makes for a fantastic place
to have Mends... and to talk about your
kids," Roman said. "You're all having
the same experience."

Roman's son, Andres, is two and a
half, and knows how to show it on his
fingers. The Roman family's one-child
house in Escondido Village has a play
table decked out with a Thomas the
Tank Engine play set in their living
room.

"I want to show you something!"
shouts Andres, mimicking his "Papi,"
who is providing a tour of the house.

LaToya Baldwin Clarke reads with her children in their Escondido Village home. There are 255 graduate
student families living in EV's nine courtyards for student families, the only such on-campus
housing. One-third of graduate student families are international and 13 percent have three or
more children.
Roman responds to his child in
Spanish and Andres' mother repeats
to him in English, "Do you want to
show him Thomas?"
Roman explains that a multilin
gual household is not uncommon in
EY; the couple next door is from
Israel, and they speak to their child in
Hebrew. International students con
stitute one-third of graduate student
families at Stanford.
This diversity is an integral part of
the courtyard atmosphere. Andres,
for example, knows all of the neigh
boring children. The Roman family
regularly attends barbeques with
their neighbors.
Guinevere Allen, a second-year
Ph.D. student in the Division of
Literatures, Cultures and Languages
and single mother, came to Stanford
from her graduate program at UC-
Berkeley. She does not regret her
move to Stanford because of the
unparalleled community in EY but
she has noticed a decline in financial
support.
'At UC-Berkeley, because it's a
large public school, they have more
democratic funds available," Allen
said.
Allen used to receive a grant
worth $B,OOO each year and a full
funding state subsidy for her son to
attend a private preschool.
"Those types of programs that I
feel are more geared towards minori
ty situations do not yet exist at
Stanford," Allen said.
Roman also acknowledged the
financial issue. He claimed that hav
ing a spouse who works is a huge
advantage in terms of receiving
health care benefits and another
source of income. Roman said that a
graduate student stipend is not
enough to raise a family especially
since rent at Escondido Village is paid
yearly with no monthly payment
plan.
"Grad students aren't used to pay
ing so much up front," he said. "Then,
if there's an emergency, what do we
have?"

Despite occasional flare-ups between
EV residents and the University, such
as an incident a few years ago when
EV was renovated and parents rallied
together to voice then- disapproval for
cutting down trees in the parks and
another in August regarding herbicide
spray graduate student families report
high levels of satisfaction with then*
housing.
Eighty-two percent of Baldwin
Clarke's neighbors agree that they
"feel people in this community care
about each other" according to the
2010-11 survey of graduate student
families living in EV by the Office of
the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education. One hundred sixty-two
survey responses noted a positive
response of community organization
in EV with 74 percent reporting they
feel connected to others in the EV
community.
The University employs nine
graduate students, called courtyard
assistants (CAs), to overlook the
upkeep of the parks and to organize
monthly and holiday events within

their respective courtyards.
"The courtyard assistants have
their own fund, and about once a
month we have a courtyard party,"
Allen said. "They hired a bluegrass
music artist last month and next
month they're doing holiday photog
raphy for our neighborhood."
The CAs also respond to requests
and complaints from within court
yards. Roman claims that when his
washing machine broke, the CA
called in a mechanic and the school
paid for it. Eighty-seven percent of
respondents to the 2010-11 survey
reported that CA communication is
effective.
While EV housing provides cer
tain conveniences, for some families it
doesn't provide the necessary perma
nence of a family home.
Anna Baumgarten and her hus
band Magnus Johansson, a postdoc
toral research fellow in the School of
Medicine, chose apartments off cam
pus when they moved here from
Sweden with their three children this
past summer. They prefer to live in a
place they could call home even after
Johansson finishes his post-doctoral
work in structural biology.
"We're only here for my husbands
post-doc, but we'll wait and see then,"
Bamgarten said. "Our plan for now is
to move back but you never know
what will happen in the long run."
The search for schools, however,
was not a problem for the Johansson-
Baumgartens. Part of the appeal of
choosing an apartment off campus
was that they could pick how close to
their children's school they would be.
"Standing on our balcony in our
apartment complex, we look down on
the preschool," Baumgarten said.
'And the kindergarten is a really good
school. [Palo Alto] seems like a really
good schooling area."
Baumgarten is right. Not only can
Stanford claim good quality of their
early education facilities, but also
quantity and proximity.
"There are many day care cen

ters on campus, so for one thing, child
care is very accessible." Baldwin
Clarke said. "There is a range of
options pricewise, but they all require
different things."
"People come all the way from San
Francisco to put their children in the
Bing Preschool," Roman said. The
Roman family put their name on the
waiting list at the Bing Nursery and
Preschool before Andres was born,
but he was not cleared by the time
Mrs. Roman was scheduled to return
to work.
Beyond the aggressive pre-school
process, Stanford has some other
issues to address before it can call its
graduate family life ideal. Like the
Baldwin Clarke and Roman families,
most need to hire a babysitter or
nanny. Stanford offers no program for
finding nannies and the market is
aggressive in Palo Alto.
"The nannies have to park on El
Camino, too," Roman said, pointing
out that EV planning does not
account for the amount of extra help
required.
However, students have seen
some responsiveness to their
demands in the past few years.
As of this past year; graduates stu
dents can add their children as depen
dants on their health insurance,
according to the Office of the Vice
Provost for Graduate Education. The
CCSC also offers a pay option that
allows parents to trade some of their
time for a subsidized rate.
Despite problems securing
babysitters and slots in prestigious
daycares, residents of EV agree that
Stanford is responsive to the needs of
the graduate families.
"I've been to Yale, I've been to the
University of Chicago, I've been to
UC-Berkeley and I've never seen a
campus that is more geared toward
family life," Allen said. "No ques
tion."
