The Stanford Model United Nations Conference, held from Nov. 9 to Nov. 11, hosted 897 high school students from the United States,
Canada, Costa Rica and other Caribbean nations. They were organized into 35 committees, simulating real U.N. bodies. Approximately 90
student staff members acted as support staff and committee chairs. SMUNC is an annual project of the Society for International Affairs.
