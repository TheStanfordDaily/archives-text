# Facing the facts as Card battles Ducks
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
If you follow our football cover
age in the next several days,
you will notice that the
matchup on Saturday between
the Cardinal and Oregon is not
an easy subject to handle for
Stanford fans. But it's a question I am
stalling to have to face more and
more as I transition from my life as a
young, naive fan to someone who I
think has at least a little perspective
on the spoils world: What do you do
when your team has almost no
chance?
I guess I should also clarify that
this is also a question I have to consid
er most strongly as a journalist,
because as a fan, the easy answer, as
"Mo Problems Mo Beyda" so elo
quently put it, is to put the blinders
on and be stupidly loyal.
But as a journalist, the question is
both relevant and nuanced.
At the moment, my conflict cen
ters around the unfortunate truth
that the Oregon Ducks football team
is the greatest show on turf since
"The Greatest Show on Tiirf." Chip
Kelly has assembled a team of athlet
ic freaks who race up and down the
field at an unbelievable clip, and then
someone let him recruit a quarter
back who can actually throw the ball.
Bullocks.

Stanford, on the other hand, is at
times a confusing, exhilarating, mad
dening, scintillating and terrifying
team.
The team puts so much pressure
on the quarterback that it sometimes
backfires, leaving gaps to scramble
forward in the pocket or luring
defenders into over pursuing. Then at
other times, the quarterback never
escapes and you end up with a #par
tyinthebackfield and some moderate
ly entertaining sack dances. (I'm cur
rently particular to Shayne Skov's
new one that seems to be a cross
between doing the Cucaracha, punch
ing someone in the face and shooting
a bow and arrow.)
Earlier in the year I was having
trouble believing that Josh Nunes
could be victimized by dropped passes
so many times. Then I just felt kind of
sorry for him because after like three
drops he would throw a duck that just
made everything worse.
Every other game, Kulabafi
shows up and goes crazy, setting
records here and there and showing
off a side shuffle lean in the gap that
seriously has to be among the best in
the country. I know he isn't Toby, but
he can certainly put the team on his
back.
The list goes on, especially
because as a student myself, it is
impossible not to have class with
these guys or see them at parties or
become friends with them just
because I'm a college kid who loves
sports and they are college kids who
love sports too. You can certainly
choose who your Mends are, but I
refuse to exclude from that list the
people on campus I probably relate to
the most.
But then it comes times to face
facts.
Like the fact that Oregon is No. 2
in the BCS for a reason, that reason
being that the team has consistently
been one of the fastest offensive
teams in the country for the last sev
eral years and they have athletes on
both sides of the ball that can match
up with anyone. Like the fact that
they hung 59 points on Cal, 52 on
Washington and 70 on Colorado with
out trying. Oh and they beat Arizona
49-0. Oh, and they scored the most
points anyone has ever scored on
USC in a 62-51 road win. Like, ever.
There are other reasons the
Ducks are favored, though. Redshirt

What do you
do when
your team
has almost
no chance?

is in the first road start of his career
and Stanford has been pretty weak
on the road this year in general. The
game is at Autzen Stadium in
Eugene, Ore., and that crowd and
stadium go nuts for the Ducks. Did I
mention that it's ESPN's College
Game Day?
These are all things that terrify
me as a Stanford football fan. And
they terrify me as someone whose
job it is to cover the team as objec
tively as I can while still catering to
my readership.

Is it OK for me to be optimistic
about the team's chances in the face
of such odds? My answer is yes, if I
truly feel that way. This week, I don't.
I think Stanford is unfortunately
a victim of the college sports scene
that sees faces in and faces out every
few years with not much time or
proven method to evaluate talent in a
highly efficient manner. If Kevin
Hogan had progressed quicker in
practice last spring or over the sum
mer and earned the starting job, I'd
like our chances more, and I honestly
believe this team would be undefeat
ed and in Notre Dame's undeserved
spot in the BCS right now.
That might make me a homer, but
I think there is a difference between
someone who can look at things

objectively as a fan and come out and
say when something's not right, and
the person who throws things out the
window on either side to find whatev
er narrow angle fits their fandom.
So be warned, I will predict a
Stanford loss for the first time this
season on Friday because on paper
this game is not all that close. But
that won't wipe the smile off my face
on Saturday night if the Cardinal
plays to its potential and the Ducks
come out flat.

stadium go nuts for the Ducks. Did I
mention that it's ESPN's College
Game Day?
These are all things that terrify
me as a Stanford football fan. And
they terrify me as someone whose
job it is to cover the team as objec
tively as I can while still catering to
my readership.

Is it OK for me to be optimistic
about the team's chances in the face
of such odds? My answer is yes, if I
truly feel that way. This week, I don't.
I think Stanford is unfortunately
a victim of the college sports scene
that sees faces in and faces out every
few years with not much time or
proven method to evaluate talent in a
highly efficient manner. If Kevin
Hogan had progressed quicker in
practice last spring or over the sum
mer and earned the starting job, I'd
like our chances more, and I honestly
believe this team would be undefeat
ed and in Notre Dame's undeserved
spot in the BCS right now.
That might make me a homer, but
I think there is a difference between
someone who can look at things

objectively as a fan and come out and
say when something's not right, and
the person who throws things out the
window on either side to find whatev
er narrow angle fits their fandom.
So be warned, I will predict a
Stanford loss for the first time this
season on Friday because on paper
this game is not all that close. But
that won't wipe the smile off my face
on Saturday night if the Cardinal
plays to its potential and the Ducks
come out flat.

If you follow our football cover
age in the next several days,
you will notice that the
matchup on Saturday between
the Cardinal and Oregon is not
an easy subject to handle for
Stanford fans. But it's a question I am
stalling to have to face more and
more as I transition from my life as a
young, naive fan to someone who I
think has at least a little perspective
on the spoils world: What do you do
when your team has almost no
chance?
I guess I should also clarify that
this is also a question I have to consid
er most strongly as a journalist,
because as a fan, the easy answer, as
"Mo Problems Mo Beyda" so elo
quently put it, is to put the blinders
on and be stupidly loyal.
But as a journalist, the question is
both relevant and nuanced.
At the moment, my conflict cen
ters around the unfortunate truth
that the Oregon Ducks football team
is the greatest show on turf since
"The Greatest Show on Tiirf." Chip
Kelly has assembled a team of athlet
ic freaks who race up and down the
field at an unbelievable clip, and then
someone let him recruit a quarter
back who can actually throw the ball.
Bullocks.

Stanford, on the other hand, is at
times a confusing, exhilarating, mad
dening, scintillating and terrifying
team.
The team puts so much pressure
on the quarterback that it sometimes
backfires, leaving gaps to scramble
forward in the pocket or luring
defenders into over pursuing. Then at
other times, the quarterback never
escapes and you end up with a #par
tyinthebackfield and some moderate
ly entertaining sack dances. (I'm cur
rently particular to Shayne Skov's
new one that seems to be a cross
between doing the Cucaracha, punch
ing someone in the face and shooting
a bow and arrow.)
Earlier in the year I was having
trouble believing that Josh Nunes
could be victimized by dropped passes
so many times. Then I just felt kind of
sorry for him because after like three
drops he would throw a duck that just
made everything worse.
Every other game, Kulabafi
shows up and goes crazy, setting
records here and there and showing
off a side shuffle lean in the gap that
seriously has to be among the best in
the country. I know he isn't Toby, but
he can certainly put the team on his
back.
The list goes on, especially
because as a student myself, it is
impossible not to have class with
these guys or see them at parties or
become friends with them just
because I'm a college kid who loves
sports and they are college kids who
love sports too. You can certainly
choose who your Mends are, but I
refuse to exclude from that list the
people on campus I probably relate to
the most.
But then it comes times to face
facts.
Like the fact that Oregon is No. 2
in the BCS for a reason, that reason
being that the team has consistently
been one of the fastest offensive
teams in the country for the last sev
eral years and they have athletes on
both sides of the ball that can match
up with anyone. Like the fact that
they hung 59 points on Cal, 52 on
Washington and 70 on Colorado with
out trying. Oh and they beat Arizona
49-0. Oh, and they scored the most
points anyone has ever scored on
USC in a 62-51 road win. Like, ever.
There are other reasons the
Ducks are favored, though. Redshirt
