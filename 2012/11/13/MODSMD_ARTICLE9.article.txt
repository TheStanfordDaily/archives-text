## CARD SURVIVES SCARE 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While the backcourt duo of Chasson Randle
and Aaron Bright has received plenty of attention
this offseason as keys to the Mure of Cardinal
basketball, the rest of the Stanford team clearly

wants to make sure that we don't forget about
them. Thanks to a balanced effort, the Cardinal
pulled away from Cal State-FMerton in the sec
ond half Monday night's home opener to win 81-
68.

While Friday night's win over the Dons might
have been the Dwight Powell show, as the 6-foot

10 junior scored a career-high 27 points, Monday's
offensive attack at Maples Pavilion came from all
over. The Titans were coming off an impressive 86-
47 exhibition win against Cal State-Los Angeles,
and were looking for the opportunity to start their
regular season off with a matchup against a Pac-12
contender.

Neither team managed to grab a comfortable
lead in the first half, as the two squads looked to be
evenly matched. A Chasson Randle layup with
8:13 to go in the period gave Stanford its largest
lead, as it went up 23-15. The Titans would battle
back, as a jumper from D.J. Seeley and a 3-point
er by Kwame Vaughn pulled Fhllerton to within
three points, forcing Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins to call a timeout. It did little to stem the
tide, however, as the Titans quickly tied the game
at 23 apiece.
Neither team managed to force the upper
hand, going into the halftime break tied at 31. Titans
assistant head coach Julius Hicks, the acting head
coach while interim head coach Andy Newman
seives a two-game suspension, was pleased with the
way his team played but not fully satisfied.
"We had a lot of room for improvement in the
first half, but we were fortunate to come out of it
tied," Hicks said.
It looked as if the second half was going to be a
similar story, as the Cardinal couldn't seem to find
its offensive rhythm. With just under 14 minutes
remaining in the game, the two squads were all
knotted up at 48-48. However, at that point
Stanford finally decided to kick it into gear. The
Card picked up the defensive intensity and start
ed moving the ball around more on the offensive
end, helping it jump out to a 54-48 lead after a pair
of free throws from Aaron Bright. Soon after, Josh
Huestis decided to make his mark on the game,
