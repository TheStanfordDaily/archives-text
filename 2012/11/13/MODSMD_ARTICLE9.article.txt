## CARD SURVIVES SCARE 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While the backcourt duo of Chasson Randle
and Aaron Bright has received plenty of attention
this offseason as keys to the Mure of Cardinal
basketball, the rest of the Stanford team clearly

wants to make sure that we don't forget about
them. Thanks to a balanced effort, the Cardinal
pulled away from Cal State-FMerton in the sec
ond half Monday night's home opener to win 81-
68.

While Friday night's win over the Dons might
have been the Dwight Powell show, as the 6-foot

10 junior scored a career-high 27 points, Monday's
offensive attack at Maples Pavilion came from all
over. The Titans were coming off an impressive 86-
47 exhibition win against Cal State-Los Angeles,
and were looking for the opportunity to start their
regular season off with a matchup against a Pac-12
contender.

Neither team managed to grab a comfortable
lead in the first half, as the two squads looked to be
evenly matched. A Chasson Randle layup with
8:13 to go in the period gave Stanford its largest
lead, as it went up 23-15. The Titans would battle
back, as a jumper from D.J. Seeley and a 3-point
er by Kwame Vaughn pulled Fhllerton to within
three points, forcing Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins to call a timeout. It did little to stem the
tide, however, as the Titans quickly tied the game
at 23 apiece.
Neither team managed to force the upper
hand, going into the halftime break tied at 31. Titans
assistant head coach Julius Hicks, the acting head
coach while interim head coach Andy Newman
seives a two-game suspension, was pleased with the
way his team played but not fully satisfied.
"We had a lot of room for improvement in the
first half, but we were fortunate to come out of it
tied," Hicks said.
It looked as if the second half was going to be a
similar story, as the Cardinal couldn't seem to find
its offensive rhythm. With just under 14 minutes
remaining in the game, the two squads were all
knotted up at 48-48. However, at that point
Stanford finally decided to kick it into gear. The
Card picked up the defensive intensity and start
ed moving the ball around more on the offensive
end, helping it jump out to a 54-48 lead after a pair
of free throws from Aaron Bright. Soon after, Josh
Huestis decided to make his mark on the game,

throwing down a huge dunk
and drawing a foul. After
knocking down the free throw,
Stanford went up by nine.
Just a minute later, and
Huestis was at it again, dunk
ing once more to give Stanford
a 67-54 lead.
Dawkins noted that
Stanford continued to wear
down the Titans as the game
went on. "I thought it was a
combination of [our speed
and size]," he said. "I thought
our guys did a good job defen
sively in the first half. We
tried to make them take some
difficult shots. They made
some tough shots, they
have some very good guards
and it showed. I thought real
ly the spark came from Andy
[Brown] and Christian
[Sanders]. I thought those two
guys, when we inserted them
into the game, they gave us
energy, they both made plays,
and they kind of made our rim
when those two kids started to
really insert themselves into
the game."
The Card then closed the
door on the Titans, scoring 10
unanswered points and forcing
Ftillerton's coach Julius Hicks

to call a timeout.
"Teams are going to make
runs; it's a long game," Hicks
said. "We didn't expect to have
success the entire game.
They're a good team and well
coached, so they're going to go
on runs. It's part of the game.
Where we got in trouble was
when we just didn't play
together. We have a very thin
margin for error."
It was a margin that proved
insurmountable, as the
Cardinal went on to win 81-68.
While Stanford has plenty of
room for improvement, they
have to be pleased with a 2-0
record.
Bright said that the depth of
the team should prove to be one
of the Cardinal's greatest
strengths as the season goes on.
"I think we have guys who
should be able to play consis
tently throughout the year, you
know, and I think nights like
Dwight had the other night
could be normal. Him putting
up 20 points, Chasson putting
up 20-plus points, I think we
have guys who are able to play
like that consistently through
out the year."
Next week, the Card will
look to improve its record to 4-
0 with games against Alcorn
State and Belmont University.
