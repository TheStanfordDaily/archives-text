# Card faces Pacific on Senior Day
## 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Day is always a dichotomy of emo
tions. Winning carries extra emotional sig
nificance at a point in the season where a win
is already crucial from a purely objective
point of view.
A victory for N0.3 Stanford (14-5, 4-3
MPSF) over N0.7 Pacific this Friday night
would secure the fourth seed in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament. A loss would open up the door
for the Tigers to jump them in the standings,
which would mean an even worse draw for
the Cardinal in the conference playoffs.
Stanford's regular' season finale is mean
ingful far beyond playoff positioning. It
marks the end of half a decade of work for
four redshirt seniors and a transition to a
new generation of players.

"It's kind of a bittersweet moment. The
culmination of five hard years of work in one
night at Avery Aquatic Center," said red
shirt senior driver Travis Noll.

Noll, 2-meter Andrew LaForge, and 2-
meter Ryan Brown will join driver
Alex Avery in saying an affectionate good
bye to the pool brandished with Avery's fam

ily name.
"There's nothing like playing in that pool
so its going to be kind of sad never getting to
do that again," Noll said. "But it's going to
be fun to have one last showdown at the pool,
and I'm excited for the moment."

From a purely water polo perspective,
this is a rematch of two familiar teams.
Stanford defeated Pacific 9-5 in the SoCal
Tournament earlier this year, and they are
confident that their tactical preparation will
produce another positive result.
"We know what offense and defense they
plan on running, they haven't changed much
since we played them at the beginning of the
season," Noll said.
This is also matchup of the two top scor
ers in the MPSF. Pacific junior Balazs
Erdelyi leads this league with 3.74 goals per
game, but Bret Bonanni is right on his heels
with an average of 3.42 goals per game. In
the previous meeting, Erdelyi was held to a
single goal, while Bonanni mustered two.
The real star of the game though was
Stanford's second leading scorer, sophomore
utility Alex Bowen, who scored a game-high
four goals.

Senior driver Travis Noll (12) and the No. 3 Cardinal can finish the regular season in
style and secure the fourth seed in the MPSF tournament on Friday against No. 7 Pacific.
On the front of Bowen's mind
entering this matchup is how he
can send his seniors off on a high
note. He and his fellow underclass
men may be leaned on to do most of
the scoring, but they know how
much value this graduating class
brings to the team.
"They're all leaders, and its
great to see them off with a win,"
Bowen said, after taking a minute
to collect his thoughts and con
dense his feeling for the group of
redshirt seniors into something
succinctly meaningful.
Winning this game is not a fore
gone conclusion though. Pacific is
3-3 in the MPSF and has scored at

least 10 goals in each of their past
five games, which have all been
against quality conference oppo
nents. And while they are coming
off of a loss in their last game, it
was a 13-10 loss to a UCLA team
that just handed Stanford a 9-5
defeat last Friday.
The Cardinal is hoping they can
channel their emotions into quality
play and get a win that will send
the seniors out on a positive note,
and also get back some momentum
before the MPSF Tournament.
"Winning our last home game
means a lot to all the seniors, and it
should mean a lot to the whole
team," Noll said.
Opening tip is set for 5:00 p.m.
this Friday night at Avery Aquatic
Center against UCLA.
