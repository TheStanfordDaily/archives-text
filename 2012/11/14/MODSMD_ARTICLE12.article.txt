## OP-ED An open letter to the ASSU Executive 
### JAKE FRIEDLER Stanford Class of 2015 Jake can be reached at friedler@stanforeLd. edu 
To the ASSU Executive and the stu
dent body of Stanford University,
lam writing to express my res
olute agreement with the recent
Stanford Daily editorial concern
ing the "abject failure" of the ASSU
Senate. Like The Daily's Editorial
Board, I am in full support of the
Senate's dissolution and would love
to see action taken on this issue as
soon as possible.
The Senate is an overly bureau
cratic instrument of student govern
ment that has little relevance to the
lives of students beyond its powers
to allocate student group funding, a
relatively simple task that could best
be handled through other avenues. I
would support the replacement of
the ASSU Senate with a new legisla
tive body that succeeds in 1) repre
senting the voice of the students
both in policy decisions and in
appeals to the University adminis
tration, and 2) provides for the rein
vestment of student fees in creative
programming that responds to stu
dent needs and interests.
In its current state, the ASSU
Senate is an absolute mockery of
governance. Interest in candidacy
and voter participation are equally
dismal; the few candidates who are
not elected are simply those who fail
to win the support of SOCC and
other dominant interest groups that
mobilize their constituents essen
tially the only voters â€”to elect a
predetermined slate. Most students
are unaware of the roles fulfilled by
the Senate, and many are even
entirely unaware of its existence.
Minutes from the past few
"Student Life" committee meetings
reveal that there isn't even much to
be aware of at all. Recent discussions
include deciding that there is
absolutely nothing that can be done
to improve NSO ("UAR handles it"),
the suggestion of a puppy rental pro
gram (one of countless pie-in-the
sky ideas that are never investigated
further) and even a meeting where
absolutely nothing was discussed or
accomplished (of course, only four of
the eight members were actually in
attendance).

Because the ASSU Senate is
equally irrelevant from year to year,
students have little motivation to
vote, let alone make educated deci
sions. If the Senate were to be
replaced with a governing body that
was actually relevant to students,
perhaps we would see the impor
tance of voting (or, heaven forbid,
running) to populate the institution
with the most competent, proactive
members.

My public high school had just
2,000 students and (it probably goes
without saying) significantly less
money than Stanford University, yet
somehow we managed to have a stu
dent government that was not only
relevant to the daily lives of a major
ity of the student body, but also
proactive about exploring opportuni
ties to improve itself, expand its
offerings and meaningfully impact
the campus climate. The leadership
of this student government was even
known to act on behalf of the stu
dents in response to unpopular
administrative policies concerning
tardiness, dress code and the censor
ship of student performances. We
rarely won, but at least we tried.
Contrast this with the ASSU,
which continues to sit by idly as the
University waters down campus tra
ditions like Full Moon and Gaieties,
unjustly revokes the lease of Chi
Theta Chi, cracks down on a rela
tively safe campus party culture and
generally moves to condense and

flex its bureaucratic authority. In my
year and a half at Stanford, I have
seen the ASSU do absolutely noth
ing to amplify the voices of students
or improve their status at Stanford.
For some examples of what stu
dent governments are doing at
Stanford's peer institutions, just
read the list of 2011-2012
Accomplishments published by the
UCLA Undergraduate Students'
Association. I understand that
UCLA is a much larger university
than Stanford, but consider the
scope of their achievements: They
managed to pull off a farmers' mar
ket, lobby local companies for lower
rates on airport travel, set up a car
nival attended by 4,500 students and
25 student groups, engendered a
reduction in their school's carbon
footprint and amplified the student
voice on a number of important
issues. And that was all handled by
just the office of the president
one single member of a vast execu
tive branch.

It is time for a radical re-think of
student government at Stanford
one that cannot possibly result in a
system worse than the one we have
now. As a student body, we are set
tling for far too little. Imagine a rep
resentative body that not only man
aged to properly allocate student
group funding, but also proactively
explored new initiatives. Imagine a
body that lobbied the University
bureaucracy on our behalf to shape
services to our needs; I for one
would appreciate longer hours at
Green Library and the opening of a
24-hour cafe on campus. Imagine a
subsidized travel program for away
sporting events to increase the
embarrassing attendance levels at
our top-notch athletic programs.
Imagine a late-night food delivery
service, with proceeds going back to
help fund student groups In-N-
Out, anyone?

None of these ideas are far from
the realm of possibility, and a new,
streamlined approach to student
government would help turn them,
as well as many other projects, into
reality. I would be happy to put my
money where my mouth is and
serve in such a student government
to make things like this happen, but
so long as the ASSU Senate
remains broken, I have no doubt
that I would find myself just as inef
fectual as the current slate of sena
tors (who certainly have the best
interests of students in mind and
are not to blame for the limitations
of their position).

Mr. Zimbroff, Mr. Wagstaff, I
urge you, the Executive, to initiate
the process of making the changes
necessary for student representa
tion at Stanford to become legiti
mate and relevant. Dissolve the
ASSU Senate and begin the work
necessary to create a superior body
to stand in its place. I would be eager
to work with you and any other rele
vant authorities to decide what this
might look like, but as a first step, I
suggest a well-administered poll of
the undergraduate student body,
which would reveal much about its
perceptions and expectations of stu
dent government. Your term can be
no more effective than those of your
predecessors until significant
reforms are instituted. A world-class
institution such as Stanford
deserves world-class student gover
nance, and there's no time like the
present to make it happen.
