# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## When the yellow brick road ends 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
There is a moment when you
reach the top step and posi
tion your foot for the follow
ing stair, only to find that there are
no more steps to climb. The place
where you imagined the stair would
be feels hauntingly empty and, for a
moment, you become dislocated in
space. Disillusionment hits like a
dose of antigravity. It pins you down
and stares you jeeringly in the face,
characterized only by the things it is
not. It is an unwelcome weightless
ness, an abrupt absence, a slow
diminishing toward the mean. After
all, "it is not the blow we suffer from
but the tedious repercussive anticli
max of it" (William Faulkner,
Absalom, Absalom!).
For the overqualified lot at
Stanford, this feeling should sound
familiar. Perhaps working at NASA
was your dream, but after an
unbearably boring summer intern
ship you decided you didn't want to
go down that path anymore. Maybe
you dreamt of becoming a concert
pianist, and discovered that the
hours of practice and isolation did
n't amount to perfection after all.
You always hoped to impress your
parents, but now when they beam
and tell their friends about your
bright future, you feel nausea

instead of pride. It's not that you
failed, it's that you saw a dream for
what it was, a dream, and you
decided to let it go.

The rose-colored glasses come
off and you are at Stanford, not
Hogwarts. The sky is no longer the
limit. Maybe law school, or a start
up, but certainly not the ambiguous
and magical image you had of suc
cess when you came here. The clar
ity and finitude of failure would be
welcome next to the hazy and
indomitable weight of disappoint
ment. I'm not talking about the dis
appointment of stress, or hard
work, or bad grades. I'm talking
about the disappointment of no
longer believing in Santa Claus. Of
admitting to yourself that you
would rather be an accountant than
Cat Woman. I know it sounds child
ish, but these things hurt.
Failing to reach a goal is nothing
compared to the grief of admitting
that the goal you set out to accom
plish was a fantasy. We all have
high expectations for ourselves, but
we forget sometimes how high our
expectations for the world can be.
It brings to mind Captain Ahab in
monomaniacal pursuit of a whale
onto whom he projects the fantasy
of redemption. The reader knows

the white whale can't possibly
embody the redemption Ahab
needs; Ishmael knows it too. But
Ahab can't bring himself to admit
that the world will fall short of his
expectations.

When you reach the last stair of
your illusory staircase, you have a
choice to stay at the top step wail
ing for someone to build you more
stairs, like Ahab. Or you can admit
that what you were chasing was a
phantom, climb down the stairs,
and set off on a new voyage. The
only thing that will give you the
strength to lick your wounds and
start wandering again is the knowl
edge that just because a career in
alchemy didn't work out, that does
n't mean that your search for the
philosopher's stone was in vain.
To the dreamers, the disillu
sioned, the disappointed: keep
chasing your white whale, just
know when to stop. Don't let any
one tell you that you wasted your
time if you change your mind mid
voyage. Even if you come home
empty-handed, there is something
you gained, just the same. You are a
far better sailor than your critics.
