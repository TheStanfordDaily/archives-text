## HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
### Katharine Schwab | INTERMISSION 
I was bobbing my head to the beat
at an electropop concert a few
weeks ago, singing along, I'll be
home for next year, darling, I'll be
home for next year. I'd heard the
song dozens of times. I knew the
words by heart. And as I sang out with
thousands of other people I'll be
home for next year I almost
began to cry.
Growing up hits you at unexpect
ed times and in unexpected places, but
I definitely did not anticipate that such
a strong bout of homesickness would
hit me in a mosh pit. But last week,
even the barely edible piece of pump
kin pie (which, in all honesty, was the
only reason I was convinced to go to
hall meeting) sat like a rock in my
stomach when I realized that this year,
I wouldn't be treated to my family
friend's to-die-for pumpkin pie with
homemade whipped cream.
It's the holiday thing. For the
vast majority of my life, Thanksgiving
involved either the traditional turkey
with family or the more daring duck
confit with our best family friends.
And it was more than just tradition:
that's what the holiday meant. The
smell of roasting turkey, the overheat
ed kitchen, the personalized napkin

rings made from toilet paper rolls and
spray-painted black to look like pil
grims' hats: these were constant,
through the trials of elementary
school, the roller coaster of puberty
and the drama of high school.

Whether a sophomore or a sec
ond-grader, the feeling of anticipation
after school let out on the day before
Thanksgiving was the same. I was
growing up, but as long as Mom's
famous cranberry sauce recipe never

changed, I could handle it.
I'm not going to be home for
Thanksgiving this year. The break was
the only time to visit my friends on
the east coast, so instead of going
home to Southern California (where

it's sixty degrees and "freezing!" as we
tend to exclaim during the "frigid"
SoCal winters), I'm heading to
Providence and Boston, where cold
takes on an entirely new meaning. I'm
excited to (possibly) experience my
first white Thanksgiving, but my heart
still aches for the sunny Turkey Days
of years past. As I look forward to a
more adult celebration, I can't help
but reminisce about the good old days
at the kids' table, where I sat with my
brother and chatted awkwardly with
cousins we only saw once a year.
Plenty of students who don't go
home for Thanksgiving break. Some
go on Thanksgiving service trips or
stay with friends in the area; others
stay on campus because the trip home
is too lengthy or expensive. But as I
face my first Thanksgiving away from
home, I'm beginning to understand
that this is what growing up means. It
means that sometimes we have to
relinquish the comfort of custom in
order to create new traditions. It
means that not every holiday will be
spent in the warm embrace of famil
iarity. In order to create our own lives,
we sometimes have to give up the
things that define our childhood ... at
least until next year. 42J>
