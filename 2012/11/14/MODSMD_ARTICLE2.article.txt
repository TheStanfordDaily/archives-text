# IR major undergoes restructuring
## Program requirements modified for new area specializations, less econ. 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
The Program in International Relations
(IR) revised its major requirements to allow
for area specialization this academic year.
The changes, instituted partly to match stu
dents' skills to job placement, have received
positive student feedback.
Notable changes in the major include a
decrease in the required upper division eco
nomics classes and a new course on compara
tive governance.
Michael Tomz, director of the Program in
IR, said student demand for ways to special
ize in one or more regions of the world
prompted the change in curriculum.
"We had been monitoring student job
placement and a lot of them were getting jobs
in part because of their regional specializa

tions," Tomz said. "They wanted to be able to
signal to employers that they had done signif
icant coursework on a particular region of the
world and had that expertise."
Under the new requirements, majors now
declare one major concentration and one
minor concentration. They must take 35 units
of core classes and 35 units in their specializa
tion.
Social development/human well being is
currently the most popular specialization, fol
lowed by comparative international gover
nance, according to Sara Bascetta-Bohn, stu
dent services officer in the IR program.
The previous requirements allowed stu
dents to pick one of the three major tracks.
These tracks were comparative political and
historical analysis, comparative culture and
society, and comparative international politi

cal economy. Additionally, students had to
complete five courses distributed across
these tracks for an area specialization.
"I actually like the new requirements
because they give me more of a variety, unlike
before," IR major Jackie Li 'l5 said.
The IR program also plants to take advan
tage of the University's recent investment in
new study abroad locations. A quarter-long
program in Istanbul is expected to begin in
fall 2013.

"I think that allowing people to specialize
in particular geographic regions of the world
is very compatible for another requirement of
the program, which is study abroad," Tomz
said. "This was our way to be able to accom
modate those new opportunities for stu
dents."
Majors are also only required to take one

upper division economics class instead of the
two previously required, which allows stu
dents to bypass concerns with economics pre
requisites.
"We did that because there are very strict
prerequisites for most classes in the econom
ics department," Tomz said. "Our majors
were finding it difficult to do that, especially
if their interests were not in the economics
side of IR."

IR major Magali Duque 'l5 said that she
appreciates the new "well-rounded amount of
requirements" and the more flexible
approach to economics within IR.
"You have to take a little bit of econ, you
have to take some social sciences, you have to
take classes in a broad spectrum of areas, and
that is what IR is all about,"
Duque said.
Students can also now
fulfill their comparative gov
ernance core course require
ment by taking PoliSci 4:
Introduction to Comparative

Politics, or History 102: The
History of the International
System Since 1914.
"This gives students a
chance to look at the way
American politics intersects
with international affairs,"
Bascetta-Bohn said.

Over the last five years,
the number of declared
majors for IR has remained
steady with an average of
102 graduates per year.

Nevertheless, Bascetta-
Bohn is optimistic that the
new requirements will pro
duce an increase in IR
majors.
"When students hear
about picking a primary and
secondary specialization,
they get very excited about
it," Bascetta-Bohn said.
