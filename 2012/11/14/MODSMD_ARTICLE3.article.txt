## Meyer demolition plans move forward 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
The majority of the East Asia
Library, currently housed on the
fourth floor Meyer Library, will be
moved to the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) South Building in
spring and summer 2014 to prepare
for the demolition of Meyer in 2015,
according to Library Communications
Director Andrew Herkovic. The new
home of the Meyer material and 24-
hour study room will also have a food
service area.
The University decided to forgo
the $45 million retrofitting of
Meyer to meet safety standards,
opting instead to renovate the GSB
South Building, which has been
unoccupied since the GSB moved
to the Knight Management Center

in spring 2011. The renovation is
expected to cost $57 million.
The other books in Meyer, gen
eral collections materials, as well
as the rest of the East Asia collec
tion, will be redistributed between
Green Library, one of Stanford's on
campus auxiliary libraries and a stor
age facility off campus, according to
Assistant University Librarian and
Stanford University Libraries
Chief of Staff Mimi Calter.
The transfer of books will "be
managed in a manner that mini
mizes inconvenience," according to
Herkovic, who noted that students
will be able to page the books that
they need and have them brought
to a central location for pickup.

While the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries suggested

that a completely new building be
constructed to house the East Asia
Library, the University decided to
renovate the GSB South Building
instead because a renovation
would be less expensive, according
to Jack Cleary, associate vice pres
ident of Land, Buildings and Real
Estate.

Although Herkovic said the
renovation details "are still in
flux," he predicts that the renovat
ed GSB building will resemble the
former Jackson Business Library but
have more stack areas. According to
Calter, there will be "slightly less"
shelving space than in Meyer.

"I and most senior staff under
stand it to be a brilliant solution to a
vexing and intractable space prob
lem," Herkovic said in a statement.

One of the most popular aspects
of Meyer, the 24-hour study room,
will also be transferred to the East
Asia collection's new home in GSB
South. Unlike Meyer, the new
library will also have food service,
located in the basement where the
Arbuekle Cafe used to be.
"The food service piece has only
recently been approved by the
Provost, so it has not been widely
advertised," Calter said in a state
ment.
Calter added that though the
plans have received approval from
the Board of Trustees at several
stages, they will be presented
again in the spring.
