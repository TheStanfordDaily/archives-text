## Coursera explores offering credit for online courses 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Students taking online courses from universi
ties on Coursera and seven to nine other massive
open online course (MOOC) platforms may soon
qualify for academic credit from those universi
ties, for a small fee.
The American Council on Education (ACE), a
higher education umbrella group, in conjunction
with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,

announced its intention to work with Coursera to
determine the possibility of creating classes for
credit on Tbesday.

Coursera courses would make use of webcam
proctoring for exams to allow for credit, according
to Andrew Ng, associate professor of computer
science and Coursera co-creator.

'A webcam-based approach will make it easier
for students anywhere to take tests for credit, with
out having to travel potentially unreasonable dis
tances to an exam site," Ng said to Forbes.
The Gates Foundation has already awarded
the council $895,000 in grants to coordinate the
discussions. To further prepare, ACE and MOOC
representatives are collaborating on a

"Presidential Innovation Lab" group to oversee
the project, according to an Inside Higher Ed
article.

"They will kick the tires. They will issue
reports. They will see how this fits," Molly Broad,
president of ACE, said to Inside Higher Ed.
Ng stated in the same article that a normal
statement of accomplishment would cost $3O to
$lOO, while a proctored version would run
between $l5O and $250.
Revenue from student payments for these cer
tifications would be divided between Coursera,
the universities whose professors created the
courses and ACE.
ACE is also currently working on a similar project with
EdX, an online course platform jointly founded by Harvard
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
