## Senators argue for relevance Plans to work on use of buffer fund, transparency 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
At its Nov. 13 meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed plans for improving the
Senate's transparency through a
new website that will provide
updates on Senate activities and a
summary of the body's duties.
The website was developed by
Student Life Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5, who predicted
that it would be fully functional by
the beginning of winter quarter.
Bindra said his two main goals in
updating the website were to make
it easier to navigate and to central
ize Senate documents and informa
tion. The website is scheduled to
have meeting minutes, information
about the Senate, current issues,
funding processes and summaries
of the ASSU Constitution and
bylaws.
"The main aim is to fully commit
and see through our promise of
increased transparency by allowing
the student body to see what any
committee on Senate is working on
at any given moment," Bindra said.
Part of the discussion surround
ing increased transparency was
sparked by The Daily's recent edi
torial encouraging the dissolution
of the Senate. While most senators
agreed with some of the frustra
tions expressed in the article, they
also defended their work.
"I disagree with the statement
that the Senate does not serve a
purpose and that it should be dis
solved," Bindra said. "There are a
lot of things that we are doing that
have a lot of impact."
Bindra referenced efforts by
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 to
establish a need-blind financial aid
policy for international students
and his own work trying to get
more practice space for student
musicians as examples.
Though Bindra admitted that he
was "bitter" when he first read the
article, he encouraged senators to
look at the article's suggestions
objectively and not read it as a per
sonal attack.
"The article was looking at the
Senate as an institution and not the
people," Bindra said. "There were
some very relevant things in
there."
However, Senator Anna
Brezhneva 'l5 took issue with the
editorial's statement that the
Senate is not representative of the
student body.
"For how much 14 people can
represent Stanford, we do a good
job," Brezhneva said. "There is a
lot of diversity going on in this
room."

Appropriations Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 disagreed with the
Editorial Board's characterization
of funding bills as "meaning
less."
"These bills are what
fund almost everything that
happens on campus," Pham
said. "It may seem boring
and dry to look at applica
tions over and over but it's
something that's necessary
and it's an important part of
what we do."
Senator Janhavi Vartak
'l5, a member of the
Appropriations Committee,
said that while funding bills
may seem "really dry" by
the time they get to the gen
eral Senate meetings, the
Appropriations Committee
puts in a lot of effort getting
them to that point.
"In appropriations we are
looking at every dollar, every
bill, every line. We are really
thorough," Vartak said,
adding that appropriations
meetings can "get intense."

Vartak suggested that
the Senate's new website
should include a list of the
student groups that were
granted funding at each
week's meeting so that stu
dents can see how the
Senate is allocating money.

Pham said that the
Appropriations Committee
met with ASSU Assistant
Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 to discuss pos
sible uses for the Senate's
buffer and reserve funds.

In particular, the commit
tee is interested in creating a
grant for general fees
groups that would like to
request more than $6,000,
which is the current maxi
mum. According to Pham,
many groups that sponsor
events that cost between
$6,000 and $lO,OOO don't
apply for special fees
because of the effort
involved in campaigning.
The new grant would allow
these groups to obtain this
funding from the reserve or
buffer funds, which current
ly hold about $1.2 million.

"The money just accumu
lates in there. We want to
use it in away that benefits
students, instead of letting it
just lay there," Pham said.
"We thought this grant was
a really good idea because it
would hold anyone who is
requesting this large amount
of money accountable for an
event that is supposed to
promote undergraduate stu
dent life."

The Senate also passed
funding bills allocating
$15,548 to student organiza
tions from general fees and

$30,637 in budget modifica
tions for special fees groups,
including two budget modi
fications for the Asian American
Student Association that totaled
$28,937.

something that's necessary
and it's an important part of
what we do."
Senator Janhavi Vartak
'l5, a member of the
Appropriations Committee,
said that while funding bills
may seem "really dry" by
the time they get to the gen
eral Senate meetings, the
Appropriations Committee
puts in a lot of effort getting
them to that point.
"In appropriations we are
looking at every dollar, every
bill, every line. We are really
thorough," Vartak said,
adding that appropriations
meetings can "get intense."

Vartak suggested that
the Senate's new website
should include a list of the
student groups that were
granted funding at each
week's meeting so that stu
dents can see how the
Senate is allocating money.

Pham said that the
Appropriations Committee
met with ASSU Assistant
Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 to discuss pos
sible uses for the Senate's
buffer and reserve funds.

In particular, the commit
tee is interested in creating a
grant for general fees
groups that would like to
request more than $6,000,
which is the current maxi
mum. According to Pham,
many groups that sponsor
events that cost between
$6,000 and $lO,OOO don't
apply for special fees
because of the effort
involved in campaigning.
The new grant would allow
these groups to obtain this
funding from the reserve or
buffer funds, which current
ly hold about $1.2 million.

"The money just accumu
lates in there. We want to
use it in away that benefits
students, instead of letting it
just lay there," Pham said.
"We thought this grant was
a really good idea because it
would hold anyone who is
requesting this large amount
of money accountable for an
event that is supposed to
promote undergraduate stu
dent life."

The Senate also passed
funding bills allocating
$15,548 to student organiza
tions from general fees and

$30,637 in budget modifica
tions for special fees groups,
including two budget modi
fications for the Asian American
Student Association that totaled
$28,937.

At its Nov. 13 meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed plans for improving the
Senate's transparency through a
new website that will provide
updates on Senate activities and a
summary of the body's duties.
The website was developed by
Student Life Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5, who predicted
that it would be fully functional by
the beginning of winter quarter.
Bindra said his two main goals in
updating the website were to make
it easier to navigate and to central
ize Senate documents and informa
tion. The website is scheduled to
have meeting minutes, information
about the Senate, current issues,
funding processes and summaries
of the ASSU Constitution and
bylaws.
"The main aim is to fully commit
and see through our promise of
increased transparency by allowing
the student body to see what any
committee on Senate is working on
at any given moment," Bindra said.
Part of the discussion surround
ing increased transparency was
sparked by The Daily's recent edi
torial encouraging the dissolution
of the Senate. While most senators
agreed with some of the frustra
tions expressed in the article, they
also defended their work.
"I disagree with the statement
that the Senate does not serve a
purpose and that it should be dis
solved," Bindra said. "There are a
lot of things that we are doing that
have a lot of impact."
Bindra referenced efforts by
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 to
establish a need-blind financial aid
policy for international students
and his own work trying to get
more practice space for student
musicians as examples.
Though Bindra admitted that he
was "bitter" when he first read the
article, he encouraged senators to
look at the article's suggestions
objectively and not read it as a per
sonal attack.
"The article was looking at the
Senate as an institution and not the
people," Bindra said. "There were
some very relevant things in
there."
However, Senator Anna
Brezhneva 'l5 took issue with the
editorial's statement that the
Senate is not representative of the
student body.
"For how much 14 people can
represent Stanford, we do a good
job," Brezhneva said. "There is a
lot of diversity going on in this
room."

Appropriations Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 disagreed with the
Editorial Board's characterization
of funding bills as "meaning
less."
"These bills are what
fund almost everything that
happens on campus," Pham
said. "It may seem boring
and dry to look at applica
tions over and over but it's
something that's necessary
and it's an important part of
what we do."
