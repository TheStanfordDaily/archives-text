## Senators argue for relevance Plans to work on use of buffer fund, transparency 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
At its Nov. 13 meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed plans for improving the
Senate's transparency through a
new website that will provide
updates on Senate activities and a
summary of the body's duties.
The website was developed by
Student Life Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5, who predicted
that it would be fully functional by
the beginning of winter quarter.
Bindra said his two main goals in
updating the website were to make
it easier to navigate and to central
ize Senate documents and informa
tion. The website is scheduled to
have meeting minutes, information
about the Senate, current issues,
funding processes and summaries
of the ASSU Constitution and
bylaws.
"The main aim is to fully commit
and see through our promise of
increased transparency by allowing
the student body to see what any
committee on Senate is working on
at any given moment," Bindra said.
Part of the discussion surround
ing increased transparency was
sparked by The Daily's recent edi
torial encouraging the dissolution
of the Senate. While most senators
agreed with some of the frustra
tions expressed in the article, they
also defended their work.
"I disagree with the statement
that the Senate does not serve a
purpose and that it should be dis
solved," Bindra said. "There are a
lot of things that we are doing that
have a lot of impact."
Bindra referenced efforts by
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5 to
establish a need-blind financial aid
policy for international students
and his own work trying to get
more practice space for student
musicians as examples.
Though Bindra admitted that he
was "bitter" when he first read the
article, he encouraged senators to
look at the article's suggestions
objectively and not read it as a per
sonal attack.
"The article was looking at the
Senate as an institution and not the
people," Bindra said. "There were
some very relevant things in
there."
However, Senator Anna
Brezhneva 'l5 took issue with the
editorial's statement that the
Senate is not representative of the
student body.
"For how much 14 people can
represent Stanford, we do a good
job," Brezhneva said. "There is a
lot of diversity going on in this
room."

Appropriations Chair Nancy
Pham 'l4 disagreed with the
Editorial Board's characterization
