## Shaw makes his own mark on the Farm 
### George Chen 
When David Sbawwas
promoted to head
coach of Stanford
football almost two
years ago, there
wasn't much to say about him.
Sure, some people knew that he
was the offensive coordinator who
guided an Andrew Luck-led offense
to scoring at least 40 points in six of 13
games in 2010. Sure, a few people
might have known that he served as
an assistant coach in the NFL for
almost 10 years. But Jim Harbaugh
had such a dominating presence dur
ing his tenure as head coach that once
he departed for the San Francisco
49ers, it felt like Stanford was left
with a gaping hole.
It also left a big question: Who is
this Shaw guy and how good of a
coach is he really?
One of the biggest knocks against
Shaw last year was that he had simply
inherited a team that his predecessor
had so masterfully built over the span
of four seasons.

In truth, I do think it's hard to
argue against the idea that last year's
Cardinal crew was mostly
Harbaugh's legacy. It was Harbaugh
who, being classic Harbaugh, went
out of his way to say that Luck was
the best QB prospect since Eli
Manning before the future star even
emerged on the national scene. It was
Harbaugh who expertly mentored
eventual NFL first-round and sec
ond-round picks. And let's not forget,
it was Harbaugh who transformed
Stanford from the laughingstock of
the Pac-10 into a national powerhouse.

Shaw was handed a team brim
ming with talent, a team that at best
would win a national championship
and at worst go to a BCS bowl. The
first-year coach was put in a tough sit
uation. If he rigidly followed his pred
ecessor by copying what Harbaugh
did, he would be criticized for not
showing his own coaching style. If he
went away from what Harbaugh had
successfully built and things went
awry, the blame would pile up even
more. What was he supposed to do?
One of the biggest criticisms that
Shaw faced last season came after the
Fiesta Bowl, where he decided to put
the ball at the foot of Jordan
Williamson instead of in the hands of
Andrew Luck in the waning moments
of the game. Whether that was a mis
take or not is an entirely different
debate, but the most important thing
is that he has managed to quickly and
fully learn from his maturing experi
ences as head coach.
And it's paid off.

The work that Shaw has done so
far this season has been incredibly
underrated. Just three weeks into the
season, he created a masterful game
plan that propelled the Cardinal past
then-No. 2 USC. He has found away
to strengthen the Stanford secondary
that was vulnerable even under
Harbaugh's regime. He has managed
to effectively utilize the team's depth
at linebacker, offensive line and defen
sive line and at the same time ease the
best recruiting class in school history
into the college level.
There's also something to be said
about Shaw's unique coaching per
sonality. He is on the cool, collected
end of the spectrum just as much as
Harbaugh is on the fiery, brash oppo
site end, but he doesn't have the
brooding, evil-hooded persona of Bill
Belichick either. Plus Shaw has his
own quiet humor. Yesterday, when
asked if he would rather see Oregon's
speedster De' Anthony Thomas on
offense or defense, he replied, "I'd
rather see him on the bench."
Shaw has coached his team to
three signature wins against USC,
Arizona and Oregon State this
year alone. There were moments in all
three games when it seemed unlikely
that Stanford would be able to pull out
the victory, but Shaw rallied his team
on all three occasions. Players can't
rally that many times if they don't
have a great coach.
Above all else, the most telling
sign of Shaw's success as head coach
is where his team is at right now. The
Cardinal may have two losses and a
couple ugly wins, but it's in position to
claim the Pac-12 North title as well as
the conference championship that
eluded even Harbaugh. Even after
losing the best quarterback, best tight
end and two of the best offensive line
men in the country, Shaw has found a
way to coach the Cardinal back to
where it was last year.
The apprentice has become the
master. In the next two weeks, Shaw
has the chance to accomplish some
thing that Harbaugh never could.

George Chen has always believed in
Shaw. Congratulate him for staying
strong in the face of those two losses
and ugly wins at gchenls@stan
