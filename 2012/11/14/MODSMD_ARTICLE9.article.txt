# CUIPPING THEIR WINGS
## CARD MUST NOT LET DUCKS FLY 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The mood was surprisingly relaxed at
Stanford head coach David Shaw's weekly
press conference yesterday. Perhaps it was just
the calm before the storm that is the Oregon
Ducks' offensive attack in Autzen Stadium.
That's right, the toughest test of the year is just
days away, as Stanford prepares to attempt to
knock off the undefeated Ducks.

It certainly seemed like more than that. In
many ways, Shaw sounded like he had a team
with nothing to lose on Saturday. When casual
ly asked how he was doing as he sat down, he
replied, "After the last 48 hours of watching
Oregon film, how would you feel?"

One of the scariest characteristics of the
Oregon attack is the tendency to go on big scor
ing runs. The runs don't take 30 minutes, as
when Oregon State scored 23 unanswered
points against Stanford on Saturday, but take
closer to three. Shaw knows this, and will have
to weigh risks all game to try to prevent the
Ducks from going on one of those death runs.
"You have to be aggressive enough, but not
enough to leave yourself vulnerable ... the
moment that the offense gets out of character
because it thinks it needs to do something spe
cial, the lead goes from 14 to 28 fast."
It's a tough balance for Shaw to deal with.
On the one hand, if he takes a gamble by going
for it on fourth down instead of punting, he
takes the risk of giving an already deadly
Oregon offense good field position. However, if
Shaw punts, he takes the risk that Oregon will
go down the field anyway and pull ahead. No
one will know where Shaw leans until the first
key fourth down near midfield on Saturday.
The entire 30-minute Shaw press conference

was filled with praise for the Ducks, with many
of his comments being borderline playful. The
biggest laughs came from Shaw's praise of
Oregon redshirt freshman quarterback Marcus
Mariota, who looked to have a serious injury
against Cal before returning to the field later in
the game. "I was hoping he'd take about 10 days
to nurse that injury," Shaw quipped.
Though Mariota looks to be fine, Oregon is
dealing with serious injury issues, especially on
the defensive side of the ball. All four of
Oregon's starting defensive linemen either
missed the Cal game with an injury or were
injured in the game. Additionally, starting jun
ior safety Avery Patterson, who was filling in for
senior John Boyett (out for the season), tore his
ACL and will miss the rest of the season.
Oregon is so thin in the secondary that many
Oregon insiders believe sophomore running
back De' Anthony Thomas and sophomore quar
terback Bryan Bennett could play in the defen-

sive backfield against Stanford.
For the Cardinal, injuries don't
look to be a factor whatsoever.
Freshman offensive tackle Andrus
Peat and sophomore wide receiver
Ty Montgomery, the only two
notable players to suffer injuries
recently, both are healthy, accord
ing to Shaw. Peat and Montgomery
played against Oregon State, but
neither started. That will be the
same story on Saturday, as junior
David Yankey will start at left tack
le, as he has every game this sea
son, and senior Jamal-Rashad
Patterson will get another start at
wide receiver.

Patterson has come on strong at
the very end of his Stanford career.
Shaw is very happy with his block
ing and route running, which is a
big reason why he's continued to
start, even with his modest statis
tics and Montgomery returning
from the leg injury.
This game means a lot to
Patterson and his fellow seniors.

Captain Sam Schwartzstein, who
has played in a lot of big games in
his career, still gets excited for
games like this.
"It's one of the reasons you
came to play big-time college foot
ball at one of these big-time schools
... it's one of the things you dream
about growing up."
Redshirt senior Chase Thomas,
who, along with Schwartzstein, is a
member of the exclusive fifth-year
senior club, also understands
Oregon's role in the team's season.
Stanford's goal this year is to win
the Pac-12 championship. To do so,
it has to take out Oregon, win at
UCLA and then win a Pac-12
championship game against either
USC or UCLA at Stanford
Stadium.
As difficult as those tasks are
after Oregon, the Ducks present a
challenge far tougher. As Thomas
put it, "This pretty much is our
Pac-12 championship game," and
he's right, because if Stanford can't
get it done in Eugene, Oregon will
clinch the Pac-12 North Division
title.
