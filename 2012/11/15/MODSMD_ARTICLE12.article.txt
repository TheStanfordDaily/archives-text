## RAMBLINGS Pursuit of happiness 
### Alex Bayer 
I'd like to talk a little about hap
piness. We're all trying to find
it, right? I am at least. It's a
trope so widely circulated that I
hesitate to use it, but what the heck.
You know: money won't buy you
happiness. I think we all have an
inkling of what makes us happy, like
being with people you like and eat
ing a bowl of ice cream. The down
side of happiness is that it's always
fleeting. It says hello, makes you
feel all warm and fuzzy, then takes
its leave without saying goodbye.
This should be somewhat com
forting. If happiness is fleeting, so is
sadness, right? All emotions are but
temporary. But when you're sad, it
feels like you'll be sad forever.
When you're happy, you can already
feel it slipping away.
What kills me is that happiness
is really just a state of mind. I can
be happy literally any moment. I
can will myself to be overjoyed
about how comfortable this blanket
feels, and there's no reason that
that my joy can't be equal (or
greater) than the joy of a man who
just bought a yacht. But of course, I
don't. I pin my happiness on things
out of my reach, like that cool T
shirt I really want. If only I had that
T-shirt, my brain whispers to me.
Think of how cool you would look!
Think of all the friends you would
have! Shut up, brain.
It's very likely the man that just
bought his yacht or Porsche or
(insert fancy schmancy object here)
is not too happy anymore. Maybe
his bliss lasted for a day or so. I
don't know what you'd call this state
of bliss (über-rich people: what is
the word I am looking for?). In any
case, after a period of hours, the
yacht has failed to provide the ful
fillment said man had hoped it
would. We buy things to fill emo
tional vacuums. No one ever buys a
shirt because it's a pretty shirt.
Well, maybe they do. But when I
buy a shirt I buy it because I have
visions of me in this rad shirt feeling
like a million bucks and making a
boatload of friends. Chances are,
the man probably imagined that a
yacht would bring with it cadres
(binders?) of women, and maybe of
those, he would find a wife he really
loved and settle down with, and
finally he'd fulfill that secret dream
of his, living in a treehouse in the
middle of the woods.
This equation never works. I buy
a shirt. I wear the shirt. Nothing
happens. It's just a shirt, I realize.
Just a shirt. This is why I imagine
perfumes are the most anticlimactic
purchase you can make. Perfume
ads must be in a devilish bargain
with our inner critic, because
they've mastered the trick of mak
ing us believe that with this per
fume, we will transform into the
belle of the ball and be pursued by
an unshaven European man wear

ing a tuxedo. You cave and buy the
perfume. Nothing happens. You
look at it again and see it now. It's
just a bottle of liquid! 'You paid $5O
for this?' my brain shouts at me in
disbelief, the same brain that fell for
the promise of the European man.
Oh, brain.
Happiness is relative, yadda
yadda. You are surely smart cookies
and have a grasp on the basic tenets
of new-agey wisdom. We're children
of the '9os, after all. Where I start to
worry, though, is when I get to think
ing about my future. See, I've always
been enamored with this idea of The
Big Dream. I've loved the movies all
my life and I've never really deviated
from my ambition to be a writer
director. To consider doing some
thing else is too painful, too earth
shatteringly destabilizing, that I
can't even bear to fathom it. But this
question of happiness keeps nipping
at my ankles, prodding me to
answer: Is this really going to make
you happy? As far as I can tell, it is.
I love cinema, I truly do. Sometimes,
though, I imagine myself living at an
orangutan sanctuary somewhere in
Southeast Asia and being truly con
tent. You know, meditating and surf
ing and just being all-around happy
with life. What would be the differ
ence between happiness attained
that way versus happiness earned
tooth and nail, by achieving my
dream of success and fame? Can you
quantify happiness? Or a better
question, what makes one kind of
happiness more precious than the
other? In the end, isn't it the same?
Couldn't I be just as happy right
now, at 9 on a Wednesday night, chill
ing in my room? Who says I even
need to fly to Thailand?
"No! What are you saying, you
crazy hippie!" my brain fires back.
My brain gets scared by the work
involved in assuming a "happy"
state of mind. It's too impatient and
impulsive. It gets to poking me
about Thailand, and being in shape,
and yes, that shirt. Truly my brain
is the most effective slimy salesman
out there. If only you did this and
had these things, it coos, why then,
you'd be happy. Again, it seduces
me. I cave. I buy the damn shirt. A
few endorphins rush in, quickly
depart, and then it's back to square
one: back on the prowl for the next
quick fix. A few endorphins.
Disappointment. All of it hollow,
fruitless. I know this and yet I'm
still a slave to the material promise
of happiness. Out of laziness?
Impatience? Whatever it is, the
cycle is self-perpetuating. When it
comes down to it, who can resist the
perfumer's siren song, the glass vial
of concentrated happiness? So
effortless. Forget fifty bucks.
People would pay a million for that.

shirt I really want. If only I had that
T-shirt, my brain whispers to me.
Think of how cool you would look!
Think of all the friends you would
have! Shut up, brain.
It's very likely the man that just
bought his yacht or Porsche or
(insert fancy schmancy object here)
is not too happy anymore. Maybe
his bliss lasted for a day or so. I
don't know what you'd call this state
of bliss (über-rich people: what is
the word I am looking for?). In any
case, after a period of hours, the
yacht has failed to provide the ful
fillment said man had hoped it
would. We buy things to fill emo
tional vacuums. No one ever buys a
shirt because it's a pretty shirt.
Well, maybe they do. But when I
buy a shirt I buy it because I have
visions of me in this rad shirt feeling
like a million bucks and making a
boatload of friends. Chances are,
the man probably imagined that a
yacht would bring with it cadres
(binders?) of women, and maybe of
those, he would find a wife he really
loved and settle down with, and
finally he'd fulfill that secret dream
of his, living in a treehouse in the
middle of the woods.
This equation never works. I buy
a shirt. I wear the shirt. Nothing
happens. It's just a shirt, I realize.
Just a shirt. This is why I imagine
perfumes are the most anticlimactic
purchase you can make. Perfume
ads must be in a devilish bargain
with our inner critic, because
they've mastered the trick of mak
ing us believe that with this per
fume, we will transform into the
belle of the ball and be pursued by
an unshaven European man wear

ing a tuxedo. You cave and buy the
perfume. Nothing happens. You
look at it again and see it now. It's
just a bottle of liquid! 'You paid $5O
for this?' my brain shouts at me in
disbelief, the same brain that fell for
the promise of the European man.
Oh, brain.
Happiness is relative, yadda
yadda. You are surely smart cookies
and have a grasp on the basic tenets
of new-agey wisdom. We're children
of the '9os, after all. Where I start to
worry, though, is when I get to think
ing about my future. See, I've always
been enamored with this idea of The
Big Dream. I've loved the movies all
my life and I've never really deviated
from my ambition to be a writer
director. To consider doing some
thing else is too painful, too earth
shatteringly destabilizing, that I
can't even bear to fathom it. But this
question of happiness keeps nipping
at my ankles, prodding me to
answer: Is this really going to make
you happy? As far as I can tell, it is.
I love cinema, I truly do. Sometimes,
though, I imagine myself living at an
orangutan sanctuary somewhere in
Southeast Asia and being truly con
tent. You know, meditating and surf
ing and just being all-around happy
with life. What would be the differ
ence between happiness attained
that way versus happiness earned
tooth and nail, by achieving my
dream of success and fame? Can you
quantify happiness? Or a better
question, what makes one kind of
happiness more precious than the
other? In the end, isn't it the same?
Couldn't I be just as happy right
now, at 9 on a Wednesday night, chill
ing in my room? Who says I even
need to fly to Thailand?
"No! What are you saying, you
crazy hippie!" my brain fires back.
My brain gets scared by the work
involved in assuming a "happy"
state of mind. It's too impatient and
impulsive. It gets to poking me
about Thailand, and being in shape,
and yes, that shirt. Truly my brain
is the most effective slimy salesman
out there. If only you did this and
had these things, it coos, why then,
you'd be happy. Again, it seduces
me. I cave. I buy the damn shirt. A
few endorphins rush in, quickly
depart, and then it's back to square
one: back on the prowl for the next
quick fix. A few endorphins.
Disappointment. All of it hollow,
fruitless. I know this and yet I'm
still a slave to the material promise
of happiness. Out of laziness?
Impatience? Whatever it is, the
cycle is self-perpetuating. When it
comes down to it, who can resist the
perfumer's siren song, the glass vial
of concentrated happiness? So
effortless. Forget fifty bucks.
People would pay a million for that.

I'd like to talk a little about hap
piness. We're all trying to find
it, right? I am at least. It's a
trope so widely circulated that I
hesitate to use it, but what the heck.
You know: money won't buy you
happiness. I think we all have an
inkling of what makes us happy, like
being with people you like and eat
ing a bowl of ice cream. The down
side of happiness is that it's always
fleeting. It says hello, makes you
feel all warm and fuzzy, then takes
its leave without saying goodbye.
This should be somewhat com
forting. If happiness is fleeting, so is
sadness, right? All emotions are but
temporary. But when you're sad, it
feels like you'll be sad forever.
When you're happy, you can already
feel it slipping away.
What kills me is that happiness
is really just a state of mind. I can
be happy literally any moment. I
can will myself to be overjoyed
about how comfortable this blanket
feels, and there's no reason that
that my joy can't be equal (or
greater) than the joy of a man who
just bought a yacht. But of course, I
don't. I pin my happiness on things
out of my reach, like that cool T
shirt I really want. If only I had that
T-shirt, my brain whispers to me.
