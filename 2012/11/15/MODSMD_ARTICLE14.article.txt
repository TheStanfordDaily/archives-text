# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Stanford-isms that need to go 
### Adam Johnson 
When people talk to me, I
can often rest assured that
they are not intending to
be offensive. But sometimes, peo
ple do not realize the implications
of what they say. Below, then, you
will find two Stanford-isms, or com
mon sayings on campus, that never
fail to make me cringe. One may
dismiss these as pet peeves, but I
contend that they are more sub
stantial and have no place whatso

ever in our lexicon.
1. "Techie/fuzzy (divide)"
Oh how I wish this one would
just disappear! It is an arbitrary
distinction that serves little sub
stantive purpose. Some use the
techie/fuzzy lingo to quickly differ
entiate between fields of study. But
rather than calling me a techie to
describe my major, why not just say
I major in a STEM field?
Others, though, use the "techie"
and "fuzzy" labels to differentiate
between modes of thought: regard
less of one's major, a student is either
a techie or a fuzzy based on the way
she views the world. But does label
ing students in this manner accu
rately describe who they are? I have
a friend who, when someone asks
him whether he is a techie or a fuzzy,
responds "I am a human." I like his
answer. We are all humans, after all.
Our brains do not just see things
from a technical or humanist per
spective, but rather both. Many peo
ple may cite the right-brain/left
brain differences as evidence that
the techie/fuzzie divide is not arbi
trary. However, although there may
be differences between the two
hemispheres of our brain, the hemi
spheres are interconnected and
traits like creativity do not map
neatly to one side or the other.
The techie/fuzzy distinction,
unfortunately, reinforces this inac
curate interpretation of the science
and, furthermore, gives students a
convenient excuse to shirk intellec
tual challenges. "Don't ask me how
to edit your paper, I'm a techie," or
"Don't blame me for doing the cal
culation wrong, I'm a fuzzy." Not
only do students propagate these
labels, but members of the adminis
tration resort to this unnecessary
language when describing stu
dents. As Harry Elam recently
said, "we hope that techie students

can discover their inner fuzziness
and vice versa." Although I agree
with Mr. Elam's primary message,
the manner in which he says it only
hurts his cause. The continuation of
this dated distinction has no place
at a university like Stanford, and it
is my sincere hope that more stu
dents, faculty and administrators
will come to this conclusion.
2. "That's so retarded
At some point before I came to
Stanford, the phrase "That's so
gay" became taboo here. And for
good reason: by calling something
disagreeable "gay," one is in effect
associating homosexuality with
something that is stupid, wrong or
illogical. More often than not, the
phrase "That's so gay" was used by
well-meaning people who never
took the time to reflect on how their
slang could be offensive to others.
I cannot comprehend how
"that's so retarded" is any differ
ent, and yet I hear that phrase or a
close variation spoken about once a
week. I think a lot of it has to do with
the composition of our campus;
Stanford has a fair number of gay
students, but for obvious reasons
one is hard-pressed to find a
Stanford student who is cognitively
challenged. Perhaps that is why this
utterance is so often unchallenged.
Yet this slang is not only insensitive
to those who do have disabilities, but
to them friends, families and count
less other people. There's nothing
wrong with using negative adjec
tives to describe something you dis
agree with, but why resort to lan
guage that is denigrating towards
those with cognitive disabilities?
They are humans too, and it is time
we treat them as such.
