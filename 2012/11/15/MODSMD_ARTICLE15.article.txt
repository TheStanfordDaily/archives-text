## Locked-out hockey fan's lament 
### Joseph Beyda 
It's finally mid-November, the
flowers are blooming in the
Southern Hemisphere and I'm
pretty sure the sun is shining
somewhere above the blanket of
rain clouds that now call Stanford
home. That all means one thing: It's a
great time to be a hockey fan, especial
ly here in the Bay Area.
After a disappointing seventh
place finish in the Western
Conference last season, San Jose was
in second as of Ihesday with an 11-4-
1 record, just one point out of first
place. Fan favorite Patrick Marleau
who I think should be forced to
show up to games wearing a Beyda
jersey whenever I sport his teal
sweater in the stands leads the
league with 13 goals, and Ryane
Clowe is having a bounce-back year
with 10 of his own. Meanwhile, both
Joes (Pavelski and Thornton) are
among the NHEs top five assist-get
ters, and Jason Demers has more
helpers than any other defenseman
in the league.
Most importantly, the four worst
teams in the West right now are the
Blues (the Sharks' 2012 playoff neme
sis), the Red Wings (the Sharks' peren
nial postseason enemy), the Kings (the
Sharks' LA rival) and the Ducks (the
Sharks' other LA rival). I couldn't
have drawn it up better myself.
If all this comes as a surprise then
you've been living under a rock. You
can point to that pesky NHL lockout
thing all you want, but labor issues are
nothing to stop us true hockey fans.
ESPN, which still being sar
castic here we all know and love
for its top-class hockey coverage,
has taken the initiative to bring us
all the hockey we've missed over
the last month or so. With some
help from EA Sports' NHL 'l3
video game, the network is simulat
ing the entire hockey season and
reporting the results on its website,
making for a nice dash of comic
relief in between depressing bits of
news about the stagnating labor
negotiations.
The fans are frustrated, and
many of them are seeing the simula
tions as just one more slap in the
face; among the comments below
this week's online results are "This
is pathetic" and "Thanks, but no
thanks ESPN." But most of the com
menters are embracing the levity
that ESPN is going for, chiming in
with "What the heck is wrong with
my fake Pens????" and "Fake Red
Wings at the fake bottom of the fake
conference... I guess we won't be
making the fake playoffs."
ESPN's tongue-in-cheek approach
is much less silly than the owners'
and players' squabbles over how
many millions more they deserve
than them counterparts, their insis
tence on a fourth labor stoppage in
20 years and them faith in the loyal
ty of a fan base that's feeling quite
disillusioned right now. Because
even though I love NHL hockey
more than any other pro sport,
ESPN's league is acting much less
fake than the real deal.

As Viggy Venkataraman pointed
out about a month ago, the NHL
quickly alienated fair-weather fans
at the start of the lockout. But by
now, even the most devoted follow
ers of hockey those of us who con
stantly fight the perception of the
NHL as an inferior league in an
American market dominated by
football, basketball and baseball
are having trouble holding on.
Fellow Daily editor Ed Ngai, a
rabid Vancouver Canucks fan, and I
have joked that we're going to start
signing our emails with "F*** Gary
Bettman" instead of "Sincerely,"
because there's some pretty sincere
displeasure with the NHL commis
sioner right about now. (Plus,
Bettman is the last one to touch the
Stanley Cup before it's handed off to
the captain of each year's winning
team, and he has not once chosen the
Sharks or Canucks during his teniae.)
If a deal can't get worked out in
the next couple weeks, ESPN will be
all the hockey we've got for the
coming year. That's truly a shame,
because as wrong as it is to say that
Joey Beyda has played in as many
NHL games as Patrick Marleau has
by mid-November, it'll be way more
embarrassing to the sport if we can
say the same thing in six months'
time.
In any case, I'm locked and
loaded for an awesome season of
fake San Jose Sharks hockey. Now
please tell me you can't fake choke in
the fake playoffs....

Joseph Beyda is the only injury of
ESPN's fake NHL season thus far.

20 years and them faith in the loyal
ty of a fan base that's feeling quite
disillusioned right now. Because
even though I love NHL hockey
more than any other pro sport,
ESPN's league is acting much less
fake than the real deal.

As Viggy Venkataraman pointed
out about a month ago, the NHL
quickly alienated fair-weather fans
at the start of the lockout. But by
now, even the most devoted follow
ers of hockey those of us who con
stantly fight the perception of the
NHL as an inferior league in an
American market dominated by
football, basketball and baseball
are having trouble holding on.
Fellow Daily editor Ed Ngai, a
rabid Vancouver Canucks fan, and I
have joked that we're going to start
signing our emails with "F*** Gary
Bettman" instead of "Sincerely,"
because there's some pretty sincere
displeasure with the NHL commis
sioner right about now. (Plus,
Bettman is the last one to touch the
Stanley Cup before it's handed off to
the captain of each year's winning
team, and he has not once chosen the
Sharks or Canucks during his teniae.)
If a deal can't get worked out in
the next couple weeks, ESPN will be
all the hockey we've got for the
coming year. That's truly a shame,
because as wrong as it is to say that
Joey Beyda has played in as many
NHL games as Patrick Marleau has
by mid-November, it'll be way more
embarrassing to the sport if we can
say the same thing in six months'
time.
In any case, I'm locked and
loaded for an awesome season of
fake San Jose Sharks hockey. Now
please tell me you can't fake choke in
the fake playoffs....

Joseph Beyda is the only injury of
ESPN's fake NHL season thus far.

It's finally mid-November, the
flowers are blooming in the
Southern Hemisphere and I'm
pretty sure the sun is shining
somewhere above the blanket of
rain clouds that now call Stanford
home. That all means one thing: It's a
great time to be a hockey fan, especial
ly here in the Bay Area.
After a disappointing seventh
place finish in the Western
Conference last season, San Jose was
in second as of Ihesday with an 11-4-
1 record, just one point out of first
place. Fan favorite Patrick Marleau
who I think should be forced to
show up to games wearing a Beyda
jersey whenever I sport his teal
sweater in the stands leads the
league with 13 goals, and Ryane
Clowe is having a bounce-back year
with 10 of his own. Meanwhile, both
Joes (Pavelski and Thornton) are
among the NHEs top five assist-get
ters, and Jason Demers has more
helpers than any other defenseman
in the league.
Most importantly, the four worst
teams in the West right now are the
Blues (the Sharks' 2012 playoff neme
sis), the Red Wings (the Sharks' peren
nial postseason enemy), the Kings (the
Sharks' LA rival) and the Ducks (the
Sharks' other LA rival). I couldn't
have drawn it up better myself.
If all this comes as a surprise then
you've been living under a rock. You
can point to that pesky NHL lockout
thing all you want, but labor issues are
nothing to stop us true hockey fans.
ESPN, which still being sar
castic here we all know and love
for its top-class hockey coverage,
has taken the initiative to bring us
all the hockey we've missed over
the last month or so. With some
help from EA Sports' NHL 'l3
video game, the network is simulat
ing the entire hockey season and
reporting the results on its website,
making for a nice dash of comic
relief in between depressing bits of
news about the stagnating labor
negotiations.
The fans are frustrated, and
many of them are seeing the simula
tions as just one more slap in the
face; among the comments below
this week's online results are "This
is pathetic" and "Thanks, but no
thanks ESPN." But most of the com
menters are embracing the levity
that ESPN is going for, chiming in
with "What the heck is wrong with
my fake Pens????" and "Fake Red
Wings at the fake bottom of the fake
conference... I guess we won't be
making the fake playoffs."
ESPN's tongue-in-cheek approach
is much less silly than the owners'
and players' squabbles over how
many millions more they deserve
than them counterparts, their insis
tence on a fourth labor stoppage in
20 years and them faith in the loyal
ty of a fan base that's feeling quite
disillusioned right now. Because
even though I love NHL hockey
more than any other pro sport,
ESPN's league is acting much less
fake than the real deal.
