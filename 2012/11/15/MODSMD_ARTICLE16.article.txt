# WHY CARD CAN WIN
## THE 						PATH TO A VICTORY 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
In part one of a two-part' senes,
Miles Bennett-Smith looks at
Stanford's path to a win. Tomorrow,
read the Oregon perspective on why
the Ducks will win.

History is rarely kind to the
underdog.
In colonization, in investment
banking, in politics and in sports, the
favorites usually come out on top.
This is the driving principle behind
the joy and excitement that comes
from seeing the U.S. Olympic hockey
team's "Miracle" at Lake Placid and
watching the '69 Mets win the World
Series or stories like "Rudy." (I will
always love you, "Remember the
Titans," but T.C. Williams was a foot
ball team loaded with talent.)
For sports fans, rooting for the
underdog is so much nobler than
rooting on the teams that win a lot, or
seem to win a lot. That's why every
one hates the Yankees, Manchester
United and the SEC â€”you have to
give me that one, Ducks fans.
On Saturday night, Stanford slips
into that role, hoping to be
Cinderella at the ball, stealing a win
at Autzen Stadium before the clock
strikes midnight.
Oregon opened as a 24-point
favorite on the basis of perhaps the
most efficient offense in the last 20
years (this is where Baylor fans and
RGIII ciy fowl). Without question,
the Ducks should win this game on
paper.
The lesser-known weapons like

Josh Huff, Bralon Addison and Colt
Lyei'la I have to stop and
acknowledge that Lyerla is like
Optimus Klein with better hands
on the outside are scary, Kenjon
Barner is terrifying and Marcus
Mariota should at least be sitting in
the audience in New York City when
they hand out the Heisman next
month.
It's crazy to think that Stanford
will get close to covering, let alone
winning.
But it was crazy to think No. 1

Mabama would lose last week, and
then Johnny Football and Texas
A&M came along. It was crazy to
take Stanford beating USC when the
Trojans were legitimate 41-point
favorites.
Those happened, so maybe
Saturday is when the Ducks finally
get their wings clipped.
If Kevin Hogan is on his game
and handles the pressure, the kid is
really good. Ty Montgomery isn't an
elite receiver, but he has elite speed.
So does Kelsey Young, and Stepfan

Taylor should get a chance to play on
Sundays because he is one of the
most well-rounded running backs to
ever come out of the program. And
Zach Ertz is the best tight end in col
lege football.
By the way, the Cardinal defense
is nasty. Chase Thomas leads a line
backing core that has three, maybe
four, legit NFL prospects. The sec
ondary is much improved, and while
they have had problems with

Stepfan Taylor looks for a crease against the Oregon State defense. Taylor, who on Saturday became the
first runner in Stanford history to eclipse 1,000 yards on the ground in three consecutive seasons, will be
key to Stanford's chances in Eugene. If Taylor can run on the Duck defense, Stanford could grab the upset.
Oregon's speed the last couple
of years, and that's unlikely to
change, if they hold their
assignments they might slow
down the Ducks just enough
for the defensive line to make
its mark.
Because the pass rash is
coming.
Josh Mauro is quick with
strong enough hands that he
could have 10 sacks for a lot of
teams, but he rides the bench
much of the game because
Henry Anderson, Trent
Murphy and Ben Gardner are
relentless. And the stats don't
even tell the whole story. As
many sacks as Stanford has
recorded, the Cardinal should
have three times that num
ber, and while Mariota is as
slippery as an eel, capitaliz
ing more efficiently on those
knockdowns and quarter
back hurries is essential to
stopping the check-downs
that lead to missed tackles
and big runs that have killed
Stanford against Oregon.
But the secondary this
year is the key to Stanford's
claim to being a truly elite
unit and the key to slowing
the Ducks offense as much as

it can be slowed. (If you
haven't read about Lane
Kiffin calling his father
Monte and the ensuing
exchange, you should do that
ASAP)
Free safety Ed Reynolds,
who leads the nation in inter
ception return yardage,
should get Ail-American
recognition both as a ball
hawk and a heavy hitter over
the middle. Nickelback Usua
Amanam has made a huge
impact since transitioning to
his new role. True freshman
Alex Carter is an athletic
freak who has been punishing
wide receivers since earning
his first start two weeks ago.
And strong safety Jordan
Richards might be the best of
the lot in some scouts' eyes.
Stanford's goal should be
to hold Oregon to 35 points
which would be a serious feat
but is not impossible. Arizona
held the Ducks to 13 points in
the first half, and if the
Wildcats hadn't been as piss
poor as Colorado at doing any
thing in the red zone, would
have had the lead.
The Ducks generally wear
teams down so that by the
second half, it's off to the
races with Barner, Mariota
and De' Anthony Thomas. For
the Cardinal to win, it has to
temper the excitement sure
to be gained from slowing

Oregon at all in the first half
and maintain control through
out the game, because with
that kind of speed on turf,
three touchdowns on three
touches in three minutes
doesn't even make Kelly
blink.
At least Stanford has an
edge in the special teams
game, as Rob Beard is not a
very good college kicker and
I maintain that Jordan
Williamson is, despite what
most people on campus seem
to foolishly think.
Unfortunately, that means
Chip Kelly has even more
incentive to go for it on fourth
down....
No matter. Because the
biggest chink in the flashy
Nike armor Oregon will be
wearing stems from the rash
of injuries to the defense, and
they can't be covered with
Band-Aids.
FVee safety Avery Patterson
is reportedly out for the sea
son, and he was the second
string taking over for John
Boyett, whose career at
Oregon is now over thanks to
knee surgery.
The defensive line is
banged up, with Dion Jordan,
Isaac Remington and Ricky
Heimuli all out last week
against Cal, as were backup
comei'backs Dior Mathis and
Troy Hill. I can't believe that
they'll all be out again, and
Jordan is a beast if healthy.
But defensive end Taylor Hart
was hurt during the game
against the Bears, and Wade
Keliikipi didn't even travel to
Berkeley.
In short, the depth is thin
in many places. Stanford's
offense can put up points, and
then it might just be about
whether the Cardinal can
score slowly enough to keep
the Ducks off the field.
Stanford said many of the
same things last year, before
the Ducks went out and made
Mr. Luck more like Mr.
Irrelevant. But that doesn't
change the fact that if Oregon
doesn't play well, and
Stanford is almost perfect, the
Cardinal is primed to be the
one smelling roses come
January.

Stanford's upset chances in Eugene could come down to
a Jordan Williamson kick. Oregon has the edge in many
spots, but Williamson will be the best kicker on the field.
