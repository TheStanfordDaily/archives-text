# WHY CARD CAN WIN
## THE
						PATH TO A VICTORY 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
In part one of a two-part' senes,
Miles Bennett-Smith looks at
Stanford's path to a win. Tomorrow,
read the Oregon perspective on why
the Ducks will win.

History is rarely kind to the
underdog.
In colonization, in investment
banking, in politics and in sports, the
favorites usually come out on top.
This is the driving principle behind
the joy and excitement that comes
from seeing the U.S. Olympic hockey
team's "Miracle" at Lake Placid and
watching the '69 Mets win the World
Series or stories like "Rudy." (I will
always love you, "Remember the
Titans," but T.C. Williams was a foot
ball team loaded with talent.)
For sports fans, rooting for the
underdog is so much nobler than
rooting on the teams that win a lot, or
seem to win a lot. That's why every
one hates the Yankees, Manchester
United and the SEC â€”you have to
give me that one, Ducks fans.
On Saturday night, Stanford slips
into that role, hoping to be
Cinderella at the ball, stealing a win
at Autzen Stadium before the clock
strikes midnight.
Oregon opened as a 24-point
favorite on the basis of perhaps the
most efficient offense in the last 20
years (this is where Baylor fans and
RGIII ciy fowl). Without question,
the Ducks should win this game on
paper.
The lesser-known weapons like

Josh Huff, Bralon Addison and Colt
Lyei'la I have to stop and
acknowledge that Lyerla is like
Optimus Klein with better hands
on the outside are scary, Kenjon
Barner is terrifying and Marcus
Mariota should at least be sitting in
the audience in New York City when
they hand out the Heisman next
month.
It's crazy to think that Stanford
will get close to covering, let alone
winning.
But it was crazy to think No. 1

Mabama would lose last week, and
then Johnny Football and Texas
A&M came along. It was crazy to
take Stanford beating USC when the
Trojans were legitimate 41-point
favorites.
Those happened, so maybe
Saturday is when the Ducks finally
get their wings clipped.
If Kevin Hogan is on his game
and handles the pressure, the kid is
really good. Ty Montgomery isn't an
elite receiver, but he has elite speed.
So does Kelsey Young, and Stepfan

Taylor should get a chance to play on
Sundays because he is one of the
most well-rounded running backs to
ever come out of the program. And
Zach Ertz is the best tight end in col
lege football.
By the way, the Cardinal defense
is nasty. Chase Thomas leads a line
backing core that has three, maybe
four, legit NFL prospects. The sec
ondary is much improved, and while
they have had problems with

Stepfan Taylor looks for a crease against the Oregon State defense. Taylor, who on Saturday became the
first runner in Stanford history to eclipse 1,000 yards on the ground in three consecutive seasons, will be
key to Stanford's chances in Eugene. If Taylor can run on the Duck defense, Stanford could grab the upset.
