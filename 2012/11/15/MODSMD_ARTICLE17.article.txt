# STANFORD HOSTS ALCORN STATE
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While it is easy to overlook nonconference
play, Stanford men's basketball head coach
Johnny Dawkins and his players understand
that it is important to make a statement both
in the Pac-12 and on a national level in the
team's first few games of the regular season.
Coming off of a 2011-12 campaign that saw
the Cardinal capture its second National
Invitational Tournament championship, the
crew is projected to land an at-large bid in
this years NCAA tournament, something the
Card hasn't done since 2008, but not if
Stanford can't successfully navigate its non
conference schedule.
Stanford (2-0) will look to improve its
record to 3-0 tonight when it hosts the Alcorn
State Braves (1-1) in its second of three
straight home games. After pulling out a vic
tory against Oakwood University to open

their season, the Braves were dominated in
their second game of the year, falling to
Missouri by a score of 91-54. They will cer
tainly be looking to right the ship against the
Cardinal at Maples Pavilion.
Like Stanford, Alcorn State managed to
retain the majority of its core from last year,
losing only two seniors to graduation. The
Braves are returning two double-digit scor
ers from last season in Marquiz Baker (11.0
points per game) and Twann Oakley (10.5
points per game). However, the two seniors
have yet to see the floor thus far this season,
leaving the Braves desperate for a go-to scor
er heading into their game against Stanford.
Instead, the Card will have the task of
slowing down 6-foot-4 senior point guard
Anthony Nieves. Nieves scored a game-high
18 points in the Braves' contest with
Oakwood University and managed to drop 13

down the Braves' backcourt.
The duo was effective on
defense last season and
should enjoy the opportunity
to play against a couple of
solid offensive guards.
However, Alcorn State is
the team that needs to devel
op a fundamentally sound
defensive strategy. After
giving up 91 points to
Missouri, they will almost
surely struggle with a
Stanford offense that has
been very efficient through
its first two games.
While many people were
expecting Randle and Bright
to excel, the inside-out game
has appeared to be
Stanford's strong suit thus
far. The guards have run the
offense through their big
men (juniors Dwight Powell
and Josh Huestis), who have
been very effective in the
paint. Powell and Huestis
have terrorized opposing
defenses, using their unique
combination of size and ath
leticism to score inside of the

free-throw line. This has
opened up the court, giving
the sophomore Randle and
junior Bright open looks on
the perimeter.
In its first two games, the
Card has enjoyed timely
scoring from its veteran
players. When Randle and
Bright were struggling in
the season opener, Powell
was on top of his game, scor
ing a career-high 27 points.
Huestis chipped in 11, help
ing the Cardinal secure a
win. Conversely, the back
court mates of Randle and
Bright handled most of the
scoring on Monday night, as
Randle dropped a game
high 24 points to go along
with 16 for Bright.
Stanford will look to con

against Alcorn State, poten
tially improving their record
to 3-0 in the process.

in the big loss to Missouri.
He is shooting better than 50
percent from the floor over
the course of his first two
games, a very efficient mark.
He has also distributed the
ball well, accumulating five
assists.
Sophomore guard LeAntwan
Luckett has also stepped up
for the Braves, proving that
he should be considered for
the starting spot when
Oakley and Baker return to
action. Luckett scored 15
points on 7-13 shooting to go
along with four rebounds
and three assists in Alcorn
State's first game. He didn't
have as much luck against
Missouri, going a dismal 4-18
from the floor.

Randle and Aaron Bright
