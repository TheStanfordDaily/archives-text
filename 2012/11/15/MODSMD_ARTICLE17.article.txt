# STANFORD HOSTS ALCORN STATE
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
While it is easy to overlook nonconference
play, Stanford men's basketball head coach
Johnny Dawkins and his players understand
that it is important to make a statement both
in the Pac-12 and on a national level in the
team's first few games of the regular season.
Coming off of a 2011-12 campaign that saw
the Cardinal capture its second National
Invitational Tournament championship, the
crew is projected to land an at-large bid in
this years NCAA tournament, something the
Card hasn't done since 2008, but not if
Stanford can't successfully navigate its non
conference schedule.
Stanford (2-0) will look to improve its
record to 3-0 tonight when it hosts the Alcorn
State Braves (1-1) in its second of three
straight home games. After pulling out a vic
tory against Oakwood University to open

their season, the Braves were dominated in
their second game of the year, falling to
Missouri by a score of 91-54. They will cer
tainly be looking to right the ship against the
Cardinal at Maples Pavilion.
Like Stanford, Alcorn State managed to
retain the majority of its core from last year,
losing only two seniors to graduation. The
Braves are returning two double-digit scor
ers from last season in Marquiz Baker (11.0
points per game) and Twann Oakley (10.5
points per game). However, the two seniors
have yet to see the floor thus far this season,
leaving the Braves desperate for a go-to scor
er heading into their game against Stanford.
Instead, the Card will have the task of
slowing down 6-foot-4 senior point guard
Anthony Nieves. Nieves scored a game-high
18 points in the Braves' contest with
Oakwood University and managed to drop 13

Chasson Randle, Stanford's point guard, will look to guide the Card to a 3-0 start when
Alcorn State visits Maples Pavilion tonight. Randle scored 24 points in his last contest.
