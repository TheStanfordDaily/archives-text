## Stanford faces tough desert test 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men and women divers will face
off against some of the best competition in the
West this weekend when they head to Tucson for
the Arizona Diving Invitational. The three-day
meet will help head diving coach Rick Schavone
get a feel for the team's strengths and weakness
es and reassess season goals.
"It's really a working meet for us; it's an oppor
tunity for me to look at the team, see how they
dive and see what's missing," Schavone said.
The meet will feature the three individual div
ing events, the 1-meter, 3-meter and platform.
Unlike a dual meet, the invitational will feature a
setup resembling the NCAA championship, with
divers first competing in the preliminary competi
tion before moving on to the finals.
"The format's good for us. That's the best
part," said Schavone. "And the format gives us the
indication of who we'll be facing at the zone meet,"
the regional competition leading up to NCAAs.
Sophomore Kristian Ipsen will lead the way for
the men's squad, coming off an NCAA championship
in the 3-meter competition and an Olympic bronze
medal in the synchronized 3-meter in London. This
year, his primary focus will be NCAAs as he looks to
improve his already impressive resume.
"Kristian wants to win both titles, 1- and 3-
meter," said Schavone, who will also be hoping to
qualify a second diver for the meet.
On the women's side, junior Stephanie Phipps
is coming off her second All-American season and
will be looking to extend her streak to three
straight.
The meet will also provide a great first test for
the three freshmen on the women's squad,
Alexandra Clay, Lilly Hinrichs and Kelly Markle.
Schavone is looking forward to their future con
tributions to the team.
"Each has an area of improvement they have
to make, and they're all doing we 11.... Ido believe
they will be competitive at zones at the end of the
season."
This year's coaching changes in the men's
and women's swimming programs seem to have
run smoothly for the divers. Schavone and men's
head swim coach Ted Knapp were already close
friends during Knapp's time as assistant, and
women's head coach Greg Meehan has been
more actively involved in the program. "Both
have been a very good addition," said Schavone.
"Both men's and women's swumming have been
much closer."
One potentially limiting factor in the Arizona
meet will be Stanford's level of training.
Compared to most teams, the Cardinal is a full
month behind on training. Schavone accounts
for this, but still believes his teams can perform
well. "Everybody else has got at least a month
on us in training so they could be in a different
place. But we work really hard."
This weekend will be the first chance to see if
that hard work is paying off.
