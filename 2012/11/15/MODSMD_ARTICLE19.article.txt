## Ogwumike named Pac-12 Player of the Week 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
It didn't take long for pre
season Ail-American Chiney
Ogwumike to assert her
presence this year. The jun
ior forward took the season's
first Pac-12 Player of the
Week honor after averaging
22.5 points and 12 rebounds
in the Cardinal's two opening
weekend wins.
It is the fourth Pac-12
Player of the Week award for
Ogwumike, who won three
straight awards last season
and has earned all-conference

honors in each of her first two
seasons on the Farm.
This season is her first
without big sister Nneka on
the opposite block. Nneka's
absence was an absolute non
factor over the weekend, how
ever, when Chiney dropped 23
points, 17 boards and four
blocks on Fresno State as No.
4 Stanford extended the
nation's longest home win
ning streak to 80.
She followed that up with
a mere 22 points, seven
boards and four steals in a 92-
57 win over Santa Clara,
becoming the 33rd member of
Stanford's "1,000-Point Club."

A consensus pick as an
Ail-American in the presea
son as well as an early-season
candidate for the Wade
Trophy and John R. Wooden
Award, Ogwumike and her
teammates now face the
biggest test of the early sea
son. Stanford travels to
Honolulu this weekend for
the Jack in the Box Rainbow
Wahine Classic, taking on
No. 1 Baylor on Friday in a
rematch of last year's nation
al semifinal, which Baylor
won 59-47 en route to a
national title.
