## Finding ripples in space-time Stanford physicists work with NASA to develop atom interferometry technology 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
Deep in the basement of the Varian Physics Lab in
the Engineering Quad is an atom interferometer, an
experimental apparatus that could hold the key to
confirming Einstein's century-old prediction of rip
ples in the space-time continuum.
A ripple in water is visible to the naked eye, but a
ripple in outer space is more difficult to detect.
Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational
waves, ripples in the space-time continuum caused
when black holes, stars or galaxies interact. These
'ripples' have never been directly detected, but a
research project by Stanford physicists in collabora
tion with NASA may soon change that.

Started in 2004, the Stanford Advanced
Gravitational Wave Detector Research Program
achieved its first breakthroughs in the field in 2008
and attracted the attention of NASA in 2010. In
October, it was awarded a joint NASA Innovative
Advanced Concepts (NIAC) grant with NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center and AOSense, Inc. to
further develop the atom interferometry technology.
If the preliminary designs show success, the technol
ogy can be adapted for future spacecraft missions.
The collaboration plays to each of the participants'
strengths.
"Stanford is great for the basic research, AOSense
is great for engineering the technology for practical
applications and NASA is great for flying the mis
sions," said physics professor Mark Kasevich
