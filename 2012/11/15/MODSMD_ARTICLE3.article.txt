## Finding ripples in space-time Stanford physicists work with NASA to develop atom interferometry technology 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
Deep in the basement of the Varian Physics Lab in
the Engineering Quad is an atom interferometer, an
experimental apparatus that could hold the key to
confirming Einstein's century-old prediction of rip
ples in the space-time continuum.
A ripple in water is visible to the naked eye, but a
ripple in outer space is more difficult to detect.
Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational
waves, ripples in the space-time continuum caused
when black holes, stars or galaxies interact. These
'ripples' have never been directly detected, but a
research project by Stanford physicists in collabora
tion with NASA may soon change that.

Started in 2004, the Stanford Advanced
Gravitational Wave Detector Research Program
achieved its first breakthroughs in the field in 2008
and attracted the attention of NASA in 2010. In
October, it was awarded a joint NASA Innovative
Advanced Concepts (NIAC) grant with NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center and AOSense, Inc. to
further develop the atom interferometry technology.
If the preliminary designs show success, the technol
ogy can be adapted for future spacecraft missions.
The collaboration plays to each of the participants'
strengths.
"Stanford is great for the basic research, AOSense
is great for engineering the technology for practical
applications and NASA is great for flying the mis
sions," said physics professor Mark Kasevich
Ph. D.'92, who leads the Stanford
research group.
When gravitational waves reach
earth their impact is minimal,
expanding or contracting the plan
et by the width of an atom only. The
atom interferometer, a type of sen
sor known as a Gravitational Wave
Detector (GWD), could potentially
capture and measure these waves
for the first time, revealing infor
mation about the universe such as
when a star dies.
Currently, the only use of the
atom interferometer is testing two
theoretical predictions of general
relativity Einstein's Equivalence
Principle and the detection of grav
itational waves. However, the
future prospects of atom interfer
ometry are more extensive.
"It's an extremely disruptive
technology," said postdoctoral fel
low Jason Hogan Ph.D. 'lO, who
works on the project.
Atom interferometric sensors

form the basis of inertial navigation
systems in submarines and other
autonomous systems such as
Google Cars, and have promising
applications in climate and extra
terrestrial modeling and imaging,
ore and oil prospecting and earth
quake early-warning systems.
The U.S. military has shown
interest in the technology's poten
tial application in submarine and
aircraft sensors, and according to
the TechNewsDaily, Kasevich's lab
is working on gyroscopes, gravime
ters, accelerometers and gravity gra
diometers for the U.S. Department
of Defense. But Kasevich is quick to
point out that his group's work on
campus is in accordance with
University policy banning classi
fied research from being conducted
on campus.
Currently, preliminary tests,
which promise to be the most sensi
tive ever performed, are being con
ducted in the basement of Yarian in
a 33-foot drop tower. Creating a
space version of this technology is
still a long away.
Even so, there is a nervous opti
mism that the efforts will soon pay
off. According to the several mem

bers of the research group, a suc
cessful test would fundamentally
alter our understanding of space
and the universe.
Assuming the tests go accord
ing to plan, there are still many
challenges ahead.
"Atom interferometry has only
been around for 20 years, so it is
still a maturing field," Hogan said.
"As with any maturing field, there
are growing pains."
The feasibility of building an
atom interferometer sensor that
can fit on a satellite is still at least
five to 10 years away. Mission costs
are also expected to be high, with
estimated costs being north of $1 bil
lion.
However, Kasevich is confident
that continued investment will be
worth the cost.
"I am excited about the possibil
ities of this technology" he said.
"And even if our current approach
turns out to be incorrect, it is fair to
assume that a new technology or
approach will emerge from our
efforts nonetheless."

"It's an extremely disruptive
technology," said postdoctoral fel
low Jason Hogan Ph.D. 'lO, who
works on the project.
Atom interferometric sensors

form the basis of inertial navigation
systems in submarines and other
autonomous systems such as
Google Cars, and have promising
applications in climate and extra
terrestrial modeling and imaging,
ore and oil prospecting and earth
quake early-warning systems.
The U.S. military has shown
interest in the technology's poten
tial application in submarine and
aircraft sensors, and according to
the TechNewsDaily, Kasevich's lab
is working on gyroscopes, gravime
ters, accelerometers and gravity gra
diometers for the U.S. Department
of Defense. But Kasevich is quick to
point out that his group's work on
campus is in accordance with
University policy banning classi
fied research from being conducted
on campus.
Currently, preliminary tests,
which promise to be the most sensi
tive ever performed, are being con
ducted in the basement of Yarian in
a 33-foot drop tower. Creating a
space version of this technology is
still a long away.
Even so, there is a nervous opti
mism that the efforts will soon pay
off. According to the several mem

bers of the research group, a suc
cessful test would fundamentally
alter our understanding of space
and the universe.
Assuming the tests go accord
ing to plan, there are still many
challenges ahead.
"Atom interferometry has only
been around for 20 years, so it is
still a maturing field," Hogan said.
"As with any maturing field, there
are growing pains."
The feasibility of building an
atom interferometer sensor that
can fit on a satellite is still at least
five to 10 years away. Mission costs
are also expected to be high, with
estimated costs being north of $1 bil
lion.
However, Kasevich is confident
that continued investment will be
worth the cost.
"I am excited about the possibil
ities of this technology" he said.
"And even if our current approach
turns out to be incorrect, it is fair to
assume that a new technology or
approach will emerge from our
efforts nonetheless."
