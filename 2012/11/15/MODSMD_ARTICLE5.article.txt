# PA expands clean energy
## City signs 25-year solar energy contract to provide 5 percent of total electricity 
### SARAH MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto's Utilities Advisory
Commission and Finance
Committee announced their unani
mous approval of a 25-year contract
with Brannon Solar LLC on Nov. 5.
This is the city's first solar energy
contract, and the company will pro
vide up to 52,000-megawatt-hours,
5% of the city's electricity needs,
per year for no more than $9l mil
lion for the duration of the contract.

"Solar prices were about two
times as much a couple years ago
but there has been an overall down
ward trend in California," said
James Cook, chair of the Palo Alto
Utilities Advisory Commission.
"This contract could be the first of
more solar projects for Palo Alto
energy sources."
The company's Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) was approved at
the city council meeting as part of
the city's Renewable Portfolio
Standard goal of getting at least 33
percent of Palo Alto's energy from
renewable sources by 2015. Cook
estimates that approximately 20
percent of the Palo Alto's energy
came from renewable sources prior
to this contract. The remainder of
the energy is "brown," he said, or
non-renewable.

Since 2004, Palo Alto has signed
10 contracts for renewable energy,
including wind, landfill gas and
geothermal projects based in
northern and central California.

"Palo Alto is moving to a carbon
free energy growth plan, which
would be completely carbon neutral
[by 2015]," Palo Alto Vice Mayor
Greg Scharff said.
The efforts to provide 33 per
cent of Palo Alto's energy from
renewable sources by 2015 are part
of a larger effort to make Palo Alto
a greener city.
"We're in the process of another
RFP [Request for Proposals] for
renewable energy contracts," Cook
said. "We also have ongoing energy
efficiency projects, so we don't need
as much energy in the first place."
In the fall of 2011, Palo Alto
issued a request for PPA. Scharff
explained that price and the avail

ability of resources are major con
siderations when examining PPAs.
"Geothermal, for instance, pro
vides power all the time," Scharff
said. "Wind power provides power
when the wind blows. Solar pro
vides when the sun shines. You take
that into account, but you also try
to go with the lowest cost."
Brannon Solar's agreement was
deemed the best overall, in addition
to offering the lowest price of $77
per megawatt-hour. The original
price was $72 per megawatt hour,
but after the U.S. Department of
Commerce's decision to impose tar
iffs on Chinese solar cells, Brannon
Solar said the original price would
be impossible. Negotiations with
the City led to the final rate of $77.
"We were very, very excited to
get the renewable energy for a very
reasonable rate, much more rea
sonable than what we had project
ed," Finance Committee member
Nancy Shepherd said.
Shepherd also explained that
these contracts are investments
because the city not only receives
revenue and energy from compa
nies like Brannon Solar, but it also
provides the companies capital to
build the renewable technology.

"We have to invest as the fields
go into place," Shepherd said. "As
the Utilities Commission makes
these relationships, these companies
... would rather work with the city of
Palo Alto than places like [Pacific
Gas and Electric]. They offer it to us
because they know that we build up
a reserve in order to go in and make
these types of investments to secure
our renewable energy supply, to
maintain our portfolio."
The contract allows the city to
opt for a five-year extension, to be
determined at the end of the con
tract's 24th year.
The Brannon Solar project that
will provide Palo Alto's energy is
based in Fresno County. In addition
to building facilities in Palo Alto,
Brannon Solar's parent company,
Trina Solar, is building a total of
four other solar projects in Fresno
County and Sacramento County.

deemed the best overall, in addition
to offering the lowest price of $77
per megawatt-hour. The original
price was $72 per megawatt hour,
but after the U.S. Department of
Commerce's decision to impose tar
iffs on Chinese solar cells, Brannon
Solar said the original price would
be impossible. Negotiations with
the City led to the final rate of $77.
"We were very, very excited to
get the renewable energy for a very
reasonable rate, much more rea
sonable than what we had project
ed," Finance Committee member
Nancy Shepherd said.
Shepherd also explained that
these contracts are investments
because the city not only receives
revenue and energy from compa
nies like Brannon Solar, but it also
provides the companies capital to
build the renewable technology.

"We have to invest as the fields
go into place," Shepherd said. "As
the Utilities Commission makes
these relationships, these companies
... would rather work with the city of
Palo Alto than places like [Pacific
Gas and Electric]. They offer it to us
because they know that we build up
a reserve in order to go in and make
these types of investments to secure
our renewable energy supply, to
maintain our portfolio."
The contract allows the city to
opt for a five-year extension, to be
determined at the end of the con
tract's 24th year.
The Brannon Solar project that
will provide Palo Alto's energy is
based in Fresno County. In addition
to building facilities in Palo Alto,
Brannon Solar's parent company,
Trina Solar, is building a total of
four other solar projects in Fresno
County and Sacramento County.
