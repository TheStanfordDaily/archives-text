Peter Bergen delivered Stanford's
sixth annual Daniel Pearl Memorial
Lecture on Wednesday night.
Bergen, who became the first jour
nalist to interview bin Laden on tel
evision in 1997, provided a detailed
look into the hunt for Osama bin
Laden, describing the intricate web
of evidence that led to bin Laden's
compound and discussing the
promises and pitfalls of the eventu
al decision to send SEAL Team Six
to assassinate the al-Qaida leader.
The Daniel Pearl lectures, pre
sented by Hillel at Stanford and the
Daniel Pearl Foundation, are held
in tribute to the life and death of
Daniel Pearl 'B5, a Wall Street
Journal bureau chief who was
abducted and killed while working
in Pakistan in 2002.
Judea Pearl, Daniel's father,
commenced the presentation with a
moving speech and a recitation of a
poem he had composed for his son.
"The lecture tonight will take
place under the shadows of two
icons, Daniel Pearl and Osama bin
Laden," he said. "They stand light
years apart. They contrast every
thing we uphold and everything we
reject."
Bergen began his talk with an
overview of bin Laden's life in the
compound, saying that, for a fugi
tive, he lived in surprising comfort.
"It wasn't a bad life, for the
world's most wanted man," he said.
"By Pakistani standards, it was a
fairly nice place to live."
However, he tempered his state
ments by describing the severe
lack of amenities and facilities at
the compound. As the only journal
ist allowed to tour the compound
before it was destroyed, he saw bin
Laden's dwellings firsthand.
"The scenes that I saw rein
forced my understanding of what
life was like. It was a fairly squalid
existence," he said.

Capturing the moving parts
Bin Laden's declining influence
was undeniable, Bergen argued,
but the fact that he had not been
caught or killed weighed heavily on
the last two presidential adminis
trations.

"Even though he had become
less relevant as a historical matter,
I think it was very important to
track him down," he said.

Interrogation of al-Qaida opera
tives failed to lead to bin Laden's
capture, leading Bergen to con
clude the search underwent a fun
damental shift.

"Over time, there became an
understanding that we would have
to go back to some very basic first
principles ... to find bin Laden," he
said.

Bergen went on to describe the
intricate and complex "moving
parts" that dominated the subse
quent search for bin Laden. The so
called "20th hijacker" provided
instrumental evidence under
extreme duress after his capture in
2002, but it was only after many
dead ends and wasted leads that
useful intelligence emerged.
The breakthrough emerged six
years later, Bergen said, when
American security agencies estab
lished the identity of a courier who
served the bin Laden house, and a
National Security Agency record
ing firmly established a link to bin
Laden's Abottabad hideaway.
"Sometime in 2010, the
National Security Agency is listen
ing to a guy they think is the couri
er," Bergen said. "The conversation
indicated that the courier was
working for al-Qaida."
The call was eventually traced
to an individual in Peshawar.
"Eventually, they put spies on
the ground in Peshawar, and they
tracked and followed the guy to
Abottabad," Bergen said.
The courier's arrival at "a large
compound that had no Internet or
phone lines, and in which the inhab
itants had been burning their own
trash," sparked suspicion among
the authorities.

A weighty decision
Intense debates began within
the Obama administration about
how to move forward with the
operations, and even when
President Obama gave the final
order authorizing the raid, there
was disagreement within his team
of national security advisors.
"There were no high-fives in the
Oval Office," Bergen said.
The ultimate decision was the
president's and, according to Bergen,
"it was not an easy decision."
"People who had lived through
the WMD fiasco in Iraq were
understandably concerned,"
Bergen said.
The President was forced to
wrestle with large questions about
the scope and force of American
military power, and ultimately
sided on the side of the military
raid because of his background,
Bergen argued.
"I think he's the first major
American political figure for whom
what he did or did not do in
Vietnam is not a part of his story,"
he said. "So this is a president
who's very comfortable with the
use of American hard power."

Bergen closed by describing the
actual raid quite briefly, detailing
the actions of members of SEAL
Team 6 and the errors and success
es of the operation. Upon conclud
ing his narrative of the event,
Bergen answered questions from
the audience that ranged from
drone strikes to Pakistani authori
ties' potential awareness and with
holding of bin Laden's where
abouts.
"This was not a heroic ending"
Bergen closed with remarks on
A1 Qaeda's downfall and impending
irrelevance.
"Bin Laden failed, and he failed
on many levels.... 9/11 was a strate
gic failure for al-Qaida," he said.
"They lost the best base they ever
had, which was pre-9/11
Afghanistan. They lost the war of
ideas."
"This is a group that is largely
out of business," he closed. "As a
journalist who covers this sort of
thing, I feel like a Sovietologist in
1989."
