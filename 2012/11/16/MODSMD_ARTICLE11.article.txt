# RAMBLINGS
## When time stands still 
### Alex Bayer 
Two years ago, a girl I went to
middle school with passed
away in a car accident. She
and her boyfriend had been driving
90 miles per hour on a windy road.
They were killed instantly. I found
out in a most ungraceful way unbe
fitting of any tragedy: through peo
ple's Faeebook statuses. Shock
flooded the airwaves. Her Faeebook
was still up, and here her friends
gathered to process the loss. People
recalled memories of her, consoled
each other, wrote prayers addressed
to heaven. Like flowers, I suppose,
but in the age of social media, grief is
conducted in public. Virtual flowers.
Interactive sympathy cards. Is this
the future of mourning?
Grief unfolds in predictable stages
when it's a matter of someone you
love intimately But how is it supposed
to work when someone you used to
know suddenly dies, well after you
have parted ways and lapsed out of
communication and become, to one
another, passing blips on the news
feed? I think of all the kids I had inside
jokes with in seventh grade, and how
many I talk to now.
There was a time I was pretty
good friends with Mellissa. We did
track together, competed on the
same four-person relay team. We had
overlapping friends. We joked
around. She entertained my quirki
ness. She was always laughing.

Middle school came to an end.
She went off to Avon High, and I
went off to a private high school.
Years went by and my old friendships
started clocking out. People forgot
who I was, or pretended to. By the
time I heard the news, I hadn't seen
Mellissa for at least three years.
I used to read her wall every day,
every post. Sometimes I wanted to
write something, but my fingertips

hesitated on the keys. This was a
space for people who loved her. Knew
her. What could I write? Nothing
insightful, nothing beautiful. I was a
stranger. I wanted to ciy. I tiled to
make myself cry. I flipped through
her photos and read her obituary
again and again, trying to make it sink
in, waiting for it to process. She is
gone. But how to transcribe her
absence these past few years to a
greater, more profound absence?
How to trick my mind into realizing
that her absence is no longer simply
circumstantial? How do I trigger the
tears? How do I make this feel real,
so that I can grieve and feel like a
person capable of caring about an
old friend?
Two years later, her Faeebook
page is still up. That same photo is
there, her senior portrait. She will
never age, I realize. There she is,
swaying from a tree, leaning 45
degrees to the left, because why not,
because she is the picture of youth
on the cusp of everything.
Suspended in time. Life, trapped in
the form of potential energy that
will never become kinetic.
She is what I think about when I
think about Connecticut in the
spring. There are few things I like
about Connecticut, but I love the
spring. The warm, dewy mornings,
the lawnmowers in the afternoon.
How green it was. I remember
every landmark along the walk from
the middle school to the high school
we took daily for track practice.
Luke's Doughnuts. The brand new
mortuary. The gas station where we
bought slushies, also rumored to be
robbed at gunpoint more frequently
than any other business in Avon.
And how could I forget the sound of
cars on West Avon Road, the
glimpses of fresh-faced high school-

ers riding off to unknown adven
tures, the rising and fading waves of
Radio Top 40? How could I forget
any of this? Stretching on the foot
ball field. The warmth on my arms.
Those lawnmowers. Warm-up
sprints. Packs of girls meandering
around the track, spying on those
high school boys.
The four of us get together. We
take up our positions on the track.
Ready, go. The first girl sprints,
hands it off. The second girl sprints,
hands it to Mellissa. Mellissa's com
ing up behind me. There's so much
fight in her that you cannot ignore
the presence barreling toward you.
But she is so composed. That face.
Whenever I run, my face contorts
into a heaving eyesore, but she's got
everything locked down. When she's
coming your way, her wide brown
eyes are full of fight. Off-duty, they
are gentle. She was always that way;
hers was the loveliest, most photo
genic smile. The fire's always there,
though. I don't know what it is. I
haven't figured it out. This was not
the faux strength of a middle school
queen. There was not a single trace
of malice or jealousy in it. This was
strength well beyond her years, a
quiet strength that she never had the
ego to assert. But you felt it. You
were drawn to it. I saw it, in the form
of a runner sprinting to the spot
where I now stood.

I start to run and extend my ami
behind me. I look back for a second,
see her pouring her last ounce of
energy into this final meter. The
baton slips into my fingers, and I
race off as fast as my legs can carry
me. I never look back. I never think
to look back.

hers was the loveliest, most photo
genic smile. The fire's always there,
though. I don't know what it is. I
haven't figured it out. This was not
the faux strength of a middle school
queen. There was not a single trace
of malice or jealousy in it. This was
strength well beyond her years, a
quiet strength that she never had the
ego to assert. But you felt it. You
were drawn to it. I saw it, in the form
of a runner sprinting to the spot
where I now stood.

I start to run and extend my ami
behind me. I look back for a second,
see her pouring her last ounce of
energy into this final meter. The
baton slips into my fingers, and I
race off as fast as my legs can carry
me. I never look back. I never think
to look back.

Two years ago, a girl I went to
middle school with passed
away in a car accident. She
and her boyfriend had been driving
90 miles per hour on a windy road.
They were killed instantly. I found
out in a most ungraceful way unbe
fitting of any tragedy: through peo
ple's Faeebook statuses. Shock
flooded the airwaves. Her Faeebook
was still up, and here her friends
gathered to process the loss. People
recalled memories of her, consoled
each other, wrote prayers addressed
to heaven. Like flowers, I suppose,
but in the age of social media, grief is
conducted in public. Virtual flowers.
Interactive sympathy cards. Is this
the future of mourning?
Grief unfolds in predictable stages
when it's a matter of someone you
love intimately But how is it supposed
to work when someone you used to
know suddenly dies, well after you
have parted ways and lapsed out of
communication and become, to one
another, passing blips on the news
feed? I think of all the kids I had inside
jokes with in seventh grade, and how
many I talk to now.
There was a time I was pretty
good friends with Mellissa. We did
track together, competed on the
same four-person relay team. We had
overlapping friends. We joked
around. She entertained my quirki
ness. She was always laughing.

Middle school came to an end.
She went off to Avon High, and I
went off to a private high school.
Years went by and my old friendships
started clocking out. People forgot
who I was, or pretended to. By the
time I heard the news, I hadn't seen
Mellissa for at least three years.
I used to read her wall every day,
every post. Sometimes I wanted to
write something, but my fingertips

hesitated on the keys. This was a
space for people who loved her. Knew
her. What could I write? Nothing
insightful, nothing beautiful. I was a
stranger. I wanted to ciy. I tiled to
make myself cry. I flipped through
her photos and read her obituary
again and again, trying to make it sink
in, waiting for it to process. She is
gone. But how to transcribe her
absence these past few years to a
greater, more profound absence?
How to trick my mind into realizing
that her absence is no longer simply
circumstantial? How do I trigger the
tears? How do I make this feel real,
so that I can grieve and feel like a
person capable of caring about an
old friend?
Two years later, her Faeebook
page is still up. That same photo is
there, her senior portrait. She will
never age, I realize. There she is,
swaying from a tree, leaning 45
degrees to the left, because why not,
because she is the picture of youth
on the cusp of everything.
Suspended in time. Life, trapped in
the form of potential energy that
will never become kinetic.
She is what I think about when I
think about Connecticut in the
spring. There are few things I like
about Connecticut, but I love the
spring. The warm, dewy mornings,
the lawnmowers in the afternoon.
How green it was. I remember
every landmark along the walk from
the middle school to the high school
we took daily for track practice.
Luke's Doughnuts. The brand new
mortuary. The gas station where we
bought slushies, also rumored to be
robbed at gunpoint more frequently
than any other business in Avon.
And how could I forget the sound of
cars on West Avon Road, the
glimpses of fresh-faced high school-

ers riding off to unknown adven
tures, the rising and fading waves of
Radio Top 40? How could I forget
any of this? Stretching on the foot
ball field. The warmth on my arms.
Those lawnmowers. Warm-up
sprints. Packs of girls meandering
around the track, spying on those
high school boys.
The four of us get together. We
take up our positions on the track.
Ready, go. The first girl sprints,
hands it off. The second girl sprints,
hands it to Mellissa. Mellissa's com
ing up behind me. There's so much
fight in her that you cannot ignore
the presence barreling toward you.
But she is so composed. That face.
Whenever I run, my face contorts
into a heaving eyesore, but she's got
everything locked down. When she's
coming your way, her wide brown
eyes are full of fight. Off-duty, they
are gentle. She was always that way;
hers was the loveliest, most photo
genic smile. The fire's always there,
though. I don't know what it is. I
haven't figured it out. This was not
