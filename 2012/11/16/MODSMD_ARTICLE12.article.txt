## Pressure, turnovers key for Card 
### Sam Fisher 
When Stanford
heads up to
Eugene for
Saturday's game,
it better be ready
for a tough test. Unlike overrated
USC back in September, the Ducks
scare me. I don't think Stanford is bet
ter than Oregon, but I do think
Stanford has a better chance in this
game than many people everyone
from Vegas odds makers to local
media members—think.
Forgive me if I sound a bit like
Miles Bennett-Smith over the next
800 words or so—that's his fault for
wilting a similar story yesterday.
Miles made some great points and
there are a few differences in our
beliefs, but there is one thing that we
both definitely agree on.
Stanford can beat Oregon. It won't
be easy and it would, and should, be
considered a big upset. However, con
trary to what people want you to
believe, it's nowhere near impossible.
There are a few key matchups in this
game that Stanford needs to win or
keep close if it wants a chance to
escape at 9-2.
First, Stanford has to take full
advantage of Oregon's injuries on the
defensive side of the ball. Oregon is
very banged up on the defensive line
and in the defensive backfield, expos
ing two layers of vulnerability. In
phase one, the Cardinal has to be able
to move the football consistently and
efficiently on the ground. Stepfan
Taylor can give the defense precious
time on the bench to rest and work on
adjustments.
But controlling the ball itself,
though necessary to beat Oregon, is
not nearly sufficient. Stanford also
must score touchdowns, and lots of
them, to really have a chance in the
game. That's where Oregon's injuries
in the secondary become vital to
Stanford's success. Those injuries,
combined with Stanford's ground suc
cess, should be enough to open some
big holes in the secondary If there's
been a knock on Kevin Hogan through
two games, it's been a bit of inconsis
tency on the deep ball. Hogan will
have to make those precious chances
count —no more missing Devon
Cajuste wide open down the middle of
the field.

Defensively it's the same theme:
play solidly all game, and take advan
tage of big play opportunities. Neither
of these are easy tasks. Oregon is
deadly from anywhere on the field
in military terms, the Ducks have
quick-strike capability and
Stanford won't be able to stop them.
Kenjon Barner, De' Anthony Thomas
and Marcus Mariota could all break an
80-yard play at any time, and the odds
are that at least one of those Ducks
will come up big.
Stanford doesn't have to stop the
Oregon offense to leave Eugene with a
victory. Honestly, stopping the Ducks
is probably impossible for anything
short of an NFL defense. However,
Stanford does have the ability to do
enough on defense to shock the world
and get the win.
First and foremost, Stanford
needs to get consistent pressure from
the defensive line. In the past two
years, Stanford has had success slow
ing down the Oregon offense for fairly
long stretches. The key to both games
was pressure from the defensive line.
Oregon's running backs are spectacu
lar in the open field, but they are veiy
beatable when they have to make their
first cut behind the line of scrimmage.
Then, when Oregon is forced to
pass the football, Stanford must get its
shots in on Mariota. David Shaw quot
ed the late A1 Davis on this matter
during his Hiesday press conference:
"The quarterback must go down and
must go down hard." I could not possi
bly agree more, especially with the
chance that Oregon backup quarter
back Biyan Bennett will play defense
in this game.
At the end of the day though, I
believe this game will come down to
two keys: special teams and turnovers.
I know it's cliche to bring up those
points I feel like eveiy NFL ana
lyst right about now —but I think
they are especially crucial to this con
test and I give Stanford the edge in
both categories.
If this game comes down to the
kickers, I think Stanford has the edge.
Jordan Williamson has had his ups
and downs, but he will still be the best
kicker on the field on Saturday.
The key for Stanford on special
teams will be winning the big-play bat
tle. Stanford can't let De' Anthony
Thomas dominate the return game, or
else it could be a long night. If Drew
Terrell could pitch in with a big punt
return assuming Oregon punts in
the game—it would provide a huge
boost.
There may be many paths to vic
tory for Stanford, but every single
one will involve Stanford winning, or
at least tying, the turnover battle.
Stanford struggled mightily holding
onto the football against Oregon
State and barely survived; the Card
won't be so lucky against the offen
sive juggernaut that is the Oregon
Ducks.
That Duck offense does have a
turnover weakness. Oregon has fum
bled the ball 25 times on the season,
an astounding 2.5 fumbles per game.
It hasn't hurt them though, because
Oregon has recovered the majority

of these fumbles. With a forecast of
rain and Stanford's propensity to
deliver big hits, Oregon will put the
ball on the turf. Stanford needs to be
first to the football and take advan
tage.
The key to that will be defensive
pursuit to the football, which
Stanford should be doing anyway to
help slow down Barner, Thomas and
Mariota. When Alex Carter delivers
his requisite big hit on the outside,
will Chase Thomas be there to pick
up the football? If so, don't be shocked
to see this game close to the very end.

Oregon fumble. Ever since, he's
spent his Saturdays in the press
box. If you've ever felt like a human
sled too, console him. at

tency on the deep ball. Hogan will
have to make those precious chances
count —no more missing Devon
Cajuste wide open down the middle of
the field.

Defensively it's the same theme:
play solidly all game, and take advan
tage of big play opportunities. Neither
of these are easy tasks. Oregon is
deadly from anywhere on the field
in military terms, the Ducks have
quick-strike capability and
Stanford won't be able to stop them.
Kenjon Barner, De' Anthony Thomas
and Marcus Mariota could all break an
80-yard play at any time, and the odds
are that at least one of those Ducks
will come up big.
Stanford doesn't have to stop the
Oregon offense to leave Eugene with a
victory. Honestly, stopping the Ducks
is probably impossible for anything
short of an NFL defense. However,
Stanford does have the ability to do
enough on defense to shock the world
and get the win.
First and foremost, Stanford
needs to get consistent pressure from
the defensive line. In the past two
years, Stanford has had success slow
ing down the Oregon offense for fairly
long stretches. The key to both games
was pressure from the defensive line.
Oregon's running backs are spectacu
lar in the open field, but they are veiy
beatable when they have to make their
first cut behind the line of scrimmage.
Then, when Oregon is forced to
pass the football, Stanford must get its
shots in on Mariota. David Shaw quot
ed the late A1 Davis on this matter
during his Hiesday press conference:
"The quarterback must go down and
must go down hard." I could not possi
bly agree more, especially with the
chance that Oregon backup quarter
back Biyan Bennett will play defense
in this game.
At the end of the day though, I
believe this game will come down to
two keys: special teams and turnovers.
I know it's cliche to bring up those
points I feel like eveiy NFL ana
lyst right about now —but I think
they are especially crucial to this con
test and I give Stanford the edge in
both categories.
If this game comes down to the
kickers, I think Stanford has the edge.
Jordan Williamson has had his ups
and downs, but he will still be the best
kicker on the field on Saturday.
The key for Stanford on special
teams will be winning the big-play bat
tle. Stanford can't let De' Anthony
Thomas dominate the return game, or
else it could be a long night. If Drew
Terrell could pitch in with a big punt
return assuming Oregon punts in
the game—it would provide a huge
boost.
There may be many paths to vic
tory for Stanford, but every single
one will involve Stanford winning, or
at least tying, the turnover battle.
Stanford struggled mightily holding
onto the football against Oregon
State and barely survived; the Card
won't be so lucky against the offen
sive juggernaut that is the Oregon
Ducks.
That Duck offense does have a
turnover weakness. Oregon has fum
bled the ball 25 times on the season,
an astounding 2.5 fumbles per game.
It hasn't hurt them though, because
Oregon has recovered the majority

of these fumbles. With a forecast of
rain and Stanford's propensity to
deliver big hits, Oregon will put the
ball on the turf. Stanford needs to be
first to the football and take advan
tage.
The key to that will be defensive
pursuit to the football, which
Stanford should be doing anyway to
help slow down Barner, Thomas and
Mariota. When Alex Carter delivers
his requisite big hit on the outside,
will Chase Thomas be there to pick
up the football? If so, don't be shocked
to see this game close to the very end.

When Stanford
heads up to
Eugene for
Saturday's game,
it better be ready
for a tough test. Unlike overrated
USC back in September, the Ducks
scare me. I don't think Stanford is bet
ter than Oregon, but I do think
Stanford has a better chance in this
game than many people everyone
from Vegas odds makers to local
media members—think.
Forgive me if I sound a bit like
Miles Bennett-Smith over the next
800 words or so—that's his fault for
wilting a similar story yesterday.
Miles made some great points and
there are a few differences in our
beliefs, but there is one thing that we
both definitely agree on.
Stanford can beat Oregon. It won't
be easy and it would, and should, be
considered a big upset. However, con
trary to what people want you to
believe, it's nowhere near impossible.
There are a few key matchups in this
game that Stanford needs to win or
keep close if it wants a chance to
escape at 9-2.
First, Stanford has to take full
advantage of Oregon's injuries on the
defensive side of the ball. Oregon is
very banged up on the defensive line
and in the defensive backfield, expos
ing two layers of vulnerability. In
phase one, the Cardinal has to be able
to move the football consistently and
efficiently on the ground. Stepfan
Taylor can give the defense precious
time on the bench to rest and work on
adjustments.
But controlling the ball itself,
though necessary to beat Oregon, is
not nearly sufficient. Stanford also
must score touchdowns, and lots of
them, to really have a chance in the
game. That's where Oregon's injuries
in the secondary become vital to
Stanford's success. Those injuries,
combined with Stanford's ground suc
cess, should be enough to open some
big holes in the secondary If there's
been a knock on Kevin Hogan through
two games, it's been a bit of inconsis
tency on the deep ball. Hogan will

Cajuste wide open down the middle of
