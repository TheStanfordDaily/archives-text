# BREAKING BAYLOR
## NO. 1 BEARS STILL TOUGH 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Pac-12 Player of the Week
Chiney Ogwumike put it,
Stanford's narrow victory over
Fresno State last Friday night was
a "gut check" for the women's bas
ketball team, a test that hopefully
helped to prepare the Cardinal for
the much tougher competition it
faces tonight against No. 1 Baylor.
The season opener was no walk
in the park for Stanford. To put the
72-61 win in perspective, the Card
has beaten Fresno State by an
average margin of close to 30
points in the past several years.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
pointed out that defense and
rebounding were key struggles for
the Cardinal that need to be
resolved before the team faces
Baylor.
"Twenty-five offensive rebounds
[by Fresno State] is inexcusable for
anybody out there; that's hustle,"
Ogwumike said. "I know I made
mistakes, other people made mis
takes. I believe defense is all heart,
and as a collective group we need
to bring up our intensity and our
aggressiveness. We are going to
work so that doesn't happen
again."
And the Cardinal didn't let it
happen again. They played a com
pletely different game on Sunday
against Santa Clara, decisively
beating the Broncos 97-57.
The successful duo of
Ogwumike and senior Joslyn
Tinkle led the team in the opening
weekend series. Ogwumike aver
aged 22.5 points and 12 rebounds

on the weekend and scored her
I,oooth career point against Santa
Clara Tinkle averaged 19.5
points in the two contests.
The real player connection
made, however, was between soph
omore point guard Amber
Orrange and Ogwumike. Orrange
averaged 16 points and 5.5 assists
per game, most of which were con
verted by Ogwumike in the paint.
With first-game nerves out of
the way, and with a convincing win
under their belt, the Cardinal now
looks ahead to possibly their
toughest opponent of the season.
Stanford takes on top-ranked
Baylor tonight in Honolulu at the
Jack in the Box Rainbow Wahine
Classic.
"I'm getting goose bumps
thinking about it," Tinkle said.
"We're ready to play a great team
and great players."
This game will be a rematch of
last year's Final Four game in
which Baylor beat the Card 59-47,
largely in part due to the domi
nance of senior Brittney Griner.
Last season Griner was named
the AP National Player of the Year
after averaging 23.2 points, 9.5
rebounds and 5.2 blocks per game.
Griner put up 27 points against
No. 6 Kentucky in last week's 85-
51 Lady Bears victory.
"I think the fact that we played
them last year helps us this time
around, but it probably also helps
them too in that they know our
team a little bit better,"
VanDerveer said. "We always want
to play a very challenging schedule

Though all the attention will be on Chiney Ogwumike and Brittney
Griner in Friday's marquee matchup, junior guard Sara James (21) is
one player whose contributions could help turn the tide in Stanford's
favor when it faces an old Final Four nemesis, the Baylor Bears.
and we want to know early on what
we need to work on, areas where we
need to improve. Our team is excit
ed about it. It's not like you're going
to end your season with one game.
It'll be a game where we'll learn a
lot about ourselves and it's a win
win. If you win the game, great, and
if you don't win the game it's great
because you played them."

Freshman center Tess Picknell
will most likely go up against the 6-
foot-8 Griner in tonight's matchup.
Picknell played a solid game defen
sively against Santa Clara with one
blocked shot and four rebounds.
VanDerveer was impressed with
her aggressive screening and play
and is confident in Pieknell's ability

to help stop Griner.
The Card will also have to match
up with All-American point guard
Odyssey Sims who last year aver
aged 13.1 points per game and
three assists.
"We're going to do a lot of the
same things [from the Final Four],"
VanDerveer said. "We're going to
learn from the things that we did
last time and do a lot of the same
attack. Chiney is playing very well,
Joslyn is playing very well,
Amber's playing very well. We have
our 'big three' and we need it to be
four, five, six or seven. We need
really major contributions from a
lot of people."
With an 11-player rotation, it
will be interesting to see who steps
up for the Card in tonight's highly
anticipated matchup.

and as a collective group we need
to bring up our intensity and our
aggressiveness. We are going to
work so that doesn't happen
again."
And the Cardinal didn't let it
happen again. They played a com
pletely different game on Sunday
against Santa Clara, decisively
beating the Broncos 97-57.
The successful duo of
Ogwumike and senior Joslyn
Tinkle led the team in the opening
weekend series. Ogwumike aver
aged 22.5 points and 12 rebounds

on the weekend and scored her
I,oooth career point against Santa
Clara Tinkle averaged 19.5
points in the two contests.
The real player connection
made, however, was between soph
omore point guard Amber
Orrange and Ogwumike. Orrange
averaged 16 points and 5.5 assists
per game, most of which were con
verted by Ogwumike in the paint.
With first-game nerves out of
the way, and with a convincing win
under their belt, the Cardinal now
looks ahead to possibly their
toughest opponent of the season.
Stanford takes on top-ranked
Baylor tonight in Honolulu at the
Jack in the Box Rainbow Wahine
Classic.
"I'm getting goose bumps
thinking about it," Tinkle said.
"We're ready to play a great team
and great players."
This game will be a rematch of
last year's Final Four game in
which Baylor beat the Card 59-47,
largely in part due to the domi
nance of senior Brittney Griner.
Last season Griner was named
the AP National Player of the Year
after averaging 23.2 points, 9.5
rebounds and 5.2 blocks per game.
Griner put up 27 points against
No. 6 Kentucky in last week's 85-
51 Lady Bears victory.
"I think the fact that we played
them last year helps us this time
around, but it probably also helps
them too in that they know our
team a little bit better,"
VanDerveer said. "We always want
to play a very challenging schedule

Though all the attention will be on Chiney Ogwumike and Brittney
Griner in Friday's marquee matchup, junior guard Sara James (21) is
one player whose contributions could help turn the tide in Stanford's
favor when it faces an old Final Four nemesis, the Baylor Bears.
and we want to know early on what
we need to work on, areas where we
need to improve. Our team is excit
ed about it. It's not like you're going
to end your season with one game.
It'll be a game where we'll learn a
lot about ourselves and it's a win
win. If you win the game, great, and
if you don't win the game it's great
because you played them."

Freshman center Tess Picknell
will most likely go up against the 6-
foot-8 Griner in tonight's matchup.
Picknell played a solid game defen
sively against Santa Clara with one
blocked shot and four rebounds.
VanDerveer was impressed with
her aggressive screening and play
and is confident in Pieknell's ability

to help stop Griner.
The Card will also have to match
up with All-American point guard
Odyssey Sims who last year aver
aged 13.1 points per game and
three assists.
"We're going to do a lot of the
same things [from the Final Four],"
VanDerveer said. "We're going to
learn from the things that we did
last time and do a lot of the same
attack. Chiney is playing very well,
Joslyn is playing very well,
Amber's playing very well. We have
our 'big three' and we need it to be
four, five, six or seven. We need
really major contributions from a
lot of people."
With an 11-player rotation, it
will be interesting to see who steps
up for the Card in tonight's highly
anticipated matchup.

As Pac-12 Player of the Week
Chiney Ogwumike put it,
Stanford's narrow victory over
Fresno State last Friday night was
a "gut check" for the women's bas
ketball team, a test that hopefully
helped to prepare the Cardinal for
the much tougher competition it
faces tonight against No. 1 Baylor.
The season opener was no walk
in the park for Stanford. To put the
72-61 win in perspective, the Card
has beaten Fresno State by an
average margin of close to 30
points in the past several years.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
pointed out that defense and
rebounding were key struggles for
the Cardinal that need to be
resolved before the team faces
Baylor.
"Twenty-five offensive rebounds
[by Fresno State] is inexcusable for
anybody out there; that's hustle,"
Ogwumike said. "I know I made
mistakes, other people made mis
takes. I believe defense is all heart,
and as a collective group we need
to bring up our intensity and our
aggressiveness. We are going to
work so that doesn't happen
again."
