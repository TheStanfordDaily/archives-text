# INSTANT REPLAY
## Oregon and the zone read 
### â€“ Winston Shi 
Next Saturday, Stanford will play its biggest game of the season against Chip Kelly's Oregon Ducks
with a trip to the Pac-12 Championship Game on the line. The game will feature the nation's best run
offense and run defense going at it for four quarters. Stanford's top-ranked run defense (allowing just 2.02
yards per rush) will take on Kelly's spread option offensive attack (6.1 yards per rush).
The game will hinge on whether Stanford can stop Oregon's offense. Today we'll look at the Ducks'
bread-and-butter play, the inside zone read.

Oregon spreads its receivers across the field in order to force Stanford to play a six-man box. Assuming
that the defense keeps a safety deep and to do otherwise would be unthinkable against Oregon's
speedy backs and receivers Oregon should have a mathematical advantage at the line of scrimmage:
seven offensive players against the defense's six run players (W, M, S, E, T, and E).
The zone read allows Oregon to take maximum advantage of its extra man in the box. Oregon pur
posefully allows the defensive end (circled in blue) to go unblocked this is the core concept of option
football.
With two runners against one defensive player, Oregon simply sends the ball where the end is not. If
the end attacks the handoff, the guarterback can simply run around him, and if he gets past the end then
he has plenty of room to run (in blue). If the end keeps to the outside to contain the outside run, then the
quarterback hands off to the running back, and as Oregon's five offensive linemen are going against just
five defensive players (because they don't block the defensive end), the running back should have a wide
open running lane for a big play (in yellow). And if the defense tries to compensate for their numbers dis
advantage by bringing down the safety in run support, then the quarterback can simply throw a quick
screen pass (in red) to the three-receiver side that will go for a big play as well.
Oregon's offensive scheme is sound, and Stanford will have to physically win their battles at the line
of scrimmage so that Kelly's wizardry doesn't have the room to work. If Stanford can force Oregon to dou
ble team its defensive linemen long enough, the Cardinal should always have on unblocked linebacker
waiting to swallow up the run. In particular, defensive tackle Terrence Stephens will need to play the game
of his life. In addition, Stanford will need good safety play and the cornerbacks will have to fight through
Oregon's blocks to blow up the screen passes. Of course, all of this is easier said than done, and indeed
last Saturday Oregon shredded Cal 59-17.
