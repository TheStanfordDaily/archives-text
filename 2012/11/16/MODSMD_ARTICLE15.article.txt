## WHY THE DUCKS WILL WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
In part, two of a two-part
series, Miles Bennett-Smith
looks at Oregon's path to vic
tory.

Nike founder Phil Knight is an
alumnus of both the University of
Oregon and Stanford, but it's the
Ducks that have the flashier uni
formsâ€” and an all but unstop
pable offensive attack.
Maybe it's the painted wings
on the players' shoulder pads, but
whatever propels Oregon is cer
tainly working this season. The
stats are scary: The Ducks aver
age more points in the first half
than 87 FBS teams do in an entire
game, the Ducks have not trailed
past the first quarter and their
average halftime lead is 25.8
points, 7.4 points better than any
other FBS team.
According to ESPN's Stats
and Information team, if Oregon
continued its first-half pace in the
second half, the Ducks would
average 69.6 points and 712.8
yards per game. Those numbers
would crush the FBS records for
points (56.0 by Army in 1944) and
yards (624.9 by Houston in 1989)
per game in a season.
That should terrify Stanford
fans, especially because the last
two seasons the Cardinal has had
a front-row seat as Oregon rolled
past 50 points twice to derail
Stanford's Pac-12 title hopes in
20-point blowouts.
And this year the Ducks have
probably improved on offense.

Redshirt freshman quarterback
Marcus Mariota has put up
Heisman-worthy numbers the
past two games at USC and
California 47-of-57 passing,
681 yards, 10 touchdowns, no
interceptions and he has the
Cardinal's attention.
Stanford head coach David
Shaw acknowledged earlier in the
week that Mariota makes Oregon
more of a threat than Darron
Thomas did the past two years.
"I don't think there's any
question," Shaw said. "I know
they're already talking up there
that this kid is the best quarter
back they've ever had, at least in
this generation of football."
On tape Mariota is as good as
advertised, rarely making poor
reads and going through multiple
progressions before pulling the
ball down and using his speed to
rack up yards on the ground.
And while Stanford's defense
is clearly a threat to slow Oregon
down with heavy blitz packages
and one of the best pass rushes in
the country, Mariota might be
able to exploit penetration on the
edge by stepping up and scram
bling up the middle or checking
off to his backs or tight ends.
"We'll see," Mariota told the
Oregon Statesman. "I feel like we
have guys up front that can really
move the line of scrimmage."
That's not wishful thinking, as
the Ducks have three players
with over 500 yards rushing, led
by Kenjon Barner. A Heisman
candidate and likely finalist,
Earner has racked up 1360 net
yards on just 199 attempts (good
for a 6.8 net average) with 19 touch
downs. But the rest of the Ducks
have accounted for 21 rushing
touchdowns of their own.
As for Mariota's targets, they
are plentiful. All-everything
De' Anthony Thomas is a threat to
break the big one every time he
touches the ball, and leads the team
with 378 yards receiving. But the
Ducks aren't selfish five
receivers have over 200 yards
receiving and seven have more
than 175.
Perhaps more frustrating for
Stanford, however, is the Ducks'
propensity to spread the Cardinal
out in its zone-read offense and
dink and dunk their way through
missed tackles in the secondary.
This has plagued Stanford for the
last several seasons against
Oregon, particularly in the second
half as the Cardinal defense tires.
Almost all of Oregon's receivers
are very good downfield blockers, a
fundamental in Chip Kelly's offen
sive schemes that aim to create
mismatches and exploit team speed
at the second level.
It makes for a tough matchup
for any team. Sell out to stop
Earner and company in the run
game, and Mariota might burn you
on the outside with Thomas or Josh
Huff anyway; sit on the outside
routes and Barner might torch you
for 300 yards, as he did against
use.
Oregon's defense is banged up,
yes, but Stanford is starting a
freshman quarterback in his first
road game. (I love you Colorado,
but you honestly should not be in
Division I this season.) And the

Cardinal struggled to score in road
games against Washington and at
home against San Jose State and a
Washington State team that is
barely better than the Buffaloes.
"It's gonna be a challenge
regardless of (injuries)," said
Oregon linebacker Michael Clay.

"They're a really good team."
Clay and his teammates are
saying all the right things this
week, but do the Ducks believe
them? According to ESPN Stats
and Info, Stanford is one of five
teams that has not allowed a touch
down in less than a minute against

an FBS opponent and the only
team that has not allowed a touch
down in three plays or fewer.
But can that hold up against the
neon green lightning strikes of
Oregon? Conventional wisdom says
no, Las Vegas says no and if either
of them is close to being correct,

the Ducks will be walking out of
Autzen on Saturday night just two
games from playing for a national
championship.

Senior running back Stepfan Taylor is just 202 yards from catching Darrin Nelson at the top of Stanford's all-time rushing leaderboard, but he
has his sights set on a much tougher task this weekend. Extended drives led by Taylor would be an integral part of any potential Cardinal upset.
