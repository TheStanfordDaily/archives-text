## WHY THE DUCKS WILL WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
In part, two of a two-part
series, Miles Bennett-Smith
looks at Oregon's path to vic
tory.

Nike founder Phil Knight is an
alumnus of both the University of
Oregon and Stanford, but it's the
Ducks that have the flashier uni
formsâ€” and an all but unstop
pable offensive attack.
Maybe it's the painted wings
on the players' shoulder pads, but
whatever propels Oregon is cer
tainly working this season. The
stats are scary: The Ducks aver
age more points in the first half
than 87 FBS teams do in an entire
game, the Ducks have not trailed
past the first quarter and their
average halftime lead is 25.8
points, 7.4 points better than any
other FBS team.
According to ESPN's Stats
and Information team, if Oregon
continued its first-half pace in the
second half, the Ducks would
average 69.6 points and 712.8
yards per game. Those numbers
would crush the FBS records for
points (56.0 by Army in 1944) and
yards (624.9 by Houston in 1989)
per game in a season.
That should terrify Stanford
fans, especially because the last
two seasons the Cardinal has had
a front-row seat as Oregon rolled
past 50 points twice to derail
Stanford's Pac-12 title hopes in
20-point blowouts.
And this year the Ducks have
probably improved on offense.

Redshirt freshman quarterback
Marcus Mariota has put up
Heisman-worthy numbers the
past two games at USC and
California 47-of-57 passing,
681 yards, 10 touchdowns, no
interceptions and he has the
Cardinal's attention.
Stanford head coach David
Shaw acknowledged earlier in the
week that Mariota makes Oregon
more of a threat than Darron
Thomas did the past two years.
"I don't think there's any
question," Shaw said. "I know
they're already talking up there
that this kid is the best quarter
back they've ever had, at least in
this generation of football."
On tape Mariota is as good as
advertised, rarely making poor
reads and going through multiple
progressions before pulling the
ball down and using his speed to
rack up yards on the ground.
And while Stanford's defense
is clearly a threat to slow Oregon
down with heavy blitz packages
and one of the best pass rushes in
the country, Mariota might be
able to exploit penetration on the
edge by stepping up and scram
bling up the middle or checking
off to his backs or tight ends.
"We'll see," Mariota told the
Oregon Statesman. "I feel like we
have guys up front that can really
move the line of scrimmage."
That's not wishful thinking, as
the Ducks have three players
with over 500 yards rushing, led
by Kenjon Barner. A Heisman
