## BRONCOS LOOK TO UPSET REPEAT BID 
### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With their fourth consecutive Pac-12 con
ference title and fourth consecutive appear
ance in the NCAA national tournament, the
defending NCAA champion women's soccer
team is poised to make yet another title run.
After easily advancing into the Round of 16,
No. 1 Stanford's path is blocked by the 17th
ranked Santa Clara Broncos. Stanford faces
off against the Broncos in a second round
matchup tonight at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium
at 7 p.m.
As easy as it is to disregard the Santa
Clara game and begin speculating about
tougher potential matches down the road to

the College Cup, which will be held on Dec. 2
at Torero Stadium in San Diego, the Cardinal
says the need to focus on the here and now of
the tournament.
"Every year is different and I think we
know that we have to show up from the start
against any team," said senior captain
Rachel Quon.
The assumption of an easy win could cost
the Cardinal the game. The Broncos can and
will punish a slow start by the Cardinal, con
sidering that they have recorded 163 shots
on goal compared to only 109 for them vari
ous opponents. The depth of the San Clara
team, evidenced by the fact that a total of 11
Broncos players have at least one
goal, can provide fresh legs off the
bench. The Broncos are more than
deserving of a second glance by the
Cardinal; they have collected 172
corner kicks to their opponents' 107
and have outscored their opponents
36-24.

The Cardinal, though, has
outscored its opponents 52-12 this
season. Stanford suffered its only
loss of the season to West Virginia in
August, and its season-opening win
against Santa Clara on Aug. 17 was
a game in which two of the Broncos'
leading scorers, Sofia Huerta and
Julie Johnson, did not play.
Johnson, part of U.S. team that won
the under-20 women's World Cup in
September, leads the team in scor
ing with eight goals and five assists.
The Broncos-Cardinal rivalry,
once a close and competitive
matchup between two offensively
oriented teams, has been dominated
by Stanford in the last seven years.
In the teams' encounter this season,
Stanford came back from a 1-0
deficit at halftime to score six sec
ond-half goals against Santa Clara.
As a result, emotion is expected to
run through all 90 minutes; the
Broncos will surely come crashing
out of the gates, full of energy and
vengeance, to take down the No. 1
team tonight.
Jerry Smith, the Broncos' head
coach, emphasized the advanta
geous speed and agility of Stanford.
"When you play a number-one
team like Stanford I think every
thing has to go well for you," he
said.
The game will at least in part
depend on Stanford's ability to cap
italize on Santa Clara's mistakes
and recover quickly after turnovers,
especially considering the threat of
Santa Clara's big, physical for
wards.
Stanford's defensive wall is defi
nitely a strong suit, led by a strong

group of seniors including captain
and central defender Alina
Garciamendez. Cardinal keepers
Emily Oliver and Aly Gleason are
both extremely reliable in the net,
boasting better than .800 save per
centages.
While Santa Clara is coming off a
close, 2-1 win against Long Beach
State, Stanford cruised in its first
round win over Idaho State, a 3-0 vic
tory.

"I think any time we put one in
early on in the game, our confidence
throughout the game is higher and
we are able to settle in to the way we
really like to play," said sophomore
forward Alex Doll of her goal in the
first minutes of the against Idaho
State. The best way for the Cardinal
to ensure its passage into the third

round would be to score first on
Friday, confirmed by Stanford's 149-
match unbeaten streak when it
scores the first goal.
The vaunted possession-oriented
style of the Stanford team will defi
nitely provide a challenge for Santa
Clara.

"We can keep the ball for large
strands at a time, and that often
tires the other team out," Doll said.
Although Stanford is trying to
not look too far ahead, a win this
Friday would put them through to a
third-round game against either
Maryland or Denver, depending on
the rest of the night's results.

Junior goalkeeper Emily Oliver (above) was a clutch performer for
Stanford in last year's national title run, and as the Cardinal enters the
second round of the postseason she will continue to be a factor in net.
