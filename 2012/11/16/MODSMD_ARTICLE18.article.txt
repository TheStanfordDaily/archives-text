# STREAK SNAPPED AT 22
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The last time the Stanford
women's volleyball team lost a
match, Stanford was not close to
being in session and Barack Obama
and Mitt Romney were a month
away from their first presidential
debate. Thursday night in Los
Angeles, Cardinal's incredible 22-
game winning streak came to an
end at the hands of No. 8 USC, 3-1.

During No. 1 Stanford's domi
nant stretch, the Cardinal (24-3,16-
1 Pac-12) had made a habit of start
ing slow and finishing strong, blow
ing teams out of the water during the
second half of most sets. As USC (25-
4,13-4) grabbed an early lead, signs
pointed towards the Cardinal mak
ing a quick comeback.
Down 12-8 in the opening set
Stanford started to do just that,
going on a 5-1 ran that briefly tied
the game at 13 apiece. The Trojans
rallied back, however, earning three
straight points and putting the
Cardinal in a hole it would be unable
to climb out of. Backed by six kills
from freshman outsider hitter
Samantha Bricio and five from sen
ior opposite Katie Riller, USC was
able to pull out a 25-19 victory.
The second set was entirely baek
and-forth, as the teams exchanged
blows without either managing to
gain an advantage over the other.
With USC up 21-20 late in the set the
Trojans finally erupted. Fhller post
ed back-to-back kills, leading the

Trojans on a 4-0 run and giving them
a 25-21 second set victory.
Knowing that it needed a third
set victory to have a chance of keep
ing its streak running, Stanford
came out after the break with
absolute intensity. Unfortunately for
Cardinal fans, the Trojans refused to
quit, matching Stanford blow-for
blow.
Neither team was able to gain
more than a three-point lead, trad
ing blows left and right. With
Stanford down 26-27 and on the
verge of defeat, the Cardinal finally
took off. Freshman outside hitters
Jordan Burgess and Brittany
Howard recorded back-to-back kills,
and freshman middle blocker Inky
Ajanaku was able to put the Trojans
away, giving Stanford the 29-27 set
victory.
The fourth set was again do-or
die for the Cardinal, and again
incredibly even. With the score tied
at 21, Bricio put it on herself to end
Stanford's streak. The freshman
recorded three kills in the next six
points, helping the Trojans to a 25-22
set win and four set victory.

Bricio would finish with a match
high 19 kills as well as 22 digs. Trojan
libero Natalie Hagglund added an
incredible defensive effort, posting
44 digs and consistently frustrating
the Stanford attackers, holding them
to .187 hitting for the match.
The Stanford defense put forth
its usual incredible effort, however,
causing the Trojans to hit just .250.
Sophomore libero Kyle Gilbert post
ed 32 digs, while Burgess had 25 digs
and three blocks to go along with her
15 kills.
Howard, fresh off winning Pac-12
Defensive Player of the Week and
her second straight freshman-of-the
week honors, had another strong
effort with 15 kills and 22 digs.
While it was a disappointing loss
for the Cardinal, Stanford still sits in
first in the Pac-12, with a two-game
lead over Oregon and three games to
play. The Cardinal will face No. 5
UCLA in Los Angeles tomorrow
night in the hopes of stalling a new
streak.

Howard, fresh off winning Pac-12
Defensive Player of the Week and
her second straight freshman-of-the
week honors, had another strong
effort with 15 kills and 22 digs.
While it was a disappointing loss
for the Cardinal, Stanford still sits in
first in the Pac-12, with a two-game
lead over Oregon and three games to
play. The Cardinal will face No. 5
UCLA in Los Angeles tomorrow
night in the hopes of stalling a new
streak.
