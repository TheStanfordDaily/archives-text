## Pac-12 North on the line as Stanford visits No.2 Oregon 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Some sports rivalries are helplessly
lopsided. Tom Brady faltered in the
face of the New York Giants in both
Super Bowls. Navy has fallen to
Notre Dame in 71 out of the 84 foot
ball games that they've played against each
other. The Boston Red Sox lived in the
giant, inescapable shadow of the New York
Yankees for 86 years. Matt Barkley hasn't
beaten Stanford, period.
Add one more to the list: Stanford
couldn't defeat Oregon when it mattered
not yet, at least.
Firmly ingrained in the minds of
Stanford fans is the fact that the Cardinal
has lost to the Ducks in eight of their last nine
meetings. But it's the most recent losses and the
manner in which those losses happened that have
hurt the most.
Two years ago, Stanford jumped out to an early 21-3
lead in Autzen before Oregon stormed back to hand the
Cardinal its only misstep of the season. In between
screaming his head off and standing dumbfounded on
the sideline, coach Jim Harbaugh helplessly watched
his offense getting victimized by Chip Kelley's
defense in the second half. The sole loss was
enough to keep Stanford from the conference
title and a Rose Bowl berth.
Then came Andrew Luck's shot at
redemption. Surely the best quarterback in
college football was going to lead the team
past the pesky Ducks en route to a national
championship. Surely LaMichael James
could not run rampant on the Cardinal

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 45, OREGON 42: Every week
this season, I have sat down to make my prediction
with mind already made up to pick Stanford. Some
people might call this irresponsible homerism on the
surface, but I would challenge any of you to break
down a game this season in which the Cardinal was
not the better team on paper and should not have at
least been a slight favorite to win. Saturday night, that
is not the case. Saturday night, the Ducks will fly
around the field and rack up points in the coolest
looking uniforms in college football. Saturday night,
the Autzen crowd will be rocking in the rain. Saturday
night, Chip Kelly will control the video-game Oregon
offense like he's Rex Ryan at home on a Sunday
night frantically trying to boost Mark Sanchez's attrib
utes on Madden. And Saturday night, Stanford will
win. I know I'm probably wrong, and while I have
plenty of objective reasons to think the Ducks will win
this game nine out of 10 times, I'm saying that this is
the one time they don't. There's no cheering in the
press box, but this is the Catalina-fucking-wine-mixer
of my college football career. Go, Stanford.
SAM FISHER
STANFORD 35, OREGON 50: I really
want to pick Stanford in this game. Heck, if we
were picking against the point spread, I'd be all
over it. I've picked Stanford to win every game this
year, and for the most part, the Card has made me
look good. However, this week it comes to an end.
I just can't pick against the 2012 Ducks. Kenjon
Barner and De' Anthony Thomas have been as
good as advertised, but the key to my pick is
Marcus Mariota. I just don't think Stanford can stop
a team that has looked so good on the ground and
through the air. Stanford will surprise people by
hanging around, but in the third quarter, you'll see
a mistake. It might be an interception, a fumble, or
just a missed tackle, but it will give Oregon a two
score lead, and the Ducks won't look back.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, OREGON 42: I've tried to
find every conceivable way of how Stanford might be
able to pull off the upset tomorrow in Autzen. But
truth is, I can't. Marcus Mariota is quickly becoming
one of the best quarterbacks in college football.
Kenjon Barner has a knack for finding the smallest
holes and bursting through them for a 75-yard touch
down. De' Anthony Thomas is the fastest player in
college football and it's not even close. What else
needs to be said? But that doesn't take way from the
fact that the Cardinal will go down with a valiant
effort. Kevin Hogan might not be able to lead his
offense into the end zone as many times as Mariota
does, but he'll be able to keep this game relatively
close. Stepfan Taylor should have over 150 rushing
yards and a pair of touchdowns while Zach Ertz will
have over 100 receiving yards. If Stanford can keep
this game within two touchdowns and then beat
UCLA next weekend, a Rose Bowl berth is still very
much possible.

Sophomore safety Jordan Richards will be
a huge factor in the secondary for Stanford
when it faces Oregon's Marcus Mariota.
