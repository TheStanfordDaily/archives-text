## Pac-12 North on the line as Stanford visits No.2 Oregon 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Some sports rivalries are helplessly
lopsided. Tom Brady faltered in the
face of the New York Giants in both
Super Bowls. Navy has fallen to
Notre Dame in 71 out of the 84 foot
ball games that they've played against each
other. The Boston Red Sox lived in the
giant, inescapable shadow of the New York
Yankees for 86 years. Matt Barkley hasn't
beaten Stanford, period.
Add one more to the list: Stanford
couldn't defeat Oregon when it mattered
not yet, at least.
Firmly ingrained in the minds of
Stanford fans is the fact that the Cardinal
has lost to the Ducks in eight of their last nine
meetings. But it's the most recent losses and the
manner in which those losses happened that have
hurt the most.
Two years ago, Stanford jumped out to an early 21-3
lead in Autzen before Oregon stormed back to hand the
Cardinal its only misstep of the season. In between
screaming his head off and standing dumbfounded on
the sideline, coach Jim Harbaugh helplessly watched
his offense getting victimized by Chip Kelley's
defense in the second half. The sole loss was
enough to keep Stanford from the conference
title and a Rose Bowl berth.
Then came Andrew Luck's shot at
redemption. Surely the best quarterback in
college football was going to lead the team
past the pesky Ducks en route to a national
championship. Surely LaMichael James
could not run rampant on the Cardinal

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 45, OREGON 42: Every week
this season, I have sat down to make my prediction
with mind already made up to pick Stanford. Some
people might call this irresponsible homerism on the
surface, but I would challenge any of you to break
down a game this season in which the Cardinal was
not the better team on paper and should not have at
least been a slight favorite to win. Saturday night, that
is not the case. Saturday night, the Ducks will fly
around the field and rack up points in the coolest
looking uniforms in college football. Saturday night,
the Autzen crowd will be rocking in the rain. Saturday
night, Chip Kelly will control the video-game Oregon
offense like he's Rex Ryan at home on a Sunday
night frantically trying to boost Mark Sanchez's attrib
utes on Madden. And Saturday night, Stanford will
win. I know I'm probably wrong, and while I have
plenty of objective reasons to think the Ducks will win
this game nine out of 10 times, I'm saying that this is
the one time they don't. There's no cheering in the
press box, but this is the Catalina-fucking-wine-mixer
of my college football career. Go, Stanford.
SAM FISHER
STANFORD 35, OREGON 50: I really
want to pick Stanford in this game. Heck, if we
were picking against the point spread, I'd be all
over it. I've picked Stanford to win every game this
year, and for the most part, the Card has made me
look good. However, this week it comes to an end.
I just can't pick against the 2012 Ducks. Kenjon
Barner and De' Anthony Thomas have been as
good as advertised, but the key to my pick is
Marcus Mariota. I just don't think Stanford can stop
a team that has looked so good on the ground and
through the air. Stanford will surprise people by
hanging around, but in the third quarter, you'll see
a mistake. It might be an interception, a fumble, or
just a missed tackle, but it will give Oregon a two
score lead, and the Ducks won't look back.
GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 31, OREGON 42: I've tried to
find every conceivable way of how Stanford might be
able to pull off the upset tomorrow in Autzen. But
truth is, I can't. Marcus Mariota is quickly becoming
one of the best quarterbacks in college football.
Kenjon Barner has a knack for finding the smallest
holes and bursting through them for a 75-yard touch
down. De' Anthony Thomas is the fastest player in
college football and it's not even close. What else
needs to be said? But that doesn't take way from the
fact that the Cardinal will go down with a valiant
effort. Kevin Hogan might not be able to lead his
offense into the end zone as many times as Mariota
does, but he'll be able to keep this game relatively
close. Stepfan Taylor should have over 150 rushing
yards and a pair of touchdowns while Zach Ertz will
have over 100 receiving yards. If Stanford can keep
this game within two touchdowns and then beat
UCLA next weekend, a Rose Bowl berth is still very
much possible.

son. Surely it was supposed to be
Stanford's year.
Only it wasn't. After throwing his
nail-in-the-coffin fourth-quarter
interception, Luck slowly trotted off
the muddy field, knowing that the
national championship trophy would
never be in his hands.
♦ ♦♦
With just about everything on
the line from conference title
implications to Rose Bowl aspira
tions to Oregon's national champi
onship hopes three-touchdown
underdog No. 13 Stanford (8-2, 6-1
Pac-12) hopes to knock off No. 2
Oregon (10-0, 7-0) tomorrow night.
As if the game didn't have enough of
a David-Goliath feel to it, the
Cardinal will have to pull off the
upset in Autzen, where the crowd
noise can grow so loud that the pel
lets on the turf start to shake.
"This is a different Oregon team
now," said head coach David Shaw.
"These guys are special, and I agree
with what most people outside the
computers say: This is the best team
in the country. And it's going to take
our best game and not their best
game to pull this thing off."
Unstoppable, intimidating and
deadly are all words synonymous
with Oregon's offense. The combina
tion of breakneck speed and perfect
execution has propelled the Ducks
to near the top in almost every
offense statistic first in the nation
in points scored (54.8 per game),
first in yards per rush (6.1), third in
total offense (562.6 yeards per
game), third in rushing yards (325.1
per game) and third in number of
first downs (28.9 per game).
"We don't talk about stopping
[Oregon]; we talk about slowing them
down," Shaw said. "You can hold
them down for a while, but eventually
they're going to crack a couple on you
... Our job is to limit the big plays,
limit them to four to five yards at a

time, don't give them the huge pass or
the huge run and then we've got to
score points on offense."
"[Oregon does] this thing where
they play close for a half and they
just take off," said nose guard
Terrence Stephens. "It's going to
take our best game to win."
Leading Oregon's vaunted
ground game is the speedy Kenjon
Barner, whose 1,360 rushing yards
and 20 touchdowns have placed him
squarely in the Heisman conversa
tion.

Sophomore De' Anthony
Thomas, heralded by many as the
fastest player in college football, has
not seen as many carries as Barner
this season, but his all-around explo
siveness makes viewers hold their
breaths every time he touches the
ball.

That being said, the duo of
Barner and Thomas will face the
best defense it has played against in
2012 tomorrow. Stanford's dominant
front seven leads the country in run
defense (58.6 yards per game), sacks
(4.3 per game) and tackles for loss
(9.1). Boasting one of the nation's
best linebacker corps in terms of tal
ent and depth, the Cardinal allowed

its opponent to score over 20 points
in only two games this season.
The Cardinal defensive line must
consistently penetrate up the mid
dle if it hopes to slow down the
Ducks' fast-paced running game.
"A lot of people will attempt to
play side-to-side, and that's' where
you'll get gassed because [football]
is not a horizontal game," Stephens
said. "They want to hit you vertical
ly and score points. It's important
for us to get penetration and disrupt
that timing. Defensively that's what
it'll come down to."

While Barner shined against
USC three weeks ago, it's star quar
terback Marcus Mariota who has
recently garnered attention. The
redshirt freshman has emerged as
one of the best quarterbacks in the
nation; ranked first in the country in
efficiency, Mariota carries a 176.96
quarterback rating and a 70.1 com
pletion percentage.
The young signal-caller has been
seemingly unflappable all season.
Just last weekend, he appeared to
have injured his left shoulder in the
first quarter, but came back in on
the next drive and eventually threw
six touchdowns in Oregon's 59-17
blowout victory over Cal.
Shaw agrees with the sentiment
of many Oregon fans, stating on
Tuesday that "there's no question"
that Mariota is a better quarterback
than his predecessor, Darren
Thomas.
The Stanford defense under
stands how important it is to get to
Mariota early and often.
"You've got to take a shot at the
quarterback when given the oppor
tunity," said outside linebacker
Chase Thomas. "Every hit adds up
and wears on him by the time the
game's over."
With Oregon's reputation as a
merciless scoring machine, it's all
the more important for the
Cardinal's offense to put up as many

points on the board as it can and
protect the ball from a Ducks
defense that has been underrated
for its ability to create turnovers.
"I always feel pressure to score a
lot of points, but especially in this
game," said senior center Sam
Schwartzstein. "We do feel [pres
sure] because if we're ahead or
behind, their offense can score at
any moment. But we have the best
defense in the nation, so we have to
answer every stop with a touch
down."
Quarterback Kevin Hogan will
be making his first start on the road
in Autzen, of all places. Despite
throwing two interceptions against a
stout Oregon State defense last
Saturday, Hogan moved the offense
efficiently down the field for at least
two quarters and also engineered
the game-winning drive.
"[Hogan] has shown absolutely
zero nervousness, anxiousness, or
apprehension," Shaw said. "I don't
anticipate him taking any different
approach."

While the redshirt freshman will
have to play even better against the
Ducks, Shaw emphasizes the impor
tance of not trying to do too much.
"You've got to be aggressive, but
not enough to leave yourself vulner
able," Shaw said. "The moment the
offense thinks it has to do something
special and gets out of character, the
lead goes from 14 to 28 so fast. You
have to know what you're good at,
and stick to what you're good at."
There are not many things

Stanford can take comfort in going
up against Oregon, but the Ducks
are precariously thin and battered
on defense. Free safety Avery
Patterson is reportedly out for the
season while three defensive line
men Dion Jordan, Isaac
Remington and Ricky Heimuli
sat out against Cal. Backup corner
Dior Matthis and Troy Hill also did
not play against the Bears, and
Oregon's lack of depth might
explain why De' Anthony Thomas
was taking reps at defensive back in
practice this week.
Senior running back Stepfan
Taylor looks to capitalize on those
injuries. Coming off a brilliant per
formance against the Beavers, the
Doak Walker semifinalist needs 202
more yards to surpass Darrin
Nelson as the all-time Stanford
rushing leader.
The players don't need to be told
twice what's at stake tomorrow.

"It's one of those reason you
came to play college football at a
big-time school," Schwartzstein
said. "It's one of those things you
dream about growing up. I think
everybody's got that feeling right
now, that it's going to be of those
games they'll remember forever."
Stanford hopes to spoil Oregon's
national title hopes this Saturday at
Autzen Stadium. Kickoff is slated
for 5 p.m. PDT, with national televi
sion coverage on ABC.
