# FARM FASHION:
## CAP SERIES Head of the Class 
### Roxanna Reaves | FELLOW 
Here at Stanford, students not only care about what goes in their heads, but what
goes on their heads, too. There are a wide variety of trendy hats, caps and helmets
on this campus that can be pretty telling of the wearer. Is she the tea-drinking hip
pie type? Does he enjoy listening to jazz? Use your cabeza to spot the hidden meaning
behind that snazzy sombrero.

The hipster helmet
Safety is sexy ... and also trendy? It wouldn't be Stanford if
the students didn't flaunt their individual style while embracing
the practical precautionary headgear too. The whimsical water
melon helmet says, "I'm safe but saucy too." The type of charac
ters who don this variety of headwear are quirky, free-spirited
people who never seem too concerned with the inevitable hat
hair. Instead, they're too busy making some other mundane thing
in life exciting.
The casual Stanford cap
It's Sunday. You're suffering from more than the typical
morning fatigue, you haven't showered since before the football
game yesterday morning and you're not exacdy sure where you
parked your bike last night. It's time to don the Stanford cap and
prepare yourself for the week ahead. This classic is seen most fre
quently around campus partly as a display of campus pride
and pardy as a lazy way to hide messy hair. While it's encouraging
to see a sea of Cardinal spirit, the Stanford cap is more useful for

staying hidden than being seen.
The thrift store gem

As Mack thoughtfully sang, "Oneman's
trash, that's another man's come up." These
caps sure are up-and-coming these days
all around campus students can be spotted
rocking the slightly faded (yet delightfully
psychedelic) patterned hats. Frugal and fash
ionable, secondhand headwear like a bright
floral flat brim is perfect for cash-strapped

college students. However, consignment stores
Goodwill Boutique, Savers and The Shop are all
at least 10 minutes away from campus, so indi
viduals who wear these nifty hats probably have
access to a car. Good to know if you ever want to
go with them to get some well-priced apparel
yourself.

The flashy fedora
' If you watch "White Collar" or "Mad Men," you know
how just how fed-orable this classy headpiece can be. Paired
with the right tailored suit, a fedora can be perfectly retro
chic. Brave men at themed parties often take a swing at
rocking the fedora, just to experiment with this difficult-to
pull-off look. But, generally, stylish musicians whose hip
rocker vibes are accented by this popular felt hat best
i achieve this look.
r
Ihe funky headband
It's all the rage just ask Dwight Howard and his band of
instafollowers. Since switching to the Lakers, the basketballer
clearly took after Stanford students' lead and started sporting
| the popular accessory. Men and women alike adorn their big
brains with headbands of all colors and designs. Like the
trendy helmets, headbands serve both the utilitarian purpose
of pushing back hair and the aesthetic purpose of being
really cool and stylish.
