## HOLLY HERNDON Stanford's newest ingenue muses over "Movement" 
### Tom Schmidt | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you're tired of the
electronic music scene
at Stanford, try stepping
up from the romaine that
is brostep and progressive
house music to the kale
that is Holly Herndon's new
album "Movement."

Herndon, a Ph.D student in electronic music here at
Stanford, has spent the last five years in the Berlin music scene.
Originally from Tennessee, the fire-haired experimentalist honed
the academic side of her musical talents by earning an MFA in
Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College, an
impressive program that has produced such musical greats as
Steve Reich and Joanna Newsom.
"Movement," which has earned Herndon coverage in NPR
and Pitchfork, sits at the intersection of her avant-garde academic
work and the pulsing house beats popular in Berlin clubs, creating
something completely unlike anything you've ever heard.
INTERMISSION: How did you get into the club scene in Berlin
from Tennessee? That seems like a large jump.
HERNDON: I was an exchange student in high school, so that
was probably the big thing. I spoke German in high school, lived
with a family in Berlin, fell in love with a German club kid and I

guess the rest is history.

INT: Why come to Stanford after Mills
instead of going into the industry, and why
Stanford over someplace else?
HH: I really like the idea of being able to
work on music all the time and not have to
divide my time between something that pays
my bills and something that's my passion.
The access to resources here, the Stanford
"brain trust," the crazy equipment they have
at CCRMA [Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics] are amazing! I
wouldn't have access to these kinds of things
if I were just an artist that was touring all the

time. I wanted a technical boot camp with engineers that would
be kicking my butt and forcing me to improve.
INT: So, your album out today (Nov. 13), "Movement" not a
New Order reference, right?
HH: [laugh s] No, sorry.
INT: Sorry, had to ask. What was your inspiration for this album?
What sort of artists or genres were you listening to?
HH: Well, I would say my iTunes library is pretty diverse. I listen
to new music, dance music, etc., and that's always playing in our
house. For me, that's just normal to jump from genre to genre. I
wasn't thinking "I want to make this genre piece" or "I want to
make this genre piece". It's just kind of the soundtrack to contem
porary life.
I think most people are doing this though. They're clicking
around on You Tube or other things on their computer, and things
are coming from different directions, so they're not always just
one pace. I think it's fine to do albums this way. This one was
about bringing all my interests together in one place and not
apologizing about any of them, because I think I've done some of

that in the past.
INT: On your album, you have a tendency to use a lot of vocal
samples, but there weren't any discernible lyrics from what I could
hear. What was your idea behind that?
HH: I don't think that was a conscious choice that I made. It's
funny, I heard someone ask if I'm insecure about my lyrics or if
I'm hiding behind them. Maybe that's true. I don't know. For me,
this album was about vocal processing and vocal manipulation
and removing prose from the center, shifting focus toward sound
and texture and voice.
You don't have your synthesizer talking to you or telling you
something. So, I kind of wanted it to be more like an instrument
in that way. But of course, you still need phonemes or something
to work with, so I would usually just record myself saying non
sense, catch my sound at particular points and edit to make some
thing that made sense in English. But sometimes I wouldn't.
INT: On this same note, there seems to be a lot of breathing sam-

pling. Was this a conscious
choice, or is this just some
thing that came out of the cre
ative process?
HH: Yeah, it was a conscious
choice. I didn't just accidental
ly breathe in to the mic! With
"Breathe," the idea was how I
could take a really simple
input and kind of stretch it or
digitally manipulate it into a
larger sonic world. It's also this
idea of having a relationship
with your computer. Sort of a
personal, intimate thing where
you're breathing into the com
puter and it's breathing out at
you with this digital splatter.
INT: What about the intro to
"Terminal"? Isn't that breath
ing?
HH: That's actually synthe
sized. That's funny, I don't
think anyone has made that
comparison before. You know,
I was playing at a club in
Berlin and it was a really bad
fit. Katerholzig, it's kind of a
touristy place. It wasn't the
right evening for me to be
there and there were these
tourists there who, when I
started playing that, said
something like "I think the air
conditioner is broken!"
[laughs] I thought that was
hilarious.
INT: Some other articles por
tray you as a vocal proponent
of laptop-driven music. Do
you think you miss anything
without a hardware or analog
component?
HH: I don't think that laptop
alone has to be the future, just
as we still have baroque
instruments and baroque
ensembles, but I do think that
the laptop is the most capable
instrument we have right now.
I was listening to a talk at
CCRMA the other day by
John Chowning and he said in
the 70s, he wrote this piece
"Stria" and he was shifting
around the parcels to create
these new timbres that had
never been heard before, and
he said that at some moment
he realized that the computer
as an instrument was the
future. It was really powerful
to hear the guy who discov
ered digital synthesis say that.
I just think computers are

more capable than anything
else we have access to. I'm not
an absolutist. You don't have
to shit on drum machines, but
I would just prefer to develop
laptops. I actually use an 808
on one of the tracks.
INT: As far as trends in the
industry go, it seems like
there's a democratization of
electronic music right now,
where kids can just download
a copy of FL Studio or
Ableton, plug in the presets,
and be making their own
house music in a week....
How do you feel about this?
HH: I think it's awesome.
There was a time before
recording when everyone was
making music by themselves,
and it was just done of the
pure joy of making music. If
we are moving back towards
that, that's great. I think
because more people are mak
ing music, music will get bet
ter.
Of course there's going to
be a lot to sift through, but I
don't think the overall quality
of music will go down. Ge
Wang, one of the professors at
CCRMA, is the founder of
Smule. One of their main
things is getting people to play
music collaboratively over
networks and I think that's
really interesting and positive.
Why not create a new para
digm where people are
involved with the music they
consume? [laughs] I don't feel
threatened, if that's what you
mean.
INT: As far your future goes,
do you plan on staying acade
mia with this sort of commu
nity, or do you think you're
going to go into the industry
or tour?
HH: That's a really tough
question and I don't have the
answer right now. I just start
ed and it's a five-year pro
gram. I just want to spend the
next five years writing as
much music as possible and
researching and making cool
things. I don't even know
what all the options are yet,
but I've never had an issue
finding a job or making my
skills applicable to other fields.

Wang, one of the professors at

Why not create a new para

involved with the music they
consume? [laughs] I don't feel

mean.
INT: As far your future goes,
do you plan on staying acade

nity, or do you think you're
going to go into the industry
or tour?
HH: That's a really tough
question and I don't have the
answer right now. I just start

gram. I just want to spend the
next five years writing as
much music as possible and
researching and making cool

finding a job or making my

If you're tired of the
electronic music scene
at Stanford, try stepping
up from the romaine that
is brostep and progressive
house music to the kale
that is Holly Herndon's new
album "Movement."

Herndon, a Ph.D student in electronic music here at
Stanford, has spent the last five years in the Berlin music scene.
Originally from Tennessee, the fire-haired experimentalist honed
the academic side of her musical talents by earning an MFA in
Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College, an
impressive program that has produced such musical greats as
Steve Reich and Joanna Newsom.
"Movement," which has earned Herndon coverage in NPR
and Pitchfork, sits at the intersection of her avant-garde academic
work and the pulsing house beats popular in Berlin clubs, creating
something completely unlike anything you've ever heard.
INTERMISSION: How did you get into the club scene in Berlin
from Tennessee? That seems like a large jump.
HERNDON: I was an exchange student in high school, so that
was probably the big thing. I spoke German in high school, lived
with a family in Berlin, fell in love with a German club kid and I

guess the rest is history.

INT: Why come to Stanford after Mills
instead of going into the industry, and why
Stanford over someplace else?
HH: I really like the idea of being able to
work on music all the time and not have to
divide my time between something that pays
my bills and something that's my passion.
The access to resources here, the Stanford
"brain trust," the crazy equipment they have
at CCRMA [Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics] are amazing! I
wouldn't have access to these kinds of things
if I were just an artist that was touring all the

-11 " "" vxxvxx,x VXXVXV —U XV, XXX XX x & xxxx xxxx.
time. I wanted a technical boot camp with engineers that would
be kicking my butt and forcing me to improve.
INT: So, your album out today (Nov. 13), "Movement" not a
New Order reference, right?
HH: [laugh s] No, sorry.
INT: Sorry, had to ask. What was your inspiration for this album?
What sort of artists or genres were you listening to?
HH: Well, I would say my iTunes library is pretty diverse. I listen
to new music, dance music, etc., and that's always playing in our
house. For me, that's just normal to jump from genre to genre. I
wasn't thinking "I want to make this genre piece" or "I want to
make this genre piece". It's just kind of the soundtrack to contem
porary life.
I think most people are doing this though. They're clicking
around on You Tube or other things on their computer, and things
are coming from different directions, so they're not always just
one pace. I think it's fine to do albums this way. This one was
about bringing all my interests together in one place and not
apologizing about any of them, because I think I've done some of

that in the past.
INT: On your album, you have a tendency to use a lot of vocal
samples, but there weren't any discernible lyrics from what I could
hear. What was your idea behind that?
HH: I don't think that was a conscious choice that I made. It's
funny, I heard someone ask if I'm insecure about my lyrics or if
I'm hiding behind them. Maybe that's true. I don't know. For me,
this album was about vocal processing and vocal manipulation
and removing prose from the center, shifting focus toward sound
and texture and voice.
You don't have your synthesizer talking to you or telling you
something. So, I kind of wanted it to be more like an instrument
in that way. But of course, you still need phonemes or something
to work with, so I would usually just record myself saying non
sense, catch my sound at particular points and edit to make some
thing that made sense in English. But sometimes I wouldn't.
INT: On this same note, there seems to be a lot of breathing sam-

pling. Was this a conscious
choice, or is this just some
thing that came out of the cre
ative process?
HH: Yeah, it was a conscious
choice. I didn't just accidental
ly breathe in to the mic! With
"Breathe," the idea was how I
could take a really simple
input and kind of stretch it or
digitally manipulate it into a
larger sonic world. It's also this
idea of having a relationship
with your computer. Sort of a
personal, intimate thing where
you're breathing into the com
puter and it's breathing out at
you with this digital splatter.
INT: What about the intro to
"Terminal"? Isn't that breath
ing?
HH: That's actually synthe
sized. That's funny, I don't
think anyone has made that
comparison before. You know,
I was playing at a club in
Berlin and it was a really bad
fit. Katerholzig, it's kind of a
touristy place. It wasn't the
right evening for me to be
there and there were these
tourists there who, when I
started playing that, said
something like "I think the air
conditioner is broken!"
[laughs] I thought that was
hilarious.
INT: Some other articles por
tray you as a vocal proponent
of laptop-driven music. Do
you think you miss anything
without a hardware or analog
component?
HH: I don't think that laptop
alone has to be the future, just
as we still have baroque
instruments and baroque
ensembles, but I do think that
the laptop is the most capable
instrument we have right now.
I was listening to a talk at
CCRMA the other day by
John Chowning and he said in
the 70s, he wrote this piece
"Stria" and he was shifting
around the parcels to create
these new timbres that had
never been heard before, and
he said that at some moment
he realized that the computer
as an instrument was the
future. It was really powerful
to hear the guy who discov
ered digital synthesis say that.
I just think computers are

more capable than anything
else we have access to. I'm not
an absolutist. You don't have
to shit on drum machines, but
I would just prefer to develop
laptops. I actually use an 808
on one of the tracks.
INT: As far as trends in the
industry go, it seems like
there's a democratization of
electronic music right now,
where kids can just download
a copy of FL Studio or
Ableton, plug in the presets,
and be making their own
house music in a week....
How do you feel about this?
HH: I think it's awesome.
There was a time before
recording when everyone was
making music by themselves,
and it was just done of the
pure joy of making music. If
we are moving back towards
that, that's great. I think
because more people are mak
ing music, music will get bet
ter.
Of course there's going to
be a lot to sift through, but I
don't think the overall quality
of music will go down. Ge

future. It was really powerful
to hear the guy who discov
ered digital synthesis say that.
I just think computers are

more capable than anything
else we have access to. I'm not
an absolutist. You don't have
to shit on drum machines, but
I would just prefer to develop
laptops. I actually use an 808
on one of the tracks.
INT: As far as trends in the
industry go, it seems like
there's a democratization of
electronic music right now,
where kids can just download
a copy of FL Studio or
Ableton, plug in the presets,
and be making their own
house music in a week....
How do you feel about this?
HH: I think it's awesome.
There was a time before
recording when everyone was
making music by themselves,
and it was just done of the
pure joy of making music. If
we are moving back towards
that, that's great. I think
because more people are mak
ing music, music will get bet
ter.
Of course there's going to
be a lot to sift through, but I
don't think the overall quality
of music will go down. Ge
Wang, one of the professors at
CCRMA, is the founder of
Smule. One of their main
things is getting people to play
music collaboratively over
networks and I think that's
really interesting and positive.
Why not create a new para
digm where people are
involved with the music they
consume? [laughs] I don't feel
threatened, if that's what you
mean.
INT: As far your future goes,
do you plan on staying acade
mia with this sort of commu
nity, or do you think you're
going to go into the industry
or tour?
HH: That's a really tough
question and I don't have the
answer right now. I just start
ed and it's a five-year pro
gram. I just want to spend the
next five years writing as
much music as possible and
researching and making cool
things. I don't even know
what all the options are yet,
but I've never had an issue
finding a job or making my
skills applicable to other fields.
