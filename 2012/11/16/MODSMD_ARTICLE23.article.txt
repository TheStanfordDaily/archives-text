## HOLLY HERNDON Stanford's newest ingenue muses over "Movement" 
### Tom Schmidt | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you're tired of the
electronic music scene
at Stanford, try stepping
up from the romaine that
is brostep and progressive
house music to the kale
that is Holly Herndon's new
album "Movement."

Herndon, a Ph.D student in electronic music here at
Stanford, has spent the last five years in the Berlin music scene.
Originally from Tennessee, the fire-haired experimentalist honed
the academic side of her musical talents by earning an MFA in
Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College, an
impressive program that has produced such musical greats as
Steve Reich and Joanna Newsom.
"Movement," which has earned Herndon coverage in NPR
and Pitchfork, sits at the intersection of her avant-garde academic
work and the pulsing house beats popular in Berlin clubs, creating
something completely unlike anything you've ever heard.
INTERMISSION: How did you get into the club scene in Berlin
from Tennessee? That seems like a large jump.
HERNDON: I was an exchange student in high school, so that
was probably the big thing. I spoke German in high school, lived
with a family in Berlin, fell in love with a German club kid and I

guess the rest is history.

INT: Why come to Stanford after Mills
instead of going into the industry, and why
Stanford over someplace else?
HH: I really like the idea of being able to
work on music all the time and not have to
divide my time between something that pays
my bills and something that's my passion.
The access to resources here, the Stanford
"brain trust," the crazy equipment they have
at CCRMA [Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics] are amazing! I
wouldn't have access to these kinds of things
if I were just an artist that was touring all the

time. I wanted a technical boot camp with engineers that would
be kicking my butt and forcing me to improve.
INT: So, your album out today (Nov. 13), "Movement" not a
New Order reference, right?
HH: [laugh s] No, sorry.
INT: Sorry, had to ask. What was your inspiration for this album?
What sort of artists or genres were you listening to?
HH: Well, I would say my iTunes library is pretty diverse. I listen
to new music, dance music, etc., and that's always playing in our
house. For me, that's just normal to jump from genre to genre. I
wasn't thinking "I want to make this genre piece" or "I want to
make this genre piece". It's just kind of the soundtrack to contem
porary life.
I think most people are doing this though. They're clicking
around on You Tube or other things on their computer, and things
are coming from different directions, so they're not always just
one pace. I think it's fine to do albums this way. This one was
about bringing all my interests together in one place and not
apologizing about any of them, because I think I've done some of

that in the past.
INT: On your album, you have a tendency to use a lot of vocal
samples, but there weren't any discernible lyrics from what I could
hear. What was your idea behind that?
HH: I don't think that was a conscious choice that I made. It's
funny, I heard someone ask if I'm insecure about my lyrics or if
I'm hiding behind them. Maybe that's true. I don't know. For me,
this album was about vocal processing and vocal manipulation
and removing prose from the center, shifting focus toward sound
and texture and voice.
You don't have your synthesizer talking to you or telling you
something. So, I kind of wanted it to be more like an instrument
in that way. But of course, you still need phonemes or something
to work with, so I would usually just record myself saying non
sense, catch my sound at particular points and edit to make some
thing that made sense in English. But sometimes I wouldn't.
INT: On this same note, there seems to be a lot of breathing sam-
