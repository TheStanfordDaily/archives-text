# IN GOOD TASTE:
## Salad Days 
### Rachel Zarrow | STAFF WRITER 
Making the perfect salad is slight
ly more complicated than
throwing lettuce in a bowl and
calling it a day. But it's not so complicated
as to justify buying a premade salad at the
grocery store or always going out to eat a
salad. There are no steadfast rules to salad
making, but these guidelines will make
your salad something you look forward to
(like taking an IntroSem) rather than
something mandatory and boring
(Thinking Matters).
Guidelines for the perfect salad
Put a little thought into it. Try to bal
ance various elements like sweet, salty and
bitter. If you add something sweet, such as
fresh or dried fruit, counter it with some
thing salty like cheese or croutons. If you
use a soft cheese, add something crunchy,
such as seeds or nuts. With a bitter lettuce
such as arugula, consider mild ingredients
like tomatoes and mozzarella.
Dressing should be mixed in at the last
minute. Otherwise everything will wilt and
soggify. (Remember it this way: Keep your
salad naked for as long as possible. Getting
dressed shouldn't happen until the last

minute possible.)
Toast nuts before adding them it
will make them less waxy. Toasting the
nuts (either on the stove or in the oven)
will make them more flavorful and earthy.
Add crunchy things at the last minute.
If you plan to add anything crunchy such
as croutons or nuts, add them last or else
they will get soft.
Add a grain. To make a salad into
more of a meal, add a grain such as
quinoa, farro or barley. Just make sure that
the grain you cook has cooled before you
add it. Otherwise, the lettuce will wilt.
Wash greens before using. Even if it
says prewashed, there have been E. coli
scares recently, and it's always better to be
careful. (There's nothing like a little food
poisoning to make you resent a food for
the rest of your life.) Rinse the greens in a
bowl of water; then dry them with towels
or a salad spinner. Drying lettuce is
important because the oils in the dressing
won't stick well to wet greens.
Make your own dressing. Homemade
dressing is easy and much tastier than any
thing store-bought. The following is a
recipe for my favorite dressing.
