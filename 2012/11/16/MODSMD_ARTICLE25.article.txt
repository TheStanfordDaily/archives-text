# My mom's salad dressing
## 
### 
My mom has been making a variation of this balsamic vinaigrette for years. It is not only delicious,
but it also tends to impress dinner guests.
Mix the following ingredients together in a small bowl with a fork:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon maple syrup
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Fresh cracked black pepper and sea salt to taste
(Makes about 3 tablespoons, or enough to dress 1-2 salads.)
