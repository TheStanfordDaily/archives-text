# NOT FADE AWAY
## Q&A WRITER DIRECTOR DAVID CHASE 
### Gabrielle John | FELLOW 
It's been five years since the
controversial final episode
of "The Sopranos" aired,
and fans of the series have long
awaited creator David Chase's
next move. A Stanford alum
nus, Chase M.A. '7l is making
his feature film debut after
working in television for
almost three decades. The film,
"Not Fade Away," was screened
on campus followed by a Q
and-A session with Chase.
"I wanted to make a film
a long time ago, and I just
never got the opportunity. I
wrote scripts, but I couldn't get
a movie produced," Chase said.
"Not Fade Away" tells the
story of a group of young
friends growing up in subur
ban New Jersey in the 19605.
Inspired by the disruptive
musical scene at the time, the
gang of friends decides to form
a band. But unlike a lot of
other films about aspiring
musicians, the members of this
band never makes it past a
demo.
The plot focuses on

Douglas (John Magaro), the
drummer in the band, and his
relationship with his family
and with Grace (Bella
Heathcote), his love interest in
the film. Relative newcomers
Magaro and Heathcote are
joined by Lisa Lampanelli,
Brad Garrett, Jack Huston and
James Gandolfini, probably
best known for playing Tony
Soprano.
On reuniting with
Gandolfini again, Chase said,
"It was great, it was really
great. I think Jim and I got a
lot closer on this movie per
sonally than we had left things
on 'The Sopranos.' And he's
just a genius. He works, works,
works, works, works at an act
ing problem until he figures
out away to do it. He's very
inventive."
Gandolfini was also
rejoined by fellow "Sopranos"
cast member Steven van
Zandt, who acted as music
supervisor on the film, writing
a song played by the band in
the film and putting some of

the actors through a "boot
camp" to prepare for the film.
"We started at the end of
October, and by the time we
were ready to shoot in
February, they could have got
ten by as a band. They could
have played dances and bars
things like that," Chase said.
From the very beginning
of the film, a voiceover from
Douglas's sister informs the
audience that this is the story
of a band that they've probably
never heard of. The film is just
as much about the band mem
bers' personal lives as it is
about their musical careers.
The band's inability to recog
nize the work and time com
mitment necessary for success
is one of the film's main mes
sages.
Chase related the subject
to a Brian Eno quote.
"He [Eno] said, 'I think
it's important for people to
know that little trees come
from shit. And why that's
important is that people
should say to themselves well

the actors through a "boot

I'm shit and maybe something

I'm shit and maybe something
important could come from
me.' I found that very moving
and important and that's sort
of my version of that."
While the film has many
serious moments, some of the
most memorable aspects of
the film are the amusing and
darkly funny little moments
between the members of
Douglas's family and the
members of the band.
"That's what it's always
about for me is those little
details," Chase said. "When
Mark Johnson, who produced
it, when he read the script and
we had our first meeting he
said to me, 'This is an epic in a
small frame,' and that's kind of
why I decided to get in busi
ness with him I think he
understood that it's epic in
some way but it's in a very
small frame."
