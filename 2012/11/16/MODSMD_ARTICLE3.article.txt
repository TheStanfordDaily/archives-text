## GERs changed for Class of '17 
### ELIZABETH CARLS 
Departments are now regis
tering courses eligible to fulfill
the new general education
requirements, Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing,
approved by the Faculty Senate
earlier this year.
In accordance with recom
mendations by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report, the
new requirements will replace
both the Disciplinary Breadth
and Education for Citizenship
general education requirements
(GERs). Changes will take effect
for the incoming class of 2017.
While the cm-rent GERs are
"based on sampling disciplines,"
the new Ways of Thinking/Ways
of Doing will be "based on [build

ing] essential capacities," accord
ing to the Faculty Senate's
Breadth Governance Board offi
cial description of the program.
The new program is designed
to signal to students that "these
are important capacities ... to
have," but then to "leave the
choice of the knowledge up to the
students," so they can pursue the
capacity in a subject area that
aligns with their own interests,
chair of the breadth governance
board Chris Edwards said.
The program will focus on
eight capacities or Ways: aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry,
social inquiry, scientific method
and analysis, formal reasoning,
applied quantitative reasoning,
engaging diversity, ethical rea
soning and creative expression.
The Breadth Governance

Board hopes that this emphasis
on capacities rather than disci
plines will ultimately enable stu
dents to "actively create an edu
cation rather than passively
receive it."
Students must take two
courses in three of the Ways and
one in each of the other five, for a
total of eleven required courses.
Currently, students must one take
one course in each of five GER
disciplines and two of four educa
tion for citizenship courses for a
total of seven courses, although
some courses cross-fulfill GERs.
A major benefit of the Ways
program is that, by focusing on
ways of thinking instead of areas
of study, it will allow more
requirements to be fulfilled with
in a students' major or through
their general interests.

Yet despite the unit total of 33
to 55 units, according to
Edwards, the "net number of
classes is either the same or a lit
tle bit less for most majors."
Departments were able to
register classes qualifying for
Ways credit starting Nov. 10. The
first class registered was
CLASSGEN 17: Gender and
Power in Ancient Greece, taught
by Maud Gleason, professor of
classics. The class fulfills both
the engaging diversity and aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry
requirements.
Although only a few depart
ments have begun officially reg
istering courses, most have a
sense of how then* curriculum
will fulfill the Ways, according to
Edwards.
Within Edwards' depart
ment, mechanical engineer
ing, the sophomore level engi
neering courses like his own
ENGR 30: Engineering
Thermodynamics will be reg
istered under the scientific
method and analysis and/or
applied quantitative reason
ing requirements.
Additionally, the product
design program, which
shares much of the same fac
ulty and courses with
mechanical engineering, will
list classes like ME 101:
Visual Thinking under the
creative expression GER.
According to Susan
McConnell, biology professor
and Breadth Governance
Committee member, the biol
ogy department's core cours
es are "obvious candidates"

for scientific method and
analysis. Some upper division
classes may additionally be
registered under applied
quantitative reasoning.
The Biology Department
will also register some upper
division courses in more sur
prising areas. For example,
McConnell's introductory
seminar 810 7N: Introduction
to Conservation Photography
will be registered as a cre
ative expression course.

In the School of
Humanities & Sciences, the
History Department plans to
register most of its courses
under the social inquiry GER.
This designation "fits history
very naturally," because it
addresses the "larger narra
tive arc about how things
come to be the way they are,"
said History Department
Chair Karen Wigen.
Wigen expected that
engaging diversity would be
another popular designation
for classes like HISTORY
246 C: Islam and Christianity

in Africa, and classes that
study "intellectual history"
such as HISTORY 251 C: The
American Enlightenment
would fall under aesthetic and
interpretive inquiry.
These new capacity-based
breadth requirements are
receiving largely positive
feedback from both faculty
and students.
"The intent behind [the
new system] is very good,"
Wigen said, who affirmed
that capacities, rather than
just subject matter, are the
department's teaching goal.
The challenge is for facul
ty to come up with "creative
ways to address this rubric,"
Wigen said.
To this end, the Breadth
and Governance Committee
is encouraging innovation in
classes for both majors and
non-majors within each
department so that students
can fulfill some Ways require
ments within their interest
area, but are also sometimes
forced to step outside of their

comfort zone.
For example, a collabora
tion between the Mechanical
Engineering Department and
the Center for Ethics in
Society to create a class for
seniors that explores difficult
ethical dilemmas that students
may face in the engineering
world is on the horizon,
Edwards said. He also cited
PHYSICS 19: How Things
Work: An Introduction to
Physics as a good example of
an innovative class for non
majors.
"It's not a watered down
version of physics... it's the
skills from physics that some
one who isn't going to be a sci
ence major might want,"
Edwards said.
The Faculty Senate con
tinues working towards the
implementation of other rec
ommendations of the SUES
report, including helix courses
and project-based learning.

classes is either the same or a lit
tle bit less for most majors."
Departments were able to
register classes qualifying for
Ways credit starting Nov. 10. The
first class registered was
CLASSGEN 17: Gender and
Power in Ancient Greece, taught
by Maud Gleason, professor of
classics. The class fulfills both
the engaging diversity and aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry
requirements.
Although only a few depart
ments have begun officially reg
istering courses, most have a
sense of how then* curriculum
will fulfill the Ways, according to
Edwards.
Within Edwards' depart
ment, mechanical engineer
ing, the sophomore level engi
neering courses like his own
ENGR 30: Engineering
Thermodynamics will be reg
istered under the scientific
method and analysis and/or
applied quantitative reason
ing requirements.
Additionally, the product
design program, which
shares much of the same fac
ulty and courses with
mechanical engineering, will
list classes like ME 101:
Visual Thinking under the
creative expression GER.
According to Susan
McConnell, biology professor
and Breadth Governance
Committee member, the biol
ogy department's core cours
es are "obvious candidates"

for scientific method and
analysis. Some upper division
classes may additionally be
registered under applied
quantitative reasoning.
The Biology Department
will also register some upper
division courses in more sur
prising areas. For example,
McConnell's introductory
seminar 810 7N: Introduction
to Conservation Photography
will be registered as a cre
ative expression course.

In the School of
Humanities & Sciences, the
History Department plans to
register most of its courses
under the social inquiry GER.
This designation "fits history
very naturally," because it
addresses the "larger narra
tive arc about how things
come to be the way they are,"
said History Department
Chair Karen Wigen.
Wigen expected that
engaging diversity would be
another popular designation
for classes like HISTORY
246 C: Islam and Christianity

in Africa, and classes that
study "intellectual history"
such as HISTORY 251 C: The
American Enlightenment
would fall under aesthetic and
interpretive inquiry.
These new capacity-based
breadth requirements are
receiving largely positive
feedback from both faculty
and students.
"The intent behind [the
new system] is very good,"
Wigen said, who affirmed
that capacities, rather than
just subject matter, are the
department's teaching goal.
The challenge is for facul
ty to come up with "creative
ways to address this rubric,"
Wigen said.
To this end, the Breadth
and Governance Committee
is encouraging innovation in
classes for both majors and
non-majors within each
department so that students
can fulfill some Ways require
ments within their interest
area, but are also sometimes
forced to step outside of their

comfort zone.
For example, a collabora
tion between the Mechanical
Engineering Department and
the Center for Ethics in
Society to create a class for
seniors that explores difficult
ethical dilemmas that students
may face in the engineering
world is on the horizon,
Edwards said. He also cited
PHYSICS 19: How Things
Work: An Introduction to
Physics as a good example of
an innovative class for non
majors.
"It's not a watered down
version of physics... it's the
skills from physics that some
one who isn't going to be a sci
ence major might want,"
Edwards said.
The Faculty Senate con
tinues working towards the
implementation of other rec
ommendations of the SUES
report, including helix courses
and project-based learning.

Departments are now regis
tering courses eligible to fulfill
the new general education
requirements, Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing,
approved by the Faculty Senate
earlier this year.
In accordance with recom
mendations by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report, the
new requirements will replace
both the Disciplinary Breadth
and Education for Citizenship
general education requirements
(GERs). Changes will take effect
for the incoming class of 2017.
While the cm-rent GERs are
"based on sampling disciplines,"
the new Ways of Thinking/Ways
of Doing will be "based on [build

ing] essential capacities," accord
ing to the Faculty Senate's
Breadth Governance Board offi
cial description of the program.
The new program is designed
to signal to students that "these
are important capacities ... to
have," but then to "leave the
choice of the knowledge up to the
students," so they can pursue the
capacity in a subject area that
aligns with their own interests,
chair of the breadth governance
board Chris Edwards said.
The program will focus on
eight capacities or Ways: aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry,
social inquiry, scientific method
and analysis, formal reasoning,
applied quantitative reasoning,
engaging diversity, ethical rea
soning and creative expression.
The Breadth Governance

Board hopes that this emphasis
on capacities rather than disci
plines will ultimately enable stu
dents to "actively create an edu
cation rather than passively
receive it."
Students must take two
courses in three of the Ways and
one in each of the other five, for a
total of eleven required courses.
Currently, students must one take
one course in each of five GER
disciplines and two of four educa
tion for citizenship courses for a
total of seven courses, although
some courses cross-fulfill GERs.
A major benefit of the Ways
program is that, by focusing on
ways of thinking instead of areas
of study, it will allow more
requirements to be fulfilled with
in a students' major or through
their general interests.

Yet despite the unit total of 33
to 55 units, according to
Edwards, the "net number of
classes is either the same or a lit
