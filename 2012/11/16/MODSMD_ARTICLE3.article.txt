## GERs changed for Class of '17 
### ELIZABETH CARLS 
Departments are now regis
tering courses eligible to fulfill
the new general education
requirements, Ways of
Thinking/Ways of Doing,
approved by the Faculty Senate
earlier this year.
In accordance with recom
mendations by the Study of
Undergraduate Education at
Stanford (SUES) report, the
new requirements will replace
both the Disciplinary Breadth
and Education for Citizenship
general education requirements
(GERs). Changes will take effect
for the incoming class of 2017.
While the cm-rent GERs are
"based on sampling disciplines,"
the new Ways of Thinking/Ways
of Doing will be "based on [build

ing] essential capacities," accord
ing to the Faculty Senate's
Breadth Governance Board offi
cial description of the program.
The new program is designed
to signal to students that "these
are important capacities ... to
have," but then to "leave the
choice of the knowledge up to the
students," so they can pursue the
capacity in a subject area that
aligns with their own interests,
chair of the breadth governance
board Chris Edwards said.
The program will focus on
eight capacities or Ways: aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry,
social inquiry, scientific method
and analysis, formal reasoning,
applied quantitative reasoning,
engaging diversity, ethical rea
soning and creative expression.
The Breadth Governance

Board hopes that this emphasis
on capacities rather than disci
plines will ultimately enable stu
dents to "actively create an edu
cation rather than passively
receive it."
Students must take two
courses in three of the Ways and
one in each of the other five, for a
total of eleven required courses.
Currently, students must one take
one course in each of five GER
disciplines and two of four educa
tion for citizenship courses for a
total of seven courses, although
some courses cross-fulfill GERs.
A major benefit of the Ways
program is that, by focusing on
ways of thinking instead of areas
of study, it will allow more
requirements to be fulfilled with
in a students' major or through
their general interests.

Yet despite the unit total of 33
to 55 units, according to
Edwards, the "net number of
classes is either the same or a lit
tle bit less for most majors."
Departments were able to
register classes qualifying for
Ways credit starting Nov. 10. The
first class registered was
CLASSGEN 17: Gender and
Power in Ancient Greece, taught
by Maud Gleason, professor of
classics. The class fulfills both
the engaging diversity and aes
thetic and interpretive inquiry
requirements.
Although only a few depart
ments have begun officially reg
istering courses, most have a
sense of how then* curriculum
will fulfill the Ways, according to
