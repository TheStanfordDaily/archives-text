## Authors stand by results of organic food study 
### KAMARIA TAYLOR 
Despite the national controversy sur
rounding the results of an organic food
study by Stanford researchers, the study's
authors stand by their results.
The study, which disputed the health
benefits of organic food, was published on
Sept. 4 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
It made headlines in national media outlets
soon thereafter. Yet, within days, critics
began to cast doubts on the study's
methodology and funding, crowned by an
Oct. 2 column by Mark Bittman of The New
York Times. Bittman called the study "junk
science."
Lead authors Dena Bravata, an adjunct
affiliate at the Center for Health Policy, and
Crystal Smith-Spangler, instructor at the
School of Medicine, decided to conduct the
study because their patients often asked
whether or not organic food was a healthier
option than conventional alternatives.
"I am a physician. My patients ask me
about organic food or conventional food and
what the differences are and so it was real

ly just to learn [for] ourselves and then we
thought it would be of interest to others,
hence the publication," Smith-Spangler
said.
The study focused exclusively on the
nutritional, health and safety aspects of
organic versus conventional food, including
fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, milk, poul
try and eggs. Processed food was not stud
ied.
Results showed that organic foods
offered little notable nutritional benefits
and rarely contained additional vitamins
when compared to its conventional counter
parts. Findings indicated that the only
nutritional benefit of organic food is the
higher levels of phosphorous they con
tained. However, the authors pointed out
that extra phosphorous provides little
health benefit because few people have
depleted levels of the mineral.
Despite the purported lack of nutrition
al benefit from organic food, the study
found that conventional food contained 30
percent more pesticides than organic foods
and that antibiotic resistant bacteria were

less likely to live in organic chicken and
pork. Even so, the authors stated that both
organic and conventional options fall within
food safety regulations and that not all
organic food is pesticide-free.
To arrive at these results, researchers
did not conduct any original research.
Instead, they relied on past studies using a
statistical tool known as meta-analysis.
Ingram Olkin, professor emeritus of
statistics developed this model of statistical
analysis, which is used to combine and
assess the results of multiple, independent
studies. The researchers applied meta
analysis to compile past research done on
the health of organic foods and discern a
single conclusion. The method is criticized
by some in the field.
Over the past four years, the team read
thousands of studies going back decades to
narrow their research down to 237 peer
reviewed papers, which they then scruti
nized with meta-analysis. 223 of the studies
evaluated the nutrient, bacterial, fungal or

narrow their research down to 237
peer-reviewed papers, which they
then scrutinized with meta-analysis.
223 of the studies evaluated the nutri
ent, bacterial, fungal or pesticide con
tent of conventional and organic
foods. Although the research was
comprehensive, Olkin said that the
results are not definitive because the
evidence analyzed was weak.
"When data is not strong, two
people looking at the data can easily
see differences," Olkin said.
Indeed, in April 2011, a team from
Newcastle University in England
also performed meta-analysis and
found slightly different results.
According to then* study, vitamin C
content is higher in organic foods.
Critics of the study argued that
meta-analysis done exclusively by
statistical experts neglects the input
of scientists who study organic food.
"They are really good at that
analysis but I do not think that is
quite enough," said Associate
Professor of Medicine Christopher
Gardner. "I think you have to get
experts in the field of the study that
you are pooling."
Professor of Engineering and co
author of the study Margaret
Brandeau rejected this suggestion.
"We did not really think we need
ed someone who knows about organ
ic food. We need someone who knows
about how to interpret statistical
results of studies," she said.
Another area that came under
criticism was the source of funding
for the research. Critics accused the
authors of bias because of Stanford's
financial ties to agricultural compa
nies like Cargill, Inc. and Monsanto
Company

Cargill and Monsanto are both
agricultural giants in the food pro
duction industry. Both companies
have reportedly donated to
Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute
(FSI). In particular, Cargill has
worked with Stanford for 25 years in
the Food, Security and the
Environment (FSE) program. It has
donated $3 million to the University,
with another $2 million pledged. The
Center for Health Policy, with which
Bravata and Smith-Spangler are
affiliated, is part of FSI.
However, the Stanford team
asserts that neither the FSI nor the
money that Cargill donated to FSE
was directly associated with any of
the research conducted for the study.
"We did not have anything to do
with this study," said FSE Director
Rosamond Naylor. "Cargill does not
support any of our research projects.
They support just the base funding..
. for running the operation."
Nonetheless, critics like health
advocate and journalist Anthony
Gucciardi created a Change.org peti
tion titled "Retract the Flawed
'Organic Study' Linked to Big
Tobacco and Pro-GMO Corps" call
ing for the retraction of the study and
a review of the findings by a third
party. This petition currently has
over 6,700 signatures.

Fhrther criticism of the meta
analysis method pointed out the link
between Olkin and Big Tobacco com
panies. The petition alleges that Olkin
worked with Big Tobacco companies
in the past that used meta-analysis to
skew data on the health effects of cig
arettes. Due to this precedent, the
Change.org petition described the
meta-analysis method as a"a way to
lie with statistics."
Olkin said he used statistics to
investigate studies on the health
effects of tobacco for several Big-
Tobacco companies around 50 years
ago. However, he clarified that tobac

co companies asked many statisti
cians to independently evaluate the
evidence they found and that his find
ings did not assert that tobacco was
not dangerous.
Other complaints claim that the
study failed to address the variety of
other benefits that organic food
offers consumers such as taste and
benefit to the environment.
"Organic food and conventional
food may be nutritionally equal and
have the same vitamins et cetera, but
there are so many other factors at
play," said Head Fanner for the
Stanford Farm Project Marika Sitz
'l5. "The organic methods are a bet
ter way to be environmentally friend
ly and address the social justice
aspect as far as workers rights are
concerned."
The authors of the study coun
tered that from the onset the study's
purpose was not to comment on other
potential benefits of organic food but
only to decipher whether or not it was
healthier than conventional options.
"People choose to consume organ
ic food for many different reasons
and this is just one reason," Smith-
Spangler said. "In fact our press
release included it and it was included
in the introduction and in our- abstract
and in our conclusion that there are
many reasons people may consume
organic versus conventional food."
Organic food supporters such as
Sitz still express frustration with the
study.
"I would like to see maybe a state
ment issued by the people who did
the study just clarifying some
things," Sitz said.
"We figured the study would defi
nitely get a lot of attention, maybe [it
got] a lot more than we ever expect
ed," Brandeau said, "But we stand by
our results."

Despite the national controversy sur
rounding the results of an organic food
study by Stanford researchers, the study's
authors stand by their results.
The study, which disputed the health
benefits of organic food, was published on
Sept. 4 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
It made headlines in national media outlets
soon thereafter. Yet, within days, critics
began to cast doubts on the study's
methodology and funding, crowned by an
Oct. 2 column by Mark Bittman of The New
York Times. Bittman called the study "junk
science."
Lead authors Dena Bravata, an adjunct
affiliate at the Center for Health Policy, and
Crystal Smith-Spangler, instructor at the
School of Medicine, decided to conduct the
study because their patients often asked
whether or not organic food was a healthier
option than conventional alternatives.
"I am a physician. My patients ask me
about organic food or conventional food and
what the differences are and so it was real

ly just to learn [for] ourselves and then we
thought it would be of interest to others,
hence the publication," Smith-Spangler
said.
The study focused exclusively on the
nutritional, health and safety aspects of
organic versus conventional food, including
fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, milk, poul
try and eggs. Processed food was not stud
ied.
Results showed that organic foods
offered little notable nutritional benefits
and rarely contained additional vitamins
when compared to its conventional counter
parts. Findings indicated that the only
nutritional benefit of organic food is the
higher levels of phosphorous they con
tained. However, the authors pointed out
that extra phosphorous provides little
health benefit because few people have
depleted levels of the mineral.
Despite the purported lack of nutrition
al benefit from organic food, the study
found that conventional food contained 30
percent more pesticides than organic foods
and that antibiotic resistant bacteria were

less likely to live in organic chicken and
pork. Even so, the authors stated that both
organic and conventional options fall within
food safety regulations and that not all
organic food is pesticide-free.
To arrive at these results, researchers
did not conduct any original research.
Instead, they relied on past studies using a
statistical tool known as meta-analysis.
Ingram Olkin, professor emeritus of
statistics developed this model of statistical
analysis, which is used to combine and
assess the results of multiple, independent
studies. The researchers applied meta
analysis to compile past research done on
the health of organic foods and discern a
single conclusion. The method is criticized
by some in the field.
Over the past four years, the team read
thousands of studies going back decades to
narrow their research down to 237 peer
reviewed papers, which they then scruti
nized with meta-analysis. 223 of the studies
evaluated the nutrient, bacterial, fungal or

narrow their research down to 237
peer-reviewed papers, which they
then scrutinized with meta-analysis.
223 of the studies evaluated the nutri
ent, bacterial, fungal or pesticide con
tent of conventional and organic
foods. Although the research was
comprehensive, Olkin said that the
results are not definitive because the
evidence analyzed was weak.
"When data is not strong, two
people looking at the data can easily
see differences," Olkin said.
Indeed, in April 2011, a team from
Newcastle University in England
also performed meta-analysis and
found slightly different results.
According to then* study, vitamin C
content is higher in organic foods.
Critics of the study argued that
meta-analysis done exclusively by
statistical experts neglects the input
of scientists who study organic food.
"They are really good at that
analysis but I do not think that is
quite enough," said Associate
Professor of Medicine Christopher
Gardner. "I think you have to get
experts in the field of the study that
you are pooling."
Professor of Engineering and co
author of the study Margaret
Brandeau rejected this suggestion.
"We did not really think we need
ed someone who knows about organ
ic food. We need someone who knows
about how to interpret statistical
results of studies," she said.
Another area that came under
criticism was the source of funding
for the research. Critics accused the
authors of bias because of Stanford's
financial ties to agricultural compa
nies like Cargill, Inc. and Monsanto
Company

Cargill and Monsanto are both
agricultural giants in the food pro
duction industry. Both companies
have reportedly donated to
Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute
(FSI). In particular, Cargill has
worked with Stanford for 25 years in
the Food, Security and the
Environment (FSE) program. It has
donated $3 million to the University,
with another $2 million pledged. The
Center for Health Policy, with which
Bravata and Smith-Spangler are
affiliated, is part of FSI.
However, the Stanford team
asserts that neither the FSI nor the
money that Cargill donated to FSE
was directly associated with any of
the research conducted for the study.
"We did not have anything to do
with this study," said FSE Director
Rosamond Naylor. "Cargill does not
support any of our research projects.
They support just the base funding..
. for running the operation."
Nonetheless, critics like health
advocate and journalist Anthony
Gucciardi created a Change.org peti
tion titled "Retract the Flawed
'Organic Study' Linked to Big
Tobacco and Pro-GMO Corps" call
ing for the retraction of the study and
a review of the findings by a third
party. This petition currently has
over 6,700 signatures.

Fhrther criticism of the meta
analysis method pointed out the link
between Olkin and Big Tobacco com
panies. The petition alleges that Olkin
worked with Big Tobacco companies
in the past that used meta-analysis to
skew data on the health effects of cig
arettes. Due to this precedent, the
Change.org petition described the
meta-analysis method as a"a way to
lie with statistics."
Olkin said he used statistics to
investigate studies on the health
effects of tobacco for several Big-
Tobacco companies around 50 years
ago. However, he clarified that tobac

co companies asked many statisti
cians to independently evaluate the
evidence they found and that his find
ings did not assert that tobacco was
not dangerous.
Other complaints claim that the
study failed to address the variety of
other benefits that organic food
offers consumers such as taste and
benefit to the environment.
"Organic food and conventional
food may be nutritionally equal and
have the same vitamins et cetera, but
there are so many other factors at
play," said Head Fanner for the
Stanford Farm Project Marika Sitz
'l5. "The organic methods are a bet
ter way to be environmentally friend
ly and address the social justice
aspect as far as workers rights are
concerned."
The authors of the study coun
tered that from the onset the study's
purpose was not to comment on other
potential benefits of organic food but
only to decipher whether or not it was
healthier than conventional options.
"People choose to consume organ
ic food for many different reasons
and this is just one reason," Smith-
Spangler said. "In fact our press
release included it and it was included
in the introduction and in our- abstract
and in our conclusion that there are
many reasons people may consume
organic versus conventional food."
Organic food supporters such as
Sitz still express frustration with the
study.
"I would like to see maybe a state
ment issued by the people who did
the study just clarifying some
things," Sitz said.
"We figured the study would defi
nitely get a lot of attention, maybe [it
got] a lot more than we ever expect
ed," Brandeau said, "But we stand by
our results."
