## Authors stand by results of organic food study

Despite the national controversy sur
rounding the results of an organic food
study by Stanford researchers, the study's
authors stand by their results.
The study, which disputed the health
benefits of organic food, was published on
Sept. 4 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
It made headlines in national media outlets
soon thereafter. Yet, within days, critics
began to cast doubts on the study's
methodology and funding, crowned by an
Oct. 2 column by Mark Bittman of The New
York Times. Bittman called the study "junk
science."
Lead authors Dena Bravata, an adjunct
affiliate at the Center for Health Policy, and
Crystal Smith-Spangler, instructor at the
School of Medicine, decided to conduct the
study because their patients often asked
whether or not organic food was a healthier
option than conventional alternatives.
"I am a physician. My patients ask me
about organic food or conventional food and
what the differences are and so it was real

ly just to learn [for] ourselves and then we
thought it would be of interest to others,
hence the publication," Smith-Spangler
said.
The study focused exclusively on the
nutritional, health and safety aspects of
organic versus conventional food, including
fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, milk, poul
try and eggs. Processed food was not stud
ied.
Results showed that organic foods
offered little notable nutritional benefits
and rarely contained additional vitamins
when compared to its conventional counter
parts. Findings indicated that the only
nutritional benefit of organic food is the
higher levels of phosphorous they con
tained. However, the authors pointed out
that extra phosphorous provides little
health benefit because few people have
depleted levels of the mineral.
Despite the purported lack of nutrition
al benefit from organic food, the study
found that conventional food contained 30
percent more pesticides than organic foods
and that antibiotic resistant bacteria were

less likely to live in organic chicken and
pork. Even so, the authors stated that both
organic and conventional options fall within
food safety regulations and that not all
organic food is pesticide-free.
To arrive at these results, researchers
did not conduct any original research.
Instead, they relied on past studies using a
statistical tool known as meta-analysis.
Ingram Olkin, professor emeritus of
statistics developed this model of statistical
analysis, which is used to combine and
assess the results of multiple, independent
studies. The researchers applied meta
analysis to compile past research done on
the health of organic foods and discern a
single conclusion. The method is criticized
by some in the field.
Over the past four years, the team read
thousands of studies going back decades to
narrow their research down to 237 peer
reviewed papers, which they then scruti
nized with meta-analysis. 223 of the studies
evaluated the nutrient, bacterial, fungal or

The Stanford organic food study's results showed that
organic foods offered few notable nutritional benefits
over conventional foods. However, the methods and
funding of the study have come under fire nationally.
