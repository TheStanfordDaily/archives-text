## Stanford rolling out new wordmark, fonts 
### MARWA FARAG MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford began slowly rolling out a
new wordmark to be placed on all
University-affiliated websites and pro
motional materials last week. Reactions
to the font on social media were over
whelmingly negative.
The Stanford signature, or logo, will
use a new free, open-source font
designed by a team to mimic the curves
of the Main Quad, according to
University Spokeswoman Lisa Lapin.
The University paid a licensing fee for
the previous font used.
The two new fonts, Source Sans Pro
and Crimson Text, will be used in print
and online communication. The website
of the new "Stanford identity" instructs
users to treat the new signature "as art
work, not as typography."
The Stanford signature is the "unique
ly drawn set ?of typographic characters
that symbolize Stanford? University."
The signature will be the only

changed symbol the Block "S," Block
"S" with tree and University seal will
remain the same.

Why the font was changed
According to Lapin, complaints were
received that the old signature did "not
reproduce well in signage, [was] not
readable from a distance in banners,...
not readily compatible with some of our
lengthy campus unit names and [was]

particularly challenging to sew onto
clothing." It also was unsuited for small
format on mobile devices.
The new signature is "clearly legible"
in different sizes and formats, according
to Brad Hayward, senior director for
strategic communications.
"The principle for us really is the flex
ibility of usage and its applicability in the


Courtesy identity.stanford.edu
digital environment first and fore
most," Hayward said.
The new signature is also intended
to allow various University depart
ments to adapt their logos to limited
space. Hayward noted that the design
incorporated "the feedback of those
who have commented on the limita
tions of use" of the old logo.
The word "University" was also
dropped from the new wordmark to
allow for versatile application.
The open-source fonts used in
the new design also mean it is now
cheaper, but Hayward said that
removing usage limitations was the
priority rather than economic rea
sons.
"I think it's important for people
to understand the reasons the
change was undertaken: both to
increase the flexibility of usage for
people across the University com
munity who need to associate their
individual programs with the larger
Stanford identity and also for ensur
ing that the Stanford mark is clear
and legible and functional in the dig
ital environment," Hayward said.
In a statement, Lapin said the
change "was absolutely intended to
be a significant cost saving to the
University."
The new wordmark was a result
of collaboration by the Office of the
Provost, University Communications
and Business Affairs. Bright, a
design firm based in Marina Del
Rey, Calif., created the new logo.
The firm has designed for UCLA,
the Grammys, Muscle Milk and
Safeway. It was chosen by following
what Lapin called an "extensive
RFP [Request for Proposal]

process."
President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy selected
the new wordmark from a variety of
options presented to them, accord
ing to Lapin.

Rolling out the new font
The new wordmark is being
rolled out on a gradual basis with no
timeline for the University as a
whole. The identity website was
announced on Oct. 25 and some
University-wide websites have
incorporated the new fonts.
These include the University
homepage, Stanford Arts, Stanford
News Service, Stanford Nobel
Laureates and the new Identity
website.
"The various schools and depart
ments and programs are, on a vol
untary basis, able to begin incorpo
rating the updated identity as they
see fit," Hayward said. "That
means, as they are comfortable with
and ready to move into using the
new, updated identity, they can do so
in their websites, their printed
materials and the like."
Lapin said response has been
"overwhelmingly positive," particu
larly from campus units, noting that
her office had received praised from
members of the "global design com
munity" describing the new word
mark as a "fresh, modern and ver
satile solution."
This is in stark contrast to the
majority of reactions from students
and alumni on Twitter and
Facebook, which have largely
panned the font as childish and
unattractive.

that symbolize Stanford? University."
The signature will be the only

changed symbol the Block "S," Block
"S" with tree and University seal will
remain the same.

Why the font was changed
According to Lapin, complaints were
received that the old signature did "not
reproduce well in signage, [was] not
readable from a distance in banners,...
not readily compatible with some of our
lengthy campus unit names and [was]

particularly challenging to sew onto
clothing." It also was unsuited for small
format on mobile devices.
The new signature is "clearly legible"
in different sizes and formats, according
to Brad Hayward, senior director for
strategic communications.
"The principle for us really is the flex
ibility of usage and its applicability in the

digital environment first and fore
most," Hayward said.
The new signature is also intended
to allow various University depart
ments to adapt their logos to limited
space. Hayward noted that the design
incorporated "the feedback of those
who have commented on the limita
tions of use" of the old logo.
The word "University" was also
dropped from the new wordmark to
allow for versatile application.
The open-source fonts used in
the new design also mean it is now
cheaper, but Hayward said that
removing usage limitations was the
priority rather than economic rea
sons.
"I think it's important for people
to understand the reasons the
change was undertaken: both to
increase the flexibility of usage for
people across the University com
munity who need to associate their
individual programs with the larger
Stanford identity and also for ensur
ing that the Stanford mark is clear
and legible and functional in the dig
ital environment," Hayward said.
In a statement, Lapin said the
change "was absolutely intended to
be a significant cost saving to the
University."
The new wordmark was a result
of collaboration by the Office of the
Provost, University Communications
and Business Affairs. Bright, a
design firm based in Marina Del
Rey, Calif., created the new logo.
The firm has designed for UCLA,
the Grammys, Muscle Milk and
Safeway. It was chosen by following
what Lapin called an "extensive
RFP [Request for Proposal]

process."
President John Hennessy and
Provost John Etchemendy selected
the new wordmark from a variety of
options presented to them, accord
ing to Lapin.

Rolling out the new font
The new wordmark is being
rolled out on a gradual basis with no
timeline for the University as a
whole. The identity website was
announced on Oct. 25 and some
University-wide websites have
incorporated the new fonts.
These include the University
homepage, Stanford Arts, Stanford
News Service, Stanford Nobel
Laureates and the new Identity
website.
"The various schools and depart
ments and programs are, on a vol
untary basis, able to begin incorpo
rating the updated identity as they
see fit," Hayward said. "That
means, as they are comfortable with
and ready to move into using the
new, updated identity, they can do so
in their websites, their printed
materials and the like."
Lapin said response has been
"overwhelmingly positive," particu
larly from campus units, noting that
her office had received praised from
members of the "global design com
munity" describing the new word
mark as a "fresh, modern and ver
satile solution."
This is in stark contrast to the
majority of reactions from students
and alumni on Twitter and
Facebook, which have largely
panned the font as childish and
unattractive.
