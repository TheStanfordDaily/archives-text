## LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
### 
Monday's article on the edu
cational ambitions of
Stanford Residential and
Dining Enterprises staff ("Dining
employees balance work, student
obligations," The Stanford Daily)
was eye-opening and inspiring.
Stanford's reticence to assist those
goals, though, is anything but. That
Stanford a university with its
own top-flight School of Education
does less than UPS to encourage
the educational aspirations of its
dining employees, seems almost
perverse.
I hope Stanford begins address
ing this issue, a philosophical dis
sonance that cuts to the core of
our institution's mission, and I hope
to see The Daily continuing to
cover it.

Having returned to Stanford
after a lengthy stint in
industry, I am struck by the
dearth of (currently optional) pub
lic notices for University Ph.D. oral

examinations appearing in the
Stanford Report. This is quite
unfortunate for a number of rea
sons. As a STEM field researcher,
I am all too aware of how impor
tant the "white space" between
traditional disciplines and depart
ments is to advancing science and
technology.
As a pre-major advisor, I
encourage my advisees to attend
Ph.D. orals (with me) so that they
can get an understanding of what
are the current frontiers in an area
of possible career interest and a
clear idea of what studies and train
ing they might need to go down
such a path.
And, irrespective of the field of
discipline, orals provide a compact
exposure to a wide range of sub
jects that can make one a more
informed citizen. I hope these justi
fications may serve as a clarion call
to all University departments to
resume routine publication of Ph.D.
oral schedules in the Stanford
Report.
