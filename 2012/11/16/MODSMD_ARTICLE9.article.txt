# SEEING GREEN
## Back on the market 
### Holly Moeller

Last week, I missed Wednesday.
Normally, the perils of cross
ing the international date
line en route to field sites don't
bother me. After all, who really
minds missing the middle of the
working week?
But this time, Wednesday's absence
bothered me. That's because two
days ago, California officially
opened its carbon cap-and-trade
market with the first sale of emis
sions permits since the state passed
landmark climate change legisla
tion six years ago.
Given that the state of
California does enough business to
rank as the world's ninth largest
economy, and that its emissions
trading system, once fully imple
mented, will be second only to the
European Union's, the eyes of the
world and, particularly, of those
Washington policymakers willing to
admit that climate change is an
issue are on the outcome.
Emissions cap-and-trade
schemes represent a philosophical
compromise between free market
economics and rational regulation.
On the one hand, a governmental
body steps in by setting a "cap,"
some limit to the total amount of
emissions calibrated to limit envi
ronmental harm. But once this limit
is set (and suitable penalties
arranged to enforce it), the market
takes over and the rules of supply
and demand set the prices of emis
sions permits. As supply falls
say, as the government lowers
emission limits the price of each
permit increases. This increasing
cost drives technological innovation
and emissions reduction. The most
agile firms, which are able to
reduce emissions below their per
mitted levels, can then sell off
excess permits to other emitters.
The overall effect elegantly
demonstrated by reduction of sul
fur dioxide emissions in this coun
try just a few years ago —is to
allow economics to drive environ
mental protection. As an added
bonus, the funds collected from
permit sales can be used either to
compensate consumers for elevated
downstream costs, or to fund addi
tional emissions reduction research
and programs. California plans to
use the proceeds from last
Wednesday, and subsequent permit
sales, for a suite of as-yet unspeci
fied programs intended to crank
state emissions back down to 1990
levels by 2020.
Of course, the cap and trade
plan hasn't gone uncontested.
Dedicated lobbying, threats of law
suits and some actually filed law
suits attempted to stall
Wednesday's sale. And over the
next few months, particularly when
enforcement begins in 2013, we'll
likely hear a fresh outcry from the
major greenhouse gas emitters
primarily power and manufactur
ing plants, refineries and trans
portation firms required to com
ply with the regulations.
However, it's worth noting that
not all industry is opposed to emis
sions regulation. "Green" and
"clean" tech companies benefit
from a playing field leveled by put
ting a price on carbon dioxide emis
sions. And California has such tech
companies in abundance.
California also has the size

both physical and economic —to
make this program count. An emis
sions cap and trade program must
be large enough to encompass a
suite of market competitors within
a region; otherwise, greenhouse
gas emitters can move production
elsewhere to avoid emissions regu
lations.

Such regulatory dodging has
been the repeated concern of all
governing bodies contemplating
any form of pollution regulation.
No one wants to be blamed for
shipping jobs overseas, particularly
given present-day economic strug
gles. But some things like elec
tricity generation must happen
on a relatively local scale. That's
why a coalition of nine East Coast
states banded together to form the
Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative, which began selling
emissions permits to power plants
in 2008. And it's also why, in 2007,
the year after California's land
mark climate change legislation
(the same legislation that produced
Wednesday's auction) was signed
into law, California became a found
ing member of the Western
Climate Initiative (WCI).
The WCI should have provided
a platform for governments of the
Western United States and Canada
(with the notable exception of tar
sands-happy Alberta) to coordinate
development of market-based solu
tions for greenhouse gas emission
reductions. Yet after years of
delays, hesitation and accusations
of greenwashing, the initiative has
largely disintegrated.
Will the opening of California's
long-awaited cap-and-trade market
stimulate new interest at the
regional and national scale?
Perhaps, given the recent, dramat
ic weather on the Eastern
Seaboard and President Obama's
nod to climate change in his victory
speech, we might see a new flurry
of activity. Still, it seems that,
despite the long history of U.S.
technological leadership, we will be
the followers when it comes to tak
ing action on regulating carbon
emissions.

Whichever way the pendulum
swings, much will hinge on the
results of California's first auction,
to be released on Monday. Or
Tuesday, depending on your hemi
sphere.
