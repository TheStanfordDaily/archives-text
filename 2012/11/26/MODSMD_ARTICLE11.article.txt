## Two Visions of Democracy 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Political scientists draw an ele
mentary distinction between
two models of representative
democracy, both first articulated by
British political philosopher Edmund
Burke. In the first, termed the "del
egate model," elected officials exist
only to articulate the voice of their
constituents. Like the monstrous
king that adorned the original cover
of Hobbes' "Leviathan," these public
officials are theoretically mere
agglomerations of the people they
represent, possessing no opinion or
will separate from the collective
voice of the voters.

In the second, termed the
"trustee model," voters elect the
best candidate to office in the hopes
that he will wisely exercise his own
judgment in the service of the pub
lic interest, regardless of how his
constituents may feel about each
particular issue. Voters entrust
power to such a trustee, Burke
thought, in order that "his unbiased
opinion, his mature judgment, his
enlightened conscience" may bene-

fit the public at large, especially
when dealing with particularly
complex issues about which the
masses may be uninformed. "Your
representative," remarked Burke,
"owes you, not his industry only,
but his judgment; and he betrays,
instead of serving you, if he sacri
fices it to your opinion."
American democracy has gener
ally sought to strike a balance
between these two models, with
each historical era favoring one or
the other to a degree conditioned
by the needs and prevailing tem
perament of the people. The
Framers distrustful of a trustee
like "virtual representation" model
in the British Parliament under
which each Member theoretically
represented the whole Empire but
in reality cared little about the wel
fare of the American colonists
deliberately favored the delegate
model, embedding in our
Constitution an electoral system
whereby each member of Congress
directly represented the interests
of the State from which they hailed.
As concerns about "pork barrel"
spending and distaste for narrow
partisan interests have grown,
however, the trustee model has
swung back into vogue. No longer
is it intellectually fashionable for
senators or representatives to
openly admit to hoarding federal
dollars in their state or district, for
example, although the delegate
model would (and does) encourage
such tactics.
Both models have their advan
tages. American democracy benefits
most when our representatives are
both directly beholden to the wishes
of the people and free to exercise
their own expert judgment on spe
cific issues about which voters know
little or have no clear opinion.
But recent events have made
clear the greatest danger of a dele
gate model run amok: the dumb
ing-down of democracy to the com
monest denominator.
When interviewed by GQ for its
December issue, Florida GOP
Senator Marco Rubio refused to
give a clear answer to the simplest
of questions: "How old do you think
the Earth is?"
"I'm not a scientist, man," replied
Rubio carefully. "I'm not sure we'll
ever be able to answer that. It's one
of the great mysteries."

Let's be clear here. Mr. Rubio is
an intelligent, educated man, and
well aware that the Earth is bil
lions of years old. But in order to
get elected by a crowd of conserva
tive Florida Republicans almost as
old as they think the Earth is in
other words, the constituents he's
supposed to represent he's got
to pretend like he doesn't have a
clue.

Under the limits of a pure dele
gate model, representatives are
required to act as stupid as their
constituents really are. That per
verse constraint on our national
intelligence is the primary subject
of Pennsylvania Governor Ed
Rendell's biting memoir, "A Nation
of Wusses: How America's Leaders
Lost the Guts to Make Us Great."
A discouraging chronicle of "politi
cians pretending to stand on princi
ple while, in fact, pandering to their
bases" and "flip-flopping on issues,
not because of new information, but
because of new polls," "A Nation of
Wusses" exposes an American
political class increasingly willing
to abandon brains and bravery for
political gain, whether on the age of
the Earth or global warming. It's a
sad story of people who know bet
ter deliberately trying not to.
In some sense, a pure delegate
model is the American Dream
materialized a Washington pop
ulated entirely by Mr. Smiths,
average guys and gals just like us.
But such a model also requires
that those average guys and gals
limit themselves to averageness.
To strive for anything more or bet
ter would be to become a trustee,
to use one's own wisdom and expe
rience to serve the public good to
the fullest, and to grow beyond the
confines of the mold imposed by
the unexceptional median voter.
Such a model leaves no room, in
short, for Lincolns politicians
who eschew the safe, easy choices
in favor of what they know to be
right and true.
The question is, do we want our
representatives to serve us best, or
to be us? I'll take the former.

Let Miles know how old you think
the Earth is at milesul @Stanford.
