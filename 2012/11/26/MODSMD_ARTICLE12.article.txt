## ON THE BRINK No. 1 Stanford just two wins from title 
### JANA PERSKY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
According to sophomore Lo'eau Laßonta,
the Stanford women's soccer team is "all fight
ers." It took every ounce of fight within the
Cardinal- along with two second-half goals from
Laßonta-to come back against No. 6 UCLA for
the second time this season, this time in the
NCAA quarterfinals.
With the 2-1 victory, the No. 1 Cardinal (21-
1-1) advanced to its fifth consecutive College
Cup and will look to capture its second consecu
tive national championship next weekend.

Throughout the tournament, the trend for
Stanford has been to grab an early lead and then
ride out the win. On Friday night, the tables were
turned, as it was the Bruins who notched the first
goal. Less than eight minutes into the game,
UCLA sophomore Sam Mewis received a pass
from teammate Sarah Killion and fired a low shot
just inside the post from 25 yards out.
Faced with an early deficit, Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe made several substitutions
in an attempt to find the right combination to
break down the Bruins. Similar to the last
matchup against UCLA, which decided the Pac
-12 title, Stanford began to turn the tide when
senior captain Rachel Quon moved from the
baekline to midfield.
With 12 minutes left in the half, Quon took a
free kick from the left side, senior Mariah
Nogueira's header narrowly missed. Stanford
was also unable to capitalize on two corner kicks

in the final moments of the half.
There was a scary moment for the Cardinal
when Nogueira went down and had to be
replaced after a hard collision 30 seconds before
halftime. However, the captain, who has stalled
every game for Stanford this season, would
return for the second half.
Quon continued to send in dangerous free
kicks and crosses early in the second half.
Foiwards Sydney Payne and Chioma Übogagu
also had opportunities but UCLA goalkeeper
Katelyn Rowland stood tall in net. Prior to this
game, the Bruins had not allowed a goal in the
NCAA tournament.
"UCLAs a fantastic team, and they came
out strong and put us under pressure. I think it
was a big wake-up call for us," Ratcliffe said. "At
halftime, we had to straighten things out and
make a couple of adjustments."
As it has done throughout the season, the
Cardinal took advantage of set plays to get back
into the game. In the 54th minute, Courtney
Verloo swung a corner kick into Payne. The jun
ior crossed the ball to Laßonta, who was wait
ing at the far post to redirect the ball into the
net and tie the game.
"When [Payne] lined up to wind up and take
a shot, I thought 'This is a great goalkeeper-it
may ricochet off her,'" Laßonta said. "Luckily, it
went right to me wide open in front of goal."
According to UCLA coach B.J. Snow, the
Bruins prepared specifically for Stanford's cor
ner kicks. Unfortunately for UCLA, it didn't
pay off as the winning goal also came from a
corner. In the 69th minute, Verloo's kick
bounced off several players from both teams
before arriving at the feet of Laßonta, who was
perfectly positioned once again. The sophomore
slotted the ball home from five yards out for her
second goal of the night and fifth goal of the sea
son.
"We knew we could it," Laßonta said. "I
think they kind of beat us in the first half. They
seemed like they wanted it more, but then we
came back in the second half and we clearly just

dominated that second half. It was great - all
the girls fighting, nobody stopped, they gave
every ounce they could for every second."
After watching the lead slip away for the
second time this season, UCLA fought desper
ately over the final 20 minutes of the game.
Quon once again came up big to clear away a
second-half breakaway. With 12 minutes left in
the game, UCLA earned a dangerous free kick,
but junior goalkeeper Emily Oliver was there
once again to make the save. The Ail-American
made six saves, some of the spectacular variety,
to protect the lead.
"[The seniors] knew we needed to step up
and be leaders on the team," Quon said. "But we
knew we had everybody behind us on the team.
There's 26 other girls on this team and I know
they have our backs. You saw that today -
Lo'eau Laßonta stepped up and put two away.
I'm really happy with the win."
The victory means that this year's senior

class officially ends their careers unbeaten at
Cagan Stadium, as the College Cup will be held
in San Diego. Stanford has not lost at home in
67 games.
"Yeah, I didn't want to jinx [the unbeaten
streak] so I've never spoken about it," Ratcliffe
said. "But in their four-year career, they've
never lost at home. They've never felt the feel
ing of losing here at home, which is truly incred
ible."
The Cardinal will play No. 13 North
Carolina in the NCAA semifinals next Friday,
Nov. 30. The Tar Heels reached the semifinals
by beating BYU 2-1 in double overtime.
Stanford lost to North Carolina 1-0 in the
2009 College Cup final. In the only other
matchup since, the two teams battled to a 2-2 tie
early in the 2010 season.

According to sophomore Lo'eau Laßonta,
the Stanford women's soccer team is "all fight
ers." It took every ounce of fight within the
Cardinal- along with two second-half goals from
Laßonta-to come back against No. 6 UCLA for
the second time this season, this time in the
NCAA quarterfinals.
With the 2-1 victory, the No. 1 Cardinal (21-
1-1) advanced to its fifth consecutive College
Cup and will look to capture its second consecu
tive national championship next weekend.

Throughout the tournament, the trend for
Stanford has been to grab an early lead and then
ride out the win. On Friday night, the tables were
turned, as it was the Bruins who notched the first
goal. Less than eight minutes into the game,
UCLA sophomore Sam Mewis received a pass
from teammate Sarah Killion and fired a low shot
just inside the post from 25 yards out.
Faced with an early deficit, Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe made several substitutions
in an attempt to find the right combination to
break down the Bruins. Similar to the last
matchup against UCLA, which decided the Pac
-12 title, Stanford began to turn the tide when
senior captain Rachel Quon moved from the
baekline to midfield.
With 12 minutes left in the half, Quon took a
free kick from the left side, senior Mariah
Nogueira's header narrowly missed. Stanford
was also unable to capitalize on two corner kicks

in the final moments of the half.
There was a scary moment for the Cardinal
when Nogueira went down and had to be
replaced after a hard collision 30 seconds before
halftime. However, the captain, who has stalled
every game for Stanford this season, would
return for the second half.
Quon continued to send in dangerous free
kicks and crosses early in the second half.
Foiwards Sydney Payne and Chioma Übogagu
also had opportunities but UCLA goalkeeper
Katelyn Rowland stood tall in net. Prior to this
game, the Bruins had not allowed a goal in the
NCAA tournament.
"UCLAs a fantastic team, and they came
out strong and put us under pressure. I think it
was a big wake-up call for us," Ratcliffe said. "At
halftime, we had to straighten things out and
make a couple of adjustments."
As it has done throughout the season, the
Cardinal took advantage of set plays to get back
into the game. In the 54th minute, Courtney
Verloo swung a corner kick into Payne. The jun
ior crossed the ball to Laßonta, who was wait
ing at the far post to redirect the ball into the
net and tie the game.
"When [Payne] lined up to wind up and take
a shot, I thought 'This is a great goalkeeper-it
may ricochet off her,'" Laßonta said. "Luckily, it
went right to me wide open in front of goal."
According to UCLA coach B.J. Snow, the
Bruins prepared specifically for Stanford's cor
ner kicks. Unfortunately for UCLA, it didn't
pay off as the winning goal also came from a
corner. In the 69th minute, Verloo's kick
bounced off several players from both teams
before arriving at the feet of Laßonta, who was
perfectly positioned once again. The sophomore
slotted the ball home from five yards out for her
second goal of the night and fifth goal of the sea
son.
"We knew we could it," Laßonta said. "I
think they kind of beat us in the first half. They
seemed like they wanted it more, but then we
came back in the second half and we clearly just

dominated that second half. It was great - all
the girls fighting, nobody stopped, they gave
every ounce they could for every second."
After watching the lead slip away for the
second time this season, UCLA fought desper
ately over the final 20 minutes of the game.
Quon once again came up big to clear away a
second-half breakaway. With 12 minutes left in
the game, UCLA earned a dangerous free kick,
but junior goalkeeper Emily Oliver was there
once again to make the save. The Ail-American
made six saves, some of the spectacular variety,
to protect the lead.
"[The seniors] knew we needed to step up
and be leaders on the team," Quon said. "But we
knew we had everybody behind us on the team.
There's 26 other girls on this team and I know
they have our backs. You saw that today -
Lo'eau Laßonta stepped up and put two away.
I'm really happy with the win."
The victory means that this year's senior

class officially ends their careers unbeaten at
Cagan Stadium, as the College Cup will be held
in San Diego. Stanford has not lost at home in
67 games.
"Yeah, I didn't want to jinx [the unbeaten
streak] so I've never spoken about it," Ratcliffe
said. "But in their four-year career, they've
never lost at home. They've never felt the feel
ing of losing here at home, which is truly incred
ible."
The Cardinal will play No. 13 North
Carolina in the NCAA semifinals next Friday,
Nov. 30. The Tar Heels reached the semifinals
by beating BYU 2-1 in double overtime.
Stanford lost to North Carolina 1-0 in the
2009 College Cup final. In the only other
matchup since, the two teams battled to a 2-2 tie
early in the 2010 season.
