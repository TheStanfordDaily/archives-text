# New ranking, same result

### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Living up to its brand-new No.
1 ranking, the Stanford women's
basketball team routed Long
Beach State 77-41 at Maples
Pavilion yesterday. The win capped
a perfect Thanksgiving break for
the team, which also swept Baylor,
Hawai'i and Tennessee-Martin a
week ago to win the Jack in the
Box Rainbow Wahine Classic and
take the top-spot in the rankings
from the Bears.

The 71-69 defeat of now-No. 3
Baylor (5-1) marked the second
time in two years that the No. 1
Cardinal (6-0) has snapped the
runaway winning streak of the
nation's then-leading team: the
first time, it halted Connecticut at
90 wins in 2010 and the following
year it held the Bears at 42.
"[That was] a huge win and a def
inite confidence-builder," Stanford
head coach Tara Vanderveer said.
"No one's done it in forty-some
thing games. They're the national
champions and they have the best
player on the planet [Baylor senior
center Brittney Griner], She's phe
nomenal. Our team had to come
out and play with a lot of focus, be
very intense, and we had to make
shots and we did. We had to do
some other things too. I thought it
was a great lesson for our team.'"
Yesterday's contest, only
Stanford's second home game so
far this season, proved to be a
much more one-sided affair as the
49ers (3-3) were no match for the
home team.
The Cardinal raced ahead in
the first period to lead 49-20 at the
half, already posting eight more

points than the 49ers would over
the whole game. Stanford senior
forward Joslyn Tinkle lead the
team with 18 points, followed by
junior forward Chiney Ogwumike,
who grabbed a double-double with
16 points and 11 rebounds. Joining
them in double figures were team
mates sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange and sophomore
forward Taylor Greenfield, with 13
and 11, respectively. Only one
Long Beach State player put up
double-figure points in response,
sophomore guard Alex Sanchez,
with 14.
Orrange scored the first three
Stanford buckets to give her team
an early 7-2 lead and punish
LBSU's opening strategy, which
involved guarding Ogwumike
closely while also preventing the
outside shot. However, this not
only gave Orrange the space to
shoot, but also failed to contain the
rest of the Cardinal offense. By the
end of the first half, Ogwumike had
12 points and her team had hit
seven-of-13 shots from downtown.
"I think it was really important
that Amber came right down,"
Vanderveer said. "They were soft
on her and she just knocked down
her shot right away. She had a
three, Taylor made a couple of
threes, Jos hitting her threes; I
think that was huge. Those were
the kinds of contributions we had
in the Baylor game."
Alongside Orrange and
Ogwumike, Tinkle has become a
crucial threat and cemented her
starting role in her final year on
the Farm. Though Stanford lost a
key player from last season to the
WNBA Draft when Nneka
Ogwumike signed with the LA
Sparks, its offense appears to have
lost little of its production.
"What I like about Jos [is] she
likes to score," Vanderveer said.
