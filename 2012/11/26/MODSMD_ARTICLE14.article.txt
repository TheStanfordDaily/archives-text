## Stanford takes another Pac-12 crown 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
After seeing its 22-game win
streak come to an end, the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team
had to begin anew, starting with its
matchup with UCLA on November
16. Three games and three victories
later, the Cardinal had officially
regained its mojo, ready to take on any
opponent in the NCAA Tournament.
The Cardinal's toughest oppo
nent was the fifth-ranked Bruins
(21-7,13-6 Pac-12), who were clear
ly itching to continue to kick
Stanford (26-3, 18-1) while it was

Stanford was determined not to
let that happen, however, coming
out with five straight points and
grabbing a lead it would not relin
quish, taking the first set 25-22.
Freshman outsider hitter Jordan
Burgess had six kills in the first set
alone. She would finish with 15
total, as well as 11 digs for her tenth
double-double of the season.
The second set paralleled the

first, with the Cardinal starting on a
4-0 ran and cruising to a 25-18 vic
tory. UCLA was clearly not willing
to go down without a fight, however,
coming back at the Cardinal with
authority in the third set. With the
score locked at 11 apiece, the
Bruins went on a dominant 14-4 run
to send the match to a fourth set.
That set was deadlocked from
the start, with neither team able to
gain an advantage over the other.
With the score tied at 25-25,
Stanford struck, and kills from jun
ior outside hitter Rachel Williams
and freshman setter Madi Bugg
closed out the Bruins. With this vic
tory, the Cardinal officially clinched

the Pac-12 title.
Bugg had one of the greatest
performances of her young career,
posting 51 assists, 13 digs, five kills
and two blocks. Williams also had a
terrific game, with a team-high 16
kills on .400 hitting.
Next, Stanford faced Colorado
(14-17, 4-15) on Senior Night in
Maples Pavilion. After honoring the
team's four seniors defensive
specialist Hannah Benjamin, setter
Karissa Cook, outside hitter Hayley
Spelman and middle blocker
Jessica Walker Stanford was
ready to face the Buffaloes.
