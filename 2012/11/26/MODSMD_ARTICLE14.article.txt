## Stanford takes another Pac-12 crown 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
After seeing its 22-game win
streak come to an end, the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team
had to begin anew, starting with its
matchup with UCLA on November
16. Three games and three victories
later, the Cardinal had officially
regained its mojo, ready to take on any
opponent in the NCAA Tournament.
The Cardinal's toughest oppo
nent was the fifth-ranked Bruins
(21-7,13-6 Pac-12), who were clear
ly itching to continue to kick
Stanford (26-3, 18-1) while it was
down and send the Cardinal to its

Stanford was determined not to
let that happen, however, coming
out with five straight points and
grabbing a lead it would not relin
quish, taking the first set 25-22.
Freshman outsider hitter Jordan
Burgess had six kills in the first set
alone. She would finish with 15
total, as well as 11 digs for her tenth
double-double of the season.
The second set paralleled the

first, with the Cardinal starting on a
4-0 ran and cruising to a 25-18 vic
tory. UCLA was clearly not willing
to go down without a fight, however,
coming back at the Cardinal with
authority in the third set. With the
score locked at 11 apiece, the
Bruins went on a dominant 14-4 run
to send the match to a fourth set.
That set was deadlocked from
the start, with neither team able to
gain an advantage over the other.
With the score tied at 25-25,
Stanford struck, and kills from jun
ior outside hitter Rachel Williams
and freshman setter Madi Bugg
closed out the Bruins. With this vic
tory, the Cardinal officially clinched

the Pac-12 title.
Bugg had one of the greatest
performances of her young career,
posting 51 assists, 13 digs, five kills
and two blocks. Williams also had a
terrific game, with a team-high 16
kills on .400 hitting.
Next, Stanford faced Colorado
(14-17, 4-15) on Senior Night in
Maples Pavilion. After honoring the
team's four seniors defensive
specialist Hannah Benjamin, setter
Karissa Cook, outside hitter Hayley
Spelman and middle blocker
Jessica Walker Stanford was
ready to face the Buffaloes.

STANFORD 3
CAL 0
11/21, Berkeley, Calif.
Colorado came out filing, deter
mined to ruin Stanford's big night. In
an offensive battle, Colorado took
the first set 25-21. But Stanford was
n't fazed, downing the Buffaloes 12-
19 in the second set before dominat
ing them in a 25-13 third set victory.
Again forced to go to a fourth set,
the Cardinal didn't flinch, finishing
off Colorado with another solid victo
ry, 25-16. The Cardinal was led on
offense by freshman outside hitter
Brittany Howard, who tied her
career high with 15 kills, while also
contributing nine digs. Cook had a
strong performance on her Senior
Night, with 16 assists and seven digs.
The Cardinal then traveled to
Berkeley for the final game of the

regular season against archrival Cal
(15-14, 9-10). The Golden Bears had
disappointed so far this season, but
still posed a potential problem for the
Cardinal. Stanford, however, was
determined to not close its incredible
season on a loss.

The Cardinal came out hot, with
three straight points to open the first
set. While the Golden Bears were
able to stay competitive, they were
unable to close the early deficit, per
mitting Stanford to cruise to a 25-20
victory for that set.
The second set looked as though
it would go to Cal. The Golden Bears
grabbed an early lead, up by as much
as four over the Cardinal. Stanford
slowly closed the gap, however, grab
bing its first lead of the set on a kill
from junior middle blocker Carly
Wopat at 21-20. Wopat and Williams
then took over to lead Stanford to
victory. Williams added two kills,
Wopat had one and the two combined

for a block to lead a 4-2 ran and take
the second set 25-20.
The Golden Bears appeared com
petitive at the start of the third set as
well, trading points with the
Cardinal until both teams were tied
at 9. Stanford then went on a 6-1 ran,
putting Cal in a hole it would be
unable to climb out of. The Cardinal
took the final set 25-19 to secure its
victory and end its season in fitting
fashion with a sweep.
Stanford received the No. 2 over
all seed in the NCAA Tournament
and the No. 1 seed in the Berkeley
region. The Cardinal and No. 1 Penn
State are the only two teams to
appear in all 32 NCAA Tournaments.
Stanford will open its national cham
pionship quest against Jackson State
(24-11) at 5:30 p.m. on Friday at
Maples Pavilion.
