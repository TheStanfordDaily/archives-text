# CROSS COUNTRY
## Women find the podium 
### NICOLAS SHUMP CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last Saturday, the Cardinal cross
country teams finished their seasons at
the NCAA Championship in Louisville,
with the No. 3 men faltering a bit en
route to a 16th place finish and the No.
4 women finding their way back to the
podium with a third-place effort.
Both races yielded larger than nor
mal fields as 31 teams competed in each
one; the women had 253 finishers and
the men 245. The atmosphere was very
loud as all the fans knew that the entire
season boiled down to this one day.
For the women's race, the favored
teams according to Flotrack were No. 2
Oregon, No. 3 lowa State, No. 1 Florida
State and No. 8 Providence. The actual
finish for the team competition mostly
matched these expectations as the
Ducks won the title with 114 points,
over Providence (183), No. 4 Stanford
(198), Florida State (202) and No. 6
Michigan (247). The emotion for these
runners was readily apparent the
Oregon women cried after hearing they
had unofficially won their school's
third-ever national title in them team
tent.
But this meet had a bizarre contro
versy over the women's team results.
After hearing they had unofficially
won, the Oregon women were later told
that Providence had beaten them by
six points. Because this result did not
make sense to former coach Vin
Lananna, the Ducks pressed their case
to find out they did indeed win. The
problem was that, for whatever reason,
Oregon senior Alexi Pappas who fin
ished eighth overall had been left
out of the results.
The Oregon coach was not shy in
her displeasure with the organizers,
telling Flotrack that the NCAA was
way out of line. "Seriously? Like really,
cross country? Really? This is what we
do? This is how we determine a nation
al, state championship?"
The individual competition was
about as exciting as any racing fan
could hope for, as lowa State senior
Betsy Saina, Oregon senior Jordan
Hasay and Dartmouth junior Abbey
D'Agostino were dead even going into
the final stretch. Saina won the sprint,
finishing in 19:27.9, and D'Agostino
beat Hasay by less than one-tenth of a
second as both women finished in
19:28.6.
Stanford made it to the podium, led
by its trio of All-Americans, sophomore
Aisling Cuffe 21st in 20:03.8, senior
Kathy Rroeger 24th in 20:05 and fresh
man Cayla Hatton 28th in 20:06.2.
Kroeger had been with the leaders for
the first half of the race but was
dropped by the lead group as those
women ran a faster second half of the
race. The Cardinal women were round
ed out by junior Jessica Tonn 43rd in
20:18.9, senior Justine Fedronic
150 th in 21:05.5, sophomore Julia
Foster 161 st in 21:11.9 and fresh
man Megan Lacy 189 th in 21:27.5.
For the men's race, the favored
teams according to Flotrack were
No. 1 Oklahoma State, No. 7
Colorado, No. 3 Stanford and No. 4
Wisconsin. But the actual results
had several surprise performances.
No. 1 Oklahoma State did win easi
ly, with four runners in the top 24
and a total of 72 points, over defend
ing champion Wisconsin (135),
Colorado (158), No. 10 Northern
Arizona (191) and No. 18 Florida
State (238). The Cowboy men also
expressed their emotion after win
ning by chanting "O-S-U."
There was no result controversy
for the men's 10K and the individ
ual race was not as close, but it was
thrilling for a different reason.
Early on, Texas Tech junior
Kennedy Kithuka broke away with
the dominant Arizona duo of senior
Stephen Sambu and sophomore
Lawi Lalang. But for the first time
in his career, Lalang did not win.
Kithuka captured the national title
with a course record time of 28:31.3
over Sambu in 28:38.6 and Lalang
28:51.8.
Stanford was not able to have
its best performance at this meet,
as the Cardinal placed 16th as a
team. The Rosa twins ran toward
the front early but faded later in
the race. So, unlike the women,
they had no top-40 individual fin
ishers, with no one earning the dis

tinction of Ail-American. The
Cardinal's six runners finished
within a minute of each other.
Senior Benjamin Johnson led
them with a 48th-place finish in
30:15.9, sophomore Erik Olson was
87th in 30:37.3, sophomore Joe
Rosa 112 th in 30:51.2, junior Tyler
Stutzman 137 th in 31:02.5, senior
Miles Unterreiner 140 th in 31:03.2
and sophomore Jim Rosa 167 th in
31:16.7.
Both Stanford teams had solid
seasons overall, although the men's
results at the NCAA Championship
were not what the Cardinal run
ners had expected. The cross coun
try season is over, so the men and
women will have to wait until
indoor track and field begins on
Jan. 12 to get back into competition.
