# BRUINS IN RUINS
## Card to host Pac-12 Championship 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
A decade ago, it took three seasons
for Stanford to amass ten wins.
During those three miserable years,
the Cardinal never finished higher
than eighth out of the ten teams in the
Pac-10. Nineteen losses in conference
play. Twenty-three total defeats.
Those were the kinds of numbers that
defined the program.

The juxtaposition of then and
now is striking.
No. 8 Stanford (10-2,8-1) dominat
ed No. 16 UCLA (9-3, 6-3) 35-17 on
Saturday at the Rose Bowl Stadium
en route to clinching the coveted Pac
-12 North Division title and an
unprecedented three consecutive 10-
win seasons. With the victory, the
Cardinal earned the right to host the
Pac-12 Championship Game in this
Friday night's rematch and now
stands one win away from receiving
an invitation back to Pasadena's hal
lowed Rose Bowl gates.
Despite the fact that an Oregon
loss would have automatically given
Stanford a spot in the conference
championship, the players weren't
scoreboard-watching prior to their
battle with the Bruins. Stepfan Taylor,
Usua Amanam and Jordan Richards
all shook their heads in the postgame
conference when asked if they knew
Oregon had won before coming out to
the field. Kevin Hogan claimed that he

didn't even know what time the game
was.
"Didn't watch the game," head
coach David Shaw said, referring to
the Oregon-Oregon State contest.
"Didn't think that was important. The
only thing that matters is what hap
pens on our field. We tried to control

that, and our guys did a good job
today."
The Cardinal got off to a torrid
start on its opening drive of the game
with Taylor carrying the ball six
times, one of which was a draw play on
third-and-long that tm-ned into a 19-
yard gain. Facing a critical third-and

four, Hogan rolled out to his right to
find a wide-open Drew Terrell in the
end zone for an 11-yard touchdown
that emphatically capped an 11-play,
75-yard drive.
But UCLA answered right back.
Quarterback Brett Hundley
slipped a couple would-be tacklers to

connect with wide receiver Shaquelle
Evans for a 71-yard pickup. Two play
ers later, the redshirt freshman
escaped a blitz to deliver an accurate
throw to tight end Joseph Fauria, who
out-jumped cornerback Alex Carter

Stanford running back Stepfan Taylor (33) dives into the endzone with a 1 -yard touchdown run against UCLA on Saturday, Nov. 24, 2012, at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. Stanford knocked off the host Bruins, 35-17.
to come down with the 13-yard score.
"He's so athletic," Shaw said of Hundley.
"He gets out of trouble and he's so slippery.
There's a couple times where we got him sacked
and he got out of it. They have some dangerous
weapons. If you give that quarterback too much
time he's going to find them and he found a few
tonight."

Both Stanford and UCLA cooled down con
siderably on offense after their successful first
possessions and proceeded to trade a few three
and-outs with each other. Although it con
ceded a couple big plays early in the game, the
Cardinal defense impressively shut down star
running back Jonathan Franklin, holding the
redshirt senior to just 65 yards on 21 carries.
Stanford has limited two Doak Walker finalists,
Franklin and Kenjon Barner, to a combined 131
rushing yards in back-to-back weeks. With
another victory over the Bruins this Friday
night, it's possible that the Cardinal will face
Wisconsin's Montee Ball, the third and last
Doak Walker finalist, in the Rose Bowl.
Stanford's offense regained its rhythm early
in the second quarter. Hogan completed three
passes for first downs and improvised a 16-yard
scramble before the speedy Anthony Wilkerson
punched it in from ten yards on out to give the
Cardinal a 14-7 lead.
Following yet another fruitless Bruins pos
session, Taylor busted through a small gap for a
49-yard touchdown less than two minutes later
to extend Stanford's lead to two touchdowns.
"[Taylor] makes things a whole lot easier for
me when he's chipping away and breaks out
those long runs like he did tonight," said Hogan,
who finished the game 15-of-22 passing for 160
yards and a touchdown. "When he gets yards
and first downs, that opens up the passing
game. But we're run-first and having a guy like
Stepfan makes it a lot easier."
The Cardinal's worst play of the game came
on special teams with less than five minutes left
in the first half, when a short snap from Reed
Miller resulted in punter Daniel Zychlinski
receiving a hit hard from Anthony Barr and
fumbling the ball at the Stanford 22-yard line.
Doubtful to play in Friday's rematch,
Zychlinski would leave the game in a sling.
But the defense did more than just hold the
Bruins, pushing them back 18 yards before
Ka'imi Fairbairn bailed his team out with a 48-
yard field goal.
UCLA's offense continued to struggle in the
third quarter, failing to cross midfield on its first
three drives. When Hundley tried to force a
throw on third-and-nine in Bruins territory,
safety Jordan Richards made him pay with an
acrobatic interception.
"I saw the quarterback scramble to his right

and I saw the receiver come back across from
the field, so I just broke on it," Richards com
mented. "The ball came and I just tried to get
my hands on it and take it to the ground with
me."
Three straight handoffs to Taylor was all it
took for the Cardinal to capitalize off the
turnover and see its lead increase to 28-10 mid
way through the third. The senior running back
rushed for 142 yards on just 20 carries and also
scored twice before Shaw yanked him out
before the fourth quarter to keep his legs fresh
for Friday. With two guaranteed games left,
Taylor is 35 yards shy of Darrin Nelson's all
time Stanford rushing record.
"Other [running backs] in other places get
more publicity," Shaw said. "It's a shame hon
estly that he's not on the Doak Walker list. I
think that's kind of ridiculous. [Taylor] is as
good as anybody in the country. He may not be
as flashy as other people, but he's special with
the ball."
If the game wasn't sealed after Taylor's 1-
yard touchdown, then the ensuing kickoff cer
tainly put the nail in UCLAs coffin. Special
teams veteran Alex Debniak knocked the ball
out from kick returner Kenneth Walker before
Usua Amanam picked it up. Displaying his
skills as a former running back, Amanam ran 20
yards laterally and staved off a strip attempt to
reach the end zone.
Franklin scored on an 11-yard touchdown
run before the fourth quarter, but UCLA's
attempted comeback would end there. As
advertised, Hundley who finished the game 20-
of-38 passing for 261 yards, managed to evade a
few sacks by extending plays with his feet.
However, he still couldn't avoid seven of them.
The Cardinal defense has racked up 53 sacks so
far this season, breaking the school record of 48
that was set by the Rose Bowl team in 1999.
After upsetting then-No. 2 Oregon 17-14 in
overtime last weekend, the big question was
whether if the Stanford players could keep
their emotions in check and shift their focus to
the Bruins. The final score convincingly
answered that question.
"We knew the situation and what got us
here," Taylor said. "We try not to look back at
the game from last week, win or loss. We just
want to focus on the game ahead because
[UCLA] deserved our attention. Every game is
important. We have a mature enough team to
be able to go out there and focus on the team
ahead."
Stanford hosts UCLA for a rematch on
Friday night in the Cardinal's first Pac-12
Championship appearance.
