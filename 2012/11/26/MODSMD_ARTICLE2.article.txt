# BRUINS IN RUINS
## Card to host Pac-12 Championship 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
A decade ago, it took three seasons
for Stanford to amass ten wins.
During those three miserable years,
the Cardinal never finished higher
than eighth out of the ten teams in the
Pac-10. Nineteen losses in conference
play. Twenty-three total defeats.
Those were the kinds of numbers that
defined the program.

The juxtaposition of then and
now is striking.
No. 8 Stanford (10-2,8-1) dominat
ed No. 16 UCLA (9-3, 6-3) 35-17 on
Saturday at the Rose Bowl Stadium
en route to clinching the coveted Pac
-12 North Division title and an
unprecedented three consecutive 10-
win seasons. With the victory, the
Cardinal earned the right to host the
Pac-12 Championship Game in this
Friday night's rematch and now
stands one win away from receiving
an invitation back to Pasadena's hal
lowed Rose Bowl gates.
Despite the fact that an Oregon
loss would have automatically given
Stanford a spot in the conference
championship, the players weren't
scoreboard-watching prior to their
battle with the Bruins. Stepfan Taylor,
Usua Amanam and Jordan Richards
all shook their heads in the postgame
conference when asked if they knew
Oregon had won before coming out to
the field. Kevin Hogan claimed that he

didn't even know what time the game
was.
"Didn't watch the game," head
coach David Shaw said, referring to
the Oregon-Oregon State contest.
"Didn't think that was important. The
only thing that matters is what hap
pens on our field. We tried to control

that, and our guys did a good job
today."
The Cardinal got off to a torrid
start on its opening drive of the game
with Taylor carrying the ball six
times, one of which was a draw play on
third-and-long that tm-ned into a 19-
yard gain. Facing a critical third-and

four, Hogan rolled out to his right to
find a wide-open Drew Terrell in the
end zone for an 11-yard touchdown
that emphatically capped an 11-play,
75-yard drive.
But UCLA answered right back.
Quarterback Brett Hundley
slipped a couple would-be tacklers to

connect with wide receiver Shaquelle
Evans for a 71-yard pickup. Two play
ers later, the redshirt freshman
escaped a blitz to deliver an accurate
throw to tight end Joseph Fauria, who
out-jumped cornerback Alex Carter
