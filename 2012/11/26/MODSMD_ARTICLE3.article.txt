## Protecting Stanford's brand name Restrictions on usage of name, trademarks extensive 
### MARY HARRISON STAFF WRITER 
A bartending service, a Japanese
memory foam mattress company
and many a Chinese tutoring service
once had one thing in common
their use of Stanford's name to sell
their product. After enforcement
action by the Stanford Office of the
General Counsel, all of these compa
nies stopped their improper use of
Stanford trademarks, but the
University deals with similar cases
on an almost daily basis.
According to the Administrative
Guide to Ownership of Stanford
Name and Trademarks, Stanford's
trademarked names and symbols
may only be used for activities that
are directly sponsored or sanctioned
by the University or if there is a
licensing contract in place.
The University owns several
trademarks, which are registered
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. These include the names
"Stanford" and "Stanford
University Medical Center," as well
as the block "S" with tree and the
Stanford University seal.
Stanford also closely monitors
how films and photographers use its
lands. Whether it is a wedding pho
tographer or the crew of "The
Internship," a film starring Owen
Wilson and Vince Vaughn that filmed
on campus over the summer, the
photographer or filmmaker must get
express permission from the Office
of University Communications.
In the past few years, tutoring
companies in Asia, particularly in
China, have become frequent offend
ers of improperly using Stanford's
name. These companies will claim to
have a connection to Stanford and
use the University's name or logo in
its marketing materials, leading
some students to believe that the
company holds some sort of sway
with the admissions office, according
to Steve Rosen, senior university
counsel.

While the University has taken
steps to protect its brand by trade
marking its name in Chinese charac
ters, enforcing trademark rules is
substantially more difficult in Asia
because of differences in legal
processes, a problem that almost
every university and corporation
that does business in China faces,
according to Rosen.
Susan Weinstein, university pri
vacy officer and assistant vice presi

dent for business development, said
the University tries to prevent enti
ties from using Stanford's name for
commercial purposes.
"The first question we ask is, 'Are
they trying to trade on Stanford's
reputation in order to make
money?"' Weinstein said.
In order for the use of Stanford's
trademarks to be considered appro
priate, it must be accurate, meaning
that it must actually be associated
with Stanford. It also must be quali
ty, meaning that it must be used in
connection with activities that meet
Stanford's educational standards
and goals.
In certain circumstances outlined
by the Administrative Guide, the
University will approve the commer
cial use of our name or emblems.
This includes the University's con
tract with Nike, for example.
When deciding to grant a license,
her office considers whether the
item reflects well on the University,
Weinstein said. She gave the exag

gerated examples of headstones and
toilet seat covers as items that would
probably not "reflect well" on the
University.
The University does have a
licensing deal with a company called
Hanky Panky, which sells under
wear featuring the Stanford logo.
Stanford has several ways to find
out about improper use of trade
marks, including a contract with the
Collegiate Licensing Company
(CLC), a company used by many
high-profile colleges. Stanford also
uses subscription services that alert
administrators when someone regis
ters one of the University's trade
marks or a domain name that
includes "Stanford," according to
Weinstein.
In addition to formal services like
CLC, Stanford also counts on the
vigilance of the Stanford community
in reporting questionable uses of
Stanford's name and logo.
According to Weinstein, alums,
staff, faculty and students will some

times report a use of the Stanford
name that "strikes them as odd."
Her office then investigates and
passes the matter along to the Office
of the General Counsel for enforce
ment action if the use is found to be
improper.
Rosen said that when a company
is found to be wrongly using
Stanford's name or marks, the
University sends a cease-and-desist
letter asking that they stop their
improper use.
While many entities misuse
Stanford's name or image, Rosen
said that the most common type of
misuse is probably by "innocent
users" of the University's trade
marks.
"People will write on their web
site, 'This is something I did at
Stanford,' which suggests that
they did research at Stanford or
that Stanford faculty was involved
when in fact the only thing that
was done was some project on the
side while they were at Stanford,"

Rosen said.
Similar to other institutions that
offer educational services, the
University is especially diligent in
making sure uses of Stanford's
name and marks are proper. If they
did not, there could be significant
confusion or misrepresentation that
would reflect poorly on the universi
ty and could cause harm to cus
tomers, according to Weinstein.
Both Rosen and Weinstein said
that Stanford monitors the use of its
name both for its own protection, but
also for the protection of consumers.
"It's really as much a consumer
protection measure as it is a protec
tion for companies who invest in
their marks," Rosen said.
Rosen said that trademarks are a
way for the consumer to ensure that
the product they are buying is of the
quality that they expect from, in this
case, Stanford University.

University is especially diligent in
making sure uses of Stanford's
name and marks are proper. If they
did not, there could be significant
confusion or misrepresentation that
would reflect poorly on the universi
ty and could cause harm to cus
tomers, according to Weinstein.
Both Rosen and Weinstein said
that Stanford monitors the use of its
name both for its own protection, but
also for the protection of consumers.
"It's really as much a consumer
protection measure as it is a protec
tion for companies who invest in
their marks," Rosen said.
Rosen said that trademarks are a
way for the consumer to ensure that
the product they are buying is of the
quality that they expect from, in this
case, Stanford University.

A bartending service, a Japanese
memory foam mattress company
and many a Chinese tutoring service
once had one thing in common
their use of Stanford's name to sell
their product. After enforcement
action by the Stanford Office of the
General Counsel, all of these compa
nies stopped their improper use of
Stanford trademarks, but the
University deals with similar cases
on an almost daily basis.
According to the Administrative
Guide to Ownership of Stanford
Name and Trademarks, Stanford's
trademarked names and symbols
may only be used for activities that
are directly sponsored or sanctioned
by the University or if there is a
licensing contract in place.
The University owns several
trademarks, which are registered
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. These include the names
"Stanford" and "Stanford
University Medical Center," as well
as the block "S" with tree and the
Stanford University seal.
Stanford also closely monitors
how films and photographers use its
lands. Whether it is a wedding pho
tographer or the crew of "The
Internship," a film starring Owen
Wilson and Vince Vaughn that filmed
on campus over the summer, the
photographer or filmmaker must get
express permission from the Office
of University Communications.
In the past few years, tutoring
companies in Asia, particularly in
China, have become frequent offend
ers of improperly using Stanford's
name. These companies will claim to
have a connection to Stanford and
use the University's name or logo in
its marketing materials, leading
some students to believe that the
company holds some sort of sway
with the admissions office, according
to Steve Rosen, senior university
counsel.

While the University has taken
steps to protect its brand by trade
marking its name in Chinese charac
ters, enforcing trademark rules is
substantially more difficult in Asia
because of differences in legal
processes, a problem that almost
every university and corporation
that does business in China faces,
according to Rosen.
Susan Weinstein, university pri
vacy officer and assistant vice presi

dent for business development, said
the University tries to prevent enti
ties from using Stanford's name for
commercial purposes.
"The first question we ask is, 'Are
they trying to trade on Stanford's
reputation in order to make
money?"' Weinstein said.
In order for the use of Stanford's
trademarks to be considered appro
priate, it must be accurate, meaning
that it must actually be associated
with Stanford. It also must be quali
ty, meaning that it must be used in
connection with activities that meet
Stanford's educational standards
and goals.
In certain circumstances outlined
by the Administrative Guide, the
University will approve the commer
cial use of our name or emblems.
This includes the University's con
tract with Nike, for example.
When deciding to grant a license,
her office considers whether the
item reflects well on the University,
Weinstein said. She gave the exag

gerated examples of headstones and
toilet seat covers as items that would
probably not "reflect well" on the
University.
The University does have a
licensing deal with a company called
Hanky Panky, which sells under
wear featuring the Stanford logo.
Stanford has several ways to find
out about improper use of trade
marks, including a contract with the
Collegiate Licensing Company
(CLC), a company used by many
high-profile colleges. Stanford also
uses subscription services that alert
administrators when someone regis
ters one of the University's trade
marks or a domain name that
includes "Stanford," according to
Weinstein.
In addition to formal services like
CLC, Stanford also counts on the
vigilance of the Stanford community
in reporting questionable uses of
Stanford's name and logo.
According to Weinstein, alums,
staff, faculty and students will some

times report a use of the Stanford
name that "strikes them as odd."
Her office then investigates and
passes the matter along to the Office
of the General Counsel for enforce
ment action if the use is found to be
improper.
Rosen said that when a company
is found to be wrongly using
Stanford's name or marks, the
University sends a cease-and-desist
letter asking that they stop their
improper use.
While many entities misuse
Stanford's name or image, Rosen
said that the most common type of
misuse is probably by "innocent
users" of the University's trade
marks.
"People will write on their web
site, 'This is something I did at
Stanford,' which suggests that
they did research at Stanford or
that Stanford faculty was involved
when in fact the only thing that
was done was some project on the
side while they were at Stanford,"

Rosen said.
