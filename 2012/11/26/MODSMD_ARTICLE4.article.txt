## Two students win Rhodes 
### NITISH KULKARNI KURT CHIRBAS 
Margaret Hayden 'l3 and Rachel
Kolb 'l2 M.A. 'l3 were named
Rhodes Scholars-elect this year. The
prestigious Rhodes Scholarship,
established in 1902, funds up to
three years of study at the
University of Oxford in England.
The Rhodes Trust announced the 32
U.S. Rhodes Scholars-elect on Nov.
17. The 2013 Scholars-elect will
begin studies at Oxford in the fall of
2013.
According to The Rhodes Trust,
1700 U.S. students began the appli
cation process this year and 838
were endorsed by their universities
to advance to the interview round
with their districts' selection com
mittees. This year; 29 Stanford stu
dents applied for endorsement. The
University does not release the
number of endorsed applicants.
Both Stanford scholars-elect
highlighted theii' high school teach
ers' role in their success and advised
future applicants to apply even if
they don't believe they have a
chance.
'I almost fell out of my chair'
"It all started over the summer.
That's when I decided to apply,"
Hayden said. "I didn't go into this
expecting to win or anything. Really,
I thought, at the very least, it might
be good practice for doing inter
views and writing personal state
ments."
But after a lengthy interview
process during the weekend before
Thanksgiving, Hayden was named
one of the two Rhodes Scholars from
District 1.
"I didn't know what to do. I had
my congratulatory smile for some
one else all ready, I almost fell out of
my chair", she said, describing the
moment she found out she had won
the scholarship. "I got up and
walked to the door, and waited for
the other winner to walk out of the
room."
The interviews, held in the office
of a New York law firm, were the cul

mination of months of effort.
"The interviews were really
intense one of [the interviewers]
would ask me a question, then some
one else would interrupt and ask
their own. [There were] seven inter
viewers in a panel, all facing you
from at a round table," Hayden said.
Hayden was one of 12 finalists
from her district, which includes
Maine, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.
On Friday evening, the finalists
attended a cocktail party. The next
day, interviews took place from the
morning until around 4:30 p.m, but
each interview was only about 25
minutes long. All the finalists sat in a
common room waiting for their first
interview. Only five, including
Hayden, were called back for a sec
ond interview.
"In the end, after all the inter
views were over, all of the interview
ers came into the room together
when we saw them we knew it was
done," she said.
But when she heard her own
name, Hayden was shocked.
"As we [Hayden and Phillip Zao,
the other district Scholar-elect]
walked into the hallway, he looked at
me and said that he didn't know
what to do," she said.

Hayden emphasized her high
school teachers' role in her success.
"I'm from a small town and I
went to a public high school," she
said. "I had great teachers in high
school... there are so many teachers
I'd like to thank, I don't know where
to begin."
Hayden also credited the
University's help throughout the
Rhodes process.
A human biology major,
Hayden's honors thesis in the
Program in Ethics and Society deals
with the "ethical implications of bio
logical conceptions of mental illness
and personhood." Hayden is a mem
ber of the varsity squash team and
the varsity sailing team. She plans
on pursuing a master's degree in
medical anthropology at Oxford.
As for advice for future Stanford
applicants, Hayden encouraged stu
dents to apply, even with low expec
tations.
"Don't count yourselves out! I
went into this not expecting to win
anything, but in the end I did. I am
still very much shocked by this
whole thing."
'Don't rule anything out'
Rachel Kolb, a co-terminal mas
ter's degree student in English and

an avid writer and equestrian, was
equally shocked when she was
named a Rhodes Scholar. She plans
to study contemporary literature,
English literature from 1900 to the
present, at Oxford.
As an undergraduate, she partic
ipated in the Bing Overseas Study
Program study-abroad program at
Oxford, and part of the reason she
applied for the Rhodes was to
return. It will be, for her, away to go
back to an education system "much
more centered on individually-driv
en work."
"As an English major and stu
dent of English literature, couldn't
ask for a better place to study litera
ture than Oxford," she said.
She praised the University's help
in interview preparation.
"Stanford was really supportive,"
she said. "John Pearson [director of
the Bechtel International Center]
was so instrumental throughout the
whole process. [Bechtel] gives you
many resources along the way, from
hosting speakers to having Q&A
sessions and practice interviews
before the real thing."
The Rhodes Trust allowed Kolb
to use a sign interpreter during her
interview, as she has profound hear
ing loss. She was one of the two final
