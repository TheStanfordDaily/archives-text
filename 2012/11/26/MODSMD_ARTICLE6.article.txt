## Grads teach coding to high schoolers 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As undergraduates, Jeremy Keeshin 'l2 M.S. 'l2
and Zach Galant 'l2 M.S. 'l2 taught introductory com
puter science to their peers as teaching assistants in the
perpetually overenrolled CSIO6A. But after graduat
ing, they decided to take their teaching to a younger
group: high school students.
"We want to make the issue of computer education
in high schools a national issue," Keeshin, co-founder of
the CodeHS computer science education platform, said.
"I think this is an issue that a lot of people can get inter
ested in."
While an education in computer science remains
extremely popular at Stanford, where it is the most pop
ular undergraduate major, and in Silicon Valley as a
whole, Keeshin and Galant launched CodeHS in an
effort to address what they saw as a critical lack in cod
ing literacy among high school students.
"We just see it as a very, very underserved area right
no\y" Keeshin said, noting that only 5 percent of high
schools nationally offer Advanced Placement courses in
computer science.
Keeshin also criticized the vocational nature of exist
ing computer science education programs, claiming that
CodeHS offers a more broadly applicable approach to
the subject.
"That [vocational approach] doesn't really educate
people on the fundamentals in the right way," Keeshin
said. "We can introduce [them] in high school in a fun
way, in away that's really about learning in the right
way."
CodeHS, which uses short online videos to explain
concepts to students, was launched last year and since
then has mostly been utilized in summer programs and
an after-school initiative in East Palo Alto. Keeshin
expressed optimism for future growth in the site's use,
noting that CodeHS' use of Javascript makes the plat

form more accessible through common web browsers.
"The way it works in web browsers makes it really
easy to get started," Keeshin asserted. "What's really
important [though] is that it's not about the program
language. It's more about the problem solving and the
syntax of language."
Part of the potential for increased CodeHS usage
lies in the founders' recently-launched CSinHS crowd
funding campaign. The fundraising effort aims to raise
$lOO,OOO in order to teach 1,000 high school students the
fundamentals of computer science.
While the CSinHS campaign has a significant way to
go before reaching its iundraising target—in just over a
week and with four more to go, the campaign has raised
just over $lO,OO0 —Keeshin said CodeHS has several
unique features, such as access online tutoring as a unique
feature.
"When you get stuck, you can ask a question, you
can send a message to a tutor," Keeshin said. "They give
you feedback, they help your program... That doesn't
exist on any [other] website right now."
Keeshin framed the focus on educating high school
students as a means of simply keeping up with interna
tional competitors and of contributing to renewed eco
nomic growth and employment within the United
States.
"There's a very clear path we can take to improve
education around the country [and] address some of the
job issues," Keeshin said, noting that on an annual basis
the number of jobs created in computer science exceed
the number of computer science graduates by 100,000.
"It's really obvious that this is where we're going and
that this is an important skill," Keeshin said. "People use
computers every day but don't understand what they're
doing... If we can do something to kick-start this, that's
a real change we can make."
