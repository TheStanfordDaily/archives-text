## Stanford wins $10.4 million grant for local trails 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors awarded $10.4 million to
the City of Palo Alto and Stanford
University in a unanimous vote on Nov.
20. The funding will be used to con
struct a bicycle bridge across U.S.
Route 101 at Adobe Creek and to
improve recreational trails that sur
round the University.
The board approved three projects
from a five-project proposal jointly sub
mitted by Stanford University and the
City of Palo Alto for an interconnected
trail network. The proposal was backed
by local law enforcement, Palo Alto
Unified School District and a number of
area businesses.
Stanford plans to use $4.5 million for
the new Stanford Perimeter Trail,
which stretches along Junipero Serra
Boulevard, Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real. The trail will be designat
ed for public use.
Additionally, $1.5 million will be used
to extend the bike and pedestrian path
along the Matadero Creek levee and $4
million for the design phase of the Adobe
Creek overpass bicycle bridge. The
board also approved $400,000 for exten
sions to the Ravenswood Bay Trail, to be
completed by the Midpeninsula Regional
Open Space district.
The decision ended a 12-year debate

over the trails that started in 2000 when
Santa Clara County issued a new
General Use Permit (GUP) to Stanford
allowing the University over two million
square feet in new and expanded build
ings. The agreement required Stanford
to build trails, one in Santa Clara
County and the other in San Mateo
County, to compensate for the potential
loss in recreation opportunities result
ant from the new developments.
In December 2011, the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors rejected
Stanford's offer to improve the Lower
Alpine Trail, which reverted Stanford's
$10.4 GUP payment to Santa Clara
County. The County then established a
grant program through which govern
ment agencies and nonprofits could
submit proposals for recreational
opportunities using the funds.
President of Stanford Campus
Residential Leaseholders James
Sweeney Ph.D '7l, Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2, Palo Alto Vice
Mayor Greg Scharff and Palo Alto School
Board President Camille Townsend
cosigned a Nov. 2 open letter to the com
munity that encouraged people to contact
the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors to
support the University's proposal.
"The Palo Alto and Stanford pro
posal alone of all the proposals sub
mitted would provide immediate
recreational opportunities to precisely
the population for whom these funds
were intended to serve," the letter said.
The University will hold three com
munity meetings to discuss the
approved Perimeter Trails.
