# SPORTS BRIEF
## Zychlinksi doubtful for Pac-12 Championship, Stephens not sure 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford continues to
climb in the national polls
after earning its spot in the
Pac-12 Championship game
with a win over UCLA last
night, rising to No. 8 in the
AP poll, No. 9 in the coaches'
poll and possibly all the way
up to No. 6 in the BCS when
the standings are released
tonight. But some injury con
cerns remain for the
Cardinal, particularly with
the rematch against the
Bruins just five days away.
The status of nose tackle

Terrence Stephens, who
missed last night's game due
to a "personal matter," is still
unclear. After the game,
Stanford coach David Shaw
said that Stephens might not
return against the Bruins.
However, his backup, David
Parry, played quite well last
night, as did Josh Mauro in
some limited time at the posi
tion.
Punter Daniel Zychlinski
was knocked out of the
UCLA game after taking a
vicious hit on a muffed punt
and he seems doubtful to
return against the Bruins.
The fifth-year senior has
been really dialing it in of
late, pinning Oregon inside

its own 10-yard line several
times and booming a couple
of punts to change the field
position in last week's upset
of the Ducks. He was seen
leaving the field with his
right arm in a sling.
If he is unable to return,
junior backup Ben Rhyne will
take over the punting duties.
Rhyne hit his first career punt
in the second half against the
Bruins, and would take over
holding duties for the field
goal unit in Zychlinski's
absence. He was the holder on
Jordan Williamson's 45-yard
attempt last night that hit the
crossbar.
