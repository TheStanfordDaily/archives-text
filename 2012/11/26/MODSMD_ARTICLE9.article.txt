## Do You MIND? Why I care about Israel's occupation of Palestine 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
From my writing and activism
over the past few weeks, some
students have asked why I am
so interested in the illegal American-
Israeli occupation of Palestine.
It seems as though it is weird for
me to be concerned about the interna
tional human rights conflict in which I
am most heavily implicated in—both
as an American citizen and as a
Stanford student.
Underlying the US-Israeli occupa
tion of Palestine are issues of grave
importance to me:
State, police and military surveil
lance and control of marginalized
people and dissenting voices; the
immorality of global markets where
multinational companies profit off of
human rights violations at home and
abroad without accountability; and a
future where marginalized people of
any background do not have to worry
about discrimination, persecution and
dehumanization at the hand of the
nation-state or corporations.
As a member of the African diaspo
ra I have a direct connection to all of
these issues.
The mothers of the mothers of my
mothers were torn away from their
lands, cut off from their languages, his
tories and cultures to become "tools"
and "things" on this soil all in the
interest of economically supporting a
growing "democracy"
The fathers of the fathers of my
fathers have been controlled by state
sanctioned fear and police brutality
since they were first forcibly taken
here first as runaway slaves, then
as Emmett Till and now as Amadou
Diallo, Sean Bell and lhayvon Martin
all in the interest of maintaining the
economic, political and social order of
this nation.
Throughout American history,
blacks seeking equal rights or libera
tion have been labeled "agitators,"
"criminals," "militants," "combatants"
and "the greatest threat to the inter
nal security of the United States," all
for demanding to be treated like any
other human.
The narrative that this country has
been built off the backs of our ances
tors and that this country is very
quick to forget its racist past and pres
ent —runs parallel to the history of
dehumanization, criminalization and
military-state control of Native
Americans.
Coming from this background, I
feel compelled to speak out against
similar forms of oppression this state
perpetrates against other minority
groups. I feel especially compelled to
speak when the nation that supports
Israel's right to defend itself against
an oppressed minority group has
always predicated its success upon the
oppression of some minority group.
Just as this state has blanket
labeled Native Americans "savages,"
blacks "subhuman," the Japanese
"enemies," undocumented migrants
"illegal," and anyone brown and non-
Judeo-Christian "terrorist," so too is
the state of Israel justifying its dehu
manization, oppression and murder of
Palestinians by blanket-labeling a pop
ulation of 1.7 million people "combat
ants" or "collateral" in the pursuit of
said "militants."
The 34 children and 13 women
Israeli forces killed last week were not
terrorists. The 970 civilians Israeli
forces injured last week are not terror
ists.
As in the past, apathy indifference
or lack of education support a violent
and oppressive status quo that violates
international humanitarian law in

Palestine.
Fhrthermore, at stake in the multi
billion-dollar American-Israeli occupa
tion of Palestine are contemporary
issues that I and many other Stanford
students care about, including the
increase of racial profiling, police bru
tality against nonviolent political dissi
dents, American immigration policy
and the welfare of the global poor.
The Oakland police that used rub
ber bullets, tear gas, shot and critical
ly injured an Iraq War veteran during
the Occupy movement were trained a
month before alongside Israeli police.
The NYPD, which has been racially
profiling Muslim and Arab citizens
since 9/11 has been modeled on tech
niques Israeli forces use in the West
Bank. Over 9,000 local, state and fed
eral law enforcement officials have
participated in Israeli-led training
sessions that have led to increasingly
militaristic surveillance and police
control in airports, malls and cities
across the nation.
Parts of the "separation wall" along
the US-Mexico border are contracted
by the same company that built the
apartheid wall, which violates interna
tional human rights law, in Israel.
The state of Israel has provided
Brazil and other Latin American
countries with hundreds of millions of
dollars in drones for police surveil
lance. Brazil claims to use these
drones for "counterterrorism" and
"drug trafficking", but Brazil has also
labeled the slum dwellers living in
shacks near the site of the 2014 World
Cup stadium "criminals" to justify
police brutality to evict these people.
The Fl6s and missiles that compa
nies like Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon develop are the same mili
tary weapons that were used to kill 105
civilians, including 34 children and 13
women, in Gaza last week.
The bulldozers that Israel has used
to demolish 25,000 Palestinian homes
since 1967 and internally displace over
160,000 are provided by Caterpillar, Inc.,
whose CEO addressed this campus last
spring in the GSB's "View from the
Top" series.
Divesting from the US-Israeli
occupation of Palestine is the only neu
tral option.
When more US aid goes to Israel
than Latin America and Africa com
bined each year, the Israeli occupation
of Palestine becomes the US-Israeli
occupation of Palestine, and all
American citizens become implicated
in the side of the oppressor.
When Stanford's $l7 billion
endowment does not even investigate
whether any dollar of its funds are
invested in companies like Lockheed
Martin, Caterpillar or Raytheon, all
Stanford students become implicated
in the side of the oppressor.
The UC -Irvine student body unan
imously passed a resolution for its uni
versity to divest from the Israeli con
flict on Nov. 12. The Brown Advisory
Committee on Corporate
Responsibility in Investment Policies
(ACCRIP) recommended that the
Brown Corporation consider divest
ment from companies profiting from
the Israeli occupation of Palestine on
Nov. 14.
It is time for Stanford to do the
same.
