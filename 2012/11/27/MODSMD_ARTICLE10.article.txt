## Israel, Hamas, and the Value of a Human life 
### MARTY ZACK '14 Co-President, Stanford Israel Alliance 
As you drive up the main road
to Jerusalem, the world's
holiest city welcomes you
with a sign offering the universal
greeting of shalom aleichem, the
Hebrew equivalent for the Arabic
salaam aleikum, or "peace [be]
upon you." Yet Jerusalem's status
as the location of innumerable holy
and historic sites provided no
immunity and no peaceful shelter in
the face of an encroaching tide of
violence last week. On Nov. 20, in
the midst of a week during which
nearly 1,500 rockets rained down
on Israel, a rocket was fired from
the Gaza Strip towards Jerusalem,
threatening nearly one million resi
dents of diverse faiths and national
ities. As sirens sounded around the
city and pedestrians ran for cover,
the rocket landed harmlessly in the
nearby West Bank, but notice had
been served: not even the world's
holiest places were safe from the
indiscriminate violence of Hamas.

Between Nov. 10 and Nov. 14,
Israel had endured an unprovoked
barrage of nearly 100 rockets
launched by various terrorist fac
tions in the Gaza Strip, led by
Hamas and aimed squarely at
Israeli civilians. In response, Israel
successfully targeted and assassi
nated Ahmed al-Jabari, the leader
of Hamas' military wing. Jabari
had orchestrated multiple terror
attacks over the years, was respon
sible for the murder of dozens of
Israelis, and had masterminded the
kidnapping and five-year captivity
of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In
recent years, Jabari has also over
seen and sustained Hamas' con
stant rocket fire at Israel: some 700
prior to Nov. 14 this year alone, as
part of a campaign dating back to
2001 that has seen 13,000 rockets

fall on Israel.
Yet in response to Hamas' undi
rected violence, the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) over the proceeding
week used every means at their dis
posal to minimize harm to the civil
ian population Hamas purposefully
endangers. The IDF called and
texted thousands of Gaza residents,
warning them of coming IDF
strikes in the area on Hamas' infra
structure and urging them to find
safety, away from Hamas opera
tives and operations. In so doing,
the IDF privileges the safety of
Palestinian civilians over Israel's
military objectives by literally noti
fying the enemy of an imminent
strike and enabling their escape. In
addition, the IDF dropped thou
sands of leaflets over Gaza with
similar messages and in some
cases, even specified exactly where
Gazans could find safe harbor.
Finally, whenever possible, the IDF
uses pinpoint strikes, expending its
resources specifically to minimize
damage. In the strike on Jabari, for
instance, his car was the only target
hit by the blast, in the middle of a
narrow street.

By contrast, Hamas willfully, reg
ularly and abhorrently endangers
the people of Gaza. The group,
incredibly, openly encouraged
Gazans to ignore the leaflets
dropped by the IDF directing them
to safety. Hamas' rockets terrorized
its own population, as 152 rockets
fired from Gaza landed in the Gaza
Strip itself over eight days of fight
ing. Hamas endangered journalists
throughout Gaza when a senior
operative commandeered a press
vehicle, disguising himself as a
reporter and thus abusing protec
tions afforded to the media amidst
conflict. Hamas' top leader Khaled

Meshal, in the words of the New
York Times, "taunted Israel to begin
a ground invasion," thereby per
versely and sickeningly seeming to
wish significantly greater peril and
harm upon the people he governs.
In perhaps the most telling
image of the weeklong clash, on
Nov. 20, Hamas fired at a border
crossing as the IDF was about to
deliver the 150 trucks of nearly
4,000 tons of goods (food, gas, med
icine and more) it brings into Gaza
several times a week. In fact, over
the course of the year, Israel deliv
ers about 750,000 tons of supplies
to Gaza, even in the face of such
cynical gestures from its adversary.
Hamas' utter disregard for
human life and welfare is the great
est threat to Gazans today.
Meanwhile, the State of Israel, con
fronted by a never-ending series of
difficult choices, has done its
utmost to uphold both its obligation
to defend its citizenry and its moral
commitment to minimizing injury
to civilians during conflict. As
Hamas makes deliberately and
sometimes literally suicidal
choices, Israel has sought to
approach the battlefield with the
greatest respect for the preserva
tion of all human life, an objective
IDF soldiers are taught to value
equally with the goal of completing
a mission. The values of the IDF
serve as an expression of the values
of a nation it democratically serves,
Israel, and as it seeks peace and
security for the region, so too does
Israel look towards a future in
which Israelis and Palestinians live
in peaceful coexistence and self
determination.
