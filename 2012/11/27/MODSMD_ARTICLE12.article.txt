# Take Care of Yourself
## 
### Emily Cohodes 
It's 8:30 a.m. on the Thursday of
finals week. You wake up from
four hours of sleep, wipe the
crud from your eyes, grab some
pretzels, and hop on your bike. As
you make your way to your final,
you realize you forgot to brush
your teeth. You haven't worn any

thing but pajamas for the last two
days. You wander through the lec
ture hall and slump into an empty
seat. Your sleepy eyes can barely
make out the signature line on the
front of the test booklet. It's going
to be a long three hours.
Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating a
little bit, but the "Finals Zombie" I
describe above isn't actually that far
from reality. At one point or another,
we've all been guilty of kicking our
wellbeing to the curb in an attempt
to study a little bit more, read one
more chapter of the textbook or
memorize a few more theorems.

By now, it may be hard to remem
ber the long naps, food, Mends and
family from Thanksgiving break. It
often seems that as soon as we're
back on the Farm and back in the
academic grind, the sweetness of
break is just a flicker in the past.
We're good at operating in two
opposite modes of being either
absolute indulgence in rest, family
and friends or pedal-to-the-metal,
stay-up-all-night-in-Meyer crazi
ness. As we transition back to
school this week and look ahead to
finals week, I encourage you to
replicate some of the relaxation and
rest that I hope you found over
break.

Self-care the ability to nur
ture yourself in times of stress,
work overload, and emotional
trauma will be a key to all of
our success in the next two weeks.
But what is self-care really, and
how will it help you? Self care
means not letting yourself slip
through the cracks as you cram
for exams or stay up all night to
write a paper. Self-care means
deciding to hike the Dish with a
friend instead of pulling another
two-hour shift at the library so
you can get some fresh air and
socialization. Self-care means call
ing home and talking to your fam
ily when you feel like you can't
possibly type another word or
come up with another line of code.
Self-care means letting yourself
mindlessly surf the Internet for a
few minutes (not hours) after
you've completed a big task. Self
care may even mean making a pan
of brownies for your dorm between
exams or playing an impromptu
game of touch football when you
"really should be working."
Self-care is different for all of us,
but it will be the one thing all of us

who don't get sick, run down, or
sleep deprived this finals season
have in common. I realize that it
may often sound like I'm advocating
putting aside the books and focusing
on what matters most in life (your
health, happiness, relationships, life
skills), and I am, but I'm really not
telling you not to study. You'll see me
camped out in Green with the best of
them this finals season, but I'm hop
ing that my self-care regimen will
keep me away from the brink of
absolute stress.

There are two types of self-care
that can make you feel better
up-regulation and down-regulation.
Up-regulating self-care includes
activities that tend to make you feel
more energized, excited, and fired
up, such as going to a party or
going for a run. These are activities
that get your blood pumping and
give you the strength to keep fight
ing through a stack of work. Down
regulating self-care includes drink
ing tea, talking to a friend, taking a
short nap, or meditating. Walking
could be up- or down-regulating,
depending on whether you're feel
ing sluggish or nervous. The best
self-care plans incorporate both up
and down-regulating elements,
preferably alternating between the
two to keep you in an optimal state
of calm and focus.

So as you look ahead to finals
week and start making study
guides, to-do lists, and timelines,
don't forget to create a self-care
plan for yourself. Seriously. This
may seem like a trivial exercise, but
I dare you to sit down and come up
with away to fit Dish walks, coffee
dates and hot showers into your
schedule. Use pen, set reminders,
make plans with a friend and ask
them to hold you to it. Chances are,
these little things you add in to take
care of yourself which seem like
they should be the first to get
bumped off the schedule when time
gets tight will be the difference
between a healthy, happy and suc
cessful finals season and you turn
ing into that sleep-walking, snif
fling zombie we all know all too well
come the end of finals.

back on the Farm and back in the
academic grind, the sweetness of
break is just a flicker in the past.
We're good at operating in two
opposite modes of being either
absolute indulgence in rest, family
and friends or pedal-to-the-metal,
stay-up-all-night-in-Meyer crazi
ness. As we transition back to
school this week and look ahead to
finals week, I encourage you to
replicate some of the relaxation and
rest that I hope you found over
break.

Self-care the ability to nur
ture yourself in times of stress,
work overload, and emotional
trauma will be a key to all of
our success in the next two weeks.
But what is self-care really, and
how will it help you? Self care
means not letting yourself slip
through the cracks as you cram
for exams or stay up all night to
write a paper. Self-care means
deciding to hike the Dish with a
friend instead of pulling another
two-hour shift at the library so
you can get some fresh air and
socialization. Self-care means call
ing home and talking to your fam
ily when you feel like you can't
possibly type another word or
come up with another line of code.
Self-care means letting yourself
mindlessly surf the Internet for a
few minutes (not hours) after
you've completed a big task. Self
care may even mean making a pan
of brownies for your dorm between
exams or playing an impromptu
game of touch football when you
"really should be working."
Self-care is different for all of us,
but it will be the one thing all of us

who don't get sick, run down, or
sleep deprived this finals season
have in common. I realize that it
may often sound like I'm advocating
putting aside the books and focusing
on what matters most in life (your
health, happiness, relationships, life
skills), and I am, but I'm really not
telling you not to study. You'll see me
camped out in Green with the best of
them this finals season, but I'm hop
ing that my self-care regimen will
keep me away from the brink of
absolute stress.

There are two types of self-care
that can make you feel better
up-regulation and down-regulation.
Up-regulating self-care includes
activities that tend to make you feel
more energized, excited, and fired
up, such as going to a party or
going for a run. These are activities
that get your blood pumping and
give you the strength to keep fight
ing through a stack of work. Down
regulating self-care includes drink
ing tea, talking to a friend, taking a
short nap, or meditating. Walking
could be up- or down-regulating,
depending on whether you're feel
ing sluggish or nervous. The best
self-care plans incorporate both up
and down-regulating elements,
preferably alternating between the
two to keep you in an optimal state
of calm and focus.

So as you look ahead to finals
week and start making study
guides, to-do lists, and timelines,
don't forget to create a self-care
plan for yourself. Seriously. This
may seem like a trivial exercise, but
I dare you to sit down and come up
with away to fit Dish walks, coffee
dates and hot showers into your
schedule. Use pen, set reminders,
make plans with a friend and ask
them to hold you to it. Chances are,
these little things you add in to take
care of yourself which seem like
they should be the first to get
bumped off the schedule when time
gets tight will be the difference
between a healthy, happy and suc
cessful finals season and you turn
ing into that sleep-walking, snif
fling zombie we all know all too well
come the end of finals.

It's 8:30 a.m. on the Thursday of
finals week. You wake up from
four hours of sleep, wipe the
crud from your eyes, grab some
pretzels, and hop on your bike. As
you make your way to your final,
you realize you forgot to brush
your teeth. You haven't worn any

thing but pajamas for the last two
days. You wander through the lec
ture hall and slump into an empty
seat. Your sleepy eyes can barely
make out the signature line on the
front of the test booklet. It's going
to be a long three hours.
Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating a
little bit, but the "Finals Zombie" I
describe above isn't actually that far
from reality. At one point or another,
we've all been guilty of kicking our
wellbeing to the curb in an attempt
to study a little bit more, read one
more chapter of the textbook or
memorize a few more theorems.

By now, it may be hard to remem
ber the long naps, food, Mends and
family from Thanksgiving break. It
often seems that as soon as we're
back on the Farm and back in the
academic grind, the sweetness of
break is just a flicker in the past.
