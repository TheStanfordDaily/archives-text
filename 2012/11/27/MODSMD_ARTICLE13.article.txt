## The
						tale of a very loyal fan 
### Tom Taylor 
Am I Stanford football's
biggest fan? Regular
readers among you will
probably be screaming
in objection that I
could even dare to insinuate this,
threatening to burn or shred these
very pages, but before you do that,
please, give me a chance to explain.
I realize that I am wholly unquali
fied for this position. I'm not
American and until just a few short
years ago I had approximately zero
interest in football. I'm still a little
hazy on the myriad of different offen
sive plays and the names of different
player positions. I can fake under
standing briefly, with the help of cor
rectly colored clothing and the names
of a handful of players, but however
much I might now enjoy the sport, I
lack encyclopedic knowledge of its
rules and history.
At Senior Day against Oregon
State two weeks back, Stanford
Athletics honored its fans of the sea
son, supporters both young and old
who have a far better claim to their
position than I. They ranged from
kids who learned to count using the
numbers on the jerseys to folks who
supported the team way back before
I was even a twinkle in my parents'
eyes.

But statistics don't lie, do they?
This year my record equals that of
the actual football team. The players
are 10-2 under my watch, and I'm 10-
2 in terms of games attended-missed.
And I'm hoping we can both improve
those to 12-2 by the end of New
Year's Day 2013: If all things go
according to plan in the Pac-12
Championship Game this Friday,
Stanford will be heading to the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 1.

I suspect there are very few fans
out there who can claim a similarly
loyal attendance.
Unlike some of my fellow Daily
writers, I haven't been to a single one
of those games working in a profes
sional capacity. It was easy, and free,
to attend the six regular season
games on campus especially since
as a grad student, I was here long
before the start of the fall quarter
when the first three were played. But
in addition to the short trans-Bay trip
to Cal there were three serious road
trips in there: Notre Dame, Oregon
and UCLA

I'm lucky to be not just a student
but a grad student who is officially
done with classes, meaning my time
is incredibly flexible. I am supposed
to be doing quite a bit of research in
there, sure, but escaping my lab for a
few days is far too easy. Money is a
slightly different issue, owed again to
my grad student status, but with a lit
tle bit of help from people who I've
convinced to come along with me to
share costs and a student's ability to
tolerate the occasional absence of lux
ury, I haven't yet maxed out my cred
it card.

I realize not everyone can count
on quite the same situation, but I still
think that my efforts are worth some
thing. I flew out to South Bend, Ind.,
the longest trip of the season, under
the cloud of that loss against
Washington, and returned thorough
ly soaked and crestfallen that with
two losses, Stanford's season seemed
all but over. I drove all the way up to
Eugene, Ore., certain of another
heartbreaking loss to the Ducks, and
toned around seven days later to
make the trip south to Pasadena,
Calif., worried by the implications of
Oregon defeating Oregon State and
the Card losing to the home team.
I've also spent almost $3OO on
tickets and earned exactly zero loyal
ty points from the Red Zone from
those four trips. In fact my 14 points
this season is four shy of the maxi
mum, and undoubtedly there are offi
cially more "loyal" students out there
than I.

Do I deserve a medal? Probably.
Will I get one? Unlikely Either way I
would be happy enough to see just
one piece of silverware this year: the
Rose Bowl trophy
I went all-in this year because it is
likely to be my last, the ultimate
chance I get to do this as a real stu
dent before finally graduating and
being released back into the world
outside, and maybe even the last time
I'll be at a Stanford football game
ever. I haven't really put enough
thought into what is going to happen
after I am handed my diploma in
June, but visa restrictions mean I'll
almost certainly be on my way back
home to the UK in less than a year's
time. Traveling about two thousand
miles and crossing three time zones
from Palo Alto to South Bend for four
hours of play was tough, but nothing
