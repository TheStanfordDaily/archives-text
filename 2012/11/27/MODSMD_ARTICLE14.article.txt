## Stanford falls to No. 7 Missouri 
### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mixed results turned the Stanford
wrestling team's trip to Columbia, Mo., this
past Saturday into a bittersweet visit as the
Cardinal fell to 4-3 on the young season.
The Cardinal picked up one in each column,
yet the win against South Dakota State
early on in the day was overshadowed by
the crushing defeat by No. 7 Missouri.
Not to be deterred by the Tigers' men
acing stats Mizzou boast five wrestlers
ranked in the top 10 and have two shut-out
victories in three dual matches the
Cardinal went headfirst into its afternoon
dual against Missouri, the reigning Big 12
Champions. They offered up a formidable
lineup including No. 2 heavyweight Dom
Bradley, a sophomore Ail-American, and
Alan Waters, ranked fourth in the country.
Both Waters and Bradley proved to be
difficult matchups for Stanford's junior
Dan Scherer and sophomore Evan Silver
respectively. Scherer put up an especially
good fight against Bradley, failing to pull
out with a win after falling 2-1 in the
tiebreaker.

Although Stanford surrendered an ago
nizing 31 team points to Missouri, junior
Kyle Meyer managed to escape his upset
win against Kyle Bradley with three team
points for the Cardinal. In their third ever
match-up against the Tigers, Stanford had
originally looked to avenge the 26-9 victory
by Missouri at the Farm last year.
Unfortunately, they were unable to make a
dent in Missouri's hot start to the season,
now with an undefeated record of 5-0.

"We felt confident going into both
duals," Boone said. "We knew Missouri was
a good team and had some tough, highly
ranked wrestlers in the country, but rank
ings are just rankings ... We were very
close to beating some very good opponents
at some weights, and it just goes to show us
how our hard work is helping us make huge
gains against some highly-touted oppo
nents."
The loss to Missouri follows two other
harsh losses, one against Michigan and the
other against Northwestern, in the first
couple weeks of November.

The Stanford-South Dakota State dual
was much closer, but the Cardinal edged
out the win with the help of key decisions
by Silver and Stanford captain Timmy
Boone. Boone's 12-10 decision turned
around the Cardinal luck as SDSU led after
the first five matches.
