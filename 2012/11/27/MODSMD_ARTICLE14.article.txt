## Stanford falls to No. 7 Missouri 
### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mixed results turned the Stanford
wrestling team's trip to Columbia, Mo., this
past Saturday into a bittersweet visit as the
Cardinal fell to 4-3 on the young season.
The Cardinal picked up one in each column,
yet the win against South Dakota State
early on in the day was overshadowed by
the crushing defeat by No. 7 Missouri.
Not to be deterred by the Tigers' men
acing stats Mizzou boast five wrestlers
ranked in the top 10 and have two shut-out
victories in three dual matches the
Cardinal went headfirst into its afternoon
dual against Missouri, the reigning Big 12
Champions. They offered up a formidable
lineup including No. 2 heavyweight Dom
Bradley, a sophomore Ail-American, and
Alan Waters, ranked fourth in the country.
Both Waters and Bradley proved to be
difficult matchups for Stanford's junior
Dan Scherer and sophomore Evan Silver
respectively. Scherer put up an especially
good fight against Bradley, failing to pull
out with a win after falling 2-1 in the
tiebreaker.

Although Stanford surrendered an ago
nizing 31 team points to Missouri, junior
Kyle Meyer managed to escape his upset
win against Kyle Bradley with three team
points for the Cardinal. In their third ever
match-up against the Tigers, Stanford had
originally looked to avenge the 26-9 victory
by Missouri at the Farm last year.
Unfortunately, they were unable to make a
dent in Missouri's hot start to the season,
now with an undefeated record of 5-0.

"We felt confident going into both
duals," Boone said. "We knew Missouri was
a good team and had some tough, highly
ranked wrestlers in the country, but rank
ings are just rankings ... We were very
close to beating some very good opponents
at some weights, and it just goes to show us
how our hard work is helping us make huge
gains against some highly-touted oppo
nents."
The loss to Missouri follows two other
harsh losses, one against Michigan and the
other against Northwestern, in the first
couple weeks of November.

The Stanford-South Dakota State dual
was much closer, but the Cardinal edged
out the win with the help of key decisions
by Silver and Stanford captain Timmy
Boone. Boone's 12-10 decision turned
around the Cardinal luck as SDSU led after
the first five matches.

Junior Bret Baumbach (above) and the Stanford men's wrestling squad downed South Dakota
State 22- 11, but lost to No. 7 Missouri 31-3 on Saturday. With the split result, the Cardinal is
now 4-3 overall and enjoys a two-week break before The Reno Tournament of Champions.
with a 20-4 loss was the one major
setback for the Cardinal, but true
freshman Tommy Kimbrell nar
rowly defeated John Nething II to
put Stanford ahead with 13 team
points to the Jackrabbit 11.
Michael Sojka sealed the deal for
the Cardinal after he shut out
Brandon Ballard in the 197-pound
matchup with a score of 5-0.
Schrer's heavyweight decision
against J.J. Everard ended the
dual with a final score of 22-11.
The Cardinal season has slowed

considerably, considering that their
last four meets have resulted in
only one win, dismissing the high
hopes for this year after an early
season three meet winning streak.
Yet, with a winning record,
Stanford still has a slim chance to
qualify individuals for the NCAA
Championship and possibly sur
pass their final rank from last year
of 11th in the nation. Last year,
senior Ryan Mango finished fifth at
the Championships and he has a
chance to do it again.
The guidance and experience of
sth-year coach Jason Borrelli has
surely contributed to the prepara
tion and stamina of the team.
Borrelli's leadership will be especial
ly necessary after the demoralizing

loss to Mizzou and his direction will
be crucial in helping build Cardinal
momentum before the next meet in
Reno during winter break. Before
then, though, the team has a two
week break to reflect on how they
can fix then* slump.
"The team is going to work on
some of the more technical areas in
the coming weeks before Reno that
we didn't have much time to touch
on in the preseason and past couple
weeks," Boone said. "We're confi
dent that come Reno, we'll be in
great physical shape and will be
well-prepared to upset some tough
opponents."
