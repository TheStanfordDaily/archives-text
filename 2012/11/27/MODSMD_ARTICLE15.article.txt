## Men's water polo ends season with overtime loss to UCLA 
### George Chen 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team saw
its season come to an end when it fell to No. 2
UCLA 10-9 in sudden-death overtime of the MPSF
Championship Third-Place Game on Friday.
Despite trailing the Bruins 7-5 late in the
game, the Cardinal stormed back to tie the game
at seven apiece when sophomore Nick
Hoversten found the back of the net with 41 sec
onds left in regulation.
UCLA struck early in the overtime period,
but Stanford answered emphatically with
back-to-back scores from redshirt seniors
Travis Noll and Andrew LaForge, giving the
team a 10-9 lead. The Cardinal was on the
verge of avenging its loss to the Bruins three
weeks ago, but UCLA equalized to send the

game into sudden death.
Junior goalie Seott Plashton denied the first
shot, but sophomore attacker Daniel Lenhart
capitalized off a 20-second penalty with 1:27 left
in the sudden-death period to propel UCLA to
the victory. Plashton stood tall for much of the
game, making 13 saves despite allowing seven to
go past him.
Having won seven of its last eight games
prior to the MPSF Championship, all three of
the Cardinal's matches in the weekend tourna
ment were closely contested. Stanford defeated
Long Beach State 14-13 in a double-overtime
thriller before barely falling to No. 1 USC on
Saturday in a heartbreaking 11-10 loss.
The Cardinal finished the season 16-7 overall
with five of its losses coming against powerhous
es USC and UCLA.
