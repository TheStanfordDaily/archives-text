### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
David Shaw was named the 2012 Pac-12
Coach of the Year on Monday when the con
ference awards were announced 24 play
ers earned individual honors as well.
In just his second year as Stanford's head
coach, Shaw has now won the award for two
straight years. Only three other coaches in
conference history have earned the honor in
back-to-back seasons.
"When your peers vote for you, I can't
tell you how much I appreciate what guys
think of the work that we've done here," said
Shaw.
Shaw guided his team to a 10-2 regular
season record, giving the Cardinal three
consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time
in school history. Despite the fact that not a
single voter in the preseason media poll
picked Stanford to play in the Pac-12
Championship Game, it won the North
Division title and has the chance to lay its
hands on the conference trophy Friday
night.
The former Stanford wide receiver cred
its his coaching staff for the team's contin
ued success. In particular, defensive coordi
nator Derek Mason has been named a semi
finalist for the Broyles Award, given annual
ly to the nation's best college football assis
tant coach.
"The biggest thing is I'm going to reward
my coaches," Shaw said. "This is a coaching
staff award. I can't tell you how much Derek
Mason has done for this defense, how much
Pep Hamilton has done training our young
quarterback getting him ready to play and
utilizing Zach Ertz and our running game
coordinator [Mike Sanford] putting Stepfan
into position to do what he does."
Five Stanford players were named to the
All-Pac-12 First Team. Tight end Zach Ertz
and offensive lineman David Yankey were
selected for the offensive unit while line
