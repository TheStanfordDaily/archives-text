Playbook" is
a darkly
humorous story of family, mental
illness and love that will leave you
with lots to think about before
you head home for the holidays.
Starring Bradley Cooper and
"The Hunger Games" star
Jennifer Lawrence, the movie is
sharp, engaging and surprisingly
relatable. Director David O.
Russell ("The Fighter") crafts a
compelling dynamic between sev
eral strong actors, and the end
result is an unorthodox take on
love and personal struggle.
The premise of "Silver
Linings" centers around Pat
(Bradley Cooper) as he transi
tions to outpatient life after
spending eight months in a men
tal institution following a violent
psychotic break, ominously

referred to as "the episode"
throughout the film. Pat, who has
a longstanding undiagnosed and
untreated case of bipolar disorder
with delusions, is driven into a
ferocious fight with his wife's
lover after he discovers the affair
by finding them in the act. The
film illustrates and introduces
this saga with grace but also with
painful honesty, immediately and
effectively forcing the audience to
feel for Pat. One can't help but
sympathize at this point, and it's
hard to wonder if even the most
balanced, mentally healthy indi
vidual wouldn't snap in this sce
nario.
These factors all culminate
in the hopeful but precarious set
ting of the movie: Pat has moved
back home and is trying his best
to assimilate back into daily life.
His primary focus is getting
Nikki, his wife, back by proving

his stability and current state of
total health. Pat has daily therapy
sessions with Dr. Patel, played by
the compelling and often
comedic Anupam Kher (who
you'd likely recognize as the dad
from "Bend it Like Beckham.")
In his quest to prove his san
ity, his progress is complicated by
the also "crazy" Tiffany, played by
a beautiful but enigmatic Jennifer
Lawrence. Tiffany's badass-look
ing boots and impenetrable vibe
will briefly leave you wondering
if she might be Katniss Everdeen's
cooler, older sister. Tiffany
appears in a supportive friend
role for Pat, but, unsurprisingly,
there are undeniable sparks
between them that linger
throughout the development of
their relationship.
Both Cooper and Lawrence
are highly competent in their
leading roles as similarly troubled

souls, and Cooper in particular
shows his acting chops in his por
trayal of a truly troubled and
struggling individual. It's also sat
isfying to see Jennifer Lawrence
come into her own as an actress
who should be taken seriously,
though it is a touch hard to buy
that she's old enough to have
been married and widowed. She's
barely 22 in real life, and we at
Intermission would bet money
she'd still be getting carded if she
weren't a hot celeb.
Several other standout actors
help make this unfamiliar story
translate well into a movie. Robert
DeNiro is excellent as Pat's con
cerned football-and-betting-obsessed
father, and it's a pleasant change to see
DeNiro as a softer character than you
may be used to. DeNiro's character is
easily the most interesting element of

Pat's home dynamic, and is the source of many a
confrontation throughout the film. His mother
(Jacki Weaver) and brother (SheaWhigham) on
the other hand, are much less impressive and at
times come across as shallow and repetitive.
In all, "Silver Linings Playbook" is an inter

esting commentary on the meaning of'normal,'
the value of sanity and the fear of craziness. It's
worth seeing for the strong performances of sev
eral actors, the uncommon story and, particularly
at this time of the year, the brutally honest por
trait of family relationships.
