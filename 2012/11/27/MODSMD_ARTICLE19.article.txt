# THE 						TOP FIVE
## WAYS TO RE-MOTIVATE YOURSELF AFTER THANKSGIVING BREAK 
### Alex Kennedy | STAFF WRITER 
Thanksgiving break is over, and of
course you got nothing done
with finals looming, just like
every other year. Intermission has the best
ways to re-motivate yourself after a week
off.
■ Take a TV break
No, we don't mean skip studying to watch
three hours of "Parks and Rec" reruns, sat
isfying as that may sound. Instead, try
making a pact with some family members
and/or friends from back home, wherein
you and your pals decide on several TV
shows that you love, and refrain from
watching those shows until winter break.
Then, after the terrible drought from
"Happy Endings" or "The Voice" (whatever
floats your boat), you can go home, get
cozy with your best buds and have an

extremely satisfying marathon over pop
corn and your sorely-missed local takeout.
Consider doing the same for new movies,
and log some quality time at the movie
theater during break. Movies are probably
easier to abstain from at Stanford, seeing
as we're so sadly isolated from many con
venient movie theaters.
■ Go big when you go home
While this may sound like a retroactive sug
gestion to get wine-drunk at family
Thanksgiving dinner, what we actually sug
gest here is to do your best to get the slack
ing out of your system before week nine
starts! Hopefully you spent a solid amount
of time lounging horizontally, catching up
on that sleep debt over Thanksgiving break,
and so maybe you're already OD'd on pro
crastinating and wasting time! But for the
rest of us mortals, it might be a good idea to

try to pack a bit more chilling into the first
couple days back at school we should
have our fill for the next couple weeks until
we get a proper vacation after finals.
■ Handle with care
Don't open those holiday promotion-relat
ed emails from your favorite shops and
stores! There is nothing but trouble buried
in those high-res graphics of awesome
must-buy items. Those emails are a portal
to one of the deadliest threats you'll face in
the coming weeks: online shopping, of
course. Cruelly, there's actually good reason
to online shop these days, what with impos
sible-to-shop-for mothers and grandmoth
ers that use their emails solely to harass you
about what you want for Christmas. But
alas, online shopping is an endless black
hole that will never release you back into
the land 'o productivity. Stay sharp, friends.

■ Delayed gratification is greater
gratification
If you somehow fail with the previous
trick, and you're already thinking presents,
think of how much more compelling your
argument for why you deserve the iPad
mini will be if you can flaunt your stellar
grades to your parents/grandparents/aunts/
significant gift givers in a few weeks.
■ Try or Die
This strategy is not for the faint of heart
when it comes to procrastination/focus
techniques. Finish whatever TV show
you're watching, and finish it completely!
Works best for since-canceled or retired
shows. Alternatively, take the lower-risk
option, and just refrain from starting any
new TV shows with six seasons available on
Netflix Instant Stream. There's only one
way that can end ...
