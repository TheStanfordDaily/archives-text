# ASSU revamps winter shuttle service
## Ride Grouped website to launch Thursday, service to begin this winter beak 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students traveling home for win
ter break next month will be offered
the use of a reformed ASSU shuttle
service program, in an effort to
make the service more accessible to
students while limiting the losses
the program has sustained in previ
ous years.
Ride Grouped, a student-run start
up, aims to pair students travelling
to the same destination at similar
times through an online booking sys
tem, allowing students to access a
discounted price of $l5 as opposed to
the $26 charged for services such as
Shuttle. The Ride Grouped site will
open for student usage on Thursday.
"We kept on getting pestered by
all these notifications online [of peo
ple seeking shared rides]," said Jai
Sajnani'ls, RideGrouped's cofounder.
"[RideGrouped] is a pretty simple
solution to that problem."
While in previous years the
ASSU would exclusively reserve a
set number of Super Shuttle vans,
estimating the total student demand
for the service, that practice with
the exception of a small number of
vans scheduled for this winter break
will be discontinued under the

AIR PORT

new program, nmhrnizing sunk costs.
Pairing interested students
directly will also make the service
more accessible to students looking
to book rides at the last minute.

"People like to wait until the last
minute to book their shuttle, and it's
kind of hard to manage the exclusive
shuttle system like that," Sajnani
said. "If someone's trying to book a

shuttle two days before them flight,
they're not going to have the option
[if they're] using the [old] ASSU
service."
"As long as someone else is trav

elling at a similar time to yon, and
you're going to the same location ...
that works out, and they can travel
with you," Sajnani said.
While previous shuttle offerings
have departed at set times from
Tresidder Union and Escondido
Road, Sajnani said that the ability of
the Ride Grouped service to depart
from more locations of which five
are currently planned could
potentially increase demand for the
service among students.
"The system gives you a lot more
flexibility in that there's more
potential for a ride that you can join
and greater potential for the dis
counted cost at a time that's more
convenient for you and at a location
that's closer to your dorm," Sajnani
said.
While Sajnani expressed opti
mism that greater flexibility and
accessibility for interested students
would minimize the risk of a unac
companied shuttle ride, students
unable to find someone else travel
ling to the same place at the same
time will still pay $2O, the approxi
mate cost of a regular Super Shuttle
journey.
Ride Grouped enjoyed success
during a trial run in Larkin last
year, and Sajnani cited a positive
reception by the ASSU and the
University as contributing to the
site's expansion.
