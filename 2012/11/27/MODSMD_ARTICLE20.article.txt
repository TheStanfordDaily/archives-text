On the evening of Veterans' Day, a
room full of people sat facing an
empty stage. There was no video
footage or theatrical production for them to
watch, yet each person stared transfixed, visualiz
ing the nerve-wracldng conflict, crippling heat
and insidious boredom of deployment in Iraq
and Afghanistan as they listened to the recorded
voices of Stanford's veterans.
This was "Stories From the Front," an
event hosted by the Stanford Storytelling
Project, a group of students and alumni that
believe in the power and importance of oral sto
rytelling.
The project began five years ago when
director Jonah Willihnganz decided to stray
from the usual medium of the written essay and
assign his students radio pieces instead. For three
years, KZSU featured the stories from his classes.
Then, almost two years ago, an injection of new
funding allowed Willihnganz to expand the pro
gram to include a weekly radio show, "State of
the Human," student grants and events such as
"Stories from the Front."
The project's most recent undertaking is
outreach. This includes a Show and Tell series in
the dorms, where students do a workshop on
how to brainstorm, write and perform their own
stories, as well as an appeal to students to contact
the Stanford Storytelling Project with their own
stories and story ideas. Willihnganz also hopes to
broadcast "State of the Human" on NPR in the
Bay Area within the next year.
"One of the reasons that the Storytelling
Project exists is that there is a very old-fashioned
idea about what narrative does that has managed
to disappear since the end of the 19th century —
particularly in American schools and colleges
which is that they are here to be guides for your
life, for how to live," Willihnganz said.
"State of the Human" examines the
human consciousness by focusing each week on
a different theme. The show uses a combination
of a style similar to "This American Life" and an
inquiry-based approach reminiscent of
"Radiolab."
" [Each show is] always about one com
mon human experience, and every story teaches
us something about that common experience,"
Willihnganz explained.
Although the producers are generally older
and more experienced than student contribu
tors, the hierarchy is loose within the Storytelling
Project; eveiyone spends time searching for sto
ries in the news, in research and amongst the
student body. New students learn the tricks of
the trade from seasoned producers and editors.

completely by accident, showing up to what she
thought was the Stanford Graphic Novel Project
only to find it was a meeting for the Stanford
Storytelling Project. Since then, she has been
very involved with the production of "State of
the Human" and is shadowing producers to
learn how to interview, transcribe and edit mate
rial.
"It was kind of intimidating but eveiyone
was so welcoming," Yuan said. "The fact that
they thought [my] ideas were valuable as well
took [me by surprise]."
The members of the Storytelling Project
do not follow a linear trajectory during the cre
ative process of putting together a show, they
can approach a theme from a variety of angles
and can start in a variety of places. Sometimes,
they will brainstorm a theme (such as lying or
love) and search for stories that align with the
theme; other times, multiple stories share a com
mon thread and can fit together into a single
show.
"My creative process varies from piece to
piece and also from person to person," said
Natacha Ruck, graduate student and producer of
"State of the Human."
Ruck had previous experience with televi
sion documentaries, but working on oral story
telling has pushed her to let go of the impor
tance of visual effects and focus on the voice.
"There's a format to radio that I think is
very interesting, and what you can get from the
human voice is very different from what you get
from documentaries," Ruck said.
According to Willihnganz, this is scientifi
cally valid; the part of the brain that experiences
music is also activated when listening to the spo
ken word.
"Literally at a neurological level, when we
hear a story spoken aloud and in someone's
voice, we have a much more dimensional expe
rience," he said.
War veteran Dustin Barfield 'l2 experi
enced an emotional response to hearing his own
story played back on the radio.
"Actually hearing myself on tape with my
stories, I actually got kind of choked up," Barfield
said.
The emotion that stories can elicit when
spoken aloud does not only originate in neurons
firing in the brain; there is also the recognition of
shared human traits such as awkwardness, inse
curity and love.
"The whole point of this is empathy, and
you don't empathize with people unless you
hear them being human," managing editor
Rachel Hamburg 'll said. "Hearing those
moments that are unscripted is key."

do not follow a linear trajectory during the cre
ative process of putting together a show, they
can approach a theme from a variety of angles
and can start in a variety of places. Sometimes,
they will brainstorm a theme (such as lying or
love) and search for stories that align with the
theme; other times, multiple stories share a com
mon thread and can fit together into a single
show.
"My creative process varies from piece to
piece and also from person to person," said
Natacha Ruck, graduate student and producer of
"State of the Human."
Ruck had previous experience with televi
sion documentaries, but working on oral story
telling has pushed her to let go of the impor
tance of visual effects and focus on the voice.
"There's a format to radio that I think is
very interesting, and what you can get from the
human voice is very different from what you get
from documentaries," Ruck said.
According to Willihnganz, this is scientifi
cally valid; the part of the brain that experiences
music is also activated when listening to the spo
ken word.
"Literally at a neurological level, when we
hear a story spoken aloud and in someone's
voice, we have a much more dimensional expe
rience," he said.
War veteran Dustin Barfield 'l2 experi
enced an emotional response to hearing his own
story played back on the radio.
"Actually hearing myself on tape with my
stories, I actually got kind of choked up," Barfield
said.
The emotion that stories can elicit when
spoken aloud does not only originate in neurons
firing in the brain; there is also the recognition of
shared human traits such as awkwardness, inse
curity and love.
"The whole point of this is empathy, and
you don't empathize with people unless you
hear them being human," managing editor
Rachel Hamburg 'll said. "Hearing those
moments that are unscripted is key."

On the evening of Veterans' Day, a
room full of people sat facing an
empty stage. There was no video
footage or theatrical production for them to
watch, yet each person stared transfixed, visualiz
ing the nerve-wracldng conflict, crippling heat
and insidious boredom of deployment in Iraq
and Afghanistan as they listened to the recorded
voices of Stanford's veterans.
This was "Stories From the Front," an
event hosted by the Stanford Storytelling
Project, a group of students and alumni that
believe in the power and importance of oral sto
rytelling.
The project began five years ago when
director Jonah Willihnganz decided to stray
from the usual medium of the written essay and
assign his students radio pieces instead. For three
years, KZSU featured the stories from his classes.
Then, almost two years ago, an injection of new
funding allowed Willihnganz to expand the pro
gram to include a weekly radio show, "State of
the Human," student grants and events such as
"Stories from the Front."
The project's most recent undertaking is
outreach. This includes a Show and Tell series in
the dorms, where students do a workshop on
how to brainstorm, write and perform their own
stories, as well as an appeal to students to contact
the Stanford Storytelling Project with their own
stories and story ideas. Willihnganz also hopes to
broadcast "State of the Human" on NPR in the
Bay Area within the next year.
"One of the reasons that the Storytelling
Project exists is that there is a very old-fashioned
idea about what narrative does that has managed
to disappear since the end of the 19th century —
particularly in American schools and colleges
which is that they are here to be guides for your
life, for how to live," Willihnganz said.
"State of the Human" examines the
human consciousness by focusing each week on
a different theme. The show uses a combination
of a style similar to "This American Life" and an
inquiry-based approach reminiscent of
"Radiolab."
" [Each show is] always about one com
mon human experience, and every story teaches
us something about that common experience,"
Willihnganz explained.
Although the producers are generally older
and more experienced than student contribu
tors, the hierarchy is loose within the Storytelling
Project; eveiyone spends time searching for sto
ries in the news, in research and amongst the
student body. New students learn the tricks of
the trade from seasoned producers and editors.

completely by accident, showing up to what she
thought was the Stanford Graphic Novel Project
only to find it was a meeting for the Stanford
Storytelling Project. Since then, she has been
very involved with the production of "State of

learn how to interview, transcribe and edit mate

"It was kind of intimidating but eveiyone
was so welcoming," Yuan said. "The fact that
they thought [my] ideas were valuable as well
took [me by surprise]."
