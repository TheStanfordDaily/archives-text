# INSTANT REPLAY
## Blocking, leverage and the "Wildcat" 
### Winston Shi 
TV announcers love to talk about Stanford's use of the "Wildcat" formation, but they never really
explain why it is so useful. Against UCLA last Saturday, Stanford showed just how effective it can be with
Anthony Wilkerson's 10-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.

Because the Wildcat formation uses two key players in unconventional roles, it provides many oppor
tunities for misdirection. Specifically, Wilkerson, the running back (R) takes a direct snap in the shotgun,
while quarterback Kevin Hogan (Q) is lined up at wide receiver.
UCLA's defensive players are spread out fairly evenly across the field. However, Stanford has an
unbalanced line, with two tight ends on the left side (X and Y), and so UCLA actually has a numbers dis
advantage on that side of the field seven players on the left to Stanford's eight.
Stanford presses their advantage by threatening an outside run to the left. As the ball is being
snapped, wide receiver Kelsey Young (Z) runs in jet-sweep motion (shown in red) towards the other side
of the field. UCLA's defense has to respect Young's great speed, and the S, M and W linebackers all shade
to the outside in response. If they do not, because Stanford has the numbers advantage to the left,
Wilkerson can simply hand the ball to Young for a respectable gain or possibly even a touchdown.
However, if UCLA overpursues the jet sweep, Stanford's numbers advantage shifts to the right. The
Bruins may stop Stanford on this play, but on the next play, given UCLA's tendencies on defense, Stanford
can easily fake the jet sweep and run a QB reverse to the right side for a big play as was done on
Andrew Luck's 62-yard bomb to Chris Owusu against USC last year.
UCLA is too defensively sound to suffer such a breakdown, but Stanford can attack them to the inside
as well with their bread-and-butter "power" play. In this case, UCLA's players move left just enough that

Stanford's blockers con block them with inside leverage, pushing them away to the outside:
While Stanford's tight ends and fullback (X, Y and F) block outwards to the left, Stanford's offensive
line block towards the right, opening up a big hole between the X tight end and the left tackle.
With right guard Kevin Denser (circled in red) lead blocking for him, Wilkerson fakes to the left, cuts
inside, hits full speed and blows by UCLA's free safety (F/S), bowling into the end zone for a touchdown
and a lead that Stanford would not relinquish for the rest of the game.
