## Levee work to begin spring 2013 Project will protect local area from severe flood damage

The San Francisquito Creek
Flood Reduction Project will begin
this spring, according to Palo Alto
City Council member Pat Burt. He
said that the project will aim to pre
vent the creek's overflow from
damaging surrounding homes.
The Joint Powers Authority
(JPA) has been discussing the issue
ever since a large flood in 1998 put
many residents out of their homes
and shut down Highway 101 for one
day. Burt said that it was clear that
significant steps needed to be taken
to improve protection in case of
flood events.
According to Burt, the JPA has
decided to prioritize the protection
of downstream homes in East Palo
Alto, some of which are protected
by levees because they are at low
elevation, before continuing
upstream to the Palo Alto and
Menlo Park areas. He added that
starting upstream and working
down into East Palo Alto could
make downstream homes more vul
nerable to flood damage in the
interim.
The JPA was formed originally
to work with the Army Corps of
Engineers, the group that tradi
tionally provides flood protection.
It represents the three cities, Palo
Alto, East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park, and two counties, Santa Clara
and San Mateo Counties, that the
creek affects. Burt said that after
eight years of working with the
Corps, the project still seemed
incredibly tedious and was decades
away from funding and completion.
"Twenty years was too long to
wait to begin such a vital project,"
Burt said.
The JPA decided to redirect the
project and instead map out a par
allel plan for the estimated $lOO
million project.
The second version of the plan
still involved the help of the Army
Corps of Engineers but added local
funding for the project through
taxes and grants.
Caltrain, according to Burt, has
agreed to help with reconstruction
of Highway 101, raising the sur
rounding levees to protect the
highway from another major flood
ing event like the 1998 flood. There
has also been state grant funding
awarded to fix bridges that do not
conform to standards and to
improve their ability to withstand

weather damage.
The 1998 flood damaged 1,700
properties, the vast majority of
which were in Palo Alto surround
ing the Polk-Chaucer Bridge,
according to Len Materman, head
of the JPA. It also caused 28 million
dollars worth of damage.
While implementing more effec
tive flood control, the JPA also
plans to open up areas in range of
the creek to the National Wildlife
Refuge, repair dilapidated bridges,
enhance golf courses and create
new bicycle and pedestrian trails.

Materman added that the proj
ect will produce 14 acres of new
wetlands, which he described as
"extremely valuable" because they
are specifically suited for three
endangered species: the steelhead
trout, the clapper rail and the salt
marsh harvest mouse.
"Our work will create a greater
conductivity between the salt and
freshwater ecosystems surround
ing the creek," Materman said.
