# STUDENT GROUPS
## Tutors work beyond the classroom 
### SABELLE SMYTHE 
Making guacamole and playing tennis, at
first glance, seem odd complements to tutoring
programs. But both activities act as part of the
community-building mission of volunteer,
Stanford-based tutoring groups that target
underprivileged local youth.
Dream Catchers, a local tutoring program,
and the Stanford-run East Palo Alto Stanford
Academy provide free assistance to youth in the
area. Both programs try to provide a more holis
tic learning experience focusing on study
skills and healthy living, for example in addi
tion to academic help.
Others tutoring companies, like Cardinal
Learning Services, hire paid tutors and cater to
a more affluent clientele able to pay an hourly
rate. Tutors who work for Cardinal Learning
Services, which mostly serves students at Palo
Alto and Henry M. Gunn High Schools, get paid
between $2O and $5O per hour.
All these companies rely on Stanford student
tutors, usually undergraduates.
"The people who commit to tutoring are real
ly enthusiastic about the program, they're real
ly excited to be able to make a difference in the

lives of the kids," said Joseph Lester B.A. 'll
M.A. 'l2, who volunteered with East Palo Alto
Tennis and Tutoring (EPATT) for four years
before becoming EPATT operations manager.
But with so many organizations serving the
area, companies often find it necessary to differ
entiate themselves in order to attract employees
and clients.
"There's definitely a lot of competition. The
market is saturated, and every tutoring compa
ny has a different approach," said Maria
Barrera 'l3, co-founder of Cardinal Learning
Services.
One option is marketing the career prepara
tion aspect of tutoring.
"A lot of our classroom directors have
already gone on to organizations like Teach for
America," said Dream Catchers Founder Sarah
Mummah B.S. 'lO.
Another is substituting an academic-only
tutoring track for a mix of academic programs
and extracurricular programs. EPATT, for
example, offers tennis lessons alongside their
tutoring services and Dream Catchers recently
incorporated a healthy eating initiative into
their afterschool program in which students
make guacamole.

"The overarching goal is to build a really pos
itive, tightknit community for the kids in an
afterschool place where they might not other
wise have it," Mummah said about
Dream Catchers' goal of creating a sense of com
munity for students, many who are from low
income backgrounds.
EPATT's tennis program plays a comparable
role in extending the program's influence
beyond the scholastic.
"Tennis is used as away to teach life skills to
our students," Lester said. "When you're play
ing, you're put in an environment where you
have to work hard, you have to practice, you
have to prepare, and in tennis specifically you're
out there on your own. You have to have that self
confidence, that self belief. Learning how to do
that in life is a big asset and a big skill for our
students to learn."
In addition to diversifying their program
ming, tutoring groups aim to promote strong
tutor-tutee relationships. When it comes to
tutoring, these relationships can make or break
the success of the students.
"[EPATT] is not just a tutoring program; we
