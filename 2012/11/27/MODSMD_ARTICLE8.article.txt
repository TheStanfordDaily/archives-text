# Study finds French Muslims face job discrimination

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Alice Phillips 
French Muslims of African
descent are discriminated against in
the job market when their job
opportunities are compared with
those of French Christians of
African descent, according to a
study by Stanford Political Science
Professor David Laitin.

According to the researchers, the
Christian is generally two-and-a
half times more likely to be offered
an interview spot for a job than a
Muslim of the same ethnic back
ground and equal qualifications.
The study, published by the
Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, was co
authored by Claire Adida of UC-San
Diego and Marie-Anne Valfort of
Sorbonne University in France.
Laitin's team set up three fake
resumes for applicants of French
nationality to determine if there was
any discrimination in the hiring
process. "Marie Diouf" was a
French-Senegalese woman whose
name and extracurricular activities
indicate Christian affiliation.
"Khadija Diouf" was a French-
Senegalese woman whose name and
extracurricular activities indicate
Muslim affiliation.
A third candidate, "Aurelie
Menard," was created as a typical
French person born into a tradition
al French family. The inclusion of the
third resume was intended to pre
vent employers who took the survey
from noticing the survey's intention.
The researchers used Marie and
Aurelie to compete for one subset of
jobs and Khadija and Aurelie to
compete for another.
Khadija received an 8 percent
positive response rate, while Marie
received a 21 percent positive
response rate.

The researchers also found that
there was no statistical difference in
positive responses between employ
ers who received text-only resumes
and those who received resumes
along with the same photograph of
both Dioufs, indicating that neither
is North African. The photo also did
not contain any religious symbols,
which researchers said would indi
cate that Khadija was not an ortho
dox Muslim.
