## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE Sorry, Facebook, You're Not like Chairs 
### Chris Herries 
If you haven't heard, Facebook's
newest ad campaign compares
the social networking site to
common objects, showing how they
both bring people together.
Let me be the first to extend my
apologies. I'm sorry, Facebook,
you're not like chairs. Alas, you're
not like swimming pools either. To
anticipate any future ad campaigns,
you are also not like Christmas Day,
dining room tables, churches, podi
ums, pulpits, courtrooms, or coitus
though I would love to see the
ads for that last one.
You are, in truth, a glorified
email account replete with pictures,
maps, events, quips and a dozen
other things we don't care about,
but buy into anyway. I can live with
out you, Facebook, but I don't. I am,
like so many, a victim of your con
venience.
If you're not in the mood for a
lament, then put this paper down.
This column is a lament. It is a
lament for the bygone days when
shaking hands was networking, let
ter-writing was a thing, self esteem
wasn't contingent on likes and men
asked women out in person, without
alcohol.
You could argue cellphones are
equally culpable, and you'd be right.
I typically avoid texting/messaging
a conversation if a person is within a
fifty-mile radius. I prefer the raw
ness of a face-to-face conversation.
Most people would instantly agree;
it is, after all, an easy proposition to
agree with.
The problem is, I think some of
those people would be fibbing. I'm
often talking with someone who
whips out their phone mid-conver
sation, acting like it's neither an
insult nor a distraction. Or there's
the tedious texter in class who
seems to be holding fifteen "conver
sations" at once. There's the Ã¼biqui
tous practice of flirting with people
over Facebook, email or texts, say
ing things you wouldn't have the
guts or guile to say in person. Then
there are the people who use tech
nology as a medium for cancella
tions, evasions and apologies. It's
sickening that important things
such as breakups or apologies are
done via text.
I know why we do it. Personal
interactions can suck. Nothing bites
like being turned down by your first
crush. I know, because I remember
it distinctly. I caught her outside
Arrillaga Family Dining Commons
and asked if she wanted to go for a
hike and picnic, just the two of us, over
the coming weekend. Fortunately

for me, she declined with tact and
grace. That didn't leave me feeling
any less vulnerable or emasculated.

The solace is that what I did took
courage. I didn't email it to her. I
didn't try to slip it into a text. We
ate a few meals together in the din
ing halls, and then I was honest
about my intentions. I try to adopt
the same attitude with all my
friends. If I care about someone, I'll
invite them for a walk, or for coffee,
or any sort of intimate conversa
tional setting.
I encourage everyone to do the
same. Pick someone you want to get
to know and hang out with them
one-on-one. Taking the time to sit
down and have a frank conversation
with the people you love is some
thing Facebook can never replicate.
Go further. I've been trying to
leave my cell phone in my room so
I'm more fully engaged with the
world around me. We should choose
when to check our phones, not have
our phones dictate when they're
checked. Those chattering little
boxes shouldn't intrude, or be
allowed to intrude.
Ultimately, the use of technology
is about how much you want to be
living your own life. Just because
technology is available doesn't
mean it augments our existence; it
may actually detract from it.
Facebook and text messaging pro
vide convenience at a great cost. We
often confuse this convenience for
personal interaction, to our detri
ment. Use these conveniences as a
way to set up interactions, not as a
medium for interaction.
The more these types of tech
nologies pervade a person's life, the
worse that life becomes. You miss
out on the fantastic and beautiful
world around you that can both
engage and captivate your senses.
You lose the personal chemistry
associated with real interaction. You
can end up alienating people, and
harming your ability to interact
with the real world.
Let me end on a more positive
note. I had invited two friends out
to dinner, and we agreed on a
mutual meeting place. When I
arrived my friend told me she
couldn't go. She actually biked all
the way out to tell me she couldn't
make it. She honored my invitation
by showing up and explaining her
self in person. I have nothing but
respect for that.
