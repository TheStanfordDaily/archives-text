## Card looks to rebound against Redhawks 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team has
shown flashes of the greatness that had many
top college analysts predicting it would earn a
bid to March's NCAA Tournament. Over the
last week, Stanford played a talented
Belmont team very closely, came within four
points of No. 13 Missouri with under two min
utes remaining and was all knotted up with
Minnesota just as time was about to expire.
However, costly mistakes in each of these con
tests left the Cardinal empty handed, as it
dropped each of these very winnable games.
Stanford (4-3) will look to right the ship
this Wednesday night when Seattle (2-1) rolls
into Maples Pavilion for a nonconference
game. The Redhawks are coming off of a 58-
49 win over Pacific Lutheran and will be look
ing to use this momentum to pick up an upset
win over Stanford. Any win against a Pac-12
team would be huge for Seattle, as it would
surely send a message to the rest of the WAC
conference.
The Cardinal defense has been under
whelming in the first stages of this season and
tonight it will have the difficult task of slowing
down the freshman duo of redshirt freshman
forward Deshaun Sunderhaus and redshirt
junior forward Trent Clarence. The 6-foot-9
Sunderhaus has been a force in the paint,
leading the team with 21 rebounds (7.0 per
game) through his first three games. He also
hasn't had much trouble with his shooting
touch thus far, being second in scoring, with
10.7 points per game, and going a solid 13 for
29 from the field (.448 percent).
However, what makes the young forward
so dangerous is his versatility. He is one of the
rare big men who can wreak havoc both at the
baseline and beyond the arc. He is shooting
.750 percent from the three-point line and
does not shy away from an opportunity to
shoot the long ball.
Clarence began his collegiate career in the
Pac-12, playing for the conference-champion
Washington squad that advanced to the
regional semifinals in the NCAA tournament
