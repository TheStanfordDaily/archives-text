## Card looks to rebound against Redhawks 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team has
shown flashes of the greatness that had many
top college analysts predicting it would earn a
bid to March's NCAA Tournament. Over the
last week, Stanford played a talented
Belmont team very closely, came within four
points of No. 13 Missouri with under two min
utes remaining and was all knotted up with
Minnesota just as time was about to expire.
However, costly mistakes in each of these con
tests left the Cardinal empty handed, as it
dropped each of these very winnable games.
Stanford (4-3) will look to right the ship
this Wednesday night when Seattle (2-1) rolls
into Maples Pavilion for a nonconference
game. The Redhawks are coming off of a 58-
49 win over Pacific Lutheran and will be look
ing to use this momentum to pick up an upset
win over Stanford. Any win against a Pac-12
team would be huge for Seattle, as it would
surely send a message to the rest of the WAC
conference.
The Cardinal defense has been under
whelming in the first stages of this season and
tonight it will have the difficult task of slowing
down the freshman duo of redshirt freshman
forward Deshaun Sunderhaus and redshirt
junior forward Trent Clarence. The 6-foot-9
Sunderhaus has been a force in the paint,
leading the team with 21 rebounds (7.0 per
game) through his first three games. He also
hasn't had much trouble with his shooting
touch thus far, being second in scoring, with
10.7 points per game, and going a solid 13 for
29 from the field (.448 percent).
However, what makes the young forward
so dangerous is his versatility. He is one of the
rare big men who can wreak havoc both at the
baseline and beyond the arc. He is shooting
.750 percent from the three-point line and
does not shy away from an opportunity to
shoot the long ball.
Clarence began his collegiate career in the
Pac-12, playing for the conference-champion
Washington squad that advanced to the
regional semifinals in the NCAA tournament

in 2010. He brings veteran
leadership and the ability to
finish around the basket to
the young Redhawks team.
Clarence is leading the team
in scoring, averaging 12.3
points per game on .423 per
cent from the field. He pitch
es in on the defensive end as
well, averaging six rebounds
and 1.3 steals per game. Still,
he will surely be looking to
take better care of the ball as
he has already turned it over
15 times (five per game).
Both players will look to
exploit a Stanford defense

that has underperformed
thus far. After opening the
season with four straight
wins, the Cardinal has
stalled, dropping three of its
last four contests. The strong
play of junior forward
Dwight Powell, who has
made huge strides following
his sophomore year, has not
been enough for a Stanford
team that has committed too
many mental mistakes.
Individually, many of the
Card's top players are per
forming well, as sophomore
forward Chasson Randle has
lived up to expectations, lead
ing the team with 15.4 points
per game. Powell is not far
behind, averaging a solid 13
points per game. Timely
turnovers and fouls have

been Stanford's undoing this
season, as their worst basket
ball in each of its losses has
come in the last two minutes.
This is uncharacteristic
for a squad run by Stanford
head coach Johnny Dawkins.
The Cardinal will look to
improve its second half play
against Seattle, getting back
on track in the process. The
team has big plans this sea
son, but with a talented Pac
-12 field that includes 10th
ranked Arizona, 19th-ranked
Colorado, UCLA and Oregon,
it will need to cut back on the
mental errors. Wednesday
night is the perfect opportu
nity to begin.

Sophomore Chasson Randle (5) had 22 points as Stanford came up short in a loss to No. 13
Missouri and poured in a game-high 21 in the Cardinal's win over Northern lowa last week.
in 2010. He brings veteran
leadership and the ability to
finish around the basket to
the young Redhawks team.
Clarence is leading the team
in scoring, averaging 12.3
points per game on .423 per
cent from the field. He pitch
es in on the defensive end as
well, averaging six rebounds
and 1.3 steals per game. Still,
he will surely be looking to
take better care of the ball as
he has already turned it over
15 times (five per game).
Both players will look to
exploit a Stanford defense

that has underperformed
thus far. After opening the
season with four straight
wins, the Cardinal has
stalled, dropping three of its
last four contests. The strong
play of junior forward
Dwight Powell, who has
made huge strides following
his sophomore year, has not
been enough for a Stanford
team that has committed too
many mental mistakes.
Individually, many of the
Card's top players are per
forming well, as sophomore
forward Chasson Randle has
lived up to expectations, lead
ing the team with 15.4 points
per game. Powell is not far
behind, averaging a solid 13
points per game. Timely
turnovers and fouls have

been Stanford's undoing this
season, as their worst basket
ball in each of its losses has
come in the last two minutes.
This is uncharacteristic
for a squad run by Stanford
head coach Johnny Dawkins.
The Cardinal will look to
improve its second half play
against Seattle, getting back
on track in the process. The
team has big plans this sea
son, but with a talented Pac
-12 field that includes 10th
ranked Arizona, 19th-ranked
Colorado, UCLA and Oregon,
it will need to cut back on the
mental errors. Wednesday
night is the perfect opportu
nity to begin.
