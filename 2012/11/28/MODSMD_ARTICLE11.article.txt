## SITTIN' ON THE JOHN The 						art of addiction 
### John Murray 
Like the average American, I
spent most of my
Thanksgiving break relaxing,
watching football, eating my fair
share of mashed potatoes and
catching up with friends and family.
I also spent a lot of time on my
phone.

Yes, having spent the past four
years of my life bouncing from
cheap brick phone to brick phone, I
officially became an iPhone guy as
of four weeks ago, diving headfirst
into the world of mobile social net
working. It's safe to say that I've
been addicted ever since.

During commercial breaks,
while Skyping my parents, in the
back of CS lecture, in between writ
ing paragraphs of this column, on
the toilet: It's out, it's on, and it's
perusing those photos from last
night. Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat, Twitter got 'em all.
Each one is conveniently set to alert
me every time someone messages
me, likes my photo, etc., yet I still
find myself constantly opening the
various apps without prompting,
and, when finding no new notifica
tions or messages needing
response, hitting refresh a few
times, just to be sure. Still nothing?
Then I'm browsing the Twitter
feed, scrolling through last night's
Instagrams, possibly contemplat
ing clever statuses.

One of my favorite writers has
always been David Foster Wallace.
And one of the ideas that has
always been closely connected to
Wallace's work is that as
Americans, we are a "nation of
addicts." Wallace himself, like many
of his characters, struggled with
drug and alcohol addictions, and for
the longest time I always associated
his notion of nationwide "addiction"
with substance abuse. But I'm
beginning to see that visualizing
our country's many addictions on
such a simple scale is to court com
plete ignorance.

We are addicted to many things:
alcohol, sex, football, reality T\(
and, as I've discovered through my
own personal experience, social
media. And while my own level of
addiction may be unique, I know
I'm not the only one with Facebook
open in the other tab right now.
The online social realm, while
reflective of the outside world, has
never been a very accurate recre
ation of it. Digital mediums are
almost always bent toward exag
gerating those parts of our real
lives that are most attractive and
envious, as we habitually fill our
"profiles" with not what is most
personal to us or best defines us,
but what it is that we would most
like to share with other people. It's
a digital playground that curbs per
sonalities on the basis of strict soci
etal (and, to a lesser extent, profes
sional) expectations. Almost every
Facebook post or photo is generat
ed with the audience in mind and
I know I'm not the only one who has
that little voice in the back of their
head every time they take a picture
at a party wondering how it would

look through a filter, or how many
likes it might generate. (Or maybe I
am. That's sad.) While social norms
exist in every setting, they seem to
be hyperinflated in a digital world
that ties all of your interactions into
one, mostly permanent, personal
portfolio.

One of the great draws of
Instagram, and one of the big rea
sons behind its recent popularity
surge, is its ability to instantly
"beautify" things for us, to remove
the decision-making process behind
whether to post a photo or not by
taking our mostly bland, uninspir
ing photos and enhancing them
with a variety of tonal filters, mak
ing them immediately presentable.
It is extremely difficult to make a
bad Instagram photo: It's a social
platform built entirely on artificial,
unnatural beauty that of the
cloudy, just-off-of-reality photo.
The only social media platform
that really encourages you to disre
gard most social norms and expec
tations, and dare to be weird just
for the sake of being weird, is
Snapchat. And what does it do with
the spontaneous photos you take?
Deletes them in a matter of sec
onds. There seems to be a sublimi
nal admission in this, an admission
of the dog and pony show of other
social networks: when you
Snapchat, it feels like you're getting
away with taboo, that you're getting
away with breaking the rules of
social media at least for a few
seconds.

But what does it mean? What
does it mean to be addicted to these
various forms of style-over-reality
communication? It's not as if before
social media everyone was best
friends with everyone, having deep
conversations on life and love that
have slowly been replaced by reels
of likes and comments. I certainly
don't want to come across like some
old baby boomer who thinks
Facebook and reality TV represent
the downfall of our civilization. But
I do think that there is something to
be said about this specific addiction
of our societies: the hyperactivity of
social networks and their ever
present existence.

I think it's drastically changing
the way in which we inherently
understand ourselves. I see my
phone as a gateway from actual John
to digital John (the line between the
two Johns slowly disintegrating), a
gateway into an easier world where
things are mostly pretty and funny
and ironic and clever and filtered. It's
a world I find myself escaping into
constantly. It scares me how easy the
temptation to simply sit and scroll
through my various feeds takes hold,
but what has helped me ease this
fear is the very brainless act of con
tinuing to scroll.
Where does it lead? It's a hard
question. I could think about it, or I
could go back to my newsfeed.
Take a wild guess as to which I'll
do.

ed with the audience in mind and
I know I'm not the only one who has
that little voice in the back of their
head every time they take a picture
at a party wondering how it would

look through a filter, or how many
likes it might generate. (Or maybe I
am. That's sad.) While social norms
exist in every setting, they seem to
be hyperinflated in a digital world
that ties all of your interactions into
one, mostly permanent, personal
portfolio.

One of the great draws of
Instagram, and one of the big rea
sons behind its recent popularity
surge, is its ability to instantly
"beautify" things for us, to remove
the decision-making process behind
whether to post a photo or not by
taking our mostly bland, uninspir
ing photos and enhancing them
with a variety of tonal filters, mak
ing them immediately presentable.
It is extremely difficult to make a
bad Instagram photo: It's a social
platform built entirely on artificial,
unnatural beauty that of the
cloudy, just-off-of-reality photo.
The only social media platform
that really encourages you to disre
gard most social norms and expec
tations, and dare to be weird just
for the sake of being weird, is
Snapchat. And what does it do with
the spontaneous photos you take?
Deletes them in a matter of sec
onds. There seems to be a sublimi
nal admission in this, an admission
of the dog and pony show of other
social networks: when you
Snapchat, it feels like you're getting
away with taboo, that you're getting
away with breaking the rules of
social media at least for a few
seconds.

But what does it mean? What
does it mean to be addicted to these
various forms of style-over-reality
communication? It's not as if before
social media everyone was best
friends with everyone, having deep
conversations on life and love that
have slowly been replaced by reels
of likes and comments. I certainly
don't want to come across like some
old baby boomer who thinks
Facebook and reality TV represent
the downfall of our civilization. But
I do think that there is something to
be said about this specific addiction
of our societies: the hyperactivity of
social networks and their ever
present existence.

I think it's drastically changing
the way in which we inherently
understand ourselves. I see my
phone as a gateway from actual John
to digital John (the line between the
two Johns slowly disintegrating), a
gateway into an easier world where
things are mostly pretty and funny
and ironic and clever and filtered. It's
a world I find myself escaping into
constantly. It scares me how easy the
temptation to simply sit and scroll
through my various feeds takes hold,
but what has helped me ease this
fear is the very brainless act of con
tinuing to scroll.
Where does it lead? It's a hard
question. I could think about it, or I
could go back to my newsfeed.
Take a wild guess as to which I'll
do.

Like the average American, I
spent most of my
Thanksgiving break relaxing,
watching football, eating my fair
share of mashed potatoes and
catching up with friends and family.
I also spent a lot of time on my
phone.

Yes, having spent the past four
years of my life bouncing from
cheap brick phone to brick phone, I
officially became an iPhone guy as
of four weeks ago, diving headfirst
into the world of mobile social net
working. It's safe to say that I've
been addicted ever since.

During commercial breaks,
while Skyping my parents, in the
back of CS lecture, in between writ
ing paragraphs of this column, on
the toilet: It's out, it's on, and it's
perusing those photos from last
night. Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat, Twitter got 'em all.
Each one is conveniently set to alert
me every time someone messages
me, likes my photo, etc., yet I still
find myself constantly opening the
various apps without prompting,
and, when finding no new notifica
tions or messages needing
response, hitting refresh a few
times, just to be sure. Still nothing?
Then I'm browsing the Twitter
feed, scrolling through last night's
Instagrams, possibly contemplat
ing clever statuses.

One of my favorite writers has
always been David Foster Wallace.
And one of the ideas that has
always been closely connected to
Wallace's work is that as
Americans, we are a "nation of
addicts." Wallace himself, like many
of his characters, struggled with
drug and alcohol addictions, and for
the longest time I always associated
his notion of nationwide "addiction"
with substance abuse. But I'm
beginning to see that visualizing
our country's many addictions on
such a simple scale is to court com
plete ignorance.

We are addicted to many things:
alcohol, sex, football, reality T\(
and, as I've discovered through my
own personal experience, social
media. And while my own level of
addiction may be unique, I know
I'm not the only one with Facebook
open in the other tab right now.
The online social realm, while
reflective of the outside world, has
never been a very accurate recre
ation of it. Digital mediums are
almost always bent toward exag
gerating those parts of our real
lives that are most attractive and
envious, as we habitually fill our
"profiles" with not what is most
personal to us or best defines us,
but what it is that we would most
like to share with other people. It's
a digital playground that curbs per
sonalities on the basis of strict soci
etal (and, to a lesser extent, profes
sional) expectations. Almost every
Facebook post or photo is generat
ed with the audience in mind and
I know I'm not the only one who has
