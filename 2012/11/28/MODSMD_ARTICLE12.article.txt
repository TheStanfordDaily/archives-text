# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Stanford activists are complicit in Gaza violence 
### Adam Johnson 
It is a widely accepted truth that
military leaders, dating back
centuries, have sometimes
viewed it in their best interests to
have their own state harmed. In its
most deliberate form, this is car
ried out by a false flag attack,
where a state will pose as a foreign
entity and attack its own citizens.
Other times, a state will promote a
foreign attack and/or have
advanced knowledge of an attack
and do little, if anything, to protect
its citizenry. These attacks not only
serve to unify a country behind a
cause, but can also be used to cre
ate foreign sympathizers and allies;
this latter purpose is especially rel
evant in an age of global intercon
nectedness through digital media.
How does this military philoso
phy apply to the violence in Gaza?
Approximately one hundred
Palestinian civilians died during the
weeklong Operation Pillar of
Defense, mainly as a result of
Israeli airstrikes. On the other side,
four Israeli civilians died as a result
of Hamas rocket fire. Many in the
foreign media were quick to label
this disparity as evidence of an
injustice committed by Israel. The
numbers, however, do not tell the
entire story. Israel's civilian death
toll is relatively low due to an
unparalleled effort to protect its
citizenry. Hamas, however, deliber
ately risks the lives of Palestinians.
Not only did Hamas provoke the
Israeli attacks by firing hundreds
of rockets per year into southern
Israel they also placed
Palestinian civilians directly in
harm's way; rockets were fired
from, and presumably stored in,
densely populated areas. When the
Israeli military targeted these
stockpiles and the militants associ
ated with them, civilian casualties
necessarily resulted.
Many in the media, however,

will have you believe that the civil
ian casualties are solely the respon
sibility of Israel and its closest
allies. On the surface, this appears
true. Israeli missiles, after all, are
directly responsible for these
deaths. Ending the analysis there,
however, is a mistake. Not only did
the Israeli military attempt to warn
Palestinian civilians in advance of
strikes after all, civilian casual
ties only serve to worsen Israel's
image abroad but Hamas delib
erately puts Palestinians in danger
and it should be held accountable
for that.
Yet as long as members of the
media continue to place the blame
on Israel for civilian casualties, why
should Hamas act any differently?
The more Palestinians killed the
more photographs of dead
Palestinian children displayed
prominently by the foreign media
the more support Hamas
receives and thus the more likely
they are to continue their reckless
tactics.
Two recent opinion pieces by

Stanford students fit under this
category of one-sided journalism:
"Stanford, we are complicit in Gaza
violence," published by my col
league Rristian Davis Bailey 'l4 on
the Stanford Daily blog, and a sim
ilar piece on the activist blog
Stanford Static written by "stu
dents concerned about the siege on
Gaza." As the authors of the Static
piece write, "given the death of
many Palestinian civilians and our
complicity in this violence as
Stanford students, we have a
responsibility to do something
about it."

Indeed, Stanford students are
complicit, and we do have a respon
sibility to act. But not just in the way
that Bailey and the Static activists
envision. Rather, certain Stanford
students are complicit in the vio
lence by solely blaming Israel for
civilian casualties that are as much a
result of Hamas' actions as those of
Israel. Such endorsements of
Hamas only ensure that their gener
al disregard for Palestinian lives will
continue. Our responsibility, then, is
to look beyond the civilian casualty
numbers and ask why those casual
ties occur.

I am not saying Israel is perfect.
It is not. But even if you believe
Hamas' end is just, their means are
most definitely not; they not only
indiscriminately fire rockets into
Israeli population centers, but also
needlessly risk Palestinian lives by
firing these rockets from heavily
populated areas. If you are in favor
of protecting innocent lives, you
should not tolerate either. Yet the
aforementioned Stanford pieces,
and similar ones published
throughout the international
media, do nothing to stop the vio
lence they only encourage it.

Hamas puts
Palestinians in
danger, and
should be held
accountable.
