# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## In response to "Keep it casual" 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Thank you for all of your emails about
my recent article "Keep it casual" (Oct.
30). I didn't expect the content to res
onate with so many people, and when it did it
made me stop and think about what Stanford
would look like without the pressure to keep
everything casual, and what we could do to
make it more like that. The truth is, I don't
know, but here is my best shot. I hope you can
take what is useful to you and leave the rest.
1. Stop comparing yourself to others. The
root of the casual epidemic is feeling average
in a pool of exceptional individuals. It is use
less to feel down because you think you don't
have as many friends as so and so, or because
you don't feel as attractive as what's her face.
Learn to measure your self-worth based on
intrinsic qualities. Feel confident in your
school work because you are curious and you
apply yourself, not because your TA likes
your essays. Know that you are sexy because
you rock that dress, not because Douchey
McDouchebag wants to take it off.
2. Invest yourself in people. This takes
time. It's easy to fall into the trap of overzeal
ously investing yourself in the first people
you meet in your freshman dorm, only to
realize that you don't have much in common
after all. On the other hand, it's also easy to
spend loads of time with the same people
without investing yourself substantively.
Proximity only engenders intimacy when
paired with curiosity and effort. Get curious

about your friends, even the ones you know
the best, and try to know someone, truly.
3. Open up. When you tell people exactly
how you are feeling, up or down, you give
them a gift. You show them that you won't
judge them if they exhibit some human ten
dencies and have good days and bad days like
everyone else. Don't confuse optimism and
denial. Please, do try to see silver linings, but
don't force them onto emotional laundry
loads that need to be washed. Sometimes you
need to process even the overwhelming
things that you would rather not. Don't feel
like you're burdening someone by opening up
to them. Even Jay-Z has 99 problems.
4. Honor the world your friend lives in.
Your own priorities may be very different
from your best friend's, but that doesn't
make his any less valid. Even if it is a mys
tery to you why he spends three days on a
problem set, honor his choice to do so. It is
dangerous to walk through the world insist
ing that everyone's priorities align with your
own, and it can be useful to understand what
matters to other people.
5. Listen. Listen honestly, wholeheartedly,
and patiently, to as many people as you can.
When you bump into an acquaintance and
back out of the conversation with "we should
get coffee sometime," consider actually get
ting coffee sometime.
6. Be clear with your peers. Take the time
to figure out what you want, and make sure

you convey that to other people. Don't mess
with peoples' emotions, whether you know
them platonically, romantically or profession
ally. Be gentle breaking the news to someone
if it turns out you want different things, but
do break the news before they feel humiliat
ed.
7. Take responsibility for your choices.
Some choices may have less favorable conse
quences than others say cheating on your
boyfriend versus deciding to eat spaghetti.
Own them equally, and don't try to lay
responsibility on the social climate at school,

or your peers' decisions or your mood. If you
take responsibility for every choice you
make, it's harder to casually wreak havoc on
others without suffering the corresponding
consequences.
Above all, be respectful and follow that
cheesy rule to treat people the way you want
to be treated. I'm still puzzled on this one, so
I welcome your advice on the casual conun
drum. In the meantime, keep it real.

responsibility on the social climate at school,

or your peers' decisions or your mood. If you
take responsibility for every choice you
make, it's harder to casually wreak havoc on
others without suffering the corresponding
consequences.
Above all, be respectful and follow that
cheesy rule to treat people the way you want
to be treated. I'm still puzzled on this one, so
I welcome your advice on the casual conun
drum. In the meantime, keep it real.
