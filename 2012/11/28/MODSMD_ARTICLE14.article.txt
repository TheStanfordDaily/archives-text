## Dunning named Pac-12 Coach of the Year and six players receive conference honors 
### â€“ Tom Taylor 
Stanford head coach John
Dunning was named Pac-12 Coach
of the Year yesterday, after guiding
the Stanford women's volleyball
team to a 27-3 season and losing
just one game in the Pac-12 to win
the conference crown with a 19-1
record.

Though none of the Cardinal's
players were rewarded with Player
of the Year honors, which were won
by the libero from USC and outside
hitter and setter from Oregon, four
of the fourteen athletes named to
the All-Pac-12 team are Stanford
students: junior middle blocker
Carly Wopat, freshman middle
blocker Inky Ajanaku, freshman
outside hitter Jordan Burgess and
freshman outside hitter Brittany
Howard. A fifth Stanford player,
junior outside hitter Rachel

Williams, was also given an honor
able mention award and Wopat's
nomination marked her second con
secutive selection.

In a warning for the other
eleven schools in this conference,
four Cardinal players were also list
ed on the seven-member Pac-12 All-
Freshmen team: setter Madi Bugg
joined Ajanaku, Burgess and
Howard. With all six of these play
ers due to return next year,
Stanford will likely be a strong
favorite to win the Pac-12 confer
ence again next season.
Having wrapped up the regular
season over the Thanksgiving
break, the Cardinal will now face
Jackson State at Maples Pavilion at
8 p.m. this Friday in the first round
of the NCAA Tournament. A win
over the Tigers would set up a sec
ond-round meeting against either
Western Kentucky or Loyola
Marymount on Saturday evening.
