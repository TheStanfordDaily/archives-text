## Fire alarms malfunction at Stern Hall Residents evacuated five times this fall quarter 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
Students in Stern Hall have
been forced to evacuate their resi
dences five times this year due to
faulty fire alarms. The faulty
alarms were the result of upgrades
made to the fire alarm system over
the summer.

Alarms have also gone off sever
al times because of routine system
testing that occurred after resi
dents moved in, according to state
ment from Rodger Whitney, execu
tive director of Student Housing.
The faulty alarms at Stern
occurred twice in one night around
midnight, and on another occasion
around 10 a.m. In several instances
residents were evacuated for about
15 minutes while firefighters
searched the dorms.
"I had to leave my work and go
outside and stop my train of
thought in the middle," said Lauren
Nguyen 'l5. "I was pretty annoyed
by the alarms. I had to stop what
ever I was doing to go outside and
it was a false alarm."
Others were interrupted by the
alarms while sleeping or eating a
meal.
"The fire alarms went off one
time when I was trying to sleep. I
just ignored it for a bit but eventu
ally I came down," said Elisha
Marquez 'l6. "A couple people did
stay, but they are really hard to
ignore so eventually people left.
There is no way to sleep through
them."
Brian Leahy 'l6 debated stay
ing in his dorm during the third
alarm malfunction. Leahy said he
was sleeping when the alarm went
off, and he initially planned to wait
through the alarm because he pre
dicted that it was just malfunction
ing. He eventually left because of
the noise.
"They've gone off so many times
and it's kind of desensitizing people
to the entire purpose of the fire
alarm," Leahy said. "People are
just not really taking it seriously
anymore. The more it goes off with
out any real fire, the more people
start to think it's just not working
properly."
Leahy said that the fire alarms
also went off when he was on his
way to a meal, and he had to evacu
ate the building and wait to eat
until after the building was inspect
ed by firefighters. He said that
while the frequency of the alarms
has allowed students to practice
