# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford TB screening tool solves inmate crisis 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ileana Najarro 
Growing rates of tuberculosis (TB) among
inmates in former Soviet Union nations may come to
an end with a new tool developed by Stanford
researchers.
Gene Xpert, a cost-effective drug resistance
screening tool, was developed by a team from the
Stanford School of Medicine and the Stanford Center
for Health Policy under the Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies. The tool is predicted to
reduce the rate of tuberculosis in Russian and Eastern
European prisons by 20 percent in four years.
Approximately 400,000 cases of tuberculosis were
diagnosed last year in 15 countries including Russia,
Latvia and Tajikistan. Of those, 80,000 cases were
registered as having drug-resistant tuberculosis.
"Drug-resistant TB is rampant in prisons," said
Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert, lead researcher and
assistant professor of medicine, in a Stanford News
Service article. "When infected prisoners get out,
they are thought to drive the TB epidemic in the gen
eral population. We are looking to find better ways to
deal with that."
The researchers estimate that their tool would sur
pass the current screening methods suggested by the
World Health Organization: inmates self-reporting
symptoms, interviewing
prisoners about their health
and administering chest X
rays.
The Gene Xpert tool
instantly detects tuberculo
sis and its drug-resistant
genetic mutations. While it
would cost about $7l per
prisoner to conduct mass
screenings, Goldhaber-
Fiebert said the health bene
fits make the additional
spending worthwhile.
The findings of the
Gene Xpert research can be
found online in the PLOS
Medicine journal.
