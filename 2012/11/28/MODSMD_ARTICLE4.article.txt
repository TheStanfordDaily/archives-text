## The 						slow move to digital textbooks 
### ANDREW MARGRAVE 
In what will be a welcome shift for students
paying more than $3OO dollars for a single text
book, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan
declared in September that physical textbooks
should be "obsolete" over the next few years,
arguing that the United States should transi
tion quickly to digitized educational material.
Even closer to campus, California Governor
Jerry Brown hopes to make California the
spearhead for the national transition to elec
tronic textbooks.

According to a recent study conducted by
Course Smart, an electronic textbook provider,
98 percent of college students who own a device
have used it for school and 53 percent of these
students read electronic textbooks frequently.
Companies like Course Smart emphasize the
reduced cost sometimes by up to 60 percent

and ease of access as a draw for students. Yet
thus far, including at Stanford, traditional text
books have kept their advantage.
According to the National Association of
College Stores, students estimate they spend
around $655 annually on required course mate
rials, a figure that has seen only marginal
decreases in recent years. Only 10 percent of
this fall quarter's textbooks were provided elec
tronically in the Stanford Bookstore, including,
for example, the Economics 1A textbook,
"Principles of Economics," that has a new book
sticker price of over $3OO.
The Stanford Bookstore offers a number of
alternatives to the standard costs, consistent
with the belief expressed by Store Director
Janet Gawley that "no single platform, device
or format can fully satisfy the needs of stu-

dents."
While the Bookstore has
stalled the slow transition to
electronic options, another
Stanford group, the Stanford
Intellectual Property
Exchange (SIPX), is working
on coordinating course-pack
content with library-licensed
material.
SIPX, a cloud-based net
work that began in April
2011, identifies what copy
right access a user possesses
and can pool resources and
content to produce course
packs. SIPX has saved stu
dents from 25 to 78 percent
off their course materials,

according to their website.
"The Libraries are
deeply involved with the pro
vision of digital access to
licensed academic informa
tion to the campus," said
Library Communications
Director Andrew Herkovic.
"That happily translates into
making it possible for stu
dents to use digital resources
at no charge."
Technological innovation
in textbook publishing goes
beyond converting texts to a
cheaper digital format. Cindy
Clarke, Course Smart vice
president of marketing, pre
dicts "better data and analyt
ics will play a role in tracking
student success, further aid
ing student retention and
improving engagement and
learning outcomes."
"With better analytics,

instructors will be able to
have actionable insights on
where to focus students with
their course materials to help
improve performance," she
said.
However, there seems to
be a disconnect between the
tools and alternatives offered
and students' use of these
resources. In the near future,
it is unlikely that digital text
books with replace physical
textbooks, meaning a com
pletely online experience
may be out of reach.
According to Clarke,
"[CourseSmart] does not
believe that traditional text
books will ever completely
disappear from the higher
education landscape."
