# New center for genomics
## Bustamante and Feldman to lead interdisciplinary center 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
After 18 months of planning, the Dean of the
School of Humanities & Sciences, Richard
Sailer, recently gave final approval for a new
center that will fill the need for a unified
genomics research center on campus. Led by
genetics professor Carlos Bustamante and biol
ogy professor Marc Feldman Ph.D. '69, the new
Stanford Center for Computational,
Evolutionary and Human Genomics is predicted
to improve the University's reputation in the
field, as well as draw top talent to Stanford.
While the official University announcement
has not yet been made, outgoing School of
Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo shared news about
the center in his last full newsletter, which was
published on Nov. 5.
"There was a recognition among the admin
istration of how significant and vital it was to
support this project and take a risk," Sailer said.
Prom the beginning, the Center was envi
sioned as the next step in Stanford's legacy of
interdisciplinary research dating back to the
19605. Feldman sees the center as a continuation
of the work started by his doctoral advisor, the
late Samuel Karlin, who led Stanford to promi
nence as an institution dedicated to interdiscipli
nary research efforts and is recognized as one of
the great applied mathematicians.
"The Stanford school of interdisciplinary
research continues to thrive, and with this new
center, we hope to continue that tradition of
excellence," Feldman said.
The Center has plans to include faculty
members from the School of Humanities &
Sciences, School of Engineering, School of
Medicine and the Stanford Law School.
Bustamante noted that while the need for a uni
fied genomics research center was recognized, a
concerted effort to establish one only began
recently.
Unlike Bio-X, which has the goal of "support
ing interdisciplinary research connected to biol
ogy and medicine," according to its website, the
new center will have a more specific mission.
"Bio-X has a broad focus, whereas this cen
ter is focused solely on genomics and its applica
tions," Feldman said.
Chiefly, the Center will specialize in the
analysis of big data with a smaller emphasis on
lab work.
In the next five years, the Center, using seed
funding from the School of Humanities &
Sciences and the Office of the Provost, aims to
gradually wean itself off of the University and
eventually become viable through external
research grants and philanthropic contribu
tions. In the beginning, the directors foresee a
concentrated effort on building collective knowl
edge by sponsoring colloquia, symposia and lec
tures, hiring new postdoctoral fellows and
engaging in genomic consulting for academics
and industry.
In the long run, the Center's goal is to main
tain and expand Stanford's reputation in the
field, as well as broaden applications in
genomics, help with external recruitment and
add new research in the field.
