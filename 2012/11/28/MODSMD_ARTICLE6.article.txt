# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU considers spending reserve funds 
### OLIVIA MOORE 
At their Nov. 27 meeting, the
Undergraduate Senate discussed a bill
that would allocate $40,000 from their
general fees funds to student group
events in winter quarter.
The bill, which will be voted on at
next week's meeting, proposes the cre
ation of a pilot program called
"Redefining Winter: The 40K
Challenge," which would allow the
Senate to allocate up to $40,000 from its
more than $1.2 million in reserve funds
to groups hosting on-campus events.
The program would allow general
fees groups that could use more funding
than the $6,000 maximum to apply for
grants. The "40K Challenge" bill was
proposed after the Appropriations
Committee discussed ways to reduce the
size of the reserve and buffer funds with
assistant financial manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3.
"We wanted to find away to use it
that would help benefit student life on
campus," said Appropriations
Committee Chair Nancy Pham 'l4.
Appropriations Committee members

are currently in the process of determin
ing a set of guidelines to decide whether
or not a group's application should be
approved.
Pham said that while the committee
has not yet decided how large the grants
will be, they are considering creating an
$B,OOO grant and several grants ranging
from $2,000 to $3,000.
Senators debated whether or not the
grants should only be given to groups
that run established events or to groups
that want to create new events.
Nanci Howe, associate dean and
director of Student Activities
Leadership, said that, because of the
pilot program's winter quarter launch,
the Senate should consider allocating
funding only to groups with established
events. She said it would be "impossible"
for a group to plan and execute a new
event in such a short period of time.
Howe also advised senators to allo
cate the funds to larger events that
require more money.
"Fund two or three events with that
$40,000 and have a new impact," Howe
said. "One thousand dollars or $2,000
will have no impact, in my opinion."

Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 asked about
the possibility of individuals receiving
funding to launch events. According to
Howe, this is prohibited by University
policy, as individuals would need a group
sponsor to take on the responsibility and
liability for the event. Deputy Chair
Garima Sharma 'l5 said that money
from the general fees reserves could
only go to general fees groups, whose
unspent money makes up the reserves,
and not to individuals.
While some senators were wary
about voting on the bill due to the cur
rent lack of guidelines, Sharma said that
the proposal will be refined by next
week, when the Senate will vote on it.
When Senator Brandon Hightower 'l5
asked if they could wait to vote on the
bill until winter quarter, Sharma
expressed concern about the bill being
postponed indefinitely if it is not voted
on next week.
"This is something that is going to
get rid of the money that we should have
ideally gotten rid of," said Sharma.
"Right now, this is what we should do."
