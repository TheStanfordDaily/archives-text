## Your university needs you 
### George Chen 
At an institution that
boasts an unparalleled
combination of out
standing academics
and top-notch athlet
ics, it's hard to imagine how fan atten
dance at sporting events can be so
awful. But that's the reality at
Stanford. Don't toy to deny it it's
god-awful.
I've never written a column about
poor crowd attendance at Stanford
athletic events, despite the fact that
it's baffled me for the past year. One,
because I didn't really think wilting a
column could make a difference. And
two, it's not always fun criticizing a
community that you're a part of.
But when the tickets for Friday's
Pac-12 Championship Game, less
than 72 hours away, still aren't sold
out yet, I feel obligated to address
this issue, even if it is a vain attempt.
To be sure, I'm not the only writer
trying to tackle this problem. My fel
low desk editor Tom Taylor just yes
terday narrated an inspiring tale of
how he transformed his apathy
towards Stanford football into a loyal
following that few fans can match. My
managing editor Miles Bennett-
Smith also aptly expressed his disap
pointment with the poor crowd atten
dance this season. Both of them
voiced their encouragements for
greater fan support more eloquently
than I ever could.
But I'm not here to give you the
reasons for why you should go to the
game. What I'm telling you instead is
that unless you have a legitimate time
commitment between 5 p.m. and 8
p.m. on Friday night, there's
absolutely no reason why you
shouldn't be at the game cheering
on Stanford football.
The original price for a student
ticket was $4O. People complained.
Thanks to a group of donors who
subsidized the cost for student
attendance, the price was reduced
to $2O. People are still complaining.
The fan interest has become so piti
ful that the Stanford Athletics
Ticket Office has entirely aban
doned the Red Zone loyalty point
program, allowing all students to
purchase tickets even if they didn't
attend a single game this season.
How is $2O too much to watch
the No. 8 team in the nation play
for the conference title at home?
How is $2O too much to support
your team as it tries to earn a Rose
Bowl berth for the first time since
2000? I don't think some students
realize how privileged they are,
that they can go to all of the
Cardinal's regular season home
games for every sport at no cost. At
Cal, a student season pass for foot
ball alone costs more than $lOO.
You're too busy to go? If a
Stanford professor has the time to
go to every home game and cheer
from the sidelines, then it's certain
ly not too much for you to clear
three hours from your schedule on
one Friday night.
I understand that this year's
football season scheduling has been
far from optimal. Half of this year's
six home games were played before
school was even in session. Three
huge games USC, Oregon and
UCLA all took place either
before school started or during
break. And yes, the Pac-12
Network and Fox did screw us over
with noon kickoff times on multiple
occasions. That's not lost on me.
But none of that should matter
come Friday night. The stakes
couldn't be any higher. The
Cardinal had to upset two No. 2
teams in the country to get to this
point and it's very possible that
Stanford might not have another
chance to play in the Pac-12
Championship in your time on the
Farm.

During Sunday's press confer
ence, both running back Stepfan
Taylor and outside linebacker
Chase Thomas, both team captains,
expressed their hopes to see
Stanford fans come out and show
some support. Thomas also tweet
ed on Tuesday, "How is this game
still not sold out... c'mon
#NerdNation support your team
and get to the game, we need you."
Simply put, it's an embarrass
ment for fans that players have to
worry whether there will be
enough of a crowd at the game to
give them a respectable home-field
advantage. The support should be
there for the players without them
having to ask repeatedly.
Heavy rain and wind is in the
forecast for Friday night, but that's
no reason to bail. What, you've
never been in the rain before? Cal
loves to mockingly call
Stanford fans fair-weather
followers. Based on the
crowd attendance this sea
son, I'm starting to think
that it's not just a stereo
type, that it's actually true. I
challenge you to prove oth
erwise.

It doesn't matter if you
don't know anything about
football or hate the sport
with a passion.
It's not just about foot
ball.

It's about supporting
your school. It's about show
ing a little bit of school pride.
It's about being part of, and
more importantly, contribut
ing to something that's big
ger than yourself. If you
can't do something as simple
as that, then honestly I don't

know how you can consider
yourself to be part of the
Stanford community.
The Pac-12
Championship Game is on
Friday and your school is
hosting it. So go.

George Chen will not. be
happy if he doesn't see you
there on Friday. Dare to

point and it's very possible that
Stanford might not have another
chance to play in the Pac-12
Championship in your time on the
Farm.

During Sunday's press confer
ence, both running back Stepfan
Taylor and outside linebacker
Chase Thomas, both team captains,
expressed their hopes to see
Stanford fans come out and show
some support. Thomas also tweet
ed on Tuesday, "How is this game
still not sold out... c'mon
#NerdNation support your team
and get to the game, we need you."
Simply put, it's an embarrass
ment for fans that players have to
worry whether there will be
enough of a crowd at the game to
give them a respectable home-field
advantage. The support should be
there for the players without them
having to ask repeatedly.
Heavy rain and wind is in the
forecast for Friday night, but that's
no reason to bail. What, you've
never been in the rain before? Cal
loves to mockingly call
Stanford fans fair-weather
followers. Based on the
crowd attendance this sea
son, I'm starting to think
that it's not just a stereo
type, that it's actually true. I
challenge you to prove oth
erwise.

It doesn't matter if you
don't know anything about
football or hate the sport
with a passion.
It's not just about foot
ball.

It's about supporting
your school. It's about show
ing a little bit of school pride.
It's about being part of, and
more importantly, contribut
ing to something that's big
ger than yourself. If you
can't do something as simple
as that, then honestly I don't

know how you can consider
yourself to be part of the
Stanford community.
The Pac-12
Championship Game is on
Friday and your school is
hosting it. So go.

George Chen will not. be
happy if he doesn't see you
there on Friday. Dare to
email him with your excuses

At an institution that
boasts an unparalleled
combination of out
standing academics
and top-notch athlet
ics, it's hard to imagine how fan atten
dance at sporting events can be so
awful. But that's the reality at
Stanford. Don't toy to deny it it's
god-awful.
I've never written a column about
poor crowd attendance at Stanford
athletic events, despite the fact that
it's baffled me for the past year. One,
because I didn't really think wilting a
column could make a difference. And
two, it's not always fun criticizing a
community that you're a part of.
But when the tickets for Friday's
Pac-12 Championship Game, less
than 72 hours away, still aren't sold
out yet, I feel obligated to address
this issue, even if it is a vain attempt.
To be sure, I'm not the only writer
trying to tackle this problem. My fel
low desk editor Tom Taylor just yes
terday narrated an inspiring tale of
how he transformed his apathy
towards Stanford football into a loyal
following that few fans can match. My
managing editor Miles Bennett-
Smith also aptly expressed his disap
pointment with the poor crowd atten
dance this season. Both of them
voiced their encouragements for
greater fan support more eloquently
than I ever could.
But I'm not here to give you the
reasons for why you should go to the
game. What I'm telling you instead is
that unless you have a legitimate time
commitment between 5 p.m. and 8
p.m. on Friday night, there's
absolutely no reason why you
shouldn't be at the game cheering
on Stanford football.
The original price for a student
ticket was $4O. People complained.
Thanks to a group of donors who
subsidized the cost for student
attendance, the price was reduced
to $2O. People are still complaining.
The fan interest has become so piti
ful that the Stanford Athletics
Ticket Office has entirely aban
doned the Red Zone loyalty point
program, allowing all students to
purchase tickets even if they didn't
attend a single game this season.
How is $2O too much to watch
the No. 8 team in the nation play
for the conference title at home?
How is $2O too much to support
your team as it tries to earn a Rose
Bowl berth for the first time since
2000? I don't think some students
realize how privileged they are,
that they can go to all of the
Cardinal's regular season home
games for every sport at no cost. At
Cal, a student season pass for foot
ball alone costs more than $lOO.
You're too busy to go? If a
Stanford professor has the time to
go to every home game and cheer
from the sidelines, then it's certain
ly not too much for you to clear
three hours from your schedule on
one Friday night.
I understand that this year's
football season scheduling has been
far from optimal. Half of this year's
six home games were played before
school was even in session. Three
huge games USC, Oregon and
UCLA all took place either
before school started or during
break. And yes, the Pac-12
Network and Fox did screw us over
with noon kickoff times on multiple
occasions. That's not lost on me.
But none of that should matter
come Friday night. The stakes
couldn't be any higher. The
Cardinal had to upset two No. 2
teams in the country to get to this
point and it's very possible that
Stanford might not have another
chance to play in the Pac-12
Championship in your time on the
