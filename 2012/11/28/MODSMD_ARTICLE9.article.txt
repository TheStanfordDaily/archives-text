# PAC-12 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
## RISE AND RHYNE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
As Stanford prepares for a rematch
with UCLA, one key difference in
the starting lineup has gone mostly
unnoticed. Ben Rhyne, a redshirt
sophomore from Charlotte, N.C.,
will most likely start at punter on Friday night
for the first time in his Stanford career.
Though it's not the best of circumstances
with starting punter Daniel Zychlinsky likely
out with an arm injury suffered on a punt
against UCLA, Rhyne is excited for the oppor
tunity.
"It reminds you of high school days," said
Rhyne. "It's been a while since I've been out on
the field punting. I kicked off last year a little
bit. It was a similar feeling, but it's nice to be
back out there."
As Rhyne alluded to, he's not a complete
stranger to a high-pressure football atmos
phere as a Stanford player. When starting kick
er Jordan Williamson missed significant time
with a leg injury in 2011, Rhyne took over most
of the kickoff duty for the Card, including tak

ing all of the kickoffs in Stanford's triple-over
time victory at USC. Rhyne kicked off 18 times,
averaging just under 60 yards per kickoff in
mostly pooch-type kicks.
But now, as Stanford looks to win its first
ever Pac-12 championship and earn a Rose
Bowl berth, Rhyne will have to take over punt
ing and holding duties for Zychlinsky, one of his
closest mentors.

"[Zychlinsky] taught me my freshman year
how to hold," Rhyne said. "I came in as a kicker
and hadn't held before and I was focusing on
punting at the time. I'm doing a little kicking
now as well. But he taught me how to hold and
it's been a project we've worked on over the last
three years and I'm very comfortable with it"
Rhyne is the kind of person who is comfort
able in most situations, whether on the field, in
the locker room, in the dorm or in the classroom
Rhyne has a 3.95 GPA in biomechanical engi
neering. Chris Gaertner, a redshirt sophomore
defensive back who is roommates and close
friends with Rhyne, knows firsthand the atti
tude Ben brings.
"Ben's a great teammate," said Gaertner.
"He's always making people on the team laugh

and keeps the atmosphere in the locker room
really light."
Rhyne's replacement of the injured
Zychlinsky in the starting lineup most directly
affects fellow redshirt sophomore Williamson.
Having to change holders suddenly after two
years working together can be tough on a kick
er.
"It's a little bit different," said Williamson.
"You've always got to adjust because I've been
working with Daniel Zychlinsky for, shoot, two
years now and he's a phenomenal holder and
I've been so used to the timing with him. Now
you've got someone in there who's a little bit dif
ferent, cadence is a little bit different, and the
whole timing aspect is slightly different as well.
So, you've just got to get used to that. Ben's
been doing great. Ben's a good holder. I have no
worries with him back there and I know he'll
get the job done. He'll do a great job."
Though Rhyne has been practicing his hold
ing for three years now, he hasn't had much
practice time with Williamson, who said the duo
hasn't practiced together very often since train
ing camp back in August. With the short week,
practice time is at a premium, but Williamson
isn't worried.
"We're getting some work in this week and
we'll have it nailed down," he said.
Depth is rarely an issue at the punter posi
tion, as punters are not often injured during the
season. With Rhyne replacing Zychlinsky at the
top of the depth chart this week, it looks like
Williamson might be Rhyne's emergency back
up.
Unlike many college kickers, Williamson did
not punt consistently in high school he said

Backup punter Ben Ryhne (14) is likely to take
over the starting position against UCLA with
Daniel Zychlinski injured. Ryhne kicked his
first career punt against the Bruins last week.
