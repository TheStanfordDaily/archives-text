is one of Iran's most innovative
and influential artists, architects
and educators. He helped shape
a new kind of architectural and
aesthetic modernity in Iran, one
that combines traditional Persian
aesthetics with modernist themes
and designs. Some of his designs, like the mausoleums
for Omar Khayam, Ferdowsi and Avicenna, endure
as hallmarks of this new architectural style.
His creative use of bricks and stone,
concrete and steel, as well as his tasteful
combination of geometric designs, give his
buildings a unique and much admired quality.
For years, Seyhoun was the Dean of the
School of Fine Arts and Architecture at Tehran
University where he successfully revamped the
curriculum and introduced new programs in
musicology, urban planning and the dramatic arts.
Seyhoun served as the president of the
Iranian Architectural Organization as well.
During his tenure, he was instrumental in
bringing two World Architectural Congresses to
Iran, while also being a teacher and mentor to many
of modern Iran's foremost architects and artists.
Professor Seyhoun is also an artist of international
stature. His work, particularly his new style of
abstract drawings with pen and ink, have been
exhibited in some of the most important halls
around the world. It is in recognition of a life
dedicated to art, architecture and education that he is
this year's recipient of the Bita Prize for Persian Arts.
