Tracing the banjo from its West African roots
to the New Worjd, join Bill Evans, as he performs
musical examples from the 1700s to the present
day on a variety of vintage instruments, ranging
from an African ekonting to a mid 19th-century
minstrel banjo, a modern bluegrass banjo, and
even an electric banjo.
From an 18th-century African dance tune to
the music of the Civil War, and from early 20th
century ragtime to more recent folk and bluegrass
banjo styles, and to his own incredible original
music, Evans' performances illuminate as well
as entertain, exposing audiences to more than
200 years of American music.
