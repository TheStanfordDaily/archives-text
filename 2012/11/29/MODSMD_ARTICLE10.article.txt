# OP-ED
## Do Stanford students have to replicate the animosity of the Middle East on campus? 
### JUSTIN HEFTER '11 
There is a cease fire in Israel,
but not at Stanford University.
A few recent op-eds in the
Daily practically accusing the United
States and Israel of conspiracy to
commit genocide citing sources
like Cognitive Liberty, a website
that gives voice to those who accuse
the U.S. of perpetrating 9/11
have sparked a new cycle of "rhetor
ical violence" on campus. It is amaz
ing how cyclical Stanford is, and how
quickly people forget what things
were like just a few years ago.
Similar op-eds and divestment cam
paigns in 2006 led to an extremely
fragmented and poisoned campus
atmosphere. In my four years at
Stanford, from 2007 to 2011, count
less students and staff worked tire
lessly to get the campus community
to a place where we could disagree
respectfully and work out our differ
ences without resorting to rhetorical
or political warfare, and use our col
lective energy to find creative solu
tions to make the world a better
place. If there is a group of people
anywhere in the world that can
reject the tactics of the past, like
divestment, and find creative ways
to solve problems in the future, it is
the students of Stanford University.
We're counting on you; don't make
the same mistakes.
The following is an op-ed I
wrote in June 2011. I hope it
can serve as a reminder of how
things have been, and spark
some ideas as to how Stanford
students can move beyond the
broken paradigms of the past.
One Step Forward, Two Steps
Back
When I came to Stanford as a
freshman in the fall of 2007, I was
shocked to see the condition of the
interfaith community. Fragmented
and scared, students would whisper

about the events of the previous
year. Divestment, Muslims against
Jews, Jews against Jews. The anti-
Israel divestment campaign of the
previous year had rocked the
Stanford community. It drove peo
ple away from wanting to learn
about or discuss Israel, drove
Jewish students from wanting to
befriend Muslim students and even
drove Jews away from the Jewish
community as a whole.

I was able to witness firsthand
the devastating effects of the 2006-
07 divestment campaign, because I
was the only freshman to join the
Stanford Israel Alliance. I joined
because, after facing anti-Semitic
abuse during high school, I found
Israel was the one place where I
knew I could be safe as a Jew, and I
wanted a place like that to exist for
all people. That's why I wanted to
try to improve the condition
between Jews and Muslims on cam
pus. I wanted to make things friend
lier, so that people did not have to be
afraid to express themselves, so that
the discussion could be more posi
tive. When I discussed co-sponsor
ing a charity drive for children in
Israel and Gaza with the Muslim
Students Awareness Network my
freshman year, some of the
Jewish/pro-Israel students looked
at me like I was crazy.
Eventually we overcame the
emotional scars of divestment, and
the charity drive to send gift baskets
to children in Israel and Gaza went
forward. It was a major success
because it was a positive way to deal
with the conflict. Since then, the
number of Jewish and Muslim inter
faith events has increased. Political
disagreements surrounding Israel
have been handled in a more posi
tive light. We repeated the charity
drive my sophomore year and
launched an even more successful
microfinance campaign the year

after. The past few years have been
a huge step forward, but I fear that
we are on the verge of taking two
steps back.
This spring saw the initiation of a
renewed divestment campaign.
Divestment calls to the University
not to do business with companies
that do business in Israel. While the
campaign purports to be about a few
specific companies, in reality it is a
campaign to delegitimize Israel,
using literature from international
movements that try to convince
countries to boycott and sanction
the Jewish state. This campaign is
divisive because it places the blame
for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a
conflict that takes into account cen
turies of nuance, squarely on
Israel's shoulders. That's not fair;
both sides share responsibility.
Divestment aims to injure Israel
economically, without actually direct
ly helping the Palestinians. This
should be upsetting to anyone who
cares about Israel and also anyone
who cares about the Palestinians. We
should work toward change that
helps both sides of the conflict, not
simply injure one side or the other.
Regardless of our politics, the
campaign of divisiveness that is in
the process of being put forth can
only have destructive outcomes. We
do not need to replicate the animos
ity in the Middle East in order to
make productive change. I have
faith that if anywhere in the world
there is a place where Muslims,
Jews and people of all religious and
political dispositions can come
together to find constructive solu
tions to the Middle East conflict, it is
Stanford University. I implore you,
Stanford University: do not let this
campus go back to the way things
were. We have changed, and we are
so much better than divestment.
