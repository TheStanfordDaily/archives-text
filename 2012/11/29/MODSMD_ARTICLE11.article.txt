### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Aaron Sekhri 
New Jersey's charter schools enjoy, on
average, "larger learning gains in both read
ing and mathematics" than their public coun
terparts, according to a new Stanford survey
published by the Center for Research on
Education Outcomes (CREDO).
The analysis was the "first-ever in-depth
examination of the results of charter schools
in New Jersey," and was conducted in part

nership with the New Jersey Department of
Education.
The report examined whether charter stu
dents outperformed their peers in public
school using figures of year-on-year grade
increases by students in both types of schools
over a total period of five years. This gave the
researchers four periods of academic growth
to establish their findings.
The results were positive for charter
schools, with urban charter schools in the best
cases providing almost an entire extra school
year of learning gains compared to their peers
in public schools.
"At the school level, 30 percent of the char
ter schools have significantly more positive
learning gains than their [public] counter
parts in reading, while 11 percent of charter
schools have significantly lower learning
gains," the report stated.
"In math, 40 percent of the charter
schools studied outperform their [public
school] peers and 13 percent perform worse,"
it also said.
New Jersey Education Commissioner
Chris Cerf praised the report's findings.
"[The survey] reflects the work we have
undertaken to increase our accountability
standards, strengthen the rigor of our author
izing process, and, when necessary, close
schools that are underperforming."
