## Rose Bowl run is eerily familiar 
### Joseph Beyda 
Here's a little recipe for
success for future
Stanford coaches: If
you want to make it to
the Rose Bowl, throw
conventional wisdom out the win
dow.
Stanford fans have been pining
for a Rose Bowl since 1999, and
we're now just one win away from
finally booking those tickets to
Pasadena. At the same time,
Cardinal receivers have been drop
ping passes since day one and Kevin
Hogan's 25-for-36 performance
against Oregon was the first time all
year a Stanford starter completed
more than 65 percent of his throws
in a game. The Cardinal hasn't bro
ken 425 yards on a single Saturday
since Big Game on Oct. 20, five
games back; just a season ago
Andrew Luck's squad did so 11
times and couldn't win its division.
The Cardinal's total offense has
dropped an astounding 108 yards
per game since 2011, the second
highest single-offseason plummet by
a Stanford team since 1950. But
know this: The third-highest such
decrease a 98-yard drop before
the 1970 season led the Cardinal
straight to the Rose Bowl and added
two more wins to Stanford's record.

That 1970 squad's numbers fly in
the face of everything we know
about football. How can a team with
such offensive struggles be quarter
backed by the only Heisman winner
in school history? How did it manage
to improve from seven wins in 1969
to nine wins in 1970 while its average
margin over opponents decreased
from 19.7 to 11.4 points per game?
(This last offseason has also seen
that advantage cut in half, from 21.2
to 11.7.)

It takes a boatload of intangibles
to overcome those kinds of statistical
dilemmas. And what team in college
football can rival the Cardinal's
intangibles right now?

Its dominant front seven has an
emotional leader in Shayne Skov,
who is determined to return to the
explosive form he exhibited last year
before losing his season to injury.
Its shut-down secondary (I can't
believe I just typed those words) has
a chip on its shoulder after years of
poor pass defense on the Farm.
Its kicker, Jordan Williamson,
just overcame a year of scrutiny and
pent-up nerves to clinch the most
important win by a Cardinal team
this century.
Its offensive workhorse, Stepfan
Taylor, is about to become the most
storied back in school history but
keeps sharing time with Anthony
Wilkerson, Ricky Seale, Remound
Wright and Kelsey Young, who have
averaged a combined 4.9 yards-per
carry (exactly Taylor's production).
Its coach is a proud alum who
wants to get the team back to the
Rose Bowl more than anyone.
Even its displaced quarterback,
Josh Nunes, has gracefully men
tored and supported his replace
ment, Kevin Hogan, after a midsea
son switch that reflected bluntly on
their relative abilities. (Just watch
their embrace after the Oregon win.)
Maybe I'm biased because I
know Stanford better than any other
team, but having all that stuff, all on
one team, is uncommon.

The Cardinal will have a pair of
defeats if it makes it to Pasadena,
and strangely enough that's actually
better than average for a Cardinal
conference champion. You have to
go all the way back to 1951 to find
a two-loss Stanford team in the
Rose Bowl; in 1970, 1971 and 1999
the Cardinal was 8-3 when it won
the conference.

By comparison, during USC's
six-year stint as the Pac-10's Rose
Bowl or National Championship
representative it benefited from
the services of three future NFL
quarterbacks and averaged just
one loss per regular season. Yet
that type of overpowering talent is
not what got Stanford to the Rose
Bowl in the past, and it won't be
this year.

Case in point: the Cardinal has
n't exactly fallen in line during a
2012 college football season chock
full of electric offensive perform
ances. Pac-12 fans saw Arizona's
Ka'Deem Carey have the best
rushing game in conference histo
ry, and single-game conference
receiving records were set in three
separate leagues (Pac-12, Big 12
and SEC). Quarterbacks in those
three conferences broke single
game records: Pac-12 completions
and attempts, by Arizona's Matt
Scott; Big 12 passing touchdowns
and total offense, by West
Virginia's Geno Smith; and
SEC total offense, by Texas
A&M's Johnny Manziel.
Taylor's best rushing
game (188 yards) was half

as good as Carey's (366),
Hogan's best passing game
(254 yards) was half as good
as Manziel's (557) and only
two Cardinal wide receivers
have caught more passes
all season than Marquise
Lee did in one game (16).
But look who's ranked
highest.
Look who's just a game

away from the Rose Bowl.

Joseph Beyda thinks he
might he able to average j.9
yards per carry if David
Shaw told him to put the
team on his back, doe. Email
