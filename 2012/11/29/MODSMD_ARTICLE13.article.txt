# CARDIAC CARDINAL
## Stanford rolls Redhaws late 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
After coming up short in three
out of four games over
Thanksgiving break, the men's bas
ketball team desperately needed a
win against the Seattle University
Redhawks on Wednesday night.
That's exactly what they got, sur
viving a sloppy first half and coming
on strong late to win going away, 68-
57.

Stanford (5-3, 0-0 Pac-12) has
not necessarily played poorly to
open the year, but a few costly mis
takes had turned a potential 6-1 or
7-0 record into a subpar 4-3 mark at
the start of the night. With high
expectations for both Pac-12 and
national play, the Cardinal needed
to start playing the basketball that
many ESPN analysts were predict
ing during the preseason. The
squad took a step in the right direc
tion against Seattle (2-2, 0-0 WAC)
in front of a Maples Pavilion crowd
of 4,381.
Early on it appeared that the
Card didn't have an answer for the
Redhawks' leading scorer, fresh
man transfer Clarence Trent, who
scored three easy baskets to give
his team a 16-10 advantage with
13:11 remaining in the first half.
Stanford would battle back, scoring
a quick six unanswered points to tie
the game.
Still, the Card looked sluggish,
failing to keep up with Seattle's
fast-paced scoring attack. Trent
struck again with four minutes left
before the break, knocking down a
deep three-pointer to put Seattle up
26-20.

Stanford managed to cut the
lead to three before halftime, as
sophomore guard Chasson Randle
picked up a steal and found senior
Andy Brown on the fast break for
an easy layup. Randle then scored a
bucket of his own, driving to the
basket and finishing in the paint.
The Cardinal ended an under
whelming first half down 30-27, in
what appeared to be another disap
pointing performance.

The shooting woes that plagued
Stanford in the Battle 4 Atlantis
tournament last week were still
apparent. The Card went 9-of-31
shooting in the first half.
However, this game would prove
to be a tale of two halves, as
Stanford looked like an entirely dif
ferent team in the second half.
Seattle managed to keep it interest
ing for the first 10 minutes, trading
buckets with a Stanford team that
couldn't quite find its rhythm. With
Stanford down four points, fresh
man Christian Sanders drove to the
basket and scored, drawing a foul in
the process. After knocking down
the free throw, he put the team
within one point in what would
prove to be the turning point of the
game.

Stanford finally started playing
well, working the paint to find easy
shots and earn trips to the free
throw line. After a Louis Green
jumper tied the game at 50-50 with
4:41 remaining, Stanford ended the
game on an 18-7 run to pick up a
much-needed 68-57 victory.
Brown led the way for the
Cardinal, scoring a career-high 17
points on the same day head coach
Johnny Dawkins announced that
junior Anthony Brown would miss
the rest of the season with a hip
injury. The elder Brown who has
torn his ACL three times since his
senior year of high school cer
tainly chose a good night to step up,
as Stanford needed his strong
effort.

"I'm excited about Andy Brown
and what he's doing," Dawkins said
after the game. "I'm excited about
Robbie Lemons and what he's giv
ing us. Rosco [Allen] today played
really well for us. It's great to see
guys, when someone goes down
their opportunity is there and you
prepare for your opportunity. So far
when guys have gone down for us
with Aaron and Anthony, we've had
guys step up and give us some
thing."
Randle, the Card's leading scor
er, was not far behind Brown with
15 points of his own. Junior Dwight
Powell turned in another strong
performance in what has been a
great start to the season for him,
grabbing a career-high 13
rebounds. He also pitched in with
eight points, just a bucket shy of

another double-double.
And the crowd was very
enthused by the monstrous defen
sive effort of junior Josh Huestis,
who finished with a career-high 10
blocks, two short of the program
record of 12 set by Brook Lopez in
2007.
"That's what we try to make our
living off defense," Huestis said.
"We want to be one of the best
defensive teams in the country.
Shots aren't going to fall every

night but defense can be there, so
tonight we held them to 57 points,
which is great. Guys got after it. We
really dug in defensively and that
helped us grind out this win."
Stanford will look to carry its
momentum into its next game, as
the University of Denver travels to
the Farm this Sunday for another
non-conference contest.

their opportunity is there and you
prepare for your opportunity. So far
when guys have gone down for us
with Aaron and Anthony, we've had
guys step up and give us some
thing."
Randle, the Card's leading scor
er, was not far behind Brown with
15 points of his own. Junior Dwight
Powell turned in another strong
performance in what has been a
great start to the season for him,
grabbing a career-high 13
rebounds. He also pitched in with
eight points, just a bucket shy of

another double-double.
And the crowd was very
enthused by the monstrous defen
sive effort of junior Josh Huestis,
who finished with a career-high 10
blocks, two short of the program
record of 12 set by Brook Lopez in
2007.
"That's what we try to make our
living off defense," Huestis said.
"We want to be one of the best
defensive teams in the country.
Shots aren't going to fall every

night but defense can be there, so
tonight we held them to 57 points,
which is great. Guys got after it. We
really dug in defensively and that
helped us grind out this win."
Stanford will look to carry its
momentum into its next game, as
the University of Denver travels to
the Farm this Sunday for another
non-conference contest.

STANFORD 68
11/28, Maples Pavilion


LEIGH KINNEY/The Stanford Daily
Senior guard Gabe Harris (23) goes up for a dunk in Wednesday
night's win over Seattle University. The Cardinal struggled to find its
shooting rhythm, but went on an 18-7 run to close out the Redhawks.
After coming up short in three
out of four games over
Thanksgiving break, the men's bas
ketball team desperately needed a
win against the Seattle University
Redhawks on Wednesday night.
That's exactly what they got, sur
viving a sloppy first half and coming
on strong late to win going away, 68-
57.

Stanford (5-3, 0-0 Pac-12) has
not necessarily played poorly to
open the year, but a few costly mis
takes had turned a potential 6-1 or
7-0 record into a subpar 4-3 mark at
the start of the night. With high
expectations for both Pac-12 and
national play, the Cardinal needed
to start playing the basketball that
many ESPN analysts were predict
ing during the preseason. The
squad took a step in the right direc
tion against Seattle (2-2, 0-0 WAC)
in front of a Maples Pavilion crowd
of 4,381.
Early on it appeared that the
Card didn't have an answer for the
Redhawks' leading scorer, fresh
man transfer Clarence Trent, who
scored three easy baskets to give
his team a 16-10 advantage with
13:11 remaining in the first half.
Stanford would battle back, scoring
a quick six unanswered points to tie
the game.
Still, the Card looked sluggish,
failing to keep up with Seattle's
fast-paced scoring attack. Trent
struck again with four minutes left
before the break, knocking down a
deep three-pointer to put Seattle up
26-20.

Stanford managed to cut the
lead to three before halftime, as
sophomore guard Chasson Randle
picked up a steal and found senior
Andy Brown on the fast break for
an easy layup. Randle then scored a
bucket of his own, driving to the
basket and finishing in the paint.
The Cardinal ended an under
whelming first half down 30-27, in
what appeared to be another disap
pointing performance.

The shooting woes that plagued
Stanford in the Battle 4 Atlantis
tournament last week were still
apparent. The Card went 9-of-31
shooting in the first half.
However, this game would prove
to be a tale of two halves, as
Stanford looked like an entirely dif
ferent team in the second half.
Seattle managed to keep it interest
ing for the first 10 minutes, trading
buckets with a Stanford team that
couldn't quite find its rhythm. With
Stanford down four points, fresh
man Christian Sanders drove to the
basket and scored, drawing a foul in
the process. After knocking down
the free throw, he put the team
within one point in what would
prove to be the turning point of the
game.

Stanford finally started playing
well, working the paint to find easy
shots and earn trips to the free
throw line. After a Louis Green
jumper tied the game at 50-50 with
4:41 remaining, Stanford ended the
game on an 18-7 run to pick up a
much-needed 68-57 victory.
Brown led the way for the
Cardinal, scoring a career-high 17
points on the same day head coach
Johnny Dawkins announced that
junior Anthony Brown would miss
the rest of the season with a hip
injury. The elder Brown who has
torn his ACL three times since his
senior year of high school cer
tainly chose a good night to step up,
as Stanford needed his strong
effort.

"I'm excited about Andy Brown
and what he's doing," Dawkins said
after the game. "I'm excited about
Robbie Lemons and what he's giv
ing us. Rosco [Allen] today played
really well for us. It's great to see
guys, when someone goes down
their opportunity is there and you
prepare for your opportunity. So far
when guys have gone down for us
with Aaron and Anthony, we've had
guys step up and give us some
thing."
Randle, the Card's leading scor
er, was not far behind Brown with
