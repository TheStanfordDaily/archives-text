# Buckeyes beckon
## Stanford off to Ohio State Invite 
### RYAN HOAGLUND CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The women's swimming and
diving team and the men's diving
team will get a chance to compete
against some formidable competi
tion this weekend when they head
to Columbus for the Ohio State
Invitational.

The three-day meet is set to
begin on Friday and will be the
women's team's first invitational
meet. For the men, it will be the sec
ond invitational meet of the season.
So far this season the No. 6
Stanford women have performed
well, winning their opening two
dual meets against San Jose State
and Wisconsin before falling by
just three points to No. 5 Texas in
a matchup that saw Stanford lose
a 25-point lead in the final events.
The meet was decided by the last

event of the day, the 400 freestyle
relay, when Texas was able to
claim first and third, just enough
to allow them to squeeze by
Stanford in the point totals.
Although certainly disappointed
by that result, this weekend's
competition provides the Cardinal
a great opportunity for redemp
tion.

A host of top teams from
around the country will be on
hand, including No. 8 Minnesota
and No. 16 Ohio State.
The Cardinal women will be
led by sophomore freestyler
Maddy Schaefer; senior freestyler
Andi Murez and IM specialist
Maya Dißado, who will be com
peting this December in the
FINA Short Course World
Championships as a member of
Team USA.

On the diving side, both teams
will look to improve on their results
at the Arizona Diving Invitational.
For the men, London Olympic
bronze-medalist and current
sophomore Kristian Ipsen was

second in the one- and three
meter finals in Arizona and will be
fighting for a win in those events
in Columbus. Sophomore Connor
Kuremsky will also hope to build
off a strong performance at
Arizona, where he finished fourth
in the three-meter competition
and seventh in the one-meter.

The women's diving team also
had a successful meet at Arizona,
with junior Stephanie Phipps win
ning the one-meter and freshman
Lilly Himichs picking up second
on the platform. Additionally,
sophomore Sloane Brazina took
sixth in the one-meter competi
tion and freshman Kelly Markle
finished ninth in the three-meter
preliminaries.
After the Ohio State Invite,
swimming and diving will take a
break from competition until Jan.
5, when the men and women will
both face the University of the
Pacific at home.
