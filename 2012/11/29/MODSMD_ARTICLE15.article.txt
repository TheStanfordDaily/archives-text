# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Stanford fired up for NCAAs 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
"We're fired up, we're confident, and
we're ready to go to war with teams."
Senior setter Karissa Cook's quote per
fectly sums up the attitude of the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team,
whose bid for its seventh NCAA title
begins on Friday against Jackson State.
The week was a big one for the team,
as coach John Dunning earned his fourth
Pac-12 Coach of the Year honor, while
four Cardinal players were named to the
14-player All-Pac-12 team: junior middle
blocker Carly Wopat and three fresh
men, middle blocker Inky Ajanaku and
outside hitters Jordan Burgess and
Brittany Howard. Junior opposite
Rachel Williams was also selected as an
honorable mention pick to the All-Pac-12
team, while Ajanaku, Burgess, Howard
and setter Madi Bugg were named to the
All-Freshman team.

The numerous accolades awarded to
the team were a perfect way to cap off an
impressive regular season, but the
Cardinal has its eyes set on a loftier
prize: a national title.

The Cardinal (27-3) will open its 2012
title quest against the Jackson State
Lady Tigers (24-11). Jackson State won
the Southwestern Athletic Conference
(SWAC) for the second straight year
after going undefeated in conference
play, and are riding a 22-match winning
streak.

Jackson State features a dynamic
offensive attack led by senior outside hit
ter Christine Edwards, who is in the top
50 in the nation with 4.12 kills per set.
The senior dominated in the SWAC tour
nament, posting 28 kills in the final to
secure Jackson State's spot in the NCAA
Tournament. She was named the SWAC
Tournament MVR and will be a force to
be reckoned with for the Cardinal.

Jackson State is especially powerful
off the serve, leading the nation with 2.15
aces per set. Edwards also
leads the nation in that cate
gory, averaging almost an ace
each set. She recorded 118
aces during the season, over
40 more than her closest
competitor.
The Lady Tigers are also
led on offense by junior out
side hitter Paige Williams,
who was second on the team
with 2.53 kills per game and
was named to the All-SWAC
Tournament Team. Freshman
middle blocker Mikayla Rolle
also had an impressive sea
son, averaging over a block a
set and posting 10 kills and
seven blocks in her last
match.

If the Cardinal gets past
Jackson State, it will play the
winner of No. 17 Western
Kentucky Lady Toppers (32-
3) and Loyola Marymount
Lions (18-12), who face off at
5:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The Lady Toppers won
the Sun Belt Conference in
dominant fashion, going unde
feated throughout the season
and entering the tournament
on a 24-game winning streak.
They have not lost a match
since Sept. 8, when they
played against Ohio State.
Western Kentucky fea
tures a balanced offensive
attack, in which four players
average over two kills a set.
The setter for the Lady Ibppers,
junior Melanie Stutsman, is No.

20 in the nation with 11.35
assists per set.

The Lions snuck into the
tournament with an at-large
bid despite finishing just
sixth in the WCC. They did
close their season on a high
note, however, winning five of
their last seven games.
The Lions are led on
offense by the dynamic
attacking duo of junior out
side hitter Kathleen Luft and
sophomore middle blocker
Litara Keil. Luft finished the
season averaging 4.14 kills per
set, as well as 1.86 digs per set,
while Keil contributed 3.13
kills, 1.32 digs and 1.04 blocks
per set.
The winner of Stanford-
Jackson State and Western
Kentucky-Loyola Marymount
will face off at 7 p.m. on
Saturday at Maples, with the
winner proceeding to the
regional semifinals in
Berkeley.
If Stanford makes it to
Berkeley, they are likely to
face either Cal, who will have
home court but has been
swept by Stanford twice this
year, or No. 15 lowa State.
Both could prove to be tough
matchups, but the largest
obstacle potentially standing
in the way of the Cardinal's
road to the Final Four is No.
7 UCLA, the second seed in
the region.
Stanford has beaten the
Bruins twice this season, but
both were close contests. If
the Cardinal reaches the
regional final and meets the
Bruins there, expect the
reigning national champs to

not go down without a fight.
The other tough out in the
Berkeley regional is Big East
champ No. 10 Louisville, who
would love to get to the Final
Four and play in front of its
home crowd.
The winner of the
Berkeley regional will face
the winner of the Austin
regional, which features two
very strong teams in No. 3
Texas and No. 6 USC. The
Trojans are one of just three
teams to hand Stanford a loss
this season.
On the other side of the
bracket, No. 1 Penn State,
which handed Stanford its
second loss of the season,
travels through the West
Lafayette regional on the
road to the Final Four, with
its highest ranked potential
opponent being No. 8
Minnesota. The Nittany
Lions are ranked first in the
nation and have won four out
of the last five national cham
pionships.
The Omaha regional
should be a dogfight, with
two very strong teams in No. 5
Oregon and No. 4 Nebraska,
as well as No. 13 Washington,
No. 12 BYU, and Hawaii, the
third team to beat Stanford
this season.
Stanford tips off at 8:00
p.m. on Friday, around the
time Stanford Football's Pac
-12 Championship Game
should end, as it attempts to
end its season with a national
championship.

Pac-12 Coach of the Year honor, while
four Cardinal players were named to the
14-player All-Pac-12 team: junior middle
blocker Carly Wopat and three fresh
men, middle blocker Inky Ajanaku and
outside hitters Jordan Burgess and
Brittany Howard. Junior opposite
Rachel Williams was also selected as an
honorable mention pick to the All-Pac-12
team, while Ajanaku, Burgess, Howard
and setter Madi Bugg were named to the
All-Freshman team.

The numerous accolades awarded to
the team were a perfect way to cap off an
impressive regular season, but the
Cardinal has its eyes set on a loftier
prize: a national title.

The Cardinal (27-3) will open its 2012
title quest against the Jackson State
Lady Tigers (24-11). Jackson State won
the Southwestern Athletic Conference
(SWAC) for the second straight year
after going undefeated in conference
play, and are riding a 22-match winning
streak.

Jackson State features a dynamic
offensive attack led by senior outside hit
ter Christine Edwards, who is in the top
50 in the nation with 4.12 kills per set.
The senior dominated in the SWAC tour
nament, posting 28 kills in the final to
secure Jackson State's spot in the NCAA
Tournament. She was named the SWAC
Tournament MVR and will be a force to
be reckoned with for the Cardinal.

Jackson State is especially powerful
off the serve, leading the nation with 2.15
aces per set. Edwards also
leads the nation in that cate
gory, averaging almost an ace
each set. She recorded 118
aces during the season, over
40 more than her closest
competitor.
The Lady Tigers are also
led on offense by junior out
side hitter Paige Williams,
who was second on the team
with 2.53 kills per game and
was named to the All-SWAC
Tournament Team. Freshman
middle blocker Mikayla Rolle
also had an impressive sea
son, averaging over a block a
set and posting 10 kills and
seven blocks in her last
match.

If the Cardinal gets past
Jackson State, it will play the
winner of No. 17 Western
Kentucky Lady Toppers (32-
3) and Loyola Marymount
Lions (18-12), who face off at
5:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The Lady Toppers won
the Sun Belt Conference in
dominant fashion, going unde
feated throughout the season
and entering the tournament
on a 24-game winning streak.
They have not lost a match
since Sept. 8, when they
played against Ohio State.
Western Kentucky fea
tures a balanced offensive
attack, in which four players
average over two kills a set.
The setter for the Lady Ibppers,
junior Melanie Stutsman, is No.

20 in the nation with 11.35
assists per set.

The Lions snuck into the
tournament with an at-large
bid despite finishing just
sixth in the WCC. They did
close their season on a high
note, however, winning five of
their last seven games.
The Lions are led on
offense by the dynamic
attacking duo of junior out
side hitter Kathleen Luft and
sophomore middle blocker
Litara Keil. Luft finished the
season averaging 4.14 kills per
set, as well as 1.86 digs per set,
while Keil contributed 3.13
kills, 1.32 digs and 1.04 blocks
per set.
The winner of Stanford-
Jackson State and Western
Kentucky-Loyola Marymount
will face off at 7 p.m. on
Saturday at Maples, with the
winner proceeding to the
regional semifinals in
Berkeley.
If Stanford makes it to
Berkeley, they are likely to
face either Cal, who will have
home court but has been
swept by Stanford twice this
year, or No. 15 lowa State.
Both could prove to be tough
matchups, but the largest
obstacle potentially standing
in the way of the Cardinal's
road to the Final Four is No.
7 UCLA, the second seed in
the region.
Stanford has beaten the
Bruins twice this season, but
both were close contests. If
the Cardinal reaches the
regional final and meets the
Bruins there, expect the
reigning national champs to

not go down without a fight.
The other tough out in the
Berkeley regional is Big East
champ No. 10 Louisville, who
would love to get to the Final
Four and play in front of its
home crowd.
The winner of the
Berkeley regional will face
the winner of the Austin
regional, which features two
very strong teams in No. 3
Texas and No. 6 USC. The
Trojans are one of just three
teams to hand Stanford a loss
this season.
On the other side of the
bracket, No. 1 Penn State,
which handed Stanford its
second loss of the season,
travels through the West
Lafayette regional on the
road to the Final Four, with
its highest ranked potential
opponent being No. 8
Minnesota. The Nittany
Lions are ranked first in the
nation and have won four out
of the last five national cham
pionships.
The Omaha regional
should be a dogfight, with
two very strong teams in No. 5
Oregon and No. 4 Nebraska,
as well as No. 13 Washington,
No. 12 BYU, and Hawaii, the
third team to beat Stanford
this season.
Stanford tips off at 8:00
p.m. on Friday, around the
time Stanford Football's Pac
-12 Championship Game
should end, as it attempts to
end its season with a national
championship.
