# SPORTS BRIEF
## Ertz and Yankey named AFCA All-Americans 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford can't focus on postseason awards
just yet with No. 17 UCLA and a potential
Rose Bowl berth looming at Friday's Pac-12
Championship game. But the Cardinal
received some more national recognition on
Wednesday when senior tight end Zach Ertz
and junior offensive tackle David Yankey
were both named to the American Football
Coaches Association Ail-American Team.
One of five All-America teams officially rec
ognized by the NCAA, the AFCA All-American
Team is chosen by polling the nation's coaches,
who have been appreciative of Stanford's talent
in recent years, selecting two players for the
team in each of the last two seasons.
This year, Ertz leads tight ends in the
Football Bowl Series with 818 receiving
yards and is tied for first with 63 receptions,
both school records. A John Mackey Award
finalist, the 6-foot-6 Ertz is likely to be one of
the first tight ends selected if he declares for
the 2013 NFL Draft. He caught game-win
ning touchdowns in victories over No. 2 USC
and No. 13 Oregon State earlier this season,
as well as the game-tying score in Stanford's
upset of No. 2 Oregon.
Yankey will join Ertz in the NFL, if not
in this year's draft class then certainly in
next year's as one of the top offensive line
man in the country. A starter at left tackle,
Yankey has shifted among four of the five

offensive line positions this season. He has
allowed just one sack, however, and is part
of the unit that has allowed the fewest sacks
in the Pac-12.

Junior starting left tackle David Yankey (54)
has allowed just one sack this year. A natural guard, Yankey has rotated among four
positions on the Cardinal offensive line.

Senior tight end Zach Ertz (86) has become a favorite target of quarterback Kevin Hogan.
Ertz set the Stanford single-season record for catches and receiving yards by a tight end.
