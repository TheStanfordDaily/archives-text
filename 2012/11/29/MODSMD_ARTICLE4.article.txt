## Stanford co-develops autonomous underwater robot software 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Stanford and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute (MBARI) engineers have created a new way
for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to take
photographs deep below the surface of the ocean.
New software developed by Sarah Houts, a doctor
al candidate in aerospace robotics, allows AUVs shaped
like large torpedoes to navigate ravines, canyons and
other difficult underwater routes autonomously. Before
the implementation of the new software, the AUV had
to be operated by a human researcher remotely steer
ing it from a ship.
Houts' biggest challenge was devising a system for
the AUV to be able to anticipate possible obstacles and
avoid them safely. Using data about the AUV's altitude,
speed and direction at any given moment allowed her
to bypass this problem.
Engineers from Stanford and MBARI tested the
software by sending an AUV over a underwater cliff in
Monterey Bay. Another test is scheduled for early next
month.
AUVs are used to take photographs the ocean floor
to monitor the state of sea beds, which often have a sig
nificant impact on the research of climate scientists and
marine biologists.
Houts' next challenge is to prepare an AUV that can
take iceberg samples, which is made additionally com-
plex by the fact that icebergs are in motion.
She sees the key to solving this problem the
ability to "merge real-time measurements
with a map for areas where one exists."
Stephen Rock, the director of Stanford's
Aerospace Robotics Laboratory, called the
work a "tremendous shift" in autonomous
capabilities in an interview with the Stanford
Report.
