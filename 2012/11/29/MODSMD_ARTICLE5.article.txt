## Advance in carbon solar tech New all-carbon solar cell cheaper; more flexible than silicon-based 
### HELIN GAO 
Stanford researchers have discovered
away to manufacture flexible, recyclable
and comparatively cheap solar cells.
Though the cells currently operate at a
much lower efficiency, the breakthrough
holds great potential for the future of solar
energy.
Chemical engineering professor
Zhenan Bao recently announced the dis
covery of the first all-carbon solar cell,
which demonstrates greater flexibility and
potential for cost-friendliness than tradi
tional silicon-based solar cells.
In 2005, the semiconductor and solar
panel industries began to compete for sili
con, resulting in the former being unable
to afford silicon at the demanded price.
This breakthrough may provide relief to
semiconductor companies.
The all-carbon solar cell consists of an
active layer of C6O (a form of carbon) and
carbon nanotubes sandwiched between
conductive and transparent n-type doped
cathode and graphene-based anode which
allows for the penetration of sunlight to
excite electrons.
Although previous research groups

from MIT have also made carbon-based
solar cells using carbon nanotubes, they
were only able to apply these nanotubes to
the active layer. According to Michael
Vosgueritchian, a second-year graduate
student and a co-author of the research
paper, this is the first solar cell entirely
made out of carbon.
"[MIT researchers] are still using
metal for electrodes. We replace them with
all carbon electrodes, and lots of chal
lenges had to be overcome before we suc
ceeded," Vosgueritchian said.
The project builds on several discover
ies by Bao's group over the past six years,
such as developing transparent and con
ductive graphene electrodes and develop
ing n-type dopants to make carbon cath
odes. The effort to combine all these parts
together to make an all-carbon solar cell
began about one and half years ago when
Stanford's Global Climate and Energy
Project (GCEP) funded the project.
According to Bao, a patent has been
filed through GCEP for the all-carbon
solar cell, which has two main advantages
over traditional solar cells. The first is the
material's flexibility.
"Carbon materials can be bent, and
some can even be stretched, so their
mechanical properties are more robust
and flexible for them to be put on flexible
substrates," Bao said.

Second, carbon solar cells can better
contribute to a low-cost sustainable energy
system. Conventional solar cells use silver
and indium tin oxide as electrodes, materi
als that are scarce and toxic.
"What's really exciting about an all
carbon solar cell is that carbon is plenti
ful," said Sally Benson, director of the
GCEE "The other thing that is really neat
about carbon is that it's a recyclable mate
rial. With carbon-based solar cells, you can
even combust it."
Carbon can also withstand high tem
peratures and pressure, meaning that it
can be used in more extreme conditions.
Despite the promising future applica
tions of all-carbon solar cells, one of the
main problems is that this prototype
achieves an efficiency of 0.1 percent, com
pared to 20 percent from silicon solar cells.
Additionally, light absorption in carbon
cells comes primarily from the near
infrared spectrum due to the narrow
diameter range of carbon nanotubes,
meaning that the whole spectrum of sun
light cannot be absorbed. Vosgueritchian
is currently working in Bao's research
group to experiment with different carbon
nanotubes to improve the efficiency of the
solar cell.
However, scientists are optimistic
about improving carbon solar
cells' efficiency level.
According to a recent MIT
study published in ACS
Nano, carbon solar cells
demonstrate an untapped
potential for improving the
efficiency level to above 1

percent.
"First of all we have to fix
the issue with our electrode,
and we can improve our effi
ciency up to 0.45 percent,"
Vosgueritchian said. "Then, if
we can use different types of
carbon nanotubes to improve
our absorbance, we can easily
improve our efficiency level
above 1 percent."
Despite some drawbacks,
the discovery opens up new
possibilities in the field of

solar cell research.
"We need to dramatically
improve the materials and
improve the process for mak
ing the devices, [and we
need] new ideas to engineer
the device to get the best per
formance of the carbon mate
rials," Bao said. "This is only
the beginning of a new
research direction."
