# OPINIONS
## OP-ED Goma has fallen 
### 
UA ur country is imploding
I lhere, Goma is now filled
V_>/with insanity, the govern
ment won't negotiate since they want
to do it directly with Rwanda who
denies any complicity in the affair
even though it's a lie. This wonderful
country with good people hasn't had
any respite since 1885." Thus read an
email I received from friends living
in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). It narrated the horrific
events of the past week as Goma, the
capital of North Kivu province in
eastern DRC, fell to M 23 rebel fight
ers who captured the city report
edly with little resistance from the
Congolese army or UN peacekeep
ers.

The sequence of events taking
place in Goma today is not unfamiliar
to those on the ground. The history
of armed conflict in the eastern DRC
is filled with examples of rebel
groups gaining notoriety for their
violations of human rights.
These actions gain such groups
international recognition and open
up channels for increased financial
and commercial operations. Rebels
are awarded a bargaining tool and
use it, forcing the government to
negotiate. In the past, the Congolese
government has provided combat
ants political concessions and inte
gration into the national army in
exchange for withdrawal and defec
tion from rebel groups. Because rein
tegration is usually superficial and
incomplete, conflict often breaks out
again when these newly "integrated"
officers break away from the army
and start a new rebel movement (as
was the case with the CNDP in 2004
and the M 23 rebels last spring).
Since April, there have been
many "warnings" that the situation
in North Kivu was unstable. By
September, when I visited Goma
with a team of researchers, shootings
and curfews were routine. People
commented that the incidents of
shooting were becoming too common
in a city of one million inhabitants,
despite an evident UN presence
(through the UN Stabilization
Mission, known as Monusco) as well
as that of thousands of aid and
humanitarian workers. In Goma, a
Congolese told me that "It is as if
they" the M 23 "are testing the
waters." Testing the waters seems to
have worked out well for the M 23
rebels, as they took over the city and
advanced toward the border with
Rwanda. But if everyone knew it
would happen, why did we let it hap
pen?

In general, the Congolese gov
ernment has proven itself incompe
tent in protecting the eastern DRC.
The population has consistently
relied on UN peacekeepers for sup
port. The government hoped that the
international community would
intervene in the conflict once a
recent UN expert report discovered
that Uganda and Rwanda were
involved, but armed support failed to

materialize.
On Dec. 3, the Program on
Human Rights at the Center on
Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law and the Student Anti-
Genocide Coalition will be honored to
host Steve Hege for a special semi
nar, in which he will present the most
recent findings included in the UN
expert report. According to the
report, General James Kabarebe,
the defense minister of Rwanda, is
directing M 23 rebels in the eastern
part of the DRC, and Rwanda and
Uganda have contributed troops to
support the rebels against govern
ment forces. The report further
asserts that Rwandan mineral
traders are helping to fund the insur
gency.
The Congolese government mis
calculated, and the overall approach
of non-intervention fell miserably
short once again. UN peacekeepers
based in Goma failed to intervene
and stop the advance of rebels.
Peacekeepers allege they did not
have a mandate to intervene in the
conflict. The official mandate at stake
is determined by the UN Security
Council the same Council that
just elected Rwanda to one of its two
year term seats. Rwanda and
Uganda vehemently deny the accu
sations of supporting the M 23 rebels.
And in Kigali, Rwandan media (more
specifically, the New Times and
the Kigali Sun ) has accused the
Congolese government of "brain
washing" its citizens into thinking
that Rwandans are to be blamed for
the ills of the eastern DRC.

The acts of violence perpetrated
by the M 23 are unacceptable.
Consequences range from killings to
the abduction of women and children
to forced military recruitment, caus
ing thousands of people to flee
many of whom are now living in sub
human conditions. It is also alarm
ing, and equally unacceptable, that
the international community once
again failed to identify warning
signs, proving itself incapable of
responding effectively to a situation
we have all have seen before.
The conflict in the eastern DRC
will never be solved until a DRC gov
ernment can defend its citizens and
perpetrators of human rights abuses
are held accountable for their
actions. Achieving that end is beyond
the current capacity of the UN or
any other foreign actors particu
larly if they are fighting on the other
side.
