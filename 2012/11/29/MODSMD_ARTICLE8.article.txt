# I WANT TO GO TO THERE
## We don't know how to disagree

Israel and Palestine. Abortion.

Among many of the people I love,
ranging from the radical right to
the radical left, there seems to be
little room for compromise on a
wide spectrum of issues.
How should such a vast differ
ence of opinion be navigated in life?
How are we navigating it on this
campus?
Unfortunately, I think we are
failing at doing so.
Perhaps each of us is too quick
to believe that we are the enlight
ened one. But if education can
destroy ignorance, there must be
some common ground where sensi
tive issues can be debated with
civility.
There are right answers and
wrong answers in the world, truths
and untruths; but the majority of
issues as we get older tend to accu
mulate in some gray area. My
appeal is not for categorizing the
"gray" issues as right or wrong, but
for more civility in arriving at some
hint of communal understanding,
where we can occupy the same
space without acting hatefully
towards each other or stupidly on
the Internet. Agreement isn't the
goal, but respect is.
So, what of this gray area? How
are we to compromise in order to

sider that someone with an oppos
ing opinion might be right. It
sounds simplistic, but then, so does
the immediate jump to find all the
ways they are wrong. Being at one
of the best universities in the coun
try, we have the unique opportunity
to be surrounded by some very
brilliant people. But oftentimes in
political debates, op-ed battles and
comment wars, students use that
opportunity to tear each other
down, and then stomp on the foun
dation of other people's beliefs.
An obvious example is the
recent debate over Israel and
Palestine. I admit I am not well
versed on the subject, but I am try
ing to learn about the history of the
conflict as it unfolds. I do know this:
I have rarely seen more vitriolic
and wholly irreconcilable comment
threads, in quantity and tone, than
those that exist under the recent
Gaza op-eds in the Daily and other
campus publications. The comment
section is a well-known place to
vent baseless frustrations, but it
spills back into the articles about
the conflict and daily interactions of
students. There exists violence on
both sides, and the history of the
conflict is mired in political, cultur
al, and highly emotional terms. As
in other issues, how can this be rec
onciled without some give on both

share this campus, the nation and
the world?
One option is to run, to cover
your ears and assure yourself that
you alone are right. You can easily
isolate yourself in a world of opin
ions with which you agree, and find
multiple sources to back you up. It
is a cyclical process of bias confir
mation, which can create a broader
climate of extremism and isolation.
Another option is to fervently
and loudly argue your point so that
you cannot hear others. Similar to
the path of pledge-signing, and
blocking the legislative process,
this is boring and useless. You have
ensured that even before you enter
a conversation, you will not care
what another person believes. It
lacks any spirit of curiosity, any
interest or trust in the ideas of
other people.
There is a third option: to con-

Consider that
someone with an
opposing opinion
might be right.
sides?
In a recent conversation,
my mom provided me with
the metaphor of the "consen
sus elevator." The point is to
reach some form of under
standing with people you
may usually try to avoid.
When you don't know peo
ple, it is easy to assume they
are hateful, but that is a

pretty negative act in and of
itself. We should want to
know what their larger con
cerns are. Is there some
level way up high where you
actually agree? You keep rid
ing the issue upward and
find that point. If you truly
want to understand some
body's point of vievy that almost
always works. Sometimes you
have to ride up to the 99th
floor, but you will usually find
a place where you agree.
The issue is whether you
can be patient enough, and
sure enough of why you

believe what you believe to
take the ride. Maybe you can
understand their view a bit,
and maybe not. But at least
you're arguing about the
crux of an issue rather than
accusing each other of lack
ing any morality.
Simply put, the goal is
respect.

Is this goal important or
impossible? Does defense of
larger truths require some
level of disrespect? Contact

When you don't know peo
ple, it is easy to assume they
are hateful, but that is a

pretty negative act in and of
itself. We should want to
know what their larger con
cerns are. Is there some
level way up high where you
actually agree? You keep rid
ing the issue upward and
find that point. If you truly
want to understand some
body's point of vievy that almost
always works. Sometimes you
have to ride up to the 99th
floor, but you will usually find
a place where you agree.
The issue is whether you
can be patient enough, and
sure enough of why you

believe what you believe to
take the ride. Maybe you can
understand their view a bit,
and maybe not. But at least
you're arguing about the
crux of an issue rather than
accusing each other of lack
ing any morality.
Simply put, the goal is
respect.

Among many of the people I love,
ranging from the radical right to
the radical left, there seems to be
little room for compromise on a
wide spectrum of issues.
How should such a vast differ
ence of opinion be navigated in life?
How are we navigating it on this
campus?
Unfortunately, I think we are
failing at doing so.
Perhaps each of us is too quick
to believe that we are the enlight
ened one. But if education can
destroy ignorance, there must be
some common ground where sensi
tive issues can be debated with
civility.
There are right answers and
wrong answers in the world, truths
and untruths; but the majority of
issues as we get older tend to accu
mulate in some gray area. My
appeal is not for categorizing the
"gray" issues as right or wrong, but
for more civility in arriving at some
hint of communal understanding,
where we can occupy the same
space without acting hatefully
towards each other or stupidly on
the Internet. Agreement isn't the
goal, but respect is.
So, what of this gray area? How
are we to compromise in order to

sider that someone with an oppos
ing opinion might be right. It
sounds simplistic, but then, so does
the immediate jump to find all the
ways they are wrong. Being at one
of the best universities in the coun
try, we have the unique opportunity
to be surrounded by some very
brilliant people. But oftentimes in
political debates, op-ed battles and
comment wars, students use that
opportunity to tear each other
down, and then stomp on the foun
dation of other people's beliefs.
An obvious example is the
recent debate over Israel and
Palestine. I admit I am not well
versed on the subject, but I am try
ing to learn about the history of the
conflict as it unfolds. I do know this:
I have rarely seen more vitriolic
and wholly irreconcilable comment
threads, in quantity and tone, than
those that exist under the recent
Gaza op-eds in the Daily and other
campus publications. The comment
section is a well-known place to
vent baseless frustrations, but it
spills back into the articles about
the conflict and daily interactions of
students. There exists violence on
both sides, and the history of the
conflict is mired in political, cultur
al, and highly emotional terms. As
in other issues, how can this be rec
onciled without some give on both

share this campus, the nation and
the world?
One option is to run, to cover
your ears and assure yourself that
you alone are right. You can easily
isolate yourself in a world of opin
ions with which you agree, and find
multiple sources to back you up. It
is a cyclical process of bias confir
mation, which can create a broader
climate of extremism and isolation.
Another option is to fervently
and loudly argue your point so that
you cannot hear others. Similar to
the path of pledge-signing, and
blocking the legislative process,
this is boring and useless. You have
ensured that even before you enter
a conversation, you will not care
what another person believes. It
lacks any spirit of curiosity, any
interest or trust in the ideas of
other people.
