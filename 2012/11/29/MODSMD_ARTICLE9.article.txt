# THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## When does human life start? 
### Adam Johnson 
The question above may be the
most important human rights
issue of our time. If we can
agree that human life starts at con
ception, then abortions and in-vitro
fertilization result in millions of
deliberate human deaths per year.
Perhaps we can turn to science to
guide us. Although many scientists
from physicians to geneticists to
astrophysicists may claim to have
an answer, we should be primarily
asking human embryologists. For
decades, going back to before Roe v.
Wade , virtually all human embryol
ogists have maintained that human
life starts at fertilization. To quote a
couple textbooks: "fertilization is a
critical landmark because, under
ordinary circumstances, a new,
genetically distinct human organism
is thereby formed" ( Human
Embryology and Teratology)
and "the time of fertilization repre
sents the starting point in the life
history, or ontogeny, of the individ
ual" ( Patients Foundations of
Embryology).
Let me attempt to summarize
the argument. The fertilized egg is a
new entity, different from the unfer
tilized egg in many ways, most
notably in its genetic profile. This
entity is a life form: It is a complex
cell that divides, consumes oxygen
from its environment, is subject to
evolution and more. And this life is
distinctly human, as it contains
genetic material that differentiates
it from other species.
Unfortunately, human embryolo
gists do not have much political or
financial clout when compared to in-

vitro fertilization providers (who dis
card unused embryos), stem-cell
researchers, and abortion providers.
These latter groups represent thou
sands of scientists and billions of dol
lars, and they all have incentives to
promote the idea human life as
something not starting at concep
tion.

This may mean defining the early
stages of embryonic development as
a "pre-embryo" or using metaphysi
cal quandaries to question the work
ing definition of life. Often these
views are grounded in some science;
it is scientific to note the observable
similarities between human and fish
embryos, for instance. These views,
though, have often been discredited;
returning to the fish/human compar
ison, subsequent research showed
that it was based on flawed depic
tions of embryos produced in 1874.
Many discredited theories, however,
continue to play a role in basic sci
ence education, thus remaining
entrenched in the broader public
consciousness.

Of course, all of this is not to say
that an embryo, though a human life,
has a right to life. The Bill of Rights
does not use the term "human life"
but rather "person." The common
interpretation of "person" over the
course of American history has
changed, always becoming more
inclusive. Why should it not include
the unborn as well?
The Unborn Victims of Violence
Act is a 2004 law passed in Congress
that considers one guilty of a sepa-
rate offense if one harms an
"unborn child" in the act of a
violent crime. Some say this
distinction is only made to fur
ther prosecute criminals. Yet
these criminals would not
need to be further punished
for then- crime unless we actu
ally thought that an embryo
or fetus had some rights; if it
were merely an unimportant
clump of cells, what was the
crime? Others argue that the
extra prosecution is needed
because the unborn child was
generally wanted by the
mother. But why should the
unborn gain rights only when
they are wanted?
Furthermore, many of the
rights we grant to the early

stages of human develop
ment, babies, for instance
are contingent on the fact
that they become adults. It is
considered child abuse to
shake a baby, but imagine
that no immediate harm were
done and deleterious effects
would only appeal 1 in the long
run. If we view a baby's life in
that moment only, there is
nothing wrong with shaking
it. Yet this judgment is obvi
ously absurd we know that
the baby will grow up, and it
will be harmed. Potential
matters. Would we let a preg
nant woman unknowingly
ingest a substance that would
cause future brain damage to
her fetus? Most of us would
not, as we correctly realize
that the fetus will one day
benefit greatly from a func
tional brain. In most cases,
the fetus will also one day
benefit greatly from the act

of living.
Just as saying that
embryos are human lives
does not mean you believe
they are persons, granting
embryos personhood does
not mean you have to oppose
a woman's right to choose.
The right to life is not
absolute. If it were, how
could we justify bloody wars?
How could we let someone
die for want of a kidney?
Other rights, then, are just as
important. So while perhaps
my argument might fall on
deaf ears in the pro-choice
crowd, it should not. Human
embryologists agree that
human life starts at concep
tion, and logical reasoning
makes a strong claim to grant
this human life certain rights.
