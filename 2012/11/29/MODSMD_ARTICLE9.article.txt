## When does human life start? 
### Adam Johnson 
The question above may be the
most important human rights
issue of our time. If we can
agree that human life starts at con
ception, then abortions and in-vitro
fertilization result in millions of
deliberate human deaths per year.
Perhaps we can turn to science to
guide us. Although many scientists
from physicians to geneticists to
astrophysicists may claim to have
an answer, we should be primarily
asking human embryologists. For
decades, going back to before Roe v.
Wade , virtually all human embryol
ogists have maintained that human
life starts at fertilization. To quote a
couple textbooks: "fertilization is a
critical landmark because, under
ordinary circumstances, a new,
genetically distinct human organism
is thereby formed" ( Human
Embryology and Teratology)
and "the time of fertilization repre
sents the starting point in the life
history, or ontogeny, of the individ
ual" ( Patients Foundations of
Embryology).
Let me attempt to summarize
the argument. The fertilized egg is a
new entity, different from the unfer
tilized egg in many ways, most
notably in its genetic profile. This
entity is a life form: It is a complex
cell that divides, consumes oxygen
from its environment, is subject to
evolution and more. And this life is
distinctly human, as it contains
genetic material that differentiates
it from other species.
Unfortunately, human embryolo
gists do not have much political or
financial clout when compared to in-

vitro fertilization providers (who dis
card unused embryos), stem-cell
researchers, and abortion providers.
These latter groups represent thou
sands of scientists and billions of dol
lars, and they all have incentives to
promote the idea human life as
something not starting at concep
tion.

This may mean defining the early
stages of embryonic development as
a "pre-embryo" or using metaphysi
cal quandaries to question the work
ing definition of life. Often these
views are grounded in some science;
it is scientific to note the observable
similarities between human and fish
embryos, for instance. These views,
though, have often been discredited;
returning to the fish/human compar
ison, subsequent research showed
that it was based on flawed depic
tions of embryos produced in 1874.
Many discredited theories, however,
continue to play a role in basic sci
ence education, thus remaining
entrenched in the broader public
consciousness.

Of course, all of this is not to say
that an embryo, though a human life,
has a right to life. The Bill of Rights
does not use the term "human life"
but rather "person." The common
interpretation of "person" over the
course of American history has
changed, always becoming more
inclusive. Why should it not include
the unborn as well?
