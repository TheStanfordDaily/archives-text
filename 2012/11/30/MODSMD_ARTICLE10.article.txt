## Econ uncertainty reaches new peak Research shows that economic uncertainty currently at highest since Great Depression 
### SHELLEY XU 
"From 2008 onwards, the world has really changed
economically," said Nick Bloom, professor of economics.
"Policy uncertainty probably wasn't a big deal before."
In fact, since 2008 economic policy uncertainty has
averaged about twice the level of the previous 23 years,
according to the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index cre
ated by Bloom, Scott Baker, a fifth-year doctoral student
in economics, and Steven Davis, professor of economics at
the University of Chicago.
"Policy uncertainty has to do with uncertainty that
consumers and businesses have about the actions that
policymakers take and what effects those actions or what
effects those pieces of legislation will have in the future,"
Baker said.
They found that policy uncertainty is at its highest lev
els in history, with the nearest parallel in U.S. history
being the years during the Great Depression.
Causes for this uncertainty are as numerous as they
are daunting.
"It's been a whole series of events," said Nick Bloom.
He listed everything from monetary and fiscal policy like
interest rate cuts, the stimulus, the debt ceiling and the
fiscal cliff, to the Affordable Care Act, the outcome of this
year's elections and the European sovereign crisis all
of which are causing economic angst.
Economic policy uncertainty can have serious macroeco
nomic effects, according to the researchers.
"The history of the recession is really from late 2007 to
mid 2009. Normally we expect to come down and come
back up, but now it's just gone down and continued. And
increasingly people have blamed this on policy uncertain-

ty," Bloom said.
The reason for this sustained eco
nomic stagnation is that investment
and, to an extent, consumption suffer
when there is uncertainty
"A massive number of people are
waiting," Bloom said. "The typical
investment dollar that is spent in the
U.S. is spent by large firms, [which]
are very forward looking.... They're
super sensitive to policy uncertainty."
Reducing economic policy uncer
tainty can be a challenge, particularly
in the current political climate.
"With polarized parties but bal
anced power, it means you're exposed
to big swings," Bloom said.
Both Bloom and Baker agree that
political compromise is necessary to
lower policy uncertainty.
"I think politicians being able to

come to a compromise here is impor
tant, but also not only in dealing with
this but also signaling that they can
potentially compromise more in the
future," Baker said.
For Bloom, the problem will be
more difficult to solve.
"I'm pessimistic and the reason
is, if you look at what's the ultimate
cause of policy uncertainty in the
U.S, it's over the budget. There's a
big budget deficit and we have to
close it," he said.
"Congress being at loggerheads
or being deadlocked, it doesn't just
bode poorly for the next few months,
but as we get closer and closer and
there's no deal being met closer to
the fiscal cliff, closer to a debt crisis,
things like that, people begin to
potentially lose faith in the ability of
politicians to compromise in the
future," Bloom said.
The researchers use three indi
cators to model the index: economic
forecaster disagreement, tax code
expirations and news articles about

economic uncertainty.
The indicators were chosen
specifically to capture different
parts of policy uncertainty, through
both objective and subjective meas
ures. Forecaster disagreements
reveal information about govern
ment spending and monetary policy
at the federal and state levels, tax
expirations capture the increase in
temporary legislation and the news
index is more general, Baker said.
"It's basically predicated on the
notion if there is more policy uncer
tainty present, then newspapers are
going to write about it more," he
said. "It reflects what's going on. It's
not a perfect measure, though, but I
think it's a pretty good one."
Bloom, Baker and Davis have
also applied this metric to Europe
and Canada. They are looking to
expand it to Latin America, China
and other Asian countries.

politicians to compromise in the
future," Bloom said.
The researchers use three indi
cators to model the index: economic
forecaster disagreement, tax code
expirations and news articles about

economic uncertainty.
The indicators were chosen
specifically to capture different
parts of policy uncertainty, through
both objective and subjective meas
ures. Forecaster disagreements
reveal information about govern
ment spending and monetary policy
at the federal and state levels, tax
expirations capture the increase in
temporary legislation and the news
index is more general, Baker said.
"It's basically predicated on the
notion if there is more policy uncer
tainty present, then newspapers are
going to write about it more," he
said. "It reflects what's going on. It's
not a perfect measure, though, but I
think it's a pretty good one."
Bloom, Baker and Davis have
also applied this metric to Europe
and Canada. They are looking to
expand it to Latin America, China
and other Asian countries.
