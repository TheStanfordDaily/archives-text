## Stanford algorithm improves thought-controlled cursor 
### ANN TYLER MOSES 
A silicon chip implanted into the
brain can measure signals and pass
them through an algorithm
designed by Stanford researchers
with more speed and accuracy than
ever before to control objects out
side the body.
For example, a brain-implanted
rhesus monkey can control a com
puter cursor with its thoughts. The
old algorithm system allowed a
monkey to move the cursor to con
tact a colored ball target 10 times in
21 seconds. With ReFIT, the new,
Stanford-developed mathematical
algorithm, the monkey's accuracy
more than doubled to 21 targets in
21 seconds.

M.S. 'll Ph.D. 'l5 developed the
new algorithm, which has drastical
ly increased the performance of a
system designed to translate the
brain's neural firings into cursor
movements.
The system's eventual goal is
the restoration of lost functions to
disabled patients through what is
known as neural prosthetics. The
team's findings were published in a
Nov. 18 article in the journal
Nature Neuroscience.
While work in the subject has
been ongoing for decades at other
universities and hospitals, the
Stanford team's algorithm is a
major breakthrough.
ReFIT was developed by Gilja
and enables the cursor to be moved
with more control and to stop at its
destination rather than jerking
erratically.
Like previous studies, Gilja's
approach uses a Kalman filter algo
rithm to interpret the data from the
miniscule array of probes implant
ed into the subject's brain. A model
derived straight from that data
produces a path that sees the cur
sor eventually reach its goal, but
not without detours along the way.
According to Gilja, the "noise"

in our brains is principally to blame
for these detours. During different
attempts at the same task, neurons
will react in different patterns as
determined by the direction and
intensity of thought. In a hundred
trials of directing the cursor, our
thoughts would send it along a hun
dred slightly different paths.
The new algorithm removes the
position-contingent variants, clean
ing up the Kalman filter's estimates
by making assumptions of the sub
ject's intention. Because the
researchers know the intended
direction of the cursor, they correct
each registered point to aim in that
direction.
This strategy, which Gilja
described as a "nuts and bolts engi
neering approach," was able to
markedly increase the system's
performance.
He emphasized that an interdis
ciplinary influence was crucial.
"It's a rare Stanford opportuni
ty to sit between engineering and
more basic science research," Gilja
said. "I got exposed to both."
Stanford has joined Brown
University and Massachusetts
General Hospital in an upcoming
clinical trial of the system, called
BrainGate2. The original Brain Gate
trial was published in 2006.
On a broader scientific level, the
experiment is a key step in discov
ering more about movement and its
neural basis.
"Neural prosthetics are a pow
erful tool to probe these neural
dynamics that control movement,
because they can act as a more
direct proxy to the state of the brain
than the arm," Nuyujukian said.
By working in the field of neural
prosthetics, the Stanford researchers
can simultaneously examine the neu
rological basis of movement while
pursuing then* practical goals of
restoring certain abilities to para
lyzed patients.
"All of this is part of this huge
enterprise in neuroscience that is
blossoming everywhere," Gilja
said.
