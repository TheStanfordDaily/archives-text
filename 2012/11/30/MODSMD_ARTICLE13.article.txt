## Paths to Rose Bowl for Card, UCLA 
### Sam Fisher 
Well here comes
the rematch. For
Stanford to get to
that elusive Rose
Bowl for the first
time in over a decade, the Cardinal
needs just one more win over the same
UCLA Bruins team it beat decisively
just six days ago.
The biggest key to tonight's Phc-12
finale will be the adjustments that each
team has been able, or has failed, to
make. Stanford's football team was bet
ter than UCLAs last Saturday in
Pasadena, and it wasn't even close.
Stanford was far ftxjm perfect, however,
and will still require changes for
tonight's game.
I can't guarantee a winner tonight,
but here are the changes each team will
look to make if it wants to represent the
Phc-12 at the Rose Bowl on New "fear's
Day

Stanford.
Hold onto the football
Stanford was extremely fortunate
to have avoided a turnover mess on
Saturday. The Cardinal put the ball
on the ground four different times,
but UCLA could only recover one
of the four fumbles. Remound
Wright, Anthony Wilkerson and Kevin
Hogan who also escaped a fumble
in overtime against Oregon need
to be much more careful, especially
with a rainstorm brewing.
The one fumble UCLA did recov
er was on the play that injured senior
punter Daniel Zychlinski. Freshman
long snapper Reed Miller has seen
his ups and downs since Stanford
threw him into the fray due to the
Cardinal's lack of a capable veteran,
but Reed's snap to Zychlinski on the
play was not good.
The long snaps by Miller will be
extremely important tonight for two
reasons. First, snapping and holding
will be much tougher due to the wet
and potentially muddy conditions
expected on the field. And, perhaps
more importantly, the holder and
punter receiving Miller's snaps will be
a new starter, junior Ben Rhyne.
Rhyne will be under a lot of pressure
in his first start as the punter and
holder, so the easier Miller can make
it on him, the better Stanford's
chances are to avoid devastating neg
ative plays.
Build a first-quarter lead
This isn't really an adjustment,
but it is one change that could lead to
an easy Stanford victory. UCLA is
going to come out motivated, but I
don't think eveiyone in the Bruins
locker room fully believes that UCLA
can beat Stanford.

In the first game, Stanford took
the opening kickoff and masterfully
waltzed down the field for an easy
touchdown, sucking the energy out of
the Rose Bowl. However, after imme
diately forcing UCLA into a third
and-4, Stanford let Brett Hundley
escape the pressure for a big 71-yard
pass to Shaq Evans. UCLA scored
three plays later, giving the Bruins
and their crowd new life (at least
until the third quarter).
But Stanford dominated physical
ly for much of the game. If the Card
can bring that same intensity early
and add some offensive execution, it
could jump out to a big lead early. If
Stanford does grab that lead, I think
many of UCLAs players will mental
ly begin to throw in the towel. With so
much on the line, Stanford can't let
this game go down to the wire, or else
one mistake be it a dropped pass, a
missed tackle or a blown call by a ref
eree could rob Stanford of a Rose
Bowl.
UCLA
Cut down on the penalties
Obviously, nothing involving
penalties is ever entirely in a team's
control. Many analysts argue that
there's holding on every single play;
it's just only called when a referee
decides to throw the flag. That's prob
ably a bit of an exaggeration, and
UCLA had better hope its 12-penalty
performance last Saturday was just a
fluke.
I don't know if UCLA is good
enough to beat Stanford. What I do
know is that UCLA will not beat
Stanford with 12 penalties for 135
yards. To limit the penalties, UCLAs
players will have to play much
smarter and fight harder to get in a
position where they won't need to
commit penalties. If not, the Bruins
may as well not even show up at
Stanford Stadium tonight, because
Stanford will be hoisting that Pac-12
championship trophy.
Don't hold onto the football in the
pocket
This is the one adjustment of the
game that falls entirely on one
man's shoulders, UCLA quar
terback Brett Hundley's.
Hundley is an athletic specimen
who can also throw the ball pret
ty accurately. However,
Hundley has one big flaw, and
that is his tendency to hold onto
the football for way too long.
When facing Stanford, that
might be the worst flaw a
quarterback could have.

Stanford leads the nation in
sacks per game and demon
strated why in a
#PartylnThe√üackfield at the
Rose Bowl last week. Stanford
sacked Hundley seven times,
and honestly it should've been
higher, were it not for a few
missed opportunities.
Hundley has two choices to
avoid a repeat performance:
He can roll out of the pocket or
he can throw the ball quickly.
For UCLA to win this game,
Hundley will probably have to
do both of those things well for
long stretches. Hundley looked
great while rolling to his right

his longest throw of the
game, a 71-yarder to Shaq
Evans, came when Hundley
escaped the pass rush and
rolled right but he didn't do
it nearly enough last week. If
he can't make more plays like
that, UCLA will have a tough
time pulling off the upset.

The longest pass of Sam
Fisher's career was a 71-inch
flea-flicker in paper football.
