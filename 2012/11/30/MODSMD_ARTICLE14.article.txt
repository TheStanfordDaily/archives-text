# ON THE ROAD AGAIN
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The No.l Cardinal women's bas
ketball team (6-0) starts its week
end of play on the road tonight after
returning from Hawaii with a huge
win over Baylor and with the pro
gram's first No. 1 ranking since
2005.

"We're starting a big week," said
head coach Tar a VanDerveer.
"[Sunday's game] will be in front of
a packed house at Gonzaga and
we're going to have to play very
well. We're using this week to really
make some big improvements in
our defense and offensive attack."

VanDerveer and captains
Chiney Ogwumike and Joslyn
Tinkle emphasize how important it
is not to get caught up in the rank
ings so early in the season.
VanDerveer sees it as "just an opin
ion it's not a fact" until the end of
the season.

"I think that the No. 1 ranking is
awesome because it shows the
respect our team has around the
country, but at the same time we
know that numbers don't matter in
November," Ogwumike said. "They
matter when it comes to March and
[the NCAA] tournament."
The Card is looking ahead to the
end of the season and advancing
past the Final Four but realizes that
it must take each game as it comes.
Tonight Stanford faces a sharp
shooting UC-Davis squad (2-2).
Sophomore Sydnee Fipps is
averaging 21.8 points per game for
the season and is shooting 55.1 per
cent. Her fellow guard, senior
Cortney French, was named Big
West Conference Player of the
Week after averaging 19.5 points
per game and shooting an impres
sive 54.2 percent in the Aggies' two
wins last week.

The more highly anticipated
game this weekend is Sunday's
matchup with West Coast
Conference powerhouse Gonzaga

(6-1) in front of a sold-out crowd.
The Zags have won the WCC every
season since 2005 and last year
advanced to the Sweet 16 in the
NCAA tournament.

The Bulldogs are led by return
ing starters senior Taelor Karr and
junior Haiden Palmer. Karr and
Palmer led the team last year in 3-
point shooting, assists and steals.
This season Palmer is averaging 12
points and three steals per game,
while Karr has 7.7 points per game
and leads the team in free throw
shooting at 85 percent.
Sophomore Keani Albanez, how
ever, has stepped up this year and
improved her scoring average from
two points per game last season to
10.1 this season and is shooting an
unprecedented 50 percent from
behind the 3-point line.
Along with its talented guards
also comes an imposing frontcourt
that is averaging 34.4 rebounds and
5.25 blocks per game.
"Gonzaga has great perimeter
shooters and I think we have really
good perimeter shooters too, so it'll
be a good battle," VanDerveer said.
"We have to play great defense, we
have to contest shots, be aggressive
defensively.
"Offensively we've got to score,"
she added. "We just have to take
advantage of our size, using our
size, our length, using our athleti
cism with people like Amber
[Orrange], like Jas [Camp] and Toni
[Kokenis], We're going to have to be
very aggressive and play with a lot
of confidence."

The matchup between Tinkle
and her sister Elle, a Gonzaga
freshman, should make for some
great sibling rivalry as they play
against each other for the first time.
"It's a really cool feeling because
here I am, a senior about to leave
and end my career here at Stanford,
while [ElleJ's just beginning hers,"
Tinkle said. "So I'm very happy and
excited for her, and she's playing
well."

Tinkle has been dominating the
court so far this season alongside
Ogwumike, espnW's National
Player of the Week. Tinkle is aver
aging 18.2 points and 5.2 rebounds
per game while shooting 64.4 per
cent. Ogwumike has posted four
double-double performances thus
far, averaging 19.8 points and 11.7

rebounds per game while shooting
64.9 percent from the floor.
The Cardinal plays at UC-Davis
tonight before travelling to
Gonzaga for Sunday's game at the
Kennel.
