# READY FOR A REPEAT
## 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
For most teams in the country, qualifying for
the NCAA semifinals would make for a successful
season. But for the defending national champions,
anything but another title would be a disappoint
ment.

"The goal is not just to get back [to the College
Cup], the goal is to win a national championship,"
said Paul Ratcliffe, women's soccer head coach.
"We're happy to be back there, but we're not sat
isfied."
The No. 1 Cardinal reached its fifth consecu
tive Final Four after a thrilling 2-1 victory over
No. 6 UCLA. Sophomore Lo'eau Laßonta scored
two goals in the second half as Stanford (21-1-1)
rallied to erase an early Bruin lead for the second
time this season.
The next challenge for Stanford is to take on
No. 13 North Carolina on Friday night in San
Diego.
UNC (13-5-3) boasts the most successful pro
gram in the history of collegiate soccer: In the 30
NCAA tournaments in history, 20 have ended with
the Tar Heels lifting the trophy. For its most
recent championship, North Carolina beat
Stanford 1-0 in the 2009 title game. The Cardinal
is 0-8-3 all-time against the Tar Heels.
UNC head coach Anson Dorrance constantly
juggled his lineup during the regular season, as
starters left the team to compete in youth world
cups. But with a full stock of weapons back at his
disposal, Dorrance's team has been peaking at the
right time.
In the second round of the NCAA tournament,
the Tar Heels exploded for a 9-2 win over Illinois.
The Tar Heels' next two games both went into
extra time. In the third round, UNC dispatched
Baylor in a penalty kick shootout after extra time
ended with the score locked at one. UNC's quar
terfinal match then went deep into double over
time before Crystal Dunn gave the Tar Heels a 2-
1 victory over BYU.
"Anson Dorrance is one of the greatest coach
es ever in women's soccer," Ratcliffe said. "We
expect a really difficult match. They have some
fantastic athletes so they're always a strong pro
gram."
Both teams boast heavy star power all over the
field. For UNC, Dunn, a member of the U2O USA
national team, leads the charge. The junior has
racked up 13 points this season including all
three goals against Baylor and BYU —while
playing all over the field.
Stanford will also have its hands full with UNC
freshman Summer Green. The forward leads the
Tar Heels in scoring with 21 points, despite only
playing in 15 matches due to the Ul7 World Cup.
Overall, the Tar Heels have seven players with
double-digit point totals.
Senior Adelaide Gay, who enters the game hav
ing let in an average of just .64 goals per game, will
be manning the net for the Tar Heels.
Stanford has its own U2O national team star in
sophomore Chioma Übogagu. The forward has
five goals and 11 assists in 17 games for the
Cardinal.
While redshirt junior Courtney Verloo tops the
scoring charts with 31 points, Cardinal goals can

come from anywhere. In the NCAA tournament
alone, six different players have scored for
Stanford.
On defense, seniors Alina Garciamendez and
Rachel Quon were both recently chosen as semifi
nalists for the MAC Hermann Trophy, the most
prestigious honor in collegiate soccer. Both play
ers are captains and four-year starters.
Behind the backline stands junior Emily
Oliver, arguably the best goalkeeper in the coun
try. Since returning from injury earlier this sea
son, the Ail-American has let in an average of .47
goals per game, fifth in the nation and best of the
remaining goalkeepers.
The biggest strength for the Cardinal, though,
is leadership.
"This team has strong character and fantastic
internal leadership," Ratcliffe said. "We wanted to
go to the College Cup and it was the leadership
that got us there."
This year's 10-member senior class has
reached the NCAA final in each of the past three
seasons and captured the program's first national
championship last year.
"This whole season, we've played huge games

and in front of a lot of people already," Quon said
after the UCLA game. "It's just another game
that we have to put away. It's business as usual
and we'll take it one game at a time."
To defeat the Tar Heels for the first time ever,
Ratcliffe said his team has to be ready to compete
from the opening whistle.
"[We have to play] with confidence and just
have a good mindset at the beginning of the
game," Ratcliffe said.
The winner of the North Carolina-Stanford
match will meet either Penn State or Florida in
the finals on Sunday afternoon. The Cardinal beat
Penn State 3-2 on Aug. 24 and has not played
Florida State this year - . According to Ratcliffe,
Stanford has not thought about facing any oppo
nent beyond the Tar Heels.
"The College Cup is a great showcase for
women's soccer," Ratcliffe said. "I'm excited to be
involved in the games and hang out with our team.
For our seniors, its our last event together. And
obviously, [l'm excited] for the opportunity to win
a national championship."

seasons and captured the program's first national
championship last year.
"This whole season, we've played huge games

and in front of a lot of people already," Quon said
after the UCLA game. "It's just another game
that we have to put away. It's business as usual
and we'll take it one game at a time."
To defeat the Tar Heels for the first time ever,
Ratcliffe said his team has to be ready to compete
from the opening whistle.
"[We have to play] with confidence and just
have a good mindset at the beginning of the
game," Ratcliffe said.
The winner of the North Carolina-Stanford
match will meet either Penn State or Florida in
the finals on Sunday afternoon. The Cardinal beat
Penn State 3-2 on Aug. 24 and has not played
Florida State this year - . According to Ratcliffe,
Stanford has not thought about facing any oppo
nent beyond the Tar Heels.
"The College Cup is a great showcase for
women's soccer," Ratcliffe said. "I'm excited to be
involved in the games and hang out with our team.
For our seniors, its our last event together. And
obviously, [l'm excited] for the opportunity to win
a national championship."

Senior defender Alina Garciamendez scored in last year's College Cup opener and will be
looking to contribute again as Stanford aims to repeat as national champions this weekend.
Its Final Four begins against No. 13 North Carolina tonight, with a possible final on Sunday.
For most teams in the country, qualifying for
the NCAA semifinals would make for a successful
season. But for the defending national champions,
anything but another title would be a disappoint
ment.

"The goal is not just to get back [to the College
Cup], the goal is to win a national championship,"
said Paul Ratcliffe, women's soccer head coach.
"We're happy to be back there, but we're not sat
isfied."
The No. 1 Cardinal reached its fifth consecu
tive Final Four after a thrilling 2-1 victory over
No. 6 UCLA. Sophomore Lo'eau Laßonta scored
two goals in the second half as Stanford (21-1-1)
rallied to erase an early Bruin lead for the second
time this season.
The next challenge for Stanford is to take on
No. 13 North Carolina on Friday night in San
Diego.
UNC (13-5-3) boasts the most successful pro
gram in the history of collegiate soccer: In the 30
NCAA tournaments in history, 20 have ended with
the Tar Heels lifting the trophy. For its most
recent championship, North Carolina beat
Stanford 1-0 in the 2009 title game. The Cardinal
is 0-8-3 all-time against the Tar Heels.
UNC head coach Anson Dorrance constantly
juggled his lineup during the regular season, as
starters left the team to compete in youth world
cups. But with a full stock of weapons back at his
disposal, Dorrance's team has been peaking at the
right time.
In the second round of the NCAA tournament,
the Tar Heels exploded for a 9-2 win over Illinois.
The Tar Heels' next two games both went into
extra time. In the third round, UNC dispatched
Baylor in a penalty kick shootout after extra time
ended with the score locked at one. UNC's quar
terfinal match then went deep into double over
time before Crystal Dunn gave the Tar Heels a 2-
1 victory over BYU.
"Anson Dorrance is one of the greatest coach
es ever in women's soccer," Ratcliffe said. "We
expect a really difficult match. They have some
fantastic athletes so they're always a strong pro
gram."
Both teams boast heavy star power all over the
field. For UNC, Dunn, a member of the U2O USA
national team, leads the charge. The junior has
racked up 13 points this season including all
three goals against Baylor and BYU —while
playing all over the field.
Stanford will also have its hands full with UNC
freshman Summer Green. The forward leads the
Tar Heels in scoring with 21 points, despite only
playing in 15 matches due to the Ul7 World Cup.
Overall, the Tar Heels have seven players with
double-digit point totals.
Senior Adelaide Gay, who enters the game hav
ing let in an average of just .64 goals per game, will
be manning the net for the Tar Heels.
Stanford has its own U2O national team star in
sophomore Chioma Übogagu. The forward has
five goals and 11 assists in 17 games for the
Cardinal.
While redshirt junior Courtney Verloo tops the
scoring charts with 31 points, Cardinal goals can

come from anywhere. In the NCAA tournament
alone, six different players have scored for
Stanford.
On defense, seniors Alina Garciamendez and
Rachel Quon were both recently chosen as semifi
nalists for the MAC Hermann Trophy, the most
prestigious honor in collegiate soccer. Both play
ers are captains and four-year starters.
Behind the backline stands junior Emily
Oliver, arguably the best goalkeeper in the coun
try. Since returning from injury earlier this sea
son, the Ail-American has let in an average of .47
goals per game, fifth in the nation and best of the
remaining goalkeepers.
The biggest strength for the Cardinal, though,
is leadership.
"This team has strong character and fantastic
internal leadership," Ratcliffe said. "We wanted to
go to the College Cup and it was the leadership
that got us there."
This year's 10-member senior class has
reached the NCAA final in each of the past three
seasons and captured the program's first national
championship last year.
