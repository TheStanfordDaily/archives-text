## SEEING GREEN A
						line in the sand 
### Holly Moeller 
PUNAKAIKI, New Zealand
The west coast of New
Zealand's South Island is an
open place. Not the
Canterbury plains kind of open,
with their smooth expanse of
hedgerow-lined grazing lands.
Instead, it's the kind of open that
lets you drive for kilometer after
kilometer, your gaze sweeping from
the upward slopes of terraced
mountains to the blue horizon of the
Tasman Sea, without a single house
or car or human silhouette crossing
your line of sight.
The reasons for this are primari
ly logistical, Jamie explains, as he
steers the car along the highway.
Only a few mountain passes connect
the west coast to the island's more
populous eastern side. And only a
few spots along the rugged coast
line offer good shelter from the
Tasman's often-stormy weather.
As a result, the west coast is the
place to find vast stretches of New
Zealand's remaining lowland tem
perate rainforest, three of the
nation's national parks and kilome
ters of naturally sculpted coastline
dotted with only the occasional bed
and-breakfast.
Aside from the occasional home
or dairy farm, New Zealand's
Department of Conservation holds
sway over most of the western land
area. Given the colloquial meaning
of the word "conservation" and
New Zealand's reputation for care
ful environmental stewardship, one
might guess that the land is in good
hands.
Then comes the first glimpse of
a coal train, climbing eastward over
the Southern Alps towards
Christchurch cargo ships, laden
with ancient rock scraped from a
west coast hillside.
As the economies of New
Zealand's regional trading partners
especially China have grown,
the island nation has struggled with
an increasingly uneasy balance
between its fundamental commit
ment to the preservation of the nat
ural environment and the economic
appeal of resource exploitation.
On the one hand, an immensely
profitable but shoddily regulated
dairy industry increasingly threat
ens the health of local waterways.
On the other, citizen protests
including a 40,000-strong march in
2010 stopped government plans
to open national park land to min
ing.
Still, tensions over mining peri
odically spark flurries of news activ
ity. Currently making headlines is
the Crown Minerals Bill, which
could transfer significant power
away from the conservation min
istry, allowing economic ministers
to control mining access and the
conservation status of lands.
For an American abroad, it
brings up disturbing echoes of our
own debates over land use. For us,
at least, the national parks remain
sacred. And as we've established
additional reserves, we've nudged

out existing economic interests
buying out, for example, the com
mercial fishermen who visited
Papahanaumokuakea in the
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
Since the establishment of
Yosemite then a state park in
1864, our country has honored a
conservation ethic that forever pre
serves exceptionally picturesque
portions of the nation. We have rec
ognized the intrinsic value of these
locations and taken pride in them as
icons of our nation. And we've con
tinued to grow their ranks from
the national park to the wildlife
refuge to the recreation area.
Yet whenever the perceived eco
nomic benefits are high particu
larly as fossil fuel prices soar we
scoff at the line in the sand that sep
arates our souls from our wallets.
Take, for example, the perennial
battle over drilling in the Arctic.
The last five years have seen us
swing wildly between "Drill, baby,
drill" and portraits of polar bears,
look askance at many a politician's
wobbly campaign promises about
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,
and watch as Shell tried, and failed,
to initiate offshore drilling in the
Chukchi Sea this past summer.
Perhaps it's telling that this cur
rent battleground is a place so
remote that few of us will ever see
it. For one, it speaks to our expand
ing technological arsenal, whose
development is driven by the
increasing value of dwindling natu
ral resources. And it underscores
just how crowded our planet has
become, not just by 7 billion people,
but by 7 billion sets of hopes and
dreams and wants that are
slightly bigger than those of the
generation before.
Jamie downshifts and pulls off
the road in Paparoa National Park.
We wander down a path cut through
a thicket of native tree ferns and
flax bushes, emerging onto a lime
stone outcrop that has eroded to
reveal thousands of delicately
and sometimes precariously
stacked layers: the famous Pancake
Rocks.
The Department of Conservation
has carefully marked a line around
the bluffs not to be crossed, for safe
ty's sake. I lean over the railing to
watch the waves churn through the
narrow channels and deep pools
below. "D'you think you could kayak
in that?" asks Jamie, a New
Zealander through and through. A
few tourists eye us warily. It feels
crowded for the first time that day.
