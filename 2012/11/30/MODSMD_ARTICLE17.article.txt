## In defense of Hostess 
### Alex Bayer 
I have mixed feelings about the
prospect of Hostess going bank
rupt and fading away. I have
some good memories tied to these
trans fat delights. Before I had any
concept of health food, back when I
ate Lunchables on a regular basis, I
ate Hostess pies every week to
pump myself up for Hebrew school.
How can I forget that very distinct
sensation of something cold, lumpy
and reminiscent of something
"apple" sliding down my esophagus,
battling my immune system along
the way and finally sinking to the
bottommost pit of my stomach?
Twinkies were a staple of my lunch
bags. Sometimes you can forget it's
there, and 10 weeks later, you open
the secret compartment in your
backpack and it's still good. Who can
compete with that?
I'm sentimental about things I
shouldn't be, and Hostess is at the
top of that list. My conscience is
opposed. Ethically speaking,
Hostess might as well be the poster
child for the processed food industry
that exhibits microscopic amounts of
respect for its assembly line work
ers and the consumers whose arter
ies its products are fatally clogging.
Just the mention of Hostess con
jures up awful visions of vats filled
with mystery sludge, smokestacks
coughing out soot, bleak industrial
parks in Ohio and New Jersey and
food dyes concocted from crushed
insect parts. God, I hope these are
just my dystopian nightmares.
On a brighter note, people like

me are becoming more informed
about the benefits of eating healthy
and more wary of inscrutable ingre
dient lists. I can't think of anywhere
where this movement is more pres
ent than in Northern California,
practically the birthplace of Alice
Waters, locavorism and phrases like
"artisan ingredients," "heirloom,"
and "grass-fed." In this rewritten bal
ance of power, Whole Foods is the
supermarket powerhouse, Chipotle is
the go-to for fast food and Clif Bars
are infiltrating the candy bar aisle.
The casualties of this movement
are archaic brands like Hostess,
whose executives are not nimble
enough to rebrand their products in
disingenuous, business-sawy ways,
like the trend-reflexive charlatans at
McDonald's and Walmart. But the
real challenge that has stymied
Hostess's efforts to don the "all-nat
ural" veil is simple: sugary, guilt-rid
den goodness is its brand. There's
something refreshingly up-front
about how blatantly artificial
Wonder Bread and Twinkies are.
Hostess, unlike so many of its
processed food competitors, has
made no effort to smack a green leaf
on its Hostess pie wrappers or
extract the phrase "contains natural
flavors" and stick it on a box of Mini
Muffins as if it were the title of a ser
mon on wholesomeness. Truth be
told, I prefer Hostess's absurdly,
unwittingly honest approach to the
deception of companies with stronger
marketing departments. What do I
trust more? A Hostess chocolate cup-

cake that is unabashedly artificial
and which I know is not going to win
any kudos from my stomach, or a
box of Froot Loops tantalizing me
with its promise of whole grains and
fiber?
I know what to eat most of the
time and what to eat on occasion, in
late-night moments of bad decision
making. In a perfect world, the
whole universe of processed food
would be gone, and Hostess along
with it, my childhood nostalgia be
damned.
But in the current reality, in
which multibillion-dollar corpora
tions continue to exist and evolve
despite everything, I would gladly
take the frank unhealthiness of
Hostess over the oatmeal secretly
loaded with sugar, the "salad"
secretly packed with as much fat as
a Whopper and the mango smoothie
that bears not a single trace of
mango nor nutrient. It's this gray
area of terrible-for-you processed
food masquerading as healthy food
that is the most dangerous enemy of
the food revolution, not the Twinkie
whose artificiality borders on leg
endary. It's perfectly OK to have
chocolate cake every once in a while,
but when chocolate cake is being
3sold as a "low-calorie, low-fat, high
in-fiber, sugar-free, gluten-free"
pseudo-healthy snack, then dang,
I'm going to eat cake every day.
