Only 30,000 of the 50,000 seats in Stanford
Stadium had been sold for the Pac-12
Championship game as of Wednesday morn
ing, the San Jose Mercury News reported
yesterday. Stanford's director of ticket sales
and services still expected the final atten
dance to reach into the mid-40,0005.
Last year's inaugural conference title
game between UCLA and Oregon filled
54,000-seat Autzen Stadium.
