# STORM'S BRUIN
## UCLA stands in way of Cards first Rose Bowl since 2000 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Played at the 65,000-seat Alamodome in San
Antonio, Tex., the Valero Alamo Bowl is one
of the most prestigious non-BCS bowls in
college football. It has drawn a crowd of
60,000-plus in six of its last eight years. It has
produced eight of the 20 most-watched bowl games in
ESPN broadcast history. San Antonio, the seventh
largest city in the nation, overflows with rich history
and deep tradition.
But as great as that sounds, San Antonio is not
where the Cardinal wants to be come Dec. 29. In fact,
Stanford doesn't even want to play on that day.
The Cardinal dreams a bigger dream: the Rose
Bowl.
Tonight, that dream will be either made or broken
as No. 8 Stanford (10-2,8-1 Pac-12) hosts No. 16 UCLA
(9-3, 6-3) in the Pac-12 Championship Game, with the
winner automatically advancing to the prestigious
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Virtually written off by the media in the preseason,
the Cardinal is now in position to claim its first berth to
the Granddaddy of Them All since the 1999-2000 sea
son and its first conference title since the Pac-10
became the Pac-12.
"I remember when nobody was giving us a look down
at the Pac-12 media day," said outside linebacker Chase
Tomas, who was named a finalist for the Lott IMPACT

After shutting down UCLA last week, Shayne
Skov and the defense can now clinch a title.
Trophy on Thursday. "I guess people
out there just don't get it. They don't
understand what type of guys we
have on this team. The kinds of coach
es we have. We're not going away."
Tonight's conference champi
onship is a rematch of the game
played at the Rose Bowl Stadium
just six days ago, when the Cardinal
clobbered the Bruins 35-17.
However, head coach David Shaw
expects a much stiffen test the sec
ond time around.
"I except [UCLA] to give us
everything," said Shaw, the Pac-12
coach of the year for the second
straight season. "I expect this to be
a very tough, physical game. It's
going to be hard; it's going to be 10
times harder than last week's game
was.
"It's really hard to beat a team
twice, in particular back-to-back
weeks. You have to fight complacen
cy. They're going to come back with
a chip on their shoulders. They're
coming back faster, stronger and
better."
If Stanford hopes to punch its
ticket to Pasadena, its suffocating
defense will have to continue its
take-no-prisoners attitude and play
that has carried the team all season.
The front seven had its weekly
party in the backfield last Saturday
against the Bruins, holding Doak
Walker Award finalist Jonathan
Franklin to a season-low 3.1 yards
per carry and taking down quarter
back Brett Hundley behind the line
of scrimmage seven times.
It shouldn't come as a surprise
that the Cardinal defense is ranked
first in the nation in run defense
(71.33 yards per game), sacks (4.42
per game) and tackles for loss (9.25
per game). The unit is also among
the top 15 in scoring defense (16.92
points per game) and third-down
defensive efficiency (29.53 percent).
While Bruins head coach Jim
Mora repeatedly shot down specu
lation that his team had tanked the
game last Saturday consciously
or subconsciously the Cardinal is
prepared to see new wrinkles of
UCLA's offense.
"[UCLA] probably has some
tricks up their sleeves that we did
n't see," said outside linebacker
Trent Murphy, who was an All-Pac
-12 first team selection. "We'll defi
nitely go back to see what worked
best for them in the game, and I'm
sure they'll try new things, espe
cially against an opponent they're
playing two weeks in a row."

Hundley's scrambling abilities in
particular have yet to be displayed
in full force. The redshirt fresh
man's 38-yard scramble near the
end of the third quarter last
Saturday gave a glimpse of the dam
age his feet can inflict. Stanford's
defenders observed firsthand how
slippery Hundley can be.
"[Hundley] has a great first
step," Thomas commented. "He
usually makes the first guy miss. I
know he made me miss twice [on
Saturday], but what our defense
does do is corral to the quarterback.
Both times when someone missed,
we still ended up with the sack. We
had guys coming after him, harass
ing him."

The offensive line, which ranks
in the nation's bottom five in both
sacks (3.58 per game) and tackles
for loss (8.00 per game) allowed, did
no favors for UCLA's offensive
weapons in round one. Hundley had
to work miracles in the pocket just
to keep plays alive, and Franklin
rarely saw openings when he
touched the ball.
Another dangerous playmaker
that the Cardinal secondary needs
to lock down on tonight is tight end
Joseph Fauria. The 6-foot-7, 255-
pound redshirt senior was especial
ly effective early in last Saturday's
game, hauling in a 17-yard first
quarter touchdown despite tight
coverage from cornerback Alex

Carter. Fauria and his obvious
threat in the passing game have
garnered a heap of praise from
Shaw, who drew parallels between
the Bruins star and Stanford's own
tall tight end, Levine Toilolo.
Having won 19 of its last 20
home games, Stanford is also riding
an eight-game home win streak into
tonight. Much of the Cardinal's late
season momentum can be attrib
uted to the dual-threat capability of
quarterback Kevin Hogan. After
efficiently completing 15-of-22 pass
es for 160 yards and a score six days
ago, the redshirt freshman hopes to
lead his team to victory over a
ranked opponent for the fourth con
secutive week.

"We're moving the ball well right
now and putting some points on the
board," Hogan said. "I'm hoping we
can continue that on Friday night."
Running back Stepfan Taylor
only needed a little over two quar
ters to rush for 142 yards on 20 car
ries in his previous encounter with
the Bruins, but should carry a heav
ier load in round two tonight. The
senior tailback, just 35 yards shy of
Darrin Nelson's all-time Stanford
record, is etching his legacy even
deeper as the season closes, averag
ing 139 yards in his last three
games against some of the best
defenses in the conference.
The Cardinal has stayed
remarkably healthy this season but
will be missing punter Daniel
Zychlinski, who was wrecked by
Bruins linebacker Anthony Barr
last Saturday. While the fifth-year
senior has excelled in handing oppo
nents poor field position all year,
backup punter Ben Rhyne is more
than ready to step up. Senior wide
out and punt returner Drew Terrell
was shaken up last weekend and did
not re-enter the game, but Shaw
says that he is "fired up and ready
to go" for tonight.

A month ago, a reporter asked
Taylor after the Oregon State game
what playing one more game at
Stanford Stadium would mean to
him.
Not realizing that his team
would earn the right to host the
Pac-12 Championship Game if it
won out, the captain replied, "I
would love to play here [again]; it's
our stadium. But I don't know how
we can. I mean, can we?"
Two statement wins later, Taylor
had answered his own question.
"Getting one more game is spe
cial for those guys," Shaw said.
"They're real excited about it. I
think you get an idea of what our
team is like because our younger
guys are excited for our seniors. It's
not just that they're excited to be in
the game. They're excited that the
seniors get to come in the stadium
one more time. I think that shows
how tight of a team we are."
Stanford and UCLA clash for
Pac-12 supremacy tonight at 5 p.m.,
with national broadcast on FOX.
The Rose Bowl awaits the winner.
