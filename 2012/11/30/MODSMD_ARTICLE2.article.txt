## UCLA stands in way of Cards first Rose Bowl since 2000 
### GEORGE CHEN DESK EDITOR 
Played at the 65,000-seat Alamodome in San
Antonio, Tex., the Valero Alamo Bowl is one
of the most prestigious non-BCS bowls in
college football. It has drawn a crowd of
60,000-plus in six of its last eight years. It has
produced eight of the 20 most-watched bowl games in
ESPN broadcast history. San Antonio, the seventh
largest city in the nation, overflows with rich history
and deep tradition.
But as great as that sounds, San Antonio is not
where the Cardinal wants to be come Dec. 29. In fact,
Stanford doesn't even want to play on that day.
The Cardinal dreams a bigger dream: the Rose
Bowl.
Tonight, that dream will be either made or broken
as No. 8 Stanford (10-2,8-1 Pac-12) hosts No. 16 UCLA
(9-3, 6-3) in the Pac-12 Championship Game, with the
winner automatically advancing to the prestigious
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Virtually written off by the media in the preseason,
the Cardinal is now in position to claim its first berth to
the Granddaddy of Them All since the 1999-2000 sea
son and its first conference title since the Pac-10
became the Pac-12.
"I remember when nobody was giving us a look down
at the Pac-12 media day," said outside linebacker Chase
Tomas, who was named a finalist for the Lott IMPACT

After shutting down UCLA last week, Shayne
Skov and the defense can now clinch a title.
