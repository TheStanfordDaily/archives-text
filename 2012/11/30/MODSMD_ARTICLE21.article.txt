## Fall Fashion Fever 
### Renjie Wong | FELLOW 
It's that time of the year again—the three awkward weeks
that stand in the way between the unadulterated joys of
Thanksgiving and winter break. Between the unwieldy
turned weather, the mad whirlwind of lectures and exams and
actually finding time to —dare we say it?— sleep, the average
Stanford student is often left with little time or energy to figure
out the perplexing situation on the fashion front.
But now is when we at Intermission let you in on our
favorite top-secret life-hack ever discovered: Dressing well
makes acing your finals a whole lot easier. That's right —putting
your best foot forward in Chem 221 is inevitably much more
effective with a pair of sleek suede boots. (How else do you
think you'll bond with that advanced organic chemistry profes
sor? Pun intended.) And studies show it! Here, we examine the
best ways to navigate the articles, colors and textures of a well
assembled autumnal wardrobe.
Articles
No, the sky gods aren't having a giant Dionysian frat
party —it's just the fall weather being unpredictable. With the
temperature fluctuating more than the quality of food at
Lagunita and the rain more fickle than the guy in front of you
at The Axe and Palm, layering clearly is your best friend.
Cardigans make for a versatile, easily removable and whol
ly stylish addition to your outfit, and can even serve as an ele
gant outermost layer if they feature fisherman or cable knits —
intricate ribs and weaves on the front panels that provide rich
visual texture. Added bonus: gender neutral!
There really is no better time, too, to break out the scarves,
because really, nothing keeps you company and warms the
cockles of your heart on the cold, lonely bike ride to your 8 a.m.
lecture like a chunky scarf wrapped around your gullet.
Whether chiffon silk or luxurious pashmina, a scarf draped
casually around the neck adds an element of degage cool to
your outfit, lifting you from Plain Jane to style savant.
We'd say that the best thing about fall is that it becomes
too cold for people to wear flip-flops anymore—keep them to
the beach and the bathroom, folks! —but then the Ugg boots
rear their shearling heads, and those aren't much better, either.
(There's a reason why they're called Uggs ... #justsaying.) We'd
much prefer the sleeker silhouette of proper boots, which pro
vide warmth, elegance and ankle support for the hypothetical
post-downpour bike accident. So leave the Uggies for apres-ski,
and try the attire of equestrians and motorists with some knee
length leathers or calf-high biker boots.

Colors
With the passing of summer's exuberant vibrance, season
ally appropriate clothing naturally takes on muter tones —
because really, who but the most sartorially incontinent among
us could bear to wear sky blue in the overcast weather that we
have been plagued with in recent weeks?
Yet if summer is the season for a firework display of fash
ion colors and winter the season for somber navy and mono
chrome, then surely fall is what German philosopher and dandy
Gottfried Leibniz would describe as the "best of all possible
worlds."
The trick with this limbo is striking a balance between
these sartorial extremes —autumn, in fact, has traditionally
been a time for men to incorporate a full palette of colors into
their wardrobes with subdued appropriateness without looking
like Willy Wonka.
Mirroring the rich shades of nature is arguably the best
way to rack up the autumnal style stakes: between moss green,
tan, chocolate, burnt orange, burgundy and aubergine, you've
essentially got your bases covered. A mustard fine-gauge V-neck
cashmere sweater, for instance, bespeaks just the right amount
of transitional chic, and quintessential American designers
Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren are clearly on to this tonal
secret; across the pond, too, storied English labels Mulberry and
Burberry fly the fall color flag high. (We'd drop a poor gag
about these berries going back to nature, but we're saving that
for spring pickin'.) Think Fonzworth Bentley, not Andree 3000.
And just because we know someone out there is wonder
ing: No, the cardinal red of your standard-issue Stanford hood
ie, most unfortunately, does not count as earth-tone.
Textures
There is an old Native American proverb that goes: With
the hot Stanford summer out of the way, aesthetically pleasing
textures come out to play. Woolen knits are the easiest way to
incorporate something other than plain ol' cotton into your
wardrobe —from scarves to sweaters to cardigans, the rougher,
uneven nap provides textural contrast, almost as a sartorial
metaphor for the impending winter. In the same line of
thought, tweed coats, too, make for an interesting diversion
from the usual puffy nylon parkas that overrun Stanford.
And while jeans will work with anything, surely you could
do better than to wear them all year round (yes, we know you
haven't washed them since winter quarter freshman year).
Corduroy pants are a traditional fall favorite and often come in
the aforementioned autumnal colors that are considerably

snappier than the typical navy tones of denim. A word of cau
tion, though: Too narrow a width of the wale —the ribs that
form corduroy's distinctive pattern —and the fabric becomes
dangerously similar in appearance to velvet. No one wants to
look like a has-been '6os disco star.
At the top end of the style spectrum are fur and leather,
which would look too over-the-top for summer but are lush
enough for autumn. Not quite for the shrinking violet, these
materials feature heavily in ultra-stylish Italian labels
Ermenegildo Zegna and Gucci's fall/winter collections. A motor
cycle coat made from shearling—where the fur is still attached
to the sheepskin pelt—makes for a truly badass combination of
these two materials, putting the winning back in twinning. And
worry not, all ye animal activist types —we fully approve of sub
stitute materials, too, so keep calm and pleather on.
A final word
Having mastered the mysteries of transitional dressing,
here's an extra little secret for the newfound natty ninja in you:
Because around this neck of the woods, January and February
are really just autumn masquerading as winter, these fall tips
will see you through the next quarter, too. Now go forth and
with your professorial sartorial trappings, master this fall —and
finals.
