# Shawn Estrada's Inspired Ink

To the untrained eye, students on the Farm seem like typi
cal future doctors, lawyers and business executives —they
all look just the same. A closer examination reveals cer
tain markers and attributes that prove even the blandest Tree has
deep roots. A cleverly hidden tattoo placed tastefully on the back
of the neck distinguishes Shawn Estrada 'l4 from her talented
peers.
The scripted phrase, "Let Love In," brilliandy characterizes
the bold and confident Estrada even better than her role as presi
dent of Stanford Mock Trial or her aspiration to pass the bar.
Inked for the first and only time a little over one year ago,
Estrada still believes in the powerful message the tattoo holds.
She was inspired by phrase after seeing it signed by Glee actress
Dianna Agron at the end of a blog post advocating for gay rights.
"It's just the philosophy, really, of living life with love
instead of hate that stuck with me," Estrada remarked.
As expected, her parents weren't quite as struck by the mes
sage tattooed on their daughter. Friends, on the other hand,
though slightly shocked, enjoyed being able to make certain sug
gestive jokes out of the phrase at Estrada's (admittedly amused)
expense.
Estrada reminisced about the experience of walking into a
super heavy metal tattoo shop with her friend and asking for a
"super girly" tattoo.
"I almost think that it made my hardcore tattoo artist a lit
tle uneasy.... He drew the tattoo on in pen and kept having to
redo it because it was crooked," Estrada said.
Even after a year, Estrada still loves her tattoo. She admits it
was a little inconvenient over the summer because she was work
ing in a professional law firm where tattoos are generally not
smiled upon.
"It was a problem because sometimes I forget it's there,
honestly, because I can't see it," she confessed.

Still, it's those perfect moments where Estrada doesn't have
to be a model of professionalism—the moments where she can
put her hair up in a ponytail and be completely real —where you
can catch a glimpse of the tattoo and tangibly see her outside
the-box personality.
