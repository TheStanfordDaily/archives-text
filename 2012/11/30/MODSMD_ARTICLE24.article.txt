# INSIDE THE DAILY
## Bennett-Smith chosen as new EIC 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Miles Bennett-Smith 'l3,
current managing editor of
sports hailing from
Sacramento, was elected as
spring editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily last night.
"We're gonna make it nasty,"
Bennett-Smith remarked,
stroking his pedo-stache,
when asked what his plans
are for the upcoming volume.
Not all staffers, however,
voiced unequivocal support.
"I am deeply disheartened
by the election of Bennett-
Smith," Daily managing edi
tor of news Marwa Farag 'l4
said. "First off, no one from
the sports department should
have any power besides
cleaning the toilets. Second
off, Miles wasn't even smart
enough to predict a 10-1
Cardinal victory in the Big
Game."
"I predicted Miles' elec
tion," said Daily sports editor
Sam Fisher 'l4, cleaning the
toilets with one hand and
tweeting with the other. "Now
to work on his pocket pres
ence."
Bennett-Smith's election
raises a serious issue of jour
nalistic integrity for The
Daily. A disgusting mustache
has been growing on Bennett-
Smith's face for Movember,
serving as a giant face-bill
board for Kappa Alpha's
"Mustachio Bashio" party this
weekend.
"Miles was the only sports
analyst in the nation who pre
dicted that Stanford would
upset Oregon," said Daily
sports editor George Chen
'l5, who has yet to be promot
ed from the urinal to the toilet
cleaning job. "If that and his
1,000 spotless toilets don't
make him qualified for run
ning a student newspaper,
then I don't know what does."
"The Cardinal win every
game that I watch," added
Daily sports editor and AARP
member Tom Taylor '47.
Joey "Joseph" Beyda, still
listed as questionable on The
Daily's weekly injury report
with a chronic back strain,
was munching on urinal cakes
and could not be reached for
comment.
"I'm moderately excited

for Miles," said current editor
in chief Billy Gallagher 'l4
while sipping four Red Bulls.
"I just hope he upholds the
strict jorts dress code that I
maintain."
After polls closed, staffers
had to interrupt Bennett-
Smith from performing a
Brahms violin concerto in a
corner of the office to inform
him that he had been elected
editor in chief. Bennett-Smith
silently dropped to the
ground and Tebowed for
three hours.
"Running a newspaper is
like conducting an orchestra,"
he said, looking into the dis
tance of the Lorry Lokey
Building while strumming his
violin like a ukulele. "You
have to be sensitive to the
moving parts."
Bennett-Smith is multifac
eted, with an extensive
resume including a star turn
at synchronized swimming
and serving as first-base
coach for Bill Buckner.
Still, hearing that
Bennett-Smith would take
the reins of the company, VP
of Sales Caroline Caselli 'l2
was underwhelmed.
"Woof," Caselli said.
Sources suggested she is still
bitter that Bennett-Smith
threw the annual Ink Bowl to
cover his gambling debts but
didn't funnel any of the
money to the advertising divi
sion.

Kathleen Chaykowski 'l3,
former editor in chief, and
head copy editors Matt Olson
'l4 and Charlotte Wayne 'l4
were feeling pretty stoked
about things. Chaykowski
went around offering people
sugar, as usual.
Intermission editor Sasha
Arijanto 'l4 peered patroniz
ingly through her horn
rimmed glasses and scoffed at
her co-workers' enthusiasm.
"Ugh," she said. "I knew
Bennett-Smith before he was
elected. He listens to way too
much Tyga and not enough
[the reporter was unable to
understand or spell the artist
that Arijanto named despite
trying four times]."
Bennett-Smith clearly had
mixed feelings about his suc
cess.
"Why can't I find friends?"
he asked, looking around the
office while editors avoided
eye contact.
The Stanford Review did
not endorse Bennett-Smith,
but rather advocated that The
Daily reverse its long-stand
ing support of free speech.
Bennett-Smith will take
office on Feb. 1, giving him
plenty of time to shave his
mustache and denounce the
Red Sox before taking office.

and serving as first-base
coach for Bill Buckner.
Still, hearing that
Bennett-Smith would take
the reins of the company, VP
of Sales Caroline Caselli 'l2
was underwhelmed.
"Woof," Caselli said.
Sources suggested she is still
bitter that Bennett-Smith
threw the annual Ink Bowl to
cover his gambling debts but
didn't funnel any of the
money to the advertising divi
sion.

Kathleen Chaykowski 'l3,
former editor in chief, and
head copy editors Matt Olson
'l4 and Charlotte Wayne 'l4
were feeling pretty stoked
about things. Chaykowski
went around offering people
sugar, as usual.
Intermission editor Sasha
Arijanto 'l4 peered patroniz
ingly through her horn
rimmed glasses and scoffed at
her co-workers' enthusiasm.
"Ugh," she said. "I knew
Bennett-Smith before he was
elected. He listens to way too
much Tyga and not enough
[the reporter was unable to
understand or spell the artist
that Arijanto named despite
trying four times]."
Bennett-Smith clearly had
mixed feelings about his suc
cess.
"Why can't I find friends?"
he asked, looking around the
office while editors avoided
eye contact.
The Stanford Review did
not endorse Bennett-Smith,
but rather advocated that The
Daily reverse its long-stand
ing support of free speech.
Bennett-Smith will take
office on Feb. 1, giving him
plenty of time to shave his
mustache and denounce the
Red Sox before taking office.

Miles Bennett-Smith '13 was elected as the editor in chief
for Volume 243 on Thursday night. The current managing
editor of sports, Bennett-Smith will take office on Feb. 1.
Miles Bennett-Smith 'l3,
current managing editor of
sports hailing from
Sacramento, was elected as
spring editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily last night.
"We're gonna make it nasty,"
Bennett-Smith remarked,
stroking his pedo-stache,
when asked what his plans
are for the upcoming volume.
Not all staffers, however,
voiced unequivocal support.
"I am deeply disheartened
by the election of Bennett-
Smith," Daily managing edi
tor of news Marwa Farag 'l4
said. "First off, no one from
the sports department should
have any power besides
cleaning the toilets. Second
off, Miles wasn't even smart
enough to predict a 10-1
Cardinal victory in the Big
Game."
"I predicted Miles' elec
tion," said Daily sports editor
Sam Fisher 'l4, cleaning the
toilets with one hand and
tweeting with the other. "Now
to work on his pocket pres
ence."
Bennett-Smith's election
raises a serious issue of jour
nalistic integrity for The
Daily. A disgusting mustache
has been growing on Bennett-
Smith's face for Movember,
serving as a giant face-bill
board for Kappa Alpha's
"Mustachio Bashio" party this
weekend.
"Miles was the only sports
analyst in the nation who pre
dicted that Stanford would
upset Oregon," said Daily
sports editor George Chen
'l5, who has yet to be promot
ed from the urinal to the toilet
cleaning job. "If that and his
1,000 spotless toilets don't
make him qualified for run
ning a student newspaper,
then I don't know what does."
"The Cardinal win every
game that I watch," added
Daily sports editor and AARP
member Tom Taylor '47.
Joey "Joseph" Beyda, still
listed as questionable on The
Daily's weekly injury report
with a chronic back strain,
was munching on urinal cakes
and could not be reached for
comment.
"I'm moderately excited

for Miles," said current editor
in chief Billy Gallagher 'l4
while sipping four Red Bulls.
"I just hope he upholds the
strict jorts dress code that I
maintain."
After polls closed, staffers
had to interrupt Bennett-
Smith from performing a
Brahms violin concerto in a
corner of the office to inform
him that he had been elected
editor in chief. Bennett-Smith
silently dropped to the
ground and Tebowed for
three hours.
"Running a newspaper is
like conducting an orchestra,"
he said, looking into the dis
tance of the Lorry Lokey
Building while strumming his
violin like a ukulele. "You
have to be sensitive to the
moving parts."
Bennett-Smith is multifac
eted, with an extensive
resume including a star turn
at synchronized swimming
and serving as first-base
coach for Bill Buckner.
Still, hearing that
Bennett-Smith would take
the reins of the company, VP
of Sales Caroline Caselli 'l2
was underwhelmed.
"Woof," Caselli said.
