# THE 						ZOO
## Secret Genius in Us All THE 						STAMP OF STANFORD 
### Tara McCullough | FELLOW 
While on Thanksgiving break,
my mother questioned me
about every aspect of
Stanford. I love Stanford—and I love
talking about Stanford —and the ensu
ing impromptu spiel revealed even to
me what I actually think about my
experience thus far.
There's always that same, generic
question: What is your favorite thing
about Stanford? I said, "The people,"
like most students probably would —at
least, that was always my tour guide s
response when I visited Stanford. I
went on and said that I love the "secret
genius" factor, learning those insanely
interesting things about the people we
encounter on a daily basis.
Take the people on my floor: One
was in a Joe Nichols music video,
another does the voice-over for a
Nickelodeon TV show, another has
been published three times and one of
my roommates participated in the
Junior Olympics in taekwondo. The list
of the cool people I know goes on and
on for me, as it does for every student
here.
When I was talking about these
people, my Stanford brother said,
"Mom, we are the lame ones." I, of
course, somewhat agree. I don't see that
amazing secret genius quality about
myself that I see in others. However, my
dad reminded me that Stanford is a
zoo. Each of us is a different, unique
animal, at Stanford for a reason, adding
our wild characteristics to the
menagerie already present.
As we trudge on during this ninth
week, it's good to remember that we

can all hack it here; we all have the
secret genus factor somewhere within
us. That's why we are at Stanford. Even
though I don't consider myself a secret
genius, I know I am the only me —the
unique animal in our Stanford zoo.
