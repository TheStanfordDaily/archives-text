## Prof reported for publicly criticizing paper 
### JUSTINE MOORE 
Education as Self-Fashioning (ESF) pro
fessors reported Terry Castle, the Walter A.
Haas Professor in the Humanities, to admin
istration members after she read aloud and
publicly criticized a student's senior seminar
paper while critiquing student writing in
general at a Nov. 9 ESF lecture.
The incident was reported to Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences; Debra Satz, senior associate dean

for the humanities and aits; Harry Elam,
vice provost for undergraduate education
(VPUE); and Martha Cyert, senior associate
for VPUE, according to Dan Edelstein,
associate professor of French and Italian,
who teaches the ESF seminar "Learning for
a Public Life."
"We were uncomfortable with what hap
pened as a matter of professionalism,"
Edelstein said. "We felt that it was our duty
to let people know, people who are in our
chain of command, and so that's what we

did."
According to students who were at the
lecture, Castle used selections from the stu
dent's paper as an example of poor writing
among college students.
"She read aloud one run-on sentence
with inflection in such away that she seemed
to be looking at in a very condescending
manner," Stephen Goodspeed 'l6 said. "She
said that she simply hadn't been taught to
ameliorate this kind of writing
because it was at such a low
level."
Students in the ESF pro
gram are required to attend a
series of four plenary lectures
given by professors from
other universities about liber
al education. After these lec
tures, ESF faculty invite
Stanford professors to com
ment on and moderate discus
sions about the previous
week's lecture.
Castle, along with Joshua
Landy, associate professor of
French and Italian, was invit
ed to respond to a Nov. 2 lec
ture given by Princeton pro
fessor Alexander Nehamas
titled, "I Would Rather
Fashion My Mind Than
Rirnish It."
Castle was only expected
to comment on Nehamas' lec
ture, but instead she also
chose to read aloud a paper
from one of her senior semi
nars and criticize it in front of
the ESF class, commenting
on the difficulty of teaching
students with mediocre wilt
ing skills.
ESF professors did not
anticipate the sudden shift in
the discussion with Castle's
tangent about the decline of
student writing.
"I think perhaps some of
our surprise simply came
from the fact that it there was
no very obvious connection
between her statements and
Nehamas' lecture," Edelstein
said.
After reading aloud from

the paper, Castle made sever
al more general remarks
about how today's college stu
dents lack collegiate-level
writing skills.
"She essentially said that
we as college freshmen aren't
as advanced in rhetoric as stu
dents from 10 years ago,"
Goodspeed said.
Edelstein said that
Castle's statements were
completely unexpected, as the
professors did not ask her to
submit a preview of what she
planned to say beforehand.
"If I knew in advance that
this was her view about stu
dent writing, then I probably
would not have thought it wise
to share that view to the stu
dents in what was also a
[Program in Writing and
Rhetoric] writing seminar,"
Edelstein said.
Writing instructors associ
ated with the ESF seminars
sent emails to students after
the lecture assuring students
that the ESF professors did
not agree with all of Castle's
ideas and that their work
would not be publicly criti
cized.
"It is also highly irregular
for a faculty member to read
part of a student's paper with
out that student's permission
to a group especially for
the purpose of claiming that
the student may be funda
mentally unteachable,"
Melanie Conroy, one of the
writing instructors, told
Edelstein's students in an
email on Nov. 11.
"Rest assured that your
papers will never be shared
without due warning, and if
we do reference them, it will
be to show an example of good
student writing," she added.

Edelstein said that profes
sors also discussed Castle's
comments with students in
seminars during the week fol
lowing Castle's lecture.
"We did not want our stu
dents to think that it was not
possible for them to make any
gains in their writing or get
the sense that they were
somehow impaired perma
nently in their writing abili
ties, which is not at all what
we believe and not at all what
we've seen," Edelstein said.
Several students who
attended Castle's lecture
were more intrigued than dis
heartened by her remarks.
"I appreciated the fact
that she was honestly critical
of something. The reason I
appreciated that was since I
had stepped foot on this cam
pus six weeks earlier, I had
basically not heard a single
critical word about anything,"
Erica McDowell 'l6 said.
Goodspeed agreed, and
said that sometimes the ESF
program is "a little too uplift
ing and a little too much of an
intellectual safe haven."
According to Edelstein,
ESF professors chose not to
follow up with Castle about
her comments.
"I think we were more
concerned with our students,"
Edelstein said. "None of us
really felt like it was part of
our role as faculty to be polic
ing other faculty. What wor
ried us was that the students
would feel dispirited in their
attempts to write."
Castle was not available
for comment by time of publi
cation.

ideas and that their work
would not be publicly criti
cized.
"It is also highly irregular
for a faculty member to read
part of a student's paper with
out that student's permission
to a group especially for
the purpose of claiming that
the student may be funda
mentally unteachable,"
Melanie Conroy, one of the
writing instructors, told
Edelstein's students in an
email on Nov. 11.
"Rest assured that your
papers will never be shared
without due warning, and if
we do reference them, it will
be to show an example of good
student writing," she added.

Edelstein said that profes
sors also discussed Castle's
comments with students in
seminars during the week fol
lowing Castle's lecture.
"We did not want our stu
dents to think that it was not
possible for them to make any
gains in their writing or get
the sense that they were
somehow impaired perma
nently in their writing abili
ties, which is not at all what
we believe and not at all what
we've seen," Edelstein said.
Several students who
attended Castle's lecture
were more intrigued than dis
heartened by her remarks.
"I appreciated the fact
that she was honestly critical
of something. The reason I
appreciated that was since I
had stepped foot on this cam
pus six weeks earlier, I had
basically not heard a single
critical word about anything,"
Erica McDowell 'l6 said.
Goodspeed agreed, and
said that sometimes the ESF
program is "a little too uplift
ing and a little too much of an
intellectual safe haven."
According to Edelstein,
ESF professors chose not to
follow up with Castle about
her comments.
"I think we were more
concerned with our students,"
Edelstein said. "None of us
really felt like it was part of
our role as faculty to be polic
ing other faculty. What wor
ried us was that the students
would feel dispirited in their
attempts to write."
Castle was not available
for comment by time of publi
cation.

Education as Self-Fashioning (ESF) pro
fessors reported Terry Castle, the Walter A.
Haas Professor in the Humanities, to admin
istration members after she read aloud and
publicly criticized a student's senior seminar
paper while critiquing student writing in
general at a Nov. 9 ESF lecture.
The incident was reported to Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences; Debra Satz, senior associate dean

for the humanities and aits; Harry Elam,
vice provost for undergraduate education
(VPUE); and Martha Cyert, senior associate
for VPUE, according to Dan Edelstein,
associate professor of French and Italian,
who teaches the ESF seminar "Learning for
a Public Life."
"We were uncomfortable with what hap
pened as a matter of professionalism,"
Edelstein said. "We felt that it was our duty
to let people know, people who are in our
chain of command, and so that's what we

did."
According to students who were at the
lecture, Castle used selections from the stu
dent's paper as an example of poor writing
among college students.
"She read aloud one run-on sentence
with inflection in such away that she seemed
to be looking at in a very condescending
manner," Stephen Goodspeed 'l6 said. "She
said that she simply hadn't been taught to
ameliorate this kind of writing
because it was at such a low
level."
Students in the ESF pro
gram are required to attend a
series of four plenary lectures
given by professors from
other universities about liber
al education. After these lec
tures, ESF faculty invite
Stanford professors to com
ment on and moderate discus
sions about the previous
week's lecture.
Castle, along with Joshua
Landy, associate professor of
French and Italian, was invit
ed to respond to a Nov. 2 lec
ture given by Princeton pro
fessor Alexander Nehamas
titled, "I Would Rather
Fashion My Mind Than
Rirnish It."
Castle was only expected
to comment on Nehamas' lec
ture, but instead she also
chose to read aloud a paper
from one of her senior semi
nars and criticize it in front of
the ESF class, commenting
on the difficulty of teaching
students with mediocre wilt
ing skills.
ESF professors did not
anticipate the sudden shift in
the discussion with Castle's
tangent about the decline of
student writing.
"I think perhaps some of
our surprise simply came
from the fact that it there was
no very obvious connection
between her statements and
Nehamas' lecture," Edelstein
said.
After reading aloud from

the paper, Castle made sever
al more general remarks
about how today's college stu
dents lack collegiate-level
writing skills.
"She essentially said that
we as college freshmen aren't
as advanced in rhetoric as stu
dents from 10 years ago,"
Goodspeed said.
Edelstein said that
Castle's statements were
completely unexpected, as the
professors did not ask her to
submit a preview of what she
planned to say beforehand.
"If I knew in advance that
this was her view about stu
dent writing, then I probably
would not have thought it wise
to share that view to the stu
dents in what was also a
[Program in Writing and
Rhetoric] writing seminar,"
Edelstein said.
Writing instructors associ
ated with the ESF seminars
sent emails to students after
the lecture assuring students
