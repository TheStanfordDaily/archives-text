## University Ave. proposal revised City council will consider project after revisions for height concerns 
### SAJ SRI-KUMAR 
After objections forced a reduction in size,
the revised 27 University Avenue project will be
discussed during the Dec. 3 Palo Alto City
Council meeting.
The project, funded by John Arrillaga '6O,
proposes the construction of an "arts and inno
vation district" near the Palo Alto Caltrain sta
tion. After initial concern from the city council,
the new proposal includes a reduced land foot
print as well as a decrease in building height
from 150 feet to just over 100 feet, still exceed-
ing the city's statutory limit of 50
feet.
"The scale of the office buildings
were way too big on the prior propos
al," City Councilman Pat Burt said.
"I still hope that we can reduce the
size."
City Councilman Greg Schmid
declined to take an official stance on
the project until he had finished read
ing the proposal in its entirety, but
said that the project's size would
have a definite impact on the city's
landscape.
"It's a large and massive building
that abuts the downtown," he said.
"It will have a big impact on down
town Palo Alto."
The proposal contains plans to
construct a theater, which will house
the drama group Theatre Works, as
well as office space. In addition, the
plan entails the modernization of the
adjoining transit center and the relo
cation of the Mac Arthur Park build
ing, a World War I-era historic monu
ment designed by Julia Morgan. The
plans also call for a continuous bike
thoroughfare into downtown from
Quarry Road.
While the new proposal will be
discussed in depth at the meeting, a
lengthy process is required before a
final decision can be made. Schmid
said that developers have asked the
council to order a popular referen
dum on the project.
"They want us to prepare a draft
ballot measure, probably for the
June election, to get public approval
for the project," he said, adding that
he believed that the council would

approve the request on Monday.
While the University is not direct
ly involved in the proposal, the land
on which the building complex would
be constructed is owned by Stanford,
but unlike the majority of the cam
pus, lies within the jurisdiction of the
City of Palo Alto. In addition,
Arrillaga has stated his intent to
donate the proceeds of the project to
the University.
Part of the impetus for the project
is the connection of the city's down
town area to the Stanford side of El
Camino Real.
"A project on this site could link
downtown with the Stanford
Shopping Center and hospitals,"
Burt said.
Stanford Director of Community
Relations Jean McCown said that the
University supports the project.
McCown said that the University has
been involved in talks with Palo Alto
for more than a decade to develop the
area and redesign the Caltrain sta
tion, pointing to a 2002 joint study
released by Stanford and Palo Alto.
"The idea is not brand new," she
said.
Schmid said that most of the feed
back that he has received on the pro
posal has been negative, but said this
was to be expected as opposition to
most projects tends to get involved
earlier and be more vocal than sup
port.
Palo Alto resident Martin
Sommer has stalled a Change.org
petition, "Stop the proposed high
rise buildings at 27 University
Avenue," to urge the mayor and the
city council to oppose the project. He
had received 158 supporters as of
Nov. 29.
