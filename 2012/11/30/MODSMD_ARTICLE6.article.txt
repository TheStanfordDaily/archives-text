MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 35, UCLA 24: The last time I took
pen to paper in this section of The Daily, I went out on a
limb in taking the upset-minded Cardinal over then-No.
2 Oregon. There are no congratulations necessary,
because if my pick this week is incorrect, the Ducks'
demise will be a poor consolation for spending New
Year's Eve in Penryn instead of Pasadena. It will be
very tough for Stanford to beat a quality UCLA team
twice in six days. If the Bruins had seemed to roll over
early in last weekend's blowout loss, I would say this
game might be a toss up. But Jim Mora insists he was
trying to win the game, and leaving Brett Hundley in to
get sacked and pummeled and the consistent effort of
the players on the field leads me to think that the talent
gap is too great to be overcome by six days worth of
adjustments. Hogan remains relatively efficient and hits
a couple big plays, Taylor breaks the career rushing
record in style, and for once, Stanford plays the role of
a favorite doing its job. And the Cardinal always covers.

SAM FISHER
STANFORD 27, UCLA 10: From years of
experience as an NFL fan, I've seen how hard it is to
beat a team in the regular season and the playoffs.
Though only six days separate the two contests
between the Cardinal and the Bruins, the atmosphere,
along with the stakes, are drastically different.
Stanford's going to see a different UCLA team out of
the gates, but at the end of the day, I just don't see
Stanford's seniors allowing the team to lose. Chase
Thomas and Shayne Skov lead a Herculean defensive
effort in the rainstorm, dominating the Bruins up front as
Stanford finally gets the conference championship mon
key off its back. See you in Pasadena.

GEORGE CHEN
STANFORD 24, UCLA 1 7: One win stands
between Stanford and its first invitation to the Rose Bowl
since 2000. The seniors have worked too hard to let this
opportunity get away. Even if the Bruins played conserv
atively last weekend, they don't have enough up their
sleeves to take down the Cardinal on its home field.
UCLA is a well-rounded, physical team that deserves to
be in the Pac-12 Championship Game. The problem for
the Bruins is that Stanford is just that much more physi
cal. Both Stanford and UCLA played their most impres
sive wins of the season in the rain, so I don't think the
weather will affect either team. Tonight, Kevin Hogan
stays true to his efficient self and Stepfan Taylor proves
to everyone for good that he was snubbed in the selec
tion of Doak Walker Award finalists. UCLA's time will
come, but this year, the Pac-12 title belongs to the
Cardinal.
