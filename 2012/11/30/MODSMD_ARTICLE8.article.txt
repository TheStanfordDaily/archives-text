## Council limits amplified music in Lytton Plaza 
### GUILLERMO GOMEZ 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
on Monday, Nov. 19, to restrict ampli
fied music at Lytton Plaza, a public
gathering space located next to Pizza
My Heart on the corner of University
Avenue and Emerson Street.

According to a Parks and Recreation
Commission report, the plaza became a
popular place for music performance
and public events after its renovation
in 2009. Some groups played loud,
amplified music because of the free
availability of electrical outlets,
according to the report.
Business leaders conveyed their
concern that this free electricity was
leading people to camp out at the
plaza, creating "an unwelcoming envi
ronment for other visitors," the report
states.

The plaza's popularity has led to
various complaints, with nearby busi
nesses objecting to the loud music
during daylight hours and local resi
dents expressing concern that music
is played too late in the night. The 195
police incident reports filed in 2011
prompted the commission to further
investigate.

The commission first met with
musicians, youth advocates and busi
ness leaders, before submitting to the
city council a list of recommended

measures. After hearing testimony
from community members, including
representatives of the music scene,
business leaders and local residents,
the council voted to accept the com
mission's recommendations with sev
eral changes.
The new regulations restrict the
playing of amplified music in Lytton
Plaza to a "first-come, first-served basis,"
according to the council report, during
set weekly hours. Public playing of
amplified music will be limited to the
hours of 6 to 10 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, noon toll p.m. on Saturday
and noon to 10 p.m. on Sunday.
The commission had proposed a 5
p.m. start time for allowing the public
to play amplified music during week
days.

In addition, groups who play music
in the plaza will only be able to do so
for three hours or less to allow other
musicians to play. If groups want to
reserve the entire plaza, they can pay
for a permit that will cost no more
than $2OO. The commission had rec
ommended that the fee be $9O.
Amplified music during nonstan
dard hours will also be allowed, but a
similar permit must be obtained. The
council stated that in cases of conflict,
city-sponsored events and permitted
groups will have priority over other
events and non-permitted groups.

Acoustic music will not be affected
by the new regulations but will still be
subject to the city's existing sound
limit.
To address the problem created by
open access to electrical outlets, the
city will offer only one outlet for
events. This outlet will be remotely
and automatically controlled but will
not be locked. Total event power con
sumption will be limited to 20 amps,
according to the council report.
Susan Webb, who runs Lytton
Plaza's Friday "jam sessions," voiced
her support for the limits at the Nov.
19 city council meeting.
"In general, I absolutely support

the recommendations that the Parks
and Recreation Department has come
up with for us," she said. "We have
been living under the trial period for
many months now, and it's good."
The trial period for the new sound
regulations started after the proposed
regulations were drafted. Now that
the council has passed the regulations,
the trial period is over.
Josh Afungia, who works at the
Pizza My Heart next to the plaza,
expressed his appreciation of Lytton's
music scene but agreed with the city's
limits. He said that though he likes
live music, the plaza can get loud.
"Sometimes it gets really rowdy,"

he said. He added that the city was
right to crack down on the noise in the
plaza.
"I understand it," he said. "There
are people that do want to sleep. I
agree with cutting the hours down."
The council's report cited surveys
performed by the Community
Services staff in March and April of
this year in support of the new regula
tions. The majority of the 60 people
surveyed in person said that they
agreed with the limitations on ampli
fied music.
