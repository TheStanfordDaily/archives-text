## FLIP explores major selection 
### JANA PERSKY 
In late October, students used the First-
Generation Low-Income Partnership (FLIP) email
chat list to discuss an opinion column in The Daily
("Who Wants a Straight-A Student"). The article
talked about approaching academics with a focus on
following your passions, at the expense of GPA and
practicality.
Based on the online debate, FLIP decided to host
a panel discussion about financial considerations
involved in selecting a major, especially as they apply
to low-income students.
This issue is part of a broader national trend
among first-generation and low-income college stu
dents, as expanded financial aid has increased socioe
conomic diversity in higher education.
Stanford professor of psychology Hazel Markus
recently published a study examining the challenges
first-generation and low-income students face at elite
universities, including Stanford. According to
Markus, the main challenge is navigating the exten
sive choices that universities offer.
"The problem is that it's hard to make a choice if
you really don't understand why you should major in
a certain field, what it could lead to and what careers
it could be related to," Markus said. "That's particu
larly true for many first-generation students."
The concern about careers is often based on finan
cial realities.
"First-gen and low-income students have to think
a lot about the money associated with certain careers
that comes from certain majors," said FLIP co-pres
ident Omar Medina 'l3. "If you're thinking about sup
porting your family or maybe becoming the primary
breadwinner, it limits you to certain majors, especial
ly based on what people think about which majors
lead to which careers."
Erne Williams-Blake 'l3, who served on FLIP's
November panel, said that her parents pushed her to
study science because most of the highest-paying
jobs in her home country of Trinidad and Tobago are
in the sciences.
"I don't feel strongly about switching to the
humanities," Williams-Blake, a civil and environmen
tal engineering major, said. "But even if I did, [sci
ence] is what is realistic for me to do to support my
family."
Other students found different ways to reconcile
the concerns between practicality and passions.
Aracely Mondragon 'l3 said that she made the dif
ficult decision to change from a pre-medieine track to
comparative studies in race and ethnicity once she
discovered she was more passionate about serving
her community than studying medicine. She is now
focused on Latina empowerment through writing.
"I feel like it's really important to think about
what your own vision of bettering yourself is,"
Mondragon said. "It's not strictly just upward mobil
ity financially speaking there's other ways to real
ly create this better life for yourself."
Stephanie Liou 'l3, who is majoring in science,
technology and society, decided to separate her per
sonal hobbies from her career.
"It doesn't mean that you can't be an artist or a
writer or really passionate about Russian literature
or whatever it is," Liou said. "But it's just that you
simply don't have the luxury of devoting all of your
time to that and crossing your fingers, hoping that a
job comes that way."
Undergraduate Advising and Research Academic
Director Cari Costanzo Kapur M.A. '99 Ph.D. 'O5,
who moderated the panel and was herself a first-gen
eration and low-income student, dispelled some of the
concerns around job security. She said there is often
a misconception that it is easier to have a secure job
and earn money in math and science tracks, but in
reality, those career choices aren't always safer or
more lucrative than others.
Kapur feels that these misconceptions often lead
students to unnecessarily close the door on opportu
nities in other fields.
"There is a lot that can be gained from the social
sciences and the humanities as well," Kapur said.
"There is something quite valuable to be gained from
that type of coursework that is extremely applicable
in the world, whatever career one chooses."
For FLII] the panel was part of an ongoing effort
to address the challenges in choosing a major as well
as raising awareness of the larger issues first-gener
ation and low-income students face on campus.
"Part of the reason I wanted to
bring up this discussion is that I
don't think that there is much
being done," Liou said. "Some
things like race and religion are
more visible just because you can
tell, but class is something that tra
ditionally in America we don't talk
about and there aren't venues to
talk about it."
"There's this perception on
campus that no one is actually
poor," Williams-Blake said.
"Somebody would say I'm not
going to this concert that cost $5
because I'm broke, and you would
hear everyone say, 'You don't have
$5? What's ss?' [People] don't rec
ognize that there are people that
legitimately don't have [it]."
Williams-Blake said that
notwithstanding FLIP's efforts,
the conversation doesn't always
reach a broad audience.

"We can try to generate discus
sion, but it's hard to get people who
don't really care that much to come
out and get involved," Williams-
Blake said. "The people who come
are the people who feel affected by
it."
Williams-Blake noted that at
campus diversity events such as
Faces of Community, there is little
discussion of socioeconomic diver
sity.
Despite the difficulty in
addressing first-generation and
low-income concerns among the
broader community, Stanford has
been expanding its support for
these students. The Office of
First-Gen and Diversity
Programs, led by Dean Tommy
Woon, was established in April
2011. According to Woon, the goal
of this office is to provide accessi
ble opportunities for students to
be supported by other students,
faculty and staff.
"We're starting to build net
works," Woon said. "We have a list
of 140 faculty and 120 staff mem
bers who have all expressed interest

in first-gen students, and we are
starting to hold [events]."
For the first time this summer,
the Leland Scholars Program, a
three-week academic summer
bridge opportunity, was offered to
incoming freshmen. The Student
Affaii-s website says the goal was
"to support those who come from
under-resourced high schools and
want early exposure to studying the
sciences."
As the University works to cre
ate and sustain supportive pro
gramming, Markus said that
increased dialogue would have a
positive impact on the greater
Stanford community because it
would increase awareness of the
diverse Stanford culture.
"We often try to imagine that the
good thing to do is to be color-blind,
culture-blind, gender-blind and
class-blind, but being blind won't
help us," Markus said. "We have to
think about differences and how the
differences make a difference."
