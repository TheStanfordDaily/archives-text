Hey. Let me start off by say
ing how much I love you. Like,
obsessed. I come from the relent
lessly-tropical Singapore one
degree north of the equator
and so you are to me what
Facebook is to a never-ending
Thinking Matters discussion:
blissful relief. I mean, even Katy
Perry sang about you and your
greener grass, and she only sings
truth.
But it seems like our honey
moon period might well be over.
I won't mince my words: I didn't
fly halfway across the world for
gray skies, halfhearted down
pours and soggy shoegazing
pedestrians. 1 would've gone to
school on the east coast if I'd
wanted that.
What happened, honey?
One moment you were all crisp
blue skies and delightful balmy
weather and cool evenings, and
then you suddenly flipped and
freaked. I suppose what this
means is that you've got a really
brilliant PR team I wasn't told
about the possibility of this hap
pening when I signed on the
dotted line and said yes to
Stanford. I'm not prepared to
deal with this. It's like that feeling
of crushing disappointment you
get when you head out to Late
Nite only to find that it is closed.
Or when you get back to your
room after an impossible day
only to find The Sock on your
doorknob again. Or when you
register for a class because you
read on Courseßank that the TA
is gorgeous and French and gives
everyone A's, only to find out
that he really is a creepy grad
student who only gives you an A
if you are willing to go to his "office
hours" from 8-10 p.m. every Saturday at Rains.
You get the point. In this past week alone I have skipped three lectures, witnessed four bike accidents and been
wet and miserable every single day. I have also caught a cold, and I can tell you from personal experience that having
both mucus and rain dribbling down your chin while you are cycling is not the most glamorous or practical of looks.
When I said I wanted to get into the festive spirit, I did not quite mean looking like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
But the awkwardness of sitting through econ lecture in wet jeans is a stroll in the (flooded) park compared to the
hot shame of having your Stanford weather brag busted. My friend from Georgetown came over to visit last weekend,
and of course it had to rain the entire time he was here. Suddenly all the times I guffawed to him, "Wait, it's cold and
gray over there now? I just had a picnic outside," didn't seem quite so clever after all. The look of saltiness on his face is
not one I will forget any time soon, and my damaged dignity has not since been restored. The only thing damper than
my spirits is Wilbur Field.
I guess I have what they call seasonal affective disorder. Evidently whoever coined this term is a sick bastard,
because it spells out "sad" in acronym. According to Wikipedia, one in four Londoners is affected by it. You'd think
that's a high number of people, but judging by how erratically everyone has been careening across White Plaza on
their bikes these past two weeks, I'd guess nine in 10 Stanford students have SAD, with the other one simply normal
ized to rarely seeing the sunlight.
So, dear Weather, while I love you, please get your shit together.
