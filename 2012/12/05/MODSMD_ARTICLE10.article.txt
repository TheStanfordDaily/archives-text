# A 						guide to the six community centers
## 
### 
Asian American Activities Center (A3C)
Although the A3C is one of the older centers, cre
ated in 1972, its history stretches as far back as
1917 and 1919 when the Japanese and Chinese
Clubhouses were created as dormitories in
response to the racism Asian students faced in
regular dorms.

Black Community Services Center (BCSC)
Established in 1969, the BCSC â€”then called the
Black Student Volunteer Center was the first
community center established at Stanford. It has
deep roots in the civil rights movement, and stu
dents involved with the center have historically been
heavily engaged in activism on and off campus.

El Centra Chicano El Centra, founded in 1977,
is known for its special focus on bridging the gap
between undergraduate and graduate students. In
large part, this is because the Center shared space
with the Chicano Fellows program which sup
ported Chicano graduate students at the time of
its founding.

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender
Community Resource Center (LGBT-CRC)
The LGBT-CRC began in 1972 as the Gay People's
Union, but switched to its current name in 1999 to
be more inclusive to community members of differ
ent identities. "The list [of identities] gets longer
and longer all the time," said Benjamin Davidson,
director of the center. The current name beat out
the name "Queer Center."

Native American Cultural Center (NACC)
Even before the NACC opened in 1974, the stu
dents involved in its founding succeeded in con
vincing then-President Richard Lyman and the
Stanford community to abandon the "Stanford
Indian" as the University's mascot in 1972.

Women's Community Center (WCC)
Housed at the Old Firehouse since 1991, the WCC's
origins extend to the Women's Collective, an organ
ization founded in 1972 which originally met in
the Toyon eating clubs.
