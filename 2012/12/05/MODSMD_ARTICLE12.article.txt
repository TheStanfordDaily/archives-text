## OP-ED Rights of an unborn fetus 
### 
Does human life begin at con
ception? And is that suffi
cient to extend the right to
life from that moment on? Adam
Johnson's column last week argued for
this case, but the issues here are more
complex than a simple yes or no.

Is a fetus just after conception
an example of human life?
If we are using the term "human
life" in its strictly biological sense,
then any assembly of cells with
human DNA would be an example
of human life. A fetus would qualify.
But so would HeLa, a strain of cer
vical cancer cells sourced from
Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta "died"
from cancer in 1951. If the presence
of living human cells is the neces
sary and sufficient definition of a
continuing human life, then
Henrietta did not "really" die in
1951.

It is clear that such a definition
of a human, while useful to biolo
gists, is not applicable in the
domain of law and ethics where the
discussion of rights is properly sit
uated. To give another example, a
brain-dead person is considered
"dead" even though the majority of
her organs or cells may still be alive
and may be kept alive indefinitely
into the future.

Many ethicists have argued that
the language of rights can only be
applied to organisms with adequate
levels of consciousness, volition and
intentions. A fetus less than two
months old does not have any brain
structures that can sustain even
minimally conscious or unconscious
neural activity. Such a fetus is not a
human being in the morally rele
vant sense of the term.
But not so fast...
A person sympathetic to the
pro-life viewpoint might argue that
the reason a post-conception
embryo is different from all other
clumps of cells is that this collection
of cells represents the first stage in
a developmental process that
results in a "morally relevant"
human being to whom the language
of rights and responsibilities may
be coherently applied. Thus we can
not hope to confer any protective
rights to human beings without
conferring some rights to the

developing entity on which their
very existence initially depends. A
fetus is therefore a necessary exis
tence condition for a human per
son. Surely that fetus needs to be
protected for the right to life to
operate in the social realm?

It is here that we arrive at the
great divide: Which things acquire
protected status when the right to
life is conferred upon human per
sons?

Two theories about the right to
life

1) Pro-choice advocates define
the right to life as a protecting per
sistence condition only. If a
"morally relevant" human being is
already present, then a persist
ence-defined right to life protects
all things necessary for that being
to continue to exist. Simple
examples include access rights to
food, water and medicine, among
others. Conditions necessary for
existence of future persons,
according to this view, are not pro
tected de facto. They might be pro
tected to a limited extent if current
persons hold future persons as
being valuable for enhancing their
own life purposes. In this sense, a
"wanted" fetus enjoys the same
kind of right as, for instance,
national treasures like the "Statue
of Liberty" may enjoy in the
United States. If that "wanted
ness" is lost, so go all rights.
2) A secular pro-life advocate
defines the right to life to cover all
necessary existence and persist
ence conditionsfor human per
sons. So as far as knowledge allows,
entities and resources necessary
for the coming-into-existence of
persons are protected as well.
Using a campfire analogy for this
viewpoint, to protect the rights of a
fully burning stage of a human life,
the kindling stage of life also needs
to be protected and tended to, even
though it is still not "fire."

It is difficult to advocate one
view over the other, and the rights
of women to choose also matter in
this debate. But if this article
encourages you to think more on
the topic, my job is done.
