# Why Stanford must divest from fossil fuels
## 
### ADAM PEARSON '12 M.S. '13, SOPHIE HARRISON '16, GRAHAM PROVOST '13 
T there was more commotion
than usual in White Plaza on
Tuesday. Yesterday, a student
movement rallied to President
Hennessy's office to promote the
transparent phase-out of all fossil
fuel investments in Stanford's
endowment. As a trailblazing inno
vator in technology and research,
and as an educator of the world's
next generation of leaders, it is
critical that Stanford set an exam
ple by withdrawing its support for
an industry that is crippling our
planet.
Climate change is accelerating
at an alarming rate, and the longer
we delay aggressive emissions
reductions, the more catastrophic its
impacts will become. Climate change
has rapidly become one of the fore
most environmental and social jus
tice issues of our time, and it is
imperative, for our sake and for the
sake of future generations around
the world, that we take immediate
action to address this crisis.

But Stanford already has an
impressive set of "green" initia
tives, right? True. The evidence is
all around us, from the composting
programs in dining halls to the
LEED Platinum buildings at the
new Graduate School of Business.
Stanford University has tradition
ally performed well on college
"sustainability report cards" from
various organizations.
Yet Stanford always underper
forms in the endowment trans
parency category. While it may be
understandable for our fund man
agers not to reveal their entire
investment strategy, Stanford also
has an obligation not to undermine
the futures of its own students and
graduates. In light of the cata
strophic economic and human
damage caused by recent extreme
climate events, it is time for some
transparency and responsibility
Announcing a withdrawal from
fossil fuel investments would not
jeopardize the long-term success
of any well-built portfolio. It would

affirm that we practice what we
preach, and that our educations
will not come at the expense of the
world in which we plan to use
them.

We therefore call on Stanford
to immediately freeze any new
investment in fossil fuel companies,
and to divest within five years from
direct ownership of fossil fuel com
panies and from any commingled
funds that include fossil fuel public
equities and corporate bonds.

We are not alone in our vision.
At more than a hundred schools
across the country, students with
similar rallying cries are insisting
that universities, as bastions of
intellectual discourse and breed
ing grounds for new ideas, jump on
board and say enough is enough.
Fossil fuel companies have a stran
glehold on the American and glob
al economic systems; armed with
billions of dollars and hordes of
lobbyists, they can easily brush off
political opposition. But if there's
any place where something can
start small and transform our
lives, it's at Stanford (see Google
and Hewlett-Packard, among
many others).
Over the next three years,
Stanford will spend $440 million to
implement the Stanford Energy
System Innovation's new heat
recovery system, which is project
ed to cut campus greenhouse gas
emissions by 50 percent. That is a
significant investment (with a pos
itive payback), intended primarily
to cut emissions.
Stanford and the Board of
Trustees get it. They want to do
the right thing. We're optimistic
that the Board will continue to
lead Stanford into the future as a
role model in sustainable invest
ment, and we invite you to join the
movement to call on the school we
love to divest from fossil fuels.
