# We are all smart enough
## 
### Emily Cohodes 
While I was cleaning my
room recently, I came
across a piece of paper
from three years ago that has
shaped my academic trajectory at
Stanford. I'm not even sure why I
kept it in my stack of random keep
sakes, but I'm glad I did.

It was 11:50 a.m. and the stu
dents of Chem 31A were lined up
with then- respective TAs, waiting to
get our first midterms back. When I
reached the front of the line, I said
my name. My TA reached to the bot
tom of the pile with a sad look in his
eye and handed me a single sheet of
paper. It wasn't the midterm. It was
a letter that said something along
the lines of: "Dear student, you have
clearly had difficulty with this
midterm and you must meet with
the professor before getting your
test back."

I felt a knot growing in my stom
ach. It was just a few weeks into my
freshman year and this was the first
time I'd ever received any notice of
this sort. I wasn't used to failing
tests and certainly wasn't used to
getting such a low score on a test
that I was required to receive it in a
protected setting.
That afternoon, I waited in line to
get my test back. There were about
50 students waiting in line, and we
glanced around at each other nerv
ously as we waited to see the extent
of our misfortune. My turn to meet
with the professor came, and I
entered his office.

"Well, Emily," he said, "It looks
like you straggled a bit on this exam.
What happened?" I explained that I
had, in fact, studied quite a lot for
that test, attended all of the lectures,
done all of the reading and spent my
fair share of time in office hours.

Chemistry didn't come naturally to
me, I explained, but I wanted to work
at it.

"If you've been working hard and
you're still only able to get this score,
you might just not be cut out for this
class."

"Is there anything I can do to
improve? To learn the material bet
ter?"

"I just don't know if you're smart
enough if you're already trying hard,"
he said.

Looking back at the letter that
preceded this retrospectively comi
cal exchange with a professor I
would never see again, I am disgust
ed. I am smart enough to pass any
class at Stanford.

As a freshman on that gray
October afternoon, I sadly let myself
be swayed by the words of a professor
so caught up in the specifics of his own
field that he couldn't see past an exam
and consider me as a whole person
nor see that my intelligence isn't sim
ply defined by my ability to reason
through chemistry problems under
pressure. I let him shatter my confi

dence with a few flippant words that
were probably spoken to many others
who waited in line that day.
Because I ended up dropping
chemistry that quarter, I took Psych
1 and fell in love with the field in
which I now aspire to have a career.
I am thankful that that professor
helped redirect my career path.
I am not thankful, however, for
his extreme lack of consideration of
the weight that those words have
had on my academic career. Simply
getting into Stanford is proof of our
academic abilities and smarts, and
we should never be told that we're
not good enough, but rather what we
can do to improve. I shy away from
the fuzzy/techie description for this
very reason â€”we may apply our
selves differently once coming to col
lege and naturally branch off as we
become interested in different fields
and issues, but we are not branching
off into a hierarchy of intelligence.
If we are trying hard, taking
advantage of the resources available
to us and still failing in some course,
it's simply a sign that the course isn't
being taught well. Chem 31A, which
is a gateway to the premed track and
many careers, should be extremely
accessible to students so that stu
dents' potential career paths aren't
shut down by professors' extreme
lack of care. Maybe I should have
responded, If I'm trying as hard
as I can and not doing well in
this class, you may not be cut.
out for teaching it.

I'm taking a break from mental
health topics this week and will be
back with more at the beginning of
next quarter! Any topics you'd like to
see discussed? E-mail me at eco
hodes@stanforcL edu.

If I'm trying as
hard as I can and
not doing well in
this class, you may
not be cut out for
teaching it.
