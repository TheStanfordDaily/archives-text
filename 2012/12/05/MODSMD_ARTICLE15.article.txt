# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Santa for grown-ups 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Growing up I had plenty of
heroes, but three in particu
lar stand out. Ariel from
"The Little Mermaid," because she
could breathe underwater, which is
very impressive to a four-year-old.
Laura Ingalls Wilder of "Little
House on the Prairie," because she
got to live on the frontier.
Tumbleweeds? Covered wagons? I
was sold.

The big guy, though, was Santa
Claus.

Santa was and continues to be
very dear to me. I jumped into the
fairy tale full bore and quickly
began to add my own adaptations.
Beyond bringing me presents from
Toys"R"Us, I was certain that if I
wished hard enough, Santa would
grant me my very own magic pow
ers. I would lie awake at night and
say the prayers they taught us in
Catholic school, substituting "Dear
Santa" for "Dear Jesus." I modified
the "Our Father" with requests for
flying powers or the simple wish to
have a really long ponytail that
swished when I walked, because
that seemed like a superpower in
second grade. I was a little con
fused on the point of prayer, and I
may have conflated the many men
with beards in Western lore, but
nonetheless I was a committed
believer.

I put my parents in a sticky
position, because they had to deliv
er more than gifts; they had to
deliver magic. One year I asked for
a magic kit to make me fly and turn
invisible. Another year I asked for
Hawaii. And another, for nine feet
of snow in San Francisco. Besides
the wish lists, my sister and I
refused to sleep in our bedrooms on

Christmas Eve. Instead, we sta
tioned ourselves in front of the fire
place in the living room where the
Christmas tree stood.
I still don't know what kind of
magic they used, but every year
when I woke up there were pres
ents beneath the tree and an ash
footprint of an Ugg boot roughly
my Dad's size on the hearth, right
near our sleeping heads. The year I
asked for snow in SF, I woke up to
a snow globe with a photograph of
nine feet, as in the shoe-and-sock
wearing variety, inside. The Hawaii
year I got a Tupperware filled with
sand. Neither of these were let
downs quite the contrary. I was
awed and delighted that Santa
managed to pull it off, and it
seemed all the more plausible to me
that someday I too would be able to
fly, and that I would join him in the
North Pole and we would drink hot
chocolate and reminisce about old
times.

The most magical part about
Christmas was that Santa respond
ed to my letters every year. I have
since asked my parents how long it
took them to write out the elabo
rate cursive script, but it turns out

it wasn't them writing the letters.
We still don't know who it was, but
some mystery individual at the San
Francisco Post Office made the
dream that much more real. I can't
think of a more committed form of
altruism.
I believed in Santa for a bit too
long. Even when I did find out, I
tried to find ways around the truth.
OK, I told myself, maybe Santa
isn't a fat man in the North Pole
who rides a flying sled pulled by
reindeer, but he can still be my
Fijian uncle, one of the most gener
ous people I know. Or the postman
who comes at 3:00 each afternoon
who has a mischievous air about
him. Or maybe my cat was Santa. I
wasn't about to let the magic go.
For someone who believed that
strongly in the fairy tale, you might
imagine the world crashing down
when the fairy tale ended, but I
don't remember a moment when
the world did crash down.

Instead of losing Santa, I just
transferred him into other parts of
the world. I still believe in magic,
obviously. And as corny as it is, I
still believe in Santa. Not in the
sense of Christmas cheer and all
that jazz, but in the feeling of a
presence that is so wonderful and
big, who understands that kids
have it more figured out than
grown-ups. So in the midst of finals,
and the rain, and the emotional tur
moil that is being 18 to 22 years old,
I wanted to remind you that magic
is real, and that Santa is around to
help you out.

van@stanford.edu. Like Santa,
she'll write back.

Another year I
asked for Hawaii.
And another, for
nine feet of snow.
