## University monitors Lake Lagunita after fall storms 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Weekend storms have begun what
may be a wet year for Lake Lagunita,
according to Associate Director of
Water Services and Civil
Infrastructure Tom Zigterman.
Zigterman said that the U.S.
Geological Survey gauge on San
Fransiquito Creek, located just off of
the Dish at Alpine and Junipero Serra,
recorded water flow at a speed of 3,000
cubic feet per second. The flow at that
gauge is normally just hundreds of feet
per second. The Land Use and
Environmental Planning Department
is working to collect data on the depth
of Lake Lagunita after the storms.
"We have a series of storms going
â€”we have another one coming in
[Wednesday] night," Zigterman said.
"So we'll be keeping an eye on it over
the next few weeks to see if the storms
are regularly spaced and continue to
come, or if [Lake Lagunita] starts dry
ing out and [we] need to go to supple
mental supply."
Created in the 1870s as an irriga
tion reservoir for the Palo Alto Stock
Farm, Stanford no longer fills Lake
Lagunita for student life activities.
Although it previously diverted water
to the lake for recreational purposes,
including University-sponsored physi
cal education classes like windsurfing
and sailing, since 2001 the University
has filled the lake exclusively to sup
port the well-being of the California
tiger salamander population.
"The reason we don't fill Lagunita
is a water supply and water manage
ment issue," Zigterman said.
According to Zigterman, Lake
Lagunita loses an estimated 500 gal
lons a minute to percolation at its peak
height. With a daily cap on campus
water use at 3.033 million gallons a day,
this rate would represent more than 20
percent of the University's permitted
water allocation.

Because of this rapid percolation
rate, filling and maintaining Lake
Lagunita necessitates diversion from
the nearby San Francisquito Creek.
Without water supplementation, either
naturally by rainfall or through
University efforts, Lake Lagunita
dries within a month.

Zigterman said that the increase in
landscaping and athletic fields on cam
pus in the last 15 years has made filling
Lake Lagunita into an unreasonable
allocation of water.

"As that irrigation demand has
grown ... we try to conserve our water
supply for irrigation rather than put
ting water into Lagunita," he said.
According to the HCP Report, the
University measures the depth of Lake
Lagunita each year on Jan. 15. For
Stanford to divert enough water to the
lake for the water to be five feet deep,
three conditions must be met: The
water must be naturally deeper than
three feet, diversion must be consid
ered critical for local persistence of the
California tiger salamander and San
Fransquito Creek must have enough
water to support the diversion efforts.
Diversion, if it occurs, lasts until
late May when the lake is allowed to
gradually dry. In the years when all
three conditions are met, the
University uses water from Stanford's

five wells to supplement the water
level.
Zigterman said that previous
attempts to lessen the drainage rate
out of the lake have been unsuccessful.
He also said that the ground water
recharge that results from percolation
is considered an environmental benefit
and that the current situation is best
for the local species.
"The driver for not doing some
thing like that would be the disruption
to the habitat of the salamander,"
Zigterman said.

The California tiger salamander
The California tiger salamanders,
first spotted at Stanford in 1900, live in
the grassland and foothills surround
ing Lagunita and migrate to the lake to
breed. The population that resides and
reproduces on the Stanford campus is
believed to be the only surviving popu
lation on the San Francisco Peninsula
and was deemed "vulnerable" by the
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

Research has shown that the sala
mander population suffers from high
mortality due to hybridization, traffic
mortality during migration from the
foothills and competition with non
native salamander species, although
the HCP Report said "it is unclear
whether the population is declining or
remaining steady."
In order to reproduce, the salaman
ders require at least a foot of water
that lasts into the spring to allow for
the metamorphosis of their larva,
according to the HCP Report. Since an
individual salamander survives, on
average, for more than a decade, the
University is not required to maintain
a breeding habitat for the salamander
every year if it determines diversion to
be too costly.
"I would say at least half the win
ters we do some supplemental divert
ing to Lagunita for the salamanders,"
Zigterman said.
By 2009, Stanford had constructed
11 experimental ponds and wetlands
south of Junipero Serra "to provide
supplemental breeding locations for
California tiger salamanders, reduce
the reliance of the local population on
Lagunita and extend their effective
range farther into the foothills."
However, as of 2009, the salaman
ders had only reproduced in three of
those ponds, according to the HCP
Report.
"Achieving] California tiger sala
mander reproductive success in no less
than 75 percent of the ponds" was list
ed as one of Stanford's conservation
objectives.
Despite efforts to reduce reliance
on Lagunita as a breeding ground for
the salamander, Stanford does not plan
to totally relocate the salamanders in
the near future, according to Director
of Land Use and Enviromental
Planning Charles Carter.
"We commit[ted] to maintaining
Lagunita for 50 years, so it's not within
our lifetime our objective to get rid of
Lagunita," Carter said. "[But] should
the time come Lagunita can't retain
water, there will be alternative breed
ing sites [for the salamander]."

The recent fall storms partially filled Lake Lag over the weekend. The University
is considering the effect of the lake's depth on the local salamanders.
