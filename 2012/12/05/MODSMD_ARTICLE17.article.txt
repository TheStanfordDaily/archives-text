## END OF AN ERA 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The parallels were there. After a
hard-fought match on a wet field,
Stanford, wearing black, needed a
missed kick to help defeat its baby
blue rivals. But while the football
team booked a ticket to the Rose
Bowl after a late field goal miss from
UCLA, the women's soccer team's
season ended Friday night when
North Carolina's Kealia Ohai scored
in the 104 th minute to give the Tar
Heels a 1-0 win.

The No. 1 Cardinal (21-2-1), the
defending national champion, came
out with a vengeance against the No.
13 Tar Heels, a team it had never
beaten in 11 tries. Although neither
team scored in regular time, it was
not for lack of trying.
In the 13th minute, senior cap
tain Mariah Nogueira produced a

rocket header from a Stanford cor
ner kick, but the Tar Heels cleared
the ball off the goal line. In the 26th
minute, sophomore Chioma Übogagu
beat four UNC defenders and
stroked a shot that went just wide.

The Tar Heels had chances as
well in a first half that was played at
a track-meet pace. The Cardinal
defense, led by recently named Ail-
Americans seniors Rachel Quon and
Alina Garciamendez, did well to
keep the game scoreless going into
halftime.

The second half was more of the
same. Two minutes after intermis
sion, a free kick from Garciamendez
skidded through the Tar Heels
defense, but Übogagu couldn't get a
full foot on the shot.

Two minutes later, it was sopho
more Lo'eau Laßonta with the
opportunity. After UNC cleared a
corner kick, Stanford senior
Madeleine Thompson sent a long
ball back in. Laßonta snuck behind
the UNC defense, but her chip
attempt went just over the crossbar.

"That first one where I won on
the second ball, that keeper she had,

probably had one of the saves of her
lives that was very frustrating,"
Laßonta said. "And then I had a cou
ple of others that I should have put
away."

Both teams continued to attack
with speed but struggled to execute
the final play. Both coaches also sub
stituted frequently to keep up with
the breakneck pace. At one point in

the second half, the Tar Heels had

six starters off the field, but
Stanford was unable to capitalize.
Goalkeeper Emily Oliver had a
huge game for the Cardinal, collect
ing 10 saves on the day. The Tar
Heels had opportunities from every
where, but the junior handled every
thing cleanly no small feat as con
