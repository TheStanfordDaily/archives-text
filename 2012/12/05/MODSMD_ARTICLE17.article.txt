## END OF AN ERA 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The parallels were there. After a
hard-fought match on a wet field,
Stanford, wearing black, needed a
missed kick to help defeat its baby
blue rivals. But while the football
team booked a ticket to the Rose
Bowl after a late field goal miss from
UCLA, the women's soccer team's
season ended Friday night when
North Carolina's Kealia Ohai scored
in the 104 th minute to give the Tar
Heels a 1-0 win.

The No. 1 Cardinal (21-2-1), the
defending national champion, came
out with a vengeance against the No.
13 Tar Heels, a team it had never
beaten in 11 tries. Although neither
team scored in regular time, it was
not for lack of trying.
In the 13th minute, senior cap
tain Mariah Nogueira produced a

rocket header from a Stanford cor
ner kick, but the Tar Heels cleared
the ball off the goal line. In the 26th
minute, sophomore Chioma Übogagu
beat four UNC defenders and
stroked a shot that went just wide.

The Tar Heels had chances as
well in a first half that was played at
a track-meet pace. The Cardinal
defense, led by recently named Ail-
Americans seniors Rachel Quon and
Alina Garciamendez, did well to
keep the game scoreless going into
halftime.

The second half was more of the
same. Two minutes after intermis
sion, a free kick from Garciamendez
skidded through the Tar Heels
defense, but Übogagu couldn't get a
full foot on the shot.

Two minutes later, it was sopho
more Lo'eau Laßonta with the
opportunity. After UNC cleared a
corner kick, Stanford senior
Madeleine Thompson sent a long
ball back in. Laßonta snuck behind
the UNC defense, but her chip
attempt went just over the crossbar.

"That first one where I won on
the second ball, that keeper she had,

probably had one of the saves of her
lives that was very frustrating,"
Laßonta said. "And then I had a cou
ple of others that I should have put
away."

Both teams continued to attack
with speed but struggled to execute
the final play. Both coaches also sub
stituted frequently to keep up with
the breakneck pace. At one point in

the second half, the Tar Heels had

six starters off the field, but
Stanford was unable to capitalize.
Goalkeeper Emily Oliver had a
huge game for the Cardinal, collect
ing 10 saves on the day. The Tar
Heels had opportunities from every
where, but the junior handled every
thing cleanly no small feat as con

tions.
"I was trying to just do
my part," Oliver said. "That
said, I think our back line was
solid. Everyone left their
heart out on the field tonight,
and I'm really proud of our
team."

Stanford junior Sydney
Payne had two great looks at
goal inside the final 10 min
utes. With eight minutes left,
Übogagu's dribbling set up
Payne just inside the corner
of the penalty box. The for
ward's shot bent towards the
far corner but wasn't fast
enough to beat UNC goal
keeper Adelaide Gay.
Seconds later, Payne had
another opportunity from the
same spot. While this shot
had enough power behind it,
it skidded just past the far
post.

After North Carolina
cleared a last-gasp Cardinal
free kick, the game headed
into sudden-death overtime.

Halfway through the first
of two 10-minute overtimes,
Tar Heels junior Crystal
Dunn broke down the
Cardinal defense and laid a
pass back to midfielder
Amber Brooks. The senior
fired a missile that appeared
locked on to the back of the
net, but Oliver made a
tremendous dive to deflect
the ball over the crossbar.
Toward the end of the
first overtime, North
Carolina increased the pres
sure. That continued through
the brief intermission as sec
onds into the second over
time, Ohai had a breakaway
opportunity down the right
side. Oliver knocked down
the first shot and the
Cardinal defense cleared the

rebound.
Unfortunately for
Stanford, it could only rely
on Oliver's heroics for so
long.

With six minutes remain
ing before penalty kicks, it
was Dunn and Ohai again
leading the attack. Dunn
slipped a clever pass behind
the Cardinal defense, and
this time, Ohai didn't miss.
The senior Ail-American
calmly placed her shot inside
the far post to put the Tar
Heels into the national cham
pionship game and send the
Cardinal back to Palo Alto.

"It was a disappointing
end to a great year," said
Stanford head coach Paul
Rateliffe. "It's always diffi
cult to lose in overtime
because you can't make any
changes or do anything to get
back into the game because
the game is over with one
kick of the ball."

Redshirt junior Courtney
Verloo, who will return next
year for her final year of eli
gibility, gave credit to North
Carolina for their high-pres
sure attack.
"I think we battled back
just as strong and gave
everything that we had,"
Yerloo said. "It was unfortu
nate that we couldn't come
out with the result tonight."

Stanford ends the season
with a 21-2-1 record and the
Pac-12 championship. The
team's 10 seniors end then
four years with a 94-4-4
record, four Pac-10/12 cham
pionships, four Final Four
appearances and the 2011
national championship.
"When you look at their
overall record, through then
four years, it's pretty
remarkable," Ratcliffe said.
"I'm really thankful that they
won the championship last
year, because they're defi
nitely champions. No doubt
in my mind."

The parallels were there. After a
hard-fought match on a wet field,
Stanford, wearing black, needed a
missed kick to help defeat its baby
blue rivals. But while the football
team booked a ticket to the Rose
Bowl after a late field goal miss from
UCLA, the women's soccer team's
season ended Friday night when
North Carolina's Kealia Ohai scored
in the 104 th minute to give the Tar
Heels a 1-0 win.

The No. 1 Cardinal (21-2-1), the
defending national champion, came
out with a vengeance against the No.
13 Tar Heels, a team it had never
beaten in 11 tries. Although neither
team scored in regular time, it was
not for lack of trying.
In the 13th minute, senior cap
tain Mariah Nogueira produced a

rocket header from a Stanford cor
ner kick, but the Tar Heels cleared
the ball off the goal line. In the 26th
minute, sophomore Chioma Übogagu
beat four UNC defenders and
stroked a shot that went just wide.

The Tar Heels had chances as
well in a first half that was played at
a track-meet pace. The Cardinal
defense, led by recently named Ail-
Americans seniors Rachel Quon and
Alina Garciamendez, did well to
keep the game scoreless going into
halftime.

The second half was more of the
same. Two minutes after intermis
sion, a free kick from Garciamendez
skidded through the Tar Heels
defense, but Übogagu couldn't get a
full foot on the shot.

Two minutes later, it was sopho
more Lo'eau Laßonta with the
opportunity. After UNC cleared a
corner kick, Stanford senior
Madeleine Thompson sent a long
ball back in. Laßonta snuck behind
the UNC defense, but her chip
attempt went just over the crossbar.

"That first one where I won on
the second ball, that keeper she had,

probably had one of the saves of her
lives that was very frustrating,"
Laßonta said. "And then I had a cou
ple of others that I should have put
away."

Both teams continued to attack
with speed but struggled to execute
the final play. Both coaches also sub
stituted frequently to keep up with
the breakneck pace. At one point in

the second half, the Tar Heels had

six starters off the field, but
Stanford was unable to capitalize.
Goalkeeper Emily Oliver had a
huge game for the Cardinal, collect
ing 10 saves on the day. The Tar
Heels had opportunities from every
where, but the junior handled every
thing cleanly no small feat as con

tions.
"I was trying to just do
my part," Oliver said. "That
said, I think our back line was
solid. Everyone left their
heart out on the field tonight,
and I'm really proud of our
team."

Stanford junior Sydney
Payne had two great looks at
goal inside the final 10 min
utes. With eight minutes left,
Übogagu's dribbling set up
Payne just inside the corner
of the penalty box. The for
ward's shot bent towards the
far corner but wasn't fast
enough to beat UNC goal
keeper Adelaide Gay.
Seconds later, Payne had
another opportunity from the
same spot. While this shot
had enough power behind it,
it skidded just past the far
post.

After North Carolina
cleared a last-gasp Cardinal
free kick, the game headed
into sudden-death overtime.

Halfway through the first
of two 10-minute overtimes,
Tar Heels junior Crystal
Dunn broke down the
Cardinal defense and laid a
pass back to midfielder
Amber Brooks. The senior
fired a missile that appeared
locked on to the back of the
net, but Oliver made a
tremendous dive to deflect
the ball over the crossbar.
Toward the end of the
first overtime, North
Carolina increased the pres
sure. That continued through
the brief intermission as sec
onds into the second over
time, Ohai had a breakaway
opportunity down the right
side. Oliver knocked down
the first shot and the
Cardinal defense cleared the

rebound.
Unfortunately for
Stanford, it could only rely
on Oliver's heroics for so
long.

With six minutes remain
ing before penalty kicks, it
was Dunn and Ohai again
leading the attack. Dunn
slipped a clever pass behind
the Cardinal defense, and
this time, Ohai didn't miss.
The senior Ail-American
calmly placed her shot inside
the far post to put the Tar
Heels into the national cham
pionship game and send the
Cardinal back to Palo Alto.

"It was a disappointing
end to a great year," said
Stanford head coach Paul
Rateliffe. "It's always diffi
cult to lose in overtime
because you can't make any
changes or do anything to get
back into the game because
the game is over with one
kick of the ball."

Redshirt junior Courtney
Verloo, who will return next
year for her final year of eli
gibility, gave credit to North
Carolina for their high-pres
sure attack.
"I think we battled back
just as strong and gave
everything that we had,"
Yerloo said. "It was unfortu
nate that we couldn't come
out with the result tonight."

Stanford ends the season
with a 21-2-1 record and the
Pac-12 championship. The
team's 10 seniors end then
four years with a 94-4-4
record, four Pac-10/12 cham
pionships, four Final Four
appearances and the 2011
national championship.
