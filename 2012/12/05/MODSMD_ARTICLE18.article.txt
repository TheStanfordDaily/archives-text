# Zags no match for Card
## No. 1 Stanford still undefeated 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team closed out November this
weekend with decisive victories over
UC-Davis and Gonzaga to finish the
month undefeated (8-0) for only the
fourth time in nine seasons and send
the Card into a two-week break from
game play for final exams.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
emphasized earlier in the week how
important it would be to finish these
two games on a high note so as not to
have to practice with regrets for the
next two weeks.

After a lopsided 87-38 victory
over UC-Davis on Friday and a huge
69-41 win over Gonzaga on Sunday,
the Cardinal maintains its No. 1
ranking and continues to assert its
dominance in the national statistics.
The Card has the fewest number of
turnovers per game (10.5), is second
in field goal percentage (52.6 percent)
and is 17th in scoring (78.8 ppg) and
18th in scoring margin (+22.5 ppg).
Junior Chiney Ogwumike tied
her career high with 27 points
against the Aggies, coupled with 13
rebounds for her fifth double-double
of the season. Classmates Toni
Kokenis and Sara James contributed
11 and 10 points, respectively, in
Friday's win.
The Card played defending West
Coast Conference champions
Gonzaga on Sunday in front of a
rowdy crowd of 6,000 in what is con

sidered to be one of the West Coast's
best matchups. The Card was
unfazed, however, by the atmosphere
and controlled the pace of the game
with confidence from the opening tip
(won by Ogwumike).
She led the team with 21 points
and 11 rebounds, despite having to
battle hard for position down low
against Gonzaga's 6-foot-4 forward
Sunny Greinacher.
Haiden Palmer and Taelor Kan
led the Gonzaga offense with 10

points apiece, but the usually sharp
shooters struggled from the field and
shot a combined 9-22 in the game.
Tight Bulldog defense pestered
the Card all game long, as they quick
ly switched to a full-court man
defense in the beginning of the first
half and made it difficult for the
Stanford forwards to finish at the
basket.

The top-ranked Cardinal ended the month of November undefeated
after beating Gonzaga and UC-Davis last week. Senior forward
Joslyn Tinkle (44) had the thrill of playing against and even guarding
her younger sister Elle, a freshman for the Zags.
