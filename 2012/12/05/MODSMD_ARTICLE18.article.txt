# Zags no match for Card
## No. 1 Stanford still undefeated 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball
team closed out November this
weekend with decisive victories over
UC-Davis and Gonzaga to finish the
month undefeated (8-0) for only the
fourth time in nine seasons and send
the Card into a two-week break from
game play for final exams.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
emphasized earlier in the week how
important it would be to finish these
two games on a high note so as not to
have to practice with regrets for the
next two weeks.

After a lopsided 87-38 victory
over UC-Davis on Friday and a huge
69-41 win over Gonzaga on Sunday,
the Cardinal maintains its No. 1
ranking and continues to assert its
dominance in the national statistics.
The Card has the fewest number of
turnovers per game (10.5), is second
in field goal percentage (52.6 percent)
and is 17th in scoring (78.8 ppg) and
18th in scoring margin (+22.5 ppg).
Junior Chiney Ogwumike tied
her career high with 27 points
against the Aggies, coupled with 13
rebounds for her fifth double-double
of the season. Classmates Toni
Kokenis and Sara James contributed
11 and 10 points, respectively, in
Friday's win.
The Card played defending West
Coast Conference champions
Gonzaga on Sunday in front of a
rowdy crowd of 6,000 in what is con

sidered to be one of the West Coast's
best matchups. The Card was
unfazed, however, by the atmosphere
and controlled the pace of the game
with confidence from the opening tip
(won by Ogwumike).
She led the team with 21 points
and 11 rebounds, despite having to
battle hard for position down low
against Gonzaga's 6-foot-4 forward
Sunny Greinacher.
Haiden Palmer and Taelor Kan
led the Gonzaga offense with 10

points apiece, but the usually sharp
shooters struggled from the field and
shot a combined 9-22 in the game.
Tight Bulldog defense pestered
the Card all game long, as they quick
ly switched to a full-court man
defense in the beginning of the first
half and made it difficult for the
Stanford forwards to finish at the
basket.

defense down low, however,
opened up scoring opportuni
ties on the perimeter for the
Card, especially for sopho
more guard Taylor Greenfield.
Greenfield scored a career
high 18 points, all of which
came from behind the 3-point
arc. She leads the team in 3-
point shooting at 44 percent
and was a very impressive 6-8
against Gonzaga to move into
third in the Pac-12 in 3-point
accuracy.

"Their crowd really moti
vated us. I just pretended that
they were cheering for us,"

said Greenfield. "After the
first threes I got my confi
dence, I got into a flow, and I
was wide open. ...It just
shows what kind of a team we
have. When people are hot we
find them."

Senior Joslyn Tinkle now
has some leverage over
younger sister Elle Tinkle, a
freshman guard for Gonzaga.
Joslyn Tinkle had 18 points
and eight rebounds in the win.
"We came into this game
really excited, not only
because of the family thing,
but it's always a great atmos
phere playing in Gonzaga,"
said Tinkle. "I'm really proud
of her [Elle]; she played really
well and it was fun."

"I think this game meant a
lot to Jos. Elle has a few more

years, but this is Jos's senior
year. And this is bragging
rights in the family," said
VanDerveer. "She has a lot
invested in this team, and I
think she had a great game.
She came out and played
hard."

Despite the relatively
equal matchup in size, the
Card dominated the offensive
and defensive boards, grab
bing 69 rebounds compared to
Gonzaga's 41. The Bulldogs
also had difficulty in making
shots; shooting only 17 per
cent in the first half, they put
themselves into a hole that
they were never able to dig out
of.

VanDerveer expressed her
concern earlier in the season
for Stanford's rebounding and

defense, with powerhouse
Nneka Ogwumike graduated
to the WNBA. So far, however,
this year's team has proven its
ability to compete on both ends
of the floor, only allowing 53.6
ppg and holding opponents'
shooting to just 33 percent.
Chiney Ogwumike and
sophomore point guard Anber
Orrange have been the heart
of Stanford's defense, with
Ogwumike proving a dominant
rebounding force and Orrange
using her quickness to rack up
plenty of steals and fast
breaks.

The Card will resume sea
son play Dec. 15 against Pacific
University at Maples Pavilion.

but it's always a great atmos
phere playing in Gonzaga,"
said Tinkle. "I'm really proud
of her [Elle]; she played really
well and it was fun."

"I think this game meant a
lot to Jos. Elle has a few more

years, but this is Jos's senior
year. And this is bragging
rights in the family," said
VanDerveer. "She has a lot
invested in this team, and I
think she had a great game.
She came out and played
hard."

Despite the relatively
equal matchup in size, the
Card dominated the offensive
and defensive boards, grab
bing 69 rebounds compared to
Gonzaga's 41. The Bulldogs
also had difficulty in making
shots; shooting only 17 per
cent in the first half, they put
themselves into a hole that
they were never able to dig out
of.

VanDerveer expressed her
concern earlier in the season
for Stanford's rebounding and

defense, with powerhouse
Nneka Ogwumike graduated
to the WNBA. So far, however,
this year's team has proven its
ability to compete on both ends
of the floor, only allowing 53.6
ppg and holding opponents'
shooting to just 33 percent.
Chiney Ogwumike and
sophomore point guard Anber
Orrange have been the heart
of Stanford's defense, with
Ogwumike proving a dominant
rebounding force and Orrange
using her quickness to rack up
plenty of steals and fast
breaks.

The Card will resume sea
son play Dec. 15 against Pacific
University at Maples Pavilion.

The Stanford women's basketball
team closed out November this
weekend with decisive victories over
UC-Davis and Gonzaga to finish the
month undefeated (8-0) for only the
fourth time in nine seasons and send
the Card into a two-week break from
game play for final exams.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
emphasized earlier in the week how
important it would be to finish these
two games on a high note so as not to
have to practice with regrets for the
next two weeks.

After a lopsided 87-38 victory
over UC-Davis on Friday and a huge
69-41 win over Gonzaga on Sunday,
the Cardinal maintains its No. 1
ranking and continues to assert its
dominance in the national statistics.
The Card has the fewest number of
turnovers per game (10.5), is second
in field goal percentage (52.6 percent)
and is 17th in scoring (78.8 ppg) and
18th in scoring margin (+22.5 ppg).
Junior Chiney Ogwumike tied
her career high with 27 points
against the Aggies, coupled with 13
rebounds for her fifth double-double
of the season. Classmates Toni
Kokenis and Sara James contributed
11 and 10 points, respectively, in
Friday's win.
The Card played defending West
Coast Conference champions
Gonzaga on Sunday in front of a
rowdy crowd of 6,000 in what is con

sidered to be one of the West Coast's
best matchups. The Card was
unfazed, however, by the atmosphere
and controlled the pace of the game
with confidence from the opening tip
(won by Ogwumike).
She led the team with 21 points
and 11 rebounds, despite having to
battle hard for position down low
against Gonzaga's 6-foot-4 forward
Sunny Greinacher.
Haiden Palmer and Taelor Kan
led the Gonzaga offense with 10

points apiece, but the usually sharp
shooters struggled from the field and
shot a combined 9-22 in the game.
Tight Bulldog defense pestered
the Card all game long, as they quick
ly switched to a full-court man
defense in the beginning of the first
half and made it difficult for the
Stanford forwards to finish at the
basket.

opened up scoring opportuni
ties on the perimeter for the
Card, especially for sopho
more guard Taylor Greenfield.
Greenfield scored a career
high 18 points, all of which
came from behind the 3-point
arc. She leads the team in 3-
point shooting at 44 percent
and was a very impressive 6-8
against Gonzaga to move into
third in the Pac-12 in 3-point
accuracy.

"Their crowd really moti
vated us. I just pretended that
they were cheering for us,"

said Greenfield. "After the
first threes I got my confi
dence, I got into a flow, and I
was wide open. ...It just
shows what kind of a team we
have. When people are hot we
find them."

Senior Joslyn Tinkle now
has some leverage over
younger sister Elle Tinkle, a
freshman guard for Gonzaga.
Joslyn Tinkle had 18 points
and eight rebounds in the win.
"We came into this game

because of the family thing,
