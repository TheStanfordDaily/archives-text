## Stanford readies for 'bloodbath' 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford players and coaches
met with the media Sunday for the
last time before the end of final
exams to discuss Stanford's Rose
Bowl matchup against the
Wisconsin Badgers. The themes
from Stanford's winning streak,
head coach David Shaw's relaxed
attitude and the players' relentless
focus on their goals, prevailed once
again.
Stanford will not do too much in
depth game planning until after
final exams. However, the first
glance at Wisconsin and its run-first
style only six teams throw the
ball less often than the Badgers
has gotten some Stanford players
excited.
Senior outside linebacker Thent
Murphy is "excited about the oppor
tunity to play a team that's a run
first team." Senior nickelbaek Usua
Amanam expects a "smashmouth
football" game that the "old school"
fans will really enjoy. Senior defen
sive end Ben Gardner, a Wisconsin
native, had a similar perspective.
"It's going to be a bloodbath,"
Gardner said. "It's going to be a
physical game up front. We're going
to show we can play physical in the
Pac-12 as well."

Shaw wasn't asked to give too
much of a breakdown of Wisconsin
just yet. Instead, he focused on a few
of the bigger-picture items revolv
ing around the program and college
football as a whole.

Shaw, along with many other
Stanford coaches, is out on recruit
ing visits over the next two weeks.
Though he emphasized that the
Cardinal looks for a very rare
type of prospect who com
bines top football ability with a
focus on academics, he
acknowledged that Stanford's
Pac-12 championship win is a
boost to his recruiting efforts.
"It helps to put on the
Stanford jacket with the little
Rose Bowl pin," he said.
Keeping in the tradition of
his most recent press confer
ences, Shaw added a bit of
humor to the room. When
asked about college football's
upcoming change to a four
team playoff, he took a
comedic twist to his support of
the move to the playoff. Shaw
purposefully "misspoke"
when voicing his support for
an "eight- [pause and smile] I
mean four-team playoff."

As has also become semi
tradition at a 2012 Shaw press
conference, the Stanford head
coach weighed in on another
Andrew Luck 'l2 comeback
performance for the
Indianapolis Colts. Earlier
that day, Luck led the Colts
back from two scores down in
the final minutes to throw the
game-winning touchdown
pass on the game's final play.

Shaw told the room that he
was "running out of words" to
describe how well Luck has
played in his rookie year. Colts
fans certainly are not disap
pointed, as Luck has put his
new team in a great position
for a playoff berth at 84. A
spot in the NFL playoffs
would be the only thing that
could keep Luck from
Stanford's sideline at the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 1, a conflict that
Shaw and Luck both hope he
has.

Part of Shaw's good mood
could stem from the promis
ing injury report, as he
announced that senior punter
Daniel Zychlinski will most

likely be back for the Rose
Bowl. Zychlinski injured his
arm when he could not corral
freshman Reed Miller's low
long snap on a punt in time to
avoid a big hit from UCLAs
junior outside linebacker
Anthony Ban* in the team's
first game against the Bniins.
If Shaw's prediction on
Zychlinski is correct, he'll play
back-to-back games at the
Rose Bowl, missing only last
week's Pac-12 Championship
Game.

As for senior defensive
lineman Terrence Stephens,
his status is much more uncer
tain. Shaw could not report
anything new on Stephens,
who has missed the last two
games due to a "personal mat
ter." In Stephens' absence,
junior David Parry and senior
Josh Mauro have taken over
most of the nose tackle duties
and by all accounts have per
formed very well.
Shaw wasn't the only one
to throw in some humor at the
press conference. The lightest
moment involving players
occurred when senior defen
sive end Ben Gardner was
asked about his famous mul
let. Last year, Gardner drew
ire and blame for the Fiesta
Bowl loss after cutting his hair
before the game. His team
mates convinced him to keep
this year's mullet until after
the bowl game.

Gardner reaffirmed his
earlier position that he would
cut the hair immediately after
the Rose Bowl, drawing an
angry look from teammate
and fellow senior inside line
backer Shayne Skov. Later
that night, Skov reassured
fans on Twitter that he would
make sure Gardner would not
cut the haii 1 until at least after
the team's last game on Jan. 1.
However, from the look on
Skov's face, he might have a
later haircut date in mind for
Gardner.

of the bigger-picture items revolv
ing around the program and college
football as a whole.

Shaw, along with many other
Stanford coaches, is out on recruit
ing visits over the next two weeks.
Though he emphasized that the
Cardinal looks for a very rare
type of prospect who com
bines top football ability with a
focus on academics, he
acknowledged that Stanford's
Pac-12 championship win is a
boost to his recruiting efforts.
"It helps to put on the
Stanford jacket with the little
Rose Bowl pin," he said.
Keeping in the tradition of
his most recent press confer
ences, Shaw added a bit of
humor to the room. When
asked about college football's
upcoming change to a four
team playoff, he took a
comedic twist to his support of
the move to the playoff. Shaw
purposefully "misspoke"
when voicing his support for
an "eight- [pause and smile] I
mean four-team playoff."

As has also become semi
tradition at a 2012 Shaw press
conference, the Stanford head
coach weighed in on another
Andrew Luck 'l2 comeback
performance for the
Indianapolis Colts. Earlier
that day, Luck led the Colts
back from two scores down in
the final minutes to throw the
game-winning touchdown
pass on the game's final play.

Shaw told the room that he
was "running out of words" to
describe how well Luck has
played in his rookie year. Colts
fans certainly are not disap
pointed, as Luck has put his
new team in a great position
for a playoff berth at 84. A
spot in the NFL playoffs
would be the only thing that
could keep Luck from
Stanford's sideline at the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 1, a conflict that
Shaw and Luck both hope he
has.

Part of Shaw's good mood
could stem from the promis
ing injury report, as he
announced that senior punter
Daniel Zychlinski will most

likely be back for the Rose
Bowl. Zychlinski injured his
arm when he could not corral
freshman Reed Miller's low
long snap on a punt in time to
avoid a big hit from UCLAs
junior outside linebacker
Anthony Ban* in the team's
first game against the Bniins.
If Shaw's prediction on
Zychlinski is correct, he'll play
back-to-back games at the
Rose Bowl, missing only last
week's Pac-12 Championship
Game.

As for senior defensive
lineman Terrence Stephens,
his status is much more uncer
tain. Shaw could not report
anything new on Stephens,
who has missed the last two
games due to a "personal mat
ter." In Stephens' absence,
junior David Parry and senior
Josh Mauro have taken over
most of the nose tackle duties
and by all accounts have per
formed very well.
Shaw wasn't the only one
to throw in some humor at the
press conference. The lightest
moment involving players
occurred when senior defen
sive end Ben Gardner was
asked about his famous mul
let. Last year, Gardner drew
ire and blame for the Fiesta
Bowl loss after cutting his hair
before the game. His team
mates convinced him to keep
this year's mullet until after
the bowl game.

Gardner reaffirmed his
earlier position that he would
cut the hair immediately after
the Rose Bowl, drawing an
angry look from teammate
and fellow senior inside line
backer Shayne Skov. Later
that night, Skov reassured
fans on Twitter that he would
make sure Gardner would not
cut the haii 1 until at least after
the team's last game on Jan. 1.
However, from the look on
Skov's face, he might have a
later haircut date in mind for
Gardner.

Stanford players and coaches
met with the media Sunday for the
last time before the end of final
exams to discuss Stanford's Rose
Bowl matchup against the
Wisconsin Badgers. The themes
from Stanford's winning streak,
head coach David Shaw's relaxed
attitude and the players' relentless
focus on their goals, prevailed once
again.
Stanford will not do too much in
depth game planning until after
final exams. However, the first
glance at Wisconsin and its run-first
style only six teams throw the
ball less often than the Badgers
has gotten some Stanford players
excited.
Senior outside linebacker Thent
Murphy is "excited about the oppor
tunity to play a team that's a run
first team." Senior nickelbaek Usua
Amanam expects a "smashmouth
football" game that the "old school"
fans will really enjoy. Senior defen
sive end Ben Gardner, a Wisconsin
native, had a similar perspective.
"It's going to be a bloodbath,"
Gardner said. "It's going to be a
physical game up front. We're going
to show we can play physical in the
Pac-12 as well."

Shaw wasn't asked to give too
much of a breakdown of Wisconsin
just yet. Instead, he focused on a few
of the bigger-picture items revolv
ing around the program and college
football as a whole.
