assault.

Christina 'l3 was raped in the middle of the Main
Quad at Stanford, in the early morning of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day her sophomore year.
He was an acquaintance; a "friend" from her
freshman dorm she didn't really know. They were
both drunk at a party, and he had volunteered to walk
her home.

"I was very, very drunk so I was unable to do any
thing when it was happening," Christina remem
bered. She admits she has blocked much of the inci
dent out but remembers small details the bikers
who rode by them, giving congratulatory hoots
moments before he pressed himself on top of her.
The taste of alcohol on his breath. The "practiced"
feel of it, as he unzipped his pants and hiked up her
skirt in quick, effortless motions.
That night, when she arrived back to her house,
Christina ran into a friend of hers in the bathroom.

"You're up late. What's up?" her friend asked.
"Something happened that I didn't want to hap
pen," was all Christina could say. Her friend gave her
an understanding look, assuming it was simply a
drunken hookup.
"Honey, it happens all the time. Just drink some
water and go to bed."

The next morning she woke up at 9 a.m., in a state
of shock.
"When I woke up in the morning and I remember,
it was the most disgusting feeling, having his semen
all over my legs and thinking, 'I didn't consent to any
of this.'"

She called the Vaden Health Center's 24/7 emer
gency hotline, which took several hours to respond
because of the holiday. When she asked to file a police
report, she was told she had to contact the police
directly There was nothing else the Center could do
for her.

"Vaden was fucking awful. They took hours to call
me back, and it's pretty time-sensitive.... I just
remember being curled up in a ball next to my bed,
waiting for the cops to call me," she said.
The police arrived around 11 p.m. that night to
pick her up and drive her to the closest medical facil
ity that administers rape kits, Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center in San Jose, where a doctor found
vaginal tears and semen.
"I thought I had a good case because I literally
reported it the day of," she said.
After being called in for interviews
by the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety (SUDPS)
over several weeks, SUDPS called her
in one last time to tell her the district
attorney was dropping the case for lack
of evidence.

"They had a female cop tell me,
which I thought was nice, but she
had clearly never undergone any
sensitivity training for sexual
assault.... The way she told me was
essentially, 'We don't think you were
raped.' It was so fucking hurtful.
You're trying to recollect and
become whole again and you hear
that from a woman.... I just remem
ber crying right there."
According to women's health advo
cates, this is often the realily of pursu
ing rape cases in the judicial system.
"It's not that they don't believe the
survivor," said Kelly Ramirez, chief
development officer of the YWCA
Silicon Valley. "It's just that the legal
requirements are not there."

Ramirez said the situation is
unfortunate for everyone involved:
police officers, detectives and espe
cially the victim.
This judicial paralysis becomes

even worse when compared to the
size of the problem: A staggering
one-in-five women will be raped
during their college careers,
according to a 2005 report by the
U.S. Department of Justice.
Between 80 percent and 90 percent
of these rapes are committed by an
acquaintance and fewer than 5 per
cent are reported to police or cam
pus authorities.
Ramirez noted reporting can be
difficult, especially when the victim
and accused have mutual friends.

"They say to you —'l can't
believe he did that. Maybe you real
ly asked for it. You could have just
dealt with this quietly; you didn't
have to actually report it. Think
about his future!"'

"The reason it got so difficult was
because I notified everyone,"
Christina said, describing how going
through the process with Judicial
Affairs and having to recount her
story again and again was excruciat
ing. "I felt I was suffering for doing
the right thing."

Christina's case was one of the
first to use the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) for sexual assault

in fact, Stanford lowered the bur
den of proof from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "preponderance of
evidence" during her case, meaning
the panel would find the accused

responsible if it was "more likely
than not" a crime had occurred. Her
attacker would later use this as
grounds for an eventually unsuc
cessful appeal.
"When they changed to prepon
derance of evidence, I just remem
ber weeping.... I was so happy. It's
pretty much just a survivor and one
witness [to convict]," she said. "As
soon as they proved I was drunk via
witness, they were able to stop the
case right there."
The review panel found her
attacker guilty of rape, and also
heard testimony from another
female student who had been sexual
ly harassed verbally by the same
student. He was given a two-year
suspension, after which he'd be
allowed to return to Stanford.

"I appealed saying he should be
expelled, but everyone knows
Stanford doesn't expel people,
because that looks bad on them,"
Christina said. "Why would anybody
want to have this guy on campus,
when there are so many vulnerable,
vulnerable girls?"
According to Stanford's Office of
Judicial Affairs, nine of the 13 cases
brought before a review panel since
April 2009 have resulted in a finding
of responsibility, and none of the stu
dents found responsible have been
expelled.
After Christina's rape, being at

Stanford became difficult. She began
to skip classes, and her grades began
to suffer.

"Everywhere at Stanford were
reminders that [it] happened. I'm a
Humßio major so all my classes are
in The Quad, even having to pass the
place I was raped everyday, I could
n't do it, I couldn't do it," Christina
said. "It was a hard year."
Despite the inherent difficulty in
reporting and retelling the story of
her attack, Christina said getting
her attacker off campus was crucial
for her mental health.

While Christina and other sur
vivors have some complaints about
University resources, they agree
overall that with Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS), the
Office of Sexual Assault &
Relationship Abuse Education &
Response (SARA) and the ARI] the
resources are there for rape sur
vivors who seek them. The bigger
problem lies in prevention.
"It's not talked about enough,"
Christina said. "And it keeps hap
pening."
Sarah 'l5 was assaulted by a seri
al rapist two months before starting
her freshman year at Stanford. She
echoed Christina concerns over the
lack of discussion about the issue.
"There's a lot of resources out
there, and I've tried a lot of them;

I've reached out a lot. It's more I feel
the community around me [isn't]
very open to hearing about it, or
talking about it, or being comfort
ing," she said. "It's a forbidden topic
for the entirety of Stanford."

From New Student Orientation
(NSO) through her freshman year,
she had the feeling that Stanford
was the place to come and be happy
—if you can't be happy here, you
simply don't fit in.
"I don't know how to change the
mindset or overall feeling of a place,"
Sarah said. "It bothers me to no end
that it is like this, but I don't know
how to fix it."
The ARP has reformed
Stanford's judicial system, making it
easier for survivors to obtain convic
tions against their attackers. But
according to Sarah and Christina,
Stanford remains a difficult place to
discuss these issues.

"It leads to feelings that people
have in [the survivor] community
that nobody wants to talk about sex
ual assault and nobody wants to hear
it exists," she said. "That's not a
good feeling for somebody who's
been sexually assaulted to feel."
