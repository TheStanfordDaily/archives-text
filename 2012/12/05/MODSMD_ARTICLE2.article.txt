Christina 'l3 was raped in the middle of the Main
Quad at Stanford, in the early morning of Martin
Luther King Jr. Day her sophomore year.
He was an acquaintance; a "friend" from her
freshman dorm she didn't really know. They were
both drunk at a party, and he had volunteered to walk
her home.

"I was very, very drunk so I was unable to do any
thing when it was happening," Christina remem
bered. She admits she has blocked much of the inci
dent out but remembers small details the bikers
who rode by them, giving congratulatory hoots
moments before he pressed himself on top of her.
The taste of alcohol on his breath. The "practiced"
feel of it, as he unzipped his pants and hiked up her
skirt in quick, effortless motions.
That night, when she arrived back to her house,
Christina ran into a friend of hers in the bathroom.

"You're up late. What's up?" her friend asked.
"Something happened that I didn't want to hap
pen," was all Christina could say. Her friend gave her
an understanding look, assuming it was simply a
drunken hookup.
"Honey, it happens all the time. Just drink some
water and go to bed."

The next morning she woke up at 9 a.m., in a state
of shock.
"When I woke up in the morning and I remember,
it was the most disgusting feeling, having his semen
all over my legs and thinking, 'I didn't consent to any
of this.'"

She called the Vaden Health Center's 24/7 emer
gency hotline, which took several hours to respond
because of the holiday. When she asked to file a police
report, she was told she had to contact the police
directly There was nothing else the Center could do
for her.

"Vaden was fucking awful. They took hours to call
me back, and it's pretty time-sensitive.... I just
remember being curled up in a ball next to my bed,
waiting for the cops to call me," she said.
The police arrived around 11 p.m. that night to
pick her up and drive her to the closest medical facil
ity that administers rape kits, Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center in San Jose, where a doctor found
vaginal tears and semen.
"I thought I had a good case because I literally
reported it the day of," she said.
