# POWELL POWERING UP
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
If anything has been consistent
during Stanford's up-and-down start
to the season, it has been the stellar
play of junior Dwight Powell. The 6-
foot-9 forward has transformed into a
completely different player over the
summer, emerging as the talent that
the coaching staff envisioned when he
was one of the top recruits in his class
in 2009. Powell has shown no signs of
the ankle injury that plagued him
throughout the 2011-12 campaign,
becoming a force in the paint for the
Cardinal.
Powell continued his dominant
play when the Stanford Cardinal (6-3)
took on the University of Denver
Pioneers (1-5) at Maples Pavilion on
Sunday. The Card needed a solid per
formance against an outmatched
Pioneer squad that was reeling after
three straight losses. Powell gave
them just that, scoring a career-high
29 points to lead Stanford to a 71-58
victory.

The Card wasted no time grabbing
the lead, jumping out to a quick 10-2
advantage after sophomore guard
Chasson Randle led Powell with a nice
pass to the basket. Powell finished and
drew the foul, knocking down the free
throw to complete the old-fashioned
three-point play.
Stanford's perimeter defense was
swarming, terrorizing Denver combo
player Chris Udofia to force five early
turnovers. This led Denver coach Joe
Scott to call a timeout with around 11
minutes remaining in the first half,
hoping to get his team under control.
It did little good, as the Card went on
to score three straight baskets to grab
a commanding 21-6 lead.
The two squads traded buckets for
the remainder of the first half, Powell
helping Stanford maintain a comfort
able lead with a couple of baskets to
close out the first half the Cardinal
went into the locker room up 35-19.
Denver picked up the offensive
intensity in the second half, but


LEIGH KINNEY/The Stanford Daily
Thanks to the efforts of Dwight Powell (33), Stanford emerged from
the weekend unscathed. The junior forward had a career-high 29
points in the Card's home win over Denver on Sunday.
Stanford's lead proved too
difficult to overcome. The
Pioneers pulled to within 10
after Udofia knocked down a
3-pointer with 12:47 remain
ing, but that would be as
close as Denver could get.

A Josh Huestis dunk
immediately following placed
the momentum squarely
back in Stanford's favor.
Randle, Powell and junior
Aaron Bright would do the
rest, playing the inside-out
style of basketball that
should make the Card a Pac
-12 contender this season.

Randle and Bright were
efficient from the 3-point
line, knocking down a couple
of late shots to maintain
Stanford's lead. Their ability
to drive to the basket helped
open up lanes for forwards
Powell and Huestis, as their
ability to draw defenders left
the big men unguarded. The
Card never really felt any
pressure in the second half,
securing the 71-58 victory.
Powell was certainly the

story in this contest, as the
Pioneers simply could not
find an answer for the
Stanford big man. Powell's
29 points came on a sensa
tional shooting night â€”he
went 10-13 from the floor,
knocking down 9-11 free
throws in the process.
Huestis chipped in with eight
points (4-7 from the field)
and added a team-high 10
rebounds to make his mark
on the game.

Randle distributed the
ball well, totaling four assists
to go along with nine points.
Besides Powell's dominant
performance, Stanford enjoyed
production from almost its
entire team, as a variety of
players chipped in with a cou
ple of baskets.

The last two wins for
Stanford have been very
important to ensure there
are no more slip-ups in non
conference play. The
Cardinal will look to build
momentum in its last game
before the break for final
exams, as it takes on UC-
Davis on Saturday at Maples
Pavilion.
