# POWELL POWERING UP
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
If anything has been consistent
during Stanford's up-and-down start
to the season, it has been the stellar
play of junior Dwight Powell. The 6-
foot-9 forward has transformed into a
completely different player over the
summer, emerging as the talent that
the coaching staff envisioned when he
was one of the top recruits in his class
in 2009. Powell has shown no signs of
the ankle injury that plagued him
throughout the 2011-12 campaign,
becoming a force in the paint for the
Cardinal.
Powell continued his dominant
play when the Stanford Cardinal (6-3)
took on the University of Denver
Pioneers (1-5) at Maples Pavilion on
Sunday. The Card needed a solid per
formance against an outmatched
Pioneer squad that was reeling after
three straight losses. Powell gave
them just that, scoring a career-high
29 points to lead Stanford to a 71-58
victory.

The Card wasted no time grabbing
the lead, jumping out to a quick 10-2
advantage after sophomore guard
Chasson Randle led Powell with a nice
pass to the basket. Powell finished and
drew the foul, knocking down the free
throw to complete the old-fashioned
three-point play.
Stanford's perimeter defense was
swarming, terrorizing Denver combo
player Chris Udofia to force five early
turnovers. This led Denver coach Joe
Scott to call a timeout with around 11
minutes remaining in the first half,
hoping to get his team under control.
It did little good, as the Card went on
to score three straight baskets to grab
a commanding 21-6 lead.
The two squads traded buckets for
the remainder of the first half, Powell
helping Stanford maintain a comfort
able lead with a couple of baskets to
close out the first half the Cardinal
went into the locker room up 35-19.
Denver picked up the offensive
intensity in the second half, but

Thanks to the efforts of Dwight Powell (33), Stanford emerged from
the weekend unscathed. The junior forward had a career-high 29
points in the Card's home win over Denver on Sunday.
