# Rose Bowl memories still sweet
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Rose Bowl is why I love
apocalypse years. I've lived
through two, Y2K and the
upcoming Mayan dooms
day and when I celebrate
how the world didn't actually end a
month from now, it will be the second
time that I'm doing so in Pasadena.
The myriad memories from my
first Rose Bowl trip in 1999 I was
six are vivid to this day, fresher in
my mind than my Bar Mitzvah, my
high school graduation or even the
EE problem set I did last week. And
now we get to make some new ones.
The Rose Bowl is why, whenever
I visit my grandma's house, I take a
special trip to the refrigerator. On it
hangs a picture of my dad and me,
decked in Stanford gear before I was
even old enough to know the word
"decked," smiling cheekily at the
camera. Age has grayed his hair,
braces have straightened my teeth
and the three-foot height difference
between us has been more than
made up, but not much else has
changed.
The Rose Bowl is why I can't help
but smile when I walk into my
garage. In a little nook on the right
side still sits the unopened box of
Duraflame logs my dad had bought
13 years ago, just in case utilities
broke down on my mom and sister at
the turn of the millennium while he
and I were living it up in L.A.
The Rose Bowl is why I hate the
Fox show "Futurama." When a
Mend showed an episode to me last
year, it happened to be some sort of
Y2K flashback. A TV with the Rose
Bowl on appeared in the background
for a second, and there it was,
Stanford and Wisconsin in a close
game at halftime... but the anima
tors had put Wisconsin ahead 9-3
when it was really the Cardinal that
had led by that score. I screamed at
the T\£l screamed at my Mend and
I never willingly watched another
episode.
The Rose Bowl is why I have
trouble tuning in for Heisman
Trophy ceremonies. I probably just
hold a grudge because of his 200
yards in that millennium game, but I
swear to god that Ron Dayne
gets mentioned way too
much. And Montee Ball will
be in for a stern talking-to if
he emulates his Wisconsin
predecessor next month.
The Rose Bowl is why I
love white chocolate
macadamia nut cookies. I
tried my first one on Jan. 2,
2000, as our plane was taxiing
out of John Wayne Airport,
and any disappointment over
the loss the day before melted
away. That cookie also broke
free my first loose tooth,
which I still have at home.

The Rose Bowl is why, at
Friday's Pac-12
Championship Game, my
white hands were speckled
Cardinal red (too much clap
ping) and my Cardinal-red
lips were chapped white (too
much screaming). Like all
true Stanford fans, I wasn't
fully satisfied with the
Orange and Fiesta Bowls the
last two seasons and would do
whatever I could to ensure a
shorter plane flight this time
around.

And behind a team that
likes to play it disgustingly
close, we finally get to book
those tickets to Pasadena
again. We finally get to live a

new set of memories.
So as we were being asked
to clear the muddy Stanford
Stadium field after Friday's
celebration, I dropped to my
knees, kissed the goal line
and stole a tuft of grass from
the end zone. (Don't worry; it
has nine months to grow back
before the 2013 home open
er.)

That bit of turf is going in
a plastic bag to be stashed
alongside the photo, the
Duraflame logs and the lost
tooth from 13 years ago. They
won't be in the same drawer
or even room, but they'll
always share a place in this
Stanford fan's heart.

Because for me, Cardinal
football isn't just about
sports. It's about the greater
Stanford community, it's
about family and it's especial
ly about tradition. The
Grandaddy of Them All epit
omizes those things, which is
why this New Year's will be
especially special for anyone
who makes the trip.
Besides, the Rose Bowl's
is one parade that even an
apocalypse cannot rain on.

The Rose Bowl is why I love
apocalypse years. I've lived
through two, Y2K and the
upcoming Mayan dooms
day and when I celebrate
how the world didn't actually end a
month from now, it will be the second
time that I'm doing so in Pasadena.
The myriad memories from my
first Rose Bowl trip in 1999 I was
six are vivid to this day, fresher in
my mind than my Bar Mitzvah, my
high school graduation or even the
EE problem set I did last week. And
now we get to make some new ones.
The Rose Bowl is why, whenever
I visit my grandma's house, I take a
special trip to the refrigerator. On it
hangs a picture of my dad and me,
decked in Stanford gear before I was
even old enough to know the word
"decked," smiling cheekily at the
camera. Age has grayed his hair,
braces have straightened my teeth
and the three-foot height difference
between us has been more than
made up, but not much else has
changed.
The Rose Bowl is why I can't help
but smile when I walk into my
garage. In a little nook on the right
side still sits the unopened box of
Duraflame logs my dad had bought
13 years ago, just in case utilities
broke down on my mom and sister at
the turn of the millennium while he
and I were living it up in L.A.
The Rose Bowl is why I hate the
Fox show "Futurama." When a
Mend showed an episode to me last
year, it happened to be some sort of
Y2K flashback. A TV with the Rose
Bowl on appeared in the background
for a second, and there it was,
Stanford and Wisconsin in a close
game at halftime... but the anima
tors had put Wisconsin ahead 9-3
when it was really the Cardinal that
had led by that score. I screamed at
the T\£l screamed at my Mend and
I never willingly watched another
episode.
The Rose Bowl is why I have
trouble tuning in for Heisman
Trophy ceremonies. I probably just
hold a grudge because of his 200
yards in that millennium game, but I
swear to god that Ron Dayne
gets mentioned way too
much. And Montee Ball will
be in for a stern talking-to if
he emulates his Wisconsin
predecessor next month.
The Rose Bowl is why I
love white chocolate
macadamia nut cookies. I
tried my first one on Jan. 2,
2000, as our plane was taxiing
out of John Wayne Airport,
and any disappointment over
the loss the day before melted
away. That cookie also broke
free my first loose tooth,
which I still have at home.

The Rose Bowl is why, at
Friday's Pac-12
Championship Game, my
white hands were speckled
Cardinal red (too much clap
ping) and my Cardinal-red
lips were chapped white (too
much screaming). Like all
true Stanford fans, I wasn't
fully satisfied with the
Orange and Fiesta Bowls the
last two seasons and would do
whatever I could to ensure a
shorter plane flight this time
around.

And behind a team that
likes to play it disgustingly
close, we finally get to book
those tickets to Pasadena
again. We finally get to live a

new set of memories.
So as we were being asked
to clear the muddy Stanford
Stadium field after Friday's
celebration, I dropped to my
knees, kissed the goal line
and stole a tuft of grass from
the end zone. (Don't worry; it
has nine months to grow back
before the 2013 home open
er.)

That bit of turf is going in
a plastic bag to be stashed
alongside the photo, the
Duraflame logs and the lost
tooth from 13 years ago. They
won't be in the same drawer
or even room, but they'll
always share a place in this
Stanford fan's heart.

Because for me, Cardinal
football isn't just about
sports. It's about the greater
Stanford community, it's
