# Rose Bowl memories still sweet
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
The Rose Bowl is why I love
apocalypse years. I've lived
through two, Y2K and the
upcoming Mayan dooms
day and when I celebrate
how the world didn't actually end a
month from now, it will be the second
time that I'm doing so in Pasadena.
The myriad memories from my
first Rose Bowl trip in 1999 I was
six are vivid to this day, fresher in
my mind than my Bar Mitzvah, my
high school graduation or even the
EE problem set I did last week. And
now we get to make some new ones.
The Rose Bowl is why, whenever
I visit my grandma's house, I take a
special trip to the refrigerator. On it
hangs a picture of my dad and me,
decked in Stanford gear before I was

braces have straightened my teeth
and the three-foot height difference
between us has been more than

the turn of the millennium while he
and I were living it up in L.A.
The Rose Bowl is why I hate the
Fox show "Futurama." When a
Mend showed an episode to me last
year, it happened to be some sort of
Y2K flashback. A TV with the Rose
Bowl on appeared in the background
for a second, and there it was,
Stanford and Wisconsin in a close
game at halftime... but the anima
tors had put Wisconsin ahead 9-3
when it was really the Cardinal that
had led by that score. I screamed at
the T\Â£l screamed at my Mend and
I never willingly watched another
episode.
The Rose Bowl is why I have
trouble tuning in for Heisman
Trophy ceremonies. I probably just
hold a grudge because of his 200
yards in that millennium game, but I
