# Long live the chaos of the BCS

I'm not going to pretend I'm
happy that Stanford couldn't
even sell out its 50,000-seat
stadium for the Pac-12
Championship Game on FViday
but there is something deliriously anti
establishment in the fact that, on merit
alone, a school that wouldn't normally
get picked for even one BCS bowl is
going to be heading to its third in three
years.

In 2010 and 2011, Stanford finished
the regular season ranked fourth,
ensuring that someone had to give it a
spot. Just one place further down and
even with outstanding quarterback
Andrew Luck there would have been
no guarantees; it could easily have been
overlooked for the No. 14 ranked
school.
BCS selection rules state that the
top two teams automatically go to the
National Championship Game and, if
the third-ranked team is guaranteed a
place by being the champion of an auto
matic qualifying (AQ) conference, then
a fourth-ranked AQ team must be
picked. Stanford, which did not win the
Pac-12 in either 2010 or 2011, relied on
this rule to make consecutive appear
ances in the Orange Bowl and Fiesta
Bowl.

This year, two losses during the reg
ular season meant that even a pair of
wins over then-No. 2 Oregon and then-
No. 2 USC could not elevate Stanford
back to fourth. This year the Cardinal
could not even count on the guaranteed
media attention of having the top pick
in the NFL draft, which would make it
interesting property in the BCS mar
ketplace. The only way in was to upset
an Oregon team on its way to the
National Championship Game and fol
low that up with a brace of wins over
UCLA.

Would the Cardinal, No. 6 at the
end of the season, have made it other
wise? Maybe not. Stanford was ranked
in the preseason, but not highly.
