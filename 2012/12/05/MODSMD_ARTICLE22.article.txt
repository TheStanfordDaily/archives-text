# Long live the chaos of the BCS
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I'm not going to pretend I'm
happy that Stanford couldn't
even sell out its 50,000-seat
stadium for the Pac-12
Championship Game on FViday
but there is something deliriously anti
establishment in the fact that, on merit
alone, a school that wouldn't normally
get picked for even one BCS bowl is
going to be heading to its third in three
years.

In 2010 and 2011, Stanford finished
the regular season ranked fourth,
ensuring that someone had to give it a
spot. Just one place further down and
even with outstanding quarterback
Andrew Luck there would have been
no guarantees; it could easily have been
overlooked for the No. 14 ranked
school.
BCS selection rules state that the
top two teams automatically go to the
National Championship Game and, if
the third-ranked team is guaranteed a
place by being the champion of an auto
matic qualifying (AQ) conference, then
a fourth-ranked AQ team must be
picked. Stanford, which did not win the
Pac-12 in either 2010 or 2011, relied on
this rule to make consecutive appear
ances in the Orange Bowl and Fiesta
Bowl.

This year, two losses during the reg
ular season meant that even a pair of
wins over then-No. 2 Oregon and then-
No. 2 USC could not elevate Stanford
back to fourth. This year the Cardinal
could not even count on the guaranteed
media attention of having the top pick
in the NFL draft, which would make it
interesting property in the BCS mar
ketplace. The only way in was to upset
an Oregon team on its way to the
National Championship Game and fol
low that up with a brace of wins over
UCLA.

Would the Cardinal, No. 6 at the
end of the season, have made it other
wise? Maybe not. Stanford was ranked
in the preseason, but not highly.
Languishing down at No. 21 in
the AP Poll, it lay far away from
the dizzying heights of fellow
Pac-12 teams No. 1 USC and
No. 5 Oregon. Everyone knew
who would be in the conference
championship game; everyone
knew one of the Trojans or
Ducks would be off to contest a
national title.
Stanford and UCLA —
unranked ahead of the season
spoiled that party, though.
Was this a freak outcome? Was
the preseason prediction really
a reasoned, purely analytical
analysis of the teams' prospects,
or was there just a little
favoritism behind it?
Few have the storied histo
ry of USC, and unlike the
Tbojans and Ducks, which can
almost always pack their stadi
ums, the Cardinal and Bruins
struggled to fill the stands in
their final, crucial home games
of the season. Put bluntly, the
former two schools are a bigger
story and would be guaranteed
to travel with strong support to
any BCS bowl. It would be a
brave selection committee that
passed up the chance of hosting
either in favor of Stanford.

Elsewhere, Notre Dame
has been similarly upsetting
the apple cart this year. The AP
didn't give the Irish much of a
chance before the first game
kicked off; now as the only (eli
gible) undefeated team it can
not be overlooked, however
much SEC- and anti-Notre
Dame-bias would prefer other
wise. I know a lot of people
aren't happy about this, but I
didn't grow up in a world where
American football existed so I
never learned to hate the Irish.

Grudgingly I think a lot of
people may throw then* weight
behind an SEC team just to see
Alabama embarrass Notre
Dame in a 40-point annihila
tion. I want the complete oppo

site: I would love to see the
Irish defend their way to a
national title in a tight three
point game.
Why? Because it is great to
be messing with the estab
lished order of things. Spoils
should be unpredictable; the
undervalued and un-favored
minnows should get to eat the
sharks sometimes.
Alabama head coach Nick
Saban is not a fan of how things
have turned out. He would
favor both SEC rivals Florida
and Georgia getting places in
BCS bowls, not just the Gators.
But of course he would. Any
system that benefits the SEC,
directly or indirectly, benefits
his team. I'm sure Saban would
happily endorse a system
where year after year we had
two SEC schools facing off in
the title game.
Instead, three of this year's
five BCS bowls will feature
teams ranked outside the top
14, with Stanford even facing
an unranked team, Wisconsin,
in the Rose Bowl. If you don't
like that, don't blame the sys
tem, blame what happened at
Ohio State and Penn State to
ban them from the Big Ten
Championship and blame once-
No. 12 Nebraska for being
massacred 70-31 by the
Badgers in that vacuum.

ESPN's Mark Schlabach is
similarly unimpressed by the
fact that No. 12 Florida State
and No. 15 Northern Illinois
will square up in the Orange
Bowl, or that the only thing
standing between No. 3 Florida
and Sugar Bowl glory is No. 21
Louisville. I suspect he's not a
fan of the FA Cup or U.S. Open
Cup either —assuming, that is,
he even cares about soccer —
because everything about this
current situation is what makes
those tournaments great.
The FA Cup third-round
fixtures were announced on
Sunday, and among the juicy
clashes between top teams are
once-in-a-lifetime games
between Premier League and
non-league clubs. For example,

Mansfield Town or Lincoln
City, currently ranked 88 and
93 positions below Liverpool,
respectively could yet host the
Reds in early January.
Liveipool normally plays at
45,000-seat Airfield, far bigger
than the 10,000-seat homes of
the Stags or the Imps.
Liverpool is worth around $B5O
million, probably a hundred
times more than Mansfield
Town and Lincoln City com
bined. But, regardless of
Liverpool's storied history and
world-class players, whichever
club faces it in the new year will
have earned that position fair
and square and —whisper it
could even win.
Did all of those teams that
Saban and Schlabach don't rate
win their places fairly? Yes. Did
reigning national champion
Alabama similarly deserve to
be in last year's title game? No,
that pretty clearly should have
been Oklahoma State.

If this is BCS chaos, then
long may it continue. It gives
everyone hope, every team a
chance.

Back on the West Coast,
that should be inspiring Bruins
and Cardinal fans to dream; if
USC continues to self-deto
nate, UCLA could easily
become the dominant power in
the Pac-12 South, and up here
in the North, if Stanford can
build on four remarkable
years, maybe the Ducks can be
kept in check. Perhaps USC-
Oregon is not the rivalry future
predictions should be focusing
on.

And maybe, just maybe, if
Stanford can keep messing
things up for everyone else for
long enough, there might just
be time to finally fill that stadi
um.
