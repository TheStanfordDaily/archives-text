# INTERVIEWS
## ORANGE AVENUE On beaches and Bali (tut not beaches in Bali) 
### Tracy Vu | FELLOW 
Recently, electronic dance music
has been taking over the radio
stations, but remember when
every car was pumping MGMT's
"Electric Feel" or when every shop
ping center was blasting Foster the
People's "Pumped Up Kicks"? While
those days are gone, indie bands are
still producing great music bands
such as Orange Avenue, an indie
rock band hailing from Daytona
Beach, Fla.
Their songs have been featured
on networks like MTV and Fox
Sports, and a few singles have even
made it on top charts in other coun
tries. Even with all of this success,
Orange Avenue sticks to their inde
pendent music label, even giving fans
the option to book them directly
through a Facebook app called
Getßooked. Intermission caught up
with Orange Avenue over
Thanksgiving break to get the chance
to look behind the scenes with what
goes on with an indie rock band.
Intermission (INT): Thanks for sit
ting down with The Daily. Our first
question is, where did the name come
from?
Sean Sedita (drums): We would all
practice on a street called Orange
Avenue in Daytona Beach. We'd
always call each other and say, "Hey
let's meet at this time on this day at
Orange Avenue." We kept constantly
saying "Orange Avenue," so we
decided on keeping that name for
our band, and it wasn't a very nice
part of Florida either. It's also a
reminder of where we came from and

the hard times.
INT: Why did you guys decide to go
the independent label route?
Chris Yetter (guitar): We wanted to
have control over our own music and
be able to build our own market
instead of having somebody treat us
like puppets. We love being indie
artists, but we're also not against
major record labels, and we know the
pros and cons of each. We just want
to make sure that we do our own
music the way we want it and not be
beholden by anyone else.
INT: These days it seems like every
one has an indie band. What are
some hurdles you've had to overcome
being an indie band?
Jamie Pohl (bass): Everything I
mean from recording, we've had
issues losing the hard drive for
recorded songs, going to several
music studios for this past album,
"Small Victories," having our practice
stations close down ... it's like con
stantly having the door shut in your
face, but that's why we entitled our
recent album "Small Victories." You
just need to keep moving forward, no
matter what happens.
INT: You guys just recently released a
new music video. Why did you guys
choose "As You Fall" as the song for
the video?
Chris: "As You Fall" is actually one of
our personal favorite songs on the
new album. Of all of the songs, it's
definitely the most different from
what we usually do. It's more of a bal

lad than a hard pop-rock song, and
it's definitely full of more emotion
than our other songs. It's a story of
heartbreak, and it's a collaborative
story of how we've all felt. We fell in
love with it, and when the album
came out, we got a lot of great feed
back on the song from our fans.
INT: One of your songs appeared as
No. 18 on the Top 40 Chart of Bali,
Indonesia. Which song was that and
how did that happen?
Sean: It was "Just Refrain," and how
that happened ... we really don't
know, actually. There's something
called Promo Only that goes out to
different DJs and radio stations every

month. They choose only 18 songs a
month, and our song was chosen, so
we think that's how it might've gotten
into the hands of some Bali-
Indonesian radio station, but we real
ly don't know. With today's technolo
gy, it's hard to tell, but we've seen traf
fic on our Facebook from all over the
world, and we even had one of our
songs appear in a commercial in New
Zealand.
INT: Another thing that Orange
Avenue is known for is collaboration
with different nonprofit organiza
tions. Could you talk a little more
about that?
Sean: We're always looking for ways
for our music to do good in the

world. We've worked with PACER's
National Bullying Prevention Center.
They've been doing really wonderful
things. We've also worked with
Musicians on Call. They bring musi
cians to the bedside of patients in
hospitals, and we've had the privilege
of being able to visit a hospital in the
Bronx and play for kids there. It was
great experience, and even though
they didn't know our music, they
really appreciated that we were there.

artists, but we're also not against
major record labels, and we know the
pros and cons of each. We just want
to make sure that we do our own
music the way we want it and not be
beholden by anyone else.
INT: These days it seems like every
one has an indie band. What are
some hurdles you've had to overcome
being an indie band?
Jamie Pohl (bass): Everything I
mean from recording, we've had
issues losing the hard drive for
recorded songs, going to several
music studios for this past album,
"Small Victories," having our practice
stations close down ... it's like con
stantly having the door shut in your
face, but that's why we entitled our
recent album "Small Victories." You
just need to keep moving forward, no
matter what happens.
INT: You guys just recently released a
new music video. Why did you guys
choose "As You Fall" as the song for
the video?
Chris: "As You Fall" is actually one of
our personal favorite songs on the
new album. Of all of the songs, it's
definitely the most different from
what we usually do. It's more of a bal

lad than a hard pop-rock song, and
it's definitely full of more emotion
than our other songs. It's a story of
heartbreak, and it's a collaborative
story of how we've all felt. We fell in
love with it, and when the album
came out, we got a lot of great feed
back on the song from our fans.
INT: One of your songs appeared as
No. 18 on the Top 40 Chart of Bali,
Indonesia. Which song was that and
how did that happen?
Sean: It was "Just Refrain," and how
that happened ... we really don't
know, actually. There's something
called Promo Only that goes out to
different DJs and radio stations every

month. They choose only 18 songs a
month, and our song was chosen, so
we think that's how it might've gotten
into the hands of some Bali-
Indonesian radio station, but we real
ly don't know. With today's technolo
gy, it's hard to tell, but we've seen traf
fic on our Facebook from all over the
world, and we even had one of our
songs appear in a commercial in New
Zealand.
INT: Another thing that Orange
Avenue is known for is collaboration
with different nonprofit organiza
tions. Could you talk a little more
about that?
Sean: We're always looking for ways
for our music to do good in the

world. We've worked with PACER's
National Bullying Prevention Center.
They've been doing really wonderful
things. We've also worked with
Musicians on Call. They bring musi
cians to the bedside of patients in
hospitals, and we've had the privilege
of being able to visit a hospital in the
Bronx and play for kids there. It was
great experience, and even though
they didn't know our music, they
really appreciated that we were there.

Recently, electronic dance music
has been taking over the radio
stations, but remember when
every car was pumping MGMT's
"Electric Feel" or when every shop
ping center was blasting Foster the
People's "Pumped Up Kicks"? While
those days are gone, indie bands are
still producing great music bands
such as Orange Avenue, an indie
rock band hailing from Daytona
Beach, Fla.
Their songs have been featured
on networks like MTV and Fox
Sports, and a few singles have even
made it on top charts in other coun
tries. Even with all of this success,
Orange Avenue sticks to their inde
pendent music label, even giving fans
the option to book them directly
through a Facebook app called
Getßooked. Intermission caught up
with Orange Avenue over
Thanksgiving break to get the chance
to look behind the scenes with what
goes on with an indie rock band.
Intermission (INT): Thanks for sit
ting down with The Daily. Our first
question is, where did the name come
from?
Sean Sedita (drums): We would all
practice on a street called Orange
Avenue in Daytona Beach. We'd
always call each other and say, "Hey
let's meet at this time on this day at
Orange Avenue." We kept constantly
saying "Orange Avenue," so we
decided on keeping that name for
our band, and it wasn't a very nice
part of Florida either. It's also a
reminder of where we came from and

the hard times.
INT: Why did you guys decide to go
the independent label route?
Chris Yetter (guitar): We wanted to
have control over our own music and
be able to build our own market
instead of having somebody treat us
like puppets. We love being indie
artists, but we're also not against
major record labels, and we know the
pros and cons of each. We just want
to make sure that we do our own
music the way we want it and not be
beholden by anyone else.
