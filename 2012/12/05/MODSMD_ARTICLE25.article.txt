# 'BIG RIVER'

Few authors can get away with threaten
ing their critics like Mark Twain.
Visitors to Theatre Works' Thursday
evening production of "Big River," a musical
revival of the American classic "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," were greet
ed in the audience by signs bearing one of
Twain's many celebrated witticisms: "Persons
attempting to find a motive in this narrative
will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find
a moral in it will be banished; persons
attempting to find a plot in it will be shot. By
order of the author."
Despite performing in a relatively small
space, the troupe made full use of the theater,
sending Huck up and down the aisles to create

a sense of long distances traveled, and using
lights and opaque screens to mimic the chang
ing weather. Not a moment wasted in the
exhale of a scene change, the pacing swung nat
urally from song to strife as our protagonist
found his way down the Mississippi. Twain's
favorite troublemaker eased seamlessly between
addressing the audience, involving himself in
the scene and belting the musical numbers for
which the production is so well-known.
The central friendship of Huck Finn and
his runaway slave companion, Jim, was made
all the more tender by the finesse of the two
main actors, the latter of whom, James
Monroe Iglehart, just completed a three-year
run on Broadway in the musical "Memphis."

Iglehart originated his "Memphis" role at
Theatre Works years ago and was proud to
return to the Silicon Valley theater company
that was a significant part of his earlier career.
Alex Goley made his Theatre Works debut as
Huck himself, excited to reprise the role from
his experiences during the summer at
Arkansas Shakespeare Theatre.
What could inspire Stanford students to
burst "the bubble" and come out to support
the theater community of Palo Alto? Professor
Shelley Fisher Fishkin of the American Studies
Department organized the outing as part of
her fall quarter introductory seminar, Mark
Twain and American Culture. One of many
seminars designed to give freshmen the

opportunity to explore a topic of interest with
a distinguished professor, this class examines
how the quintessentially American works of
Mark Twain explore themes of race, technolo
gy, heredity versus environment, religion, edu
cation and what it means to be American,
generating a diverse and curious group of stu
dents looking to connect to the cultural back
drop of the nation they are calling home for
the next four years.
Whether audience members are coming
out to analyze an interpretation of one of
America's favorite rabble-rousers or just for
the charming, homey atmosphere of the the
ater and its participants, "Big River" is sure to
wow Palo Alto in weeks to come.
