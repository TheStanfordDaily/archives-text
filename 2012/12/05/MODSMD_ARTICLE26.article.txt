"SLAUGHTERHOUSE"
TY SEGALL BAND

If you want some rowdier album-of-the-year material, slip on your torn M 65 and some
vintage Chucks and put on "Slaughterhouse" by San Francisco's own Ty Segall, perhaps
the garage-rockin'-est album by the man to date. It's been a busy year for this surf-haired
savant; "Slaughterhouse" marks the second of his three albums out this year, including
"Hair" and "Twins." "Slaughterhouse" is unapologetically brash, as one should expect
from an album with a braided screaming skull on its cover. There must have been a sale
on overdrive pedals, because every guitar part has the kind of satisfying crunch that makes
you want to buy a fisheye lens, make a skateboarding video and tag the local mall.
Segall's vocals are equally fitting, pitchy and almost adolescent, but in an enjoyable, non
aggravating way. The good news is that the highlights of the album are the mid-song
jams, not the vocals, so don't fret if screaming isn't up your alley. If you actually want your
ragerto rage and not just feature beer pong backed by Pitbull for the umpteenth time, try
out "Slaughterhouse."

"THE SEER"
SWANS
"LUNACY. LUNACY. LUNACY." No, really. The title track of "The Seer" is dead
on: This album is nuts. It's a goddamn beating. Nothing released this year or in
most years, for that matter sounds anything like it. It's harsh, abrasive and chal
lenging. But it's also an experience, and the importance of that quality is hard to under
state. Take the title track, for instance: Not only is it about as long as the entirety of
"Rubber Soul," but the opening minute probably features a greater diversity of instrumen
tation than you'll find across some artists' entire discographies. But let's be honest, this
album is not for the faint of heart.
Unless you're willing to listen to two hours of drone, abrasion, noise and Michael
Gira's otherworldly shamanistic chanting, you're going to have a bad time. But it's within
such a context that songs like Karen O's folk ballad "Song for a Warrior"* achieve their full
pristine beauty. So take charge of your life and make like a patrician for a couple of hours
with this glorious AOTY contender.
*"Song for a Warrior" is my favorite song released this year, in case any of you were
wondering (as I suspect many of you were).

We know, we know. We've been busy listening to
"Red," too. Here are some albums that may have
slipped through the cracks in 2012.

"DILLATROIT"
J DILLA

I love J Dilla, may he rest in peace. The latest release of this instrumental hip-hop
genius's unpublished work comes in two flavors: the vinyl "Dillatroit/Rebirth" EP that most
ly consists of the incredibly smooth plunderphonics tracks JD was known for, combined
with a few tracks from "Rebirth of Detroit," which takes most of the beats from Dillatroit
and adds vocals from local Detroit hip-hop talent. I tend to prefer "Dillatroit" over
"Rebirth" simply because it puts greater focus on the work of the man himself (some
"Rebirth" tracks are just "Dillatroit" tracks with the vocals turned up). "Dillatroit" sounds
like how fans of Dilla's early work like "Donuts" or "Ruff Draft" might expect it to; tracks
are a bit longer and more refined, resulting in a more mature version of the "chopped and
chopped" sound he championed during his career. Put it on for a party and you'll be sure
to see some booty-poppin. Or at least listen to it while writing your RBA.

"LUXURY PROBLEMS"
ANDY STOTT
"Luxury Problems" easily wins my 2012 award for Album I Would Most Like to Have
Sex To ... ladies. Andy Stott's latest release borrows heavily from his earlier work in dub
and minimalist electronic music but swaps out the factory-like groaning and grinding that
backed his down-tempo club beats with vocal samples and cleaner, more ethereal drums.
The album does a fantastic job of establishing its atmosphere and tone early on while con
tinuing to create interesting variations on this theme instead of turning into a four-on-the
floor snooze-fest halfway through the album (as can happen in dub). I personally still enjoy
his earlier release, "Passed Me By," to "Luxury Problems," but that doesn't stop "Luxury
Problems" from being a jam of the year. If this album doesn't make you want to drive
around South London at 2 a.m., I don't know what will. Just get it. It's sexy as hell.




"good kid, m.A.A.d city'"
KENDRICK LAMAR
Let me get this out of the way now: "Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe"
is the worst or second worst track on this album ("Compton" gives
it a run for its money). I'm sorry, but that song is no bueno. With
that said, "good kid, m.A.A.d city" is one of the most refreshing
things I've heard in quite some time. The album art reads, "a short
film by Kendrick Lamar," and that's what it feels like.
There's just so much to praise here: the naturalistic prayers and
conversations interspersed between and within the tracks, the
downbeat production, the smooth, simmering samples and, most
of all, my absolute favorite musical moment of all of 2012: "And if I
die before your album drop — "
In fact, I think I've listened to "Sing About Me / I'm Dying of
Thirst" more than anything else these past few months. Triteness be
damned, this is the best hip-hop album since "My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy."

"KILL FOR LOVE"
CHROMATICS
"Drive," the album. My apologies to those poor souls who
haven't seen Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 stylized neo-noir action
flick, but if you feel the feels of "Drive," then you'll get this album. If
you don't, well, stick with Foster the People — we don't need you!
"Kill for Love" is slow. It's long. The songs take their time. But
it's also synthesizer-heavy dream-pop enshrouded in a mysterious,
sexy, nighttime aura. Hell, even my parents like this album's opening
duo of "Into the Black" (thank you based Neil Young) and "Kill for
Love." And let's be honest here. You haven't really lived until you've
driven 280 in the middle of the night with "Lady" emanating from
your Zipcar, a dimly lit cigarette resting between your pursed lips
and a vague sense of purpose beckoning you from the dark of the
horizon.
