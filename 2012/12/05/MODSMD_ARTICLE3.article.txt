## Faculty, grad students face funding cuts 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MARIANNE LEVINE 
Even as Stanford continues to
bounce back strongly from the impact of
the 2008 recession, renewed uncertainty
about potential cuts in federal spending
may prompt a more serious challenge to
the University's ability to fund faculty
and students in the years ahead.
Federal funding currently accounts
for 84 percent of all sponsored research
at Stanford, which itself constitutes 28
percent of the University's consolidated
revenues. This funding comes from
sources as diverse as the National
Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institute of Health (NIH) and the
Department of Energy (DOE).

Almost all research at the SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory is fed
erally funded by the DOE according to
Andy Freeberg, media relations manag
er at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
Despite the significance of research
funding for the University as a whole,
individual faculty members make grant
applications independently without
administrative supervision.
"Keep in mind the University does
not do research faculty does
research," said Dean of Research Ann Arvin. "The
job of the University is to help them get those grants
submitted and provide the resources they need to do
the work [such as labs and libraries]. We are definite
ly not in the business of reviewing faculty proposals."

Arvin noted that recent federal fiscal retrench
ment has already become evident in increased com
petition among grant applicants who are seeking a
diminished pool of research funds. Stanford's success
rate in obtaining federal grants—which are peer
reviewed at federal agencies is historically about
30 percent.

"Our faculty still continue to do well but as you
can imagine it depends on how many applications you
submit," Arvin said. "If you want to have an active
research lab you have to have two to three research
projects to keep the show on the road. When funding
is tight, the faculty has to submit more grants. It's
not easy these days."

Graduate student funding
Sustained uncertainty about potential cuts in fed
eral spending could have lasting and explicit ramifi
cations for graduate students dependent on research
positions and grants, according to University admin
istrators.

"I think everyone's concerned about what the
model for federal funding is going to be," said Sally
Gressens '74 M.A '77, School of Engineering assis
tant dean for graduate affairs.

While undergraduate students with documented
need receive centrally coordinated financial support
through the Financial Aid Office, graduate students
are instead largely supported through fellowships
and paid positions such as research or teaching
assistantships.

"The thinking tends to be that research funds are
what is going to propel a student through a [doctoral
program]," Gressens said.

"[For] sciences and engineering, you need to have
funding otherwise your students don't have projects
to work on," Arvin added.

External grants and contracts provided 28 per
cent of all graduate support in the 2011-12 fiscal year,
contributing $85.4 million to a total sum of $300.2 mil
lion. Departments more heavily invested in technical
fields have historically been more dependent on fed
eral funding.

"We're concerned that with the federal budget
discussions, we might be facing more serious cuts,"
said Richard Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities
& Sciences. "Our allocations are always interacting
with federal grants [that are] going to individual fac
ulty members."

Sailer pointed to an ongoing trend in diminished
funding from sources like the NlH—which con
tributed to a $1 million reduction this year in the
school's $9O million graduate aid budget as symp
tomatic of potentially more serious issues to come.
"It is a problem," Sailer said. "That doesn't sound
like much, but when you figure in that the cost of liv
ing has increased... there's a4to 5 percent decline in
real purchasing power."

A sustained period of fiscal restraint by the feder
al government may result in a decline in the graduate
population

"We may have to settle for what's been a longer
term base [for H&S], which is around 300," Sailer
said, noting that the school admitted 360 graduate
students this year.

Sailer expressed doubt, however, that the poten
tial for funding cuts will have an immediate detrimen
tal effect on the graduate student population, noting
students' ability to take advantage of other sources of
aid within the University.

"We have thought about what will happen," Sailer
said. "We're not going to leave any students strand
ed."

Norbert Pelc, chair of the Department of
Bioengineering, framed the adjustment in resources
available to support graduate students as reliant on

individual faculty members to implement.
"At this point, [funding cuts] trickle to the individ
ual investigator level more so than the department
level," Pelc said. 'At the department level, we assume
that the individual faculty are keeping track of the
support they have and aren't going to take on more
graduate students unless they're confident they can
support those students."

"We all pitch in to help"
For currently enrolled students, the impact of
funding shortfalls may be alleviated by the realloca
tion of resources between schools and departments,
as well as through fellowships administered by the
Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.

"We try to work collaboratively with the schools in
order to help out," said Vice Provost for Graduate
Education Patricia Gumport M.A. 'B2 MA 'B6 Ph.D.
'B7. "Where it doesn't work, we all pitch in to help."
Gumport cited a diminishing reliance on external
grants and contracts in providing student support, as
well as a doctoral degree completion rate significant
ly above the national average, as evidence of the
University's fiscal commitment to graduate students.
"We're happy to see that we're less dependent,"
Gumport said. "We have a lot to be proud of."
University-wide fiscal retrenching at the height of
the recession, as well as the endowment of 360 grad
uate fellowships through The Stanford Challenge,
have led to a sounder fiscal standing for graduate
programs in the event of heavy cuts, according to
Gumport.

"The University leadership did a great job of lead
ing us through the impact of the recession, setting a
clear path for protecting ourselves and making the
necessary cuts," Gumport said. "The more we have
endowed funds, the less vulnerable we are."
Schools and departments may also contribute
more support than is suggested by the University's
standard budget for graduate students which sug
gests nontuition expenses of $26,082 through three
quarters in the interest of competing against sim
ilar programs at other schools.

"One of the factors in determining [student sup
port] is what other schools are giving to incoming stu
dents," Gumport said.

For some departments, the significance of
research cuts may pale in comparison to the impact of
the recent recession on private sector investment.
"The School [of Engineering] has a lot of support
from industry as well, so we're affected by the eco
nomic climate in any of its pieces," Gressens said.
Arvin expressed optimism that even in the
case of a significant reduction in federal research
funding the historic success of Stanford faculty in
obtaining federal grants might partially insulate
departments and graduate students. She did, howev
er, acknowledge that some internal cuts may still be
required.
"We think we're well positioned to maintain our

programs," Arvin said. "But if the federal govern
ment decides to make an 8 percent cut across the
board, then research funding will be cut by 8 percent
which means that, given the amount of money it takes
to do research, there is not a good substitute for fed
eral funding so certain programs will have to be
smaller."

For both administrators and faculty alike, howev
er, the continuing uncertainty presents obstacles to
effectively minimizing the impact of any cuts.
"No one can predict what will happen," Pelc said.
"In the nightmare scenarios, it would be devastating.
... If [funding] stays flat or goes down a little bit,
that's the best scenario people are envisioning."
"[Cuts] will impact graduate education and we will
have to make that up from other sources," Pelc
added. "We have to hope for the best and remain
competitive."

Even as Stanford continues to
bounce back strongly from the impact of
the 2008 recession, renewed uncertainty
about potential cuts in federal spending
may prompt a more serious challenge to
the University's ability to fund faculty
and students in the years ahead.
Federal funding currently accounts
for 84 percent of all sponsored research
at Stanford, which itself constitutes 28
percent of the University's consolidated
revenues. This funding comes from
sources as diverse as the National
Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institute of Health (NIH) and the
Department of Energy (DOE).

Almost all research at the SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory is fed
erally funded by the DOE according to
Andy Freeberg, media relations manag
er at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
Despite the significance of research
funding for the University as a whole,
individual faculty members make grant
applications independently without
administrative supervision.
"Keep in mind the University does
not do research faculty does
research," said Dean of Research Ann Arvin. "The
job of the University is to help them get those grants
submitted and provide the resources they need to do
the work [such as labs and libraries]. We are definite
ly not in the business of reviewing faculty proposals."

Arvin noted that recent federal fiscal retrench
ment has already become evident in increased com
petition among grant applicants who are seeking a
diminished pool of research funds. Stanford's success
rate in obtaining federal grants—which are peer
reviewed at federal agencies is historically about
30 percent.

"Our faculty still continue to do well but as you
can imagine it depends on how many applications you
submit," Arvin said. "If you want to have an active
research lab you have to have two to three research
projects to keep the show on the road. When funding
is tight, the faculty has to submit more grants. It's
not easy these days."

Graduate student funding
Sustained uncertainty about potential cuts in fed
eral spending could have lasting and explicit ramifi
cations for graduate students dependent on research
positions and grants, according to University admin
istrators.

"I think everyone's concerned about what the
model for federal funding is going to be," said Sally
Gressens '74 M.A '77, School of Engineering assis
tant dean for graduate affairs.

While undergraduate students with documented
need receive centrally coordinated financial support
through the Financial Aid Office, graduate students
are instead largely supported through fellowships
and paid positions such as research or teaching
assistantships.

"The thinking tends to be that research funds are
what is going to propel a student through a [doctoral
program]," Gressens said.

"[For] sciences and engineering, you need to have
funding otherwise your students don't have projects
to work on," Arvin added.

External grants and contracts provided 28 per
cent of all graduate support in the 2011-12 fiscal year,
contributing $85.4 million to a total sum of $300.2 mil
lion. Departments more heavily invested in technical
fields have historically been more dependent on fed
eral funding.

"We're concerned that with the federal budget
discussions, we might be facing more serious cuts,"
said Richard Sailer, dean of the School of Humanities
& Sciences. "Our allocations are always interacting
with federal grants [that are] going to individual fac
ulty members."

Sailer pointed to an ongoing trend in diminished
funding from sources like the NlH—which con
tributed to a $1 million reduction this year in the
school's $9O million graduate aid budget as symp
tomatic of potentially more serious issues to come.
"It is a problem," Sailer said. "That doesn't sound
like much, but when you figure in that the cost of liv
ing has increased... there's a4to 5 percent decline in
real purchasing power."

A sustained period of fiscal restraint by the feder
al government may result in a decline in the graduate
population

"We may have to settle for what's been a longer
term base [for H&S], which is around 300," Sailer
said, noting that the school admitted 360 graduate
students this year.

Sailer expressed doubt, however, that the poten
tial for funding cuts will have an immediate detrimen
tal effect on the graduate student population, noting
students' ability to take advantage of other sources of
aid within the University.

"We have thought about what will happen," Sailer
said. "We're not going to leave any students strand
ed."

Norbert Pelc, chair of the Department of
Bioengineering, framed the adjustment in resources
available to support graduate students as reliant on

individual faculty members to implement.
"At this point, [funding cuts] trickle to the individ
ual investigator level more so than the department
level," Pelc said. 'At the department level, we assume
that the individual faculty are keeping track of the
support they have and aren't going to take on more
graduate students unless they're confident they can
support those students."

"We all pitch in to help"
For currently enrolled students, the impact of
funding shortfalls may be alleviated by the realloca
tion of resources between schools and departments,
as well as through fellowships administered by the
Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.

"We try to work collaboratively with the schools in
order to help out," said Vice Provost for Graduate
Education Patricia Gumport M.A. 'B2 MA 'B6 Ph.D.
'B7. "Where it doesn't work, we all pitch in to help."
Gumport cited a diminishing reliance on external
grants and contracts in providing student support, as
well as a doctoral degree completion rate significant
ly above the national average, as evidence of the
University's fiscal commitment to graduate students.
"We're happy to see that we're less dependent,"
Gumport said. "We have a lot to be proud of."
University-wide fiscal retrenching at the height of
the recession, as well as the endowment of 360 grad
uate fellowships through The Stanford Challenge,
have led to a sounder fiscal standing for graduate
programs in the event of heavy cuts, according to
Gumport.

"The University leadership did a great job of lead
ing us through the impact of the recession, setting a
clear path for protecting ourselves and making the
necessary cuts," Gumport said. "The more we have
endowed funds, the less vulnerable we are."
Schools and departments may also contribute
more support than is suggested by the University's
standard budget for graduate students which sug
gests nontuition expenses of $26,082 through three
quarters in the interest of competing against sim
ilar programs at other schools.

"One of the factors in determining [student sup
port] is what other schools are giving to incoming stu
dents," Gumport said.

For some departments, the significance of
research cuts may pale in comparison to the impact of
the recent recession on private sector investment.
"The School [of Engineering] has a lot of support
from industry as well, so we're affected by the eco
nomic climate in any of its pieces," Gressens said.
Arvin expressed optimism that even in the
case of a significant reduction in federal research
funding the historic success of Stanford faculty in
obtaining federal grants might partially insulate
departments and graduate students. She did, howev
er, acknowledge that some internal cuts may still be
required.

endowed funds, the less vulnerable we are."
Schools and departments may also contribute
more support than is suggested by the University's
standard budget for graduate students which sug
gests nontuition expenses of $26,082 through three
quarters in the interest of competing against sim
ilar programs at other schools.

"One of the factors in determining [student sup
port] is what other schools are giving to incoming stu
dents," Gumport said.

For some departments, the significance of
research cuts may pale in comparison to the impact of
the recent recession on private sector investment.
"The School [of Engineering] has a lot of support
from industry as well, so we're affected by the eco
nomic climate in any of its pieces," Gressens said.
Arvin expressed optimism that even in the
case of a significant reduction in federal research
funding the historic success of Stanford faculty in
obtaining federal grants might partially insulate
departments and graduate students. She did, howev
er, acknowledge that some internal cuts may still be
required.
"We think we're well positioned to maintain our

programs," Arvin said. "But if the federal govern
ment decides to make an 8 percent cut across the
board, then research funding will be cut by 8 percent
which means that, given the amount of money it takes
to do research, there is not a good substitute for fed
eral funding so certain programs will have to be
smaller."

For both administrators and faculty alike, howev
er, the continuing uncertainty presents obstacles to
effectively minimizing the impact of any cuts.
"No one can predict what will happen," Pelc said.
"In the nightmare scenarios, it would be devastating.
... If [funding] stays flat or goes down a little bit,
that's the best scenario people are envisioning."
"[Cuts] will impact graduate education and we will
have to make that up from other sources," Pelc
added. "We have to hope for the best and remain
competitive."
