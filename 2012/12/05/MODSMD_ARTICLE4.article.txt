# RAINING ROSES
## Stanford beats UCLA to win Pac-12 Championship 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Where Andrew Luck and
Jim Harbaugh failed,
Kevin Hogan and David
Shaw delivered. On a wet
night at Stanford
Stadium, redshirt freshman quarterback
Hogan did just enough on offense and Shaw
put his faith in kicker Jordan Williamson,
who came through with a game-winning 36-
yard field goal with five minutes left in the
fourth quarter. Williamson's second game
winning kick in three weeks broke a 24-24
tie with No. 17 UCLA (9-4) and sent No. 8
Stanford (11-2) to the Rose Bowl as Pae-12
champions, something former Stanford
head coach Harbaugh and Ail-American
quarterback Luck couldn't do.

As the rain came down at a half-full
Stanford Stadium, the Bruins jumped on
the Cardinal early in a rematch of last
Saturday's regular-season contest, a
Stanford win that was rather one-sided by
the end. On Friday, however, running back
Johnathan Franklin gashed the vaunted
Cardinal defense for several big runs,
including a 51-yard touchdown on the open
ing drive to serve notice that this week
would be no cakewalk for Stanford.

The Cardinal responded quickly, howev
er, with Stepfan Taylor doing some nice
running of his own and Hogan fooling
three-fourths of the stadium on a naked
bootleg that let him stroll into the end zone
to even the score at 7. It looked like the
game might be setting up for a shootout, as
Bruins quarterback Brett Hundley moved
UCLA right back down the field and into
the end zone put the visitors up 14-7 with
3:40 to play in the first quarter.
And UCLA seemed the aggressor, shov
ing the ball down Stanford's throat on the
ground with Franklin and Hundley and
winning at the point of attack against the
Cardinal's offensive line. The Stanford
defense seemed taken aback as well, not
surprisingly as the Card had allowed just

20 points in the first quarter through the
first 12 games of the season.
When the Bruins stopped Stanford and
began driving into Cardinal territory, it
seemed as though UCLA was firmly in the
driver's seat and that coach Jim Mora was
pushing all the right buttons on his way to
an upset. But an interception by junior
safety Ed Reynolds, his conference-leading

sixth of the year, was an absolute game
changer.
Reynolds came across the field and
picked off Hundley's underthrown pass
around the 20-yard line, coming up inches
short of a touchdown after a spectacular
return.

"When you get a game-changing play
like that, you have a good chance to win,"

Shaw said, "because if the rest of the game
is played even, that one is the one that tips
it in your favor."
A quick one-yard touchdown from
Taylor knotted things at 14 and stemmed
the tide that threatened to knock Stanford
out of a BCS bowl.

Stanford head coach David Shaw (above) basks in the glow of the Cardinal's 27-24
win over UCLA in Friday's Pac-12 Championship Game, holding a bouquet of roses
in anticipation of Stanford's invitation to the Rose Bowl.
The game settled down,
however, as the defenses held
then- ground and it became
quite clear that neither side
was willing to take many
deep shots in the air. Hogan
finished 16 for 22 for 155
yards, but his leading receiv
er was Taylor on a multitude
of check downs and few pass
es traveled more than 10
yards down the field. UCLA
limited the effectiveness of
tight ends Levine Toilolo and
Zach Ertz, who made just
four combined catches for 25
yards.

Stanford went into the
break with the lead thanks to
Williamson, who looked calm
and confident in drilling a 37-
yard field goal as time
expired in the half.
"He's been money," Shaw
said of his kicker. "He's been
really good, he's got his rou
tine down, he's confident, he's
consistent, and that's all I
ever say to him. I just need
him to be smooth and consis
tent, and that's where he is
right now."
The second-quarter kick
was preceded by a 10-yard
run from Taylor that set the
Stanford career record for
rushing yards, moving the
Mansfield, Texas, native past
Darrin Nelson's mark of
4,175, which had stood since
1981.

The Cardinal needed
every one of Taylor's yards,
with Franklin putting up 203
on just 19 carries and
Hundley adding 98 of his own.
Shaw was one of those very
impressed with the UCLA
performance on the road.
"We were going to get
their best shot, and they gave
it to us," he said. "Their quar
terback played great. Boy,
he's hard to tackle. Their run
ning back made some big
runs, their running back
made big plays and they
made big stops on defense,

but our guys hung in there."

Stanford received the sec
ond-half kick but could do
nothing with it. The offensive
line continued to do well in
pass protection but failed to
come up with any serious
push in the ground game. The
Cardinal gained just 170
yards on the ground on the
evening, but that production
came on 43 attempts and it
was anything but easy run
ning for Taylor throughout
the night.

A Ka'imi Fairbairn field
goal pulled UCLA even at 17,
and the Bruins continued to
run the ball well with
Franklin breaking free for a
20-yard touchdown to cap a
12-play, 80-yard drive just
before the end of the third
quarter.

The Stanford students,
who absolutely jam-packed
the Red Zone, held their
heads in their hands as the
fourth quarter approached
with the Cardinal down a
score.

But Hogan found away,
driving the Cardinal back
down the field for an immedi
ate and impressive answer.
Facing a third-and-15 on the
Bruins' 26-yard line, Hogan
lofted a ball just beyond a
UCLA cornerback's finger
tips and into the waiting
arms of receiver Drew
Terrell for a game-tying
touchdown.
"There were four verti
cals ...and Drew ran into
that end zone, and Kevin
held onto the ball to hold the
safety inside as long as he
could," Shaw said. "He threw
the ball, took a big hit, and it
was a great throw, and a
huge catch and a big play for
us."

The always-even-keeled
Hogan said that he saw
Terrell sneak past the corner
and get into the back of the
end zone on the play, before
the quarterback found him
self looking at the sky from
his backside.
But that heroic strike
merely tied the score with
plenty of game remaining.

A couple of stalled drives
on either side led to a UCLA
punt that Terrell returned 18
yards into Bruin territory
with a little over eight min
utes to go in the game. Shaw
then called Kelsey Young's
number on a sweep out of
the wildcat formation, which
went for 23 yards and put
the Cardinal firmly in field
goal position. From there it
was all on Williamson's right
leg, and his kick from 36
yards easily sailed through
and sent the crowd into a
frenzy.
Despite an announced
attendance of just over 31,000
fans, the raucous students,
who filled nine sections on
their own, had the near side
of the field sounding just
about as loud as any stadium
in the conference usually gets.

UCLA couldn't convert on
third down on its ensuing
drive, handing the ball back to
Stanford with a few minutes
remaining. But the Cardinal
couldn't run the clock out
when Levine Toilolo was
unable to handle a third-down
pass, giving the Bruins one
last chance.

A fourth-down pass to
tight end Joseph Fauria kept
UCLA's drive alive with
under a minute to play and
the fans on their feet, but
a potentially game-tying 52-
yard field goal attempt by the
Fairbairn went wide left with
39 seconds left and the stadi
um was smelling roses.

It came down to "charac
ter," said Shaw, the Pac-12
Coach of the Year in his first
two seasons. "Even when we
don't play well, we still play
hard. Our guys played with
such heart. We made plays
when we needed to make
plays."

Stanford will take
Wisconsin, the winner of the
Big-10 Championship Game,
in the Cardinal's first Rose
Bowl since the 1999 season,
to be held in Pasadena on
Jan. 1.

right now."
The second-quarter kick
was preceded by a 10-yard
run from Taylor that set the
Stanford career record for
rushing yards, moving the
Mansfield, Texas, native past
Darrin Nelson's mark of
4,175, which had stood since
1981.

The Cardinal needed
every one of Taylor's yards,
with Franklin putting up 203
on just 19 carries and
Hundley adding 98 of his own.
Shaw was one of those very
impressed with the UCLA
performance on the road.
"We were going to get
their best shot, and they gave
it to us," he said. "Their quar
terback played great. Boy,
he's hard to tackle. Their run
ning back made some big
runs, their running back
made big plays and they
made big stops on defense,

but our guys hung in there."

Stanford received the sec
ond-half kick but could do
nothing with it. The offensive
line continued to do well in
pass protection but failed to
come up with any serious
push in the ground game. The
Cardinal gained just 170
yards on the ground on the
evening, but that production
came on 43 attempts and it
was anything but easy run
ning for Taylor throughout
the night.

A Ka'imi Fairbairn field
goal pulled UCLA even at 17,
and the Bruins continued to
run the ball well with
Franklin breaking free for a
20-yard touchdown to cap a
12-play, 80-yard drive just
before the end of the third
quarter.

The Stanford students,
who absolutely jam-packed
the Red Zone, held their
heads in their hands as the
fourth quarter approached
with the Cardinal down a
score.

But Hogan found away,
driving the Cardinal back
down the field for an immedi
ate and impressive answer.
Facing a third-and-15 on the
Bruins' 26-yard line, Hogan
lofted a ball just beyond a
UCLA cornerback's finger
tips and into the waiting
arms of receiver Drew
Terrell for a game-tying
touchdown.
"There were four verti
cals ...and Drew ran into
that end zone, and Kevin
held onto the ball to hold the
safety inside as long as he
could," Shaw said. "He threw
the ball, took a big hit, and it
was a great throw, and a
huge catch and a big play for
us."

The always-even-keeled
Hogan said that he saw
Terrell sneak past the corner
and get into the back of the
end zone on the play, before
the quarterback found him
self looking at the sky from
his backside.
But that heroic strike
merely tied the score with
plenty of game remaining.

A couple of stalled drives
on either side led to a UCLA
punt that Terrell returned 18
yards into Bruin territory
with a little over eight min
utes to go in the game. Shaw
then called Kelsey Young's
number on a sweep out of
the wildcat formation, which
went for 23 yards and put
the Cardinal firmly in field
goal position. From there it
was all on Williamson's right
leg, and his kick from 36
yards easily sailed through
and sent the crowd into a
frenzy.
Despite an announced
attendance of just over 31,000
fans, the raucous students,
who filled nine sections on
their own, had the near side
of the field sounding just
about as loud as any stadium
in the conference usually gets.

UCLA couldn't convert on
third down on its ensuing
drive, handing the ball back to
Stanford with a few minutes
remaining. But the Cardinal
couldn't run the clock out
when Levine Toilolo was
unable to handle a third-down
pass, giving the Bruins one
last chance.

A fourth-down pass to
tight end Joseph Fauria kept
UCLA's drive alive with
under a minute to play and
the fans on their feet, but
a potentially game-tying 52-
yard field goal attempt by the
Fairbairn went wide left with
39 seconds left and the stadi
um was smelling roses.

It came down to "charac
ter," said Shaw, the Pac-12
Coach of the Year in his first
two seasons. "Even when we
don't play well, we still play
hard. Our guys played with
such heart. We made plays
when we needed to make
plays."

Stanford will take
Wisconsin, the winner of the
Big-10 Championship Game,
in the Cardinal's first Rose
Bowl since the 1999 season,
to be held in Pasadena on
Jan. 1.

Where Andrew Luck and
Jim Harbaugh failed,
Kevin Hogan and David
Shaw delivered. On a wet
night at Stanford
Stadium, redshirt freshman quarterback
Hogan did just enough on offense and Shaw
put his faith in kicker Jordan Williamson,
who came through with a game-winning 36-
yard field goal with five minutes left in the
fourth quarter. Williamson's second game
winning kick in three weeks broke a 24-24
tie with No. 17 UCLA (9-4) and sent No. 8
Stanford (11-2) to the Rose Bowl as Pae-12
champions, something former Stanford
head coach Harbaugh and Ail-American
quarterback Luck couldn't do.

As the rain came down at a half-full
Stanford Stadium, the Bruins jumped on
the Cardinal early in a rematch of last
Saturday's regular-season contest, a
Stanford win that was rather one-sided by
the end. On Friday, however, running back
Johnathan Franklin gashed the vaunted
Cardinal defense for several big runs,
including a 51-yard touchdown on the open
ing drive to serve notice that this week
would be no cakewalk for Stanford.

The Cardinal responded quickly, howev
er, with Stepfan Taylor doing some nice
running of his own and Hogan fooling
three-fourths of the stadium on a naked
bootleg that let him stroll into the end zone
to even the score at 7. It looked like the
game might be setting up for a shootout, as
Bruins quarterback Brett Hundley moved
UCLA right back down the field and into
the end zone put the visitors up 14-7 with
3:40 to play in the first quarter.
And UCLA seemed the aggressor, shov
ing the ball down Stanford's throat on the
ground with Franklin and Hundley and
winning at the point of attack against the
Cardinal's offensive line. The Stanford
defense seemed taken aback as well, not
surprisingly as the Card had allowed just

20 points in the first quarter through the
first 12 games of the season.
When the Bruins stopped Stanford and
began driving into Cardinal territory, it
seemed as though UCLA was firmly in the
driver's seat and that coach Jim Mora was
pushing all the right buttons on his way to
an upset. But an interception by junior
safety Ed Reynolds, his conference-leading

sixth of the year, was an absolute game
changer.
Reynolds came across the field and
picked off Hundley's underthrown pass
around the 20-yard line, coming up inches
short of a touchdown after a spectacular
return.

"When you get a game-changing play
like that, you have a good chance to win,"

Shaw said, "because if the rest of the game
is played even, that one is the one that tips
it in your favor."
A quick one-yard touchdown from
Taylor knotted things at 14 and stemmed
the tide that threatened to knock Stanford
out of a BCS bowl.

Stanford head coach David Shaw (above) basks in the glow of the Cardinal's 27-24
win over UCLA in Friday's Pac-12 Championship Game, holding a bouquet of roses
in anticipation of Stanford's invitation to the Rose Bowl.
The game settled down,
however, as the defenses held
then- ground and it became
quite clear that neither side
was willing to take many
deep shots in the air. Hogan
finished 16 for 22 for 155
yards, but his leading receiv
er was Taylor on a multitude
of check downs and few pass
es traveled more than 10
yards down the field. UCLA
limited the effectiveness of
tight ends Levine Toilolo and
Zach Ertz, who made just
four combined catches for 25
yards.

Stanford went into the
break with the lead thanks to
Williamson, who looked calm
and confident in drilling a 37-
yard field goal as time
expired in the half.
"He's been money," Shaw
said of his kicker. "He's been
really good, he's got his rou
tine down, he's confident, he's

Coach of the Year in his first
two seasons. "Even when we
don't play well, we still play
hard. Our guys played with
such heart. We made plays
when we needed to make
plays."

Stanford will take
Wisconsin, the winner of the
Big-10 Championship Game,
in the Cardinal's first Rose
Bowl since the 1999 season,
to be held in Pasadena on
Jan. 1.

Where Andrew Luck and
Jim Harbaugh failed,
Kevin Hogan and David
Shaw delivered. On a wet
night at Stanford
Stadium, redshirt freshman quarterback
Hogan did just enough on offense and Shaw
put his faith in kicker Jordan Williamson,
who came through with a game-winning 36-
yard field goal with five minutes left in the
fourth quarter. Williamson's second game
winning kick in three weeks broke a 24-24
tie with No. 17 UCLA (9-4) and sent No. 8
Stanford (11-2) to the Rose Bowl as Pae-12
champions, something former Stanford
head coach Harbaugh and Ail-American
quarterback Luck couldn't do.

As the rain came down at a half-full
Stanford Stadium, the Bruins jumped on
the Cardinal early in a rematch of last
Saturday's regular-season contest, a
Stanford win that was rather one-sided by
the end. On Friday, however, running back
Johnathan Franklin gashed the vaunted
Cardinal defense for several big runs,
including a 51-yard touchdown on the open
ing drive to serve notice that this week
would be no cakewalk for Stanford.

The Cardinal responded quickly, howev
er, with Stepfan Taylor doing some nice
running of his own and Hogan fooling
three-fourths of the stadium on a naked
bootleg that let him stroll into the end zone
to even the score at 7. It looked like the
game might be setting up for a shootout, as
Bruins quarterback Brett Hundley moved
UCLA right back down the field and into
the end zone put the visitors up 14-7 with
3:40 to play in the first quarter.
And UCLA seemed the aggressor, shov
ing the ball down Stanford's throat on the
ground with Franklin and Hundley and
winning at the point of attack against the
Cardinal's offensive line. The Stanford
defense seemed taken aback as well, not
surprisingly as the Card had allowed just

20 points in the first quarter through the
first 12 games of the season.
When the Bruins stopped Stanford and
began driving into Cardinal territory, it
seemed as though UCLA was firmly in the
driver's seat and that coach Jim Mora was
pushing all the right buttons on his way to
an upset. But an interception by junior
safety Ed Reynolds, his conference-leading

sixth of the year, was an absolute game
changer.
Reynolds came across the field and
picked off Hundley's underthrown pass
around the 20-yard line, coming up inches
short of a touchdown after a spectacular
return.

"When you get a game-changing play
like that, you have a good chance to win,"

Shaw said, "because if the rest of the game
is played even, that one is the one that tips
it in your favor."
A quick one-yard touchdown from
Taylor knotted things at 14 and stemmed
the tide that threatened to knock Stanford
out of a BCS bowl.

Mike Kheir/The Stanford Daily
Stanford head coach David Shaw (above) basks in the glow of the Cardinal's 27-24
win over UCLA in Friday's Pac-12 Championship Game, holding a bouquet of roses
in anticipation of Stanford's invitation to the Rose Bowl.
The game settled down,
however, as the defenses held
then- ground and it became
quite clear that neither side
was willing to take many
deep shots in the air. Hogan
finished 16 for 22 for 155
yards, but his leading receiv
er was Taylor on a multitude
of check downs and few pass
es traveled more than 10
yards down the field. UCLA
limited the effectiveness of
tight ends Levine Toilolo and
Zach Ertz, who made just
four combined catches for 25
yards.

Stanford went into the
break with the lead thanks to
Williamson, who looked calm
and confident in drilling a 37-
yard field goal as time
expired in the half.
"He's been money," Shaw
said of his kicker. "He's been
really good, he's got his rou
tine down, he's confident, he's
consistent, and that's all I
ever say to him. I just need
him to be smooth and consis
tent, and that's where he is
right now."
The second-quarter kick
was preceded by a 10-yard
run from Taylor that set the
Stanford career record for
rushing yards, moving the
Mansfield, Texas, native past
Darrin Nelson's mark of
4,175, which had stood since
1981.

The Cardinal needed
every one of Taylor's yards,
with Franklin putting up 203
on just 19 carries and
Hundley adding 98 of his own.
Shaw was one of those very
impressed with the UCLA
performance on the road.
"We were going to get
their best shot, and they gave
it to us," he said. "Their quar
terback played great. Boy,
he's hard to tackle. Their run
ning back made some big
runs, their running back
made big plays and they
made big stops on defense,

but our guys hung in there."

Stanford received the sec
ond-half kick but could do
nothing with it. The offensive
line continued to do well in
pass protection but failed to
come up with any serious
push in the ground game. The
Cardinal gained just 170
yards on the ground on the
evening, but that production
came on 43 attempts and it
was anything but easy run
ning for Taylor throughout
the night.

A Ka'imi Fairbairn field
goal pulled UCLA even at 17,
and the Bruins continued to
run the ball well with
Franklin breaking free for a
20-yard touchdown to cap a
12-play, 80-yard drive just
before the end of the third
quarter.

The Stanford students,
who absolutely jam-packed
the Red Zone, held their
heads in their hands as the
fourth quarter approached
with the Cardinal down a
score.

But Hogan found away,
driving the Cardinal back
down the field for an immedi
ate and impressive answer.
Facing a third-and-15 on the
Bruins' 26-yard line, Hogan
lofted a ball just beyond a
UCLA cornerback's finger
tips and into the waiting
arms of receiver Drew
Terrell for a game-tying
touchdown.
"There were four verti
cals ...and Drew ran into
that end zone, and Kevin
held onto the ball to hold the
safety inside as long as he
could," Shaw said. "He threw
the ball, took a big hit, and it
was a great throw, and a
huge catch and a big play for
us."

The always-even-keeled
Hogan said that he saw
Terrell sneak past the corner
and get into the back of the
end zone on the play, before
the quarterback found him
self looking at the sky from
his backside.
But that heroic strike
merely tied the score with
plenty of game remaining.

A couple of stalled drives
on either side led to a UCLA
punt that Terrell returned 18
yards into Bruin territory
with a little over eight min
utes to go in the game. Shaw
then called Kelsey Young's
number on a sweep out of
the wildcat formation, which
went for 23 yards and put
the Cardinal firmly in field
goal position. From there it
was all on Williamson's right
leg, and his kick from 36
yards easily sailed through
and sent the crowd into a
frenzy.
Despite an announced
attendance of just over 31,000
fans, the raucous students,
who filled nine sections on
their own, had the near side
of the field sounding just
about as loud as any stadium
in the conference usually gets.

UCLA couldn't convert on
third down on its ensuing
drive, handing the ball back to
Stanford with a few minutes
remaining. But the Cardinal
couldn't run the clock out
when Levine Toilolo was
unable to handle a third-down
pass, giving the Bruins one
last chance.

A fourth-down pass to
tight end Joseph Fauria kept
UCLA's drive alive with
under a minute to play and
the fans on their feet, but
a potentially game-tying 52-
yard field goal attempt by the
Fairbairn went wide left with
39 seconds left and the stadi
um was smelling roses.

It came down to "charac
ter," said Shaw, the Pac-12
Coach of the Year in his first
two seasons. "Even when we
don't play well, we still play
hard. Our guys played with
such heart. We made plays
when we needed to make
plays."

Stanford will take
Wisconsin, the winner of the
Big-10 Championship Game,
in the Cardinal's first Rose
Bowl since the 1999 season,
to be held in Pasadena on
Jan. 1.
