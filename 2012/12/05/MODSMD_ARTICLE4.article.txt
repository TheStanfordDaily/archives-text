# RAINING ROSES
## Stanford beats UCLA to win Pac-12 Championship 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Where Andrew Luck and
Jim Harbaugh failed,
Kevin Hogan and David
Shaw delivered. On a wet
night at Stanford
Stadium, redshirt freshman quarterback
Hogan did just enough on offense and Shaw
put his faith in kicker Jordan Williamson,
who came through with a game-winning 36-
yard field goal with five minutes left in the
fourth quarter. Williamson's second game
winning kick in three weeks broke a 24-24
tie with No. 17 UCLA (9-4) and sent No. 8
Stanford (11-2) to the Rose Bowl as Pae-12
champions, something former Stanford
head coach Harbaugh and Ail-American
quarterback Luck couldn't do.

As the rain came down at a half-full
Stanford Stadium, the Bruins jumped on
the Cardinal early in a rematch of last
Saturday's regular-season contest, a
Stanford win that was rather one-sided by
the end. On Friday, however, running back
Johnathan Franklin gashed the vaunted
Cardinal defense for several big runs,
including a 51-yard touchdown on the open
ing drive to serve notice that this week
would be no cakewalk for Stanford.

The Cardinal responded quickly, howev
er, with Stepfan Taylor doing some nice
running of his own and Hogan fooling
three-fourths of the stadium on a naked
bootleg that let him stroll into the end zone
to even the score at 7. It looked like the
game might be setting up for a shootout, as
Bruins quarterback Brett Hundley moved
UCLA right back down the field and into
the end zone put the visitors up 14-7 with
3:40 to play in the first quarter.
And UCLA seemed the aggressor, shov
ing the ball down Stanford's throat on the
ground with Franklin and Hundley and
winning at the point of attack against the
Cardinal's offensive line. The Stanford
defense seemed taken aback as well, not
surprisingly as the Card had allowed just

20 points in the first quarter through the
first 12 games of the season.
When the Bruins stopped Stanford and
began driving into Cardinal territory, it
seemed as though UCLA was firmly in the
driver's seat and that coach Jim Mora was
pushing all the right buttons on his way to
an upset. But an interception by junior
safety Ed Reynolds, his conference-leading

sixth of the year, was an absolute game
changer.
Reynolds came across the field and
picked off Hundley's underthrown pass
around the 20-yard line, coming up inches
short of a touchdown after a spectacular
return.

"When you get a game-changing play
like that, you have a good chance to win,"

Shaw said, "because if the rest of the game
is played even, that one is the one that tips
it in your favor."
A quick one-yard touchdown from
Taylor knotted things at 14 and stemmed
the tide that threatened to knock Stanford
out of a BCS bowl.
