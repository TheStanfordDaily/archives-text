## Undergrads navigate student loans 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The idea of taking out loans was consid
ered taboo in Monica Alcazar's family.
"I grew up in a Mexican household and it
was always like 'Don't get yourself in debt,"'
Alcazar 'l3 said.

But when Alcazar's parents decided they
weren't going to support her Stanford educa
tion after she came out to them about her
sexuality, Alcazar now a financially inde

pendent student had to turn to loans. She
started taking out federal loans, including
Federal Perkins Loans, during her junior
year. She will graduate with about $ll,OOO in
debt and has to forfeit the option of graduate
school to be able to pay it off.
"I thought I had a narrowly defined,
direct trajectory of what my education
process was going to look like and now it's
been interrupted because I've taken out
loans," she said.
Alisa Royer 'll works as a
conservation biologist at the
Stanford Department of
Land, Buildings and Real
Estate paying off a $30,000
principal debt from three pri
vate loans.

Because her parents'
expected contribution did not
qualify for need-based finan
cial aid, and her younger
brother started college soon
after she did, taking out loans
also did not feel like a choice.

"Paying it outright would
have caused serious problems
for my parents so I felt like
loans was not a choice," Royer,
who is a Daily photo editor, said.
"It was pretty much a require
ment; if not in writing, in prac
tice it felt like a requirement."
Though Alcazar and
Royer's situations match
national stories on increasing
numbers of students graduat
ing with larger debt, they are
a minority on Stanford cam
pus for having taken out loans
in the first place.

The debt landscape
Compared to national sta
tistics showing the number of
college students graduating
with loans increasing within
the last few years, Stanford
defies the trend with only 25
percent of the class of 2012
graduating with debt.
Beginning around 2009,
the proportion of Stanford
graduates with debt from fed
eral and private loans dropped
from the average 44.4 percent
of years prior to 36 percent
and then well down to 25 per
cent last year.
Conversely, the average
indebtedness of Stanford
graduates has seen increases
from $15,724 in 2008 to
$18,883 in 2012. However, the
average remains below the
2011 national average debt of
$26,600 according to The
Institute for College Access
and Success (TICAS).
Karen Cooper, director of
financial aid, said that the new
need-based financial aid pro
gram— implemented in the
2008-09 school year —is in
large part responsible for the
decreasing percentage of
Stanford students taking out
loans.

The new program does not

expect students to take out
loans as part of them financial
aid package. It also reduces
the expected parent contribu
tion to zero for families mak
ing less than $60,000 a year
and eliminates tuition pay
ments for parents earning less
than $lOO,OOO a year.
Cooper explained that the
average dollar amount of debt
has increased because the pool
of borrowers has decreased
and the few that remain bor
row more. She added that
many of the students borrow
ing are from socio-economic
backgrounds where families do
not qualify for need-based
financial aid.
"The main reason students
here at Stanford borrow is to
help parents with the expected
parent contribution," Cooper
said.

However, not all the 25 per
cent of borrowers come from
more affluent socioeconomic
backgrounds.
While high-earning families
tend to take out more private
loans than federal loans, there
are several reasons students
who qualify for large institu
tional grants still opt for feder
al loans.

Multi-faceted reasons

According to Cooper, under
the new financial aid program
many students are eligible for
low-cost federal loans with
yearly maximums, meaning
there is a limit to how much
they can borrow.

Diana Gonzalez 'l3 has

used the Federal Perkins Loan
every year since freshman
year and will graduate with
about $7,000 of debt.
Even though Gonzalez's
parent contribution is zero, she
still relies on the loans to pay
for extra expenses not covered
by financial aid, like books and
dorm supplies.
'After all my financial aid is
taken care of, the refund that I
get is veiy little and it's not
enough for me to survive for
the quarter so the loan helps
with that," Gonzalez said.
Cooper said that students
with a financial aid package
like Gonzalez's would typically
use loans to cover their
expected student contribution
that they may choose to fulfill
through federal work-study or
outside scholarships.
Though the current finan
cial aid policy makes loans
more of a personal option
varying between individual
families, for some students
whose parents still qualify for
need-based aid, loans may be
required as with Alcazar.
The process of reapplying
for financial aid as an inde
pendent student was frustrat
ing, Alcazar said, but with the
help of an LGBT liaison in the
financial aid office she was
able to sift through the paper
work and figure out what
loans she would need to take
on to finish her degree.
"The worst thing you
could do was take out loans for
higher education but it's
because I've been able to take

out these loans that I can even
have a higher education,"
Alcazar said.
While Gonzalez and
Alcazar are anxious about hav
ing to graduate with debt and
how they will pay off the debt,
they have some safeguards to
rely on because they opted for
federal, not private loans.
Federal versus private
When students choose to
take out loans at Stanford, the
financial aid office first recom
mends federal loans and
insists on federal loans even
when providing information
on private alternatives.
Cooper points out that fed
eral direct loans have high
interest rates when compared
to private education loans and
they have annual maximums.
However, private loans can
have variable rates that may
increase over time and do not
have any repayment safe
guards in place like federal
options.
The Federal Perkins Loan
is unsubsidized meaning it
does not incur interest while a
student works on her degree
and students can wait until
after graduation to pay it off.
Additionally, when tuition
rises, students taking out pri
vate loans may accumulate
more debt whereas those eligi
ble and taking out federal loans
can find solace in institutional
grant funding that matches
tuition increases.
Ihition rose 3 percent for
the 2012-13 school year but
institutional grant funding in
the financial aid budget rose
with it.
The previous financial aid
policy which applied to
Royer when she was admitted
expected students to take
on loans as paid of their aid
package. The new process that
took place is not retroactive, so
the University could not help
Royer with her previously
incurred loans.

Royer's family falls into the
categoiy of students that Cooper
said are more likely to go for pri
vate loans than federal.

"Students who are using
the private loans, I can say
very comfortably, those are not
our students who are coming
from low income back
grounds," Cooper said.

"Those are students who
are coming from more affluent
backgrounds and it's family
choices that a driving whether
or not they are taking those
private loans," she added.
When looking back at the
process Royer felt that even
though she was expected to
take on loans from the begin
ning, she did not get the kind of
guidance Alcazar found at the
financial aid office but the
Student Services Center
(SSE) helped her deal with any
student bill complications.
"Everyone pretty much
tells you [Student Services
Center] is where you need to
go," Royer said.
Helen Grieco, the Northern
California organizer for
California Common Cause

nonpartisan, bipartisan citi
zen's lobby group that offers
college students activist train
ing for democratic reform,
including the topic of higher
education said that students
with private loans face a
greater risk.
"Private companies are in
it to make money where you're
seen as the consumer," Grieco
said.

Based on her experience
working with students in debt,
Grieco said that students need
to be calculating and cautious
in taking on any type of loan,
especially when thinking
about the financial conse
quences they will face.

Stanford silver lining
As the percentage of stu
dents facing debt at Stanford
decreases, the national statis
tics continue to trend toward
more students facing larger
debt amounts.

Grieco said that 75 percent

of the Stanford class graduat
ing debt-free is "not the
norm." According to TICAS
statistics, 51 percent of
California college students at
both public and private insti
tutions graduate with debt.
Though education costs
are rising, there is still evi
dence that getting a college
education is economically
advantageous.
A report published by the
Georgetown University Public
Policy Institute on Aug. 15
revealed that the unemploy
ment rate for recent four-year
college graduates is 6.8 per
cent compared to the 24 per
cent unemployment rate for
high school graduates.
On the matter of getting a
job to pay off debt, Grieco said
Stanford graduates have a
"silver lining."
This year, when Stanford
faced a 5 percent decrease in
Cal Grant funding, the finan
cial office was able to offset
that with more institutional
grant funding totaling $l3O
million. There is also the bene
fit of a Stanford degree that
Grieco said will help graduates
find a job faster, and ideally
pay off debt quicker.

Gonzalez considers
Stanford's financial aid pro
gram a blessing and recog
nizes Grieco's emphasis on the
Stanford degree, including for
those on private loans.
"Even though they have a
lot of debt, the ball's in their
court where they're going to
be able to find a better job or
more quickly than someone
who graduated from a state
school," Gonzalez said.
