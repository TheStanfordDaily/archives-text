## Community centers undergo first review Assessment comes after budget cuts during 2008-09 economic downturn 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
For the first time in their 40-plus year history,
Stanford's six community centers are undergoing a review
and assessment by Student Affairs. The review is the lat
est in a string of reviews conducted by Student Affair's,
which began them in 2009 with the intention of evaluating
each office under its supervision.
Calling the review process "purposeful, integrated
[and] strategic," Boardman said it consisted of three parts:
a self-evaluation completed by each center, a review done
by an internal steering committee and finally a review
done by an external committee of people chosen by
Boardman in collaboration with the community centers.
"When I became vice provost of student affairs, we did
n't do a very good job with student assessment as a divi
sion," said Greg Boardman, who took the position in 2006
and currently holds the post. "Within the departments,
some were doing them, some were not."
"For me, personally, there is always that scare when an
organization gets reviewed," said Vince Moua 'l3, a staff
member at the Asian American Activities Center (A3C).
"Because we have received budget cuts in the past few
years already, it won't come as a surprise if we were to get
a budget cut, but there are a lot of programs and a lot of
other things that all the community centers do that are
very necessary for mental health and for the well-being of
students on campus."
The centers experienced substantial budget cuts in the
wake of the 2008 economic downturn, most of which have
not yet been restored. Frances Morales, the director of El
Centro Chicano, said at the time that the cen
ter's "programming and student salary budget
will be reduced by 34 percent." Additionally, pro
fessional staff at the centers saw their hours
during the months of July and August cut in half.
Boardman, however, said he did not foresee
more cuts to the center's programming.
"We're not looking to reduce anyone's fund
ing," he said. "If anything, there's a possibility of
increased funding if we identify additional needs
that are not being met."
Community center directors and staff said
the review was still in its early stages but
stressed the importance of the services the com
munity centers provide.
"We are constantly doing self-assessment for
each of our programs," said Cindy Ng, director
of the A3C. "This is something I think the
University as a whole is trying to create: a cul
ture of assessment."

Ng said she hopes the funding cut in 2009 will
be restored as a result of the review process,
describing the A3C's role in "promoting a sense
of belonging, academic success" and "educating
the larger Stanford community about the Asian-
American experience."
While most of the funding the centers lost
has not yet returned, the University has estab
lished other offices, like the Office of Diversity

and First-Generation Programs and the Leland
Scholars program, to step into roles that the
community centers have usually filled. For
example, the Leland Scholars program a
three-week summer immersion program for
incoming freshmen from low-income back
grounds stepped into the shoes of a smaller,
three-week immersion program run for Native
students by the Native American Cultural
Center (NACC) that was reduced to three days
after budget cuts.
"The community centers we've always
been very lean, in terms of staffing as well as
funding," Ng said. "While we are the face of
diversity at Stanford, there can sometimes be a
disconnect between the resources and the
needs."

According to Sally Dickson, associate vice
provost for student affairs, the funding disparity
between the community centers and the new
Office of Diversity and First-Generation
Programs results from the fact that the latter is
funded by an anonymous donor, who provided a
gift for the establishment of the office in April
2011.

"[The creation of the Office of Diversity and
First-Generation Programs] doesn't take any
recognition away from the community centers,
which have historically and continue to provide

support to students," Dickson said. "But why
not give this population additional resources?"
Still, Dickson admitted that there were fund
ing issues to be addressed.
"Is there a question about additional
resources needed?" she said. "Yes. I'm just
going to leave it at that."

Both Dickson and Boardman declined to
speculate on how the results of the review might
affect the community centers.
"I have no agenda of what the future will look
like," Boardman said. "That's what the purpose
of this review is."

Dickson hopes to have the recommendations

from the review finalized by the beginning of the
next academic year. In the meantime, the com
munity center directors said they are cautiously
optimistic.
"This is a new process for the whole review
team, and I think everything is on the table,"
said Karen Biestman, director of the Native
American Community Center. "There's too
many things we don't know yet, but I'm hopeful
based on the good will and the trust and the par
ticipation so far that that's the case."

not yet been restored. Frances Morales, the director of El
Centro Chicano, said at the time that the cen
ter's "programming and student salary budget
will be reduced by 34 percent." Additionally, pro
fessional staff at the centers saw their hours
during the months of July and August cut in half.
Boardman, however, said he did not foresee
more cuts to the center's programming.
"We're not looking to reduce anyone's fund
ing," he said. "If anything, there's a possibility of
increased funding if we identify additional needs
that are not being met."
Community center directors and staff said
the review was still in its early stages but
stressed the importance of the services the com
munity centers provide.
"We are constantly doing self-assessment for
each of our programs," said Cindy Ng, director
of the A3C. "This is something I think the
University as a whole is trying to create: a cul
ture of assessment."

Ng said she hopes the funding cut in 2009 will
be restored as a result of the review process,
describing the A3C's role in "promoting a sense
of belonging, academic success" and "educating
the larger Stanford community about the Asian-
American experience."
While most of the funding the centers lost
has not yet returned, the University has estab
lished other offices, like the Office of Diversity

and First-Generation Programs and the Leland
Scholars program, to step into roles that the
community centers have usually filled. For
example, the Leland Scholars program a
three-week summer immersion program for
incoming freshmen from low-income back
grounds stepped into the shoes of a smaller,
three-week immersion program run for Native
students by the Native American Cultural
Center (NACC) that was reduced to three days
after budget cuts.
"The community centers we've always
been very lean, in terms of staffing as well as
funding," Ng said. "While we are the face of
diversity at Stanford, there can sometimes be a
disconnect between the resources and the
needs."

According to Sally Dickson, associate vice
provost for student affairs, the funding disparity
between the community centers and the new
Office of Diversity and First-Generation
Programs results from the fact that the latter is
funded by an anonymous donor, who provided a
gift for the establishment of the office in April
2011.

"[The creation of the Office of Diversity and
First-Generation Programs] doesn't take any
recognition away from the community centers,
which have historically and continue to provide

support to students," Dickson said. "But why
not give this population additional resources?"
Still, Dickson admitted that there were fund
ing issues to be addressed.
"Is there a question about additional
resources needed?" she said. "Yes. I'm just
going to leave it at that."

Both Dickson and Boardman declined to
speculate on how the results of the review might
affect the community centers.
"I have no agenda of what the future will look
like," Boardman said. "That's what the purpose
of this review is."

Dickson hopes to have the recommendations

from the review finalized by the beginning of the
next academic year. In the meantime, the com
munity center directors said they are cautiously
optimistic.
"This is a new process for the whole review
team, and I think everything is on the table,"
said Karen Biestman, director of the Native
American Community Center. "There's too
many things we don't know yet, but I'm hopeful
based on the good will and the trust and the par
ticipation so far that that's the case."

For the first time in their 40-plus year history,
Stanford's six community centers are undergoing a review
and assessment by Student Affairs. The review is the lat
est in a string of reviews conducted by Student Affair's,
which began them in 2009 with the intention of evaluating
each office under its supervision.
Calling the review process "purposeful, integrated
[and] strategic," Boardman said it consisted of three parts:
a self-evaluation completed by each center, a review done
by an internal steering committee and finally a review
done by an external committee of people chosen by
Boardman in collaboration with the community centers.
"When I became vice provost of student affairs, we did
n't do a very good job with student assessment as a divi
sion," said Greg Boardman, who took the position in 2006
and currently holds the post. "Within the departments,
some were doing them, some were not."
"For me, personally, there is always that scare when an
organization gets reviewed," said Vince Moua 'l3, a staff
member at the Asian American Activities Center (A3C).
"Because we have received budget cuts in the past few
years already, it won't come as a surprise if we were to get
a budget cut, but there are a lot of programs and a lot of
other things that all the community centers do that are
very necessary for mental health and for the well-being of
students on campus."
