## Student activists critical in building community centers 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
When it was founded in 1891, Stanford
was ahead of its time: The school did not
charge tuition fees, it admitted women and it
had no religious affiliation. There were Asian
American and Native American students in
the first classes. But despite these measures,
Stanford was, for the first 70 years of its his
tory, overwhelmingly male and even more
overwhelmingly white.
As late as 1960, there were only two black
students in the entire freshman class. In
1965, just one Native American student was
enrolled in the University. Women were not
allowed to make up more than 40 percent of
the student body although the actual per
centage was much lower.

The number of Latino and Asian
American students was also low. In fact, dur
ing much of the early part of the 1900s, the
small number of Asian American students at
Stanford lived in the Japanese or Chinese
clubhouses. The clubhouses were separate
dormitories built with private funds in 1917
and 1919, respectively, in response to racism
the students encountered in the University
dorms. The Japanese Clubhouse stood until
1968, and the Chinese Clubhouse, which was
located where the Law School now stands,
until 1971.
These clubhouses served as the earliest
iteration of what would eventually become
Stanford's current system of six community
centers, which were formed in the late 1960s
and late 1970s as a response to the growing
needs of a more diverse student population.
This year, for the first time in their 40-year
plus history, the centers are being reviewed
by Student Affairs under a routine assess
ment on all of offices under its purview start
ing in 2009 (see sidebar).

"Creating a sense of belonging"
The small number of minority students
enrolled at Stanford began to rise in the
19605. As the civil rights movement gained
national prominence and attention, Stanford
began to recruit minority students, as a
result of both student pressure and because
of national changes.
By 1967, there were more than 100 black
students enrolled at Stanford, and in 1970,
the freshman class included 25 Native
American students. Both increases came as
results of a University recruitment push tar
geted at increasing minority enrollment.
Though smaller than they are today this
academic year, there are 650 black or African
American students and 80 Native American
students out of an undergraduate population
of 8,761 these numbers marked the begin
nings of a new commitment to diversity by
the University.
According to Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano, the late 1960s saw "the
beginnings of Mexican Americans, Latinos,
attending universities for the first time."
"There has long been a presence of Native
Americans [at Stanford]," said Karen
Biestman, director of the Native American
Cultural Center. "But it really didn't escalate
to a programmatic commitment until the late
'6os, early '7os."
Once on campus, the minority students
quickly formed communities of their own. In
five years, students founded the six major
community organizations: the Black Student
Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA) and the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay
People's Union in 1971 and the Women's
Collective in 1972.

"At that time, there were not so many stu
dents of color at Stanford," said Cindy Ng,
director of the Asian American Activities
Center, "So it was part of students creating a
sense of belonging for themselves on cam
pus."

This early activity took place amid the
anger and unrest following the assassination
of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The mur
der produced different reactions in the
Stanford community. According to a Daily
article printed the following day, some mem
bers of one freshman dorm cheered King's
death and held a food fight afterwards
("University answers black demands," April
9, 1968). The Black Student Union (BSU)
held a rally in White Plaza in which 40 stu
dents burned an American flag.
Four days after King's death, at a

University-wide colloquium on white racism
at Memorial Auditorium, 70 BSU members
walked onto the stage and took the micro
phone from former Provost Richard Lyman.
The BSU chair, Keni Washington '6B, told the
capacity crowd to "put your money where
your mouth is," and issued 10 demands to the
University relating to its responsibilities
towards black and other minority students.
Two days later, the University had agreed
to nine of the ten.

These commitments helped lead to the
founding of the Black Student Volunteer
Center now known as the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC) â€”in
1969, making it Stanford's first community
center. Others followed: the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C), the Gay People's
Union and the Women's Collective were
founded in 1972, the Native American
Cultural Center (NACC) in 1974 and El
Centro Chicano in 1977.

"Out of those moments of the '6os, both on
and off campus, the University rose to the
fact that it was committed to these values [of
diversity]," Ng said. "It's in keeping with the
founding mission, but I think it's a part of the
social movements that occurred."

Karen Biestman, NACC director, credited
an at-times acrimonious partnership between
students and the University for the growth
the community centers.
"I do think [the establishment of the
NACC] was student-led, but there was a
partnership" between students and the
University, Biestman said. "And that partner
ship can be credited to the evolution that
these 25 [recruited Native students] built
upon themselves."

"I think students had organized and asked
for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

Rallying for University funding
But getting the University to rise to the
challenge was not always easy. In their early
years, the centers were smaller and ran on
shoestring budgets. They were staffed
entirely by students, and received no money
from the University for events or other pro
gramming.

"We all recall having t0... sell food or
something... to raise money," Morales said.
"These six centers didn't happen all at
once. It was the result of many years," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. The additional funding the cen
ters have received through the years "was
based a lot on student advocacy, and trying to
meet the needs of students."

Through the 1970s and 1980s, student
efforts to gain greater recognition and finan
cial support from the University on behalf of
the centers were mixed with a number of
other demands political, curricular, eco
nomic and social.

Often led by coalitions of the main commu
nity groups, students held rallies and sit-ins
fighting for the removal of the Stanford
Indian mascot, more funding and space for
community centers, the establishment of eth
nic-themed dorms, the removal of the
"Western Civilization" requirement, greater
efforts at minority recruitment, divestment
from apartheid-era South Africa, the creation

If it wasn't for
a place like the
Black House,
I would have
struggled a
lot more.
