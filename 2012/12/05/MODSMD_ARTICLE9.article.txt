## Student activists critical in building community centers 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
When it was founded in 1891, Stanford
was ahead of its time: The school did not
charge tuition fees, it admitted women and it
had no religious affiliation. There were Asian
American and Native American students in
the first classes. But despite these measures,
Stanford was, for the first 70 years of its his
tory, overwhelmingly male and even more
overwhelmingly white.
As late as 1960, there were only two black
students in the entire freshman class. In
1965, just one Native American student was
enrolled in the University. Women were not
allowed to make up more than 40 percent of
the student body although the actual per
centage was much lower.

The number of Latino and Asian
American students was also low. In fact, dur
ing much of the early part of the 1900s, the
small number of Asian American students at
Stanford lived in the Japanese or Chinese
clubhouses. The clubhouses were separate
dormitories built with private funds in 1917
and 1919, respectively, in response to racism
the students encountered in the University
dorms. The Japanese Clubhouse stood until
1968, and the Chinese Clubhouse, which was
located where the Law School now stands,
until 1971.
These clubhouses served as the earliest
iteration of what would eventually become
Stanford's current system of six community
centers, which were formed in the late 1960s
and late 1970s as a response to the growing
needs of a more diverse student population.
This year, for the first time in their 40-year
plus history, the centers are being reviewed
by Student Affairs under a routine assess
ment on all of offices under its purview start
ing in 2009 (see sidebar).

"Creating a sense of belonging"
The small number of minority students
enrolled at Stanford began to rise in the
19605. As the civil rights movement gained
national prominence and attention, Stanford
began to recruit minority students, as a
result of both student pressure and because
of national changes.
By 1967, there were more than 100 black
students enrolled at Stanford, and in 1970,
the freshman class included 25 Native
American students. Both increases came as
results of a University recruitment push tar
geted at increasing minority enrollment.
Though smaller than they are today this
academic year, there are 650 black or African
American students and 80 Native American
students out of an undergraduate population
of 8,761 these numbers marked the begin
nings of a new commitment to diversity by
the University.
According to Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano, the late 1960s saw "the
beginnings of Mexican Americans, Latinos,
attending universities for the first time."
"There has long been a presence of Native
Americans [at Stanford]," said Karen
Biestman, director of the Native American
Cultural Center. "But it really didn't escalate
to a programmatic commitment until the late
'6os, early '7os."
Once on campus, the minority students
quickly formed communities of their own. In
five years, students founded the six major
community organizations: the Black Student
Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA) and the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay
People's Union in 1971 and the Women's
Collective in 1972.

"At that time, there were not so many stu
dents of color at Stanford," said Cindy Ng,
director of the Asian American Activities
Center, "So it was part of students creating a
sense of belonging for themselves on cam
pus."

This early activity took place amid the
anger and unrest following the assassination
of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The mur
der produced different reactions in the
Stanford community. According to a Daily
article printed the following day, some mem
bers of one freshman dorm cheered King's
death and held a food fight afterwards
("University answers black demands," April
9, 1968). The Black Student Union (BSU)
held a rally in White Plaza in which 40 stu
dents burned an American flag.
Four days after King's death, at a

University-wide colloquium on white racism
at Memorial Auditorium, 70 BSU members
walked onto the stage and took the micro
phone from former Provost Richard Lyman.
The BSU chair, Keni Washington '6B, told the
capacity crowd to "put your money where
your mouth is," and issued 10 demands to the
University relating to its responsibilities
towards black and other minority students.
Two days later, the University had agreed
to nine of the ten.

These commitments helped lead to the
founding of the Black Student Volunteer
Center now known as the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC) â€”in
1969, making it Stanford's first community
center. Others followed: the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C), the Gay People's
Union and the Women's Collective were
founded in 1972, the Native American
Cultural Center (NACC) in 1974 and El
Centro Chicano in 1977.

"Out of those moments of the '6os, both on
and off campus, the University rose to the
fact that it was committed to these values [of
diversity]," Ng said. "It's in keeping with the
founding mission, but I think it's a part of the
social movements that occurred."

Karen Biestman, NACC director, credited
an at-times acrimonious partnership between
students and the University for the growth
the community centers.
"I do think [the establishment of the
NACC] was student-led, but there was a
partnership" between students and the
University, Biestman said. "And that partner
ship can be credited to the evolution that
these 25 [recruited Native students] built
upon themselves."

"I think students had organized and asked
for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

Rallying for University funding
But getting the University to rise to the
challenge was not always easy. In their early
years, the centers were smaller and ran on
shoestring budgets. They were staffed
entirely by students, and received no money
from the University for events or other pro
gramming.

"We all recall having t0... sell food or
something... to raise money," Morales said.
"These six centers didn't happen all at
once. It was the result of many years," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. The additional funding the cen
ters have received through the years "was
based a lot on student advocacy, and trying to
meet the needs of students."

Through the 1970s and 1980s, student
efforts to gain greater recognition and finan
cial support from the University on behalf of
the centers were mixed with a number of
other demands political, curricular, eco
nomic and social.

Often led by coalitions of the main commu
nity groups, students held rallies and sit-ins
fighting for the removal of the Stanford
Indian mascot, more funding and space for
community centers, the establishment of eth
nic-themed dorms, the removal of the
"Western Civilization" requirement, greater
efforts at minority recruitment, divestment
from apartheid-era South Africa, the creation

of a vice provost position for
minority affair's, the creation
of ethnic studies programs,
an increase in the financial
aid budget and the hiring of
more minority faculty mem
bers.

One of the most famous
sit-ins came in 1989, when
students from different com
munities came together with
a variety of grievances. Sixty
of them formed the Agenda
for Action Coalition, and, on
May 15, they occupied then-
President Donald Kennedy's
office until the University
responded to their demands.
In the next day's issue of The
Daily, Kennedy called it the
"gravest" student protest in
16 years ("Students seize
Kennedy's office, 55 arrest
ed," May 16,1989).
Though the administra
tion's original response was
harsh Santa Clara County
police arrested 55 students

later that day the sit-in
produced results. Many of
the activists' demands, pri
marily related to the adminis
tration of community centers
and the hiring of minority
faculty, were met.
It was during the 1980s
that Stanford hired profes
sional staff for the communi
ty centers first on a part
time basis, then, towards the
end of the decade and the
beginning of the next, on a
full-time basis. According to
Ng, it was not until 1994 that
community centers began to
receive funding for program
ming, a result of a hunger
strike that year by Chicana
students.

"A beacon to the people
they serve"
From 1994 on, the com
munity centers settled, more
or less, into their current
forms. In 2001, the University
again increased funding to
the centers; these increased
budgets lasted until 2009,
when in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, the
entire Office of Student

Affairs took a $3 million
budget cut, which resulted
in a budget cut for all the
community centers. The
funds cut in 2009 have, for
the most part, not yet been
restored.
For almost the last 20
years, though, the addition of
programming funds has led
to an expansion of services
provided by the community
centers. Though each com
munity center tailors its serv
ices to its constituent popula
tion, the outlines of each are
broadly similar.

Each center offers aca
demic support, psychological
support and a physical space
where students can learn
more about their identities.

"If it wasn't for a place
like the Black House ... I
would have struggled a lot
more," said Shawn Dye 'l4, a
staff member at the BCSC.
"Community centers are a
beacon to the people they
serve, and they're also very
welcoming places for people
to come and learn."

Because of the community
centers' unique place in cam
pus debates over diversity
during the last 40 years, the
centers at Stanford have
developed in away that few
centers at other universities
have. Even compared to its
peer institutions, Stanford's
community centers are
unusually large and well sup
ported.

"Not all universities even
have offices to deal with
issues of diversity," Ng said.
Of those that do, "There's our
model, there's the multicul
tural model, and then there
might just be staff people."

In the multicultural
model, used at UC-Berkeley
and at Princeton, among oth
ers, all minority communities
are housed in one large "mul
ticultural center."

"For some, they argue
that the multicultural model
is better because if you put
the students together, they
can learn from each other,"
Ng said. "But I think to real
ly develop a depth of under
standing and to be able to
learn from people who are
different, which is critical,
there needs to be a strong
sense of who you are to begin
with."

Another criticism Stanford's
model faces is that, by sepa
rating each community cen
ter from the others, the school
forces students to choose one
identity over another.

But the center directors
dismissed that concern.

Having a separate space
for each community, Biestman
said, allows students to gain a
deeper understanding of
their identities and a closer
engagement with the issues
their communities face than
would otherwise be possible.
And most importantly, she
added, each center stands as
a symbol of the University's
commitment to diversity.
"It's really more than just
a place. It is the embodiment
of this history, the embodi
ment of this relationship, of
the partnership and the
promise of the future,"
Biestman said of the NACC.
"[lt's] an institutional com
mitment we can build upon
so we use this actively not
only to support current stu
dents, but, when future stu
dents come, when recruit
ment events come by, we say
that Stanford has a physical
legacy that others don't
have."

for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

Rallying for University funding
But getting the University to rise to the
challenge was not always easy. In their early
years, the centers were smaller and ran on
shoestring budgets. They were staffed
entirely by students, and received no money
from the University for events or other pro
gramming.

"We all recall having t0... sell food or
something... to raise money," Morales said.
"These six centers didn't happen all at
once. It was the result of many years," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. The additional funding the cen
ters have received through the years "was
based a lot on student advocacy, and trying to
meet the needs of students."

Through the 1970s and 1980s, student
efforts to gain greater recognition and finan
cial support from the University on behalf of
the centers were mixed with a number of
other demands political, curricular, eco
nomic and social.

Often led by coalitions of the main commu
nity groups, students held rallies and sit-ins
fighting for the removal of the Stanford
Indian mascot, more funding and space for
community centers, the establishment of eth
nic-themed dorms, the removal of the
"Western Civilization" requirement, greater
efforts at minority recruitment, divestment
from apartheid-era South Africa, the creation

of a vice provost position for
minority affair's, the creation
of ethnic studies programs,
an increase in the financial
aid budget and the hiring of
more minority faculty mem
bers.

One of the most famous
sit-ins came in 1989, when
students from different com
munities came together with
a variety of grievances. Sixty
of them formed the Agenda
for Action Coalition, and, on
May 15, they occupied then-
President Donald Kennedy's
office until the University
responded to their demands.
In the next day's issue of The
Daily, Kennedy called it the
"gravest" student protest in
16 years ("Students seize
Kennedy's office, 55 arrest
ed," May 16,1989).
Though the administra
tion's original response was
harsh Santa Clara County
police arrested 55 students

later that day the sit-in
produced results. Many of
the activists' demands, pri
marily related to the adminis
tration of community centers
and the hiring of minority
faculty, were met.
It was during the 1980s
that Stanford hired profes
sional staff for the communi
ty centers first on a part
time basis, then, towards the
end of the decade and the
beginning of the next, on a
full-time basis. According to
Ng, it was not until 1994 that
community centers began to
receive funding for program
ming, a result of a hunger
strike that year by Chicana
students.

"A beacon to the people
they serve"
From 1994 on, the com
munity centers settled, more
or less, into their current
forms. In 2001, the University
again increased funding to
the centers; these increased
budgets lasted until 2009,
when in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, the
entire Office of Student

Affairs took a $3 million
budget cut, which resulted
in a budget cut for all the
community centers. The
funds cut in 2009 have, for
the most part, not yet been
restored.
For almost the last 20
years, though, the addition of
programming funds has led
to an expansion of services
provided by the community
centers. Though each com
munity center tailors its serv
ices to its constituent popula
tion, the outlines of each are
broadly similar.

Each center offers aca
demic support, psychological
support and a physical space
where students can learn
more about their identities.

"If it wasn't for a place
like the Black House ... I
would have struggled a lot
more," said Shawn Dye 'l4, a
staff member at the BCSC.
"Community centers are a
beacon to the people they
serve, and they're also very
welcoming places for people
to come and learn."

Because of the community
centers' unique place in cam
pus debates over diversity
during the last 40 years, the
centers at Stanford have
developed in away that few
centers at other universities
have. Even compared to its
peer institutions, Stanford's
community centers are
unusually large and well sup
ported.

"Not all universities even
have offices to deal with
issues of diversity," Ng said.
Of those that do, "There's our
model, there's the multicul
tural model, and then there
might just be staff people."

In the multicultural
model, used at UC-Berkeley
and at Princeton, among oth
ers, all minority communities
are housed in one large "mul
ticultural center."

"For some, they argue
that the multicultural model
is better because if you put
the students together, they
can learn from each other,"
Ng said. "But I think to real
ly develop a depth of under
standing and to be able to
learn from people who are
different, which is critical,
there needs to be a strong
sense of who you are to begin
with."

Another criticism Stanford's
model faces is that, by sepa
rating each community cen
ter from the others, the school
forces students to choose one
identity over another.

But the center directors
dismissed that concern.

Having a separate space
for each community, Biestman
said, allows students to gain a
deeper understanding of
their identities and a closer
engagement with the issues
their communities face than
would otherwise be possible.
And most importantly, she
added, each center stands as
a symbol of the University's
commitment to diversity.
"It's really more than just
a place. It is the embodiment
of this history, the embodi
ment of this relationship, of
the partnership and the
promise of the future,"
Biestman said of the NACC.
"[lt's] an institutional com
mitment we can build upon
so we use this actively not
only to support current stu
dents, but, when future stu
dents come, when recruit
ment events come by, we say
that Stanford has a physical
legacy that others don't
have."

When it was founded in 1891, Stanford
was ahead of its time: The school did not
charge tuition fees, it admitted women and it
had no religious affiliation. There were Asian
American and Native American students in
the first classes. But despite these measures,
Stanford was, for the first 70 years of its his
tory, overwhelmingly male and even more
overwhelmingly white.
As late as 1960, there were only two black
students in the entire freshman class. In
1965, just one Native American student was
enrolled in the University. Women were not
allowed to make up more than 40 percent of
the student body although the actual per
centage was much lower.

The number of Latino and Asian
American students was also low. In fact, dur
ing much of the early part of the 1900s, the
small number of Asian American students at
Stanford lived in the Japanese or Chinese
clubhouses. The clubhouses were separate
dormitories built with private funds in 1917
and 1919, respectively, in response to racism
the students encountered in the University
dorms. The Japanese Clubhouse stood until
1968, and the Chinese Clubhouse, which was
located where the Law School now stands,
until 1971.
These clubhouses served as the earliest
iteration of what would eventually become
Stanford's current system of six community
centers, which were formed in the late 1960s
and late 1970s as a response to the growing
needs of a more diverse student population.
This year, for the first time in their 40-year
plus history, the centers are being reviewed
by Student Affairs under a routine assess
ment on all of offices under its purview start
ing in 2009 (see sidebar).

"Creating a sense of belonging"
The small number of minority students
enrolled at Stanford began to rise in the
19605. As the civil rights movement gained
national prominence and attention, Stanford
began to recruit minority students, as a
result of both student pressure and because
of national changes.
By 1967, there were more than 100 black
students enrolled at Stanford, and in 1970,
the freshman class included 25 Native
American students. Both increases came as
results of a University recruitment push tar
geted at increasing minority enrollment.
Though smaller than they are today this
academic year, there are 650 black or African
American students and 80 Native American
students out of an undergraduate population
of 8,761 these numbers marked the begin
nings of a new commitment to diversity by
the University.
According to Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano, the late 1960s saw "the
beginnings of Mexican Americans, Latinos,
attending universities for the first time."
"There has long been a presence of Native
Americans [at Stanford]," said Karen
Biestman, director of the Native American
Cultural Center. "But it really didn't escalate
to a programmatic commitment until the late
'6os, early '7os."
Once on campus, the minority students
quickly formed communities of their own. In
five years, students founded the six major
community organizations: the Black Student
Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA) and the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay
People's Union in 1971 and the Women's
Collective in 1972.

"At that time, there were not so many stu
dents of color at Stanford," said Cindy Ng,
director of the Asian American Activities
Center, "So it was part of students creating a
sense of belonging for themselves on cam
pus."

This early activity took place amid the
anger and unrest following the assassination
of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The mur
der produced different reactions in the
Stanford community. According to a Daily
article printed the following day, some mem
bers of one freshman dorm cheered King's
death and held a food fight afterwards
("University answers black demands," April
9, 1968). The Black Student Union (BSU)
held a rally in White Plaza in which 40 stu
dents burned an American flag.
Four days after King's death, at a

University-wide colloquium on white racism
at Memorial Auditorium, 70 BSU members
walked onto the stage and took the micro
phone from former Provost Richard Lyman.
The BSU chair, Keni Washington '6B, told the
capacity crowd to "put your money where
your mouth is," and issued 10 demands to the
University relating to its responsibilities
towards black and other minority students.
Two days later, the University had agreed
to nine of the ten.

These commitments helped lead to the
founding of the Black Student Volunteer
Center now known as the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC) â€”in
1969, making it Stanford's first community
center. Others followed: the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C), the Gay People's
Union and the Women's Collective were
founded in 1972, the Native American
Cultural Center (NACC) in 1974 and El
Centro Chicano in 1977.

"Out of those moments of the '6os, both on
and off campus, the University rose to the
fact that it was committed to these values [of
diversity]," Ng said. "It's in keeping with the
founding mission, but I think it's a part of the
social movements that occurred."

Karen Biestman, NACC director, credited
an at-times acrimonious partnership between
students and the University for the growth
the community centers.
"I do think [the establishment of the
NACC] was student-led, but there was a
partnership" between students and the
University, Biestman said. "And that partner
ship can be credited to the evolution that
these 25 [recruited Native students] built
upon themselves."

"I think students had organized and asked
for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

But getting the University to rise to the

When it was founded in 1891, Stanford
was ahead of its time: The school did not
charge tuition fees, it admitted women and it
had no religious affiliation. There were Asian
American and Native American students in
the first classes. But despite these measures,
Stanford was, for the first 70 years of its his
tory, overwhelmingly male and even more
overwhelmingly white.
As late as 1960, there were only two black
students in the entire freshman class. In
1965, just one Native American student was
enrolled in the University. Women were not
allowed to make up more than 40 percent of
the student body although the actual per
centage was much lower.

The number of Latino and Asian
American students was also low. In fact, dur
ing much of the early part of the 1900s, the
small number of Asian American students at
Stanford lived in the Japanese or Chinese
clubhouses. The clubhouses were separate
dormitories built with private funds in 1917
and 1919, respectively, in response to racism
the students encountered in the University
dorms. The Japanese Clubhouse stood until
1968, and the Chinese Clubhouse, which was
located where the Law School now stands,
until 1971.
These clubhouses served as the earliest
iteration of what would eventually become
Stanford's current system of six community
centers, which were formed in the late 1960s
and late 1970s as a response to the growing
needs of a more diverse student population.
This year, for the first time in their 40-year
plus history, the centers are being reviewed
by Student Affairs under a routine assess
ment on all of offices under its purview start
ing in 2009 (see sidebar).

"Creating a sense of belonging"
The small number of minority students
enrolled at Stanford began to rise in the
19605. As the civil rights movement gained
national prominence and attention, Stanford
began to recruit minority students, as a
result of both student pressure and because
of national changes.
By 1967, there were more than 100 black
students enrolled at Stanford, and in 1970,
the freshman class included 25 Native
American students. Both increases came as
results of a University recruitment push tar
geted at increasing minority enrollment.
Though smaller than they are today this
academic year, there are 650 black or African
American students and 80 Native American
students out of an undergraduate population
of 8,761 these numbers marked the begin
nings of a new commitment to diversity by
the University.
According to Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano, the late 1960s saw "the
beginnings of Mexican Americans, Latinos,
attending universities for the first time."
"There has long been a presence of Native
Americans [at Stanford]," said Karen
Biestman, director of the Native American
Cultural Center. "But it really didn't escalate
to a programmatic commitment until the late
'6os, early '7os."
Once on campus, the minority students
quickly formed communities of their own. In
five years, students founded the six major
community organizations: the Black Student
Union (BSU) in 1967, the Asian American
Students' Association (AASA) and the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA) in 1969, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) in 1970, the Gay
People's Union in 1971 and the Women's
Collective in 1972.

"At that time, there were not so many stu
dents of color at Stanford," said Cindy Ng,
director of the Asian American Activities
Center, "So it was part of students creating a
sense of belonging for themselves on cam
pus."

This early activity took place amid the
anger and unrest following the assassination
of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. The mur
der produced different reactions in the
Stanford community. According to a Daily
article printed the following day, some mem
bers of one freshman dorm cheered King's
death and held a food fight afterwards
("University answers black demands," April
9, 1968). The Black Student Union (BSU)
held a rally in White Plaza in which 40 stu
dents burned an American flag.
Four days after King's death, at a

University-wide colloquium on white racism
at Memorial Auditorium, 70 BSU members
walked onto the stage and took the micro
phone from former Provost Richard Lyman.
The BSU chair, Keni Washington '6B, told the
capacity crowd to "put your money where
your mouth is," and issued 10 demands to the
University relating to its responsibilities
towards black and other minority students.
Two days later, the University had agreed
to nine of the ten.

These commitments helped lead to the
founding of the Black Student Volunteer
Center now known as the Black
Community Services Center (BCSC) â€”in
1969, making it Stanford's first community
center. Others followed: the Asian American
Activities Center (A3C), the Gay People's
Union and the Women's Collective were
founded in 1972, the Native American
Cultural Center (NACC) in 1974 and El
Centro Chicano in 1977.

"Out of those moments of the '6os, both on
and off campus, the University rose to the
fact that it was committed to these values [of
diversity]," Ng said. "It's in keeping with the
founding mission, but I think it's a part of the
social movements that occurred."

Karen Biestman, NACC director, credited
an at-times acrimonious partnership between
students and the University for the growth
the community centers.
"I do think [the establishment of the
NACC] was student-led, but there was a
partnership" between students and the
University, Biestman said. "And that partner
ship can be credited to the evolution that
these 25 [recruited Native students] built
upon themselves."

"I think students had organized and asked
for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

Rallying for University funding
But getting the University to rise to the
challenge was not always easy. In their early
years, the centers were smaller and ran on
shoestring budgets. They were staffed
entirely by students, and received no money
from the University for events or other pro
gramming.

"We all recall having t0... sell food or
something... to raise money," Morales said.
"These six centers didn't happen all at
once. It was the result of many years," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. The additional funding the cen
ters have received through the years "was
based a lot on student advocacy, and trying to
meet the needs of students."

Through the 1970s and 1980s, student
efforts to gain greater recognition and finan
cial support from the University on behalf of
the centers were mixed with a number of
other demands political, curricular, eco
nomic and social.

Often led by coalitions of the main commu
nity groups, students held rallies and sit-ins
fighting for the removal of the Stanford
Indian mascot, more funding and space for
community centers, the establishment of eth
nic-themed dorms, the removal of the
"Western Civilization" requirement, greater
efforts at minority recruitment, divestment
from apartheid-era South Africa, the creation

of a vice provost position for
minority affair's, the creation
of ethnic studies programs,
an increase in the financial
aid budget and the hiring of
more minority faculty mem
bers.

One of the most famous
sit-ins came in 1989, when
students from different com
munities came together with
a variety of grievances. Sixty
of them formed the Agenda
for Action Coalition, and, on
May 15, they occupied then-
President Donald Kennedy's
office until the University
responded to their demands.
In the next day's issue of The
Daily, Kennedy called it the
"gravest" student protest in
16 years ("Students seize
Kennedy's office, 55 arrest
ed," May 16,1989).
Though the administra
tion's original response was
harsh Santa Clara County
police arrested 55 students

later that day the sit-in
produced results. Many of
the activists' demands, pri
marily related to the adminis
tration of community centers
and the hiring of minority
faculty, were met.
It was during the 1980s
that Stanford hired profes
sional staff for the communi
ty centers first on a part
time basis, then, towards the
end of the decade and the
beginning of the next, on a
full-time basis. According to
Ng, it was not until 1994 that
community centers began to
receive funding for program
ming, a result of a hunger
strike that year by Chicana
students.

"A beacon to the people
they serve"
From 1994 on, the com
munity centers settled, more
or less, into their current
forms. In 2001, the University
again increased funding to
the centers; these increased
budgets lasted until 2009,
when in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, the
entire Office of Student

Affairs took a $3 million
budget cut, which resulted
in a budget cut for all the
community centers. The
funds cut in 2009 have, for
the most part, not yet been
restored.
For almost the last 20
years, though, the addition of
programming funds has led
to an expansion of services
provided by the community
centers. Though each com
munity center tailors its serv
ices to its constituent popula
tion, the outlines of each are
broadly similar.

Each center offers aca
demic support, psychological
support and a physical space
where students can learn
more about their identities.

"If it wasn't for a place
like the Black House ... I
would have struggled a lot
more," said Shawn Dye 'l4, a
staff member at the BCSC.
"Community centers are a
beacon to the people they
serve, and they're also very
welcoming places for people
to come and learn."

Because of the community
centers' unique place in cam
pus debates over diversity
during the last 40 years, the
centers at Stanford have
developed in away that few
centers at other universities
have. Even compared to its
peer institutions, Stanford's
community centers are
unusually large and well sup
ported.

"Not all universities even
have offices to deal with
issues of diversity," Ng said.
Of those that do, "There's our
model, there's the multicul
tural model, and then there
might just be staff people."

In the multicultural
model, used at UC-Berkeley
and at Princeton, among oth
ers, all minority communities
are housed in one large "mul
ticultural center."

"For some, they argue
that the multicultural model
is better because if you put
the students together, they
can learn from each other,"
Ng said. "But I think to real
ly develop a depth of under
standing and to be able to
learn from people who are
different, which is critical,
there needs to be a strong
sense of who you are to begin
with."

Another criticism Stanford's
model faces is that, by sepa
rating each community cen
ter from the others, the school
forces students to choose one
identity over another.

But the center directors
dismissed that concern.

Having a separate space
for each community, Biestman
said, allows students to gain a
deeper understanding of
their identities and a closer
engagement with the issues
their communities face than
would otherwise be possible.
And most importantly, she
added, each center stands as
a symbol of the University's
commitment to diversity.
"It's really more than just
a place. It is the embodiment
of this history, the embodi
ment of this relationship, of
the partnership and the
promise of the future,"
Biestman said of the NACC.

fact that it was committed to these values [of
diversity]," Ng said. "It's in keeping with the
founding mission, but I think it's a part of the
social movements that occurred."

Karen Biestman, NACC director, credited
an at-times acrimonious partnership between
students and the University for the growth
the community centers.
"I do think [the establishment of the
NACC] was student-led, but there was a
partnership" between students and the
University, Biestman said. "And that partner
ship can be credited to the evolution that
these 25 [recruited Native students] built
upon themselves."

"I think students had organized and asked
for additional resources," said Benjamin
Davidson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resource Center (LGBT CRC). "Stanford
rose to the challenge."

Rallying for University funding
But getting the University to rise to the
challenge was not always easy. In their early
years, the centers were smaller and ran on
shoestring budgets. They were staffed
entirely by students, and received no money
from the University for events or other pro
gramming.

"We all recall having t0... sell food or
something... to raise money," Morales said.
"These six centers didn't happen all at
once. It was the result of many years," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman. The additional funding the cen
ters have received through the years "was
based a lot on student advocacy, and trying to
meet the needs of students."

Through the 1970s and 1980s, student
efforts to gain greater recognition and finan
cial support from the University on behalf of
the centers were mixed with a number of
other demands political, curricular, eco
nomic and social.

Often led by coalitions of the main commu
nity groups, students held rallies and sit-ins
fighting for the removal of the Stanford
Indian mascot, more funding and space for
community centers, the establishment of eth
nic-themed dorms, the removal of the
"Western Civilization" requirement, greater
efforts at minority recruitment, divestment
from apartheid-era South Africa, the creation

of a vice provost position for
minority affair's, the creation
of ethnic studies programs,
an increase in the financial
aid budget and the hiring of
more minority faculty mem
bers.

One of the most famous
sit-ins came in 1989, when
students from different com
munities came together with
a variety of grievances. Sixty
of them formed the Agenda
for Action Coalition, and, on
May 15, they occupied then-
President Donald Kennedy's
office until the University
responded to their demands.
In the next day's issue of The
Daily, Kennedy called it the
"gravest" student protest in
16 years ("Students seize
Kennedy's office, 55 arrest
ed," May 16,1989).
Though the administra
tion's original response was
harsh Santa Clara County
police arrested 55 students

later that day the sit-in
produced results. Many of
the activists' demands, pri
marily related to the adminis
tration of community centers
and the hiring of minority
faculty, were met.
It was during the 1980s
that Stanford hired profes
sional staff for the communi
ty centers first on a part
time basis, then, towards the
end of the decade and the
beginning of the next, on a
full-time basis. According to
Ng, it was not until 1994 that
community centers began to
receive funding for program
ming, a result of a hunger
strike that year by Chicana
students.

"A beacon to the people
they serve"
From 1994 on, the com
munity centers settled, more
or less, into their current
forms. In 2001, the University
again increased funding to
the centers; these increased
budgets lasted until 2009,
when in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, the
entire Office of Student

Affairs took a $3 million
budget cut, which resulted
in a budget cut for all the
community centers. The
funds cut in 2009 have, for
the most part, not yet been
restored.
For almost the last 20
years, though, the addition of
programming funds has led
to an expansion of services
provided by the community
centers. Though each com
munity center tailors its serv
ices to its constituent popula
tion, the outlines of each are
broadly similar.

Each center offers aca
demic support, psychological
support and a physical space
where students can learn
more about their identities.

"If it wasn't for a place
like the Black House ... I
would have struggled a lot
more," said Shawn Dye 'l4, a
staff member at the BCSC.
"Community centers are a
beacon to the people they
serve, and they're also very
welcoming places for people
to come and learn."

Because of the community
centers' unique place in cam
pus debates over diversity
during the last 40 years, the
centers at Stanford have
developed in away that few
centers at other universities
have. Even compared to its
peer institutions, Stanford's
community centers are
unusually large and well sup
ported.

"Not all universities even
have offices to deal with
issues of diversity," Ng said.
Of those that do, "There's our
model, there's the multicul
tural model, and then there
might just be staff people."

In the multicultural
model, used at UC-Berkeley
and at Princeton, among oth
ers, all minority communities
are housed in one large "mul
ticultural center."

"For some, they argue
that the multicultural model
is better because if you put
the students together, they
can learn from each other,"
Ng said. "But I think to real
ly develop a depth of under
standing and to be able to
learn from people who are
different, which is critical,
there needs to be a strong
sense of who you are to begin
with."

Another criticism Stanford's
model faces is that, by sepa
rating each community cen
ter from the others, the school
forces students to choose one
identity over another.

But the center directors
dismissed that concern.

Having a separate space
for each community, Biestman
said, allows students to gain a
deeper understanding of
their identities and a closer
engagement with the issues
their communities face than
would otherwise be possible.
And most importantly, she
added, each center stands as
a symbol of the University's
commitment to diversity.
"It's really more than just
a place. It is the embodiment
of this history, the embodi
ment of this relationship, of
the partnership and the
promise of the future,"
Biestman said of the NACC.
"[lt's] an institutional com
mitment we can build upon
so we use this actively not
only to support current stu
dents, but, when future stu
dents come, when recruit
ment events come by, we say
that Stanford has a physical
legacy that others don't
have."
