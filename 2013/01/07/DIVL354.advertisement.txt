show how the newly founded city was established, and subsequently became a crucial urban
center in the Middle East. Discussing the history of the city from the initial conquest, to the
breakup of central Abbasid power, the establishment of the Fatimid Shi 1 i caliphate in the loth to
12th centuries, the return of Sunni rule under the Ayyubids in the late 12th century and the rule of
the Mamluks from the 1260s to the early sixteenth century based on existing monuments as well
as medieval Arabic sources will provide a double perspective on this development. The final

CCRMA {Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) (5 units)
ARTHIST 2328: Design Theory
(Tom Beischer, T, hls-2:45)
This seminar focuses on the key themes, histories, and methods of architectural theory - a form of archi
tectural practice that establishes the aims and philosophies of architecture. Architectural theory is primar
ily written, but it also incorporates drawing, photography, film, and other media. One of the distinctive fea
tures of modern and contemporary architecture is its pronounced use of theory to articulate its aims. One
might argue that modern architecture is modern because of its incorporation of theory. This course fo
cuses on those early-modern, modern, and late-modern writings that have been and remain entangled
with contemporary architectural thought and design practice. Rather than examine the development of
modern architectural theory chronologically, it is explored architectural through thematic topics. These
themes enable the student to understand how certain architectural theoretical concepts endure, are trans
formed, and can be furthered through his/her own explorations. {4 units)
ARTHIST 244: The Visual Culture of the American Home Front, 1941-1945
(Alexander Nemerov, W, 9:30-l2:30)

sixty years' distance? Examining Hollywood films from those years -films made during the war but mostly
not directly about the war - the seminar focuses on developing students' abilities to write emotion-based
criticism and history Weekly short papers, each one in response to a film screening, are required. Among

postcards) in and about California from the middle of the 19th century to the present. It approaches Cali
fornia as a contested political, historical and geographical site and as a series of images and alternative

FILMSTUD 6: Introduction to Digital Media
(Carol Vernallis, MW, 5.-75-6.-30)
Media beyond the horizon of cinema and television present unique problems of definition and analysis.

chanics and fantasies of computation, course surveys theoretical approaches to code, networks, and cy
berculture. Taking familiar formations like web sites and video games as objects by which to learn how
thinkers have understood and envisioned emerging media from the mid-20th century to the present. Stu
dents to develop own methodological tools for becoming more critical users of digital media. (5 units)
FILMSTUD HON: Darkness in Light: The Filmic Imagination of Horror
(open to Ist & 2 year students)
(Jean Ma, TTh, 11-12:50; W, 7-9:30)
From its very beginnings, the cinema evinced an affinity with the phantom realm of specters, ghosts, and
supernatural beings. Not only does horror have deep and diverse roots in the international history of film;
it emerges as a trope of film itself, as a medium of shadows, dematerialized presence, life drained of sub
stance. This course offers an overview of filmic imaginations of horror across the span of the twentieth cen
tury, with a focus on the US, Europe, and Japan. We will read and discuss theories of horror - from the fan
tastic to the uncanny - and unpack these in light of key moments in the genre's development. We will
debate the merits of vampires versus zombies. And we will trace, through the lens of horror, ongoing de
bates about cinematic representation, from Andre Bazin's idea of the "mummy complex" to Linda Williams'
thesis of "body genres" to Jeffrey Sconce's notion of "haunted media." The course will serve as an introduc
tion to film analysis and interpretation; no prior experience in film studies is required or expected. In addi
tion to regular class meetings, there will be a required weekly screening. (4 units)
