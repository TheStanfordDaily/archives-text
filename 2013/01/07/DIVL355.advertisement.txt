POLISCI24SR:
Politics in Modern Iran
INSTRUCTOR: ABBAS MILANI
DAY AND TIME: W 2:15 -5:05
CLASSROOM: 20-21G
UNITS: 5
Modern Iran has been a smithy for political movements, ideologies, and types of states. Movements
include nationalism, constitutionalism, Marxism, Islamic fundamentalism, social democracy, Islamic
liberalism, and fascism. Forms of government include Oriental despotism, authoritarianism, Islamic
theocracy, and liberal democracy. These varieties have appeared in Iran in an iteration shaped by
history, geography, proximity to oil and the Soviet Union, and the hegemony of Islamic culture.
COMPLIT 2498:
Iranian Cinema in Diaspora
INSTRUCTOR: BAHRAM BEYZAIE
DAY AND TIME: F3:15- 6:05
CLASSROOM: MEYER 143
UNITS: 1-3
Despite enormous obstacles, immigrant Iranian Filmmakers, within a few decades after the Iranian
revolution, have created a slow but steady stream of films outside Iran. They were originally started
by individual spontaneous attempts from different corners of the world, and now we can identify
common lines of interest among them. There are also major differences between them. These films
have never been allowed to be screened inside Iran, and without any support from the global system
of production and distribution, they have enjoyed little attention. Despite all this, Iranian cinema in
exile is in no sense any less important than Iranian cinema inside Iran. In this course we will view
one such film made outside Iran at each class meeting and expect to reach a common consensus in
identifying the general patterns within these works and this movement. Questions such as the ones
listed below will be addressed in our meetings each week: What changes in aesthetics and point of
view of the filmmaker are caused by the change in his or her work environment? Though these films
are made outside Iran, how well do they relate to the known (recognized) cinema within Iran? And,
in fact, to what extent do these films express things that are left unsaid by the cinema within Iran?

RELIGST 309 D:
'Crow Eaters' & 'Fire Worshippers': Exploring Contemporary
Zoroastrianism Thru Reading Parsi Lit (RELIGST 209 D)
INSTRUCTOR: YUHAN VEVAINA
DAY AND TIME: T, TH 4:15-5:30
CLASSROOM: 60-118
UNITS: 3-5
In the past three decades Parsi fiction has rapidly emerged as a unique and creative voice in modern
Anglophone literature from South Asia. From Bapsi Sidhwa to Thrity Umrigar to Rohinton Mistry, Parsi
novelists address the most poignant concerns of Zoroastrians living in an era of rapid social, political,
and religious transformation. The erosion of tradition; the breakdown of the Parsi family; the demise of
religion among the young; and the cultural losses and gains of living in diaspora are common themes
in their works. The unique vantage point of the Parsis; neither Hindu nor Muslim, neither quite Indian
nor quite British; will serve as a lens for examining the inherent tensions in multicultural societies both
East and West.
