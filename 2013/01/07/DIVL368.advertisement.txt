ENGLISH 105: The Renaissance: Art, Science, Magic and Love
This class is a survey of English Renaissance literature from Sidney and Spenser to Milton and Marvell, and including
Marlowe's Doctor Faustuso nd Shakespeare's The Tempest. The course gives training in the reading of early modern poetry
and prose, and considers what kind of cultural, social and political institution literature was in Renaissance England: who
wrote it and why and for whom, what the pressures were on it, what expectations it fulfilled (or on occasion defeated),
whose interests it served. MW 11-12:30 (Orgel)
English 140H: The Idea of a Theater
This course examines the idea of a theater from the religious street theater of Medieval York, though Shakespeare's Globe,
and onto the mental theater of the Romantic reader and the alienation effects of Brecht's radical playhouse in the 20th
century. TTh 1:15-3:05 (Hoxby)
ENGLISH 151F: Angelheaded Hipsters: Beat Writers
of San Francisco and New York
Students in this course will read central writers of the Beat movement (Ginsberg, Kerouac, di Prima, Snyder, Whalen) as well
as some related writers (Creeley, Gunn, Levertov). Issues explored include NY and SF, Buddhism and leftist politics, poetry
and jazz. Some exposure to reading poems to jazz accompaniment. This class will also examine some of the writers and
performers growing out of the Beats: Bob Dylan, rock music, especially from San Francisco, and jazz. MW 2:15-4:05 (Fields)
ENGLISH 158A: .Literary Celebrity: Douglass, Hemingway, Plath
This course considers the phenomenon of literary celebrity by examining three American authors whose lives and public
images transcended their work: Frederick Douglass, the orator and three-time autobiographer whose image was placed
on the wall of many nineteenth-century African-American homes; Ernest Hemingway, the Modernist writer whose
hyper-masculihe reputation has remained powerful in American culture even as his literary star has declined; and Sylvia
Plath, the confessional poet and novelist who, with her controversial suicide at age 30, became a figurehead in the
emerging women's movement. By reading texts from each author, newspaper and magazine coverage, and critical
assessments, we will explore how authors' texts help create their legends, and how their reputations influence the way we
read their work. MW 10-11:50 (Spingarn)
ENGLISH 195 D: Writing 2.0: The Art of the Digital.Essay
Contemporary changes in the technologies of writing now allow writers to compose using color, fmages, sound, video,
hyperlinks, and other forms of multimedia. Students in this course will explore examples of a number of what we might call
"animated" essays (by composers like Diana Slattery and ShePey Jackson) and then work to Create a major digital essay of
their own. No special expertise needed:justf curiosity and a willingness to experiment. T 3:15-6:05 (Lunsford ancrHess)
