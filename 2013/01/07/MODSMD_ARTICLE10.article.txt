## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN It could be a wonderful year 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Like a great many of you, I
spent much of my Christmas
Eve this year enjoying Frank
Capra's 1946 holiday classic, "It's a
Wonderful Life." Nearly seventy
years after its release, the heart
warming story of selfless Bedford
Falls banker George Bailey's life
long suffering and last-minute
redemption continues to resonate
deeply with millions of viewers
each and every December. Paying
homage to time-honored American
values of courage, civic duty and
devotion to community, "It's a
Wonderful Life" illuminates the
brightness of a single thoughtfully
lived life against the encroaching
darkness of selfishness and despair,
weaving a narrative whose moral
chiaroscuro is mirrored in the film's
timeless black-and-white cine
matography.
Part of the film's enduring
appeal undoubtedly lies in the sim
plicity of its blueprint for an ethi
cally healthy community. As the
nation crawls back up the unforgiv
ing face of the fiscal cliff, reels from
the horrific aftermath of yet anoth
er mass shooting, and, as Bedford
Falls did, begins to welcome home
our soldiers from a long and brutal
war, we could stand to learn a few
lessons from the trials and tribula
tions of George Bailey.
At first glance, Capra's portray
al of small-town Bedford Falls
appears to endorse an essentially
liberal vision of the good society.
The film's greedy antagonist, the
wealthy and self-aggrandizing Mr.
Potter (Lionel Barrymore), has no
greater goal in life than the con
stant acquisition of more money
and larger properties. The perni
cious Potter, a true vulture capital
ist, buys up and dismembers cher
ished pieces of small-town Bedford
Falls, turning happy family homes
into soul-sucking slums and reduc
ing hard-working blue-collar men
to impoverished serfs. The only
thing standing in his way is the
heroic George Bailey (Jimmy
Stewart), owner of the Building and
Loan, who selflessly rejects the
bold, adventurous life of which he
has always dreamed in order to
lend his fellow citizens the money
they need to get a hand up in life.
But "It's a Wonderful Life" is
also imbued with fundamentally
conservative virtues of self
reliance, individual agency and col
lective morality. The government is
nowhere to be seen; Bedford Falls'
poor and destitute find solace in the
generosity of a private individual.
The film's famous closing scenes
contain no Robin Hood-esque IRS
agent swooping in to tax Mr.
Potter's estate and redistribute the
proceeds; Bedford Falls instead
finds joy in community, shared duty
and family. Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan famously remarked, "the
central conservative truth is that
culture, not politics, determines the
success of a society." Culture
(shared values of charity), not poli
tics (the hand of the state), is the
town's indisputable guiding force.
All in all, "It's a Wonderful Life"
reflects the political and cultural
spectrum of a different time a
time in which the prevailing wis
dom, shared assumptions, and

basic fabric of society looked funda
mentally different. Without going
nearly so far as to suggest that the
ideal America is the America of
1946 romanticized in film, I do
think very much that filmgoers in
2012 could stand to gain by incorpo
rating a few of Capra's lessons into
our own lives today.
Taking care of our own, eschew
ing the empty pursuit of money in
favor of a cause, whether that be
family, athletics, art, scientific
progress, or activism; taking the
time to know and support the mem
bers of your community these
are not particularly liberal or con
servative ideals. "Material well
being," observed Theodore
Roosevelt in 1910, "represents
nothing but the foundation, and
that... foundation, though indis
pensable, is worthless unless upon
it is raised the superstructure of a
higher life." That higher life is the
subject of It's a Wonderful Life,
and it should be our object now.
Ultimately, the film suggests
that our problems flow from non
partisan sources, and that fruitful
solutions may lie in a philosophy of
life that transcends political lines
and that may not be achievable via
political means.
Small-town 1940s America may
be gone, and with it the possibility
for small-town 1940s solutions to
small-town 1940s problems.
But some stories never change.
