# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Stanford's Nonconformist Marching Band 
### 
My only complaint about the
entire Tournament of
Roses (TOR) concerns the
Stanford University band. In the
TOR parade, its "body work" was
gratuitous to the point that is was
unprofessional and clown-like. The
members of the Band didn't march;
they ambled. They didn't play as an
ensemble; it was helter-skelter,
near-total dissonance. Their "uni
forms" looked like they found them
in a dumpster. Their disgraceful
behavior was an insult to all the
other bands who put in countless
hours of dedicated, focused prac
tice, with the single-minded vision
of providing the best show that
they possibly could to millions of
TOR parade fans and viewers.
Kudos to all the other bands (U.
Wisconsin, Marines, Lincoln, etc.);
shame on you, Stanford band. Your
"style" may be appropriate for
some venues like a circus

sideshow. It has no place in a
parade.
Don't defend yourselves or pat
yourselves on the back for being
non-conformists. Nonconformity can
be a very good thing, but you take
non-conformity so far beyond the
norm that your true talents (and I'm
sure they are many) are obscured in
absurdity and mediocrity.
I don't have an issue with cre
ative nonconformity. I have an issue
with nonconformity to quality stan
dards, to professionalism, to
respect, to doing justice to the
incomparable nature of the entire
TOR organization. If the Stanford
band has any musical talent, you
failed to show it, not by your artis
tic nonconformity but by your lack
of respect for, and pride in, your
own God-given talents.
