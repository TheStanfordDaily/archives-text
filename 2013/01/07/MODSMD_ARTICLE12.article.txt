## The 						writer's ethical dilemma 
### Alex Bayer 
Admittedly, being a writer is
not a strenuous job. It does
n't require me to leave my
bed, nor talk to people in a cheery
voice. Expressing my innermost
feelings, which some take to be a
brave feat, is actually just cathartic.
In fact, revealing details about
myself has turned out to be the eas
iest way to avoid criticism. In this
sense, I am cowardly.
Writing is a selfish occupation,
and though I write with the hope
that in sharing my experiences peo
ple feel less alone, I end up hurting
the ones I love most. It's one thing
to talk about depression or my
angst. But I am also guilty of bring
ing into the fold the imperfections
and misbehaviors of those closest to
me, so that I can reflect on what I
have learned from them or offer a
more authentic picture of myself. I
tell myself I do so because being
truthful about what I've experi
enced seems like a writer's obliga
tion. As soon as I begin censoring
my words, I feel like I'm betraying
a reader's trust by committing the
lie of omission. At least, this is what I
tell myself.
I realize it's not just the writer's
dilemma, but the artist's. Does
Taylor Swift go through the same
ethical dilemma when she chooses
to write a spiteful song about a for
mer lover, the identity of whom is
only thinly veiled? Surely, she must
have resolved that dilemma long
ago, since most of her songs seem to
be rebukes against former flames.
When put like this, it does seem a

little cruel. Then again, a song like
this has no doubt given solace to
thousands of teenage girls who've
been broken up with. Does the com
fort she provided all those girls out
weigh the hurt she caused Joe
Jonas? At the end of the day, I'd
prefer she keep writing these dia
tribes against famous men like John
Mayer and Taylor Lautner. For her
to stop writing would be a pity,
many would agree; it would deprive
her audience, teenage girls navigat
ing through the discomforts of ado
lescence, of sisterly guidance and of
a voice that gently reminds them,
"You're not the only one," and, "If I
can get through this, you can too."
Then again, writing about an ex
boyfriend seems like a territory of
its own. He hurt you, and in that
sense, you have a right to hurt him
back. Where the ethical dilemma
becomes fuzzier is when it's a mat
ter of writing about someone you
love and who has not necessarily
done anything to hurt you.
There's a great story by David
Sedaris, "Repeat After Me," that's
about his guilt about writing about
his sister. In the story, he writes
about her nuances, neurotic ten
dencies, personal details of her life;
all the while, she is noticeably tepid
and guarded, afraid that should she
reveal something about herself her
brother will go and put it into writ
ing. At one point, he reflects:
"In order to sleep at night, I
have to remove myself from the
equation, pretending that the peo
ple I love voluntarily chose to

expose themselves. Amy breaks up
with a boyfriend and sends out a
press release. Paul regularly dis
cusses his bowel movements on
daytime talk shows. I'm not the
conduit, but just a poor typist stuck
in the middle."

In the end, he cannot bear to
stop writing about his loved ones;
this he admits with both helpless
ness and guilt. He has accepted,
albeit with much reluctance and
self-delusion, that being a writer
may harm the innocent.
Would I want him to stop writ
ing? Like many, I get a kick out of
reading about his neurotic family, it
makes me feel like it's okay to not
have a picture-perfect nuclear fam
ily. But is it selfish of me to disre
gard those who were hurt in the
making, the people whose imper
fections he has written about to
alleviate shame of my own?
What are your thoughts about
this? Is occasionally hurting those
closest to you a necessary evil of
being a writer? Or can a writer
avoid this, and still not compromise
his or her truthfulness? Does the
comfort of many justify the hurt of
one? I ask because I don't know. In
trying to be selfless with my hon
esty, I have been utterly selfish
when it comes to my human sub
jects. I am not ready to undertake
the lie David Sedaris repeats to
himself. But if I am to be a real
writer, will I have to?

ing? Like many, I get a kick out of
reading about his neurotic family, it
makes me feel like it's okay to not
have a picture-perfect nuclear fam
ily. But is it selfish of me to disre
gard those who were hurt in the
making, the people whose imper
fections he has written about to
alleviate shame of my own?
What are your thoughts about
this? Is occasionally hurting those
closest to you a necessary evil of
being a writer? Or can a writer
avoid this, and still not compromise
his or her truthfulness? Does the
comfort of many justify the hurt of
one? I ask because I don't know. In
trying to be selfless with my hon
esty, I have been utterly selfish
when it comes to my human sub
jects. I am not ready to undertake
the lie David Sedaris repeats to
himself. But if I am to be a real
writer, will I have to?
