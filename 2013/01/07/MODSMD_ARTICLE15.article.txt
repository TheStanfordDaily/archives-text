## Where do we go from here?

Sports is not about winning,
but about losing.
Depressing way to start
my first column after
Stanford's sixth Rose
Bowl victory ever, I know, but it is
true. Winning a handful of games at
the start of the college football sea
son won't take you to the National
Championship Game, but losing
them will guarantee your absence.
Defeats define us far more that victo
ries ever could.

Talk to the average Stanford fan,
and while they'll deservedly be bask
ing in glory right now, there is still
something bittersweet about how the
past year went down. What if? What
if we hadn't dropped that game
against Washington, what if a dubi
ous call against Notre Dame had
gone the other way?
Perhaps the answer will come
next year, with the senior trio of
Shayne Skov, Trent Murphy and Ben
Gardner already signed up for one
more year of Cardinal football and
fans already dreaming of a serious
shot at the national title. But maybe
it won't.

In two seasons in charge, David
Shaw has a 23-4 record as head coach
of Stanford, making him the fourth
best on winning percentage in school
history, the second best when consid
ering only those coaches who spent
two or more years at the helm and
the clear best for the last hundred
years. However, those statistics are
obviously misleading. Shaw took
over a team at the top of its game
and, with last year's top pick in the
NFL Draft returning for his final
season at quarterback, the Cardinal
seemed destined for a solid year in
2011.

That this past season ultimately
turned out to be even better, though,
took many experts by surprise.
Perhaps Shaw still isn't Jim
Harbaugh, the man he replaced, and
the man that rescued Stanford from
the depths of a 1-11 season in 2006.
But not only is he clearly very good
at his day job, maybe, just maybe,
he's even better.

Only time will tell. Only time will
convince the many doubters in the
Southeast. And luckily for Cardinal
fans, time is something we have.
Over the break, Shaw also reaf
firmed his commitment to the school
by signing a longer contract, squash
ing any rumors of his departure to
the NFL before they could get start
ed and before the NFL had had time
to clear room in its coaching setup.
But if there is one certainty in
sport it is that however good you
might think you are, you will always
lose eventually. Notre Dame's regu
lar season was not remarkable
because it won 12 games, but because
it didn't lose a single one.
Few teams can go three whole
years with just five losses count
ing Harbaugh's 12-1 final season
and for good reason. The incessant
four-year turnover of college football
ensures that building a dynasty is
near impossible. Just when you've
developed a star player they leave for
the pros, and should you be unlucky
enough to have unearthed a real
gem, they leave in three, or less.
The decision not to jump ship for
the pros is a tough one to make, espe
cially for senior players who, unlike
Andrew Luck'l2 in 2011, have little
left to prove academically Skov,
Murphy and Gardner should all be
able to graduate this year- â€”. On the
one side, they have a definite shot at
the NFL and a guaranteed income,
even if some college dreams might be
left unfulfilled. On the other, they
risk injury or perhaps a catastrophic
season to settle that unfinished busi
ness. Not only could the decision hurt
their eventual draft position, it could
even cruelly crush that ambition.
The average sports team or play
er knows this. It is fear of losing that
drives them more than a desire to
win. That is why teams often strug
gle to hold onto a lead late in a game;
they suddenly become aware of their
shrinking lead and panic takes hold.
And that is why other teams stage
epic comebacks; losing is just too
agonizing to be considered an option.
A friend of mine recently won her
fantasy football league for the third
straight year. My advice to her was
simple: retire. It is never going to get
better than this, so why risk the pain
and humiliation.

But some people are never happy.
Some people are not happy with
four-straight bowls, three-straight
BCS appearances and two BCS win
ner's trophies. Some people are will
ing to risk it all to achieve the
remarkable and if Stanford some
