# CARD GOES COLD
## Stanford loses to UCLA, USC 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
has picked an inopportune time to go ice
cold shooting the basketball, as a strong
defensive effort in the second half had the
Cardinal thinking upset before losing a
second-straight Pac-12 game on the road
at UCLA Saturday, 68-60.
Coming on the heels of a bitter 71-69
loss at USC (6-9, 1-1 Pac-12) on Thursday
night, head coach Johnny Dawkins' team
stayed in the locker room at Pauley
Pavilion for 56 minutes after the loss, try
ing to get back on track in a hurry or risk
missing out on the NCAA Tournament for
the fifth consecutive season come March.

The disappointing weekend was just the
fourth time head coach Johnny Dawkins'
team has lost back-to-back games since the
start of last year, and had a much better
start than the final record might indicate.
Led by a superb effort from Andy
Brown, the senior forward had 17 points
off the bench, Stanford (9-6, 0-2) took a
commanding nine-point lead into halftime
against the Trojans.
But after the break things quickly went
downhill. USC cut the lead to five within
two minutes, and tied things up at 51 with
11 minutes to play. Stanford shot a sold 51
percent in the first half, but just 26 percent
in the second period (8-30).
Down by two with seconds to play,
sophomore guard Chasson Randle couldn't
convert a driving layup and junior forward
Dwight Powell's dunk attempt slammed off
the rim and out as the Trojans celebrated.
"We knew USC would come out in the
second half.," Dawkins said after the game.
"I talked about that during halftime,
though we did a great job of regrouping
and building a lead back up. However, they
cut the lead and kept fighting and made
plays at the end. It was a great conference
game. They made some crucial plays at the
end and we didn't make the plays we need
to make."
