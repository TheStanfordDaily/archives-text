# CARD GOES COLD
## Stanford loses to UCLA, USC 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basketball team
has picked an inopportune time to go ice
cold shooting the basketball, as a strong
defensive effort in the second half had the
Cardinal thinking upset before losing a
second-straight Pac-12 game on the road
at UCLA Saturday, 68-60.
Coming on the heels of a bitter 71-69
loss at USC (6-9, 1-1 Pac-12) on Thursday
night, head coach Johnny Dawkins' team
stayed in the locker room at Pauley
Pavilion for 56 minutes after the loss, try
ing to get back on track in a hurry or risk
missing out on the NCAA Tournament for
the fifth consecutive season come March.

The disappointing weekend was just the
fourth time head coach Johnny Dawkins'
team has lost back-to-back games since the
start of last year, and had a much better
start than the final record might indicate.
Led by a superb effort from Andy
Brown, the senior forward had 17 points
off the bench, Stanford (9-6, 0-2) took a
commanding nine-point lead into halftime
against the Trojans.
But after the break things quickly went
downhill. USC cut the lead to five within
two minutes, and tied things up at 51 with
11 minutes to play. Stanford shot a sold 51
percent in the first half, but just 26 percent
in the second period (8-30).
Down by two with seconds to play,
sophomore guard Chasson Randle couldn't
convert a driving layup and junior forward
Dwight Powell's dunk attempt slammed off
the rim and out as the Trojans celebrated.
"We knew USC would come out in the
second half.," Dawkins said after the game.
"I talked about that during halftime,
though we did a great job of regrouping
and building a lead back up. However, they
cut the lead and kept fighting and made
plays at the end. It was a great conference
game. They made some crucial plays at the
end and we didn't make the plays we need
to make."

Stanford struggled to shoot the ball effectively against USC and UCLA, but junior forward Dwight
Powell (33) came on strong with 28 points and 18 rebounds combined on the weekend.

Against the Bruins the script
was somewhat reversed, with
UCLA going on a small run to
close the half with a 30-22 lead. It
was all Wear twins, all the time, as
junior twins David and Travis
scored UCLA's first 15 points.
The cold shooting continued for
Stanford, however, with the Card
hitting just 7-26 shots (27 percent),
several of which were from close
range.
"We held UCLA way under
their scoring average," Dawkins
said, "but we have to do a lot better
at making shots. We missed too
many point-blank shots. Some of
our guys are still getting comfort
able in new roles along with fresh
men coming in."
The Bruins kept building their
margin, taking a 15-point lead with
6:33 to play. But the Cardinal
showed some resolve in the final
minutes as UCLA got sloppy and
committed eight turnovers
Stanford scored nine of the
next 11 points to close to 57-49.
Junior forward John Gage scored
five of his 10 points in a row during
the spurt.
Larry Drew 11, who had seven
assists, made a layup that restored
UCLA's lead to 10 points, but
Randle hit a layup and 3-pointer to
get Stanford to 59-54 with 47 sec
onds left.
It wasn't until the Bruins went
9-10 from the line in the final
minute that the game was decided.
Shabazz Muhammed scored 17 of
his 23 points in the second half for
UCLA, winners of seven straight.
Dawkins continues to search
for consistency out of his starting
unit, as Gage and Brown both
started and became the 11th and
12th players to start for Stanford
this season.
And after the game, the team
spent close to an hour in a closed
door meeting before heading back
to the Farm.
"I don't think we should forget
about this game but we have to
move on," Dawkins said after the
USC loss. "There are some lessons
we can learn from this game. I will
take the lessons we learn and that
will help us improve. This is a long
race and it's only one game."
The race continues this week
with Pac-12 clashes at home
against Washington State on
Wednesday and Washington on
Saturday.

able in new roles along with fresh
men coming in."
The Bruins kept building their
margin, taking a 15-point lead with
6:33 to play. But the Cardinal
showed some resolve in the final
minutes as UCLA got sloppy and
committed eight turnovers
Stanford scored nine of the
next 11 points to close to 57-49.
Junior forward John Gage scored
five of his 10 points in a row during
the spurt.
Larry Drew 11, who had seven
assists, made a layup that restored
UCLA's lead to 10 points, but
Randle hit a layup and 3-pointer to
get Stanford to 59-54 with 47 sec
onds left.
It wasn't until the Bruins went
9-10 from the line in the final
minute that the game was decided.
Shabazz Muhammed scored 17 of
his 23 points in the second half for
UCLA, winners of seven straight.
Dawkins continues to search
for consistency out of his starting
unit, as Gage and Brown both
started and became the 11th and
12th players to start for Stanford
this season.
And after the game, the team
spent close to an hour in a closed
door meeting before heading back
to the Farm.
"I don't think we should forget
about this game but we have to
move on," Dawkins said after the
USC loss. "There are some lessons
we can learn from this game. I will
take the lessons we learn and that
will help us improve. This is a long
race and it's only one game."
The race continues this week
with Pac-12 clashes at home
against Washington State on
Wednesday and Washington on
Saturday.
