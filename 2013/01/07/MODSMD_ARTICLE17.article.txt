# Skov, Gardner, Murphy are all in

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Four days after leaving the field
and celebrating Stanford's 20-14 win
in the 99th Rose Bowl, senior line
backers Shayne Skov, Trent Murphy
and Ben Gardner announced that
they will be returning to school next
year to use their final year of eligibil
ity and try to lead the Cardinal back
to the Rose Bowl a year from now in
the BCS National Championship.
All three players had been con
sidered likely draft selections in
April's upcoming NFL Draft and
would have been picked anywhere
from the second to sixth rounds.
Gardner let his Twitter followers
know that he would be returning

first. "For those who are wondering,
I'll be back at #StanU for my sth
year and another big #partyinthe
backfield ... got that crystal ball on
my mind," he tweeted on Saturday
afternoon.
A short while later Skov replied
back to Gardner "The Mohawk
would never leave The Mullet
behind #lmoreyear."
It was only a few hours after
Skov's tweet that Murphy joined the
conversation and announced he too
would be back on the Farm for one
more season.
"Alright, alright, Wouldn't be
right to leave the crew behind. Your
boy's got #lmoreyear at #StanU."
Senior tight ends Zach Ertz and
Levine Toilolo have yet to announce

whether or not they will declare for
the 2013 NFL Draft - the deadline
for underclassmen to enter the draft
and forgo their remaining eligibility
is January 15. Ertz, a unanimous
First Team Ail-American, has been
evaluated as either the first or sec
ond-best NFL prospect at his posi
tion.
In what could have been the
trio's final game in cardinal and
white, the Wisconsin-native Gardner
made the Badgers pay for passing
up on a native son by recording
seven tackles and a pass deflection.
But it was Skov who showed
flashes of returning to his dominant
2010 form with a team-high 11 tack
les and several impressive plays in
Stanford's grinding victory. A torn
MCL and ACL ended Skov's 2011
season prematurely last September,
and he has routinely said that he was
still only playing at perhaps 85 per
cent by the end of this season.
Skov, Gardner and Murphy com
bined for 171 tackles this year, with
Murphy chipping in a team-high 10
sacks and 18 tackles for a loss. Skov
lead he team with 81 stops.
With the progression of a young
offensive line and secondary,
Stanford will likely enter the 2013
regular season with a top-five rank
ing and serious BCS title hopes.
Among the other senior players
eligible and expected to return to
the Farm next season are fullback
Ryan Hewitt, cornerback Terrence
Brown, offensive lineman Kevin
Danser and defensive lineman Josh

Mauro.
