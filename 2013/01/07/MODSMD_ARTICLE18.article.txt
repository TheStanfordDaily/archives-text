# JAMES IS CLUTCH

### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Salt Lake City For the first time since join
ing the Pac-12 a year ago, Utah gave Stanford a
tough game, but in the end, the No. 4 Cardinal
(13-1, 2-0 Pac-12) proved too much for the Utes
(9-4, 0-2) to handle. Stanford used a 15-6 run in
the second half to pull away for a 70-56 victory
at the Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City,
Utah, on Sunday afternoon for the Card's 80th
consecutive conference victory.
The story of the game was the best perform
ance of junior guard Sara James' career. She
provided the spark Stanford needed off the
bench, finishing with 18 points breaking her
previous record of 14 set against San Francisco
in December, 2010 —in 31 minutes of action.
James was remarkably efficient, scoring that 18
on just eight shots, while also contributing four
assists.

Junior forward Chiney Ogwumike, who led
Stanford with 20 points, was excited to see her
classmate excel in such a big way.
"I keep telling people Sara James is the most
competitive person I've ever met, played
with/against in practice," said Ogwumike, "so
I've just been hoping and praying and excited
for her to get her opportunity. Today she had
her opportunity and she maximized it. She was
aggressive, and that's one thing Sara James is."
Aggressiveness was the theme in Stanford's
second-half push.
"In the second half," Ogwumike said. "I
knew we needed to come out more aggressive
and coach says if I do it, others will do it."
At the half, Ogwumike had eight points on
four of ten shooting. In the first seven minutes
of the second half, Ogwumike hit four of five to
help Stanford maintain a seven-point lead after
Utah's best scoring stretch of the game.
Sophomore guard Amber Orrange (16) and
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle (12) joined
Ogwumike and James with double-digit point
totals, though the rest of the Cardinal offense
added only four points. Utah's redshirt senior
guard Iwalani Rodrigues, who was the only
player from either team on the court for all 40
minutes, led all scorers with 21 points.
The Cardinal offense managed to shoot 46.6
percent from the field against a pesky Utah
defense without its starting shooting guard,
junior Toni Kokenis. She played only ten min
utes— none after halftime in her start at
Colorado Friday night and did not dress at Utah
because she wasn't feeling well. Sophomore for
ward Taylor Greenfield started in her place, but
it was James who really stepped up to fill her
fellow junior's shoes.
Stanford saw two streaks come to an end in
Salt Lake City. Chiney Ogwumike did not
record a double-double for the first time since
the Baylor game, snapping a ten-game streak.
She finished with 20 points, but only six
rebounds and five assists.
Additionally, Stanford lost the rebounding
battle, 35-33, for the first time since the season
opener against Fresno St. Utah used its strong
rebounding performance to stay in the game in
the first half, owning an 11-0 edge in second

chance points at the break.
Stanford did, though, extend its conference
winning streak to 80 games with the victory.
The Card's last loss in Pac-12/Pac-10 play came
on Jan. 18, 2009, at California. The Golden
Bears (12-1, 2-0 Pac-12) wrapped up a Rocky
Mountain sweep of their own with a 53-49 win

on Sunday in Boulder after a 55-50 win at Utah
on Friday night. Stanford will travel to Haas
Pavilion to take on No. 7 California Tuesday at
7 p.m. before hosting the Golden Bears at
Maples Pavilion on Sunday.
