## Stanford selects 725 students early Admit rate drops from 12.8 to 11.9 percent for early applicants 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Less than 12 percent of students who
applied early action to the Stanford Class
of 2017 were accepted on Dec. 14, accord
ing to the Office of Undergraduate
Admission. Stanford admitted 725
prospective freshmen from a restrictive
early action pool of 6,103 students, the
largest in the school's history.
The University also deferred action on
572 candidates, whose applications will be
reconsidered in the regular decision
round.
Stanford's recent mentions in the
news such as two University-affiliated
professors winning Nobel Prizes, includ
ing visiting professor Alvin Roth in eco
nomics and School of Medicine professor
Brian Kobilka in chemistry, and the con
tinued success of athletic programs like
the football team, which won the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 1 may have played a role
in this bump in applications, according to
Colleen Lim, the new director of admis
sions, who was appointed to the post in
August.
Last year, 5,880 high school students
applied through the early action process,
a slight dip from 2010 when 5,929 candi
dates applied early. This downtick in
applications coincided with Harvard and
Princeton's relaunch of their early action
programs. Lim said that the new growth
in applications shows that Stanford has
not been significantly affected by the
decision of these peer institutions to bring
back early action.
"Our number [of applicants] continues
to rise," she said. "In that way, there has
n't been a really big impact because our
pool is still extraordinary in terms of the
depth and the extraordinary accomplish
ments of the students who have applied
here."
She noted the diversity represented in
this early group of admits, which includes
representation from 43 states and 28
