## Stanford selects 725 students early Admit rate drops from 12.8 to 11.9 percent for early applicants 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Less than 12 percent of students who
applied early action to the Stanford Class
of 2017 were accepted on Dec. 14, accord
ing to the Office of Undergraduate
Admission. Stanford admitted 725
prospective freshmen from a restrictive
early action pool of 6,103 students, the
largest in the school's history.
The University also deferred action on
572 candidates, whose applications will be
reconsidered in the regular decision
round.
Stanford's recent mentions in the
news such as two University-affiliated
professors winning Nobel Prizes, includ
ing visiting professor Alvin Roth in eco
nomics and School of Medicine professor
Brian Kobilka in chemistry, and the con
tinued success of athletic programs like
the football team, which won the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 1 may have played a role
in this bump in applications, according to
Colleen Lim, the new director of admis
sions, who was appointed to the post in
August.
Last year, 5,880 high school students
applied through the early action process,
a slight dip from 2010 when 5,929 candi
dates applied early. This downtick in
applications coincided with Harvard and
Princeton's relaunch of their early action
programs. Lim said that the new growth
in applications shows that Stanford has
not been significantly affected by the
decision of these peer institutions to bring
back early action.
"Our number [of applicants] continues
to rise," she said. "In that way, there has
n't been a really big impact because our
pool is still extraordinary in terms of the
depth and the extraordinary accomplish
ments of the students who have applied
here."
She noted the diversity represented in
this early group of admits, which includes
representation from 43 states and 28
countries. According to Lim, there is also a
growth in the number of students interested
in the humanities among the accepted class,
showing an increased diversity of academic
interests.
Thirty fewer students were admitted
through the restrictive early action process
than last year, when 755 early action candi
dates received acceptance letters. The news
came a day after Harvard announced that it
accepted 16 percent more students through
its early action program than last year.
According to Lim, the University chose to
admit fewer students this year in order to
provide more opportunities for more candi
dates in the regular decision round.
"We anticipate that we are going to
receive another 29,000 to 30,000 applica
tions," Lim said. "We want to provide the
opportunity for those students in our pool as
well."
She also noted that the University would
probably end up admitting fewer students in
the regular decision round as well given a
higher-than-expected yield rate last year,
which resulted in 50 more students accepting
their Stanford offer of admission than antici
pated. As a result, the admissions office did
not take any students off its wait list, and

Stanford Student Housing had to avert its
initial plan to turn Gavilan House in Florence
Moore Hall from an all-frosh to four-class
dorm.
This year, Stanford extended its early
application deadline by four days from Nov. 1
to Nov. 5 due to the potential impact of
Hurricane Sandy. Lim said that the move
allowed students affected by the hurricane to
be considered in the early action round, with
the University receiving "quite a few" appli
cations after the deadline from impacted
areas.
She also added that the office is aware
that some students were still not able to
meet this extended deadline, but that many
of them are still planning to submit their
application in the regular decision round.
With the first application round behind
her as director of admissions, Lim said she
planned "to get some rest" and prepare for
the regular decision round, whose applica
tions were due Jan. 1. She credited the rest
of the admissions team for a smooth first
round.
"Everybody took great pride in providing
every student the opportunity to present
themselves [in their applications], and then
[for us] to read them holistically," she said.
"Our returning staff really mentored some of
our first-years, and everybody contributed
to a great process from our end."
