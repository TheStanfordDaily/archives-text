# Dammed trout prompt federal probe
## Stanford's operation of Searsville Dam under federal investigation 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Edward Ngai 
The National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) is investigating Stanford's opera
tion of Searsville Dam in order to determine
whether the University has violated the
Endangered Species Act by blocking steel
head trout from migrating to spawning
streams.

The Searsville Dam, in the Jasper Park
Biological Preserve, is owned and operated
by Stanford. Some of the water from the
adjacent lake is used to irrigate Stanford's
golf course and other facilities. It was once a
recreational area, but a 1998 study showed
the dam trapped sediment in Searsville
Lake; today, the lake carries less than 10 per
cent of its former capacity.
The 65-foot dam also blocks steelhead
trout, categorized as a threatened species by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), from migrating to
their historical habitat.
According to Matt Stoeker, director of the
Beyond Searsville Dam Coalition, a nonprofit

organization that advocates for the removal of
the dam, the University was tin-eared in the
face of community pressure to make the dam
more environmentally friendly.
"While we're disappointed that Stanford
chose to take a path of resistance, avoidance
and lack of collaboration for so many years,
we are happy to see that NMFS has decided
that enough is enough and has opened an
investigation," Stoeker said in a press
release. "This investigation punctuates a
decade of missed opportunities by Stanford."
The University's 2010 Habitat
Conservation Plan did not recommend any
action on the Searsville Dam, prompting the
University to assemble a committee to inves

tigate the dam's future. The committee of five
faculty members includes Chris Field, a biol
ogy professor and faculty director for the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve; Jeffrey
Koseff, professor in the School of
Engineering and the director of the Woods
Institute for the Environment; Pamela
Matson, dean of the School of Earth Sciences
and a professor in environmental studies;
Barton Thompson Jr., a professor of natural
resources law and the director of the Woods
Institute and Richard White, an American
history professor.
The committee is due to report their find-

ings by the end of 2013.
