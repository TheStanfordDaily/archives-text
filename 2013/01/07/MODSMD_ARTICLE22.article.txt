## WHAT WE MISSED OVER BREAK Holiday movie roundup 
### Alex Kennedy, Emma Townley-Smith Lauren Wilson | Staff Writers 
"This is 40"
"This is 40" is Judd Apatow's latest movie and the "sort-of sequel" to
"Knocked Up." This subtitie is generally misleading and disappointing: This movie
isn't nearly as well-written or well-executed, and you will not laugh nearly as hard
as you did in "Knocked Up."
That said, if you like really like Judd Apatow's jokes, Leslie Mann's (aka Mrs.
Apatow) acting and the Apatow kids' sassiness, you'll probably enjoy a few good
laughs and be pretty entertained by this movie. That's because at the end of this
day, this movie would be more aptly named "This is The Apatow Show" instead of
"This is 40." The story of Pete and Debbie, who you may remember as the older
sister and brother-in-law of Katherine Heigl's character in "Knocked Up," attempts
to illustrate the existential crises of the fifth decade of upper-middle class, L.A. life.
Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann get into some moderately entertaining hijinks here
and there, but in general their Lexus-driving, personal-trainer-included lifestyle is
doing just fine, and their problems in no way deserve the two-plus hours of cover
age they're given in this film. AK

"The Guilt Trip"
"The Guilt Trip" is the story of Andy, the lovable inventor played by Seth Rogen,
and his sometimes overbearing, familiar feeling mother, played by Barbara Streisand.
The ChemE majors among us will appreciate Andy's revolutionary, eco-friendly cleaning
product, but the rest of us will be sympathetic to the story line, in which Andy struggles
to market his poorly named product to a variety of big businesses and retailers. The less
believable turn of events is that Andy develops a sudden interest in his mother's one true
love, who also happens to be his namesake. This interest leads Andy to look up said gen
tleman and plan an extra stop at the end of his nationwide sales pitch tour. Finally, he
invites his unknowing mother along under the guise of moral support and bonding, and
the rest is fairly predictable comedy. Streisand and Rogen make a cute family, and ulti
mately the movie is pretty funny for what it is, which is, of course, a moderately generic
Seth Rogen comedy. AK

"Promised Land"
"Promised Land," co-written by John Krasinski and Matt Damon, who also
costar in the film, paints a picture of a transitioning America, as illustrated by the
rural small town politics of the debate over the use of fracking beneath farmlands.
"Promised Land" highlights the significance of the American dream, tantalizing
nature of money in a recession-struck country and terrifying power of multi-bil
lion dollar corporations.
In what often feels like a competition of charisma, Damon, the gas company
exec, and Krasinski, the environmentalist advocate, vie for support from the town.
Predictably, they also compete for the affections of the same love interest, the local
schoolteacher (played by Rosemarie DeWitt). However, this minor element of the
plot is the only predictable thing about this film. Standout performances from
supporting actress Frances McDormand and lead John Krasinski, coupled with
sharp dialogue and well-constructed plot development, make this movie captivat
ing from start to finish. AK

"Django Unchained"
"Django Unchained" is Quentin Tarantino's latest revenge flick set in
the antebellum South. Even those of us who aren't Film Studies majors are
probably familiar with either "Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's most famous film,
or "Inglorious Basterds," the more recent WWII-themed hit. Tarantino afi
cionados and first-timers alike will recognize several of the cast members in
"Django Unchained" including Samuel L. Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Jamie Foxx and Christopher Waltz, who you may remember as the Ã¼ber
scary Lt. Hans Landa from "Basterds."
Christopher Waltz stars opposite Jamie Foxx as a humorous yet badass
bounty hunter, and mentors Django (Foxx) to become a bounty hunter too
after freeing him from slavery. Between the backdrop of American slavery
and the nature of the bounty hunter trade, there is no shortage of violence
and brutality throughout this film. The intensity and frequency of violent
scenes in "Django" likely makes it inaccessible to the faint of heart, and the
amount of violence that's inflicted upon characters that aren't "bad guys"
might make even lifelong Tarantino fans a little squeamish at times. Other
highlights of "Django" include DiCaprio as a very compelling villain, and an
awesome soundtrack featuring a wide range of artists, from Rick Ross to
John Legend. AK

"The Hobbit:
An Unexpected Journey"
Love it or hate it, the first of Peter Jackson's
three Hobbit movies, "The Hobbit: An
Unexpected Journey," was a box office hit.
According to statements released by members of
"The Hobbit" crew, the opening of this prequel
exceeded the size of all the Lord of the Rings
movies and set the record for biggest December
opening in history. Numbers would suggest that
fans of the Tolkien canon went in with high
hopes.
One challenge that the movie faces is mak
ing what is essentially a wandering children's
story into a coherent and logical film for adults.
Small scenes and encounters in the book get
blown out of proportion into key plot points,
which can make the movie seem disjointed and
jarring at times when transitioning between
scenes. For audience members only acquainted
with The Hobbit in its original text, the inclu
sion of details from Tolkien's appendices can be
disorienting. Juxtaposed with "The Lord of the
Rings'" comparatively fast and streamlined nar
rative, "The Hobbit" can seem slow and

unwieldy in its levels of detail. Many movie
goers questioned the necessity of
three full movies to cover the
material of a single, rela
tively short book. V
The choice to shoot the
film in 3D and at 48
frames per second, twice
the normal film speed,
has also been subject to
mixed reviews. In an
interview with The
Huffington Post,
Peter Jackson expressed
his admiration for "this
incredibly vivid, realistic looking
image" created by the high frame
rate, which eliminates the motion
blur caused by the slower frame rate
that movie-goers are accustomed to.
However, for audience members who
are used to the 24 frames per second
film, which has been the cinema stan-

"Les Miserables"
Tom Hooper's adaptation of "Les Miserables" is just
as grandiose as you'd expect. Alain Boublil and Claude-
Michel Schonberg's musical behemoth rolls out onscreen
with all the lush sets and feel-good emotion as the stage
production. Hugh Jackman, who earned his Broadway
cred with a Tony for "The Boy From Oz," takes the lead as
the virtuous Jean Valjean while Anne Hathaway stirs up
Oscar buzz as Fantine, the prostitute with a heart of gold.
Hooper lets the original material stand by itself, for
going the traditional Hollywood method of prerecording
vocals in favor of his stars singing live on tape. Hathaway
may not belt "I Dreamed A Dream" as forcefully as Susan
Boyle but her rendition is more stirring, full of the quiet
anguish and heartbreak of a woman whose life has fallen to
pieces. The rest of the cast turns in mostly admirable per
formances. "Next to Normal's" Aaron Tveit (also Tripp

This winter, Senta blesse us with a slew of much-anticipated movie for the
whole family. From "Django Unchained," for the Tarantino lovers in your
clan, to "This is 40," for the Apatow devotees, there was no shortage of
cinematic diversions this holiday season. Now that we're back on the Farm,
Intermission has compiled some short and sweet reviews to help you choose
wisely your next movie excursion.

dard since the 19305, the high frame rate can be
overwhelming. A super sharp image can actually
detract from the main focus of the scenes and
make it difficult to become immersed in the
story as filmmakers generally intend, especially
when combined with rapid panning and camera
motion. The clear definition of every detail and
the excessive use of computer-generated
imagery in some scenes made parts of the film
feel like a video game cut scene rather than the
sweeping, visual expanse that Lord of the Rings
fans may have been expecting.
Though "The Hobbit" did inspire some
discussions of narrative and adaptation, the
reviews have largely been focused on audience
impressions of the 3D and frame rate, and on
this film as a gateway to the future of filmmak
ing. As newer technologies strive to further
enhance the audience's visual experience, at
what point does it become too much? We'll
withhold judgment until we see "Avatar 2."
ET

Vanderbilt in "Gossip Girl") soars as the passionate and
idealistic student leader, Enjolras. Samantha Barks reprises
her role as Eponine for the big screen after cutting her
teeth on London's West End. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie
Redmayne are perfectly pleasant in their respective roles as
the young lovers Cosette and Marius. The same goes for
Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the
Thenardiers, the evil innkeepers and the film's comic relief.
Russell Crowe is really the only noticeable weakness in an
otherwise solid ensemble. His rock band experience does
n't translate well as the tormented Inspector Javert,
Valjean's foil. Crowe's unpolished, rock star growl simply
doesn't fit into a traditional musical about 1830s France.
"Spring Awakening," this is not.
So in a musical with a gigantic cast about a French
uprising that isn't the French Revolution, how do you con
nect with the audience? Hooper takes a no-frills approach
to filming his actors, keeping the camera still and intimate
ly close. It's a strategy that does add to the emotional wal
lop of the performances. However, Hooper overuses the
technique so much that its effect wanes over the film's two
and a half hour duration. By the time the camera zooms in
on Marius during his plaintive "Empty Chairs at Empty
Tables," the impact is less a poignant glimpse of survivor's
guilt and more a convenient time to count Redmayne's
abundance of freckles.
Over-zooming aside, Hooper otherwise translates the
beloved musical with aplomb. Fans can exhale in relief.
This adaptation can nestle comfortably next to other suc
cessful musical adaptations like "Chicago" and "Grease,"
hopefully leaving room for a future film adaptation of
Boublil and Schonberg's other hit, "Miss Saigon." LW
