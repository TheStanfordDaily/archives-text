Jamie Meltzer has struck gold with his lat
est award. Meltzer, an assistant professor at
Stanford's M.F.A. program in
Documentary Film and Video, won a Goldie
(Guardian Outstanding Local Discovery) award
for film this past November. Goldie recipients are
artists chosen by the San Francisco Bay Guardian
editors and contributors.
"I was very excited and just honored,
because it's coming from the Bay Area arts com
munity that I grew up in, in terms of graduate
school, and that I now live and work in," Meltzer
said.
But this Goldie is not the only award
Meltzer's received. His most recent documentary,
"Informant" (2012), has so far won the Grand
Jury Prize at the DOC NYC, New York's
Documentary Festival, and the Best Documentary
Feature Award at the Austin Film Festival
"Informant" examines the life of Brandon Darby, a
left-wing activist-turned FBI informant. The film
is currently in distribution; its world premiere
screening was at the San Francisco International

Film Festival and screenings are to come at Big
Sky Documentary Festival in February and The
Doc Yard in March.
Meltzer lists Errol Morris and Werner
Herzog as filmmaking influences. He draws inspi
ration for his films from subjects that catch his
attention.
For instance, a journalist friend of Meltzer's
told him about four exonerated men who started
a detective agency in Dallas and to look into
other cases like theirs, a process Meltzer found
"inexhaustible." He had heard of documentaries
and articles about exonerated men, but the new
ploy of a detective agency drew him in.
Meltzer has been working on this new proj
ect, "Freedom Fighters", for six to eight months.
The documentary follows these men, who
spent between 15 and 26 years in prison for
crimes they did not commit, as they work on
their first couple of investigations to free
wrongfully convicted peers. Meltzer flies down
to Texas for shoots during his free time in his
teaching schedule and, most likely, the upcoming

summer vacation.
Back at Stanford, Meltzer teaches graduate
students in film production courses and has
taught undergraduates in FILMPROD 114, an
introduction to film and video production class.
"There is no better job as far as I'm concerned," he
said.
Prior to Stanford, he taught at his alma
mater Vassar's film department. Meltzer double
majored in English and film there, then graduat
ed from San Francisco State with a M.F.A. in
Cinema. His master's thesis film on song-poems,
collaborations in which people send in lyrics to
companies who spin them into songs for a fee,
became "Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story"
(2003). "Off the Charts," his first feature film, aired
on PBS' Independent Lens series.
Other films include "Welcome to
Nollywood" (2008), about the booming Nigerian
film industry, and "La Caminata" (2009), on the
eponymous small town tourist-attraction that
simulates border crossing.
"Making a documentary is sometimes a

three or four year process, so you want to go
engage with something that you don't immedi
ately know how to feel about," Meltzer said.
Finding the storyline is the main goal and
challenge Meltzer faces for each documentary.
"The process of making a film is the process
of figuring out how you want to feel about it," he
said. "So many times you're worried the whole
story is going to fall apart on you."
Other challenges he named were creative,
time and financial limitations.
Despite these challenges, Meltzer has been
interested in documentary filmmaking since he
was a teenager. He attributes the recent distribu
tions of films like "The Imposter" and
"Searching for Sugar Man" to a "new golden age
for documentary."
"Documentary is this overlooked form. It's
somewhat popular but not as popular as it
should be," he said.
"What filmmakers are doing are innovative
ways to tell real life stories and transform them into
artfully-told stories into art."
