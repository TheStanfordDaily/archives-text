## Students call for divestment from fossil fuels University 'receptive' to group's environmental concerns 
### HELIN GAO 
Joining a nationwide movement cur
rently involving 192 colleges, a group of
Stanford students recently kicked off a
fossil fuel divestment campaign on cam
pus, which aims to persuade the school
endowment fund to rid its investment
portfolio of oil, coal and gas stocks within
the next five years.
Within the last three weeks, the cam
paign has presented a petition endorsed
by over 30 students in the core organizing
team to University President John
Hennessy. The core team garners most of
its support from environmental student
groups on campus, such as the Green
Living Council and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford.
The campaign is in part inspired by a
grass-roots organization, 350.org's Do
The Math tour. Writer-turned-activist Bill
McKibben and other organization mem
bers toured 21 U.S. cities urging students
to start local divestment campaigns that
target fossil fuel companies.
Since its kickoff on Nov. 7 in Seattle,
the tour has inspired a nationwide envi
ronmental initiative on college campuses.
Sophie Harrison 'l6 was in the audience
when McKibben made the speech in Palo
Alto on Nov. 10.
"It's so exciting and inspiring to see
what is happening in other campuses, and
I think Stanford should be a part of it,"
Harrison said.
