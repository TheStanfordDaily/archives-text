## Students call for divestment from fossil fuels University 'receptive' to group's environmental concerns 
### HELIN GAO 
Joining a nationwide movement cur
rently involving 192 colleges, a group of
Stanford students recently kicked off a
fossil fuel divestment campaign on cam
pus, which aims to persuade the school
endowment fund to rid its investment
portfolio of oil, coal and gas stocks within
the next five years.
Within the last three weeks, the cam
paign has presented a petition endorsed
by over 30 students in the core organizing
team to University President John
Hennessy. The core team garners most of
its support from environmental student
groups on campus, such as the Green
Living Council and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford.
The campaign is in part inspired by a
grass-roots organization, 350.org's Do
The Math tour. Writer-turned-activist Bill
McKibben and other organization mem
bers toured 21 U.S. cities urging students
to start local divestment campaigns that
target fossil fuel companies.
Since its kickoff on Nov. 7 in Seattle,
the tour has inspired a nationwide envi
ronmental initiative on college campuses.
Sophie Harrison 'l6 was in the audience
when McKibben made the speech in Palo
Alto on Nov. 10.
"It's so exciting and inspiring to see
what is happening in other campuses, and
I think Stanford should be a part of it,"
Harrison said.
Following the talk, the students held their
first meeting to discuss what a divestment
movement would look like at Stanford.
Students who joined the group said that
Stanford, with its rich innovation history and
past record of green initiatives, should be a
role model in sustainable investment by
divesting from companies in the fossil fuel
industry.
"Given that we are in Silicon Valley and
[given] our investment in technology
throughout our history, I have no doubt that
we are going to be able to work towards that
goal," said Sasha Brownsberger 'l4, a mem
ber of the movement organizing team and co
president of the Green Living Council.
While the campaign is still in its launching
stage, it is seeking attention from students.
Three students wrote an op-ed for The Daily,
calling for the school administration's atten
tion to "set an example by withdrawing its
support for an industry that is crippling our
planet." ("Why Stanford should divest from
fossil fuels," Dec. 4,2012)
"It's really cool to start to talk to students
about it," Harrison said. "I have people
whom I've never met sending me email say
ing that I've heard about this divestment
movement's evolvement on the campus, and

I hope to be part of it."
The campaign has gained support from
the environmental groups on campus but
remains independent from any organization.
"At current stance, until things become
more formalized, we will probably better
serve by maintaining focus on our tradition
al approach to sustainability and helping out
with the new divestment campaign on a per
son-by-person basis," Brownsberger said.
Student organizers met with Senior
Assistant to the President Jeff Wachtel to
discuss their concerns.
"[University officials] don't seem fully on
board yet, but they seem receptive,"
Harrison said. "We met with [Wachtel], and
we delivered our letter. We had an informal
meeting to present our letter and our inten
tions. They even suggested to us how we can
move forward in the process"
The group is seeking wider support from
both the administration and the student pop
ulation, calling for non-environmental
groups to join the campaign.
"Climate change is an issue that tran
scends student group interest," Harrison
said. 'We hope to get support from other stu
dent groups to get beyond the boundary of
traditional environmental campaigns."
The last Stanford University divestment on
ethical grounds was in 2005, from four com
panies operating in Sudan.
