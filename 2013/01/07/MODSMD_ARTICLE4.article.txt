## STANFORD WINS 99TH ROSE BOWL 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Pasadena, Calif. It wasn't pretty, but
Stanford proved yet again that its "Blue
Collar" style of play is as efficient as ever
with a grinding 20-14 win over Wisconsin in
the Rose Bowl on Ihesday.
After racing out to an early 14-point
lead in the first quarter thanks to some cre
ative play calling from head coach David
Shaw and two outstanding receptions,
Stanford was all but shut down on offense
for the rest of the game. But two Jordan
Williamson field goals were all the Cardinal
would need, as the 99th edition of "The
Grandaddy of Them All" wound up a defen
sive struggle that the Badgers had a
chance to win until the very end.
Only when redshirt junior nose tackle
Josh Mauro reached up and tipped Curt
Phillips' pass into the hands of sprawling
senior nicklebaek Usua Amanam with the
Badgers chiving into Cardinal territory did
the large Stanford contingent of fans begin
to celebrate with little over two minutes to
play.
"I read pass," Amanam said, "so I got
into my drop and then I felt the quarter
back coming back towards the middle of
the field. He went to unwind, I think some
one got a hand on it and I just saw the ball
fluttering into my hands.
"I mean I can't even tell you what I was
thinking. I was thinking about my mom,
about my family, about this team. Coach
Mason always talks about don't count the
plays make the plays count, and that's what
I lived by today."
Early on it didn't seem like Stanford
would need Amanam's interception, the
game's lone turnover, or any kind of late
game heroics to cement its first Rose Bowl
victory since 1972. A rushing touchdown by
Kelsey Young on the game's first posses
sion was quickly followed by another score
on the ground for senior running back
Stepfan Taylor and a 14-0 lead before some
