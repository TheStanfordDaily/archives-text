## STANFORD WINS 99TH ROSE BOWL 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Pasadena, Calif. It wasn't pretty, but
Stanford proved yet again that its "Blue
Collar" style of play is as efficient as ever
with a grinding 20-14 win over Wisconsin in
the Rose Bowl on Ihesday.
After racing out to an early 14-point
lead in the first quarter thanks to some cre
ative play calling from head coach David
Shaw and two outstanding receptions,
Stanford was all but shut down on offense
for the rest of the game. But two Jordan
Williamson field goals were all the Cardinal
would need, as the 99th edition of "The
Grandaddy of Them All" wound up a defen
sive struggle that the Badgers had a
chance to win until the very end.
Only when redshirt junior nose tackle
Josh Mauro reached up and tipped Curt
Phillips' pass into the hands of sprawling
senior nicklebaek Usua Amanam with the
Badgers chiving into Cardinal territory did
the large Stanford contingent of fans begin
to celebrate with little over two minutes to
play.
"I read pass," Amanam said, "so I got
into my drop and then I felt the quarter
back coming back towards the middle of
the field. He went to unwind, I think some
one got a hand on it and I just saw the ball
fluttering into my hands.
"I mean I can't even tell you what I was
thinking. I was thinking about my mom,
about my family, about this team. Coach
Mason always talks about don't count the
plays make the plays count, and that's what
I lived by today."
Early on it didn't seem like Stanford
would need Amanam's interception, the
game's lone turnover, or any kind of late
game heroics to cement its first Rose Bowl
victory since 1972. A rushing touchdown by
Kelsey Young on the game's first posses
sion was quickly followed by another score
on the ground for senior running back
Stepfan Taylor and a 14-0 lead before some

fans had even reached their seats.
But the Badgers' defense
clamped down hard with Hall of
Fame coach Barry Alvarez back on
the sideline for a one-game stint
seven year's after retiring from head
coaching with Wisconsin and 13 after
taking down Stanford on the same
field at the 2000 Rose Bowl.
"This group of kids has been
through a lot, and they competed
extremely hard against a very high
quality team," Alvarez said. "We've
played three very good football
games (at the Rose Bowl). These
guys played hard. In fact, most peo
ple would like to get here once. But
we just didn't get it done."
They certainly came close, howev
er.
Stanford stopped James White
inside the 1-yard line on fourth down
early in the second quarter after a
touchdown run by Ball was wiped out
by a holding penalty, but Ball scored
on the next chive. The Badgers then
mounted an 85-yard drive just before
halftime, with a 38-yard scamper
from Phillips setting up a short TD
catch that trimmed Stanford's half
time lead to 17-14.
"We knew coming in, it was going

to be a physical game," Taylor said.
"We knew they know how to play
against power as well as us. They did
a great job. It was our* defense keep
ing us in the game that enabled us to
get this win."
Linebackers AJ Tarpley and
Shayne Skov led the team with nine
tackles, and safety Jordan Richards
had two tackles for a loss and a bone
crunching hit to force an incomple
tion late. With senior nose tackle
Terrence Stephens ineligible due to a
secondary NCAA violation, Mauro
and junior David Parry stepped up
and filled the gaps inside with 10 total

tackles, repeatedly forcing
Wisconsin's big front line out of its
blocking assignments.
Ball, the NCAA career-leader in
rushing touchdowns managed to
claw his way to 100 yards on 24 car
ries, and the Badgers managed 218
yards total on the ground, but it was
n't enough.
"This stings just as much, because
we fell extremely short when we had
the opportunity to win," Ball said.
"We had numerous opportunities to
capitalize on big plays, and we fell
short.... This is not the way we want
to be remembered. Speaking for the
entire senior group, this is not the
way we wanted to go out."
But it was exactly what Amanam
and the rest of Stanford's senior class
had in mind.

"This has been our No. 1 goal
coming in as freshmen," Amanam
said. "We came in and always heard
the older guys talk about 'Rose Bowl
this, Rose Bowl that.' To see it finally
materialize and to be in this moment
is an amazing feeling and I honestly
can't even describe it."

Pasadena, Calif. It wasn't pretty, but
Stanford proved yet again that its "Blue
Collar" style of play is as efficient as ever
with a grinding 20-14 win over Wisconsin in
the Rose Bowl on Ihesday.
After racing out to an early 14-point
lead in the first quarter thanks to some cre
ative play calling from head coach David
Shaw and two outstanding receptions,
Stanford was all but shut down on offense
for the rest of the game. But two Jordan
Williamson field goals were all the Cardinal
would need, as the 99th edition of "The
Grandaddy of Them All" wound up a defen
sive struggle that the Badgers had a
chance to win until the very end.
Only when redshirt junior nose tackle
Josh Mauro reached up and tipped Curt
Phillips' pass into the hands of sprawling
senior nicklebaek Usua Amanam with the
Badgers chiving into Cardinal territory did
the large Stanford contingent of fans begin
to celebrate with little over two minutes to
play.
"I read pass," Amanam said, "so I got
into my drop and then I felt the quarter
back coming back towards the middle of
the field. He went to unwind, I think some
one got a hand on it and I just saw the ball
fluttering into my hands.
"I mean I can't even tell you what I was
thinking. I was thinking about my mom,
about my family, about this team. Coach
Mason always talks about don't count the
plays make the plays count, and that's what
I lived by today."
Early on it didn't seem like Stanford
would need Amanam's interception, the
game's lone turnover, or any kind of late
game heroics to cement its first Rose Bowl
victory since 1972. A rushing touchdown by
Kelsey Young on the game's first posses
sion was quickly followed by another score
on the ground for senior running back
Stepfan Taylor and a 14-0 lead before some

fans had even reached their seats.
But the Badgers' defense
clamped down hard with Hall of
Fame coach Barry Alvarez back on
the sideline for a one-game stint
seven year's after retiring from head
coaching with Wisconsin and 13 after
taking down Stanford on the same
field at the 2000 Rose Bowl.
"This group of kids has been
through a lot, and they competed
extremely hard against a very high
quality team," Alvarez said. "We've
played three very good football
games (at the Rose Bowl). These
guys played hard. In fact, most peo
ple would like to get here once. But
we just didn't get it done."
They certainly came close, howev
er.
Stanford stopped James White
inside the 1-yard line on fourth down
early in the second quarter after a
touchdown run by Ball was wiped out
by a holding penalty, but Ball scored
on the next chive. The Badgers then
mounted an 85-yard drive just before
halftime, with a 38-yard scamper
from Phillips setting up a short TD
catch that trimmed Stanford's half
time lead to 17-14.
"We knew coming in, it was going

to be a physical game," Taylor said.
"We knew they know how to play
against power as well as us. They did
a great job. It was our* defense keep
ing us in the game that enabled us to
get this win."
Linebackers AJ Tarpley and
Shayne Skov led the team with nine
tackles, and safety Jordan Richards
had two tackles for a loss and a bone
crunching hit to force an incomple
tion late. With senior nose tackle
Terrence Stephens ineligible due to a
secondary NCAA violation, Mauro
and junior David Parry stepped up
and filled the gaps inside with 10 total

tackles, repeatedly forcing
Wisconsin's big front line out of its
blocking assignments.
Ball, the NCAA career-leader in
rushing touchdowns managed to
claw his way to 100 yards on 24 car
ries, and the Badgers managed 218
yards total on the ground, but it was
n't enough.
"This stings just as much, because
we fell extremely short when we had
the opportunity to win," Ball said.
"We had numerous opportunities to
capitalize on big plays, and we fell

to be remembered. Speaking for the
