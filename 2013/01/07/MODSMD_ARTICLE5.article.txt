## H&S pushes for shortened, five-year Ph.D. tracks 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The School of Humanities &
Sciences has requested depart
ments submit proposals to
redesign their doctoral programs
to shorten the time it takes to
obtain a degree to about five year's
on average.
The request for proposals sent
out by Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities & Sciences,
and Debra Satz, associate dean,
was in direct response to a request
for restructuring the humanities
doctoral program at Stanford sub

humanities faculty led by Russell
Berman, professor in German
studies and comparative literature.
In the request, department
chairs and directors of doctoral
programs are asked to consider
"restructuring curricular offerings
... modifying examinations,
improving the quality of mentoring

doctoral program is a nationwide

effort, and concerns over decreas

positions are driving the talks.
"There's been a massive
shrinkage in the academic job mar

Berman said.
Gabriella Safran, director of the
Division of Language and Cultural
Literature (DLCL) and one of the
senior faculty members who
worked with Berman last spring to
send the request for restructuring
to the dean's office, said that with a
smaller window of opportunity,
shortening the time to degree will
prove useful for graduates pursu

ing academic careers.
"Students who get out of their
Ph.D. programs sooner are more
likely to get the tenure-track jobs
that are kind of the prize that most
go into graduate school wanting,"
Safran said.
Five-year Ph.D. optional for
departments
Departments are not required
to submit a proposal, and submis
sions will be department-specific
and reviewed as such.
Sailer said that while some
