## H&S pushes for shortened, five-year Ph.D. tracks 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
The School of Humanities &
Sciences has requested depart
ments submit proposals to
redesign their doctoral programs
to shorten the time it takes to
obtain a degree to about five year's
on average.
The request for proposals sent
out by Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities & Sciences,
and Debra Satz, associate dean,
was in direct response to a request
for restructuring the humanities
doctoral program at Stanford sub

mitted by an ad hoc group of senior
humanities faculty led by Russell
Berman, professor in German
studies and comparative literature.
In the request, department
chairs and directors of doctoral
programs are asked to consider
"restructuring curricular offerings
... modifying examinations,
improving the quality of mentoring
... and revising dissertation expec
tations."
A national conversation
Berman said that the discus
sion on redesigning the humanities
doctoral program is a nationwide

effort, and concerns over decreas
ing opportunities for tenure-track
positions are driving the talks.
"There's been a massive
shrinkage in the academic job mar
ket since the crisis of 2008,"
Berman said.
Gabriella Safran, director of the
Division of Language and Cultural
Literature (DLCL) and one of the
senior faculty members who
worked with Berman last spring to
send the request for restructuring
to the dean's office, said that with a
smaller window of opportunity,
shortening the time to degree will
prove useful for graduates pursu

ing academic careers.
"Students who get out of their
Ph.D. programs sooner are more
likely to get the tenure-track jobs
that are kind of the prize that most
go into graduate school wanting,"
Safran said.
Five-year Ph.D. optional for
departments
Departments are not required
to submit a proposal, and submis
sions will be department-specific
and reviewed as such.
Sailer said that while some
departments, like Slavic Language and
Literature in the DLCL, are excited to submit
proposals, some are wary of changing the tradi
tional curriculum.
"I know that some faculty worry that short
ening the time to degree is just a cover for
doing a much less good job, and I don't think
that that's necessarily time," Sailer said.
Though Sailer is cautious of major restruc
turing efforts, such as turning a single
research-based dissertation into a collection of
scholarly articles on various topics, he believes
that not all doctoral programs need to take
eight to 10 years to complete.
Within the Slavic Languages and
Literature Department, Safran said changes
have already been made to allow for a more
efficient doctoral process, such as allowing stu
dents to complete teaching obligations in the
second year instead of the third to dedicate
more time to the dissertation.
After the Ph.D.
Shortening the time to degree, though ben
eficial for tenure and academic careers, also
brings up the issue that many humanities doc
toral recipients go into public sector careers
where a traditional doctoral curriculum may
not be as directly applicable.
Berman said that students are not fully
aware of the various teaching, nonprofit and
governmental career options available with a
doctoral degree in the humanities.
While the request for proposals states that
submissions must address increasing aware
ness and guidance in choosing non-academic
careers, Sailer said that tackling this issue is
difficult because "students don't know ahead
of time" what career track they will pursue.
"By far the great majority of our students
coming into the doctoral program are thinking
about academic careers, and some other kind
of career may be a default," Sailer said.
Incentivizing shorter time to degree
Departments will have a funding incentive

to help reduce the time to degree by providing
summer funding for proposals that contain
"clear benchmarking and a mechanism for the
monitoring of results."
Safran said that while the Slavic
Department's latest completed dissertation took
seven years less than the national average
had the student received summer funding he
may have only taken six years to finish without
having to split time working a full-time job over
the summer.
Even with the incentive and value of restruc
turing the doctoral program, Safran is con
cerned that speeding up the time to degree
would make it harder for students to take as
many electives as they do now.
"We give our graduate students traditionally
more freedom than they have at other institu
tions," Safran said. "I am concerned that this
would mean that we would take away some of
the useful opportunities that they have for intel
lectual exploration outside their traditional dis
ciplines."
However, Berman said that offering too
many electives leads to students taking more
time than necessary to complete a Ph.D. That is
why he recommends a more coordinated first
year curriculum that can set students on track
much sooner.
While the discussion of redesigning the
humanities doctoral program continues to be a
national debate, Sailer said that at Stanford, the
revision process of the departmental proposals
will be strict since there are risks to being one of
the only universities enacting such a change.
"We'd like to be leaders but we don't want
to be foolhardy," Sailer said.
The first round of proposals is being
accepted by Feb. 1, 2013, and will apply to
students entering in the 2013-14 academic
year. A second round of proposals will be
accepted by Sept. 1, 2013, for the following
school year.
