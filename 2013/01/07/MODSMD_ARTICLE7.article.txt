## Medicine dean assumes post 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD KURT CHIRBAS 
Lloyd Minor, the former provost of Johns
Hopkins University, officially assumed his
new position as dean of the Stanford School
of Medicine on Saturday, Dec. 1. Minor suc
ceeds Philip Pizzo, who stepped down from
the post he had held since April 2001.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
announced Minor's selection as the new
School of Medicine dean in July following a
nationwide search led by Sam Gambhir, chair
of the Radiology Department.
"His ability to build consensus and bridge
strengths across the entire medical school,
Stanford Hospital & Clinics, Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital, the Palo Alto VA and the
University will be key for the future excel
lence of our medical school," Gambhir said in
a press release at the time.
Minor left his post as provost of Johns
Hopkins University at the beginning of
September in order to begin his appointment
at the Stanford School of Medicine. During
his three-year term as provost, Minor over
saw the university's nine schools as well as its
institutes, interdisciplinary program and aca
demic centers.
He previously served as chair of the
Department of Otolaryngology-Head and
Neck Surgery and otolaryngologist-in-chief
at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. There, col
leagues credited him with expanding annual
research funding by more than 50 percent
and clinical activity by more than 30 percent.
This fall, Minor worked closely with Pizzo
in order to ensure a smooth transition.
Pizzo wrote his last newsletter as dean of the
School of Medicine on Nov. 19, where he
reflected on his tenure as dean and thanked

the Stanford community.
"Of course the journey has had its
debates, its ups and downs, its champions and
detractors, its leaders and followers," Pizzo
said. "While I recognize that I have some
times been a lightening rod for change, I
have always tried to put the future of
Stanford Medicine first and foremost."
He also discussed "Translating
Discoveries," a document developed by the
School of Medicine during the first two years
of Pizzo's term as dean that would become its
strategic master plan for the next decade.
The Stanford School of Medicine recently
published a list of Pizzo's top accomplish
ments, which included establishing a new
curriculum for medical students, expanding
the benefits available to postdoctoral schol
ars, creating five Stanford Institutes of
Medicine and launching the Bioengineering
Department in conjunction with the School of
Engineering, making it the first University
department operated by two schools.
According to a recent Stanford Medicine
article, Pizzo began a 12 to 18-month sabbati
cal on Dec. 1. He will remain a professor of
pediatrics, microbiology and immunology at
Stanford. He expressed his faith in Minor's
ability to lead the School of Medicine to more
improvements.
"We are not anywhere where I think we
need to be, either in terms of our ability in
what we are teaching our students, how we are
practicing medicine, or the sense of compas
sion that patients feel when they are undergo
ing care," Pizzo said. "The future is bright and
exciting, but these are all works in progress."
