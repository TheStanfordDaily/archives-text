## Trustees discuss new institute 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
At its December meeting,
the Stanford Board of
Trustees discussed the possi
bility of forming a neuro
science institute on campus.
The university-wide initia
tive would connect faculty
across the University from
various disciplines in a struc
ture similar to the Woods
Institute for the
Environment.

"There are many, many
faculty that are dealing with
issues in and around the
brain around the campus,"
said Steven Denning, chair of
the Board of Trustees.
"Neurology, psychology, biol
ogy, chemistry, economics,
the business school, neuroe
conomics... it's a very wide
range."
Denning noted that the
neuroscience initiative is in
its initial stages and could
lead to an institute on cam
pus.
"They estimate that there
are about 400 faculty work
ing across the university
working to unlock the secrets
of the brain," Denning said.
"We think that it's quite
appropriate to have a focal
point for that initiative and
that effort."
In addition to discussing
the neuroscience initiative,

the Board also talked about
the arts at Stanford, hearing
speeches from Stephen
Hinton, director of the
Stanford Arts Institute;
Connie Wolf, the director of
the Cantor Center for the
Visual Arts, and Wiley
Hausum, the executive direc
tor of Stanford Live and
Bing Concert Hall. The
opening of the Bing Concert
Hall was a focus of the meet
ing, as was the construction
of the Anderson Collection
and the McMurtry Building.
The Board of Trustees
also approved a $l.l million
increase in the budget for the
renovation of Florence
Moore Hall in order to cover
the increased costs for the
kitchen and servery. The
project will now cost $14.25

million.
A dinner was held at the
Hoover House on Dec. 10 to
honor the last meeting of
Wendy Munger, a long-time
Trustee of the Board. After
first being elected to the
Board of Trustees in 2003,
Munger has served as the
chair for the Academic Policy,
Planning and Management
Committee for seven years.
"She's been an ardent and
vocal supporter of the Arts
Initiative in a very demon
strable way," Denning said.
"I think it was fitting that in
her last meeting, we also had
a comprehensive composite
view of what was going on
overall."
