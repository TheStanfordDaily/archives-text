## ASSU pilot program to bring nighttime food trucks to campus 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
The ASSU Executive will bring food
tracks onto campus starting this Friday as
part of a winter quarter pilot program that
aims to diversify late-night dining options.
The food tracks, a pillar of the Executive's
platform, will be serving food every Friday
and Saturday night during winter quarter.
The program will be ran through Off the
Grid, a food track management company
that works with over 100 vendors to organ
ize and bring food trucks to locations across
the Bay Area. Food tracks will be open from
10 p.m. to 1 a.m. in two locations: Wilbur
parking lot and the parking lot between
Florence Moore Hall and Theta Delta Chi.
To navigate the legal and health obsta
cles to having outside groups serve food on
campus, ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 and Vice President William Wagstaff 'l2
worked with the University throughout the
summer and fall. Administrators had been
working on a mobile food vendor policy at
the same time.

As of Jan. 1,2013, the University enact
ed a mobile food vendor policy that sets
guidelines for any food trucks on the
Stanford campus. The food truck policy sets
guidelines that cover everything from park
ing to sustainability.
"One of the primary concerns is making
sure that everyone is properly licensed and
permitted to operate in Santa Clara
County," Zimbroff said. "That's one of the
big advantages of what Off the Grid does.
They will not send a vendor who does not
have the proper clearances to meet county
standards, and, additionally, to meet
Stanford standards."
Although the food trucks will not accept
meal plan dollars, they will only be available
to Stanford students, according to Zimbroff.
"The University is pretty concerned
about it being just a Stanford program, and
that's who we're tailoring it for," Zimbroff
said.
According to Zimbroff, the food truck
program was preceded by a
lack of late-night options in
Palo Alto.
"Why not have someone
who's mobile and easy to get
to come to us when every
thing in Palo Alto closes at 10
p.m. on the weekends and the
only thing that will deliver
past that time is Domino's?"
he said. "Hopefully it solves
some of those problems of
having more variety and
more options and being really
convenient for kids."
However, the program
remains a pilot for the quar
ter because of concerns about
whether there will be enough
student interest to keep food
vendors on campus.
"They need about 80 to
100 kids to go to each food
truck each [night] in order for
it to be financially viable for
them to continue," Zimbroff
said.
