Knife Fight: Special Advanced Film Screening
with Bill Guttentag
KNIFE «l
Join us for a special pre-release film screening of Knife Fight with filmmaker Bill Guttentag.
Knife Fight is a smart, crackling, comedic "inside look" at what happens behind closed doors
in modern American politics. Two-time Academy Award-winning director Bill Guttentag teamed
with renowned political consultant Chris Lehane to create this political story for the new
century. Knife Fight pulls back the curtain on the "real truth" of the political process.
The film screening will be followed by a panel which will be moderated by former New York
Times editor Philip Taubman and will include Tucker Bounds, Bill Guttentag and Chris Lehane.
Wednesday, January 9 • 7:30 pm • CEMEX Auditorium
Knight Management Center • Stanford University
Free and open to the public
