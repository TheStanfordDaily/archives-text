## Card struggles at Duals Baumbach a bright spot for Stanford 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a difficult weekend for
the Stanford wrestling team,
which fell to Arizona State (30-
7), Penn (27-6) and Rutgers (33-
3) on Sunday at the Stanford
Duals in Burnham Pavilion. The
Cardinal dropped to 4-6 overall
and 0-1 in the Pac-12. ASU now
stands at 6-4 overall and 2-0 in
the Pac-12, while Penn improved
to 4-1 and Rutgers is 10-1 on the
year.
The Cardinal dropped eight
of 10 bouts to ASU, but Bret
Baumbach's performance
against the Sun Devils was a
rare bright spot on the after
noon. The redshirt junior scored
Stanford's first points of the
dual with an 11-3 major decision
over Hans Rasmusson at 165
pounds. Baumbach led 6-1 after
the first period as he scored two
takedowns and registered two
back points.
Rasmusson chose down to
start the second and Baumbach
capitalized with two more near
fall points. He chose down to
start the third and recorded the
escape. After Rasmusson scored
a takedown, Baumbach tallied
another escape and tacked on
his final point with 3:09 in riding
time.
Stanford got back on the
board in the final bout against
the Sun Devils, when redshirt
freshman Evan Silver picked up
a 3-1 decision over Dalton Miller
at 125 pounds. A takedown in
the first period for Silver proved
to be the difference-maker.
All in all, Stanford was
outscored 74-21, with the Sun
Devils earning three major deci
sions.
Against Penn, Baumbach
was again one of just two
Cardinal wrestlers to earn a
win. He posted an 8-4 decision
over Brad Wukie at 165 pounds.
Trailing 4-3 after the first peri
od, Baumbach tallied a take
down in the second to capture
the lead. He finished off Wukie
in the third with an escape and
another takedown.
Junior heavyweight Dan
Scherer also scored points for
Stanford against Penn. He
recorded a 3-1 sudden victory
decision over Steven Graziano.
Each wrestler scored an escape
to force the extra time, where
Scherer capitalized with a take
down.
Silver registered the lone
win for the Cardinal against
Rutgers. The 125-pounder
trailed 4-3 after two periods. He
chose down to start the third and
scored an escape to force overtime.
There, Silver recorded a takedown
against Joseph Langel 111 for the
sudden victory decision (6-4).

Also against the Scarlet
Knights, true freshman Dylan
Morris put up a good fight against
lOth-ranked Greg Zannetti at 174
pounds. Morris came up just short
in the final period, falling 7-5.
In the other duals of the day,
Rutgers defeated Arizona State,
21-12, and Penn topped the Sun
Devils, 27-10.
Stanford hits the road next

week, travelling to the East Coast
for four duals. The Cardinal will
take on Brown, Maryland and
Harvard on Saturday, Jan. 12 in
College Park, Md. Stanford will
wrap up the weekend at American
University in Washington, D.C. on
Sunday, Jan. 13.
