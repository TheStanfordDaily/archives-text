# OPINIONS
## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD A 						resolution to turn down the intensity 
### 
Overheard at Tresidder: "Life
is just a series of fuck-ups
because we're all so bad at
it." A sad summary of the prevail
ing Stanford attitude toward mess
ing up. Life is a game that you can
be good or bad at, and if you are
bad at it you lose. Forget happy
accidents. Goodbye room for error.
There never were no wrong
answers.
I noticed my own stringency
with mistakes over winter break. It
was Christmas Eve and I was bak
ing chocolate-chip cookies with my
dad for Santa. I made a stupid mis
take and doubled the flour in the
recipe. (So stupid already the
judgment creeping in.) It was
awful; the dough looked like edible
clay. I was so frustrated I had to
leave the kitchen and fume in my
bedroom until the cookies finished
baking, abandoning my dad and
Santa because I couldn't roll with
the punches.
The cookies turned out fine
more like miniature cakes than
cookies but that's not the point.
The point is that I don't think we
practice messing up often enough
at school. To get into this place, you
can't afford to practice a whole lot
of messing up. And so you achieve,
accomplish and are accepted. You
work so hard to hear someone say
"yes" but you never work the edge
that hears "no" and remains intact.
You work so hard to memorize the
recipe, but you forget to work the
muscle that kicks in when you add
too much flour. So when you mess
up, you shatter. You cast aspersions
and deem yourself "bad" [l]at cook
ing, "bad" at math, "bad" at life.
You over-develop one muscle at the
expense of another, and forget to
integrate the whole system.
This nearsightedness misses the

messiness of achievement. You may
have goals, but they are not framed
by goal-posts. If anything, mine are
frustratingly ill-defined, as variable
as a mirage in an undergraduate
Sahara. Today I want to go to law
school; yesterday I wanted to be a
ballerina. Who knows what the
Holy Grail will look like tomorrow?
So why sweat a mistake en route
when the straight and narrow is
actually quite vast and circuitous?
A win toward a certain end
strengthens either the ballerina or
the lawyer, but is of little use when
the mirage of success dissolves and
takes a new shape. A loss however,
along any path, strengthens the
mysterious muscle that serves both
ballerina and lawyer. Call it
resilience. Call it adaptability.
Whatever it is, suffering a loss
makes you versatile, humble and
most importantly, flexible.
I was in a yoga class recently
sweating through chair pose gri
macing, but feeling the burn. The
teacher caught me unawares.
"Work your edge," she told the
class. "Maybe today that means sit
ting lower, and maybe today that
means backing off." I was surprised
that backing off could be an edge to
work, that softness and compassion
could take just as much effort as
hardness and aggression. I sat
lower, naturally, because I was feel
ing petty and competitive, and
because I'm a Stanford student. I
have a new edge to work, one that
requires falling down and getting
back up and taking myself with a
grain of salt. I invite you to work it
with me. Here's to not taking our
selves too seriously this year.
