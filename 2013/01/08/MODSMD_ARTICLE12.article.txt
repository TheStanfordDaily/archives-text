# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## I Am a Virgin 
### 
I am a virgin. It feels good to
finally say it. Not only am I a
virgin, but I've never had a girl
friend and my first kiss was at Full
Moon on the Quad.
I have also lied about being a vir
gin for much of my post-pubescent
life.
Lying is wrong and rarely justi
fiable. I've lied about my virginity to
close friends, acquaintances and
complete strangers. It was wrong of
me and I apologize. I could continue
to self-flagellate but rest assured
that lying puts me through a partic
ular mental anguish all on its own.
What you must understand is
that my entire pre-Stanford sexual
education came from octogenarian
nuns and the creators of "South
Park." I never got a birds-and-the
bees talk from my parents. Instead,
I was given a pamphlet in the fourth
grade that only confused the entire
process for me. The sex ed class in
my high school told us about STDs,
but never covered biology, mechan
ics, orientations or consent. We
received a healthy fear of God and
T-shirts extolling the virtues of
abstinence. From that confusion
only one message got through to
me: I want to wait for a girl with
whom I'm madly in love and have
been dating for some time. The for
mer has happened, but not the lat
ter. Please note that I do not heap
scorn on people whose proclivities
or predilections differ from mine. I
do, as we all should, respect every
expression of sexuality within the
confines of consent.
Still, it should also be noted that
I'm not a virgin due to lack of oppor
tunity. As unbelievable as it sounds,
I was the object of a few crushes in
high school. I've also been to parties
and have imbibed my fair share of
spirits. I have even blatantly shut
down another person's attempt at
romantic intimacy and left the
room. Suffice to say, mine is a voli
tional virginity.
The problem is that a tall, athlet
ic, talented, blue-eyed, white, het
erosexual male isn't supposed to be
a long-term virgin. And if he is, he
should resent it. Like many of my
friends and peers I was supposed to
punch that card in high school, at
the first opportunity. That is the
heterosexual male culture that I,
and many others, inhabit. Girls are
often ostracized for having too
much sex, while boys are often
harassed for having too little. That
is what I grew up seeing. That
harassment is what I lied to avoid.
As I said before, I take full
responsibility for my dishonesty.

But sometimes the temptation for
social acceptance is overwhelming.
I'm not simply mad at myself for
lying, but I'm mad that I felt com
pelled to lie. I let some boy's drunk
en boasts about sexual exploits
affect how I want to live my life. I
let a roommate's claim that he's had
the most sex of anyone in the dorm
lead me to fabricate a history. I let
some little imp compel me to dis
honesty with jokes about my orien
tation, penis size, suavity, etc. There
is nothing wrong with jokes so long
as we subsequently validate a per
son's perfectly valid stances. To be
the butt of a joke and have no one
say "I accept you" is truly jading.
That's where closets come from.
It's not just the fire-and-brimstone
evangelical who oppresses the
LGBTQ community: It's the taxing
day-to-day invalidation by a society
that vociferously accepts the "nor
mal" while tacitly condemning the
rest. The different standards we
have for different groups ultimately
leads to stigma.
We should strive to watch our
words and actions, recognizing how
they affect people. I'm as guilty and
foul-mouthed as anyone, but I've
been nothing but open and accept
ing in my caring for other people.
Listening to other people's lives has
become such a joy for me, because I
can learn their stories and become
more understanding. We should
strive for a society that validates all
benign behaviors by actively
accepting those different from us.
Let's create a culture that promotes
open acceptance as the norm.
So to those I've lied to, I am
sorry that I made such a bad deci
sion. But it serves as a good lesson.
Our actions, however small, can
have lasting and adverse effects on
people. Therefore, we should strive
to know, comfort and accept those
around us.
