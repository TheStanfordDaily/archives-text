## Stanford women's gymnastics takes season opener 
### – Miles Bennett-Smith 
Led by a superb effort on the
vault by senior captain Nicole
Dayton, the No. 6 women's gymnas
tics team opened the season with a
win at the NorCal Quad Meet host
ed by San Jose State.
The Cardinal topped the team
competition that included San Jose
State, UC-Davis and Sacramento
State with a total score of 195.425.
Stanford had at least two gymnasts
place in the top three places of each
individual event and earned the top
team score in every event.
Dayton in particular shone,
tying a career best with a meet-best
9.950 on the vault. She wasn't the
only team member to find success
in the event —all five gymnasts for
Stanford earned a 9.775 or higher.

First-team Ail-Americans Amanda
Spinner, a junior, and Ivana Hong, a
sophomore, led the way on balance
beam, each scoring 9.875 in the
event as Stanford once again was
dominant.

Senior captain and AIl-American
Ashley Morgan was the top scorer
on the uneven bars with a 9.800, and
was also the third-highest scorer on
the beam and vault.
Stanford will take to the floor
next on Saturday, Jan. 12 in Tucson,

Ariz, for another quad meet.
