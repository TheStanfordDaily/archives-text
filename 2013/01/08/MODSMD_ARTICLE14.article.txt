Alabama cruised past an over
matched Notre Dame squad 42-14
to win the BCS National
Championship, then wrapped up its
ninth Associated Press champi
onship on Monday night with all 59
first-place votes. Stanford (12-2) fin
ished seventh in the final AP poll and
sixth in the final coaches' poll
In the second-to-last year before
a national playoff system will be used
to determine the national champion,
Alabama avoided most of the poten
tial controversy by pushing Notre
Dame (which came into the night
ranked No. 1 in the BCS) all over the
field at the Orange Bowl.
The Fighting Irish dropped to
No. 4 in the final AP rankings,
which had Oregon (12-1) second and
undefeated Ohio State (12-0) third
despite being banned from the post
season because of NCAA sanctions.
The SEC once again led the way
with six teams in the final ranking,
while the Pac-12 finished with three
teams in the Top-25.
Four of Stanford's 2012 oppo
nents were ranked: Oregon, Notre
Dame, No. 20 Oregon State and No.
21 San Jose State.

It was tough sledding for the Stanford men's wrestling team on Sunday, as the Card fell to Rutgers, Arizona
State and Penn. Redshirt junior Bret Baumbach (above), however, earned two victories at 165 pounds.
