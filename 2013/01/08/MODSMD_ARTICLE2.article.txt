# Feds investigate Searsville Dam
## NOAA launches probe into possible Stanford violation of Endangered Species Act 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) has confirmed that
Stanford University is under federal investiga
tion for potential criminal violation of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) in its opera
tion of Searsville Dam. Investigators are prob
ing University activities for the potential

threat to steelhead trout, classified as an
endangered species by NOAA.
According to Jim Milbury, a National
Marine Fisheries Service public affairs repre
sentative, the investigation surrounds the
question of whether the University is responsi
ble for steelhead trout "take," which according
to the ESA means, "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or col
lect [an NOAA listed animal] or attempt to
engage in any such conduct." In the past, this
has covered a broad range of violations includ
ing blocking migratory passages and alteringv
water supply.
No Stanford affiliate interviewed would
comment on how the investigation would affect
current operations at Jasper Ridge or at the

University in general.
Operated by the University since 1919, the
65-foot-tall Searsville Dam was built in 1892
for water storage. The dam blocks steelhead
trout from migrating to their historical habitat,
and has spurred sedimentation that has
reduced Searsville Lake to under 10 percent of
its former capacity. According to a 2011
University press release, Stanford still uses
the reservoir for one million gallons in non
potable water supply every day, including for
irrigation and landscaping.
The University maintains that the dam is
necessary for flood control, water supply
needs and protection of a new habitat that has
sprung up after the dam's construction.
However, the dam's opponents argue that, in

addition to controversial maintenance, the
dam is unsafe. Stanford has not completed the
thorough inspection recommended by the
California Division of Safety of Dams in 2007.
Dam-removal advocates also maintain the
Searsville Dam is illegal because it violates the
Endangered Species Act.
"It appears to us that Stanford intentional
ly did not tell the federal government about
certain activities and construction they under
took because there were obvious connections
to ESA issues," said Matt Stoeker, a restora
tion ecologist and founder of Beyond Searsville
Dam, a nonprofit organization advocating for
the destruction of Searsville Dam.
In 2008, Stanford's Board of Trustees
introduced their Habitat Conservation Plan
(HCP) as part of an application for a 50-year
Incidental Take Permit for four endangered
species. If granted, the permit would allow
the University to continue its normal activi
ties and operations despite incidental harm to
the covered animals.
Searsville Dam was excluded from the
report pending an Alternative Study, for
which Stanford chartered a steering commit
tee composed of five faculty members.
On Dec. 6, 2012, Catherine Palter, associ
ate director of land use and environmental
planning, wrote a letter to NOAA on behalf of
the University suspending Stanford's applica
tion for the Incidental Take Permit for activi
ties in the San Francisquito Creek Basin,
where the dam is located, until the Alternative
Study was completed.
However, Jasper Ridge Director and
Steering Committee Co-chair Chris Field said
that the committee has always had more long
term and big-picture goals for managing the
watershed.
"In general, the Searsville steering com
mittee wasn't put together to manage... the
[dam's] near-term issues," he said.
Both Milbury and Field said that they
were not sure what prompted law enforce

ment to open the investigation.
"There is no question in my mind that they
are causing take of steelhead and other
species," Stoeker said. "The feds don't open a
case [or] investigation into ESA violations
unless they're pretty confident that they're
going to find something."
Stoeker also argued that Stanford was also
under investigation for lacking the proper
regulatory permits to operate the dam. He
questioned whether Stanford properly noti
fied the California Department of Fish and
Game when it installed new booster pumps in
the Searsville Diversion facility around 2008
despite a law requiring an entity to submit
notice when it "substantially divert[s] or
obstruct the natural flow 0f... any river,
stream or lake."
"[The investigation] is going to make
Stanford realize that they can't keep doing
what they've been doing," Stoecker said.
"They're going to have to make serious modi
fications to the dam or remove the dam to get
into compliance with the [ESA]."
According to Milbury, "whoever operates
the Searsville Dam" may face criminal
charges if investigators find evidence of
endangered species take.
"Under Section 9 of the ESA, there are
penalties for taking endangered species," he
explained. "In this case there are criminal vio
lations: no more than $50,000 per count, or
imprisonment for not more than one year."

Searsville Dam was excluded from the
report pending an Alternative Study, for
which Stanford chartered a steering commit
tee composed of five faculty members.
On Dec. 6, 2012, Catherine Palter, associ
ate director of land use and environmental
planning, wrote a letter to NOAA on behalf of
the University suspending Stanford's applica
tion for the Incidental Take Permit for activi
ties in the San Francisquito Creek Basin,
where the dam is located, until the Alternative
Study was completed.
However, Jasper Ridge Director and
Steering Committee Co-chair Chris Field said
that the committee has always had more long
term and big-picture goals for managing the
watershed.
"In general, the Searsville steering com
mittee wasn't put together to manage... the
[dam's] near-term issues," he said.
Both Milbury and Field said that they
were not sure what prompted law enforce

ment to open the investigation.
"There is no question in my mind that they
are causing take of steelhead and other
species," Stoeker said. "The feds don't open a
case [or] investigation into ESA violations
unless they're pretty confident that they're
going to find something."
Stoeker also argued that Stanford was also
under investigation for lacking the proper
regulatory permits to operate the dam. He
questioned whether Stanford properly noti
fied the California Department of Fish and
Game when it installed new booster pumps in
the Searsville Diversion facility around 2008
despite a law requiring an entity to submit
notice when it "substantially divert[s] or
obstruct the natural flow 0f... any river,
stream or lake."
"[The investigation] is going to make
Stanford realize that they can't keep doing
what they've been doing," Stoecker said.
"They're going to have to make serious modi
fications to the dam or remove the dam to get
into compliance with the [ESA]."
According to Milbury, "whoever operates
the Searsville Dam" may face criminal
charges if investigators find evidence of
endangered species take.
"Under Section 9 of the ESA, there are
penalties for taking endangered species," he
explained. "In this case there are criminal vio
lations: no more than $50,000 per count, or
imprisonment for not more than one year."
