# Feds investigate Searsville Dam
## NOAA launches probe into possible Stanford violation of Endangered Species Act 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) has confirmed that
Stanford University is under federal investiga
tion for potential criminal violation of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) in its opera
tion of Searsville Dam. Investigators are prob
ing University activities for the potential

threat to steelhead trout, classified as an
endangered species by NOAA.
According to Jim Milbury, a National
Marine Fisheries Service public affairs repre
sentative, the investigation surrounds the
question of whether the University is responsi
ble for steelhead trout "take," which according
to the ESA means, "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or col
lect [an NOAA listed animal] or attempt to
engage in any such conduct." In the past, this
has covered a broad range of violations includ
ing blocking migratory passages and alteringv
water supply.
No Stanford affiliate interviewed would
comment on how the investigation would affect
current operations at Jasper Ridge or at the

University in general.
Operated by the University since 1919, the
65-foot-tall Searsville Dam was built in 1892
for water storage. The dam blocks steelhead
trout from migrating to their historical habitat,
and has spurred sedimentation that has
reduced Searsville Lake to under 10 percent of
its former capacity. According to a 2011
University press release, Stanford still uses
the reservoir for one million gallons in non
potable water supply every day, including for
irrigation and landscaping.
The University maintains that the dam is
necessary for flood control, water supply
needs and protection of a new habitat that has
sprung up after the dam's construction.
However, the dam's opponents argue that, in

addition to controversial maintenance, the
dam is unsafe. Stanford has not completed the
thorough inspection recommended by the
California Division of Safety of Dams in 2007.
Dam-removal advocates also maintain the
Searsville Dam is illegal because it violates the
Endangered Species Act.
"It appears to us that Stanford intentional
ly did not tell the federal government about
certain activities and construction they under
took because there were obvious connections
to ESA issues," said Matt Stoeker, a restora
tion ecologist and founder of Beyond Searsville
Dam, a nonprofit organization advocating for
the destruction of Searsville Dam.
