## Club sports funding restructured ASSU effort aims to provide full need-based funding 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
The ASSU has made plans to
provide more funding for club
sports teams, according to ASSU
President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2.
The extra funding, which is in addi
tion to money collected from team
dues, fundraising revenue and
Club Sports Council funding, will
be put in place early this quarter.
The ASSU will work with the
Department of Athletics and Pam
Mahlow, director of club sports, on
the funding project, with the
money coming from the ASSU
Executive and Student Affairs.
Zimbroff expects the groups
will be able to provide $7,000 in
funding to begin with, but the final
amount has not yet been deter
mined. Club sports will use the
funding to cover dues and fees for
students with financial need and to
fund competitions.
"We are planning on having
yearly funding for this _ we're not
just going to hand clubs money and
leave it at that," Zimbroff said.
Zimbroff said that the new
funding will help make up for
budget cuts made in response to
the recession, with the goal of pro
viding full need-based funding.
"Our thought is that money
should never restrict students
from participating in sports on
campus, especially when some stu
dents choose Stanford over athlet
ic scholarships offers because of
the academic opportunities," he
said.
Club sports teams are split into
two categories _23 teams that
receive funding from the Club
Sports Council, which can be sup
plemented by team dues and
fundraising, and seven ASSU ath
letic club teams, which are only
funded by team dues and fundrais
ing. All told, more than 1,100 stu
dents play club sports at Stanford,
including sports that are not part
of the varsity sports program such
as archery, badminton and squash.
Club Sports Council funding is
allocated to teams on a petition
basis following at least three years
of team stability and a probation
ary year. Teams qualify if expenses
are in the following categories:
honoraria (which include salaries
for coaches and referees and team
gifts), equipment, maintenance,
uniforms, facility rental, travel
fares, accommodations and regis
tration fees. Funding per team
member depends on the expenses
of each team and how much income
teams have from dues and
fundraising.
"Among other things, club
sports is an opportunity for kids
who want to stay competitive in the
sports they love," Zimbroff said.
"So making students choose
between high-caliber athletics and
academics if finances are an issue is
a tough pill to swallow."
