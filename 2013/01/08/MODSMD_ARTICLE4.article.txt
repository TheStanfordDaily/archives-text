## Khan discusses the future of education 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
This is the first of two articles about
Salman Khan's educational vision. This
article will highlight the challenges that
face higher education; the second is avail
able online at wwiv.stanforddaily.com

In a modest, unassuming office in Mountain
View, Calif., a small group of Khan Academy
employees recently celebrated the online educa
tion platform's 200-millionth lesson. The work
spaces are simple, cluttered even, and in them, a
small group of designers, computer scientists
and developers are reinventing education. At
the forefront is Salman Khan.

Khan, affectionately known as Sal, is some
what of a cult celebrity among those who active
ly use Khan Academy. Its users include educa
tors desiring to push the limits of contemporary
pedagogy as well as those who simply find the
clarity and ease of the platform's online lectures
refreshing and even entertaining.
His rise to prominence in online education
was serendipitous. Teaching his niece over a
webcam, Khan began uploading his tutoring ses
sions to YouThbe. His videos eventually caught
the attention of millions, so he quit his day job as
a hedge fund analyst and founded Khan
Academy.
That was 2009. Now, Khan is eyeing a funda
mental rethinking of K-12 education, as outlined
in his now-famous TED talk, media appear
ances, and, most recently, through his new book,
"The One World Schoolhouse." However, Khan
also has higher education in his sights, and is
animated when our discussion of the topic
begins.
Education's Prussian Problem
"The Prussian model, as the name implies,
comes from 18th- and 19th-century Prussia,"
Khan said. But what is not obvious is how this
pedagogic model came to become the world's
dominant educational vehicle.
"They asked themselves, 'How can we have
mass education?' a very egalitarian idea,"
Khan said. "It was the early stage of the indus
trial revolution, so they asked themselves, 'How
do we create mass anything?"'
"Well, we set up an assembly line and have
products go through at a set pace through dif
ferent stations and we sift the product out at the
end," he said.
"Let's apply that idea to students," Khan
said, describing the Prussians' thinking. The
Prussian mode of teaching became so prevalent
that reflecting on it can be difficult, Khan said.
"We've all grown up in this model, and so it's
hard for us to imagine that this is so constructed
or unnatural... Everyone has the Prussian
model now. It's even at the university level."
Learners are compartmentalized by less
