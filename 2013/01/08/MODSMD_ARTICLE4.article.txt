## Khan discusses the future of education 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
This is the first of two articles about
Salman Khan's educational vision. This
article will highlight the challenges that
face higher education; the second is avail
able online at wwiv.stanforddaily.com

In a modest, unassuming office in Mountain
View, Calif., a small group of Khan Academy
employees recently celebrated the online educa
tion platform's 200-millionth lesson. The work
spaces are simple, cluttered even, and in them, a
small group of designers, computer scientists
and developers are reinventing education. At
the forefront is Salman Khan.

Khan, affectionately known as Sal, is some
what of a cult celebrity among those who active
ly use Khan Academy. Its users include educa
tors desiring to push the limits of contemporary
pedagogy as well as those who simply find the
clarity and ease of the platform's online lectures
refreshing and even entertaining.
His rise to prominence in online education
was serendipitous. Teaching his niece over a
webcam, Khan began uploading his tutoring ses
sions to YouThbe. His videos eventually caught
the attention of millions, so he quit his day job as
a hedge fund analyst and founded Khan
Academy.
That was 2009. Now, Khan is eyeing a funda
mental rethinking of K-12 education, as outlined
in his now-famous TED talk, media appear
ances, and, most recently, through his new book,
"The One World Schoolhouse." However, Khan
also has higher education in his sights, and is
animated when our discussion of the topic
begins.
Education's Prussian Problem
"The Prussian model, as the name implies,
comes from 18th- and 19th-century Prussia,"
Khan said. But what is not obvious is how this
pedagogic model came to become the world's
dominant educational vehicle.
"They asked themselves, 'How can we have
mass education?' a very egalitarian idea,"
Khan said. "It was the early stage of the indus
trial revolution, so they asked themselves, 'How
do we create mass anything?"'
"Well, we set up an assembly line and have
products go through at a set pace through dif
ferent stations and we sift the product out at the
end," he said.
"Let's apply that idea to students," Khan
said, describing the Prussians' thinking. The
Prussian mode of teaching became so prevalent
that reflecting on it can be difficult, Khan said.
"We've all grown up in this model, and so it's
hard for us to imagine that this is so constructed
or unnatural... Everyone has the Prussian
model now. It's even at the university level."
Learners are compartmentalized by less

than-sensible criteria, Khan explained. He
argued that this has led to various structural
learning disadvantages among students.
Learners are batched together by age,
sent to classes for an equal duration of time
where their curriculums are rigidly set, Khan
explained. They are all taught the material at
the same pace, and "knowledge is sprayed on
the student usually in the form of a lecture."
"It does hurt learning, for the same rea
son it hurts learning in K-12," Khan said.
"The Prussian model ensures that you will
have gaps in your knowledge."
"We've all experienced getting to a senior
math class and [thinking], 'Well, I should
have paid more attention to [previous] class
es ... Because this model is based on everyone
moving at the same pace on an assembly line,
you have no way to fix those gaps."
The existence and übiquity of this way of
learning was perhaps necessary at the time it
was created, but now technology provides us
with ways to upend this traditional model
with something that may be far more efficient
and far more productive for learners, Khan
said.
However, the dominance of the estab
lished system has left it prone to inertia and
lethargy, which, according to Khan, prevents
learners from fully engaging with them edu
cational experience.
Teachers Teach. Do Students Learn?
"Let's imagine a world without computers
and imagine a typical classroom, K-12. You've
got 30 kids in a room, most of the time they're
relatively passive and a lecture is being
applied to them.
"It's a passive lecture, and at the universi
ty level, it will often go to 300 people in a
classroom," Khan said. "That is fundamental
ly a dehumanizing process, to be in a room
with N other human beings and not interact
with them. Your human instinct is to talk to
them, to ask questions, for others to ask you
questions, to laugh, to joke, to interact."
The manner in which we are taught is
very different, argued Khan, from how
human beings actually learn.
"We're at the early stages of our own
research. I think that the general narrative is
that people learn when it's active and when
it's at their own pace... as opposed to passive,
and at somebody else's pace," he said. "And
this is not how it aligns at most universities,
especially the large-scale freshman calculus,
the typical college course."
This misalignment inhibits a learner's
potential. And, as Khan explained, the prob
lem is self-reinforcing because of grades and
credentials that are not particularly useful or
meaningful.
"Then students are graded, literally like
eggs, where you're an A' egg or a 'B' egg or a
'C' egg, and even though you've identified a
weakness that probably be improved upon,
it's viewed as more of an inherent flaw in you
and you're put on the next stage of the
process."
What does Goldman Sachs want?
"Go ask the bottom 50 percent of income
strata, 'Why are you going to college?'
They're going to be pretty clear ... It's about
them being able to be productive and being
able to support themselves and them fami
lies," Khan said.
Khan argues that the importance of future
employment is so large and potentially so
motivating that it skews a number of college
decisions.
"There's been this weird discomfort about
this, but the reality is a lot of the reason a kid
shows up at Stanford or Harvard is ... to work
for Goldman Sachs," he said.
Students hold instrumental notions about
them educations, such as: "Goldman Sachs
only recruits at eight universities, even

though I've gotten a full ride at university
nine, I care about what Goldman Sachs
thinks, I care about what McKinsey thinks, I
care about what Google thinks."
He calls this a "market failure" in learn
ing.
"There's a market failure going 0n... And
the signaling system has broken down,"
Khan said, arguing that skills and opportuni
ties are not being matched because of arbi
trary job requirements that do not take into
consideration the relevant part of a candi
dates' knowledge base.
He also maintains that college diplomas
do not carry the right information for
employers to make informed decisions about

potential jobs candidates.
"There are students at Stanford who are
off the charts on one dimension that Google
would really value, but they bombed a course
in another dimension and because of that
they don't make the resume screening,"
Khan said.
Khan says a possible solution could be a
closer partnership with the private sector
and the establishment of specific micro-cre
dentials that would increase the information
between students and employers, and would
level the playing field for students not from
brand-name universities.

Future thoughts
"At MIT, at Harvard, it was, just to kind of
show up and be surrounded by people who
were just really impressive people, you're
surrounded by faculty who have done things
you didn't think human beings could do, you
meet alumni that are stalling businesses and
leading things," he said, remembering his
time at the two universities from which he
earned a cumulative four degrees.
"I learned from my peers and I learned
from doing projects and I learned from men
tors, but I learned very little from lectures,
and I've talked about how little I attended
them."
Khan appears to understand how tremen
dous the value of an education is and yet is
motivated to eliminate what he perceives as
its most egregious inefficiencies.
And the numbers back him up. Time maga
zine's recent higher education spread includ
ed a survey that yielded disheartening
results.
Eighty percent of the general public
believes that "at many colleges, the education
students receive is not worth what they pay
for it." And 83 percent believe that "at many
colleges, there is too much of a disconnect
between the courses offered and student's
career goals."
With student debt standing at $956 billion,
according to Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, the problem is only getting worse.
Khan is committed to new forms of peda
gogy, instruction, different emphases in the
classroom and a fundamental reorganization
of how we learn and what we gain from learn
ing. He and his team are working to make
this vision a reality.

"Let's imagine a world without computers
and imagine a typical classroom, K-12. You've
got 30 kids in a room, most of the time they're
relatively passive and a lecture is being
applied to them.
"It's a passive lecture, and at the universi
ty level, it will often go to 300 people in a
classroom," Khan said. "That is fundamental
ly a dehumanizing process, to be in a room
with N other human beings and not interact
with them. Your human instinct is to talk to
them, to ask questions, for others to ask you
questions, to laugh, to joke, to interact."
The manner in which we are taught is
very different, argued Khan, from how
human beings actually learn.
"We're at the early stages of our own
research. I think that the general narrative is
that people learn when it's active and when
it's at their own pace... as opposed to passive,
and at somebody else's pace," he said. "And
this is not how it aligns at most universities,
especially the large-scale freshman calculus,
the typical college course."
This misalignment inhibits a learner's
potential. And, as Khan explained, the prob
lem is self-reinforcing because of grades and
credentials that are not particularly useful or
meaningful.
"Then students are graded, literally like
eggs, where you're an A' egg or a 'B' egg or a
'C' egg, and even though you've identified a
weakness that probably be improved upon,
it's viewed as more of an inherent flaw in you
and you're put on the next stage of the
process."
What does Goldman Sachs want?
"Go ask the bottom 50 percent of income
strata, 'Why are you going to college?'
They're going to be pretty clear ... It's about
them being able to be productive and being
able to support themselves and them fami
lies," Khan said.
Khan argues that the importance of future
employment is so large and potentially so
motivating that it skews a number of college
decisions.
"There's been this weird discomfort about
this, but the reality is a lot of the reason a kid
shows up at Stanford or Harvard is ... to work
for Goldman Sachs," he said.
Students hold instrumental notions about
them educations, such as: "Goldman Sachs
only recruits at eight universities, even

though I've gotten a full ride at university
nine, I care about what Goldman Sachs
thinks, I care about what McKinsey thinks, I
care about what Google thinks."
He calls this a "market failure" in learn
ing.
"There's a market failure going 0n... And
the signaling system has broken down,"
Khan said, arguing that skills and opportuni
ties are not being matched because of arbi
trary job requirements that do not take into
consideration the relevant part of a candi
dates' knowledge base.
He also maintains that college diplomas
do not carry the right information for
employers to make informed decisions about

potential jobs candidates.
"There are students at Stanford who are
off the charts on one dimension that Google
would really value, but they bombed a course
in another dimension and because of that
they don't make the resume screening,"
Khan said.
Khan says a possible solution could be a
closer partnership with the private sector
and the establishment of specific micro-cre
dentials that would increase the information
between students and employers, and would
level the playing field for students not from
brand-name universities.

Future thoughts
"At MIT, at Harvard, it was, just to kind of
show up and be surrounded by people who
were just really impressive people, you're
surrounded by faculty who have done things
you didn't think human beings could do, you
meet alumni that are stalling businesses and
leading things," he said, remembering his
time at the two universities from which he
earned a cumulative four degrees.
"I learned from my peers and I learned
from doing projects and I learned from men
tors, but I learned very little from lectures,
and I've talked about how little I attended
them."
Khan appears to understand how tremen
dous the value of an education is and yet is
motivated to eliminate what he perceives as
its most egregious inefficiencies.
And the numbers back him up. Time maga
zine's recent higher education spread includ
ed a survey that yielded disheartening
results.
Eighty percent of the general public
believes that "at many colleges, the education
students receive is not worth what they pay
for it." And 83 percent believe that "at many
colleges, there is too much of a disconnect
between the courses offered and student's
career goals."
With student debt standing at $956 billion,
according to Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, the problem is only getting worse.
Khan is committed to new forms of peda
gogy, instruction, different emphases in the
classroom and a fundamental reorganization
of how we learn and what we gain from learn
ing. He and his team are working to make
this vision a reality.

SALMAN KHAN
This is the first of two articles about
Salman Khan's educational vision. This
article will highlight the challenges that
face higher education; the second is avail
able online at wwiv.stanforddaily.com

In a modest, unassuming office in Mountain
View, Calif., a small group of Khan Academy
employees recently celebrated the online educa
tion platform's 200-millionth lesson. The work
spaces are simple, cluttered even, and in them, a
small group of designers, computer scientists
and developers are reinventing education. At
the forefront is Salman Khan.

Khan, affectionately known as Sal, is some
what of a cult celebrity among those who active
ly use Khan Academy. Its users include educa
tors desiring to push the limits of contemporary
pedagogy as well as those who simply find the
clarity and ease of the platform's online lectures
refreshing and even entertaining.
His rise to prominence in online education
was serendipitous. Teaching his niece over a
webcam, Khan began uploading his tutoring ses
sions to YouThbe. His videos eventually caught
the attention of millions, so he quit his day job as
a hedge fund analyst and founded Khan
Academy.
That was 2009. Now, Khan is eyeing a funda
mental rethinking of K-12 education, as outlined
in his now-famous TED talk, media appear
ances, and, most recently, through his new book,
"The One World Schoolhouse." However, Khan
also has higher education in his sights, and is
animated when our discussion of the topic
begins.
Education's Prussian Problem
"The Prussian model, as the name implies,
comes from 18th- and 19th-century Prussia,"
Khan said. But what is not obvious is how this
pedagogic model came to become the world's
dominant educational vehicle.
"They asked themselves, 'How can we have
mass education?' a very egalitarian idea,"
Khan said. "It was the early stage of the indus
trial revolution, so they asked themselves, 'How
do we create mass anything?"'
"Well, we set up an assembly line and have
products go through at a set pace through dif
ferent stations and we sift the product out at the
end," he said.
"Let's apply that idea to students," Khan
said, describing the Prussians' thinking. The
Prussian mode of teaching became so prevalent
that reflecting on it can be difficult, Khan said.
"We've all grown up in this model, and so it's
hard for us to imagine that this is so constructed
or unnatural... Everyone has the Prussian
model now. It's even at the university level."
Learners are compartmentalized by less

than-sensible criteria, Khan explained. He
argued that this has led to various structural
learning disadvantages among students.
Learners are batched together by age,
sent to classes for an equal duration of time
where their curriculums are rigidly set, Khan
explained. They are all taught the material at
the same pace, and "knowledge is sprayed on
the student usually in the form of a lecture."
"It does hurt learning, for the same rea
son it hurts learning in K-12," Khan said.
"The Prussian model ensures that you will
have gaps in your knowledge."
"We've all experienced getting to a senior
math class and [thinking], 'Well, I should
have paid more attention to [previous] class
es ... Because this model is based on everyone
moving at the same pace on an assembly line,
you have no way to fix those gaps."
The existence and übiquity of this way of
learning was perhaps necessary at the time it
was created, but now technology provides us
with ways to upend this traditional model
with something that may be far more efficient
and far more productive for learners, Khan
said.
However, the dominance of the estab
lished system has left it prone to inertia and
lethargy, which, according to Khan, prevents
learners from fully engaging with them edu
cational experience.

motivated to eliminate what he perceives as
its most egregious inefficiencies.
And the numbers back him up. Time maga
zine's recent higher education spread includ
ed a survey that yielded disheartening
results.
Eighty percent of the general public
believes that "at many colleges, the education
students receive is not worth what they pay
for it." And 83 percent believe that "at many
colleges, there is too much of a disconnect
between the courses offered and student's
career goals."
With student debt standing at $956 billion,
according to Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, the problem is only getting worse.
Khan is committed to new forms of peda
gogy, instruction, different emphases in the
classroom and a fundamental reorganization
of how we learn and what we gain from learn
ing. He and his team are working to make
this vision a reality.

"I think that the
general narrative is that
people learn when its
active and when it's at
their own pace."
