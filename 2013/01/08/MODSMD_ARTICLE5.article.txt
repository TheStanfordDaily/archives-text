## Arrillaga-backed project stricken from June ballot 27 University Ave. office and theatre complex stalled by City Council 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
The proposed arts and innovation district
near the Palo Alto Caltrain station will no
longer be on the ballot for local voters in June.
On Dec. 4, the Palo Alto City Council rejected,
in an early vote, the staff proposal recommend
ing a June ballot measure, after hours of public
hearings and dozens of speakers.
The Council instead voted to continue with
the master plans for the John Arrillaga '6O
- project while looking at alternative
plans to develop the land.
The Arrillaga plan would build four office
towers and a theater near the station. Some of
the towers are planned to exceed 100 feet in
height, which was a point of contention for
many community members at the public hear
ing.
Plans for the project had reduced the maxi
mum height of the towers from 150 feet down to
just over 100 feet due to concern about height.
Building heights are limited to 50 feet by city
statute.
Others at the hearing expressed concern
that many meetings about the project had
taken place in private, without going on the
public record. Representatives of the business
and arts communities, however, expressed sup

port for the project at the hearing.
The land in question is owned by Stanford
but is within the City of Palo Alto's jurisdiction.
Arrillaga has said that he intends to donate pro
ceeds from the project to the University. Mayor

Yiaway Yeh and Councilman Larry Klein
recused themselves from the vote because their
spouses are both connected to Stanford.
