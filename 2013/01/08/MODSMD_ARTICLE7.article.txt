## An open apology to Zach Ertz 
### Joseph Beyda 
Not that he really needs one
as he heads for fame and
fortune in the NFL, but I
owe Zach Ertz a bit of an
apology
Last May I wrote that a tight end
would be Stanford football's next break
out player—but I chose Levine Toilolo
over his fellow senior Ertz. I argued
that the 6-foot-8-inch Tbilolo's height
would make him an ideal target for
whatever inaccurate quarterback
replaced Andrew Luck, while Ertz
would continue to thrive on underneath
slant routes as an occasional contributor
like he had in 2011.
Tfet Ertz was a changed man this fall.
His production nearly tripled, from 27
catches and 346 yards to 69 catches and
898 yards, and he nabbed at least as
many receptions as Tbilolo (just 24
catches and 393 yards) in 13 of
Stanford's 14 games. Ertz had multiple
catches 13 times and caught at least one
pass in each and every game; Tbilolo
had multiple catches six times and was
completely silent on three occasions.
Unless you believe (as I do) that my
erroneous prediction lit a fire under
Ertz and singlehandedly led to his spec
tacular 1 season, it's worth exploring why
he was so much more successful than
Tbilolo in 2012.
Ertz's biggest strength is undoubt
edly the ease with which he gets open.
His jukes near the line of scrimmage
and ability to create separation down
field resemble a wide receiver's, not a
tight end's.
Those skills were showcased in last
week's Rose Bowl. Late in the first
quarter, he blew by Wisconsin defend
er's out of a run formation for a 43-yard,
leaping grab to set up Stanford's second
touchdown, but arguably more impres
sive were his other two catches of the
afternoon. He used the same spin move
on both —the first one from the right
side of the formation, the second one
fiom the left—freezing the Badger
secondary for mirror-irnage, nine-yard
gains. Both came during Cardinal scor
ing drives.
Ertz's elusiveness also paid divi
dends when Josh Nunes and Kevin
Hogan were under pressure. Take his
best game of the season, an 11-catch,
106-yard performance in Stanford's
upset at No. 2 Oregon. About half of
Ertz's receptions came when Hogan
had time and found him open at the end
of a route, but what about when the
Ducks got into the backfield? TWice
Ertz escaped a block and became an
easy safety valve for his quarterback;
three times he abandoned his route and
came back to the ball for a downfield
catch.

Ibilolo also saved some broken plays
in Eugene, but in general he had a hard
er time getting open than his counter
part. Though two of his three games
without receptions were against top-tier
pass defenses in Notre Dame and
Wisconsin, Tbilolo managed on e fewer
catch this season than in 2011 while
playing in one more game and with
one of the best college tight ends in
recent memory, Coby Fleener, off to
the NFL and no longer hogging
receptions.
When Toilolo did get open he was
plagued by dropped passes. And even
for all his jump-ball catches in the
endzone, I can't help but think that
Toilolo's height was more of a distrac
tion than an asset at times this sea
son. Nunes was guilty of both over
throws and underthrows on the jump
ball —most notably the interception
that effectively ended Stanford's upset
loss to Washington.
As recently as the Rose Bowl,
Hogan missed Toilolo high in the end
zone With Stanford up 17-14 with
four minutes to play, Toilolo broke
free of his defender on third and four
from the Wisconsin five-yard line.
Despite 80 inches of open space
between Toilolo's feet and his head,
Hogan unnecessarily threw high and
Toilolo's jump was late, leaving the
door open for one last Badger drive.
Though that incompletion was a
result of either poor mechanics or
decision-making from Hogan, it's
clear that Toilolo's height wasn't as
much of a safety net for Stanford's
journeyman quarterbacks as expect
ed.
Even with many analysts claiming
that Toilolo is not NFL-ready after
his poor showing this season, it makes
some sense that he will look to prove
himself in the pros instead of on the
Farm next year. Maybe a seasoned
quarterback will be better able to
exploit Toilolo's physical gifts than
Stanford's skilled but still inexperi
enced passers.
In any case, we'll always remem
ber 2012 as the year of No. 86, not No.
11 like I had expected. Being wrong
Ertz so good.
