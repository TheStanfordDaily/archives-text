# OFF TO A GOOD START
## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL SWEEPS TWO 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
As students began to trickle
back from winter break, the new
look Stanford men's volleyball
team took to the court determined
to demonstrate that despite per
sonnel losses it was still a force to
be reckoned with in the MPSF.
With victories over Grand Canyon
and George Mason, the Cardinal
certainly showed that it hasn't lost
a step.

No. 3 Stanford (2-0) lost one of
its all-time great classes after last
season, with the graduation of three
AU-Americans Erik Shoji, Brad
Lawson and Evan Barry — as
well as four-year starter Gus Ellis.
Therefore, coach John Kosty was
depending on young players to
step up and make the most of their
time in the spotlight.

The Cardinal started the
match shakily, as Grand Canyon
led for much of the opening set.
After rallying to tie the match at
22, Kosty sent in sophomore oppo
site Matt Aiello, who uncorked a
powerful serve that paved the way
for a Cardinal point. Stanford con
tinued its charge, taking the first
set 25-23 and cruising to victory in

the second, 25-17.
The inexperience of the
Stanford squad began to show at
times, as the Cardinal fell behind
early and couldn't rally, dropping
the set 25-18. As a result, Stanford
came out firing in the fourth, tak
ing the set 25-17.
Freshman setter James Shaw,
taking over for Barry, was impres
sive in his first game, posting 38
assists and seven digs, while also
adding six kills. Another addition
to the lineup, junior libera Scott
"Scooter" Sakaida had a solid
debut, with 18 digs.
The graduations also caused a
couple position changes, as junior
Brian Cook shifted from opposite
to outside hitter, while fellow jun
ior Eric Mochalski moved from
middle blocker to opposite. Both
played extremely well in their new
positions, as Cook posted 13 kills
and five digs, hitting .312, while
Mochalski contributed 10 kills,
nine digs, six blocks and an ace.
The graduation of Ellis and
shift of Mochalski paved the way
for a new starter at middle block
er, Spencer Haly. The sophomore
Haly did not play last year, but

had a solid debut, with seven kills
and eight blocks, while hitting .462.
The victory gave the Cardinal
confidence going into its Saturday
match with No. 14 George Mason,
and it certainly came out firing,
taking the first set 25-18. The
Patriots fought back in the second
set, making a number of incredible
defensive plays that flustered the
Cardinal attack. Despite a heroic
effort from Cook, who posted eight
kills with no errors, George Mason
stole the set 25-23.
Cook continued his dominance
throughout. He finished with 19
kills and hit .500 while adding five
digs. The Stanford team rose to his
level of play, refusing to let George
Mason back into the game and win
ning the third and fourth sets 25-16

and 25-18.
Shaw had another big game for
the Cardinal, posting his first dou
ble-double with 46 assists, 10 digs
and four blocks. Junior Daniel
Tublin, making his first career
start at opposite after Mochalski
shifted back to middle blocker,
added a career-high 14 kills and
eight digs. Mochalski had his typi
cal across-the-board effort, with
seven kills, three aces, four digs
and nine blocks.
The Cardinal hit .378 as a team
against the Patriots, while holding
them to just a .126 effort, an impres
sive all-around effort that bodes
well for its future performance.
The Cardinal will face the UC-
Santa Cruz Banana Slugs on Friday,
before opening conference play
against Pacific on Saturday. Both
games will take place at 7 p.m. at
Burnham Pavilion.
