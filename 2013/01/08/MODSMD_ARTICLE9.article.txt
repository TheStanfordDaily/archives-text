## Toilolo, Ertz to enter NFL draft 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Ail-American tight end Zach
Ertz and fellow senior tight end
Levine Toilolo both announced on
Monday that they would declare
for the NFL draft and not be back
for their final year of eligibility at
Stanford.
Their departures, while not
entirely unexpected, slightly
dampened the excitement gener
ated by classmates and defensive
stars Ben Gardner, Shayne Skov
and Trent Murphy all declaring
that they would be back on the
Farm for a run at the BCS title in
2013.
Ertz in particular will be
missed from the Stanford offen
sive unit next season. The latest in
a series of outstanding tight ends
that gave the Farm claim to "Tight
End U," Ertz was the Cardinal's
leading receiver with 69 receptions
for 898 yards and six touchdowns.
He is following in the footsteps
of Coby Fleener, drafted 34th
overall by the Indiannapolis Colts
last year, Jim Dray (2010) playing
for the Arizona Cardinals and
Konrad Reuland (2011) for the
New York Jets.
"Stanford's had a lot of great
tight ends for sure," Ertz said.
"Guys like Jim and Konrad really
started it lately, and I'm just
thankful to have been a part of it."
"The Stanford (positives) speak
for themselves, and I'm going to
miss it," added Ertz, who is pro
jected to be selected late in the
first round or early in the second.
"I've had a lot of great experi
ences. But I gathered all the facts
and made the decision," he said.
He is a senior academically and
on track to earn his degree this
spring in management science and
engineering.

Toilolo started every game
alongside Ertz in Stanford's two
tight-end formation, averaged
16.4 yards per catch and scored
four touchdowns. He is consid
ered an intriguing NFL prospect
because of his 6-foot-8-inch frame

and agility.
"After much thought, prayer,
and discussion with my family, I
have decided to forgo my senior
season of eligibility and enter the

Although his production was not on par with Zach Ertz's, fellow senior tight end Levine Toilolo has attracted
