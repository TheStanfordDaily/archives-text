# Tight End U
## Toilolo, Ertz to enter NFL draft 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Ail-American tight end Zach
Ertz and fellow senior tight end
Levine Toilolo both announced on
Monday that they would declare
for the NFL draft and not be back
for their final year of eligibility at
Stanford.
Their departures, while not
entirely unexpected, slightly
dampened the excitement gener
ated by classmates and defensive
stars Ben Gardner, Shayne Skov
and Trent Murphy all declaring
that they would be back on the
Farm for a run at the BCS title in
2013.
Ertz in particular will be
missed from the Stanford offen
sive unit next season. The latest in
a series of outstanding tight ends
that gave the Farm claim to "Tight
End U," Ertz was the Cardinal's
leading receiver with 69 receptions
for 898 yards and six touchdowns.
He is following in the footsteps
of Coby Fleener, drafted 34th
overall by the Indiannapolis Colts
last year, Jim Dray (2010) playing
for the Arizona Cardinals and
Konrad Reuland (2011) for the
New York Jets.
"Stanford's had a lot of great
tight ends for sure," Ertz said.
"Guys like Jim and Konrad really
started it lately, and I'm just
thankful to have been a part of it."
"The Stanford (positives) speak
for themselves, and I'm going to
miss it," added Ertz, who is pro
jected to be selected late in the
first round or early in the second.
"I've had a lot of great experi
ences. But I gathered all the facts
and made the decision," he said.
He is a senior academically and
on track to earn his degree this
spring in management science and
engineering.

Toilolo started every game
alongside Ertz in Stanford's two
tight-end formation, averaged
16.4 yards per catch and scored
four touchdowns. He is consid
ered an intriguing NFL prospect
because of his 6-foot-8-inch frame

and agility.
"After much thought, prayer,
and discussion with my family, I
have decided to forgo my senior
season of eligibility and enter the

Senior tight end Zach Ertz (86) was Stanford's leading target this season,
catching a team-high 69 passes for 898 yards. He was named
a First-Team All-American by each team that included a tight end.

Although his production was not on par with Zach Ertz's, fellow senior tight end Levine Toilolo has attracted
attention from several teams as an intriguing NFL prospect with his 6-foot-8-inch size and athleticism.
NFL draft," Toilolo said in a state
ment released by the school.
Ertz has not picked an agent
and will train for the draft workouts
at California Strength in San
Ramon, the same facility used by
former Stanford players Ryan
Whalen and Chris Owusu. He plans
to withdraw from school for the
winter academic quarter in order to
participate in the pre-draft process.
He will re-enroll for the spring
quarter and graduate in June.
With both players leaving, as
well as graduating senior running
back Stepfan Taylor, Stanford will
have to find new sources on offense
alongside the emergence of red
shirt freshman quarterback Kevin
Hogan.
Freshman Luke Kaumatule and
sophomore Devon Cajuste will be
in the mix to replace both next sea
son. Standout fullback Ryan
Hewitt also has played tight end
sparingly, and has showed great
potential catching passes out of the
backfield. Stanford coach David
Shaw said last week that tight ends
have been his biggest focus in

recruiting.
"Kevin's special, man," Ertz
said. "All those guys coming back
on defense, I think they're going to
be one of the best teams in the
country next year," Ertz said by
phone. "They're going to be really

good. But at the same time, I have
to do what's best for me and my
family at this time. I couldn't pass
up the opportunity."
