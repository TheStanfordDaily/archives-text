# BATTLE WON
## CARD DEFEATS CAL ON ROAD 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The highly touted matchup
between the Stanford and UC
Berkeley women's basketball
teams, regarded as the "Battle of
the Bay," lived up to its title as
both teams fought tirelessly from
start to finish.
Neither team dominated the
other until Stanford (14-1, 3-0 Pac
-12) took charge in the remaining
six minutes of play to capture the
win over the rivaled Golden Bears
(12-2, 2-1 Pac-12). In the past,
Stanford has beaten Cal by an
average of 19.2 points, but this
game went down to the wire, with
numerous ties and lead changes as
both teams came out hungry for a
win.
"This was a big game. Cal has a
great team ... really competitive,"
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our team
stepped up to the challenge and
[sophomore guard] Amber
[Orrange] did a good job of run
ning our team and [junior forward]
Chiney [Ogwumike] was on the
other book end ... but it was a
great team effort."
Liberal scoring by Cal's
starters and bench made it difficult
for Stanford to pull ahead. The
Stanford reserves contributed
only one point, compared to 13
from Cal's bench. The Bears
offense was lead by senior guard
Layshia Clarendon with 17 points
and six rebounds. Ogwumike led
the Card with 26 points and six
rebounds.
Cal entered halftime with a
point advantage after sophomore
guard Brittney Boyd (nine points,
nine rebounds) stripped Orrange
(15 points, eight rebounds) with
five seconds to play and finished
with an easy lay up.
Both teams, however, came out
strong in the second half. The first
five minutes of the half were domi
nated by run and gun basketball,
which is not typically Stanford's
style of play, usually opting to play
a more disciplined offense.
Orrange did an excellent job, with
the task of slowing the offense
down and managing Cal's defense.
With neither team shooting
well, it really became a defensive

game decided by rebounding and
second chance opportunities.
Stanford was outrebounded, but
made the shots in the end that
determined the final outcome.
Since the three-point shots weren't
falling and the players weren't
able to get good, open looks, the

Card took the ball hard to the bas
ket and converted at the free
throw line.
Stanford matched Cal's defen
sive tenacity towards the end of
the game and created a faster
paced offense and defense to com
pensate for Berkeley's run-and

gun style of play. With six minutes
left, in Cal style, Stanford's senior
forward Joslyn Tinkle cherry
picked to the opposite end of the
floor and finished with a huge lay
up to push the Cardinal lead to 52-

Stanford's junior forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) drives to the hoop against California's Talia Caldwell (33)
in the second half of the Pac-12 women's basketball Battle of the Bay at Hass Pavilion in Berkeley yesterday.
Ogwumike led her team with 26 points and six rebounds.
46, its largest lead of the
game, forcing Berkeley to
call a timeout.
The Card's help-side
defense and hedging on
screens forced Cal into a
desperation shot as the shot
clock expired with under five
minutes to play and Stanford
was given an opportunity to
capitalize on the offensive
end.
As time ran out on
Stanford's own shot clock,
the Card also pulled off an
amazing desperation play
with 4:30 left in the game.
Tinkle in-bounded the ball
cross court to Ogwumike
who jumped up amidst three
Cal defenders to finish at the
basket with .1 seconds on the
board to extend the lead to
54-46.
Ogwumike had an
impressive game scoring,
but struggled throughout on
the boards. However, she did
manage to grab crucial
rebounds towards the end of

the game when the put
backs mattered most.
With 1:30 to play, the
score at 49-59, a clutch lay up
by Tinkle, who hadn't seen
much success at the start of
the game, scoring only two
points in the first half, put
Stanford ahead by ten and
the senior finished with
eight points and four
rebounds.
A pair of free throws by
Orrange and a block by
Ogwumike on the other end
then put the Card up by 12
and allowed it to confidently
break the Cal press and seal
the victory.
The leadership of
Ogwumike, Tinkle and
Orrange kept Stanford
together and helped the
team outmatch Berkeley in
its own style of fast paced
play, demonstrating the ver
satility of its offense and
defense.
However, VanDerveer
was not satisfied with this
win and wants a more defini
tive victory against the
Bears on Sunday. The Card
was substantially outre
bounded 45-31 for the first
time since the Fresno State

game. In addition, Stanford
did not hit a three-point
shot, the first time the Card
has gone cold from down
town since March 2012.
"We tried to keep them
off the boards and limit
their easy baskets; not let
them get run-outs even
though they did a get a cou
ple of those ... [junior
guard] Toni [Kokenis] did a
really good job on
[Clarendon] and we took
care of the ball. I wouldn't
say it was our A-game, but
considering how much trav
eling we've done in the past
two weeks, I'm proud of our
team and how hard they
played," VanDerveer said.
"This is just the first half
and we turn around and
play again on Sunday so
let's see if we can play bet
ter on Sunday and I think
it'll be better for both teams
because we'll be a little
more rested."
The Card faces the Cal
Golden Bears for a rematch
at Maples Pavilion at 1 p.m.
on Sunday.
