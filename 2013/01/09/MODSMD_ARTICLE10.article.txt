# BATTLE WON
## CARD DEFEATS CAL ON ROAD 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The highly touted matchup
between the Stanford and UC
Berkeley women's basketball
teams, regarded as the "Battle of
the Bay," lived up to its title as
both teams fought tirelessly from
start to finish.
Neither team dominated the
other until Stanford (14-1, 3-0 Pac
-12) took charge in the remaining
six minutes of play to capture the
win over the rivaled Golden Bears
(12-2, 2-1 Pac-12). In the past,
Stanford has beaten Cal by an
average of 19.2 points, but this
game went down to the wire, with
numerous ties and lead changes as
both teams came out hungry for a
win.
"This was a big game. Cal has a
great team ... really competitive,"
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our team
stepped up to the challenge and
[sophomore guard] Amber
[Orrange] did a good job of run
ning our team and [junior forward]
Chiney [Ogwumike] was on the
other book end ... but it was a
great team effort."
Liberal scoring by Cal's
starters and bench made it difficult
for Stanford to pull ahead. The
Stanford reserves contributed
only one point, compared to 13
from Cal's bench. The Bears
offense was lead by senior guard
Layshia Clarendon with 17 points
and six rebounds. Ogwumike led
the Card with 26 points and six
rebounds.
Cal entered halftime with a
point advantage after sophomore
guard Brittney Boyd (nine points,
nine rebounds) stripped Orrange
(15 points, eight rebounds) with
five seconds to play and finished
with an easy lay up.
Both teams, however, came out
strong in the second half. The first
five minutes of the half were domi
nated by run and gun basketball,
which is not typically Stanford's
style of play, usually opting to play
a more disciplined offense.
Orrange did an excellent job, with
the task of slowing the offense
down and managing Cal's defense.
With neither team shooting
well, it really became a defensive

game decided by rebounding and
second chance opportunities.
Stanford was outrebounded, but
made the shots in the end that
determined the final outcome.
Since the three-point shots weren't
falling and the players weren't
able to get good, open looks, the

Card took the ball hard to the bas
ket and converted at the free
throw line.
Stanford matched Cal's defen
sive tenacity towards the end of
the game and created a faster
paced offense and defense to com
pensate for Berkeley's run-and

gun style of play. With six minutes
left, in Cal style, Stanford's senior
forward Joslyn Tinkle cherry
picked to the opposite end of the
floor and finished with a huge lay
up to push the Cardinal lead to 52-
