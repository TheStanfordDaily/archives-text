# BROWN HEADS TO PROS

### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Cornerback Terrence
Brown, quietly one of
Stanford's most improved
defenders this season,
announced Thesday he would
forgo a fifth year on the
Farm and enter the NFL
Draft.
"My admission to
Stanford University in 2009
was a life-changing event for
me, and all of the faculty,
students and staff I have
met since have truly blessed
and enriched me," Brown
said in a statement. "I will
forever and always be a
Cardinal."
He will still earn his
degree in Science, Technology
and Society this spring.
Brown started all 14
games for the Cardinal (12-2,
8-1 Pac-12) and was the
team's fifth-leading tackier
with 65 stops this season. His
10 passes defended ranked
only behind the figures post
ed by safeties Jordan
Richards (15) and Ed
Reynolds (11) and he notched
two breakups each in
Stanford's upsets of top-five
opponents USC and Oregon.
Brown also started nine
times in 2011 while appearing
in every game.
The announcement made
Brown the third redshirt
junior to pass up a fifth year
this week, after tight ends
Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo
announced their departure
Monday. But with Shayne
Skov, Ben Gardner and
Trent Murphy tweeting their
decisions to stay at Stanford
on Sunday, the Cardinal still
returns nine starting defend
ers.
Sophomore Wayne Lyons
and junior Barry Browning
will be expected to step up in
Brown's absence.
