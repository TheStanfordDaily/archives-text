## CARD TO FACE COUGARS 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team returns to campus
tonight to face Washington State
at Maples Pavilion. The contest
opens a three-game homestand
that will also include games
against Washington and
California.
The Cardinal (9-6, 0-2 Pac-12)
enters tonight's game needing a
win to erase memories of a con
ference-opening, two-game los
ing streak that has left Stanford
second-to-last in the Pac-12
standings. The Cougars (9-5,0-1)
have had a similar season so far
and also started Pac-12 play with
an 81-69 loss against the in-state
rival Huskies last weekend.
The game against
Washington (9-5, 1-0) will then
follow this Saturday and the
Battle of the Bay against
Berkeley (9-5,1-1) will be played
a week later on Saturday, Jan. 19.
This will be Stanford's longest
homestand of the conference sea
son and comes at a crucial time
for the Cardinal. Ahead of the
start of the Pac-12, Stanford was
picked to finish fourth by confer
ence coaches, in comparison to
the Cougars' preseason predic
tion of 10th, so the team will be
hoping for a significant improve
ment.
Last year Stanford lost just
two Pac-12 games at Maples and
so far this season is 6-1 in home
games. Washington State, in
comparison, has played just one
true road game this year, an
early-season 58-56 overtime loss
to Pepperdine, and is an even 2-2
in games played at neutral sites.
Stanford junior forward
Dwight Powell's performance
will be crucial tonight. In the
three games he has played so
far in his career against the
Cougars, he has averaged
10.0 points and 6.7 rebounds
per game. He also grabbed
his third double-double of the
year in the 68-60 loss to
UCLA last weekend, with 17
points and 13 rebounds.
Alongside Powell, the
Card will look to sophomore
guard Chasson Randle, who
also scored 17 points against
the Bruins for his highest
total since late November,
and junior forward Josh

Huestis, who notched up his
sixth double-figure rebound
game on Saturday. Junior
forward John Gage also had
another strong performance
last weekend, contributing 10
points to Stanford's total.
However, Stanford will
also hope to rely on other
players like Aaron Bright,
whose 31.9 percent shooting
average for this season so far
is in stark contrast to his
career record of 16.7 percent
against Washington State.
The Cougars are led by
senior forward Brock
Motum, with an average of
19.4 points and 6.9 rebounds
per game, together with
sophomore guard DaVonte
Lacy (11.6 points per game)
and redshirt senior guard
Mike Ladd (9.4 points per

game). In Washington State's
loss on Saturday to
Washington, Ladd, Motum
and Lacy all scored in double
figures, with 16, 15 and 10
points, respectively.
Washington State also has
the best defense in the Pac
-12, allowing just 56.1 points
per game, while Stanford's
scoring offense is just ninth in
the conference, at 69.5 points
per game, two spots ahead of
Washington State's 63.9.
The contest between
Stanford and Washington
State tips off at 7 p.m. tonight
at Maples Pavilion and will be
broadcast live on the Pac-12
Networks and on KZSU and
KNBR radio.
