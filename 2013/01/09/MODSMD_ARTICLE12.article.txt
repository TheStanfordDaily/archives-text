## CARD TO FACE COUGARS 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team returns to campus
tonight to face Washington State
at Maples Pavilion. The contest
opens a three-game homestand
that will also include games
against Washington and
California.
The Cardinal (9-6, 0-2 Pac-12)
enters tonight's game needing a
win to erase memories of a con
ference-opening, two-game los
ing streak that has left Stanford
second-to-last in the Pac-12
standings. The Cougars (9-5,0-1)
have had a similar season so far
and also started Pac-12 play with
an 81-69 loss against the in-state
rival Huskies last weekend.
The game against
Washington (9-5, 1-0) will then
follow this Saturday and the
Battle of the Bay against
Berkeley (9-5,1-1) will be played
a week later on Saturday, Jan. 19.
This will be Stanford's longest
homestand of the conference sea
son and comes at a crucial time
for the Cardinal. Ahead of the
start of the Pac-12, Stanford was
picked to finish fourth by confer
ence coaches, in comparison to
the Cougars' preseason predic
tion of 10th, so the team will be
hoping for a significant improve
ment.
Last year Stanford lost just
two Pac-12 games at Maples and
so far this season is 6-1 in home
games. Washington State, in
comparison, has played just one
true road game this year, an
early-season 58-56 overtime loss
to Pepperdine, and is an even 2-2
in games played at neutral sites.
