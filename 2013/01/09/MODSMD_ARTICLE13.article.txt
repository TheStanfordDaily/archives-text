## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Death, community and the death of community 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Columbine. Aurora. Newtown.
The nation needs answers,
and all we get is more death
and more questions.
The most complex question, and
by far the most heavily politicized, is
why. Why does the United States
have a gun-related murder rate 19.5
times higher than that of similarly
high-income countries around the
world? Why are mass shootings so
devastatingly common here? What
makes us so perversely special?
Conventional liberals have a
ready-made answer: uniquely lax
gun laws and the frustrating perma
nence of the Second Amendment.
Conventional conservatives have no
similar go-to response; gun rights
advocates instead point to causes as
diverse as mental illness, the influ
ence of violent video games, a decline
in religious belief and the gradual
erosion of America's bedrock
Christian morality.
Yet the evidence indicates that
these common explanations for
America's high homicide rate are
unsatisfactory on their own.
Stronger gun laws, for instance, do
not always correlate with less gun
crime, or vice-versa. Among OECD
countries, Mexico, with its near-total
ban on private firearm ownership,
has a firearm homicide rate three
times as high as America's. Tiny
Switzerland, meanwhile, with its
strong tradition of militia service,
has 420,000 assault rifles stored at
private homes and gun ownership
rates second only to the U.S. among
rich countries - yet the small Alpine
nation recorded only 40 gun-related
homicides in 2010. America aver
aged 10,987 per year from 2007
through 2009. The city of Chicago
alone recorded twelve murders in
the first week of 2012.
Most damningly, our homicide
rates are 6.9 times higher than the
rich-country average even when all
types of murder not just homi
cides by gun are included. If peo
ple wanted to kill each other with
equal ferocity in other countries, we
would expect overall murder rates
to be much more similar, even if the
widespread ownership of guns made
them the murder weapon of choice in
the U.S.
The mental illness explanation
suffers from similar problems, as do
the video game and religion narra
tives. There is no reliable evidence to
suggest that the United States has
more mentally ill people per capita
than other rich countries, though as
my colleague Emily Cohodes sug
gests, we have a long way to go in
treating mental illness adequately.
Largely secular Europe has murder
rates far lower than the heavily reli
gious U.S. And there is actually a
negative correlation between video
game spending per capita and gun
violence; game-crazy Japan,
Germany, and South Korea have
per-capita murder rates near zero.
I'm no sociologist, but I think
there's something else going on here
something difficult to quantify,
and something the media has largely
ignored. My guess is that America's
high levels of violence stem at least
in part from the slow disappearance
of community, broadly defined; com
munities that give individual lives
meaning and bind men together in
the social fabric that defines us.
"Man is by nature a social ani
mal," remarked Aristotle in his
Politics-, "an individual who is unso
cial naturally... is either beneath our
notice or more than human." Sartre,
ever the optimist, groaned that "hell
is other people" but history has
given him the lie. Human beings,
buffeted by the tides of suffering and
despair, have always sought solace in
their fellow men.
In uniquely diverse America, a
land explicitly grounded in differ
ence rather than homogeneity, vol
untary association has traditionally
slaked man's thirst for social mean-

ing. Alexis de Tocqueville famously
called us "a nation of joiners" as
early as 1835, observing that
American civil society constituted
itself around voluntary institutions
like the church, the political party,
the reading group and the theater.
But as Harvard sociologist
Robert D. Putnam argues in his
seminal and troubling work
Bowling Alone, participation in
collective social ventures, from bowl
ing clubs to voting booths to labor
unions to churches to the Boy
Scouts, has declined sharply since
the 19605. Putnam laments, with for
midable statistical evidence, the slow
individualization and atomization of
American life. Our connections to
each other are fraying and being
replaced by the formless void of tel
evision and the Internet.
Here could be the missing piece
of the sociological puzzle surround
ing guns and violence. Japan,
Switzerland, Korea all largely
homogeneous societies, whose popu
lations look similar, share basic cul
tural assumptions, in which each
individual naturally recognizes
something of himself in his fellow cit
izen. Belonging to the larger whole is
an easy task.
The U.S. is different. It takes
more work to appreciate the basic
humanity of people who look, talk,
eat and entertain themselves differ
ently than you do. Uniquely high lev
els of income inequality make life
qualitatively different for rich and
poor, separating people into isolated
spheres of existence. Voluntary asso
ciations and institutions have tradi
tionally helped establish unifying
connections across such boundaries,
erasing alienating differences and
forging ties of common humanity.
With their disappearance comes
dislocation and violence. Philosopher
Hannah Arendt has noted that mass
killings require the systematic dehu
manization of the victim; it is hard to
kill someone, after all, with whom
one feels a shared sense of being.
It is unsurprising, then, that so
many mass murderers kill immedi
ately following a serious withdrawal
from society. James Holmes, the
Aurora theater shooter, quit his neu
roscience graduate program at the
University of Colorado in June. He
murdered twelve people in July.
Even before dropping out, Holmes
lacked meaningful connection to the
other students in his program. In the
words of one fellow student: "He
always seemed to be off in his own

The evidence
indicates that
these common
explanations for
Americas high
homicide rate are
unsatisfactory on
their own.
