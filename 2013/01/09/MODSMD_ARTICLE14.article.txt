# Guns and Mental Health
## 
### Emily Cohodes 
James Holmes, the infamous
gunman who committed the
movie theatre massacre in
Aurora, Colorado this past July,
attended a preliminary hearing yes
terday in which police officers and
witnesses testified. If he is found fit
to stand trial, legal analysts predict
that he will plead guilty to the mur
der charges by reason of insanity,
but we will have to wait and see. On
the Thursday of Stanford's finals
week, the town of Newtown,
Connecticut was forever changed by
a shooter that ravaged an elemen
tary school, killing 26 people, most of
them 5 and 6 years of age.
While listening to the news, read
ing the paper and watching the pres
idential address that followed the
Sandy Hook shooting, I could not
help but cringe at the word "inexplic
able" that was often associated with
these tragedies. Obviously most of
us could never imagine opening fire
on schoolchildren or shooting com
pletely innocent victims in a crowded
movie theatre. For those of us who
are healthy, functioning members of
society, the actions of the gunmen in
these two recent high-publicity cases
are the absolute antithesis of our
engagement with our communities.
However, rather than write off the
people responsible for these terrible
tragedies as lunatics without souls or
call their crimes "inexplicable," I
wish we could focus more on the
explanations that are available.
They are harder to find, and more
disturbing.
I am a strong proponent of gun
control laws, but as representatives
debate new gun control policies, we
are only doing half the work if we do

not also look at the landscape of
mental health care in this country.
Without an emphasis on psychiatric
care and well-being in our society, we
are not adequately addressing the
issue at hand.
Along with the faces of the vic
tims whose lives they took, we must
also remember the faces of the
killers. They are just a few of the
many people that slip through the
cracks in the institutional system of
psychiatric care that typically
revolves around the prison system
rather than the health care system.
In reality, these shooters are simply
the highest-profile victims of our
current mental health care system,
the most dramatic cases out of the
thousands of people who do not
receive adequate treatment for men
tal illness. Most people with diagnos
able disorders do not go on to shoot
dozens of children or moviegoers but
rather live unhappy and unproduc
tive lives with little national rever
beration.
These massacres suddenly
become less "inexplicable" as soon
as we consider that these shooters
have serious, clinically diagnosable
mental disorders that, untreated,
make it impossible for them to
function normally. Without a legal
framework that mandates mental
health care (medication, institution
alization, therapy) for these individ
uals, which would give us some
method for dealing with these diag
noses as a society, even the harshest
gun-control laws in the country will
not prevent these people from act
ing out in unjust and damaging
ways, with or without guns. We may
never know the exact diagnoses of

the two recent shooters â€”it
depends on what evidence is dis
closed at trial but hopefully the
fact that a psychiatric disorder
played a key role in the loss of so
many lives will inspire us to seek
reform and devise a more adequate
system for dealing with mental dis
orders in the U.S.
I hope I've made the point that
we must consider mental health
reform in the same breath as gun
control laws, especially as we
respond to the recent tragedies
stemming from guns in the hands of
individuals suffering from mental ill
ness. But what about us? The road to
national mental health reform
begins with all of us. Do your part to
make sure those around you aren't
slipping through the cracks. If you
see someone who looks visibly upset,
stop and ask if you can help or if they
want you to stand with them for a
few minutes. If you know a friend
going through a hard time, take the
time to be with them and support
them, even if it just means giving
them a hug and telling them that
you're there for them.
I'm not suggesting that anyone
you know will be the next mass
shooter, but taking responsibility for
the collective wellness of those
around you is an important step
toward safer communities. Never
underestimate the power of a simple
gesture of care toward a friend or
even a complete stranger. If every
one did just that, chances are we'd
live in a much safer world.
