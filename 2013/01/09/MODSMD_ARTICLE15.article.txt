# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Appreciation for the Stanford Band and Dollies 
### 
I would like to take the glorious occasion of
Stanford's Rose Bowl win to say thank
you to the Stanford Band for their
always-appreciated addition of whimsy
and parody. Even though many people
apparently just don't get it ("Rich white
punks," one You Tube comment pro
claimed. "They don't even have a band
director !" scoffed another), we love our
"anti-marching" band.
Whatever is prized in "normal" march
ing bands, the LSJUMB proudly promotes
the exact opposite. For example:
Never look alike. Forget the matching
uniforms. In fact, we'll give you extra points

for the most outlandish, individual, blatant
ly attention-seeking outfit you can concoct
(and have the balls to wear in public.)
Never stand still. Big, wild, even spastic
moves uncomfortably reminiscent of a
physical malady are encouraged, as long as
you can still (mostly) hit your notes.
Indulge your inner ADHD-distracted self
and feel the beat of your own drummer.
Never move in any coordinated way. It
goes without saying that precision forma
tions are OUT. (Unless to spell, in purpose
ly imperfect lines, carefully-considered
and-then-chosen-anyway words on the
field.)

Never let them see you actually march.
When confronted with a football field or
"turning" a corner on a parade, just run. Or
jump, skip, leap, spin or dance. Skateboards
are also a fun and welcome mode of propul
sion on appropriate surfaces!
Finally, push it all over the top with the
addition of the Tree and the Drum Major.
These critical roles are NOT for the faint of
heart. If you've got what it takes, you are
required to flaunt it.
I must add, of course, a note of appreci
ation for the Dollies. In a bizarre but bril
liant juxtaposition, they are everything the
Band is NOT. The Dollies always look exact

ly the same (from their never-changing
dress styles down to their elegant white
hair ribbons and gloves), move in a perfect
ly coordinated manner through their highly
choreographed dance routines, and provide
a welcome element of class to the Band's
"Where the Wild Things Are" persona. It's
a winning combination.
Together, the LSJUMB and Dollies cre
ated just as much entertainment and excite
ment as did the Rose Bowl-winning football
team in Pasadena. I loved it, and thank you!
