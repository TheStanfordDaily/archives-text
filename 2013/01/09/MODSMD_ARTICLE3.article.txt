## ASB sees drop in applicant interest Group chooses to open second round applications for 13 of 18 trips 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) had to
allow second-round applications for 13 of 18
trips this year as the program has seen a dra
matic drop-off in interest in its 26th year.
"Usually our average is about 40 people
applying per trip and this year I'd say the aver
age was about 25 or so," said Jon McConnell,
associate director for public service education
and ASB program adviser.
Applications for the 13 trips opened to a sec
ond round were due on Nov. 30.
"We haven't had as many applications this
year for [any service-related events]. It's really
strange," ASB Executive Director Anna Nti-
Asare 'l4 said. "We're not sure why or what's
going on or if there's just a lot more happen
ing."
McConnell explained that a second round

was needed "just because there were fewer stu
dents that were matched on trips." A student
can apply to a maximum of three ASB trips,
and some popular trips receive many applica
tions but can only accept 12 participants.
According to McConnell, many trips are full
but need to fill up their waitlist spots.
Aside from sending out emails and posting
flyers, ASB mainly relies on students who have
gone on past trips to promote the program
among the Stanford community.
"I think most of it comes from word of
mouth and the experiences people have had in
the program in the past and longing to kind of
share that with other people." Nti-Asare said.
She expressed her personal enthusiasm
about this year's trips, calling them "the most
diverse set of trips that we've ever had."
McConnell also praised the diversity of this
year's student-led and student-conceived trips.
"The courses and trips every year are won
derful. They represent the diverse interests
and experiences of our stu
dents," he said. "I'm always
just sort of awed by the amaz
ing and interesting topics that
come through every year."
According to McConnell,
most of this year's programs
are "new twists on old trips,"
with programs focusing on
women's health, poverty and
identity, all topics covered in
past years. However, these
concepts are being applied to

new environments this year,
like "Circus for Community
Building and Social Change,"
a new program that plans to
explore what binds the cir
cus's identity of "otherness."
It's a trip that Nti-Asare is
looking forward to.
"It really stands out to me
because it reinvents the way
many people would look at
the circus," she said.
Fabiola Esquivel 'l5 was a
participant in "Life and
Shadows," last year's trip on
immigration. She is leading it
this year to expose partici
pants to the "lives of immi
grants and what they do in

their daily lives."
Similarly, trip leader
Emily Liang 'l4 drew from
her own experience as a par
ticipant.
"It was a really life-chang
ing experience for me and
hopefully I give that same
experience to the partici
pants," she said.
But in light of this year's
subdued interest, Nti-Asare
urged past ASB participants
to "reach out to more people"
to reverse the downturn in
years to come.
