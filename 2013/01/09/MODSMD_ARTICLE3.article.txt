## ASB sees drop in applicant interest Group chooses to open second round applications for 13 of 18 trips 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
Alternative Spring Break (ASB) had to
allow second-round applications for 13 of 18
trips this year as the program has seen a dra
matic drop-off in interest in its 26th year.
"Usually our average is about 40 people
applying per trip and this year I'd say the aver
age was about 25 or so," said Jon McConnell,
associate director for public service education
and ASB program adviser.
Applications for the 13 trips opened to a sec
ond round were due on Nov. 30.
"We haven't had as many applications this
year for [any service-related events]. It's really
strange," ASB Executive Director Anna Nti-
Asare 'l4 said. "We're not sure why or what's
going on or if there's just a lot more happen
ing."
McConnell explained that a second round

was needed "just because there were fewer stu
dents that were matched on trips." A student
can apply to a maximum of three ASB trips,
and some popular trips receive many applica
tions but can only accept 12 participants.
According to McConnell, many trips are full
but need to fill up their waitlist spots.
Aside from sending out emails and posting
flyers, ASB mainly relies on students who have
gone on past trips to promote the program
among the Stanford community.
"I think most of it comes from word of
mouth and the experiences people have had in
the program in the past and longing to kind of
share that with other people." Nti-Asare said.
She expressed her personal enthusiasm
about this year's trips, calling them "the most
diverse set of trips that we've ever had."
McConnell also praised the diversity of this
year's student-led and student-conceived trips.
"The courses and trips every year are won
derful. They represent the diverse interests
