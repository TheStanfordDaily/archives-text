# Professionals, student groups to share Bing
## Concert hall schedule favors affiliated groups 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
With Stanford University's $ll2 million
Bing Concert Hall set to open this Friday,
many student musicians and dancers are
questioning how student groups were select
ed to perform in the inaugural season.
More than 20 professional musicians and
musical groups are scheduled to perform
after Bing's opening on Jan. 11. About a
dozen student groups are also listed online
to perform during the inaugural season,
including Stanford Taiko, Stanford Laptop
Orchestra and the Stanford Symphony and
Philharmonic Orchestras.

The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will
play seven times, and the Stanford
Philharmonic Orchestra will play four times.
Both orchestras are affiliated with the
Department of Music.

The majority of the dozens of music and
dance groups at Stanford will not perform at
Bing at all this season. Student musicians
and dancers say they are confused about the
process by which groups were chosen to per
form, and concerned that in the future,
groups not affiliated with an academic
department will be at a disadvantage when
trying to schedule a performance slot.

Questions surround the selection process
According to Stephen Sano, chair of the
Department of Music, independent groups
will be required to submit an inquiry that
will be reviewed by the Bing Concert Hall
Users Committee, which includes represen
tatives from the Stanford Arts Institute,
Stanford Live, the Department of Music, the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies and the ASSU.
Decisions regarding student perform
ances in the inaugural season at Bing were
made by the Department of Music and
Stanford Live, the home for performing arts
on campus, Sano said. He noted that the
Department of Music was not involved in
selecting which unaffiliated groups were
scheduled to perform.
The two main concerns when choosing
groups to perform were hosting a variety of
sounds and ensuring that each group would
be able to set up and perform in a specified
amount of time, according to Sano.
"As with any programming decisions, a
lot of thought has to go into how the differ
ent components of the performance balance
each other, and flow as a complete program,"
