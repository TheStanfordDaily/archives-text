# Professionals, student groups to share Bing
## Concert hall schedule favors affiliated groups 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
With Stanford University's $ll2 million
Bing Concert Hall set to open this Friday,
many student musicians and dancers are
questioning how student groups were select
ed to perform in the inaugural season.
More than 20 professional musicians and
musical groups are scheduled to perform
after Bing's opening on Jan. 11. About a
dozen student groups are also listed online
to perform during the inaugural season,
including Stanford Taiko, Stanford Laptop
Orchestra and the Stanford Symphony and
Philharmonic Orchestras.

The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will
play seven times, and the Stanford
Philharmonic Orchestra will play four times.
Both orchestras are affiliated with the
Department of Music.

The majority of the dozens of music and
dance groups at Stanford will not perform at
Bing at all this season. Student musicians
and dancers say they are confused about the
process by which groups were chosen to per
form, and concerned that in the future,
groups not affiliated with an academic
department will be at a disadvantage when
trying to schedule a performance slot.

Questions surround the selection process
According to Stephen Sano, chair of the
Department of Music, independent groups
will be required to submit an inquiry that
will be reviewed by the Bing Concert Hall
Users Committee, which includes represen
tatives from the Stanford Arts Institute,
Stanford Live, the Department of Music, the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies and the ASSU.
Decisions regarding student perform
ances in the inaugural season at Bing were
made by the Department of Music and
Stanford Live, the home for performing arts
on campus, Sano said. He noted that the
Department of Music was not involved in
selecting which unaffiliated groups were
scheduled to perform.
The two main concerns when choosing
groups to perform were hosting a variety of
sounds and ensuring that each group would
be able to set up and perform in a specified
amount of time, according to Sano.
"As with any programming decisions, a
lot of thought has to go into how the differ
ent components of the performance balance
each other, and flow as a complete program,"
Sano said.
Michael McKenna 'l6,
who sings in Stanford's old
est a cappella group, the
Mendicants, said that he did
not understand why the
Mendicants were not invited
to perform at Bing when
another a cappella group,
Talisman, will be performing
during the inaugural season.
He thinks that there
should have been some kind
of screening process to
determine which groups
received invitations.
"So many people are
going to want to use Bing
that there is no way to let
everyone in," McKenna said.
"There has to be some way to
designate what groups get
time to use it. Whether that's
by audition or not, I don't
know."
Talisman is the only stu
dent group listed in the
online schedule that is not
affiliated with an academic
department. However, in an
email statement to the Daily,
Stanford Live artistic direc
tor Jenny Bilfield said that
there would be a reading of
an opera in spring that is
unaffiliated with the
Department of Music.
Performing groups in the
spotlight
Students are flocking to
the groups that will perform
in the new space, including
the orchestras. According to
Sano, orchestra audition
numbers increased dramati

cally this year a trend that
he attributes to the buzz sur
rounding Bing.
Sano hopes that Bing will
not only attract Stanford stu
dents to musical groups, but
also attract the nation's best
student musicians to
Stanford.
"We are actually already
making plans to leverage the
concert hall as a recruiting
tool for the musical arts on
campus," Sano said. "To have
a world-class hall specifically
designed as a concert hall
and not a multi-use facility
provides our students with a
heretofore unavailable kind
of learning facility."
Gabriel Ehrlich 'l5 was
one of the many students
who decided to audition for
the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra after hearing
about the construction of
Bing. Ehrlich said that he
noticed a rise in interest in
the symphony as Bing has
received more publicity.
"People who didn't audi
tion last year, like me, made
it a priority this year,"
Ehrlich said. "The space and
equipment will inspire me to
play better and practice
harder."
Ehrlich, who took a torn*
inside Bing, said that he was
particularly impressed with
the acoustics of the hall, and
could "hardly tell the differ
ence" between the sound at
the back of the main section
and in the seats right behind
the orchestra.
He also noticed several
unique features that will ben
efit student musicians, such
as specially designed cello
chairs and built-in hydraulic
risers.

A stage for all
Ehrlich predicted that the
average student artist will
not be heavily impacted by
Bing's opening, as most
smaller groups will continue
to practice and perform in
Braun Music Center.
Michelle Xu 'l6 is a mem
ber of two of these smaller
groups. She dances with
Urban Styles, a contempo
rary dance group, and
Alliance, a hip-hop group.
While several student
dance groups that are affili
ated with academic depart
ments, such as "movement
driven band" The Chocolate
Heads, will be performing at
Bing, both Urban Styles and
Alliance will continue per
forming in Cubberley
Auditorium, which Xu said is
inconvenient.
"The stage is too small so
we are forced to change some
of the routines and cut some
people out just so we can fit
everybody onto the stage,"
Xu said, adding that she has
not visited the Bing Concert
Hall.
Xu said that she was
unsure how Stanford Live
and the Department of Music
selected student dance
groups to perform, and wish
es that her groups had been
given the chance to compete
for an invitation to perform
at Bing.
"I definitely like the idea
of having the opportunity to
take initiative and audition
for the space," Xu said.
However, some students
believe that auditions for
performances are unneces
sary, and that student groups
should be able to book per
formance times and attract

their own audiences instead
of relying on Stanford to
advertise and sell tickets for
performances.
"Bing is a part of
Stanford. All music groups
should be able to use it," said
Lissette Valenzuela 'l6, a
member of the Stanford
Wind Ensemble, which will
be performing at Bing. "I
don't think it should be exclu
sive. It's meant to be used by
everyone."
Shannon Xue 'l6, a mem
ber of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and
Alliance, agreed. Xue, who
has practiced in Bing with
the orchestra, said that all
student music groups could
benefit from the size of
Bing and its superior tech
nology in comparison to
Stanford's other perform
ance venues.
"It's such a new place
and all the groups should
have an opportunity to
explore their sound quality
there and have a chance to
perform for a general audi
ence." she said.

in the new space, including
the orchestras. According to
Sano, orchestra audition
numbers increased dramati

cally this year a trend that
he attributes to the buzz sur
rounding Bing.
Sano hopes that Bing will
not only attract Stanford stu
dents to musical groups, but
also attract the nation's best
student musicians to
Stanford.
"We are actually already
making plans to leverage the
concert hall as a recruiting
tool for the musical arts on
campus," Sano said. "To have
a world-class hall specifically
designed as a concert hall
and not a multi-use facility
provides our students with a
heretofore unavailable kind
of learning facility."
Gabriel Ehrlich 'l5 was
one of the many students
who decided to audition for
the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra after hearing
about the construction of
Bing. Ehrlich said that he
noticed a rise in interest in
the symphony as Bing has
received more publicity.
"People who didn't audi
tion last year, like me, made
it a priority this year,"
Ehrlich said. "The space and
equipment will inspire me to
play better and practice
harder."
Ehrlich, who took a torn*
inside Bing, said that he was
particularly impressed with
the acoustics of the hall, and
could "hardly tell the differ
ence" between the sound at
the back of the main section
and in the seats right behind
the orchestra.
He also noticed several
unique features that will ben
efit student musicians, such
as specially designed cello
chairs and built-in hydraulic
risers.

A stage for all
Ehrlich predicted that the
average student artist will
not be heavily impacted by
Bing's opening, as most
smaller groups will continue
to practice and perform in
Braun Music Center.
Michelle Xu 'l6 is a mem
ber of two of these smaller
groups. She dances with
Urban Styles, a contempo
rary dance group, and
Alliance, a hip-hop group.
While several student
dance groups that are affili
ated with academic depart
ments, such as "movement
driven band" The Chocolate
Heads, will be performing at
Bing, both Urban Styles and
Alliance will continue per
forming in Cubberley
Auditorium, which Xu said is
inconvenient.
"The stage is too small so
we are forced to change some
of the routines and cut some
people out just so we can fit
everybody onto the stage,"
Xu said, adding that she has
not visited the Bing Concert
Hall.
Xu said that she was
unsure how Stanford Live
and the Department of Music
selected student dance
groups to perform, and wish
es that her groups had been
given the chance to compete
for an invitation to perform
at Bing.
"I definitely like the idea
of having the opportunity to
take initiative and audition
for the space," Xu said.
However, some students
believe that auditions for
performances are unneces
sary, and that student groups
should be able to book per
formance times and attract

their own audiences instead
of relying on Stanford to
advertise and sell tickets for
performances.
"Bing is a part of
Stanford. All music groups
should be able to use it," said
Lissette Valenzuela 'l6, a
member of the Stanford
Wind Ensemble, which will
be performing at Bing. "I
don't think it should be exclu
sive. It's meant to be used by
everyone."
Shannon Xue 'l6, a mem
ber of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra and
Alliance, agreed. Xue, who
has practiced in Bing with
the orchestra, said that all
student music groups could
benefit from the size of
Bing and its superior tech
nology in comparison to
Stanford's other perform
ance venues.
"It's such a new place
and all the groups should
have an opportunity to
explore their sound quality
there and have a chance to
perform for a general audi
ence." she said.

With Stanford University's $ll2 million
Bing Concert Hall set to open this Friday,
many student musicians and dancers are
questioning how student groups were select
ed to perform in the inaugural season.
More than 20 professional musicians and
musical groups are scheduled to perform
after Bing's opening on Jan. 11. About a
dozen student groups are also listed online
to perform during the inaugural season,
including Stanford Taiko, Stanford Laptop
Orchestra and the Stanford Symphony and
Philharmonic Orchestras.

The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will
play seven times, and the Stanford
Philharmonic Orchestra will play four times.
Both orchestras are affiliated with the
Department of Music.

The majority of the dozens of music and
dance groups at Stanford will not perform at
Bing at all this season. Student musicians
and dancers say they are confused about the
process by which groups were chosen to per
form, and concerned that in the future,
groups not affiliated with an academic
department will be at a disadvantage when
trying to schedule a performance slot.

Questions surround the selection process
According to Stephen Sano, chair of the
Department of Music, independent groups
will be required to submit an inquiry that
will be reviewed by the Bing Concert Hall
Users Committee, which includes represen
tatives from the Stanford Arts Institute,
Stanford Live, the Department of Music, the
Department of Theatre and Performance
Studies and the ASSU.
Decisions regarding student perform
ances in the inaugural season at Bing were
made by the Department of Music and
Stanford Live, the home for performing arts
on campus, Sano said. He noted that the
Department of Music was not involved in
selecting which unaffiliated groups were
scheduled to perform.
The two main concerns when choosing
groups to perform were hosting a variety of
sounds and ensuring that each group would
be able to set up and perform in a specified
amount of time, according to Sano.
"As with any programming decisions, a
lot of thought has to go into how the differ
ent components of the performance balance
each other, and flow as a complete program,"
Sano said.
Michael McKenna 'l6,
who sings in Stanford's old
est a cappella group, the
Mendicants, said that he did
not understand why the
Mendicants were not invited
to perform at Bing when
another a cappella group,
Talisman, will be performing
during the inaugural season.
He thinks that there
should have been some kind
of screening process to
determine which groups
received invitations.
"So many people are
going to want to use Bing
that there is no way to let
everyone in," McKenna said.
"There has to be some way to
designate what groups get
time to use it. Whether that's
by audition or not, I don't
know."
Talisman is the only stu
dent group listed in the
online schedule that is not
affiliated with an academic
department. However, in an
email statement to the Daily,
Stanford Live artistic direc
tor Jenny Bilfield said that
there would be a reading of
an opera in spring that is
unaffiliated with the
Department of Music.
