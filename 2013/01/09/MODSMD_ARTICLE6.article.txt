## Undergrad. Senate submits ARP recommendation 
### OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed all nine clauses of a bill recommend
ing changes to the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) for evaluating cases of sex

bill will be presented to the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) for a vote today.
The bill was drafted during meetings
between Senate and GSC subcommittees

Of the ARP's two statements concern

Senate recommended the deletion of a sec
