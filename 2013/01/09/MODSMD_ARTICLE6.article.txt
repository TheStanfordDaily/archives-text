## Undergrad. Senate submits ARP recommendation 
### OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed all nine clauses of a bill recommend
ing changes to the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) for evaluating cases of sex
ual misconduct at their Jan. 8 meeting. The
bill will be presented to the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) for a vote today.
The bill was drafted during meetings
between Senate and GSC subcommittees
created to discuss the ARE Suggested
modifications to the ARP include adding an
additional faculty or staff member to the
ARP panel, appointing a panel advisor, and
clarifying the appeal process, the method
of checking for panelist bias, and the
process for filtering questions.
"This was the big issue for the 14th
Undergraduate Senate and I think it is a
huge victory that we finally have some
thing on paper," said ASSU Senator
Shahab Fadavi 'l5.

According to senator Viraj Bindra 'l5,
three of the major concerns that students
voiced about the ARP regarded judicial

panel size, whether or not previous sexual
history is relevant and the cross-examina
tion process.
Bindra said that students asked for a
larger panel that included more faculty or
staff members to decide ARP cases. The
bill recommended that the panel be
expanded from three students and one fac
ulty member to three students and two fac
ulty members, a clause that Senate Deputy
Chair Garima Sharma 'l5 abstained from
voting on.
"I knew that confidentiality is some
thing that is very important for the ARP
cases, so I think a four-person panel was a
good size to have," Sharma said. "I didn't
see a compelling reason to increase the
panel size by one person."
Of the ARP's two statements concern
ing the relevance of sexual history, the
Senate recommended the deletion of a sec
tion that states that the inclusion of sexual
history in a case can be relevant when "evi
dence of past sexual history between the
Impacted Party and Responding Student is
offered as evidence of con
sent."
"We didn't feel that was
essentially correct," Bindra
said. "Past consent never
implies current consent."
Senators agreed with
the second statement
regarding the relevance of
sexual history, which states
that sexual history will be
considered if it "provides
direct compelling evidence
on a finding."
However, senators were
unable to make specific rec
ommendations about
whether or not the current
cross-examination system
is appropriate. The current
system involves parties
submitting questions to the
panel after listening to
arguments on the phone
instead of having the
opportunity to address
them directly. The Senate
requested that the BJA fur
ther review this system.
"We didn't necessarily
have a solution," senator
Lauren Miller 'l5 said. "We
had a few students tell us
that the phone-in system
wasn't the best system, but
we haven't been through
the process ourselves so we

couldn't think of a better
system."
After an explanation of
the bill, questions from sev
eral senators and a five
minute recess to review the
clauses, senators passed
the bill. Six of the nine
clauses were passed unani
mously and no senators
voted in opposition to any
of the clauses.
Bindra abstained from
voting on a clause that
asked for the creation of a
caveat to the preponder
ance of evidence section.
The caveat would allow for
review of the ARP in the
future if the federal gov
ernment changes its view
point on the standard of
proof. According to Bindra,
most of the ARP subcom
mittee's members said that
they would support the pre
ponderance of evidence
standard even without the
bureaucracy involved in
contesting it.
"I was not thoroughly
convinced that the prepon
derance of evidence stan
dard was the best that this
college should take on,"
Bindra said. "But I didn't
feel like I should disagree
with it because of its rele
vance and the necessity of
reaching a final conclusion."
If the GSC also approves
the recommendations, the
bill will move to the Board

of Judicial Affairs (BJA).
The BJA will decide
whether to implement the
suggested changes and
may present a modified
version of the ARP to the
Faculty Senate in March.
The Faculty Senate will
have the opportunity to
suggest additional modifi
cations to the ARE
Jonathan York 'l3, co
chair of the Board of
Judicial Affairs (BJA), was
present at the meeting to
answer questions from sen
ators about proposed
changes to the ARE When
Sharma asked York if any
of the changes proposed by
the Senate would be con
tested by the BJA, York
responded that the BJA
might take issue with
changing the number of
panelists to include two fac
ulty or staff members
instead of one.
However, York noted
that this change was not a
"dealbreaker."
"Given that this has
been on the table for two
years now, it's more impor
tant to the Board, and to
myself, frankly, to get [the
ARP] on the books,
whether it's one more or
one less faculty or staff
member," York said.
