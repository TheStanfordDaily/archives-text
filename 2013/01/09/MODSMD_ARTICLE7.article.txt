## Solar house nearing the building stage 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
Eleven months ago, co-founder of
Stanford Solar Decathlon Derek
Ouyang 'l3 said, "We've built solar cars
before; it's about time we built a solar
home."
Today, his project's design is 80 per
cent complete and Ouyang has a lot
more to say about what may be "the
biggest project on campus."
The U.S. Department of Energy
Solar Decathlon challenges 20 colleges
around the world to design, build and
operate solar-powered houses.
The Stanford group, chosen out of a
pool of 40 applicants, had its vision take
shape after it became clear that the
"major vision" of Stanford's solar
house would be a huge metal box called
The Core.
"The Core, as an industry state
ment, houses the most complicated
systems of the house," Ouyang said.
This includes the house's water,
electricity and ventilation systems.
The Core would be assembled in a
factory through a streamlined
process that uses the best materials,
the best technology and reduced
labor costs.

"Instead of building it on-site,
which is basically how things are
done nowadays, you'll be able to pur
chase this online from a specialized
company and it is shipped to you. You
can build your dream house around
it," Ouyang said.
More than just a competition,
Ouyang sees the Solar Decathlon as
an opportunity for change.
"We wanted to build not just one
showcase house. We wanted to devel
op and communicate an idea that
lives on," he said. "When people walk
through our house, we want them to
see not just that one house, but to see

an idea."
And, judging from the reaction of
the team's "industry mentors," that
is precisely what is happening.
"Companies and groups both
from Silicon Valley and the construc
tion industries get really excited
about this. It's a new idea, and they
want to engage with the University,"
said Rob Best, an engineering gradu
ate student and the project design
manager.
For the business management
team, overseen by Emma Sagan 'l4,
the hope is that enthusiasm trans
lates to donations.
"Funding is always a challenge
with a project like this," Sagan said.
"The grant from the Department of
Energy we have received is just one
tenth of the total project budget, and
so we're actively working on getting
funds."
The Department of Energy grant
is $lOO,OOO, while the cost of the
house is estimated to ring in at more
than $1 million.
The team also must overcome the

fact that it is smaller than many other
teams competing in the project, as
well as the fact that many Stanford
students don't realize the project is
even taking place.
Recently, outreach efforts to get
students to like the project's
Facebook page offering free Ike's
sandwiches for Facebook "likes"
did not go as well as the team had
hoped.
"Part of the competition looks at
communication, and the easiest met
ric they have is the number of likes
you have on your Facebook page. So
it's important to us," Sagan said.
"[The lack of likes] sort of surprises
me."
To get the word out, Sagan has
been working with other campus
groups and is trying to keep up a
presence online.
"We've been trying other stuff,
like going to related classes, keeping
up the project blog and trying to join
with other sustainability groups to
raise awareness," she said.
It is also Stanford's first year par

ticipating in the Solar Decathlon,
which means that a significant effort
has to go toward explaining the
essence of the project to students
who have never heard about it before.
"We have about 50 students who
work regularly on the project. Our
emails go out to around 200 students
on campus, and everybody that I talk
to gets really excited about it," Best
said. "Even if they don't directly par
ticipate in it, they think it's a really
cool project."
Ouyang explained he is not very
worried about what some perceive as
apathy toward the project. The solar
house is right on schedule and the
team is expected to start building
soon.
"I'm not worried about [lack of
student interest]" Ouyang said.
"When people come back from spring
break, they'll see a house going up on
campus, and I think that's not some
thing you can't be excited about."
