## The 						Best Cardinal Team Ever? 
### George Chen 
The scene was a spectacle to
behold. The endless rain of
confetti. The roaring
approval of 40,000-plus
faithful. The roses came in
Cardinal red as Stanford football cap
tured its first Rose Bowl victory in over
four decades.
It's been over a week since
Stanford came out on top in Pasadena,
emphatically capping a historic season
that included three overtime games,
two heartbreaking losses and one
improbable conference title. The
future looks even rosier for the
Cardinal with head coach David Shaw
inking a long-term extension, much to
the dismay of at least seven NFL
teams and most of the starters return
ing next season.
But before we look ahead, we must
do one final thing that all sports writers
love to do: make comparisons. With the
season officially over, where does 2012-
2013 team rank among the best
Stanford teams of all time?
There are two things that we
should keep in mind. For starters,
"best" is a subjective word and there
are multiple components of "best" that
must be taken into consideration, espe
cially when comparing teams from dif
ferent years.
Second, it's difficult to compare
teams that are separated by more than
three decades. Pop Warner's 1926
team won Stanford's only national
championship, but the eighty-year gap
makes it an apples-and-oranges type of
comparison. John Ralston led the
Cardinal to two straight Rose Bowl
titles between 1970 and 1972, but those
two teams also suffered three losses.
To make things easier and more
relevant, we'll narrow it down to three
clear candidates for the best Stanford
team of all time: the 2010-2011 Orange
Bowl team, the 2011-2012 Fiesta Bowl
team and of course, this year's Rose
Bowl team.
From a results standpoint, it's clear
to me that the Rose Bowl team beats
out the two other squads. Last year's
team failed to deliver on the biggest
stage against Oregon in the de facto
Pac-12 semifinal game and also against
Oklahoma State in a BCS bowl. The
Orange Bowl team tripped just once,
but it was against Oregon and cost the
Cardinal both a conference title and a
Rose Bowl berth. The fact that this
year's team was able to both beat
Oregon and win the Pac-12 is enough
to overehadow its two losses earlier in
the season. The Orange and Fiesta
Bowls are great, but there's no ques
tioning that the Rose Bowl is more spe
cial to Stanford.

Talent-wise, I would place the Rose
Bowl team ahead of the Orange Bowl
team, but behind the Fiesta Bowl
team. Don't get me wrong, there was
plenty of talent on the field this year;
Zach Ertz has a good shot at being
selected in the first round of the 2013
NFL draft while Chase Thomas and
Stepfan Taylor will likely be selected in
the second or third rounds. But it's dif
ficult to outdo the four players
Andrew Luck, David DeCastro,
Jonathan Martin and Coby Fleener —
who went in the first two rounds of the
2012 NFL draft.

M)u also can't forget that a lot of tal
ent carried over from the Fiesta Bowl
team to the Rose Bowl team. Veterans
like Stepfan Taylor and Ryan Hewitt
saw a ton of action in both seasons
while defensive players like Trent
Murphy, Henry Anderson and Ed
Reynolds possessed the talent all
along, but just needed more playing
time to showcase their skills.
But I do think the Rose Bowl team
is the most complete team among the
three. Sure, this year's offense wasn't
nearly efficient as it was with Luck at
the helm, but the sheer dominance on
defense and improved consistency on
special teams gives it a slight edge. It's
well-documented that this year's
defensive unit has punished speedy
limning backs like Kenjon Barner,
frustrated playmaking wide receivers
like Keenan Allen and terrorized elite
(or so-called elite) quarterbacks like
Matt Barkley.
The only thing spoils writers love
more than making comparisons is
pitching hypothetical. So, would the
Rose Bowl team defeat last year's
Fiesta Bowl team or the Orange Bowl
team two seasons ago? Part of me
thinks that behind one of the greatest
offensive lines in school history, Luck
would have found away to beat this
year's exceptional defensive unit. But
then again, this year's squad made a
name for itself by proving people
wrong.

Either way, it's incredible that
three of the best Stanford teams of all
time have come from the past three
years. And the best part of this debate
is that next year's team will have the
chance to end the discussion for good
by bringing the national cham
pionship trophy to the Fhrm.

George Chen tried calling Pop
Warner for an interview, hut
instead he was sent youth
medium-sized football pads.

There are two things that we
should keep in mind. For starters,
"best" is a subjective word and there
are multiple components of "best" that
must be taken into consideration, espe
cially when comparing teams from dif
ferent years.
Second, it's difficult to compare
teams that are separated by more than
three decades. Pop Warner's 1926
team won Stanford's only national
championship, but the eighty-year gap
makes it an apples-and-oranges type of
comparison. John Ralston led the
Cardinal to two straight Rose Bowl
titles between 1970 and 1972, but those
two teams also suffered three losses.
To make things easier and more
relevant, we'll narrow it down to three
clear candidates for the best Stanford
team of all time: the 2010-2011 Orange
Bowl team, the 2011-2012 Fiesta Bowl
team and of course, this year's Rose
Bowl team.
From a results standpoint, it's clear
to me that the Rose Bowl team beats
out the two other squads. Last year's
team failed to deliver on the biggest
stage against Oregon in the de facto
Pac-12 semifinal game and also against
Oklahoma State in a BCS bowl. The
Orange Bowl team tripped just once,
but it was against Oregon and cost the
Cardinal both a conference title and a
Rose Bowl berth. The fact that this
year's team was able to both beat
Oregon and win the Pac-12 is enough
to overehadow its two losses earlier in
the season. The Orange and Fiesta
Bowls are great, but there's no ques
tioning that the Rose Bowl is more spe
cial to Stanford.

Talent-wise, I would place the Rose
Bowl team ahead of the Orange Bowl
team, but behind the Fiesta Bowl
team. Don't get me wrong, there was
plenty of talent on the field this year;
Zach Ertz has a good shot at being
selected in the first round of the 2013
NFL draft while Chase Thomas and
Stepfan Taylor will likely be selected in
the second or third rounds. But it's dif
ficult to outdo the four players
Andrew Luck, David DeCastro,
Jonathan Martin and Coby Fleener —
who went in the first two rounds of the
2012 NFL draft.

M)u also can't forget that a lot of tal
ent carried over from the Fiesta Bowl
team to the Rose Bowl team. Veterans
like Stepfan Taylor and Ryan Hewitt
saw a ton of action in both seasons
while defensive players like Trent
Murphy, Henry Anderson and Ed
Reynolds possessed the talent all
along, but just needed more playing
time to showcase their skills.
But I do think the Rose Bowl team
is the most complete team among the
three. Sure, this year's offense wasn't
nearly efficient as it was with Luck at
the helm, but the sheer dominance on
defense and improved consistency on
special teams gives it a slight edge. It's
well-documented that this year's
defensive unit has punished speedy
limning backs like Kenjon Barner,
frustrated playmaking wide receivers
like Keenan Allen and terrorized elite
(or so-called elite) quarterbacks like
Matt Barkley.
The only thing spoils writers love
more than making comparisons is
pitching hypothetical. So, would the
Rose Bowl team defeat last year's
Fiesta Bowl team or the Orange Bowl
team two seasons ago? Part of me
thinks that behind one of the greatest
offensive lines in school history, Luck
would have found away to beat this
year's exceptional defensive unit. But
then again, this year's squad made a
name for itself by proving people
wrong.

Either way, it's incredible that
three of the best Stanford teams of all
time have come from the past three
years. And the best part of this debate
is that next year's team will have the
chance to end the discussion for good
by bringing the national cham
pionship trophy to the Fhrm.
