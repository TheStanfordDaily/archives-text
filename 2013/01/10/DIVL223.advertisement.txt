For a hundred years or more, Jewish education has been motivated by a fear
of assimilation. But what does "assimilation" really mean, and why is it so
scary? In this talk, we will re-examine some of the assumptions underlying
the fear of assimilation in order to develop a new way of thinking about the
purposes of Jewish education - a Jewish education that will serve the needs
and purposes of the Jewish community for the 21st century.
