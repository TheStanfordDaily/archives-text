## Card halts two-game losing skid 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford won its first Pac-12
game of the season and ended a
two-game losing streak in the
process by defeating Washington
State (9-2, 0-2 Pac 12) 78-67 on
Wednesday night at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford (10-6, 1-2) won
its conference opener for the fourth
year in a row and improved to 8-1 at
home this season.

A 14-point Cardinal run late in
the second half made the difference
in the game, as Stanford turned a
57-54 deficit into a 67-57 lead with
two minutes left in the game.
"I think we just played off each
other's energy," said Dwight
Powell, who finished the game with
16 points, 11 rebounds, four blocks
and three assists. "A great crowd
was here, and we made as many
stops as we could in a row. Guys
were hitting shots."
The Cardinal had its best all
around shooting night of the sea
son, going 24-of-26 from the free
throw line, including making its
first 24 free throws before Andy
Brown missed two in garbage time.
The squad was also a season high 8-
of-12 from three-point range and
23-of-44 from the field.
"Well, it was good to see the ball
go in," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "Guys did a really good
job tonight of moving the basket
ball, keeping good spacing and
shooting the basketball, and that
was a good thing for us."
Aaron Bright had a season high
21 points in what Dawkins called a
breakout game for him. He made

all eight of his free throws to go
along with 3-of-4 shooting from
behind the arc. The junior guard
had been averaging under 10 points
per game and was shooting .265
from downtown coming into the
game.
Chasson Randle, who in the pre
vious two games had some of his
worst performances of the year,

stepped up as well with 16 points on
5-of-8 shooting.
"We were kind of just freelanc
ing. Chasson and I were just trying
to create plays out there as opposed
to coming down and dumping it in,
standing and watching Dwight or
Josh go," said Bright.
In the first half, the offenses
looked stale and both teams strug

gled to create plays in their half
court offense. Stanford led 27-23 at
halftime while limiting Washington
State's leading scorer Brock
Motum to eight points on 3-of-10
shooting.
Motum began the second half by

Finishing with a game-high 29 points, he
scored 21 points in the second half, including a

Stanford's balanced scoring against
Washington State's Pac-12 leading defense
kept the game close until they could pull away
during the 14-0 run. The run started with a

momentum-changing put-back dunk by
Powell, who crashed in from the perimeter and
soared over three players for the jam.
"[Dwight] was terrific," commented
Dawkins. "As we talked about him in the lock-

er room, he was a man tonight."
