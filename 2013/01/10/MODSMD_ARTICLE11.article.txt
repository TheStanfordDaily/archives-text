# Q&A Bret BAUMBACH
## 
### 
Senior Bret Baumbach grew up in the
heart of Big 10 country. A native of
Council Bluffs, lowa, Baumbach was a
four-time district champion, and his 189
total wins are the sixth most in state his
tory.
After earning the stalling spot for the Cardinal
at 141 pounds his freshman year, Baumbach is in his
second season starting for Stanford at 165 pounds
and earned two victories at last weekend's dual
meet. He sat down with The Daily to talk about his
experiences on and off the mat.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What happened out
there at the dual meet this weekend? How were you
so successful?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): Alot of it was I knew
what I had to do. Sometimes when a team is strug
gling, you just have to step in and be the person who
leads by example. To go out there and get it done is
one of the best ways you can show a bunch of young

kids how to take care of business. I don't like to real
ly change much from match to match, so it's not like
I really did anything differently specifically for
those duals. Because we were losing by so much, I
didn't even know the team score. I just approach
every match like it's the national championship and
keep all the distractions out and focus on one thing
at a time.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You have a young team
this season without all that much experience. As a
senior, what is your take on being a leader? Is that
a natural position for you?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach) .i've kind of grown
into a leadership role. There are not that many
older kids on the team, so I've stepped in there and
accepted the role. I have been there before I do
know what it takes and what all the other guys have
gone through before. I've seen what it takes to
become a champion. And because I've seen that, I
have a responsibility to lead the rest of the young

guys who were not here.
When you're away from home —when you're at
Stanford—it's a lot different than a state school. A
lot of the good wrestling programs are at state
schools where kids aren't too far from home usually
and can go home a lot. And school isn't as stressful
as it is here. Here, at least when I was a freshman,
I always had [three-time All-American] Nick
Amuchastegui as an emotional crutch to get me
through the tough times. Everyone's staying up
super late doing homework, and then we're getting
up at 545 to do homework, going to school all day
and then repeating it.
And they're not easy workouts —you're going
in and getting your teeth kicked in. A lot of it is an
emotional toll. You get so used to going in at the high
school level and kicking everyone's butt. School's
challenging, being away from home isn't easy and
wrestling's challenging. And on top of that, you
don't have that same support system. Being the


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
older guy I know how tough it is, so I'm there to
remind them and be a crutch for them when they
need the support.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What made you
pick Stanford, which is so far away from home?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): Well, it's kind of a
crazy story. I was a week away from signing with
Nebraska. Then I came on my recruiting trip
here, and I didn't know much about Stanford
before that. Basically, I just fell in love with the
school —there wasn't anything I didn't like
about it. I threw all the other offers away to come
here. The coaching philosophy of Jason Borrelli,
his whole take on taking this team that was 50th
in the country before and, by my sophomore
year, was 11th in the country I definitely bought
into his coaching. To be part of a team that was
nothing and a top-15 program at the end of the
year was alluring, not just jumping on a team
that's already established.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What are your aspi
rations for this season?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): This year, the goal
is to win a national championship. There's no rea
son to train unless you're going to train to be the
best. I'm going to come back next year
[Baumbach redshirted his sophomore season], I
love this team, and I love the school, and you're
just not going to get this experience anywhere
else. Even though it is a grind, it's definitely
going to pay off.
And like you've pointed out, the team is
young, but we don't like to make excuses. Tou see
young kids all over the country doing well. We're
aiming to win Pac-12s. We need to step up at the
right time at the end of the year, but if we step
up, we can come home with a trophy in March.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What is your
favorite thing about being on the Farm?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): The greatest
thing would have to be the big array of people
that you meet and the high-caliber type of peo
ple. Tou're grinding with some of the best ath
letes in the same weight room as you. You see
them going as hard they can, and you're going as
hard as you can. You go from this great athletic
atmosphere, and then you go have breakfast,

and you go to John Taylor's econ class, where
there are economic rules with his last name in
them. You're always being exposed to the best of
the best. And everyone has the mentality of just
giving your best at all times in every aspect.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Where's your go-to
study spot?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): Third floor of
Huang. It's just really cool, like a space ship.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): OK, if you were
going to meet anyone who's ever walked this
campus, who would it be?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): The dudes that
started Google. Tell them I'd like to have a pool
patty [laughing].
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Not that many peo
ple have been to that many wrestling matches.
What's something they wouldn't be able to
understand without doing it themselves?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): The rush you get
when you win. It is mano y mono. You versus
him. When you win, you know whatever you put
in, you got out. It's a totally different feeling than
winning in a team sport. Its like a drug; you get
addicted.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): And last but not
least, every wrestler has to have a signature
move. What's yours?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): The pin. Because
the match gets so much easier when you do that
one.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Awesome. Thanks
so much Bret.
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): Thank you.

The team is
young, but we
don't like to
make excuses.
