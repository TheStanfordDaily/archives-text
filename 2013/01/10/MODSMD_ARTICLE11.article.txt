# Q&A Bret BAUMBACH
## 
### 
Senior Bret Baumbach grew up in the
heart of Big 10 country. A native of
Council Bluffs, lowa, Baumbach was a
four-time district champion, and his 189
total wins are the sixth most in state his
tory.
After earning the stalling spot for the Cardinal
at 141 pounds his freshman year, Baumbach is in his
second season starting for Stanford at 165 pounds
and earned two victories at last weekend's dual
meet. He sat down with The Daily to talk about his
experiences on and off the mat.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What happened out
there at the dual meet this weekend? How were you
so successful?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach): Alot of it was I knew
what I had to do. Sometimes when a team is strug
gling, you just have to step in and be the person who
leads by example. To go out there and get it done is
one of the best ways you can show a bunch of young

kids how to take care of business. I don't like to real
ly change much from match to match, so it's not like
I really did anything differently specifically for
those duals. Because we were losing by so much, I
didn't even know the team score. I just approach
every match like it's the national championship and
keep all the distractions out and focus on one thing
at a time.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You have a young team
this season without all that much experience. As a
senior, what is your take on being a leader? Is that
a natural position for you?
Bret Baumbach (Baumbach) .i've kind of grown
into a leadership role. There are not that many
older kids on the team, so I've stepped in there and
accepted the role. I have been there before I do
know what it takes and what all the other guys have
gone through before. I've seen what it takes to
become a champion. And because I've seen that, I
have a responsibility to lead the rest of the young

guys who were not here.
When you're away from home —when you're at
Stanford—it's a lot different than a state school. A
lot of the good wrestling programs are at state
schools where kids aren't too far from home usually
and can go home a lot. And school isn't as stressful
as it is here. Here, at least when I was a freshman,
I always had [three-time All-American] Nick
Amuchastegui as an emotional crutch to get me
through the tough times. Everyone's staying up
super late doing homework, and then we're getting
up at 545 to do homework, going to school all day
and then repeating it.
And they're not easy workouts —you're going
in and getting your teeth kicked in. A lot of it is an
emotional toll. You get so used to going in at the high
school level and kicking everyone's butt. School's
challenging, being away from home isn't easy and
wrestling's challenging. And on top of that, you
don't have that same support system. Being the
