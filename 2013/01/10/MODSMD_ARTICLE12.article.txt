## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Practical Gun Control 
### Adam Johnson 
After the Newton shooting,
gun-rights advocates were
quick to point out that "guns
don't kill people, people kill people."
They are correct to an extent. A
gun is no more responsible in such
shootings than, say, an automobile is
responsible in drank driving fatali
ties; both are inanimate objects that,
when left unused or used in certain
contexts, do no damage to humans
at all.
But to say that "people kill peo
ple" is not entirely correct either.
Just as a drank individual without a
car will likely be of no harm to soci
ety, Adam Lanza with no guns prob
ably would have done little, if any,
serious damage. One might then say,
"people with guns kill people." This,
however, is overly broad. Just as
sober and licensed adults behind the
wheel of a car are not generally
viewed as threats, responsible and
mentally stable individuals who own
and operate guns are relatively
harmless. Of the millions of gun
owners in the United States, only a
small fraction uses their weapons to
injure or kill others.
Rather, the individuals who per
petuate illegitimate gun violence
tend to exhibit some combination of
the following characteristics: young
age, drug abuse, past criminal histo
ry, mental instability, radical ideolo
gies or use of psychiatric medica
tions. The most accurate phrase,
then, would be to say, "certain peo
ple with guns kill people."
This phrase immediately sug
gests two general solutions, neither
of which involves draconian restric
tions on firearm availability. The
first realm of solutions involves
reducing the number of "risky" indi
viduals. This may involve lessening
socioeconomic pressures, creating
more effective identifications of and
treatments for mental illness,
strengthening communities and (in
the future) genetic engineering.
Besides being controversial,
these solutions are generally com
plex. Is the diminished role of com
munities really a factor in producing
socially isolated individuals, for
instance, and if it is, how do we go
about remedying it? Or even if we
can properly diagnose and prescribe
effective drugs for mentally unsta
ble persons, how do we ensure that
said drugs are properly consumed?
There are no easy answers in this
realm. I personally think that the
increasing presence of technology in
everyday life is creating new psy
chological problems that we are not
prepared to deal with, but linking
that to seemingly senseless killings
proves futile â€”we can never get
inside the minds of these killers,
after all.
The second realm of solutions, on
the other hand, is relatively
straightforward: preventing certain
individuals from obtaining access to
guns. This realm involves concrete,
immediate reforms that can be
applied across a wide range of con
texts. One such reform is improving
the background check system.

It is no secret that in certain
states it is dangerously easy to obtain
a gun. The case of Seung-Hui Cho,
the Virginia Tech shooter, is telling.
In 2005 he was temporarily detained
in a psychiatric institution for being
"an imminent danger to himself or
others." And yet, in 2007, he passed a
federal background check (the

NICS) and was able to purchase two
handguns. As determined afterward,
there was a communication gap
between state and federal authori
ties. This, however, is no anomaly:
since 1993,19 states have submitted
fewer than 100 names to the NICS
regarding the disqualification of
those deemed "mental defectives."
And background checks are not
required for private sales, which
account for roughly 40 percent of
firearm purchases.
With so many recent mass shoot
ings, it is easy to be cynical about
the future of guns in the United
States. Some of my peers have gone
so far as to suggest that all firearms
be banned. This approach, however,
is too broad; to reiterate, the vast
majority of gun owners have no
intention of killing innocent people.
Just as we need not outlaw cars to
diminish drunk driving, we need not
prohibit gun ownership to reduce
the number of gun deaths. Instead,
we should focus on sensible solu
tions that prevent at-risk individuals
from possessing guns. My hope is
that such reforms will be imple
mented and will prove successful.
It is not wishful thinking. To
return to the case of drunk driving,
in 1982, drunk driving deaths
occurred at more than twice today's
rate. Since then, media coverage
and advertisement campaigns have
increased drastically, all states
changed the drinking age to 21 and
enacted zero tolerance laws, the
legal BAC limit was reduced to 0.08,
and more. And drunk driving may
soon be eliminated almost entirely
with breathalyzer technology inte
grated into ignition systems. This
does not take cars off the road, nor
does it prevent people from drink
ing. It prevents potentially danger
ous individuals from mixing with
potentially dangerous inanimate
objects. Such an approach is the
ideal way forward with gun control.
