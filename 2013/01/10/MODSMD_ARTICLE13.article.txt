# I WANT TO GO THERE
## Whippersnappers, curmudgeons and free speech 
### Annie Graham 
I have the right to express a lot of
things, and you can choose to
read them or not. But where
does Stanford University draw the
line on our right to free speech?
As a private institution, Stanford
University is not directly legally
bound to uphold the Constitution.
But the "Leonard Law" of
California requires that the protec
tions of the First Amendment be
extended to students when they are
on campus, just as they'd experi
ence off campus.
Still, the Foundation for
Individual Rights in Education
(FIRE) gives Stanford University
a relatively poor rating, due to poli
cies that encourage "administrative
abuse and arbitrary application"
effectively leading, so they say, to
the decline of free speech on this
campus.

Greg Lukianoff confirms this
point. A graduate of Stanford Law
School and president of FIRE, he
published a book last November
titled "Unlearning Liberty:
Campus Censorship and the End of
American Debate," in which he
argues that college campuses are
inhibiting free speech and silencing
unpopular views.

He contests that both left and
right politics are affected and cites
examples like the following: A stu
dent in Georgia was expelled for a
pro-environment collage he posted

on Facebook because it apparently
showed he was a clear and present
danger to campus. Further
research proved that the adminis
tration was trying to get rid of him
and his opinions that opposed the
construction of a new campus park
ing garage. Free speech laws may
be subverted to suit the desires of
the administration.
In another case, Yale students
were banned from putting the F.
Scott Fitzgerald quote "All
Harvard men are sissies" on a t
shirt because it was viewed as an
anti-gay slur, something the stu
dents asserted was not true.
Ostensibly, this is the case that
should put liberals up in arms.
One of Lukianoff's recurring
examples is the proliferation of
sanctioned "free speech zones" on
campuses; their existence implicitly
suggests that other zones of the
campus are not free. By the way,
Stanford's White Plaza is a "free
speech area," but you're supposed
to have prior approval from
Student Activities Leadership to
host events there. Is regulated free
speech possible?
Lukianoff's larger argument
under the auspices of defending
free speech seems at times to be a
lunge to preserve conservative val
ues, to preserve the right to cringe
worthy phrases that most deem
politically incorrect. Washington
Post columnist George Will recent
ly wrote, "Liberals are most con
centrated and untrammeled on
campuses, so look there for evi
dence of what, given the opportuni
ty, they would do to America."
And for a moment I thought,
"Grandpa, when did you start writ
ing a column?"
In case you haven't noticed, the
grumpy white guy brigade is pretty
worried about the trajectory of our
nation (I'm team grumpy queer
lady, in case you seek to generalize
me in a column, too). The argument
that liberal college educations are
ruining the country assumes that
the ideals we sustain here are
wrong ideals like having policies
against Acts of Intolerance or acts
that target people for reasons of

religion, sexual orientation or a
broad range of identities.
But, like my wise grandpa
always does, these guys have a
point.

George Will and Greg Lukianoff
are ultimately arguing against an
Orwellian existence in which stu
dents' actions and intents are cen
sored vigorously. They argue that
we won't be able to have intellectu
al debates if everyone's words are
intensely monitored and censored
and that such policies might be
applied arbitrarily.
This is the issue of free speech
that threatens silence for both
sides of the political spectrum. We'll
never know what we actually think
unless we're forced to defend it in
the face of an opposing intellectual
opinion. But people do some really
stupid and offensive things some
times, often steeped in a centuries
old understanding of the nation:
slavery, abuse of minority popula
tions, extremely anti-gay attitudes.
Stupid, off-the-cuff remarks can
sting like a heavyweight punch to
the heart, and deliberate actions
more so.
Are we to erase these instances
by legislation and restriction of
some kinds of speech? Steps like
naming Acts of Intolerance are a
good step, even if they have some
adverse consequences. As a gay
person, I know I'm the beneficiary
of a lot of activism that has led
directly to policies protecting me
and perhaps limiting the "free
speech" of others.
Free speech always struck me
as the ultimate way to stick it to the
man, a radical expression of sub
versive opinions. But when George
Will talks about it, free speech seems
like a sly defense of old and offensive
ideas in this country. With both fiery
young students and curmudgeonly
old guys pressing the right to free
speech and giving an end-of-days
narrative about the world without it,
the debate about free speech contin
ues from different sides.
