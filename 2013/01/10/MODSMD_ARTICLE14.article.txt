# Card back on track for indoor season
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Sandwiched between the grueling
mileage of cross country and the all-impor
tant outdoor season, the world of indoor
track is always an interesting amalgam of
elite athletes caught between steady produc
tion and the ever-present dream of victory.
It's a puzzle that new track and field coach
Chris Miltenberg has spent plenty of time
trying to solve.

"We'll definitely race a lot," Miltenberg
told GoStanford.com. "In our framework, we
want to make sure that everything we do is
geared toward running our very best at out
door track championship time. We'll certain
ly use indoors as a means for getting there."
But unlike some other college programs,
Miltenberg's goal is to build up for the out
door season by competing strongly indoors,
rather than holding back to prevent injury or
peaking at the wrong time.

"Our whole coaching staff is in agreement
that we can run really well indoors if we're
training properly with the big picture in
mind," Miltenberg said.

There's certainly no shortage of talent on
either the men's or women's side.
As the UW Indoor Preview meet is set to
kick off the indoor season Saturday in
Seattle, the No. 13 Stanford women could
accurately pronounce themselves as the West
Coast power for indoor track and field with
six conference titles in the past decade.
The task to repeat, however, might be a
little daunting at the moment, at least on
paper. Fellow MPSF teams Oregon (No. 3),
California (No. 9), Washington (No. 10) and
Arizona (No. 12) are all ranked ahead of the
Cardinal in the preseason polls.
But Miltenberg has reason to believe
Stanford shouldn't be counted out just yet.

Stanford returns 15 who have scored in
individual events at the MPSF champi
onships over the past three years, spread out
among 13 different events. In addition,
Stanford returns 76 of last year's 125 cham
pionship points, a figure that does not include
relays or standout freshmen distance run
ners Cami Chapus, Cayla Hatton and Amy
Weissenbach, who all had impressive debuts
for the Cardinal on the cross-country circuit.
The team has 16 individuals who have
cracked the Stanford indoor all-time Top 10,
including record-holders Kori Carter (60-
meter hurdles, 8.22) and Justine Fedronic
(800, 2:05.68), and 60 hurdles No. 2 Katie
Nelms (8.33). Carter is the defending MPSF
champion.

"We've got two of the best hurdlers in the
country," Miltenberg said. "And I think we
can have a great women's 4x4, which [sprints
coach] Jody Stewart and I are really excited
about. I think we can surprise a lot of the
perennial powers and be ready to run with
anybody at the NCAA meet."

The jumps are strong as well. Last year,
Stanford swept the top three places in the
triple jump to seize the MPSF meet lead.
Karynn Dunn has placed among the top
three in both events too, and Jordan
Merback was third in the triple.
At the 2012 NCAA indoors, Dunn went
21-0? on her final long jump of the prelimi
nary round after two fouls. It stood as her
only fair jump of the competition and placed
her fourth at nationals and No. 4 on the all
time indoor list.
Dunn is among six Stanford athletes with
NCAA indoor championship experience,
along with All-America distance runner
Kathy Kroger (sixth in the NCAA 3,000 last
year). The others are senior Justine Fedronic
(800, 2:05.68), sophomore Aisling Cuffe
(3,000, distance medley relay), Joy O'Hare
(DMR) and Carissa Levingston (60, 200).
The No. 15 men, coming off a runner-up
finish in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation, are no slouches either.
They return 37 points from last season's
MPSF meet and have scorers back in eight
events, including the mile where Tyler
Stutzman and Michael Atchoo were third and
fourth last season and Andrew Berberick and
Dylan Ferris were second and fourth in 2011.
Ferris is the team's lone returning indoor
All-American, having placed eighth at the
2010 NCAA meet. He and Atchoo have bro
ken the four-minute barrier indoors. Ferris is
No. 6 on Stanford's all-time indoor mile list at
3:58.90 and Atchoo is No. 11 at 3:59.92.
The two join Luke Lefebure (DMR) and
Jules Sharpe (high jump) as Cardinal men
with NCAA indoor experience.
With Sharpe and Dartis Willis 11, high
jump is the area of strength. Sharpe has fin
ished among the MPSF top six in each of his
three seasons, including runner-up last year,
and is No. 2 in the Stanford indoor record
books at 7-3, with Willis tied for No. 5 at 6-
11?.
Geoffrey Tabor, No. 3 on the Stanford's
all-time indoor list in the shot put (58-7 ?),
joins Jeremy Hines (No. 5 at 57-4?) among
conference contenders.
The anticipated collegiate debut of fresh
man Steven Solomon, a 2012 Olympic finalist
in the 400, is expected to occur at the New
Balance Collegiate Invitational in New York
on Feb. 1-2. Solomon is a two-time Australian
champion with a best of 44.97, which he ran in
the Olympic semifinals. The Stanford out
door record, held since 1994 by Rene
Rodriguez, is 45.85.
"We're excited about him," Miltenberg
said. "We'll see what he can do on the nation
al level. With Steven, we're using him indoors
to get him ready to run really well outdoors
and into the summer at the World
Championships as well."
