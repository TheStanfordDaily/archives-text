# Three Strikes Project shifts focus
## 
### MARIANNE LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even before California voters weighed in on
Proposition 36 a ballot measure that revises
the state's three strikes law â€”the Stanford
Law School's Three Strikes Project began
working with clients who would be able to apply
for re-sentencing hearings if the November
measure passed.
Co-authored by Three Strikes Project
Director Michael Romano and the NAACP legal
defense fund, the proposition modified a section
of the California three strikes law, which former
ly required that an individual who had been con
victed twice of any serious or violent felony

would receive a life sentence if convicted of any
third felony.

The Stanford Law School Three Strikes
Project has represented individuals who were
serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes
under the law since 1996. Under Proposition 36,
however, the three strikes law now imposes a life
sentence only when the third felony conviction is
a "serious or violent crime." The measure also
allows offenders to petition for a re-sentencing if
their third strike conviction was not serious or
violent.

According to Ashley Davis, a third-year law
student involved with the Three Strikes Project,
the work surrounding those petitions has been
underway since before the November election.

"We were operating with cautious optimism
from late September," Davis said. "So that was a
new experience to me as well, dealing with man
aging client expectations. You have this person,
and you're telling this guy that we really think
the proposition is going to pass.Jbut] there was
always that possibility it wouldn't pass."
The optimism ended up well placed.
California voters passed Proposition 36 on Nov.
7 by a margin of 68.6 percent to 31.4 percent.
"We think this is a great start for justice
reform, and we're really pleased with the way
it's been moving forward," said Susan
Champion J.D. 'll, a fellow at the Three Strikes
Project.
According to the Three Strikes Project web

site, "over 4,000 inmates in California are serv
ing life sentences under the Three Strikes law
for nonviolent crimes." Champion said that if an
individual committed two serious or violent
felonies in the 1980s, within a short period of
time, and then committed a nonviolent crime a
decade later, he or she would receive a life sen
tence.

"They thought they would be locking up
murderers and rapists and serious, scary crimi
nals," said Emily Galvin J.D. 'lO, also a fellow at
the Three Strikes Project. "What actually hap
pened is... it disproportionately locked up a lot
of older people, not necessari
ly elderly people, but people
who, one, are not necessarily
committing very serious
crimes at the time of their life
sentence and, two, were get
ting more advanced in age."
In addition to represent
ing 12 clients who are current
ly serving life sentences for
nonviolent crimes, the Three
Strikes Project is also helping
to coordinate communication
between public defenders'
offices across California dis
tricts.
"The new law has given
about 3,000 people the right to
bring these petitions to
court," Galvin said. "[District]
public defenders' offices have
fabulously stepped forward
and offered to take these
cases.
"We've also been helping
coordinate between these
