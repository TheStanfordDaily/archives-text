## New shuttle service triples student users 741 students used revamped ASSU shuttle service program 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A reformed ASSU shuttle service
program aimed at students travelling
home for winter break witnessed a
surge in popularity in its first quarter of
usage, assisting nearly three times the
number of students as previous shuttle
efforts.
This year was the first the program
used Ride Grouped, a student-run start
up that aims to pair students travelling
to the same destination at similar times
through an online booking system. The
service, intended to increase student
accessibility at reduced costs, was used
by 741 students during the 2012-13 win
ter break, compared to the approximate
ly 250 students served during the previ
ous winter break.
"I think we did really well," said Jai
Sajnani 'l5, RideGrouped's cofounder.
"It's a sizable jump."
Though the significant increase in
usage may have exceeded
RideGrouped's initial expectations,
Sajnani downplayed any adverse conse
quences of the program's increased pop
ularity.
"We have very, very few problems
[for] the amount of kids transported,"
Sajnani said. "We only had problems
with one shuttle... So overall, it went off
pretty well."
While expressing satisfaction with
RideGrouped's performance, Sajnani
acknowledged the potential for further
refinement of the program, including
working on shuttle timing and develop
ing a service to return students to cam
pus from local airports.
"If we can get something for the
return trip, I think that'd be amazing,"
Sajnani said.
Efforts to provide such a service may
be complicated, however, by the fact that
students fly in from a wide range of loca
tions.
