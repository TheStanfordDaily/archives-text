## New shuttle service triples student users 741 students used revamped ASSU shuttle service program 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A reformed ASSU shuttle service
program aimed at students travelling
home for winter break witnessed a
surge in popularity in its first quarter of
usage, assisting nearly three times the
number of students as previous shuttle
efforts.
This year was the first the program
used Ride Grouped, a student-run start
up that aims to pair students travelling
to the same destination at similar times
through an online booking system. The
service, intended to increase student
accessibility at reduced costs, was used
by 741 students during the 2012-13 win
ter break, compared to the approximate
ly 250 students served during the previ
ous winter break.
"I think we did really well," said Jai
Sajnani 'l5, RideGrouped's cofounder.
"It's a sizable jump."
Though the significant increase in
usage may have exceeded
RideGrouped's initial expectations,
Sajnani downplayed any adverse conse
quences of the program's increased pop
ularity.
"We have very, very few problems
[for] the amount of kids transported,"
Sajnani said. "We only had problems
with one shuttle... So overall, it went off
pretty well."
While expressing satisfaction with
RideGrouped's performance, Sajnani
acknowledged the potential for further
refinement of the program, including
working on shuttle timing and develop
ing a service to return students to cam
pus from local airports.
"If we can get something for the
return trip, I think that'd be amazing,"
Sajnani said.
Efforts to provide such a service may
be complicated, however, by the fact that
students fly in from a wide range of loca
tions.
"Coming back, you have to
deal with flight delays, [can
celled flights], more problems
on the airline end and also the
problems of the size of the air
port and having multiple pick
up locations," Sajnani said.
While he has yet to speak
with either the ASSU or
University administrators with

regards to RideGrouped's
future on campus, Sajnani
expressed optimism about
the service's future and
potential for expansion.
"Hopefully we can get to
that soon," he said. "We want
to launch every time a large
amount of students are travel
ling home. If we can work out
a service for spring break and
the summer holiday, that's
what we'd like to do."

With the passage of
Proposition 36, the long-term
future of the Three Strikes
Project remains uncertain.
Galvin indicated that public
defense lawyers and their
clients have yet to see how the
courts will decide the petition
cases.
"You're catching us at a piv
otal time," Galvin said. "We
still have these 12 clients we
really need to help; we still
have to file petitions. We're not
standing at the edge of the cliff]
but we've just jumped off."
Davis expressed a similar
sentiment.
'As a law student interest
ed in public interest work,
probably the greatest
moment you can ever have is
working on a project to the
point where that work isn't
needed anymore," she said.
"In away that's what we've
done with the Three Strikes
Project... What I would like to
see is for the program to con
tinue to evolve and meet the
needs of people whose lives
are affected by this law."
