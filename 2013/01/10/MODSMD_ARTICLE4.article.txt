## STUDENT LIFE Row houses to get ID scanners at $5.5 mil. cost

Access Control Enterprise System (ACES)
card readers will soon be installed on Row hous
es, according to a joint statement to The Daily
from the offices of Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing, and Jay Kohn,
director of card services for Information
Technology Services (ITS).
ITS card services and Residential & Dining
(R&DE) Student Housing declined to give the
total cost of the project, stating that "the costs of
the implementation in R&DE Student Housing
are part of the global university initiative."
According to the IT Services website, the cost of

equipping the row will be $5.5 million dollars,
with $2.5 million coming from the R&DE budg
et.
Houses in the Cowell Cluster are currently
being surveyed in advance of the installation.
The majority of "large residences" are
already equipped with the card readers, which
are being installed on all undergraduate resi
dences and all graduate residences that have
interior hallways. The large residences that do
not have ACES card readers "will receive these
modifications when fully renovated via the capi
tal program in the near future," according to the
press release.
The card readers installed at Columbae,
Durand, 717 Dolores, Kappa Sigma, Theta Delta

Chi and 680 Lomita were not installed as paid of
the ACES project and will be replaced by card
readers to be installed under ACES, according
to the statement.
The readers will be installed on Row houses
in small groups, with the schedule to be deter
mined after installations have taken place on five
houses, according to the statement. Installations
will take anywhere from a few weeks to a month
or more, depending on the complexity of the
project. The installation process will be followed
by a one-week pilot period during which resi
dents can scan then- ID for entry but before the
key locks have been removed.
