## Flipped classroom gaining popularity among profs. 
### DANNY GIFFORD 
An increasing number of pro
fessors, tired of giving the same
lectures year after year, have
decided to abandon the tradition
al classroom model in favor of a
new, "flipped classroom"
approach.
Rather than presenting the
core curriculum in lecture, profes
sors of flipped classes record
short videos of themselves, often
embedded with diagnostic
quizzes, which allow students to
learn the basic material outside of
class time. Professors are then
free to fill class time with a vari
ety of activities, ranging from col
laborative group work to guest

speakers from industry.
Computer Science
Department Chair Jennifer
Widom, whose Introduction to
Databases course was one of the
original three flipped classes in
the fall of 2011, said the change
provided her a welcome opportu
nity to change her teaching style.
"I had been teaching the class,
I don't know, 15 times or some
thing, and I thought it would be
fun to try something different,"
she said. "I was convinced that
standing in front of the class and
giving the same lectures for the
16th time wasn't that interesting
to me, and so I wanted to try
something new."
Though only three flipped class
es were offered when Widom
helped pioneer the new model, its
popularity has since grown expo
nentially. According to Jane
Manning, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning's man
ager of online course production
and platforms, the office received
40 applications for grants to sup
port flipped classes, 17 of which
were funded in part or in full.
Manning said that as interest
has increased, she has seen a paral
lel rise in enthusiasm among the
faculty.
"Because of this new phenome
non, there's been a resurgence in
excitement about teaching," she
said. "There's something different
we can do with it, and people are
excited about that... and that
seems pretty cool."
The new system is not just
meant to benefit professors.
According to Widom, students'
experiences have improved with
the flipped model as well.
"[The flipped class] is definitely
a preferable way to teach it, and

everybody agrees," she said. "Last
year I had 140 studentsrrrand I
think I had two students who
expressed that they would have
preferred the old way."
But according to Associate
Professor of Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering Philip
Levis, who started teaching
Introduction to Computer
Networking as a flipped class this
fall, not every large lecture would
be better served by switching to
the new system.
"For this particular class, and
for my particular style, I feel like
the flipped classroom is a better
model," he said. "But I don't think
it's always a better model. There
are some people who are really
engaging and fantastic
lecturersTrrfolks like [computer sci
ence professor] Mehran Sahami. It
would be really terrible if he were
not giving his lectures."
Sahami teaches the popular
introductory computer science
class CSIO6A.
Though most flipped classes are
only in their first year, many pro
fessors have had their lectures
filmed and posted online for years
by the Stanford Center for
Professional Development (SCPD),
which allows non-Stanford stu
dents to access and learn from
Stanford lecturers.

The unintended side effect of
SCPD posting classes online, how
ever, is that once a lecture goes
online, attendance from Stanford
students drops drastically.
"It is very common, if your lec
ture is recorded by SCPD, to have
your class attendance to go down to
20 or 30 percent," Widom said.
"Pretty much everybody experi
ences that whose lectures are
recorded."
Levis agreed, and said that the
low attendance in SCPD classes
was "one of the things that prompt
ed people to start exploring"
flipped classrooms, which require
attendance in class for discussion
and questions.
"If 80 percent are watching the
videos [instead of attending lec
ture], maybe we can make better
videos than somebody talking in
front of a class for 75 minutes," he
said. "That's what sort of prompted
this whole shift."
The videos that flipped class
room students are required to
watch are typically much shorter
than a lecture ranging from
about three to 25 minutes since
the professor doesn't have to stop
for questions and knows that stu
dents can rewind and review the
material.
Engineering professor Bruce
Clemons said that these videos

allow students of different knowl
edge and ability to access the same
material.
"[Students] can look at [the
videos] while watching reruns of
'The Andy Griffith Show' if they
know this stuff already, or watch
them and rewind them many times
over," he said at the Oct. 25 meet
ing of the Faculty Senate.
But Jose Pons Vega 'l4, a stu
dent in Levis' computer network
ing course, said that there are
drawbacks to learning the material
through videos.
"It's very convenient that you
can go back and look at what you
just saw and look at the material
again, but also it's troublesome
because [videos] don't have any
feedback," he said. "Sometimes
they may go over a certain portion
of the material that's pretty diffi
cult, and [the video] may spend a
couple seconds on it. It's hard to
tell them to elaborate more when
you're not there—raising your hand
and asking questions."
The flipped classes are not
designed only for Stanford stu
dents. Videos for flipped classes
are sometimes made to be massive
open online courses posted to plat
forms Coursera or Class2Go, allow
ing students worldwide to take the
class. Widom's databases course,
for example, was hugely popular on

Coursera: More than 25,000 stu
dents submitted work for the class,
and 6,000 did enough to receive
"statements of accomplishment."
Students and teachers agree
that the flipped classroom environ
ment has changed classroom
dynamics for the better.
Levis, who has been able to use
class time to host weekly guest lec
turers thanks to time freed up by
flipping his class, has brought in
experts like Amin Vahdat, the man
responsible for building Google's
network infrastructure, and Vint
Cerf, referred to as the "grandfa
ther of the Internet."
"[Having speakers] is very
interesting, because the material
gets directly applied to a real-world
problem, which is something every
body enjoys," Vega said. "Nobody
likes doing work that's just school
work."
According to Clemons, the
flipped classroom has allowed him
not just to improve the quality of
his class, but also to connect more
personally with his students.
"I think I'm getting to know the
students better than if I stand up
there and lecture and say, 'Are
there any questions? ... Anybody,
anvhnrlv? Rnpllpr?'" hp saiH

filmed and posted online for years
by the Stanford Center for
Professional Development (SCPD),
which allows non-Stanford stu
dents to access and learn from
Stanford lecturers.

The unintended side effect of
SCPD posting classes online, how
ever, is that once a lecture goes
online, attendance from Stanford
students drops drastically.
"It is very common, if your lec
ture is recorded by SCPD, to have
your class attendance to go down to
20 or 30 percent," Widom said.
"Pretty much everybody experi
ences that whose lectures are
recorded."
Levis agreed, and said that the
low attendance in SCPD classes
was "one of the things that prompt
ed people to start exploring"
flipped classrooms, which require
attendance in class for discussion
and questions.
"If 80 percent are watching the
videos [instead of attending lec
ture], maybe we can make better
videos than somebody talking in
front of a class for 75 minutes," he
said. "That's what sort of prompted
this whole shift."
The videos that flipped class
room students are required to
watch are typically much shorter
than a lecture ranging from
about three to 25 minutes since
the professor doesn't have to stop
for questions and knows that stu
dents can rewind and review the
material.
Engineering professor Bruce
Clemons said that these videos

allow students of different knowl
edge and ability to access the same
material.
"[Students] can look at [the
videos] while watching reruns of
'The Andy Griffith Show' if they
know this stuff already, or watch
them and rewind them many times
over," he said at the Oct. 25 meet
ing of the Faculty Senate.
But Jose Pons Vega 'l4, a stu
dent in Levis' computer network
ing course, said that there are
drawbacks to learning the material
through videos.
"It's very convenient that you
can go back and look at what you
just saw and look at the material
again, but also it's troublesome
because [videos] don't have any
feedback," he said. "Sometimes
they may go over a certain portion
of the material that's pretty diffi
cult, and [the video] may spend a
couple seconds on it. It's hard to
tell them to elaborate more when
you're not there—raising your hand
and asking questions."
The flipped classes are not
designed only for Stanford stu
dents. Videos for flipped classes
are sometimes made to be massive
open online courses posted to plat
forms Coursera or Class2Go, allow
ing students worldwide to take the
class. Widom's databases course,
for example, was hugely popular on

Coursera: More than 25,000 stu
dents submitted work for the class,
and 6,000 did enough to receive
"statements of accomplishment."
Students and teachers agree
that the flipped classroom environ
ment has changed classroom
dynamics for the better.
Levis, who has been able to use
class time to host weekly guest lec
turers thanks to time freed up by
flipping his class, has brought in
experts like Amin Vahdat, the man
responsible for building Google's
network infrastructure, and Vint
Cerf, referred to as the "grandfa
ther of the Internet."
"[Having speakers] is very
interesting, because the material
gets directly applied to a real-world
problem, which is something every
body enjoys," Vega said. "Nobody
likes doing work that's just school
work."
According to Clemons, the
flipped classroom has allowed him
not just to improve the quality of
his class, but also to connect more
personally with his students.
"I think I'm getting to know the
students better than if I stand up
there and lecture and say, 'Are
there any questions? ... Anybody,
anvhnrlv? Rnpllpr?'" hp saiH

An increasing number of pro
fessors, tired of giving the same
lectures year after year, have
decided to abandon the tradition
al classroom model in favor of a
new, "flipped classroom"
approach.
Rather than presenting the
core curriculum in lecture, profes
sors of flipped classes record
short videos of themselves, often
embedded with diagnostic
quizzes, which allow students to
learn the basic material outside of
class time. Professors are then
free to fill class time with a vari
ety of activities, ranging from col
laborative group work to guest

speakers from industry.
Computer Science
Department Chair Jennifer
Widom, whose Introduction to
Databases course was one of the
original three flipped classes in
the fall of 2011, said the change
provided her a welcome opportu
nity to change her teaching style.
"I had been teaching the class,
I don't know, 15 times or some
thing, and I thought it would be
fun to try something different,"
she said. "I was convinced that
standing in front of the class and
giving the same lectures for the
16th time wasn't that interesting
to me, and so I wanted to try
something new."
Though only three flipped class
es were offered when Widom
helped pioneer the new model, its
popularity has since grown expo
nentially. According to Jane
Manning, the Office of the Vice
Provost for Online Learning's man
ager of online course production
and platforms, the office received
40 applications for grants to sup
port flipped classes, 17 of which
were funded in part or in full.
Manning said that as interest
has increased, she has seen a paral
lel rise in enthusiasm among the
faculty.
"Because of this new phenome
non, there's been a resurgence in
excitement about teaching," she
said. "There's something different
we can do with it, and people are
excited about that... and that
seems pretty cool."
The new system is not just
meant to benefit professors.
According to Widom, students'
experiences have improved with
the flipped model as well.
"[The flipped class] is definitely
a preferable way to teach it, and

everybody agrees," she said. "Last
year I had 140 studentsrrrand I
think I had two students who
expressed that they would have
preferred the old way."
But according to Associate
Professor of Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering Philip
Levis, who started teaching
Introduction to Computer
Networking as a flipped class this
fall, not every large lecture would
be better served by switching to
the new system.
"For this particular class, and
for my particular style, I feel like
the flipped classroom is a better
model," he said. "But I don't think
it's always a better model. There
are some people who are really
engaging and fantastic
lecturersTrrfolks like [computer sci
ence professor] Mehran Sahami. It
would be really terrible if he were
not giving his lectures."
Sahami teaches the popular
introductory computer science
class CSIO6A.
