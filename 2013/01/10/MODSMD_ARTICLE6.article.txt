## GSC approves ARP recommendations Bill will now move to the Board of Judicial Affairs 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted Wednesday to approve
recommendations for changes to
the Alternative Review Process
(ARP) for sexual assault cases. The
Undergraduate Senate approved
the same recommendations on
Riesday, meaning the bill will now
move to the Board of Judicial
Affairs (BJA).
The BJA will decide whether to
implement the suggested changes
and may present a modified version
of the ARP to the Faculty Senate in

March.
At the end of fall quarter, a sub
committee of four GSC members
held four joint meetings with a sub
committee of the Undergraduate
Senate to discuss the ARE The two
committees drafted identical rec
ommendations to submit to the
BJA.
"We definitely spent the time
and put the effort in and did our
best to think through all the issues,"
said ARP subcommittee member
Camille Fletcher J.D. 'l3. "I was
happy with our suggestions."
Although the Undergraduate
Senate and GSC will vote again on
the ARP in its entirety before it
is approved, the BJA is expect
ed to present a tentative plan of
modifications to the Faculty Senate
in March, according to Undergraduate

Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5. After
soliciting feedback from the Faculty
Senate, the BJA will send the ARP
back to the ASSU's legislative bod
ies for a vote.
Some of the significant changes
suggested in the Undergraduate
Senate and GSC's proposal include
the removal of a section that states
that past sexual history can be rele
vant if it is offered as evidence of
consent, the addition of a clause that
requires a review of the ARP if the
federal government's interpreta
tion of a sexual assault's standard of
proof changes and the addition of
another faculty or staff member to
the ARP panel.
The Chair read the proposed
changes to GSC members and
explained the implications of
these changes. At several
points, GSC members asked
ARP subcommittee members
for clarifications of state
ments and requested exam
ples of how proposed changes
would operate in a sexual
assault case.
The GSC's longest discus
sion centered on whether sex
ual history was relevant in
ARP cases. Members from
the GSC subcommittee noted
that this was a particularly
contentious issue during the
joint meeting with the
Undergraduate Senate and
said that the BJA will be dis
cussing it further.

"We fought really hard
over it," Fletcher said.
"There is some disagreement
over it, and the BJA is still
going to go back and look at
it."
Other main points dis
cussed were the preponder
ance of evidence standard of
proof and system of cross
examination.
All 10 voting members
present at the meeting
approved sending the
changes to the BJA. Five vot
ing members were absent,
including GSC Co-chairs
David Hsu, a doctoral student
in electrical engineering, and
Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3.
Sjoerd De Ridder Ph.D. 'l3
chaired the meeting in then'
absence.
