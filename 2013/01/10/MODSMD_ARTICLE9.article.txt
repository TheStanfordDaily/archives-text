## Hall of Fame or Hall of Lame? 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
I remember the first time I made
a pilgrimage to Cooperstown.
My grandmother and grandfa
ther lived in Rome, N.Y., which
is not too far from the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. My
dad being an avid baseball fan, I'm
betting he was dying to take us on
that first journey to see the red brick
buildings and quaint little shops that
sell ridiculously priced memorabilia
celebrating the giants of America's
pastime.
Or maybe it was my mother, who
despite not having all that much
interest in a game that takes three
hours to play, was the driving force
behind all the long hours spent toiling
on ball fields that defined in many
ways my siblings' and my childhood.
In any case, I remember the thrill
I had as a six-year-old boy walking
down the twin escalators to the rooms
that held the plaques. Ah, yes, the
faces of immortality. Ruth, Cobb,
Williams, DiMaggio. The list is long
208 former major league baseball
players and nearly 100-odd man
agers, umpires and pioneers in the
sport.
But I don't remember the bronze
faces hanging on the wall with tiny lit
tle descriptions of their fame as being
overwhelming. I remember it being
exactly as it should have been a
reaffirmation of those names I had
read about in books and watched on
highlight reels and heard interviews
with on the radio.
I have nowhere near the memo
ries that real old-timers have about
the "golden age" of baseball when the
game was only played during the day
and there was a real rivalry between
the American and National Leagues
and the World Series was about the
toughest ticket in town.
In part, I'm glad that I don't share
those memories because they also
include a good 60 years when black
players were banned and racism
raged within the clubhouses, front
offices and stadiums throughout the
country.
But another part of me is glad I
don't have to sit and complain about
how much integrity has been lost
from the game of baseball because
instead of pounding hot dogs and
beer before a game, some guys are
rubbing cream on their biceps.
Frankly, I am sick of the holier
than-though attitude that far too
many baseball sportswriters seem to
possess when it comes to their sport.
It's almost as bad as Notre Dame,
which says a lot because you can't get
much more holy than insisting
Touchdown Jesus is helping you win
football games.
When I was standing in that room
and looking up at Mays, McCovey
and Mantle, I did not especially care
how they got to where they got. I did
n't care how rude Ted Williams was to
the press or how Mickey Mantle got
in shape or anything other than these
men played the game of baseball like
few ever could.
Maybe I'm just ignorant or maybe
I just don't value integrity enough,
but yesterday's revelation that Barry
Bonds, Roger Clemens and all the
other supposed steroid users were
named on fewer than 40 percent of
the Hall of Fame ballots makes me
want to vomit.
And mostly it makes me want to
ask the voters, what is the price of
admission to the Hall of Fame?
Is it admitting that you've cheat
ed, that you took steroids and are
sorry? Is it denying that you ever
touched the stuff and pointing to all
the drug tests you've passed? Or is it
telling anyone who will listen that
everyone else was doing it and you
had to just to keep up, as well as
pointing to Major League Baseball's
tacit acceptance of a pervasive issue
in clubhouses around the country
that was earning them millions and
millions of dollars.
I can't stomach the idea that these
legends of the game are denied entry
because they were either really good
at cheating or really bad at hiding it.
Having talked to more than a handful
of minor league baseball players who
played in the '9os and failed to reach
stardom, I don't buy the idea that
only a select few guys were juicing
and the rest of the population was
clean.
Everyone was juicing, and most
weren't good enough players for it to
really matter. That's what I believe.
And I believe that if you are mad
at Barry Bonds for injecting himself
with "the clear," you should also be
mad at every pitcher he ever faced
who was also juiced. In short, you
should be mad at just about everyone.
You should also be mad at Bud
Selig, who stood by and let Major
League Baseball's profit margins
