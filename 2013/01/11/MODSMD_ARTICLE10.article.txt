## Stanford primed for 2013 title run 
### Sam Fisher 
Only nine days after
Stanford's magical
2012 football season
ended with a Rose
Bowl victory, it's time
to turn the page to 2013. Over the
next eight months, coaches, fans and
media alike will break down this
schedule head to toe, but here are the
first things that immediately jump off
the page.
Thursday Night Showdown For
The Ages:
Oregon comes down to the farm
for a Thursday night battle on Nov.
7, in a game that will most likely
decide the Pac-12 North Division
champion once again. Oregon State
and Washington could be factors,
but Stanford and Oregon will be
heavy favorites to not only win the
North Division, but also potentially
represent the Pac-12 in the BCS
National Championship Game.
The game is a chance for both
Stanford and Oregon to avenge bit
ter defeats last year. In Stanford's
last Thursday night game, the
Cardinal suffered a big letdown,
losing at Washington in front of a
raucous crowd. As for Oregon, the
home loss to Stanford kept the
Ducks out of the BCS National
Championship Game and based
on how Notre Dame looked, proba
bly cost the Ducks the title.
Back-loaded Schedule Again:
If you thought Stanford's 2012
schedule was back-loaded
Stanford finished with games
against Oregon State, Oregon and
UCLA just wait until 2013.
Stanford's last six games feature, in
order, vs. UCLA, at Oregon State,
vs. Oregon, at USC, vs. Cal and vs.
Notre Dame. To win the national
championship, Stanford could have
to go undefeated, and sweeping
that six game stretch won't
be easy.
The toughest part of that
six-game stretch looks to be
the first half. UCLA proved
to be a very talented football
team in the Pac-12
Championship Game and
returns quarterback Brett
Hundley on offense and star
linebacker Anthony Barr on
defense. Like UCLA,
Oregon State gave Stanford
a run for its money in Palo
Alto in 2012. In 2013, having
to travel to Corvallis will be
a tough test, as Beaver fans
can create a hostile environ
ment. And last is Oregon,
which should continue to be
the toughest test Stanford
faces each year.
Trap Games:
Stanford had two losses
in 2012: an overtime loss to
eventual national champion
runner-up Notre Dame and
a trap game loss at
Washington. The Notre
Dame loss is understand
able, but the Washington
loss was much harder to
understand. It was one of
those games that Andrew
Luck-led Stanford teams
never lost. In 2013, unfortu
nately for Stanford, a man
not named Andrew Luck will
again quarterback the Card.
Though Kevin Hogan has
shown flashes of greatness,
his streakiness makes me
worry about the potential of
a trap game knocking
Stanford off its path towards
Pasadena.
To some extent, every
road game in the Pac-12
well maybe just Pac-10 is
a bit of a trap game. I think
the first potential trap game
for Stanford could be its
road trip up to Pullman to
face Washington State on
September 28. Washington
State improved throughout
the season, and in Mike
Leach's second year, don't be
shocked if the Cougars pull
off a big upset against one of
the Pac-12's better teams.
The biggest trap game on
the schedule, however, is
Oregon State. Oregon State
has a similar amount of tal

ent to last year's Washington
team as well as a similar
football environment
though I'm not sure any sta
dium is truly as loud as
Century Link Field was on
that Thursday night last fall.
The biggest key to this being
a trap game, however, is that
it falls between UCLA and
Oregon, who I expect to be
Stanford's two toughest
home tests all season. If
Stanford's focus slips, the
Beavers could very well be
the team that takes down the
Cardinal.
Oddly enough, I think the
Oregon State game actually
becomes more dangerous
the worse that Oregon State
does early in the season. If
the Beavers are undefeated
and ranked highly, there's a
much smaller chance that
Stanford looks past them.
But, if Oregon State loses
two or three games early on
and falls out of the rankings,
it could become much
tougher for Stanford to
focus.
First prediction:
I know it's absurdly early
to throw out a prediction for
Stanford Football's season,
but it's just too much fun to
pass up. To be fair, I reserve
the right to change this
many times before
September rolls around,
depending on injuries,
recruiting and the occasional
crazy event.
This schedule is tough;
there's simply no other way
of putting it. The final six
games, plus the potential
Pac-12 Championship Game,
will be one of the most brutal
stretches any team will face
all year. However, this
Stanford team is literally
built to handle a stretch like
that.
The team and training

staff work tremendously
hard to stay healthy and in
shape, the team has shown
an ability to stay focused on
each game and the toughest
games Oregon, UCLA
and Notre Dame are at
home. Stanford also has a
few extra days of prepara
tion for Oregon, a gift that
Stanford has consistently
utilized better than almost
any team in the country.
This is going to be a spe
cial season. Chase Thomas
and Sam Schwartzstein
came back for 2012 to win a
Rose Bowl. Shayne Skov,
Trent Murphy and Ben
Gardner are coming back for
2013 to win a national cham
pionship. The 2014 BCS
National Championship
Game will be held at the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena
same venue, different date,
different trophy, same cham
pion. Let me be the first of
many to predict that
Stanford finishes at 14-0 as
BCS National Champions.
