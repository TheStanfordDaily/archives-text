# TIME FOR ROUND TWO
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
On Sunday, the Stanford
women's basketball team will face
off with rival Cal for the second
time in five days, another critical
conference match for both squads.
The Card (14-1, 3-0 Pac-12)
secured a narrow win over the
Golden Bears (12-2, 2-1) on
Tuesday, 62-53.
"I think it's easier to prepare
now because we are going over the
same stuff we went over on
Monday," said senior forward
Mikaela Ruef. "We know what we
need to work on because we literal
ly just played the game and it's
fresh in our minds. I think it can be
a challenge in that we did just play
them and beat them on their court,
so they're going to be extra angry
and come out with a fire. We just
need to make sure that we don't
relax just because we beat them."
With neither team particularly
satisfied with their level of play on
Tuesday, both squads are expected
to come out with a vengeance.
Stanford was outrebounded by 14,
the highest margin of the season,
and allowed many second chance
opportunities. Ruef (five points,
five rebounds), a big rebounder for
the Card, was benched throughout
the game due to early foul trouble,
and her defensive tenacity and
rebounding prowess was missed.
"We emphasized rebounding a
lot before the game anyways, but
they still came out and got 21
offensive rebounds, so it's some
thing that we need to work on,"
said Ruef. "We didn't realize how
badly they wanted the rebounds
and how much their offense
depends on [that]. So if we want to
stop them, we need to focus on box
ing everyone out on every shot and
then just not let them push us
under the basket."

Poor shooting by Cal's back
court, however, allowed the
Cardinal to pull ahead in the end to
seal the victory as Cal was held to
just 19-63 shooting from the field.
"We had a rough shooting

night," said Cal head coach
Lindsay Gottlieb. "You can't expect
to beat a team as good as Stanford
if you go 2 for 21 from 3.1 think we
really battled through that, espe
cially in the first half. In the second
half, ultimately it deflated us a lit
tle bit and allowed Stanford to get
better looks than we wanted them
to."
Both teams, however, demon
strated gritty, determined defense
throughout the game and are fig
ured to be much sharper the sec
ond time around after four days off
from competition.
"I think that both teams got a
little bit tired from the travelling

that we had," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "[On
Sunday] we hope that we rebound
better; we hope that we score bet
ter. We need more contributions
from more people, but if it's tied
with five minutes to go and we pull
ahead and win, I'll be happy."
Senior guard Layshia
Clarendon is expected to lead the
Bears once again after putting up
17 points in Tuesday's contest. The
team's season-leading scorer, soph
omore point guard Brittany Boyd,
fell short of her average 13.6 ppg
with only nine due to the dogged
defense of Stanford's sophomore
point guard Amber Orrange, who

contributed 15 points herself.
Junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike led all scorers with 26
points, along with three blocks and
three steals for the night. The
teamwork between Ogwumike and
Orrange will be instrumental in
pulling off another win over the
Bears.
Another factor in Sunday's
game will be the Card's perform
ance from behind the three-point
arc. Stanford went 0-8 Tuesday
the first time it has gone so ice cold
since playing Arizona State last
March.
"They [Cal] were up on people,"
said VanDerveer. "They were tak
ing away [the threes] so we went to
Chiney; we hit the pick and roll.
Amber shot really well. We didn't
particularly shoot well the whole
game. Our free throws were off. So
some days you just don't shoot that
well, but we have really good
shooters."
Sunday's matchup might well
come down to who can crash the
offensive boards. Stanford and Cal
are the sole, top contenders for the
Pac-12 title. Cal is looking to over
come the Stanford hurdle, and
Stanford wants to extend its win
streak against Cal to 11. The next
time they meet won't come again
until March in the Pac-12 tourna
ment.
"I'm going to look at it like we
lost the game," said VanDerveer.
"I'm looking at the things that we
could have done better and that
rules out any complacency. So I
look at it like we lost to Cal in my
mind because we didn't do a, b, c, d,
so now we want to fix that for the
next game, and we have to be hun
gry, and we have to be aggressive.
They are an excellent team, and
they have great players. They are
extremely athletic, they rebound
really well and they defend really
well, so it'll be a big win for us."

from more people, but if it's tied
with five minutes to go and we pull
ahead and win, I'll be happy."
Senior guard Layshia
Clarendon is expected to lead the
Bears once again after putting up
17 points in Tuesday's contest. The
team's season-leading scorer, soph
omore point guard Brittany Boyd,
fell short of her average 13.6 ppg
with only nine due to the dogged
defense of Stanford's sophomore
point guard Amber Orrange, who

contributed 15 points herself.
Junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike led all scorers with 26
points, along with three blocks and
three steals for the night. The
teamwork between Ogwumike and
Orrange will be instrumental in
pulling off another win over the
Bears.
Another factor in Sunday's
game will be the Card's perform
ance from behind the three-point
arc. Stanford went 0-8 Tuesday
the first time it has gone so ice cold
since playing Arizona State last
March.
"They [Cal] were up on people,"
said VanDerveer. "They were tak
ing away [the threes] so we went to
Chiney; we hit the pick and roll.
Amber shot really well. We didn't
particularly shoot well the whole
game. Our free throws were off. So
some days you just don't shoot that
well, but we have really good
shooters."
Sunday's matchup might well
come down to who can crash the
offensive boards. Stanford and Cal
are the sole, top contenders for the
Pac-12 title. Cal is looking to over
come the Stanford hurdle, and
Stanford wants to extend its win
streak against Cal to 11. The next
time they meet won't come again
until March in the Pac-12 tourna
ment.
"I'm going to look at it like we
lost the game," said VanDerveer.
"I'm looking at the things that we
could have done better and that
rules out any complacency. So I
look at it like we lost to Cal in my
mind because we didn't do a, b, c, d,
so now we want to fix that for the
next game, and we have to be hun
gry, and we have to be aggressive.
They are an excellent team, and
they have great players. They are
extremely athletic, they rebound
really well and they defend really
well, so it'll be a big win for us."
Round two of the Battle of the
Bay will tip at 1 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

The Cardinal was 0-8 from behind the three-point line in Tuesday's
win over rival California. Senior Joslyn Tinkle (44) aims to change that
as Stanford looks to beat the Bears again on Sunday at home.
On Sunday, the Stanford
women's basketball team will face
off with rival Cal for the second
time in five days, another critical
conference match for both squads.
The Card (14-1, 3-0 Pac-12)
secured a narrow win over the
Golden Bears (12-2, 2-1) on
Tuesday, 62-53.
"I think it's easier to prepare
now because we are going over the
same stuff we went over on
Monday," said senior forward
Mikaela Ruef. "We know what we
need to work on because we literal
ly just played the game and it's
fresh in our minds. I think it can be
a challenge in that we did just play
them and beat them on their court,
so they're going to be extra angry
and come out with a fire. We just
need to make sure that we don't
relax just because we beat them."
With neither team particularly
satisfied with their level of play on
Tuesday, both squads are expected
to come out with a vengeance.
Stanford was outrebounded by 14,
the highest margin of the season,
and allowed many second chance
opportunities. Ruef (five points,
five rebounds), a big rebounder for
the Card, was benched throughout
the game due to early foul trouble,
and her defensive tenacity and
rebounding prowess was missed.
"We emphasized rebounding a
lot before the game anyways, but
they still came out and got 21
offensive rebounds, so it's some
thing that we need to work on,"
said Ruef. "We didn't realize how
badly they wanted the rebounds
and how much their offense
depends on [that]. So if we want to
stop them, we need to focus on box
ing everyone out on every shot and
then just not let them push us
under the basket."

Poor shooting by Cal's back
court, however, allowed the
Cardinal to pull ahead in the end to
seal the victory as Cal was held to
just 19-63 shooting from the field.
"We had a rough shooting

night," said Cal head coach
Lindsay Gottlieb. "You can't expect
to beat a team as good as Stanford
if you go 2 for 21 from 3.1 think we
really battled through that, espe
cially in the first half. In the second
half, ultimately it deflated us a lit
tle bit and allowed Stanford to get
better looks than we wanted them
to."
Both teams, however, demon
strated gritty, determined defense
throughout the game and are fig
ured to be much sharper the sec
ond time around after four days off
from competition.
"I think that both teams got a
little bit tired from the travelling

that we had," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "[On
Sunday] we hope that we rebound
better; we hope that we score bet
ter. We need more contributions
from more people, but if it's tied
with five minutes to go and we pull
ahead and win, I'll be happy."
