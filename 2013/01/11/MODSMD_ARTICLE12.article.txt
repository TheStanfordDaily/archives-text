# WRESTLING
## On the road again 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling
team will head east this week
end in search of its first dual
meet victory in over a month.
On Saturday, the Cardinal (4-
6, 0-1 Pac-12) will match up
against Brown, Maryland and
Harvard in College Park, Md.
The team will then travel to
Washington, D.C. to take on
American on Sunday before
returning home.
This has been a trying sea
son for the program thus far.
On Jan. 6, just three Cardinal
wrestlers recorded victories
as Stanford lost all three
meets in the Stanford Duals
in Burnham Pavilion. Pac-12
rival Arizona State defeated
the Cardinal 30-7, while No.
20 Penn and Rutgers beat
Stanford 27-6 and 33-3
respectively. The Cardinal has
not won a dual meet since
Nov. 24 against South Dakota
State.
No. 23 Maryland will pro
vide the toughest test for
Stanford on Saturday. The
Teips are coming off a 22-15
loss to Bloomsburg last week
end, but are undefeated at
home this season and boast five
ranked wrestlers. Maryland is
led by 184-pound wrestler
Jimmy Sheptock, who has not
lost a dual meet matchup in his
career. The Cardinal is likely to
send out either freshman Ryan
Davies or junior Alan Yen to
try to handle the seventh
ranked Sheptock. In the 174-
pound class, Stanford fresh
man Tommy Kimbrell will take
on Terps senior Josh Asper,
who is currently ranked fifth
nationally.
Ivy League opponents
Brown and Harvard are only
just beginning their dual meet
seasons. Brown kicked off
their season with a victory
over Franklin and Marshall
on Dec. 8 but then took a 27-
day break before then- next
meets, which took place last
weekend. The Bears split two
competitions, defeating
Johnson & Wales before
falling to Rider. The 184-
pound weight class will again
be a tough spot for the
Cardinal, as Brown sopho
more Ophir Bernstein is cur

rently 3-0 at that position in
dual meets and 8-2 overall.

The competition may turn
on the 125-pound weight
class, where both likely
wrestlers won two matches
last weekend. Stanford red
shirt freshman Evan Silver
will look to continue his
breakout season against
Brown junior Vincent Moita.
Silver will face another
tough match later in the day
when he takes on Jeffrey Ott
of Harvard. The freshman
recorded a key victory to lead
the Crimson over Rider last
Satiu'day in Harvard's first
dual meet of the season.
The Crimson also boasts
two top-10 wrestlers in No. 9
Walter Peppelman and No. 10
Steven Keith. Peppelman, at
157 pounds, pinned his oppo
nent just 10 seconds into the
match last weekend. For the
Cardinal, junior Kyle Meyer
defaulted his last match due
to injury, forcing junior
Donovan Halpin to step up to
the 157-pound weight class.
This weekend, either Meyer
or senior Tommy Boone will
likely fill the 157-pound spot
for the Cardinal. Sophomore
Josh Lauderdale or freshman
Peter Russo will face Keith at

141 pounds.
Stanford junior Bret
Baumbach was one of the few
bright spots for the Cardinal
last weekend, as he recorded
two wins at the 165-pound
weight class. The junior will
look to improve upon his 11-8
record this weekend.
Despite the cross-country
travel, the Cardinal may have
an advantage in fitness enter
ing Saturday's meet. Both
Harvard and Brown are com
peting Friday night, while
Stanford doesn't start
wrestling until Saturday
morning.
However, that advantage
will fade when Stanford trav
els to face American on
Sunday, which is wrestling
Friday night but has Saturday
off. The Eagles are led by
redshirt freshman David
Terao, who is currently 15-1
at 125 pounds. American also
has solid wrestlers in heavy
weight Blake Herrin and 149-
pound Kevin Tao.
After the four-meet road
trip, the Cardinal will return
to Palo Alto for a home match
against Air Force on Jan. 18.

However, that advantage
will fade when Stanford trav
els to face American on
Sunday, which is wrestling
Friday night but has Saturday
off. The Eagles are led by
redshirt freshman David
Terao, who is currently 15-1
at 125 pounds. American also
has solid wrestlers in heavy
weight Blake Herrin and 149-
pound Kevin Tao.
After the four-meet road
trip, the Cardinal will return
to Palo Alto for a home match
against Air Force on Jan. 18.

While Stanford did not fare well at last weekend's dual
meet, the Cardinal is hoping to right the ship with matches
on Saturday against Brown, Maryland and Harvard.
