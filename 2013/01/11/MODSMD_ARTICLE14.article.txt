## The 						SNUBS and STARS of the ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS 
### Halle Edwards | STAFF WRITER 
Snubs, surprises and drama this year's
Oscar nominations have proven to be
much more exciting than usual.
The Best Picture category was, surpris
ingly, the most uncontroversial. Box-office
favorites "Les Miserables," "Life of Pi,"
"Lincoln" and ""Django Unchained"" all
scored nominations, as well as art house
favorite "Beasts of the Southern Wild."
Notably, a foreign film, "Amour," was also
picked, a rarity outside of the Best Foreign
Film category. "Argo," "Zero Dark Thirty" and
"Silver Linings Playbook" round out the list.
"Skyfall" is a notable overlook with mostly
glowing reviews and over one billion at the
box office this year, some thought it would be
the first Bond film to be nominated lor best
picture.
The biggest shocks came in the Best
Director category, with Kathryn Bigelow
("Zero Dark Thirty"), Tom Hooper ("Les
Miserables") and Ben Affleck ("Argo") all get
ting snubbed. The trio were the most buzzed
about directors prior to the nominations, and
were all nominated for Director's Guild
awards, usually a reliable predictor of Oscar
nominations. In their place, Ang Lee ("Life of
Pi"), Steven Spielberg ("Lincoln"), Michael
Haneke ("Amour"), Benh Zeitlin ("Beasts of
the Southern Wild") and David O. Russell
("Silver Linings Playbook") were nominated,

the biggest surprise being Russell "Silver
Linings" has been well-received, but Russell's
directing was less buzzed-about than Lee's,
Zeitlin's or even Tarantino's for "Django
Unchained".
The Best Actor category recognized some
of the year's most high-profile performances,
including Hugh Jackman in "Les Miserables"
and Daniel Day-Lewis in "Lincoln," along with
Joaquin Phoenix in "The Master" and Denzel
Washington in "Flight." Perhaps the biggest
surprise is Bradley Cooper ("Silver Linings
Playbook"), a former TV star who beat out
other big performances like John Hawkes's
("The Sessions").
The Best Actress nominations included
two of the year's most-talked about celebrities
Jessica Chastain ("Zero Dark Thirty") and
Jennifer Lawrence ("Silver Linings Playbook").
Three years ago they were relative unknowns,
but with a slew of high-profile movies in the
last few years, both actresses have cemented
themselves as A-listers. These nominations
only seal the deal. Also nominated are Naomi
Watts ("The Impossible"), Emmanuelle Riva
(Amour) and newcomer Quvenzhane Wallis
(Beasts of the Southern Wild) who at nine
years old is the youngest actress ever to score a

Best Actress nomination.
The Supporting Actor nom
inations were surprising in that
every actor nominated has
already won an Oscar
Christoph Waltz ("Django
Unchained"), Philip Seymour
Hoffman ("The Master"),
Robert De Niro ("Silver Linings
Playbook"), Alan Arkin
("Argo") and Tommy Lee Jones
("Lincoln"). In doing so the
Academy ignored some other
great performances, including
Ezra Miller in "The Perks of
Being a Wallflower" and
Leonardo di Caprio in "Django
Unchained."
The Supporting Actress cat
egory rewarded one of the

year's most buzzed-about per
formances Anne Hathaway
in "Les Miserables" as well as
Sally Field ("Lincoln"), Jacki
Weaver ("Silver Linings
Playbook"), Helen Hunt ("The
Sessions") and Amy Adams
("The Master"). Although a
Hathaway win is basically a
given at this point, Field could
upset with her strong turn as
Mary Todd in "Lincoln."
Of course, nothing is known
for sure until the Oscars air on
Feb. 24. Given this year's unusu
ally dramatic nominations
round, hopefully it will be a
livelier ceremony than usual
especially with Seth McFarlane
hosting.
