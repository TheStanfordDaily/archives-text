# ZERO DARK THIRTY
## The
						Academy's darling shines in theaters 
### 
CC Y me ro Dark Thirty" follows the ClA's
M manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. The
a revolves around the sharp CIA
agent Maya (Jessica Chastain), who spearheads
the investigation. "Zero Dark Thirty" is a somber,
intense and impressive film by Oscar-winning
director Kathryn Bigelow ("The Hurt Locker").
The film is effective in keeping the narrative
grounded firmly in reality. It does a good job of
portraying the difficulty and frustration of the
Bin Laden search. Though the movie follows a
linear narrative, the search for Bin Laden was cer
tainly circuitous. As "Zero" shows, there was not
one eureka moment, but a series of small steps
forward with many steps backwards. While many
films shy away from uncertainties to keep to a
clear, clean narrative, "Zero" embraces them, the
realism of the search strengthening the movie.
Even as we get closer and closer to finding Bin
Laden in the movie, we never get that it's a sure
thing.
There's been quite a lot of controversy over
various aspects of the torture scenes in the movie:
that they weren't accurate because the CIA didn't
use them to find Bin Laden, and that the movie
promotes the use of torture to extract informa
tion. The scenes are intense and difficult to watch,
but "Zero" doesn't seem like the movie is promot
ing the use of torture to get information.
Ultimately, it is unclear if the information the
characters get from the interrogations is useful.

There's a secondary storyline to the man
hunt that doesn't come through as well: the
changing role of the CIA and how that has
affected its priorities. We get hints of the theme
from Maya's bosses, but it's mostly pushed to the
side as the search progresses.
In terms of performances, "Zero" belongs to
Jessica Chastain. As Maya, she finds her voice as
the movie progresses. She transforms from the
newest CIA agent in the Pakistan office who
stands quietly in the interrogation room to the
only person in a room full of CIA leaders who has
complete conviction that they have found Osama
Bin Laden. While we see Maya find her voice, the
movie would have benefited from spending more
time on how she formed her views. We see her
looking conflicted during earlier interrogations,
but the way her perspective on interrogations
changes with time is not really shown.
Rounding out the rest of the cast, Jason
Clarke and Jennifer Ehle play additional CIA
agents, Kyle Chandler portrays Maya's boss, and
Chris Pratt ("Parks and Recreation") stars as a
Navy SEAL. I'm a big fan of "Parks and
Recreation," but it was a bit distracting to see
Pratt in the movie. He provides some levity but
doesn't seem to quite fit the tone of the rest of
the movie.
"Zero Dark Thirty" is a somber portrayal of
a manhunt. It is intense, draining and completely
worth seeing.
