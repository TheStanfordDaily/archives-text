## THE 						TOP FIVE 
### Alex Kennedy | Staff Writer 
Not ready to be back at classes? Neither is
Intermission. Here are the top five best and
worst parts of being at home versus back at
Stanford.

■ SLEEPING
Sleeping at home is a world apart
from sleeping at school. I hope you
are as blessed as I am to have an awe
some bed back home, but in some
ways it's both a gift and a curse.
While you're at home, you get to be
SO comfortable, and sleep so very
much better, which is great! But by
definition, all of us college students
spend most of our sleeping evenings
away from home, which means
opportunities to sleep like a starfish
are few and far between! So hopeful
ly you savored your nights at home,
and try not to think about them too
much now that we're back at school.

■ WAKING HOURS
Your waking hours at home versus at
school can vary in two ways: 1) the
number of hours you're awake, and
2) which hours you spend sleeping
versus awake. Upon finishing finals,
surely everyone's schedule changes

sleep debt is a real thing, as evi
denced by the 18-hour nap you took
on your first day back at home. But
after a week or so of power naps and
sleeping in, you may find yourself the
only one awake and up for popcorn
and a movie at 1:30 a.m. Turns out,
the real world isn't quite as nocturnal
as Stanford is. (Side note: Why aren't
shops and restaurants and things
open late? Amazing how many things
seem to be closed too early when you
get up at 12:30 p.m.)
■ EATING
This varies according to your living
situation and year at Stanford. Frosh:
savor your dinners at home! On the
flip side, those of us spoiled by awe
some in-house chefs are disappoint
ed to come home to a fridge that
lacks twelve kinds of leftovers and a
kitchen full of snacks. Plus, family
might not take kindly to your expec
tation of freshly cooked lunch and

dinner every day.
■ COMMUTING
I live in a city that is only seven miles
wide by seven miles long, and even
my minimal commute times are a
pain when I first come home. Who
knew it was so convenient to have all
your friends next door (or maybe 2
minutes away) at all times?
■ COMMUNICATING
This one also depends on your fami
ly and home, but unless your parents
or siblings are Stanford alums, you'll
probably find yourself explaining
every seventh word that comes out of
your mouth, because no one under
stands that ZAP is a house and that
Dollies are separate from cheerlead
ers. And good luck explaining to
your friends what "Secret Snowflake"
was, or how every dorm goes on ski
trip.
