# Sex Talk with the Tree: THREE'S NOT ALWAYS A CROWD
## 
### 
I was recently approached to
guest star in a three way. Even if
you been in a group sex sce
nario before, it is important to real
ly think about the pros and cons
before you jump into bed with
more than one partner.
For example, not an ideal situ
ation: A girlfriend of mine has been
on the rocks with her boyfriend for
a few months. They have broken
up, gotten back together, the usual.
She comes into my room, stark
naked, and says, ? I just convinced
Trevor to have a three way with us ?
come and join.?
Another non-ideal situation: I
had been hooking up with a guy—
we will call him Bobby in my
house sophomore year. We were
not official yet, but it seemed as if
that?s where things were going.
One week, his ?ffiend? from home
visited. I later found out, from her,
that it was his ex whom he had
been dating on and off for years.
Later that night, I walked past them
on the stairs. As I angrily viewed
her just-sexed hair, Bobby noncha
lantly says, ?We were just on our
way to the shower; want to join
us?? No, I did not. ?
It is important to consider the
repercussions of the three way.
Though all parties involved may be
up for it initially, there is really no
telling how people might react after
the event itself. It is really impor
tant to communicate with all of the
participants involved. Though it
may seem to take away from the
sexiness of the proposed mAnage a
trois, it?s guaranteed that proper
preparation will help lead to a less

dramatic, more enjoyable and more
fulfilling experience.
Tips for those of you thinking
about a three way:
If someone brings up the idea
of a three way, don?t assume it is
two girls and one guy, as the media
has popularized. Three ways
happen between any combina
tion of sexes and any combina
tion of sexual orientations.
Though The Lonely
Island?s lyrics, ?It?s not gay
if it?s a three way,? are a paro
dy, try to keep an open mind
everyone has their own different
fantasies.?
If you are guest starring, find
out whose idea the three way was;
chances are everyone will enjoy it
more if the idea was mutual.
If the couple is dating, try to
individually talk to each of the peo
ple involved and ask them how
they feel about the situation, ensur
ing that they are OK with the idea.
If the threesome has people of
both sexes, you are going to have to
be OK seeing or even interacting
with someone of the same sex. If
you are repulsed by this idea, then I
think it is safe to say you will not
enjoy a three way.
Remain sexually safe. You
should still have to consider the
sanitary precautions involved in
sex, especially if there are a few
people. If you will be having vagi
nal or anal sex, it is important to
have many condoms available. You
should use different condoms for
different people do not reuse the
same condom on different partners

(no, it is not the same as sharing a
lollipop).
Also, if you are using
your hands, use one
hand per person toj
minimize the
exchange of
fluids.
Drinking
might make
you feel
more „
relaxed,
but i'
can
also
be a

*~bad
idea. If you don't
really want to partici
pate, don?t drink and
force yourself to feel
comfortable with the

situation chances are
you will regret it later, if
you even remember it. ,
Sure, maybe you want

to have a drink together first as
opposed to walking in the door and
immediately taking your pants off
but don?t get drunk. Trust me when
I say, a flaccid penis can really put a
damper on your potential three way;
you want to be in control and on top
of your game.?
Be prepared for possible out
comes after the three way. It is pos
sible that even if you are among
friends, after a threesome people
may experience feelings of
romance, jealousy, awkwardness,
etc. Though you can?t predict how
people will react afterwards, think
of some potential outcomes. Don?t
let this deter you from having a
threesome, but just make sure that
the experience is worth the possible
negative outcomes.

Know, understand and respect
the limits of everyone involved, as
they could all be different. Establish
a safe word and know how far each

is willing to go.
The famous saying ?three?s a
can sometimes be

Jwoman. I have definitely

encountered some guys who get
jealous or consider same-sex explo
ration as cheating. So, don?t assume
your partners fantasy would be a
three way. Though it might be, find
out first before you recruit another
person from the party you just went
to. Of course, you can always stop
the event at any time, but it would
be better to know if threesomes
don?t sound good to you before
your partner is inside of another
person; thus, try to really think
about it first and have this discus
sion with your potential lovers.
Though this seems like a lot to
think about, keeping this all in mind
and preparing will allow everyone
involved to stay as emotionally and
physically safe as possible. There is a
fine balance between trying to be
sensitive and being so fixated on
sensitivity that you are not enjoying
yourself, as you are too worried how
everyone else is feeling. If you estab
lish these guidelines first, then hope
fully in the moment, you can be
fully present and enjoy yourself.
Threesomes might not be for
everyone, but they can be a beauti
ful, passionate experience if you
want them to be.
