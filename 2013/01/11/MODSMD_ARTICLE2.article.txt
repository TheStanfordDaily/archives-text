## Focus turns away from humanities Thinking Matters allows freshmen to opt for sciences 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thinking Matters replaced
Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) this year and has been
warmly received by many students,
but some lecturers in the program
fear that it marks a shift away from
a humanities education.
Thinking Matters replaced the
widely disliked IHUM program
starting fall quarter 2012. While
Thinking Matters Director Russell
Berman avoided attributing exces
sive significance to fall quarter
course evaluations, he cited
Thinking Matters' one-quarter
requirement —as compared to
IHUM's three and the ability of
students to choose from a larger and
more diverse selection of courses as
critical factors in the new program's
warm reception.
Introduction, without the human
ities
Of the forty Thinking Matters
courses offered this school year,
offerings in non-humanities fields
have been among the most popular
in terms of enrollment. Berman
noted that student interest in these
courses even exceeded administra
tors' expectations.
"We didn't know that the science
courses would succeed as well as
they did," Berman said. "There was
apprehension that these kinds of
non-standard science courses might
not thrive in this introductory envi
ronment, but they were very suc
cessful."
Sharp declines in enrollment for
the program's humanities courses,
however, have prompted concern
among humanities faculty. The
sense of apprehension has also been
exacerbated by the likelihood of fur
ther reductions in the number of
humanities courses offered under
Thinking Matters in an attempt to
maintain sufficient numbers within
individual courses.
Eric Roberts, computer science
professor and "Technological
Visions of Utopia" lecturer, found
that the diminished lecture sizes
constrained faculty in how they
approached and engaged with stu
dents and course material.
"There are some things you can
do in a large class [but not else
where]," Roberts said. "There's
energy that builds on itself in a large
class ... Sometimes I feel like I'm
getting less momentum in the class
this year."
"Some courses ended up quite
small," Berman said. "When cours
es get too small, they lose that lec
ture quality... We're not going to
have that hard and fast a rule, but
there'll be fewer [humanities cours
es]."
Humanities as 'the tail to the
Stanford dog'
History Professor Jack Rakove
believes Stanford's science-based
reputation is partially responsible
for the emerging imbalance in
enrollment figures and called for
greater efforts by the University to
appropriately signpost opportuni
ties for students across the humani
ties.
"We're being whittled back to
kind of a marginal position, where
you can almost wonder what incen
tive we have to participate in the
program," Rakove said.
"Humanities faculty [members]
have often felt like the tail to the
Stanford dog."
Grant Parker, classics professor,
expressed concern that students'
apparent unwillingness to explore
humanities courses would be detri
mental to the freshman experience
and criticized the lack of direction
provided students under Thinking
Matters.

"The liberal education model is
not entirely forgotten, but it's seri
ously watered down," Parker said.
"It seems that the assumption is
that the consumer is always right. Is
that the best basis on which to plan
a curriculum?"

But Berman disputed the assert
ed link between humanities courses
and a liberal education, arguing that
the Thinking Matters program's
emphasis on developing critical
learning could be applied effectively
across a range of academic disci
plines.

"I don't think the humanities
have a monopoly on liberal educa
tion," Berman said. "It is true that
sciences play more of a role ... than
they did in the IHUM program, but
that's all for the good. There should
be gateways to all aspects of the
University in this introductory pro
gram."
"In my experience, Stanford stu
dents are quite intellectually curi
ous," Berman added. "Science and
engineering students recognize the

appeal of some humanistic learn
ing."

While IHUM's objective was to
introduce students to the humani
ties, Thinking Matters' is to develop
students' critical and analytical
skills more broadly.
"The [specific course] subject is
secondary," said Jeffrey
Schwegman 'Ol, a Thinking Matters
lecturer and member of the pro
gram's governing board. "It's a
vehicle for introducing students to
college-level techniques for thinking
and solving problems."
Still, Herman suggested that the
introduction of a revised system of
breadth requirements in the 2013-
14 school year weighted more
towards the humanities and the
projected applicability of Thinking
Matters courses towards these
requirements may prompt further
student interest in humanities
courses.

"I don't think the humanities
have a monopoly on liberal educa
tion," Berman said. "It is true that
sciences play more of a role ... than
they did in the IHUM program, but
that's all for the good. There should
be gateways to all aspects of the
University in this introductory pro
gram."
"In my experience, Stanford stu
dents are quite intellectually curi
ous," Berman added. "Science and
engineering students recognize the

appeal of some humanistic learn
ing."

While IHUM's objective was to
introduce students to the humani
ties, Thinking Matters' is to develop
students' critical and analytical
skills more broadly.
"The [specific course] subject is
secondary," said Jeffrey
Schwegman 'Ol, a Thinking Matters
lecturer and member of the pro
gram's governing board. "It's a
vehicle for introducing students to
college-level techniques for thinking
and solving problems."
Still, Herman suggested that the
introduction of a revised system of
breadth requirements in the 2013-
14 school year weighted more
towards the humanities and the
projected applicability of Thinking
Matters courses towards these
requirements may prompt further
student interest in humanities
courses.
