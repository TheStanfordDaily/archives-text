## Focus turns away from humanities Thinking Matters allows freshmen to opt for sciences 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thinking Matters replaced
Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) this year and has been
warmly received by many students,
but some lecturers in the program
fear that it marks a shift away from
a humanities education.
Thinking Matters replaced the
widely disliked IHUM program
starting fall quarter 2012. While
Thinking Matters Director Russell
Berman avoided attributing exces
sive significance to fall quarter
course evaluations, he cited
Thinking Matters' one-quarter
requirement â€”as compared to
IHUM's three and the ability of
students to choose from a larger and
more diverse selection of courses as
critical factors in the new program's
warm reception.
Introduction, without the human
ities
Of the forty Thinking Matters
courses offered this school year,
offerings in non-humanities fields
have been among the most popular
in terms of enrollment. Berman
noted that student interest in these
courses even exceeded administra
tors' expectations.
"We didn't know that the science
courses would succeed as well as
they did," Berman said. "There was
apprehension that these kinds of
non-standard science courses might
not thrive in this introductory envi
ronment, but they were very suc
cessful."
Sharp declines in enrollment for
the program's humanities courses,
however, have prompted concern
among humanities faculty. The
sense of apprehension has also been
exacerbated by the likelihood of fur
ther reductions in the number of
humanities courses offered under
Thinking Matters in an attempt to
maintain sufficient numbers within
individual courses.
Eric Roberts, computer science
professor and "Technological
Visions of Utopia" lecturer, found
that the diminished lecture sizes
constrained faculty in how they
approached and engaged with stu
dents and course material.
"There are some things you can
do in a large class [but not else
where]," Roberts said. "There's
energy that builds on itself in a large
class ... Sometimes I feel like I'm
getting less momentum in the class
this year."
"Some courses ended up quite
small," Berman said. "When cours
es get too small, they lose that lec
ture quality... We're not going to
have that hard and fast a rule, but
there'll be fewer [humanities cours
es]."
Humanities as 'the tail to the
Stanford dog'
History Professor Jack Rakove
believes Stanford's science-based
reputation is partially responsible
