# THE 						SPOTLIGHT'S ON
## PAC-12 CLASH LOOMS 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team finally showed
glimpses of the talent and poise
that had college basketball
experts projecting them as an
underrated team to watch out for
in the preseason this past week.
Coming off a close 68-60 loss
against the heavily-favored
UCLA Bruins, led by freshman
phenom Shabazz Muhammad,
the Cardinal righted the ship
against Washington State.
Stanford upended the Cougars,
recording a much-needed 78-67
win to earn them their first con
ference victory of the season.
The Card (10-6, 1-2 Pac-12)
will look to carry this momentum
into the upcoming weekend, as
they take on a conference foe in
the Washington Huskies (10-5,5-
0 Pac-12) on Saturday at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford will look to
hand the Huskies their first con
ference loss of the season, as the
Huskies are coming off of a pair
of solid wins against Washington
State and California.
For Stanford as a school, this
is more than just an early season
conference game, as the Card
will be looking to avenge an ear
lier upset loss at the hands of the
Washington football team that
may have kept them out of the
National Championship conver
sation.
On paper, these two teams
appear to be evenly matched.
However, Stanford will have the
difficult defensive task of slowing
down junior guard C.J. Wilcox,
the Huskies most complete
offensive player who has quickly
emerged as one of the most dan
gerous scorers in the country.
Wilcox leads the team in scoring,
averaging a stellar 28.5 points

per game on 46.2 percent shoot
ing.

He has the potential to hurt
your both in the point and from
beyond the arc, as a solid three
point shot and the quickness and
strength necessary for the drib
ble drive make him dangerous.
Wilcox has also been solid on the
defensive end, accumulating 20
blocks throughout the season
and averaging nearly 5 rebounds
per game. Stanford will surely
have its hands full trying to slow
Wilcox down.

Despite these statistics,
Wilcox may not be the most trou
bling player for Stanford. That
honor could belong to senior 7-
foot Aziz N'Diaye.

N'Diaye is a brute in the
paint, using his immense
strength and size to gain position
on opposing players under the
basket. The center is putting up
impressive numbers, nearly
averaging a double-double. His
11.1 points per game have come
on an unheard off 63.6 percent
clip from the field, and his aver
age of 9.3 rebounds per game is
no laughing matter.
The big man has been highly
productive for the Huskies, and
will look to continue his success
ful play as he takes on a host of
undersized Stanford defenders.
Stanford Coach Johnny
Dawkins will have to go to the
drawing board to come up with a
defensive scheme to stop
N'Diaye.
Conference play will be
important for the Cardinal, as
they look to emerge as one of the
top Pac-12 teams. A win against
Washington would put them in a
good position early on. Tip off is
at 8 p.m.

Led by a resurgent Aaron Bright (2), Stanford pulled away from Wazzu for
the team's first Pac-12 win of the year on Wednesday. The junior guard will
need to step up again Saturday when the Card hosts Washington.
