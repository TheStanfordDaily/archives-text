# '13 SCHEDULE RELEASED
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After accidentally releasing an
early look at Stanford football's
2013 schedule, the Pac-12 officially
announced the full slate of games
for next season on Thursday, high
lighted by a Nov. 7 showdown with
Oregon that will likely be broad

cast on national television.
Quick hits: The big game on the
schedule is clearly the clash
against the Ducks on a Thursday
night, which could once again have
national-title implications. Hopefully
having nine months to prepare will
allow Stanford Stadium to fill for
what should be a battle for the Pac

12 North Division title.
The traditional rivalry with
California is back to its traditional
pre-Thanksgiving slot, Nov. 23rd.
The back end of the schedule is
absolutely loaded. After a pretty
breezy six-game stretch to open
the season, although San Jose
State might start the year ranked
and Washington is definitely no
pushover, the final month of the
season has Oregon, USC, Cal and
Notre Dame in that order. Three of
the four teams, sorry Bears, have
the potential to be top-10 teams.
Talk about brutal.
The Cardinal travel to West
Point, NY to face Army for the first
time 1979 on September 14. That
will be Stanford's first game
against a military academy since
Navy pounded them in the dark
ages, administering a 37-9 beating
to open up the new Stanford
Stadium in 2006. The all-time series
is tied at five wins apiece, and the
Black Knights will pay a return
visit to the West Coast in 2014.
David Shaw's club will travel to
Utah for the first time since the
conference's expansion (October
12) but Stanford will miss Arizona

and Colorado in the 2013 Pac-12
schedule rotation.
Stanford's September 28 away
game against Washington State
will be held at Seattle's
Century Link Field, the same sta
dium that saw the Cardinal lose
17-13 to the Washington Huskies
this past season. Ironically,
Stanford will then play the
Huskies the weekend after
they leave Seattle. In addition,
Reunion Homecoming is two
weeks after that, slated for
October 19 against UCLA.

Kevin Hogan (8) was undefeated in five starts under center in 2012,
but will have to navigate a brutal stretch in the schedule next season
if Stanford is to find its way back to the Rose Bowl.
