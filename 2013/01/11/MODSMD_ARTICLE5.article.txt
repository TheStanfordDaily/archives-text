# STUDENT LIFE
## New night shuttle services Oak Creek 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A new Marguerite shuttle
launched this quarter to serve stu
dents living in the Oak Creek
Apartment complex, the main
source of Stanford's off-campus
housing, from 9 p.m. to midnight,
seven nights a week. The shuttle,
which will continue to service
Stanford for the remainder of the
academic year, transports students
between Oak Creek and Tresidder
Union, with shuttles stopping at
both locations every 20 minutes.

Ward Thomas, the transporta
tion operations manager at
Stanford University Parking and
Transportation, refers to the OCA
shuttle as a "sprinter" vehicle that
can hold up to 16 people and up to
five bikes depending on the size of
the van.

Rodger Whitney, the executive
director of Stanford's Residential
and Dining Enterprises Student
Housing, stated that the large num
bers of Stanford students living in
Oak Creek led to an increase in stu
dent demand for the shuttle com
pared to previous years. He also

believes that the shuttle will allow
students living in the apartments to
feel more closely connected to cam
pus.
"R&DE Student Housing has
contracted with Oak Creek for
some years now to provide addition
al housing when demand on campus
exceeds supply," Whitney said. "It is
our goal that the students residing
in these apartments have an experi
ence very similar to apartment res
idents on campus."

On Jan. 7, a new shuttle route launched on campus to service students
living in Oak Creek. The shuttle runs between Tresidder and

service in order to facilitate trans
portation to and from campus for
students living in Oak Creek, many
of whom have recently returned to
campus after having studied abroad
during fall quarter.
According to Edith Wu-Nguyen,
the resident director at Oak Creek,
there are 220 undergraduates living
in the 15 different buildings.
According to Wu-Nguyen, Oak
Creek housed 60 undergraduates
when it was first used for Student
Housing in January 2009.
Wu-Nguyen said that funding
was a major issue that delayed the
implementation of the shuttle serv
ice, which Stanford hopes will pre
vent unsafe chiving or biking from
campus to Oak Creek.

"The road from Governor's
Corner to Oak Creek is really dark,"
said Lauryn Williams 'l4, who spent
last quarter abroad and was
assigned to Oak Creek. She uses the

new Marguerite shuttle whenever
she has meetings on campus at night.
"You just wonder how students
in the past got around without a car
or even without a bike," she said.
Sarah Kunis 'l4, who was
assigned to Oak Creek after study
ing in Washington, D.C. last quarter,
believes that the shuttle is an inte
gral part of her new life at Stanford.
"The shuttle has the potential to
make Oak Creek less isolating for
people, and friends can come and
visit," Kunis said. "This benefits not
only people in Oak Creek but also
people who don't live in Oak Creek...

I think it can build a good communi
ty."

Kunis reported taking the shuttle
three times since starting school this
week, noticing that there were at
least three to ten riders at all times
with her when she used the service.
The shuttle also makes about five
stops within the Oak Creek complex.
Students who have been living at
Oak Creek since fall quarter also
report appreciation for the new serv
ice.
"The Oak Creek shuttle line has
definitely changed the way I get
around," said Susan Chang 'l5, who
has been living in Oak Creek since
September. "The OCA, in junction
with the other 'nocturnal' shuttles...
makes it possible for me to get
around by myself more comfortably
and safely."
"One of the conditions to allow to
the shuttle to run was that the shut
tle service be available to any Oak
Creek resident," Wu-Nguyen said.
"You don't have to just be a Stanford
student."
