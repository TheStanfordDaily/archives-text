## New night shuttle services Oak Creek 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
A new Marguerite shuttle
launched this quarter to serve stu
dents living in the Oak Creek
Apartment complex, the main
source of Stanford's off-campus
housing, from 9 p.m. to midnight,
seven nights a week. The shuttle,
which will continue to service
Stanford for the remainder of the
academic year, transports students
between Oak Creek and Tresidder
Union, with shuttles stopping at
both locations every 20 minutes.

Ward Thomas, the transporta
tion operations manager at
Stanford University Parking and
Transportation, refers to the OCA
shuttle as a "sprinter" vehicle that
can hold up to 16 people and up to
five bikes depending on the size of
the van.

Rodger Whitney, the executive
director of Stanford's Residential
and Dining Enterprises Student
Housing, stated that the large num
bers of Stanford students living in
Oak Creek led to an increase in stu
dent demand for the shuttle com
pared to previous years. He also

believes that the shuttle will allow
students living in the apartments to
feel more closely connected to cam
pus.
"R&DE Student Housing has
contracted with Oak Creek for
some years now to provide addition
al housing when demand on campus
exceeds supply," Whitney said. "It is
our goal that the students residing
in these apartments have an experi
ence very similar to apartment res
idents on campus."
