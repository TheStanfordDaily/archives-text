## SEEING GREEN Life Finds A Way 
### Holly Moeller 
"T TT Tow, you get river otters
l/l / here?" exclaimed Abby
V Y as she scanned a sign
near the ruins of the Sutro Baths at
the Western edge of San Francisco.
I glanced at the temporary plac
ard. "Don't feed the wild animals," it
read, alongside a picture of a playful
looking river otter.
"There's no way," I said. I've only
seen a river otter once in my life a
lucky glimpse from a kayak along a
particularly isolated stretch of
Southeast Alaskan coastline. I could
n't imagine such a shy animal toler
ating all the commotion of city life
and tourist foot traffic. "They proba
bly ran out of signs with sea lions."
Then, two days later, I stumbled
across a news article about Sutro
Sam, a genuine river otter (I clicked
through the pictures to be absolute
ly sure) recently seen frolicking
around the concrete bath pools. I ate
crow, forwarded the article to Abby,
and made a mental note to spend a
few hours next weekend staking out
the Baths in hopes of catching a
glimpse of my own.
We have known for a long time
that some animals tolerate humans
remarkably well. One has only to
witness the daily standoffs between
dockworkers and sea lions around
the corner at Pier 39 to know that at
least one marine mammal has no
problem claiming human structures
for itself. Some species pigeons,
cockroaches, rats, and even the deer
of suburbia seem almost pre
adapted for existence in the built
environment, where they are so suc
cessful that they have become pests.
Others eke out an uneasy coexis
tence at the expanding edges of
human development, like the Los
Angeles coyotes that occasionally
devour a purse dog out of sheer des
peration.
Still, we get a pleasant thrill of
surprise whenever we glimpse a bit
of wildness in our urban enclaves,
like Sutro Sam, or the red-tailed
hawks of New York's Central Park.
In part, we're recognizing that rusty
but eternal link between ourselves
and our evolutionary past. And in
part, we're responding to our social
history our visits to zoos and
viewings of nature documentaries
that taught us that such experiences
are a rare privilege.
For me and possibly Abby,
nerdy biologists that we are much
of the excitement stems from awe at
the adaptability of life. Perhaps I've
grown too anthropocentric, come to
feel too unique as I stumble about on
my two legs, but I'm continually
struck by the variety of forms and
behaviors that life can adapt to toler
ate environmental stress. From the
trees sprouting in the gutters of
houses to the cattle egrets that fol
low industrial lawnmowers instead

of herds of cows, as Dr. Lan Malcolm
told us in Jurassic Park, "Life finds a
way."

Ecologists, of course, have an
elaborate framework of technical
terms to describe and categorize
such phenomena. At the leading
edges of human activity which
seem to become more remote with
each passing day â€”we concern
ourselves with "resilience:" the abil
ity of an ecosystem (and its organ
isms) to tolerate human distur
bance. And at the trailing edges
places like the Sutro Baths, where
our structures are crumbling into
the sea we wonder about "recov
ery," asking who will return, and
when.

After a few centuries of increas
ingly industrialized civilization, and
a few decades of increasingly metic
ulous science, the closest we've
come to a conclusion is that the
story is complicated and heavily
context-dependent. We do know
that every ecosystem has its break
ing point. And long before that
breaking point is reached, some
irreversible transitions may be
made: the local extinction of a par
ticular species, a hydrological trans
formation, or the introduction of a
new community member. And,
while life will persist long after
humans depart (I have infinite con
fidence in our silent microbial over
lords), it may no longer take on the
forms that we associate with
"nature" and "beauty."
The point, then, is that while
Sutro Sam may already be cruising
the outskirts of San Francisco, we
should exercise what restraint we
can in our future environmental
modifications. Although we are
inarguably born from and a part of
nature, we have outstripped the
planet's ability to support us. If we
value the preservation of our evolu
tionary past, rather than playing
guessing games about environmen
tal tolerances, we should eschew
development on pristine landscapes
wherever possible. Where we must
build, let us tread lightly, to maxi
mize the chances of rapid recovery.
Meanwhile, I'll be watching for
river otters along my running
routes. It's a New Year: a time for
new starts, and new meetings in
novel environments.
