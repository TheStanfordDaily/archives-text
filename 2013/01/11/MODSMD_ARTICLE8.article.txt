# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## In Defense of The Band 
### 
I simply cannot let John E's dis
paraging comments about the
Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band in his
January 7 Letter to the Editor go
unchallenged.
The LSJUMB, along with our
Dollies, epitomizes the zest and zeal
of our unchained youth, the free
spirited, whimsical, spontaneous,
improvisational, creative, ultra-lib
erated spirit of not only Stanford,
but the surrounding Silicon Valley
and every entrepreneur who had
crazy dreams and marched to a
crazy new rhythm. Does John E.
propose to capture and cage and
contain this spirit, subjecting it to a
regimented goose step befitting
only militaristic lemmings?
John E invokes the Tournament
of Roses as a kind of holy standard
proudly embraced by all
Pasadenans. He might wish to know
that Pasadena has an equally noble
tradition alongside the TORP the
Doo Dah Parade which was
launched decades ago by a motley
crew of spirited natives to celebrate
the city's heritage with zany, free
spirited drill teams and floats that
make the LSJUMB look tame in
comparison. Perhaps the TOR is
uncomfortable with surrendering
the spotlight and international
media coverage to these upstarts at
the Doo Dah Parade, but the truth is
the Doo Dah Parade represents a
spirit of fun and frivolity that many
Pasadenans are immensely proud
of. Ditto for the Stanford Band and
its students and alumni.
As a native son of Pasadena, I
spent many sleepless New Year's
Eves camped out on Colorado
Boulevard waiting for the Parade.
As a third generation Stanford

graduate ('76) and an attendee at
our last Stanford Rose Bowl victory
in 1972,1 made the tortuously long
trek from Singapore (where I have
taken up citizenship and resided
since 1985), surviving hellishly
crowded airports, full-body security
checks and winding immigration
queues to not only watch our fabu
lous team play Wisconsin but to also
witness my best buddy "Fast"
Eddie Anderson's ('75) daughter
march with the LSJUMB at the LA
Live pre-game rallies, along the
Parade Route and at the Rose Bowl.
It was magical, enchanting, mysti
cal, out of body, tear-jerking. Thank
you, LSJUMB, for all that you are!
You did us all proud. And kudos to
Wisconsin's band, who had a funky
two-step and who joined LSJUMB
post-game to serenade their very
dedicated (and very impressively
loud) fans.
So here's my advice to John E:
get out of the Badlands, away from
the fumes of fracked shale oil, and
head out West to take a hit of pure
California sunshine. Your comments
warrant a Biblical response from the
Book of Jobs (the late Steve, not the
unlucky dude from the Old
Testament). "Here's to the crazy ones,
the misfits, the rebels, the trouble
makers, the round pegs in the square
holes... the ones who see things dif
ferently â€” they're not fond of rules...
You can quote them, disagree with
them, glorify or vilify them, but the
only thing you can't do is ignore them,
because they change things."
Long live the LSJUMB, and
looking forward to another long
trek out to the Parade and Rose
Rowl this Deoemher/.Tanuarv.
