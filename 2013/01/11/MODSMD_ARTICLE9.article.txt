## Eyebrows, Walmart and the trials of beauty 
### Alex Bayer 
When I was young, pre-tween
age, I went to Walmart with
my mom one day. The new
Mary Kate and Ashley line was out
for girls my age, and man, it was all
the rage. Next thing I know I'm star
ing at my reflection in the mirror
with a sad look on my face. I was
only nine, but already noticing the
flaws in my body. My belly peeked
out of the camisole the pretty lit
tle camisole Mary Kate and Ashley
surely wore, and looked nice in.
My mom was by my side, reading
her book. She noticed I was crestfall
en and tried to cheer me up. She
stood behind me, grasping my shoul
ders, insisting that I look at myself in
the mirror in a new light. "You're
beautiful." I quickly wrote it off.
Then she said: "you have the most
beautiful eyebrows. I wish I had eye
brows like yours."

I went home some time later and
sat on the counter and looked, really
inspected, these eyebrows of mine.
It was no small deal; after all, that
the most beautiful woman I knew
thought they were kind of nice. Well,
they didn't look so special. They
were pretty bushy and shapeless,
never having met a Tweezers or a
teenage girl's perfectionist scrutiny
(yet). Like two furry caterpillars.
But nonetheless, I was proud of
them. My mom thought they were
beautiful. That's all that mattered.
They had the holy seal of approval.

Of course, the holy parental seal
has an expiration date. For me, it was
around the age of fourteen, when
middle school really kicked into high
gear - . Girls started wearing makeup.
Shaving their legs. Donning tight-fit
ting Abercrombie tees and chunky
sterling silver jewelry. For a time, I
still wore my athletic shorts and
oversized Adidas t-shirts, still shied
away from make-up, and let my eye
brows be. But then I started caring
(why must we care) and ticking off
the rites of passage. The eyebrows
were last, but finally I caved. Out
came the Tweezers. And of course, I
over-tweezed the poor caterpillars to
shreds. Thin, threadbare lines of hah'.
Well, you couldn't really tell they
were hair anymore. They merely car
ried the suggestion, the essence, of
hair. Like all the other girls.
Like all the other girls. The rites
continued. Shaving long blond hairs
was only the beginning. There was
flat-ironing to be done in the morn
ing, weight to be maintained and
lost. Always the weight. It was no
longer enough to have a t-shirt from
Abercrombie. Cue the eating disor
ders. Cue the girls dropping out of
school to go to rehab. Cue elliptical
binges, self-loathing, self-flagellation
at the intersection of increase and
pound. This, at an all-girls school
looking good for the boys wasn't
even at stake.

Girls, seventeen-year-old girls,

who wanted to look like fourteen
year-old six-foot models. Girls, who
just wanted to shed a few pounds so
their bodies would feel more lithe at
dances, catch the eye of a cute boy
a fling they hoped would maybe
result in something more, like a con
versation, and if you're absurdly
lucky, a courtship, a date, and if
you're really lucky, a relationship.
There must be girls who love
their bodies. Who travel through
puberty and the even more treacher
ous minefield that is "Teen Vogue"
and "Teen Nick" and all of mass
media with unearthly grace and self
esteem. I never knew such confi
dence; it has always eluded me, and
I am both envious of and reverential
towards it.

I inspect my eyebrows every few
days or so, Tweezers in hand. I put
everything in impeccable order,
right where it should be. Like all the
girls. I take a last glimpse. They are
nice, if unremarkable. My face turns
sad as I remember their former
imprint. Nice, if unremarkable.
I can't help it. The two thin lines
furrow into the ungraceful curve of
an almost-unibrow, as I frown at my
reflection. Nice they may be, but
unremarkable eyebrows were never
complimented by a beautiful woman
in a Walmart dressing room.
