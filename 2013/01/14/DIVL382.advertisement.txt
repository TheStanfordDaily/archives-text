Stanford University
Free and open to the public
To celebrate the Martin Luther King, Jr. national
holiday and the upcoming 50th anniversary of
King's historic "I Have a Dream" address at the
1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom,
Clayborne Carson, director of the King Research
and Education Institute at Stanford, will present a
multimedia, dramatic version of King's memorable
words. Featuring King's former lawyer Clarence B.
Jones as well as Bay Area actors, singers, dancers,
and musicians, this original production will highlight
the historical, cultural, and religious sources that
inspired King's extemporaneous remarks about
America's future as a multiracial democracy.
