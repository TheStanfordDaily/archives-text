# Religious Liberty Clinic opens at Law School
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Molly Vorwerck 
Today, the Stanford Law School will launch
the Religious Liberty Clinic, the nation's first
center that enables law students to represent
clients fighting legal battles pertaining to reli
gious freedom.
This new clinic will allow students to defend
cases involving disputes regarding religious
beliefs and practices under the tutelage of par
ticipating professors with expertise in the field
of religious freedom. In 2012, the Stanford Law
School appointed James A. Sonne, an expert in
religious law, to direct the program, which will
be housed in the scs, students will help repre
sent individuals and associations filing cases on
grounds of infringement on religious liberties,
in addition to taking classes that instruct them
on how to deal with such cases.
"Part of what we are trying to do is show our
students and our community how religious lib
erty is a natural right that is for all of us and
that, all too often, religious liberty disputes are
really debates about the merits of the particu
lar religious practice involved rather than the
liberty," James A Sonne, the clinic's founding
director, said on Wednesday. "We want to show
that this is something for everybody, regardless
of your religious background and practice."
The clinic was funded in part by a $1.6 mil
lion gift from the Washington-based Becket
Fluid for Religious Liberty. The official launch
of the clinic will include a panel discussion on
the future of religious liberty featuring Sonne,
Judge Carlos T. Bea of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Michael W
McConnell, the Richard and Prances Mallery
Professor of Law at the Stanford Law School,
among others.
The new clinic will be one of twelve clinics at
the Mills Legal Clinic, a Stanford Law School in
house group that operates as a single law firm.
