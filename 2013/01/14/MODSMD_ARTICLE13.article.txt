# Stanford spacecraft to explore Martian moon

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Molly Vorwerck 
In collaboration with NASAs Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Stanford researchers
have recently developed a robotic platform
with the potential to advance space research.
The proposed program involves a mother
spacecraft, The Phobos Surveyor, that deploys
spiked, spherical rovers, referred to as "hedge
hogs," to the Martian moon Phobos.
Though most rovers have wheels, the
"hedgehogs" will tumble and hop via spinning
motors, gathering and then relaying informa
tion to Earth about the chemistry of the moon's
surface.
The platform was developed by Marco
Pavone, assistant professor in the Department
of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford,
who views his group's work as a necessary ele
ment of future space exploration.
"It's a piece of technology that's needed
before any more expensive type of exploration
is considered," Pavone said to the Stanford
News Service. "Before sampling, we need to
know where to land. We need to deploy rovers
to acquire info about the surface."
The Phobos Surveyor will orbit Phobos,
communicating with the deployed hedgehog to
determine its position and orientation on the
moon.
The project will aim to determine if
Phobos is a former piece of Mars or an aster
oid captured by Mars' gravity. If they find that
it did originate from Mars, its comparatively
low gravity will present an opportunity for sci
entists to study its properties to pave the way
for a human mission to Mars.
A Phobos Surveyor mission coof the rovers
will likely take place within the next four years.
