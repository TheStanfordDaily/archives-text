## The 						magical power of Oprah's couch 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
If anyone could let me know
which channel Oprah's show is
on, I'd be eternally grateful.
Seriously, I need to know,
because the whole 0 Network
thing is kind of contusing for me, and
in three years of having cable televi
sion, I have yet to come anywhere
near noticing it, let alone turning to it.
Does it even come in basic cable?
Ahh, the important questions in life.
Perhaps I've really been missing
out. Well, probably not.
But I love Oprah, really I do.
Because she apparently is the best
person to turn to when you want the
truth. I don't know why we bother
interrogating anybody these days
I'd say two minutes on Winfrey's
couch would turn even the most hard
ened men into songbirds.
Exhibit A: Tom Cruise.
Exhibit B: Tom Cruise.
Exhibit C: everybody else who
has ever appeared on the show, as the
list includes mass murderers confess
ing their sins, authors admitting to
plagiarism and fiction, Michael
Jackson at his personal theme park,
drug addicts... I mean, I don't know
where to stop.
Perhaps I'll just get to the point:
Lance Armstrong.
Armstrong is the reason I need to
know where to find Oprah these days,
and why I must delete an old episode
of Nashville in order to make room on
my DVR.
Today, Oprah sits down with the
man who beat testicular cancer, won
seven Tom' de France titles in a row
and raised hundreds of millions of
dollars for cancer research. And he's
going to admit he cheated the whole
way.
At least that's what the liberal
media tells me.
And that's not all they say. Most of
the media tells me that I should
despise Armstrong as the ringleader
of perhaps the greatest cheating
scandal sports has ever seen. I should
see Armstrong as a manipulating,
lying, cutthroat ass who intimidated
and threatened his way to the top of
the world of cycling and profited like
few ever have before. They say I
should never let Armstrong back into
the spotlight because what he did was
unforgiveable.
It sounds like a challenge.
You should know by now that I've
never shied away from an argument
in my life. I love Tim Tebow and
Jordan Williamson, and I think
Bonds and Clemens deserve to be in
the Hall of Fame just as much as
Babe Ruth does. Need you know
more?
But I digress. What I mean to say
is I also think Lance Armstrong
deserves to keep all those yellow jer
seys no matter what he injected into
his veins for all those years.
I'm sorry to keep subjecting you
to this abuse about steroids, and I
promise this is my last post on the
subject for at least the next month,
but my argument is simple: Lance
Armstrong made cycling relevant for
the first time in this country, raised
hundreds of millions of dollars for
cancer research and did exactly what
he needed to do in order to win in his
sport.
To me, that sounds like the
American dream. I know that
steroids are bad, that they can kill
you and should not be taken by any
young athlete. I also know that blood
doping is dangerous and can kill you.
I also know that people like
Armstrong cannot help but be role
models and that people will look up to
them and kids will want to emulate
them and that cheating is a terrible
example to leave.
That's why we hate Ray Lewis,
right? Why we shun the man who
very likely killed two men with a knife
and at the very least is responsible for
bringing his two friends to the fight
and allowing them to do the job.
Which is why we banned NFL wide
receiver Donte Stallworth for life
after got into his car- with a BAC of
above .120 and soon after struck and
killed a man who ran across the road
trying to catch a bus to work.
I know my argument is weak if all
I do is toss up examples of other peo
ple who should be punished but some
how escaped. But I don't think that
it's criminally weak to point out that
Armstrong cheated during an age of
cycling in which some people close to
the issue think upwards of 50 percent
of the field was doping in some man
ner or another.
If you wanted to award a title for

the 2003 race, you'd have to
give it to the fifth-place finish
er, Haimar Zubeldia, who was
the only rider in the top-eight
not to be caught by a drug
test.

In 2005 once again, seven
of the first eight finishers have
been caught doping.
The list goes on, and what I
have to say about that might
not matter to you all that
much, but I find it unfair that
Lance Armstrong would fin
ish behind all those riders by
not using EPO.
This, I suppose, naturally
leads to the idea that I also
should feel sorry for the 50
percent that didn't cheat and
ended up suffering for it. I do
feel sorry for them, but I don't

blame Armstrong.
No, I blame a society that
allowed the Tour to go on year
after year when allegations of
doping have been extremely
widespread in the sport for
decades and that championed
honesty and integrity only
until those athletes stop win
ning.

Lance Armstrong used his
pedestal to do plenty of good
for the world in my opinion,
and he also used it to do harm.
I guess he is human after all.
That's pretty much how I felt
when the lies began to reallll
lyyyy unravel.
I hope he admits he cheat
ed for the first time today, not
for me or him, but so that all
the people who want to hear
him apologize for being a ter
rible person and trying to win
at all costs, knowing that even
beating cancer and being one
of the better athletes in the
world which I challenge

anyone to prove that he of the
32 beats per minute heart rate
would not be if he didn't dope
â€” would not have brought
him fame or fortune or the
success that we applaud our
citizens for dreaming of one
day having.
I'm sorry too, because that
last sentence was way too
long. But you won't convince
me that Lance Armstrong is
worse than Ray Lewis or
Tiger Woods or any other ath
lete who has skeletons in the
closet.
At least not unless you get
me on Oprah's couch...

Miles Bennett-Smith is on
record saying that Jordan
Williamson will win the Lou
Groza award next year, and
he will not apologize for it.
