# END GAME WOES

Trailing 62-60 to the favored Washington
Huskies (11-5,3-0 Pac-12) with just over a minute
remaining, the Stanford Cardinal (10-7, 1-3)
turned to its hottest hand, junior forward Dwight
Powell. Powell made a move to the basket, and
despite having a potential lane to the hoop, pulled
up for a short jumper.

Every Stanford fan in the building was left
holding then- breath as the ball headed to the bas
ket. But victory was not in the cards on Saturday
night, as Powell's attempt rattled out and the

Cardinal fell to Washington, 65-60.
After picking up its first Pac-12 win over
Washington State on Wednesday, the Cardinal
was looking to move back to .500 in conference
play. Instead, they are sitting at 1-3, finding them
selves near the bottom of the Pac-12.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins was disappoint
ed by his team's effort down the stretch. "I
thought we had some opportunities and we didn't
complete the plays," he said. "You know, we didn't
finish plays down the stretch."
It has been an all-too-familiar story for the
Cardinal in this early season, a common issue for
a group of players that are still attempting to
define their roles.
The first half was a back-and-forth battle, as
neither team was able to pull away. In fact, the
largest lead for either team came with 4:37 sec
onds left in the half after sophomore guard
Chasson Randle knocked a jumper. The Huskies
quickly recaptured the lead, as a quick jumper
and three-pointer by guard C.J. Wilcox put
Washington up 29-28.
Randle and Wilcox decided to take matters
into their own hands as the half drew to a close.
Down by two with just under two minutes remain
ing, Randle drove to the basket and converted the
layup. With an "anything you can do, I can do bet
ter" mentality, Wilcox squared up and knocked
down a jumper to put his Huskies back on top.
Randle countered with a three-point bucket of his
own before Wilcox hit yet another jumper. Finally,
Randle put an exclamation on what was an excep
tional half for him, hitting another shot in the
paint to put Stanford up 36-35 heading into the
break.
The second half was a similar story, as both
teams appeared evenly matched. Back-to-back
scores by Wilcox and Desmond Simmons put
Washington up 52-44, giving them their largest
lead of the game. Stanford would roar back, as a
