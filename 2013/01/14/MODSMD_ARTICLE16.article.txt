### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In a weekend dominated by great
moments in the NFL playoffs, per
haps the most exciting match was the
Saturday showdown between the
Stanford men's volleyball team and
the University of the Pacific. Despite
facing six match points, the Cardinal
was able to rally back and win a
thrilling five-set battle 3-2.
No. 3 Stanford (4-0,1-0 MPSF)
opened its weekend against UC-
Santa Cruz, ranked fourth in Div.

111. The match served as a good
opportunity for the Cardinal to get
a final tune-up before conference
play began, with all 18 players on
the Stanford roster getting a
chance to shine.

Sean Kemper, who recorded two
blocks and a kill on his only attack,

commented that the relative ease
Stanford had with the Banana
Slugs played a large role in their
performance against No. 15 Pacific,
as "the starters only had to play
one set, allowing them to be fresh
for the five sets the next day."
Freshman setter Joe Ctvrtlik,
making his collegiate debut, had an
impressive performance after sub
bing in for fellow freshman James
Shaw in the second set, putting up
a match-high 17 assists and seven
digs, while also chipping in two aces
and three kills. He even chipped in

a block despite standing just 6-feet
tall.
The dominant 25-18, 25-20, 25-
12 victory gave the Cardinal confi

the Tigers. It was apparent from
the start, however, that the game
was going to be a struggle.
The first set was back-and
forth, with both teams unable to get
an advantage on the other. The
largest separation between the
teams was just three points, but the
