# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Excitement as furious Card rally tops Pacific 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In a weekend dominated by great
moments in the NFL playoffs, per
haps the most exciting match was the
Saturday showdown between the
Stanford men's volleyball team and
the University of the Pacific. Despite
facing six match points, the Cardinal
was able to rally back and win a
thrilling five-set battle 3-2.
No. 3 Stanford (4-0,1-0 MPSF)
opened its weekend against UC-
Santa Cruz, ranked fourth in Div.

111. The match served as a good
opportunity for the Cardinal to get
a final tune-up before conference
play began, with all 18 players on
the Stanford roster getting a
chance to shine.
Sophomore middle blocker
Sean Kemper, who recorded two
blocks and a kill on his only attack,

commented that the relative ease
Stanford had with the Banana
Slugs played a large role in their
performance against No. 15 Pacific,
as "the starters only had to play
one set, allowing them to be fresh
for the five sets the next day."
Freshman setter Joe Ctvrtlik,
making his collegiate debut, had an
impressive performance after sub
bing in for fellow freshman James
Shaw in the second set, putting up
a match-high 17 assists and seven
digs, while also chipping in two aces
and three kills. He even chipped in

a block despite standing just 6-feet
tall.
The dominant 25-18, 25-20, 25-
12 victory gave the Cardinal confi
dence entering its matchup with
the Tigers. It was apparent from
the start, however, that the game
was going to be a struggle.
The first set was back-and
forth, with both teams unable to get
an advantage on the other. The
largest separation between the
teams was just three points, but the

Cardinal was able to maintain
either a lead or a tie for the
entire set, closing the Tigers
out 25-23 on a block by junior
outside hitter Brian Cook and
sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly.
The second set appeared
to be more of the same, with
both teams exchanging
points, but Pacific soon seized
control with a powerful 7-2
run. The Cardinal was unable
to close the gap, ultimately
dropping the set 25-17.

Stanford started the third
set on a hot streak, but the
Tigers swiftly fought them
selves back into the game.
Not to be undone, Stanford
uncorked a 4-0 run, which

Pacific immediately answered
with a 5-0 run of their own,
tying the score at 20 apiece.
The score soon ballooned to
25-all, at which point
Pacific's junior middle block
er Christian Ahlin recorded
two straight kills to give
Pacific the set and a 2-1
match advantage.
Knowing it needed a
fourth-set victory to preserve
its unbeaten season, Stanford
refused to let come down to
another close ending. With
the Tigers holding a 8-7 lead,
Stanford uncorked a quick 7-
1 run, giving the Cardinal a
lead it would not relinquish,
as Stanford took the fourth
set 25-17.

Accordingly, the match
came down the fifth and final
set, with both teams fired up
at the chance to take the
other down. The Tigers came
out with a new ferocity, open

ing the set with three straight
kills, putting Stanford in a
deep opening hole.
Down 14-11 and on the
brink of defeat, Stanford was
able to galvanize itself, con
verting on three straight
match-points to tie the score
at 14. Pacific and Stanford
began to trade points, with
the Tigers serving for two
more match points before
allowing the Cardinal to tie
the game back up.
Facing a 17-16 deficit and
Pacific's sixth match point of
the game, the Cardinal
offense finally broke out.
Shaw was somehow able to
reach a wayward pass over
the net, flicking it to junior
middle blocker Eric
Mochalski who unleashed a
vicious kill, tying the game at
17. Mochalski followed that
with another kill, giving the
Cardinal its first lead of the

set and first match-point
opportunity.
This was not something
the Cardinal was willing to
waste, a fact junior opposite
Daniel Tublin made abun
dantly clear, smashing home
the game-winning kill and
completing the incredible
comeback.
Tublin painted the best
picture of the moment:
"James [Shaw] gave me a
rear back set, and I just
aimed high. It hit their hands,
and it fell through to the
ground. No feeling like it:
having the chance to close out
a match where the whole
team made an unreal come
back. I yelled in relief and
was quickly mobbed by my
team. That sth game was a
total team effort, and I could
n't have been happier to
share the victory with my
peeps in that huddle."

Stanford had a number of
impressive individual per
formances, highlighted by
Shaw. The freshman recorded
a double-double, with 54
assists and 12 digs, while
adding five kills. Cook had his
usual standout offensive day,
with a match-high 24 kills on
.302 hitting. His fellow junior
outside hitter, Steven Irvin,
also made big contributions on
the offensive end, posting his
first double-double of the sea
son with 14 kills and 14 digs.
Stanford will hope to keep
its momentum going into
next week as it goes on the
road for the first time this
season. The Cardinal will face
its two toughest opponents
yet, with No. 8 USC on
Friday and No. 4 Pepperdine
on Saturday.

an advantage on the other. The
largest separation between the
teams was just three points, but the

Cardinal was able to maintain
either a lead or a tie for the
entire set, closing the Tigers
out 25-23 on a block by junior
outside hitter Brian Cook and
sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly.
The second set appeared
to be more of the same, with
both teams exchanging
points, but Pacific soon seized
control with a powerful 7-2
run. The Cardinal was unable
to close the gap, ultimately
dropping the set 25-17.

Stanford started the third
set on a hot streak, but the
Tigers swiftly fought them
selves back into the game.
Not to be undone, Stanford
uncorked a 4-0 run, which

Pacific immediately answered
with a 5-0 run of their own,
tying the score at 20 apiece.
The score soon ballooned to
25-all, at which point
Pacific's junior middle block
er Christian Ahlin recorded
two straight kills to give
Pacific the set and a 2-1
match advantage.
Knowing it needed a
fourth-set victory to preserve
its unbeaten season, Stanford
refused to let come down to
another close ending. With
the Tigers holding a 8-7 lead,
Stanford uncorked a quick 7-
1 run, giving the Cardinal a
lead it would not relinquish,
as Stanford took the fourth
set 25-17.

Accordingly, the match
came down the fifth and final
set, with both teams fired up
at the chance to take the
other down. The Tigers came
out with a new ferocity, open

ing the set with three straight
kills, putting Stanford in a
deep opening hole.
Down 14-11 and on the
brink of defeat, Stanford was
able to galvanize itself, con
verting on three straight
match-points to tie the score
at 14. Pacific and Stanford
began to trade points, with
the Tigers serving for two
more match points before
allowing the Cardinal to tie
the game back up.
Facing a 17-16 deficit and
Pacific's sixth match point of
the game, the Cardinal
offense finally broke out.
Shaw was somehow able to
reach a wayward pass over
the net, flicking it to junior
middle blocker Eric
Mochalski who unleashed a
vicious kill, tying the game at
17. Mochalski followed that
with another kill, giving the
Cardinal its first lead of the

set and first match-point
opportunity.
This was not something
the Cardinal was willing to
waste, a fact junior opposite
Daniel Tublin made abun
dantly clear, smashing home
the game-winning kill and
completing the incredible
comeback.
Tublin painted the best
picture of the moment:
"James [Shaw] gave me a
rear back set, and I just
aimed high. It hit their hands,
and it fell through to the
ground. No feeling like it:
having the chance to close out
a match where the whole
team made an unreal come
back. I yelled in relief and
was quickly mobbed by my
team. That sth game was a
total team effort, and I could
n't have been happier to
share the victory with my
peeps in that huddle."

Stanford had a number of
impressive individual per
formances, highlighted by
Shaw. The freshman recorded
a double-double, with 54
assists and 12 digs, while
adding five kills. Cook had his
usual standout offensive day,
with a match-high 24 kills on
.302 hitting. His fellow junior
outside hitter, Steven Irvin,
also made big contributions on
the offensive end, posting his
first double-double of the sea
son with 14 kills and 14 digs.
Stanford will hope to keep
its momentum going into
next week as it goes on the
road for the first time this
season. The Cardinal will face
its two toughest opponents
yet, with No. 8 USC on
Friday and No. 4 Pepperdine
on Saturday.

In a weekend dominated by great
moments in the NFL playoffs, per
haps the most exciting match was the
Saturday showdown between the
Stanford men's volleyball team and
the University of the Pacific. Despite
facing six match points, the Cardinal
was able to rally back and win a
thrilling five-set battle 3-2.
No. 3 Stanford (4-0,1-0 MPSF)
opened its weekend against UC-
Santa Cruz, ranked fourth in Div.

111. The match served as a good
opportunity for the Cardinal to get
a final tune-up before conference
play began, with all 18 players on
the Stanford roster getting a
chance to shine.
Sophomore middle blocker
Sean Kemper, who recorded two
blocks and a kill on his only attack,

commented that the relative ease
Stanford had with the Banana
Slugs played a large role in their
performance against No. 15 Pacific,
as "the starters only had to play
one set, allowing them to be fresh
for the five sets the next day."
Freshman setter Joe Ctvrtlik,
making his collegiate debut, had an
impressive performance after sub
bing in for fellow freshman James
Shaw in the second set, putting up
a match-high 17 assists and seven
digs, while also chipping in two aces
and three kills. He even chipped in

a block despite standing just 6-feet
tall.
The dominant 25-18, 25-20, 25-
12 victory gave the Cardinal confi
dence entering its matchup with
the Tigers. It was apparent from
the start, however, that the game
was going to be a struggle.
