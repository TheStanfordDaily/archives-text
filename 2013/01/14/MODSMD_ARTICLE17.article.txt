## Stanford goes cold in rematch with Cal 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
It is a commonly held belief in sports that it is
very challenging to beat the same team twice in a
row. Stanford's football team was able to pull off
the difficult double against UCLA in the Pac-12
Championship. The women's basketball team
was not so fortunate; after beating rival
California on Tuesday, the Cardinal (14-2, 3-1
Pac-12) came up short on Sunday, 67-55.

From the start, high-intensity defense allowed
quick transition baskets for both teams. However,
Cal (13-2, 3-1) was able to capitalize on second
chance points as they out-rebounded the Card on
the offensive glass 20-12.
"We struggled the whole game running our
offense," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
really have to have guard leadership where they
come down and are vocal and get us into things
and are making things happen, and maybe defen
sively getting a turnover, and taking ownership a
little bit. We were slow, we weren't getting easy
shots, we weren't getting boards, we weren't get
ting run outs or moving the ball to get good shots,
and they were much more physical than we
were."
VanDerveer substituted early and often to try
to find a group of five that could mesh with the
powerful play of junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike, but once again the task of carrying
the team was left on her shoulders. Despite
aggressive Cal double and triple teams placed on
Ogwumike, she finished the game with 18 points
and nine rebounds, just missing her 12th double
double of the season.
"I put a lot on my shoulders but at the same
time I know I can't do that because we have to
become a balanced team," Ogwumike said. "One

Sophomore Bonnie Samuelson (41) fights for a rebound against California forward Justine
Hartman (40) in the first half at Maples Pavilion. Stanford suffered just its first back-to-back
