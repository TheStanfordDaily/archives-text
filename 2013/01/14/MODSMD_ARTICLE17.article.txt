# A 						RARE LOSING STREAK
## Stanford goes cold in rematch with Cal 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
It is a commonly held belief in sports that it is
very challenging to beat the same team twice in a
row. Stanford's football team was able to pull off
the difficult double against UCLA in the Pac-12
Championship. The women's basketball team
was not so fortunate; after beating rival
California on Tuesday, the Cardinal (14-2, 3-1
Pac-12) came up short on Sunday, 67-55.

From the start, high-intensity defense allowed
quick transition baskets for both teams. However,
Cal (13-2, 3-1) was able to capitalize on second
chance points as they out-rebounded the Card on
the offensive glass 20-12.
"We struggled the whole game running our
offense," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
really have to have guard leadership where they
come down and are vocal and get us into things
and are making things happen, and maybe defen
sively getting a turnover, and taking ownership a
little bit. We were slow, we weren't getting easy
shots, we weren't getting boards, we weren't get
ting run outs or moving the ball to get good shots,
and they were much more physical than we
were."
VanDerveer substituted early and often to try
to find a group of five that could mesh with the
powerful play of junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike, but once again the task of carrying
the team was left on her shoulders. Despite
aggressive Cal double and triple teams placed on
Ogwumike, she finished the game with 18 points
and nine rebounds, just missing her 12th double
double of the season.
"I put a lot on my shoulders but at the same
time I know I can't do that because we have to
become a balanced team," Ogwumike said. "One

Ogwumike struggled to
get good looks inside the
paint as Cal's posts targeted
her from start to finish. But
Stanford's guards struggled
to knock down outside shots
in order to take some of the
defensive pressure off
Ogwumike, finishing 12-41
from the field (29 percent)
and just 2-12 from behind the
arc.
"It wouldn't have mat
tered [if we played Cal] this
week, this month or a month
from now, if we're not aggres
sive," said VanDerveer. "They
[Cal] got their hands on the
ball, we weren't moving the
ball, we turned it over 16
times, and there's it right
there. Our last game, we took
care of the ball better and
they had more turnovers than
us. It's disappointing but I
think that Chiney battled,
and she needs some more
help."
Junior Toni Kokenis and
sophomore Amber Orrange
combined for 21 points; how
ever, Stanford's systematic
offense was shaken by Cal's
defense, which forced

turnovers early on and led to
multiple shot clock violations.
As was the case at Tuesday's
game, Cal went into the half
time with all of the momen
tum on its side, leading 39-31.
Junior bench player
Mikayla Lyles scored all 14 of
her points in the first half to
get Cal rolling. Sophomore
sensation Brittany Boyd led
all scoring for the Bears with
19 points. Gennifer Brandon
caused trouble for the Card
down low as she recorded a
double double with 14 points
and 12 rebounds.
A five-minute scoring
drought by Stanford with 10
minutes to play in the game
allowed Cal to extend the lead
to 13, and despite an increase
in intensity, the Card was
unable to cut into the lead
down the stretch.
"We have to get them
[shooters] open, we didn't
screen well enough," said
VanDerveer. "We struggled
offensively in that we didn't
run the things we wanted to
run. They are a very athletic,

quick, fast team, and they had
a very good game plan."

This loss ends the Card's
81-game win streak against
Pac-12 opponents and hands
Stanford its first back-to
back home losses since 2001.
Stanford's last conference
loss was also at the hands of
Cal in January 2009, and its
last double-digit home loss in
conference was a 72-57 loss
against the Bears in
February 2007.
"The most painful loss on
this court was not Cal, not
this game," YanDerveer said.
"It's probably playing
Florida State, losing to
Minnesota here, losing a
tournament game ... we just
have to recover from this
game and go on to UCLA
and USC."
Stanford will look to
regroup from the loss and
continue Pac-12 play as it
takes on UCLA 8 p.m. Friday
at Maples Pavilion.

[Cal] got their hands on the
ball, we weren't moving the
ball, we turned it over 16

there. Our last game, we took

they had more turnovers than
us. It's disappointing but I

Junior Toni Kokenis and
sophomore Amber Orrange
combined for 21 points; how
ever, Stanford's systematic
offense was shaken by Cal's
defense, which forced

turnovers early on and led to
multiple shot clock violations.
As was the case at Tuesday's
game, Cal went into the half
time with all of the momen
tum on its side, leading 39-31.
Junior bench player
Mikayla Lyles scored all 14 of
her points in the first half to
get Cal rolling. Sophomore
sensation Brittany Boyd led
all scoring for the Bears with
19 points. Gennifer Brandon
caused trouble for the Card
down low as she recorded a
double double with 14 points
and 12 rebounds.
A five-minute scoring
drought by Stanford with 10
minutes to play in the game
allowed Cal to extend the lead
to 13, and despite an increase
in intensity, the Card was
unable to cut into the lead
down the stretch.
"We have to get them
[shooters] open, we didn't
screen well enough," said
VanDerveer. "We struggled
offensively in that we didn't
run the things we wanted to
run. They are a very athletic,

quick, fast team, and they had
a very good game plan."

This loss ends the Card's
81-game win streak against
Pac-12 opponents and hands
Stanford its first back-to
back home losses since 2001.
Stanford's last conference
loss was also at the hands of
Cal in January 2009, and its
last double-digit home loss in
conference was a 72-57 loss
against the Bears in
February 2007.
"The most painful loss on
this court was not Cal, not
this game," YanDerveer said.
"It's probably playing
Florida State, losing to
Minnesota here, losing a
tournament game ... we just
have to recover from this
game and go on to UCLA
and USC."
Stanford will look to
regroup from the loss and
continue Pac-12 play as it
takes on UCLA 8 p.m. Friday
at Maples Pavilion.

shoulders but...we have
to be a balanced team.

It is a commonly held belief in sports that it is
very challenging to beat the same team twice in a
row. Stanford's football team was able to pull off
the difficult double against UCLA in the Pac-12
Championship. The women's basketball team
was not so fortunate; after beating rival
California on Tuesday, the Cardinal (14-2, 3-1
Pac-12) came up short on Sunday, 67-55.

From the start, high-intensity defense allowed
quick transition baskets for both teams. However,
Cal (13-2, 3-1) was able to capitalize on second
chance points as they out-rebounded the Card on
the offensive glass 20-12.
"We struggled the whole game running our
offense," said head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
really have to have guard leadership where they
come down and are vocal and get us into things
and are making things happen, and maybe defen
sively getting a turnover, and taking ownership a
little bit. We were slow, we weren't getting easy
shots, we weren't getting boards, we weren't get
ting run outs or moving the ball to get good shots,
and they were much more physical than we
were."
VanDerveer substituted early and often to try
to find a group of five that could mesh with the
powerful play of junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike, but once again the task of carrying
the team was left on her shoulders. Despite
aggressive Cal double and triple teams placed on
Ogwumike, she finished the game with 18 points
and nine rebounds, just missing her 12th double
double of the season.
"I put a lot on my shoulders but at the same
time I know I can't do that because we have to
become a balanced team," Ogwumike said. "One

that they'll have the same fire

Ogwumike struggled to
get good looks inside the
paint as Cal's posts targeted
her from start to finish. But
Stanford's guards struggled
to knock down outside shots
in order to take some of the
defensive pressure off
Ogwumike, finishing 12-41
from the field (29 percent)
and just 2-12 from behind the
arc.
