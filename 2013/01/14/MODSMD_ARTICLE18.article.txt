## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Din and discord 
### Miles Unterreiner 
In last week's column, I suggest
ed that the origins of this
nation's unusually high levels of
gun violence may lie partly in the
erosion of the human connections
that make America cohere. This
week, I'd like to examine more
deeply the dangers of social disloca
tion in a nation grounded firmly in
diversity and individualism and to
ask, as Lincoln once did, whether
any nation so conceived and so dedi
cated can long endure.
The relative absence of unifying
coercive mechanisms or natural cul
tural affinities in this country has
generally meant that the ties that
bind us to our fellow Americans
must be forged freely and voluntari
ly. "Americans of all ages, all condi
tions, and all dispositions constantly
form associations," observed de
Tocqueville in 1835. "They have not
only commercial and manufacturing
companies, in which all take part, but
associations of a thousand other
kinds, religious, moral, serious,
futile, general or restricted, enor
mous or diminutive."
The unifying social purpose of
the German Volk or the Soviet pro
letariat has been fulfilled in America
by the church, the sports team, the
labor union, the company, the family,
the Elks Club and the millions of
other associative groups that give
individual lives a larger meaning.
But amid the cultural upheaval of
the 19605, many sociologists argue,
that old communal order began to
crumble, replaced by an increasingly
atomized society that valued solitude
over togetherness and withdrawal
over engagement. "I am a rock/I am
an island," sang Simon and
Garfunkel in 1965. "I've built walls/
A fortress deep and mighty/ That
none may penetrate/1 have no need
of friendship; friendship causes pain/
It's laughter, and it's loving I disdain
... I touch no one and no one touches
me."
With each man his own island,
the institutions that had bound soci
ety together began a long slide into
obsolescence, with communities
drifting further apart from one
another even as their own members
fled in droves. Political scientists, for
instance, have noted a marked
uptick in political party polarization,
with Democratic and Republican
legislators further apart on the ideo
logical spectrum than they have
been at any time since the 19205. At
the same time, a wave of political
"dealignment" since the 1960s has
sparked an exodus from both major
parties, with the number of inde
pendentsâ€” at 40 percent, an all
time high now outnumbering
both committed Republicans (27
percent) and die-hard Democrats (31
percent). The parties don't trust
each other anymore, and we sure
don't trust them.

The U.S. military, once the cru
cible of the Greatest Generation, has
undergone a seismic shift of similar
proportion. The abolition of the draft
has transformed the army into a
professional, all-volunteer force,
increasingly sequestered from civil

society with dangerous conse
quences. Lamenting "the modern
military's disjunction from
American society," Stanford History
Professor Emeritus David Kennedy
has observed that "history's most
potent military force can now be put
into the field by a society that scarce
ly breaks a sweat when it does so. We
can now wage war while putting at
risk very few of our sons and daugh
ters, none of whom is obliged to
serve."

The citizen and the soldier have
split; so have an increasing number
of husbands and wives. The meteoric
rise of divorce rates since 1965 has
resulted in a significant increase in
the number of single-parent families
even as the number of Americans
living completely alone, neither mar
ried nor cohabiting nor sharing a
space with roommates, has reached
an all-time high of 28 percent.
Not only do we increasingly live
alone, we dislike talking to people
who don't agree with us. Not talking
to them, as legal scholar Cass
Sunstein points out in his book
"Republic.com 2.0," has become eas
ier than ever, thanks to the comfort
able "echo chambers" and "informa
tion cocoons" of the internet, which
shelter us from the unpleasant
cacophony of dissenting voices. And
income inequality is at an all-time
high, dividing rich and poor into
extremes of stupendous luxury and
grinding poverty.
None of this, predictably, bodes
particularly well for society as a
whole. Psychologist Muzafer
Sharif's classic Robber's Cave
experiment demonstrated the perils
of inter-group competition and cele
brated the benefits of intra-group
cooperation: people are happier and
less violent, in short, when we feel
connected and dedicated to a com
mon goal. The less united we feel,
the more prone we are to societal
violence.
The very nature of voluntary
social disintegration, unfortunately,
makes it one of the problems least
amenable to solution by political
means. Forcing people to associate
violates core American traditions
and values; the strength of our com
munities has been reinforced, as de
Tocqueville noted, by the fact that
we actively and freely join them.
Next week, I'll take a look at analyz
ing some tentative solutions.
"No man is an island," wrote
English poet John Donne. "Any
maris death diminishes me/because
I am involved in mankind./ And
therefore never send to know for
whom/ the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
How right, and how prescient, he
was.
