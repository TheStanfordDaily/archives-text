# Stern to host SLE-styled program next fall
## 
### LUCY SVOBODA 
Stanford will launch two new year
long residential programs for fresh
men, modeled off of the well-reviewed
Structure Liberal Education (SLE)
curriculum, next fall.
One, titled "Immersion in the
Arts: Living in Culture" (ITALIC),
will focus on the arts and will be led by
a team of faculty drawn from the
dance, art and music departments.
The other, called "Science In The
Making: Integrated Learning
Environment" (SIMILE), will revolve
around the history of science, a topic
University administrators hope will
bridge a perceived divide between the
humanities and the sciences on cam
pus.
Both will be housed in Burbank,

currently an un-themed all-freshman
dorm, and accept approximately 45
members from the Class of 2017.
Creating a "buzz" about Burbank
Dance professor Janice Ross, one
of the three main faculty members
heading ITALIC, talked about how
the new programs hope to transform
Burbank both physically and cul
turally.
The University plans to turn the
basement of the residence into a series
of art labs and a portion of Stern din
ing hall into a flexible space for per
formances and rehearsals. These
changes will allow students to collabo
rate on art projects in their own resi
dence.

"It will be like having... an art com
mune community dropped into the

midst of Stanford," Ross said. "Down
the hall, you'll have people working on
music while you're working on dance."
"I think that Burbank will have a
certain buzz about it, so that there is
not an end to the art-making or the
conversation or the art-consuming
when class ends or when evening
comes," she added. "I think it is going
to saturate the culture there and will

"I think that Burbank will have a
certain buzz about it, so that there is
not an end to the art-making or the
conversation or the art-consuming
when class ends or when evening
comes," she added. "I think it is going
to saturate the culture there and will
be a benefit for everyone who passes
through Burbank."
Paula Findlen, a history professor
and one of the leaders of SIMILE,
said she hopes the new programs will
capitalize on the dorm atmosphere.
"There will be more opportunities
for students to continue conversations
with us over lunch or anywhere in the
dorm," Findlen said. "If you are look
ing for an experience that is going to

have lots of direct contact with faculty
and opportunities to talk to them
not just about the course, but general
ly about your freshman experience at
Stanford I think these residential
programs are going to be terrific for
that."
Following the success of SLE
The move follows a recommenda
tion made last January by the Study
of Undergraduate of Education at
Stanford (SUES) committee, which
was tasked in 2010 with evaluating
the essential aspects of a Stanford
education. The committee's report
heralded the success of SLE, a resi
dential program based in Florence
Moore Hall that has been operating
since 1974.
Citing student and alumni surveys,

the report suggested offering more
programs like SLE, which integrates
learning into a student's residential
environment.
"The point... is not that all fresh
men should be enrolled in SLE, which
flourishes precisely because it is a
small, alternative program that stu
dents choose to join," the committee
members wrote. "But the experience
did prompt us to ask whether some of
the elements that make SLE so suc
cessful might be replicated in other
freshman residences."
The committee recommended the
University to take the structure of the
SLE curriculum and apply it to other
thematic areas. SLE is focused on the
humanities classics.
"The SUES report found
that one of the most successful
freshman programs in the last
30 years was SLE," said Vice
Provost of Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam. "The
hope is to create other pro
grams like SLE that have the
same investment in intellectual
learning, which is reinforced
by the residential nature of the
program."
Like SLE, both of the
upcoming programs will allow
freshmen to fulfill several
requirements, including
Thinking Matters, Program in
Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) 1
and some of the University's
new general education elec
tives that will take effect next
fall.

These new programs, how
ever, will have a more relaxed
unit requirement than SLE.
Both will require five units in
the fall and winter quarters
and six units in the spring.
SLE requires nine units every
quarter.

"We want to be facilitating
the idea that requirements
should be fulfilled in an easy
and interesting way that con
tinues to open up lots of room
in your curriculum to take
other things that you are inter
ested in, and not just courses
that fulfill requirements," said
Findlen.

An interdisciplinaiy approach
While ITALIC will focus
specifically on the arts and
SIMILE will concentrate on
the history of science, both
programs are looking to accept
students from a wide range of
interests and expose them to a
variety of disciplines.
"The goal of ITALIC was
never for it to be a recruitment
vehicle for art majors," Ross
said. "We want to instill in stu
dents a consciousness from the
very beginning of how to make
a rich and full life at the same
time as they are trying to get
the skills to make a living."
"Our hope is that it is going
to be a new model that makes
the arts really fun, that makes
the arts absolutely central, but
still allows students to take in
the richness of the university,"
she added.
Findlen also stressed the
importance of an interdiscipli
nary approach.
"One of the great things
about the history of science is
that it is a prism into a lot of
different disciplines," Findlen
said. "It allows students from
all backgrounds to start think
ing about the value of history
as a window into the world."
The University hopes to
bridge the perceived "fuzzie"
and "techie" divide through
SIMILE.
"We want students to
understand that science does
n't happen in a vacuum," Elam
said. "The goal of SIMILE is
to bridge the relationship
between science and the

humanities by allowing stu
dents to think historically
about the context and the his
tory that surrounded certain
scientific discoveries."

The programs plan to
share speakers, collaborate on
events and work together to
understand the differences
between and similarities in
wilting reports in the science
and ait disciplines.
"We really hope that we
can do exciting things together
to work to continue to break
down the idea that these are
distinctly different things,"
said Findlen. "Instead, we
hope students can see them as
complementary and intersect
ing ways of thinking about the
world."

If successful, programs like
ITALIC and SIMILE
referred to as "integrated
learning environments" (ILE)
have the potential to trans
form the freshmen experience,
as well as the face of liberal
arts education at Stanford.
"What we understand and
appreciate in what the SUES
document points out is that
the freshmen year is a really
important time to discover, to
take risks, to think about a
variety of subjects and to not
get locked in to a certain area
of study," Elam said. "ILEs
offer a unique way to do that
by allowing freshman to
experiment, focus and think
critically"
