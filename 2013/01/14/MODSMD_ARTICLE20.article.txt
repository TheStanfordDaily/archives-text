# OP-ED
## ROTC and the academy are compatible 
### DOMINICK HEALEY Georgetown University 
In my four years as a cadet in
Georgetown's ROTC program,
I largely ignored the debate
over ROTC at institutions that had
banned the program from their
campuses. I was pleased to stumble
across an article this week detailing
how Stanford had begun to ease life
for its small platoon of ROTC
cadets, which led me to start comb
ing through some related links.
After a quick perusing of the
"Stanford Says No To War" website,
I found myself laughing at the
absurdity of "evidence" being pre
sented against the ROTC program
at Stanford, and find myself com
pelled to respond in a public forum
to this specific organization's thesis.
I am a Bostonian. Most people
would classify me as a liberal. I am a
history major (Medieval focus) and
my ultimate aspiration is to earn my
Ph.D. and teach in Harvard's
Medieval Studies program.
Georgetown's ROTC program is
probably single-handedly responsi
ble for stimulating the development
of my academic habits. As both a
Dean's List student and platoon
leader, it was quite surprising to
learn about the apparent "intellectu
al distancing" of the military from
civil society, as suggested by
"Stanford Says No To War." Those
military science courses I'd been
taking, it turns out, "do not reflect
any of the disinterested academic
objectives of Stanford's own under
graduate curriculum, such as knowl
edge for knowledge's sake, [or] stu
dent-driven engagement with the
'significant issues, themes, ideas and
values of human identity and exis
tence.'"

It seems rash for "Stanford Says
No To War" to make such an
absolute statement regarding the
ROTC course curriculum, especially
when the inaccuracy of that state
ment makes it obvious that SSNW
is completely ignorant of the actual
content of that military science cur
riculum. The most basic tool of the
empathetic scholar is knowledge. In
my military science courses, we
spent the majority of our time dis
cussing the philosophy of ethics, the
politics of the Near East, the history
of our nation and even got to slip in
some theology with a 25-page paper
on the injustice of the Iraq War
within the framework of Walzer's

just war theory. I fail to see how the
study of history, philosophy, theolo
gy and political science falls outside
of the realm of "significant issues,
themes, ideas and values of human
identity and existence." Our profes
sor was no fascist cave dweller; he
was a very evenhanded and fair offi
cer with a Ph.D., a former speech
writer for the Army Chief of Staff. I
had as much respect for him as both
a person and academic as I've ever
had for any college professor. All
opinions in his class were given their
fair due, and the seminar-style dis
course of the course was conducted
well within the academic standards
of our university.
The conclusions made regarding
the "intellectual distancing" of the
military from civil society are
absurd. According to the National
Center for Education Statistics, mil
itary personnel and veterans have a
higher proportion of high school
degrees, Master's degrees, degrees
from private institutions and cur
rent enrollment in programs of
higher education than do their civil
ian counterparts. Probably most
shocking to the "Stanford Says No
To War" organization is the fact that
military service has provided the
opportunities for a far higher pro
portion of its serving minorities to
receive college educations than their
counterparts in "civil society." Brash
conclusions about the "intellectual
distancing" of the military from civil
society have no place in the body of
published academic material.
This is my personal and unre

strained opinion of "Stanford Says
No To War." I don't want, nor do I
need, your approval or your enlight
enment. I'll not bore you with some
sob-story about how I'm "fighting
for your freedom." We're all free to
think what we want, and for me to
say otherwise would make me the
greatest hypocrite of all. The only
thing I request from you is honesty.
Delete all that "evidence" on
your website and post a giant ban
ner centered in bold bearing the
truth: "We don't want ROTC on
campus because we don't like war."
That is a fair and honest opinion that
we can all respect.
But in a more practical sense,
just remember this: you can avoid
us military officers now, but you
won't be able to forever. You are
going to find out that there was a
whole population of men and women
who were developing themselves at
light speed while you were trying to
shut them out, and you will be com
peting with thousands of us in the
real world. We keep our hair cut
close, we keep our faces shaved
clean and we keep our bodies in
shape. We can wake up at 0530 any
day of the week, work a 20-hour day
and then do it over and over and
over again. We don't need vacations,
we don't need weekends, we never
sleep through our alarms and we're
never late for appointments. We're
respectful, we're honorable, we
serve others selflessly, we always
tell the truth, we know how to shake
hands, we know how to speak pub
licly, we're excellent managers and
we're excellent leaders. We'll be
responsible for 50 people and mil
lions of dollars of equipment, on our
first day. We'll have real people's
lives in our hands, we don't break
under pressure, we make the right
decision quickly and we're highly
trained at applying our highly edu
cated minds to highly challenging
problems. We'll have done all this
before we're 25 years old. We very
much prefer for you to be our
friends, and we think you will too. To
Stanford University, thank you for
your efforts to reintegrate ROTC,
and to the Stanford platoon's cadets:
drive on, because Georgetown
ROTC's got your back.
