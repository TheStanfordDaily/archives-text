# COME AND GET YOUR COOTIE SHOT
## Love thy neighbor... Dealing with dormcest 
### Roxanna Reaves | STAFF WRITER 
Dormcest... it'll get the best of most of us.
When you move in to a new dorm, every
one tells themselves, "Nah, I couldn't.
These people are, like, my new family. Yeah, my
neighbor's cute, but... we're just such good
friends," and you were for about two months.
Maybe three months. And then, lo and behold, one
night on flat row, things got very out of control,
and now you two aren't quite sure where to go from
here. Let's look at the options:
Case A: You like him, but you're not sure if
he's into you too.
You've got to be real sure you want to go down
this road. Once you let a neighbor know you're
actually interested in him, things will either go great
or sour really fast. Be prepared for things to escalate
quickly, because it's only natural that because you
two are in such close quarters that things will move
faster than with someone from another dorm.
It's not too late to decide the timing isn't right
and that maybe you both are probably just better
off friends. But in case you really do want to take
the next step with him and keep the romance alive,
try casually surprising your crush with a cup of coffee
or a pastry from Coupa one day. If he responds posi
tively and accepts the gift without any weirdness, or
even offers to reciprocate in the future, it's a pretty good
sign that he's interested in more too. If he greets your
gift with hesitation or acts flat-out unappreciative,
it's time to move on. Either way, you aren't left won
dering anymore what that flirty tryst really meant.
Case B: It was all just a big misunderstand
ing.
After a week, it's finally comfortable to make
eye contact. In three weeks, you guys are starting to
say hi again. Everyone in the dorm is sensing the
total awkwardness between you two and makes

absolutely no attempt at being subtle when they
pester you about what happened. Both you and
your partner-in-dormcest-crime should decide to
blame it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol and chalk it
up to a fun night that never has to be revisited. Two
months after the act, both of you look at each other
and say, "We cool?" And, well, that's just the best
way to see the end of that.
Case C: Worst. Case. Scenario.
You both awake in an unknown location. You
only remember bits and pieces of the encounter,
but what you do remember wasn't pretty. Your
dorm mate, however, looks enthused ... too
enthused, in fact. They brag to their friends about
the "sensually liberating experience" you two
shared, only their friends are your friends, and you
have quite a different story to share. All of a sudden,
everyone knows a little too much about your per
sonal life. Your RA comes to ask you how long you
two have been hiding your love for each other. After
an awkward silence, you excuse yourself to leave for
an appointment at Vaden, where you learn you have
contracted crabs.
Case D: Best Case Scenario! (Don't keep your
hopes up for this one.)
Your friends notice that the two of you have a
constant glow for the next month. You smell roses
everywhere you go, and the sun has never shone so
brightly. You two get married at MemChu five years
later and live happily ever after.
It's good to be close to your dorm just
beware of getting a little too close. Even when
hooking up with that cutie next door seems like a
good idea tonight, it may not turn out so well in the
morning. Make sure to take your time and think it
through.
