# WE CAN BE CULTURED TOO
## THE
						BEST ART MUSEUM YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF

Susan Jaques 'BO turned her passion for art into a
new book, "A Love for the Beautiful:
Discovering America's Hidden Art
Museums," which was released in November. After earn
ing a degree in history from Stanford and an MBA from
UCLA, Jaques turned to journalism. Her specialty is travel
journalism, and she has written about museums abroad for
American newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and
the Chicago Tribune.
During her travels, she began to notice how she made
a beeline for the art museums. In her debut novel, Jaques
wanted to "introduce people to American museums that
they might not have heard about before."
The idea for the book started at the Dali Museum in
St. Petersburg, Florida. Jaques was curious why was the
most comprehensive Dali collection outside of Spain hiding
in a warehouse in the small resort town? She began to poke
around and discovered that the Midwestern collectors could
not find a museum willing to accept their donation. At the
time, Dali was considered eccentric and was largely dis
missed by the art establishment. The town of St. Petersburg
promised to keep the collection together and turned a boat
repair warehouse into museum, opening in 1982. Now,
Dali's masterpieces are housed in a building designed by

Yann Weyouth several blocks north.
"That story taught me about changes in art tastes. It
taught me about collecting, and made me start to think that
there might be other museums out there that were similar.
Under the radar, remarkable art collections that might be
worth sharing with people," Jacques said.
With this goal in mind, Jaques began reading artist
biographies, taking classes at UCLA and attending lectures
at the Getty in Los Angeles. She started a list of museums
and planned a road trip. At every museum she visited, she
spoke to museum professionals and curators, who gave her
more hidden museums to add to research and visit. Over
two years later, she was able to narrow them down to 50,
dividing them by specialization and genre.
"These museums are not encyclopedic," Jaques
explained. "They are not trying to have everything.
Generally, the smaller museums tend to be exceptional in
very specific areas ... [The book] starts with antiquities,
American art, Asian art, African art, contemporary art and
so on. I'm trying to highlight collections that are exceptional
in those areas."
Of the 50 museums, 30 states are represented. Ten
museums were founded by women. Fourteen are located on
college campuses. Stanford's Cantor Art Center merits its

own profile in the sculpture section, largely due to the
Rodin collection, which includes "The Gates of Hell,"
"Burghers of Calais" and "The Thinker."
"What really fascinated me was the history behind the
museums, how these collections wound up where they did
and how the collectors amassed their collections," Jaques
said.
The Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme,
Connecticut, holds a special place in Jaques's heart, and a
painting of the museum by Willard Metcalf graces the cover
of the book. Previously a boardinghouse for artists who
painted the surrounding countryside, Florence Griswold's
home is now a hidden gem, specializing in American
Impressionism.
"Part of the joy of doing this book was that I learned
so much about art genres that I was less familiar with,"
Jaques said. "Here at Stanford I took American art, and I
was familiar with Western and European art. In doing the
book, I made an effort to include non-Western art genres. I
think there's something for everybody here. It's pretty much
the gamut of art history, as seen through America's smaller
art museums."
Jaques is currently working on her second book, which
will focus on the relationship between artists and collectors.
