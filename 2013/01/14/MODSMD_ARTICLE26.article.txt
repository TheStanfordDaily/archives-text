Stanford campus' latest addition,
Bing Concert Hall, officially
opened its doors Friday and had sev
eral performances of student and pro
fessional groups throughout the
weekend.

Designed by Richard Olcott,
with acoustic design by Yasuhisa
Toyota and theatrical design by Fisher
Dachs Associates, Bing Concert Hall is
modeled after a clearing in the woods,
its architecture rooted in the land
scape. 842 seats in a "vineyard" format
encircle the stage, creating a space
where artist and audience can experi
ence each other with new intimacy.

Decked out in suits and ball
gowns, with the occasional Stanford
sweatshirt, Friday's audience, which
included donors, community mem
bers, faculty and students, was treated
to a program featuring the Stanford
Chamber Chorale, the St. Lawrence
String Quartet and the San Francisco
Symphony, led by internationally
acclaimed director and conductor

Michael Tilson Thomas.
The Opening Night Celebration
was the hall's first official full-length
performance. Honoring Helen and
Peter Bing '55, who donated $5O mil
lion to build the world-class venue,
Stanford professor Jonathan Berger
set Peter Bing's words from the 2010
groundbreaking ceremony to music
with "A Place of Concert," which was
performed by the Chamber Chorale
and composed specifically for the
space.
Bing, who spoke briefly after
President Hennessy, emphasized the
concert hall as a place for friendships
to flourish.
The first piece of the concert,
entitled "Fugue 1," celebrated the
opening of Bing Concert Hall with
themes composed by Chris Chafe
D.M.A. 'B3 and Fernando Lopez-
Lezcano at the Stanford Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA).
Stav Ziv 'll, the arts and student
life coordinator for the Stanford Arts
Institute, said that Bing Concert Hall
exhibited Stanford's commitment to
bringing the arts to campus and inte
grating art with student life. Bing
Concert Hall is a result of the
Stanford Arts Initiative, a university
wide fundraising effort launched in
2006.

For students who want to get
involved, the Bing Student
Ambassadors program enables stu
dents to give feedback about how
Bing is impacting student life and to
plan events for students. For Ziv, the
experiences Bing Concert Flail will
provide for the entirety of the
Stanford community are unparalleled.
"Having a world-class concert
hall is an incredible opportunity to
hear art of the highest caliber," she
said.
In addition to performing, many
artists will have workshops, lectures
and events in order to further involve
the community. From January 24-26,
percussionist Glenn Kotche will both
offer a workshop for students and
then perform a solo show. More plans
for involving students at Bing are in
the works, including a potential arts
party planned by the Student
Organizing Committee, known for
organizing the Party on the Edge at
Cantor Arts Center. The Inaugural
2013 Season at the Bing will include
pianist Emanuel Ax, cellist Yo-Yo Ma
and a 14-performance "Beethoven
Project."
As Stanford's new "front door,"
Bing Concert Hall looks to live up to
its role as the campus center of artistic

appreciation, education, and innova
tion.
