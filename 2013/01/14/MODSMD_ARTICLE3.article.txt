### DANNY GIFFORD 
The P&lo Alto City Council elected
Councilman Greg Scharff as mayor of
Palo Alto for the upcoming year on Jan.
7. The nine-member council selected
Scharff who has served on the council
since 2010 and as outgoing Mayor
Yiaway Teh's vice mayor during 2012,
in a unanimous vote.
"It feels great [to be elected unani
mously]," Scharff said. "I have great
colleagues, and we all work really well
together."
In contrast to many other council
men, Scharff had not been involved in
public service before running for City
Council. He credited his rapid ascension
to mayor to his dedication and persever
ance in working to improve IMo Alto.
"I think [my colleagues] recognized
my commitment to Palo Alto and that I
am really working hard to do what I can
for the city" he said.
Councilwoman Nancy Shepherd,
who was elected Scharff's vice mayor in
a 6-3 vote, agreed.
"I see [Scharff] as a good mediator of
all of our interests," she said. "Greg will
be a lot of fun to work with and good rep
resentation for the city of Palo Alto."
According to Scharff] he and
Shepherd, who campaigned together
and worked together on many issues
over the last three years, will make an
effective leadership team.
"[Shepherd and I] served on the
finance committee together, we've
worked on infrastructure issues, we've
worked on the budget together, we
worked on utility issues together.
There's been a whole range of things,"
he said. "We work really well together."
Despite their election, Scharff and
Shepherd remain on fairly equal foot
ing with their colleagues; every mem
ber of the Palo Alto City Council has
just one vote, including the mayor and
vice mayor. The mayor's added respon
sibilities, according to Scharff] instead
include "running the meetings, speak
ing on behalf of the city on a number of
issues and advocating regionally for the
city"
Scharff has experience advocating
for Palo Alto's needs. In partnership
with Stanford, Scharff and the
council submitted a proposal to
Santa Clara County for a fund
to make Palo Alto and Stanford
more inviting for bicyclists
and received $lO million in
funding.
"[The Bicycle and
Pedestrian Transportation Plan]
will make Palo Alto one of the
top bike-friendly cities in the
nation," Scharff said.
In addition to implementing
the bicycle plan, Scharff said the
council plans to achieve carbon
neutrality for the city's electric
utility fix the city's infrastruc
ture issues and work toward fis
cal sustainability during his
tenure, though he may be limit
ed by the brevity of his one-year
term.
"I think people would always
like more time to try and get
stuff done. I don't think there's
any question about that," he
said. "But, you know, you're
typically mayor for a year, and I
basically feel that we need to
get enough done as we possibly

can."
The reason he would likely
not run for reelection is the
Palo Alto tradition of the vice
mayor assuming the mayor's
position at the end of the term,
a tradition Shepherd hopes to
continue.
"I don't know if there's been
an experience where that hasn't
happened," she said, "I certainly
would love [to serve as mayor].
It's an honor to not just serve
on city council... but to be elect
ed vice mayor, and to be elected
mayor would be an even bigger
honor... but again, it will be an
independent election next
year."
The group will be losing Yeh,
who will move to Nashville after
five years of service. Shepherd
said that the council will be hurt
by his absence.
"Mayor Y?h was just a spark
of innovative youth, bringing the
city council perspective," she
said. "He brings a great under
standing of how to move agen
das forward and get consensus
and build cooperation between
colleagues... I will miss him; [he
was] well respected by all of the
colleagues."
Still, Scharff has high hopes
for the coming year.

'At the end of 2013,1 want to
look back and say 'We've accom
plished a lot We've tackled the
hard issues and the lingering
issues,"' he said. "I want to basi
cally say that 2013 was the year
we get things done."
