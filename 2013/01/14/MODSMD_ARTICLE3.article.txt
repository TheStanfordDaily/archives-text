### DANNY GIFFORD 
The P&lo Alto City Council elected
Councilman Greg Scharff as mayor of
Palo Alto for the upcoming year on Jan.
7. The nine-member council selected
Scharff who has served on the council
since 2010 and as outgoing Mayor
Yiaway Teh's vice mayor during 2012,
in a unanimous vote.
"It feels great [to be elected unani
mously]," Scharff said. "I have great
colleagues, and we all work really well
together."
In contrast to many other council
men, Scharff had not been involved in
public service before running for City
Council. He credited his rapid ascension
to mayor to his dedication and persever
ance in working to improve IMo Alto.
"I think [my colleagues] recognized
my commitment to Palo Alto and that I
am really working hard to do what I can
for the city" he said.
Councilwoman Nancy Shepherd,
who was elected Scharff's vice mayor in
a 6-3 vote, agreed.
"I see [Scharff] as a good mediator of
all of our interests," she said. "Greg will
be a lot of fun to work with and good rep
resentation for the city of Palo Alto."
According to Scharff] he and
Shepherd, who campaigned together
and worked together on many issues
over the last three years, will make an
effective leadership team.
"[Shepherd and I] served on the
finance committee together, we've
worked on infrastructure issues, we've
worked on the budget together, we
worked on utility issues together.
There's been a whole range of things,"
he said. "We work really well together."
Despite their election, Scharff and
Shepherd remain on fairly equal foot
ing with their colleagues; every mem
ber of the Palo Alto City Council has
just one vote, including the mayor and
vice mayor. The mayor's added respon
sibilities, according to Scharff] instead
include "running the meetings, speak
ing on behalf of the city on a number of
issues and advocating regionally for the
city"
Scharff has experience advocating
for Palo Alto's needs. In partnership
