# Bing Concert Hall holds opening concert

### KATIE SALMON 
Michael Tilson Thomas, music director, San
Francisco Symphony orchestra
"We had a lovely, lovely experience. We just went out
there and started playing, and it was so exciting. We had a
lot of clarity and ability to really discern the quality of each
section of the orchestra. We look forward to being back here
more and really having a little more time to exalt in this
beautiful space."
John Adams, composer
"This year Stanford finally, in addition to all the fantastic
facilities they have, [has] a great facility for the performing
arts. It took a lot of time, and we're very thrilled to be here,
and I particularly thought that the San Francisco Symphony
sounded just fantastic tonight."
Yasuhisa Toyota, Bing Concert Hall chief acousti
cian
"First of all, I'm so happy. I'm so happy, because this is
just the beginning. For instance, the string quartet did a very
good job, but still, when I heard them rehearse here, a cou
ple months ago, the ensemble sounds much better today. It
means that it is still going up. So this is just in the start. I
hope that I can come back to listen to music more... every
thing will be more fruitful."
Jennifer Brody, chair of the dance and theater
performance department
"I think [Bing Concert Hall's opening] marks the beginning
of a new era in the arts and that I'm pleased that it's going
to be an interdisciplinary space and that it's able to draw so
much fellowship and good work."

Timothy Hartung, Bing Concert Hall architect
"It's fantastic, it's very intimate and it's aesthetically
very wonderful and just seeing it full of people and seeing
their faces and hearing the music it's a fantastic
experience."
Lesley Robertson, St. Lawrence String Quartet
(Viola)
"It's a spectacular venue, and we're very richly rewarded
here; it's such a gift to the community, to the Stanford stu
dents, faculty and community. It's fantastic; we couldn't be
happier. I wouldn't say it's a new beginning because it's
always been a vibrant scene here, but it's coming together
and we couldn't ask for a more beautiful setting. [Bing
Concert Hall] is just perfect, really, for chamber music any
way, and we're loving it."
