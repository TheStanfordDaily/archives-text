## Twelve student groups apply for ASSU'S '80k challenge' 
### OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Twelve student groups submitted applications
for funding in the first round of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate's initiative to spend a part of
the $1.2 million in its general fees reserve and buffer
funds.
Applications for the project, "Redefining
Student Life: The 80K Challenge," were open to
general fees groups hosting winter events.
Groups were given the opportunity to apply for
more funding than the $6,000 they can receive
through general fees allocation.
The majority of the applications were received

between 5 p.m. and midnight on the day of the dead
line, according to Appropriations Committee Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4. Pham said that the Senate had
hoped to receive at least eight applications and
was pleasantly surprised when they received
more.
"Getting more than eight is definitely a good
thing," said Appropriations Committee Deputy
Chair Christos Haveles 'l5. "There is more com
petition in the quality of the applications, but at
the same time, each application is going to be con
sidered if it meets our standards and will not be
compared to another group."
The Appropriations Committee expects to
receive more applications for a similar program for

spring quarter. The deadline for spring quarter
applications is Jan. 18, and the Senate has received
one application thus far.
The committee will review the grant proposals
at a meeting on Jan. 15 and announce the grant
recipients on Jan. 22. Interviews of grant applicants
will be conducted on Jan. 16 and 17, and the commit
tee will recommend groups for the Senate's
approval at their Jan. 22 meeting.
Pham could not yet predict whether the commit
tee will recommend that the entire $40,000 allocated
for winter quarter events be given in grants. The
Senate did not limit the amount that groups could
request, but estimated that the
average grant amount was
$5,000. Pham said that the
committee would not recom
mend all proposals just to use
the entire grant budget.
"We want to make sure this
extra funding is spent the right
way and put to good use," she
said.
Haveles agreed, adding
that granting money to any
group that applied would "set
the wrong message for the
future."
