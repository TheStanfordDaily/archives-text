## CA budget to benefit education Proposed budget and policies give funds to schools in need 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
California Governor Jerry
Brown announced a proposal last
week for a balanced 2013-14 state
budget, directing more funding into
education.
Along with the budget, the gov
ernor proposed a set of policy
changes based on a report co
written by former Stanford educa
tion professor Michael Kirst, cur
rently the president of the
California State Board of
Education that would grant
additional funding to schools with a
high concentration of low-income
and English learner students.
"It is really a comprehensive
overhaul of the school finance sys
tem and the largest change since
the passing of Proposition 13 in
1978," Kirst said.
The governor's budget proposal
provides $2.7 billion next year for
K-12 schools and community col
leges and $l9 billion by 2016-2017,
according to a state press release.
Much of the additional funding
comes from Proposition 30, which
passed in the November 2012 elec
tion and raises income taxes for
education.
David Plank, executive director
of Policy Analysis for California
Education and professor at the
Stanford School of Education, said
that the governor's proposal marks
a significant shift from the last five
years of education budget cuts.
"In an environment where
there is money, it is much easier to
talk about the way money gets dis
tributed," he said.
The new budget proposal
includes policy changes to the dis
tribution of educational funding,
including raising the amount of
individual student base grants
across all school districts and pro
viding an additional grant to
schools with over 50 percent of stu
dents who are low-income and
English learners.
The proposed distribution
change, especially the added sup
port for low-income and English
learner students, draws from a
research paper called "Reforming
California School Finance" co-writ
ten by Kirst in 2008. Kirst said that
providing more aid to these schools
marks a shift in the educational
finance system to become more
need-based.
"When you get done with all the
bells and whistles in the current
school finance program, it's pretty
much a flat grant with every pupil
getting a similar amount regard
less of their needs," Kirst said.
Plank explained that low
income and English learning stu
dents bring in problems they face
in their communities to the class
rooms, making it difficult for teach
ers to properly reach out and help
