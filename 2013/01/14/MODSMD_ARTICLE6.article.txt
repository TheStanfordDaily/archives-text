## CA budget to benefit education Proposed budget and policies give funds to schools in need 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
California Governor Jerry
Brown announced a proposal last
week for a balanced 2013-14 state
budget, directing more funding into
education.
Along with the budget, the gov
ernor proposed a set of policy
changes based on a report co
written by former Stanford educa
tion professor Michael Kirst, cur
rently the president of the
California State Board of
Education that would grant
additional funding to schools with a
high concentration of low-income
and English learner students.
"It is really a comprehensive
overhaul of the school finance sys
tem and the largest change since
the passing of Proposition 13 in
1978," Kirst said.
The governor's budget proposal
provides $2.7 billion next year for
K-12 schools and community col
leges and $l9 billion by 2016-2017,
according to a state press release.
Much of the additional funding
comes from Proposition 30, which
passed in the November 2012 elec
tion and raises income taxes for
education.
David Plank, executive director
of Policy Analysis for California
Education and professor at the
Stanford School of Education, said
that the governor's proposal marks
a significant shift from the last five
years of education budget cuts.
"In an environment where
there is money, it is much easier to
talk about the way money gets dis
tributed," he said.
The new budget proposal
includes policy changes to the dis
tribution of educational funding,
including raising the amount of
individual student base grants
across all school districts and pro
viding an additional grant to
schools with over 50 percent of stu
dents who are low-income and
English learners.
The proposed distribution
change, especially the added sup
port for low-income and English
learner students, draws from a
research paper called "Reforming
California School Finance" co-writ
ten by Kirst in 2008. Kirst said that
providing more aid to these schools
marks a shift in the educational
finance system to become more
need-based.
"When you get done with all the
bells and whistles in the current
school finance program, it's pretty
much a flat grant with every pupil
getting a similar amount regard
less of their needs," Kirst said.
Plank explained that low
income and English learning stu
dents bring in problems they face
in their communities to the class
rooms, making it difficult for teach
ers to properly reach out and help
them. He has been waiting for a
policy that addresses these con
cerns by providing these schools
with the needed funds to best serve
their students.
"It would be very good public
policy," Plank said. "The problem
with good public policy is that often
the politics don't work."
While Kirst is optimistic for the
policy changes to pass the legisla
ture, he recognized the opposition
from supporters of categorical pro
grams.
Categorical programs, such as
art education and vocational train
ing, are funded directly by the state.
Under the new policy proposal, cat
egorical funding for many of the 56
current programs would be elimi
nated, along with educational regu
lations around them. The funding
for these programs would instead
be included in the increased base
grants.
Plank also sees this part of the
proposal as a potential stumbling
block.
"People who think arts education
is really important, for example,
may be resistant to the governor's
proposal because now there is no
specific funding for aits education,"
Plank said.
With no direct state support for
these programs, Plank explains that
there is the possibility they cease to
exist, since it will now be up to indi
vidual school districts to decide
whether they should include them.

The Palo Alto Unified School
District, for instance, would no
longer be required to offer categor
ical programs like art education, nor
would it receive any state funds if
they chose to continue offering
them, Plank said.
On the other hand, should the
policy be approved by the legisla
ture, school districts within East
Palo Alto would benefit from addi
tional money to the base grant
increase that all state districts will
receive.
"This is a system that's
designed to help East Palo Alto,
ultimately at the expense of Palo
Alto, in the sense that some of the
money that Palo Alto gets will go to
East Palo Alto," Plank said.
The governor's inclusion of the
policy changes with the budget pro
posal was a strategic move to avoid
lobbying efforts that wish to pre
serve categorical funding, Plank
explained. If the legislature disap
proves of the combined proposals
within the next few weeks, any poli
cy changes would have to be drafted
into bills and undergo a longer
process for implementation.
Kirst said that with rising rev
enues and a balanced state budget,
this is the best time for the policy
proposal to win legislative votes. If
opposition from legislators does end
up killing the program, Kirst
pledged that he would continue the
work.
"We'll keep trying again," he
said. "The governor has one more
year left in office, and if we don't
win this time, we'll try again."

written by former Stanford educa
tion professor Michael Kirst, cur
rently the president of the
California State Board of
Education that would grant
additional funding to schools with a
high concentration of low-income
and English learner students.
"It is really a comprehensive
overhaul of the school finance sys
tem and the largest change since
the passing of Proposition 13 in
1978," Kirst said.
The governor's budget proposal
provides $2.7 billion next year for
K-12 schools and community col
leges and $l9 billion by 2016-2017,
according to a state press release.
Much of the additional funding
comes from Proposition 30, which
passed in the November 2012 elec
tion and raises income taxes for
education.
David Plank, executive director
of Policy Analysis for California
Education and professor at the
Stanford School of Education, said
that the governor's proposal marks
a significant shift from the last five
years of education budget cuts.
"In an environment where
there is money, it is much easier to
talk about the way money gets dis
tributed," he said.
The new budget proposal
includes policy changes to the dis
tribution of educational funding,
including raising the amount of
individual student base grants
across all school districts and pro
viding an additional grant to
schools with over 50 percent of stu
dents who are low-income and
English learners.
The proposed distribution
change, especially the added sup
port for low-income and English
learner students, draws from a
research paper called "Reforming
California School Finance" co-writ
ten by Kirst in 2008. Kirst said that
providing more aid to these schools
marks a shift in the educational
finance system to become more
need-based.
"When you get done with all the
bells and whistles in the current
school finance program, it's pretty
much a flat grant with every pupil
getting a similar amount regard
less of their needs," Kirst said.
Plank explained that low
income and English learning stu
dents bring in problems they face
in their communities to the class
rooms, making it difficult for teach
ers to properly reach out and help
them. He has been waiting for a
policy that addresses these con
cerns by providing these schools
with the needed funds to best serve
their students.
"It would be very good public
policy," Plank said. "The problem
with good public policy is that often
the politics don't work."
While Kirst is optimistic for the
policy changes to pass the legisla
ture, he recognized the opposition
from supporters of categorical pro
grams.
Categorical programs, such as
art education and vocational train
ing, are funded directly by the state.
Under the new policy proposal, cat
egorical funding for many of the 56
current programs would be elimi
nated, along with educational regu
lations around them. The funding
for these programs would instead
be included in the increased base
grants.
Plank also sees this part of the
proposal as a potential stumbling
block.
"People who think arts education
is really important, for example,
may be resistant to the governor's
proposal because now there is no
specific funding for aits education,"
Plank said.
With no direct state support for
these programs, Plank explains that
there is the possibility they cease to
exist, since it will now be up to indi
vidual school districts to decide
whether they should include them.

The Palo Alto Unified School
District, for instance, would no
longer be required to offer categor
ical programs like art education, nor
would it receive any state funds if
they chose to continue offering
them, Plank said.
On the other hand, should the
policy be approved by the legisla
ture, school districts within East
Palo Alto would benefit from addi
tional money to the base grant
increase that all state districts will
receive.
"This is a system that's
designed to help East Palo Alto,
ultimately at the expense of Palo
Alto, in the sense that some of the
money that Palo Alto gets will go to
East Palo Alto," Plank said.
The governor's inclusion of the
policy changes with the budget pro
posal was a strategic move to avoid
lobbying efforts that wish to pre
serve categorical funding, Plank
explained. If the legislature disap
proves of the combined proposals
within the next few weeks, any poli
cy changes would have to be drafted
into bills and undergo a longer
process for implementation.
Kirst said that with rising rev
enues and a balanced state budget,
this is the best time for the policy
proposal to win legislative votes. If
opposition from legislators does end
up killing the program, Kirst
pledged that he would continue the
work.
"We'll keep trying again," he
said. "The governor has one more
year left in office, and if we don't
win this time, we'll try again."
