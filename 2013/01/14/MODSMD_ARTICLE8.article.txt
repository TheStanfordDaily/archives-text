## From LA to the MLA: Roland Greene's academic journey 
### HELIN GAO 
"I never had a truly intellectual experience
until I went to college and I suddenly knew
what it was," Roland Greene said. "It was like
many other things in life like you eat food
every day, but you never have a truly culinary
experience until you eat what is cooked by a
true master chef."
Many years and intellectual experiences
later, Greene found himself elected to the pres
idency of the Modern Language Association
(MLA), a position he will assume in 2015.
Greene's childhood, spent tap dancing in
Los Angeles, held few hints of his future
career as endowed professor of English and
comparative literature here at Stanford,
author of four books and editor of more, and
founder of three literature workshops.
Greene grew up with his mother near West
Hollywood after his father passed away when
he was five years old. Living in a city famous
for its entertainment industry, Greene spent
years learning tap dancing with his mother's
encouragement. Even then, the young Greene
knew his passions lay elsewhere.
"After some time, I lost interest in [tap
dancing], and I didn't want to be a per
former," Greene said. 'As a child, I was always
kind of reflective and mostly quiet. I think I
wanted to somehow be a reader, a writer, a
thinker.
"Growing up in Los Angeles in that era,
when there were only five channels on the tel
evision, the media culture that I experienced
could be recognized from my daily life,"
Greene said. "I always I felt that I was the
center of something."
One of his most memorable experiences
was his encounter with Robert F. Kennedy the
day before his assassination at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. To the
then 10-year-old Greene, who admired
Kennedy as "a hero," it was a traumatic expe
rience.
Despite his attachment to Los Angeles, it
was not long before Greene had to contem
plate leaving his hometown to explore else
where for his higher education.
As a first-generation college student, the
prospective of going to college was a distant
dream. Describing himself as "quiet" and
"self-conscious," Greene was hesitant to ask

for advice on his college application. He
approached a high school literature teacher,
with low expectations.
"He asked me, what do you want to do
after high school, and I said very hesitantly
that I would like to go to UCLA," Greene
said, "I thought he would laugh at me and tell
me that I could not go there."
Greene went on to enroll at Brown
University in Rhode Island. It was then that
he started turning his full attention to an aca
demic pursuit.
"All things that mattered to me, like being
from Los Angeles, that media culture, all did
n't matter there," Greene said. "That sent me
to being more intellectual about things, for I
thought what we did have in common there
was that intellectual experience."
In fact, his mind was so occupied by his
intellectual interests that he had no time for
almost anything else
"I was a tremendous nerd," Greene said
with a grin. "I studied morning, noon and
night and I had almost no social life â€”by
choice."
For Greene though, the sacrifice of social
life was not too high a price to pay for intellec
tual exploration. Comparing his own intellec
tual dedication to that of his students today,
Greene lamented the fact that most students
now lack a spirit of intellectual curiosity piv
otal to the shaping of a scholar.
"I think that most students here or any
where else continue to go along and be good
students," Greene said. "But for the ones that
are [intellectually curious], you can connect
with them."
Despite his own scholarly achievements,
including his recent recognition within the
Modern Language Association, Greene's ded
ication to teaching shines through as his lega
cy. This dedication is most apparent when he
talks fondly about his past students.
"I just got an email from a former student
last quarter, who is now a novelist teaching at
Yale," Greene recounted. "He said in the
email, 'You may not remember me, but I was
just teaching undergraduates yesterday and I
found myself repeating to my students exact
ly something you taught in this course 23
years ago.' That was really gratifying."
