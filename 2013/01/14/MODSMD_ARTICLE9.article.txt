## Aaron Swartz, Stanford dropout, dies at 26 By THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
### â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Aaron Swartz, a prodigious programmer,
Internet activist and Stanford dropout, was
found dead in his Brooklyn apartment this
morning. He was 26.

Swartz's involvement in the creation of
RSS, at age 14, and Reddit earned him admira
tion within the technology community while his
activism frequently drew the ire of authorities.
According to the Stanford Alumni
Directory, Swartz enrolled at Stanford in 2004,
joining the class of 'OB. He spent his freshman
year at Roble Hall, documenting his experi
ences in a blog. Swartz's blog is an exploration
of the young man's thoughts on technology,
psychology, politics and university life, with
which he was often frustrated and dissatisfied.
He left Stanford at the end of his freshman
year, claiming he was unfulfilled by his peers.
"It's got some great professors, and I cer
tainly learned a bunch, but I didn't find it a very
intellectual atmosphere, since most of the other
kids seemed profoundly unconcerned with
their studies," he wrote.
As a part of Y-Combinator's inaugural
Summer Founders Program, he began work on
his startup, Infogami, but later left that project
to collaborate with the founders of Reddit, who
were also in the Y-Combinator program.
Reddit was eventually acquired by Conde
Nast, and after the acquisition, Swartz felt unable
to continue with Reddit, resigning in 2007.
His technology activism took many forms,
including the creation of Demand Progress, an
organization that campaigned for Internet
freedoms and involved itself in the protest
against the SOPA/PIPA bills. However, in his
fervor to realize his philosophy of genuinely
free access to information, he often encoun
tered troubles with the authorities.
In 2009, he was investigated by the FBI for
the release of millions of U.S. court documents
from the government's Public Access to Court
Electronic Records. No charges were filed, but
in 2011 he was indicted for illegally download
ing and publishing almost 5 million articles
from academic database JSTOR. At the time of
his death, the charges against Swartz were
pending and may have carried the penalties of
up to a million dollars and 35 years in prison.
"Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity and
brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity
for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept
injustice as inevitable these gifts made the
world, and our lives, far brighter," said Swartz's
partner and family, in their statement. "We're
grateful for our time with him, to those who
loved him and stood with him, and to all of those
who continue his work for a better world."
His funeral will be held Thesday at a syna
gogue in Highland Park, 111.
