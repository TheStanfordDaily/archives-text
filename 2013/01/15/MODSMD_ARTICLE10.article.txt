# FOOTBALL RELOADS
## TWO VERBALLY COMMIT 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football made a big
splash at the end of its main offi
cial visit weekend, landing verbal
commitments from two of its top
four remaining targets in the
class of 2013.
De La Salle (Concord) senior
tight end Austin Hooper and
Harvard-Westlake (Studio City)
senior center Thomas Oser both
committed early this week after
spending the weekend visiting
Stanford. Hooper, a four-star
recruit and member of the
ESPN3OO, could provide imme
diate help at the recently vacat
ed tight end position for the
Cardinal in 2013.
Hooper had narrowed his
focus to Bay Area rivals
Stanford and Cal. Most did not
expect a final decision for at least
a few weeks, pending a Stanford
admissions decision, but
Stanford accepted Hooper on
Friday. Once he had been accept
ed, Hooper decided to follow in
the footsteps of his uncle, Greg
Hooper, who played fullback for
Stanford in the 'Bos.

Oser, referred to by many
recruiting experts as "a true cen
ter," will also join a positional
group looking to replace its
starter, senior Sam
Schwartzstein. Coming into the
weekend, Oser was still deciding
between Oregon, Vanderbilt and
Stanford, but after two days on
the Farm, Oser was ready to
commit to David Shaw on
Sunday.
"Stanford was just a perfect
fit," Oser said Sunday night. "It's
a combination of a great pro
gram, great academics and great
people. It's an amazing place
that really felt like home."
Stanford's 2013 recruiting
class now has 12 verbal commit
ments. With National Signing
Day just over three weeks away,
the Cardinal is close to wrapping
up its class. Stanford has two big
battles remaining, tight end
Durham Smythe (Belton, Texas)
and wide receiver Devon Allen
(Phoenix, Ariz.).

the door for Stanford. The
consensus among recruiting
experts is that if Smythe is
admitted, he will pick
Stanford. With Stanford's
2013 tight end problems,
Smythe could be a difference
maker from day one on the
Farm.
Devon Allen is also an
intriguing prospect for
Stanford's 2013 plans.
Though his strength has yet
to fully develop, Allen's
speed has coaches drooling.
He is the Arizona state
record holder in the 110 m
and 300 m hurdles, and is
looking to also run track in
college.
Though Stanford relied
more heavily on its departing
tight ends, specifically Zach
Ertz, this season, Stanford
might lean on its receiving
corps to replace Ertz and
company. Ertz lined up at
wide receiver for many plays
this season as Stanford
struggled to find capable
replacements for Griff
Whalen 'l2 and Chris Owusu
'l2.
With or without Devon
Allen, Stanford does have at
least one heralded wide
receiver in its committed
class of 2013. Chris Owusu's
little brother, Frances, is ver
bally committed to play wide
receiver for Stanford next
year.
Overall, Stanford's class
is ranked 38th in the nation
by ESPN, which is a step
down from 2012's 12th over
all ranking. However, this
ranking is a bit misleading,
deflated by the small size of
Stanford's class, which is lim
ited by the number of schol
arships Stanford has avail
able.
Because seniors Ben
Gardner, Shayne Skov, Trent
Murphy and Usua Amanam,
among others, decided to
return to Stanford for a fifth
year, the Cardinal won't have
room on the roster, or on the
field, for nearly as many
freshman as 2012. That's a
trade most Stanford fans
would gladly take.
