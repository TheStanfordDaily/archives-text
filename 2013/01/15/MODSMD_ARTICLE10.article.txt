# FOOTBALL RELOADS
## TWO VERBALLY COMMIT 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford football made a big
splash at the end of its main offi
cial visit weekend, landing verbal
commitments from two of its top
four remaining targets in the
class of 2013.
De La Salle (Concord) senior
tight end Austin Hooper and
Harvard-Westlake (Studio City)
senior center Thomas Oser both
committed early this week after
spending the weekend visiting
Stanford. Hooper, a four-star
recruit and member of the
ESPN3OO, could provide imme
diate help at the recently vacat
ed tight end position for the
Cardinal in 2013.
Hooper had narrowed his
focus to Bay Area rivals
Stanford and Cal. Most did not
expect a final decision for at least
a few weeks, pending a Stanford
admissions decision, but
Stanford accepted Hooper on
Friday. Once he had been accept
ed, Hooper decided to follow in
the footsteps of his uncle, Greg
Hooper, who played fullback for
Stanford in the 'Bos.

Oser, referred to by many
recruiting experts as "a true cen
ter," will also join a positional
group looking to replace its
starter, senior Sam
Schwartzstein. Coming into the
weekend, Oser was still deciding
between Oregon, Vanderbilt and
Stanford, but after two days on
the Farm, Oser was ready to
commit to David Shaw on
Sunday.
"Stanford was just a perfect
fit," Oser said Sunday night. "It's
a combination of a great pro
gram, great academics and great
people. It's an amazing place
that really felt like home."
Stanford's 2013 recruiting
class now has 12 verbal commit
ments. With National Signing
Day just over three weeks away,
the Cardinal is close to wrapping
up its class. Stanford has two big
battles remaining, tight end

and wide receiver Devon Allen
(Phoenix, Ariz.).
