# TRACK STARTS FAST
## OPENING MEET EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS 
### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford track and field
teams started their seasons with
a boom at their opener this past
weekend at Washington's indoor
track facility. The team's trip to
Seattle was a cold one, but the
runners' efforts on the track were
blistering, with several event
wins and impressive freshmen
debuts for the Cardinal.
According to junior women's cap
tain Jessica Tonn, "We really
came together [this meet] as a
collective unit and approached
the meet our way."
Unity and cohesion were
important for the Cardinal's
4x400-meter A and B teams,
which posted times of 3:48 and
3:55, respectively. Even more
impressive was the success of the
men's 4x400 team, which finished
first ahead of Western Washington
and Washington. Looking for
ward this season, the 400 will be
an assured strength for the
Cardinal, known for its mid-dis
tance and long-distance capabili
ty. The leadership and speed from
women's captain Kori Carter, who
blew away her competition with a
time of 55.92 in the open 400, cer
tainly won't hurt in upcoming
meets.
The team did exceptionally
well considering they were not
hindered by the novel irregulari
ty of the UW indoor track: a 307 m
course instead of the usual 200m
banked track that is a hallmark of
the indoor season. The structural
difference markedly changed
team race strategy, upsetting pac
ing ability and forcing individuals
to adapt during relay hand-offs.
Thirteenth in the preseason
rankings, the women's team did
not disappoint. Amy Weissenbach,
the highly-anticipated freshman
from Los Angeles, finished first
overall in the ever-competitive
mile with a personal best time of
4:52.01, with Jessica Tonn not far
behind in fourth at 4:53.
Weisenbach was a household
name for national high school
track, having set the National
Federation record for the 800
with a time of 2:02.04 last year,
and her feat in the mile this past
weekend confirms her budding
career as a top collegiate competi
tor.
The women took first and sec
ond in the challenging 600 open,
with senior Joy O'Hare finishing
at 1:31.73 and freshman Kristyn
Williams pushing through with
1:32.04. Williams and her fresh
man sister Kaitlyn anchored the
4x400 relays and will certainly be
strong sources of speed and
dependability in the upcoming
New Mexico and Cherry and
Silver meet this weekend in
Albuquerque. Overall, the
Stanford women are perfectly

content with their performance,
calling it a good start.
"As the season develops,"
Carter said, "we will have to get
more technically sound and rely
more on speed as opposed to pure

strength."
According to men's captain
and shot putter Geoffrey Tabor,
the "biggest question" for the

Lack of experience was not a problem for the young squad.
team is youth. Last year, the
men lost key competitors,
such as graduated runners
Chris Derrick and Eliot
Heath, and the Seattle pre
view was the perfect oppor
tunity for new freshmen to
gain experience in a more
casual racing environment.
The Stanford men exhib
ited tremendous depth in the
mile, sweeping the top five
spots. Senior Andrew
Berberick finished first in
the tight race with a time of
4:09.41. Michael Atchoo fin
ished second to Olympian
Matt Centrowitz in 1:52 in a
slow-paced open 800.
With several coaching
changes at the beginning of

the year, the Stanford track
and field program looked
like it might take a bit of
time to get into gear.
But in Seattle, coach
Chris Miltenburg and the
Cardinal answered the
doubts resoundingly and
according to Carter,
"Stanford killed it across the
board."
Yet to come is one of the
most important meets of the
indoor season: the
University of Washington
Invitational in two weeks,
when the teams will return
to the same Seattle facility.
Solid training and the devel
opment of a consistent rac
ing routine is necessary if
the Cardinal wants to see
the same favorable results it
saw this past weekend.
