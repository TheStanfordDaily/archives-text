## Card wins despite flu problems 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The flu may not have reached
epidemic levels in California yet,
but it has on the Stanford women's
gymnastics team. Even though
roughly half the team is suffering
from flu-like symptoms, the No. 6
Cardinal (6-0, 1-0 Pac-12) defeated
a trio of tough opponents to take
first place in a meet held at the
University of Arizona on Saturday.

Stanford recorded a score of
196.025 to beat No. 19 Arizona
(195.850), No. 18 Illinois (193.750)
and San Jose State (192.55) for the
team's second quad meet win of the
season.
The Cardinal has received
points from many different sources
thus far in the young season, and
that trend continued Saturday
night.
"I'm really proud of our team
effort," Stanford head coach
Kristen Smyth said. "We had prob
ably half the team dealing with the
flu so I'm really proud of how the
girls stepped up and competed so
well."
All-American Ashley Morgan
paced the Cardinal with a third
place finish in the all-around com
petition. Although the senior was
one of those under the weather, she
competed in all four events and
earned an all-around score of
39.125.
Stanford recorded the highest
team score on three events the
uneven bars, the beam and the
vault.
The Cardinal kicked off the
meet with a dominant performance
on the uneven bars. The team
earned a cumulative score of 49.320
the team's highest for any event
this season. Kristina Vaculik, who
competed for the Cardinal in 2011
before taking the 2012 season off to
compete in the London Olympics,
recorded a meet-high score of
9.925, while fellow sophomore
Ivana Hong set a new personal
record with a score of 9.900.
On the beam, junior Ail-
American Shona Morgan earned a
score of 9.875 to claim second place
in the event. Hong, who was also a
2012 Ail-American, took third with
a 9.850 score.
"We did a really good job, but
there's still room for improvement,
and that's really exciting," Shona
Morgan said.
Senior captain Nicole Dayton
continued her impressive season in

the vault. In last week's
meet, Dayton set a personal
record of 9.950 on her way to
being named Pae-12
Specialist of the Week. This
time around, her score of
9.875 was good enough to
earn the senior her second
consecutive vault scoring
title.
"Nicole Dayton was out
standing tonight," Smyth
said. "I think people are real
ly recognizing her work and
it's nice to see her getting
rewarded for it."
On Saturday, freshman
Taylor Rice made her colle
giate debut in the vault. Rice
recorded a score of 9.775 to
tie fellow freshman Melissa
Chuang for Stanford's third
place score. Hong earned
9.825 points to round out the
Cardinal's scoring in the
event.
Arizona took first place in
the floor event with a score
of 49.400. Stanford earned
second with 48.675 points,
led by Ashley Morgan's
score of 9.800.
This was the first Pac-12
matchup for Stanford this
season. Although Arizona is
traditionally a strong pro
gram, it had not beaten
Stanford since March 25,
2005. With the win on
Saturday, the Cardinal made
it 18 straight victories over
the Wildcats.
"I feel like we're right on
track," Smyth said. "We are
right where we want to be
and I was proud of [the
team's] effort on the road to
get the win and to make a
good improvement on bars
this week."
The Cardinal will now try
to recuperate before a dual
meet at No. 11 Georgia on
Jan. 21. Stanford returns to
Pac-12 action on Jan. 26
against Cal.
"It was a great step,"
Smyth said. "We're looking
forward to continuing to
build."
