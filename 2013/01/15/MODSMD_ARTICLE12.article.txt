## Card wins despite flu problems 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The flu may not have reached
epidemic levels in California yet,
but it has on the Stanford women's
gymnastics team. Even though
roughly half the team is suffering
from flu-like symptoms, the No. 6
Cardinal (6-0, 1-0 Pac-12) defeated
a trio of tough opponents to take
first place in a meet held at the
University of Arizona on Saturday.

Stanford recorded a score of
196.025 to beat No. 19 Arizona
(195.850), No. 18 Illinois (193.750)
and San Jose State (192.55) for the
team's second quad meet win of the
season.
The Cardinal has received
points from many different sources
thus far in the young season, and
that trend continued Saturday
night.
"I'm really proud of our team
effort," Stanford head coach
Kristen Smyth said. "We had prob
ably half the team dealing with the
flu so I'm really proud of how the
girls stepped up and competed so
well."
All-American Ashley Morgan
paced the Cardinal with a third
place finish in the all-around com
petition. Although the senior was
one of those under the weather, she
competed in all four events and
earned an all-around score of
39.125.
Stanford recorded the highest
team score on three events the
uneven bars, the beam and the
vault.
The Cardinal kicked off the
meet with a dominant performance
on the uneven bars. The team
earned a cumulative score of 49.320
the team's highest for any event
this season. Kristina Vaculik, who
competed for the Cardinal in 2011
before taking the 2012 season off to
compete in the London Olympics,
recorded a meet-high score of
9.925, while fellow sophomore
Ivana Hong set a new personal
record with a score of 9.900.
On the beam, junior Ail-
American Shona Morgan earned a
score of 9.875 to claim second place
in the event. Hong, who was also a
2012 Ail-American, took third with
a 9.850 score.
"We did a really good job, but
there's still room for improvement,
and that's really exciting," Shona
Morgan said.
