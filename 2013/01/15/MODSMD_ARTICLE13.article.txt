## Fighting over soap 
### Emily Cohodes 
As a student in Psych 147 this
quarter, I'm working at Bing
Nursery School once a week
with three- to five-year-olds. To the
kids, I'm just "Teacher Emily," not
a psych student with very little
experience breaking up fights in
the sandbox. Last Friday, I
worked my first shift at the pre
school and unsurprisingly, I
immediately found myself in a sit
uation in which the children were
deferring to me as the authority
figure.
The conflict at hand involved
possession of a teapot full of
soapy water which was doubling
as tea in the dramatic play area.
One of the boys involved in the tiff
grabbed the teapot in his play
mate's hand, and the other boy
refused to let go. I got down to the
boys' level, and asked the teapot
grabber to let go of his playmate
and to use his words rather than
his body to show what he wanted
in the situation. I realized that the
root cause of this conflict was real
ly a shortage of tea, and thought
we might be able to avoid further
conflict (and potentially tears) if
we just made more tea by adding
warm water to the suds. I encour
aged the teapot grabber to come
with me and make more tea at the
sink, but he refused and continued
trying to grab the teapot.
Looking back on this incident,
I realize I was so focused on the
details of the actual situation at
hand (the shortage of soapy
water) that I wasn't able to see
the great potential in moments
like this one, which repeat them
selves thousands of time in pre
school classrooms around the
world. The issue at hand was not
the actual lack of tea, but a lack of
communication and the presence
of a physical rather than verbal
automatic response to problem
solving. Rather than suggesting
that they make more bubbles, I
should have been emphasizing the
skills that will help these children
solve problems for the rest of
their lives: listening skills, prob
lem solving skills, non-violent
problem solving skills and empa
thy Rather than work to find
more soap and end the conflict, I
should have helped the children
talk to each other about how they
were feeling, why they felt the

need to grab, and how they could
come to a conclusion that would
satisfy both of them.
I tell you this anecdote
because it is extremely applicable
to our lives today. Our daily inter
personal trials and tribulations
are really no more than fights
over soapy water. Their content is
irrelevant, but their themes are
extremely relevant to the rest of
our lives. We are all faced with
thousands of little challenges in
our lives as busy college students
juggling classes, social lives,
and future plans (to name just a
few) and the way we learn to
deal with these challenges now
will inform how we deal with
future challenges that may look
different but will likely spiral
around many of the same themes
that affect preschoolers.
Rather than just look for
"quick fixes" to the issues that
trouble you from getting too
many emails to dealing with tough
meetings with professors to "hard
talks" in romantic relationships
take the time to practice good
problem-solving skills that will
stay with you for the rest of your
life. Communicate, respect your
own values, and care for the other
party involved. While this may
seem like an exercise best left in
the sandbox at Bing, our social
development and problem-solving
skills should continually evolve as
well, just like those of four-year
olds.
In those tough situations and
conflicts, for example, ask your
self if you truly understand what
the other person wants or needs
and what might be causing them
to act the way they are. Next time
one of your group members fails
you at the last minute before a
group project is due, push your
self to practice extreme empathy
for that other person and see
what it feels like. And the next
time a friend says something to
upset you, challenge yourself to
take the harder, less comfortable
route to a solution. Rather than
just making more soapy water,
take the time to invest in your
future self!
