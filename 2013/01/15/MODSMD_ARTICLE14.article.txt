# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Victim blaming 
### Chris Herries 
Is victim blaming ever justified?
The immediate answer is no, of
course not. A girl doesn't wear
a provocative outfit with the aim of
being sexually assaulted, and she
doesn't walk alone at night in the
hope of being raped. To think so is
not only ludicrous, but also hurtful
and offensive. It is an attempt to
invert victimization by saying the
perpetrator couldn't control his
urges urges that were brought
on by a sexy decolletage or a few
too many drinks. And who chose to
wear that outfit or drink those
drinks? The girl who was asking to
be assaulted! When you slow it
down and parse it out, you begin to
realize how absurd it is to blame
the victims of sexual assault.
But how often do we as a socie
ty blame victims in cases other
than sexual assault? Leaving your
laptop unattended in a public place
seems like an uncommonly stupid
thing to do because it is. It's tak
ing a wholly unnecessary risk

but is it my fault for needing to use
the bathroom and wanting to leave
my laptop at my work station?
What if I leave my dorm room
unlocked? If someone were to steal
from my dorm room I would antic
ipate a chorus of people saying,
"You should've locked your doors!"
Again, perhaps rightfully so, since
I willingly took an unnecessary
risk by leaving my door unlocked.
Lastly, if I'm relieved of my Rolex
on the streets of Spanish Harlem
at midnight, who is at fault?
Clearly the mugger, but it would be
logical to ask, "Why would you
walk around Spanish Harlem with
a Rolex at midnight? Don't you
think that's a little risky?" I would
certainly be admonished not to do
it again.

So is victim-blaming only wrong
in cases of sexual assault, or is it
universally bad? For those who say
it's only wrong in cases of sexual
assault, I see your point. Sexual
assault is a far more intimate and
egregious violation than theft.
Moreover, victim-blaming in sexual

assault attempts to limit a person's
fundamental freedoms to do things
like dress how they please.
At the same time, I should have
the freedom to park my bike with
out a lock. After all, it's not against
the law to leave your bike
unlocked, but it is against the law
to walk off with someone else's. It's
not my fault if someone steals it,
yet I'd be inundated with com
ments about stupid it is to leave a
bike unlocked.
I'm tempted to say that victim
blaming is universally wrong, not
only because it is an attempt to
limit the freedom of the victim but
also because it's an attempt to take
blame away from the perpetrator.
In reality, only the perpetrator can
prevent a crime from happening;
crime is the criminal's decision. We
try to use victims as extenuating
circumstances to lessen, or at least
explain, an offense.
However, that raises far more
interesting questions about
whether extenuating circum
stances should ever be a factor
when considering crime. Let's say
both a rich man and a poor man
mug an old lady in Manhattan.
Should we consider one of them
more or less justified in their
actions? If the poor man is more
justified, should he receive a
lighter sentence? Some would say
yes on both counts. But again,
we're shifting blame away from the
perpetrator of a crime by saying
that external factors acted as an
irresistible compelling factor.
Could we then say that a college
aged assaulter was so over
whelmed by hormones and a
hyper-sexualized culture that he's
not wholly to blame for rape? My
answer to the latter is certainly no,
but I'm unsure about the poverty
stricken mugger.
Suffice to say, how we think
about crime should be re-examined.
