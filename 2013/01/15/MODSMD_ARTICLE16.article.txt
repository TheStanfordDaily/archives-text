## On ROTC's militarization of campus space 
### 
While the recent op-ed from
Georgetown's Dominick
Healey offers a pithy
restatement of what he construes
as the essence of Stanford Says No
to War's (SSNW) opposition to
ROTC on campus ("We don't want
ROTC on campus because we don't
like war"), it is not quite accurate.
True, we do not like war. More
pertinently, SSNW's opposition to
ROTC on campus is grounded in
the fact that we don't want
University space to be militarized.
Other countries manage to train
their military officers without turn
ing university campuses into mili
tary installations. Our point in dis
cussing this on our website is that,
whether you agree with us about
war or not, you should consider the
alternative to ROTC that the mili
tary's own studies suggest would be
cheaper and just as effective by its
standards (not ours): replacing
ROTC with Officer Candidate
Schools located away from college
campuses, where students go after
graduation.
The danger of the militarization

of college campuses is not an idle
concern. By hosting a program that
recruits and trains soldiers, the
University's leadership is providing
material support to a military force.
Imagine the patriotic uproar if
Stanford decided to take its engage
ment with China a step further and
allow the PRC's army to run a few
courses in leadership and military
history. Indeed, by welcoming
ROTC back to campus, the
University has, literally taken sides
in an active armed conflict. We
think the academy is most con
ducive to the free pursuit of knowl
edge and ideas when it is, to the
greatest extent possible, a neutral
space.
Furthermore, according to the
U.S. forces' own targeting policy,
the presence of ROTC on campus
effectively transforms areas of our
university into "training camps"
and bases of "militants." That
would again, according to the cri
teria used by recent U.S. adminis
trations (and put into practice by
the armed forces and the CIA)
mean that areas of the Stanford

campus could be viewed as legiti
mate targets for combat by the ene
mies of the U.S. Non-ROTC stu
dents and workers (as well as infra
structure) would be at risk of being
"collateral damage" or "human
shields." Let's not be misunder
stood; we are not advocating for
those targeting criteria they are,
after all, illegal under international
law. We are, rather, pointing to the
hypocrisy and recklessness of U.S.
militarism.
The individuals who participate
or have participated in ROTC are,
we believe, decent and honorable
people. Some of them are our
friends and family members. It is
the institution that we are against.
Organizations like the military
whose primary purpose is to effi
ciently apply coercion, threats,
destruction and death are indeed
incompatible with the ideals of high
er education.
