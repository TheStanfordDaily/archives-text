# Stanford, Silicon Valley and space
## Aero/Astro department benefits from location, struggles to engage undergrads 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD 
In 2011, doctoral student Ivan Ravlich
chose to accept his offer of admission to
Stanford's aerospace engineering program,
which, according to U.S. News and World
Report, ranks sixth in the field, turning
down first-ranked MIT and fifth-ranked
Caltech.
"I had some family friends in the aero
space world at Boeing and [Houlihan] Lokey,
and they talked around to different engi
neers," Ravlich said. "Their consensus was
that Caltech and MIT are very, very good at
the technical side of things ... but Stanford is
where the leaders and the innovators are
cultivated from."
Even before Silicon Valley transformed

Stanford into a bridge between academia
and the private sector, Stanford was making
advances in space technology. Bradford
Parkinson Ph.D. '66, currently professor
emeritus in the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics (Aero/Astro), went on to
invent the Global Position System (GPS),
and fellow Professor Emeritus Bob Twiggs
co-invented CubeSats, miniature satellites
employed by the U.S. Department of
Defense and National Aeronautics and
Space Agency (NASA) in 1999.
Henning Roedel, another doctoral stu
dent working on a lunar biocomposite proj
ect, agreed with Ravlich.
"In terms of alumni contacts at aerospace
companies, there's always a Stanford alumni
who is vice president, president or some

where way high up," he said.
Scott Hubbard, one such 'high up' in the
field, acknowledged Stanford's "strong con
nection to Silicon Valley." Hubbard, a con
sulting professor, is the director of the
NASA Ames Research Center and a recipi
ent of the Distinguished Service Medal,
NASA's highest honor.
"We've been very successful as a gradu
ate program our students have been
placed not only at big companies but at start
ups as well," he said.
Yet while the graduate program is highly
lauded, undergraduates often find it difficult
to access the department.
David Gerson 'l4 is impressed by the
graduate students who have gone on to cre
ate startups such as Skybox and SpaceX, but

says that Stanford's Aero/Astro Department
does not do a good enough job of engaging
the undergraduate community.
"Undergrads who are interested in
Aero/Astro are not invited to any events, nor
are they on any email lists," Gerson said.
"When people ask me what I am majoring in,
I have to explain that Aero/Astro is an actu
al undergraduate major. It's very small and
few people know it."
In fact, the department offers undergrad
uates an interdisciplinary major in
Aero/Astro. Undergraduates obtain a
Bachelor of Science degree in General
Engineering. The department also offers
undergraduate minors.
Amr Mohamed 'l6 won the
2012 You Tube Space Lab compe
tition by exploring the effects of
microgravity on zebra spiders.
He came to Stanford with a pas
sion for space, but found the
resources similarly lacking.
"The Aero/Astro major did not
have a table at majors night,
which was really disappointing,"
Mohamed said. "They don't seem
to be reaching out to us."
Professors in the Aero/Astro
department expressed a desire to
engage with more undergradu
ates, but said the department
lacks the faculty to fully handle
both graduate and undergraduate
interest.
Sanjiva Lele, professor of

Aero/Astro and Mechanical
Engineering, said the number of
faculty in the Stanford
Aero/Astro department is rela
tively small compared to other
University departments which
have both graduate and under
graduate majors.
"It's a decision that the
department made when it was
established 50 years ago. The
feeling was it would serve the
aerospace community better by
focusing on the graduate program
... and contributing to training of
people for the aerospace industry,
Ph.D.s and so on," Lele said.
"In our department... under
grads can shape their own major,
can come in and can get an under
graduate degree in Aero/Astro,"
Hubbard said. "But we just don't
have the faculty and staff to sup
port a larger program."
But students in the field
believe its barriers to entry

extend beyond uninvolved
Stanford undergraduates.
"Everyone seems to be intrin
sically interested in space, but not
actively pursuing it," Roedel said.
Mohammed pointed to the
capital-intensive process of start
ing a space company as a dissuad
ing factor. The amount of money
can be daunting SpaceX co
founder Elon Musk invested $lOO
million of his own money and
Roedel added that the competi
tion can be intimidating as well.
"Honestly I think [the reason]
is a little bit of fear," Roedel said.
"The perception of NASA is that
it's the best and the brightest, and
it's humbling to try and go for
something like that."
Student-led organizations
attempt to fill in the support gap
for interested undergraduates.
The Student Spaceflight
Initiative (SSI), founded by
Gerson, attempts to create a

stronger and more consistent dia
logue between the undergraduate
community, graduate students,
faculty and aerospace industry
professionals.

"The real aim was to try and
create a group that would allow
anybody interested in space to
talk to each other," Gerson said.
"Allow undergrads to meet grad
students, to get involved with pro
fessors labs, and to work on their
own projects, and to then really
connect everybody with what's
going on in Silicon Valley."
"We want to [make] the vision
of space a reality for more people
at Stanford," said Ravlich, who
also leads SSl's initiative to pro
mote space-related discussion.
"This is a blossoming field where
there is plenty of room for
growth."
