# Stanford, Silicon Valley and space
## Aero/Astro department benefits from location, struggles to engage undergrads 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD 
In 2011, doctoral student Ivan Ravlich
chose to accept his offer of admission to
Stanford's aerospace engineering program,
which, according to U.S. News and World
Report, ranks sixth in the field, turning
down first-ranked MIT and fifth-ranked
Caltech.
"I had some family friends in the aero
space world at Boeing and [Houlihan] Lokey,
and they talked around to different engi
neers," Ravlich said. "Their consensus was
that Caltech and MIT are very, very good at
the technical side of things ... but Stanford is
where the leaders and the innovators are
cultivated from."
Even before Silicon Valley transformed

Stanford into a bridge between academia
and the private sector, Stanford was making
advances in space technology. Bradford
Parkinson Ph.D. '66, currently professor
emeritus in the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics (Aero/Astro), went on to
invent the Global Position System (GPS),
and fellow Professor Emeritus Bob Twiggs
co-invented CubeSats, miniature satellites
employed by the U.S. Department of
Defense and National Aeronautics and
Space Agency (NASA) in 1999.
Henning Roedel, another doctoral stu
dent working on a lunar biocomposite proj
ect, agreed with Ravlich.
"In terms of alumni contacts at aerospace
companies, there's always a Stanford alumni
who is vice president, president or some

where way high up," he said.
Scott Hubbard, one such 'high up' in the
field, acknowledged Stanford's "strong con
nection to Silicon Valley." Hubbard, a con
sulting professor, is the director of the
NASA Ames Research Center and a recipi
ent of the Distinguished Service Medal,
NASA's highest honor.
"We've been very successful as a gradu
ate program our students have been
placed not only at big companies but at start
ups as well," he said.
Yet while the graduate program is highly
lauded, undergraduates often find it difficult
to access the department.
David Gerson 'l4 is impressed by the
graduate students who have gone on to cre
ate startups such as Skybox and SpaceX, but

says that Stanford's Aero/Astro Department
does not do a good enough job of engaging
the undergraduate community.
"Undergrads who are interested in
Aero/Astro are not invited to any events, nor
are they on any email lists," Gerson said.
"When people ask me what I am majoring in,
I have to explain that Aero/Astro is an actu
al undergraduate major. It's very small and
few people know it."
In fact, the department offers undergrad
uates an interdisciplinary major in
Aero/Astro. Undergraduates obtain a
Bachelor of Science degree in General
Engineering. The department also offers
undergraduate minors.
