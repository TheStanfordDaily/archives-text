## Cell biologists look to future after landmark research 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Researchers at the Stanford
Covert System Biology Lab recent
ly developed the world's first
whole-cell model of all the biological
processes in a cell, which can be
used to educate medical decisions,
such as allowing for more detailed
prognoses delivered to patients.
The team developed a model of
Mycoplasma genitalium, a small
bacterium. They will work on a sim
ilar whole-cell model for E. coli over
the next year, which they expect to
attract the attention of the biofuel
community. E. coli has been used
and modified by companies looking
to popularize biofuel over fossil fuel
to consumers.
The whole-cell model of M. gen

italium, named WholeCellKÃŸ-MG,
was published in the journal Cell
last November.
The MG model represents a
departure from work that hones in
on one biological process at a time,
such as only looking how the cell
grows.
"Most people focus on just one
piece at a time, and that might
mean that they're missing part of
the picture by only focusing on one
little thing at a time," said Jonathan
Karr M.S. 'l3, Ph.D. 'l3, a
researcher in the biophysics
department at Stanford working on
the project. "We build on all of that
work that everyone's doing. We
take all of those models that people
are publishing and assemble it into
one cohesive picture."

Whole-cell models, developed
by these system biologists, also give
bioengineers a better opportunity
to understand how their designed
system will operate in different con
ditions.
"Our major focus is on building
these comprehensive models of
cells and using that to discover new
biology to guide rational bioengi
neering to do things like produce
drugs, biofuels and commodity
chemicals," Karr said.
The novelty and applicability of
the MG model prompted
researchers to begin looking more
boldly at how it can be improved,
which is vital if the team is to be
successful in personalizing patient
treatment through this out-of-the
box approach, Karr said.

"Maybe further into the future,
[we can] use these kinds of models
to guide medical decisions if we got
to the point where we could accu
rately model [not only] bacteria but
also other mammalian cells and
human cells," Karr added.
According to Karr, one of the
challenges with this type of model
ing is that not all parts of cells are
equally well described.
Topics that have been more
extensively researched allow for
more detailed quantitative models.
For this model, the researchers use
data measured in other organisms
to make up for missing information,
as M. genitalium "is not very exper
imentally tractable and not very
