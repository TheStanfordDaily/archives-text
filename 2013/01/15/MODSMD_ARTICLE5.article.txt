## PG&E work on J-Serra to end in April Future work includes in-line inspections in 2014,2015 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR 
Pacific Gas and Electric's
(PG&E) work to replace Line 109,
which runs along Page Mill Road,
Junipero Serra Boulevard and
Sand Hill Road, is expected to be
completed by the end of April.
The project to replace the 22-
inch diameter pipe that was
installed in 1936 with a standard
24-inch pipe has been ongoing since
last October.
According to a statement from
PG&E, the line is being replaced
instead of hydro tested and main
tained because it is due for replace
ment in the next two years. Hydro
testing is a method used to check
for weak points or leaks in a line by
sending highly-pressurized water
through the pipes.
In October, as crews performed
maintenance work on Line 109, a
valve snapped and released gas.
After replacing the valve, PG&E
reviewed all of their material fail
ure reports to check for similar
valve failures and found none. The
damaged valve was sent to a lab for
failure analysis testing; PG&E said
that the results of that testing will
aid in developing preventative
measures against valve rupture in
the future.
As part of PG&E's Pipeline
Safety Enhancement Plan, a
response to the 2010 San Bruno
pipeline rupture, automated valves
will be phased in that can be shut
down remotely.
Stanford has made efforts to
ensure that communication is open
between the University and PG&E.
It has also tried to keep the com
munity informed of progress.
"We offered space on campus,
and [PG&E] came in and had an
open house for residents to ask
questions," said Larry Gibbs, asso
ciate vice provost for environmen
tal health and safety.
Early this year, work is expect
ed to start on a gas distribution
project on Junipero Serra
Boulevard between Campus Drive
West and Fremont Road. The work
will extend the gas distribution sys
tem and eliminate high-pressure
regulator sets that tap into the
area's transmission line, according
to the PG&E statement.
Another project will reroute gas
distribution on Comstock Circle to
accommodate new buildings in the
area.
Line 132 is set for internal
inspection in 2014, with an internal
inspection of the new Line 109 to
follow in 2015.
