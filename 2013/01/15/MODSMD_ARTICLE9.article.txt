## Searching for fanhood in the NFL 
### Tom Taylor 
I know that it is a little bit late in
the game, but I have just two
weeks to find an NFL team.
For the first time ever I intend
to really watch the Super Bowl
this year. I realize that this admission
doesn't do much for my sports fan
credentials on either side of the
Atlantic over here, that it has
taken me five years on the Farm to
get round to doing this, and over
there, that I'm going to spend five or
so hours of my life watching
American football but sometimes
the truth is inconvenient.
The one previous time I did watch
was several years back from the
U.K., but I don't feel I can count that
attempt. The time change meant
Mckoff was not until the small hours
of Monday morning, so surprisingly I
didn't have much company for the
game. Worse than that, though, I was
subjected to British-voiced commen
tary— I'm still not confident I can
trust a British person's football
knowledge and all those breaks in
play for the famous Super Bowl
adverts were filled with either dead
air or, worse, more insight from said
commentators.
As much as I have been sucked in
by U.S. college athletics, professional
sports here haven't managed to win
me over. This past season, my record
of Stanford football games attended
stood at 12-2 and since basketball
tipped off in November, I've probably
already spent a couple days solid in
Maples Pavilion. In comparison, I've
still failed to go to a single live NFL,
NBA or NHL game though I
gather not many people have been to
pro hockey games in the last couple of
months and my last MLB game
was maybe ten years back.
Even as I write this column, when
perhaps I should be paying attention
to the NFL divisional playoff action,
I'm sitting in the upper-level media
desk at Maples Pavilion watching the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Part of this is simply a question of
time. Not only do I have some serious
sports commitments back home,
including following the mighty
Reading FC —my struggling
English Premier League affection
, but I'm also supposed to be writing a
Ph.D. dissertation.
However, it's barely mid-January
and I'm not yet quite ready to give up
on my New Year's resolutions. I'm
also having college football withdraw
al symptoms, and my brother is head
ing across the pond to come visit me
the week of the Super Bowl, so I'm
desperate to try and entertain him
with a hefty slice of Americana.
The problem, though, is that I just
don't really know which team I should
support. I cheer for Reading FC
because I was born and raised almost
within spitting distance of both the
old Elm Park ground and the new
Madejski Stadium, and nationality
puts me squarely behind any English
or British teams. My allegiance to
Stanford is the result of too many
years spent on the Farm and too
many hour's spent watching various
Cardinal teams and covering some of
them for The Daily.
I don't have a strong connection,
though, with any of the 32 NFL
teams. The Dolphins have the illustri
ous honor of being the first I'd ever
heard of as a kid and the first player I
was vaguely conscious of, defensive
lineman William "The Fridge" Perry,
played for the Bear's. Just knowing
who someone is, though, is hardly an
exciting justification for my devotion,
especially when the reason for that is
mostly their amusing nickname.
Perhaps I should cheer for New
England on the basis that I'm from
"Olde England." However, it would
seem a little unpatriotic to go for a
team whose name appears to cele
brate a rather famous and victori
ous —war against my home country.
I could maybe go with Cardinal
allegiance, picking either the Colts or
the Vikings now home to
Stanford's recent Heisman runner-s
-up, Andrew Luck'l2 and Toby
Gerhart'lo, respectively —, or per
haps just copy the majority of my
football-watching Mends, and go with
the Packers.
Green Bay doesn't actually seem
like the worst choice. My European
socialist leanings make it quite
appealing to want to support any
team that is owned by its local com
munity, and it would be intriguing to
be in some small way part of that.
And finally there are the local
teams: the Niners and the Raiders.
Much as I might want to dress in
black and pretend I am a marauding
barbarian, though, I just can't bring
myself to support Oakland. From my
limited knowledge of the history of
the NFL I know one thing for cer-
tain: that the Raiders once
committed the ultimate sports
sin, deserting their fans and
running away to Los Angeles
in search of greener pastures.
That they eventually saw the
error of their ways and came
crawling back doesn't absolve
them of this crime. I have
nothing against Oakland fans
—in fact I am humbled by
your ability to forgive but if
the Raiders had been my
team, burning in hell just
wouldn't be punishment
enough.

Which leaves San
Francisco. As my closest team,
it is maybe the laziest answer,
but the 49ers do tick a lot of
boxes. Head coach Jim
Harbaugh has Cardinal blood
in his veins and of my Mends
that don't support the
Packers, there are a healthy
number of Niners fans. It's
also nice that they haven't won

a Super Bowl since the 1994
season, because locals will be
extra hungry, though at the
same time, the one drawback
to their past record is an
unnatural winning efficiency.
In title games that have fea
tured San Francisco, the team
is five-for-five. I'm just not
comfortable with that sort of
sporting certainty
Except that all of this care
fully weighted analysis is a lit
tle bit too late anyway As I fin
ish this column, from those 32
teams, just four are left: the
Atlanta Falcons, the
Baltimore Ravens, the New
England Patriots and, yes, the
San Francisco 49ers. It seems
that attrition has made my
mind up far quicker than I
could.
Go Niners!

extra hungry, though at the
same time, the one drawback
to their past record is an
unnatural winning efficiency.
In title games that have fea
tured San Francisco, the team
is five-for-five. I'm just not
comfortable with that sort of
sporting certainty
Except that all of this care
fully weighted analysis is a lit
tle bit too late anyway As I fin
ish this column, from those 32
teams, just four are left: the
Atlanta Falcons, the
Baltimore Ravens, the New
England Patriots and, yes, the
San Francisco 49ers. It seems
that attrition has made my
mind up far quicker than I
could.
Go Niners!

I know that it is a little bit late in
the game, but I have just two
weeks to find an NFL team.
For the first time ever I intend
to really watch the Super Bowl
this year. I realize that this admission
doesn't do much for my sports fan
credentials on either side of the
Atlantic over here, that it has
taken me five years on the Farm to
get round to doing this, and over
there, that I'm going to spend five or
so hours of my life watching
American football but sometimes
the truth is inconvenient.
The one previous time I did watch
was several years back from the
U.K., but I don't feel I can count that
attempt. The time change meant
Mckoff was not until the small hours
of Monday morning, so surprisingly I
didn't have much company for the
game. Worse than that, though, I was
subjected to British-voiced commen
tary— I'm still not confident I can
trust a British person's football
knowledge and all those breaks in
play for the famous Super Bowl
adverts were filled with either dead
air or, worse, more insight from said
commentators.
As much as I have been sucked in
by U.S. college athletics, professional
sports here haven't managed to win
me over. This past season, my record
of Stanford football games attended
stood at 12-2 and since basketball
tipped off in November, I've probably
already spent a couple days solid in
Maples Pavilion. In comparison, I've
still failed to go to a single live NFL,
NBA or NHL game though I
gather not many people have been to
pro hockey games in the last couple of
months and my last MLB game
was maybe ten years back.
Even as I write this column, when
perhaps I should be paying attention
to the NFL divisional playoff action,
I'm sitting in the upper-level media
desk at Maples Pavilion watching the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Part of this is simply a question of
time. Not only do I have some serious
sports commitments back home,
including following the mighty
Reading FC —my struggling
English Premier League affection
, but I'm also supposed to be writing a
Ph.D. dissertation.
However, it's barely mid-January
and I'm not yet quite ready to give up
on my New Year's resolutions. I'm
also having college football withdraw
al symptoms, and my brother is head
ing across the pond to come visit me
the week of the Super Bowl, so I'm
desperate to try and entertain him
with a hefty slice of Americana.
The problem, though, is that I just
don't really know which team I should
support. I cheer for Reading FC
because I was born and raised almost
within spitting distance of both the
old Elm Park ground and the new
Madejski Stadium, and nationality
puts me squarely behind any English
or British teams. My allegiance to
Stanford is the result of too many
years spent on the Farm and too
many hour's spent watching various
Cardinal teams and covering some of
them for The Daily.
I don't have a strong connection,
though, with any of the 32 NFL
teams. The Dolphins have the illustri
ous honor of being the first I'd ever
heard of as a kid and the first player I
was vaguely conscious of, defensive
lineman William "The Fridge" Perry,
played for the Bear's. Just knowing
who someone is, though, is hardly an
exciting justification for my devotion,
especially when the reason for that is
mostly their amusing nickname.
Perhaps I should cheer for New
England on the basis that I'm from
"Olde England." However, it would
seem a little unpatriotic to go for a
team whose name appears to cele
brate a rather famous and victori
ous —war against my home country.
I could maybe go with Cardinal
allegiance, picking either the Colts or
the Vikings now home to
Stanford's recent Heisman runner-s
-up, Andrew Luck'l2 and Toby
Gerhart'lo, respectively —, or per
haps just copy the majority of my
football-watching Mends, and go with
the Packers.
Green Bay doesn't actually seem
like the worst choice. My European
socialist leanings make it quite
appealing to want to support any
team that is owned by its local com
munity, and it would be intriguing to
be in some small way part of that.
And finally there are the local
teams: the Niners and the Raiders.
Much as I might want to dress in
black and pretend I am a marauding
barbarian, though, I just can't bring
myself to support Oakland. From my
limited knowledge of the history of
the NFL I know one thing for cer-
tain: that the Raiders once
committed the ultimate sports
sin, deserting their fans and
running away to Los Angeles
in search of greener pastures.
That they eventually saw the
error of their ways and came
crawling back doesn't absolve
them of this crime. I have
nothing against Oakland fans
—in fact I am humbled by
your ability to forgive but if
the Raiders had been my
team, burning in hell just
wouldn't be punishment
enough.

Which leaves San
Francisco. As my closest team,
it is maybe the laziest answer,
but the 49ers do tick a lot of
boxes. Head coach Jim
Harbaugh has Cardinal blood
in his veins and of my Mends
that don't support the
Packers, there are a healthy
number of Niners fans. It's
also nice that they haven't won

a Super Bowl since the 1994
season, because locals will be
extra hungry, though at the
same time, the one drawback
to their past record is an
unnatural winning efficiency.
