Over the years, artists, scientists, engineers, and humanities
scholars have explored the grand themes that define the human
condition from radically different perspectives. Too infrequently,
they are given the opportunity to listen to each other and
engage in conversations that cross boundaries and mix
up categories. Join us for SMMMASH "Body" that will feature
some of the most exciting thinkers in the Bay Area. Panelists
for the "Body" event include: Sarah Cahill, Contemporary Music
Pianist, Ken Goldberg, Professor of /ndustriaf Engineering,
L/C Berkeley, Arttara Bhardwaj, Indian Classical Dancer, and

of Computer Science and, by courtesy, of Mechanical Engineering.

wili exhibit works that relate to "Body" in the lobby of
