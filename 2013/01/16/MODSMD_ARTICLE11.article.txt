## Is it game over for pro football? 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Twenty years ago, there was
n't ever any doubt that foot
ball would exist today Today,
that same prognostication
wouldn't necessarily hold
true.
Amid the backdrop of a new study
linking football to severe brain trauma,
players continuing to bemoan the
"pansification" of the game they love
and increasingly blurry lines between
clean hits and illegal ones, the storied
game of football faces an existential cri
sis unlike anything the sport has ever
seen.
Unlike steroid scandals (hello,
MLB), repeated lockouts (hello,
NHL), or even referees gambling on
games (hello, NBA), this issue isn't just
about a few bad eggs spoiling the
entire meal. The issue of head trauma
in all sports, but most importantly in
the NHL and the NFL, is one that will
determine the future of American
sports for generations to come.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
CTE for short, is a result of repetitive
head trauma, often found in boxers,
military veterans, and football players.
The disorder is directly correlated with
severe neurological symptoms, like
memory loss, depression, dementia,
Alzheimer's, and other ailments that
are typically found in the elderly; in the
case of CTE victims, these symptoms
manifest themselves at much younger
ages and much more virulently.
In short, the repeated head trauma
of football (and hockey to a lesser
extent) is correlated with a disorder
(CTE), which is in turn correlated with
elevated levels of brain damage and
other terrible neurological diseases.
Put bluntly playing football for any
extended period of time, regardless of
position and injury history, can be haz
ardous to your neurological health, on
top of the average accrued skeletal and
muscular injuries that are so common
in the sport today
The biggest issue with this crisis is
that it threatens football's very exis
tence. The act of tackling someone vio
lently, which is the only way a tackle
happens at both the collegiate and pro
fessional levels, may not be sufficient to
cause some type of diagnosable brain
trauma by itself; however, the more
frightening studies show that CTE can
be caused by repeated minor collisions,
like a lineman and defender hying to
block each other, or a running back
being thrown to the turf) or a receiver
being jammed at the line of the scrim
mage. The pimgent question becomes,
how do you remove the football from
football?
The NFLs stand on this issue has
been hypocritical at best. Despite
claiming to have players' best interests
at heart, the NFL continues to sched
ule Thursday night games, juggle bye
weeks around randomly and has hied
(and failed) for the last few years to
increase the season's length to 18 reg
ular season games. When you get a
chance, take a look at an injury report
for any team in the league; I personal
ly guarantee that you will see multiple
concussions and other severe injuries.
At all levels, as ESPN's ongoing
coverage of this issue proclaims, foot
ball truly is at a crossroads. Tackle
football is inherently a gladiatorial
sport, hearkening back to the days of
the Roman Coliseum and violent com
bat of ages past. The problem is that
the applause for a good hit now must
be tempered by the fact that the colli
sion in question may have cost some
one years of their life that they can
never get back.
The players at the highest level also
seemed bemused by rule changes. The
penalization of helmet-to-helmet hits is
sketchy at best; there seems to be no
rhyme or reason to the calls that are
and aren't made. More frustratingly
there are certain plays that happen so
quickly that it is impossible to react; if
a receiver ducks his head at the last
possible second into the helmet of a
defender, who is to blame?
The biggest elephant in the room,
by far, is the fact that fining players
means little when the damage has
already been done. If someone ends up
concussed on a play losing $15,000 or a
game paycheck is the least of their
worries.
Real lives are being affected by
what transpires on an athletic field.
The worst part is not knowing how to
fix the problem; with baseball, strict
PED testing has (supposedly) cleaned
up the game. With the NBA, the
offending referees in Tim Donaghy's
bombshell gambling scandal have been
removed. With the NHL ... well,
never mind. The point is that to "fix"
football, in a crystalline sense, the only
alternative is to make the NFL the
NTFL: the National Touch Football
League. This, I believe, satisfies the
definition of a quagmire of the highest
order.
Just six years ago, I man
aged to convince my parents to
let me play football. Back in the
good old days there wasn't as
much noise in the press about
concussions, Alzheimer's and
the startling propensity for
older football players to suffer
from debilitating neurological
disorders at significantly high
er rates than the rest of the
populace.
No, the toughest job I had
in convincing my parents was
explaining to them how I, as a
5-foot-nothing, 100 pound,
unathletic child, would ever be
able to compete. In fact, my
parents were more worried
about me getting demoralized
and physically hurt than about
the long-term consequences of
bashing helmets with other

kids my age from the months of
August through November.
So I played bail through
high school, mostly as a backup
QB, immune to the hitting drills
that studies show are most like
ly to cause brain damage. For
that I am ever thankful. Today,
when other parents ask me
what position their child should
play I wholeheartedly recom
mend other sports or tell them
to stick to flag football. I love,
breathe, eat and sleep football,
but even I have difficulty
answering the bell when some
one asks me if I would let my
kids play Given the evidence, it
is hard for me to say anything
other than no.

determine the future of American
sports for generations to come.
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
CTE for short, is a result of repetitive
head trauma, often found in boxers,
military veterans, and football players.
The disorder is directly correlated with
severe neurological symptoms, like
memory loss, depression, dementia,
Alzheimer's, and other ailments that
are typically found in the elderly; in the
case of CTE victims, these symptoms
manifest themselves at much younger
ages and much more virulently.
In short, the repeated head trauma
of football (and hockey to a lesser
extent) is correlated with a disorder
(CTE), which is in turn correlated with
elevated levels of brain damage and
other terrible neurological diseases.
Put bluntly playing football for any
extended period of time, regardless of
position and injury history, can be haz
ardous to your neurological health, on
top of the average accrued skeletal and
muscular injuries that are so common
in the sport today
The biggest issue with this crisis is
that it threatens football's very exis
tence. The act of tackling someone vio
lently, which is the only way a tackle
happens at both the collegiate and pro
fessional levels, may not be sufficient to
cause some type of diagnosable brain
trauma by itself; however, the more
frightening studies show that CTE can
be caused by repeated minor collisions,
like a lineman and defender hying to
block each other, or a running back
being thrown to the turf) or a receiver
being jammed at the line of the scrim
mage. The pimgent question becomes,
how do you remove the football from
football?
The NFLs stand on this issue has
been hypocritical at best. Despite
claiming to have players' best interests
at heart, the NFL continues to sched
ule Thursday night games, juggle bye
weeks around randomly and has hied
(and failed) for the last few years to
increase the season's length to 18 reg
ular season games. When you get a
chance, take a look at an injury report
for any team in the league; I personal
ly guarantee that you will see multiple
concussions and other severe injuries.
At all levels, as ESPN's ongoing
coverage of this issue proclaims, foot
ball truly is at a crossroads. Tackle
football is inherently a gladiatorial
sport, hearkening back to the days of
the Roman Coliseum and violent com
bat of ages past. The problem is that
the applause for a good hit now must
be tempered by the fact that the colli
sion in question may have cost some
one years of their life that they can
never get back.
The players at the highest level also
seemed bemused by rule changes. The
penalization of helmet-to-helmet hits is
sketchy at best; there seems to be no
rhyme or reason to the calls that are
and aren't made. More frustratingly
there are certain plays that happen so
quickly that it is impossible to react; if
a receiver ducks his head at the last
possible second into the helmet of a
defender, who is to blame?
The biggest elephant in the room,
by far, is the fact that fining players
means little when the damage has
already been done. If someone ends up
concussed on a play losing $15,000 or a
game paycheck is the least of their
worries.
Real lives are being affected by
what transpires on an athletic field.
The worst part is not knowing how to
fix the problem; with baseball, strict
PED testing has (supposedly) cleaned
up the game. With the NBA, the
offending referees in Tim Donaghy's
bombshell gambling scandal have been
removed. With the NHL ... well,
never mind. The point is that to "fix"
football, in a crystalline sense, the only
alternative is to make the NFL the
NTFL: the National Touch Football
League. This, I believe, satisfies the
definition of a quagmire of the highest
order.
Just six years ago, I man
aged to convince my parents to
let me play football. Back in the
good old days there wasn't as
much noise in the press about
concussions, Alzheimer's and
the startling propensity for
older football players to suffer
from debilitating neurological
disorders at significantly high
er rates than the rest of the
populace.
No, the toughest job I had
in convincing my parents was
explaining to them how I, as a
5-foot-nothing, 100 pound,
unathletic child, would ever be
able to compete. In fact, my
parents were more worried
about me getting demoralized
and physically hurt than about
the long-term consequences of
bashing helmets with other

kids my age from the months of
August through November.
So I played bail through
high school, mostly as a backup
QB, immune to the hitting drills
that studies show are most like
ly to cause brain damage. For
that I am ever thankful. Today,
when other parents ask me
what position their child should
play I wholeheartedly recom
mend other sports or tell them
to stick to flag football. I love,
breathe, eat and sleep football,
but even I have difficulty
answering the bell when some
one asks me if I would let my
kids play Given the evidence, it
is hard for me to say anything
other than no.

Twenty years ago, there was
n't ever any doubt that foot
ball would exist today Today,
that same prognostication
wouldn't necessarily hold
true.
Amid the backdrop of a new study
linking football to severe brain trauma,
players continuing to bemoan the
"pansification" of the game they love
and increasingly blurry lines between
clean hits and illegal ones, the storied
game of football faces an existential cri
sis unlike anything the sport has ever
seen.
Unlike steroid scandals (hello,
MLB), repeated lockouts (hello,
NHL), or even referees gambling on
games (hello, NBA), this issue isn't just
about a few bad eggs spoiling the
entire meal. The issue of head trauma
in all sports, but most importantly in
the NHL and the NFL, is one that will
determine the future of American
sports for generations to come.
