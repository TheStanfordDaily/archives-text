# CARD SWEEPS SAC STATE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Ahead of Tuesday's season
opening match, men's tennis
coach John Whitlinger acknowl
edged that it would be all but
impossible to replace two players
as dominant as graduated seniors
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher.

"When you have two guys who
have been at the top of the lineup
for basically the last four years, a
doubles team that's been among

the best in the nation, you're talk
ing about very big shoes to fill,"
Whitlinger said. "Now, I know
there are guys on the roster who
can step up for us. I just have to
see it once we get out there."
But with an impressive show
ing against Sac State at Taube
Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal
proved that the team makes up for
its lack of star power with plenty
of depth.
Without Klahn, a six-time All-
American and NCAA singles
champion in 2010, and Thacher, a
three-time Ail-American, Stanford
swept all six singles matches en
route to a 7-0 win over the Hornets.
After senior Matt Kandath and
sophomore John Morrissey

opened the match with a 8-6 win in
doubles, Morrissey cruised to a 6-
1, 6-3 victory over Aliaksandr
Malko in the No. 1 spot.
Despite losing six consecutive
games and the first set 6-0, Kandath
roared back to beat Marek Maksoo
0-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the No. 2 slot.
Nolan Paige's 6-3, 6-1 victory
over Sean Kolar in the No. 3 posi
tion was technically the match's
clincher, but Stanford didn't stop
there as Trey Strobel, Maciek
Romanowicz and Robert Stineman
completed a perfect afternoon for
the home side.
Paige, Strobel and Romanowicz
are all freshmen, something
Whitlinger alluded to on Monday
when he said that he "wouldn't be

surprised if two, or even three, of
the freshmen cracked the singles
lineup. Their IQ for the game and
work ethic are very good. Nolan
played well at ITA Regionals and
two of his wins were top-confer
ence guys in Kyle McMorrow and
Riki McLachlan. Maciek has a
great attitude on the court, Trey is
ranked in doubles with junior
Jamin Ball at No. 57 and Anthony
is a crafty player who I can also
see stepping up and winning a
match."
With the Hornets out of the
way, Stanford turns its attention to
the Aggies of Texas A&M, who will
visit the Farm on January 25th for

Although the Aggies are
currently No. 26 in the coun
try, anyone else Stanford
faces in the championship
rounds will likely be a top-20

path to Seattle, the site of the
finals to be held mid-
February, is one of the
toughest in the draw. If
Stanford can get past A&M,
