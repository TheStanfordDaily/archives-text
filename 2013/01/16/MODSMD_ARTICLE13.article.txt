# Double defeat at Maples
## UConn and Cal snap Stanford's streaks 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
One of the most impressive things at Maples
Pavilion is its banner display of Stanford
women's basketball's illustrious history. Since
current head coach Tara VanDerveer arrived
on the Farm in 1985, the Cardinal has won 21
Pac-10/12 conference titles, including the last
12 straight. It has also won two national titles
and is currently on a streak of five-straight
NCAA Final Four appearances. In fact, just
one of Stanford's 26 postseason showings came
before VanDerveer's arrival.
Until the last two home games, the Card
also held three impressive honors. It was the
nation's top-ranked team, had the longest
active home winning streak in the country at 82
games and had not lost a single contest against
any team in its conference for over three years.
Maples Pavilion had become a fortress that not
even a double national title-winning team could
break down.
When Connecticut came to campus in
December 2011 it was the nation's best team,
on a record-setting 99-game streak that includ
ed to NCAA crowns. It left with a 71-59 defeat
and without the No. 1 ranking.
But the Huskies paid that compliment back
less than a month ago, snapping Stanford's
home-streak and replacing the Cardinal at the
top of the national rankings with a dominant

61-35 display.
Then, archrival California rubbed salt into
Stanford's wounds by serving up its first loss in
the conference for 81 games last Sunday and
giving the Card its first double-loss home
streak since March 2001. The 67-55 defeat, pay
back for Stanford's win five days previously at
Berkeley, left the two teams tied for third place
in the conference on 3-1 behind the leading 4-0
LA schools.
This weekend, both UCLA and USC will
visit the Bay Area to play games that may now
be seriously important for whichever of these
four teams makes a run at the conference title.

"This is just what the doctor ordered for
us," VanDerveer said. "I think sometimes it's
tough for our team to have, I don't know, 'feel
good' wins. We beat Utah, we beat Colorado, we
beat Cal at Cal, but it's like, we're supposed to
beat these people. I think this is a great oppor
tunity for our team to come in and we'll have to
play well to win and people can feel good about
it."
Putting the disappointment of double home
losses aside, VanDerveer sees some benefit in
the resurgence of these other teams in the Pac-

Stanford, but must now find away for her team to bounce back from double home defeats.
