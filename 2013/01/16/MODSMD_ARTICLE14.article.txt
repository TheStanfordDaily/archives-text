# OPINIONS
## OP-ED SSNW's arguments are illogical, poorly constructed 
### RACHEL WRIGHT Ph.D. Candidate, Sociology 
On Monday, Georgetown
ROTC cadet Dominick Healey
wrote a letter to the editor
challenging Stanford Says No to
War's opposition to ROTC at
Stanford. Yesterday, Eric Craig
Sapp, a member of Stanford Says
No to War (SSNW), responded to
Healey with a letter to the editor
and seemed offended that Healey
assumed that SSNW opposes
ROTC because it "doesn't like war."
In doing so, Sapp misses the point.
Healey criticizes SSNW because
it uses weak pragmatic arguments,
while ignoring what Healey
assumes is a moral opposition to
ROTC based in SSNW's own views
on war Healey then asks SSNW to
treat the topic with more intellectu
al honesty. Healey is an ROTC
cadet; I, on the other hand, partici
pated in many anti-war protests
immediately following the
Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
Nonetheless, I join Healey in
asking SSNW and other opponents
of ROTC to be more truthful. I will
contend that Sapp's unrealistic sce
narios, lack of clear argumentation
and opinions disguised as fact are
sufficient to disregard SSNW's
positions as "absurd." Fhrthermore,
I will argue that, from a more honest
and pragmatic anti-war perspective,
one can support ROTC on campus.
The absurdity begins with
Sapp's claim that ROTC militarizes
campus, making Stanford a military
installation and a potential military
target. Since Stanford does not host
large-scale military weaponry, let's
narrowly define militarization as the
mobilization of troops for war. Since
military personnel make up about
.7% of the adult population in
California, ROTC would need near
ly 100 cadets to make Stanford as
militarized as the rest of the state. If
concern about attack is the issue, it
is unclear why even 100 ROTC
members would present a realistic
military target when there are
dozens of large military bases and
installations all along the West
Coast not to mention plenty of
weapons reserves, fuel sources and
interstate highways for the enemy
to attack.
Next, Sapp engages in an argu
ment about the role of the academy,
suggesting that it is "conducive to
the free pursuit of knowledge and
ideas when it is to the greatest extent
possible, a neutral space." Sapp is
right that by bringing ROTC back to
campus the University would be pro
viding material support to mili
tarism. That said, Stanford provides
material support to the propagation
of many ideologies, some of which
have justified violence, by hosting
groups that represent several of the
world's major religions and organiza
tions that take sides on numerous
controversial political issues like
abortion. It is entirely unclear what
makes Stanford a neutral space on
these issues, but qualifies it as "tak
ing sides in an active armed conflict"
by allowing ROTC a more visible
presence.

Sapp comes closer to discussing
his true concerns about the terrible
consequences of war when he states
that the military's "primary purpose
is to efficiently apply coercion,
threats, destruction and death." It's
too bad this statement is completely
disingenuous. The mission of the
Department of Defense is "to pro
vide the military forces needed to
deter war and to protect the securi

ty of our country." Since SSNW is
concerned about militarization, the
question it should be asking is if and
how the US military can deter war
and protect the security of our coun
try two aims that I assume we all
agree are important.
Like SSNW members, I would
prefer a world in which combat spe
cialists, weapons, bombs and vio
lence didn't exist. Sadly, in the real
world, real national leaders perpe
trate violence and threaten basic
human rights. World War II demon
strated that there are some govern
ments that will not negotiate, do not
adhere to treaties and do not share
SSNW's enlightenment values. In
these cases, there must be some
means of self-defense available. In
less extreme cases, the mere exis
tence of a physical defense may
deter acts of war.
Given these realities, as prag
matic, moral members of society
and serious objectors to war, we
must ask, "What type of military
leader is most likely to prefer deter
rence and conduct defense with min
imal destruction and maximal
humanity?" For my part, I want mil
itary leaders who have explored the
social sciences and humanities. I
want military leaders who know and
can learn foreign languages so they
can communicate with the other side
before making fatal mistakes. I
want military leaders who have
been trained to think through com
plex problems and have been tested
on finding solutions so that combat
can be avoided at all costs. I want
military leaders whose viewpoints
have been challenged and who
respect the logic, validity and pas
sion with which those viewpoints are
held. Most importantly, I want mili
tary leaders who have friends from
every country in the world and
every state in this nation. I want
military leaders who understand
that, without regard to race or reli
gion, all peoples on this earth are
human, of equal worth and entitled
to equal rights.
To the extent that college
uniquely hones these skills, provides
these opportunities and develops
these values, integrated, interna
tional college campuses like
Stanford may be ideal places for the
training of military officers.
Yet, on the point of officer train
ing, Sapp veers from his values
again. He says officer training
should happen after graduation at
Officer Candidate Schools because
these schools would be more effec
tive by military standards. SSNW
loses all credibility by defending a
position using military standards
because it has already suggested
military standards are undesirable.
If SSNW wants to weigh in on train
ing, it should try coming up with its
own standards.
In the future, I hope opponents
of ROTC like SSNW will make
clearer, more logical arguments
about why ROTC is a threat to then
own values of peace, justice and
human rights. While these argu
ments might be more complicated,
they would also be more compelling
because they have to do with real
concerns, not empty hyperbole. As a
group ostensibly dedicated to peace
and justice, SSNW's current opposi
tion to ROTC does little to clarify
why this is a fight worth fighting.
