# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Screen Time 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Imagine a face-to-face conversa
tion. This conversation is special.
Not only does it take place in real
time, with real people; it takes place
without the interruption of vibrating
phones, dinging text messages, or
open laptop screens.
I'm a big fan of texting; I don't like
the sound of my voice on the phone.
I'm not too big a fan of texting-while
chatting, though. Or the feeling of
ball and chain that tethers me to my
phone. I'm not receiving messages at
all hours of the day, but I carry my
phone to the dining hall, the library,
my classes, as though I were a very
important person with very impor
tant messages to attend to at all
times.
I'm a fan of email as well. On email
I rattle off incomplete sentences and
incomplete thoughts without an
ounce of self-chastisement. But I
spew incomplete sentences too often,

vigilantly attending my laptop in
hopes of receiving incomplete replies.
I no longer look at the keyboard to
type my SUNet ID and password.
My fingers perform the sequence by
rote, in a trance. I check my email
after I wake up, during lunch breaks,
before bed. It's an illness, I'm certain.
The typical evening conversation
in my Suite starts with one of the four
members of our clan diving for the
couch. Someone wanders from her
room and claims the armchair. How
was your day? Shitty day. I slept
through my first class and was late all
day. Ugh that sucks. The other two
players wander out, occupying the
remaining real estate. News
exchanged, comfort offered, nails
painted. I should probably start my
homework. The first laptop screen
opens.
It is then that I notice four* laptops
and four cell phones privy to the con-

versation unwinding. The three
remaining screens unfold, and cast all
four faces in their characteristic blue
light. I scour the past ten minutes for
clues, but can't recall bringing my
laptop and phone to the table. Yet
here I am, writing this from the couch
of my Suite's common room, simulta
neously reaching for my phone and
lending only one ear to three of the
women about whom I care most.
They deserve both ears and both
eyes.
I get the creepy feeling that the
laptops are jaws waiting to clamp
down on our heads. And the phones,
jealous sprites trying to steal our
attention from one another. Okay,
maybe an overactive imagination.
But the issue remains. Not the issue
of too much technology, but the issue
of a generation of multi-taskers. A
generation who can write code while
offering relationship advice, but who
feels naked when required to per
form one task at once. A task like
conversation. Or listening. Trust
me, I hold myself accountable.
The plague infects more than liv
ing room chat. Remember the last
time you went to a party without your
phone? Me neither. Because natural
ly, when you attend an event where
you intend to meet people, you would
want to check out and check text mes
sages. Check in. Look me in the eye
and talk to me. Close the screen, pock
et the phone, cut the tether and ask a
question. How was your day? Shitty
day. I slept through my first class and
was late all day. Ugh that sucks tell
me what else happened.
