## Penev earns MPSF Gymnast of the Week honors 
### 
Yesterday the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation named Stanford senior Eddie
Penev as its Gymnast of the Week after he
helped the No. 3 Cardinal defeat No. 6
California 425.000-411.150 in the season
opener across the Bay on Sunday.
The Rochester, N.Y., native and five-time
All-American is currently ranked first in the
country in both the floor and all-around
events. True to form, he took top spot in both,
with scores of 15.650 and 85.200, respectively,
and also added second- and third-place finish
es on the parallel bars (14.700) and high bar
(13.850).
In three years at Stanford, Penev has won
three national titles, winning the vault in his
freshman year and both that and the floor
exercise last season.
Next up, Stanford faces a rematch with
the Bears on home territory when it wel
comes No. 4 Oklahoma, No. 5 Nebraska and
California to campus this Saturday.
