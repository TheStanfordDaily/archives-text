# Food trucks begin service
## ASSU initiative brings food trucks to campus under new policy 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
Food truck management compa
ny Off the Grid has partnered with
Stanford under the University's
new mobile food vendor policy to
provide late night and lunchtime
food truck options. The first late
night food trucks appeared on cam
pus on Jan. 11 and 12.
"There were existing policies
already about how vendors and
commercial businesses operate on
campus, so this just extended them
to food trucks, which are a unique
business operation," University
Spokesperson Lisa Lapin said.
"But the real impetus [for creating
the policy] was the increasing popu
larity and variety of food trucks and
the recognition that with a larger
number of them, we needed to
make sure that they are really pro
viding the best service to the cam
pus community."
Following an initiative from
ASSU Executives Robbie Zimbroff
and William Wagstaff, a University
committee studied how best to pro
vide food trucks to locations that
had limited access to food service.
The committee, led by Assistant
Vice President for Business
Development Susan Weinstein,
included representatives of multi
ple offices including Student Affairs
and Business Development.
The committee found that the
most effective way to provide food
trucks on campus was through food

truck management company Off
the Grid, which now manages food
truck pods from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Monday through Friday and 10 p.m.
to 1 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays.
During lunch hours, one truck will
be located on Lomita Mall instead
of its previous parking spot on
Santa Teresa Street to avoid com
petition with eateries at Tresidder
Union.
"Our communication from
Stanford has been very clear about
the standards it wants us to bring to
campus through the different food
options that we would provide,"
said Off the Grid founder Matt
Cohen. "They're really consistent
with what we're trying to do, which
is really diverse food offerings that
are both healthy and reliably there
for people."
Off the Grid has worked with the
ASSU before, catering tailgates at
football games, and Cohen
expressed optimism about the con
tinued partnership.
"We're excited that the ASSU's
excited, and so we're banking on
them to communicate that there are
these options available late at night
and for people to take advantage of
it," Cohen said.
According to Zimbroff, food
trucks have agreed to advertise
only to people in the Stanford com
munity, citing public safety reasons.
