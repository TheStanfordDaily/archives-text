## Aero, lab develops open-source software 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
In the world of aerospace
engineering, the problems are
hard, but their solutions are often
harder. In this field of science,
understanding the governing
equations of flow are key to find
ing such solutions, but this used
to require an expensive piece of
software often $50,000 per
license. Thanks to a group of
Stanford researchers, that will
now change.
On Jan. 15 in the William H.
Durand Building, the Aerospace
Design Laboratory (ADL) held a
workshop to release its new proj
ect; a free, open-source program
for designing computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) codes used in
aerospace engineering.
The team officially unveiled
the open-source CFD code,
known as Stanford University
Unstructured (SU2), during the
workshop. The new software
aims to compute accurate numer
ical portraits of the flow over an
airfoil or other surface.
In June 2011, the ADL team
began working towards a first
version of SU2. Francisco
Palacios, who provided a skele
ton of the code at the out
set, laid out the vision
for the code's
structure.

"We literally started from
scratch," he said. "This was the
type of job that would take 10
people working full-time for six
months to get a basic code up and
running."
The ADL team decided to
write the program in C++ to
exploit its objected-oriented
properties.
"Basically, we didn't want to
have to rewrite elements of the
code that were already imple
mented," ADL member Sean
Copeland 'lO M.S., 'l3 Ph.D. said.
The team also added a Python
interface in order to "cool the
code," in Palacios' words, and
because Python is used extensive
ly in the scientific community.
During the event, three prob
lem solving workshops were held
to introduce attendees to the code,
and members of the Aeronautics
and Astronautics lab, includ
ing Francisco Palacios,
research associate and
founder of the
group, and Juan
Alonso,

associate professor of aeronautics
and astronautics, spoke about the
program.
After six months of building
and testing the code, the first ver
sion of SU2 was released in
January 2012, and has
since undergone two
major upgrades, with
planned stable releases
every six months for the fore
seeable future.
The ADL team has made a

significant effort to grow the SU2
community through outreach
efforts that include Facebook,
Twitter and an online forum.
Leading researchers from around
the world have also reached out to
the ADL team about joining a
SU2 core development team.

dents, developers from a variety

that fit their particular inter
ests," Palacios said.
SU2 has already been
downloaded more than
3,000 times in 114 different
countries, and is currently
being used in the design of a
supersonic passenger jet,

which promises three-hour
flights across the United
States with the same engine
efficiency as today's stan
dard commercial trans
ports.
The event attracted a
continuum of companies and
individuals, some of whom
have no direct connection to
fluid dynamics, in addition to
leading academic institu
tions such as MIT, NASA,
medical device makers and
large aerospace and defense

companies.
Although the response
has been positive to the
ADEs latest batch of
upgrades, Copeland con
cedes that the job is far from
over.
"We aim to pursue the
state of the art, and until
that has been done, our job
won't be completed,"
Copeland said.
