## Farouk Dey is new CDC head 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
Farouk Dey will assume the post of associate vice
provost and executive director of Career
Development Services in April 2013. He will replace
outgoing director Lance Choy, who has held the posi
tion since 1999.

Dey comes to Stanford from Carnegie Mellon,
where he served as the director of the Career and
Professional Development Center. He previously
worked in the University of Florida's Career

Resource Center.
"It sounds like this is a great time of transition for
career services at Stanford University, and to have
the opportunity to come and build and innovative,
cutting-edge and futuristic career services model at a
premier institution like Stanford is a dream come
true," Dey said.
Civil and Environmental Engineering graduate
student Subhan Ali Ph.D. 'l4 served as a student rep
resentative on the eight-member search committee.
Ali, who also serves on the
Stanford Alumni
Association's Board of
Directors, said the commit
tee was looking for some
body who could steer the
Career Development Center
(CDC) into its next phase.
"We were looking for
somebody to really look at
all these changes that are
going on and just do it in an
amazing way the way
we're used to doing things at
Stanford," Ali said.
The search committee,
led by University Registrar
Tom Black, interviewed two
finalists on campus over the
course of two days. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman announced
the appointment on Jan. 15.
Dey, who earned his doc
toral degree in higher educa
tion administration from the
University of Florida, said
that he often used Stanford's
career services office as a
benchmark for the success of

his own programs.
Among Dey's goals as he
takes over direction of the
CDC are the integration of
technology into career serv
ices, the engagement of
alumni and the development
of new mentoring models.
He believes social media
can increase accessibility to
career services and might
prompt students to think
about their career develop
ment earlier in the process.
"The integration of tech
nology is something I have
worked a lot on throughout
my career and have really
generated a lot of success,"
Dey said. "I would imagine a
population like the Stanford
student population would be
very receptive to that, and
probably even hungry for
it."
Dey said that he would

like to provide more services
to alumni to promote alumni
participation in educating
students, providing more
internships, externships and
job shadowing or mentoring
opportunities to students
with the ultimate goal of get
ting alumni to offer students
jobs. He also hopes to
restructure the mentoring
programs at Stanford to cre
ate the opportunity for every
student to have a mentor.
"The place a career
development center can play
is in engaging students from
day one, from the day they
enroll in the University, in
the process of thinking about
...who they are as persons
and who they are as profes
sionals."
