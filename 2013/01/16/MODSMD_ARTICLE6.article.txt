## Senators discuss next elections Senators discuss student petitions, buffer fund, ARP 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
At the sparsely attended ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting
last night, senators announced the
creation of new projects for winter
quarter and discussed the progress
of their Alternative Review Process
(ARP) recommendations.
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5 said
that the Alternative Review
Process (ARP) subcommittee met
with the Board of Judicial Affairs
(BJA) regarding the Senate's pro
posed changes to the ARE
According to Miller, the BJA had no
major issues with the Senate's pro
posal.
"They were really receptive and
really excited to work with us,"
Miller said. "Most of the things we
talked about weren't really changes
but clarifications of what we
meant."
The only significant change,
according to Miller, was the cre
ation of guidelines regulating what
questions would be permitted in
the cross-examination process. The
BJA determined that all questions
would be presented unless they are
deemed invalid or inappropriate.
According to Miller, the BJA
will likely approve a slightly modi
fied version of the Senate's recom
mendations "without a problem"
and send the ARP back to the
Senate for another vote before it is
sent to the Faculty Senate. Miller
predicts that the Faculty Senate
will approve the recommendations
as well.
"They just want to know if the
students are okay with it,"
Miller said. "They don't
anticipate any problems with
it."

As their role in the ARP
deliberations winds down,
senators are launching new
initiatives for winter quar
ter. Student Life Committee
Chair Viraj Bindra 'l5 said
he is developing a system
where students can submit
a petition about any aspect
of campus life that they
believe should be changed.
Bindra noted that this pro
gram would likely be similar
to the petition system cur
rently in place at the White
House.
Senator Anna Brezhneva
'l5 said she is working with
a student at Yale to create a
version of Yale's Class
Roulette website for Stanford.
The Class Roulette system
involves logging on to a web
site and pressing the space
bar, which randomly gener
ates a list of ten classes.
Class Roulette also provides
the professor names, meet
ing times, class descriptions
and any prerequisites for the
randomly generated classes,
and links to Yale's Bluebook,
which Brezhneva said was
the equivalent of Explore
Courses.
Brianna Pang 'l3, the
current ASSU elections
commissioner, visited the
Senate during open forum to
discuss issues relating to the
upcoming ASSU elections.
Pang said that senators
should help to ensure that
more people run for Senate
seats this year, as last year
there was "barely anyone
running," with only 19 stu

dents competing for the 15
Senate seats.

"I see you guys as the
primary ASSU ambassadors
for the rest of campus," Pang
said. "You should be getting
people to these info sessions
and getting them interested
in basically taking over your
jobs next year and ensuring
a good transition."

ASSU Assistant
Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 also spoke to
the Senate about a bill on
previous notice that he wrote
with Financial Manager
Neveen Mahmoud 'll. If
approved, the bill would allow
Mahmoud to spend $4,000
from the Under graduate
Senate's buffer fund and
$4,000 from the GSC's
buffer fund in order to make
upgrades to the system that
runs MyGroups2.
MyGroups2 is "the pri
mary accounting tool for the
ASSU and student groups,"
according to Trusheim's bill.
He said that the problems
with the current system are
threefold, as the hardware is
likely to fail because of its
age, the software is no
longer supported by the
original vendors and is vul
nerable to hackers and the
servers are not secure from
theft, malicious intent or
natural disasters.
"We want to solve all
three of those issues at once
by moving the computers to
the University's secure data
center, throwing out the old
computers and buying new
ones and buying more mod
ern versions of all the soft
ware with long term support
contracts on them all,"
Trusheim said.

Miller put a series of
amendments to the ASSU
bylaws on previous notice to
be debated next week,
including several amend

ments that clarify the
Senate's attendance policy,
which was an issue of discus
sion last quarter. While the
attendance policy currently
states that senators may not
miss three meetings per
quarter, the new policy will
state that only one of these
three absences may be unex
cused, and that if a senator
has more than one unex
cused absence, a bill will be
drafted for his or her expul
sion.

The proposed amend
ments define an unexcused
absence as "an instance in
which the senator in ques
tion did not notify either the
Chair, Deputy Chair, or
Chair of Administration &
Rules of their absence 24
hours in advance," though it
states that special excep
tions can be made at the
Chair's discretion.

At last night's meeting,
only nine of the 14 senators
were present, which Miller
said was a result of the flu.
All of the absences were
excused, according to Miller.
Though Appropriations
Chair Nancy Pham 'l4 was
absent, Senate Chair
Branden Crouch 'l4 told
senators that Pham had mis
counted the number of
applications for the first
round of "Redefining
Student Life: The 80K
Challenge," the Senate's
new initiative to spend some
of the money in its large
buffer fund. According to
Crouch, 20 general fees
groups applied to receive
additional funds for winter
quarter events, a correction
of Pham's statement at the
Jan. 13 meeting of the
Appropriations Committee
that only 12 groups applied.
