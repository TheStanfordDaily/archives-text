## VP for Online Learning awards 14 seed grants 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Aaron Sekhri 
The office of the Vice Provost for Online
Learning has awarded 14 grants to professors
wishing to realize their experiments in online
education. The recipients of the grants came
from disciplines ranging from materials sci
ence to psychiatry.
The majority of the grants have been
awarded to educators whose aim is to imple
ment online learning technology positively for
Stanford students and not for a global, online
audience. Instructors were made aware of the
result of the grant awards at the end of fall
quarter.
Mathematics Professor Rafe Mazzeo, for
example, proposed to develop online aides to
supplement and enhance Math 51 lectures for
both the Stanford students who take the class
every year and the Education Program for
Gifted Youth participants who take the course
every summer.
Associate Professor of Microbiology and
Immunology Robert Siegel will use his grant
to enhance the learning experience of his Bing
Overseas Studies Program summer seminar,
Biological and Cultural Aspects of Island
Geography: Madagascar.
Students in the seminar will create video
material on a number of subjects, ranging
from culture to climate change that will be
used by students in later seminars and in a
Sophomore Seminar in 2014.
Professor of Computer Science Jennifer
Widom was also given a seed grant to teach
Introduction to Databases on Class2Go. She
had previously taught the class using
Coursera. Her class is open to public and cur
rently has at least 37,000 students enrolled.
The next round for VPOL seed grants will
open in mid-February and then once again at
the end of Spring Quarter.
