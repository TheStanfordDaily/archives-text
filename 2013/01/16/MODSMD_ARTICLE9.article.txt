# Udacity to partner with San Jose State University

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Aaron Sekhri 
Udacity announced a partnership with San
Jose State University (SJSU), bringing the
online course platform to a physical campus in
a move that San Jose State president
Mohammad Qayoumi hopes will be a "game
changer."
The partnership, announced at a press con
ference Tuesday morning, involves the cre
ation of entry-level and remedial courses.
Udacity is the brainchild of Sebastian
Thrun, a former Stanford lecturer, and is one
of the growing number of online course plat
forms with origins in the Farm.
Three courses will be offered at a cost of
$l5O each, expenses that are mostly for admin
istration, with any profits to be split by
Udacity and SJSU. The three courses will be
pre-algebra, algebra and statistics and will be
taught by five professors.
The pilot program is restricted to only 300
students, half from the University and half
from local community colleges and high
schools, with the program monitored by
SJSU using National Science Foundation
funding.
The course will be designed to take advan
tage of Udacity's online infrastructure but will
also include human interaction between its
online lectures and quizzes.
"It's easy to get lost in an online course,"
said Ellen Junn, San Jose State's provost.
Students will study their lectures at their
own pace, and despite the promises the collab
oration offers, Thrun emphasized that this
remains an experiment.
"There's a big 'if' here because we are very
skeptical ourselves whether this actually
works," he said. "We set it up as an experi
ment of scale, but we don't know if this is a
viable path to education."
