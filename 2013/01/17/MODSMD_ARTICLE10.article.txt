# SoCal Weekend
## Pepperdine, USC host Card 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
On Friday night, No. 2
Stanford Men's Volleyball (4-0,
1-0 MPSF) heads to southern
California to take on No. 7 USC
(1-1, 1-1 MPSF) in its first road
test of the season.
Memories of 2012 are fresh
in Stanford's mind, when the
Cardinal fell to the Trojans in
both of last season's contests,
extending the series losing
streak to four. USC made it all
the way to the NCAA champi
onship game before falling to
UC Irvine in three sets.
The Cardinal is coming off its
most exciting win of the season
on Saturday against Pacific. The
Cardinal faced three match
points at 14-11 in the fifth and
final set before finally prevail
ing, 19-17.
Juniors Brian Cook and Eric
Mochalski have been stalwarts
for Stanford — Cook leads the
team with 4.21 kills per set and
Mochalski leads the Card with
1.50 blocks per set — but per
haps the biggest story of the
season is the play of freshman
James Shaw. Shaw, a 6-foot7 set
ter from Woodside, Calif., has
been thrown into the MPSF fire,
and the Cardinal is excited to
see how he progresses with
experience.
Don't think that Stanford's
No. 2 ranking will intimidate the
Trojans. Its last time out, USC
swept No. 1 UC Irvine, the
defending NCAA Champions.
The Trojans dominated the
Anteaters on their own court,
holding UC Irvine to .183 hit
ting.
Sophomore middle blocker
Robert Feathers hit .526 with six
blocks to lead USC. Feathers'
performances against UC-
Irvine and UC-San Diego
earned him AVCA National
Player of the Week honors.
With both teams coming into
the game on an emotional high,
