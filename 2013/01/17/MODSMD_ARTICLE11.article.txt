# How did Te'o hoax survive for so long?
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There are no secrets on the
Internet. Manti Te'o begs
to differ. And I, for one, am
on his side. I do not like
Notre Dame for many,
many reasons, but I hope that Manti
Te'o comes out today for his press
conference and stares at the sea of
reporters, all salivating over a chance
to tear Notre Dame's fallen star to
shreds, and tells them to shove it.
I hope that before they get to lay
into him and spin him in circles with
their questions about Lennay Kekua
and how he possibly could have been
duped into such an incredible story
and how he could have perpetuated
this myth and how he could possibly
not have anything to do with the hoax
— before all of that —I hope he asks
the media assembled in front of him
why they did not do their due dili
gence to help him out.
Because that should just about
shut everyone in that room up.
Because they all missed it. And I
missed it. And the world of journal
ism missed it.
For that I am sorry, and for that
Manti Te'o should really be upset.
Imagine the shame and misery and
pain we could have saved him if we
had just told him, "hey, Lennay
Kekua didn't die because she never
existed."
It would have been quicker, easier,
and maybe then he wouldn't have
been a Hesiman candidate, because
the voters wouldn't have been able to
fall back on the hype and the "intan
gibles" and the "heart" that he
showed in preserving through such a
tough season.
And at the very least, we would
have preserved the memory and
passing of Teo's grandmother, who
beneath all the layers of hoax did in
fact die a few days before Notre
Dame played Michigan State.
Instead we are left with a mess
