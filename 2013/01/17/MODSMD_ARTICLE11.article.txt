# How did Te'o hoax survive for so long?
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
There are no secrets on the
Internet. Manti Te'o begs
to differ. And I, for one, am
on his side. I do not like
Notre Dame for many,
many reasons, but I hope that Manti
Te'o comes out today for his press
conference and stares at the sea of
reporters, all salivating over a chance
to tear Notre Dame's fallen star to
shreds, and tells them to shove it.
I hope that before they get to lay
into him and spin him in circles with
their questions about Lennay Kekua
and how he possibly could have been
duped into such an incredible story
and how he could have perpetuated
this myth and how he could possibly
not have anything to do with the hoax
— before all of that —I hope he asks
the media assembled in front of him
why they did not do their due dili
gence to help him out.
Because that should just about
shut everyone in that room up.
Because they all missed it. And I
missed it. And the world of journal
ism missed it.
For that I am sorry, and for that
Manti Te'o should really be upset.
Imagine the shame and misery and
pain we could have saved him if we
had just told him, "hey, Lennay
Kekua didn't die because she never
existed."
It would have been quicker, easier,
and maybe then he wouldn't have
been a Hesiman candidate, because
the voters wouldn't have been able to
fall back on the hype and the "intan
gibles" and the "heart" that he
showed in preserving through such a
tough season.
And at the very least, we would
have preserved the memory and
passing of Teo's grandmother, who
beneath all the layers of hoax did in
fact die a few days before Notre
Dame played Michigan State.
Instead we are left with a mess

bigger than what I imagine
happened after Azia Kim was
discovered hiding in the
lounge at Okada.
And personally, I am left to
wonder exactly how I could
possibly have missed this sto
ry. Because I should have been
the one to tell this story, or
perhaps Sam Fisher, or Joey

Beyda, or George Chen or
Billy Gallagher or even maybe
Brendan O'Byrne.
Not a senior at Columbia
who works for Deadspin. Me.
Here's why I'm still not
famous....
In every story you will ever
see about this hoax, Lennay
Kekua will forever be remem
bered as a former Stanford
student who met Te'o on the
field, near the field, in the
stands, at a club, by the team
bus well, no one is sure
where it allegedly took place if
it even was a physical meeting
and not just a message via
Twitter.
In any case, Kekua will be
remembered as a Stanford
student who was in a tragic car
accident, then found out she
had leukemia and underwent
cancer treatment all while
maintaining a relationship
with Te'o.
It was an incredible story,
the kind that movies are made
out of, especially when the
Notre Dame star linebacker
who wore his heart on his sleeve
lost both Kekua and his grand
mother in supposedly a six
hour window just days before
taking on Michigan State.
You can watch the Youtube
video of Te'o being inter
viewed after the game, where
he is veiy emotional and clear
ly pained as he discusses his
loss. ESPN picked it up and
put it into the hypemachine, in
a major, almost-worthy-of-
TimTebowway.
And as the season went on
and Notre Dame kept win
ning, Te'o's story became even
bigger and better.
Sports Illustrated's Pete
Thamel took the mantle of
chief Te'o trumpeter when he
wrote a cover story for the
magazine in October. In it,
Thamel reported the precise
date of Kekua's supposedly
almost-deadly car accident
(April 28) and stated that her

"relatives told [Te'o] that at
her lowest points, as she
fought to emerge from a coma,
her breathing rate would
increase at the sound of his
voice."
He went on to sound Te'o's
praises again in December
when he explained that Kekua
wrote Te'o a series of inspira
tional notes before her pass
ing, and that her brother
Kainoa and sister U'ilani
"would read the letters to
Manti" to help soothe his pain.
"It's given me a sense of
strength and perseverance,"
the Heisman Trophy finalist
told the Thamel.
Except that it Kainoa and
U'ilani can't exist either... not
the point, ok let's refocus.
In none of all of that major
coverage of Te'o and Kekua,
however, did any reporter
mention that this girl had sup
posedly attended Stanford.
Oh, how I wish they had,
because if anybody on my
sports staff had caught a sniff
of Lennay Kekua, Stanford
student and told me, I would
have lost my mind.
Sure it's easier to say this
in hindsight, but there is no
chance that I don't have an
inkling of girl that was in a
major car accident, then has
leukemia, and all the while is
the girlfriend of a major star in
Manti Te'o. No way.
I would have been writing
that story when Te'o played
Stanford, like every year. It
would have been a good angle
in 2010, and in 2011 and in 2012.
But the only outlet to report it
apparently was the South Bend
Tribune, which has very conve
niently pulled that story from
its web site. But very clearly in
a story from October 12 did the
Tribune write that "Kekua, who
eventually graduated from
Stanford, was, in fact, doing so
well that she was released from
the hospital on Sept. 10."
The New York Times also

identified her as a "Stanford
graduate" in a story the day
after, so I guess that was my
best chance to call baloney and
I didn't read it. But I also feel
no one else on campus did
either, because I would have
expected any of you to also be
suspicious that this Stanford
grad wouldn't have friends, a
vigil, a million RIP Eacebook
posts, something.
Which is no excuse for the
media's mishandling of the sit
uation. Maybe the Tribune
made that part up or ran with
it with no sources and only a
faint rumor. I don't know, I'd
never willingly go to their site
in my life.
Which is why I accept your
criticism, and I welcome it
because you are right to be
disappointed with us at this
time.
Don't accept ESPN colum
nist Gene Wojciechowski's
lame response that he couldn't
find an obituary for Lennay
Kekua and couldn't find any
records about a car accident
and ignored the obvious red
flags because essentially Te'o
told him to back off.
'And so in that instance,
and at that moment, you sim
ply think that you have to
respect those wishes," said
Wojciechowski. "Short of ask
ing to see a death certificate,
I'm not sure what most people
would do differently in that
case."
We should have done bet
ter, because as any journalist
knows, there are always
secrets on the Internet and it's
always our job to find them.

Te'o comes out today for his press
conference and stares at the sea of
reporters, all salivating over a chance
to tear Notre Dame's fallen star to
shreds, and tells them to shove it.
I hope that before they get to lay
into him and spin him in circles with
their questions about Lennay Kekua
and how he possibly could have been
duped into such an incredible story
and how he could have perpetuated
this myth and how he could possibly
not have anything to do with the hoax
— before all of that —I hope he asks
the media assembled in front of him
why they did not do their due dili
gence to help him out.
Because that should just about
shut everyone in that room up.
Because they all missed it. And I
missed it. And the world of journal
ism missed it.
For that I am sorry, and for that
Manti Te'o should really be upset.
Imagine the shame and misery and
pain we could have saved him if we
had just told him, "hey, Lennay
Kekua didn't die because she never
existed."
It would have been quicker, easier,
and maybe then he wouldn't have
been a Hesiman candidate, because
the voters wouldn't have been able to
fall back on the hype and the "intan
gibles" and the "heart" that he
showed in preserving through such a
tough season.
And at the very least, we would
have preserved the memory and
passing of Teo's grandmother, who
beneath all the layers of hoax did in
fact die a few days before Notre
Dame played Michigan State.
Instead we are left with a mess

bigger than what I imagine
happened after Azia Kim was
discovered hiding in the
lounge at Okada.
And personally, I am left to
wonder exactly how I could
possibly have missed this sto
ry. Because I should have been
the one to tell this story, or
perhaps Sam Fisher, or Joey

Beyda, or George Chen or
Billy Gallagher or even maybe
Brendan O'Byrne.
Not a senior at Columbia
who works for Deadspin. Me.
Here's why I'm still not
famous....
In every story you will ever
see about this hoax, Lennay
Kekua will forever be remem
bered as a former Stanford
student who met Te'o on the
field, near the field, in the
stands, at a club, by the team
bus well, no one is sure
where it allegedly took place if
it even was a physical meeting
and not just a message via
Twitter.
In any case, Kekua will be
remembered as a Stanford
student who was in a tragic car
accident, then found out she
had leukemia and underwent
cancer treatment all while
maintaining a relationship
with Te'o.
It was an incredible story,
the kind that movies are made
out of, especially when the
Notre Dame star linebacker
who wore his heart on his sleeve
lost both Kekua and his grand
mother in supposedly a six
hour window just days before
taking on Michigan State.
You can watch the Youtube
video of Te'o being inter
viewed after the game, where
he is veiy emotional and clear
ly pained as he discusses his
loss. ESPN picked it up and
put it into the hypemachine, in
a major, almost-worthy-of-
TimTebowway.
And as the season went on
and Notre Dame kept win
ning, Te'o's story became even
bigger and better.
Sports Illustrated's Pete
Thamel took the mantle of
chief Te'o trumpeter when he
wrote a cover story for the
magazine in October. In it,
Thamel reported the precise
date of Kekua's supposedly
almost-deadly car accident
(April 28) and stated that her

"relatives told [Te'o] that at
her lowest points, as she
fought to emerge from a coma,
her breathing rate would
increase at the sound of his
voice."
He went on to sound Te'o's
praises again in December
when he explained that Kekua
wrote Te'o a series of inspira
tional notes before her pass
ing, and that her brother
Kainoa and sister U'ilani
"would read the letters to
Manti" to help soothe his pain.
"It's given me a sense of
strength and perseverance,"
the Heisman Trophy finalist
told the Thamel.
Except that it Kainoa and
U'ilani can't exist either... not
the point, ok let's refocus.
In none of all of that major
coverage of Te'o and Kekua,
however, did any reporter
mention that this girl had sup
posedly attended Stanford.
Oh, how I wish they had,
because if anybody on my
sports staff had caught a sniff
of Lennay Kekua, Stanford
student and told me, I would
have lost my mind.
Sure it's easier to say this
in hindsight, but there is no
chance that I don't have an
inkling of girl that was in a
major car accident, then has
leukemia, and all the while is
the girlfriend of a major star in
Manti Te'o. No way.
I would have been writing
that story when Te'o played
Stanford, like every year. It
would have been a good angle
in 2010, and in 2011 and in 2012.
But the only outlet to report it
apparently was the South Bend
Tribune, which has very conve
niently pulled that story from
its web site. But very clearly in
a story from October 12 did the
Tribune write that "Kekua, who
eventually graduated from
Stanford, was, in fact, doing so
well that she was released from
the hospital on Sept. 10."
The New York Times also

identified her as a "Stanford
graduate" in a story the day
after, so I guess that was my
best chance to call baloney and
I didn't read it. But I also feel
no one else on campus did
either, because I would have
expected any of you to also be
suspicious that this Stanford
grad wouldn't have friends, a
vigil, a million RIP Eacebook
posts, something.
Which is no excuse for the
media's mishandling of the sit
uation. Maybe the Tribune
made that part up or ran with
it with no sources and only a
faint rumor. I don't know, I'd
never willingly go to their site
in my life.
Which is why I accept your
criticism, and I welcome it
because you are right to be
disappointed with us at this
time.
Don't accept ESPN colum
nist Gene Wojciechowski's
lame response that he couldn't
find an obituary for Lennay
Kekua and couldn't find any
records about a car accident
and ignored the obvious red
flags because essentially Te'o
told him to back off.
'And so in that instance,
and at that moment, you sim
ply think that you have to
respect those wishes," said
Wojciechowski. "Short of ask
ing to see a death certificate,
I'm not sure what most people
would do differently in that
case."
We should have done bet
ter, because as any journalist
knows, there are always
secrets on the Internet and it's
always our job to find them.
