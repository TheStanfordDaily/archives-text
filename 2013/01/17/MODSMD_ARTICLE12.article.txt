## OP-ED Understanding the issues behind Searsville Dam 
### JEAN MCCOWN Stanford Director of Community Relations Co-Chair of the Searsville Alternatives Study Steering Committee 
The future of Searsville Dam
and Reservoir, located in
Stanford's Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, is a complex and
challenging topic. Unfortunately,
recent news coverage has included
incorrect information, much of it
attributed to statements by Beyond
Searsville Dam (BSD), an organiza
tion committed to the dam's
removal.
This misinformation requires
clarification in three key areas.
First, Stanford is not violating
the federal Endangered Species
Act or any other state or federal
law in its operation of the Searsville
Dam, which was built in 1892 and
acquired by the university in 1919.
In fact, for the past decade,
Stanford has worked with agencies
like the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service on a 50-year
Habitat Conservation Plan
designed to enhance campus habi
tats for protected species. The San
Francisquito Creek watershed con
tinues to host a healthy steelhead
population, supported by
Stanford's efforts to manage and
enhance the water and fishery
resources.
NMFS has indicated that it is
investigating whether or not the
current operation of Searsville
Dam has led to "take" of steelhead.
"Take" means an action that kills,
harms or harasses a threatened or
endangered species. The Jan. 8
Stanford Daily story quoted BSD
as suggesting that the federal gov
ernment does not open a case
unless investigators are "pretty
confident that they're going to find
something." That is simply not
true.
NMFS has informed Stanford
that its policy is to begin an investi
gation whenever it receives a com
plaint. Stanford will provide NMFS
the information it needs to assess
such a complaint. The university is
confident an investigation will con
firm Stanford's commitment to pro
tecting all covered species and com
plying with all environmental laws.
Second, the university is not
under investigation by any other
agency for lacking regulatory per
mits to operate the dam, despite
assertions made to The Daily to the
contrary. Stanford has sought and
received all appropriate federal and
state permits for work there and in
the San Francisquito Creek water
shed.

Third, Searsville Dam is seismi
cally safe and is regularly inspected
by the Division of Safety of Dams.
That agency reiterated the dam's
condition in a Dec. 28,2012 letter to
BSD and copied to Stanford.
Specifically, the letter says that
"the dam is considered safe for con
tinued use, and no additional engi
neering or geologic analyses involv

ing the dam, abutments or founda
tion are judged necessary at this
time."

A 12-person faculty and staff
Steering Committee began actively
studying the future of Searsville
Dam and Reservoir in June 2011.
Expert consultants specializing in
several areas including engi
neering and hydrology, ecosystems
and biological/fisheries resources
are examining key technical
issues. The ecosystem created by
Searsville Dam now includes signif
icant wetlands acreage upstream of
the dam that host many species of
birds and bats, among others. The
historic trapping of sediment
behind the dam has resulted in a
downstream urban environment
that has relied on that sediment
being trapped. How, for instance,
would removal or modifications to
the dam affect the wetlands? How
would changes in sediment flow in
the creek affect downstream neigh
bors? These are just two examples
of the complex considerations that
must be taken into account.

That's why Stanford has invited
participation in the study by local
community neighbors and relevant
agencies, including the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers,
California Department of Fish and
Wildlife, the California State Water
Resources Control Board and the
San Francisquito Creek Joint
Powers Authority.

Possible alternatives to be eval
uated by the Searsville Steering
Committee are expected to include:
"no action," or letting the reservoir
fill with sediment; dam modifica
tion; dam removal; sediment
removal for reservoir capacity
restoration; alternative water sup
ply and storage strategies; fish pas
sage around the dam; and possible
combinations of these actions.
The future of Searsville Dam
and Reservoir deserves careful
study with a goal of reaching a rec
ommended course of action that
thoughtfully balances all the con
siderations. To rush to judgment
with only one outcome in mind
(removal of the dam) would be irre
sponsible.

When Jane and Leland
Stanford deeded their farm to
Stanford University, they made
clear that administrators were to
responsibly steward the land for
the benefit of generations to come.
Stanford will continue to act
responsibly and deliberately when
it comes to assessing the future of
Searsville Dam.

of the complex considerations that
must be taken into account.

That's why Stanford has invited
participation in the study by local
community neighbors and relevant
agencies, including the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers,
California Department of Fish and
Wildlife, the California State Water
Resources Control Board and the
San Francisquito Creek Joint
Powers Authority.

Possible alternatives to be eval
uated by the Searsville Steering
Committee are expected to include:
"no action," or letting the reservoir
fill with sediment; dam modifica
tion; dam removal; sediment
removal for reservoir capacity
restoration; alternative water sup
ply and storage strategies; fish pas
sage around the dam; and possible
combinations of these actions.
The future of Searsville Dam
and Reservoir deserves careful
study with a goal of reaching a rec
ommended course of action that
thoughtfully balances all the con
siderations. To rush to judgment
with only one outcome in mind
(removal of the dam) would be irre
sponsible.

When Jane and Leland
Stanford deeded their farm to
Stanford University, they made
clear that administrators were to
responsibly steward the land for
the benefit of generations to come.
Stanford will continue to act
responsibly and deliberately when
it comes to assessing the future of
Searsville Dam.
