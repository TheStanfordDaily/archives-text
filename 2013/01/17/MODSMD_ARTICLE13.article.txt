# THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Time to Move On 
### Adam Johnson 
During spring break four years
ago, I was admitted to the
University of California,
Berkeley. I was still waiting to hear
back from a few schools a couple
Ivies and Stanford but I expected
rejection and thus set my sights on
the gold and blue.

I never did go to Cal. I ended up
being admitted to Stanford a week
later, which was my dream school at
the time. I attended Admit Weekend,
had a great time and soon after sent
in my enrollment deposit.
Almost four years later, and here
I am facing down my graduation five
months away. For a while, I consid
ered coterming. Unlike many of my
fellow students, I had no other
attractive plans —no job on Wall
Street or in Silicon Valley awaiting
me. And there were a handful of
coterm programs in fields that I am
passionate about, with none of these
having onerous applications to fill
out.

And yet, the deadline for those
submissions January 15th has
come and gone; I failed to fill out a
single application. Come June, then,
I will be leaving Stanford for good. I
have started to reflect on my years
here. I will miss many things, to be
sure: the diversity of student groups,
the vitality of classes, and the natu
ral beauty that California offers, to
name a few.

There is also much I won't miss. I
will not miss, for instance, Stanford's

perfectly manicured campus. When
our environment is so ordered and
beautiful, is there any room for us
not to be? I will not miss the housing
system I am 21 now, an adult by
most measures, and yet I am all but
forced to enter the same residential
bureaucracy as incoming freshmen.
As a result I have no experience pay
ing bills or managing my own living
space.
Nor will I miss other aspects of
the Stanford administration. The
free speech rights the University
grants me, for instance, are laugh
able. I am forbidden from setting up
my guitar and selling CDs for a few
bucks in White Plaza, the supposed
"free speech zone," but the
University can host career fairs that
span the entire space and likely
result in significant returns on
investment for the participating
companies.
I certainly won't miss the Silicon
Valley ethos, either. I major in engi
neering, but the blind faith that
many of my peers have in the benefi
cial power of technology profoundly
worries me. They attack religion,
only to turn around and worship the
likes of Mark Zuckerberg and
devote themselves to reading the
Book of Jobs (Steve Jobs' bestselling
biography).
Nor will I miss Stanford's activist
community, which as a whole I per
ceive to be too engrained in the echo
chambers of our campus' leftist bent.

Since few here oppose the activist
community, its members come to
believe in the definite truth of their
ideas, which in turn only silences
conversation and debate more. A
shame, for these are the ones who
often care most about pressing soci
etal and global issues.
Finally, I won't miss how our stu
dent body regards normality as sin
and treats friendship as something

to be scheduled in alongside classes,
meetings, and office hours.
And yet, if I were able to advise
my high school senior self, knowing
what I know now, I would suggest he
make the same enrollment decision.
Despite my disillusionment, I am not
suffering here (some are, and we too
often ignore this). Rather, I have
grown tremendously at Stanford,
discovering passions that I never

knew I had. Had I attended a school
with fewer humanities require
ments, for instance, I would likely
not have realized my affinity for sub
jects in those fields. In short,
Stanford has been good for me. It is
merely time for me to move on.
