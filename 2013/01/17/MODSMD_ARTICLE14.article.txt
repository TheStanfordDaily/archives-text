# SITTIN' ON THE JOHN
## Time for a New Conversation 
### John Murray 
The national conversations sur
rounding the Newtown, Conn,
shootings continue, and with
President Obama's recent executive
orders, as well as the NRAs new,
pathetically immature advertisement
regarding the first family's security,
it's conceivable that the tense and col
orful debate over gun control is only
going to continue to hold the spotlight
for the time being. Already, there are
whispers that America may be enter
ing a grand, public debate on guns
and violence, one that, fueled by the
image of twenty dead children, may
manage to avoid crumbling away
under the media's frivolousness sen
sationalism.
I certainly hope so.

We've had so-called "national con
versations" regarding these crises in
the past: most recently, following the
shooting of Trayvon Martin and the
destruction caused by Hurricane
Sandy. Topics of race, violence and
environmental unsustainability made
headlines before eventually giving
way to the next big story. It's not that
we are necessarily an unsympathetic
nation; it is simply a reflection of the
realities of modern media and com
munication, in which priority is given
to what is new and newsworthy. The
media's business cycle isn't built for
sustained discussion of specific
instances and issues.

But I'm hopeful that we are mov
ing away from these ADD-like ten
dencies. Too often have we, as a
nation, suffered through and been
complacent with the standard news
hour procedure where, in response to
event X, we are bombarded with two
opposing opinions that simply state
and restate the standard lines of the
left and right. This trend has only con
tinued following the Newton shooting,
where for weeks now our airwaves
have been filled with the same "ban

assault weapons and high-capacity
clips," "don't ban assault weapons and
high-capacity clips," "improve screen
ing procedures," "they won't do any
thing" one liners. There's merit
behind most of these arguments, but
none of them come anywhere close to
addressing the root of the problem of
American violence. It's another
palette of politically convenient, uno
riginal stances that only take stabs at
the problem at hand, offering small,
reactionary political Band-Aids.
Neither the left nor the right seems to
be fully engaging with the problem.
We are a country that, like most
countries, is facing a tremendous
amount of problems, gun violence
being one of them. We simply can't
allow ourselves to settle for these
overly simplistic debates.

We've resorted too often to "little
fixes," on a variety of levels, local,
national and individual. We look at our
education system and say "more
money, more teachers" without seri
ously considering that perhaps it's
time to re-examine the traditional pil
lars of our children's education. We
are in the depths of an underreported
depression epidemic, to which our pri
mary answer has been to become
more dependent on prescription
drugs, without considering the broad
er complexities of the issue, the rise of
affluence, the corresponding social
isolation and heightened cultural
expectations. A hurricane lays waste
to much of our eastern seaboard, and
rather than address the underlying
environmental issues regarding our
unsustainable existence, our only
answer is to send aid, which, while
certainly needed, is simply temporary,
and will not protect us from future
environmental catastrophes.
On a more individual level, 21st
century technology is changing the
way we interact, offering a new fron

tier for the development of intimate
relationships. Social networking has
rapidly imbedded itself in our daily
lives, subsequently making it more
difficult to deeply connect with each
other. In perhaps the most metaphor
ically perfect example of our quick-fix
mentality, one of the possible "solu
tions" that was offered to avoid a rais
ing-the-debt-ceiling-standoff was a
fiickin' three-trillion dollar coin (an
idea that was only recently
scratched). A single, Band-Aid like
coin meant to temporarily patch up
the monetary bleeding that continues
to come as a result from our
unchecked national spending.
We live in an information age in
which we are constantly being made
aware of the countless problems sur
rounding us, splitting our attention
and forcing us into shallow, rapid-fire
debate. It would be easy to respond to
the Sandy Hook shooting in the man
ner described by the Onion in their
disturbingly accurate "recount" of
America's reaction to the event: "Rick
Everything, Nation Reports: Just
fuck it all to hell." But Newtown
seems like it might be, and hopefully
will be, different: that it will send us
from numbing shock into constructive
conversation. We cannot allow our
selves to fall into the standard bicker
of the past, quoting overly simplistic
bumper stickers and Internet memes.
It's time for us to move outside our
comfort zone of well-rehearsed party
lines and traditional "solutions."
I don't have the answers. No 750-
word column, news report, or radio
interview does. Newtown may have
finally and permanently taught us this
lesson it's time for us to take it to
heart.
