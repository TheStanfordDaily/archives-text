# Vaden plans emergency drop-in flu clinics
## Admins fear 'significant increase' in flu cases 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR 
In response to high demand for flu shots this
season and a fully booked scheduled at the
Vaden Immunization Clinic, Vaden Health
Center has planned three emergency drop-in
clinics for students, faculty and staff.
Vaden held two emergency clinics on
Wednesday, in cooperation with Flu Crew and
the Occupational Health Center, at the Vaden
Health Center and Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons; the third will be held this Friday,
again at Arrillaga dining.
"We're concerned about a possible signifi
cant increase in flu cases on campus," said Vaden
Clinic manager Nancy Masunaga in an emailed
statement to The Daily. "Influenza is a contagious
disease that can lead to serious complications."
Masunaga attributes national coverage of
the influenza A (H3N2) epidemic to the
increased demand for flu shots, which has
resulted in Immunization Clinic appointments
being fully booked until at least next Wednesday.
'Anytime there is news in the media about an
increase in flu activity the demand for flu shots
increases," Masunaga wrote.
The H3N2 influenza strain has already hit 47
states and is moving westwards towards
California. Still, the state's influenza activity
remains local, rather than widespread, accord
ing to the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Surveillance Region 9,
which includes California, is the only U.S.
region currently experience normal, rather
than elevated, numbers of outpatients treated
for influenza-like illness.

According to the CDC, this year's predomi
nant influenza A (H3N2) strain may have led to
increased severity

"Typically 'H3N2 seasons' have been more
severe, with higher numbers of hospitalizations
and deaths," said Joe Bresee, CDC Influenza
Division Chief of Prevention.
Lauren Pischel, first year student at the
Stanford medical school and member of the Flu
Crew Steering Committee said that the Flu
Crew an organization run primarily by
Stanford medical students and undergraduates
that works with Vaden to provide vaccinations
on campus has vaccinated well over 4,500

people on campus since September. This num
ber rose from 2,217 people vaccinated on cam
pus in 2011's flu season and 1,821 people vacci
nated in 2010.
Pischel also points to the H3N2 strain for the
growing need for more vaccinations.
"The H3N2 strain has not been the primary
influenza strain in circulation for a couple of
years now, which is one of the reasons why...
people are getting sick," Pischel said.
Although the vaccine does not guarantee

avoiding flu infection, it can prevent severe
symptoms and help prevent the spread of infec
tion from a healthy person to those who are
immuno-compromised.
After Friday's emergency drop-in clinic,
Vaden will continue to administer the vaccine in
its Immunization and Travel clinics until the end
of June.
