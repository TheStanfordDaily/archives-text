## GSB has largest gender income gap Administrators, students say women often choose to work in lower-paying industries 
### LAN ANH LE 
Women who obtain MB As from the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) earn 79 cents on the dollar compared
to male graduates, the largest earnings gender gap
among elite business schools in the nation, according to
Bloomberg Business Week research published in
December 2012. But representatives and students at the
GSB have doubts about the Bloomberg survey results,

despite their belief that it sheds light on an important
national issue.
Bloomberg Business Week conducted surveys of
recent business school graduates for its biennial rank
ings of full-time master's in business administration
(MBA) programs. The study tracked the gender wage
gap at the top 30 business schools, including The
Wharton School, Harvard Business School and Stanford
GSB.
Stanford's GSB has the largest gap in earnings
between men and women of any of the schools surveyed.
