## GSB has largest gender income gap Administrators, students say women often choose to work in lower-paying industries 
### LAN ANH LE 
Women who obtain MB As from the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) earn 79 cents on the dollar compared
to male graduates, the largest earnings gender gap
among elite business schools in the nation, according to
Bloomberg Business Week research published in
December 2012. But representatives and students at the
GSB have doubts about the Bloomberg survey results,

despite their belief that it sheds light on an important
national issue.
Bloomberg Business Week conducted surveys of
recent business school graduates for its biennial rank
ings of full-time master's in business administration
(MBA) programs. The study tracked the gender wage
gap at the top 30 business schools, including The
Wharton School, Harvard Business School and Stanford
GSB.
Stanford's GSB has the largest gap in earnings
between men and women of any of the schools surveyed.
On average, a female GSB stu
dent from Stanford earns
$32,768 less than her male
classmates, which is a greater
disparity than the overall U.S.
workforce's gender wage gap.
Female to male earnings
stand at 86 percent at Wharton,
103 percent at Southern
Methodist University's Cox
School of Business and 82 per
cent in the overall U.S. work
force, compared to Stanford's
79 percent.
Pulin Sanghvi, director of
the MBA Career Management
Center at the GSB, said the
gender gap is an important
national and global issue that
should receive more attention.
"I think that all of us who
have spent time working in
industry would acknowledge
that there is still significant dis
tance to travel in achieving true
gender equality in the work
place," Sanghvi said.
Still, some at the GSB claim
that the reason for disparity
has less to do with gender dis
crimination than it does with
career choices.
"The primary cause of the
salary gap is the differences in
choice of industry" said Carly
Janson, senior associate direc
tor of the Career Management
Center.
Universum's 2011 annual
survey of choices in places to
work shows that women prefer
to work at companies such as
Google, Johnson & Johnson
and Disney, where compensa
tion is generally lower than at
investment banks such as
Goldman Sachs or Morgan
Stanley. Along the same line,
the 2012 Employment Report
shows that GSB women are

more highly represented in
sectors that pay employees
less.

"Female students have a
higher representation in indus
tries such as consumer prod
ucts, media and internet tech
nology— industries with rela
tively lower compensation
over high-compensation fields
like investment banking,"
Janson said.
In addition to this dimen
sion, Sangvhi pointed out that
in the technology sector, equity
and stock options are major
components of compensation,
which can skew the wage com
parison.
Maile Lesica M.B.A. 'l3
and Shalie Gaskill M.B.A. 'l3
are both female students at the
GSB who work for non-finance
companies. Lesica works for
Shopbop, a women's apparel
and accessories retailer, while
Gaskill works for Box, a cloud
management company.
"Even though retail might
not pay as much as other indus
tries like banking, I would nev
er pick a profession that I like
less," Lesica said. "You don't
choose your career based on
wage."
"Stanford does a good job
at helping you figuring out
what you are passionate
about," added Gaskil. "I would
have actually hated it if the
school had pressured women
into taking higher-paying jobs."
Both women feel that the
apparent wage gap is due
much more to different inter
ests in industry than to negli

gence on GSB's part.
"It's not like Stanford has
failed at helping its female stu
dents find high-paying jobs. I
have girlfriends who are rock
ing it in finance light now. I
just happen to want to work in
tech," Gaskill said.
Stanford's class size is also
significantly smaller than peer
schools'.
"The GSB class is half the
size of the class at peer
schools, which makes our
numbers more sensitive and
causes an amplification of the
wage gap," Janson said.
Despite a larger wage gap,
both GSB female and male
students earn the highest
salaries compared to peer
schools. GSB women earn
$121,945 while GSB men earn
$154,713, compared to $115,651
(female) and $129,219 (male) at
Harvard or $115,713 (female)
and $135,021 (male) at Wharton.
"Would these statistics
have made me choose another
school over Stanford? No way.
Despite the apparent bigger
gap, overall our students earn
more," Gaskill said.
But both Sangvhi and
Janson note that income and
monetary achievements are
only a part of gender empow
erment.
"The biggest factor that I
pay attention to is whether our
students feel they are able to
achieve their first choice jobs,"
he said.

Despite a larger wage gap,
both GSB female and male
students earn the highest
salaries compared to peer
schools. GSB women earn
$121,945 while GSB men earn
$154,713, compared to $115,651

Harvard or $115,713 (female)
and $135,021 (male) at Wharton.
"Would these statistics
have made me choose another

more," Gaskill said.
But both Sangvhi and
Janson note that income and

only a part of gender empow

"The primary cause of the salary
gap is the differences in choice of
industry"

Career Management Center
Women who obtain MB As from the Graduate School
of Business (GSB) earn 79 cents on the dollar compared
to male graduates, the largest earnings gender gap
among elite business schools in the nation, according to
Bloomberg Business Week research published in
December 2012. But representatives and students at the
GSB have doubts about the Bloomberg survey results,

despite their belief that it sheds light on an important
national issue.
Bloomberg Business Week conducted surveys of
recent business school graduates for its biennial rank
ings of full-time master's in business administration
(MBA) programs. The study tracked the gender wage
gap at the top 30 business schools, including The
Wharton School, Harvard Business School and Stanford
GSB.
Stanford's GSB has the largest gap in earnings
between men and women of any of the schools surveyed.
On average, a female GSB stu
dent from Stanford earns
$32,768 less than her male
classmates, which is a greater
disparity than the overall U.S.
workforce's gender wage gap.
Female to male earnings
stand at 86 percent at Wharton,
103 percent at Southern
Methodist University's Cox
School of Business and 82 per
cent in the overall U.S. work
force, compared to Stanford's
79 percent.
Pulin Sanghvi, director of
the MBA Career Management
Center at the GSB, said the
gender gap is an important
national and global issue that
should receive more attention.
"I think that all of us who
have spent time working in
industry would acknowledge
that there is still significant dis
tance to travel in achieving true
gender equality in the work
place," Sanghvi said.
Still, some at the GSB claim
that the reason for disparity
has less to do with gender dis
crimination than it does with
career choices.
"The primary cause of the
salary gap is the differences in
choice of industry" said Carly
Janson, senior associate direc
tor of the Career Management
Center.
Universum's 2011 annual
survey of choices in places to
work shows that women prefer
to work at companies such as
Google, Johnson & Johnson
and Disney, where compensa
tion is generally lower than at
investment banks such as
Goldman Sachs or Morgan
Stanley. Along the same line,
the 2012 Employment Report
shows that GSB women are

more highly represented in
sectors that pay employees
less.

"Female students have a
higher representation in indus
tries such as consumer prod
ucts, media and internet tech
nology— industries with rela
tively lower compensation
over high-compensation fields
like investment banking,"
Janson said.
In addition to this dimen
sion, Sangvhi pointed out that
in the technology sector, equity
and stock options are major
components of compensation,
which can skew the wage com
parison.
Maile Lesica M.B.A. 'l3
and Shalie Gaskill M.B.A. 'l3
are both female students at the
GSB who work for non-finance
companies. Lesica works for
Shopbop, a women's apparel
and accessories retailer, while
Gaskill works for Box, a cloud
management company.
"Even though retail might
not pay as much as other indus
tries like banking, I would nev
er pick a profession that I like
less," Lesica said. "You don't
choose your career based on
wage."
"Stanford does a good job
at helping you figuring out
what you are passionate
about," added Gaskil. "I would
have actually hated it if the
school had pressured women
into taking higher-paying jobs."
Both women feel that the
apparent wage gap is due
much more to different inter
ests in industry than to negli

gence on GSB's part.
"It's not like Stanford has
failed at helping its female stu
dents find high-paying jobs. I
have girlfriends who are rock
ing it in finance light now. I
just happen to want to work in
tech," Gaskill said.
Stanford's class size is also
significantly smaller than peer
schools'.
"The GSB class is half the
size of the class at peer
schools, which makes our
numbers more sensitive and
causes an amplification of the
wage gap," Janson said.
Despite a larger wage gap,
both GSB female and male
students earn the highest
salaries compared to peer
schools. GSB women earn
$121,945 while GSB men earn
$154,713, compared to $115,651
(female) and $129,219 (male) at
Harvard or $115,713 (female)
and $135,021 (male) at Wharton.
"Would these statistics
have made me choose another
school over Stanford? No way.
Despite the apparent bigger
gap, overall our students earn
more," Gaskill said.
But both Sangvhi and
Janson note that income and
monetary achievements are
only a part of gender empow
erment.
"The biggest factor that I
pay attention to is whether our
students feel they are able to
achieve their first choice jobs,"
he said.
