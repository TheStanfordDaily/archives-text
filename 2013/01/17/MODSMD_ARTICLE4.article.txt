# UNREAL
## NOTRE DAME STAR "VICTIM" OF HOAX 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The jig is up.
Manti Te'o, the All-American
linebacker and Heisman runner-up
for Notre Dame, garnered off-the
field attention this season after the

deaths of his girlfriend, allegedly a
Stanford graduate named Lennay
Kekua, to cancer and his grand
mother, Annette Santiago. It was
reported the deaths had been six
hours apart.
Deadspin revealed yesterday
that Lennay Kekua was fabricated,
and Notre Dame athletic director
Jack Swarbrick held a press confer
ence Wednesday night to address
the story, which the school claims
was an elaborate hoax.

"On the morning of December
26th, very early morning, Manti
called his coaches to inform them
that, while he was in attendance at
the ESPN awards show in Orlando,
he received a phone call from a num
ber he recognized as having been
that he associated with Lennay
Kekua," Swarbrick said. "When he
answered it, it was a person whose
voice sounded like the same voice he

Championship game against Alabama at Sun Life Stadium on Monday, January 7,2013.
had talked to, who told him
that she was, in fact, not
dead."
Swarbrick also went on to
say that the relationship
between Te'o and Kekua was
"exclusively an online rela
tionship."
This past fall, Sports
Illustrated, The New York
Times and other news outlets
told the story of Te'o going on
to lead the Fighting Irish in
an emotional 20-3 upset of
Michigan State after hearing
news of the deaths. In nearly
every version, quotes from
Te'o, his family and friends
all gave nothing to suggest
that Kekua and Te'o's rela
tionship was anything but
real.
According to a report in
the South Bend Tribune, the
young couple's fairytale meet
ing supposedly came after
Kekua—who was supposed
to have graduated in 2012
met Te'o after a football game
at the Farm in 2009.
But the Stanford regis
trar's office and University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin say
that there is no record that a
Lennay Kekua ever enrolled.
And while Teo's grand
mother, Annette Santiago, did
die on Sept. 11, 2012, at the
age of 72, according to Social

Security Administration (SSA)
records, there is no SSA
record there of the death of
Lennay Kekua, that day or
any other.
In fact, the photographs
identified as Kekua in
online tributes and on TV
news reports are pictures
from the social-media accounts
of a 22-year-old California
woman who is not named
Lennay Kekua.
According to Swarbrick,
after Te'o came forward with
his suspicions, Swarbrick
arranged a meeting for Dec.
27, and said Te'o shared with
him the details of the relation
ship. Notre Dame then hired
an outside firm to investigate
the case, receiving a final
report with the investiga
tion's findings on Jan. 4.
"Our investigators through
their work were able to dis
cover online chatter among
the perpetrators that is sort of
the ultimate proof of this, the
joy they were taking, the sort
of casualness with which
among themselves they were
referring to what they had
accomplished and what they
had done," Swarbrick said.
Swarbrick also talked
about the detail that those
"perpetrators" went to in the
hoax, saying there was even
an address given to send flow
ers after Kekua's manufac
tured death. Swarbrick also
says there were "several
meetings" set up between
Te'o and Kekua, including in

the state of Hawaii, but Kekua
never showed up.
Swarbrick was also very
clear that the emotions and
feelings that Te'o shared pub
licly about Kekua were all
real.
"Every single thing about
this was real to Manti," said
Swarbrick. "There was no
suspicion. The grief was real,
the affection was real, and
that's the sad nature of this
cruel game."
Swarbrick said he was
under the impression Te'o
would address the situation
Thursday.
Here is the only statement
Te'o has thus far released:
Statement from Te'o:"This
is incredibly embarrassing to
talk about, but over an
extended period of time, I
developed an emotional rela
tionship with a woman I met
online. We maintained what I
thought to be an authentic
relationship by communicat
ing frequently online and on
the phone, and I grew to care
deeply about her.
To realize that I was the
victim of what was apparently
someone's sick joke and con
stant lies was, and is, painful
and humiliating. It further
pains me that the grief I felt
and the sympathies expressed
to me at the time of my grand
mother's death in September
were in any way deepened by
what I believed to be another
significant loss in my life.
I am enormously grateful
for the support of my family,
Mends and Notre Dame fans
throughout this year. To think
that I shared with them my
happiness about my relation
ship and details that I thought
to be true about her just
makes me sick. I hope that
people can understand how
trying and confusing this
whole experience has been. In
retrospect, I obviously should
have been much more cau
tious. If anything good comes
of this, I hope it is that others
will be far more guarded
when they engage with people
online than I was.
Fortunately, I have many
wonderful things in my life,
and I'm looking forward to
putting this painful experi
ence behind me as I focus on
preparing for the NFL
Draft."

Manti Te'o, the All-American
linebacker and Heisman runner-up
for Notre Dame, garnered off-the
field attention this season after the

deaths of his girlfriend, allegedly a
Stanford graduate named Lennay
Kekua, to cancer and his grand
mother, Annette Santiago. It was
reported the deaths had been six
hours apart.
Deadspin revealed yesterday
that Lennay Kekua was fabricated,
and Notre Dame athletic director
Jack Swarbrick held a press confer
ence Wednesday night to address
the story, which the school claims
was an elaborate hoax.

"On the morning of December
26th, very early morning, Manti
called his coaches to inform them
that, while he was in attendance at
the ESPN awards show in Orlando,
he received a phone call from a num
ber he recognized as having been
that he associated with Lennay
Kekua," Swarbrick said. "When he
answered it, it was a person whose
voice sounded like the same voice he

Championship game against Alabama at Sun Life Stadium on Monday, January 7,2013.
had talked to, who told him
that she was, in fact, not
dead."
Swarbrick also went on to
say that the relationship
between Te'o and Kekua was
"exclusively an online rela
tionship."
This past fall, Sports
Illustrated, The New York
Times and other news outlets
told the story of Te'o going on
to lead the Fighting Irish in
an emotional 20-3 upset of
Michigan State after hearing
news of the deaths. In nearly
every version, quotes from
Te'o, his family and friends
all gave nothing to suggest
that Kekua and Te'o's rela
tionship was anything but
real.
According to a report in
the South Bend Tribune, the
young couple's fairytale meet
ing supposedly came after
Kekua—who was supposed
to have graduated in 2012
met Te'o after a football game
at the Farm in 2009.
But the Stanford regis
trar's office and University
spokesperson Lisa Lapin say
that there is no record that a
Lennay Kekua ever enrolled.
And while Teo's grand
mother, Annette Santiago, did
die on Sept. 11, 2012, at the
age of 72, according to Social

Security Administration (SSA)
records, there is no SSA
record there of the death of
Lennay Kekua, that day or
any other.
In fact, the photographs
identified as Kekua in
online tributes and on TV
news reports are pictures
from the social-media accounts
of a 22-year-old California
woman who is not named
Lennay Kekua.
According to Swarbrick,
after Te'o came forward with
his suspicions, Swarbrick
arranged a meeting for Dec.
27, and said Te'o shared with
him the details of the relation
ship. Notre Dame then hired
an outside firm to investigate
the case, receiving a final
report with the investiga
tion's findings on Jan. 4.
"Our investigators through
their work were able to dis
cover online chatter among
the perpetrators that is sort of
the ultimate proof of this, the
joy they were taking, the sort
of casualness with which
among themselves they were
referring to what they had
accomplished and what they
had done," Swarbrick said.
Swarbrick also talked
about the detail that those
"perpetrators" went to in the
hoax, saying there was even
an address given to send flow
ers after Kekua's manufac
tured death. Swarbrick also
says there were "several
meetings" set up between
Te'o and Kekua, including in

the state of Hawaii, but Kekua
never showed up.
Swarbrick was also very
clear that the emotions and
feelings that Te'o shared pub
licly about Kekua were all
real.
"Every single thing about
this was real to Manti," said
Swarbrick. "There was no
suspicion. The grief was real,
the affection was real, and
that's the sad nature of this
cruel game."
Swarbrick said he was
under the impression Te'o
would address the situation
Thursday.
Here is the only statement
Te'o has thus far released:
Statement from Te'o:"This
is incredibly embarrassing to
talk about, but over an
extended period of time, I
developed an emotional rela
tionship with a woman I met
online. We maintained what I
thought to be an authentic
relationship by communicat
ing frequently online and on
the phone, and I grew to care
deeply about her.
To realize that I was the
victim of what was apparently
someone's sick joke and con
stant lies was, and is, painful
and humiliating. It further
pains me that the grief I felt
and the sympathies expressed
to me at the time of my grand
mother's death in September
were in any way deepened by
what I believed to be another
significant loss in my life.
I am enormously grateful
for the support of my family,
Mends and Notre Dame fans
throughout this year. To think
that I shared with them my
happiness about my relation
ship and details that I thought
to be true about her just
makes me sick. I hope that
people can understand how
trying and confusing this
whole experience has been. In
retrospect, I obviously should
have been much more cau
tious. If anything good comes
of this, I hope it is that others
will be far more guarded
when they engage with people
online than I was.
Fortunately, I have many
wonderful things in my life,
and I'm looking forward to
putting this painful experi
ence behind me as I focus on
preparing for the NFL
Draft."
