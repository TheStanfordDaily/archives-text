## New institute funds journalism tech projects "Magic Grant" distributes $300,000 to three teams 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
A year after Stanford's School of
Engineering and Columbia's
Graduate School of Journalism first
announced the creation of a new
media institute, its first class of
"Magic Grant" recipients are work
ing on projects focused on integrat
ing technology with journalism.
Established last year after a $3O
million gift from the late
Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Helen
Gurley Brown, the Brown Institute
for Media Innovation plans to use
approximately $300,000 each year to
fund Magic Grants. These are
awarded to teams of graduate or
postgraduate students from
Stanford and Columbia whose proj
ects have "the potential change the
ways in which media are produced,
delivered, presented or consumed,"
according to the institute's website.
Three projects are currently
underway, including the creation a
personalized news television,
dynamic maps of the news and a
mobile publishing protocol for con
flict reporting.
Each team has received about

$lOO,OOO, according to Kelly Yilmaz,
the program manager at Stanford.
"The charge of the institute is to
co-evolve technology and story
telling," said Columbia Journalism
Professor Mark Hansen, the insti
tute's east coast director. "So the
more we get Stanford engineering
mingling with Columbia journalism,
the better we are."
Eigen News
The team that created Eigen
News used the technological skills of
Stanford students and the journalis
tic know-how of Columbia to create
a prototype of a personalized news
television.
"When we heard about the
Magic Grant, we thought it would be
really cool if we could do for news
videos what Google News does for
text news," said David Chen, a fifth
year doctoral student in electrical
engineering.
Google News aggregates head
lines from news sources, and then
displays them according to a user's
interests. Similarly, after analyzing
sixteen news channels, slicing them
into individual stories and grouping
these stories together by topic and
relations, Eigen News provides
viewers with a personalized playlist

One of the three Magic Grant recipients this year is working on a project
called Eigen News, a propotype that will allow for a personalized
news television similar to the way Google News aggregates headlines.
of the stories they might be
interested in.
"This basically allows
user interaction instead of
the conventional sitting at
home watching the news pas
sively," said one of Chen's
teammates, Huizhong Chen,
a fourth year electrical engi
neering doctoral student.
Currently Eigen News
exists as a website open for
the Stanford and Columbia
community. For Stanford stu
dents, a stanford.edu email
address is required to regis
ter for an account.

"Suppose you want to
understand some complex
topic like a research topic
or some complex area like the
presidential campaign or the
debt crisis in Europe. You
could go to a search engine,
but search engines are really
great for retrieving those
nuggets of knowledge," said
Dafna Shahaf, a computer
science post-doctoral stu
dent. "They're not so good
for the big picture."
Her solution was to create
a program that would lie out
the narrative threads of news
topics as metro maps.
She used the story of
Leßron James' switch from
the Cleveland Cavaliers to
the Miami Heat as an exam
ple. The visualization for this
story would consist of a
metro line for the Cleveland
Cavaliers, a metro line for the
Miami Heat and then a metro
line for James, which would

first run tangential to the
Cleveland Cavaliers and then
run tangential to the Miami
Heat.
Shahaf has been working
on this idea since 2009, and
created what she calls a
"clunky prototype" for her
doctoral degree. She said the
money from the grant has
definitely helped things move
along faster, and allowed her
to pay research assistants
two to work on the algorith
mic part and one to work on
the human-computer inter
action and user interface
end.
"To make it pretty" she
explained. "It's way more
important than I ever thought."
Shahaf hopes to have a
functioning website by the
end of the year.
"For me, other than mon
ey, the best part about it is
connections to journalists,"
said Shahaf, whose project is
the only one that does not have
a bicoastal team. She said,
however, that she Skypes
with colleagues at Columbia
about once or twice a month.
Dispatch
The third project is
focused on creating a mobile
app that allows "citizen jour
nalists to exchange informa
tion and publish securely and

anonymously," according to
the Brown Institute's Fall
2012 Review.
The team consists of
Stanford computer science doc
toral students and Columbia
journalism students.
The Institute
Columbia received $6 mil
lion to pay for the creation of
a high-tech newsroom and
was presented with architec
tural designs in August.
"The architects took
inspiration not just from
newsrooms but also incuba
tor spaces, startup spaces,
tech research and develop
ment spaces spaces where
you have this open plan,"
Hansen said. "They were
using this term 'high-tech
newsroom' but really it's this
collaboration space where fel
lows and other people affiliat
ed with the institute will be
able to find time to come and
work."
The space is somewhere
between a startup and an
interesting newsroom, he
said.
Yilmaz said a Brown
Institute-designated space
currently does not exist on
the Stanford campus.
In order to maintain the
bicoastal characteristic of the
institute, quarterly review

sessions will be held. According
to Hansen, the next one will
be in March at Columbia.
The institute is also look
ing to have a "bicoastal brain
storm" at the end of February
involving journalism and
engineering students and fac
ulty, as well as journalism cul
tural institutions.
"We want to bring every
one together to riff on what
are the interesting new ques
tions and what we could be
finding," Hansen said.
Hansen's long term vision
for the Institute is for it to
become a "vibrant, connect
ed, genuinely bicoastal, a
genuine hybrid that's con
nected with journalistic and
engineering industries."
"[The Brown Institute] is
an excellent opportunity, as
demonstrated in this proj
ect, to show how technology
can be used to reinvent jour
nalism," Chen said. "We
hear a lot of stories about
how newspapers are strug
gling with the conventional
way of distributing informa
tion but technology could
really propel them and
transform how the journal
ism industry becomes in the
next decade."

first run tangential to the
Cleveland Cavaliers and then
run tangential to the Miami
Heat.
Shahaf has been working
on this idea since 2009, and
created what she calls a
"clunky prototype" for her
doctoral degree. She said the
money from the grant has
definitely helped things move
along faster, and allowed her
to pay research assistants
two to work on the algorith
mic part and one to work on
the human-computer inter
action and user interface
end.
"To make it pretty" she
explained. "It's way more
important than I ever thought."
Shahaf hopes to have a
functioning website by the
end of the year.
"For me, other than mon
ey, the best part about it is
connections to journalists,"
said Shahaf, whose project is
the only one that does not have
a bicoastal team. She said,
however, that she Skypes
with colleagues at Columbia
about once or twice a month.

The third project is
focused on creating a mobile
app that allows "citizen jour
nalists to exchange informa
tion and publish securely and

anonymously," according to
the Brown Institute's Fall
2012 Review.
The team consists of
Stanford computer science doc
toral students and Columbia
journalism students.
The Institute
Columbia received $6 mil
lion to pay for the creation of
a high-tech newsroom and
was presented with architec
tural designs in August.
"The architects took
inspiration not just from
newsrooms but also incuba
tor spaces, startup spaces,
tech research and develop
ment spaces spaces where
you have this open plan,"
Hansen said. "They were
using this term 'high-tech
newsroom' but really it's this
collaboration space where fel
lows and other people affiliat
ed with the institute will be
able to find time to come and
work."
The space is somewhere
between a startup and an
interesting newsroom, he
said.
Yilmaz said a Brown
Institute-designated space
currently does not exist on
the Stanford campus.
In order to maintain the
bicoastal characteristic of the
institute, quarterly review

sessions will be held. According
to Hansen, the next one will
be in March at Columbia.
The institute is also look
ing to have a "bicoastal brain
storm" at the end of February
involving journalism and
engineering students and fac
ulty, as well as journalism cul
tural institutions.
"We want to bring every
one together to riff on what
are the interesting new ques
tions and what we could be
finding," Hansen said.
Hansen's long term vision
for the Institute is for it to
become a "vibrant, connect
ed, genuinely bicoastal, a
genuine hybrid that's con
nected with journalistic and
engineering industries."
"[The Brown Institute] is
an excellent opportunity, as
demonstrated in this proj
ect, to show how technology
can be used to reinvent jour
nalism," Chen said. "We
hear a lot of stories about
how newspapers are strug
gling with the conventional
way of distributing informa
tion but technology could
really propel them and
transform how the journal
ism industry becomes in the
next decade."

Another "Magic Grant" team is looking to create a program that will show the narrative
threads of news stories, such as LeBron James' switch to the Miami Heat, as metro maps.
A year after Stanford's School of
Engineering and Columbia's
Graduate School of Journalism first
announced the creation of a new
media institute, its first class of
"Magic Grant" recipients are work
ing on projects focused on integrat
ing technology with journalism.
Established last year after a $3O
million gift from the late
Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Helen
Gurley Brown, the Brown Institute
for Media Innovation plans to use
approximately $300,000 each year to
fund Magic Grants. These are
awarded to teams of graduate or
postgraduate students from
Stanford and Columbia whose proj
ects have "the potential change the
ways in which media are produced,
delivered, presented or consumed,"
according to the institute's website.
Three projects are currently
underway, including the creation a
personalized news television,
dynamic maps of the news and a
mobile publishing protocol for con
flict reporting.
Each team has received about

$lOO,OOO, according to Kelly Yilmaz,
the program manager at Stanford.
"The charge of the institute is to
co-evolve technology and story
telling," said Columbia Journalism
Professor Mark Hansen, the insti
tute's east coast director. "So the
more we get Stanford engineering
mingling with Columbia journalism,
the better we are."
Eigen News
The team that created Eigen
News used the technological skills of
Stanford students and the journalis
tic know-how of Columbia to create
a prototype of a personalized news
television.
"When we heard about the
Magic Grant, we thought it would be
really cool if we could do for news
videos what Google News does for
text news," said David Chen, a fifth
year doctoral student in electrical
engineering.
Google News aggregates head
lines from news sources, and then
displays them according to a user's
interests. Similarly, after analyzing
sixteen news channels, slicing them
into individual stories and grouping
these stories together by topic and
relations, Eigen News provides
viewers with a personalized playlist

One of the three Magic Grant recipients this year is working on a project

news television similar to the way Google News aggregates headlines.
of the stories they might be
interested in.
"This basically allows
user interaction instead of
the conventional sitting at
home watching the news pas
sively," said one of Chen's
teammates, Huizhong Chen,
a fourth year electrical engi
neering doctoral student.
Currently Eigen News
exists as a website open for
the Stanford and Columbia
community. For Stanford stu
dents, a stanford.edu email
address is required to regis
ter for an account.

"Suppose you want to
understand some complex
topic like a research topic
or some complex area like the
presidential campaign or the
debt crisis in Europe. You
could go to a search engine,
but search engines are really
great for retrieving those
nuggets of knowledge," said
Dafna Shahaf, a computer
science post-doctoral stu
dent. "They're not so good
for the big picture."
Her solution was to create
a program that would lie out
the narrative threads of news
topics as metro maps.
She used the story of
Leßron James' switch from
the Cleveland Cavaliers to
the Miami Heat as an exam
ple. The visualization for this
story would consist of a
metro line for the Cleveland
Cavaliers, a metro line for the
Miami Heat and then a metro
line for James, which would

first run tangential to the
Cleveland Cavaliers and then
run tangential to the Miami
Heat.
