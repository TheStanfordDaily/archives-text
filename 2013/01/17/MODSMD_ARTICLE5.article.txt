## New institute funds journalism tech projects "Magic Grant" distributes $300,000 to three teams 
### LINDSEY TXAKEEYANG 
A year after Stanford's School of
Engineering and Columbia's
Graduate School of Journalism first
announced the creation of a new
media institute, its first class of
"Magic Grant" recipients are work
ing on projects focused on integrat
ing technology with journalism.
Established last year after a $3O
million gift from the late
Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Helen
Gurley Brown, the Brown Institute
for Media Innovation plans to use
approximately $300,000 each year to
fund Magic Grants. These are
awarded to teams of graduate or
postgraduate students from
Stanford and Columbia whose proj
ects have "the potential change the
ways in which media are produced,
delivered, presented or consumed,"
according to the institute's website.
Three projects are currently
underway, including the creation a
personalized news television,
dynamic maps of the news and a
mobile publishing protocol for con
flict reporting.
Each team has received about

$lOO,OOO, according to Kelly Yilmaz,
the program manager at Stanford.
"The charge of the institute is to
co-evolve technology and story
telling," said Columbia Journalism
Professor Mark Hansen, the insti
tute's east coast director. "So the
more we get Stanford engineering
mingling with Columbia journalism,
the better we are."
Eigen News
The team that created Eigen
News used the technological skills of
Stanford students and the journalis
tic know-how of Columbia to create
a prototype of a personalized news
television.
"When we heard about the
Magic Grant, we thought it would be
really cool if we could do for news
videos what Google News does for
text news," said David Chen, a fifth
year doctoral student in electrical
engineering.
Google News aggregates head
lines from news sources, and then
displays them according to a user's
interests. Similarly, after analyzing
sixteen news channels, slicing them
into individual stories and grouping
these stories together by topic and
relations, Eigen News provides
viewers with a personalized playlist

One of the three Magic Grant recipients this year is working on a project
called Eigen News, a propotype that will allow for a personalized
news television similar to the way Google News aggregates headlines.
