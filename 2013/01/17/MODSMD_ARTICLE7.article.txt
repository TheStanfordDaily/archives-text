"I knew exactly what to
expect there physically... but
nothing can prepare you psy

out spontaneity, a world of
complete order and conformi
ty," Johnson said about his
trip to North Korea.
"You really feel people
weigh everything they say
ahead of time for all possible
consequences," he added.
"You got the sense of the way
the people you've interacted
[with] have digested censor
ship to the degree that they
are their own censors."
