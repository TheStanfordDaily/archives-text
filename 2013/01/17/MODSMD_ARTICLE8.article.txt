## Give hockey, the fastest sport, a shot 
### Joseph Beyda 
What has two legs
and skates faster
than your average
late-night
Caltrain?
Not an NFL player.
What has 32 teeth and isn't afraid
to lose a few of them?
Not an NBA pro.
What runs at above 100 beats per
minute for the most intense two-and
a-half hours in professional sports?
Most definitely not an MLB star.
By my count I've written about
hockey on five occasions in the last 14
months, which makes for at least half
of The Daily's coverage of the game
over that time. More often than not,
my message has been simple: Give
hockey, a sport so oft-overlooked in
the American market, a try.
I don't think I've been convincing
enough to this point. There's an inter
esting little sneer that people give
when you tell them you follow the
NHL, not the NBA, and believe me
when I tell you those haven't been
getting any less frequent in the wake
of this year's lockout.
But these three months have giv
en me a little extra time to hone my
message, and I'm about to give it my
best shot as we get ready to start a
shortened NHL season this
Saturday. That's because I've heard
enough whining about the other three
major American sports that I've
grown to understand why hockey fills
the void perfectly.
It's faster than football. It's more
physical than basketball. It's less bor
ing than baseball.
I'll admit that the NFL has gotten
pretty fast nowadays, with track
stars like RGIII and Colin
Kaepernick running college-style
offenses in the pros and Chip Kelly
about to take his speedy system to
the league. But ice, which is what
makes hockey unique in the first
place, will always be quicker than
grass. Usain Bolt approaches 25
miles per hour sprinting on a
straightaway; the world's fastest
speed-skaters approach 40 miles per
hour sprinting on a round track.
And, of course, a hockey rink is
much smaller than a football field.
That makes for a much more
exciting game with more frequent
momentum changes. A pick-six is
easily the most devastating play in
football, when a team goes from an
opportunity to score to being
scored against in a heartbeat. The
hockey equivalent is an odd-man
rush, when one team's attackers
outnumber the defenders between
them and the goalie. By simple sub
traction, that means the team now
playing defense had the body-count
advantage on offense just a few sec
onds ago; anything from a bad
bounce off the boards to a slip by
the puck handler flipped the switch
and put one team at a disadvan
tage.
In 264 NFL games this year,
there were 71 pick-sixes thrown —
about one every four games and a
new league record. By contrast, a
single hockey game can easily have
10 or more odd-man rushes
between the two teams.
The comparison isn't perfect; a
pick-six is a guaranteed score, and
an odd-man rush is not. But odd
man rushes account for so many of
the goals scored in the NHL that
those instantaneous momentum
swings have the same, gut-wrench
ing implications if you're in the
stands.
Plus, the average hockey game
is an hour shorter than its football
counterpart. And if you've never
heard complaints about the length
of a football game, you've never sat
in the Red Zone.
This is no news to the skeptical
basketball fans in the crowd. Fast
breaks are even more common in
the NBA than odd-man rushes are
in the NHL, the game moves from
end to end just as often and, no,
basketball games don't take very
long either.
Even with their common speed,
there's something fundamentally
different between the two sports:
basketball is high-scoring, hockey
is low-scoring. That means that an
NHL player has to scratch and
claw a lot harder for a goal than an
NBA player has to for a basket, and
the physicality of hockey follows
naturally.
A lot of people are put off by
hockey's perceived violence, but
when those of us familiar with the
sport praise its physicality, we
aren't talking fistfights. The puck
handler can be leveled by an oppo
nent at all times, so he has to sacri
fice for every foot he skates
towards the goal. Defenders aren't
allowed to do that in basket
ball they're actually
encouraged to let the drib
bler run over them, resulting
in an epidemic of flopping.
Seriously, if you think the
most physical play in sports
should be one guy standing
still while another guy tips
him over like a bowling pin
on sleeping pills, basketball
is for you.
I'm not saying that
strength isn't an asset in the
NBA; you've still got to mus
cle your way to the basket
every now and then. But
going up against Chris
Pronger is just a wee bit
more dangerous than going
up against Shaq. (And if
you're not reading this
online, I advise you look up
Chris Pronger.)

As for America's pastime,
baseball? I do think there's a
lot more to the sport than a
lot of its detractors realize.
Even in such a slow-paced
game there's still tension,
and more than in any other
sport it's built on the fans'
intimate understanding of
the different situations and
players out on that field.
But today's fan isn't
always built on that depth of
knowledge. Thanks to
ESPN and other mega-net
works, sports have their own
24-hour news cycle and are
more accessible than ever.
When both sports freaks and
bandwagoners are as likely
to catch a Yankees game as a
Giants game, baseball's per
sonal side doesn't carry the
same weight and the game
loses the sentimentality that
makes it so interesting to the
devoted, monogamous fan.
Hockey is, by compari
son, faceless and how
could it not be, when the

players move quickly, wear
faceguards and are on the ice
no more than a third of the
time? Until the late-season
and playoff intrigue rolls
in, an Oilers game is just
as exciting for me as a
Sharks game. And an NHL
game grabs your attention
quicker than any other in
sports; how could you
change the channel when a
team is on the power play
Whichever marketing guru
invented the term, which
shouts, "If someone's going
to score it's going to be in
the next two minutes!"
deserves a raise. (We can all
agree that "runners at the
corners" doesn't have the
same zing.)
More than anything else,
there's just no standing
around in the outfield in
hockey. Even the guys on the
bench have to do a tango,
ducking away from pucks as
they wait to hurdle the
boards in the quickest sub

stitution in sports.
The MLB's pace of play
just can't compare. In base
ball you're lucky if you see
two pitches in a minute, but
in hockey that's long enough
for every skater on the ice to
exhaust themselves.
And now that I've
exhausted myself just to
convince you to watch the
greatest sport on Earth,
would it be that tough to
give it a try? Let me remind
you why, one last time:
Hockey is faster than
football. It's more physical
than basketball. It's less bor
ing than baseball.
No offense.

give it a try? Let me remind
you why, one last time:
Hockey is faster than
football. It's more physical
than basketball. It's less bor
ing than baseball.
No offense.

What has two legs
and skates faster
than your average
late-night
Caltrain?
Not an NFL player.
What has 32 teeth and isn't afraid
to lose a few of them?
Not an NBA pro.
What runs at above 100 beats per
minute for the most intense two-and
a-half hours in professional sports?
Most definitely not an MLB star.
By my count I've written about
hockey on five occasions in the last 14
months, which makes for at least half
of The Daily's coverage of the game
over that time. More often than not,
my message has been simple: Give
hockey, a sport so oft-overlooked in
the American market, a try.
I don't think I've been convincing
enough to this point. There's an inter
esting little sneer that people give
when you tell them you follow the
NHL, not the NBA, and believe me
when I tell you those haven't been
getting any less frequent in the wake
of this year's lockout.
But these three months have giv
en me a little extra time to hone my
message, and I'm about to give it my
best shot as we get ready to start a
shortened NHL season this
Saturday. That's because I've heard
enough whining about the other three
major American sports that I've
grown to understand why hockey fills
the void perfectly.
It's faster than football. It's more
physical than basketball. It's less bor
ing than baseball.
I'll admit that the NFL has gotten
pretty fast nowadays, with track
stars like RGIII and Colin
Kaepernick running college-style
offenses in the pros and Chip Kelly
about to take his speedy system to
the league. But ice, which is what
makes hockey unique in the first
place, will always be quicker than
grass. Usain Bolt approaches 25
miles per hour sprinting on a
straightaway; the world's fastest
speed-skaters approach 40 miles per
hour sprinting on a round track.
And, of course, a hockey rink is
much smaller than a football field.
That makes for a much more
exciting game with more frequent
momentum changes. A pick-six is
easily the most devastating play in
football, when a team goes from an
opportunity to score to being
scored against in a heartbeat. The
hockey equivalent is an odd-man
rush, when one team's attackers
outnumber the defenders between
them and the goalie. By simple sub
traction, that means the team now
playing defense had the body-count
advantage on offense just a few sec
onds ago; anything from a bad
bounce off the boards to a slip by
the puck handler flipped the switch
and put one team at a disadvan
tage.
In 264 NFL games this year,
there were 71 pick-sixes thrown —
about one every four games and a
new league record. By contrast, a
single hockey game can easily have
10 or more odd-man rushes
between the two teams.
The comparison isn't perfect; a
pick-six is a guaranteed score, and
an odd-man rush is not. But odd
man rushes account for so many of
the goals scored in the NHL that
those instantaneous momentum
swings have the same, gut-wrench
ing implications if you're in the
stands.
Plus, the average hockey game
is an hour shorter than its football
counterpart. And if you've never
heard complaints about the length
of a football game, you've never sat
in the Red Zone.
This is no news to the skeptical
basketball fans in the crowd. Fast
breaks are even more common in
the NBA than odd-man rushes are
in the NHL, the game moves from
end to end just as often and, no,
basketball games don't take very
long either.
Even with their common speed,
there's something fundamentally
different between the two sports:
basketball is high-scoring, hockey
is low-scoring. That means that an
NHL player has to scratch and
claw a lot harder for a goal than an
NBA player has to for a basket, and
the physicality of hockey follows
naturally.
A lot of people are put off by
hockey's perceived violence, but
when those of us familiar with the
sport praise its physicality, we
aren't talking fistfights. The puck
handler can be leveled by an oppo
nent at all times, so he has to sacri
fice for every foot he skates
towards the goal. Defenders aren't
allowed to do that in basket
ball they're actually
encouraged to let the drib
bler run over them, resulting
in an epidemic of flopping.
Seriously, if you think the
most physical play in sports
should be one guy standing
still while another guy tips
him over like a bowling pin
on sleeping pills, basketball
is for you.
I'm not saying that
strength isn't an asset in the
NBA; you've still got to mus
cle your way to the basket
every now and then. But
going up against Chris
Pronger is just a wee bit
more dangerous than going
up against Shaq. (And if
you're not reading this
online, I advise you look up
Chris Pronger.)

As for America's pastime,
baseball? I do think there's a
lot more to the sport than a
lot of its detractors realize.
Even in such a slow-paced
game there's still tension,
and more than in any other
sport it's built on the fans'
intimate understanding of
the different situations and
players out on that field.
But today's fan isn't
always built on that depth of
knowledge. Thanks to
ESPN and other mega-net
works, sports have their own
24-hour news cycle and are
more accessible than ever.
When both sports freaks and
bandwagoners are as likely
to catch a Yankees game as a
Giants game, baseball's per
sonal side doesn't carry the
same weight and the game
loses the sentimentality that
makes it so interesting to the
devoted, monogamous fan.
Hockey is, by compari
son, faceless and how
could it not be, when the

players move quickly, wear
faceguards and are on the ice
no more than a third of the
time? Until the late-season
and playoff intrigue rolls
in, an Oilers game is just
as exciting for me as a
Sharks game. And an NHL
game grabs your attention
quicker than any other in
sports; how could you
change the channel when a
team is on the power play
Whichever marketing guru
invented the term, which
shouts, "If someone's going
to score it's going to be in
the next two minutes!"
deserves a raise. (We can all
agree that "runners at the
corners" doesn't have the
same zing.)
More than anything else,
there's just no standing
around in the outfield in
hockey. Even the guys on the
bench have to do a tango,
ducking away from pucks as
they wait to hurdle the
boards in the quickest sub

stitution in sports.
The MLB's pace of play
just can't compare. In base
ball you're lucky if you see
two pitches in a minute, but
in hockey that's long enough
for every skater on the ice to
exhaust themselves.
And now that I've
exhausted myself just to
convince you to watch the
greatest sport on Earth,
would it be that tough to
give it a try? Let me remind
you why, one last time:
Hockey is faster than
football. It's more physical
