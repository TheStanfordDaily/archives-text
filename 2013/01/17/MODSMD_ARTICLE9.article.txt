# CHAMPIONS RELOAD
## 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
After winning back-to-back
national championships, it's hard to
imagine how the Stanford women's
water polo team could improve in
2013. But that's what adding three
Olympic gold medalists can do for
you. Coupled with a strong fresh
man class, coach John Tanner has
an abundance of talent on his roster
despite losing four seniors from the
2012 squad.
Last season, redshirt senior
Melissa Seidemann and redshirt
junior Annika Dries took a leave of
absence to train with the United

States national team before heading
to London last summer. They both
return to the Farm this season,
along with Olympic MVP Maggie
Steffens, who will make her
Cardinal debut.
"They bring a huge amount of
experience and the excitement of
having won an Olympic gold medal,"
Tanner said. "We have so many
players new and returning—
—that have had really diverse water
polo backgrounds and experience."
The Cardinal brought in six
freshmen in addition to Steffens,
and according to Tanner, they all
"arrived ready to play."
"We're going to need to establish

a new identity with this group and
get used to one another as players,"
Tanner said. "There's a long famil
iarization process that we're just
getting started with."
Despite the fact that Tanner
gave the three returning Olympians
time off during the fall quarter to
regroup and get back into the swing
of things, the transition has been
smooth.
"It was really hard for me to
leave [the team], so while I was
away, I did everything I could to go
to games and send them support,"
said Seidemann, a 2013 team cap
tain. "When I came back, I didn't
really feel like I had been away for

that long."
Steffens, who was recently
named the Best Female Water Polo
Player of 2012 by the Federation
Internationale de Natation (FINA),
said that although international play
and collegiate play can be very dif
ferent, the team aspect is the same.
"Every team you go on, no mat
ter how good the players are, you
have to form a team and create rela
tionships with your new team
mates," Steffens said. "I think we've
been doing a really good job of that
and I'm looking forward to our first
game as a team."

Senior 2-meter Melissa Seidermann (right) returns to Stanford for the 2013 season after taking a year off in 2012 to train for the 2012 London
Olympics. Seidemann, Stanford's 2013 captain, and two of her current Stanford teammates helped lead Team USA to the gold medal.
On Wednesday, Stanford
played Cal in a preseason
scrimmage at Avery Aquatic
Center. In the Cardinal's final
dress rehearsal before the
season starts, the team estab
lished the game-day routine
by wearing matching outfits
to the pool and meeting in the
team room before the match.
"It was interesting
because I think for a lot of the
freshman, it was shocking to
take all that in," Seidemann
said. "But to then realize that
we are really just playing
water polo like we do in prac
tice is a good balance to find."
Tanner said it was also
valuable for the team to see
how they matched up against
outside competition.
"After two months, it was
great to play a different oppo
nent besides ourselves,"
Tanner said. "We've been
working a lot of our front
court offense and defense and
our power-play offense and
defense and we were looking
to see that reflected in our
play-
Besides the Olympians,
the Cardinal has a strong core
of returning players. Senior
Kate Baldoni will again be
manning the net after posting
the best goals-against aver
age in the MPSF last season,
and senior co-captain Jillian
Garton will be leading the
team from the driver position.

The team's top two scorers
from last season Kiley
Neushul and Ashley
Grossman both return for
their sophomore seasons.
According to Tanner, his
squad is both versatile and
dynamic.
"We have people who can
play multiple positions, so
we'll be able to change tempos
within the course of a game,"
Tanner said. "Being able to
play at a slower tempo if the
situation dictates and also
being able to play at a high
speed is a huge advantage."
As the team aims for a
third consecutive national
championship, depth will be
key.
"No matter who is in the
water, we know they will put
up a good fight and be able to
make plays," Steffens said.
"We have seven players in the
water, but we'll also have six
plus players on the bench that
can go in."
That depth will help the
Cardinal navigate a grueling
early-season schedule. After
the season-opening matchup
against Michigan next Friday
Stanford will compete in three
tournaments consisting of four
games in one weekend. MPSF
Competition begins on March
2 against CSU Bakersfield.
"It's been a long time wait
ing for the season to start,"
Tanner said. "The whole fall
quarter is just a preamble to
competition and now it's for
real. We're really excited."

"No matter who is in the

up a good fight and be able to

can go in."

After winning back-to-back
national championships, it's hard to
imagine how the Stanford women's
water polo team could improve in
2013. But that's what adding three
Olympic gold medalists can do for
you. Coupled with a strong fresh
man class, coach John Tanner has
an abundance of talent on his roster
despite losing four seniors from the
2012 squad.
Last season, redshirt senior
Melissa Seidemann and redshirt
junior Annika Dries took a leave of
absence to train with the United

States national team before heading
to London last summer. They both
return to the Farm this season,
along with Olympic MVP Maggie
Steffens, who will make her
Cardinal debut.
"They bring a huge amount of
experience and the excitement of
having won an Olympic gold medal,"
Tanner said. "We have so many
players new and returning—
—that have had really diverse water
polo backgrounds and experience."
The Cardinal brought in six
freshmen in addition to Steffens,
and according to Tanner, they all
"arrived ready to play."
"We're going to need to establish

a new identity with this group and
get used to one another as players,"
Tanner said. "There's a long famil
iarization process that we're just
getting started with."
Despite the fact that Tanner
gave the three returning Olympians
time off during the fall quarter to
regroup and get back into the swing
of things, the transition has been
smooth.
"It was really hard for me to
leave [the team], so while I was
away, I did everything I could to go
to games and send them support,"
said Seidemann, a 2013 team cap
tain. "When I came back, I didn't
really feel like I had been away for

that long."
Steffens, who was recently
named the Best Female Water Polo
Player of 2012 by the Federation
Internationale de Natation (FINA),
said that although international play
and collegiate play can be very dif
ferent, the team aspect is the same.
"Every team you go on, no mat
ter how good the players are, you
have to form a team and create rela
tionships with your new team
mates," Steffens said. "I think we've
been doing a really good job of that
and I'm looking forward to our first
game as a team."

Senior 2-meter Melissa Seidermann (right) returns to Stanford for the 2013 season after taking a year off in 2012 to train for the 2012 London
Olympics. Seidemann, Stanford's 2013 captain, and two of her current Stanford teammates helped lead Team USA to the gold medal.
On Wednesday, Stanford
played Cal in a preseason
scrimmage at Avery Aquatic
Center. In the Cardinal's final
dress rehearsal before the
season starts, the team estab
lished the game-day routine
by wearing matching outfits
to the pool and meeting in the
team room before the match.
"It was interesting
because I think for a lot of the
freshman, it was shocking to
take all that in," Seidemann
said. "But to then realize that
we are really just playing
water polo like we do in prac
tice is a good balance to find."
Tanner said it was also
valuable for the team to see
how they matched up against
outside competition.
"After two months, it was
great to play a different oppo
nent besides ourselves,"
Tanner said. "We've been
working a lot of our front
court offense and defense and
our power-play offense and
defense and we were looking
to see that reflected in our
play-
Besides the Olympians,
the Cardinal has a strong core
of returning players. Senior
Kate Baldoni will again be
manning the net after posting
the best goals-against aver
age in the MPSF last season,
and senior co-captain Jillian
Garton will be leading the
team from the driver position.

The team's top two scorers
from last season Kiley
Neushul and Ashley
Grossman both return for
their sophomore seasons.
According to Tanner, his
squad is both versatile and
dynamic.
"We have people who can
play multiple positions, so
we'll be able to change tempos
within the course of a game,"
Tanner said. "Being able to
play at a slower tempo if the
situation dictates and also
being able to play at a high
speed is a huge advantage."
As the team aims for a
third consecutive national
championship, depth will be
key.
"No matter who is in the
water, we know they will put
up a good fight and be able to
make plays," Steffens said.
"We have seven players in the
water, but we'll also have six
plus players on the bench that
can go in."
