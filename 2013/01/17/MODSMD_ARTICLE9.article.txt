# CHAMPIONS RELOAD

### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
After winning back-to-back
national championships, it's hard to
imagine how the Stanford women's
water polo team could improve in
2013. But that's what adding three
Olympic gold medalists can do for
you. Coupled with a strong fresh
man class, coach John Tanner has
an abundance of talent on his roster
despite losing four seniors from the
2012 squad.
Last season, redshirt senior
Melissa Seidemann and redshirt
junior Annika Dries took a leave of
absence to train with the United

States national team before heading
to London last summer. They both
return to the Farm this season,
along with Olympic MVP Maggie
Steffens, who will make her
Cardinal debut.
"They bring a huge amount of
experience and the excitement of
having won an Olympic gold medal,"
Tanner said. "We have so many
players new and returning—
—that have had really diverse water
polo backgrounds and experience."
The Cardinal brought in six
freshmen in addition to Steffens,
and according to Tanner, they all
"arrived ready to play."
"We're going to need to establish

a new identity with this group and
get used to one another as players,"
Tanner said. "There's a long famil
iarization process that we're just
getting started with."
Despite the fact that Tanner
gave the three returning Olympians
time off during the fall quarter to
regroup and get back into the swing
of things, the transition has been
smooth.
"It was really hard for me to
leave [the team], so while I was
away, I did everything I could to go
to games and send them support,"
said Seidemann, a 2013 team cap
tain. "When I came back, I didn't
really feel like I had been away for

that long."
Steffens, who was recently
named the Best Female Water Polo
Player of 2012 by the Federation
Internationale de Natation (FINA),
said that although international play
and collegiate play can be very dif
ferent, the team aspect is the same.
"Every team you go on, no mat
ter how good the players are, you
have to form a team and create rela
tionships with your new team
mates," Steffens said. "I think we've
been doing a really good job of that
and I'm looking forward to our first
game as a team."
