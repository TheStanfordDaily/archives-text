## What was Pete Thamel thinking? 
### Sam Fisher 
I've never been so angry at a
journalist in my life. Today,
Pete Thamel published a story
explaining his actions in pub
lishing Sports Illustrated's
Oct. 1 issue's cover story on Manti
Te'o. Thamel's reporting is an embar
rassment.
Thamel admits that, though he
"had little reason to believe she didn't
exist... In retrospect, there were
some red flags."
Some red flags? Are you kidding
me? I can barely find anything that
sounds truthful in the whole inter
view.
Let's start with some of the most
glaring issues. Thamel looked for
funeral notices, obituaries and arti
cles about her car crash. What did he
find? Nothing.
Thamel called Mike Eubanks,
Stanford Football's primary media
contact, to verify Kekua's graduation
year. Eubanks couldn't find any
record of her at Stanford and men
tioned that he "thought it was odd
that, on such a small campus, he'd
never heard of a student dating Te'o."
"This was the most glaring sign I
missed," Thamel admits.
That was the red flag. That was
the sign that should have brought
down the entire hoax. Thamel could
have even combined it with Tfe'o's
claim that Kekua graduated in 2010
or 2011 but died at the age of 22 in
Sept. 2012 not impossible but
extremely unlikely —to have an
excuse to dig deeper.
But what did Thamel and Spoils
Illustrated do? They simply "took any
reference to Stanford out of the sto
ry."
That was Sports Illustrated's
journalistic response? For a cover
story in one of the nation's leading
magazines, Sports Illustrated was
content to just remove the Stanford
reference?
Let's say that instead, Thamel
made one more phone call to literally
anyone at Stanford. After speaking
with Eubanks, he could have called
Stanford's public relations to check
for any official records of Kekua at
the school, which Deadspin later did.
He could have called us at The
Stanford Daily or anyone else in
Stanford student media. We regular
ly receive emails and phone calls from
national media seeking to clarify a
Stanford aspect of a story or asking
us to check something in our archives.
That's why the managing editors'
contact information is so readily
available online.
To put this in perspective, Editor
in Chief Billy Gallagher was inter
viewed by ESPN for a fluff piece on
The Play from the 1982 Big Game,
but no one at The Daily was ever con
tacted to confirm Kekua's existence.
Within an hour and I'd guess it
would actually take closer to 10 min
utes Thamel would've been able to
confirm that Kekua had never actual
ly gone to Stanford, a glaring hole in
Te'o's interview. Is that too long to
spend fact checking a Sports
Illustrated cover story?
Journalists are supposed to ques
tion stories. Journalists are watch
dogs, given the task of asking the
tough question to sort out right from
wrong. Journalists are curators of the
truth.
Even if Pete Thamel, so pressured
by the looming two-hour post-inter
view deadline to submit the story, felt
that he had to submit without includ
ing the Stanford piece, how could he
not follow up? Just one more phone
call, and the whole story could have
unraveled months ago.
Right now, we don't know how
much of a part Te'o had in this "hoax."
Te'o claims that he was fooled
through December. If that is true, not
only did Thamel let the public down
by not reporting deeper, he also let
Te'o down. He let Te'o suffer for his
girlfriend's death for three more
months, all because he wasn't curious
enough to make one more phone call.
This story is one of the most com
plex and unreal stories of our genera
tion. Yesterday, the entire Stanford
Daily sports staff, myself included,
agonized over missing it. We spent
hours debating what we could have
done to break it.
Why didn't any of us stumble
upon the South Bend Tribune article
back in October that mentioned
Lenny Kekua as a former Stanford
student? Why didn't any of us catch
another brief reference to Kekua's
Stanford connection in The New York
Times just days later? Just a hint of
the word Stanford, and this story was
ours.
But those two references slipped
through the cracks, so we missed it.
Pete Thamel was lucky, though.
Manti Te'o mentioned that Kekua
graduated from Stanford. Not
only that, but Te'o stumbled
on her graduation year and
her major. Te'o gave Thamel
two excuses to call Stanford
and clarify facts on Kekua,
and he still missed the story.
Maybe I can't under
stand Thamel's deadline
pressure. Maybe I can't
understand how Thamel
could have been sold by
Te'o's emotional story face to
face. Maybe I'm wrong to
judge him for missing the
story.

People have spent the
last day blaming my staff
and me for missing the story.
Believe it or not, I actually

think that's fair. I blame
myself too. Honestly, I feel
that I should read The New
York Times sports section
every day, and if I did, I
would've broken the story in
October when I read that
Lennay Kekua graduated
from Stanford.

That was my one chance,
and I didn't even come close
to grabbing it. Pete Thamel
had it gift-wrapped for him
and tucked it away in the
corner for Deadspin to dis
cover almost four months
later.

Maybe it's more than just
Thamel. Is this a national
problem occurring with jour
nalism around the world?

We are supposed to do
everything in our power to
print the best version of
truth at the time of publish
ing. Based on Thamel's

account of his conversation
with Mike Eubanks, the sto
ry of Lenny Kekua was not
the best version of the truth
when he sent his story to his
editors.

Journalists cannot let
this happen anymore. If part
of a story is unsettling to you
or a source, then dig deeper.
Certainly don't ignore it.
Otherwise, you're just doing
a public relations piece, and
I've read enough of those,
especially on Manti Te'o and
Notre Dame.

noon taking out his anger

another brief reference to Kekua's
Stanford connection in The New York
Times just days later? Just a hint of
the word Stanford, and this story was
ours.
But those two references slipped
through the cracks, so we missed it.
Pete Thamel was lucky, though.
Manti Te'o mentioned that Kekua
graduated from Stanford. Not
only that, but Te'o stumbled
on her graduation year and
her major. Te'o gave Thamel
two excuses to call Stanford
and clarify facts on Kekua,
and he still missed the story.
Maybe I can't under
stand Thamel's deadline
pressure. Maybe I can't
understand how Thamel
could have been sold by
Te'o's emotional story face to
face. Maybe I'm wrong to
judge him for missing the
story.

People have spent the
last day blaming my staff
and me for missing the story.
Believe it or not, I actually

think that's fair. I blame
myself too. Honestly, I feel
that I should read The New
York Times sports section
every day, and if I did, I
would've broken the story in
October when I read that
Lennay Kekua graduated
from Stanford.

That was my one chance,
and I didn't even come close
to grabbing it. Pete Thamel
had it gift-wrapped for him
and tucked it away in the
corner for Deadspin to dis
cover almost four months
later.

Maybe it's more than just
Thamel. Is this a national
problem occurring with jour
nalism around the world?

We are supposed to do
everything in our power to
print the best version of
truth at the time of publish
ing. Based on Thamel's

account of his conversation
with Mike Eubanks, the sto
ry of Lenny Kekua was not
the best version of the truth
when he sent his story to his
editors.

Journalists cannot let
this happen anymore. If part
of a story is unsettling to you
or a source, then dig deeper.
Certainly don't ignore it.
Otherwise, you're just doing
a public relations piece, and
I've read enough of those,
especially on Manti Te'o and
Notre Dame.

I've never been so angry at a
journalist in my life. Today,
Pete Thamel published a story
explaining his actions in pub
lishing Sports Illustrated's
Oct. 1 issue's cover story on Manti
Te'o. Thamel's reporting is an embar
rassment.
Thamel admits that, though he
"had little reason to believe she didn't
exist... In retrospect, there were
some red flags."
Some red flags? Are you kidding
me? I can barely find anything that
sounds truthful in the whole inter
view.
Let's start with some of the most
glaring issues. Thamel looked for
funeral notices, obituaries and arti
cles about her car crash. What did he
find? Nothing.
Thamel called Mike Eubanks,
Stanford Football's primary media
contact, to verify Kekua's graduation
year. Eubanks couldn't find any
record of her at Stanford and men
tioned that he "thought it was odd
that, on such a small campus, he'd
never heard of a student dating Te'o."
"This was the most glaring sign I
missed," Thamel admits.
That was the red flag. That was
the sign that should have brought
down the entire hoax. Thamel could
have even combined it with Tfe'o's
claim that Kekua graduated in 2010
or 2011 but died at the age of 22 in
Sept. 2012 not impossible but
extremely unlikely —to have an
excuse to dig deeper.
But what did Thamel and Spoils
Illustrated do? They simply "took any
reference to Stanford out of the sto
ry."
That was Sports Illustrated's
journalistic response? For a cover
story in one of the nation's leading
magazines, Sports Illustrated was
content to just remove the Stanford
reference?
Let's say that instead, Thamel
made one more phone call to literally
anyone at Stanford. After speaking
with Eubanks, he could have called
Stanford's public relations to check
for any official records of Kekua at
the school, which Deadspin later did.
He could have called us at The
Stanford Daily or anyone else in
Stanford student media. We regular
ly receive emails and phone calls from
national media seeking to clarify a
Stanford aspect of a story or asking
us to check something in our archives.
That's why the managing editors'
contact information is so readily
available online.
To put this in perspective, Editor
in Chief Billy Gallagher was inter
viewed by ESPN for a fluff piece on
The Play from the 1982 Big Game,
but no one at The Daily was ever con
tacted to confirm Kekua's existence.
Within an hour and I'd guess it
would actually take closer to 10 min
utes Thamel would've been able to
confirm that Kekua had never actual
ly gone to Stanford, a glaring hole in
Te'o's interview. Is that too long to
spend fact checking a Sports
Illustrated cover story?
Journalists are supposed to ques
tion stories. Journalists are watch
dogs, given the task of asking the
tough question to sort out right from
wrong. Journalists are curators of the
truth.
Even if Pete Thamel, so pressured
by the looming two-hour post-inter
view deadline to submit the story, felt
that he had to submit without includ
ing the Stanford piece, how could he
not follow up? Just one more phone
call, and the whole story could have
unraveled months ago.
Right now, we don't know how
much of a part Te'o had in this "hoax."
Te'o claims that he was fooled
through December. If that is true, not
only did Thamel let the public down
by not reporting deeper, he also let
Te'o down. He let Te'o suffer for his
girlfriend's death for three more
months, all because he wasn't curious
enough to make one more phone call.
This story is one of the most com
plex and unreal stories of our genera
tion. Yesterday, the entire Stanford
Daily sports staff, myself included,
agonized over missing it. We spent
hours debating what we could have
done to break it.
Why didn't any of us stumble
upon the South Bend Tribune article
back in October that mentioned
Lenny Kekua as a former Stanford
student? Why didn't any of us catch
another brief reference to Kekua's
Stanford connection in The New York
Times just days later? Just a hint of
the word Stanford, and this story was
