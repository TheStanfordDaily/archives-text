## STANFORD HEADS SOUTH 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
heads into weekend play ranked third in the
Pac-12, the first time in seven seasons that the
Card fail to lead the conference, after Cal broke
its 81-game conference winning streak on
Tuesday. A lot of weight is being placed on
these two upcoming games as the Card (14-2,3-
1 Pac-12) looks to redeem itself against the only
teams left undefeated in the conference
UCLA (13-2,4-0) and USC (7-8,4-0).
After losing two consecutive home games
for the first time since the 2000-01 season, the
Card dropped to sixth in the AP and USA
Today Coaches' Pollsâ€”the first time that
Stanford has been left out of the top five since
March of 2009.
However, this is the same team that also
pulled off road victories against then-No. 1
Baylor and No. 10 Tennessee and is confident
that it can make the necessary corrections to
right the ship this weekend in critical confer
ence matchups.
"I do know that we're trying to be more
aggressive in practice and trying to emphasize
things that will make us more successful," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We're really
learning how teams are playing us, how differ
ent teams scout us and what we need to do."
Stanford continues to be led by offensive
and defensive threat, junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike. Ogwumike is averaging 21.4 ppg
and 11.6 rpg while shooting 57 percent from the
field. Rounding out the Card's triple threat is
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle (12 ppg, 5.5 rpg)
and sophomore point guard Amber Orrange
(10.8 ppg, 4.38 apg).
Redshirt freshman guard Jasmine Camp is
expected to split playing time this weekend
with Orrange as she continues to stand out in
practice after recovering from last year's foot
injury. Junior Toni Kokenis has struggled
throughout the season to regain her All-Pac-12
level of play after not feeling well at the begin
ning of the season.
"I think [Toni] is as healthy as she's going to
be this year," said VanDerveer. "It's day-by-day
how she feels. I think she's not as aggressive
offensively, but she's working pretty hard
defensively."
No. 15 UCLA comes into tonight's game off
of a six-game win streak and boasting this
week's Pac-12 Player of the Week. UCLA has
some experience against top-ranked teams
after beating No. 11 Oklahoma but falling to

No. 5 Notre Dame.
Junior guard Atonye Nyingifa (12.9 ppg, 8.3
rpg) has dropped double-digits scoring outings
in five consecutive games. Last week against
Washington and Washington State, she aver
aged 17 points, 7.5 rebounds and two steals
while shooting an impressive .737 from the field
and .857 from the free throw line, earning her
the Pac-12 Player of the Week honor.
Senior guard Markel Walker leads the
Bruins in scoring and rebounding with 12.9 ppg
and 8.3 rpg. Walker made the All Pac-12 team
last season and continues to lead her team this
year.
"UCLA's coming in here, [and] they're play
ing nine people, and we're playing six or sev
en," said VanDerveer. "They press, they trap,
they go for steals in a similar way that Cal did
but maybe more full-court.
While UCLA has even scoring across the
boards, USC has experienced consistently
dominant play from junior forward Cassie
Harberts. Harberts was last week's Pac-12

Player of the Week as she helped the Trojans
end a six-game losing streak with wins against
Oregon and Oregon State. Last year, she was
awarded All Pac-12 Honorable Mention, and
this year she is averaging 17.9 ppg with 7.9 rpg.
Both USC and UCLA will have to play at
the top of their games in order to keep up with
the newly focused and determined Cardinal.
"This is just what the doctor ordered for us.
I think sometimes it's tough for our team to
have, I don't know, 'feel-good' wins," said
VanDerveer. "We beat Utah, we beat Colorado,
we beat Cal at Cal, but it's like, we're supposed
to beat these people. I think this is a great
opportunity for our team to come in, and we'll
have to play well to win, and people can feel
good about it."
The Card plays UCLA tonight at 8 p.m. and
USC on Sunday at 4:30 p.m., both at Maples
Pavilion.

Despite struggling as a team in consecutive home losses to UConn and Cal, the women's
basketball team has plenty of time to right the ship with Pac-12 play now underway. Junior
forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) will lead them against UCLA and USC this weekend.
