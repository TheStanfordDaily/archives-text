# MAKING IT COUNT
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite suffering through last
weekend's tough road trip that
included losses to Brown, No. 21
Maryland, Harvard and American,
Stanford's wrestling team is excit
ed to be back at home to host No.
25 Air Force tonight and visit No. 9

Oregon State tomorrow night for a
Pac-12 dual.
"The team did have a rough
weekend," redshirt junior Bret
Baumbach said, "but all we can do
is bounce back and look forward to
tonight. After that we can think
about Oregon State, but our focus
right now is going to battle against
Air Force."

The Falcons enter tonight's
match on a bit of a hot streak, hav
ing won three straight dual meets.
Two of Air Force's wrestlers are
also ranked in the top 10 in the
country: senior 149-pounder Cole
YonOhlen (21-2) is No. 4 in his
weight class, and freshman Josh
Martinez (18-6) is No. 10 at 125
pounds.

With VonOhlen and junior Josh
Kreimier, the Falcons have two vet
erans with NCAA Championships
experience, which could be critical
against a relatively inexperienced
Stanford squad.
And that Cardinal team has
been struggling a bit of late, post
ing a 4-10 overall record through
the first 14 matches. Youth has cer
tainly been an issue, as coach Jason
Borrelli's probable lineup features
no seniors and likely just three jun
iors.
Nevertheless, Baumbach (165
pounds), junior heavyweight Dan
Scherer and redshirt freshman
Evan Silver (125) pounds had good
outings last weekend. Baumbach
went undefeated, including record
ing a fall while wrestling up a
weight class at 174 pounds.
Silver and Scherer also had
three wins apiece, with Silver
upsetting No. 17 Shane Gentry of
Maryland.
"It's great to see individuals
flourish at certain spots,"
Baumbach said. "It's great to see
Evan pick up a huge win and see
him and Dan both go 3-0 on the
first day. But after that day ends,
you kind of have to forget about it
and move on. What we take from it
is that we do see that there's
improvement, which is what coach
says is how you can evaluate where
you are, by how much you're
improving."
Things won't get any easier on
Saturday against Oregon State in
the Card's second Pac-12 dual of
the year. The Beavers (4-3,1-1 Pac
-12) are the highest-ranked Pac-12
squad in the latest polls and boast
five wrestlers ranked in the top 10
of their individual weight classes.
Seniors Chad Hanke (heavy
weight) and Mike Mangrum (141
pounds) lead the way at No. 4.
Junior 149-pounder Scott
Sakaguchi and sophomore 197-
pounder Taylor Meeks both come
in at No. 8, while junior RJ Pena
(157 pounds) is No. 10.
In addition, the schedulemakers
at the Pac-12 did the Cardinal no
favors in pushing the dual against

Although the team struggled during last weekend's road trip, Stanford has several wrestlers who have
been performing well on the mat lately and are expected to give No. 25 Air Force a handful tonight.
Oregon State from its originally
scheduled slot on Sunday up to
Saturday night. Stanford will fly
out early Saturday morning and
head from the airport straight to

the arena for a prematch work
out designed to help the team
make its second consecutive
weigh-in in less than 24 hours.
"That's not something that's
easy," Baumbach said of the
schedule. "It's very stressful and
plays a big part kind of in the
background. It doesn't make or
break anything, but it is an
obstacle to get around. There's

not a lot of down time in a stress
ful 24-hour period, and it's some
thing we don't see very often."
Stanford takes on the Falcons
from Burnham Pavilion tonight
at 6 p.m., with Saturday's match
against Oregon State set to start
at 7 p.m. from Corvallis, Ore.
