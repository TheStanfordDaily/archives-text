# OPINIONS
## SEEING GREEN Raiders of the lost rangeland 
### Holly Moeller 
Confession: I have been caught
up in my own little world for
the last few weeks.
Between work deadlines, frantic
conference preparations, visits with
friends and family and the start of a
new quarter, I haven't looked at the
news in several weeks (except to
groan at Congressional dramatics
and smirk at Notre Dame's defeat).
So when I took a break from my
usual commute diet of hip-hop
interspersed with bluegrass music
to tune in to NPR earlier this week,
I was surprised to hear a story
about Mali.
Mali. That's a country I haven't
thought about in so long that I had
to break out a map.
The land-locked West African
nation sits mostly in the sandy
Sahara Desert, the ancestral home
of the nomadic Tuareg people (yes,
the ones from whom that
Volkswagen gets its name). And for
the last year, it's been a locked in a
series of city-conquering, govern
ment-overthrowing conflicts that
have finally stirred France's other
wise-passive president (and, as of
yesterday, the United Nations) into
action.
If you listen to the United
States' spin on the story, you'll
quickly learn that the developed
world's intervention is necessary to
eliminate another safe haven for
Al-Qaeda —and, for France, to
protect French citizens living
abroad in the former French colony.
And while that's largely true of the
present series of clashes between
Islamic militant groups and the
Malian army, the conflict stems
from a deep-seated dispute
between the Tuareg and Arab
nomads and the Malian govern
ment.
For the last two decades,
through an iterative process of vio
lent skirmishes and uneasy truces,
the nomadic peoples of the Sahara
have sought the independence of a
region of Northern Mali they call
Azawad. (The involvement of Al-
Qaeda is recent: In 2012, the
nomads allied with Islamist groups,
who helped them drive government
forces out of Azawad before them
selves turning on the nomadic inde
pendence movement.)
For the Tuareg, the Azawad
region whose name, roughly
translated, refers to their nomadic
lifestyle would be a homeland
slightly bigger than the state of
Texas which, though resource poor,
might provide enough area for sus
tainable pastoralism, a rare feat in
the modern age.

Nomadic pastoralists herd live
stock for their living, shifting their
grazing animals from pasture to
pasture as conditions change.
(Pastoralism that follows seasonal
movement patterns, like that of the
Sami of Scandinavia or even of the
cowboys of the American West, is
called transhumance.) As a people,
pastoralists are tough and adap
tive, highly mobile and ready to
shift their herds and their families
with every change in weather or
season. They survive on marginal
land unsuitable for traditional, stat
ic farming practices, and, histori
cally, probably practiced one of the
most sustainable uses for such land.
By constantly moving their herds,
they avoided overgrazing and dam
aging any one piece of the land
scape mosaic they traveled.
However, such mobility required

free passage across large swathes
of open land.
That's why, though historically
widespread, nomadic pastoralism is
increasingly confined to unsustain
ably small stretches of land, pinned
uncomfortably between the
encroaching walls of urban and
agricultural development. As tech
nology advances, so too does our
ability to statically occupy farm
land that requires heavy irrigation
or houses that require climate con
trol. And, as our population swells,
we increasingly need to press
remote scraps of land into intense
service and we become increasingly
territorial about the borders that
surround the resources we've
claimed as our own.
All of this spells disaster for the
pastoral lifestyle, which is funda
mentally incompatible with barri
ers and as in Mali sometimes
crashes through them, painfully
and maybe even dangerously, in the
company of strange alliances exac
erbated by today's complex politi
cal climate.
Shifts in the physical climate
might prove problematic as well. If
—as many models predict
weather variability intensifies,
threats to food security for both
static and nomadic pastoralists will
abound. It seems reasonable to
hypothesize that reduced food
security will lead to increased con
flict, as has been the argument of
many a policymaker and politician,
though we're still waiting on the
data to convincingly support that
claim.
When I was a little girl, I used to
fall asleep to romantic visions of
Bedouin horsemen galloping their
Arabian steeds across the desert
from oasis to oasis. Though the
nomadic lifestyle would never have
suited me, and the mental image
born of reading too many Walter
Farley books probably bore little
resemblance to reality, it's nice to
remember that, at least at one
point, there was room in the world
for those lifestyles.

yesterday, the United Nations) into
action.
If you listen to the United
States' spin on the story, you'll
quickly learn that the developed
world's intervention is necessary to
eliminate another safe haven for
Al-Qaeda —and, for France, to
protect French citizens living
abroad in the former French colony.
And while that's largely true of the
present series of clashes between
Islamic militant groups and the
Malian army, the conflict stems
from a deep-seated dispute
between the Tuareg and Arab
nomads and the Malian govern
ment.
For the last two decades,
through an iterative process of vio
lent skirmishes and uneasy truces,
the nomadic peoples of the Sahara
have sought the independence of a
region of Northern Mali they call
Azawad. (The involvement of Al-
Qaeda is recent: In 2012, the
nomads allied with Islamist groups,
who helped them drive government
forces out of Azawad before them
selves turning on the nomadic inde
pendence movement.)
For the Tuareg, the Azawad
region whose name, roughly
translated, refers to their nomadic
lifestyle would be a homeland
slightly bigger than the state of
Texas which, though resource poor,
might provide enough area for sus
tainable pastoralism, a rare feat in
the modern age.

Nomadic pastoralists herd live
stock for their living, shifting their
grazing animals from pasture to
pasture as conditions change.
(Pastoralism that follows seasonal
movement patterns, like that of the
Sami of Scandinavia or even of the
cowboys of the American West, is
called transhumance.) As a people,
pastoralists are tough and adap
tive, highly mobile and ready to
shift their herds and their families
with every change in weather or
season. They survive on marginal
land unsuitable for traditional, stat
ic farming practices, and, histori
cally, probably practiced one of the
most sustainable uses for such land.
By constantly moving their herds,
they avoided overgrazing and dam
aging any one piece of the land
scape mosaic they traveled.
However, such mobility required

free passage across large swathes
of open land.
That's why, though historically
widespread, nomadic pastoralism is
increasingly confined to unsustain
ably small stretches of land, pinned
uncomfortably between the
encroaching walls of urban and
agricultural development. As tech
nology advances, so too does our
ability to statically occupy farm
land that requires heavy irrigation
or houses that require climate con
trol. And, as our population swells,
we increasingly need to press
remote scraps of land into intense
service and we become increasingly
territorial about the borders that
surround the resources we've
claimed as our own.
All of this spells disaster for the
pastoral lifestyle, which is funda
mentally incompatible with barri
ers and as in Mali sometimes
crashes through them, painfully
and maybe even dangerously, in the
company of strange alliances exac
erbated by today's complex politi
cal climate.
Shifts in the physical climate
might prove problematic as well. If
—as many models predict
weather variability intensifies,
threats to food security for both
static and nomadic pastoralists will
abound. It seems reasonable to
hypothesize that reduced food
security will lead to increased con
flict, as has been the argument of
many a policymaker and politician,
though we're still waiting on the
data to convincingly support that
claim.
When I was a little girl, I used to
fall asleep to romantic visions of
Bedouin horsemen galloping their
Arabian steeds across the desert
from oasis to oasis. Though the
nomadic lifestyle would never have
suited me, and the mental image
born of reading too many Walter
Farley books probably bore little
resemblance to reality, it's nice to
remember that, at least at one
point, there was room in the world
for those lifestyles.
