## The 						pressure to be happy and the crisis of the humanities 
### Alex Bayer 
This column is the first in a two
part series examining the connec
tions between happiness, pressure
and the study of the humanities at
Stanford.

There are worse things than
being in a place of happy peo
ple. At times, the effect can
even be contagious. But there are
also (and I hate to be the gnat who
puts a damper on the party) draw
backs to living in a utopia.
When I say utopia, I don't mean it
in the theoretical sense of the word,
as in a place where bliss truly does
exist endlessly, but in its concrete
application: a term to describe places
that aspire to be Utopias by exclaim
ing that everyone there is happy, and
through this myth, keeping everyone,
through the corresponding fear - of
being left behind or isolated, "happy."
And, yes, you may have guessed, I
deem Stanford one of these places.
The myth that "everyone here is
happy all the time" makes feeling
unhappy abnormal and shameful. I
am surely not the only one who, upon
feeling a bout of sadness, retreats
inward. When I come across an
acquaintance in the bookstore, I plas
ter on my smile.
"How are you?" they ask. "Good,"
I say. At times I say, "Okay," for this is
my most courageous euphemism for,
"Life absolutely sucks at the
moment." Whenever I get beyond
the superficial banter stage, I learn
that everyone has insecurities, sad
days and, most upsettingly for me, a
sense of guilt and isolation for feeling
these things; every time one of these
"revelation" moments occurs, I feel
surprised, strangely enough. To have
come across another human being?
Why should students feel ashamed of
feeling what is perfectly normal?
This has created a crisis: CAPS
(Vaden's psychological services wing)
is so flooded with demand that it can't
adequately accommodate the num
ber of students seeking its services.
When two student suicides occurred
last year, there was silence on the
part of the administration not even
a candlelit vigil in White Plaza. Are
we afraid of what would happen to us
if we voice our sadness and our confu
sion, or even worse, our- grief? Are we
afraid that other people will see
something wrong with us, cast us off

with the party-pooping crowd who
can't have fun? I believe that what we
fear is excommunication, not of the
official sort, but of the unspoken and
insidious kind.

The weakest members of a utopia
are the ones who can't have fun. In a
true community, the greatest threats
are the ones who haven't learned to
empathize, practice humility, care for
the injured. Sadness is not a charac
ter trait. It is a passing emotion that
we are all wont to feel at some time or
another. However, in a utopia, sad
ness and its many cousins (insecurity,
self-doubt, confusion, grief, jealousy)
are diagnosed as character flaws and
prescribed one of two antidotes: sup
press it in public and tend to it in pri
vate, or leave, lest you risk spoiling
the fun for the rest.

The greatest, and most effective,
medicine for this natural and
inevitable recourse of the human
mind is not "medicine," but empathy.
To compel students to emulate an
aura of immaculate happiness is to
deprive everyone of an open and car
ing community. It is to shut down
meaningful communication between
students (a blockade they must over
come through their own devices),
depriving them of the guidance and
sympathy of thousands of young
adults going through the same trials
and tribulations.

This brings me to the value of
humanities. I will allow you a moment
to groan, rightfully so, for I am not
the first, nor will I be the last, to
bemoan the dwindling presence of
the liberal arts here. The argument I
hear most often is that humanities
are beneficial to one's intellectual rea
soning. Well, yes. All learning is. Yet
the bigger grievance I have with this
argument is that it assigns value to
the humanities based on how success
ful they can make you. Law schools
actually favor English degrees.
Medical schools in fact prefer
students with a solid, well
rounded liberal arts education.
An art. history minor will distin
guish you from all those other
Microsoft applicants. Philosophy
is a great exercise for the mind,
so you can tackle those tough-as
nails interviews (and dazzle
your interviewers and. col
leagues with Sophocles quotes.
Thus, many students, I take it,

interact with the humanities because
they are compelled to or (if the good
will campaign is a success) because
they have been convinced it will help
them out in their pursuit of a success
ful, practical career. What is missing
is a discussion of why humanities are
indispensable in and of themselves.
They deserve more than to simply
be a means to an end. However much
the sciences may reveal about the
body or the world or the neurological
origins of happiness, what they can
never do is instruct you in how to live.
For two millennia, the greatest minds
have wrestled with the existential
questions that we all inevitably
encounter: who am I? What is my
place, my purpose, in the world?
They have produced an infinite
amount of literature to help us along
with this process. Mourning a loved
one? Pining for the guy who dumped
you? Envious of the girl who has it
all? There is, if not an answer, then a
guidebook for that.

A library can be seen as a medi
cine cabinet for your emotional ail
ments. A pharmacy may be able to
prescribe you Prozac for the depres
sion that stemmed from the break
up, but the pharmacist will not tell
you about the awful break-up she had
when she was your age, how she hat
ed yet still loved him, how she got
over him and what she learned about
love from it. If the "classics major will
get you into law school" argument is
effective because it speaks, quite
frankly, to our self-centered ambition,
then why aren't we selling humanities
on the basis that studying them is an
entirely self-serving experience?

In next week's column, Alex will dis
cuss the links between the pressure
to be happy and the in-depth study
of the humanities. Email her with
