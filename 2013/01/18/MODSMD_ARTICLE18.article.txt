# AWARDS
## season WHAT THE GOLDEN GLOBES MEAN FOR THE OSCARS 
### Lauren Wilson | MANAGING EDITOR 
For the first time in a while, it seems like
the Golden Globes has a chance to shift
the tide in the Best Picture Oscar race.
Historically, the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association's big show has served, at best, as
an indicator for which film currently carried
the most momentum and, at worst, as a glitzy,
booze-fueled kick-off to awards season. Let's
just say at this point, Ben Affleck's directing
snub could be the best thing to happen to
"Argo's" chances for Best Picture.
As a side note: I'll only be focusing on
film since the Emmys are a long ways away
and my abysmal three-out-of-seven Golden
Globe TV predictions means I should proba
bly stick to movies (11 out of 13, woo!).
Best Motion Picture
Comedy/Musical winner: "Les Miserables"
Drama winner: "Argo"
"Lincoln" carried the brunt of the Best
Picture momentum coming into the
Globes, but "Argo's" Best Drama and
Director wins could very well shake the
prestige drama's chances at Oscar gold.
There's still chatter over Affleck's surprise
omission from the Oscar's directing catego
ry, so the political thriller could go for the
Best Picture gold as compensation. Had the
snafu not occurred, this could still easily be
Honest Abe's game. "Argo's" win would've
simply been the HFPA succumbing to the
glamour of its international, Hollywood
centric plot (especially compared to boring,
old American history). This is the
Press Association,
after all.
Meanwhile, "Life of Pi" appears to
have become the maid of honor in this race
widely admired but firmly settled in as
this year's second-choice selection. Ah, Ang
Lee: always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
Best Actress
Comedy/Musical winner: Jennifer
Lawrence, "Silver Linings Playbook"
Drama winner: Jessica Chastain, "Zero
Dark Thirty"
This is shaping up to be the hardest
to-call race of the season. A fun "the more
you know" fact: this year's Best Actress race
features the oldest nominee ever (Riva for
"Amour") and youngest (Wallis for "Beasts
of the Southern Wild," bumping Lawrence
to third-youngest nominee for "Winter's
Bone" two years ago). The Globes awarded
Lawrence for Comedy/Musical and
Chastain for Drama, with Watts languish
ing at a distant second for the Thai tsunami
disaster flick "The Impossible."
By separating the two frontrunners
into different categories, there's no real way
to determine who emerged on top. Each
already has one previous Oscar nom under
her belt (Chastain received a supporting
nod last year for "The Help"). Lawrence has
quite a following from her cred on the
indie film circuit as well as for her popular
turns in "The Hunger Games" and "X-
Men" reboot. The Oscars may shy away
from "Zero Dark Thirty" due to controver
sy. Remember, the Academy is notoriously
allergic to any kind of edginess check
their decision to award Best Picture to
"Crash" over "Brokeback Mountain" in
2005 and "The King's Speech" over "The

Social Network" in 2010. Both years' losers
had previously snagged Golden Globes for
Best Drama. However, they may offer "Zero
Dark Thirty" some consolation with Oscar
gold for leading lady Chastain.
Best Actor
Comedy/Musical winner: Hugh Jackman,
"Les Miserables"
Drama winner: Daniel Day-Lewis,
"Lincoln"
I mean, any nominee whose name isn't
Daniel Day-Lewis shouldn't even bother
showing up come February 26.1 haven't
seen a Best Actor race this locked down
since the last time Day-Lewis won, back in
2007 for "There Will Be Blood." He and
"Amour" for Best Foreign Language Film
category are the surest things this year.
Best Director
Golden Globe winner: Ben Affleck, "Argo"
With the highest-profile contenders
out of the running (Affleck, along with pre
vious winners Tom Hooper and Kathryn
Bigelow), it'll be interesting to see who
steps out as a frontrunner. Quvenzhane
Wallis may be the youngest Best Actress
nominee ever, but some dispute that at that
young an age (Wallis was only six years old
during shooting), it's more about charisma
rather than talent, alleging that her nomi
nated performance is largely thanks to a
good director. However, "Beast's" Zeitlin
should probably just be grateful for being
included. Critics lauded "Life of Pi's" Lee
for filming an "unfilmable" movie, while
Spielberg is probably the biggest name in
directing, like, ever. I'll wait until the
Directors Guild Awards, but this could boil
down to a faceoff between Lee and
Spielberg.
Best Supporting Actress
Golden Globe winner: Anne Hathaway,
"Les Miserables"
Hathaway smartly played it humble
during her Golden Globes acceptance
speech. No one likes an arrogant winner.
Then again, Melissa Leo managed to pull
off a supporting win for "The Fighter" two
years ago despite running those ludicrous
vanity ads (she published glossy glamour
shots of herself, asking voters to "Consider"
her). That aside, if Hathaway doesn't make
a major blunder between now and
February 26, sweet Oscar gold will almost
certainly be hers.
Best Supporting Actor
Golden Globe winner: Christoph Waltz,
"Django Unchained"
This is the one major movie category I
gaffed on. I figured the HFPA would be
seduced by a superstar like DiCaprio.
They've always been big suckers for celebri
ty recall Angelina Jolie and Johnny
Depp's acting nods for "The Tourist."
Anyways, Waltz has momentum now, but
this category is packed with pretty strong
contenders. At this point, the only one I'd
count out is Arkin ("Argo").

nod last year for "The Help"). Lawrence has
quite a following from her cred on the
indie film circuit as well as for her popular
turns in "The Hunger Games" and "X-
Men" reboot. The Oscars may shy away
from "Zero Dark Thirty" due to controver
sy. Remember, the Academy is notoriously
allergic to any kind of edginess check
their decision to award Best Picture to
"Crash" over "Brokeback Mountain" in
2005 and "The King's Speech" over "The

Social Network" in 2010. Both years' losers
had previously snagged Golden Globes for
Best Drama. However, they may offer "Zero
Dark Thirty" some consolation with Oscar
gold for leading lady Chastain.
Best Actor
Comedy/Musical winner: Hugh Jackman,
"Les Miserables"
Drama winner: Daniel Day-Lewis,
"Lincoln"
I mean, any nominee whose name isn't
Daniel Day-Lewis shouldn't even bother
showing up come February 26.1 haven't
seen a Best Actor race this locked down
since the last time Day-Lewis won, back in
2007 for "There Will Be Blood." He and
"Amour" for Best Foreign Language Film
category are the surest things this year.
Best Director
Golden Globe winner: Ben Affleck, "Argo"
With the highest-profile contenders
out of the running (Affleck, along with pre
vious winners Tom Hooper and Kathryn
Bigelow), it'll be interesting to see who
steps out as a frontrunner. Quvenzhane
Wallis may be the youngest Best Actress
nominee ever, but some dispute that at that
young an age (Wallis was only six years old
during shooting), it's more about charisma
rather than talent, alleging that her nomi
nated performance is largely thanks to a
good director. However, "Beast's" Zeitlin
should probably just be grateful for being
included. Critics lauded "Life of Pi's" Lee
for filming an "unfilmable" movie, while
Spielberg is probably the biggest name in
directing, like, ever. I'll wait until the
Directors Guild Awards, but this could boil
down to a faceoff between Lee and
Spielberg.
Best Supporting Actress
Golden Globe winner: Anne Hathaway,
"Les Miserables"
Hathaway smartly played it humble
during her Golden Globes acceptance
speech. No one likes an arrogant winner.
Then again, Melissa Leo managed to pull
off a supporting win for "The Fighter" two
years ago despite running those ludicrous
vanity ads (she published glossy glamour
shots of herself, asking voters to "Consider"
her). That aside, if Hathaway doesn't make
a major blunder between now and
February 26, sweet Oscar gold will almost
certainly be hers.
Best Supporting Actor
Golden Globe winner: Christoph Waltz,
"Django Unchained"
This is the one major movie category I
gaffed on. I figured the HFPA would be
seduced by a superstar like DiCaprio.
They've always been big suckers for celebri
ty recall Angelina Jolie and Johnny
Depp's acting nods for "The Tourist."
Anyways, Waltz has momentum now, but
this category is packed with pretty strong
contenders. At this point, the only one I'd
count out is Arkin ("Argo").








For the first time in a while, it seems like
the Golden Globes has a chance to shift
the tide in the Best Picture Oscar race.
Historically, the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association's big show has served, at best, as
an indicator for which film currently carried
the most momentum and, at worst, as a glitzy,
booze-fueled kick-off to awards season. Let's
just say at this point, Ben Affleck's directing
snub could be the best thing to happen to
"Argo's" chances for Best Picture.
As a side note: I'll only be focusing on
film since the Emmys are a long ways away
and my abysmal three-out-of-seven Golden
Globe TV predictions means I should proba
bly stick to movies (11 out of 13, woo!).
Best Motion Picture
Comedy/Musical winner: "Les Miserables"
Drama winner: "Argo"
"Lincoln" carried the brunt of the Best
Picture momentum coming into the
Globes, but "Argo's" Best Drama and
Director wins could very well shake the
prestige drama's chances at Oscar gold.
There's still chatter over Affleck's surprise
omission from the Oscar's directing catego
ry, so the political thriller could go for the
Best Picture gold as compensation. Had the
snafu not occurred, this could still easily be
Honest Abe's game. "Argo's" win would've
simply been the HFPA succumbing to the
glamour of its international, Hollywood
centric plot (especially compared to boring,
old American history). This is the
Press Association,
after all.
Meanwhile, "Life of Pi" appears to
have become the maid of honor in this race
widely admired but firmly settled in as
this year's second-choice selection. Ah, Ang
Lee: always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
Best Actress
Comedy/Musical winner: Jennifer
Lawrence, "Silver Linings Playbook"
Drama winner: Jessica Chastain, "Zero
Dark Thirty"
This is shaping up to be the hardest
to-call race of the season. A fun "the more
you know" fact: this year's Best Actress race
features the oldest nominee ever (Riva for
"Amour") and youngest (Wallis for "Beasts
of the Southern Wild," bumping Lawrence
to third-youngest nominee for "Winter's
Bone" two years ago). The Globes awarded
Lawrence for Comedy/Musical and
Chastain for Drama, with Watts languish
ing at a distant second for the Thai tsunami
disaster flick "The Impossible."
By separating the two frontrunners
into different categories, there's no real way
to determine who emerged on top. Each
already has one previous Oscar nom under
her belt (Chastain received a supporting
nod last year for "The Help"). Lawrence has
quite a following from her cred on the
indie film circuit as well as for her popular
turns in "The Hunger Games" and "X-
Men" reboot. The Oscars may shy away
from "Zero Dark Thirty" due to controver
sy. Remember, the Academy is notoriously
