# THE
						TOP FIVE
## WORST THINGS ABOUT WINTER WEATHER 
### Tara McCullough DAILY FELLOW 
Been sitting in your room
wearing three pairs of socks
and a ski coat? We are suffer
ing together. Miserable weather
loves miserable company. Here are
the top five worst things about
January.
Clothes
Everyone always says the one good
thing about winter is the clothes.
This isn't even remotely true,
because no one sees the outfits. No
one wants to take off their warm
jackets, so that cute outfit you spent
so much time? Not appreciated.

(Boys, I know this is your number
one worry.)
Darkness
The shorter amount of daylight
does not induce happiness for any
one, especially because most of us
have classes during the few glorious
hours of sunlight. This means most
of us are just sitting inside on a
campus where we all LOVE being
active. It also makes it harder to get
a good run in outside although
many would consider that a good
thing.

Mornings
They become harder and harder. It
is so difficult to get out of bed
knowing that as soon as we move,
the cold will strike our bodies. For
me, this generally induces tears
because I hate the cold so much.
This just makes mornings that
much more dreadful.
Temperature
Well. It's a no-brainer. But it's cold.
We chose Stanford for a number of
reasons; generally one of them was
"that California sunshine." I find
myself repeating, "This is not what I

signed up for Stanford," as I whim
per when I walk outside.
Class
The number-one reason why winter
sucks definitely has to be those
morning bike rides. I know I have
made the mistake of leaving my
gloves in my room too many times,
leading to numb fingers. At the
same time, tears are slowly leaking
out of your eyes because of the crisp
morning. All the tourists must
think morning bikers are incredibly
sad to be going to class.
