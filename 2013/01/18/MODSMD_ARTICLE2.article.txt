"Stanford has certainly made its mark on the
world. You dominate the field. You tackle obstacles.
You reach your goals," said United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-Moon on TUesday to a full Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
'And that is just your football team."
Ban, who has headed the United Nations since
2007, named sustainable development, political libera
tion and youth and women's empowerment as key fac
tors during a time of global transition.
"The global change we face today is more profound
than in any period of my adult life," Ban said.
Citing the movement of economic power from West
to East, a push towards sustainability, and political
upheavals in the Arab world, Ban argued that we are
entering a period of historical transition.
"The changes we face are so profound that the
decisions we make today will have a deeper and more
lasting impact than any set of decisions in recent
decades."
Ban began his talk with the United Nations' most
critical functions. U.N. programs feed 90 million peo
ple a day, assist 33 million refugees and have 115,000
