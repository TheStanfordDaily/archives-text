"Stanford has certainly made its mark on the
world. You dominate the field. You tackle obstacles.
You reach your goals," said United Nations Secretary-
General Ban Ki-Moon on TUesday to a full Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
'And that is just your football team."
Ban, who has headed the United Nations since
2007, named sustainable development, political libera
tion and youth and women's empowerment as key fac
tors during a time of global transition.
"The global change we face today is more profound
than in any period of my adult life," Ban said.
Citing the movement of economic power from West
to East, a push towards sustainability, and political
upheavals in the Arab world, Ban argued that we are
entering a period of historical transition.
"The changes we face are so profound that the
decisions we make today will have a deeper and more
lasting impact than any set of decisions in recent
decades."
Ban began his talk with the United Nations' most
critical functions. U.N. programs feed 90 million peo
ple a day, assist 33 million refugees and have 115,000

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon discussed sustainable development, democracy and women's rights on Thursday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Presenting climate change as an example, he argued that today's problems demand multilateral solutions.
peacekeepers on four continents.
Ban also briefly discussed aspects of
his personal life.
"For me, it started here... in Novato,
where I stayed as a guest of the
Patterson family," he said. As an eight
een-year-old, in 1962, Ban traveled to the
United States as part of a Red Cross
effort. His host, Libba Patterson now
95 years old and in the audience at the
talk was witness to when Ban discov
ered his love of travel.
"My trip to the United States, five
decades ago, opened my eyes to the
world," Ban said. "I returned to Korea as
a different person. It was here that my
dream of public service took flight."
This path took him to the leadership
of the South Korea's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and then the United Nations. He
argued that the interconnectedness of
the world's problems mandated multilat
eral solutions.
Climate change, for example, has no
border or nationality, one in which "the
local becomes the global and the global
becomes the local," according to Ban.

"There can be no Plan B because
there is no planet B," he said. "Both sci
ence and economics tell us that we need
to change our course very soon."
He praised California as a pioneer in
legislation that reduces greenhouse gas
emissions through a market approach,
emphasizing that what is happening in
the Golden State could "spur progress in
the global negotiations on climate
change."
Thrning to what he called the "death
spiral" in Syria and the French-led inter
vention in Mali, Ban noted the high hur
dles to peace in those regions.
"Beyond Syria and the Sahel, we
must continue to work for peace, justice
and human rights throughout the Arab
world and beyond," he said. "Hard-won
gains must not be reversed, particularly
for all those women and young people on
the frontlines."
Calling women and youth the "most
underutilized resources in the world," he
urged the audience to promote these
groups in society.
"The world needs more women in
cabinet, more women in parliament and
more women in boardrooms, and at the
United Nations, we are leading by exam
ple," he said.
During his tenure as Secretary-
General, women's participation in high

level roles doubled compared to his pred
ecessor.
Ending on the topic of LGBT rights,
he cited the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights: "All human beings are
born free and equal in dignity and
rights."
"As one advocate at the United
Nations recently said, 'lf it's not equality
for all, it's not equality at all,'" Ban said.
He closed his speech optimistically,
talking about his passion for his job at
the United Nations.
"I still carry the same energy and
enthusiasm and sense of wonder when I
first landed on Mrs. Patterson's doorstep
half a century ago," he said.
"I begin my day, every day, every
morning, with the same commitment for
peace, the same passion and compas
sion," he continued. "What can I, as the
Secretary-General, what can the United
Nations do better and more for the many
people who are not fortunate around the
world?"
The event was co-sponsored by the
Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific
Research Center and the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International
Studies.
