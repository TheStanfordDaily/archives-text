# WE LIKE A CAPELLA
## TESTIMONY mixing faith, friendship and music 
### Rachel Mewes | Daily Fellow 
The last Testimony show was
just like any other a capella
performance on campus:
bright-eyed students wove together a
narrative with silly skits and intermit
tent songs, blending their voices to
create harmonious arrangements of
popular and traditional melodies.
The only major difference was that
one of the group members began by
leading the audience in prayer.
As the only Christian a capella
group on campus, Testimony fills a
specific niche, giving students with
various faith backgrounds and a love
for music a tightly knit community
that spans generations.
Founded in 1991 by a small
group of students looking for a space
where they could perform a capella
in a Christian context, Testimony has
since expanded in number, repertoire
and religious diversity.

In agreement with the name of
the group, Testimony has a tradition
with each show in which a member
shares a testimony about a personal
experience relating to his or her faith.
Director Alicia Triana 'l3 deliv
ered the testimony at the fall show,
sharing a personal story about how
her faith helped her pull through a
difficult period in her life.
"There's something that comes
out of the hardship that puts you in a
place where you're able to celebrate
and share it," Triana said. "Maybe
some people connected more than
others, but I'd feel glad if there was
one person in the room that it really
resonated for."
Despite its many traditions,
Testimony does not follow rigid
requirements when it comes to select
ing music. As long as the songs con
tain themes that align with Christian
doctrine, any genre is fair game.
"Within Christian music you'll
have Christian rock, Christian pop,
gospel, and so there's a huge variety
[when it comes to] the style of music,
but [there's more] homogeneity in
the content," said former Testimony
member Caroline Hernandez 'l5.
Despite being a Christian group
with a missionary purpose, Testimony
is open to people of all belief systems
and backgrounds and has welcomed
members that identify as atheist or
questioning.

"We don't discriminate during
auditions," said Triana. "We always ask
and make sure people are comfortable
with us being a Christian a capella
group."
Triana appreciates the unique
ness of each member of Testimony,
and in her opinion, each student
brings something indispensible to the
group.
"What I love about testimony is
that everyone is so different," Triana
said. "It's a very loving community
even though we're all super different."
Kate Mayer 'l5, Testimony's
financial officer, joined as a Christian
last year, but chose to distance herself
from her religion during spring quar
ter. She originally struggled with her
faith and found it difficult to express
her doubts to the members of a faith
based organization such as Testimony.
"When I first was transitioning
out of Christianity, it was difficult for
me," Mayer said. "While we're a
Christian group, we're not a fellow
ship group, in the sense that there's
[not] a lot of dedicated time to
encourage each other spiritually and
talk about issues of faith, so I felt like
there wasn't really a space to explain to
people what was going on with me."
However, when Mayer finally
found a time to come forward about
her experience, she was surprised to
find that she was not alone; two more
shared that they were not Christian.

"I found that very comforting to
know that I wasn't the only one," she
said.
Although Testimony is serious
about its music and Christian mes
sage, the social aspect is equally
important. In order to nourish indi
vidual bonds, the officers assign
"puddies," or "prayer buddies," each
week, and the pairs are meant to seek
each other out and spend some time
getting acquainted. Additionally, the
first week of winter break, Testimony
goes on tour together, performing at
churches, hospitals, schools and
events in regions ranging from
southern California to South
America.
The strength of the Testimony
community is apparent not just in
the closeness of the current members,
but also in the continued involve
ment of past members. According to
Mayer, alumni assist the busy under
graduates by figuring out arrange
ments for their chosen songs, and the
large number of alumni that joined
the singers on stage for the final song
during the winter show demonstrat
ed the lasting influence of Testimony,
even after graduation.
"Testimony has really given me
a family on campus," Triana said. "I
think when I leave here I can already
see that if I tried to [separate myself
from Testimony], there would be a
huge void in my life."
