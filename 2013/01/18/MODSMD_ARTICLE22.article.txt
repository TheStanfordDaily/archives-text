## Talk Dirty to-me Why communication with your partner is key 
### 
It was the last night of our quarter
abroad. The past 10 weeks had
been incredible, full of kangaroos
and Tim Tams and sexy accents. I had
an early flight to catch in the morn
ing. For now, I was back from the bars

and sharing my awkwardly narrow
dorm-room bed with an Australian
guy. A great guy, let me be clear; I'd
known him for a few weeks, and he
was funny and sweet and attractive.
Good dancer, good kisser.
Everything was fine until he
tried going down on me. Now, I have
a high pain tolerance, but I'd never
experienced anything quite like this. It
felt like a high-powered vacuum on
my clitoris. To this day, I think it
might be the worst pain I've ever
experienced. And I've had my fair
share of broken bones, concussions,
sprains, bruises and stitches. Brazilian
waxes have nothing on this guy's
tongue action. It was just terrible.
Did I tell him to take it easy?
Whoa there, Turbo, cool your jets?
No, I'm ashamed to say I didn't. I
squirmed and cringed for about fif
teen seconds until I couldn't take it
anymore, then pulled a "Why don't
we just kiss for a while? I'm not really
comfortable with oral!" Yes, I lied to
save his feelings. I just couldn't figure
out how to explain that his level of

suction was inflicting unimaginable
pain on my sensitive parts.
I understand how awkward it
can be to give someone tips in the
bedroom, especially when your part
ner isn't actively seeking guidance. But
if you do it right, communication
about sexual acts can make them so
much better! The trick is to keep it
positive, to give directions without
criticizing your partner. I wish I'd
mustered up the courage to just tell
the guy that I like my cunnilingus a
little gentler. There are ways I could've
phrased it that would have saved his
ego and maybe even helped him get
me off.
On the other side of things: be
open to suggestions! If your last part
ner loved one of your bedroom skills,
don't automatically assume it's going
to make your next partner hot. In my
own experience, Serious Boyfriend #1
and Serious Boyfriend #2 liked very
different things in the oral depart
ment. I have guy friends who wish
girls paid more attention to their testi
cles, and another friend who man
dates that girls to stay as far away
from them as possible. So ask ques
tions! Don't put your partner in the
awkward spot of wishing they could
give you tips.

How do I handle this? Once
things reach a certain level of intensi
ty, I say, "Hey, I take suggestions! Let
me know what you like." I want my
sexual partners to feel comfortable
telling me what feels good. Don't
worry about sounding like an ama
teur with this line you won't. If a
guy said it to me, I'd hear, "Hey, I'm
versatile. I want to make you feel
good. I can tailor my technique for
you!" I'd be beyond thrilled.
Sex gets better the more you get
to know someone's body and their
desires, so verbalizing these things can
only speed up the process. Just be
respectful of different tastes! As long
as your partner is mindful of your
boundaries, don't make him or her
feel weird for voicing certain desires.
The discussions you have with
your sexual partners can open up the
door to hot new positions, awesome
sex toys, tasty body toppings, sex in
cool places, and maybe even a three
some. Or maybe you just want to
mold your existing skills to each
other's tastes. Regardless of how tradi
tional or kinky your desires may be,
communication in the bedroom is the
key to getting what you want.
