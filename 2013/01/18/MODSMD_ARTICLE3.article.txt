night. Students can still apply for
Resident Tutor (RT), Resident
Computer Consultant (RCC) and
Peer Health Educator (PHE)

ties with a new online application
platform. Res Jobs, the old plat

However, further technical dif
ficulties precluded applicants
from selecting the substance-free
dorm as their house of interest.
These students were directed to
email their preference to the
house staff selection team,
according to a statement on the
Student Affairs website.
RCC manager Sherwin Smith
said that the technical difficulties
do not seem to have affected stu
dents' applications.
"We have not seen any notice
able effect on the application
process at this time," Smith said.

received by ResEd as of Jan. 16
was on par with the level of inter

Associate Dean of ResEd
Jennifer Calvert.

start Jan. 21 for applicants to
houses with Resident Fellows
(RFs) and run through Jan. 25.

house interviews for both RF
houses and Row houses will take
place Jan. 28 through March. 17.

said that the delayed deadline
gave her more time to finish her
application and gave her a better
chance to represent herself.
"There are so many complica
tions of having things done online
these days that I am used to
delays and small problems,"
Reidy said.
