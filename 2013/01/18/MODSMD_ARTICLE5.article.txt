## New manager leads revival of Stern Dining Poor reputation fading as food and atmosphere improve 
### JANA PERSKY 
As Stern Hall dining manager Tom
Skipworth walks past the dessert station, a
student intercepts him.
"Thank you for the food, man," the
Donner resident says, exchanging a fist
bump with Skipworth. "We had an awe
some weekend!"
Skipworth asks about the ski conditions
in Tahoe, checking to make sure that
everyone was well fed on the dorm's ski
trip weekend. After chatting with the stu
dent for a few more minutes, Skipworth
notices that the burrito line is backing up
and excuses himself to start serving gua
camole.
Stern Dining's reputation has improved
dramatically among students this year
compared to previous years and Skipworth
is a huge part of that, bringing better qual
ity food and a new staff to the hall.
"A lot of my senior friends will come
from other dining halls to eat at Stern,
which has never happened before," said
Calah Hanson 'l3, a three-year Casa
Zapata resident. "In the
past, usually it was people
leaving Stern and going to
other dining halls."
Stern residents, includ
ing Casa Zapata Resident
Fellow (RF) Chris Gonzales
Clarke, cited the new staff as
the biggest reason for
change in Stern's reputation.
"Most of the cooking
staff and the people that I
know have always been
super conscientious and
really good, but sometimes
the management hasn't
always matched that,"
Clarke said. "Now it seems
to be a good team."
Skipworth and Chef de
Cuisine Manuel Gallardo
were hired by Stanford
Dining to work in Stern
before the 2012-13 school
year began.
Clarke said that early in
the year, Skipworth and his
staff made an extra effort to
show students new offerings
and bring them food to taste.
Other students commented
that staff members would
often greet them by name
and ask about their day,
improving the entire dining
hall experience.
"Tom [Skipworth] does a
really good job of customer
service," Vijay Singh 'l6
said. "He always checks in
on how the food is."
Zoe Wolford 'l4, resident

assistant (RA) in Serra, said
that she has enjoyed work
ing closely with Skipworth
and Stern hospitality man
ager Saul Cardenas, espe
cially to plan an authentic
Southern-style tailgate
before a football game this
fall.

"Tom said that he would
personally prepare all the
food for me, make mashed
potatoes up to my standards,
make sure the fried chicken
was cooked in a southern
fashion and even make sweet
tea better than mine,"
Wolford said. "Tom and the
Stern dining staff prepared
all of our food and had it
ready for our tailgate at 10 in
the morning. It was deli
cious."
With improved customer
service came improved meal
quality.
Laura Pulido 'l3, peer
health educator (PHE) at
Casa Zapata, said that Stern
used to be known as the din
ing hall "where they serve
food to massive amounts of
people and don't really pay
attention to quality."
"I never thought it was
that bad, but it has definitely
improved," she added.
According to surveyed
students, both the food and
the atmosphere have
improved at Stern this year.
Stern residents particularly
enjoy Cardinal Sage, the
Latin American and
Mexican food station that
serves burritos. Other popu
lar options include the
breakfast offerings and the

sandwich station.
"I had heard that the
Stern dining hall was really
bad, probably one of the
worst ones on campus," said
Burbank resident Tammy
Chin Loy 'l6. "But I eat
breakfast here every single
day, and the breakfast is
amazing."
Clarke noticed celebrity
chef Mark Miller's influence
in updating the Latin
American and Mexican
offerings at Stern.
"The Latin American
types of food were always
good and always welcomed,"
Clarke said. "But after
[Miller] came, the dishes
became even more complex
and more interesting, and it
upped the quality quite a
bit."
Miller, founder of Coyote
Cafe in Santa Fe, partnered
with Stern Dining last year
to open Cardinal Sage.
According to student
reports, Stern's new reputa
tion has led to longer lines at
the dining hall. Residential
& Dining Enterprises did
not respond to a request for
the number of visits Stern
has received this year, but
surveyed students all agreed
that wait times were slowly
growing longer.
"More and more people
have been recognizing that
the food there is good, so
they want to come," Singh
said. "But tell anyone read
ing this to stay out of Stern!"

According to surveyed
students, both the food and
the atmosphere have
improved at Stern this year.
Stern residents particularly
enjoy Cardinal Sage, the
Latin American and
Mexican food station that
serves burritos. Other popu
lar options include the
breakfast offerings and the

sandwich station.
"I had heard that the
Stern dining hall was really
bad, probably one of the
worst ones on campus," said
Burbank resident Tammy
Chin Loy 'l6. "But I eat
breakfast here every single
day, and the breakfast is
amazing."
Clarke noticed celebrity
chef Mark Miller's influence
in updating the Latin
American and Mexican
offerings at Stern.
"The Latin American
types of food were always
good and always welcomed,"
Clarke said. "But after
[Miller] came, the dishes
became even more complex
and more interesting, and it
upped the quality quite a
bit."
Miller, founder of Coyote
Cafe in Santa Fe, partnered
with Stern Dining last year
to open Cardinal Sage.
According to student
reports, Stern's new reputa
tion has led to longer lines at
the dining hall. Residential
& Dining Enterprises did
not respond to a request for
the number of visits Stern
has received this year, but
surveyed students all agreed
that wait times were slowly
growing longer.
"More and more people
have been recognizing that
the food there is good, so
they want to come," Singh
said. "But tell anyone read
ing this to stay out of Stern!"
