## New manager leads revival of Stern Dining Poor reputation fading as food and atmosphere improve 
### JANA PERSKY 
As Stern Hall dining manager Tom
Skipworth walks past the dessert station, a
student intercepts him.
"Thank you for the food, man," the
Donner resident says, exchanging a fist
bump with Skipworth. "We had an awe
some weekend!"
Skipworth asks about the ski conditions
in Tahoe, checking to make sure that
everyone was well fed on the dorm's ski
trip weekend. After chatting with the stu
dent for a few more minutes, Skipworth
notices that the burrito line is backing up
and excuses himself to start serving gua
camole.
Stern Dining's reputation has improved
dramatically among students this year
compared to previous years and Skipworth
is a huge part of that, bringing better qual
ity food and a new staff to the hall.
"A lot of my senior friends will come
from other dining halls to eat at Stern,
which has never happened before," said
