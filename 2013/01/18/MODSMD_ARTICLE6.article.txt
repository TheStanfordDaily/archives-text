# CHASING DOWN THE PACK
## CAL VISITS THE FARM 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Reeling from a 1-3 start to con
ference play, Stanford men's basket
ball enters Saturday's rivalry game
against California trying to remain
relevant in the Pac-12.
Stanford (10-7, 1-3 Pac-12) and
California (10-6, 2-2) come in having
played the same conference sched
ule thus far. While California has a
better record, they have also been on
the losing end of two blowouts.
Stanford has been close in every
game, losing their three conference
games by an average of five points,
but has been unable to close out vic
tories.
"We have been competitive in
every single game," said head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "It's a matter of us
getting over the hump."
California's two conference loss
es have been by 14 and 15 points,
including a loss to Washington in
which they managed only 47 points.

The Golden Bears rely heavily on
their guard tandem of juniors Allen
Crabbe and Justin Cobbs, who have
accounted for half of the team's total
points this season.
Crabbe, a First Team All Pac-12
selection last year, is averaging 20.1
points per game. He leads the team
in 3-pointers made with 26 and is
shooting 35 percent from behind the
arc.
Cobbs has carried less of the
scoring load, averaging 14.9 ppg, but
he leads the team in both steals and
assists.
"Get used to it, fellas, it isn't
changing," said California head coach
Mike Montgomery of their style of
play.
Behind its guard-heavy offense,
California has underperformed this
season. A pre-season pick to finish
third in the Pac-12 after a NCAA
Tournament birth last year; they are
currently sixth.


LEIGH KINNEY/The Stanford Daily
Stanford has been buoyed recently by standout sophomore guard
Chasson Randle (above), who will look to get the Card back into the
Pac-12 title chase this weekend after two close losses last week.
They began the season
with a six-game winning
streak, but have lost six of 10
since, including three out of
them last five. Only once dur
ing that span have they won
back-to-back games.
"We told each other, we
gotta get serious if we want
to make a run at the Pac-12,
like we're capable of doing,"
said Crabbe after California's
67-54 victory over
Washington State last
Saturday. "We have all the
weapons that we need to be
successful. We all have to get
on the same page."
The home and away
records bode well for
Stanford, which has enjoyed
a 7-2 mark at Maples

Pavilion. California is a mere
2-2 in true away games,
although they are 3-0 at neu
tral sites.

Key players have hit their
stride of late for the Cardinal,
including sophomore
Chasson Randle, who has
scored in double-digits in
three straight games. Junior
Dwight Powell, a constant
force throughout this season,
is also hot of late with a four
game double-digit scoring
streak of his own.
He led the Cardinal with
19 points on 7-14 shooting
while grabbing five rebounds
against Washington last
weekend, and Randle added
16 points on 7-11 shooting in
28 minutes off the bench.
Randle, who has started all
but two games in his career,
did not start after arriving
late to shootaround.

Regardless of how the
stars play for Stanford

tomorrow, the Cardinal
needs to find away to keep
things together in the second
half and down the stretch if
the game is close. Against
Washington, both teams pro
duced identical shooting
marks in the first half, con
necting on 15-29 from the
field. But after the break,
Stanford was just 8-30 (26.7
percent), while Washington's
9-22 (40.9 percent) clip was
easily good enough to propel
the Huskies to victory.

Stanford's lone Pac-12 win
to this point came against
Washington State, which
California has also beaten.
Stanford and California have
both lost to Washington and
UCLA in Pac-12 play.
Stanford also lost to USC,
while California defeated
them 72-64.
