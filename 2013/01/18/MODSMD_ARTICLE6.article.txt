# CHASING DOWN THE PACK
## CAL VISITS THE FARM 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Reeling from a 1-3 start to con
ference play, Stanford men's basket
ball enters Saturday's rivalry game
against California trying to remain
relevant in the Pac-12.
Stanford (10-7, 1-3 Pac-12) and
California (10-6, 2-2) come in having
played the same conference sched
ule thus far. While California has a
better record, they have also been on
the losing end of two blowouts.
Stanford has been close in every
game, losing their three conference
games by an average of five points,
but has been unable to close out vic
tories.
"We have been competitive in
every single game," said head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "It's a matter of us
getting over the hump."
California's two conference loss
es have been by 14 and 15 points,
including a loss to Washington in
which they managed only 47 points.

The Golden Bears rely heavily on
their guard tandem of juniors Allen
Crabbe and Justin Cobbs, who have
accounted for half of the team's total
points this season.
Crabbe, a First Team All Pac-12
selection last year, is averaging 20.1
points per game. He leads the team
in 3-pointers made with 26 and is
shooting 35 percent from behind the
arc.
Cobbs has carried less of the
scoring load, averaging 14.9 ppg, but
he leads the team in both steals and
assists.
"Get used to it, fellas, it isn't
changing," said California head coach
Mike Montgomery of their style of
play.
Behind its guard-heavy offense,
California has underperformed this
season. A pre-season pick to finish
third in the Pac-12 after a NCAA
Tournament birth last year; they are
currently sixth.

Stanford has been buoyed recently by standout sophomore guard
Chasson Randle (above), who will look to get the Card back into the
Pac-12 title chase this weekend after two close losses last week.
