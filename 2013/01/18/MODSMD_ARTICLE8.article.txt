## Blandford earns top honor from the Royal Astronomical Society 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Kurt Chirbas 
Physics Professor Roger Blandford
received the British Royal Astronomical
Society's highest award, the Gold Medal, last
Friday. He joins an elite group of scientists,
which includes visionaries such as Albert
Einstein, Edwin Hubble and Stephen
Hawking.
The society can bestow up to two Gold
Medals each year: one recognizes achievement
in astronomy, the other achievement in geo
physics.
Blandford won this year's Gold Medal in
astronomy because of "his varied and inspira
tional contributions to theoretical astro
physics, as well as his service to the astro
physics research community at an internation
al level," according to the society's press
release. The release also called Blandford "the
outstanding all-round theoretical astrophysi

cist of his generation."
The Royal Academy Society cited his work
on relativistic astrophysics in the early stages
of his career, cosmic jets in 1970s and gravita
tional lensing today.
"Prof. Blandford has achieved an interna
tional reputation not only for his original
research, but also through the esteem in which
his advice is held," the society wrote.
Blandford serves as the director of Kavli
Institute of Particle Astrophysics and
Cosmology an independent lab at Stanford
that intends to serve as a bridge between the
disciplines of astrophysics, cosmology and
particle physics and as a professor at the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
"I am overwhelmed but delighted by this
quite unexpected recognition," Blandford said
in a SLAC press release. "It makes me realize
just how fortunate I am to be working at a
time of great discovery in astrophysics and
cosmology and to be grateful to my wonderful
teachers, collaborators and students."
