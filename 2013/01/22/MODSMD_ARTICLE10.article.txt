## The 						Stanford connection 
### Emily Cohodes 
Over winter break, I had a bit of
free time to file old documents
that were lying around the
Bridge Peer Counseling Center.
Looking through old teaching manu
als hand-written on yellowing paper
and sorting through old documents
about outdated protocols made me
think about just how repetitive our
time here at Stanford can seem in the
context of the thousands of alums
who have come through this universi
ty. How novel can our experience
here be when there are so many stu
dents that have done the same thing
before us? This realization, that I am
just one in a huge number to come
through Stanford, is particularly dis
turbing to me as my time here winds
down.
More and more lately, I'm stall
ing to realize what is perhaps simul
taneously the most frustrating and
invigorating thing about college
we run out of time. In the past few
weeks since coming back from winter
break and facing the daunting chal
lenge of selecting the second-to-last
set of courses of my college career, I
can't stop thinking about the fact that
I simply can't squeeze everything I
want to do here into the next few
months.
I'm just now figuring out who I
want to be on campus, how I want to
spend my time both inside and out
side of the classroom, and how I can
most effectively give back to the
Stanford community. And now, now
that I'm back from abroad, done
exploring majors and minors, testing
the waters of student groups, and
I've have settled into my niche, it's
time to start thinking about apart
ment hunting, graduate school, job
applications and moving on. From
both personal reflection and conver
sations with friends, it seems to take
about three years to really figure
things out at college, to make the
right friends, find a good adviser,
become entrenched in projects that
are both challenging and exciting,
and really start to call Stanford
home.
I'm frustrated that I couldn't have
started out here with the knowledge
and inspiration that I now have to

make changes I'm just now realizing
I have the power to make. I'm sad
that I will graduate and leave dozens
of projects related to mental health
unexplored, research questions
unanswered and experiences left
undone. In the last few weeks, I've
found myself returning home to my
dorm room, stymied by all the lost
opportunities that will surround our
graduation especially since the
Class of 2013 won't be able to use the
knowledge learned from our time
here to make great changes now that
we are finally in the perfect position
to do so.

I'm also inspired by this same
dilemma, though, because realizing
how many things I would do now if I
have the time makes me realize how
much we've all grown since freshman
year when we listened to the convo
cation speaker on the Quad, nervous
with excitement and startled by the
seemingly unlimited pathways that
lay before us before we even set
foot in a classroom.

I'm now more than ever starting
to understand what connects so
many alumni back to their alma
mater. Although we may not realize
it, we are all connected to those that
came before use, the people whose
names we may never know who
started the projects that we work on
today. Although I'm sad to be passing
off the reins of my life at Stanford to
an incoming freshman in just a few
short months, I realize that this is a
move characterized by great oppor
tunity for both of us. We'll all take
what we've learned to do on the
rather small scale of a college cam
pus and apply it to new communities
and populations, all the while remem
bering where these seeds were plant
ed.
One day, maybe two, five, or even
20 years down the road, some future
Bridge peer counselor will find my
files and documents tucked away and
might have the same realization â€”
that we are all connected in our serv
ice to the Stanford community while
we're lucky enough to be a part of it.
