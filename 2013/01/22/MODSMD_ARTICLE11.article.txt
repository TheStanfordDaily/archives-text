# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## The 						Internet is serious business 
### Chris Herries 
One of my favorite movies is
Clooney's Good Night, and
Good Luck (2005). It's the
story of how Edward R. Murrow, a
famous CBS reporter, took on rabid
ly anti-communist Senator Joseph
McCarthy in the 1950s and ultimate
ly facilitated McCarthy's downfall.
I was particularly struck by the
way the filmmakers used one of Mur
row's speeches. They open with the
first part of Murrow's 1958 speech,
cut to the body of the movie, and
close with the rest of the speech. In
that speech, Murrow outlines the fall
of television networks due in part to
greed, corruption and a quest for rat
ings: "And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now, and
there should be preserved the kine
scopes for one week of all three net
works, they will there find recorded
in black and white, or color, evidence
of decadence, escapism and insula
tion from the realities of the world in
which we live."
He bemoaned the abuse of televi
sion in 1958! I can only imagine how
much rolling he's done in his grave.
Murrow knew that the television
was an important invention, and
could be used to inspire and illumi
nate, instead of indulge and insulate.
We know today that the power of tel
evision pales in comparison to the
Internet, perhaps humanity's great
est invention thus far. But one essen
tial question remains the same: Do
you use the Internet to inspire and
illuminate, or indulge and insulate?
I imagine we use the Internet,
like we use many things, for both
good and bad purposes. Next to the
latest picture of a cat on a keyboard,
you may have a news article open. Or
maybe the tab over from a Youßibe
video is Stanford's library catalog,
ready to assist you in your next
paper. Maybe you use Facebook to
both monitor the activities of
acquaintances and as a facilitator for
events and hangouts with the impor
tant people in your life.
There are those who occupy the
extreme ends of Internet usage.
Some commit absurd amounts of
time to memes, blogs or forums that
at their best facilitate idleness and at
their worst perpetuate moral decay
and indecency (I'm looking at you,
denizens of/b/).
Others occupy the opposing end

of that spectrum. I'm as prone to fol
ly as anyone, but I try, generally, to
use my time on the Internet as pro
ductively as possible. My Twitter
feed follows my favorite magazines
and educational journals. That way,
all my news accrues in one place so I
can log on and start reading various
sources and perspectives. I'll use my
Facebook account to post articles
and link up with friends and acquain
tances. iUxnes has allowed me to sub
scribe to interesting podcasts about
the world.
When I meet a new person, I use
Google to learn more about their
interests. For example, I don't know
anything about ballet, but when I
met a dancer I went home and did a
little more research so I could better
understand her life.
Unfortunately, I feel most people
don't try to use the Internet in this
way. Many, rather than using the
Internet to expand their horizons, use
it to insulate themselves from the
world. They only occupy those cor
ners of the web that bring comfort or
entertainment. There's nothing
wrong with entertainment. We all
want to be entertained. But we should
all think critically about what enter
tains us. When you're bored, that's
the time to be learning a new skill or
perfecting old ones. That's when you
should learn chess or pick up a guitar.
Free time is when you should go for a
walk, contemplate life, drink with
friends or hit the gym. Our time on
Earth is admittedly limited. We
should spend that time making the
world a better place, not gawking at
the latest nut-shot Youlbbe video.
Murrow concluded his speech by
saying, "This instrument can teach,
it can illuminate; yes, and it can even
inspire. But it can do so only to the
extent that humans are determined
to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is
merely wires and lights in a box.
There is a great and perhaps decisive
battle to be fought against ignorance,
intolerance and indifference. This
weapon of television could be useful."
A tool is only as good as its crafts
men, and the Internet is just that: a
tool.
How are you using it?

more thing: contacting Chris at her

the time to be learning a new skill or
perfecting old ones. That's when you
should learn chess or pick up a guitar.
Free time is when you should go for a
walk, contemplate life, drink with
friends or hit the gym. Our time on
Earth is admittedly limited. We
should spend that time making the
world a better place, not gawking at
the latest nut-shot Youlbbe video.
Murrow concluded his speech by
saying, "This instrument can teach,
it can illuminate; yes, and it can even
inspire. But it can do so only to the
extent that humans are determined
to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is
merely wires and lights in a box.
There is a great and perhaps decisive
battle to be fought against ignorance,
intolerance and indifference. This
weapon of television could be useful."
A tool is only as good as its crafts
men, and the Internet is just that: a
tool.
How are you using it?
