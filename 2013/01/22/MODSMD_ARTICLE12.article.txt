# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## American cinema and the war on terror 
### Miles Unterreiner 
a A 7™ know that day you once
Y told me about, when Gotham
.1. would no longer need Bat
man?" asks Christian Bale's Bruce
Wayne in 2008's The Dark Knight.
"Bruce, you can't ask me to wait for
that," replies love interest Rachel
Dawes.
"It's happening ncnvT insists Mr.
Wayne; "Gotham needs a hero with a
face."
Duily great films, like great novels,
reflect the anxieties of the time in which
they are produced. Like the residents
of Gotham, menaced by enemies they
cannot see and do not understand, the
American people long for public heroes,
for white knights. But as in Gotham, the
nature of our enemies has proven itself
more conducive to clandestine warfare
in shadows and alleyways, violence hid
den from view and tucked away in the
darkly inaccessible corners of a wilder
ness of mirrors.
We aren't ready for Harvey Dent.
Our heroes don't have faces.
Since September 11th, the realities
of asymmetric warfare—wars fought
by nation-states against non-state
artors —have radically redefined the
nature of armed combat. Advances in
weapons technology, particularly
explosives and chemical weapons,
have enabled small networks of well
equipped terrorists to inflict damage
immensely disproportional to their
numbers. One man armed with a can
ister of sarin gas, unsecured Soviet
nuclear material, or (perhaps most
frighteningly) an engineered super

virus now has the potential to kill thou
sands, if not millions, of his fellow
human beings. There are no longer
any clear lines of accountability and
redress: no red telephone to Moscow
over which we can voice our com
plaints and expect complaints in
return.

This is no longer a war led by sol
diers in clean-cut uniforms, advancing
neatly in formation against a clearly
defined enemy (We saw how well that
strategy worked in 2012's The Dark
Knight Rises, when Gotham PD's
entire police force marched off to fight
Bane's terrorist network and got
trapped for months in an under
ground prison as inescapable as the
mountains of Afghanistan). It's a war
in which Iranian nuclear scientists get
assassinated by motorcycle bomb,
nuclear centrifuges are disabled by
computer virus, and undercover intel
ligence operatives entrench them
selves in terrorist cells before thwart
ing their deadly machinations. And
most of all, it's a war of unidentified
men in black masks fighting by night,
keeping the rest of us safe while the
visible authorities disclaim responsibil
ity— and even promise to hunt them
down when they go too far.
Sound familiar?

Conservative pundit and film critic
Ross Douthat complained in 2008 that
American film studios had, in the after
math of 9/11, succumbed to a paralyz
ing paranoia reminiscent of the "cyni
cal, end-of-empire 705." Instead of duti
fully assembling a line of patriotic prop

aganda-fests replete with good old
fashioned foreigner-bashing, lamented
Douthat, Hollywood had consistently
churned out 70s-style anti-govern
ment, anti-corporate conspiracy
flicks that blamed secretive cabals
within America for the rise of ter
rorism. "The film industry's typical
take on geopolitics," contended
Douthat, "traces all the world's evils
to the machinations of a White Male
enemy at home." The Parallax
View and Three Days of the Con
dor had been resurrected as Shoot
er and Syjiana; The Manchuri
an Candidate made a Denzel-driv
en comeback re-centered in the Mid
dle East, but an international
weapons corporation replaced the
Communist Party as the film's chief vil
lain. "We expected John Wayne,"
bemoans Douthat; "we got Jason
Bourne instead."
To be fair to Mr. Douthat, Act of
Valor hadn't come out yet. But even
absent that particular piece of pro-
America agitprop, the auteurs of Bev
erly Hills have shown themselves per
fectly comfortable recreating—and
yes, endorsing the new and
unprecedented type of total war
necessitated by 9/11. Much as the anti
establishment message of Apoca
lypse Now and Dog Day After
noon eventually gave way to the
unabashed patriotism of Top Gun and
Red Dawn, so too has the anti-society

nihilism of Fight Club given
way to Captain America
(2011) and, well, a reconstituted
Red Dawn, featuring North
Koreans instead of Soviets this
time around and starring Chris
Hemsworth rather than Patrick
Swayze. In Captain America
and The Avengers, the fore
boding guys in black camo turn
out to be not subversive agents
of a corporate conspiracy but
well-intentioned representa
tives of 5.H.1.E.L.D., the pro
tective organization dedicated
to saving the world from exis
tential foreign threats.
If it's unfettered stars-and
stripes heroics Douthat and his
fellow conservatives are miss
ing, they need look no further
than Liam Neeson. In Taken
(2008), former CIA agent
Bryan Mills (Neeson) responds
to the kidnapping of his daugh
ter — a wholesome ingenue
abducted by ugly Eastern
European sex traffickers—by
rampaging solo across the conti
nent of Europe, wreaking
bloody revenge upon everyone
from effeminate Ifrench politi
cians to the film's ultimate vil
lain, a fantastically wealthy Ara
bian sheikh. In the course of his
revenge torn- a cathartic
release of tension for an audi
ence tired of whiny European
complaints about our human
rights record and hungry for an
enthusiastic endorsement of
unilateral American interven
tionism Neeson tortures a
baddie by tying him to an elec
trified chair' and leaving him to
fry in a windowless room that
looks freshly imported fi'om a
CIA black site.
In a half-hearted gesture to
the possibility that torture
might produce more enemies
than it kills, 2012's imaginative
ly-titled Taken 2 brings back
the vengeful families of the
Albanian Muslim gangsters
Neeson brutally offed in the
franchise's first installment.
"You killed our men... our
brothers... our* sons," threatens
bearded mob boss Murad, sug
gesting for a brief metaphorical
moment that continued Ameri
can violence overseas might
spike a never-ending down
ward spiral of retribution and
punishment. "I killed your sons
because they kidnapped my
daughter," explodes an
unapologetic Neeson —who
then proceeds to annihilate
everyone a second time before
happily reuniting with his fami
ly and going home. One won
ders what might happen in
Taken 3.
Occasionally the endorse
ment is less direct, reflected in
themes and motifs rather than
in-your-face montages of
exploding terrorists in turbans.
In this month's Gangster
Squad, LAPD sergeants
John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and
Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling)
go outside the restrictive con
fines of the law to take down
diabolical mob boss Mickey
Cohen. Reviving a long tradi
tion in American cinema (see
The Star Chamber and,
well, any superhero movie ever
made) of well-meaning figures
who subvert established fines
of authority and accountability
in then- pursuit of justice,
Brolin and Gosling lead an
elite assassination team
through the crime-ridden
streets of LA
"Leave these," commands
Brolin with a gesture at his
LAPD badge, "at home.
Nobody will ever know what
we've done." Secrecy is para
mount, and public recognition
unimportant, to these cloak
and-dagger upholders of the
law As Gosling prepares to
shotgun a prostrate criminal,
the gangster mumbles in

shock, "You can't shoot me
you're a cop."
"Not anymore," grins a
steely-eyed Gosling. BLAM.
Problem solved. The movie's
tagline: "To save the law, break
it."
Gangster Squad's unac
countable cops could just as
well be Zero Dark Thirty's
Seal Team 6: righteous execu
tors of justice in a messy, over
ly-complicated world that
needs cleaning up by hard men
with big guns and no sympa
thy What directors like ZDTs
Kathryn Bigelow and Gang
ster Squad's Ruben Fleisch
er have done is show us what
the good guys can really do
when their guns are liberated
from the cumbersome techni
calities of the law and the
moralistic eye of public scruti
ny.
Yet just as the film industry
has proven itself less explicitly
anti-American than conserva
tives fear, its more nuanced
representatives have shown
themselves capable of societal
self-reflection and guarded
self-criticism to an extent
liberals can appreciate. Holly
wood has adeptly restructured
an age-old literary leitmotif —
the hero who goes so danger
ously far in fighting evil that he
eventually becomes the evil
himself—to fit a contempo
rary cultural moment anxious
about the corrosive influence
of the deep state on American
life.
The Lord of the Rings
has its Boromir and Star
Wars has its Anakin Skywalk
er as surely as America has its
Abu Ghraibs and Guan
tanamos. "What would I do
without you?" hisses Heath
Ledger's Joker to Batman
during a violent interrogation
in which the masked vigilante
smashes the Joker's head into
a table and crushes his hand
under a gloved fist; "You... you
complete me." The Joker is
Batman's creation as much as
Batman is his; the morally
compromised hero and the
anarchic purveyor of chaos
each serve as the other's rai
son d'etre. Director Christo
pher Nolan, no acolyte of the
liberal orthodoxy, nonetheless
pays homage to the old Green
waldian argument that violent
counterterrorism, like any
other force, tends to produce
an equal and opposite reac
tion.
2012's Argo is similarly
subtle, embodying neither the
unblinkered jingoism of the
classic Middle Eastern
hostage flick nor the self-flag
ellating internal doubt so often
attributed to the weak-kneed
liberal media. Conservatives
who left the theater in disgust
after Argo's opening exordi
um, which contextualizes the
Islamic Revolution against
Operation Ajax and the ClA
orchestrated installation of the
brutally autocratic Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi, would have
missed out on just under two
hours of American ingenuity
triumphing over Iranian fun
damentalism, capped by the
inspiring image of returning
CIA hero Tony Mendez (direc
tor Ben Affleck) walking past a
white picket fence into a sub
urban home proudly bedecked
with fluttering American flag.
Argo takes the time to
understand the origins of anti-
Americanism but doesn't cave
when faced with it. In the
course of his quest to rescue
six innocent U.S. Embassy
employees trapped in revolu
tionary Tehran, Affleck's con
flicted yet persistent Mendez
confronts State Department
idiocy ("Or you could just send
in teaming wheels and meet
them at the border with
Gatorade," he responds to a
particularly harebrained
scheme involving bicycles and
the fflirkish border) with the
same understated tenacity with

which he faces down the beard
ed zealots of the Revolutionary
Guard. Confronted by a fanati
cal pro-censorship bureaucrat
in Iran's totalitarian Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance,
Mendez doesn't deliver a full
throated disquisition on Ameri
can rights and values; he listens
patiently nods, and calmly takes
the next step in getting his fel
low citizens home.
Affleck's pragmatic, ideolo
gy-less direction of Argo
reflects a new set of cinematic
values and strategies shaped
by the tide of cultural evolution
since 2001. Certain themes res
onate throughout the spectrum
of post-9/11 action filmogra
phy: The amorality of warfare
in an age of uncertainty; the
need to keep the American
public uninformed of the
actions that keep them safe,
lest they balk at those actions'
necessary dangers; the impor
tance of secrecy, shadows, and
unaccountability in fighting a
new kind of terrorist; the
essential lightness of the good
guys, even when they act
beyond the restrictions of law
and social convention and even
when they feel morally conflict
ed. Justice is quick, swift, and
clean: it's telling that the most
we see of national archenemy
Osama bin Laden in Zero
Dark Thirty is a hooked nose
protruding from the depths of a
body bag.
These new values are, of
course, both external influences
on, and manifestations ofj our
own extant beliefs. Hollywood
tells us what we should think as
often as it reinforces what we
already think, leads as often as
it follows, guides as often as it
reflects. It is American society's
lodestar as surely as it is our
vanity mirror.
The disjuncture here, of
course, is that, as the timeless
Alfiedo reminds us in Cinema
Paradiso, "Life isn't like in the
movies. Life is much harder." In
real life, there's collateral dam
age. In real life, there isn't
always a happy ending. In real
life, there are no credits to roll at
the perfect plot-driven moment.
The challenge today's audi
ences face, then, is recognizing
and grappling with the moral
dilemmas our best films inter
rogate while simultaneously
acknowledging those films'
idealization of a more complex
reality.
So, to dismissive law-and
order conservatives weaned on
skepticism and suspicious of the
silver screen, take a second look
at the popular culture you
thought you hated. And to
aspiring Hollywood liberals,
curb your enthusiasm: the films
you love and the politics you
hold dear may not mesh as
smoothly as you once hoped
they might.
"Some men," observes
Alfred (Michael Caine) in The
Dark Knight, "aren't looking
for anything logical, like money
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned, or negotiated with.
Some men just want to watch
the world burn."
Whether that enemy is the
Joker or A1 Qaeda, mob bosses
from the East Coast or terror
ists from the Eastern Hemi
sphere, it's faceless heroes who
are still fighting society's battles
today What Hollywood's better
director's are asking us is this:
are we ready for Harvey Dent?
Do we still need our' Dark
Knights? And if so, are we
morally okay with that?
At the conclusion of The
Dark Knight, Commissioner
Gordon explains to his young
son that Batman is "the hero
Gotham deserves, but not the
one it needs right now"
He had it backwards. The
Dark Knight may be the hero
Gotham needs right now—but
this ritv deserves better.
