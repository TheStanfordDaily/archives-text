# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## American cinema and the war on terror

a A 7™ know that day you once
Y told me about, when Gotham
.1. would no longer need Bat
man?" asks Christian Bale's Bruce
Wayne in 2008's The Dark Knight.
"Bruce, you can't ask me to wait for
that," replies love interest Rachel
Dawes.
"It's happening ncnvT insists Mr.
Wayne; "Gotham needs a hero with a
face."
Duily great films, like great novels,
reflect the anxieties of the time in which
they are produced. Like the residents
of Gotham, menaced by enemies they
cannot see and do not understand, the
American people long for public heroes,
for white knights. But as in Gotham, the
nature of our enemies has proven itself
more conducive to clandestine warfare
in shadows and alleyways, violence hid
den from view and tucked away in the
darkly inaccessible corners of a wilder
ness of mirrors.
We aren't ready for Harvey Dent.
Our heroes don't have faces.
Since September 11th, the realities
of asymmetric warfare—wars fought
by nation-states against non-state
artors —have radically redefined the
nature of armed combat. Advances in
weapons technology, particularly
explosives and chemical weapons,
have enabled small networks of well
equipped terrorists to inflict damage
immensely disproportional to their
numbers. One man armed with a can
ister of sarin gas, unsecured Soviet
nuclear material, or (perhaps most
frighteningly) an engineered super

virus now has the potential to kill thou
sands, if not millions, of his fellow
human beings. There are no longer
any clear lines of accountability and
redress: no red telephone to Moscow
over which we can voice our com
plaints and expect complaints in
return.

This is no longer a war led by sol
diers in clean-cut uniforms, advancing
neatly in formation against a clearly
defined enemy (We saw how well that
strategy worked in 2012's The Dark
Knight Rises, when Gotham PD's
entire police force marched off to fight
Bane's terrorist network and got
trapped for months in an under
ground prison as inescapable as the
mountains of Afghanistan). It's a war
in which Iranian nuclear scientists get
assassinated by motorcycle bomb,
nuclear centrifuges are disabled by
computer virus, and undercover intel
ligence operatives entrench them
selves in terrorist cells before thwart
ing their deadly machinations. And
most of all, it's a war of unidentified
men in black masks fighting by night,
keeping the rest of us safe while the
visible authorities disclaim responsibil
ity— and even promise to hunt them
down when they go too far.
Sound familiar?

Conservative pundit and film critic
Ross Douthat complained in 2008 that
American film studios had, in the after
math of 9/11, succumbed to a paralyz
ing paranoia reminiscent of the "cyni
cal, end-of-empire 705." Instead of duti
fully assembling a line of patriotic prop

aganda-fests replete with good old
fashioned foreigner-bashing, lamented
Douthat, Hollywood had consistently
churned out 70s-style anti-govern
ment, anti-corporate conspiracy
flicks that blamed secretive cabals
within America for the rise of ter
rorism. "The film industry's typical
take on geopolitics," contended
Douthat, "traces all the world's evils
to the machinations of a White Male
enemy at home." The Parallax
View and Three Days of the Con
dor had been resurrected as Shoot
er and Syjiana; The Manchuri
an Candidate made a Denzel-driv
en comeback re-centered in the Mid
dle East, but an international
weapons corporation replaced the
Communist Party as the film's chief vil
lain. "We expected John Wayne,"
bemoans Douthat; "we got Jason
Bourne instead."
To be fair to Mr. Douthat, Act of
Valor hadn't come out yet. But even
absent that particular piece of pro-
America agitprop, the auteurs of Bev
erly Hills have shown themselves per
fectly comfortable recreating—and
yes, endorsing the new and
unprecedented type of total war
necessitated by 9/11. Much as the anti
establishment message of Apoca
lypse Now and Dog Day After
noon eventually gave way to the
unabashed patriotism of Top Gun and
Red Dawn, so too has the anti-society
