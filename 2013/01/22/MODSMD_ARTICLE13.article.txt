# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Kristian in Cape Town 
### Davis Bailey 
Two weeks ago, I retraced the
path my ancestors took against
their will and made my way
across the Atlantic back to the Moth
erland.
I write now— and for the rest of
this volume from Cape Town,
South Africa. This is my second time
across the Atlantic, first time in the
Southern Hemisphere and first time
in Africa.
My first two weeks in Cape Town
have presented me with a series of
messy tensions that I'll have to navi
gate over the next few weeks and
months. The underlying themes to
this messiness are: 1) addressing
structural racism and class inequality
that exists in, around, and under the
sites of consumption and pleasure I
experience as a foreigner; and 2) deal
ing with shifting intersections of pow
er and privilege as I move around
Cape Town and interact within the
Stanford group. (While I am general
ly enjoying myself and have had some
great experiences already, I focus on
the critical for this column.)
Undergirding my experiences
have been class exclusion and
exploitation that largely play out
along lines of race and that are quite
apparent, yet only silently discussed
if at all. What does it mean when
wine tasting at vineyards, viewing cul
tural shows at a theater, or climbing
Table Mountain become quintessen
tially paid of my South African experi
ence an experience vastly different
than the life the majority of people
who live in the Western Cape have
access to?
Some more specific examples:
On my second night in the country,
I went to a jazz club down one of the
main streets in Cape Town with a
friend from the program. She and I
are both black Americans. Once we
got inside, we very quickly realized
that we were the only black people
who were not on staff at the club
(security, bartenders, hostess) and

the only non-white patrons in the

space.
I'd had a sense before coming that
we would encounter de facto segrega
tion, but to see it so explicitly was
unnerving. Our Americanness
seemed to be the quality that allowed
us to enter the space as consumers of
pleasure and to feel relatively wel
come. (The discomfort we felt as for
eigners may have masked the discom
fort we may have felt had we been
black Africans).
This experience of segregation has
been the norm and not the exception
during my leisure time in Cape Town.
Wherever I've gone either with
other black students or as part of the
larger program —we've always been
the only black or mixed race group in
restaurant, bars, etc. The only excep
tions have been among other interna
tionals or the elite of black South
Africans.
On our first Saturday, some of us
ventured to the Old Biscuit Mill, a
farmers market about two kilometers
from our house. This market allowed
for a more ethnically diverse clientele,
but everyone cleaning up after us was
black and working-class, and all the
ethnic minorities consuming goods
were very markedly yuppies. It's pos
sible that, dressed in a different way,
some of us may have been mistaken
for cleaners or "help."
And I'd learned from talking with
a Capetonian friend of a Stanford
friend that this biscuit mill has
brought with it gentrification that has
pushed out longstanding working
class and ethnic minority groups. This
process is similar to the gentrification
I've seen around the working-class
and ethnic minority community
where my mother grew up (Bush
wick, Brooklyn now witnessing the
invasion of white "hipsters" from the
one-and-only Williamsburg).
It's partially this phenomenon that
makes me uneasy about how to pro
ceed over the coming few weeks. Thlk-

ing with this same Capetonian Mend,
we discussed how the options seem
for us seem to be either go out and
halfheartedly participate in problem
atic spaces, or stay in.
Accessing blacker spaces could be
possible for me in townships, but my
Americanness brings with it similar
class privilege that operates in the city
center.
And this dilemma is another one
that I have struggled to deal with so
far.
I had thought that, being black,
interacting with black AMcans would
have been easier for me than for oth
er American students. And while I
have felt this to be the case at times,
my nationality and its implications
(being viewed as a tourist with more
wealth and/or opportunity) have ulti
mately been a boundary. While in the
U.S., I can and do perceive a certain
camaraderie with other black folks
(under a shared history and present
experience of oppression), as an
American in AMca my suffering is not
of the same degree as those I might
see around me. Empathy or fraterni
ty feels inaccessible and inappropri
ate.
This troubled me a lot when I first
encountered it: why should I then pay
the price of being American when my
ancestors had no choice in their
abduction and forcible transport to
America? Where can I call "home" if I
can never be welcome in the United
States (with black inhumanity and
enslavement as the fulcrum that sup
ported the dominance of Western cap
italism and imperialism) and can nev
er be welcome in the land where my
origins trace (with the Middle Pas
sage and my resulting Americanness
creating an irreversible rift from
AMca)?
I felt agitated and glum that there
would never be a place for me to feel
comfortable in this world.
