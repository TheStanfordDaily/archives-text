# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Kristian in Cape Town 
### Davis Bailey 
Two weeks ago, I retraced the
path my ancestors took against
their will and made my way
across the Atlantic back to the Moth
erland.
I write now— and for the rest of
this volume from Cape Town,
South Africa. This is my second time
across the Atlantic, first time in the
Southern Hemisphere and first time
in Africa.
My first two weeks in Cape Town
have presented me with a series of
messy tensions that I'll have to navi
gate over the next few weeks and
months. The underlying themes to
this messiness are: 1) addressing
structural racism and class inequality
that exists in, around, and under the
sites of consumption and pleasure I
experience as a foreigner; and 2) deal
ing with shifting intersections of pow
er and privilege as I move around
Cape Town and interact within the
Stanford group. (While I am general
ly enjoying myself and have had some
great experiences already, I focus on
the critical for this column.)
Undergirding my experiences
have been class exclusion and
exploitation that largely play out
along lines of race and that are quite
apparent, yet only silently discussed
if at all. What does it mean when
wine tasting at vineyards, viewing cul
tural shows at a theater, or climbing
Table Mountain become quintessen
tially paid of my South African experi
ence an experience vastly different
than the life the majority of people
who live in the Western Cape have
access to?
Some more specific examples:
On my second night in the country,
I went to a jazz club down one of the
main streets in Cape Town with a
friend from the program. She and I
are both black Americans. Once we
got inside, we very quickly realized
that we were the only black people
who were not on staff at the club
(security, bartenders, hostess) and

the only non-white patrons in the

space.
I'd had a sense before coming that
we would encounter de facto segrega
tion, but to see it so explicitly was
unnerving. Our Americanness
seemed to be the quality that allowed
us to enter the space as consumers of
pleasure and to feel relatively wel
come. (The discomfort we felt as for
eigners may have masked the discom
fort we may have felt had we been
black Africans).
This experience of segregation has
been the norm and not the exception
during my leisure time in Cape Town.
Wherever I've gone either with
other black students or as part of the
larger program —we've always been
the only black or mixed race group in
restaurant, bars, etc. The only excep
tions have been among other interna
tionals or the elite of black South
Africans.
On our first Saturday, some of us
ventured to the Old Biscuit Mill, a
farmers market about two kilometers
from our house. This market allowed
for a more ethnically diverse clientele,
but everyone cleaning up after us was
black and working-class, and all the
ethnic minorities consuming goods
were very markedly yuppies. It's pos
sible that, dressed in a different way,
some of us may have been mistaken
for cleaners or "help."
And I'd learned from talking with
a Capetonian friend of a Stanford
friend that this biscuit mill has
brought with it gentrification that has
pushed out longstanding working
class and ethnic minority groups. This
process is similar to the gentrification
I've seen around the working-class
and ethnic minority community
where my mother grew up (Bush
wick, Brooklyn now witnessing the
invasion of white "hipsters" from the
one-and-only Williamsburg).
It's partially this phenomenon that
makes me uneasy about how to pro
ceed over the coming few weeks. Thlk-

ing with this same Capetonian Mend,
we discussed how the options seem
for us seem to be either go out and
halfheartedly participate in problem
atic spaces, or stay in.
Accessing blacker spaces could be
possible for me in townships, but my
Americanness brings with it similar
class privilege that operates in the city
center.
And this dilemma is another one
that I have struggled to deal with so
far.
I had thought that, being black,
interacting with black AMcans would
have been easier for me than for oth
er American students. And while I
have felt this to be the case at times,
my nationality and its implications
(being viewed as a tourist with more
wealth and/or opportunity) have ulti
mately been a boundary. While in the
U.S., I can and do perceive a certain
camaraderie with other black folks
(under a shared history and present
experience of oppression), as an
American in AMca my suffering is not
of the same degree as those I might
see around me. Empathy or fraterni
ty feels inaccessible and inappropri
ate.
This troubled me a lot when I first
encountered it: why should I then pay
the price of being American when my
ancestors had no choice in their
abduction and forcible transport to
America? Where can I call "home" if I
can never be welcome in the United
States (with black inhumanity and
enslavement as the fulcrum that sup
ported the dominance of Western cap
italism and imperialism) and can nev
er be welcome in the land where my
origins trace (with the Middle Pas
sage and my resulting Americanness
creating an irreversible rift from
AMca)?
I felt agitated and glum that there
would never be a place for me to feel
comfortable in this world.
And beyond discomfort
with the structural implica
tions of pleasure here, another
reason I have less of an inter
est in going out during this
South African summer is
because of the frustration I've
felt trying to navigate bars
and clubs while being per
ceived as straight and having
to interact within hetero
based gender dynamics.
Exploration is more difficult
for me as (seemingly) the sole
queer-identified student in the
group, and I already know
that I'll find similar issue of
racial, class- and nationality
based segregation in whatever
gay spaces exist here.
So in the same way that I
have felt that I can never over
come the weight that history
has placed on American and
African blackness, I have also
felt defeatist about ever feeling
comfortable interacting in the
world as a queer person. 'Cool
ness' and masculinity—and
black masculinity in particular
—have felt like areas that I
will never My have access to.
(The terms of coolness here
seem to be set by interacting
within a heterosexual frame
work of relations both with
men and with women.)
The final large area of
messiness I'll note at this time
surrounds what constitutes
"safe" and "dangerous" spaces
in the neighborhood where we

live and take our classes.
Issues of nonviolent petty
crime do exist where we live,
but this neighborhood is very
solidly middle-class and these
crimes may occur no more or
no less than they would in any
urban setting that is known
for housing a significant West
ern student tourist population.
The correlation between
"sketchiness" and blackness
and non-middle class black
ness at that —is troubling,
especially given that the real
and worst of the violence in
the Western Cape exists in the
townships and is only experi
enced by Black and Coloured
Africans, the homeless, unem
ployed and underemployed.
For some in our group (pri
marily urban black students),
the conditions of "danger" in
our immediate environment
may be no more and no less
threatening than they are in
our home communities. This
may certainly be the case for
me, having grown up in the
predominantly black commu
nities of Jamaica, Queens.
Having grown up used to
hearing my communities or
neighboring ones perceived as
"threats" or called "sketchy"
areas, I know that the reality
of these issues exists, but
know to resist hyperbolic gen
eralizations.
My informal education at
home consisted of knowing
how and when to be aware of
my belongings and surround
ings and how not to stick out
and make myself a vulnerable
target in higher-risk areas.
Here, I know that my percep

tion of safety and threats to it
is colored by my experience of
race I may feel safer, or less
uncomfortable in certain con
texts than others who are not
black.
It's thrown me off to go
from a quarter in which I
began to define the frame
works through which I exam
ine the world, the terms of my
politics, and to discover the
people with whom I felt com
fortable discussing such topics
to a world in which I am com
pletely back to square one.
I don't feel as bleak about
these topics now I just
know that it will be more of a
challenge for me to find spaces
here where I feel comfortable
and can discuss such issues,
topics and ideas.
I am trying to figure out
how to be a foreigner without
being a tourist, and while mini
mizing the harmful effects my
American privilege might have.
I am trying to figure out where
to find allies on the issues I care
most about. I am wondering
whether it is possible to break
through the economic and
racial segregation around me
and start to build the cross
community relations and coali
tions that have come to sustain
me at Stanford. I think my
Americanness and the short
duration of my visit —not to
mention the immense structur
al inequality of this country—
will make answering this last
question a task in vain.

class and ethnic minority groups. This
process is similar to the gentrification
I've seen around the working-class
and ethnic minority community
where my mother grew up (Bush
wick, Brooklyn now witnessing the
invasion of white "hipsters" from the
one-and-only Williamsburg).
It's partially this phenomenon that
makes me uneasy about how to pro
ceed over the coming few weeks. Thlk-

ing with this same Capetonian Mend,
we discussed how the options seem
for us seem to be either go out and
halfheartedly participate in problem
atic spaces, or stay in.
Accessing blacker spaces could be
possible for me in townships, but my
Americanness brings with it similar
class privilege that operates in the city
center.
And this dilemma is another one
that I have struggled to deal with so
far.
I had thought that, being black,
interacting with black AMcans would
have been easier for me than for oth
er American students. And while I
have felt this to be the case at times,
my nationality and its implications
(being viewed as a tourist with more
wealth and/or opportunity) have ulti
mately been a boundary. While in the
U.S., I can and do perceive a certain
camaraderie with other black folks
(under a shared history and present
experience of oppression), as an
American in AMca my suffering is not
of the same degree as those I might
see around me. Empathy or fraterni
ty feels inaccessible and inappropri
ate.
This troubled me a lot when I first
encountered it: why should I then pay
the price of being American when my
ancestors had no choice in their
abduction and forcible transport to
America? Where can I call "home" if I
can never be welcome in the United
States (with black inhumanity and
enslavement as the fulcrum that sup
ported the dominance of Western cap
italism and imperialism) and can nev
er be welcome in the land where my
origins trace (with the Middle Pas
sage and my resulting Americanness
creating an irreversible rift from
AMca)?
I felt agitated and glum that there
would never be a place for me to feel
comfortable in this world.
And beyond discomfort
with the structural implica
tions of pleasure here, another
reason I have less of an inter
est in going out during this
South African summer is
because of the frustration I've
felt trying to navigate bars
and clubs while being per
ceived as straight and having
to interact within hetero
based gender dynamics.
Exploration is more difficult
for me as (seemingly) the sole
queer-identified student in the
group, and I already know
that I'll find similar issue of
racial, class- and nationality
based segregation in whatever
gay spaces exist here.
So in the same way that I
have felt that I can never over
come the weight that history
has placed on American and
African blackness, I have also
felt defeatist about ever feeling
comfortable interacting in the
world as a queer person. 'Cool
ness' and masculinity—and
black masculinity in particular
—have felt like areas that I
will never My have access to.
(The terms of coolness here
seem to be set by interacting
within a heterosexual frame
work of relations both with
men and with women.)
The final large area of
messiness I'll note at this time
surrounds what constitutes
"safe" and "dangerous" spaces
in the neighborhood where we

live and take our classes.
Issues of nonviolent petty
crime do exist where we live,
but this neighborhood is very
solidly middle-class and these
crimes may occur no more or
no less than they would in any
urban setting that is known
for housing a significant West
ern student tourist population.
The correlation between
"sketchiness" and blackness
and non-middle class black
ness at that —is troubling,
especially given that the real
and worst of the violence in
the Western Cape exists in the
townships and is only experi
enced by Black and Coloured
Africans, the homeless, unem
ployed and underemployed.
For some in our group (pri
marily urban black students),
the conditions of "danger" in
our immediate environment
may be no more and no less
threatening than they are in
our home communities. This
may certainly be the case for
me, having grown up in the
predominantly black commu
nities of Jamaica, Queens.
Having grown up used to
hearing my communities or
neighboring ones perceived as
"threats" or called "sketchy"
areas, I know that the reality
of these issues exists, but
know to resist hyperbolic gen
eralizations.
My informal education at
home consisted of knowing
how and when to be aware of
my belongings and surround
ings and how not to stick out
and make myself a vulnerable
target in higher-risk areas.
Here, I know that my percep

tion of safety and threats to it
is colored by my experience of
race I may feel safer, or less
uncomfortable in certain con
texts than others who are not
black.
It's thrown me off to go
from a quarter in which I
began to define the frame
works through which I exam
ine the world, the terms of my
politics, and to discover the
people with whom I felt com
fortable discussing such topics
to a world in which I am com
pletely back to square one.
I don't feel as bleak about
these topics now I just
know that it will be more of a
challenge for me to find spaces
here where I feel comfortable
and can discuss such issues,
topics and ideas.
I am trying to figure out
how to be a foreigner without
being a tourist, and while mini
mizing the harmful effects my
American privilege might have.
I am trying to figure out where
to find allies on the issues I care
most about. I am wondering
whether it is possible to break
through the economic and
racial segregation around me
and start to build the cross
community relations and coali
tions that have come to sustain
me at Stanford. I think my
Americanness and the short
duration of my visit —not to
mention the immense structur
al inequality of this country—
will make answering this last
question a task in vain.

Two weeks ago, I retraced the
path my ancestors took against
their will and made my way
across the Atlantic back to the Moth
erland.
I write now— and for the rest of
this volume from Cape Town,
South Africa. This is my second time
across the Atlantic, first time in the
Southern Hemisphere and first time
in Africa.
My first two weeks in Cape Town
have presented me with a series of
messy tensions that I'll have to navi
gate over the next few weeks and
months. The underlying themes to
this messiness are: 1) addressing
structural racism and class inequality
that exists in, around, and under the
sites of consumption and pleasure I
experience as a foreigner; and 2) deal
ing with shifting intersections of pow
er and privilege as I move around
Cape Town and interact within the
Stanford group. (While I am general
ly enjoying myself and have had some
great experiences already, I focus on
the critical for this column.)
Undergirding my experiences
have been class exclusion and
exploitation that largely play out
along lines of race and that are quite
apparent, yet only silently discussed
if at all. What does it mean when
wine tasting at vineyards, viewing cul
tural shows at a theater, or climbing
Table Mountain become quintessen
tially paid of my South African experi
ence an experience vastly different
than the life the majority of people
who live in the Western Cape have
access to?
Some more specific examples:
On my second night in the country,
I went to a jazz club down one of the
main streets in Cape Town with a
friend from the program. She and I
are both black Americans. Once we
got inside, we very quickly realized
that we were the only black people
who were not on staff at the club
(security, bartenders, hostess) and

the only non-white patrons in the

space.
I'd had a sense before coming that
we would encounter de facto segrega
tion, but to see it so explicitly was
unnerving. Our Americanness
seemed to be the quality that allowed
us to enter the space as consumers of
pleasure and to feel relatively wel
come. (The discomfort we felt as for
eigners may have masked the discom
fort we may have felt had we been
black Africans).
This experience of segregation has
been the norm and not the exception
during my leisure time in Cape Town.
Wherever I've gone either with
other black students or as part of the
larger program —we've always been
the only black or mixed race group in
restaurant, bars, etc. The only excep
tions have been among other interna
tionals or the elite of black South
Africans.
On our first Saturday, some of us
ventured to the Old Biscuit Mill, a
farmers market about two kilometers
from our house. This market allowed
for a more ethnically diverse clientele,
but everyone cleaning up after us was
black and working-class, and all the
ethnic minorities consuming goods
were very markedly yuppies. It's pos
sible that, dressed in a different way,
some of us may have been mistaken
for cleaners or "help."
And I'd learned from talking with
a Capetonian friend of a Stanford
friend that this biscuit mill has
brought with it gentrification that has
pushed out longstanding working
class and ethnic minority groups. This
process is similar to the gentrification
I've seen around the working-class
and ethnic minority community

messiness I'll note at this time
surrounds what constitutes
"safe" and "dangerous" spaces
in the neighborhood where we

live and take our classes.
Issues of nonviolent petty
crime do exist where we live,
but this neighborhood is very
solidly middle-class and these
crimes may occur no more or
no less than they would in any
urban setting that is known
for housing a significant West
ern student tourist population.
The correlation between
"sketchiness" and blackness
and non-middle class black
ness at that —is troubling,
especially given that the real
and worst of the violence in
the Western Cape exists in the
townships and is only experi
enced by Black and Coloured
Africans, the homeless, unem
ployed and underemployed.
For some in our group (pri
marily urban black students),
the conditions of "danger" in
our immediate environment
may be no more and no less
threatening than they are in
our home communities. This
may certainly be the case for
me, having grown up in the
predominantly black commu
nities of Jamaica, Queens.
Having grown up used to
hearing my communities or
neighboring ones perceived as
"threats" or called "sketchy"
areas, I know that the reality
of these issues exists, but
know to resist hyperbolic gen
eralizations.
My informal education at
home consisted of knowing
how and when to be aware of
my belongings and surround
ings and how not to stick out
and make myself a vulnerable
target in higher-risk areas.
Here, I know that my percep

tion of safety and threats to it
is colored by my experience of
race I may feel safer, or less
uncomfortable in certain con
texts than others who are not
black.
It's thrown me off to go
from a quarter in which I
began to define the frame
works through which I exam
ine the world, the terms of my
politics, and to discover the
people with whom I felt com
fortable discussing such topics
to a world in which I am com
pletely back to square one.
I don't feel as bleak about
these topics now I just
know that it will be more of a
challenge for me to find spaces
here where I feel comfortable
and can discuss such issues,
topics and ideas.
I am trying to figure out
how to be a foreigner without
being a tourist, and while mini
mizing the harmful effects my
American privilege might have.
I am trying to figure out where
to find allies on the issues I care
most about. I am wondering
whether it is possible to break
through the economic and
racial segregation around me
and start to build the cross
community relations and coali
tions that have come to sustain
me at Stanford. I think my
Americanness and the short
duration of my visit —not to
mention the immense structur
al inequality of this country—
will make answering this last
question a task in vain.
