## GAGE GOES OFF CAL CAN'T KEEP PACE 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
In desperate need of a victo
ry, Stanford cooked up the win
ning recipe of strong defense
and balanced scoring in a 69-59
win over California at Maples
Pavilion on Saturday afternoon.

In a game where both teams
shot under 40 percent from the
field, Stanford's free-throw
shooting and bench production
made the difference. Junior for
ward Dwight Powell scored a
game-high 17 points despite
going 4-of-12 from the floor,
Stanford made 25 of its 31 free
throws, and the Cardinal (11-7,
2-3) bench outscored its counter
parts from Cal (10-7, 2-3) by 23
points, 26-3.
"I think for us, we just came
out with a defensive-minded
game and tried to just be as
tough as we could and make the
little plays down the stretch and
just try to stop them," Powell
said.
The rivals are now tied for
seventh in the Pac-12, while Stan
ford improved to 8-2 at home.
Junior John Gage led the
bench with a career-high 14
points, going 4-4 from three
point range. Freshman Roscoe
Allen was also aggressive and
productive off the bench, finish
ing with seven rebounds and six
points.

Thanks to some hot shooting from junior John Gage (40), Stanford earned its second conference win of the
season. Gage hit all four of his three-pointers and scored a career-high 14 as the Card beat rival Cal.
what was the senior forward's fourth
start of the season, Stanford was able
limit Crabbe's touches and disrupt his
rhythm.
"I was really proud of how we
defended him," said head coach John
ny Dawkins. "Even shots he made,
they were challenged shots earlier in
the game."
Cal's David Kravish scored 10 of
his 14 points in the first half, keeping
the California offense afloat as Crabbe
and their second-leading scorer Justin
Cobbs managed only two points each
in the period. Cobbs finished the game
with 13 points and six assists.
"They tag me on screens, don't let
me get anything easy," Crabbe said.
"They did a good job in the first half, I
guess."
Chasson Randle scored 15 points
for Stanford, giving the Cardinal
three players in double digits. He is
averaging 16 points per game over the
last four games, all of which have been
in the Pac-12.
Josh Heustis had another produc
tive all-around game with 12 rebounds
including six offensive nine
points and two blocks.
Still, Dawkins thinks Heustis has
room to grow as he shoulders more of
the offensive load.
"What I hope for Josh is that he
understands how he can be successful
offensively. Josh is a guy, he's a terrif
ic offensive rebounder, he can score
around the basket, he's a capable open
shooter," said Dawkins.
Stanford trailed early, but first
took the lead almost 13 minutes into
the game on a three-pointer by Gage.
That jumper came in the midst of a 13-
2 run by Stanford late in the first half.
Trailing 37-29 at halftime, Califor
nia came within one point at 43-42
with 13:29 left to play, but they could
never regain the lead.
Stanford's free-throw shooting was
critical in the second half, as they con
verted 15-of-17 times from the free
throw line to maintain a comfortable
lead. Powell and Gabriel Harris were
perfect from the line in the half, with
Powell going 7-of-7 and Harris 4-of-4,
while Heustis was 3-of-4.
"I thought our kids did a good job
to play with some aggression,"
Dawkins said. "We attacked the bas
ket well, got the ball inside, and put
ourselves in position to be fouled, and
thought that worked out well for us."
