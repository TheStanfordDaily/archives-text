## GAGE GOES OFF CAL CAN'T KEEP PACE 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
In desperate need of a victo
ry, Stanford cooked up the win
ning recipe of strong defense
and balanced scoring in a 69-59
win over California at Maples
Pavilion on Saturday afternoon.

In a game where both teams
shot under 40 percent from the
field, Stanford's free-throw
shooting and bench production
made the difference. Junior for
ward Dwight Powell scored a
game-high 17 points despite
going 4-of-12 from the floor,
Stanford made 25 of its 31 free
throws, and the Cardinal (11-7,
2-3) bench outscored its counter
parts from Cal (10-7, 2-3) by 23
points, 26-3.
"I think for us, we just came
out with a defensive-minded
game and tried to just be as
tough as we could and make the
little plays down the stretch and
just try to stop them," Powell
said.
The rivals are now tied for
seventh in the Pac-12, while Stan
ford improved to 8-2 at home.
Junior John Gage led the
bench with a career-high 14
points, going 4-4 from three
point range. Freshman Roscoe
Allen was also aggressive and
productive off the bench, finish
ing with seven rebounds and six
points.
California's leading scorer
Allen Crabbe was held to 14
points on 6-of-13 shooting. With
