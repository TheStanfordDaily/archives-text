## WEEKEND SWEEP PUTS CARD BACK IN FIRST 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
With wins against UCLA and USC over the
weekend, Stanford women's basketball is back on
top of the Pac-12 Conference, moving back into a
first-place tie with California. The Card (16-2, 5-1
Pac-12) handily beat the Bruins (13-4, 4-2) Friday

night 75-49 to provide the team with a much needed
boost in morale after losing to Cal. A narrow victo
ry over USC (7-10, 4-2) on Sunday was the icing on
the cake for the Card, as it took down the Trojans
75-66 at Maples.
