### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
With wins against UCLA and USC over the
weekend, Stanford women's basketball is back on
top of the Pac-12 Conference, moving back into a
first-place tie with California. The Card (16-2, 5-1
Pac-12) handily beat the Bruins (13-4, 4-2) Friday

night 75-49 to provide the team with a much needed
boost in morale after losing to Cal. A narrow victo
ry over USC (7-10, 4-2) on Sunday was the icing on
the cake for the Card, as it took down the Trojans
75-66 at Maples.

Battling through a foot injury, senior Joselyn Tinkle (44) regained her shooting stroke with 31 points
in two wins over the weekend, an encouraging sign for Stanford's postseason aspirations.
Against UCLA, junior
forward Chiney Ogwumike
recorded 25 points and 13
rebounds. The Card saw
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
rediscover her groove, fin
ishing the game with 16
points while hitting all four
of her shots from behind the
three-point line. Sophomore
point guard Amber Orrange
had another solid perform
ance with 15 points, and jun
ior guard Toni Kokenis had a
team-high six assists as she
reasserted her offensive
presence after not feeling
well for most of the season.
"This was a really big win
for us," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "UCLA is a
top-ranked team. They're
big, they're physical, they're
athletic. I was really proud
of how our team battled. I
think we just saw our team
learn from our last game and
I was really excited about
that."
The Card succeeded in
holding UCLA's top scorer
and rebounder, senior
guard/forward Markel
Walker, to just eight points
and four rebounds. Instead,
senior forward Alyssia
Brewer led the Bruins with
14 points.
The first half of play was
a struggle for both teams as
they shot a combined 24 per
cent from the field and had
13 turnovers. However,
Stanford was able to break
down the UCLA defense and
head into the half with a 36-
24 lead.
"We were struggling
because we were trying to
get a feel for the game,"
Ogwumike said. "Sometimes
the beginning is a little
rough, trying to get a feel and
see what offenses work. But I
think Amber [Orrange] real
ly breaking them down off
the dribble and then I think
Sara James really is the X
factor. She motivates people
to go hard, she dives on the
floor for loose balls even
if it's going to be a jump ball
she's still holding on."

Again, UCLA struggled
in the second half to keep up
with the Card. Coming out of
halftime, the Card went on a
13-2 run and never looked
back.
Sunday's game against
USC was a similar story,
with the Card going into the
break with its largest lead,
33-20. However, unlike the
Bruins, the Trojans came
back in the end to give the
Card a scare.
Stanford headed into the
locker room with all of the
momentum at the half as
Tinkle hit her second three
of the game with two sec
onds left on the clock.
Orrange came out hot in
the second half to put Stan
ford ahead by 19.
Stanford controlled the
pace of the game, forcing
USC to pick up full court;
however Stanford easily
passed the ball up the court
to break the press.
Ogwumike easily broke
the defensive pressure that
she fought with in the first
half as two consecutive
offensive boards led to easy
baskets, putting Stanford up
52-35 with 12:23 to play.
Defensive stops and great
energy led to more offensive
opportunities for the Card.
"My teammates did a
great job of finding me. [I
was] just being patient with
the ball," Ogwumike said.
"Coach tells me 'Don't drib
ble' because it sometimes
brings the defense. I think
my teammates did a good job
of finding me when I was in
position to attack the bas
ket."
USC's star player, junior
forward Cassie Harberts,
finished with 21 points and
seven rebounds. After only
scoring five points in the first
half, Harbert, with the help
of sophomore guard Ariya
Crook (18 points), was able to
propel the USC offense and
cut the 19-point deficit to just
five as they matched each
Stanford basket.
"It was the combination
of turning the ball over and
missed shots that gave them
the ball and they came
back," VanDerveer said.
"They have very quick, ath
letic guards and they were

able to take us off the dribble
to the basket. Our defense
held us in there. We worked
really hard defensively and
we're going to have to knock
down some shots. We need a
little more offense from
more people, and a little
more help."
Stanford had four players
reach double digits scoring
to help the team seize the
lead and never relinquish it.
Ogwumike led all scorers
with 29 points and 16
rebounds, recording her
13th double-double of the
season despite having a qui
et first half with just seven
points. Ogwumike's pres
ence on the boards allowed
the Trojans only five offen
sive rebounds in the game.
Little doubt remains regard
ing Ogwumike's role on this
team.
"She [Ogwumike] is an
All-Ameriean and she's play
ing like one," VanDerveer
said. "She's battling inside
rebounding, scoring,
doing whatever we need."
Tinkle was another offen
sive threat for the Card. She
continued her stellar per
formance from behind the
three-point line, going three
for three. Despite an ankle
injury incurred in practice
prior to the Cal loss, Tinkle
poured in 15 points and
grabbed seven rebounds.
Junior guard Sara James
secured her spot in the start
ing line up after solid play
against UCLA on Friday
and a stellar performance
against USC. She had 13
points and four rebounds,
despite only averaging 4.7
points for the season.
Also for the Card, sopho
more point guard Amber
Orrange had a great night,
shooting 66 percent from the
field, finishing with 13
points, three rebounds, and
three assists. The triple
threat play of Orrange,
Ogwumike, and Tinkle was
instrumental in the Card's
victory and will be the key to
future success.
The Card resumes Pac-12
play this weekend at home
against Utah and Colorado.
