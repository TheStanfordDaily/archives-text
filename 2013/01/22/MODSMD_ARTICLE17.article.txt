## SoCal proves hostile Stanford slips in MPSF Race 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend, the new-look
No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team
ventured on the road for the first
time, journeying down to Southern
California to take on its toughest
opponents yet, No. 7 USC and No. 4
Peppei'dine. The Cardinal entered
the weekend as the last undefeated
team in the MPSF, but saw its streak
end after dropping both games.

Coming off an unbelievable come
back last weekend against Pacific,
Stanford (4-2,2-IMPSF) found itself
in the same position as the Tigers:
unable to pull out a close game at the
end. USC (3-3, 2-2) started the set
hot, but Stanford soon caught up.
Down 19-17, the Trojans uncorked a
quick 4-0 run, retaking the advan
tage and the momentum.
The Cardinal refused to quit,
however, overcoming two set points
in tying the set up at 25 apiece. But
back-to-back Cardinal errors gave
the set to the Trojans.
The second set looked as though
it would be as close as the first. With
USC holding a slight 10-9 advantage,
the Trojans broke out, riding a 5-2
run that would give them a lead they
would not relinquish. USC ultimately
captured the second set 25-18.
Needing a third set victory to
preserve its undefeated season,
Stanford came out filing, cruising to
an early 8-3 lead. USC roared back,
however, eventually pulling the set
back to even at 14. At that point, nei
ther team would give ground to the
other.
Stanford held its first set-point of
the match at 25-24, but back-to-back
errors by the Cardinal shifted the
momentum back to the Trojan camp.

One of junior outside hitter
Brian Cook's match-high 16
kills tied the game at 26, and
Stanford soon held another
set-point after a Trojan error.
But the Cardinal was sim
ply unable to capitalize, com
mitting an error to tie the
game at 27 before back-to
back kills from USC junior
opposite Tanner Jansen
sealed the game for the Tro
jans. Jansen finished with 15
kills, leading USC.
Stanford suffered on the
defensive end during the
game, allowing the Trojans to
hit .402 for the match and
putting up just three blocks.
Fresh off its first defeat of
the season, Stanford came
into its match with Pepper
dine (3-1, 3-1) fully charged
and ready to return to its
winning ways, but fell into an
early hole as the Waves
kicked off the first set with a
7-2 run. Stanford answered
with a 5-0 surge of its own,
pulling the set even.
At that point, the teams
began to exchange points.
With the score locked at 11,
Pepperdine went on a 6-1
run, putting the Cardinal in a
hole it would be unable to
escape from, as the Waves
captured the first set 25-22.
Pepperdine looked to be
in control of the second set as
well, but Stanford was able to
break out of its offensive
funk. With the Waves holding
an 18-13 advantage, the Car
dinal scored four straight,
buoyed by back-to-back aces
by junior middle blocker Eric
Mochalski, to pull the set to a
one-score game. At that
point, Stanford was simply
unstoppable, taking the sec
ond set 25-23.
The third set was all Pep
perdine, however, as the
Waves started out hot and
refused to let the Cardinal
catch up, cruising to a 25-16
win.
Thus, Stanford again
faced a do-or-die set, needing
to capture the fourth to hold
any hope of victory. At first,
the Cardinal seemed to be in
control, grabbing an early 9-5
lead.

The Waves slowly chipped
away, however, finally pulling
even at 19. At that point, it
was anyone's game, with
both teams exchanging
points. In the end, however, it
was Pepperdine that 25-23
set victory and captured the
match 3-1.
As usual, Stanford was

led on offense by Cook. The
junior won Stanford/Muscle
Milk Student-Athlete of the
Week last week, and didn't
slow down this week. Cook
again led the team in kills,
posting 19 while hitting .333.
He also contributed five digs.
Stanford simply suffered
from unforced errors. The
Cardinal committed 25 serv
ice areas, compared to just 15
for Pepperdine, as well as
eight blocking errors to the
Waves' zero.
Ultimately, it was a disap
pointing weekend for the
Cardinal. Stanford will look
to right the ship Tbesday at 7
p.m. against No. 5 UCLA (6-
3,2-1) at Maples Pavilion.

hole it would be unable to
escape from, as the Waves
captured the first set 25-22.
Pepperdine looked to be
in control of the second set as
well, but Stanford was able to
break out of its offensive
funk. With the Waves holding
an 18-13 advantage, the Car
dinal scored four straight,
buoyed by back-to-back aces
by junior middle blocker Eric
Mochalski, to pull the set to a
one-score game. At that
point, Stanford was simply
unstoppable, taking the sec
ond set 25-23.
The third set was all Pep
perdine, however, as the
Waves started out hot and
refused to let the Cardinal
catch up, cruising to a 25-16
win.
Thus, Stanford again
faced a do-or-die set, needing
to capture the fourth to hold
any hope of victory. At first,
the Cardinal seemed to be in
control, grabbing an early 9-5
lead.

The Waves slowly chipped
away, however, finally pulling
even at 19. At that point, it
was anyone's game, with
both teams exchanging
points. In the end, however, it
was Pepperdine that 25-23
set victory and captured the
match 3-1.
As usual, Stanford was

led on offense by Cook. The
junior won Stanford/Muscle
Milk Student-Athlete of the
Week last week, and didn't
slow down this week. Cook
again led the team in kills,
posting 19 while hitting .333.
He also contributed five digs.
Stanford simply suffered
from unforced errors. The
Cardinal committed 25 serv
ice areas, compared to just 15
for Pepperdine, as well as
eight blocking errors to the
Waves' zero.
Ultimately, it was a disap
pointing weekend for the
Cardinal. Stanford will look
to right the ship Tbesday at 7
p.m. against No. 5 UCLA (6-
3,2-1) at Maples Pavilion.

Junior Brian Cook (5) had a team-high 19 kills and chipped in five digs and a
block, but Stanford couldn't overcome the efficient play of No. 4 Pepperdine's
Kyle Gerrans and Josh Taylor in a 3-1 loss on Sunday.
This past weekend, the new-look
No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team
ventured on the road for the first
time, journeying down to Southern
California to take on its toughest
opponents yet, No. 7 USC and No. 4
Peppei'dine. The Cardinal entered
the weekend as the last undefeated
team in the MPSF, but saw its streak
end after dropping both games.

Coming off an unbelievable come
back last weekend against Pacific,
Stanford (4-2,2-IMPSF) found itself
in the same position as the Tigers:
unable to pull out a close game at the
end. USC (3-3, 2-2) started the set
hot, but Stanford soon caught up.
Down 19-17, the Trojans uncorked a
quick 4-0 run, retaking the advan
tage and the momentum.
The Cardinal refused to quit,
however, overcoming two set points
in tying the set up at 25 apiece. But
back-to-back Cardinal errors gave
the set to the Trojans.
The second set looked as though
it would be as close as the first. With
USC holding a slight 10-9 advantage,
the Trojans broke out, riding a 5-2
run that would give them a lead they
would not relinquish. USC ultimately
captured the second set 25-18.
Needing a third set victory to
preserve its undefeated season,
Stanford came out filing, cruising to
an early 8-3 lead. USC roared back,
however, eventually pulling the set
back to even at 14. At that point, nei
ther team would give ground to the
other.
Stanford held its first set-point of
the match at 25-24, but back-to-back
errors by the Cardinal shifted the
momentum back to the Trojan camp.

01/20, Malibu, Calif.
One of junior outside hitter
Brian Cook's match-high 16
kills tied the game at 26, and
Stanford soon held another
set-point after a Trojan error.
But the Cardinal was sim
ply unable to capitalize, com
mitting an error to tie the
game at 27 before back-to
back kills from USC junior
opposite Tanner Jansen
sealed the game for the Tro
jans. Jansen finished with 15
kills, leading USC.
Stanford suffered on the
defensive end during the
game, allowing the Trojans to
hit .402 for the match and
putting up just three blocks.
Fresh off its first defeat of
the season, Stanford came
into its match with Pepper
dine (3-1, 3-1) fully charged
and ready to return to its
winning ways, but fell into an
early hole as the Waves
kicked off the first set with a
7-2 run. Stanford answered
with a 5-0 surge of its own,
pulling the set even.
At that point, the teams
began to exchange points.
With the score locked at 11,
Pepperdine went on a 6-1
run, putting the Cardinal in a
hole it would be unable to
escape from, as the Waves
captured the first set 25-22.
Pepperdine looked to be
in control of the second set as
