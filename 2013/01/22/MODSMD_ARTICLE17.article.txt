## SoCal proves hostile Stanford slips in MPSF Race 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend, the new-look
No. 2 Stanford men's volleyball team
ventured on the road for the first
time, journeying down to Southern
California to take on its toughest
opponents yet, No. 7 USC and No. 4
Peppei'dine. The Cardinal entered
the weekend as the last undefeated
team in the MPSF, but saw its streak
end after dropping both games.

Coming off an unbelievable come
back last weekend against Pacific,
Stanford (4-2,2-IMPSF) found itself
in the same position as the Tigers:
unable to pull out a close game at the
end. USC (3-3, 2-2) started the set
hot, but Stanford soon caught up.
Down 19-17, the Trojans uncorked a
quick 4-0 run, retaking the advan
tage and the momentum.
The Cardinal refused to quit,
however, overcoming two set points
in tying the set up at 25 apiece. But
back-to-back Cardinal errors gave
the set to the Trojans.
The second set looked as though
it would be as close as the first. With
USC holding a slight 10-9 advantage,
the Trojans broke out, riding a 5-2
run that would give them a lead they
would not relinquish. USC ultimately
captured the second set 25-18.
Needing a third set victory to
preserve its undefeated season,
Stanford came out filing, cruising to
an early 8-3 lead. USC roared back,
however, eventually pulling the set
back to even at 14. At that point, nei
ther team would give ground to the
other.
Stanford held its first set-point of
the match at 25-24, but back-to-back
errors by the Cardinal shifted the
momentum back to the Trojan camp.
