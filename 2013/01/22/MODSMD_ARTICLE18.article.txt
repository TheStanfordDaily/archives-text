# Be careful what you wish for

For the last week, two per
sonalities have dominated
the coverage of just about
every sports publication out
there: disgraced cyclist
Lance Armstrong and imaginary girl-
Mend Lennay Kekua. The story of
Notre Dame football player Manti
Te'o's nonexistent relationship even
made it to the front page of BBC
News' website, not usually an organi
zation known for its coverage of
American football, let alone American
college football.
Armstrong may have been given a
relatively sympathetic treatment by
Oprah Winfrey, but most probably
still feel let down by the once-super
hero's exposure as a serial drug cheat.
But with his eventual admission of
guilt he was actually brought down
late last year, though continued to
deny the truth until last week
hopefully now we can finally move on
from the whole ordeal. In comparison,
the Te'o saga meanwhile still feels sus
piciously incomplete. We know that
Kekua was a fictional character, but it
remains unclear whether the line
backer had any part in the illusion or
not.
While the media has lavished pub
lication and broadcast space on both
topics and likely reaped the
rewards in terms of greater reader
ship and viewership it was at least
partially complicit in both deceptions.
Self-respecting investigative journal
ists must be kicking themselves that
they didn't bring down one of the
biggest names in sports many years
earlier, and one of my fellow colum
nists has already taken a serious
swipe at Sports Illustrated's Pete
Thamel. Put bluntly, instead of follow
ing up on a lead that would have
blown the Te'o story wide open three
months ago, Thamel cut out any ref
erence to the mysterious Kekua
attending Stanford.
Partly, some of this may be down
to traditional media struggling to sur
vive in the world of social media.
When you can read the news fust
and for free on Twitter, why would
you ever buy a newspaper? In the
rush to break the news and score the
biggest online readership the cur
rency of the Internet there doesn't
seem to be time to be suspicious. And
why would you be anyway, when the
story is already so magical?
But before you start feeling all
smug, don't think for a moment that
I'm letting you off the hook either.
As a society, we also have to take
our fair share of the blame in these
sorry sagas. It takes two parties to
make any deception work and just
as we journalists and perhaps
Te'o should have been a little less
naive, you also shouldn't have been
so willing to trust us.
We all put these athletes on a
pedestal and demand the superhu
man from them. The average is just
not interesting or acceptable. We
don't want ordinary people accom
plishing difficult things; we want
superheroes achieving the impossi
ble. Like movie stars, their lives and
achievements are supposed to come
straight out of a Hollywood film
script.
Even reaching the lowest level
of professional sports takes years of
dedication, getting up at dawn to
train in the cold, carefully control
ling your calorie intake, eschewing
a normal childhood and somehow
balancing school and sports. Just
making it through all that is a phe
nomenal achievement on its own,
but hardly something you could
base a blockbuster film on, that's
what montages are for.
A good cyclist putting in solid
performances in the Tour de France
won't make us sit up and pay atten
tion only a seven-time champion
will. A solid defensive football play
er whose team goes undefeated in
the regular season won't be in the
running for the Heisman Trophy,
but one whose girlfriend recovers
from a serious car accident only to
then die heartbreakingly from
leukemia and on her deathbed
dramatically imploring him to not to
skip his upcoming game in order to
attend her funeral will.
And even when these people fail,
we expect them to do so in an
extraordinary way. Armstrong was
n't just a drug cheat, he was the
worst drug cheat ever, the chief
architect behind the most calculat
ed and nefarious attempt to deceive
the authorities in the history of
sports. Te'o wasn't just a gullible
kid, he was at the center of a cynical
and egotistical lie intended solely to
boost his national profile, bring
home the Heisman and guarantee
himself NFL riches.
But, when all is said and done,
these people are just as nor
mal, just as flawed and by
that I mean "human" —as
the rest of us. They'll do, say
and believe stupid things.
Except, unlike the rest of us,
we feed their habits. We
don't ask enough questions
because we want to believe
in them. Not in a conscious
way where we honestly
know something is up, but
simply in not showing a suf
ficiently healthy dose of sus
picion.

And just as we need to
recognize the human frail
ties of our sporting super
stars, we also need to recog
nize some of our own. How
ever impartial and unbiased
we may want to be or claim
to be, however cynical and
skeptical we think we are,

we are not.
One of the cruelest
ironies of The List was how
much flak sportswriters at
this publication received
from both fans and members
of Stanford's athletic depart
ment in its aftermath,
because behind the scenes of
The Daily are some of the
most ardent fans of Stanford
sports. Why else would we
devote so much of our lives
to covering even the lesser
known sports? Criticizing
Stanford, criticizing players
and classmates —, does
not come easily, but some
times it is our job, and realiz
ing that, we have to try.
Maybe coverage of the
"easy" list of classes given to
athletes by this publication
back then was too harsh, but
knowing that we have a
weakness towards Cardinal
sports sometimes focuses
the need to treat even our
own school with an overly
critical eye.

We are lucky that Stan
ford is an exceptional place,
that a lot of the time we get
to write about yet another
victory or another national
title and so there is relative
ly little justification to get on
the cases of coaches and
players, but we cannot just
sit back and believe.
If something seems too
good, or bad, to be true
and any school being simul
taneously ranked top 10 in
football and academics cer
tainly seems suspicious
we owe it to each other to
ask a few more questions, to
not accept the answers we're
given on face value alone.
