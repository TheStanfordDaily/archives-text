# WRESTLING
## Baumbach a bright spot in weekend losses 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It's been a tough year thus far for Stan
ford wrestling, with a combination of young
wrestlers, a difficult travel schedule and
tough competition resulting in a 4-12 overall
record. On Friday, the Cardinal lost its sev
enth consecutive dual match at home to No.
25 Air Force, and fell again on Saturday in a
32-6 loss to No. 9 Oregon State.
There was some good news, however, as
redshirt junior Bret Baumbach picked up
his sixth-straight win of the year against the
Beavers' Alex Elder at 165 pounds. Baum
bach recorded an early takedown and two
back points in the first for a 4-0 advantage.

Leading 8-1 early in the third period, he
held on for the victory and moved to 17-8
overall and 12-4 in duals.
Although the loss dropped the Card to 0-
2 in Pac-12 play, the dual started well for
Stanford at 125 pounds, where redshirt
freshman Evan Silver put the Cardinal on
top 3-0. After no score in the first period,
Silver took a 1-0 lead over Oregon State's

Joey Palmer in the second.
Silver tallied four more
points in the third to seal
the 5-2 decision.
The win gave Silver his
20th of the season, leading
all Stanford wrestlers. He
is also 12-4 in duals this sea
son, totaling 44 team points.
The Beavers, however,
boasted five ranked wrestlers
and won eight of the 10
bouts Saturday. The Cardi
nal forfeited at 141 pounds.
The story was similar
for Stanford on Friday
night, albeit in the friend
lier confines of the Ford
Center.

Silver gave the Cardinal
the early 3-0 lead with a 6-3
decision over Air Force's
Mitch Brown. Silver scored
all of his points in the first
period with three take
downs and was not threat
ened for much of the match.
But the Falcons then
posted 13 unanswered
points with wins at 133,141,
149 and 157 pounds.
Baumbach again
staunched the bleeding
thanks to a 3-0 decision
over Jesse Stafford at 165
pounds. There was no score
after the first period, but
when Stafford chose to
start down to start the sec
ond, Baumbach showed sol
id riding technique and
stayed on top for the entire
two minutes. Baumbach
then chose to start down in

the third period and regis
tered a reversal to take a 2-
0 lead. He finished with an
impressive 2:22 of riding
time.
Air Force won the next
three bouts to go up 24-6 in
the dual. In the final match
of the evening, Cardinal
heavyweight Dan Scherer
recorded a fall over Bently
Alsup in a little over five
minutes. It was the 16th
win of the year for the jun
ior and his ninth dual win.
Stanford continues Pac
-12 competition next week
end as it plays host to Cal
Poly on Sunday. The Cardi
nal and Mustangs are set to
meet at 2 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.

Stanford had to wrestle Air Force on Friday night at home and face Oregon State on the
road Saturday, but redshirt freshman Evan Silver (above) was unfazed, winning twice.
