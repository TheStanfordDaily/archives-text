### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It's been a tough year thus far for Stan
ford wrestling, with a combination of young
wrestlers, a difficult travel schedule and
tough competition resulting in a 4-12 overall
record. On Friday, the Cardinal lost its sev
enth consecutive dual match at home to No.
25 Air Force, and fell again on Saturday in a
32-6 loss to No. 9 Oregon State.
There was some good news, however, as
redshirt junior Bret Baumbach picked up
his sixth-straight win of the year against the
Beavers' Alex Elder at 165 pounds. Baum
bach recorded an early takedown and two
back points in the first for a 4-0 advantage.

Leading 8-1 early in the third period, he
held on for the victory and moved to 17-8
overall and 12-4 in duals.
Although the loss dropped the Card to 0-
2 in Pac-12 play, the dual started well for
Stanford at 125 pounds, where redshirt
freshman Evan Silver put the Cardinal on
top 3-0. After no score in the first period,
Silver took a 1-0 lead over Oregon State's
