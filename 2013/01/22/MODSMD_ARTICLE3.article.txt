## Q&A: Working on Wall Street Greg Smith, former Goldman Sachs exec., discusses finance industry, recruitment 
### â€” Nitish Kulkami 
Greg Smith was an executive director and vice
president of investing at Goldman Sachs. In
March 2012, he resigned from the firm in a very
public op-ed in The New York Times, decrying
the firm's change in culture and loss of client
focus. He has since written the book "Why I Left
Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story."
Smith, who graduated in 2001 spoke to The
Stanford Daily about his time at the firm, Stan
ford students on Wall Street and the difference
between Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): We read in your op-

Ed that you decided to leave Goldman Sachs
after an experience doing student orientation.
Was there a specific incident that you experi
enced while working at Goldman Sachs that
made your decision final?
Greg Smith (GS): Integrity and doing the
right thing is something that Goldman as a firm
always espoused to do. Certainly I think that's
one of the reasons that it survived for 140 years.
... I think that the problems came up in the early
2000?s when I joined the firm.
There was a whole host of regulations that
were overturned by Congress, which allowed it to
be a lot easier to make money by using your clien
t's information to place your own bets, as opposed
to helping your clients.
This didn't happen overnight,
but from what I saw through my
career from when I left Stanford
[in 2001] to when I left Goldman [in
2012] ...was an erosion of that
duty to the client, and a maximiza
tion of the firm's own interest over
the client. I think what got to me
was the hypocrisy of publicly say
ing, "Yes, our clients' interests
come first," ... whereas privately
doing something completely differ
ent and often using your client's
information to bet against them,
which is something that jived
against my ethical beliefs.
TSD: You worked at Goldman
Sachs for over 12 years. What
was it that attracted you there
right out of college?
GS: It was the idea of Goldman
Sachs being the absolute best in
the world, having the highest stan
dards. It was really the reputation.
If you flash back to 1999 to 2000,
when I was interviewing for Gold
man, it had an absolutely golden
reputation. I saw a real erosion of
that reputation as people tried to
make profits more and more quick
ly you had to have the right atti
tude towards clients. I saw that
mindset change at Goldman, and I
hoped that it would change back to
the way it was.

TSD: Do you think that some of
the things that you heard or said
or experienced at Stanford
affected your decision to leave
Goldman Sachs eventually?
GS: That's an interesting ques
tion. I think that Stanford is an
interesting place because it teaches
students to cut through the noise
and see the truth. Certainly I credit
Stanford for giving me my educa
tion, but I also credit it for giving me
my value set and my perception of

the world. I'm very proud of Stan
ford; one of the reasons I loved
recruiting was visiting Stanford. I
always found the East Coast kids,
the Harvards, the Whartons of the
world, as being really cutthroat.
Stanford students have a reputation
on Wall Street of being collaborative,
easygoing but still very acutely com
mercial. We want to be entrepre
neurial and create a product which
will contribute to society. That's
what I think the biggest difference is
in the way business is done in Silicon
Valley and on Wall Street.
TSD: Did you make an attempt to
change some of the [practices
you criticize] while at Goldman?
GS: I did. I used to do a lot of
recruiting, and I was one of the cap
tains of Stanford recruiting... With
in the firm, I certainly was a big pro
ponent of the culture. Once I saw
things go as they did during the
financial crisis, Goldman Sachs had a

big SEC [U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission] lawsuit, and
the firm ultimately settled a $5OO
million suit with the government.
I actually saw some wrongdo
ing, and the firm did a yearlong
study ... I found the survey to be
lip service.... After speaking to my
colleagues and nine different Gold
man partners, everyone agreed
that there were these lapses.... We
had no competition.
TSD: What advice would you
have to give to the 15 percent of
Stanford undergraduates who
ultimately will work in finance?
GS: I'm not certainly going to
be the person to tell students to go
or not to go into finance. There are
certainly a lot of positive aspects
to finance. Unfortunately, actual
finance on Wall Street is only 20
percent of the pie. So, what I
would say to people is that if you
are going into finance, go into it

for the right reasons. Don't go into
it because you think that it's the
easiest career or because you
think that it's the path you should
take.

TSD: One of the up-and-coming
fields that Stanford students are
interested in is venture capital.
What would you say about that,
as someone who did investment
banking on Wall Street?
GS: I think that it's a great pro
fession. I think that the level of
innovation going on in Silicon Val
ley is a level not seen anywhere else
in the world. When I was at Stan
ford, Google was being invented,
and I remember going to Chicago in
the 1990s and telling them to use
Google. When I graduated, I felt
that that era had come to a close.
What we see clearly with the ...
whole host of innovations is that
we're still pretty early in the cycle.
What I would say to Stanford stu

dents is that we're incredibly lucky
to be going here. Embrace the spir
it of innovation while you're here.
TSD: If a Stanford student came
up to you today with a job offer
from Goldman Sachs or another
reputable financial institution
on Wall Street, what advice
would you give them?
GS: Examine the reasons why
this is attractive to you. By that
what I mean is, "What are you real
ly interested in?" The longer I've
been in business and the longer
I've been away from Stanford [l've
realized] that it's more important
to follow your interests and your
heart than what you think you
should be going. I would encourage
them to not lose track of their own
ethical framework and to stay true
to themselves no matter how long
they stay in business.
I would not encourage someone
to go into something because it
looks flashy, or that they're sup
posed to do it, or that society thinks
it's the right thing to do.
TSD: Do you think that the cul
ture on Wall Street will be chang
ing anytime soon?
GS: I don't see it changing any
time 500n.... I think that the over
riding message I'm trying to get
across is to highlight to, especial
ly non-financial people, that
politicians are still being funded
by the banks they're trying to
regulate. I would take away this
misaligned incentive that Wall
Street is incentivized to swing for
the fences ... [and] if things go
really bad, the worst that will
happen is that taxpayers will have
to hold the bag and bail out the
bank. I feel that you need to make
an even playing field.
People need to be tied to their
performance over, say, five years.
There needs to be a changed fiduci
ary standard where conflicts of
interest disappear you need to
change some of the laws.

part of "The Ethics of Wealth" series. He focused on what he said is a systemically broken financial system.
Greg Smith was an executive director and vice
president of investing at Goldman Sachs. In
March 2012, he resigned from the firm in a very
public op-ed in The New York Times, decrying
the firm's change in culture and loss of client
focus. He has since written the book "Why I Left
Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story."
Smith, who graduated in 2001 spoke to The
Stanford Daily about his time at the firm, Stan
ford students on Wall Street and the difference
between Wall Street and Silicon Valley.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): We read in your op-

Ed that you decided to leave Goldman Sachs
after an experience doing student orientation.
Was there a specific incident that you experi
enced while working at Goldman Sachs that
made your decision final?
Greg Smith (GS): Integrity and doing the
right thing is something that Goldman as a firm
always espoused to do. Certainly I think that's
one of the reasons that it survived for 140 years.
... I think that the problems came up in the early
2000?s when I joined the firm.
There was a whole host of regulations that
were overturned by Congress, which allowed it to
be a lot easier to make money by using your clien
t's information to place your own bets, as opposed
to helping your clients.
This didn't happen overnight,
but from what I saw through my
career from when I left Stanford
[in 2001] to when I left Goldman [in
2012] ...was an erosion of that
duty to the client, and a maximiza
tion of the firm's own interest over
the client. I think what got to me
was the hypocrisy of publicly say
ing, "Yes, our clients' interests
come first," ... whereas privately
doing something completely differ
ent and often using your client's
information to bet against them,
which is something that jived
against my ethical beliefs.
TSD: You worked at Goldman
Sachs for over 12 years. What
was it that attracted you there
right out of college?
GS: It was the idea of Goldman
Sachs being the absolute best in
the world, having the highest stan
dards. It was really the reputation.
If you flash back to 1999 to 2000,
when I was interviewing for Gold
man, it had an absolutely golden
reputation. I saw a real erosion of
that reputation as people tried to
make profits more and more quick
ly you had to have the right atti
tude towards clients. I saw that
mindset change at Goldman, and I
hoped that it would change back to
the way it was.

TSD: Do you think that some of
the things that you heard or said
or experienced at Stanford
affected your decision to leave
Goldman Sachs eventually?
GS: That's an interesting ques
tion. I think that Stanford is an
interesting place because it teaches
students to cut through the noise
and see the truth. Certainly I credit
Stanford for giving me my educa
tion, but I also credit it for giving me
my value set and my perception of

the world. I'm very proud of Stan
ford; one of the reasons I loved
recruiting was visiting Stanford. I
always found the East Coast kids,
the Harvards, the Whartons of the
world, as being really cutthroat.
Stanford students have a reputation
on Wall Street of being collaborative,
easygoing but still very acutely com
mercial. We want to be entrepre
neurial and create a product which
will contribute to society. That's
what I think the biggest difference is
in the way business is done in Silicon
Valley and on Wall Street.
TSD: Did you make an attempt to
change some of the [practices
you criticize] while at Goldman?
GS: I did. I used to do a lot of
recruiting, and I was one of the cap
tains of Stanford recruiting... With
in the firm, I certainly was a big pro
ponent of the culture. Once I saw
things go as they did during the
financial crisis, Goldman Sachs had a

big SEC [U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission] lawsuit, and
the firm ultimately settled a $5OO
million suit with the government.
I actually saw some wrongdo
ing, and the firm did a yearlong
study ... I found the survey to be
lip service.... After speaking to my
colleagues and nine different Gold
man partners, everyone agreed
that there were these lapses.... We
had no competition.
TSD: What advice would you
have to give to the 15 percent of
Stanford undergraduates who
ultimately will work in finance?
GS: I'm not certainly going to
be the person to tell students to go
or not to go into finance. There are
certainly a lot of positive aspects
to finance. Unfortunately, actual
finance on Wall Street is only 20
percent of the pie. So, what I
would say to people is that if you
are going into finance, go into it

for the right reasons. Don't go into
it because you think that it's the
easiest career or because you
think that it's the path you should
take.

TSD: One of the up-and-coming
fields that Stanford students are
interested in is venture capital.
What would you say about that,
as someone who did investment
banking on Wall Street?
GS: I think that it's a great pro
fession. I think that the level of
innovation going on in Silicon Val
ley is a level not seen anywhere else
in the world. When I was at Stan
ford, Google was being invented,
and I remember going to Chicago in
the 1990s and telling them to use
Google. When I graduated, I felt
that that era had come to a close.
What we see clearly with the ...
whole host of innovations is that
we're still pretty early in the cycle.
What I would say to Stanford stu

dents is that we're incredibly lucky
to be going here. Embrace the spir
it of innovation while you're here.
TSD: If a Stanford student came
up to you today with a job offer
from Goldman Sachs or another
reputable financial institution
on Wall Street, what advice
would you give them?
GS: Examine the reasons why
this is attractive to you. By that
what I mean is, "What are you real
ly interested in?" The longer I've
been in business and the longer
I've been away from Stanford [l've
realized] that it's more important
to follow your interests and your
heart than what you think you
should be going. I would encourage
them to not lose track of their own
ethical framework and to stay true
to themselves no matter how long
they stay in business.
I would not encourage someone
to go into something because it
looks flashy, or that they're sup
posed to do it, or that society thinks
it's the right thing to do.
TSD: Do you think that the cul
ture on Wall Street will be chang
ing anytime soon?
GS: I don't see it changing any
time 500n.... I think that the over
riding message I'm trying to get
across is to highlight to, especial
ly non-financial people, that
politicians are still being funded
by the banks they're trying to
regulate. I would take away this
misaligned incentive that Wall
Street is incentivized to swing for
the fences ... [and] if things go
really bad, the worst that will
happen is that taxpayers will have
to hold the bag and bail out the
bank. I feel that you need to make
an even playing field.
People need to be tied to their
performance over, say, five years.
There needs to be a changed fiduci
ary standard where conflicts of
interest disappear you need to
change some of the laws.
