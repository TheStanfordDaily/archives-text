# Compensation for TAs, RAs rises
## Provost likely to set new minimum salary in Feb. 
### HELIN GAO 
Stanford has steadily increased the
minimum salary for teaching assistants
(TAs) and research assistants (RAs) in
recent years as a response to rising
graduate student living expenses. A TA
must be compensated at least $8,032 this
academic year, almost double the $4,940
salary in 2001-02.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
will likely to set a new minimum salary
for the 2013-14 academic year in late
February. The University provost is
responsible for revising the compensa
tion scheme for TAs and RAs each year
after reviewing an expense budget
report submitted jointly by the Financial
Aid Office and the Vice Provost for Grad
uate Education.
"We try to get it done by late Febru
ary because all of the graduate programs
want to know what these numbers are to
determine their next year's budget,"
said Ann George, assistant dean for
research and graduate studies.

Salary
TAs and RAs earn a compensation
package each year, which includes a
salary, covering a student's projected liv
ing expenses, and a tuition allowance.
"The minimum salary is based on
estimated student expenses, as pub
lished by the graduate student expense
budget every year," George said. "We
will commit to a minimum salary for 20
hours per week appointment that will at
least cover what we project will be the
minimum graduate student expense for

the year."
In the 2012-13 academic year,
the estimated graduate student
non-tuition expense stands at
$8,694. This encompassed on-cam
pus housing, food, transportation,
personal expenses and Cardinal
Care insurance.
During the academic year, grad
uate students can be appointed to
work a maximum of 20 hours per
week and a minimum of four hours
per week. If a student is appointed
to an assistant position less than
the 20-hour maximum, his or her
compensation is prorated.
TAs may also qualify for differ
ent minimum salary amounts
depending on their specified
responsibilities.
For instance, the minimum
salary is $8,032 for a course assis
tant, who assists a faculty member
in tasks like grading exams, prep
ping lecture materials and holding
office hours; $8,327 for a teaching
assistant, who has more independ
ence than a course assistant,
demonstrated through tasks like
preparing for class sections where
new material is presented; $8,596
for a graduate teaching affiliate,
who has the primary responsibility
for a course and is identified as that
course's instructor in Stanford
publications; and $8,596 for a men
tor teaching assistant, who coordi
nates the training of other teaching
assistants.
Graduates students, however,
frequently, perform responsibilities
beyond what their appointment
suggests.
"They may take on tasks beyond
what they are being paid for," said
Sally Gressens, assistant dean for

student affairs in the School of Engi
neering. "Most students do more
than the requirement of the job ...
because they love it."
There is no maximum amount
that a department can pay their
graduate TAs and RAs.
"If department feels that they
need to pay more to attract stu
dents, they could," George said.
"Typically, a student in the natural
sciences and biosciences is going to
have a higher funding value than
our students in the humanities."
Tuition allowance
While the minimum salary
remains the same across all schools
in the University, the second part of
the compensation scheme
tuition allowance varies.
For the 2012-13 academic year,
tuition allowance stands at $8,940
for an assistant at the Schools of
Earth Sciences, Education or
Humanities & Science; $9,520 for an
assistant at the School of Engineer
ing; $10,260 for an assistant at the
School of Medicine; $10,590 for an
assistant at the Stanford Law School;
and $12,420 for an assistant at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
These discrepancies reflect the
fact that allowances are based on a
student's tuition, according to
George. RAs and TAs in the GSB,
for instance, receive a higher
allowance because their school
charges a higher tuition rate.
Despite being compensated in
similar ways, TAs and RAs receive
their salaries through different
funding mechanisms. The Universi
ty fund TAs directly through alloca
tions to schools and departments.
Research grants, however, must
cover the bulk of the cost for RAs.
"For TAs, it's all Stanford mon
ey, but for RAs, the grant is typical
ly gotten from the faculty mem
ber's research grant," George said
"To make the most of our research

grant, Stanford typically subsidizes
a part of the tuition [for RAs]."
Funding for RAs in the School
of Engineering is typically
obtained from faculty-sponsored
research agreements with federal
agencies such as the National Sci
ence Foundation and Department
of Defense, according to Gressens.
With automatic federal budget
cuts which would reduce science
and research funding by $57.5 bil
lion over the next five years on
the horizon, the University is

expecting increasing difficulty for
faculties to obtain the research
funding.
"If the sequestration does hap
pen at the end of March, we are
concerned that it will become even
more difficult for faculty members
to get research grants," George
said. "But that is something we
have been coping with for a long
time."
