# Compensation for TAs, RAs rises
## Provost likely to set new minimum salary in Feb. 
### HELIN GAO 
Stanford has steadily increased the
minimum salary for teaching assistants
(TAs) and research assistants (RAs) in
recent years as a response to rising
graduate student living expenses. A TA
must be compensated at least $8,032 this
academic year, almost double the $4,940
salary in 2001-02.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2
will likely to set a new minimum salary
for the 2013-14 academic year in late
February. The University provost is
responsible for revising the compensa
tion scheme for TAs and RAs each year
after reviewing an expense budget
report submitted jointly by the Financial
Aid Office and the Vice Provost for Grad
uate Education.
"We try to get it done by late Febru
ary because all of the graduate programs
want to know what these numbers are to
determine their next year's budget,"
said Ann George, assistant dean for
research and graduate studies.

Salary
TAs and RAs earn a compensation
package each year, which includes a
salary, covering a student's projected liv
ing expenses, and a tuition allowance.
"The minimum salary is based on
estimated student expenses, as pub
lished by the graduate student expense
budget every year," George said. "We
will commit to a minimum salary for 20
hours per week appointment that will at
least cover what we project will be the
minimum graduate student expense for
