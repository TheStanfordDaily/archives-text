# STUDENT LIFE
## Horsing around on the Farm 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
On the far west side of campus,
tucked between Stanford's
tennis courts and golf course,
30 horses reside on 13 acres of
land in one of two campus
owned barns.
These 1,200-pound animals live in spa
cious and airy stalls with dirt floors bedded
in about three-quarters of an inch of Mallard
Mini-Flake, a material that makes the floor
bouncy and therapeutic, like a gymnastic
floor mat. Every room has what Vanessa
Bartsch '99, the head coach of the Stanford
Equestrian Team, describes as a "Harry
Potter water bucket" one that magically
refills itself after the horse finishes it.
Along with a staff of 16 groomsmen, the
40 equestrian team members are responsible
for caring for the horses. They groom and
walk the horses every day, and, of course, do
the horses' laundry. Last year, Bartsch esti
mates the team did 2,000 pounds of horse
laundry.
The Farm was once a breeding ground,
with the Main Quad area used for grazing
horses. The current Red Barn was built over
a hundred years ago, although it is not the
original barn that was burned down during a
fire in 1888.

Claire Margolis 'l5, captain of the equestrian team's English discipline, jumps with
Ronnie, a horse described by the team as the "love of the barn."
According to Bartsch, when
John Arrillaga '6O was asked if he
chose to fund the renovation of the
barn because he liked horses, he
replied that he simply wanted to
preserve it because he valued the
history of the University.

The equestrian season goes
from October to May, and during
that time the horses participate in
an event most weekends.
Just outside the barn lies the
main show area, where obstacles
and open space play home to com
petition and practices.
According to Alina Benavides
'l4, co-president of the equestrian
team, the horses are able to tell the
difference between practice and
performance.
"When the horses see specta
tors around the fence, they know
its go time, and they love to show
off," she said. "They'll puff up."
Practice is no simple prance
around the field, either. The eques
trian team trains with the horses
two to five times a week and each
team member rides a different
horse every day, since at competi
tions the hosting school provides
the horses.
"Everyone is catch-riding, so
you really have to learn how to get
to know a horse in a minute," said
Claire Margolis 'l5, captain of the
English discipline within the team.
"You have to know how to approach

and read a horse well."
Bartsch usually emails the team
with information about which horse
they will be riding at midnight the
day before an event at Stanford, so
that the riders can prepare them
selves for the animals' differing
styles with only one exception.
"If it's a special occasion, like if
it's the rider's birthday, I let them
ride their favorite horse," she said.

The natural appearance of an
equestrian show belies the hard
work and preparation that goes
into each event. Before each prac
tice, the team members spend
about 20 to 30 minutes grooming
the horse and picking out the dirt
from their hooves before they go
into the meticulously organized
tack room to gather the horse's
unique saddle and bit.
"Every horse's back is different
and we want to give the horses the
most comfortable ride possible,"
Bartsch said.
The horses are then walked a
bit to warm up before they start
their workout, which has different
intensities over the week just
like that of any varsity sport.
The horses even have a little
workout equipment of their own,
called hot walkers, which can
accommodate nine horses at once.
The machine has arms of metals
radiating off from a central pivot
point, which contains a motor that
moves the arms at various speeds.
About six days a week, the horses
walk in a large circle either clock
wise or counter-clockwise on the
device.
"The horses love it," Bartsch

said. "When they switch directions,
they love to see who is behind them
and touch noses."
The horses also have a round
pen where they can buck and play.
Of course, they have to watch out
for incoming golf balls flying in
from next door.
"Two years ago, our vet got hit
in the head with a golf ball,"
Bartsch explained. "But golfing
neighbors are great they help us
fix our golf carts."
Aside from golf balls in the
head, the horses also have to be
protected from the cold.
During the day, they wear a thin
blanket over their coats, which are
trimmed every year. The blankets
are meant to keep the horses warm
and prevent growth of their fur,
which detracts from dressage
points. During the nights, the hors
es will wear an additional thicker
blanket a "pony parka," joked
Benavides.
As for which horses go in which
stalls, Bartsch compares the place
ment of the horses to Stanford's
freshman year roommate pairings.
As herd animals, Bartsch notes, it
is important is to figure out where
each horse fits in the larger context

of a group.
"Sterling is like an alpha mare,"
Bartsch explained. "She doesn't
like to be around other mares. And
Lenny is quiet and introverted. He
also bites so we don't give him a
window. And Lando is strange; he
doesn't like other horses he just
likes people."

With such a wide array of hors
es, it is no surprise that every rider
has a different story to tell.
"Freddy is a weirdo," said team
member Erin Gray 'l3, referencing
a chestnut horse with a white
streak over his head.
"He's a goon," Margolis said.
"He tries really hard to be good but
he throws tantrums sometimes,
and he actually hates being
brushed, which is weird because all
horses love that. But he loves it
when you scratch his head."
And then there's Handsome, a
dark bay Belgian with a little
speckle of white between his eyes.
"Handsome is a dork," Gray
said. "He tries really hard to
understand what you want from
him, but people always say, 'Oh
Handsome, you're like a water buf
falo.'"

While the horses don't earn
awards of their own during compe
tition, at the end of year, the barn
has an informal award ceremony. A
horse named Ronnie has won
'favorite of the barn' for the last
few years.
"Ronnie is the love of the barn,"
said Gray said. "He's the biggest of
the barn but he's a sweetheart.
He's a giant teddy bear."
The bond between the horses
and their riders extends well
beyond practice and competition.
Dressage captain Patrick Freeman
'l3 recounted one late afternoon
last quarter when he had decided to
take a ride on one of his favorite
horses, Auzzie, to combat feelings
of depression.
Freeman recalls one instance
during which he was walking back
to the paddock with Auzzie, and the
horse leaned his head down for a
nuzzle, curling Freeman into a neck
hug.
"Sometimes, you don't need to
talk at all to these amazing ani
mals," he said. "They just know
exactly when you need a hug."
