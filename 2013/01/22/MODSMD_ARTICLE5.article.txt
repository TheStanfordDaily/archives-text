# STUDENT LIFE
## Horsing around on the Farm 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
On the far west side of campus,
tucked between Stanford's
tennis courts and golf course,
30 horses reside on 13 acres of
land in one of two campus
owned barns.
These 1,200-pound animals live in spa
cious and airy stalls with dirt floors bedded
in about three-quarters of an inch of Mallard
Mini-Flake, a material that makes the floor
bouncy and therapeutic, like a gymnastic
floor mat. Every room has what Vanessa
Bartsch '99, the head coach of the Stanford
Equestrian Team, describes as a "Harry
Potter water bucket" one that magically
refills itself after the horse finishes it.
Along with a staff of 16 groomsmen, the
40 equestrian team members are responsible
for caring for the horses. They groom and
walk the horses every day, and, of course, do
the horses' laundry. Last year, Bartsch esti
mates the team did 2,000 pounds of horse
laundry.
The Farm was once a breeding ground,
with the Main Quad area used for grazing
horses. The current Red Barn was built over
a hundred years ago, although it is not the
original barn that was burned down during a
fire in 1888.
