## 36 student groups apply for $40k spring Senate grants 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
received 36 applications for the second round
of its new grant program, "Redefining Stu
dent Life: The 80K Challenge," a significant
increase from the 20 applications received for
the first round.
The second round of grants will be used to
fund spring quarter events, while the first

round funded winter quarter events. Any gen
eral fees group hosting an event during either
of these quarters was eligible to apply for a
grant. A maximum of $40,000 for winter quar
ter will be announced today.
"We were expecting more for [spring quar
ter events], but definitely not almost twice as
much," Appropriations Committee Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4 said.
Pham believes the increase may be due to
the higher number of events in spring quarter,

as well as the fact that the deadline for spring
grant applications was a week later than the
winter deadline, giving groups more time to
prepare a proposal.
The Appropriations Committee will inter
view all applicants on Jan. 23 and 24, and will
present its recommendations at the Jan. 29
Undergraduate Senate meeting. The Senate
will vote on the grant recommendations, which
require two-thirds approval to pass.
Applications for the first round of
winter quarter grants closed on
Jan. 11. In total, 19 student groups
submitted 20 applications for
$lOO,OOO in funding, with Lambda
Phi Epsilon which submitted
two applications applying for
close to $25,000 and the Asia-Pacif
ic Student Entrepreneur ship Soci
ety applying for more than
$13,000.
Pham said that selecting which
winter quarter applications to rec
ommend to the Senate was diffi
cult, especially because the com
mittee realized that after making
their original selections, the sum of
the grants was over $40,000.
The committee reviewed the
applications again, and Pham said
the senators were "a little more
stringent" about making sure that
the groups could not receive fund
ing from other sources and that the
events matched the original pur
pose of the grant.
"We didn't keep track of how
much we were spending because
we didn't want to decrease the
chance of a group getting funding
just because we weren't under
the $40,000," Pham said. "But
when we went through it again,
the total summed up to be under
$40,000 so it worked out really,
really well."
The program does not stipulate a
cap on grant applications, though
the Senate had previously predicted
that the average grant amount
would be $5,000.
