As President Barack Obama enters his
second term, he will rely heavily on

The Stanford Daily (TSD): As we have seen
with recent candidates for Cabinet posi

ical appointments have become heavily
contentious. Was this the same as when
you served in government?
Alain Enthoven, assistant secretary of
defense, 1965-69: No, actually, it was a very
different world. When President Kennedy
was elected he appointed key cabinet posi

or anything like that. It was strictly a matter
of knowledge and competence. Unfortunately,
that has deteriorated a lot and I think now,
high-level appointments to the executive
branch are much more influenced by politics.
TSD: Given today's partisan conflict, do
you ever feel relieved that you are no
longer in the fray?
Keith Hennessey '9O, director of the
National Economic Council 2007-09: Every
day [laughs]. I don't mind being a part of
tense negotiations or tense conflict if it has a
decent chance of leading to some sort of
progress. I think what would be very frustrat

have all the tension and conflict with very lit
