## Faculty compare working in D.C. and at Stanford Former policy makers explain differences in culture and approach 
### AARON SEKHRI DESK EDITOR 
As President Barack Obama enters his
second term, he will rely heavily on
appointees from the world of academia to
replace departed advisers and fill new posi
tions. The Daily spoke to Stanford faculty
members with past experience in government
about their time in Washington, D.C.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): As we have seen
with recent candidates for Cabinet posi
tions, like Ambassador Susan Rice 'B6, for
mer Sen. Chuck Ilagel and Jack Lew, polit
ical appointments have become heavily
contentious. Was this the same as when
you served in government?
Alain Enthoven, assistant secretary of
defense, 1965-69: No, actually, it was a very
different world. When President Kennedy
was elected he appointed key cabinet posi
tions from both political parties, without any
reference to whether they supported him or
not, or without any reference to their political
affiliation. He just went for the best, most
highly qualified people, and when I was being
nominated to be assistant secretary of
defense, nobody asked me who I had voted for
or anything like that. It was strictly a matter
of knowledge and competence. Unfortunately,
that has deteriorated a lot and I think now,
high-level appointments to the executive
branch are much more influenced by politics.
TSD: Given today's partisan conflict, do
you ever feel relieved that you are no
longer in the fray?
Keith Hennessey '9O, director of the
National Economic Council 2007-09: Every
day [laughs]. I don't mind being a part of
tense negotiations or tense conflict if it has a
decent chance of leading to some sort of
progress. I think what would be very frustrat
ing about being in Washington right now is to
have all the tension and conflict with very lit
tle possibility of anything more than the sta
tus quo. That's what I think would be more
difficult.
TSD: How did your time in gov
ernment inform and change
your teaching and research?
Jeremy Weinstein, National
Security Council 2009-11: I
think one of the things you realize
when you have the opportunity to
serve in government is that the
opportunity exists to make change
on a transformative scale. And one
of the virtues of being a faculty
member and teacher at Stanford is
to be in an environment where,
through your research and teach
ing, you can really tackle tough
challenges and think about cre
ative and innovative solutions. And
so, in coming back to Stanford, one
of the things I very much focused
my attention on is how, with the
freedom and space that Stanford
provides us... we can identify
those issues ... for which we don't
have good solutions, and use the
space and creativity and intelli
gence that we have gathered on

this campus to really address
those issues.
TSD: What were the biggest dif
ficulties you encountered while
working in government?
Jeremy Weinstein: I think it's
clear that in making a transition
from academia to public service,
these represent two fundamental
ly different environments.
In this environment, as schol
ars and teachers, we have tremen
dous freedom to set our agenda,
define questions in the ways that
we want to ask them and build
strategies that make sense. We're
sort of the masters of our own
domain.
In government you are effec
tively doing the work of a coali
tion-builder, so it draws on an
entirely different set of skills and
muscles that you need to exercise
and strengthen. So in addition to
having good ideas and figuring out
how to provide the best evidence
for a particular policy proposition
that you're promoting, you also
have to figure out how to work the
system, how to build a coalition
and how to figure out what allies
you need to bring on board in
order to either get a particular

policy adopted or have it success
fully implemented.

TSD: Were you afforded the
same sort of freedom while in
government as when you were at
Stanford freedom to express
yourself in the way that you
would be able to in a place of
learning, as opposed to a politi
cized environment?
Mariano-Florentino Cuellar
Ph.D 'OO, White House Domestic
Policy Council 2009-10: There
was, in some ways, just as much
freedom. There was freedom to
discuss with colleagues new ideas,
to think about different ways of
achieving goals, to gather infor
mation about some things, but in
academia, you're generally operat
ing as a scholar, on your own.
In government you're part of a
big team. When you speak you
may speak on behalf of the admin
istration or even perhaps the U.S.
government, so that necessarily
changes some of the latitude you
have to make decisions on your
own. In the same fashion, when
senior White House officials in the
kinds of jobs like the one I had are
asked to give a speech, you do
have to think a little bit about how

this is going to affect agencies that
you work with and people that you
work with.
TSD: What did you miss about
academia?
Mariano-Florentino Cuellar:
I loved the constant stimulation of
new challenges while I was in gov
ernment, but I missed the time to
think and reflect for a longer peri
od of time on the challenges that
were on my desk. Really, I missed
the people and the time. I missed
some of my academic colleagues. I
would call them sometimes to get
ideas and I would come back and
visit them.
In academia you're surrounded
by people who are not only very
smart but also who have as their
job to understand the world bet
ter, and that's very stimulating. In
government, you're surrounded
by people who are often also very
smart but whose job may be to get
something done, to implement
something, to oversee something
or to coordinate, so people under
stand their roles in fundamentally
different ways.

ernment inform and change
your teaching and research?
Jeremy Weinstein, National
Security Council 2009-11: I
think one of the things you realize
when you have the opportunity to
serve in government is that the
opportunity exists to make change
on a transformative scale. And one
of the virtues of being a faculty
member and teacher at Stanford is
to be in an environment where,
through your research and teach
ing, you can really tackle tough
challenges and think about cre
ative and innovative solutions. And
so, in coming back to Stanford, one
of the things I very much focused
my attention on is how, with the
freedom and space that Stanford
provides us... we can identify
those issues ... for which we don't
have good solutions, and use the
space and creativity and intelli
gence that we have gathered on

this campus to really address
those issues.
TSD: What were the biggest dif
ficulties you encountered while
working in government?
Jeremy Weinstein: I think it's
clear that in making a transition
from academia to public service,
these represent two fundamental
ly different environments.
In this environment, as schol
ars and teachers, we have tremen
dous freedom to set our agenda,
define questions in the ways that
we want to ask them and build
strategies that make sense. We're
sort of the masters of our own
domain.
In government you are effec
tively doing the work of a coali
tion-builder, so it draws on an
entirely different set of skills and
muscles that you need to exercise
and strengthen. So in addition to
having good ideas and figuring out
how to provide the best evidence
for a particular policy proposition
that you're promoting, you also
have to figure out how to work the
system, how to build a coalition
and how to figure out what allies
you need to bring on board in
order to either get a particular

policy adopted or have it success
fully implemented.

TSD: Were you afforded the
same sort of freedom while in
government as when you were at
Stanford freedom to express
yourself in the way that you
would be able to in a place of
learning, as opposed to a politi
cized environment?
Mariano-Florentino Cuellar
Ph.D 'OO, White House Domestic
Policy Council 2009-10: There
was, in some ways, just as much
freedom. There was freedom to
discuss with colleagues new ideas,
to think about different ways of
achieving goals, to gather infor
mation about some things, but in
academia, you're generally operat
ing as a scholar, on your own.
In government you're part of a
big team. When you speak you
may speak on behalf of the admin
istration or even perhaps the U.S.
government, so that necessarily
changes some of the latitude you
have to make decisions on your
own. In the same fashion, when
senior White House officials in the
kinds of jobs like the one I had are
asked to give a speech, you do
have to think a little bit about how

this is going to affect agencies that
you work with and people that you
work with.
TSD: What did you miss about
academia?
Mariano-Florentino Cuellar:
I loved the constant stimulation of
new challenges while I was in gov
ernment, but I missed the time to
think and reflect for a longer peri
od of time on the challenges that
were on my desk. Really, I missed
the people and the time. I missed
some of my academic colleagues. I
would call them sometimes to get
ideas and I would come back and
visit them.
In academia you're surrounded
by people who are not only very
smart but also who have as their
job to understand the world bet
ter, and that's very stimulating. In
government, you're surrounded
by people who are often also very
smart but whose job may be to get
something done, to implement
something, to oversee something
or to coordinate, so people under
stand their roles in fundamentally
different ways.

As President Barack Obama enters his
second term, he will rely heavily on
appointees from the world of academia to
replace departed advisers and fill new posi
tions. The Daily spoke to Stanford faculty
members with past experience in government
about their time in Washington, D.C.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): As we have seen
with recent candidates for Cabinet posi
tions, like Ambassador Susan Rice 'B6, for
mer Sen. Chuck Ilagel and Jack Lew, polit
ical appointments have become heavily
contentious. Was this the same as when
you served in government?
Alain Enthoven, assistant secretary of
defense, 1965-69: No, actually, it was a very
different world. When President Kennedy
was elected he appointed key cabinet posi
tions from both political parties, without any
reference to whether they supported him or
not, or without any reference to their political
affiliation. He just went for the best, most
highly qualified people, and when I was being
nominated to be assistant secretary of
defense, nobody asked me who I had voted for
or anything like that. It was strictly a matter
of knowledge and competence. Unfortunately,
that has deteriorated a lot and I think now,
high-level appointments to the executive
branch are much more influenced by politics.
TSD: Given today's partisan conflict, do
you ever feel relieved that you are no
longer in the fray?
Keith Hennessey '9O, director of the
National Economic Council 2007-09: Every
day [laughs]. I don't mind being a part of
tense negotiations or tense conflict if it has a
decent chance of leading to some sort of
progress. I think what would be very frustrat
ing about being in Washington right now is to
have all the tension and conflict with very lit
tle possibility of anything more than the sta
tus quo. That's what I think would be more
difficult.
