Girl, look at that body. Or, just look at the dude in the corner watching "The Lion King" during his run. Here are
the top five people you'll encounter at the gym. Now, if we've offended anyone, we do apologize, but just
remember: some stereotypes are created for a reason.

The Nerd/The Hipster
The nerd and the hipster have
been carefully placed under the
same category because, unfor
tunately, they both cannot lift
weights. Whether the hipster is
outfitted in big glasses and
freshly styled hair or the nerd
nervously strolls the weight aisle
in a polo, both are clearly
novices to the underground
world of the sweat-ridden gym.
One can identify these folks by
their adorable mannerisms and
apparent confusion as to what
they are doing there.

The Athlete
The athlete can take the form of
either a man or a woman. And
yes, this person is the one who
makes you feel bad about your
life: the person who makes you
wish that when you looked down
you did not see a hearty meal at
Arrillaga, but rather a means by
which to washboard your last
weeks' laundry. Whether decked
out in skintight spandex or Nike
Dri-FIT, if you are looking for
some motivation, it's a good idea
to work out near these people.

The Buff Guy
The Buff Guy is not to be con
fused with the athlete, for his sole
rationale for gym use is to achieve
looks, not function. These males,
who usually travel in small groups
and dress in a variation of the hall
mark "bro tank," are not to be tri
fled with. These men know the
exact location of every weight and
will often flex and stare longingly
into the mirror yes, at them
selves. Words of advice regarding
you and these men? Do not
approach. Do not challenge.

The Rando
The Rando, or random one,
is the person who does not
belong in one way or
another creeper, suit
wearer, portable movie
player (I mean, really?)
Note: If there is no Rando
in the gym, there is a good
chance you might be The
Rando.

The Chemical Engineer
The chemical engineer, very simi
lar to the TV-screen watcher, is the
gym-goer who brings a textbook.
While it seems they are spending
quality time with the elliptical or
stationary bicycle, this person is in
fact immersed in a world of practi
cally unintelligible subject matter.
To the wandering eye, peeking
over their shoulder is never a
good idea because, if your work
out wasn't stressful enough, trying
to comprehend their textbook
might just put you over the edge
which raises the question: are
they even actually working out?
