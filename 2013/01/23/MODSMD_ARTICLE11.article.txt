## OP-ED Pre-K helps reduce educational inequity, and so can you 
### ALIY BOSSERT '10 Ally was a 2010 Teach For America corps member in the Las Vegas Valley, where she continues to teach today 
As a senior at Stanford in 2010,
I felt strongly that the fight
for educational equity was
the most important movement of
our generation. After four years at
what I still believe is the greatest
place in the world, having every
opportunity at my fingertips, I felt
an intense obligation to ensure that
every student not just the ones
born in affluent communities had
access to an excellent education. I
joined Teach For America with this
conviction, and every day that I
work with my pre-K students, I
know that I made the right choice.
I currently have the privilege of
working with 40 amazing four-year
olds at the outset of their education
al journey. For most of my students,
this is their first experience in school.
Their time in my classroom forms
the foundation for their future suc
cess in school and beyond. If I'm able
to help spark their curiosity, build
them love of learning and develop the
skills they'll need to actively engage
in school throughout their educa
tion, they'll be starting out on a path
to realize their full potential.
For my students, and so many
others across this country the addi
tional challenges posed by poverty
cause them to start their academic
careers already behind their peers
in wealthier communities. However,
research shows that children who
attend high-quality pre-K pro
grams are more likely to achieve
academically, earn more and avoid
involvement with the criminal jus
tice system later in life. While aca
demics are obviously important, it's
not just about ABCs and shapes;
pre-K gives students a chance to
develop self-regulation abilities,
conflict resolution aptitudes and
critical thinking skills that will
serve them for the rest of their
lives. With the right support from
families, community members and
dedicated educators, we can give
kids in low-income communities the
chance to start out with equal foot
ing in school, as well as skills and
mindsets which will empower them
to reach their full potentials.
The longer I stay in this line of
work, the more reasons I have to
believe it is worthwhile. A few
weeks ago, Fabian's mother called
to tell me that it was his sixth birth
day. I taught Fabian for two years
during my Teach For America com
mitment. When he ran into my class
for the first time (yes, ran he
rarely walked anywhere), he was
three years old and had an individ-

ual special education plan for a
range of social, behavioral and lan
guage delays. He couldn't sit in a
circle with other students to save
his life, he frequently broke down
into hysterics when he encountered
a setback and most people couldn't
understand him when he spoke. It
took new energy and creativity
every day to figure out how I could
help Fabian learn, and we had plen
ty of hard days. However, when it
was time for him to leave me, he had
learned to self-manage his bound
less energy and he sought out
opportunities to learn. Although it
was hard for me to let him go, I
knew he was ready for the next
step. Not only is he functioning nor
mally in a general education
Kindergarten class, but he also
earned straight As last trimester.
By helping students like Fabian
learn in their own ways through
exploration, play and academics, it
is clear to me that young children
are growing and learning every
minute of every day. Research
shows that more than 85 percent of
the brain develops before the age of
five before students enter
Kindergarten. Pre-K comes at a
critical time for learning, giving
teachers an especially meaningful
chance to put students on the path
to a lifetime of success in learning.
I know first-hand that dedicated
teachers can significantly close the
gap for our youngest students, and I
believe that, in our lifetime, we can
ensure that all students in this coun
try have access to a great education.
I simply can't walk away from
this work. My commitment to educa
tional equity will be lifelong, but the
movement continues to need talent
ed individuals who are committed to
making a difference. As you think
about what role you will play after
graduation, I hope that you will con
sider joining me in the effort to
ensure that we give all children,
regardless of their family income,
the kind of education that will allow
them to reach their full potentials.
