## Hook-ups: the less-expensive talk therapy 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
My freshman year in high
school, I remember hearing
the whispers that "so-and
so hooked up with so-and-so" for
the first time. I nodded knowingly.
Did that mean they kissed? Or
started dating? Or did if.
Since age fifteen, the term
"hook-up" has become much clear
er, yet the motives behind why peo
ple hook up have become much
hazier. It's not out of deep feelings
of love, obviously. And it often hap
pens unadvisedly, I fear. Chalk it up
to hormones. Blame it on the alco
hol. The scapegoats miss a big part
of the story.

Whittle away the hook-up cul
ture to its essential parts and you
get a crude and inelegant sequence
of events: preen your tail feathers,
find a mate and do what mates do
together. The drinking, the chat
ting, the play-acting are all auxil
iary to this pattern. If you were to
identify a college student's objec
tive in this dance the way you would
Ophelia's in Hamlet, it seems pret
ty physical.

In many ways, a student's week
end objective is to have an orgasm,
plain and simple. But along the road
to that end, he has to learn how to
be courageous, vulnerable, honest
and creative. He exercises new
emotional muscles in a diorama of
real-life where he has space to mess
up safely without wreaking too
much havoc. And somewhere on the
path from SAE to KA which
might I remind you is a very scary
path the college student's objec
tive shifts from finding a mate to

finding himself. Goodbye fellatio,
hello Freud.
Let me explain. I am a twenty
year-old girl. I hear a lot of bitching
about romances turned sour by mis
understandings, and I know more
details than I care to know about
hook-ups. I know enough to be confi
dent that, when Stanford students
are in bed with each other, they
aren't talking about the weather.
They're divulging secrets that are
inappropriate to divulge to someone
who was a total stranger four hours
and five drinks ago. People talk
about family drama, career goals,
their personal disappointments and
failures in school. People talk too
much about ex-boyfriends. They
look for patterns, trying to explain
how they fear attachment because of
their relationship with then- father,
or how they can't get involved
romantically because they are afraid
of rejection. All this disclosed to
someone who is supposed to serve a
strictly physical role in the narrative
of Friday night. Why entrust so
much in a stranger and confine real
friendships to small talk and gossip?
It's a kind of playing house that
serves the marginal space between
the childhood games full of trite
stereotypes about love and family
and the adult responsibilities of
building a real family with founda
tions of real love. We know that
lying in bed with someone after
being intimate with them is sup
posed to be an intimate scenario, so
we practice being intimate. We
smooth out emotional stutters by
reaching toward their articulation.

You can't do that when you're talk
ing to a wall. You can't even do that
talking to a friend at dinner. There
is something about the countervail
ing anonymity and intimacy of
hooking up with a stranger that cre
ates just the right temperature and
pressure conditions to catalyze an
emotional experiment.
Hooking up is a choice. It hurts
some people. It helps others grow.
Personally, I prefer a dinner date.
But the stigma around hooking up
is unwarranted. I can't judge some
one for participating in a culture
that very subtly facilitates the com
plex business of emotional under
standing. I can, however, judge
someone who hooks up with other
people disrespectfully and gets
what they need at someone else's
expense.
Here I'm stumped. Hook-ups
give students the freedom to learn
about themselves and their peers
precisely because there are so few
rules. So how do we engage respect
fully in a behavior whose loose
parameters facilitate disrespect? I
would offer the following: be direct.
Communicate so you are clear with
the stranger you are sleeping with
about what you both want. Be safe.
Use condoms. And know your own
expectations and don't put yourself
in a situation in which you will get
your feelings hurt. Have fun, but
watch out. Playing house is no easy
business, and we're no longer deal
ing with Barbie and Ken.
