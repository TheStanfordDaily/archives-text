## The
						Best Area for sports fans

When I was watch
ing the NFC
Championship
game this past
Sunday, I strange
ly found myself rooting for the San
Francisco 49ers.
I say strangely because, as a Patri
ots fan, I knew there was no way in
hell that the Pats would win the Super
Bowl if they faced the 49ers. I was
probably right, except I was also
naive enough to think that Tom Brady
could overcome a red-hot Ravens
team later that day. I underestimated
the impact of Ray Lewis' final hurrah
and the sudden emergence of Joe
Flacco, who has somehow made Phil
Simms semi-believable when he crazi
ly said two weeks ago, "Flacco is as
dangerous a thrower as there is in the
NFL." (But honestly, CBS really
should offer a mute-Simms option.)
So why did I root for the 49ers?
Was it because of the sensational sto
ry of Colin Kaepernick, who was
offered only one scholarship coming
out of high school? Was it because of
Jim Harbaugh's hilarious temper
tantrum when a call doesn't go in his
favor? Or was it just because I was
being sucked into Bay Area sports
after living here for a year?
I just listed several viable explana
tions, but the biggest reason why I
wanted to see the 49ers punch their
ticket to New Orleans was that the
49ers reminded me so much of
Stanford's own football team this
season.
Of course, the expectations for
the 49ers this year were comparative
ly higher than those for the Cardinal;
San Francisco was an early Super
Bowl favorite, while Stanford was
nowhere to be found in the confer
ence championship prediction dis
cussion. But it should be said that
both teams ended their seasons last
year in heartbreaking fashion: the
49ers were one muffed punt away
from reaching the Super Bowl and
the Cardinal was one kick away from
capturing the Fiesta Bowl.
The first half of the season was a
rocky road for the two Bay Area
teams. San Francisco opened with a
statement win over the Packers in
week one, but fell to the Vikings on
the road and the Giants at home.
After shocking the country with an
upset over then-No. 1 USC, Stanford
proceeded to lose to Washington
and Notre Dame.
Then the quarterback changes
came. Colin Kaepernick saw his first
meaningful playing time in the ninth
game of the season and then started
in the tenth game. Kevin Hogan, too,
saw extended action for the first time
in game nine against Colorado and
then went on to start against Oregon
State in the tenth game of the season.
To be fair, the situations for the
two teams were different. Har
baugh's decision to replace Alex
Smith who had just set an NFL
record by completing 19 of his 20
passes on Monday Night Football
with Kaepernick was much more
controversial. Josh Nunes wasn't
exactly leading the nation in passing
efficiency when David Shaw elected
to bench him for Hogan.
The purposes of those two quar
terback switches, however, were the
same. Sure, Smith had taken the
49ers to the NFC Championship,
but did he have the explosiveness to
go blow-for-blow with fearless gun
slingers like Aaron Rodgers and
Matty Ice? Could he have led the
49ers to a Super Bowl title the second
time around? Harbaugh obviously
didn't think so. Considering how
much Nunes was struggling in the
short passing game, could he have
rallied Stanford to victories over
Oregon State, Oregon and UCLA
like Hogan did? I'm glad we didn't
find out. Kaepernick and Hogan
brought the added dimension of
mobility that Smith and Nunes did
n't possess as pocket passers. Both
Smith and Nunes had their share of
inspiring scrambles (see the 2011
NFC Championship Game and the
USC game), but they didn't show
enough to force opposing defenses
to change their game plans.
Of course, there is the obvious
fact that Stanford won its first Rose
Bowl in four decades while San
Francisco finally has the chance to
bring back the Lombardi Trophy for
the first time in almost 20 years.
But even some of the finer details
are the same for the two teams. The
49ers had their signature regular sea
son win late in the year, an impres
sive 41-34 victory over the Pats in
Foxboro that verified their status as a
Super Bowl contender. Stanford had
its own signature win, of course,
with that 17-14 stunning overtime
