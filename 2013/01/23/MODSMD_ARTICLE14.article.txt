# JAHN HEADS TO QUAKES
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford senior Adam Jahn, who led the men's
soccer team this season with a career-high 13
goals and 30 points, was selected by the San Jose
Earthquakes with the 15th pick in Tuesday's MLS
Supplemental Draft. The Davis, Calif, native Jahn
was invited to the MLS pre-draft combine and
named among the top-60 draft-eligible players in
the country, but he was very pleased to be select
ed by a team so close to home.
"Oh, it's great," Jahn said about landing with
the Earthquakes. "I get to stay local around my
Mends and family and try to play for a team that
I know a lot about and I've followed for a long

time. I'm really excited about the opportunity."
After helping Stanford make an appearance in
the NCAA Tournament as a sophomore, the 6-
foot-3 forward helped the Cardinal to a 9-8-1 over
all mark, and a third-place finish in the Pac-12 with
a 54-1 conference record.

He was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team for
his standout senior campaign, making him a four
time all-conference selection for his career. Jahn
twice earned the Pac-12 Player of the Week honor
in 2012, the second honor coming Nov. 13 after
posting his first career hat trick, and the first Car
dinal hat trick in 11 year's, in Stanford's 6-1 away
win at arch-rival California. In the match, Jahn
netted the equalizer and go-ahead goals either
side of halftime, then added the third by rifling a

shot into the roof of the net in the 77th minute.
Jahn, who started all 18 matches for the Cardi
nal in 2012, provided a team-best four match-win
ners on the year. His match-winners included
Stanford's away wins over ranked teams such as
No. 11 UC-Irvine on Sept. 7 and No. 25 UC-San
ta Barbara on Oct. 26, in addition to an 86th
minute winner in a 3-2 home win over Oregon
State on Oct. 18.
He ends his Cardinal career with 24 goals, 12
assists and 60 points. His 13 goals in 2012 is the
highest tally for a Stanford player in 12 years.
As Jahn transitions to the professional ranks,
he said he expects to join the Quakes in their pre-
