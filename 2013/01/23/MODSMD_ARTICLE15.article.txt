# CARD JUST SHORT
## NO.9 GEORGIA OUT-LASTS STANFORD 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
After two consecutive quad
meet victories and despite some
impressive individual performanc
es, the No. 10 women's gymnastics
team could not quite ride its
momentum against a No. 9 Georgia
team on Monday, losing 195.400-
197.000. Georgia has given the Car
dinal nothing but trouble over the
years: Stanford hasn't beaten the
Gym Dogs since 2004, and in 20 all
time meetings between the two
teams, Georgia has taken 18 of
them. Their last meeting came in
2010, when the top-ranked, defend
ing national champion Gym Dogs
outlasted the Cardinal by just one
tenth of a point in Stanford's open
ing contest of the season.
Before the meet even got start
ed, the Cardinal was hit with an ear
ly setback: head coach Kristen
Smyth gave sophomore Ivana Hong
the meet off after noticing an issue
in one of her routines. Hong was
originally slated to compete in the
all-around competition, leaving four
slots to be filled by her teammates.
Co-captain Ashley Morgan, one of
just two seniors on the team this
year, was impressed with her team's
ability to cope with the challenge
and credited the team's strong indi
vidual relationships.
"Throughout the meet, everyone
could feel our connectivity," Morgan
said, "especially as we dealt with
adversity that was thrown our way."
Georgia got off to an early lead,
putting up a 49.400 on vault com
pared to Stanford's 48.850 on bars.
The Bulldogs' 49.400 would ulti
mately be tied for the highest team
score in an event that afternoon,
earning Georgia a boost that it
would not relinquish. Stanford was
led by a pair of 9.850 scores by Mor
gan and sophomore Samantha
Shapiro.
While Stanford put up a strong
49.125 on vault to try to reduce the
gap, the Gym Dogs put up another
49.400 on bars, increasing their
lead. Senior co-captain Nicole Day
ton led on the bars for the Cardinal

once again with a score of 9.925, a
score good enough to earn her a
third individual vault title in many
meets; she has established herself
as one of the stronger vault com
petitors out there. However, her
team still trailed 97.795-98.800
going into the third round.
Despite sophomore Pauline
Hanset's 9.875 and Morgan's 9.850
on floor exercise, Stanford tallied a
team score of 48.375, its lowest
team score for the competition.
Hanset's score tied her career high,
while freshman Melissa Chuang
also put up a career high with a
score of 9.825. Chuang has been one
of the more consistent Cardinal
competitors this season, as she
scored a 9.825 on vault as well, an
event she has competed in every
meet so far this season.

Trailing 146.350-147.625 going
into the final round, Stanford knew

it would need some of its strongest
performances if it were to pull off
the miraculous. Junior co-captain
Amanda Spinner did as much as she
could, posting a 9.925 on balance
beam, a career-best score and the
highest beam score the Cardinal
has seen all season. Morgan and
sophomore Kristina Yaculik both
scored 9.800, helping Stanford
score a 49.050 in the event and giv
ing it the victory in beam over Geor
gia 49.050-48.825. However, the
Bulldogs' 49.375 on the floor exer
cise would seal its 1.6-point victory
over the Cardinal.
Morgan was the only competitor
in the meet to compete in all four
events, and she came away with a
39.925 all-around score. She noted
that the team members are particu
larly intent on holding each other to

Despite a career-best 9.925 on balance beam, the highest beam score
the team has had all season, junior co-captain Amanda Spinner
(above) and No. 10 Stanford could not defeat Georgia on Monday.
