## Stanford serves up win CARDINAL DEFEATS NO. 4 BRUINS 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team entered Tuesday's matchup
with No. 4 UCLA having had
just one day of rest after a brutal
road trip. As it turned out, one
day's rest was all the team need
ed, as the weary Cardinal
imposed its will upon the Bruins,
pulling out a 3-1 victory in front
of a boisterous home crowd.
The Bruins (6-4, 2-2 MPSF)
led for much of the first set, but
the Cardinal (5-2, 2-2 MPSF)
stayed calm and refused to bow
to UCLA pressure. Down 20-16,
Stanford broke out, unleashing
a 6-2 run that tied the game at
22. After failing to convert on
two set points, the Cardinal
finally sealed the set 27-25 with
a powerful three-way block by
junior outsider hitter Brian
Cook, sophomore middle block
er Spencer Haly and freshman
setter James Shaw.
Set two was all UCLA, how
ever. While the Cardinal kept it
somewhat close, Stanford never
led, dropping the set 25-19.
At first, the third set seemed
as though it was destined to be a
battle. The loud pro-Stanford
crowd, however, began to get
inside the Bruins' heads, caus
ing a number of careless mis
takes that the Cardinal was only
too happy to capitalize on. The
Cardinal had particularly
strong defense at the net, with
six blocks in the set alone, as
Stanford blew UCLA out, 25-14.
The fourth set was more of
the same; UCLA became more
and more flustered by the Stan
ford attack. The Bruin defense
was simply unable to handle the
powerful Cardinal offense, with
important contributions coming
from all Stanford players.
Junior outside hitter Steven
Irvin was especially dominant,
uncorking three of his match
high four aces in the fourth set.
Fittingly, the Cardinal ended
UCLA's misery on one of
Irvin's aces, capturing the
set 25-12. Irvin also finished
with 14 kills and 8 digs, while
hitting .480.
Shaw had yet another
impressive match, with 36
assists, seven digs and three
blocks. He even contributed
five kills, sneaking the ball
over the net with attacks that
UCLA had no chance to
recover.
Stanford hit .346 for the
match, while holding UCLA
to just .228 hitting. Each of
the Bruins' top four hitters
hit below their season aver
ages, with Dane Worley
leading the way at .199.
Just two days after Stan

ford committed an egregious
25 service errors, the Cardi
nal showed incredible poise
behind the line, with eight
aces and just 10 errors.
All in all, it was an incred
ibly impressive victory for
the young Cardinal team,
putting Stanford back on the
map and showing that it is a
force to be reckoned with in
the MPSF. Few teams can
match the versatility of
Shaw, outsider hitter combi
nation of Cook and Irvin, or
the sheer power of junior
middle blocker Eric Mochal
ski. The Cardinal will cer
tainly be trouble for any
opponent it faces.
Stanford is back in action
on Saturday night against
UC Santa Barbara at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion.
