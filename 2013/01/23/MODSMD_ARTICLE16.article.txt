### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team entered Tuesday's matchup
with No. 4 UCLA having had
just one day of rest after a brutal
road trip. As it turned out, one
day's rest was all the team need

imposed its will upon the Bruins,
pulling out a 3-1 victory in front
of a boisterous home crowd.

At first, the third set seemed
as though it was destined to be a
battle. The loud pro-Stanford
crowd, however, began to get

Cardinal had particularly
strong defense at the net, with
six blocks in the set alone, as
Stanford blew UCLA out, 25-14.
The fourth set was more of
the same; UCLA became more
and more flustered by the Stan
ford attack. The Bruin defense
was simply unable to handle the
powerful Cardinal offense, with
important contributions coming
from all Stanford players.
Junior outside hitter Steven
Irvin was especially dominant,
uncorking three of his match
high four aces in the fourth set.
Fittingly, the Cardinal ended
