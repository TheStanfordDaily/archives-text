## Ogwumike named to Wooden Award Midseason Top 20 
### 
Stanford women's basketball's junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike was recognized for her strong performance so far
this season yesterday when she was named to the John R.
Wooden Midseason Top 20 list.
The Cypress, Tex., native leads her team on both points
and rebounds with 22.0 and 11.9 per game, respectively. She
has racked up 13 double-doubles so far this year, including in
a run of ten-straight contests, and, back in November, after
helping Stanford to a win over then-No. 1 Baylor, she was
named espnW's inaugural National Player of the Week.
Ogwumike joins Baylor's senior post Brittney Griner,
Notre Dame's senior guard Skylar Diggins and Delaware's
senior guard/forward Elena Delle Donne on the list. Last
year, all four received WBCA All American honors and
Griner, Diggins and Delle Donne were also named to the
Wooden All American Team.
No. 6 Stanford will look to tighten its grip on the top of the
Pac-12 table this weekend with matches against Utah and
Colorado. The Cardinal currently shares the top spot with
archrival California.
