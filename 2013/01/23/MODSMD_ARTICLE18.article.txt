## 
### â€“ Tom Taylor 
Five-time All American senior Eddie Penev was named
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Gymnast of the Week
for the second straight time yesterday.
The Stanford athlete's performance against No. 4 Oklaho
ma, No. 9 Nebraska and No. 10 California last weekend
helped the No. 2 Cardinal to a quad-meet victory, opening its
season with two straight wins.
His two second-placed finishes on floor exercise and par
allel bars also brought him a second all-around title of the sea
son, with an all-around score that puts him second in the
country this season. He is also ranked second in the NCAA on
floor and third on all-around.
Next up, Stanford will travel to Ann Arbor, Mich., to face
No. 3 Michigan this Saturday.
