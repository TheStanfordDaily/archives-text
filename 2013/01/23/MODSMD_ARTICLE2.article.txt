# Reflections seminars program expanded

### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
The Stanford 101 Reflections
seminar for freshmen returned this
year with more offerings, thanks in
part to last year's successful pilot.
According to the program's site, 100
percent of previous participants who
responded to a post-seminar survey
stated that they were glad they chose
to be a part of Reflections.
The program debuted in winter

quarter of 2012, offering the 50 fresh
men who signed up three 90-minute
sessions to discuss big-picture ques
tions about life at Stanford. As a
result of overwhelmingly positive
feedback, Reflections filled up much
more quickly this year. Eight of nine
winter quarter seminars were full at
time of publication.
Kirsti Copeland, director of resi
dentially based advising, believes
that this is due to earlier recruiting,

word-of-mouth publicity by last
year's participants and the dedicated
efforts of Program Associate Kwad
wo Nana Osei-Opare 'll.
Osei-Opare drew upon his per
sonal experience to explain his pro
found belief in the value of Reflec
tion, which aims to help freshmen ask
questions about their- future plans.
After his graduation from Stanford,
Osei-Opare went to law school for six
months until he realized it wasn't the

right fit for him.
"It's never too late, but it's
always better to start questioning
the next step sooner rather than lat
er," Osei-Opare said.
In addition to increasing the num
ber of classes from five to nine, the
program will also be offered for
spring quarter this year.
Last year, the groups consisted of
10 to 12 freshmen, each co-facilitated
by a trio of one faculty or lecturer,

one staff person and a junior or sen
ior.
This year, many previous partici
pants will be returning as co-facilita
tors in order to relive the experience
from a different perspective.
Sharon Barazani 'l5 recalled feel
ing surprised by the honest personal
revelations that came forth in the
context of the seminar, which seeks
