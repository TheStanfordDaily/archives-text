# Reflections seminars program expanded

### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
The Stanford 101 Reflections
seminar for freshmen returned this
year with more offerings, thanks in
part to last year's successful pilot.
According to the program's site, 100
percent of previous participants who
responded to a post-seminar survey
stated that they were glad they chose
to be a part of Reflections.
The program debuted in winter

quarter of 2012, offering the 50 fresh
men who signed up three 90-minute
sessions to discuss big-picture ques
tions about life at Stanford. As a
result of overwhelmingly positive
feedback, Reflections filled up much
more quickly this year. Eight of nine
winter quarter seminars were full at
time of publication.
Kirsti Copeland, director of resi
dentially based advising, believes
that this is due to earlier recruiting,

word-of-mouth publicity by last
year's participants and the dedicated
efforts of Program Associate Kwad
wo Nana Osei-Opare 'll.
Osei-Opare drew upon his per
sonal experience to explain his pro
found belief in the value of Reflec
tion, which aims to help freshmen ask
questions about their- future plans.
After his graduation from Stanford,
Osei-Opare went to law school for six
months until he realized it wasn't the

right fit for him.
"It's never too late, but it's
always better to start questioning
the next step sooner rather than lat
er," Osei-Opare said.
In addition to increasing the num
ber of classes from five to nine, the
program will also be offered for
spring quarter this year.
Last year, the groups consisted of
10 to 12 freshmen, each co-facilitated
by a trio of one faculty or lecturer,

one staff person and a junior or sen
ior.
This year, many previous partici
pants will be returning as co-facilita
tors in order to relive the experience
from a different perspective.
Sharon Barazani 'l5 recalled feel
ing surprised by the honest personal
revelations that came forth in the
context of the seminar, which seeks
to keep all discussions com
pletely confidential.
"It would be awkward to
talk about that kind of thing
to your friends over dinner
but it seemed perfectly natu
ral in this context," Barazani
said.
Thomas Ehrlich, visiting
professor in the school of edu
cation and one of the pioneers
and co-facilitators of Reflec
tions, said the program was
the perfect setting for this
kind of deep questioning.
"The experience is both
internal and interactive,"
Ehrlich said. "You learn so
much about yourself from
interacting with others in a
safe, comfortable environ
ment."
Austin Block 'l5, a Reflec
tions alumnus and current co
facilitator who also writes for
the Daily, added that the
group setting creates an ideal
bonding environment.
"It's a chance to meet oth
er freshmen whom you would

never have met otherwise
and to have conversations
with them that go deeper
than those you would normal
ly have," Block said.
Ehrlich pointed out that
there is no rigid structure
that the sessions are required
to follow and everyone ulti
mately takes something slight
ly different away from it.
'Although there is a gen
eral framework which
requires that the deeper
questions be addressed, the
discussions are very flexible,"
he said. "It's all about
responding to the students'
needs."
Barazani remembered
feeling overwhelmed by the
question of whether she was
"doing" Stanford right.
"I really didn't know
much about it when I signed
up, but it really made me
think. Like one of the partici
pants said, 'it makes time
slow down,"' Barazani said.
Block added that, while
conserving the low time com
mitment of the initial seminar
is important so it remains
accessible to as many stu
dents as possible, there
should be the option of a

Reflections extension for
those wishing to go on.
"[The questioning] tends
to fade out after a little while,
which is why I think it's
important to keep having
those kinds of meaningful
conversations with people,"
he said.
