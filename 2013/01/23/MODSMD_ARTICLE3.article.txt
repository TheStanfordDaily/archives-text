### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At its Jan. 22 meeting, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate discussed inter
est in their sBok grant programs and vot
ed to fund the purchase of equipment to
furnish a temporary music practice space
in Stern Hall.
Stanford Student Enterprises CEO
and ASSU Financial Manager Neveen
Mahmoud 'll opened the meeting with a
brief financial update and highlighted an
ongoing effort to simplify the ASSU's
finances for student government repre
sentatives.
"It's a huge project of ours, and we'll
hopefully have some great information
for you soon," Mahmoud said.
In a closed portion of the meeting,
senators discussed the nomination of
Eitan Winer Pinkas 'l2 M.S. 'l2 as Mah
moud's replacement. Senators will vote
on the subject next week.
ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 updated the Senate on the
progress of the University's new food
truck policy. While Zimbroff hesitated to
draw conclusions from the program's
first two weeks, he emphasized the signif
icance of upcoming weeks in determining
the pilot program's future.
"The next couple of weeks are defi
nitely going to be indicative whether this
is something that will gain traction with
the student body," Zimbroff said.
Zimbroff also highlighted the upcom
ing Nominations Commission applica
tions, in an effort to avoid replicating last
year's disorganized selection of students
for 40 university committees.
"You guys remember the mess it was
last year," Zimbroff said. "We want to
start early and not get crunched for
time."
Appropriations Committee Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4 drew attention to the
award of nearly $50,000 to student
groups participating in the Senate's
"Redefining Student Life: The 80K Chal
lenge" winter grant program.
"It's been hugely successful," Pham
said, noting that most groups that were
denied funding would be able to request
funds from conventional University
sources.
The Senate voted unanimously to
increase the funding available for the
winter grant program originally set at
$40,000 to $50,000, accommodating the
recommended disbursement of
$49,824.15. The Senate will vote at a
future meeting on a further proposal to
adjust funding for the spring quarter
program to a total of $75,000.
"I'm assuming there's going to be a
ton more funding [requested]," Pham
said.
Communications Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5 updated senators on the
progress of the Senate's new website, dis
cussing the possible inclusion of a petition
form to solicit ideas from the student
body. The much-maligned Senate website
is now nearing completion, according to
Bindra.
The Senate quickly allocated a maxi
mum of $1,500 from discretionary Stu
dent Life Committee funds in order to
purchase instruments and equipment for
an interim practice space in Stern Hall,
after a lack of practice space frustrated
student arts groups last quarter. The
Senate passed the bill unanimously.
