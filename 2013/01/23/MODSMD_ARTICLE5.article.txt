## Substance-free housing likely to stay in Mirrielees 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's substance-free housing program,
which was launched this year in the Mirrielees apart
ment complex, will likely continue next year, accord
ing to Residential Education Mirrielees Area Coor
dinator Tiffany Taylor.
Taylor said that Mirrielees would probably host
the program again, although Residential & Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) will wait to hear feedback from
students in the program before deciding if it will be
expanded or relocated next year.
Substance-free residents will be asked to submit
an online evaluation discussing their general experi
ence in the program, their opinions on the program's
strengths and weaknesses and their ideas about
what changes should be made for future years.
While the evaluations will provide more compre
hensive feedback, Taylor said that the program has
been successful thus far, as the 24 residents have
upheld their agreement not to return to the resi
dence in possession of or under the influence of
banned substances, including alcohol, cigarettes and
illicit drugs.
Taylor credits much of the program's success to
the residents. The current residents had to pre
assign and submit the substance-free agreement,
and Taylor expects a similar process for next year's
program to make sure that residents are committed
to a substance-free environment.
"Right now, I think the key portion is ensuring
the right people are placed in that space," Taylor
