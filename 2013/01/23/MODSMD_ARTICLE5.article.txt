## Substance-free housing likely to stay in Mirrielees 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's substance-free housing program,
which was launched this year in the Mirrielees apart
ment complex, will likely continue next year, accord
ing to Residential Education Mirrielees Area Coor
dinator Tiffany Taylor.
Taylor said that Mirrielees would probably host
the program again, although Residential & Dining
Enterprises (R&DE) will wait to hear feedback from
students in the program before deciding if it will be
expanded or relocated next year.
Substance-free residents will be asked to submit
an online evaluation discussing their general experi
ence in the program, their opinions on the program's
strengths and weaknesses and their ideas about
what changes should be made for future years.
While the evaluations will provide more compre
hensive feedback, Taylor said that the program has
been successful thus far, as the 24 residents have
upheld their agreement not to return to the resi
dence in possession of or under the influence of
banned substances, including alcohol, cigarettes and
illicit drugs.
Taylor credits much of the program's success to
the residents. The current residents had to pre
assign and submit the substance-free agreement,
and Taylor expects a similar process for next year's
program to make sure that residents are committed
to a substance-free environment.
"Right now, I think the key portion is ensuring
the right people are placed in that space," Taylor
said. "We have really seen
the current residents help it
to take shape and grow."
While it is too early to
predict the size of the pro
gram next year, Ralph Cas
tro, director of the Office of
Alcohol Policy and Educa
tion (OAPE), said in a state
ment to The Daily that the
program could expand if
demand is high.
However, residents wor
ry that some of the pro
gram's success is contingent
on its small size.
"Having a hallway with
only 24 people is a really
great number because it's
not too small and it's not too
big," Amy Nguyen 'l5, a cur
rent substance-free resident
said. "I think having an
entire dorm would be a little
bit harder to maintain."
Nguyen said that she is

generally satisfied with the
program, though she misses
the experience of living in a
dorm. Nguyen said that the
apartment-style living in
Mirrielees can be isolating,
especially since the sub
stance-free program hasn't
hosted many events for resi
dents.
Although Nguyen misses
the lively environment of a
typical dorm, at times she
enjoys the quiet of the sub
stance-free floor. She said
that the other students in
the program are friendly
and they communicate
through a mailing list and a
whiteboard in the hallway.
"I didn't have doubts that
it would be an issue because
everyone is voluntarily
there, so none of us drink,"
Nguyen said. "It's nice living
in a place where there hasn't
been any loud music and
alcohol out in the hallway on
the weekends."
While she has not yet
decided whether or not she
will be applying for the sub

stance-free program again
next year, Nguyen said she
would be more likely to
apply if the program were
held in a dorm. She believes
that a substance-free dorm
would be an ideal option for
many students, and she
would recommend that the
program even be opened to
freshmen who are truly com
mitted to the substance-free
lifestyle.
"It would be good to have
a comfortable place for
them, as long as there was a
way to make sure that they
are there because they want
to be there and not because
their parents want them to,"
she said.
In his statement to The
Daily, Castro said that the
program will remain upper
classmen-only for now, as he
considers the current fresh
man housing structure opti
mal for building community
and promoting bonding.
