## Palo Alto sees increase in property crime Police Department reports zero homicides for third consecutive year 
### OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto saw a spike in property crimes
during 2012, with a 52-percent increase in res
idential burglaries since 2011, a 26-percent
increase in automobile thefts and an 11-per
cent increase in larceny, according to the Palo
Alto Police Department (PAPD). Nine residen
tial burglaries have been reported in 2013,
according to a map published on the PAPD
website last updated on Jan. 18.
Although the PAPD has not identified a
cause for the increase in crime, PAPD Ser
geant Brian Philip said that it might be
because Palo Alto citizens have gained a repu
tation as easy targets, an issue that he said
many cities along the Peninsula face.
"Prom what we have heard from suspects
we have arrested, our cities are considered
what they call 'softer targets,'" Philip said.
"Word is out on the streets that Peninsula
cities are good places to go get stuff."
Some Stanford students also share the per
ception that Palo Alto is a safe and generally
crime-free city.
"I haven't ever felt unsafe there," said Ari
ana Bhatia 'l6, who goes into Palo Alto approx
imately twice a month. "You always have to be
aware of what is going on around you in any
city, but I feel like it is pretty safe there so far."
Laura Kurt 'l4, who goes into Palo Alto
about three times a week, said that she has
"always felt safe" in Palo Alto, especially on
University Avenue. However, she has known
friends who have had their bike seats or other
parts stolen while the bike was parked at the
Palo Alto Caltrain station.
Stanford students have been most affected
by auto burglaries, bike thefts and petty
thefts, according to Philip.

Students who go into Palo Alto are often
the victims of laptop theft or pickpocketing in
restaurants, he said. Thieves sit at tables near
students and wait for an opportunity to pick
pocket their purses, wallets and bags.
The Stanford Shopping Center was also a
target area for auto burglaries during the 2012
holiday season, Philip said. Many of the victim
ized shoppers left their purchases in plain view
in the parking lot.
"People like to come here and shop here
and eat here, we get a lot of traffic on weekend
and that causes our property crimes to go up,"
he said.
There were 48 reported automobile thefts

'in 2012, an increase from the 38 reported
thefts in 2011. The number of larcenies, includ
ing thefts of items from vehicles, also
increased from 943 in 2011 to 1043 in 2012.
"Auto burglaries have been absolutely off
the charts," Philip said. "The [thieves] are
hammering our downtown public parking
lots."
However, residential burglaries worry the
PAPD the most. Police were especially con
cerned by a recent series of stealthy burgla
ries, in which criminals entered houses while
the victims were sleeping and sometimes used
