# DESIGN YOUR MIND
## DESIGNING CHANGE 
### Soo Ji Lin | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It started with a conversation with a
high-school friend over winter break.
Former student leader Aidan Baker 'l4
decided to bring Design for America
(DFA) to Stanford after his high-school
friend at Northwestern University told him
how DFA, founded there in 2009, had
begun planning expansion to other cam
puses.
At the start of winter quarter in 2011,
Baker discussed with faculty the idea of a
Stanford studio. Stanford was one of the
first schools to be designated a DFA cam
pus chapter along with seven other flag
ship studios. Kickoff began spring quarter;
the initial group of five has grown to about
30 in less than two years.
It is now present across 14 campuses
across the country, from Barnard and
Columbia to Berkeley. DFA's founding
professor, Dr. Elizabeth Gerber of
Northwestern, previously worked at
Stanford's d.school and received her mas
ter's and doctoral degrees in Product
Design. The group receives outside men
toring from some members of the

d.school, but the group is completely stu
dent-driven and student-led. Many of

DFA's events are held at the d.school.
"Our goal is to spread design think
ing ... to make everyone an innovator to
make local and social change," said DFA
president Tyler Haydell 'l5.
Haydell attended the 2012 DFA
Leadership Studio this past summer at
Northwestern; one or two students from
each campus learned DFA values and
processes through brainstorming how to
improve the lives of the elderly.
"This national network of studios is a
great way to interact and for us to work
with them," said Haydell.
At the main studio at Northwestern,
some projects have lead to Kickstarter
campaigns and products in the incubation
phase of getting seed funding.
"DFA as a whole has made a name
for itself among the design community at
the collegiate level. It's something we're
proud to be in conjunction with," Baker
said.
During its first year, DFA worked on
projects dealing with issues such as reduc
ing food waste and making children wait
ing rooms sanitary. One challenge Baker
faced had to do with the fact that DFA was

in its pilot stage.
"There weren't any resources on cam
pus. The only resource that I had was the
people at Northwestern," Baker said.
Teams of five four students and
one student leader work on projects.
This year's projects focus on addressing
skin cancer, getting people to buy locally
grown food, reducing wasted water in
bathrooms, encouraging creativity in kids
and redesigning after-school experiences
for teachers. Studio leaders run organiza
tional aspects like event planning and
recruitment while project leaders, more
experienced in design, tackle a local issue.
"Not every project will be successful.
That's inherent to us being a student-run
organization and also to the design
process," Haydell said.
DFA also implements design thinking
in running the organization itself —
always looking for improvements. In its
first year as an official student group, DFA
has seen new leadership, a new organiza
tional structure and eligibility for funding.
Previously, leaders had to fund out of their
own pockets, but DFA is undergoing ini
tiatives like selling t-shirts.

Despite the group's young status,
their annual kickoff workshop gave many
attendees a taste of the design process and
recruited many new members. After the
workshop, over 30 people applied for 13
new member spots on the five project
teams.
"It's interesting to see the potential
that small groups of undergrad students
who have the gumption to go through
their projects," Baker said. "That's what
draws people to DFA."
Although about 20 people did not
make the rounds after interviews and
application reads, DFA wants to integrate
them into their community somehow.
One idea is to host monthly mini design
athons in which these members could
compete with each other; winning teams
could be the first considered for a spot on
a project team or be given the chance to
start their own project team.
"We want to include everyone so
we're trying to expand DFA as much as
possible," said Katie Kirsch 'l6, director of
external communications and a member
of the education in classroom project
team.
