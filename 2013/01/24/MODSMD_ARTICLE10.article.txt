## TIME TO BUFF UP CARD CAN BUILD ON CAL WIN 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Fresh off a rejuvenating victo
ry over Bay Area rival California,
the men's basketball team heads
out onto the road to face another
Pac-12 foe: Colorado.
While it's normally quite chilly
in Boulder this time of year, the
mercury has actually been hover
ing a bit higher in the "Centennial
State" than it has been on the
Farm, although the Cardinal is
hoping the Buffaloes continue to
be cold from the field tonight.
Colorado is last in the confer
ence in three-point shooting (25.8
percent) while Stanford is riding
the hot hand of John Gage (4-4
from behind the arc last game) to
a nice 40.2 percent clip on the year.
But if history is any indication,
the game won't be easy for the
home side and rebounding figures
to be the main storyline from
tonight's matchup at the Coors
Events Center.
Last year, the Cardinal man
aged to manhandle the Buffs in
both regular season matchups
despite Colorado finishing the
year with a better record and
making a surprising run in the
NCAA Tournament.
"They whipped our ass, there's
no politically correct way to say
it," Colorado head coach Tad
Boyle said. "They whipped it in
every way, shape and form. At
home, on the road, rebounding,
offense, defense, loose balls you
name it."
The two scores (84-64 at Stan
ford, 74-50 in Boulder) did a decent
job of describing the Cardinal's
dominance, as well as the 85-53
two-game edge in rebounding.
"When we played them here, it
wasn't a great feeling seeing your
fans leave not even halfway into

the second half," CU junior wing
Andre Roberson said. "It was just
kind of disappointing. We let
(Buffs fans) down with that.
"This year, I feel like we're
going to come ready to play ...
capitalize on the game plan and
come out ready to compete. We
know what they're all about; we
have to be physical and aggres
sive."
But it was the backcourt duo of
junior Aaron Bright and sopho
more Chasson Randle who really
gashed the Buffs last year and
allowed the frontcourt to thrive.
Bright averaged 11.5 points and
4.0 assists while shooting 6-12
from the field. Randle averaged
19.0 points while connecting on 13-
21 overall.
Nevertheless, it will be impor
tant for Stanford's "bigs" to step
up and fill the void left by graduat
ed seniors Andrew Zimmerman
and Josh Owens, who were the
main contributors down low for
the Cardinal last season and at 6-
foot-8 and over 230 pounds each,
gave the Buffs plenty of trouble in
the paint and spread the floor for
Bright and Randle to drive.
At 6-foot-10, junior Dwight
Powell has made the transition
from the small forward position to
the power forward and center spot
this season, and Boyle said he is
"much improved" from last season
and a threat on the offensive end.
Powell is averaging a team
high 16 points in Pac-12 competi
tion and collecting 8.6 rebounds a
game. Teamed with junior Josh
Huestis, who is averaging 9.8
rebounds per game, Stanford is
fourth in rebounding margin
(plus-1.8) while Colorado is eighth
(minus-2.0).
But despite the downward

trending stats, the Buffs
started the season off in the
top-25 and are a dangerous
squad. They have lost just
once at home in eight games,
and beat Dayton, Baylor and
Murray State to earn the
Charleston Classic title in
the preseason.
Led by Spencer Dinwid
die on the offensive end, 14.6
points per game, the Buffs
are averaging over 70 points
per game this year.
Diwiddie said the page on
last season's lopsided losses
to the Cardinal has been
turned and the Buffs aren't
dwelling on redemption:
"It's a new year, new team.
We fully understand what
happened last year. We
understand we got out
bounded on the glass and
they blew us out both times.
We're looking to come out
and play physical and tough
and set the tone."
Colorado's most recent
win in the series with the
Cardinal came on Dec. 23,
1990, with the Buffs booking
an 89-79 decision in Boulder.
Stanford hopes to extend the
drought tonight with tip-off
from Colorado coming at 8
p.m. MST on ESPNU.
