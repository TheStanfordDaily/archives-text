# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## No. 1 Card opens season 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
On paper, the Stanford women's water polo
team has one of the most impressive rosters ever
assembled in collegiate water polo. But champi
onships are not won on paper, and on Friday, the
preseason No. 1 Cardinal will dive in against No. 11
Michigan to kickoff its quest for a third consecutive
national title.
The Cardinal added three Olympic gold medal
ists Annika Dries, Melissa Seidemann and Mag
gie Steffens to a squad that went 26-2 last sea
son behind 2012 National Player of the Year Kiley
Neushul and National Collegiate Championship
MVP Kate Baldoni.
Stanford coach John Tanner said he began
recruiting some of those
players when they were in
seventh and eighth grade.
Now that he finally has them
all in the same pool, the
potential for greatness is
exhilarating.
"Susan Ortwein, our asso
ciate head coach, babysat
[Neushul] when she was a
newborn," Tanner laughed.
"This is something that has
been a long time in the mak
ing and now we're excited
about the prospect of it."

With so much talent on
the roster, Tanner's biggest
test may be managing team
chemistry.
"We were all the best play
ers at oui* high schools, but
that's the challenge coming
into this program sup
pressing those egos and get
ting everybody to work
together as a team," Neushul,
a sophomore, said. "I think
we've done a very good job of
that to this point, but our
biggest test will obviously be
once we start playing games."
Tanner will deploy his
superstars based on how
opponents choose to defend
them.
"There are some teams
that will say [the best players]
will get their points, so I'm
going to try to stop everyone
else, while other teams will

throw everything into stop
ping [those players]." Tanner
said. "We have other people
who will step up, so it's just a
matter of having patience and
seeing where those openings
are."
According to Tanner, the
Cardinal's first opponent,
Michigan, will likely play a
wide-open, fast-paced style of
play with an emphasis on cre
ating scoring chances.
"There are times when a
team like that would just park
the bus in front of the goal
and just hope to stay in it as
long as possible," Tanner said.
"But I think [Michigan] will
come out and go for it and
play their style, so we're
excited to open the season
with them."
During the fall, Tanner
said the Cardinal worked
players back into the system
by focusing heavily on situa
tional play. Only recently did
the team begin working on
transitional play, something
Tanner considered a weak
ness during preseason scrim
mages.
"I feel pretty good about
our front-court defense and
our 6-on-5 and our counter
attack, and if we just played
10 [situational] possessions,
I think we would do really
well," Tanner said. "But I
have no idea how we will get
from one situation to the
next our transitions could
be really shaky."
The Wolverines bring
four games of experience

into Friday's matchup.
Michigan began its season
with a 15-9 win over Col
orado State before falling
to No. 3 UCLA, No. 9 San
Jose State and No. 7 San
Diego State last weekend.
The Wolverines have never
beaten the Cardinal in nine
tries.

But Michigan certainly
has some firepower and
experience, led by senior
Kiki Golden, who has
scored 156 career goals.
Wolverine juniors Kelsey
Nolan and Audrey Pratt
also scored in all four of
Michigan's games last
weekend. Senior goalkeep

er Alex Adamson mans the
net for the Wolverines.
The match will begin at 2
p.m. at the Avery Aquatic
Center.
"[The players' opportuni
ties] over the last 18 months
leading up to this have added
a lot of diversity within our
team, but also a lot of energy

and experience," Tanner
said. "It's been a long time
since our championship back
in May, so we're looking for
ward to playing Michigan on
Friday and getting this thing
under way."
