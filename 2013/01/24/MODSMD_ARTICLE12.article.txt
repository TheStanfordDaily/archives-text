# Manti Te'o controversy flat-out sad
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
By now it seems like every
one and their fake online
girlfriend has written
something about the Man
ti Te'o/Lennay Kekua
scandal, but I still feel the need to
throw my helmet in the ring.
Since the news of the scandal broke
last week, all that's been talked about is
whether Te'o was complicit in the trick
ery or was just a victim of someone
else's cruel ploy The evidence points
strongly to the latter, but the more we
find out about this hoax the less I care
about the evidence.
Because either way, I feel really
really bad for Manti Te'o.
The media has such a chip on its
shoulder for missing this story
rather, unknowingly misreporting it —
for several months that it's determined
to pin down the truth, once and for all.
That's the media's job. Even the ana
lysts are playing judge on this one, and
if there's any sympathy expressed for
Te'o it always comes packaged with the
token "if he's telling the truth."
That skepticism has, as it often is,
been passed on to the public. But here
at Stanford —one of the 13 teams Te'o
played against this season, and a school
that was supposedly Kekua's alma
mater —99 percent of us had never
heard of Te'o's girlfriend until a week
ago. Most of us at The Daily even with
in the spoils section, had never heard
the name "Lennay Kekua." So why do
so many of the people I talk to feel
angry at Te'o or almost offended by
this whole thing? %u can't be misled if
you weren't led in the first place, so
even if Te'o was lying all along it really
isn't a personal matter for any of us.
But it is a profoundly personal mat
ter for Manti Te'o, which is why this
story regardless of what you believe
his part was in the proceedings, is flat
out sad.
We know that Te'o had been lying
since December, when he received a
phone call from Lennay several
months after she had supposedly died.
This came just two days before the
Heisman Trophy ceremony, when
Te'o's stoiy was getting as much cover
age as ever. How could you expect a kid
our age, fresh off the shock of discover
ing someone he loved never really
existed, to come clean and just ask for
widespread embarrassment during his
first significant foray into the national
spotlight, after he had done nothing
wrong himself?
And over the next month, as Notre
Dame prepared to play in the BCS
Championship Game, it would've been
nothing short of selfish for Te'o to
come forward and draw attention
away from his team's accomplish
ments that season and its national title
hopes. So to avoid that distraction, he
had to knowingly continue the very
farce that had turned his life
wpside down for well over a month,
all the while knowing the story could
come out at any moment, as it did
last week. If that's not poetic injus
tice, I don't know what is.
(What's lost in this is that Te'o's
crowning achievement playing
