# Manti Te'o controversy flat-out sad
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
By now it seems like every
one and their fake online
girlfriend has written
something about the Man
ti Te'o/Lennay Kekua
scandal, but I still feel the need to
throw my helmet in the ring.
Since the news of the scandal broke
last week, all that's been talked about is
whether Te'o was complicit in the trick
ery or was just a victim of someone
else's cruel ploy The evidence points
strongly to the latter, but the more we
find out about this hoax the less I care
about the evidence.
Because either way, I feel really
really bad for Manti Te'o.
The media has such a chip on its
shoulder for missing this story
rather, unknowingly misreporting it —
for several months that it's determined
to pin down the truth, once and for all.
That's the media's job. Even the ana
lysts are playing judge on this one, and
if there's any sympathy expressed for
Te'o it always comes packaged with the
token "if he's telling the truth."
That skepticism has, as it often is,
been passed on to the public. But here
at Stanford —one of the 13 teams Te'o
played against this season, and a school
that was supposedly Kekua's alma
mater —99 percent of us had never
heard of Te'o's girlfriend until a week
ago. Most of us at The Daily even with
in the spoils section, had never heard
the name "Lennay Kekua." So why do
so many of the people I talk to feel
angry at Te'o or almost offended by
this whole thing? %u can't be misled if
you weren't led in the first place, so
even if Te'o was lying all along it really
isn't a personal matter for any of us.
But it is a profoundly personal mat
ter for Manti Te'o, which is why this
story regardless of what you believe
his part was in the proceedings, is flat
out sad.
We know that Te'o had been lying
since December, when he received a
phone call from Lennay several
months after she had supposedly died.
This came just two days before the
Heisman Trophy ceremony, when
Te'o's stoiy was getting as much cover
age as ever. How could you expect a kid
our age, fresh off the shock of discover
ing someone he loved never really
existed, to come clean and just ask for
widespread embarrassment during his
first significant foray into the national
spotlight, after he had done nothing
wrong himself?
And over the next month, as Notre
Dame prepared to play in the BCS
Championship Game, it would've been
nothing short of selfish for Te'o to
come forward and draw attention
away from his team's accomplish
ments that season and its national title
hopes. So to avoid that distraction, he
had to knowingly continue the very
farce that had turned his life
wpside down for well over a month,
all the while knowing the story could
come out at any moment, as it did
last week. If that's not poetic injus
tice, I don't know what is.
(What's lost in this is that Te'o's
crowning achievement playing
through the death of his
grandmother and girlfriend
on the same day is no less
impressive now than it was
then, because he truly
believed Lennay was dead.)
Let's turn back the
timetable a little bit, to the
only other lie we know for
sure Te'o has told: He admit
ted recently that he had nev
er met Lennay in person
despite having led his parents
to believe otherwise. I know
that public figures such as
Te'o submit their personal
lives for scrutiny especial
ly when they continue to tell
their story, as Te'o did but
would you really like the last
innocent lie you told your par
ents to become national news?

It's also been suggested
that Te'o, a Samoan, Mormon
football player at a Catholic
university, was sheltered
when it came to his love life,
and that he was somehow at
fault for falling for this whole
thing. I am honestly not qual
ified to discuss those cultural
stigmas, but love isn't some
thing you're taught it's
something you feel. And if

Manti Te'o says he loved
Lennay Kekua, that's good
enough for me.
We've all been blinded by
love before, made fools of our
selves. The sad part is that
when it happened to Manti
Te'o, it became the whole
world's business.
And as for the few hold
outs who still believe Te'o was
complicit in the hoax? If you
believe that's truly the case,
you're saying that one of the
best defenders in the country
— and Te'o was considered as
such even before this season
— playing for the most scru
tinized team in college foot
ball still found the need to
attract more attention for
himself. You're saying that
such a skilled player was
forced to live an extended lie
and tell it to teammates, fam
ily and friends, for the sake of
the Heisman, the NFL, what
ever.
If that's the pressure col
lege athletes are put under,
that's as sad as anything.
