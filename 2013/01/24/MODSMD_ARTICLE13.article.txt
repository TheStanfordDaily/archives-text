# CARD HOSTS THREE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After a nice 7-0 win over Sacra
mento State to open the season last
week, the No. 10 men's tennis team
is back on the court tomorrow and
Saturday, hosting a pair of matches
as part of the ITA Kick-Off Week
end at Taube Tennis Stadium.
One of 15 host sites around the
country, Stanford is hosting No. 27
San Diego, No. 29 Texas Tech and
No. 26 Texas A&M with San Diego
and Texas Tech squaring off Friday
morning before Stanford and the
Aggies meet in the afternoon. The
winners will play Saturday to
determine who advances to the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships, which will be held Feb. 15-
18 in Seattle.
Stanford's pod is definitely one
of the toughest in the draw, with
each team ranked in the top 30, but
the Cardinal will benefit from being
at home and has some momentum
after last week as well as sopho
more Robert Stineman's run to the
Consolation Final at the Sherwood
Cup earlier this week.
Head coach John Whitlinger
was impressed with Stineman dur
ing the preseason. "Robert has
improved," Whitlinger said. "He
knew what he had to work on over
the summer, and to his credit, real
ly got out there and put in the time

his season-opening match against Sacramento
State, but bounced back to earn his first victory of
the season against Marek Marksoo in three sets.
to work hard and get better. I
think Robert is primed for a
pretty good year as well, and
I'm ready for some big
things from him."
If the Card is to advance
this weekend, however,
Stineman's classmate John
Morrissey will also need to
step up. Morrissey is the lone
nationally-ranked player on
the roster right now, and
Whitlinger said he was hope
ful that even with just a year
of varsity experience Morris
sey could thrive.

"John had a good fall,"
Whitlinger said. "He played
well at the ITA All-American
Championships and ended
up winning a round after get
ting through the qualifying
portion. John is getting bet
ter and better. He's coming
off a big year and I'm inter
ested in seeing what he can
do higher in the lineup."
It won't be easy against
the Aggies.
"We are very excited to
get the season underway,"
Aggie men's tennis head
coach Steve Denton said.
"Our team has been beating
up on each other during our
preseason camp. Coach
(Bob) McKinley and I are
very impressed on how well

our young team has compet
ed thus far against each oth
er. We have had some very
spirited practice sessions."
The Aggies return seven
members from last season's
14-15 squad that advanced to
the second round of the
NCAA tournament before
falling to the eventual nation
al champions in USC. Head
lining the group of returners
are sophomores Jeremy
Efferding and Jordan Szabo,
ranked No. 87 and No. 103,
respectively, in the preseason
ITA singles rankings.
In addition, junior Junior
Ore and sophomore Behzad
Minavi, who claimed the sin
gles (Ore) and doubles
(Ore/Minavi) championships

at the Rice/MET Indoor Ten
nis Tournament last week
end, look to use that victory
as a springboard for the
upcoming season. Other
notable returners with varsi
ty experience are senior
Niall Angus, junior Alberto
Bautista and sophomore
Jackson Withrow.
Regardless of who steps
onto the court for A&M,
Stanford is eager to return to
relevance in the tournament,
having last captured the
hardware at this tournament
in 2002 with a 4-3 win over
Illinois.
