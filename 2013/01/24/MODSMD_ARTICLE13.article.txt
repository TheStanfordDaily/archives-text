### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After a nice 7-0 win over Sacra
mento State to open the season last
week, the No. 10 men's tennis team
is back on the court tomorrow and
Saturday, hosting a pair of matches
as part of the ITA Kick-Off Week
end at Taube Tennis Stadium.
One of 15 host sites around the
country, Stanford is hosting No. 27
San Diego, No. 29 Texas Tech and
No. 26 Texas A&M with San Diego
and Texas Tech squaring off Friday
morning before Stanford and the
Aggies meet in the afternoon. The
winners will play Saturday to
determine who advances to the
National Team Indoor Champi
onships, which will be held Feb. 15-
18 in Seattle.
Stanford's pod is definitely one
of the toughest in the draw, with
each team ranked in the top 30, but
the Cardinal will benefit from being
at home and has some momentum
after last week as well as sopho
more Robert Stineman's run to the
Consolation Final at the Sherwood
Cup earlier this week.
Head coach John Whitlinger
was impressed with Stineman dur
ing the preseason. "Robert has
improved," Whitlinger said. "He
knew what he had to work on over
the summer, and to his credit, real
ly got out there and put in the time
