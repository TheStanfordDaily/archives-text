# OPINIONS
## I WANT TO GO TO THERE The 						rhetoric of abortion: Not pro-choice anymore 
### Annie Graham 
So these nine white guys walk
into a room ... and out comes
the decision that a woman's
choice to have an abortion is pro
tected under the 14th Amendment.
This seems to me one of the
least likely results of putting nine
dudes in a room for a few hours
in history. There's that whole his
torical patriarchy thing, and then
there's the recently resurgent
breed of crazy in US politics the
one that denies the importance of
birth control or a woman's right to
manage her own reproductive
health.
Considering the recent history
of conservative male politicians dis
cussing "legitimate rape," and how
the female body has ways to "shut
that whole thing down," it's amaz
ing to think that nine male judges
in 1973 determined that yes,
women should have the right to
choose a safe and legal abortion.
But of course it's not that sim
ple. Nothing is. And even as Tues
day was the 40th anniversary of
Roe v. Wade, a woman's right to a
safe and legal abortion is consis
tently being attacked by opposing
legislative forces.
Essentially, the anti-abortion
agenda consists of making abor
tions more and more difficult to
obtain until no one can reasonably
obtain one. Since local politicians
can regulate abortion legislation in
their region, barriers to safe and
legal abortion have been applied in
more conservative counties first.
Despite Roe v. Wade, anti-abor
tion beliefs can effectively scale
back the rights of women.
Most often these beliefs are
packaged and delivered to the pub
lic as "pro-life," and while that
stance spouts from a genuine belief,
it seems a tangential discussion to
the "pro-choice" opposition; the
traditional labels for both sides do
not necessarily involve them in a
discussion with each other.
In my mind, the implied
exchange goes something like this:
Person A: "I fight for life!"
Person B: "Oh yeah, well, I fight
for choice!"
Person C: "Cool story, bros."
Thus has the semantic dance of
the abortion debate evolved.
While the binary opposition in
this battle has historically been
pro-life versus pro-choice, Planned
Parenthood recently announced
that it would stop using the label
"pro-choice," explaining that the
term reinforces binary opposition
instead of respecting a larger spec
trum of beliefs in the abortion
debate.
Rather than continuing to
organize around the term "pro
choice," Planned Parenthood hopes
to expand the narrative spectrum
of the unique circumstances women
face. Rhetorical phrasing has shift
ed to the phrase "reproductive jus
tice," respecting that women
should have this right, but that dif
ferent women face different choic
es. One critique of "pro-choice,"
summed up by Tracy Weitz, seems
particularly important:
"Pro-choice is a label that
connects most directly to the
situation of middle- and
upper-class women. Childbear
ing is an obligation for white

women, thus abortion is the
alternative choice. However,
for women of color, whose
reproduction has been con
trolled across time, abortion is
not the only right for which
women need to fight. Rather
women need to be able to have
a child, not have a child, and
parent the children they have."
Expanding the narrow term
"pro-choice" to the broader label of
"reproductive justice" respects the
multitude of women who may ulti
mately face the choice of abortion,
and heeds the importance of direct
causes such as lack of access to con
traception as well as larger sys
temic issues.
Meanwhile, a physical form of
abortion debate played out in
White Plaza on Tuesday. Stanford
Students for Life set up a mock
graveyard to represent the abor
tions of unborn fetuses, while Stu
dents for Reproductive Justice had
an information table and a
fundraiser benefiting a New
Orleans abortion clinic. Our cam
pus also had a special guest in the
fundamentalist zealot on Dinkel
spiel steps, who rattled off the
greatest hits of ultra-conservatism
to mourn Roe v. Wade.
And though he showed up on the
anniversary of Roe v. Wade,
decrying the same decision Stan
ford Students for Life did, I know
the physical distance between them
represented the deeper chasm of
his crazy hate, which they would
not support.
But even respecting their intel
lect, I can never understand the
mock graveyard. As a Catholic high
school graduate, I'm accustomed to
the appearance of similar rows of
crosses every Roe v. Wade
anniversary, and I am always dis
turbed. Not disturbed that women
had the right to choose to end a
pregnancy for any number of rea
sons, but disturbed at the graves as
uniformly representative figures,
as if the decision to have an abor
tion is one type of decision for one
type of woman.
Women are black and brown and
white and wealthy and poor and
capable of making decisions. The
fight for reproductive justice aims
to ensure that all are equally
equipped with the resources to do
so.

birth control or a woman's right to
manage her own reproductive
health.
Considering the recent history
of conservative male politicians dis
cussing "legitimate rape," and how
the female body has ways to "shut
that whole thing down," it's amaz
ing to think that nine male judges
in 1973 determined that yes,
women should have the right to
choose a safe and legal abortion.
But of course it's not that sim
ple. Nothing is. And even as Tues
day was the 40th anniversary of
Roe v. Wade, a woman's right to a
safe and legal abortion is consis
tently being attacked by opposing
legislative forces.
Essentially, the anti-abortion
agenda consists of making abor
tions more and more difficult to
obtain until no one can reasonably
obtain one. Since local politicians
can regulate abortion legislation in
their region, barriers to safe and
legal abortion have been applied in
more conservative counties first.
Despite Roe v. Wade, anti-abor
tion beliefs can effectively scale
back the rights of women.
Most often these beliefs are
packaged and delivered to the pub
lic as "pro-life," and while that
stance spouts from a genuine belief,
it seems a tangential discussion to
the "pro-choice" opposition; the
traditional labels for both sides do
not necessarily involve them in a
discussion with each other.
In my mind, the implied
exchange goes something like this:
Person A: "I fight for life!"
Person B: "Oh yeah, well, I fight
for choice!"
Person C: "Cool story, bros."
Thus has the semantic dance of
the abortion debate evolved.
While the binary opposition in
this battle has historically been
pro-life versus pro-choice, Planned
Parenthood recently announced
that it would stop using the label
"pro-choice," explaining that the
term reinforces binary opposition
instead of respecting a larger spec
trum of beliefs in the abortion
debate.
Rather than continuing to
organize around the term "pro
choice," Planned Parenthood hopes
to expand the narrative spectrum
of the unique circumstances women
face. Rhetorical phrasing has shift
ed to the phrase "reproductive jus
tice," respecting that women
should have this right, but that dif
ferent women face different choic
es. One critique of "pro-choice,"
summed up by Tracy Weitz, seems
particularly important:
"Pro-choice is a label that
connects most directly to the
situation of middle- and
upper-class women. Childbear
ing is an obligation for white

women, thus abortion is the
alternative choice. However,
for women of color, whose
reproduction has been con
trolled across time, abortion is
not the only right for which
women need to fight. Rather
women need to be able to have
a child, not have a child, and
parent the children they have."
Expanding the narrow term
"pro-choice" to the broader label of
"reproductive justice" respects the
multitude of women who may ulti
mately face the choice of abortion,
and heeds the importance of direct
causes such as lack of access to con
traception as well as larger sys
temic issues.
Meanwhile, a physical form of
abortion debate played out in
White Plaza on Tuesday. Stanford
Students for Life set up a mock
graveyard to represent the abor
tions of unborn fetuses, while Stu
dents for Reproductive Justice had
an information table and a
fundraiser benefiting a New
Orleans abortion clinic. Our cam
pus also had a special guest in the
fundamentalist zealot on Dinkel
spiel steps, who rattled off the
greatest hits of ultra-conservatism
to mourn Roe v. Wade.
And though he showed up on the
anniversary of Roe v. Wade,
decrying the same decision Stan
ford Students for Life did, I know
the physical distance between them
represented the deeper chasm of
his crazy hate, which they would
not support.
But even respecting their intel
lect, I can never understand the
mock graveyard. As a Catholic high
school graduate, I'm accustomed to
the appearance of similar rows of
crosses every Roe v. Wade
anniversary, and I am always dis
turbed. Not disturbed that women
had the right to choose to end a
pregnancy for any number of rea
sons, but disturbed at the graves as
uniformly representative figures,
as if the decision to have an abor
tion is one type of decision for one
type of woman.
Women are black and brown and
white and wealthy and poor and
capable of making decisions. The
fight for reproductive justice aims
to ensure that all are equally
equipped with the resources to do
so.
