# THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY
## Feminists should oppose abortion 
### Adam Johnson 
Tuesday marked the 40th
Anniversary of Roe v. Wade,
the 1973 Supreme Court deci
sion that gave women the constitu
tionally protected right to termi
nate their pregnancies. Here at
Stanford, the anniversary did not
go unnoticed. Many of my peers
posted on Facebook how thankful
they were for the decision; some
posted links to "pro-choice" litera
ture. While the pieces I stumbled
upon were respectful, often they
were inadequately argued. In a pri
or column, I criticized a few com
mon arguments that emanate from
the "pro-choice" camp, most
notably the utilitarian and realist
justifications for pervasive abortion
rights.
And for their part, Stanford Stu
dents for Life held a memorial in
White Plaza, ostensibly for the mil
lions of fetuses aborted since the
Supreme Court decision. As I
argued in a second column, these
fetuses some fifty million in
America alone represent lost
human lives at the very least. In
that column, I left open for debate
whether we should grant the same
rights to an unborn fetus as we do

to a baby.
In this, my third column on the
topic of abortion, I will write about
the faulty notion that to be against
abortion is to oppose women. This
crude thinking is quite prevalent:
one need only remember the "war
on women," in which activists cried
foul on politicians who, among other
things, challenged liberal abortion
laws. These activists have stigma
tized the "pro-life" position to the
point where it is now perceived to
be antithetical to any progressive
cause.
This simplistic stance is funda
mentally flawed. For some histori
cal perspective, consider this:
almost all of America's early femi
nists were opposed to the practice
of abortion. Susan B. Anthony
wrote, "no matter what the motive
... the woman is awfully guilty who
commits the deed. But thrice guilty
is he who ... drove her to the desper
ation which impelled her to the
crime." Elizabeth Cady Stanton
had this to say on abortion: "it is
degrading to women that we should
treat our children as property to be
disposed of as we see fit."
And Margaret Sanger, the
founder of Planned Parenthood,
was morally opposed to the proce
dure now associated with her
organization. Though she ultimate
ly believed in a woman's right to
choose, she also opined, "the hun
dreds of thousands of abortions per
formed in America each year are a
disgrace to civilization." These
three are feminist foremothers, yet
all three expressed sentiments that
today would be regarded as "pro
life" and thus disparaged by the
modern feminist movement.
While the contexts of those
times were surely different, the
general messages are still relevant.
Indeed, a small but committed
group of feminists was troubled
enough with the abortion discourse
in the early 1970s to establish Fem
inists for Life. This is not a religious

organization; rather, its mission is
"systematically eliminating the root
causes that drive women to abortion
primarily lack of practical
resources and support through
holistic, woman-centered solu
tions." Surely that is a cause we can
all get behind.
Despite what I have written
here and in the past, I ultimately
believe that the ideal state would
not compel a woman to bring a fetus
to term. And yet, I am highly trou
bled by the abortion institution at
present in the United States. Not
only do I regard a fetus as a human
life, but I also view most of the more
than a million abortions per year as
failures of society to adequately
support women before, during, and
after pregnancies. We fail to pro
vide, among other things, satisfac
tory sexual education, readily avail
able contraception, and adequate
emotional and financial support at
all stages.
A 2004 study offers a bleak out
look on abortions in the United
States. It showed that more than
half of American women who
obtained an abortion perceived it as
morally wrong, 64.0 percent felt
"pressured by others" to have the
procedure, and almost 80 percent
were not counseled on alternatives.
Surprisingly, one fifth of the women
who obtained an abortion desired to
carry the child to term.
Any true feminist should be
bothered by these findings. The
study paints a picture of abortion
not as a voluntary and desirable
choice but as an outcome often driv
en by others and sometimes even in
direct conflict with a woman's sense
of right and wrong.
Is abortion the loss of a
human life through invasive sur
gery a desirable solution to
unwanted pregnancies that result
from underlying societal problems?
It is not, and it is time we stop pre
tending that it is. Yet the abortion
institution at present provides soci
ety with an excuse to ignore the
root causes of unwanted pregnan
cies and opens the door for others to
influence this highly personal
process.
It is time we stand up to this
injustice. Just as we should protect a
women's right to have an abortion,
society should protect her right not
to have one. To steal a phrase from
Feminists for Life, women deserve
better.
