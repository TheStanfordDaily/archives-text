# Law school debuts religious liberty clinic

### SARAH MOORE 
Only a week after the Stanford
Law School launched the nation's
first Religious Liberty Clinic, stu
dents are already engaged in six
legal battles offering real world
practice on the subject of religious
freedom.

Clinic Director James Sonne said
that Stanford has historically been on
the cutting edge of providing practical
clinical education. The new clinic,
which is housed in the Mills Legal Clin
ic, goes beyond what the Law School

regularly offers.
"We think the religious liberty
aspect gives a very unique and
interesting prism through which to
do clinical training," Sonne said.
Sonne sought to differentiate his
clinic from similar offerings at faith
based schools, which largely take
clients with shared religious affilia
tions. By contrast, the Stanford clin
ic has clients with a wide span of
beliefs, including Muslim, Seventh
Day Adventist, Jewish and Native
American practices.
"There's a wide variety because

part of what we want to show not
only to our students but also to the
wider community is the universal
nature of religious liberty," Sonne
said. "For the most part it doesn't
really matter what the religious
practice is that's involved, but what
matters is the freedom to practice,
not only to believe but [to] manifest
that belief."
Judith Romero, Law School
spokesperson, emphasized the pro
fessional benefits of the clinic's
diverse range of clients.
"The history of religious liberty

in this country offers a rich canvas
upon which our students can learn
how to be first-rate professionals in
service to those in need, particularly
the misrepresented or underrepre
sented," Romero said in a statement
to The Daily.
In addition to a variety of faiths, the
clinic's focus on religious liberty also
focuses the historical significance within
the American legal system of that consti
tutional freedom.
The cases the clinic is currently
working on include a Native Ameri
can prohibited from ceremonial pipe

smoking and a group of Seventh
Day Adventist employees who do
not want to work on then- Sabbath.
The clinic's student involvement
has been relatively small, with four
students admitted winter quarter
and six admitted for spring quarter.
"They had no idea other than
just the name and a two-paragraph
summary about what it was going to
be, so that they signed up a year in
advance pays a special tribute to the
interest among our students in this
