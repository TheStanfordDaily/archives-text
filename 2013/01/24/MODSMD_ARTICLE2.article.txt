# Law school debuts religious liberty clinic

### SARAH MOORE 
Only a week after the Stanford
Law School launched the nation's
first Religious Liberty Clinic, stu
dents are already engaged in six
legal battles offering real world
practice on the subject of religious
freedom.

Clinic Director James Sonne said
that Stanford has historically been on
the cutting edge of providing practical
clinical education. The new clinic,
which is housed in the Mills Legal Clin
ic, goes beyond what the Law School

regularly offers.
"We think the religious liberty
aspect gives a very unique and
interesting prism through which to
do clinical training," Sonne said.
Sonne sought to differentiate his
clinic from similar offerings at faith
based schools, which largely take
clients with shared religious affilia
tions. By contrast, the Stanford clin
ic has clients with a wide span of
beliefs, including Muslim, Seventh
Day Adventist, Jewish and Native
American practices.
"There's a wide variety because

part of what we want to show not
only to our students but also to the
wider community is the universal
nature of religious liberty," Sonne
said. "For the most part it doesn't
really matter what the religious
practice is that's involved, but what
matters is the freedom to practice,
not only to believe but [to] manifest
that belief."
Judith Romero, Law School
spokesperson, emphasized the pro
fessional benefits of the clinic's
diverse range of clients.
"The history of religious liberty

in this country offers a rich canvas
upon which our students can learn
how to be first-rate professionals in
service to those in need, particularly
the misrepresented or underrepre
sented," Romero said in a statement
to The Daily.
In addition to a variety of faiths, the
clinic's focus on religious liberty also
focuses the historical significance within
the American legal system of that consti
tutional freedom.
The cases the clinic is currently
working on include a Native Ameri
can prohibited from ceremonial pipe

smoking and a group of Seventh
Day Adventist employees who do
not want to work on then- Sabbath.
The clinic's student involvement
has been relatively small, with four
students admitted winter quarter
and six admitted for spring quarter.
"They had no idea other than
just the name and a two-paragraph
summary about what it was going to
be, so that they signed up a year in
advance pays a special tribute to the
interest among our students in this
type of clinic," Sonne said. "I
think it's fair to say that
they're thrilled with it so far."
The clinic is also unique in
that it is one of the few "full
time" programs in the coun
try meaning enrolled stu
dents take no other classes
during the quarter â€”in an
effort to replicate the profes
sional practice of law.
Michael McConnell, direc
tor of the Stanford Constitu
tional Law Center, said pre
liminary planning for this
new type of clinic had been in
the works for years, as away
to expand the school's clinical
offerings but also to explore
the subject matter more
practically.

"It's an idea that I've
been kicking around with
the former dean and the
head of the clinical program
for several years,"
McConnell said. "This is an
area of academic and schol
arly interest to me, and it
seemed to me to be a great

idea for this to be an area
where students can get some
practical experience."
Like the ten other spe
cialized programs of the
Mills Legal Clinic a Stan
ford Law School in-house
group that operates as a sin
gle law firm the Religious
Liberty Clinic provides law
students the opportunity to
gain firsthand experience in
the field by working along
side faculty on cases, which
Sonne cited as uniquely vaIu

able for students seeking
practical experience.
"[Considering] the mod
ern economy and the modern
market for legal services, it's
all the more important for
our students to have not just
book knowledge but to have
... street knowledge what
it is not just to think like a
lawyer but to be a lawyer,"
Sonne said.

The Stanford Law School's new Religious Liberty Clinic has
already challenged students with contentious legal cases
that explore the legal issues surrounding various religious
practices. The clinic is the first of its kind in the nation.
