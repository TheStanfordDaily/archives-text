## Winter quarter influx pushes housing limits 219 undergrads assigned to Oak Creek, up from 80 in fall quarter

With more students on campus than any
other term, winter quarter poses greater
challenges for students returning from an
autumn quarter abroad, particularly as they
fry to find desirable housing on campus.
"Typically the winter quarter is the quar
ter that has fewer students going abroad,"
said Ramon Saldivar, Burke Family director
of the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP). "Students frankly don't find it as
attractive to be in a place like Paris or Oxford
during the winter as they do during the fall
or spring."
Despite a steady rise in the number of
students going abroad through BOSP pro
grams over the last five years, winter quar
ter has remained the least popular for stu
dents travelling away from Stanford.
"That's an issue that we're very aware of,
and we're thinking hard about what we can
do to help that," Saldivar said. "It'd be ideal
on many levels to have a more even distribu
tion of students abroad over the course of the
year; and in some ways to have even larger
numbers of students in the winter than we
normally do."
Saldivar noted that the difference
between winter and fall or spring enrollment
numbers in BOSP programs varies on a
yearly basis. Often, winter only has about
five to 10 percent fewer students traveling
abroad. This year, however, features a more
pronounced difference in enrollment.
While BOSP is still finalizing its partici
pant numbers, Saldivar projected that 288
students went abroad in the autumn. 185 stu
dents are currently abroad and 303 are plan
ning to leave in the spring.
"Winter quarter each year has the high
est number of students studying at the home
campus, which means that winter quarter
also places the highest demand on housing,"
