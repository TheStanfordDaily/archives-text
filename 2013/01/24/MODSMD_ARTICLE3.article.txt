## Winter quarter influx pushes housing limits 219 undergrads assigned to Oak Creek, up from 80 in fall quarter 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN 
With more students on campus than any
other term, winter quarter poses greater
challenges for students returning from an
autumn quarter abroad, particularly as they
fry to find desirable housing on campus.
"Typically the winter quarter is the quar
ter that has fewer students going abroad,"
said Ramon Saldivar, Burke Family director
of the Bing Overseas Studies Program
(BOSP). "Students frankly don't find it as
attractive to be in a place like Paris or Oxford
during the winter as they do during the fall
or spring."
Despite a steady rise in the number of
students going abroad through BOSP pro
grams over the last five years, winter quar
ter has remained the least popular for stu
dents travelling away from Stanford.
"That's an issue that we're very aware of,
and we're thinking hard about what we can
do to help that," Saldivar said. "It'd be ideal
on many levels to have a more even distribu
tion of students abroad over the course of the
year; and in some ways to have even larger
numbers of students in the winter than we
normally do."
Saldivar noted that the difference
between winter and fall or spring enrollment
numbers in BOSP programs varies on a
yearly basis. Often, winter only has about
five to 10 percent fewer students traveling
abroad. This year, however, features a more
pronounced difference in enrollment.
While BOSP is still finalizing its partici
pant numbers, Saldivar projected that 288
students went abroad in the autumn. 185 stu
dents are currently abroad and 303 are plan
ning to leave in the spring.
"Winter quarter each year has the high
est number of students studying at the home
campus, which means that winter quarter
also places the highest demand on housing,"
wrote Roger Whitney, executive director of
Residential and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) Student Housing, in
an emailed statement.
R&DE refused to release
statistics to The Daily on the
number of students coming
back from abroad who were
assigned to each residence,
including to the Oak Creek
Apartments. An email sent to
Oak Creek residents on Jan. 4
said the complex has 219
undergraduate residents for
winter and spring quarters, up
from 80 undergraduates dur
ing fall quarter.
Konstantine Buhler 'l4
returned from Oxford and was
placed into a double in
Crothers Memorial.
"The whole [housing
process] is really simple," he
said. "I'm really happy with
where I'm living, particularly
with using Tier 3 and coming
back from abroad...l was
placed randomly but I have a
very nice roommate, so I
appreciate that."
Lauren Felice 'l4 was
placed in Adams House in

Freshman-Sophomore College
upon coming back from Stan
ford in Washington.
"My priority was living on
campus, so in that sense I
lucked out," Felice said. "I
think it's kind of about perspec
tive because I have a lot of
Mends who are living in Oak
Creek right now, and who came
back from being abroad and
aren't even on campus."
Oak Creek is often deemed
by students to be one of the
least desirable places to live, in
part because of the complex's
distance from campus. Stan
ford began housing students in
the apartment complex in win
ter quarter 2009.
"This effort was undertak
en in conjunction with our
Housing Master Plan, through
which we strove to ensure the
equity of student spaces on
campus and not to crowd
more students into rooms
than the number for which
they were designed," Whit
ney wrote. 'Also, an advan
tage which we have because we
are providing whole apart
ments in Oak Creek is that we
are able to keep some groups
together, which is an option we
were unable to offer in the

past."
Housing makes no promise
of group retention for students
entering the draw for winter
and spring quarters. Oak
Creek therefore provides a
unique opportunity for stu
dents to try to live together
upon returning to Stanford.
James Honsa 'l4 was lucky
enough to be placed with two
people he knew after returning
from Stanford in Washington.
"We all got assigned Oak
Creek and then we contacted
housing and requested that the
three of us be put together, and
they honored that," Honsa
said. "By and large I know that
most people who made that
request did wind up with peo
ple they requested. But I have
a few friends who didn't and
just wound up with random
people."
Despite Oak Creek's dis
tance from campus, Honsa
generally expressed satisfac
tion with his experience.
"I'm actually overall veiy
happy," he said. "It's definitely
a slower pace of life out here
than on campus."

very nice roommate, so I
appreciate that."
Lauren Felice 'l4 was
placed in Adams House in

Freshman-Sophomore College
upon coming back from Stan
ford in Washington.
"My priority was living on
campus, so in that sense I
lucked out," Felice said. "I
think it's kind of about perspec
tive because I have a lot of
Mends who are living in Oak
Creek right now, and who came
back from being abroad and
aren't even on campus."
Oak Creek is often deemed
by students to be one of the
least desirable places to live, in
part because of the complex's
distance from campus. Stan
ford began housing students in
the apartment complex in win
ter quarter 2009.
"This effort was undertak
en in conjunction with our
Housing Master Plan, through
which we strove to ensure the
equity of student spaces on
campus and not to crowd
more students into rooms
than the number for which
they were designed," Whit
ney wrote. 'Also, an advan
tage which we have because we
are providing whole apart
ments in Oak Creek is that we
are able to keep some groups
together, which is an option we
were unable to offer in the

past."
Housing makes no promise
of group retention for students
entering the draw for winter
and spring quarters. Oak
Creek therefore provides a
unique opportunity for stu
dents to try to live together
upon returning to Stanford.
James Honsa 'l4 was lucky
enough to be placed with two
people he knew after returning
from Stanford in Washington.
"We all got assigned Oak
Creek and then we contacted
housing and requested that the
three of us be put together, and
they honored that," Honsa
said. "By and large I know that
most people who made that
request did wind up with peo
ple they requested. But I have
a few friends who didn't and
just wound up with random
people."
Despite Oak Creek's dis
tance from campus, Honsa
generally expressed satisfac
tion with his experience.
"I'm actually overall veiy
happy," he said. "It's definitely
a slower pace of life out here
than on campus."
