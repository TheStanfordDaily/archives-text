## Wheelz grows, plans national expansion Fueled by investor capital, Stanford startup drives car-sharing trend 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
In September 2011, pairs of outrageously
dressed Stanford students barged into the
freshman dorms of the class of 2015, with one
request. "Download the Wheelz app!" they
urged, offering t-shirts to the first students to
show them the application on their smart
phones.
A little more than a year later, it may as

well be a rite of passage for incoming freshmen
to sign up for Wheelz, a car-sharing service
renting out personal cars to community mem
bers, used for everything from long road trips
to grocery runs.
"Everyone wants the freedom that a car
represents, but having every single person on
the planet own a car is unsustainable," said
Ann Bordetsky MBA 'O9, Wheelz's head of
business development. "Our current model of
car ownership has to change."
Wheelz founder and CEO Jeff Miller MBA
'O7 said that the company started out with the
realization that the world's current utilization

of vehicles is inefficient. Miller had worked at
Better Place, an electric vehicle network
provider, where he focused on building trans
portation solutions. It was there that he came
up with the idea for Wheelz.
"It turns out that most cars are parked 95
percent of the time and we looked at that, and
said, 'ls there away that we can unlock the
potential that currently exists in all of these
cars that are parked?'"

left the company to start
Wheelz with co-founder
Akhtar Jameel and Aaron
Platshon, the company's
marketing and communica
tions head. Jameel had been
the CEO of Mercedes-Benz
Research & Development
North America for eight
years and had the know-how
to build Wheelz's technologi
cal system.
"The more people we
talked to about it, the further
we got on experimenting
with this idea, the more com
pelling it became. [Anybody]
can relate to either owning a
car or not owning a car and
needing one," Miller says.
Initial consumer feedback
inspired the founders to take
the leap as car-sharing serv
ices became more and more
popular. It was then that the
real work began.
"We started building the
technology and launched the
service at Stanford initially,
totally focused on the univer
sity market." Miller said. As
a Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) alumnus, he felt
like he knew both the stu
dent body and Stanford's
geography.
"It was either a student
needed access to a car or a
student had a car and wanted
access to more cash," he said.
David Rust 'll, Wheelz
campus marketing lead, said
Stanford students were real
ly receptive to Wheelz's new
car sharing service when it
first appeared on campus.
"When I first joined
Wheelz, I talked to a lot of
students and they couldn't
stop saying positive things or
telling other students about
it," he said. "You can see how
excited a user gets with your

product and your service,
and that really motivates
you."
Launched in September
2011, Wheelz now operates
at eight college campuses
across California, including
UC-Berkeley, USC and
UCLA. The company has
also moved its head office to
San Francisco and also oper
ates in Downtown Los Ange
les with a team of 30 people.
Wheelz's began as a much
smaller project, with seven
people working out of a
house in Atherton.
"We were only operating
at Stanford with around 20
cars and a couple hundred
customers using the serv
ice," Miller said. "There was
no real investment behind
the company at an early
stage. There was a big idea
but not a lot of traction."
That all changed in Feb
ruary 2012 when Zipcar, an
international car-sharing
service, invested $13.7 mil
lion in the company. Big
names, including a firm
founded by Ford Motors
Chairman William Clay
Ford, Jr., soon followed.
With the additional capi
tal, Wheelz decided to aim
high. They grew their team
and pushed to more cities
a year after the investment,
the company is now looking
national.
"We are eager to bring the
service around the country in
2013 and are well-positioned
to do so," Miller said. Though
he could not go into details
about the exact cities they are
targeting for expansion, he
noted the pace of change at
the company since they've
pivoted nationally.
"We have developed state
of-the-art, cutting-edge tech
nology and though we don't
talk about our metrics, in
terms of cars, we're in the
hundreds," Miller said.
"Everything has changed

from where we stand as a
company."

"When we started think
ing about peer-to-peer car
sharing, the big question was,
'Will people actually share
their cars with the people
around them?'" Rust said.
"We were pleasantly sur
prised [with what we saw]
because no one had done it
before."
Miller attributed their
success to being able to solve
problems quickly.
"One of the bigger chal
lenges is you're faced with a
sea of data and trying to
interpret that data, you still
have imperfect information,"
he said. "You look at what's
happening in the market,
recalibrate your strategy and
adjust to what the market is
saying."
He added that he strives
to create an environment
where people feel like they
can come forward with their
best ideas.
"As a leader, the chal
lenges have been trying to
create an environment by
making good decisions as a
company," he said. "The best
ideas don't usually come from
the top, they come from dif
ferent parts within an organi
zation."
Jason van der Merwe 'l5,
who interned at Wheelz last
summer and now serves as
one of three campus market
ing interns, attested to
Wheelz's "good sense of com
pany culture."
"I had never been around
such smart people, who come
from veiy unique backgrounds
and have so much passion and
excitement around the product
they want to create," he said.
"There's a great, fun vibe to
Wheelz, especially at a college
campus."

the company is now looking
national.
"We are eager to bring the
service around the country in
2013 and are well-positioned
to do so," Miller said. Though
he could not go into details
about the exact cities they are
targeting for expansion, he
noted the pace of change at
the company since they've
pivoted nationally.
"We have developed state
of-the-art, cutting-edge tech
nology and though we don't
talk about our metrics, in
terms of cars, we're in the
hundreds," Miller said.
"Everything has changed

from where we stand as a
company."

"When we started think
ing about peer-to-peer car
sharing, the big question was,
'Will people actually share
their cars with the people
around them?'" Rust said.
"We were pleasantly sur
prised [with what we saw]
because no one had done it
before."
Miller attributed their
success to being able to solve
problems quickly.
"One of the bigger chal
lenges is you're faced with a
sea of data and trying to
interpret that data, you still
have imperfect information,"
he said. "You look at what's
happening in the market,
recalibrate your strategy and
adjust to what the market is
saying."
He added that he strives
to create an environment
where people feel like they
can come forward with their
best ideas.
"As a leader, the chal
lenges have been trying to
create an environment by
making good decisions as a
company," he said. "The best
ideas don't usually come from
the top, they come from dif
ferent parts within an organi
zation."
Jason van der Merwe 'l5,
who interned at Wheelz last
summer and now serves as
one of three campus market
ing interns, attested to
Wheelz's "good sense of com
pany culture."
"I had never been around
such smart people, who come
from veiy unique backgrounds
and have so much passion and
excitement around the product
they want to create," he said.
"There's a great, fun vibe to
Wheelz, especially at a college
campus."

In September 2011, pairs of outrageously
dressed Stanford students barged into the
freshman dorms of the class of 2015, with one
request. "Download the Wheelz app!" they
urged, offering t-shirts to the first students to
show them the application on their smart
phones.
A little more than a year later, it may as

well be a rite of passage for incoming freshmen
to sign up for Wheelz, a car-sharing service
renting out personal cars to community mem
bers, used for everything from long road trips
to grocery runs.
"Everyone wants the freedom that a car
represents, but having every single person on
the planet own a car is unsustainable," said
Ann Bordetsky MBA 'O9, Wheelz's head of
business development. "Our current model of
car ownership has to change."
Wheelz founder and CEO Jeff Miller MBA
'O7 said that the company started out with the
realization that the world's current utilization

of vehicles is inefficient. Miller had worked at
Better Place, an electric vehicle network
provider, where he focused on building trans
portation solutions. It was there that he came
up with the idea for Wheelz.
"It turns out that most cars are parked 95
percent of the time and we looked at that, and
said, 'ls there away that we can unlock the
potential that currently exists in all of these
cars that are parked?'"

left the company to start
Wheelz with co-founder
Akhtar Jameel and Aaron
Platshon, the company's
marketing and communica
tions head. Jameel had been
the CEO of Mercedes-Benz
Research & Development
North America for eight
years and had the know-how
to build Wheelz's technologi
cal system.
"The more people we
talked to about it, the further
we got on experimenting
with this idea, the more com
pelling it became. [Anybody]
can relate to either owning a
car or not owning a car and
needing one," Miller says.
Initial consumer feedback
inspired the founders to take
the leap as car-sharing serv
ices became more and more
popular. It was then that the
real work began.
"We started building the
technology and launched the
service at Stanford initially,
totally focused on the univer
sity market." Miller said. As
a Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) alumnus, he felt
like he knew both the stu
dent body and Stanford's
geography.
"It was either a student
needed access to a car or a
student had a car and wanted
access to more cash," he said.
David Rust 'll, Wheelz
campus marketing lead, said
Stanford students were real
ly receptive to Wheelz's new
car sharing service when it
first appeared on campus.
"When I first joined
Wheelz, I talked to a lot of
students and they couldn't
stop saying positive things or
telling other students about
it," he said. "You can see how
excited a user gets with your

product and your service,
and that really motivates
you."
Launched in September
2011, Wheelz now operates
at eight college campuses
across California, including
UC-Berkeley, USC and
UCLA. The company has
also moved its head office to
San Francisco and also oper
ates in Downtown Los Ange
les with a team of 30 people.
Wheelz's began as a much
smaller project, with seven
people working out of a
house in Atherton.
"We were only operating
at Stanford with around 20
cars and a couple hundred
customers using the serv
ice," Miller said. "There was
no real investment behind
the company at an early
stage. There was a big idea
but not a lot of traction."
That all changed in Feb
ruary 2012 when Zipcar, an
international car-sharing
service, invested $13.7 mil
lion in the company. Big
names, including a firm
founded by Ford Motors
Chairman William Clay
Ford, Jr., soon followed.
With the additional capi
tal, Wheelz decided to aim
high. They grew their team
and pushed to more cities
a year after the investment,
the company is now looking
national.
