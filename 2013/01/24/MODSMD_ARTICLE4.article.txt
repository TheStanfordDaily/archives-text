## Wheelz grows, plans national expansion Fueled by investor capital, Stanford startup drives car-sharing trend 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
In September 2011, pairs of outrageously
dressed Stanford students barged into the
freshman dorms of the class of 2015, with one
request. "Download the Wheelz app!" they
urged, offering t-shirts to the first students to
show them the application on their smart
phones.
A little more than a year later, it may as

well be a rite of passage for incoming freshmen
to sign up for Wheelz, a car-sharing service
renting out personal cars to community mem
bers, used for everything from long road trips
to grocery runs.
"Everyone wants the freedom that a car
represents, but having every single person on
the planet own a car is unsustainable," said
Ann Bordetsky MBA 'O9, Wheelz's head of
business development. "Our current model of
car ownership has to change."
Wheelz founder and CEO Jeff Miller MBA
'O7 said that the company started out with the
realization that the world's current utilization

of vehicles is inefficient. Miller had worked at
Better Place, an electric vehicle network
provider, where he focused on building trans
portation solutions. It was there that he came
up with the idea for Wheelz.
"It turns out that most cars are parked 95
percent of the time and we looked at that, and
said, 'ls there away that we can unlock the
potential that currently exists in all of these
cars that are parked?'"

Founders Jeff Miller MBA '07 and Akhtar Jameel both left jobs in the auto industry to start Wheelz, a popular campus car-sharing
service. Buoyed by success at Stanford and infusions of venture capital, the duo set up shop in San Francisco and is rapidly expanding.
