# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU grant program exceeds initial targets 
### JUSTINE MOORE OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITERS 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate allocated grants to 12 student
groups hosting winter quarter
events this week, disbursing just
under $50,000 as part of the Sen
ate's new initiative to reduce its
buffer fund.
The Senate had originally
planned to allocate a maximum of
$40,000 for winter quarter events,
but increased this amount after
evaluating the 20 applications. The
total amount requested was
$100,349.70.
"We are very happy with the
wide variety of events we are fund
ing with this grant and will continue
working with the recipients when
necessary on their events," said

Appropriations Committee Chair
Nancy Pham 'l4.
The largest grant was awarded
to Lambda Phi Epsilon, an Asian
interest fraternity, which received
separate grants of $11,400 and
$2,482 for two events. The larger of
the two grants will be used for
Identity Xpression, a three-day
workshop and panel event. Pham
said that Lambda Phi Epsilon
needed funding to bring the dance
group Poreotics to the event.
The second largest grant was
given to Chabad at Stanford, a Jew
ish student center, which was
awarded $6,890 to resurrect Purim
Bash, an event that had previously
been cut due to funding shortages.
Sigma Nu applied for $5,700 for
Snowchella, a concert attended by
about 1,000 students every
year. Michael Mezzatesta
'l3, Sigma Nu financial offi
cer, said that he understood
why the Appropriations
Committee granted him
$l,OOO less than requested.
"We were negotiating
with an ice company in the
Bay Area to build us a huge
ice sculpture," Mezzatesta
said. "We thought that
sounded super awesome,
but I understand that the
grant committee was consid
ering lots of other awesome
events and spending $l,OOO
on an ice sculpture probably
didn't fit their criteria for a
grant."
Still, Mezzatesta
expressed optimism that
Sigma Nu will be able to
make several improvements
to Snowchella this year as a
result of the grant.

Financial officers from
other student groups also
said that they would be able
to make noticeable improve
ments to their events with
the money from the grants.

The Stanford Africa
Business Forum received
$6,320 for the Stanford
Africa Forum event, which is

Co-sponsored by the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Financial Officer Mark
Koskei 'l4 said the grant will
allow the group to bring in
more expensive speakers
and reach out to the wider
Stanford community to
attract more undergradu
ates.
"It's a day for Stanford
students to learn more
about Africa that extends
beyond the nonprofit sec
tor," Koskei said. "We are
talking about opportunities
in Africa and we have speak
ers coming in, most of whom
are business leaders and
leaders in their specific
fields."
Though Mezzatesta and
Koskei's groups received
most of the funding they
requested, some other groups
received smaller amounts.
The difference between grant
amounts requested and sums
received varied significantly,
which Pham attributed to
the Senate's evaluation of
each line item requested
individually.
The Senate also assessed
grant requests on the basis
of events' accessibility to the
entire Stanford community
and the groups' usage of
their General Fees discre
tionary budget.
"One main reason for
[the rejection of] groups

that weren't selected was
the availability of general
fees discretionary funds
remaining for their
accounts," Pham said. "We
are still going to work with
those groups to help them
get funding for their event."
The Senate is now evalu
ating applications for the
second round of their grants
program, which will award
grants to groups hosting
spring quarter events. The
Senate received 36 applica
tions for the spring and will
allocate up to $75,000 to
grant recipients.
Though the future of the
grant program beyond
spring quarter is unclear,
student financial officers
hope that the opportunity to
apply for Senate grants and
consequently improve their
events will be available for
years to come.
"I'm not sure if the grant
committee will be comfort
able giving money to the
same event year after year,
but it is an amazing opportu
nity that I think only exists
at schools like Stanford,"
Mezzatesta said. "I don't see
why we wouldn't at least try
to apply."
