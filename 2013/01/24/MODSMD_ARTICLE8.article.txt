## Castro announces candidacy for re-election 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Aaron Sekhri 
Julian Castro '96 announced today that he
would be pursuing re-election as mayor of San
Antonio, via a Youßibe video.
"Over the last three and a half years you've
given me the wonderful opportunity to serve
as mayor of this city that you and I both love,"
he said in his video announcement.
Castro used the video to announce that he
would be officially declaring his bid for reelection
as mayor of San Antonio on Feb. 2. The city's may
oral election will take place on May 11.
Castro, who gained national attention this
summer with his keynote speech at the Demo
cratic National Convention, is the mayor of
America's seventh largest city and a rising
star within the Democratic Party, in part
because of his Latino heritage. His announce
ment dispelled rumors that he planned to run
for governor.
"I've said all along that if the voters will
have me, I will be mayor of San Antonio until
2017," Castro said to Fox News Latino in a
statement. "I'm announcing my re-election as
mayor on Feb. 2."
Mayoral elections are held every two years
in San Antonio and the longest period of time
one candidate can hold office for is eight years.
Castro was elected in 2009 with 56 percent of
the vote, and cruised into re-election in 2011
with a margin of 82 percent.
Castro made news on Sunday when in
an appearance on "Face the Nation" alongside
his brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro '96, and Pro
fessor Condoleezza Rice —he claimed that
Texas, a reliably "red" state, could soon
become a battleground state due to demo
graphic factors and the increasing extremism
of the state's Republican Party.
"In a couple of presidential cycles, on elec
tion night, you'll be announcing we're calling
the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Demo
cratic nominee for president," Castro said.
"It's changing."
"It's going to become a purple state and
then a blue state, because of the demograph
ics, because of the population growth of folks
from outside of Texas and because, unfortu
nately, the Republican Party has gone so far to
the right that they're losing the business com
munity," he said.
In that same discussion, Castro identified
economic stability, education, immigration and
gun control as his most critical priorities for
San Antonio.
