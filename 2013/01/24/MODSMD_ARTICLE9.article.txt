# Laptop theft compromises hospital information
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Aaron Sekhri 
The Lucile Packard Children's Hospital
(LPCH) announced Monday the theft of a lap
top containing patient medical information, an
incident that has potentially affected up to
57,000 patients. The hospital has since notified
affected individuals.
The laptop was stolen from a physician's
car at an off-campus location on the night of
Jan. 9. While a police investigation was
opened the following day, the laptop has yet
to be recovered.
According to a press release from the
LPCH, the laptop's data was "predominant
ly from 2009 and related to past care and
research." The laptop contained basic patient
details and medical descriptors but no finan
cial information, Social Security numbers or
any "marketable information."
The laptop was also password-protected,
and the LPCH has "no indication that any of
the patient information has been accessed or
compromised," according to Robert Dicks,
LPCH spokesman.
"Immediately following discovery of the
theft, Packard Children's Hospital and the
School of Medicine notified law enforcement
and internal security and launched an
aggressive investigation, which is still under
way," the LPCH press release said.
Dicks framed the theft as a prompt to fur
ther increase safeguards on patient data
through methods like improved data encryp
tion in order to prevent similar incidents
in the future.
"We really strive to be industry leaders in
information security and we're using the
theft to further strengthen policies and con
trols surrounding the protection of patient
data," Dicks said.
According to Dicks, the last time a simi
lar occurrence transpired was in January
2010, when a password-protected desktop
computer containing patient scheduling
information was stolen. That incident, which
affected 532 patients, prompted a $250,000
fine due to the delay of the hospital's
response. Following an appeal, it was
reduced to $l,lOO, according to Dicks.
The hospital has offered potentially
affected patients the option of receiving free
identity protection services, and has estab
lished a toll-free line for patients to inquire
about the status of their personal informa
tion.
