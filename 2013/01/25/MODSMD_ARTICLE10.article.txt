# SELF-DESIGNED MAJORS
## PETITION 
### 
David Ngo 'l3 began circulating a petition on Jan. 13
in hopes of convincing the Stanford School of Humani
ties and Sciences to revive its Individually Designed
Major (IDM) program. Starting next year, the school will
no longer allow students to create and pursue their own
curriculum outside of existing departments. The School
of Engineering will continue to offer an IDM option
known as IDMEN.
Ngo asked signees of the petition to leave their rea
son why Stanford should continue its IDM program. The
Daily has reprinted some of the responses below.

"One of the reasons I was attracted to Stanford was the aca
demic freedom. While I have found a major and concentra
tion that fits me well, I often debated designing my own.
Luckily, I found a spot perfect for me, but not all students have
that same experience. IDMs are a great way to encourage
students to pursue their academic and intellectual interests,
whatever they may be. IDMs say that Stanford doesn't care
about the system, but about helping students achieve their
dreams and goals."
Jason van der Merwe 'l5, computer science major

"The IDMEN program allows self-driven students the abili
ty to create their own interdisciplinary majors combining
their various interests. Through the Department of Engi
neering [sic], I was able to create a major combining my
interests in product design, computer science and psychol
ogy. The IDM program should stick around just like the
IDMEN program!"

Andrew Martin 'l3, IDMEN "Interaction Design Engineering" major

"IDM is the reason I choose this school."

Anjan Katta 'l6, undeclared

"One of Stanford's greatest assets is its focus on innovation.
When students are deprived of the ability to shape their
future by designing their own major, students lose out and so
does the university's culture of innovation."
Nathan Baker 'l3, international relations major and Chinese minor
"Any student who takes the initiative to design a major and
then get it approved probably exhibits the kind of drive Stan
ford hopes its student base showed more of. It'd be a poorly
thought out move to eliminate this outlet to identify such stu
dents and enable them to truly pursue their passions."
Andrew Dao 'lO, management science and engineering major
"I admit that it maybe burdensome for the school to support
such options, but I also question where this institution would
be were it not for its pioneering and burden-taking spirit. The
IDM program exemplifies so much of what Stanford means to
me and to others, and it would be a sad day if the program
were ever discontinued."
David Herman 'l6, undeclared
"Stanford thrives on creativity and innovation: 'Let the wind of
freedom blow.' IDM allows students to think and act outside
the box, disregarding the common notions of pre-deter
mined academic majors. What are now common and popu
lar majors (product design; science, technology and society;
human biology) were once unorthodox and unheard of and
have now solidified their place in our curriculum. Discontinu
ing IDM prevents future students from the opportunity to
grow and mature into their interests."
