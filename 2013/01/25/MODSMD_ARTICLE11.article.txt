## Getting over the football withdrawal 
### Sam Fisher 
I have a confession to make. I'm
not ready to accept that Stan
ford's football season is over. I
didn't realize I had a problem
until I sat down to write this col
umn. Eveiy idea that popped into my
head was about football.
Two weeks ago I wrote about the
2013 schedule. Last week I wrote
about Manti Tb'o. This week I hit a
dead end.
The unfortunate reality that I face
is that the season is over. It's done. In a
season of the highest of highs—beat
ing Oregon at Autzen and winning the
Rose Bowl —the lowest of the lows
might be the fact that it has to end.
But why is this year so much hairi
er than ever to move on from? It's final
ly the combination of a good ending, a
promising future and high expecta
tions.
In 2010, it was all new—l was
gleeMy ignorant of the success to
come. In 2011, the painfirl Fiesta Bowl
ending, and the NFL departures
immediately Mowing, made it easy to
move on.
Now, there's only one thing to help
me move on, and thankfully, it's finally
here. That's right, at 2 p.m. today Stan
ford baseball finally "begins" with
intrasquad scrimmage at Sunken Dia
mond.
There's nothing quite like an after
noon at Sunken Diamond. Stanford is
known for having one of the most beau
tiful campuses in the world, but no
place on campus comes close to
Sunken Diamond.
The feeling of watching a baseball
game there is almost therapeutic.
From the end of January until Memo
rial Day—except for the rare week
end when the team travels and I'm
stuck at home I settle into the most
comforting of routines. FVom Friday
after lunch to Sunday evening, it's all
about Stanford baseball, and I would
n't want to have it any other way.
I'm not here to tell you that every
Stanford student has to go to baseball
games. What I am here to say is, if you
are a baseball fan, you have to check
out Sunken Diamond. Assuming it is
not raining as you read this, start this
weekend with the intrasquads.
For those of you who are interested
in making it out this weekend, or any
time early in the season, there are a
few things you should look out for.
Today, and eveiy other Friday this
year, you only need one reason to head
to the ballpark—a chance to watch
senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel
dominate. Appel was a top-10 draft
choice of the Pittsburgh Ifirates last
June, but passed up millions to come
back to the Farm for one more year.
Appel's fastball comes close to 100 mph
at its fastest, so make sure you don't
blink.
If you like drama and competition,
then definitely pay attention to how
some of the intense positional battles
play out over the next few weeks. It's
rare to see a team ranked fourth in the
nation in preseason with so many slots
to fill Saturday and Sunday starting
pitchers, catcher, third base and left
field, to name a few —which says a lot
about how much talent the Cardinal
squad has. Still, no matter how much
talent you have, it has to be a bit scary
to head into February with so many
questions.
This weekend could shine a lot of
light on the competition, especially for
the weekend pitching starters. Seniors
Garrett Hughes and Dean McArdle,
along with sophomore John Hochstat
ter, all started at times last season.
Hochstatter is an interesting option, as
he started last season with nine no-hit
innings over two appearances but fin
ished with a 4.53 ERA
But the big shakeup in this battle
could come from some freshman, who
will have three weeks to prove to head
coach Mark Marquess and pitching
coach Rusty Filter that they are
ready for the weekend spotlight.
Freddy Avis's name has been thrown
in the ring by many, but the Menlo
School star has yet to pitch this year
due to arm issues in the fall. Daniel
Starwalt, Marcus Brakeman and
Andrew McCormack round out the
contingent of freshmen looking for a
starting spot.
There's more to look out for than
just pitching and positional battles. If
you, like chicks, dig the long ball, then
you have to show up just to have the
opportunity to see Austin Wilson swing
the bat. Wilson, who could be one of the
first five players drafted this June, has
absurd power. Last year I saw scouts
laughing after he flied out to the warn
ing track when he just flailed his hands
at a breaking ball in the dirt —his
misses are more impressive than most
people's perfect swings.
But the most exciting part about
the weekend is just the opportunity to
sit in any seat at Sunken Diamond and
just watch everything unfold.
Don't make me sit alone.

Sam Fisher is slowly over
coming his football with
drawal by watching a replay
of the Rose Bowl every night
before he goes to sleep.
Explain to him why that's
not okay at safisher@ Stan

The unfortunate reality that I face
is that the season is over. It's done. In a
season of the highest of highs—beat
ing Oregon at Autzen and winning the
Rose Bowl —the lowest of the lows
might be the fact that it has to end.
But why is this year so much hairi
er than ever to move on from? It's final
ly the combination of a good ending, a
promising future and high expecta
tions.
In 2010, it was all new—l was
gleeMy ignorant of the success to
come. In 2011, the painfirl Fiesta Bowl
ending, and the NFL departures
immediately Mowing, made it easy to
move on.
Now, there's only one thing to help
me move on, and thankfully, it's finally
here. That's right, at 2 p.m. today Stan
ford baseball finally "begins" with
intrasquad scrimmage at Sunken Dia
mond.
There's nothing quite like an after
noon at Sunken Diamond. Stanford is
known for having one of the most beau
tiful campuses in the world, but no
place on campus comes close to
Sunken Diamond.
The feeling of watching a baseball
game there is almost therapeutic.
From the end of January until Memo
rial Day—except for the rare week
end when the team travels and I'm
stuck at home I settle into the most
comforting of routines. FVom Friday
after lunch to Sunday evening, it's all
about Stanford baseball, and I would
n't want to have it any other way.
I'm not here to tell you that every
Stanford student has to go to baseball
games. What I am here to say is, if you
are a baseball fan, you have to check
out Sunken Diamond. Assuming it is
not raining as you read this, start this
weekend with the intrasquads.
For those of you who are interested
in making it out this weekend, or any
time early in the season, there are a
few things you should look out for.
Today, and eveiy other Friday this
year, you only need one reason to head
to the ballpark—a chance to watch
senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel
dominate. Appel was a top-10 draft
choice of the Pittsburgh Ifirates last
June, but passed up millions to come
back to the Farm for one more year.
Appel's fastball comes close to 100 mph
at its fastest, so make sure you don't
blink.
If you like drama and competition,
then definitely pay attention to how
some of the intense positional battles
play out over the next few weeks. It's
rare to see a team ranked fourth in the
nation in preseason with so many slots
to fill Saturday and Sunday starting
pitchers, catcher, third base and left
field, to name a few —which says a lot
about how much talent the Cardinal
squad has. Still, no matter how much
talent you have, it has to be a bit scary
to head into February with so many
questions.
This weekend could shine a lot of
light on the competition, especially for
the weekend pitching starters. Seniors
Garrett Hughes and Dean McArdle,
along with sophomore John Hochstat
ter, all started at times last season.
Hochstatter is an interesting option, as
he started last season with nine no-hit
innings over two appearances but fin
ished with a 4.53 ERA
But the big shakeup in this battle
could come from some freshman, who
will have three weeks to prove to head
coach Mark Marquess and pitching
coach Rusty Filter that they are
ready for the weekend spotlight.
Freddy Avis's name has been thrown
in the ring by many, but the Menlo
School star has yet to pitch this year
due to arm issues in the fall. Daniel
Starwalt, Marcus Brakeman and
Andrew McCormack round out the
contingent of freshmen looking for a
starting spot.
There's more to look out for than
just pitching and positional battles. If
you, like chicks, dig the long ball, then
you have to show up just to have the
opportunity to see Austin Wilson swing
the bat. Wilson, who could be one of the
first five players drafted this June, has
absurd power. Last year I saw scouts
laughing after he flied out to the warn
ing track when he just flailed his hands
at a breaking ball in the dirt —his
misses are more impressive than most
people's perfect swings.
But the most exciting part about
the weekend is just the opportunity to
sit in any seat at Sunken Diamond and
just watch everything unfold.
Don't make me sit alone.

Sam Fisher is slowly over
coming his football with
drawal by watching a replay
of the Rose Bowl every night
before he goes to sleep.

not okay at safisher@ Stan
