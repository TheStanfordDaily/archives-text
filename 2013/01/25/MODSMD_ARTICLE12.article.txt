# BUFFALO STAMPEDE
## FIRST CARD LOSS TO COLORADO IN 22 YEARS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a big win over conference rival
California, the Stanford men's basketball team
(11-8, 2-4 Pac-12) wanted to prove to the entire
Pac-12 that they are a force to be reckoned with.

A win against Colorado (13-6, 3-4 Pac-12),
which came within a controversial buzzer-beat
ing three-pointer of upsetting No. 6 Arizona,
would have done just that. Shooting 31 percent

from the floor, being outrebounded 48-30 and
losing 75-54 was certainly not the way to get it
done.

The first half was a period of runs, as both
the Buffaloes and the Cardinal were able to put
together solid stretches of play. The Buffs
struck first, opening the game on a quick 9-0
run. Sophomore guard Askia Booker led the
way, knocking down an open jumper and then
driving to the hoop for a layup. A three-pointer
for Stanford by junior guard Aaron Bright
helped the Cardinal cut into the lead, but the
Buffaloes continued to push the ball up the
court, jumping out to a 16-5 lead just under five
minutes into the game.

The Cardinal then stormed back, going on a
balanced 10-2 run. Senior forward Andy Brown
and senior guard Gabriel Harris knocked down
back-to-back shots, pulling the Card to within
seven. Forward Dwight Powell then drew a foul
and converted on the free throw to complete
the three-point play. With 13:14 remaining in

the half, sophomore guard Chasson Randle
knocked down his first three-pointer of the
game, cutting Colorado's advantage to 18-15.
However, Colorado would have the last
laugh, closing out the half with a bang. The
Buffs outplayed Stanford for the remainder of
the first period, dominating both in the paint
and on the offensive glass.

After freshman Rosco Allen converted a
layup off a nice pass from Bright, Colorado for
ward Xavier Johnson finished the half with an
exclamation point. After a jumper from Josh
Scott with just three seconds left rattled off the
rim, Johnson skied to grab the offensive
rebound and then threw down a monstrous
dunk just as time expired. This play perfectly
exemplified a first half in which Stanford was
dominated around the basket.

The second half looked to be a similar story
early on, as the Cardinal could not find an

Coming off a statement win against California last Saturday, sophomore guard Chasson Randle (5) had 15 points against Andre Roberson
