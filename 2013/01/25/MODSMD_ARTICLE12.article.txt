# BUFFALO STAMPEDE
## FIRST CARD LOSS TO COLORADO IN 22 YEARS 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a big win over conference rival
California, the Stanford men's basketball team
(11-8, 2-4 Pac-12) wanted to prove to the entire
Pac-12 that they are a force to be reckoned with.

A win against Colorado (13-6, 3-4 Pac-12),
which came within a controversial buzzer-beat
ing three-pointer of upsetting No. 6 Arizona,
would have done just that. Shooting 31 percent

from the floor, being outrebounded 48-30 and
losing 75-54 was certainly not the way to get it
done.

The first half was a period of runs, as both
the Buffaloes and the Cardinal were able to put
together solid stretches of play. The Buffs
struck first, opening the game on a quick 9-0
run. Sophomore guard Askia Booker led the
way, knocking down an open jumper and then
driving to the hoop for a layup. A three-pointer
for Stanford by junior guard Aaron Bright
helped the Cardinal cut into the lead, but the
Buffaloes continued to push the ball up the
court, jumping out to a 16-5 lead just under five
minutes into the game.

The Cardinal then stormed back, going on a
balanced 10-2 run. Senior forward Andy Brown
and senior guard Gabriel Harris knocked down
back-to-back shots, pulling the Card to within
seven. Forward Dwight Powell then drew a foul
and converted on the free throw to complete
the three-point play. With 13:14 remaining in

the half, sophomore guard Chasson Randle
knocked down his first three-pointer of the
game, cutting Colorado's advantage to 18-15.
However, Colorado would have the last
laugh, closing out the half with a bang. The
Buffs outplayed Stanford for the remainder of
the first period, dominating both in the paint
and on the offensive glass.

After freshman Rosco Allen converted a
layup off a nice pass from Bright, Colorado for
ward Xavier Johnson finished the half with an
exclamation point. After a jumper from Josh
Scott with just three seconds left rattled off the
rim, Johnson skied to grab the offensive
rebound and then threw down a monstrous
dunk just as time expired. This play perfectly
exemplified a first half in which Stanford was
dominated around the basket.

The second half looked to be a similar story
early on, as the Cardinal could not find an

LEIGH KINNEY/The Stanford Daily
Coming off a statement win against California last Saturday, sophomore guard Chasson Randle (5) had 15 points against Andre Roberson
and the Colorado Buffaloes, but it was not enough for the Cardinal in a 75-54 loss. It was the team's fourth conference loss of the season.
answer for the Buffaloes'
offensive attack. With 14
minutes remaining, Col
orado junior forward Andre
Roberson found teammate
Johnson under the hoop,
where Johnson finished with
a dunk. This put Colorado up
54-26, forcing Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins to
call a timeout.
A new team came out
after the break. The Card
demonstrated a defensive
prowess and offensive fluidi
ty that would have had Dick
Vitale jumping out of his
seat. Stanford went on a 10-0
run, beginning with a Powell
layup and jumper. Allen then
converted on a three-point
play, followed shortly after
by a three-pointer from Ran
dle. Suddenly up by only
eight, Colorado head coach
Tad Boyle called a timeout.
Boyle certainly lit a fire
under his squad, as the Buffs

came out with a vengeance.
Behind an outstanding per
formance from Roberson,
they blew the Cardinal out of
the water for the rest of the
second half. Colorado domi
nated Stanford on both ends
of the floor, attacking the
hoop and dominating in the
paint en route to a 75-54 vic
tory. They overwhelmed the
Card with their aggressive
play down low as well as
their stout defensive effort.
"We kept emphasizing
how bad they beat us last
year," Booker said. "Defi
nitely, (revenge) was on our
mind."
Stanford had no answer
for Roberson, the man who
shocked many by turning
down a trip to the NBA draft
to return to Colorado for his
junior season. The forward
terrorized the Cardinal
under the basket.

"We had a lot to prove,"
Roberson said. "Last year
they gave us the business.
This year we put it to them."
Despite scoring only 12
points, Roberson made his
mark on the game in a vari

ety of other ways. He tied a
career-high by grabbing 20
rebounds, as the Stanford
forwards could not get posi
tion on him under the bas
ket. He added a game-high 3
blocks, a mark which, by
itself, surpassed Stanford's
total (1). He also led all play
ers with 3 steals, and even
managed to dish out a couple
of assists.
"Twenty rebounds by
Andre that's ridiculous,"
Booker said.
Still, the Card showed
glimpses of a team that could
certainly contend in the Pac
-12 and possibly even earn a
trip to the NCAA Tourna
ment in March. They will
need to demonstrate more
consistency and play with a
higher level of intensity to do
so.
Stanford will resume its
quest for a tournament
berth this weekend, as the
Card travels to Salt Lake
City to take on the Utah
Utes on Sunday.
