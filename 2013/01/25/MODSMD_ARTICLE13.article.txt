### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
On Saturday night, Stanford (5-2, 2-2
MPSF) will take on conference rival No. 10
UC-Santa Barbara (3-3, 1-2) at Maples
Pavilion.

Stanford is looking to capitalize off its
recent success against No. 4 UCLA on
Tuesday night, helping to push its rocky
road trip last weekend against Pepperdine
and USC into the past.
The Cardinal hopes to maintain its
momentum after its four-set victory over
fellow No. 4 UCLA as well as its undefeated
record at home. While Stanford is coming
off an impressive win, UCSB is reeling from
two-straight losses.
After two consecutive losses on the road
last weekend, Steven Irvin stepped up with
his season-best performance against
UCLA, providing the young Cardinal team

with the confidence needed going into its
match against UCSB.
James Shaw, freshman setter from
Woodside, Calif., has also been performing
impressively and seems to be improving
with each passing game. If Shaw can contin
ue or even improve on his 36 assists and five
kills game against UCLA, then UCSB will
have a tough time hanging with Stanford.
One of Stanford's biggest faults in its
two losses to Southern California schools
was the high number of errors, specifically
service errors, that the team committed.
Stanford needs to capitalize off UCSB's
errors (seven against UCLA) while mini
mizing its own. The Gaucho will play on Fri
day against No. 15 Pacific, while Stanford
will come off a much-needed three-day rest.

Stanford must also continue the convinc
ing defensive performance it showed

against UCLA; the Bruins
were held to a .228 hitting
average and their top four
hitters were held below
their season average. Stan
ford's strong blocking per
formance has been led by
junior Eric Mochalski, who
leads the Cardinal with 1.5
blocks per set. Leading hit
ter Brian Cook (averaging
4.21 kills per set) hopes to
pave the way by taking
advantage of UCSB's recent
struggles with passing.

While both teams will be
coming in with much to
prove, Stanford perhaps has
more to lose with a loss than

UCSB. The young Cardinal
team is still finding its
rhythm, and a loss could dis
rupt its recent confidence
building wins. Stanford
could possibly lose its top
five ranking, tarnish its
undefeated home record and
leave Maples with a losing
record within the very
inconsistent MPSF confer
ence.

But Stanford should feel
confident going into Satur
day night. The Cardinal is
building off strong individ
ual performances, a great
team dynamic and a show of
resilience. The Cardinal will
be tested once again, but this
time in the comfort of
Maples and with a team that
is very much improving.
Stanford and UCSB
square off at Maples Pavilion

on Saturday, with the match
slated to begin at 7 p.m.
