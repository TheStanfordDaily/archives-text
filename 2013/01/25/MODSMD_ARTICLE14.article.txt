## Card ready to end five-game homestand 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
Despite big wins over USC and then-N0.14
UCLA, the Stanford women's basketball team was
still unable to break back into the top-five rankings
this week, remaining at No. 6 in the nation for a sec
ond week.
The Cardinal (16-2, 5-1 Pac-12) has another
chance this weekend to prove their dominance
against Utah (10-7,1-5) and No. 20 Colorado (15-2,4-
2).
Although the team did not receive a nod from the
NCAA, junior forward Chiney Ogwumike, Stanford's
standout star, was named to the John R. Wooden
Award's Midseason Top 20. Also a consensus nation
al player of the year, Ogwumike is the only player in
the country to rank in the nation's top 10 in scoring
(22 ppg), rebounding (11.9 rpg) and field goal per
centage (.583). Due to her stellar performances
against top-25 teams, the Cardinal has managed to go
6-2 against ranked opponents this season.
This weekend the Card meets up with Colorado
another top-25 team. The Buffs are led by senior
guard Chucky Jeffery (13.5 ppg, 8.4 rpg) and redshirt
freshman forward Arielle Roberson (13.6 ppg, 5.8
rpg). Jeffery made the All-Pac 12 team at the end of
last season, and Roberson begins her collegiate
career this year after sitting out the 2011-12 season
due to injury.
"[Chucky Jeffery] is really good," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "[Colorado] is extremely aggres
sive. They are a very quick, very athletic team. They
have an excellent freshman with [Arielle] Roberson.
She's a really outstanding freshman. Both teams are
both really good. Obviously they've played each oth
er, and Colorado beat Utah twice. They're different in
that Colorado is maybe more athletic, quicker, where
as Utah is bigger. Both teams are very physical."
Stanford has yet to drop a game to Utah, leading
the series history 15-0. The Utes are led by Canadian
standouts Michelle Plouffe (16.1 ppg, 7.3 rpg) and
Taryn Wicijowski (15.6p pg, 7.2 rpg). Plouffe, a junior
forward, is a member of the Canadian Olympic team
and made All Pac-12 honorable mention last season,
while redshirt junior forward Wicijowski received
first team All Pac-12 honors. Both players offer
decent size and consistent shooting for the Utes.
"They're a lot better than their Pac-12 record indi
cates," said VanDerveer. "They're very physical; they
have big Canadian kids, [Michelle] Plouffe and
[Taryn] Wicijowski; they have an excellent point
guard with [lwalani] Rodrigues. They played us and
Cal first; they played Colorado, some of the top teams
first... and kind of got down."
For Stanford to have the
same success this weekend as
it did the last time out, it will
have to see contributions
from the bench. All 75 of the
Card's points against USC
were scored by starters.
Although Stanford has expe
rienced some positive stats as
well dominating the offen
sive and defensive glass
recently and leading the Pac
-12 in scoring margin (+16.7)
and field goal percentage
(47.6) â€”VanDerveer is not
satisfied with the spread of
offensive output.
"We're working on pace,
our offensive pace, and trying
to get people to set better
screens," VanDerveer said.
"We're working on getting
on the o-boards better. I
showed our team the Pac-12
statistics where we're work
ing being more aggressive.
We're 12th in the Pac-12 in
steals, we're 11th I think in
offensive boards. We're living
a lot on what Chiney does,
and we need some people to
carry more of a load. I really
think the blueprint of our
team is Sara James, how well
she's done and how well she's
contributing. So for other
people, it's if she can do it,
you can do it that's been
our message. We're just hop

ing to get more contributions
from more people. We think
we have capable players that
are spectating. We have to
make more happen."
With junior James play
ing so consistently since the
start of Pac-12 play, it
appears the Card may have
finally found a coherent start
ing five. James has averaged

seven points in her first three
career Pac-12 starts to
become the Cardinal's fourth
leading scorer in Pac-12 play,
behind starters Ogwumike,
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle,
sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange and junior
guard Toni Kokenis. With red
shirt junior and all-around con
tributor Mikaela Ruef coming

off the bench as the sixth
man, the Card should start to
see greater offensive output
from multiple players.
The Card finishes out its
five game homestand 7 p.m.
tonight against Utah and 4
p.m. Simday against Colorado.
