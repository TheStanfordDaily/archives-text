## SEEING GREEN The 						Melting Pot Below 
### Holly Moeller 
I discovered a new species this
week.
At least, I think I did. It's
always a little hard to tell when
working with ectomycorrhizal fun
gi sampled from holes in the
ground. Although many of these
fungi will produce mushrooms at
some point in their lives, I rarely
get to see those reproductive struc
tures. Instead, I use DNA
sequences taken from the interface
of the fungus and its host: tree
roots. This DNA sequence, unique
to each species, serves as a barcode
for microscopic bits of fungus that
are otherwise unremarkable.
Ectomycorrhizal fungi are a
special breed. They're what ecolo
gists term "mutualists," organisms
that work closely with another
species (in this case, a variety of
plants) to the benefit of each part
ner. For the ectos I study, this
means helping trees gather water
and nutrients from the soil in
exchange for sugars, which the tree
provides by conducting photosyn
thesis. The more efficient a tree's
compliment of invisible nutrient
acquirers below, the more success
ful the host tree, and the happier
the fungi it supports. It's a win-win.
Well, most of the time.
Just like you'd expect in any
group of humans, fungal society
has its benefactors and its cheaters,
its winners and its losers. And as far
as we can tell, the host tree, which
may be interacting with dozens of
different fungal species at a time, is
an imperfect referee. Over evolu
tionary time, it must be making gen
erally the right calls with sanctions
and rewards, or the mutualistic rela
tionship would be overrun by sugar
thieves. But in the moment, it must
be hard to tell which fungus on what
root tip is a freeloader and which
one is just having a bad day.
Go work on an invasive tree
species in New Zealand, and the
story gets a whole lot more compli
cated. The island nation, about two
thirds the size of California, has a
spectacularly rich suite of native
fungi, including dozens of ectomyc
orrhizae, some of which are yet to
be identified (like those mystery
DNA sequences showing up in my
dataset this week). It's also got
hundreds of transfer species from
all over the world, brought in acci
dentally in bits of soil (that's why I
can count on Kiwi border security
for a free boot cleaning every time
I fly in) or deliberately to aid the
growth of foreign trees (that's why
I work on Douglas fir, a North
American species planted for tim
ber and known to be, well, a little
promiscuous in its fungal associa
tions). In my relatively limited sam
pling, I've come across fungi from
nearby Tasmania, rather more dis
tant China and Argentina and the
far northern reaches of the Arctic.
Although we know relatively lit
tle about the mechanisms by which
trees and fungi identify and
exchange materials with their part
ners, we know that they must oper
ate with some specificity to put the
brakes on cheating. Which means
that when you have fungal and tree
species separated by millions of
years of evolution that have just
been suddenly thrown back into the
mix, it's hard to guess who will
come out on top.
Will a flexible host like Douglas
fir thrive in this Southern Hemi
sphere melting pot? Will the intro-

duced fungal species stage hostile
takeovers of defenseless native root
systems? Will the remarkably bio
diverse Kiwi fungi hold their
ground with some as-yet-unrecog
nized special adaptations?
We know the answers in a few
cases. There are some remarkably
clean examples of "co-invasion," in
which foreign pine trees need to form
associations with ectos from their
native range to grow wild. And, at
least in the early stages of fungal
introduction, it seems that the for
eigners are coexisting with the
natives, though we don't yet know
the terms of those peace treaties.
Of course, the future of New
Zealand's fungi is just one chapter
in a global book about biodiversity
post-human globalization. We've
spent centuries mixing up the geo
graphic distributions of life on
Earth. Sometimes, our relocations
have been deliberate attempts to
make a foreign land more familiar;
in other cases they've been regret
table accidents. Today, though we
give more lip service (and more
security time) to invasive species
risks, we also ship more people,
goods and propagules around the
world than ever before.
Regardless of our original
intent, we now live in an epoch
some biologists are calling "The
Homogocene" while they wait to
see whether we've turned an evolu
tionary mosaic into a melting pot
and, if so, which scrappy species
will emerge victorious.
