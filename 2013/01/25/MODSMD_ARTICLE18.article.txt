## The 						pressure to be happy and the crisis of the humanities, part II 
### Alex Bayer 
This column is the second in a two
part series examining the connec
tions between happiness, pressure
and the study of the humanities at
Stanford.

Last year, I found myself debat
ing three of my friends, all
some variation of techie-ness.
"Humanities feed your soul," I
offered desperately. I criticized
excessive time and money spent on
research, since much of it is simply
funneled into the vortex of academia,
never to be seen again. My friend
pointed out that research could cure
cancer. I felt tempted to fire back
that cancers are often traced to man
made chemicals, more often that not
produced in these very laboratories,
and then launched into a tirade about
the ghastly ways in which technology
has compromised meaningful human
connection. This did not get me very
far. "Well," I offered, stomaching my
lack of conviction, "In grief, what do
you turn to? Science may explain
death, but it does not heal grief. A

poem can make you feel better." This
was met with blank stares, so I quick
ly amended it: "A song can make you
feel better."
I left the room, disappointed that
I had only managed to half-heartedly
convince them (and even that wasn't
such a sure point, for maybe they had
just taken pity on the dying pit bull).
If anything, I had become less con
vinced myself. I hadn't been able to
prove the worth of the humanities; I
hadn't even addressed what makes
writing a novel as equally important
to civilization as designing a wind
turbine. A song can make you
feel better. Was this paltry line my
best argument?
In Seneca's "On the Shortness of
Life," he advises his friend Paulinus,
"It is not that we have a short time to
live, but that we waste a lot of it." To
imbue our lives with wisdom and
clarity, look no further "high priests
of liberal studies," the philosophers
who have taken to task hard ques
tions like, "What is the meaning of
life?" Seneca writes: "By the toil of

others we are let into the presence of
things which have been brought from
darkness into light... None of these
will be too busy to see you, none of
these will not send his visitor away
happier and more devoted to himself,
none of these will allow anyone to
depart empty-handed. They are at
home to all mortals by night and by
day." For now, I like to think, a good
book will suffice.
I do need to make one important
clarification: lest this argument be
mistaken for a critique of the sci
ences and a manifesto declaring that
all students should be classics and
English majors, I should say the
problem here is not biology or com
puter science or mechanical engi
neering. There are plenty of devout
ly passionate students who study the
sciences (and can understand them,
God bless you), who want to push the
fold of human knowledge further,
who dream of changing the world for
the better. This is as noble a cause as
any.
No, the problem is the never-end
ing career fairs, the looming recruit
ment rounds, the pressure felt by so
many here to not just secure a job,
but a damn good one, one with the
kind of clout and money-earning
potential to make the university
proud. I wonder: how many gradu
ates become elementary school
teachers who arguably have an
impact unparalleled by other profes
sions? What is that number com
pared to the number of students who
enter consulting or marketing, nei
ther of which they likely knew about
in high school and, I suspect, aren't
terribly passionate about even as
they go down that route? The curios
ity students have nourished since
childhood is squandered in profes
sions whose focus is, in the ultimate
end, to make money Choos
ing this path is not unreasonable. Job
security is frightful right now, and
many take these positions knowing
it'll help them land better ones they
actually like doing.
But I fear too many students are
getting sucked, irreversibly into a
vacuum wherein profit is an impostor
for purpose and competition a means
of lifestyle. The worst part is that the
university, with its eagerness to
bring recruiters and its more-than
friendly, deeply biased relationship
with Silicon Valley, promotes these
kinds of jobs. I went to a job fair at
White Plaza once. I passed booths
touting careers I had never heard of,

firms with sterile names. It was all
very intimidating, so I beelined for
the Walt Disney booth, hoping to find
their information about being a sto
ry-boarder or an artist. Standing
behind a girl dressed in business
slacks, I scanned the poster. Disney
was here to recruit future marketers,
legal team members, potential execu
tives. My grin faded.
Stanford's approach to career
building is very one-sided. Where
was the creative contingent among
all these employers? Where were the
architects, where was National Geo
graphic, The New York Times? Per
haps companies like these don't
pluck smart college students like
consulting firms do, but with Stan
ford's resources, is it out of their
power to bring them to campus for at
least an information session? Why
are the heroes, touted by Stanford's
press, the people who have made the
most money and won the most
medals? What about the activists, the
teachers? Why do I not hear about
achievement outside of the context of
winning and prestige'! A liberal
arts education is not a trade school to
be wealthy or "successful." The rea
son we come to college is to challenge
our minds, become better thinkers,
better human beings, armed with
knowledge of life's truths and convic
tion in who were are to venture into
the real world and face its inevitable
hardships.
I urge the university to take a
look at how its utopian-like pressure
to be happy and its biased emphasis
on "profitable" jobs actually under
mines students' ultimate happiness.
In fact, these misguided priorities
get in the way of letting students do
what they are meant to do in college:
wade into the self-discovery that
arcs across our maddening exis
tences. At its purest, education isn't
about providing us with answers, as
the promise of a lucrative job might
lead one to believe. As educator
Mark Lilla put it, speaking to a group
of freshmen: "The real reason you
were excited about college was
because you had questions, buckets
of questions, not life plans and Pow
erPoint presentations. My students
convinced me that they are far less
interested in getting what they want
than in figuring out just what it is
that's worth wanting."

Atex would, lave to hear about your
experiences with the humanities.

architects, where was National Geo
graphic, The New York Times? Per
haps companies like these don't
pluck smart college students like
consulting firms do, but with Stan
ford's resources, is it out of their
power to bring them to campus for at
least an information session? Why
are the heroes, touted by Stanford's
press, the people who have made the
most money and won the most
medals? What about the activists, the
teachers? Why do I not hear about
achievement outside of the context of
winning and prestige'! A liberal
arts education is not a trade school to
be wealthy or "successful." The rea
son we come to college is to challenge
our minds, become better thinkers,
better human beings, armed with
knowledge of life's truths and convic
tion in who were are to venture into
the real world and face its inevitable
hardships.
I urge the university to take a
look at how its utopian-like pressure
to be happy and its biased emphasis
on "profitable" jobs actually under
mines students' ultimate happiness.
In fact, these misguided priorities
get in the way of letting students do
what they are meant to do in college:
wade into the self-discovery that
arcs across our maddening exis
tences. At its purest, education isn't
about providing us with answers, as
the promise of a lucrative job might
lead one to believe. As educator
Mark Lilla put it, speaking to a group
of freshmen: "The real reason you
were excited about college was
because you had questions, buckets
of questions, not life plans and Pow
erPoint presentations. My students
convinced me that they are far less
interested in getting what they want
than in figuring out just what it is
that's worth wanting."

This column is the second in a two
part series examining the connec
tions between happiness, pressure
and the study of the humanities at
Stanford.

Last year, I found myself debat
ing three of my friends, all
some variation of techie-ness.
"Humanities feed your soul," I
offered desperately. I criticized
excessive time and money spent on
research, since much of it is simply
funneled into the vortex of academia,
never to be seen again. My friend
pointed out that research could cure
cancer. I felt tempted to fire back
that cancers are often traced to man
made chemicals, more often that not
produced in these very laboratories,
and then launched into a tirade about
the ghastly ways in which technology
has compromised meaningful human
connection. This did not get me very
far. "Well," I offered, stomaching my
lack of conviction, "In grief, what do
you turn to? Science may explain
death, but it does not heal grief. A

poem can make you feel better." This
was met with blank stares, so I quick
ly amended it: "A song can make you
feel better."
I left the room, disappointed that
I had only managed to half-heartedly
convince them (and even that wasn't
such a sure point, for maybe they had
just taken pity on the dying pit bull).
If anything, I had become less con
vinced myself. I hadn't been able to
prove the worth of the humanities; I
hadn't even addressed what makes
writing a novel as equally important
to civilization as designing a wind
turbine. A song can make you
feel better. Was this paltry line my
best argument?
In Seneca's "On the Shortness of
Life," he advises his friend Paulinus,
"It is not that we have a short time to
live, but that we waste a lot of it." To
imbue our lives with wisdom and
clarity, look no further "high priests
of liberal studies," the philosophers
who have taken to task hard ques
tions like, "What is the meaning of
life?" Seneca writes: "By the toil of

others we are let into the presence of
things which have been brought from
darkness into light... None of these
will be too busy to see you, none of
these will not send his visitor away
happier and more devoted to himself,
none of these will allow anyone to
depart empty-handed. They are at
home to all mortals by night and by
day." For now, I like to think, a good
book will suffice.
I do need to make one important
clarification: lest this argument be
mistaken for a critique of the sci
ences and a manifesto declaring that
all students should be classics and
English majors, I should say the
problem here is not biology or com
puter science or mechanical engi
neering. There are plenty of devout
ly passionate students who study the
sciences (and can understand them,
God bless you), who want to push the
fold of human knowledge further,
who dream of changing the world for
the better. This is as noble a cause as
any.
No, the problem is the never-end
ing career fairs, the looming recruit
ment rounds, the pressure felt by so
many here to not just secure a job,
but a damn good one, one with the
kind of clout and money-earning
potential to make the university
proud. I wonder: how many gradu
ates become elementary school
teachers who arguably have an
impact unparalleled by other profes
sions? What is that number com
pared to the number of students who
enter consulting or marketing, nei
ther of which they likely knew about
in high school and, I suspect, aren't
terribly passionate about even as
they go down that route? The curios
ity students have nourished since
childhood is squandered in profes
sions whose focus is, in the ultimate
end, to make money Choos
ing this path is not unreasonable. Job
security is frightful right now, and
many take these positions knowing
it'll help them land better ones they
actually like doing.
But I fear too many students are
getting sucked, irreversibly into a
vacuum wherein profit is an impostor
for purpose and competition a means
of lifestyle. The worst part is that the
university, with its eagerness to
bring recruiters and its more-than
friendly, deeply biased relationship
with Silicon Valley, promotes these
kinds of jobs. I went to a job fair at
White Plaza once. I passed booths
touting careers I had never heard of,

firms with sterile names. It was all
very intimidating, so I beelined for
the Walt Disney booth, hoping to find
their information about being a sto
ry-boarder or an artist. Standing
behind a girl dressed in business
slacks, I scanned the poster. Disney
was here to recruit future marketers,
legal team members, potential execu
tives. My grin faded.
Stanford's approach to career
building is very one-sided. Where
was the creative contingent among
all these employers? Where were the
architects, where was National Geo
graphic, The New York Times? Per
haps companies like these don't
