## OAPE cup measures alc. intake 
### MARY HARRISON 
The Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE) is trying a new
tool to promote safe drinking on cam
pus: a plastic red cup with lines
marking the standard drink size for
hard liquor, wine and beer. OAPE
has distributed the cups to kitchen
managers in every Row house, with
each house getting at least one cup
per resident, and to Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
staff members.
OAPE has created a video to pub
licize the program online, and they
plan on handing out the cups to
freshmen in dining halls near all
frosh dorms. The initial order was
for 10,000 cups so that any student
who wanted a cup could have one,
according to OAPE.
The move is a response to a rise
in alcohol-related transports over
the past few years. The 53 alcohol
related transports in the 2010-2011
school year rose to 77 in the 2011-12
year, according to statistics from the
Stanford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS).
The red cups are marked with
black lines at the 1.5 oz., 5 oz. and 12
oz. levels to delineate the serving
size for hard alcohol, wine and beer,
respectively. The cup also has a QR
code that leads to a link to download
OAPE's app, launched this fall.
OAPE recruited the help of stu
dents in CS 193P: iPhone and iPad
Application Programming to create
the app that could help students drink
safely. Jaron Moore 'l4 won the con
test, and his app has been downloaded
295 times so far.
"The idea was basically a [blood
alcohol concentration] calculator
that could give normative feedback
based on wherever someone was
throughout the night," said Sam
Saenz 'll, OAPE outreach and
intern coordinator.
The user inputs his or her sex and
weight and then clicks on the icons of
a shot glass, a wine glass or a beer bot
tle to indicate what kind of drink they
have had.
Jarreau Bowen 'O7 MAOB,
OAPE's outreach education coordina
tor, said that he believes that the cup
will be well received because many
students would like to measure their
drinks more accurately
Saenz said that people are less
likely to be transported if they are
keeping track of their alcohol con
sumption.
"We know that students who keep
track [of their chinks] have less prob
lems than those who don't," Saenz
said.
Although OAPE hopes that the
red cup can help decrease the num
ber of transports, they said the pro
gram is more aimed at "social
drinkers."
"We do a lot to support people on
two extremes... so we wanted to do
something for the social drinkers,"
said Angelina Cardona 'll, assistant
director and community engagement
coordinator for OAPE,
Cardona added that while
OAPE's Cardinal Nights program
serves largely nondrinkers and light
drinkers, Saenz and Bowen often
have meetings with students who
have had serious alcohol-related inci
dents.
The red cup is meant to cater to
those who "want to be able to experi
ence what everyone would consider
the positive effects of alcohol while
minimizing the negative conse
quences," Bowen said.
"Stay classy: that's our motto,"
Saenz said.
