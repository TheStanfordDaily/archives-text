# THAT'S HOT
## REAL LIFE SEX Why porn is FALSE advertisement SEX TALK with the TREE 
### 
Open scene. A busty blonde
with perfectly shaped nipples
(you know, those kinds of
nipples that always look like it is freez
ing outside) walks into her "teacher's"
classroom to work for that A+.
Throughout the video, the "teacher's"
penis somehow stays erect for what
seems like forever. And of course, the
buxom blonde, who is definitely not
in high school, has no problems
becoming wet and aroused, and it
seems that with every touch she has a
screaming, intense orgasm.
But lets be real, this is not usually
reality. Spoiler alert: everyone's vulvas
and penises look and behave differ
ently in real life. For example, if you
are a girl, chances are one of your
boobs is probably slightly larger than
the other. So, unfortunately, the ideal
hookup that you had planned for
tonight will most likely not resemble a
scene with seasoned adult film stars
James Deen and Cytheria.
Instead, these are real, awkward
hookup encounters from some
Stanford students:
"After cooking a nice romantic din
ner, my boyfriend tried to carry me
into the bedroom, only to hit my knee
really hard on the doorway. Needless
to say I spent the next five minutes
crying instead of kissing."
"I was giving oral sex to my
boyfriend, and I got one of those

uncontrollable tickles in my throat. I
spent the next ten minutes coughing
in the corner, so I did not cough on
his penis ..."
"This one time I was having sex with
my boyfriend. We were in a reverse
cowgirl position, and I totally farted.
He was like, 'Um, did you just queef?'
and I said 'yah mhmm ... But then
it started to 5me11..."
"My boyfriend was having sex with
me from behind, and as he thrust
out, he accidentally thrust back into
the wrong hole ..."
"Sometimes, after a long day, I just
get tired during sex, and I kind of
just want to stop and go to sleep."
"My boyfriend thought it would be
sexy to finish on my breasts. But his
timing and angle were off, and he
ended up getting it all over his own
chin ..."
Other totally normal parts of
real sex that you probably won't see in
porn, unless you are watching porn
bloopers (which I highly recom
mend):
1. Sometimes the condom
wrapper is difficult to open. Of
course, this always happens when you
are in the moment and ready to go,
and then you struggle as the wrapper
barely rips 0.00001 centimeters at a

time. Though it may seem sexy to just
rip it with your teeth, this can actually
inadvertently rip the condom itself.
Especially if you are using lube, that
little package (no pun intended) is
hard to open. Take a breath, don't
rush; if your partner is about to have
sex, chances are they won't leave in
the time it takes you to open the
condom. You can even use it as a
purposeful tease like, "Oh, look how
slowly I can open this condom!"

2. Especially if you have been
playing beer pong all night, O"
even if you are really stressed
about an exam the next day,

sometimes you just can't
get it up or keep it up.

For your partner: don't
worry; despite popu-

lar belief, men are
not always ready for

sex all the time. This
does not mean that there

is something wrong with

you! Believe it or not, a lot of things
can affect whether a guy gets hard or
not. Try not to make a big deal out of
it; the more you think about it, the
less likely you are to rise to the occa
sion. Sometimes it works to put the
condom on (even if he is flaccid) and
then engage in some foreplay for a
while, trying to distract from the pres-

sure of getting it up. After a while, he
will most likely be ready to go, if he
has not drunkenly passed out already.

3. Weird noises are
bound to happen. You
might get a weird gur
gle in your throat as
you are kissing. Your
chests might collide
and create a farting
noise. There are awk
ward slapping and

smacking sounds. If these
sounds gross you out, put some music
on (I obviously put "All Right Now"

on repeat). Touchdown.
Or just embrace them
your body is a
beautiful thing!

Sex and porn can both be

I great, but it is important to
know that one is obvi
ously produced fan
tasy and one is reali
ty. Face it, sex is adult
film stars' job; they

practice and are
professionals in
their field. They get
paid to make it look
good.

Chances
- are,if
j you are
being
paid to code for Google,
you are not having as much prac
tice perfecting your inverse lotus sex
position.

Most likely, your Pizza Hut
Delivery man will be a prepubescent,
squeaky-voiced boy with acne and
not a 6-foot tall muscular man who
happens to have "a sausage for

you." You may never organically have
sex like a porn star, but if you are
open to it, try some role-play scenar
ios. You can enjoy porn, and you can
enjoy sex you can even enjoy porn
and sex at the same time but don't
be disillusioned when you can't copy
the exact moves as smoothly as you
see in videos on Red Tube.
