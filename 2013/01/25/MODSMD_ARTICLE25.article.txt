Jen Goldberg 'l6's tattoo isn't one you will
see every day. I'm her roommate, and I did
n't see it until a month into school. I casually
asked about it one day in fall quarter, not
expecting the emotional story behind the body
ink.
Jen explained that she brainstormed her
tattoo idea with one of her friends and designed
it during her sophomore year of high school.
"It's all about the warm and fuzzies," she
began, detailing the origins of her tattoo and
explaining how she struggled with depression in
high school. Her depression was incredibly tax
ing, but it was also hard to admit that she need
ed help. Dealing with her depression was the
first time her fiery, southern self had to lean on
others.

The tattoo itself features fuzzy hands grasp
ing an anatomically correct heart. Once Jen
marries, she is planning to finish off the tattoo
with a crown above the heart to resemble a
Claddagh ring, the Irish ring that is worn to
indicate whether one is single or married. She
smile, telling me not to worry. "I thought this all
the way through." Her future husband, she says,
will ultimately be the one that she leans on the
most.
Jen got her tattoo two days after her high
school graduation to commemorate her battle
with depression. It serves as a daily reminder of
the people that were there for her during hard
times and a reminder that it is acceptable to lean
on others for support.
