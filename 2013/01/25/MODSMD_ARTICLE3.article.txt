## RACHAEL FLATT Professional figure skater juggles academics, competition 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
Like many Stanford students,
Rachael Flatt 'l5 doesn't know
what her future holds. But unlike
most of her peers, she is not
attempting to figure out her first
career. Instead, she is preparing to transi
tion into her second.

Before graduating from high school,
Flatt won the 2010 U.S. National Figure
Skating Championship and skated to sev
enth at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A
year later, Flatt enrolled at Stanford, intend
ing to pursue a degree while continuing to
compete professionally.

Since 2011, however, injuries have taken
them toll. Last summer, Flatt re-aggravated
three bulging discs in her back, and devel
oped tendonitis in her ankles after returning
to training. In October, Flatt was forced to
withdraw from the rest of the 2012-13 com
petition circuit to give herself time to heal.
She only recently began training again for
an exhibition show in February.
'At this point it's just a day-by day thing,"
Flatt said. "I'm not entirely sure if I will be
able to return and compete again, which
would be disappointing, but I really hope I
can get back out there and do some more
work."
Flatt's skating career began at a mall in
her native San Diego when she was four.

the food court, she begged her dad for a tick-

Despite suffering a string of injuries last year, Rachael Flatt '15, prospective biology
major and professional figure skater, hopes to return to the rink in February.
et to rent skates.
'As a kid, Rachael loved skiing,
ballet, gymnastics, Girl Scouts, piano
and skating," said her mother, Jody
Flatt. "Over time, she began drop
ping other activities because she
wanted to do more and more skat
ing."
Flatt said that she originally
planned to pursue pairs skating, but
her singles career took off when she
won the novice-level U.S. National
Championships in 2005. In 2007,
Flatt competed in the senior World
Figure Skating Championships,
placing fifth.
"When she competed at the
Worlds for the first time, where it
was all Olympic-level skaters and
she finished fifth, we were all like,
'Okay this is real,'" Jody Flatt said.
'And then when she qualified for the
Olympics, that was like the sprinkles
on top of the cake."
At the Vancouver Olympics, Flatt
set a new personal best score, earn
ing seventh place.
"Everything about that whole
[Olympic] experience brings back
amazing memories," Flatt said. 'All
the hard work that I put into my
skating up to that point really paid
off, and it was so refreshing to have
that moment where I could think
that I finally made it."
Amidst her Olympic prepara
tions, Flatt found time to apply to
nine different colleges, including
Stanford. According to her mother,
Flatt received her acceptance letter
while sorting through junk mail after
returning from Vancouver.
"I saw the envelope from Stan
ford, but I could tell that it was one
sheet of paper," Jody Flatt said. "I
called upstairs to Rachael, but I
don't think she heard me so I opened
it up and saw that it was an accept
ance letter. She was thrilled she
couldn't stop screaming."
Flatt ultimately selected Stan
ford over Princeton, but decided to
defer her admission for a year to
focus on skating. Since arriving on
the Farm in September 2011, Flatt
has commuted to San Jose and Oak
land for two- to three-hour practices
five days a week.

At Stanford, Flatt developed a
passion for medicine after two intro
ductory seminars, Exploring Sports
Medicine and Procedural Anatomy
"At this point, I'd love to do some
thing in orthopedics or orthopedic

surgery, but I'm not entirely sure
because I haven't had a lot of experi
ence going to hospitals and shadow
ing doctors," Flatt said. "I'm actually
participating in [Stanford Immer
sion in Medicine] this quarter to try
to get a better idea of what I would
like to do."
According to Flatt's Procedural
Anatomy professors Bruce Fogel and
Sakti Srivastava, Flatt was "one of
the stars of the class" from day one.
"From everything from knowl
edge to personality to temperament,
she will be very well suited for medi
cine," Srivastava said.
Her focus on academics is noth
ing new. According to Jody, her only
daughter has always been focused on
academics.
"We go by the phrase 'student
athlete,' and student comes first in
that phrase for a reason," she said.
"By the time she was in first grade,
she knew that if she had homework,
it had to be done [in order to skate],
but it never became an issue."
Outside the classroom, Flatt is
heavily involved in campus life. She
performs with the dance group
Urban Styles, teaches special-needs
children how to skate as part of Spe
cial Skaters and is applying to be a
Resident Assistant (RA) next year.
Toke Odimayomi 'l5, who lived
with Flatt in Rinconada, said she was
an active member of her freshman
dorm.
"She is so good at balance and
organization," said Odimayomi. "She
knows what she has to do, and she
gets it done, but she still has fim."
Flatt said the key is managing
her priorities.
"It's just making sure you're
really efficient with your time," Flatt
said. "There are so many things
going on at Stanford, and it's hard to
say no, but at the same time you
have to stick to your guns and make
sure you are following your pas
sions."
Right now, skating is Flatt's pas
sion, even as she battles back from
her injuries. Though faced with the
reality that her injuries may prevent
her from returning to competition,
Flatt said she is prepared to move on
if she must.
"It's hard to say that [my career
will end] because it's been such a big
part of my life for so long," Flatt
said. "But it's been such a great ride,
and if that's the end, I made the most
of it... At this point, I have a lot of
other things in my life that I would
like to concentrate on too."
