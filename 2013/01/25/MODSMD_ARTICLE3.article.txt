Like many Stanford students,
Rachael Flatt 'l5 doesn't know
what her future holds. But unlike
most of her peers, she is not
attempting to figure out her first
career. Instead, she is preparing to transi
tion into her second.

Before graduating from high school,
Flatt won the 2010 U.S. National Figure
Skating Championship and skated to sev
enth at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A
year later, Flatt enrolled at Stanford, intend
ing to pursue a degree while continuing to
compete professionally.

Since 2011, however, injuries have taken
them toll. Last summer, Flatt re-aggravated
three bulging discs in her back, and devel
oped tendonitis in her ankles after returning
to training. In October, Flatt was forced to
withdraw from the rest of the 2012-13 com
petition circuit to give herself time to heal.
She only recently began training again for
an exhibition show in February.
'At this point it's just a day-by day thing,"
Flatt said. "I'm not entirely sure if I will be
able to return and compete again, which
would be disappointing, but I really hope I
can get back out there and do some more
work."
Flatt's skating career began at a mall in
her native San Diego when she was four.
After watching the skaters in the rink under
the food court, she begged her dad for a tick-
