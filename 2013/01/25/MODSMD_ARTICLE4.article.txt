# Self-designed humanities majors axed
## Engineering majors unaffected, students petition to keep program 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO 
Stanford's School of Humanities and Sciences has dis
continued its Individually-Designed Major (IDM) pro
gram, which previously allowed undergraduates to con
struct and pursue their own curriculum outside of exist
ing departments. There are currently only two IDM stu
dents in the School of Humanities and Sciences, accord
ing to Susan Weersing, associate dean of graduate and
undergraduate studies.
Those students currently accepted into an IDM will be
allowed to finish their study, and the IDM program in the
School of Engineering will remain unaffected by the
changes.
A petition started by current IDM student David Ngo
'l3 seeks to "save the program" and had 31 signatures as
of Thursday night.
Making 'academic sense'
The decision to eliminate the program, according to
Susan Weersing, associate dean of graduate and under
graduate studies, is the one that makes "the most aca
demic and structural sense for the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
"At present, the School of Humanities and Sciences
offers more than 100 undergraduate degrees, including
majors, minors and interdisciplinary honors," Weersing
said. "Not only is there this multitude of options, but the
degree programs that are offered are incredibly
diverse."
She emphasized the flexibility within majors, which
allow for individually designed concentrations, as well as
the constant introduction of new programs in responses
to student interests, as reasons why the IDM program is
no longer necessary.
This year, for example, has seen the advent of a new
Spanish major. Next year, two more minors will be added.
While the IDM programs will no longer be an option
to individual students, it still has its role to play within the
school, according to Weersing.
"We're not going to discontinue the IDM as a mecha
nism within the school," she said. "We want the IDM
available to pilot new degree programs."
This involves designing new majors in areas with
heavy student interest. If the pilots are successful, the
majors are then moved to another department, as was the
case with Jewish studies, which was an IDM until it was
moved to the Department of Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity (CSRE) this year.
Medieval studies, on the other hand, is an example of
an IDM that never became an official major due to a lack
of student interest.
Eliminating an opportunity
Those who see the IDM pro
gram as a symbol of the Universi
ty's pioneering and adventurous
attitude, especially current IDM
students, criticized the change.
Ngo is one of the few students
to have taken advantage of the
IDM. He described his decision to
design and major in behavior
design as the "turning point" of
his life.
He began circulating a peti
tion on social networking sites
last week in an attempt to garner
support for the IDM program. As
the first person to sign it, he
wrote,
"The IDM program (has given
me) [sic] and gives these future
students the opportunity to expe
rience the unconventional college
education that fits their unconven
tional interests, values and
visions."
This feeling is echoed by Greg
Watkins 'B5, assistant director of
the Structural Liberal Education
(SLE) program, who designed his
own major in social theory while
an undergraduate at Stanford.
"Education is bigger than any
one discipline," Watkins said. "To

be well educated is not necessari
ly to be discipline bound; it is pos
sible to put together a collective
course of study that does a lot for
somebody without training them
in a discipline."

David Herman 'l6, who is
undeclared, said he dreamed
about following in their footsteps
and designing his own major even
before setting foot on campus. He
said the IDM program was a big
part of his decision to come to
Stanford, and he felt the program
embodied the very essence of a
pioneering and liberal institution.

"I feel like a tree that is about
to be felled before ever growing to
its full height," Herman said. "If
they get rid of this program, what
does it say about the institution as
a whole ... ? The IDM program
exemplifies so much of what Stan
ford means to me and to others,
and it would be a sad day if the
program were ever discontinued."
Herman and Ngo both prom
ised to leave no stone unturned in
their efforts to keep the IDM pro
gram alive for individual students.
"I felt that so much went on
behind closed doors, without any
consultation from the student
body," Herman said. "I don't think
they can make a final decision with
out hearing our opinions."
