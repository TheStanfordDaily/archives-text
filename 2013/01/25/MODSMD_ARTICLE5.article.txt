## Study finds fault with global education survey GSE research shows U.S. education system not as bad as previously thought 
### HELIN GAO 
"The hard truth is that other high-performing
nations have passed us by during the last two
decades. Americans need to wake up to this edu
cational reality, instead of napping at the wheel
while emerging competitors prepare their stu
dents for economic leadership," Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan said in a 2010 press

release responding to test results showing large
gaps between the national performance of Amer
ican students and students in high-performing
nations such as Korea and Finland.
But a recently released study by Martin
Carnoy, professor at the Stanford Graduate
School of Education, and his research partner,
Richard Rothstein of the Economic Policy Insti
tute, argues that this assessment might be too
harsh and that, in fact, international education
ranking reports misinterpret the United States'
global ranking.
According to the study's findings, a re-esti

mate would improve the United States' place in
the ranking of all Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development countries from
14th to 4th in reading and 25th to 10th in math
based on the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA) test administered in 2011.
The study describes these international rank
ing reports as "oversimplified, frequently exag
gerated and misleading," which for Carnoy pres
ents a serious practical problem.
"These test scores are now playing a very
important role, influencing
policy research in many coun
tries," Carnoy said, "It's very
important to see whether the
way the result is presented
accurately reflects the quality
of education system in the
country."
Carnoy and Rothstein's
study, "What do international
tests really show about U.S.
student performance?" took a
closer look at the PISA and
Trends in International
Mathematics and Science
Study (TIMSS) databases
and recalculated the United
States' student performance
after accounting for the dif
ferent social class composi
tion of sampled students.
"The United States, com
pared to other developed
countries, has a much higher
fraction of low social class stu
dents taking the test,"
Carnoy said.
The study found that dis
advantaged and lower-mid
dle-class U.S. students per
form better than comparable
students in similar post
industrial countries in read
ing, and perform about the
same in math.
Meanwhile, comparisons
of test score trends across
time shows that the United

States has made greater
improvement in both math
and reading than top-scoring
countries, such as Korea,
Canada and Finland.
"If you look at Korean
students' performance in
reading compared to U.S.
students' performance, we
see that our students are
making gains, while Korean
students are not," Carnoy
said.
The report also shows that
in some middle- and upper
class groups where U.S. per
formance has not improved,
comparable social class group
performance in some top
scoring post-industrial coun
tries has declined.
But while controlling for
social class distribution would
narrow the difference in aver
age scores between these
countries and the United
States, it would not eliminate
the gap.
At all points in the social
class distribution, U.S. stu
dents perform worse than
students in a group of top
scoring countries, according
to the research. Carnoy won
ders whether this is actually a
problem that needs attention.
"Do we want to score as
high as Korean students? Is
this our single objective in our
education system?" Carnoy
asked. "Probably not."
Carnoy attributed the dis
crepancy in test performance
to greater investment of

Korean parents on education
outside of school by sending
their children to for-profit
private schools called hag
wons, where students receive
private, after-hour tutoring.
"I believe that the test
scores of our students can go
up if we are willing to spend
as much money outside of
school," Carnoy said.
Despite what the authors
say is an incorrect interpreta
tion of international test rank
ings, Carnoy remarked that
the ranking's influence on our
present education system is
not necessarily "detrimental".
"Our policy is oriented
very heavily around school
and teacher accountability,"
Carnoy said, "We are also
making many efforts to raise
our curriculum standards and
have our teachers meet up
these standards."
"However, first thing we
have to do is to do a better job
in identifying whether our
system is improving, and we
have done that in this paper,"
he added.
In future research,
Carnoy said he and Rothstein
will examine the reasons for
differences in academic per
formance across states
where, within the same social
classes and ethnic groups,
there are wide gaps in test
scores.

said.
The report also shows that
in some middle- and upper
class groups where U.S. per
formance has not improved,
comparable social class group
performance in some top
scoring post-industrial coun
tries has declined.
But while controlling for
social class distribution would
narrow the difference in aver
age scores between these
countries and the United
States, it would not eliminate
the gap.
At all points in the social
class distribution, U.S. stu
dents perform worse than
students in a group of top
scoring countries, according
to the research. Carnoy won
ders whether this is actually a
problem that needs attention.
"Do we want to score as
high as Korean students? Is
this our single objective in our
education system?" Carnoy
asked. "Probably not."
Carnoy attributed the dis
crepancy in test performance
to greater investment of

Korean parents on education
outside of school by sending
their children to for-profit
private schools called hag
wons, where students receive
private, after-hour tutoring.
"I believe that the test
scores of our students can go
up if we are willing to spend
as much money outside of
school," Carnoy said.
Despite what the authors
say is an incorrect interpreta
tion of international test rank
ings, Carnoy remarked that
the ranking's influence on our
present education system is
not necessarily "detrimental".
"Our policy is oriented
very heavily around school
and teacher accountability,"
Carnoy said, "We are also
making many efforts to raise
our curriculum standards and
have our teachers meet up
these standards."
"However, first thing we
have to do is to do a better job
in identifying whether our
system is improving, and we
have done that in this paper,"
he added.
In future research,
Carnoy said he and Rothstein
will examine the reasons for
differences in academic per
formance across states
where, within the same social
classes and ethnic groups,
there are wide gaps in test
scores.
