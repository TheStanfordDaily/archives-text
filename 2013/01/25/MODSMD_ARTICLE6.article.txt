## Faculty Senate discusses diversity among professors 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard reports on
faculty diversity and conflicts in academ
ic scheduling at its Thursday meeting,
with the latter report potentially opening
the door to a comprehensive overhaul of
students' daily course schedules.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, profes
sor of civil and environmental engineer
ing, opened the meeting by briefly reflect
ing on the Stanford football team's victory
in the 2013 Rose Bowl and applauding the
selection of Lucy Shapiro, professor of
developmental biology, as a recipient of
the National Medal of Science.
Levitt also reviewed a number of top

ics that senators suggested merited the
body's consideration before the end of
the academic year. Topics include faculty
oversight over the Department of Athlet
ics; the rapid increase in the cost of col
lege education; the popularity of the
peer-reviewed course evaluation website
Course√üank; and the number of academ
ic Honor Code violations.
"[Cheating] has been a huge topic for
us," said Eric Roberts, professor of com
puter science.
Roberts suggested that full disclosure
of his department's rising tally of Honor
Code violations would mean "you would
get Stanford if you searched for cheating
