## Faculty Senate discusses diversity among professors 
### MARSHALL WATKINS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Faculty Senate heard reports on
faculty diversity and conflicts in academ
ic scheduling at its Thursday meeting,
with the latter report potentially opening
the door to a comprehensive overhaul of
students' daily course schedules.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, profes
sor of civil and environmental engineer
ing, opened the meeting by briefly reflect
ing on the Stanford football team's victory
in the 2013 Rose Bowl and applauding the
selection of Lucy Shapiro, professor of
developmental biology, as a recipient of
the National Medal of Science.
Levitt also reviewed a number of top

ics that senators suggested merited the
body's consideration before the end of
the academic year. Topics include faculty
oversight over the Department of Athlet
ics; the rapid increase in the cost of col
lege education; the popularity of the
peer-reviewed course evaluation website
Courseßank; and the number of academ
ic Honor Code violations.
"[Cheating] has been a huge topic for
us," said Eric Roberts, professor of com
puter science.
Roberts suggested that full disclosure
of his department's rising tally of Honor
Code violations would mean "you would
get Stanford if you searched for cheating

on the web rather than Har
vard."
Faculty also expressed
concern about Courseßank's
popularity among students,
singling out the website's
aggregation of reviewing stu
dents' grades as potentially
leading other students to
pick courses that appear
more leniently graded.
"It's one way that they
can get comments on the
effectiveness of the instruc
tor," countered Dean of
Research Ann Arvin, noting

that Stanford doesn't pub
licly release students' course
evaluations. "There are ben
efits to the students."
Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 took
issue with the characteriza
tion of tuition costs as being
universally higher for stu
dents, noting that increased
financial support by the Uni
versity has reduced the bur
den for most students.
"We've been steadily
declining throughout the
2000s ... due to financial
aid," Etchemendy said.
Earlier starting class time?
University Registrar Tom
Black framed his report on
class scheduling conflicts as a

pressing challenge for
administrators, noting that
over 1,000 students voluntar
ily schedule class conflicts
each quarter in the lack of
any University oversight.
Black identified a concen
tration of classes from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. as a major
cause of the conflicts, propos
ing instead a more regiment
ed block system of classes
starting as early as 8:30 a.m.
He acknowledged the diffi
culty of undertaking such a
significant change, as well as
the likelihood of prompting
broad student discontent,
but argued that such a sys
tem would ultimately offer
students more flexibility.
"I don't think we should

be reluctant to go to the 8:30
starting time," said Richard
Sailer, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"[Previous attempts at simi
lar scheduling] didn't seem to
create a problem."
Senators expressed skep
ticism about students' will
ingness to attend earlier
classes, noting that even 9
a.m. classes suffer from low
attendance, and expressed
concern about the potentially
detrimental impact of earlier
starting times on students'
learning, which the Universi
ty has yet to study. Senators
also called for greater
involvement by administra
tors in regulating obvious
conflicts between classes.
"There are conflicts all
over the place," Etchemendy
said. "There's no way to
know what are relevant con
flicts ... It's really important
that departments pay atten
tion to what their students
are taking [and coordinate
accordingly]."
Gender equilibrium 28 years
away
Karen Cook '6B, vice
provost for faculty develop
ment and diversity, and Han
nah Valantine, School of
Medicine senior associate
dean for diversity, delivered
a presentation of faculty loss
es and gains, as well as the
progress of efforts to
increase faculty diversity.
Faculty numbers have
grown slightly over the last
decade, from 1699 professo
riate faculty members in
2001 to 1934 in 2011. Over the
same period, the proportion
of female professors grew

from 13 to 21 percent of total
faculty, though the propor
tion of female assistant and
associate professors
remained relatively constant.
The number of under
represented (URM) faculty
members grew by nearly a
third over the same period,
from 101 to 133. The propor
tion of URM and female fac
ulty who received tenure
increased across the board.
"We need to be a bit more
proactive [about hiring URM
faculty]," Cook said. "That
was the same news I gave
two years ago ...The good
news with women is that
they're moving up the lad
der."
Valantine drew specific
attention to the School of
Medicine's efforts to increase
diversity in leadership posi
tions, pointing to grants,
workshops and networking
opportunities as means of
prompting female and URM
faculty to aspire to higher
positions and complement
the School's existing expert
ise.
"The social justice aspect
is important, but I think
we've transcended that,"
Valantine said. "Without
diversity, we are not going to
be able to solve complex
problems."
While the number of
female leaders at the School
of Medicine has increased by
small amounts over the last
decade, Valantine empha
sized at the current rate, it
would take 28 years until
gender equilibrium is
reached a number she
said was far too long. She
called for greater interven

tion in hiring decisions and
workplace relations.
"The workplace must
adjust to meet the needs of
the [modern worker]," Valan
tine said. "It's going to call
for a change in the culture."
Jeremy Weinstein, pro
fessor of political science,
expressed concern that cur
rent University hiring trends
largely drawing from a
pool of more experienced but
less diverse professors
risks delaying the ability to
attain full gender and racial
equilibrium.
"Leadership matters,"
said Andrea Goldsmith, pro
fessor of electrical engineer
ing. "It's not enough to have
it come just from the top. It
needs to trickle down all the
way to the department
chairs."
Roberts questioned a
common practice of not hir
ing the University's own
recent doctoral graduates
immediately, noting that
many female or URM candi
dates are instead hired by
peer institutions.
"This sounds like a rea
sonable position from first
principles, but it has this
inevitable discriminatory
effect," Roberts said. "This is
probably not something to be
so firm about, if your goal is
to increase diversity."
The Senate will hear
reports from Director of Ath
letics Bernard Muir and
from the Committee for the
Review of Undergraduate
Majors at the body's next
meeting on Feb. 7.
