## she++ hopes for new gains in second year

Ellora Israni 'l4 and Ayna Agar
wal 'l4 are co-founders of she++, a
Stanford-based community for
women in technology that has been
featured on Tech Crunch, Forbes
and the Huffington Post. The pair
has worked for the past year to
bring more women into the fields of
technology and engineering.
While their greatest achieve
ment to date has been their inaugu
ral conference, which drew 250 par
ticipants to discuss the difficulties
and possibilities of being women in
computer science, they are ramping
up efforts to add a documentary
and mentorship program.
The documentary will feature a
number of women in technology,
and Israni and Agarwal hope to
screen it across the nation. The idea
for the documentary came from the
founders' experience at she++'s
first conference.
"A lot of the stories that were
told at she++ at the conference
were ... stories that would have
compelled you to do something, to
take action," Israni said.
The mentorship program will
pair high school students with
women in computer science profes
sions.
"This is something really unique
and something that doesn't really
exist today in our nation," Agarwal
said.
Some of the mentors will be com
posed of a team she++ calls "The
League of Extraordinary Young
Women," and the program will be
launched with the release of the doc
umentary, which is planned for
national screenings in the summer
or the beginning of the 2013-14 aca
demic year.
They also hope to build on the
success of their first conference.
Last year, the conference hosted
eleven speakers. This year, the con
ference will add workshops for its
participants.
"We're collaborating with the
d.school and a lot of our sponsors ...
to have smaller breakdown work
shops, so people actually are...
engaging themselves, asking their
questions, coming out of the confer
ence having made something or

achieved something," said Saguna
Goel 'l5, conference co-chair.
The audience will be wider as
well.
"We're trying to bring in more
high school students, and even jun
ior high students," said Raiyan
Khan, 'l5, another conference co
chair.
"she++ serves ... [as] a vehicle
to see successful women and get
inspired," said Jennifer Widom,
chair of the Department of Comput
er Science.
"I think she++ really brings
women who are in the tech field who
a lot of female CS majors at Stan
ford can really look up to into the
forefront," Khan said.
Creating positive role models for
women in technology played an
important role in she++'s concep
tion.
Stanford's computer science pro
gram is one of the strongest in the
nation, and yet female enrollment,
despite showing strong increases,
still lags far behind the parity seen
in most other disciplines.
"Why isn't there more of a con
crete way to present these role
models to Stanford students, a
forum through which students can
brainstorm ways to defy those
stereotypes, negate the barriers?"
Agarwal said, describing the ques
tion she asked herself before found
ing the group.
"We both came in with an idea of
what it would be to be an engineer,"
Israni said. "The stereotype ... was
disproven by role models that we
saw on Stanford's campus, and we
wanted to make those role models
more accessible."
