## Why do these goons still have to fight? 
### Tom Taylor 
I checked off another achieve
ment on my sports-fan resume
this past weekend: I went to my
very first live NHL game to
watch the San Jose Sharks
crush the Colorado Avalanche 4-0.
While I have to admit that I and
The Daily's chief operating officer, who
accompanied me to the game, were a

not uncommon for tempers to boil over
in pretty much any other sport. But
what struck me most was the reaction
of everyone else in the arena.
Teammates and referees simply sat
back and watched, letting the players
