## Why do these goons still have to fight? 
### Tom Taylor 
I checked off another achieve
ment on my sports-fan resume
this past weekend: I went to my
very first live NHL game to
watch the San Jose Sharks
crush the Colorado Avalanche 4-0.
While I have to admit that I and
The Daily's chief operating officer, who
accompanied me to the game, were a
little confused about some of the refer
eeing calls made in the game I used
to think icing was the sugary layer on
top of a cake —we were helped out by
some friendly Sharks fans and the
experience was definitely a worthwhile
use of 40 dollars.
Helped by a poor performance
from the Avalanche, the Sharks domi
nated this game. Early on, the play
looked close, but as Colorado suffered
with penalties it gave San Jose many
chances to play with an extra-man
power-play advantage. The Sharks
capitalized with two goals scored at the
end of the first period and never really
looked back. Though the visiting team
was a little unlucky with shots deflect
ed off the Sharks' goalposts, by the end
San Jose clearly deserved victory
However, despite the relatively
cheap tickets and easy trip down on
Caltrain, I'm not convinced that I'll be
back again. There is still one thing that
might keep me away from becoming a
regular at NHL games, a perfect
example of which came at the end of
the first period.
Perhaps fueled by the emotion of
the contest, a fight broke out between
the Avalanche's Ryan O'Byrne and
Sharks' Brad Stewart with just over a
quarter of an hour gone in the game.
That in itself was perhaps unremark
able; I realize that fighting does occa
sionally take place in hockey and it's
not uncommon for tempers to boil over
in pretty much any other sport. But
what struck me most was the reaction
of everyone else in the arena.
Teammates and referees simply sat
back and watched, letting the players
fight it out, bare-knuckle style
without helmets or gloves, for
what felt like several minutes.
And meanwhile, the 17,000
strong crowd bayed for their
blood. Was I the only person
who felt deeply uncomfortable
about this?

Now, I realize this attitude
may mark my out as a hockey
newbie, but let's get serious
here. If these players had
picked their fight just outside
the Plexiglas walls of the rink,
they may very well have left the
stadium in handcuffs. I'm also
no hero, but had the same
brawl broken out in iront of me,
I wouldn't have stood idly by
gawking. I know that because
I've risked getting punched to
intervene in and break up
fights before.
How can we justify sus
pending our ethical and legal
rules just because these play
ers are out on the ice?
I realize, too, that fighting
has a long and established tradi
tion in hockey in North Ameri
ca. But "tradition" is no excuse.
Racism and sexism used to
have a "tradition" in most
major sports, but, while prob
lems with both do remain, the
majority of fans, players and
the relevant authorities recog
nize that this is simply not
acceptable anymore take,
for example, the racist abuse
thrown at AC Milan's Kevin-
Prince Boateng earlier this
month; Boateng's teammates
showed solidarity with him in
walking off and abandoning the
contest —. Why is calling
someone a name, however
deeply offensive, considered a
serious breach of sporting con
duct, yet smashing their face in
is harmless entertainment?
Even when the sports gov
erning bodies get it wrong,
most of us have a sufficient
moral code to realize what is
and isn't acceptable. FIFA
President Sepp Blatter has
gone on the record to threaten
clubs with forfeiting matches if
they abandon games due to
racist abuse, and he famously
declared in 2004 that the way to
improve women's soccer was to
"wear tighter shorts and low
cut shirts." It's no wonder that
most informed soccer fans have
little respect for Blatter.

Call me crazy but I honest
ly believe that sports is better
because of its efforts to remove
problems like racism and sex
ism. It's hard to understand
why violence and hockey
should be an exception.
There may of course be
some "fans" who only attend
games for the fights, much as
there were hooligans in the UK
in the 'Bos who used soccer
matches as an excuse to riot,
and there are people whose
major interest in auto racing
revolves around the crashes.
However, pandering to a dark
er side of human nature is nev
er productive. British soccer
stadiums are now seen as gen
erally safe places for families to
enjoy a game and attendance
figures as a result are much
higher than they were 30 years
ago. And while deaths do still
occur in auto racing, they are
much less frequent. Equipment
and rules have reduced crashes
and increased safety and as a
result we no longer have to suf
fer loss after loss of the most
exciting driving talent.
Supporters of fighting in
hockey rely on nothing more
than excuses to defend the
indefensible. Aes, other spoils
are violent, but boxing has
clear, defined rules that govern
it and ensure the risk to com
petitors is kept to a minimum.
While football by its very
nature often leads to injury it
applies rules to prevent brawl
ing, and most sensible sports
will eject and ban players for
this. Apparently fighting
serves to "protect" players, to
ensure certain infractions like
high-sticking, elbowing and
cross-checking don't get out of
hand. I guess the threat of
extreme violence is far better at
keeping players in line than ref
erees actually enforcing the
rules.

Don't even try to justify
this. If hockey is a worthwhile
spectator sport, it simply does
n't need the fights. It will stand
up for itself and draw attention
from real fans. If not, then I, for
one, don't need it in my sport
ing life.

been exposed to the excitement
of NHL '96, when- gloves come
off left and right and your
punching power has a meter.

I checked off another achieve
ment on my sports-fan resume
this past weekend: I went to my
very first live NHL game to
watch the San Jose Sharks
crush the Colorado Avalanche 4-0.
While I have to admit that I and
The Daily's chief operating officer, who
accompanied me to the game, were a
little confused about some of the refer
eeing calls made in the game I used
to think icing was the sugary layer on
top of a cake —we were helped out by
some friendly Sharks fans and the
experience was definitely a worthwhile
use of 40 dollars.
Helped by a poor performance
from the Avalanche, the Sharks domi
nated this game. Early on, the play
looked close, but as Colorado suffered
with penalties it gave San Jose many
chances to play with an extra-man
power-play advantage. The Sharks
capitalized with two goals scored at the
end of the first period and never really
looked back. Though the visiting team
was a little unlucky with shots deflect
ed off the Sharks' goalposts, by the end
San Jose clearly deserved victory
However, despite the relatively
cheap tickets and easy trip down on
Caltrain, I'm not convinced that I'll be
back again. There is still one thing that
might keep me away from becoming a
regular at NHL games, a perfect
example of which came at the end of
the first period.
Perhaps fueled by the emotion of
the contest, a fight broke out between
the Avalanche's Ryan O'Byrne and
Sharks' Brad Stewart with just over a
quarter of an hour gone in the game.
That in itself was perhaps unremark
able; I realize that fighting does occa
sionally take place in hockey and it's
not uncommon for tempers to boil over
in pretty much any other sport. But
what struck me most was the reaction
of everyone else in the arena.
Teammates and referees simply sat
back and watched, letting the players
fight it out, bare-knuckle style
without helmets or gloves, for
what felt like several minutes.
And meanwhile, the 17,000
strong crowd bayed for their
blood. Was I the only person
who felt deeply uncomfortable
about this?

Now, I realize this attitude
may mark my out as a hockey
newbie, but let's get serious
here. If these players had
picked their fight just outside
the Plexiglas walls of the rink,
they may very well have left the
stadium in handcuffs. I'm also
no hero, but had the same
brawl broken out in iront of me,
I wouldn't have stood idly by
gawking. I know that because
I've risked getting punched to
intervene in and break up
fights before.
How can we justify sus
pending our ethical and legal
rules just because these play
ers are out on the ice?
I realize, too, that fighting
has a long and established tradi
tion in hockey in North Ameri
ca. But "tradition" is no excuse.
Racism and sexism used to
have a "tradition" in most
major sports, but, while prob
lems with both do remain, the
majority of fans, players and
the relevant authorities recog
nize that this is simply not
acceptable anymore take,
for example, the racist abuse
thrown at AC Milan's Kevin-
Prince Boateng earlier this
month; Boateng's teammates
showed solidarity with him in
walking off and abandoning the
contest —. Why is calling
someone a name, however
deeply offensive, considered a
serious breach of sporting con
duct, yet smashing their face in
is harmless entertainment?
Even when the sports gov
erning bodies get it wrong,
most of us have a sufficient
moral code to realize what is
and isn't acceptable. FIFA
President Sepp Blatter has
gone on the record to threaten
clubs with forfeiting matches if
they abandon games due to
racist abuse, and he famously
declared in 2004 that the way to
improve women's soccer was to
"wear tighter shorts and low
cut shirts." It's no wonder that
most informed soccer fans have
little respect for Blatter.

Call me crazy but I honest
ly believe that sports is better
because of its efforts to remove
problems like racism and sex
ism. It's hard to understand
why violence and hockey
should be an exception.
There may of course be
some "fans" who only attend
games for the fights, much as
there were hooligans in the UK
in the 'Bos who used soccer
matches as an excuse to riot,
and there are people whose
major interest in auto racing
revolves around the crashes.
However, pandering to a dark
er side of human nature is nev
er productive. British soccer
stadiums are now seen as gen
erally safe places for families to
enjoy a game and attendance
figures as a result are much
higher than they were 30 years
ago. And while deaths do still
occur in auto racing, they are
much less frequent. Equipment
and rules have reduced crashes
and increased safety and as a
result we no longer have to suf
fer loss after loss of the most
exciting driving talent.
Supporters of fighting in
hockey rely on nothing more
than excuses to defend the
indefensible. Aes, other spoils
are violent, but boxing has
clear, defined rules that govern
it and ensure the risk to com
petitors is kept to a minimum.
While football by its very
nature often leads to injury it
applies rules to prevent brawl
ing, and most sensible sports
will eject and ban players for
this. Apparently fighting
serves to "protect" players, to
ensure certain infractions like
high-sticking, elbowing and
cross-checking don't get out of
hand. I guess the threat of
extreme violence is far better at
keeping players in line than ref
erees actually enforcing the
rules.

Don't even try to justify
this. If hockey is a worthwhile
spectator sport, it simply does
n't need the fights. It will stand
up for itself and draw attention
from real fans. If not, then I, for
one, don't need it in my sport
ing life.
