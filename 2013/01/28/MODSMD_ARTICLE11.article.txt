# Gage leads rout
## STANFORD ROCKS UTAH ON THE ROAD 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford beat Utah on Sunday night, dis
mantling the worst team in the Pac-12 with the
efficiency and precision of a master surgeon
removing basic stitches on the way to a 31-point
victory, 87-56

Stanford had a 12-2 lead early in the game, a
20-point lead at halftime, and a 29-point lead
with seven minutes left in the game when all of
then- starters sat down to watch the bench play
ers close out the game.
"Tonight we wanted to throw the first punch,
and it worked out for us," said sophomore guard
Chasson Randle.

John Gage led the Cardinal (12-8,3-4 Pac-12)
with a career-high 19 points the second time in
eight days that he has set a career high in scoring
showing the potential to be a difference maker
for Stanford's sub-par offense.
Gage led the team in scoring despite playing
only 17 minutes off of the bench for Stanford,
which is eighth in the Pac-12 in points per game.
"He's a terrific shooter, and he's only gotten
better over the years. I'm really proud of how
hard he's worked to improve his game," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
Utah had four quick turnovers to start the
game, which led to eight Stanford points. The
Utes took better care of the ball for the remain
der of the half, but by the time they ended a five
minute scoring drought, Stanford had a com
manding lead.
The Cardinal's height advantage down low
was a major difference maker. It outrebounded
Utah 43-27 while disrupting almost every shot in

the paint, with junior forwards Dwight Powell
and Josh Huestis pulling down 18 boards com
bined.
Powell in particular was a force early on, scor
ing several easy buckets in the first couple of
minutes, including a tip-in off of his own miss.
Randle, too, was efficient in the first half with two
steals and seven points in the first six minutes
without missing a shot.
The lightning quick start surprised what few
fans were in attendance on Sunday night the
crowd's official attendance was listed at 7,769
but a snowstorm appeared to leave plenty of
empty seats. Stanford's previous game was an
embarrassing 21-point loss at Colorado in
which they were thoroughly outplayed. In that
bludgeoning, Stanford mustered only 54 points
on 31 percent shooting from the field.
In a complete role reversal, Stanford put up
a season high in points Sunday while shooting
50 percent from the field. Four players had
double-digit scoring nights, while all but one
player on the roster recorded a point.
Gage, a junior who generally receives limit
ed playing time, is making his case to be made
a more prominent part of the rotation. Last
Saturday against Cal he went a perfect 4-4 on

three pointers to set a career-high in scoring.
He matched that 14-point scoring total by the
end of the first half against Colorado and went
on to finish the game 4-4 from three-point
range yet again.
The only real sign of life from Utah (9-11,1-
7) came at the onset of the second half when
Jarred Dußois scored the first seven points for
the Utes. While the lead was still 16, those
were the first points of the game for either of
Utah's leading scorers.
It was merely a flash in the pan though.
Dußois, Utah's second leading scorer, finished
the night with eight points. Jordan Loveridge,
their top scorer, didn't record a single point.
Stanford on the other hand, had scoring up
and down the roster. After Dawkins emptied
the bench in the final minutes, 12 of the 13
players who saw the court had at least one
point. Huestis finished with 13, Powell had 11,
Randle dropped 17 and senior Andy Brown
scored seven.
In addition, sophomore Wade Morgan scored
his first career point, an otherwise innocuous
free throw with 44 seconds to play.

LEIGH KINNEY/The Stanford Daily
Bouncing back after a bad loss at Colorado on Thursday, junior Dwight Powell (33) and the
Cardinal raced past a shocked Utah team on Sunday night. Powell missed a double-double
by just one rebound, scoring 11 points as part of an efficient Stanford attack.
