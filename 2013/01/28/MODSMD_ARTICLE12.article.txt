# BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH UTES IN TOWN
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
With a definitive 65-44 rout over Utah on
Friday night, and an exciting 69-56 win against
No. 20 Colorado on Sunday night, No. 6 Stan
ford women's basketball (19-2, 8-1) ends its
five-game homestand on a high note.

After losing their leading score, redshirt
junior Taryn Wicijowski, early in the first half
to injury, the Utes were never able to rally and
come back from an early 11-point deficit.
The powerful play of senior forward Joslyn
Tinkle and junior forward Chiney Ogwumike
proved too much for the outplayed Utes to
handle. Ogwumike finished the game with 23
points and 13 rebounds, while Tinkle con
tributed 16 points and grabbed eight boards.
Utah's junior forward Michelle Plouffe led
all scorers with 24 points; however, without
much help from the rest of her team, she was

not able to rally the Utes to make it a close
game.
"Jos [Tinkle] and Chiney [Ogwumike],
they're on a mission," Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They don't care who
else plays well, they're going to play well.
They're aggressive, they're making great
things happen for our team, they're being
great leaders; rebounding for us ... I think it
was a Chiney-and-Jos show. They really got it
done."
Sunday night's story was much the same
as Ogwumike and Tinkle led the Card to a
huge win over ranked Colorado (15-5, 4-5).
However, junior guard Toni Kokenis finally
had the standout game that everyone was
waiting for, which had the greatest impact on
the energy of the game.
Ogwumike led all scorers with 20 points
and 12 rebounds her 15th double double of
the season. Tinkle racked up 16 points with
five rebounds, and Kokenis finished with 15
points. The trio impressively shot a combined
20-33 from the field.

started the game at the point. Sopho
more point guard Amber Orrange was
benched for the fist couple minutes of
play as a lesson to be a better leader on
the court.
The message must have hit home
because when Orrange stepped onto the
court, she became a huge factor in con
trolling Stanford's pace of the game.
Orrange had 10 points, the fourth Stan
ford player to score in double digits, and
three assists. She also had four steals,
forcing Colorado turnovers and not
allowing their guards to penetrate inside
the paint.
"Toni started out at point guard and
Amber just needs to be a more vocal
leader," VanDerveer said. "I think she
finished very well and our team really
needs that from her."
For the first eight minutes of the
game, both teams shot and rebounded
the ball about the same so that the Card
were only able to secure an 18-16 advan
tage. Both teams experienced drastic
momentum shifts as one would come out
strong and go on a run and then fall flat
as the other team picked up its intensity.
At the half, Stanford only led 35-26
despite forcing 10 Colorado turnovers.
The Card defense also held leading scor
ers, senior guard Chucky Jeffry and red
shirt freshman forward Arielle Rober
son, to a combined five points. Tinkle
came alive in the last minute of play as
she scored four points, got a block and a
steal to send the Card into halftime with
great momentum.
"We tried to identify what was work
ing best for us [during halftime]. Trying
to get good shots and we did get up by 21
with 14 minutes to go. I think we were
doing some nice things. We were getting
out in transition a little more. I thought
we were attacking the basket," Van-
Derveer said. "I liked how Amber was
getting in the paint, making a little more
happen. I liked out-guard play tonight.
We need more scoring from Amber and
Toni to take the load off of Chiney and
Jos a little more and I like that."
The start of the second half was all
Stanford, as the Card quickly went on a
10-0 run to take the lead 51-30 with 14
minutes to play.
However, Jeffry finally got hot for
Colorado and ignited a fire for the Buffs
that led to an 11-0 run of their own. Jef
fry finished the game with 13 points and
seven rebounds. However, her intensity
was not enough to compensate for
Roberson's mere two points of the game.
With eight minutes to play, Ogwu
mike rolled her ankle after being fouled
hard on a layup. With Ogwumike out,
Jeffry hit a three that put the Buffs with
in seven. However, two shot clock
buzzer-beaters by Kokenis and then Tin

kle helped the Card pull ahead.
Ogwumike shortly thereafter reen
tered the game and immediately hit a
fade-away jumper to put the Card up by
12. With 1:44 left to play, the Buffs
picked up full-court defense and started
fouling to send the Card to the line. Stan
ford hit all of its free throws and Col
orado was unable to take care of the ball
on its last possession.
"[ Joslyn and I] knew with Chiney out
that we really needed to rebound and
make sure that we didn't want them to
score inside," said Kokenis. "So we both
knew that we had to step up for our
entire team and make sure we were exe
cuting on offense and getting really good
shots, and making sure we were all on

the same pace."
With four players scoring in double
digits, the Card finally saw major contri
butions from other players to compli
ment All American Ogwumike. The
Card will look to continue its even offen
sive output at Oregon and Oregon State
this weekend.
"We're definitely still trying to figure
out lineups, figure out what things we
should be running. This weekend was a
really big weekend for us, we focused
against very aggressive defense," said Van-
Derveer. "We're getting good shots and I
really have confidence in our shooters."

that led to an 11-0 run of their own. Jef
fry finished the game with 13 points and
seven rebounds. However, her intensity
was not enough to compensate for
Roberson's mere two points of the game.
With eight minutes to play, Ogwu
mike rolled her ankle after being fouled
hard on a layup. With Ogwumike out,
Jeffry hit a three that put the Buffs with
in seven. However, two shot clock
buzzer-beaters by Kokenis and then Tin

kle helped the Card pull ahead.
Ogwumike shortly thereafter reen
tered the game and immediately hit a
fade-away jumper to put the Card up by
12. With 1:44 left to play, the Buffs
picked up full-court defense and started
fouling to send the Card to the line. Stan
ford hit all of its free throws and Col
orado was unable to take care of the ball
on its last possession.
"[ Joslyn and I] knew with Chiney out
that we really needed to rebound and
make sure that we didn't want them to
score inside," said Kokenis. "So we both
knew that we had to step up for our
entire team and make sure we were exe
cuting on offense and getting really good
shots, and making sure we were all on

the same pace."
With four players scoring in double
digits, the Card finally saw major contri
butions from other players to compli
ment All American Ogwumike. The
Card will look to continue its even offen
sive output at Oregon and Oregon State
this weekend.
"We're definitely still trying to figure
out lineups, figure out what things we
should be running. This weekend was a
really big weekend for us, we focused
against very aggressive defense," said Van-
Derveer. "We're getting good shots and I
really have confidence in our shooters."

Much of the focus goes to junior forward Chiney Ogwumike, but junior Toni
Kokenis (31) continues to score in bunches at the guard position for the Cardinal.
Kokenis had 15 points on 6-11 shooting in Sunday's win.
With a definitive 65-44 rout over Utah on
Friday night, and an exciting 69-56 win against
No. 20 Colorado on Sunday night, No. 6 Stan
ford women's basketball (19-2, 8-1) ends its
five-game homestand on a high note.

After losing their leading score, redshirt
junior Taryn Wicijowski, early in the first half
to injury, the Utes were never able to rally and
come back from an early 11-point deficit.
The powerful play of senior forward Joslyn
Tinkle and junior forward Chiney Ogwumike
proved too much for the outplayed Utes to
handle. Ogwumike finished the game with 23
points and 13 rebounds, while Tinkle con
tributed 16 points and grabbed eight boards.
Utah's junior forward Michelle Plouffe led
all scorers with 24 points; however, without
much help from the rest of her team, she was

not able to rally the Utes to make it a close
game.
"Jos [Tinkle] and Chiney [Ogwumike],
they're on a mission," Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They don't care who
else plays well, they're going to play well.
They're aggressive, they're making great
things happen for our team, they're being
great leaders; rebounding for us ... I think it
was a Chiney-and-Jos show. They really got it
done."
Sunday night's story was much the same
as Ogwumike and Tinkle led the Card to a
huge win over ranked Colorado (15-5, 4-5).
However, junior guard Toni Kokenis finally
had the standout game that everyone was
waiting for, which had the greatest impact on
the energy of the game.
Ogwumike led all scorers with 20 points
and 12 rebounds her 15th double double of
the season. Tinkle racked up 16 points with
five rebounds, and Kokenis finished with 15
points. The trio impressively shot a combined
20-33 from the field.

started the game at the point. Sopho
more point guard Amber Orrange was
benched for the fist couple minutes of
play as a lesson to be a better leader on
the court.
The message must have hit home
because when Orrange stepped onto the
court, she became a huge factor in con
trolling Stanford's pace of the game.
Orrange had 10 points, the fourth Stan
ford player to score in double digits, and
three assists. She also had four steals,
forcing Colorado turnovers and not
allowing their guards to penetrate inside
the paint.
"Toni started out at point guard and
Amber just needs to be a more vocal
leader," VanDerveer said. "I think she
finished very well and our team really
needs that from her."
For the first eight minutes of the
game, both teams shot and rebounded
the ball about the same so that the Card
were only able to secure an 18-16 advan
tage. Both teams experienced drastic
momentum shifts as one would come out
strong and go on a run and then fall flat
as the other team picked up its intensity.
At the half, Stanford only led 35-26
despite forcing 10 Colorado turnovers.
The Card defense also held leading scor
ers, senior guard Chucky Jeffry and red
shirt freshman forward Arielle Rober
son, to a combined five points. Tinkle
came alive in the last minute of play as
she scored four points, got a block and a
steal to send the Card into halftime with
great momentum.
"We tried to identify what was work
ing best for us [during halftime]. Trying
to get good shots and we did get up by 21
with 14 minutes to go. I think we were
doing some nice things. We were getting
out in transition a little more. I thought
we were attacking the basket," Van-
Derveer said. "I liked how Amber was
getting in the paint, making a little more
happen. I liked out-guard play tonight.
We need more scoring from Amber and
Toni to take the load off of Chiney and
Jos a little more and I like that."
The start of the second half was all
Stanford, as the Card quickly went on a
10-0 run to take the lead 51-30 with 14
minutes to play.
However, Jeffry finally got hot for
Colorado and ignited a fire for the Buffs
