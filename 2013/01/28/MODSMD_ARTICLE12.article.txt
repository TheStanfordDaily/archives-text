# BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH UTES IN TOWN
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM STAFF WRITER 
With a definitive 65-44 rout over Utah on
Friday night, and an exciting 69-56 win against
No. 20 Colorado on Sunday night, No. 6 Stan
ford women's basketball (19-2, 8-1) ends its
five-game homestand on a high note.

After losing their leading score, redshirt
junior Taryn Wicijowski, early in the first half
to injury, the Utes were never able to rally and
come back from an early 11-point deficit.
The powerful play of senior forward Joslyn
Tinkle and junior forward Chiney Ogwumike
proved too much for the outplayed Utes to
handle. Ogwumike finished the game with 23
points and 13 rebounds, while Tinkle con
tributed 16 points and grabbed eight boards.
Utah's junior forward Michelle Plouffe led
all scorers with 24 points; however, without
much help from the rest of her team, she was

not able to rally the Utes to make it a close
game.
"Jos [Tinkle] and Chiney [Ogwumike],
they're on a mission," Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "They don't care who
else plays well, they're going to play well.
They're aggressive, they're making great
things happen for our team, they're being
great leaders; rebounding for us ... I think it
was a Chiney-and-Jos show. They really got it
done."
Sunday night's story was much the same
as Ogwumike and Tinkle led the Card to a
huge win over ranked Colorado (15-5, 4-5).
However, junior guard Toni Kokenis finally
had the standout game that everyone was
waiting for, which had the greatest impact on
the energy of the game.
Ogwumike led all scorers with 20 points
and 12 rebounds her 15th double double of
the season. Tinkle racked up 16 points with
five rebounds, and Kokenis finished with 15
points. The trio impressively shot a combined
20-33 from the field.
Topically the starting two-guard, Kokenis
