## Maples gets rowdy as Card sweeps past Gauchos 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off a gigantic victory Tuesday night
against then-No. 4 UCLA, the No. 4 Stanford
men's volleyball team entered its Saturday
matchup with No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara
looking to keep its momentum going before a
big road trip to Hawaii next weekend. With a
dominant 25-19, 25-17, 25-22 sweep, the Car
dinal did just that, demonstrating that it is a
team to fear in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.

The Gauchos (3-5, 1-4 MPSF) looked as
though they would hang with the Cardinal at
the start, refusing to let Stanford (6-2, 3-2)
pull far ahead. The Cardinal held just a 15-13
lead, when sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly unleashed a powerful kill. Haly
then stepped back to the service line and led
the Cardinal to five consecutive points,
stretching the lead to 21-13. The sophomore
had the best game of his young Stanford

career on Saturday, with four blocks and
eight kills on .667 hitting.
Stanford began the second set on a 3-0
run and didn't look back, taking advantage of
a number of critical Santa Barbara errors
and continuing its recent standard of efficient
offensive play and tremendous defense. The
clearly overwhelmed Gaucho attack couldn't
do anything, as Stanford took the set 25-17.
Thus, the Cardinal entered the third set
with an opportunity for just its second sweep
of the season. The Gauchos refused to simply
hand Stanford the victory, however, keeping
the set close throughout.
After a Santa Barbara kill brought the
game to 22-21, with Stanford holding the
slight advantage, the Cardinal clearly
showed that it was not about to let the game
go to four sets. A vicious kill from junior out
side hitter Steven Irvin stretched the lead to
two, then an error by Gaucho outside hitter
Matt Marsh put the Cardinal on the verge of
victory.
After conceding a point to Santa Barbara,
junior outside hitter Brian Cook ripped a kill
through the Gaucho defense to complete the
sweep. Cook had his usual strong perform-
