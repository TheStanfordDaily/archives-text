## Maples gets rowdy as Card sweeps past Gauchos 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off a gigantic victory Tuesday night
against then-No. 4 UCLA, the No. 4 Stanford
men's volleyball team entered its Saturday
matchup with No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara
looking to keep its momentum going before a
big road trip to Hawaii next weekend. With a
dominant 25-19, 25-17, 25-22 sweep, the Car
dinal did just that, demonstrating that it is a
team to fear in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.

The Gauchos (3-5, 1-4 MPSF) looked as
though they would hang with the Cardinal at
the start, refusing to let Stanford (6-2, 3-2)
pull far ahead. The Cardinal held just a 15-13
lead, when sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly unleashed a powerful kill. Haly
then stepped back to the service line and led
the Cardinal to five consecutive points,
stretching the lead to 21-13. The sophomore
had the best game of his young Stanford

career on Saturday, with four blocks and
eight kills on .667 hitting.
Stanford began the second set on a 3-0
run and didn't look back, taking advantage of
a number of critical Santa Barbara errors
and continuing its recent standard of efficient
offensive play and tremendous defense. The
clearly overwhelmed Gaucho attack couldn't
do anything, as Stanford took the set 25-17.
Thus, the Cardinal entered the third set
with an opportunity for just its second sweep
of the season. The Gauchos refused to simply
hand Stanford the victory, however, keeping
the set close throughout.
After a Santa Barbara kill brought the
game to 22-21, with Stanford holding the
slight advantage, the Cardinal clearly
showed that it was not about to let the game
go to four sets. A vicious kill from junior out
side hitter Steven Irvin stretched the lead to
two, then an error by Gaucho outside hitter
Matt Marsh put the Cardinal on the verge of
victory.
After conceding a point to Santa Barbara,
junior outside hitter Brian Cook ripped a kill
through the Gaucho defense to complete the
sweep. Cook had his usual strong perform-

ance, with 11 kills on .308
hitting, as well as six digs
and four blocks.
Stanford was led by a
particularly strong defen
sive effort. The Cardinal has
always been known as a par
ticularly dangerous team at
home, and the Stanford
defense proved this, shut
ting down the Gaucho
attack. Santa Barbara hit
just .153 for the match and
consistently looked stymied.
Marsh, their top hitter, had
13 kills but needed 33 swings
to get them, hitting just .152.
The defensive perform
ance can be credited to the
two-libero system recently
implemented by head coach
John Kosty. As junior liberos
Grant Delgado and Scott
Sakaida both bring unique
skills to the court, Kosty has
been splitting time between
the two.

Delgado provides leader
ship and vocal direction, so
he has been primarily play
ing when Stanford is serv
ing, informing his team
mates on opposing rotations.
Sakaida, a strong defensive
player and passer, primarily
enters to receive, which he
did exceptionally, converting
each of his 25 receptions
without an error.
With the victory, Stanford
moved up to second in the
MPSF. This climb is espe
cially remarkable consider
ing it was ranked ninth
before its match on Tuesday.
This week, the Cardinal
looks to keep on rolling, with
back-to-back matches
against Hawaii. The War
riors are currently last in the
MPSF at 1-4, but are not to
be underestimated, as they
are coming off a huge upset
against No. 2 Pepperdine.
Hawaii has yet to lose on its
home court, and could prove
dangerous to the Cardinal.
