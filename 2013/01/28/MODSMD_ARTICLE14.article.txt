## NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND Overcoming the racist state 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
This quarter so far has been mak
ing me increasingly impatient
about social justice and agitating
for meaningful social change. Having
seen structural racism, unemployment,
underemployment and class inequality
in such extremes, I have been at a loss
for words as to how anyone can be of
the mind that there's a fighting chance
for a just future based on our society's
current trajectory. ("Society" here
refers to South Africa, but can also
refer to my feelings about injustice in
the United States.) It seems impossi
ble to simply transition out of the
apartheid regime and create a just
society.
As one of our class readings
describes, the apartheid educational
system which was structurally
designed to turn blacks into members
of the lowest caste—was not rebuilt
to suit the needs of addressing the
damage of segregation. Instead, the
transition sought one national curricu
lum that applied the same standards
to all racial groups, even though mem
bers of these groups were at vastly dif
ferent learning levels. Educational
justice would have featured a system
that re-educated the generations of
blacks failed by the Bantu Education
Act, a system that recognized that the
most disadvantaged of the present
generation of students require differ
ent pedagogical needs and approaches
than their most-privileged counter
parts.
While we sat in a high-achieving
STEM high school during our first
week listening to what the program
does for its learners, I was stuck pon
dering one big question. Why it is
that, when legal barriers to structural
inequality are removed (ending of
apartheid and Jim Crow), structurally
disadvantaged groups (blacks in South
Africa and the United States) are
forced to succeed in the same system
that previously sought to limit them?
In other words, why are these groups
expected to accustom themselves to
and succeed within structures (like pri
mary secondary and tertiary educa
tion) that were part of old systems of
oppression? Why, instead, don't we
redesign our primary, secondary and
tertiary schools to accommodate the
specific, historic and present needs of
these structurally oppressed groups?
Why don't we judge learners not by
the tests they were set up to fail, nor
the university attainment they were
intended never to achieve, but by
something else?
The social problems of South
Africa, while certainly specific to the
context of this country's history, do
not seem that far off from social prob
lems of the United States particu
larly those involving (black) minori
ties in the post-Jim Crow era. It has
surprised me so far to hear some of
my peers lament about how the edu
cational system fails learners in the
townships in ways that are incompa
rable to educational inequity in the
United States. In some states and
cities, and particularly within commu
nities of color, there is also overcrowd
ing, underfunding, lack of books or
physical education classes (I spent
about half of my seven years of NYC
public education without any PE
classes), issues of students joining
gangs, etc. While the magnitude of
inequality is different, the issues at
stake are the same, as are the under
lying causes of such problems. (The
same goes for issues of poverty,
unemployment, and underemploy
ment.)
This brings me to return to one of
my initial comments: that a "just"
society seems impossible to achieve
under present conditions. To elabo
rate on this, I begin in the American
context: from the country's founding
moment, the United States defined
blackness as something excluded
from the category of humanity (i.e.
"all men are created equal and
endowed with certain inalienable
rights" did not apply to blacks [or
women, or indigenous peoples]). By
defining blackness as something non
human, slave owners were able to jus
tify the coerced labor of one group to
extract profits that fueled the devel
opment of the American state and
empire of wealth (through cotton,
tobacco, and sugar, among others).
"Emancipation" did not place blacks
on an even playing field with respect
to their structural underdevelopment
in education, occupational skills, prop
erty and wealth nor did the Civil
Rights Movement. As long as Ameri
ca simply removes barriers without
recompense or altering its structure,
blacks will always maintain a disad
vantaged position in American socie
ty-
In a similar vein, apartheid (while
designed along lines of race) effective
ly served to police and exploit labor
and profits. Systems of dehumaniza
tion and segregation provided the
bulk of the working class for the sec
tors in which we continue to see labor
issues today (namely farming and

mining). Miseducating and underedu
cating blacks ensured they would
inherit the least desirable of jobs.
Relocating blacks and colored people
away from the city center and into
townships ensured that access to
power, development and resources
remained in white hands.
Apartheid is no longer legal, but
its geography, its structural under
education and its class exploitation
remain intact.
While I came into this program
with a strong critical consciousness,
my first three weeks traveling around
have sharpened it to the point where I
am incredibly impatient for social
action. For me, being a "global citizen"
means more than being educated or
sympathetic about social issues; it is
more than doing service. Global citi
zenship means taking up an active
struggle to work with oppressed and
marginalized groups around the world
to address the systematic inequality
and injustice we face.
Recognizing that—just as with
service—uncritical and unintentional
activism can do more harm than good
in an unfamiliar context, my challenge
for the next few weeks is to figure out
ways that I can meaningfully and help-
My contribute to movements of peo
ple actively fighting against the walls
closing in around them every day

my initial comments: that a "just"
society seems impossible to achieve

context: from the country's founding
moment, the United States defined
blackness as something excluded
from the category of humanity (i.e.
"all men are created equal and
endowed with certain inalienable
rights" did not apply to blacks [or
women, or indigenous peoples]). By
defining blackness as something non
human, slave owners were able to jus
tify the coerced labor of one group to
extract profits that fueled the devel

empire of wealth (through cotton,
tobacco, and sugar, among others).
"Emancipation" did not place blacks
on an even playing field with respect
to their structural underdevelopment
in education, occupational skills, prop
erty and wealth nor did the Civil
Rights Movement. As long as Ameri
ca simply removes barriers without
recompense or altering its structure,
blacks will always maintain a disad
vantaged position in American socie
ty-
In a similar vein, apartheid (while
designed along lines of race) effective
ly served to police and exploit labor
and profits. Systems of dehumaniza
tion and segregation provided the
bulk of the working class for the sec
tors in which we continue to see labor
issues today (namely farming and

mining). Miseducating and underedu
cating blacks ensured they would
inherit the least desirable of jobs.
Relocating blacks and colored people
away from the city center and into
townships ensured that access to
power, development and resources
remained in white hands.
Apartheid is no longer legal, but
its geography, its structural under
education and its class exploitation
remain intact.
While I came into this program
with a strong critical consciousness,
my first three weeks traveling around

means more than being educated or
sympathetic about social issues; it is
more than doing service. Global citi
zenship means taking up an active
struggle to work with oppressed and
marginalized groups around the world
to address the systematic inequality
and injustice we face.

Apartheid is no
longer legal, but
its class
exploitation
remains intact.
This quarter so far has been mak
ing me increasingly impatient
about social justice and agitating
for meaningful social change. Having
seen structural racism, unemployment,
underemployment and class inequality
in such extremes, I have been at a loss
for words as to how anyone can be of
the mind that there's a fighting chance
for a just future based on our society's
current trajectory. ("Society" here
refers to South Africa, but can also
refer to my feelings about injustice in
the United States.) It seems impossi
ble to simply transition out of the
apartheid regime and create a just
society.
As one of our class readings
describes, the apartheid educational
system which was structurally
designed to turn blacks into members
of the lowest caste—was not rebuilt
to suit the needs of addressing the
damage of segregation. Instead, the
transition sought one national curricu
lum that applied the same standards
to all racial groups, even though mem
bers of these groups were at vastly dif
ferent learning levels. Educational
justice would have featured a system
that re-educated the generations of
blacks failed by the Bantu Education
Act, a system that recognized that the
most disadvantaged of the present
generation of students require differ
ent pedagogical needs and approaches
than their most-privileged counter
parts.
While we sat in a high-achieving
STEM high school during our first
week listening to what the program
does for its learners, I was stuck pon
dering one big question. Why it is
that, when legal barriers to structural
inequality are removed (ending of
apartheid and Jim Crow), structurally
disadvantaged groups (blacks in South
Africa and the United States) are
forced to succeed in the same system
that previously sought to limit them?
In other words, why are these groups
expected to accustom themselves to
and succeed within structures (like pri
mary secondary and tertiary educa
tion) that were part of old systems of
oppression? Why, instead, don't we
redesign our primary, secondary and
tertiary schools to accommodate the
specific, historic and present needs of
these structurally oppressed groups?
Why don't we judge learners not by
the tests they were set up to fail, nor
the university attainment they were
intended never to achieve, but by
something else?
The social problems of South
Africa, while certainly specific to the
context of this country's history, do
not seem that far off from social prob
lems of the United States particu
larly those involving (black) minori
ties in the post-Jim Crow era. It has
surprised me so far to hear some of
my peers lament about how the edu
cational system fails learners in the
townships in ways that are incompa
rable to educational inequity in the
United States. In some states and
cities, and particularly within commu
nities of color, there is also overcrowd
ing, underfunding, lack of books or
physical education classes (I spent
