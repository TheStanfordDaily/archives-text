# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Relationship advice from an introvert 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
If there is a skill worth learning at
Stanford, it is a form of emotion
al gymnastics to give off the
impression that if you don't get
something you want, you didn't want
it in the first place. Rejection is tough
enough as is, and it stings more
sharply when it's public. So students
build intricate chain-mail around then
lowest moments, durable enough to
endure a probing question but light
enough to preserve the pretense of a
happy-go-lucky personality. I see
chain-mail crafted around low
grades, high hopes and, most fre
quently, around those awkward
moments when someone had the
nerve to pursue a romantic interest,
unsure if the feelings were recipro
cated.

It's like it's inadmissible to be
turned down. I hear a lot of self
deceiving rationalizations claiming, "I
wasn't even interested in so-and-so
romantically" if there is the least indi
cation that so-and-so wasn't interest
ed first. But I don't hear many con
versations to the extent of, "Man, I

really like him but he doesn't like me.
Bummer." Or even, "There's this girl
I like, but I don't know if she's down.
Scary shit." It's a shame, because a
preemptive denial foregoes a rela
tionship or friendship that could pan
out if you let the chain-mail down.
There is no shame in feeling attracted
to someone only to discover that the
feeling isn't reciprocated. It's the
nature of the beast. Otherwise we
would have no angst to write love
songs about.
I'm not talking only about roman
tic pursuits, either. Often I am too shy
to make a new friend because I proj
ect that they might reject me, and I
don't think I'm alone on this one. It
comes from a fiction I tell myself that
I can be perfect, and rejection doesn't
fit into that fiction. It just isn't some
thing that happens to perfect people.
So I build up a fortress of smiles and
denials around the silliest things.
Ironically this makes me come
across as defensive, untrusting, and
frequently a bitch, when really it's
just shyness. When you have your

chain-mail on, an attempt by an out
sider to connect can feel like an attack
on the fortress, a search for a crack in
the foundation. When you project
rejection onto a situation, you might
withdraw from it, be it a conversation,
an invitation or an innocuous "hello."
Whoever is on the other side of that
"hello" could take your withdrawal as
a personal rejection. And thus, we
have the stalemate in new relation
ships between perfect people, who
abound at Stanford.
The solution seems simple: stop
projecting rejection. Simple, sure;
easy, no way. Walking into a new
social scenario without any defensive
armor on might be the scariest thing
I have done, and I have been
hypothermic in a lightning storm.
It's scary, yes. But you can let go of
the pressure to never be rejected.
Embrace that possibility, and you
might be able to stop projecting it as
the inevitable.

Renee won't reject you if you email
