# FIVE FOR FIVE
## 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo began its hunt for a third consecu
tive national championship with five
wins in five games this weekend.

The Cardinal (5-0) kicked off the sea
son with a 11-2 defeat of Michigan on Fri
day afternoon, followed by victories over
No. 18 Cal Baptist, No. 6 UC-Irvine,
CSU Bakersfield and No. 8 Loyola
Marymount in the UCSB Winter Invite.
Thirteen different players scored for
the Cardinal over the weekend, led by
senior captain Melissa Seidemann who
registered 14 goals in five games. Fresh
man Anna Yelizarova also scored 12 goals
over the weekend to open her collegiate
career.

On Friday, Seidemann, who sat out
last season to compete in the 2012 Lon
don Olympics, scored five goals for the
Cardinal.

Sophomore Kiley Neushul opened the
scoring just 14 seconds into the Stan
ford's season as the Cardinal rushed out
to 4-0 lead early in the first period. How
ever, the Cardinal was then held without
a goal for nearly 12 minutes while Michi
gan closed the lead to two.
"We ran into a real bump there with
our offense because we rushed a lot of
shots," Tanner said. "I think maybe we
were a little too excited and we had trou
ble getting into a rhythm at all on
offense."
After halftime, the attack picked up
again as Seidemann added her third and
fourth goals in the first two minutes of

the half to stretch the lead to 6-2.
At the other end, junior driver Kelsey
Suggs and the Stanford defense consis
tently smothered the Michigan attack.
Suggs also added a goal in the third peri
od.
"They were really together on
defense," Tanner said. "We were grab
bing a little bit early but as we played
good position as the game went on."
On the rare occasion that the defense
broke down, goalkeeper Kate Baldoni
was strong in net. The senior had six
saves, including two from point-blank
range.
Late in the game, freshmen Anna
Yelizarova and Guhpreet Sohi also regis
tered the first goals of their collegiate
careers, highlighted by Yelizarova's sec
ond goal, a half-court, buzzer-beating
shot to close out the game.
Stanford followed a similar script in
each game of the UCSB tournament.
On Saturday, Stanford dominated Cal
Baptist, 19-1, behind six goals from
Yelizarova. Fellow freshman Maggie
Steffens also added three goals as Stan
ford jumped out to a 13-0 lead by half
time.
Sophomore Emily Dorst made two
saves in goal.
The Cardinal then matched up
against UC Irvine in the afternoon game.
Stanford took a 3-1 lead in the first eight
minutes, but the offenses for both teams
slowed down through halftime. Baldoni
(nine saves) anchored a strong defensive
effort for the Cardinal.
In the final eight minutes of the game,
Stanford outscored Irvine 4-1 to earn the
victory. Stanford's goal scorers were Sei
demann (three goals), Neushul (two
goals), Steffens (two goals), Kaitlyn Lo
(one goal) and Catherine Carpenter (one
goal).
Stanford continued their dominance

on Sunday. Ten players scored for the
Cardinal in a dominating 20-3 win over
CSU Bakersfield, which will be joining
Stanford in the MPSF for the first time
this year.
Junior driver Lexie Ross led the Car
dinal with four goals while freshman
Gabby Stone made eight saves for the
Cardinal in her collegiate debut.
The Cardinal closed out the weekend
by beating LMU 14-8 behind hat tricks
from junior Kaley Dodson and Seide
mann.
Stanford again jumped out to an ear
ly advantage, scoring five goals in the
first period. The Lions closed the lead to
6-4 by halftime, but the Cardinal defense
locked down to hold LMU scoreless in a
third period in which the offense put
away six goals. Baldoni and Dorst com
bined for eight saves in net to keep Stan
ford's record perfect through five games.
With five games in three days, Tanner
rotated his lineup frequently throughout
the weekend, giving his freshmen plenty
of opportunities to play.
"We're counting on a lot of people to
play at a high level so we want to see how
they do in this environment," Tanner
said. "It was exciting to see everyone get
a chance to prove themselves under pres
sure."
One concern for Stanford is the
health of junior Annika Dries, who did
not play at all this weekend. According to
Tanner, the 2012 Olympian's status is
currently day-to-day.
Next up for the Cardinal is a tourna
ment at home next weekend. Stanford
will play a team from the Olympic Club
and San Jose State on Saturday before
matching up with UC-Davis at 8 a.m.
Sunday morning.

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
STANFORD 7
UC-IRVINE 2
01/27, Santa Barbara


SAM GIRVIN/The Stanford Daily
Thanks to an offensive outburst of 14 goals from senior Melissa Seidermann (2), who helped Team USA win a gold medal
in London, Stanford easily won the UCSB Winter Invite with four straight wins to move the Card to 5-0 on the year.
The No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo began its hunt for a third consecu
tive national championship with five
wins in five games this weekend.

The Cardinal (5-0) kicked off the sea
son with a 11-2 defeat of Michigan on Fri
day afternoon, followed by victories over
No. 18 Cal Baptist, No. 6 UC-Irvine,
CSU Bakersfield and No. 8 Loyola
Marymount in the UCSB Winter Invite.
Thirteen different players scored for
the Cardinal over the weekend, led by
senior captain Melissa Seidemann who
registered 14 goals in five games. Fresh
man Anna Yelizarova also scored 12 goals
over the weekend to open her collegiate
career.

On Friday, Seidemann, who sat out
last season to compete in the 2012 Lon
don Olympics, scored five goals for the
Cardinal.

Sophomore Kiley Neushul opened the
scoring just 14 seconds into the Stan
ford's season as the Cardinal rushed out
to 4-0 lead early in the first period. How
ever, the Cardinal was then held without
a goal for nearly 12 minutes while Michi
gan closed the lead to two.
"We ran into a real bump there with
our offense because we rushed a lot of
shots," Tanner said. "I think maybe we
were a little too excited and we had trou
ble getting into a rhythm at all on
offense."
After halftime, the attack picked up
again as Seidemann added her third and
fourth goals in the first two minutes of

the half to stretch the lead to 6-2.
At the other end, junior driver Kelsey
Suggs and the Stanford defense consis
tently smothered the Michigan attack.
Suggs also added a goal in the third peri
od.
"They were really together on
defense," Tanner said. "We were grab
bing a little bit early but as we played
good position as the game went on."
On the rare occasion that the defense
broke down, goalkeeper Kate Baldoni
was strong in net. The senior had six
saves, including two from point-blank
range.
Late in the game, freshmen Anna
Yelizarova and Guhpreet Sohi also regis
tered the first goals of their collegiate
careers, highlighted by Yelizarova's sec
ond goal, a half-court, buzzer-beating
shot to close out the game.
Stanford followed a similar script in
each game of the UCSB tournament.
On Saturday, Stanford dominated Cal
Baptist, 19-1, behind six goals from
Yelizarova. Fellow freshman Maggie
Steffens also added three goals as Stan
ford jumped out to a 13-0 lead by half
time.
Sophomore Emily Dorst made two
saves in goal.
The Cardinal then matched up
against UC Irvine in the afternoon game.
Stanford took a 3-1 lead in the first eight
minutes, but the offenses for both teams
slowed down through halftime. Baldoni
(nine saves) anchored a strong defensive
effort for the Cardinal.
In the final eight minutes of the game,
Stanford outscored Irvine 4-1 to earn the
victory. Stanford's goal scorers were Sei
demann (three goals), Neushul (two
goals), Steffens (two goals), Kaitlyn Lo
(one goal) and Catherine Carpenter (one
goal).
Stanford continued their dominance

on Sunday. Ten players scored for the
Cardinal in a dominating 20-3 win over
CSU Bakersfield, which will be joining
Stanford in the MPSF for the first time
this year.
Junior driver Lexie Ross led the Car
dinal with four goals while freshman
Gabby Stone made eight saves for the
Cardinal in her collegiate debut.
The Cardinal closed out the weekend
by beating LMU 14-8 behind hat tricks
from junior Kaley Dodson and Seide
mann.
Stanford again jumped out to an ear
ly advantage, scoring five goals in the
first period. The Lions closed the lead to
6-4 by halftime, but the Cardinal defense
locked down to hold LMU scoreless in a
third period in which the offense put
away six goals. Baldoni and Dorst com
bined for eight saves in net to keep Stan
ford's record perfect through five games.
With five games in three days, Tanner
rotated his lineup frequently throughout
the weekend, giving his freshmen plenty
of opportunities to play.
"We're counting on a lot of people to
play at a high level so we want to see how
they do in this environment," Tanner
said. "It was exciting to see everyone get
a chance to prove themselves under pres
sure."
One concern for Stanford is the
health of junior Annika Dries, who did
not play at all this weekend. According to
Tanner, the 2012 Olympian's status is
currently day-to-day.
Next up for the Cardinal is a tourna
ment at home next weekend. Stanford
will play a team from the Olympic Club
and San Jose State on Saturday before
matching up with UC-Davis at 8 a.m.
Sunday morning.
