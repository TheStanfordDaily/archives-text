# MUSIQUE, JE T'AIME
## Music in Paris One Stanford student's musical epiphany in the City of Light 
### Katharine Schwab | STAFF WRITER 
Andrea Slobodien 'l3 has been writing
songs since she was 6 years old.
"I wrote this really silly little tune about dol
phins," she laughed. "They were my favorite ani
mal." Her piano teacher, who she studied with
from five to 18, framed the sheet music for her
song and put it up on his wall.
It was the start of a love affair with music that
has only intensified with age. Today, Slobodien's
cell phone has hundreds of recordings song
fragments that will come to her when she's walk
ing to class or hanging out with her residents
(she's a resident assistant in Durand this year).
She calls these fragments "ideas," and they are
combined in ways even she doesn't expect.

"Sometimes I think of a chorus and a
year later I think of the perfect verse,"
Slobodien said.
Her musical inspirations have evolved
with her own development from emotion
al preteen to poised Stanford student, even
though she still describes herself as a
"melodramatic, hopeless romantic."
Growing up, she emulated John Lennon's
chord progressions.
"I loved Britney Spears until one day
I realized that all her songs use the same
chord progressions and I could never listen
to her again," she admitted with a laugh.
Her musical hero, however, is singer
Andrew McMahon of Something
Corporate, who had lunch with her on her
thirteenth birthday and wished her luck on
her music career. As a teenager, Death Cab
for Cutie's lyrical complexities inspired
Slobodien to tell complicated emotional
stories with her lyrics rather than directing
her songs towards an abstract figure; her
songs became a means of "talking about
the things I've experienced in my life,
whether or not it was romantic."
When she discovered composer
Philip Glass, however, Slobodien began to
focus more on the piano parts of her
songs.
"There's this really beautiful relation
ship between the lyrics and the piano,"
Slobodien said. "I think that when I can no
longer express something, the piano covers
it for me. The way that I interact with the
keys can show you a lot more of my emo
tions than I can say in words."
These days, Slobodien's tastes reflect a
more international palate. Icelandic band
Sigur Ros, singer L.P. (who Slobodien calls
her "new vocal inspiration") and German

group Wir sind Helden are among her
current favorites.
Her decision to pursue music full
time was made during her childhood
even her seventh-grade journal details her
dreams of Julliard.
"It shows how much I naively wanted
to do music, in the most extreme sense of
the word," Slobodien said. She finally com
mitted to the decision while abroad in
Paris last spring, when she didn't have
access to an instrument and realized music
was a necessity, not just a hobby.
Her search for a piano in Paris led her
to the famous Shakespeare and Company
bookstore, featured in Hemingway's novel
"A Moveable Feast." It has a piano avail
able to the public.

"People actually started listening. These tourists would videotape me, as if this were a thing
that happens in the Shakespeare and Company bookstore," Slobodien said.
Her practice sessions at the bookstore became impromptu concerts. "One guy told me that
he had his writing epiphany about what he wants his book to be about after hearing one of my
songs," Slobodien remarked.
Through the friends she met at Shakespeare and Company, Slobodien discovered what she
described as an "open-mic-speakeasy-spoken-word-collective" that met Monday nights in the
basement of a bar. The room was filled with ex-pats who were somehow involved with the
English language.
When a friend pushed her to perform, Slobodien introduced herself in French. "It was that
rush I got," she reminisced, "that an entire room of people was listening, and they actually liked
it. After I was done performing, people came up and wanted to hear more. I realized that that's
what I want to do, or at least try."
After spending last summer performing in bars and participating in open-mics in D.C.,
where she was interning at Congress, Slobodien knew that music was an emotional imperative.
"So many artistic doors opened in me," she said. "I came back to Stanford thinking that no
matter what happens to me after I graduate, I have to give music a chance while I'm young and
I can still make a mistake and recover from it."
Slobodien will graduate in the spring as a Science, Technology and Society major with a
Modern Languages minor. She hopes to work at a music start-up, which will pay the bills as she
continues to work toward her dream job.
Friends often tell Slobodien she sounds like Regina Spektor, Ingrid Michaelson and Adele.
However, such comparisons make her uncomfortable.
"I don't think I should be likened to them. They are fantastic, and they've already made it.
I'm trying to carve out my own unique space."
Her Stanford debut was during open-mic at the CoHo last quarter. Since then, she has per
formed at Acoustic lukebox, and she performed ninety-minutes' worth of original songs at the
CoHo Sunday night.
To all the aspiring songwriters and musicians out there, Slobodien has some advice: "Let
your emotions lead you," she says. "Let yourself come out."
