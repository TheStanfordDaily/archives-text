# MUSIQUE, JE T'AIME
## Music in Paris One Stanford student's musical epiphany in the City of Light 
### Katharine Schwab | STAFF WRITER 
Andrea Slobodien 'l3 has been writing
songs since she was 6 years old.
"I wrote this really silly little tune about dol
phins," she laughed. "They were my favorite ani
mal." Her piano teacher, who she studied with
from five to 18, framed the sheet music for her
song and put it up on his wall.
It was the start of a love affair with music that
has only intensified with age. Today, Slobodien's
cell phone has hundreds of recordings song
fragments that will come to her when she's walk
ing to class or hanging out with her residents
(she's a resident assistant in Durand this year).
She calls these fragments "ideas," and they are
combined in ways even she doesn't expect.

"Sometimes I think of a chorus and a
year later I think of the perfect verse,"
Slobodien said.
Her musical inspirations have evolved
with her own development from emotion
al preteen to poised Stanford student, even
though she still describes herself as a
"melodramatic, hopeless romantic."
Growing up, she emulated John Lennon's
chord progressions.
"I loved Britney Spears until one day
I realized that all her songs use the same
chord progressions and I could never listen
to her again," she admitted with a laugh.
Her musical hero, however, is singer
Andrew McMahon of Something
Corporate, who had lunch with her on her
thirteenth birthday and wished her luck on
her music career. As a teenager, Death Cab
for Cutie's lyrical complexities inspired
Slobodien to tell complicated emotional
stories with her lyrics rather than directing
her songs towards an abstract figure; her
songs became a means of "talking about
the things I've experienced in my life,
whether or not it was romantic."
When she discovered composer
Philip Glass, however, Slobodien began to
focus more on the piano parts of her
songs.
"There's this really beautiful relation
ship between the lyrics and the piano,"
Slobodien said. "I think that when I can no
longer express something, the piano covers
it for me. The way that I interact with the
keys can show you a lot more of my emo
tions than I can say in words."
These days, Slobodien's tastes reflect a
more international palate. Icelandic band
Sigur Ros, singer L.P. (who Slobodien calls
her "new vocal inspiration") and German

group Wir sind Helden are among her
current favorites.
Her decision to pursue music full
time was made during her childhood
even her seventh-grade journal details her
dreams of Julliard.
"It shows how much I naively wanted
to do music, in the most extreme sense of
the word," Slobodien said. She finally com
mitted to the decision while abroad in
Paris last spring, when she didn't have
access to an instrument and realized music
was a necessity, not just a hobby.
Her search for a piano in Paris led her
to the famous Shakespeare and Company
bookstore, featured in Hemingway's novel
"A Moveable Feast." It has a piano avail
able to the public.
