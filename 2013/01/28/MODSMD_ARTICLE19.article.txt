## Q&A TAYLOR RICE // LOCAL NATIVES 
### Lauren Wilson | MANAGING EDITOR 
Local Natives is getting ready to hit the
road again to support their sophomore
effort, "Hummingbird," which drops tomor
row. After kicking off their tour with sold-out
shows in their L.A. home base, the band takes
their brand of psychedelic indie pop up to
Oakland this Wednesday. Singer Taylor Rice
called up Intermission to chat about working
with The National's Aaron Dessner on the new
record and those lush harmonies.
Intermission (INT): What was it like
working with Aaron Dessner [of The
National]?
Taylor Rice (TR): Aaron was awesome. The
whole thing kind of came together as this
serendipitous, lucky thing. We just met on tour
right about the time that we were talking to pro
ducers and it just worked out so well with them.
He's a guy in the band, and he's a songwriter,

and in that respect he understands
band dynamics so well because he has his own
crazy band dynamic.
INT: How is "Hummingbird" different
from "Gorilla Manor?" Do you feel like
your sound has changed?
TR: I think I did kind of expand in both direc
tions. ["Hummingbird"] expands outwardly.
There are songs that are the most orchestrated
and the most dense and layered of anything that
we've had before; then there's also a kind of
inward expansion, bare moments as well. It's
also a more deeply personal record.
INT: How is it more personal?
TR: The difference I think is where we are. It's
kind of what we've been over the past two years.
We've had a lot of really incredible amazing
times ... our musical dreams came true, far
beyond what even we knew we could expect to

think was possible, and playing all over the
world and playing with orchestras and just really
incredible ... It's the hardest two years we've
ever had also. There was a death in the immedi
ate family of the band and some relationships
that were falling apart.
It all just comes from that emotional space.
That's why it feels like a more personal record.
INT: How do you guys put together your
harmonies?
TR: Well, we've been singing together since we
were kids, so for 10 years now. We know each
other so well that we've learned how to sing
together since the time we were in preschool.
INT: You guys are still working with a
bunch of independent labels like
Frenchkiss and have avoided major labels.
How has that been working out for you?
TR: Yeah, I can't imagine singing to a major

label... We had just learned to do everything
ourselves and that really paid off for us, because
the longer that we were able to do that, the more
we really got to choose who we wanted to work
with. The people we have been working with
now have been incredible and really supportive.
INT: Do you see yourselves continuing
without a major label?
TR: Yeah, definitely I mean, the music indus
try is changing so fast. I don't think the label sys
tem will be defunct in two years or anything, but
at the same time, I think it's very open. There's
been a paradigm shift like every two years at this
point, and we're actually at a point right now
where this is our last record on the two labels
that we're with, so we'll have a lot of options.
