## Freshman transports decrease Zero transports reported pom Wilbur Hall this fall 
### LUCY SVOBODA 
In an apparent vindication of the
University's efforts to improve alco
hol-education outreach to freshmen,
no students were transferred from
Wilbur Hall due to alcohol consump

is 14.

houses to be consistent. We took
things that folks had done over the
years in different houses and just
agreed to do them consistently."
For student staff, new guidelines
include promoting a dialogue with
students about alcohol and utilizing
funding for non-alcohol-centered
social activities on Friday and Sat
urday nights. Staff members have
also emphasized residents' commit

areas or to bring large amounts of
alcohol into residences; they are
also more adamant in encouraging
