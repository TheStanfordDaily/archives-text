# STUDENT LIFE
## Freshman transports decrease Zero transports reported pom Wilbur Hall this fall 
### LUCY SVOBODA 
In an apparent vindication of the
University's efforts to improve alco
hol-education outreach to freshmen,
no students were transferred from
Wilbur Hall due to alcohol consump
tion during fall quarter. Wilbur had
averaged five transports over the
previous three fall quarters.
Across all of campus, nine fresh
men were transported during the
2012 fall quarter, down from 17 in
2011. The average number of trans
ports for the past four fall quarters
is 14.
The most significant aspect of
the University's revised approach in
Wilbur has been the consolidation of
policies. While the resident fellows
of the eight different Wilbur houses
have previously had jurisdiction
over their individual policies, the
Wilbur community this year decided
on a set of consistent goals and stan
dards.
"What is happening in Wilbur
this year is not necessarily a change
but intentionality," said Deborah
Colder, dean of Residential Educa
tion. "The primary thing that has
occurred [recently] is that there is
communication among the different
houses to be consistent. We took
things that folks had done over the
years in different houses and just
agreed to do them consistently."
For student staff, new guidelines
include promoting a dialogue with
students about alcohol and utilizing
funding for non-alcohol-centered
social activities on Friday and Sat
urday nights. Staff members have
also emphasized residents' commit
ment to not have alcohol in public
areas or to bring large amounts of
alcohol into residences; they are
also more adamant in encouraging
students to take responsibility for secondary
impacts of alcohol consumption (like cleaning
up after illness due to excessive alcohol con
sumption).
While the Wilbur Hall program does not
present a sweeping policy change, Ralph Cas
tro, director of the Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education, asserted that the decision to be
consistent has power in itself.
"There is research that shows that when
we can have clear and consistent messages in
regards to alcohol, you can start to see
reductions in negative consequences," Cas
tro said. "The research highlights that stu
dents want to know what the expectations
are up front; once what they know what the
expectations are, they are more likely to
understand what is expected of them and will
behave."
Daniel Klein '9l, who is serving as a Rin
conada resident fellow for his second year,
feels that the policy has had just that effect
in his dorm.
"It feels like rules such as having no alco
hol in common spaces are an easier thing to
expect," Klein said. "My sense is that this
year one of the differences is that that expec
tation seems really clear and is easy to
address... whereas last year it was likely that
[was] something that was given some lip serv

ice to various degrees in some dorms."
However, Klein added that it is hard to
assess the lasting impact of the policy change
after only a few months.
"In some ways we are cautiously opti
mistic," Klein said. "This is a research univer
sity and we don't want to make assumptions
simply based on anecdotes. I do feel like this
year is safer, but not dramatically so."
Castro, Golder and Klein all separately
emphasized, however, that transport numbers
while significant are not the most
important piece of data in assessing the suc
cess of the University's new policy.
"If transports were the only number that
mattered, then people would err on the side of
not transporting when we want them to err on
the side of transporting," Klein said. "We
want people to make the call and not care
about it adding to some number that everyone
is counting so carefully."
Despite the apparent benefits of Wilbur's
new policy, Golder claimed that there is cur
rently no plan to expand the initiative to other
complexes like Stern, which had five trans
ports during fall quarter.
"One of the things that is great about our
residential system is that no two places are
the same," Golder said. "We need to find the
things that have worked in Wilbur and under
stand why they have or have not worked and
see what is translatable to other settings.
There are no cookie-cutter answers."
