tand Up Guys" is a story
of revenge, loyalty and honor,
but it's far from your typical
action/gangster flick. For one thing, "Stand Up
Guys" is a snapshot of life at a much later stage
than you'll see in any given Wahlberg, Pitt, Cruise
or even Clooney movie. The film stars seasoned
Oscar winners Christopher Walken and A1 Pacino,
as well as fellow Academy Award winner Alan Arldn
in a major supporting role. The result is an offbeat
yet-powerful depiction of friendship and aging.
"Stand Up Guys" begins with A1 Pacino's
long-awaited release from jail, where he dutifully
served 28 years in taking the fall and refusing to
name names in a heist gone awry. Doc (Walken),
a longtime friend and co-worker of sorts to Val
(Pacino), collects Val after his release and takes
him gallivanting around town to enjoy the sim
ple pleasures of life that he's missed namely,
steak and hookers. As Val resumes his pre-prison
habits and lifestyle, he is reminded (both by Doc
and by various unsuccessful endeavors) that they
are much older men than they were when he left
free society.
Meanwhile, as Val discovers the power of
modern pharmaceuticals like Viagra (among
others), Doc grapples with an approaching dead
line for the job he's been assigned: to kill Val.
Though Val kept his mouth shut "like a stand up
guy" after his arrest, one of his bullets killed his
(and Doc's) boss's only son in the crossfire of the
unsuccessful robbery that led to Val's arrest. You
may recognize Claphands (Mark Margolis), the
übiquitous crime boss, from Breaking Bad,
where he plays Tio Salamanca. Without the
wheelchair and oxygen apparatus, Margolis is
just as creepy but also significantly scarier as the
all-powerful boss who will stop at nothing to
avenge his son's death.
While the premise may sound a bit "Mr.

and Mrs. Smith"-esque, this film could hardly be
further from the fast-paced shootout-style story
line that seems like it would ensue. Instead, the
main plot doesn't really develop or progress at all
for the vast majority of the movie. Val is still
sharp as a tack, and is all too familiar with
Claphands and his M.0., and he is wise to Doc's
assignment from very early on. Perhaps it's their
longstanding friendship, or perhaps it's their
shared experience in "the business," but Val and
Doc manage to maintain a candid dialogue and
open friendship despite the looming and immi
nent prospect of death.
Indeed, Val is not only aware of but also
understanding of Doc's obligation to complete the
assignment, which is likely a function of their mutu
al familiarity with guns, violence and "jobs." For
those of us without mob experience, however, this
element of the film is the hardest to grasp.
The unique relationship between Val and
Doc allows them to spend most of their time
(and most of the movie) engaging in entertain
ing diversions from the assignment and the main
plotline. This process is aided by their reunion
with Hirsch (Alan Arkin), an old friend who
served as the getaway driver for the crew in the
good old days. Together, they get into adventures
that only old criminals with nothing to lose
would get into, including stealing a sick car,
breaking Hirsch out of an old folks home and
doing lines of ulcer meds.
Though some aspects of this film are diffi
cult to relate to, "Stand Up Guys" is ultimately
about honor, loyalty and friends as "witnesses to
your life," which should be relevant to just about
everyone. Plus, it's hard not to appreciate a movie
in which virtually every major character delivers
a standout performance. Be sure to watch care
fully for the relatively unknown actors in this
movie, like Vanessa Ferlito, who hold their own
when sharing the screen with the greats.
