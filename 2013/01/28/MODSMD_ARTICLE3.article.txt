nessy all have something in common
a barber. Carmelo Cogliandro,
owner of Stanford Hair, has been a barber
and salon owner at Stanford for 51 years.
In those years, he has cut the hair of
countless academics, provosts, presidents
and national figures.
The son of a barber and a hairdresser,
Carmelo moved to Palo Alto in his late
teens when his father opened a barber
shop in the Town and Country shopping
center.
"My old man worked as a barber at
Harvard until he decided to move to Palo
Alto, where he sought the kind of high
performing college town feel of Cam
bridge," Cogliandro said.
Then a 17-year-old keyboardist,
Cogliandro wanted to pursue his musical
career with his friends in Tri-Tone his
five-man jazz band but his parents
encouraged him to pursue a more stable
job. So Cogliandro took an apprenticeship
with Stanford Ham
Despite his burgeoning career as a
barber, Cogliandro continued to pursue
his love of music, and throughout his
twenties and thirties he traveled around

the country to perform with Tri-Tone.
"We [played] at one-horse towns,
where you were the only attraction for the
weekend so everyone would come down
from three towns over," he remembered.
In addition to harboring a wealth of
stories about his time touring, Cogliando
holds fond memories of his time at Stan
ford, as a barber at and later as owner of
Stanford Hair.
His favorite part of the job is connect
ing with his clients, with experiences that
suggest his relationships with clients can
often become genuine friendships.
"I share many special times with my
clients," he says, citing some moments
during which he served as a confidant or
received advice. "You touch people, people
touch you."
Anticipating a question about the
changes he's seen at Stanford in 51 years,
he answered by putting his hands out in
front of him and saying one word: "diver
sity."
Cogliando pointed to the transition
from a school primarily made up of "Cau
casian males" to one that is now wonder
fully eclectic, strengthening the sense that
everyone is yearning to fulfill his or her
"ultimate potential," even as other aspects
of the student experience such as
