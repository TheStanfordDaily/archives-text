# RCC role, pay part of larger review
## 26-year-old position has seen significant transformations 
### ANDREW MARGRAVE 
The rapidly evolving nature of technology—and stu
dents' increasing comfort with it has prompted a steady
evolution in the role of the residential computer coordina
tor (RCC) within the University's residential communities,
as the position's responsibilities and its compensation con
tinue to diverge.
The RCC position was first created in the 1987-88 aca
demic year to maintain residential computer clusters and
provide students with rudimentary technical education. An
initial group of 18 RCCs has since grown to over 100 today,
even as the improvement and automation of online connec
tion capabilities have prompted many RCCs —who enjoy
significantly larger salaries than non-resident assistant
(RA) staffing peers to assume different roles within the
dorm community.
For students applying for residential staff positions, the
recognition that the perks of the RCC position may exceed
those of other dorm staff is clear. With quarterly salaries as
high as $2,418 in some freshman dorms, along with com
pensation for teaching introductory computer science
classes CSIC and CS2C, an RCC can earn over $7OOO in an
academic year, a total much higher than a resident tutor,
who earns $4500 per academic year, or a peer health edu
cator (PHE), who earns $lOOO per academic year.
A wireless 'game-changer'
Sherwin Smith, Residential Computing consulting
services manager, emphasized the impact of technical inno
vation on RCCs' workload.
' A big turning point was the ability to register your devices
over the wireless network... that was a game-changer," Sher
win said. "Prior to that, you had to be plugged into the wall,
and nobody brings Ethernet cables and there's only two plugs
per room. The RCCs would pull out a 16-port switch into the
lounge on frosh arrival day"
The 2003 introduction of automated in-room network
connections, enabling direct registration and automatic
processing of connection requests, was a similar game
changer, reducing the average processing time for a con
nection from over 9 hours to 15 seconds.
Such significant shifts in workload diminished the
RCCs role and prompted its ultimate evolution with a new
set of priorities, according to Smith.
