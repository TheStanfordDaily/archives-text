# RCC role, pay part of larger review
## 26-year-old position has seen significant transformations 
### ANDREW MARGRAVE 
The rapidly evolving nature of technology—and stu
dents' increasing comfort with it has prompted a steady
evolution in the role of the residential computer coordina
tor (RCC) within the University's residential communities,
as the position's responsibilities and its compensation con
tinue to diverge.
The RCC position was first created in the 1987-88 aca
demic year to maintain residential computer clusters and
provide students with rudimentary technical education. An
initial group of 18 RCCs has since grown to over 100 today,
even as the improvement and automation of online connec
tion capabilities have prompted many RCCs —who enjoy
significantly larger salaries than non-resident assistant
(RA) staffing peers to assume different roles within the
dorm community.
For students applying for residential staff positions, the
recognition that the perks of the RCC position may exceed
those of other dorm staff is clear. With quarterly salaries as
high as $2,418 in some freshman dorms, along with com
pensation for teaching introductory computer science
classes CSIC and CS2C, an RCC can earn over $7OOO in an
academic year, a total much higher than a resident tutor,
who earns $4500 per academic year, or a peer health edu
cator (PHE), who earns $lOOO per academic year.
A wireless 'game-changer'
Sherwin Smith, Residential Computing consulting
services manager, emphasized the impact of technical inno
vation on RCCs' workload.
' A big turning point was the ability to register your devices
over the wireless network... that was a game-changer," Sher
win said. "Prior to that, you had to be plugged into the wall,
and nobody brings Ethernet cables and there's only two plugs
per room. The RCCs would pull out a 16-port switch into the
lounge on frosh arrival day"
The 2003 introduction of automated in-room network
connections, enabling direct registration and automatic
processing of connection requests, was a similar game
changer, reducing the average processing time for a con
nection from over 9 hours to 15 seconds.
Such significant shifts in workload diminished the
RCCs role and prompted its ultimate evolution with a new
set of priorities, according to Smith.
"One of the big shifts was building
the RCC position into a full staff posi
tion ... RCCs are first and foremost
part of house staff," he said.
Geoff Baker and Patti Hanlon-
Baker, who have been resident fellows
in Larkin for the past six years,
shared a similar outlook on their view
of the RCCs role within their dorm.
"We have always viewed the RCC
as an integrated part of the staff,
present at every staff meeting, with
equal decision making [abilities],"
Geoff Baker said.
As RCCs became more integrat
ed into dorm-staff responsibilities
and as connecting to the University
network became increasingly sim
ple, RCCs have instead applied their
technical skills toward promoting
digital literacy and technological abil
ities among their peers.
"[Student Computing] is rolling
out an educational component where
the RCC becomes more of a technol
ogy educator," Smith said. "We
encourage RCCs to be up on techno
logical innovations."

Training for the job
Apart from setting up printers,
teaching introductory CS classes and
guiding freshmen through the net
work registration process, RCCs have
found that the job that they are being
paid for does not necessarily corre
spond to the traditional RCC job
description.
"The most common thing that
RCCs will end up doing is basically
compensate when the automated
systems that are in place fail," said
Omar Diab 'l4, a Suites RCC. "And
that doesn't happen so frequently to
warrant the amount of training ...
the way the role is described does
not reflect that work that ends up
being done."
Other RCCs expressed similar
discontent with the training pro
gram.
"RCC training is one of the things
that is holding the program back,"
said Reid Watson 'l4, a Roble RCC
"It's still focused on the raw technical
side of things. It would do well to
change the role from raw technical
aid to educator."
"When the RCC [role] was first
invented, getting a computer con
nected to the network was a monu
mental effort," Watson said "You had
to know [operating system] UNIX,

you had to know [Secure Shell], just
to get someone on the internet...
That is definitely no longer critical."
While RCCs often supplement
technical work with more dorm pro
gramming and non-required respon
sibilities, they are careful not to
encroach on other staff members'
responsibilities.
"A lot of non-RAs purposely scale
back what we do [on non-required
dorm programming] so we don't
overwork ourselves," said Ruben
Pierre-Antoine 'l4, Larkin RCC.
"The RAs cannot do our job, so if we
go and plan a bunch of events and do
a bunch of RA things, it alleviates a
lot [of responsibility] from the RAs
but they in turn cannot tutor or fix
your computer."
As the RCC role's responsibilities
continue to fluctuate, the issue of deter
mining appropriate compensation is
complicated. The disparity in salaries
between staff roles appeal's to reflect
historical responsibilities rather than
current ones. According to Dean of Res
idential Education Deborah Goldei; an
18-month study on housing staff pay dis
crepancy will be concluded this school
year.

go and plan a bunch of events and do
a bunch of RA things, it alleviates a

continue to fluctuate, the issue of deter

complicated. The disparity in salaries

The rapidly evolving nature of technology—and stu
dents' increasing comfort with it has prompted a steady
evolution in the role of the residential computer coordina
tor (RCC) within the University's residential communities,
as the position's responsibilities and its compensation con
tinue to diverge.
The RCC position was first created in the 1987-88 aca
demic year to maintain residential computer clusters and
provide students with rudimentary technical education. An
initial group of 18 RCCs has since grown to over 100 today,
even as the improvement and automation of online connec
tion capabilities have prompted many RCCs —who enjoy
significantly larger salaries than non-resident assistant
(RA) staffing peers to assume different roles within the
dorm community.
For students applying for residential staff positions, the
recognition that the perks of the RCC position may exceed
those of other dorm staff is clear. With quarterly salaries as
high as $2,418 in some freshman dorms, along with com
pensation for teaching introductory computer science
classes CSIC and CS2C, an RCC can earn over $7OOO in an
academic year, a total much higher than a resident tutor,
who earns $4500 per academic year, or a peer health edu
cator (PHE), who earns $lOOO per academic year.
A wireless 'game-changer'
Sherwin Smith, Residential Computing consulting
services manager, emphasized the impact of technical inno
vation on RCCs' workload.
' A big turning point was the ability to register your devices
over the wireless network... that was a game-changer," Sher
win said. "Prior to that, you had to be plugged into the wall,
and nobody brings Ethernet cables and there's only two plugs
per room. The RCCs would pull out a 16-port switch into the
lounge on frosh arrival day"
The 2003 introduction of automated in-room network
connections, enabling direct registration and automatic
processing of connection requests, was a similar game
changer, reducing the average processing time for a con
nection from over 9 hours to 15 seconds.
Such significant shifts in workload diminished the
RCCs role and prompted its ultimate evolution with a new
set of priorities, according to Smith.
"One of the big shifts was building
the RCC position into a full staff posi
tion ... RCCs are first and foremost
part of house staff," he said.
Geoff Baker and Patti Hanlon-
Baker, who have been resident fellows
in Larkin for the past six years,
shared a similar outlook on their view
of the RCCs role within their dorm.
"We have always viewed the RCC
as an integrated part of the staff,
present at every staff meeting, with
equal decision making [abilities],"
Geoff Baker said.
As RCCs became more integrat
ed into dorm-staff responsibilities
and as connecting to the University
network became increasingly sim
ple, RCCs have instead applied their
technical skills toward promoting
digital literacy and technological abil
ities among their peers.
"[Student Computing] is rolling
out an educational component where
the RCC becomes more of a technol
ogy educator," Smith said. "We
encourage RCCs to be up on techno
logical innovations."

Training for the job
Apart from setting up printers,
teaching introductory CS classes and
guiding freshmen through the net
work registration process, RCCs have
found that the job that they are being
paid for does not necessarily corre
spond to the traditional RCC job
description.
"The most common thing that
RCCs will end up doing is basically
compensate when the automated
systems that are in place fail," said
Omar Diab 'l4, a Suites RCC. "And
that doesn't happen so frequently to
warrant the amount of training ...
the way the role is described does
not reflect that work that ends up
being done."
Other RCCs expressed similar
discontent with the training pro
gram.
"RCC training is one of the things
that is holding the program back,"
said Reid Watson 'l4, a Roble RCC
"It's still focused on the raw technical
side of things. It would do well to
change the role from raw technical
aid to educator."
"When the RCC [role] was first
invented, getting a computer con
nected to the network was a monu
mental effort," Watson said "You had
to know [operating system] UNIX,

you had to know [Secure Shell], just
to get someone on the internet...
That is definitely no longer critical."
While RCCs often supplement
technical work with more dorm pro
gramming and non-required respon
sibilities, they are careful not to
encroach on other staff members'
responsibilities.
"A lot of non-RAs purposely scale
back what we do [on non-required
dorm programming] so we don't
overwork ourselves," said Ruben
Pierre-Antoine 'l4, Larkin RCC.
"The RAs cannot do our job, so if we
go and plan a bunch of events and do
a bunch of RA things, it alleviates a
lot [of responsibility] from the RAs
but they in turn cannot tutor or fix
your computer."
