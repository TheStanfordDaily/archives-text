## Sadeq Saba on Iran Head of BBC Persian discusses reporting on Iran, role of social media 
### 
Sadeq Saba became the
head of BBC Persian in
2010, just one year after
the regime in Iran
accused the BBC of help
ing to foment unrest through

biased reporting in the aftermath
of Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's reelection. Saba
previously served as BBC Iranian
affairs analyst for more than a
decade and has reported on three
Iranian presidential elections.
He spoke to The Daily on Fri
day shortly before a campus
screening of the BBC Persian doc
umentary "The Ayatollah's Seal," a
move that argues Ayatollah
Khomeini, the supreme leader, is

the individual truly ruling Iran.
The screening intends to draw atten
tion to the importance of free speech
and the safety of journalists in Iran.
TSD: Please tell us about your
background and your career. After
obtaining your doctoral degree, did
you go straight into journalism?
SS: No, I started as a lawyer, actu
ally. I was a solicitor in my hometown
in northern Iran, but then I found law a
little bit, I would say, not attractive, so I
wanted something more challenging.
So I decided to become a journalist. I
think doing journalism, there is a lot of
excitement. You travel around the
world, and you report about important
events. So I'm enjoying being a journal
ist.
TSD: So you started off in the BBC?
SS: Yes, I joined the BBC in 1990
as a producer for radio, and then
later I became BBC's Iranian
affairs analyst, and four years ago,
when the BBC started a television
service in Persian, I became head
of the BBC Persian service.
TSD: The Iranian government not
only prohibits the BBC from hav
ing an office in Tehran, but the
regime has also tried to jam the
station's satellite signals. Is that
the government's stance toward all
foreign channels that try to broad
cast in the country? Could you tell
me about the difficulties BBC faces
broadcasting there, given these cir
cumstances?
SS: Well, the Iranian government
usually doesn't like people in Iran
to have access to alternative
sources of news, so they usually
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion in Iran, but they find BBC
broadcasts especially disturbing
for themselves. So they do whatev
er they can to stop the Iranian peo
ple from listening to BBC, or
watching BBC television, or even
having access to our Internet. But
we do our best to find ways of mak
ing it possible for people to have
access to BBC content. So there is
a war going on in away: Iranians
try to jam us; we find alternative
satellites, for instance.
TSD: Why do you think the gov
ernment is so hostile toward the
BBC?
SS: I think, basically, what the
Iranian government wants is to
have a monopoly on what Iranian
people should know about Iran and
the world. They don't like people to
have access to independent and
alternative sources of news. And
BBC is providing that alternative
source of news, and I think the
Iranian government doesn't like it.
The fact of the matter is, BBC has
been broadcasting to Iran for over
70 years. BBC radio was started 70

years ago, BBC online started
more then 10 years ago and our tel
evision started four years ago, so
despite pressures from the Iranian
government, we have always been
operating in Iran, from London.
TSD: In some ways, the "war"
between Iran and the BBC really
started in 2009, when the regime
accused the BBC of helping to
foment unrest following Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's reelection through
biased reporting. In your view,
what role did the BBC actually
play in the unrest that followed
that election?
SS: I think that people know that
after the disputed Iranian presi
dential election in 2009, BBC
played a major role in informing
the people in Iran and other
Persian speakers around the world
about what was happening in
the country. The main opposition
candidates in that election disput
ed the result of the election, and
they said that there was fraud,
massive fraud, but the Iranian gov
ernment obviously denied there
was fraud, and millions of Iranians
took to the streets of Tehran and
those in some other cities to
protest against the result of the
election. We were able to broadcast
the demonstrations the alterna
tive views, the views of opposition,
and the Iranian government was
not happy about what we were
doing. So I think that is basically
why they don't like us.
Just before the disputed presi
dential election, I'd been able to go
to Iran. I'd been travelling to Iran
for many, many years and report
ing the events, but I think the
demonstrations after that disputed
election, in away, sent a very
strong message to the Iranian gov
ernment, that there was massive
discontent in the country, and they
didn't want news organizations like
the BBC to broadcast what was
happening in the country.
TSD: How do not only you, but also
your journalists, maintain impar
tiality?
SS: The BBC operates according to
its editorial guideline, which has
been there for decades, and BBC
Persian is no different from BBC
English or BBC's other language
services; we all have one editorial
guideline, and according to that
editorial guideline, you have to
remain impartial, to remain accu
rate, to remain fair, objective, and
report what is happening in the
country.
We do our best, despite the fact

that we are not based in Iran, to
reflect the Iranian government's
views on our channel. We do our
best. We monitor all Iranian TV
channels, we monitor Iranian
newspapers, and whatever they
say, usually you can hear them or
watch them on our television, on
our radio, so we do our best.
As far as our viewers are con
cerned, we are probably the most
important impartial news channel
in Iran, and our audiences have
been growing, all the time, over the
last few years. Actually last year,
there was a news survey done in
Iran about BBC, how many people
were watching BBC Persian, and
that survey showed that within a
couple of years our viewers have
actually doubled in Iran.
TSD: With the Internet, do you
think it will be increasingly harder
for the government to reign in the
media?
SS: I think so. I mean, this day and age,
when you have social media, when you
have satellite television, where there
are all sorts of alternative means avail
able for people to circumvent those
restrictions, I don't think governments
can succeed.
Especially when you have social
media; in the past, regimes could
stop a newspaper from publishing
an article or close down a radio sta
tion, but when you have millions of
people using social media, it
becomes very, very difficult for any
regime to stop people from getting
access to alternative sources of
news. They are doing their best,
but I don't think they can succeed.
I think social media platforms are
the worst enemies for regimes that
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion.
TSD: Please tell me about the doc
umentary that's being shown today
["The Ayatollah's Seal"].
SS: The documentary is about how
Iran is ruled. A lot of people, in my
opinion, have the wrong impression
of the Iranian political system. A
lot of people think it is the parlia
mentary president, Ahmadinejad,
who is the leader of the country.
But that is not true.
The true leader of Iran is Aya
tollah Khomeini, the supreme
leader, and in this documentary, we
are trying to show how he and his
office are actually ruling in Iran.
But I'm also talking about safe
ty of journalists, which is a major
issue, not only for BBC Persian but
for journalists around the world.
Every year, hundreds of journal
ists, or at least dozens of journal

ists, are killed. In 2012, more than
100 journalists were killed around
the world. And we are also con
cerned about the issue of impunity
hardly anybody gets punished
for killing journalists so this is
what I'm going to talk about this
afternoon at Stanford University.
TSD: Do you have any personal
experiences, from Iran, being the
head of BBC Persian, with the gov
ernment harassing either you or
your family members?
SS: Yes. What the Iranian govern
ment has been doing over the last
couple of years is to put pressure
on the relatives of BBC Persian
[journalists]. Usually it is journal
ists, themselves, who are put under
pressure, but in the case of Iran,
because a lot of Iranian journalists
are now working outside the coun
try, they put pressure on their fam
ilies. So myself, and my colleagues
in BBC Persian, have been all put
in this very difficult situation,
where our families have been put
under pressure.
TSD: My last question is about the
film itself. Did you face any techni
cal difficulties when you were film
ing? Was the documentary filmed
in Iran?
SS: No, this movie was made out
side of Iran. We used a lot of
archived material from Iran, but
the film was actually made in Lon
don, in our studios, and we also
interviewed many people close to
Ayatollah Khomeini who now live
outside the country. We talked to
many experts who could explain
how the Ayatollah is ruling Iran.
This film has been received well
by our audiences in Iran and
around the world, and the Iranian
government tried to jam satellite
signals on the night we were show
ing this film in Iran, but people
could find other ways of watching
this film... because our television
service is also available on the
internet, and also, a lot of people in
the country made CDs of this film
and distributed around the country,
so millions of people have watched
this film.

The Iranian government does
n't like it, because they like to por
tray Ayatollah Khomeini, the
supreme leader of Iran, as a spiri
tual leader, somebody who is sacro
sanct, and nobody should question
his authority, and so they basically
didn't like what we made about
him.

tion to the importance of free speech
and the safety of journalists in Iran.
TSD: Please tell us about your
background and your career. After
obtaining your doctoral degree, did
you go straight into journalism?
SS: No, I started as a lawyer, actu
ally. I was a solicitor in my hometown
in northern Iran, but then I found law a
little bit, I would say, not attractive, so I
wanted something more challenging.
So I decided to become a journalist. I
think doing journalism, there is a lot of
excitement. You travel around the
world, and you report about important
events. So I'm enjoying being a journal
ist.
TSD: So you started off in the BBC?
SS: Yes, I joined the BBC in 1990
as a producer for radio, and then
later I became BBC's Iranian
affairs analyst, and four years ago,
when the BBC started a television
service in Persian, I became head
of the BBC Persian service.
TSD: The Iranian government not
only prohibits the BBC from hav
ing an office in Tehran, but the
regime has also tried to jam the
station's satellite signals. Is that
the government's stance toward all
foreign channels that try to broad
cast in the country? Could you tell
me about the difficulties BBC faces
broadcasting there, given these cir
cumstances?
SS: Well, the Iranian government
usually doesn't like people in Iran
to have access to alternative
sources of news, so they usually
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion in Iran, but they find BBC
broadcasts especially disturbing
for themselves. So they do whatev
er they can to stop the Iranian peo
ple from listening to BBC, or
watching BBC television, or even
having access to our Internet. But
we do our best to find ways of mak
ing it possible for people to have
access to BBC content. So there is
a war going on in away: Iranians
try to jam us; we find alternative
satellites, for instance.
TSD: Why do you think the gov
ernment is so hostile toward the
BBC?
SS: I think, basically, what the
Iranian government wants is to
have a monopoly on what Iranian
people should know about Iran and
the world. They don't like people to
have access to independent and
alternative sources of news. And
BBC is providing that alternative
source of news, and I think the
Iranian government doesn't like it.
The fact of the matter is, BBC has
been broadcasting to Iran for over
70 years. BBC radio was started 70

years ago, BBC online started
more then 10 years ago and our tel
evision started four years ago, so
despite pressures from the Iranian
government, we have always been
operating in Iran, from London.
TSD: In some ways, the "war"
between Iran and the BBC really
started in 2009, when the regime
accused the BBC of helping to
foment unrest following Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's reelection through
biased reporting. In your view,
what role did the BBC actually
play in the unrest that followed
that election?
SS: I think that people know that
after the disputed Iranian presi
dential election in 2009, BBC
played a major role in informing
the people in Iran and other
Persian speakers around the world
about what was happening in
the country. The main opposition
candidates in that election disput
ed the result of the election, and
they said that there was fraud,
massive fraud, but the Iranian gov
ernment obviously denied there
was fraud, and millions of Iranians
took to the streets of Tehran and
those in some other cities to
protest against the result of the
election. We were able to broadcast
the demonstrations the alterna
tive views, the views of opposition,
and the Iranian government was
not happy about what we were
doing. So I think that is basically
why they don't like us.
Just before the disputed presi
dential election, I'd been able to go
to Iran. I'd been travelling to Iran
for many, many years and report
ing the events, but I think the
demonstrations after that disputed
election, in away, sent a very
strong message to the Iranian gov
ernment, that there was massive
discontent in the country, and they
didn't want news organizations like
the BBC to broadcast what was
happening in the country.
TSD: How do not only you, but also
your journalists, maintain impar
tiality?
SS: The BBC operates according to
its editorial guideline, which has
been there for decades, and BBC
Persian is no different from BBC
English or BBC's other language
services; we all have one editorial
guideline, and according to that
editorial guideline, you have to
remain impartial, to remain accu
rate, to remain fair, objective, and
report what is happening in the
country.
We do our best, despite the fact

that we are not based in Iran, to
reflect the Iranian government's
views on our channel. We do our
best. We monitor all Iranian TV
channels, we monitor Iranian
newspapers, and whatever they
say, usually you can hear them or
watch them on our television, on
our radio, so we do our best.
As far as our viewers are con
cerned, we are probably the most
important impartial news channel
in Iran, and our audiences have
been growing, all the time, over the
last few years. Actually last year,
there was a news survey done in
Iran about BBC, how many people
were watching BBC Persian, and
that survey showed that within a
couple of years our viewers have
actually doubled in Iran.
TSD: With the Internet, do you
think it will be increasingly harder
for the government to reign in the
media?
SS: I think so. I mean, this day and age,
when you have social media, when you
have satellite television, where there
are all sorts of alternative means avail
able for people to circumvent those
restrictions, I don't think governments
can succeed.
Especially when you have social
media; in the past, regimes could
stop a newspaper from publishing
an article or close down a radio sta
tion, but when you have millions of
people using social media, it
becomes very, very difficult for any
regime to stop people from getting
access to alternative sources of
news. They are doing their best,
but I don't think they can succeed.
I think social media platforms are
the worst enemies for regimes that
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion.
TSD: Please tell me about the doc
umentary that's being shown today
["The Ayatollah's Seal"].
SS: The documentary is about how
Iran is ruled. A lot of people, in my
opinion, have the wrong impression
of the Iranian political system. A
lot of people think it is the parlia
mentary president, Ahmadinejad,
who is the leader of the country.
But that is not true.
The true leader of Iran is Aya
tollah Khomeini, the supreme
leader, and in this documentary, we
are trying to show how he and his
office are actually ruling in Iran.
But I'm also talking about safe
ty of journalists, which is a major
issue, not only for BBC Persian but
for journalists around the world.
Every year, hundreds of journal
ists, or at least dozens of journal

ists, are killed. In 2012, more than
100 journalists were killed around
the world. And we are also con
cerned about the issue of impunity
hardly anybody gets punished
for killing journalists so this is
what I'm going to talk about this
afternoon at Stanford University.
TSD: Do you have any personal
experiences, from Iran, being the
head of BBC Persian, with the gov
ernment harassing either you or
your family members?
SS: Yes. What the Iranian govern
ment has been doing over the last
couple of years is to put pressure
on the relatives of BBC Persian
[journalists]. Usually it is journal
ists, themselves, who are put under
pressure, but in the case of Iran,
because a lot of Iranian journalists
are now working outside the coun
try, they put pressure on their fam
ilies. So myself, and my colleagues
in BBC Persian, have been all put
in this very difficult situation,
where our families have been put
under pressure.
TSD: My last question is about the
film itself. Did you face any techni
cal difficulties when you were film
ing? Was the documentary filmed
in Iran?
SS: No, this movie was made out
side of Iran. We used a lot of
archived material from Iran, but
the film was actually made in Lon
don, in our studios, and we also
interviewed many people close to
Ayatollah Khomeini who now live
outside the country. We talked to
many experts who could explain
how the Ayatollah is ruling Iran.
This film has been received well
by our audiences in Iran and
around the world, and the Iranian
government tried to jam satellite
signals on the night we were show
ing this film in Iran, but people
could find other ways of watching
this film... because our television
service is also available on the
internet, and also, a lot of people in
the country made CDs of this film
and distributed around the country,
so millions of people have watched
this film.

The Iranian government does
n't like it, because they like to por
tray Ayatollah Khomeini, the
supreme leader of Iran, as a spiri
tual leader, somebody who is sacro
sanct, and nobody should question
his authority, and so they basically
didn't like what we made about
him.

as a producer for radio, and then
later I became BBC's Iranian
affairs analyst, and four years ago,
when the BBC started a television
service in Persian, I became head
of the BBC Persian service.
TSD: The Iranian government not
only prohibits the BBC from hav
ing an office in Tehran, but the
regime has also tried to jam the
station's satellite signals. Is that
the government's stance toward all
foreign channels that try to broad
cast in the country? Could you tell
me about the difficulties BBC faces
broadcasting there, given these cir
cumstances?
SS: Well, the Iranian government
usually doesn't like people in Iran
to have access to alternative
sources of news, so they usually
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion in Iran, but they find BBC
broadcasts especially disturbing
for themselves. So they do whatev
er they can to stop the Iranian peo
ple from listening to BBC, or
watching BBC television, or even
having access to our Internet. But
we do our best to find ways of mak
ing it possible for people to have
access to BBC content. So there is
a war going on in away: Iranians
try to jam us; we find alternative
satellites, for instance.
TSD: Why do you think the gov
ernment is so hostile toward the
BBC?
SS: I think, basically, what the
Iranian government wants is to
have a monopoly on what Iranian
people should know about Iran and
the world. They don't like people to
have access to independent and
alternative sources of news. And
BBC is providing that alternative
source of news, and I think the
Iranian government doesn't like it.
The fact of the matter is, BBC has
been broadcasting to Iran for over
70 years. BBC radio was started 70

years ago, BBC online started
more then 10 years ago and our tel
evision started four years ago, so
despite pressures from the Iranian
government, we have always been
operating in Iran, from London.
TSD: In some ways, the "war"
between Iran and the BBC really
started in 2009, when the regime
accused the BBC of helping to
foment unrest following Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's reelection through
biased reporting. In your view,
what role did the BBC actually
play in the unrest that followed
that election?
SS: I think that people know that
after the disputed Iranian presi
dential election in 2009, BBC
played a major role in informing
the people in Iran and other
Persian speakers around the world
about what was happening in
the country. The main opposition
candidates in that election disput
ed the result of the election, and
they said that there was fraud,
massive fraud, but the Iranian gov
ernment obviously denied there
was fraud, and millions of Iranians
took to the streets of Tehran and
those in some other cities to
protest against the result of the
election. We were able to broadcast
the demonstrations the alterna
tive views, the views of opposition,
and the Iranian government was
not happy about what we were
doing. So I think that is basically
why they don't like us.
Just before the disputed presi
dential election, I'd been able to go
to Iran. I'd been travelling to Iran
for many, many years and report
ing the events, but I think the
demonstrations after that disputed
election, in away, sent a very
strong message to the Iranian gov
ernment, that there was massive
discontent in the country, and they
didn't want news organizations like
the BBC to broadcast what was
happening in the country.
TSD: How do not only you, but also
your journalists, maintain impar
tiality?
SS: The BBC operates according to
its editorial guideline, which has
been there for decades, and BBC
Persian is no different from BBC
English or BBC's other language
services; we all have one editorial
guideline, and according to that
editorial guideline, you have to
remain impartial, to remain accu
rate, to remain fair, objective, and
report what is happening in the
country.
We do our best, despite the fact

that we are not based in Iran, to
reflect the Iranian government's
views on our channel. We do our
best. We monitor all Iranian TV
channels, we monitor Iranian
newspapers, and whatever they
say, usually you can hear them or
watch them on our television, on
our radio, so we do our best.
As far as our viewers are con
cerned, we are probably the most
important impartial news channel
in Iran, and our audiences have
been growing, all the time, over the
last few years. Actually last year,
there was a news survey done in
Iran about BBC, how many people
were watching BBC Persian, and
that survey showed that within a
couple of years our viewers have
actually doubled in Iran.
TSD: With the Internet, do you
think it will be increasingly harder
for the government to reign in the
media?
SS: I think so. I mean, this day and age,
when you have social media, when you
have satellite television, where there
are all sorts of alternative means avail
able for people to circumvent those
restrictions, I don't think governments
can succeed.
Especially when you have social
media; in the past, regimes could
stop a newspaper from publishing
an article or close down a radio sta
tion, but when you have millions of
people using social media, it
becomes very, very difficult for any
regime to stop people from getting
access to alternative sources of
news. They are doing their best,
but I don't think they can succeed.
I think social media platforms are
the worst enemies for regimes that
want to restrict freedom of expres
sion.
TSD: Please tell me about the doc
umentary that's being shown today
["The Ayatollah's Seal"].
SS: The documentary is about how
Iran is ruled. A lot of people, in my
opinion, have the wrong impression
of the Iranian political system. A
lot of people think it is the parlia
mentary president, Ahmadinejad,
who is the leader of the country.
But that is not true.
The true leader of Iran is Aya
tollah Khomeini, the supreme
leader, and in this documentary, we
are trying to show how he and his
office are actually ruling in Iran.
But I'm also talking about safe
ty of journalists, which is a major
issue, not only for BBC Persian but
for journalists around the world.
Every year, hundreds of journal
ists, or at least dozens of journal

ists, are killed. In 2012, more than
100 journalists were killed around
the world. And we are also con
cerned about the issue of impunity
hardly anybody gets punished
for killing journalists so this is
what I'm going to talk about this
afternoon at Stanford University.
TSD: Do you have any personal
experiences, from Iran, being the
head of BBC Persian, with the gov
ernment harassing either you or
your family members?
SS: Yes. What the Iranian govern
ment has been doing over the last
couple of years is to put pressure
on the relatives of BBC Persian
[journalists]. Usually it is journal
ists, themselves, who are put under
pressure, but in the case of Iran,
because a lot of Iranian journalists
are now working outside the coun
try, they put pressure on their fam
ilies. So myself, and my colleagues
in BBC Persian, have been all put
in this very difficult situation,
where our families have been put
under pressure.
TSD: My last question is about the
film itself. Did you face any techni
cal difficulties when you were film
ing? Was the documentary filmed
in Iran?
SS: No, this movie was made out
side of Iran. We used a lot of
archived material from Iran, but
the film was actually made in Lon
don, in our studios, and we also
interviewed many people close to
Ayatollah Khomeini who now live
outside the country. We talked to
many experts who could explain
how the Ayatollah is ruling Iran.
This film has been received well
by our audiences in Iran and
around the world, and the Iranian
government tried to jam satellite
signals on the night we were show
ing this film in Iran, but people
could find other ways of watching
this film... because our television
service is also available on the
internet, and also, a lot of people in
the country made CDs of this film
and distributed around the country,
so millions of people have watched
this film.

The Iranian government does
n't like it, because they like to por
tray Ayatollah Khomeini, the
supreme leader of Iran, as a spiri
tual leader, somebody who is sacro
sanct, and nobody should question
his authority, and so they basically
didn't like what we made about
him.
