## Sadeq Saba on Iran Head of BBC Persian discusses reporting on Iran, role of social media 
### 
Sadeq Saba became the
head of BBC Persian in
2010, just one year after
the regime in Iran
accused the BBC of help
ing to foment unrest through

biased reporting in the aftermath
of Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's reelection. Saba
previously served as BBC Iranian
affairs analyst for more than a
decade and has reported on three
Iranian presidential elections.
He spoke to The Daily on Fri
day shortly before a campus
screening of the BBC Persian doc
umentary "The Ayatollah's Seal," a
move that argues Ayatollah
Khomeini, the supreme leader, is

the individual truly ruling Iran.
The screening intends to draw atten
tion to the importance of free speech
and the safety of journalists in Iran.
TSD: Please tell us about your

ally. I was a solicitor in my hometown
