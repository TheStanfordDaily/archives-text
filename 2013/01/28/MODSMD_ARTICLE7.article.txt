## String of falsely pulled fire alarms plagues Row houses 
### MARY HARRISON 
Row houses have been plagued by
maliciously pulled fire alarms this
quarter, as two incidents at the start
of 2013 complemented seven such
incidents recorded in 2012.
According to Stanford Fire Mar
shal Joseph Leung, a fire alarm qual
ifies as a malicious pull if the alarm is
"actively and purposefully pulled
when there is no emergency." In
total, 14 alarms were pulled mali
ciously during the 2012 calendar year.
According to Zac Sergeant, assis
tant director of Residential Educa
tion (ResEd), his department has
been combating the issue of inten
tionally pulled fire alarms for years,
working alongside Residential & Din
ing Enterprises, the Stanford Uni
versity Department of Public Safety
(SUDPS) and Row house staff mem
bers.
"It's dangerous because [when an
alarm is intentionally pulled], you
have all these resources out and if it's
done multiple times in the same
evening, all of a sudden you have fire
department crews all over campus,"
he said. "In the case of a real emer
gency, that becomes problematic."
SUDPS spokesperson Bill Larson
added that false alarms are danger
ous because of the potential for per
sonal injuries during a building evac
uation.
"When you pull a fire alarm, you
could have people go into a panic,"
Larson said. People could trip or fall
someone could get hurt."
Sergeant said that Row houses
have encountered issues in the past in
which someone pulled an alarm at
one end of the house in order to steal
belongings from residents' rooms
while everybody else evacuated.
Some houses, such as Phi Kappa

Psi, are installing different fire alarms
that are designed to be more difficult
to pullâ€”without being impossible to
trigger in case of emergency.
Dane Bratz'l3, a resident assis
tant (RA) in Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE), said that his fraternity was
looking into installing new fire alarms
protected with glass that could be
broken in the case of a real fire.

"We really enjoy throwing events
that we can open up to the greater
community, but with more and more
of these incidents happening, it
makes us a bit more reluctant to do
so," Bratz said.
If a fire alarm is intentionally
pulled when there is no smoke or fire
present, Student Housing can fine
the responsible person $5OO. Addi
tionally, the district attorney may
decide to press charges; falsely
pulling a fire alarm is classified as a
misdemeanor and could result in
criminal consequences.
However, it can be extremely dif
ficult to identify the person who
pulled the fire alarm in situations
such as crowded parties.
If a responsible person is not
found, the house where the alarm
was pulled is responsible for the $5OO
fine, which can cause major financial
burdens for houses that throw par
ties. According to Amanda
Rodriguez, assistant director of
ResEd, the email listserv for Row
RAs has served as an alert system
throughout the Row when a house's
fire alarm is maliciously pulled.
"It's been kind of hit-and-miss in
the past couple of years," Rodriguez
said. "Sometimes they [Row houses]
can find the person who was respon
sible, but a lot of the time they can't."
