## Stanford alum resigns as COO of Square over sexual harassment allegations 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Edward Ngai Aaron Sekhri 
Keith Rabois '9l, chief operating officer of
mobile payments company Square and former
Stanford Law School student, has resigned
over allegations of sexual harassment.
A Square employee alleges that Rabois
sexually harassed him and that the company
was aware of but failed to act on the situation.
The company has refused to disclose the
employee's identity. Rabois has denied the alle
gations.
Rabois, in a lengthy blog post, explained
that he had a "physical relationship" with his
accuser, a man he met "via mutual friends" and
whom he helped prepare for job interviews.
According to his post, Rabois resigned not as
an admission of guilt, but because he believed
the scrutiny of his personal affairs would hurt
the company too much.
"I decided to resign... so my colleagues
could continue to do great work without the
distraction that a lawsuit would most certainly
bring," he wrote.
No lawsuit has been filed against Rabois or
Square.
Rabois, who earned his bachelor's degree

from Stanford, had a publicized history of
homophobia at Stanford. In 1992, while he was
working towards a law degree, Rabois appar
ently uttered a number of anti-gay slurs in the
direction of the home of a resident fellow in
Otero House in Wilbur Hall.
Rabois allegedly said, "F 1! Hope you
die of AIDS!" and "Can't wait until you die, f—
—t." Later, in a letter to The Daily, he framed
his words in the context of free speech, arguing
he was trying to be "outrageous enough to pro
voke a thought of, 'Wow, if he can say that, I
guess I can say a little more than I thought'."
The Fundamental Standard was not applied
to Rabois, and amid the on-campus furor over
his remarks, he dropped out of Stanford Law
School to continue his studies at Harvard.
Square has released a statement accepting
Rabois' resignation, saying that he "exercised
poor judgment."
The San Francisco-based company secured
a $25 million investment in August 2012 from
Starbucks and is positioning itself to better
compete with other technology companies like
eßay and Google. Rabois joined the company
in 2010 and oversaw its growth from 17
employees to over 400 during his tenure.
No lawsuit has yet been filed against
Rabois or Square, and Rabois has said to the
Wall Street Journal that he is "completely con
fident that all the facts will come out and I will
be vindicated."
