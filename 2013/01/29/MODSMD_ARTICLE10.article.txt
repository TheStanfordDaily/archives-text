# BASES EMPTY
## FIRST SCRIMMAGES SHINE LIGHT ON LINEUP 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's road to Omaha began
this weekend with three intra-squad scrim
mages at Sunken Diamond.
With many starters moving on to profes
sional baseball in the 2012 draft, this week
end provided an early look at who might start
in three weeks, when Stanford heads to
Houston to take on the Rice Owls in its sea
son-opening series.

The starting lineup traditionally head
coach Mark Marquess has his expected
starters play against his expected backups
for the intra-squads was identical for all
three of the weekend's scrimmages, perhaps
suggesting that Marquess is not thinking of
changing it up.
Junior right fielder Austin Wilson, who
was one of only four players to start every
Stanford game in 2012, is the only returning
starter in the Cardinal outfield. Wilson
showed off his power, hitting three homers
over the weekend, including two in his first
two at-bats on Saturday. This weekend, Wil

son was joined in the lineup by sophomore
left fielder Dominic Jose and freshman cen
ter fielder Jonny Locher.
Locher, whose presence in the starting
lineup came as a bit of a surprise to many,
showed why the coaches like him with two
home runs on Friday afternoon. Locher's
teammates say that the switch-hitter from
Burien, Wash., is the fastest player on the
team, even beating out the lefties to first
base from the right-handed hitter's batter's
box.
The infield looks to have at most one bat
tle for a starting spot. Sophomore third base
man Alex Blandino and junior first baseman
Brian Ragira are locks at the corner infield
positions, and junior shortstop Lonnie Kaup
pila looks to be close to 100 percent coming
back from his season-ending ACL injury in
2012.
The one spot that has at least a legitimate
possibility of changing is second base. Junior
Danny Diekroeger started all three games
over the weekend at second, but fellow junior

Junior shortstop Lonnie Kauppila is looking to take back his starting job after missing
much of last season with a torn ACL. The Cardinal opened this season with three intrasquad
scrimmages this weekend. The official season begins at Rice on Feb. 15.
Brett Michael Doran and
sophomore Austin Slater
could push for time.
Diekroeger is likely to at
least be in the batting order for
every game at either designat
ed hitter or second base. Not
only is the junior one of the
better hitters on the team
his .354 batting average was
second on the team in 2012
but he is one of the only left
handed hitters in the lineup.
Though the lineup is start
ing to come into place, there
are still many questions with
the pitching staff. Senior
Mark Appel, a top-10 pick of
the Pittsburgh Pirates last
year who did not sign, will be
the Friday night starter, but
the other weekend slots are
available.
One of those spots may
have been filled on Friday,
when freshman Freddy Avis
was lights out over two
innings of action in his first
pitching appearance since
April. Avis, a standout at

Menlo School in Atherton,
Calif., is finally healthy after
battling arm issues for almost
a year and looked like a week
end Pac-12 starter.
The battle for that Sunday
starter spot was nowhere near*
resolved over the weekend.
Sophomore John Hochstatter,
who held that Sunday starter
role early in the 2012 season,
struggled mightily with his
control on Saturday. Howev
er, he was able to fight
through two scoreless
innings. Redshirt junior Gar
rett Hughes might be in the
lead for that Sunday role
after a very solid outing.
Stanford has two week
ends left to fill the rest of the
holes in the lineup before the
Rice series kicks off the Car
dinal's season. Though the
gates to Sunken Diamond are
always open for the intra
squad scrimmages, fans look
ing for a more formal last
look at Stanford before the
season begins can stop by on
February 9 at 1 p.m. for the
annual Cardinal vs. White
scrimmage.
