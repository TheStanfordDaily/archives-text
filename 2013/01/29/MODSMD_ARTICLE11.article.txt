The Stanford women's gymnastics team came into
Saturday's meet at Cal with a streak of 27 straight vic
tories against the Golden Bears since 2000, with an
overall record of 36-1 dating back 1996. Therefore,
another victory might have been expected. What
might not have been expected, however, was a season
best score for the Cardinal team and four individual
titles to boot.

Cal posted its highest team score since 2007, so it
would take a strong performance from Stanford to
earn a victory. Stanford did just that, earning the
196.450-195.775 victory one week removed from its
first loss of the season against Georgia. The 196.450
score is the Cardinal's highest score of the season,
replacing the previous best score of 196.025 when they
traveled to Arizona two weeks ago. The Cardinal's win
improved its record to 7-1.
Stanford got off to a strong start on vault, posting
a 49.275 compared to Cal's 48.900. Stanford was led
once again by senior captain Ashley Morgan, whose
9.925 tied her career-best score on vault and was good
enough to earn herself the individual victory in the
event. Morgan had a strong supporting cast as well, as
freshman Taylor Rice put up a career-best 9.900 while
freshman Melissa Chuang and sophomore Pauline
Hanset posted a pair of 9.825 scores.
The Cardinal kept the ball rolling on uneven bars,
as Samantha Shapiro led the way with a 9.950.
Shapiro's score was a new career-best for the sopho
more, who specializes in the uneven bars, outdoing her
previous high of 9.900 set last year. Sophomore Kristi
na Vaculik scored a 9.900, while Ashley and junior
Shona Morgan both scored 9.850'5. The Cardinal
scored a 49.300 as a team, its best team score of the

Senior Ashley Morgan and the No. 10 Stanford
women's gymnastics squad knocked off Cal for its
28th-straight victory over the Bears. Both teams
posted season-high scores in the meet.
Fosco and Jordan Nolff con
tinued their dominance,
scoring 15.200 and 15.100
respectively en route to a 1-2
finish, the duo's third consec
utive top-3 finish this season.
It would not be enough as
the Wolverines were on their
game from the get go.

The first event of the
night for Stanford was the
pommel horse, and while
junior Chris Turner turned
in a third-place score of
14.400, with senior John
Martin just behind at 14.200,
Stanford posted its lowest
score on the event this season:
69.750.
That put the Card five
points behind Michigan, which
did quite well in its first rota
tion on the floor exercise. The
Wolverines began the compe

tition on floor, where Stacey
Ervin paced the competition
with a 15.40 to place first. Cae
sar followed with a career
high 15.25, and Adrian de los
Angeles registered a score of
15.20 to help the Maize and
Blue begin the night with a
74.75.

In its next event, floor
exercise, the Cardinal
received solid routines from
Michael Levy, Jonathan
Deaton and Paul Hichwa,
with each scoring in the

14.0005. Levy led the group
with a 14.800 and was fol
lowed by Deaton (14.550)
and Hichwa (14.350). Unfor
tunately, the three perform
ances weren't enough, and
the Cardinal tied its season
low team score on the event
with a 70.600.
Deaton continued to con
tribute to the comeback
cause on vault, delivering a
new career-best of 14.800 to
earn a fourth-place finish in
the meet. The rest of the
Cardinal scored in the low
to-mid 14.000s on the event,
recording its highest team
score on an event to that

point (72.650).
But then came the high
bar, where Stanford strug
gled on the comeback trail.
Led by seniors Cameron
Foreman and Eddie Penev,
who scored 14.400 and 14.150,
respectively, Stanford record
ed its lowest team-score of
the meet with a 69.450.
In the meantime, Michi
gan went to town on the par
allel bars, scoring a 74.50. On
the parallel bars, Caesar
posted an NCAA-record
15.90 score besting the old
record of 15.85 set by Califor
nia's Tim McNeill in 2008
to record his second of two

individual event titles. De los
Angeles was close behind,
putting up a score of 15.40 to
place second.
But with victory likely out
of reach, the Cardinal still
ended its meet on a high note
when its turn came on the
parallel bars. Penev finished
third with a new career-high
score of 15.250 and Foreman
finished tied for fourth with a
15.050.
Stanford will not compete
as a team for four weeks, as
six members of the Cardinal
will compete in the Winter
Cup Challenge a competi
tion hosted by USA Gymnas
tics to help determine the 15
men who will be selected for
the U.S. Men's Senior Nation
al Team. The Winter Cup
Challenge will take place in
Las Vegas on Feb. 7-9.
The team will return to
action Feb. 17 at home for
the Big Flip Off against rival
California. The meet will be
broadcast live on the Pac-12
Networks.
