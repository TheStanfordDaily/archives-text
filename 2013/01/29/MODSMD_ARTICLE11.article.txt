The Stanford women's gymnastics team came into
Saturday's meet at Cal with a streak of 27 straight vic
tories against the Golden Bears since 2000, with an
overall record of 36-1 dating back 1996. Therefore,
another victory might have been expected. What
might not have been expected, however, was a season
best score for the Cardinal team and four individual
titles to boot.

Cal posted its highest team score since 2007, so it
would take a strong performance from Stanford to
earn a victory. Stanford did just that, earning the
196.450-195.775 victory one week removed from its
first loss of the season against Georgia. The 196.450
score is the Cardinal's highest score of the season,
replacing the previous best score of 196.025 when they
traveled to Arizona two weeks ago. The Cardinal's win
improved its record to 7-1.
Stanford got off to a strong start on vault, posting
a 49.275 compared to Cal's 48.900. Stanford was led
once again by senior captain Ashley Morgan, whose
9.925 tied her career-best score on vault and was good
enough to earn herself the individual victory in the
event. Morgan had a strong supporting cast as well, as
freshman Taylor Rice put up a career-best 9.900 while
freshman Melissa Chuang and sophomore Pauline
Hanset posted a pair of 9.825 scores.
The Cardinal kept the ball rolling on uneven bars,
as Samantha Shapiro led the way with a 9.950.
Shapiro's score was a new career-best for the sopho
more, who specializes in the uneven bars, outdoing her
previous high of 9.900 set last year. Sophomore Kristi
na Vaculik scored a 9.900, while Ashley and junior
Shona Morgan both scored 9.850'5. The Cardinal
scored a 49.300 as a team, its best team score of the
