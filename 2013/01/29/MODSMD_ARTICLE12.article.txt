# MICHIGAN KNOCKS OFF CARD
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
On the surface, Stanford versus
Michigan does not seem like much of
a natural sports rivalry. The maize
and blue of Michigan are lost in the
frozen tundra of Big 10 country while
the Cardinal soaks up the sun of the
Pac-12. But on Saturday, both played
roles as titans of the men's gymnas
tics world in a clash that saw the No.
3 Wolverines overpower No. 2 Stan
ford from the beginning of the meet.

The loss was the first of the season
for the Cardinal (4-1) in the presea
son, and a bit surprising given the hot
streak Stanford had been on with a
win at the Stanford Open that fea
tured victories over three top-10
opponents.
Michigan, however, was unim
pressed.
With a crowd of 1,095 taking in the
Wolverines' home opener, Syque Cae
sar's NCAA-record performance on
the parallel bars was enough to
counter several solid individual
efforts for Stanford as Michigan won
by 10.4 points.

Seniors James Fosco (above) and Jordan Nolff dominated once again on the rings, scoring 15.200
and 15.100 respectively. However, it was not enough for Stanford, as the No. 2 Cardinal fell at No. 3

over Cal 98.575-97.900.
Stanford posted a 48.775
on beam, increasing its lead
over Cal 147.350-146.450.
Sophomore Ivana Hong,
after missing last week's
meet, showed how valuable of
an asset she is, scoring a
career-best 9.925 in the event

to take home the individual
title. Junior Amanda Spinner
finished second with a 9.825,
as Spinner and Hong now
have the Cardinal's four best
scores in the event on the
season.
Going into the final round
with a 0.900-point lead, Stan
ford looked to wrap up the
event with a strong finish on
floor exercise. It did just that,
as the team's 49.100 score
was its best floor score of the
season, and was enough to
seal the victory despite Cal's

strong 49.325 score. Ashley
Morgan scored a 9.925 to tie
for the win of the individual
event, which was the highest
score a Cardinal has put up in
the event so far this season.
Shona Morgan earned the
third spot with a 9.875.
Ashley Morgan earned
another all-around individual
victory, her second victory in
as many weeks, with another
39.225. After stressing last
week the importance of fight
ing for and "squeezing out"
every fraction of a point, she

exemplified that standard
this week as her teammates
followed her lead.
The team next competes
on Saturday, Feb. 2nd, at
home against UCLA. The
Bruins are undefeated so far
this season, earning then* No.
4 national ranking with three
consecutive dual meet victo
ries. The Cardinal hopes to
put an end to that streak in
Saturday's televised event.
