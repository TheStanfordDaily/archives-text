# MICHIGAN KNOCKS OFF CARD

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
On the surface, Stanford versus
Michigan does not seem like much of
a natural sports rivalry. The maize
and blue of Michigan are lost in the
frozen tundra of Big 10 country while
the Cardinal soaks up the sun of the
Pac-12. But on Saturday, both played
roles as titans of the men's gymnas
tics world in a clash that saw the No.
3 Wolverines overpower No. 2 Stan
ford from the beginning of the meet.

The loss was the first of the season
for the Cardinal (4-1) in the presea
son, and a bit surprising given the hot
streak Stanford had been on with a
win at the Stanford Open that fea
tured victories over three top-10
opponents.
Michigan, however, was unim
pressed.
With a crowd of 1,095 taking in the
Wolverines' home opener, Syque Cae
sar's NCAA-record performance on
the parallel bars was enough to
counter several solid individual
efforts for Stanford as Michigan won
by 10.4 points.
