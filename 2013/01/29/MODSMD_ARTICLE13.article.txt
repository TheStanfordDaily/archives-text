## Stanford's ideal mental health climate 
### Emily Cohodes 
The Bridge held its first-ever
suicide drill last weekend.
Staffers receive basic training
about how to deal with suicidal
callers, but this drill offered a unique
opportunity for staffers to witness a
comprehensive role-play complete
with presentations from the Stan
ford Police and Residential Educa
tion.
As part of the drill, the Stanford
police did a very realistic mock
"5150" examination of our actor. A
5150 is the examination of mental
state that police do to determine
whether someone needs to be hospi
talized in a psychiatric ward. When
asked to describe how police typical
ly go through their protocol without
drawing attention to and shaming
the student being examined, one of
the officers said that he tells stu
dents that there is no stigma associ
ated with being taken to the emer
gency room because you need some
help. My first reaction to this answer
was disbelief â€”how could someone
experienced in this field say that
there is no stigma in being admitted
to the hospital for mental illness
when it's hard enough to even get
students to admit that they're
stressed out? But then I realized
that this borderline-fantastical senti
ment is my dream for Stanford.

When helping someone problem
solve about a situation in the realm
of peer counseling (or more broadly
applied, in the realm of friendship),
it's often a good thought exercise to
ask them to think of the best possi
ble outcome. A request to do so is
often followed by uncomfortable
laughter or rolling of the eyes, and
then some sort of statement like,
"Not that this would ever happen,
but..."
Writing this column on mental
health has inspired me to do the
same thing for mental health on
campus. I have been inspired by the
many kind comments, emails and
notes that I received about my
columns from students express
ing relief that their emotions and
experiences at Stanford had been
validated by seeing stories like
theirs printed in The Daily to par
ents and professors lamenting the
degree to which stigma inhibits
healthy decisions among college stu
dents that I have dared to rethink
what is possible for our community
wellness. I view the outpouring of
responses to simple ideas about
well-being and self-care, for exam
ple, as a sign that the Stanford com
munity is more ready than ever to
make big changes in the right direc
tion, to reconsider our collective pri
orities and to make sure that our
education system is serving us well
both academically and mentally.
I now see the "best case sce
nario" for Stanford as one in which
this school becomes a place where
telling someone that you're going to
CAPS after class is not any more
unusual than going to Arrillaga (the
gym, dining hall or Alumni Center),
where getting enough sleep and hav
ing time to talk to friends reaches
the top of the to-do list rather than
CS assignments and consulting
interview prep and where "How are
you?" is not a pleasantry exchanged
in passing but a question that is only
asked when you really want to know
the answer and when you're ready to
support someone as they tell you
about their life.
I want to leave you with this: As
the words of the police officer at the
drill on Saturday and responses
from readers like you have remind
ed me, strive to have huge expecta
tions of yourself and others in what
ever circle of campus culture you
dwell. For me, this means imagining
the impossible and working toward
the end goal of a campus that is free
of stigma and social pressure and
negative connotation and stereo
types of mental illness. Work toward
these lofty goals as if there will not
be a chance to work on them tomor
row.
And finally, as community mem
bers, recognize that no matter what
you do, you are part of the equation.
We live an interdependent life at
Stanford in which we are affected by

the social stimuli that percolate
around us each day. Your behaviors
are crucial to thousands of social jus
tice movements and your thoughts
and attitudes have tremendous con
sequences. Do not succumb to the
norms of campus culture because it
is convenient. Push the envelope
whenever you see a possibility for
change, question authority and reg
ulations and prioritize your and your
fellow community members' well
being always. If nothing else, I beg
you to imagine the impossible and
convince yourself to view it as
tomorrow's reality.
