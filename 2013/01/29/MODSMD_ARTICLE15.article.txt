# WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE
## Beyond Duck Syndrome 
### Chris Herries 
A few days ago I sat down for
coffee with a person who was
feeling pretty dejected. She
described how school was tough,
things were getting bad back home
and there was no one to turn to on
campus. But she wanted to put on a
facade of easiness so as not to
attract attention. She was describ
ing what a lot of us call the stereo
typical "Stanford duck" a person
fine on the surface but paddling
furiously beneath the surface to
stay afloat.
When I originally sat down to
write this article I was going to crit
icize the idea of Stanford duck syn-

drome. After all, here at Stanford
we have fantastic support networks
ranging from psychologists to advi
sors to community centers. The
onus was in some sense on her to
seek out these highly visible
resources. I thought that, unless
you have a serious mental illness,
there's no reason to be sad, because
there are so many places on campus
geared towards helping people.
I still feel that, in away, privilege
precludes sadness. There are times
when you need to haul yourself up
out of your moods and move on with
life. Shit happens to everyone.
We're all busy, we all make mistakes
and we all have high expectations
that aren't always met. You go drink
with friends or eat a cookie what
ever it takes to cope. Ultimately,
you have to own your emotions and
realize that you can't control the sit
uation, you can only control your
reaction. What made me most
angry is that a lot of times our neg
ativity isn't validated, it's just
flawed thinking. It's an overused
term often applied to people who
need to harden up.
I stand by much of this. There
are few things I respect more than
hard work and self-sufficiency.
Those are the solutions for most of
us. Most of us get back to equilibri
um. Most, but not all.
I understand as well as anyone

that depression is a serious, crip
pling issue for people our age. Sta
tistically speaking, something like
one-fifth of us will go through a
major depressive episode at some
point in our lives, and it tends to
happen in a person's early twenties.
Therefore, I resent the term
duck syndrome, but I don't reject it.
My biggest qualm is that we use it
without the utmost solemnity. We
lump together all the problems we
have and treat them equally in con
versation. In reality, the difference
between depression and sadness is
a gaping gulf. Yet, we don't make

those distinctions. We need to be
able to distinguish between the two
in everyday talk. Only then can we
enhance our dialogue and recognize
people who are really need help.
Changing how we think about
mental illness is one step in solving
the problem. That's why I work at
the Bridge and speak for Stanford
Peace of Mind. It's not always fun to
staff the counseling center on Fri
day nights when I could be drinking.
It's also not fun speaking to random
strangers about depression. But it's
important for us to move our talk
beyond the simplicity of duck syn-

drome and address the fact that
there are depressed, downtrodden,
suffering and, yes, suicidal people on
campus who need help.
I'm not saying we all need to
rush to join the mental health
groups on campus, although you
should feel free to. But we should all
take seriously the question, "How
are you?" If you take the time to lis
ten, you may be surprised at a per
son's answer. And your own.
