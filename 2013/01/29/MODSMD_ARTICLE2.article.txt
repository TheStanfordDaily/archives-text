## Police to form bike theft task force 
### HELIN GAO 
The Stanford University Department
of Public Safety (SUDPS) is forming a
focus group of officers to combat bicycle
crimes in response to the consistently high
bike theft rate on campus.
While details of the focus group are yet
to be finalized, the group will consist of
representatives from different units with
in SUDPS, including Deputy Adam Cullen

and SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson.
"Once we have formed this group, we
may even reach out to the other depart
ments and the community to get some
feedback on how to fight bike crimes,"
Larson said.
According to the 2012 Safety, Security
& Fire Report issued by the department,
318 bike thefts were reported in 2011,326
in 2010 and 375 in 2009.
"The actual number is much higher

because a number of bike thefts are not
reported," Larson said. "They [students
whose bikes are stolen] find it a hassle and
think that nothing can be done about it."
Larson added that there are many
instances of bikes being recovered after
they are reported missing, either when
the bike is found deserted in another part
of campus or discovered by officers during

2009, 201 0 and 2011, but SUDPS spokesman Bill Larson said that many bike thefts go unreported.
