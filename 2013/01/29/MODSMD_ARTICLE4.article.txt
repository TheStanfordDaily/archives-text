## UAR looks to hire more PMAs 
### GUILLERMO GOMEZ 
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) will add two new academic directors and
recruit more pre-major advisors (PMA) in
upcoming years in accordance with the sugges
tions of the Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford (SUES), according to Kirsti
Copeland, director of residentially based advis
ing.
The SUES report, which also put forward
sweeping changes to undergraduate academic
requirements, proposed several changes to the
PMA program, including expanding the pool of
faculty pre-major advisors, reintroducing peer
advising and increasing the number of academic
directors (who also advise students).
Peer advising will not be reintroduced, howev
er, because according to Copeland —it is
more appropriate for particular departments and
programs than for general pre-major advising.
"Everything was done in order for the aver
age number [of advisees] to go down to six per
advisor," explained Melissa
Stevenson '96, academic
director in Florence Moore
Hall.
In previous years, an
average of eight students
have been assigned to each
advisor.
Stevenson framed the
changes in advising as ulti
mately beneficial to both
students and advisors with
in the PMA program.
"Students get more one
on-one time with their advi
sors, and the time commit
ment for advisors is
reduced," she said.
Copeland, Stevenson,
and Salem Aweiss, a PMA

for students living in Flo-
Mo, agreed that there is still
room for improvement in
the advising program
beyond the new changes.
"One thing we would like
to work on is messaging to
PMAs and students what
we expect them to be
doing," Copeland said.
Copeland also expressed
a desire for the advising
program to grow in scope
while becoming more effi
cient.
"I just hope we can con
tinue to get more and more
faculty involved and that we
do better messaging," she
said.
Aweiss echoed the call
for more faculty to volun
teer as advisors and empha
sized the mutual benefits of
advising. He claimed that
making potential PMAs

aware of the benefits of
being a PMA, streamlining
the training process and
finding some sort of com
pensation for PMAs such
as a thank-you note or nom
inal compensation might
encourage broader partici
pation in the PMA program.
"I can't comment on the
overhaul of availability of
advisors," Aweiss said.
"What I can say is that my
experience has been very
positive. The interaction
with the students has been
pleasurable and I certainly
hope that they got some
thing good [and] positive
out of the interaction. I
would certainly encourage
other faculty to have a go at
it."
