# New music room debuts
## Sound-proof space in Stern will be open to all students, more campus music rooms may follow 
### KIANA HUI 
Stern Dining is now home to a music room open to
all students for practice during regular dining hall
hours.
According to Stephanie Eberle, Burbank resident
fellow, student musicians have struggled to find places
to practice so that they do not disturb their neighbors.
"[Practice space] has always been a common con
cern," Eberle said. "It usually starts when people are
practicing in their rooms, and it disrupts. Then they
practice in the basements, and it's disruptive. It's been
sort of constant over the last six years I've been here."
A number of student and administrative bodies
worked together to open the new Stern space. Initial
concerns raised by students about a lack of practice
space prompted the University's arts departments and
the ASSU Senate to find practice spaces for musicians
unaffiliated with arts departments, with a focus on stu
dent bands.
ASSU Senator and Student Life Chair Viraj Bindra
'l5 spearheaded the effort to open up a new space for
student musicians.
"I tried to find out if there was any space on campus
for undergraduates to practice who weren't in the
music department, and I found out there weren't any,"
he said. "I thought there's probably a dearth of these
rooms on campus, so I decided to see if there were any
vacant rooms we could use for that."
Bindra, with the help of James Cadena, director of
arts for the Office of Residential Education (ResEd),
ended up finding space in Stern dining. Chartered as
both a conference and music room, the room lacked suf
ficient accessories like soundproofing and wiling.
Once the space was found, Bindra and several stu
dents convinced Residential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) that the music room was a necessity.
"After talking to them, stressing the need, and
organizing some students who were in bands to get
their voices heard, R&DE agreed to do the sound
proofing and wiring of the room as long as we would
handle the marketing and the equipment," Bindra said.
Tom Skipworth, Stern dining's general manager,
facilitated the conversation between students, student
government and R&DE.
"The students are the cause," Skipworth said.
"They are what we are all here for."
R&DE handled wiling and sound-proofing of the
room over winter break, and this past week the ASSU
Senate allotted $1,500 to buy amplifiers, microphones
and other music equipment necessary to put the space
to use.
What used to hold a big desk and a few chairs has
been replaced by sound-proofed walls decorated with
geometric patterns, electrical wiling, a drum kit and
other musical equipment.
"There's already been a lot of interest shown by stu
dents who play instruments," Skipworth said.
The outfitted music room is still in its early stages.
University administrators are still trying to work out
details concerning the availability of the room apart
from dining hall hours.
"It is still a work in progress getting people in and
out of the room," Skipworth said. 'As of now, we can
open it when we're here, but when we're not here, we
can't really give access to students in the evenings so
they can come play."
Depending on the Stern practice room's reception,
similar practice rooms may be opened across campus.
One possible conversion still in early discussion stages
is a room in Manzanita dining that could host another
music space.
