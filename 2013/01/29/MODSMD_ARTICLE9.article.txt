## Sorry Tom, but fighting is vital to hockey 
### Joseph Beyda 
I had hoped to devote this column
to Patrick Marleau, my favorite
hockey player, who tied a 96-
year-old NHL record last week
by scoring multiple goals in the
first four games of the season only
to break the streak by scoring just a
single, measly goal when I made it to
my first Sharks game since the lock
out on Sunday night.
But then Tom Taylor, The Daily's
own Englishman extraordinaire, came
along yesterday and described his first
live hockey experience, complaining
about the fighting he saw in the
Sharks' win on Saturday and the fact
that the fans "bayed for [the players']
blood." He called on the league to get
rid of the violence and for its officials to
"actually [enforce] the rules" instead
of letting players get away with hock
ey's variety of vigilante justice.
Speaking for hockey fans every
where, Tom, let me say this: We hear
you loud and clear. We get that fight
ing is easily the most off-putting
aspect of the game to outsiders, and
most of us have ourselves had trouble
coming to terms with it at one point or
another. I even skirted the issue when
I waxed poetic about the best sport on
earth in this veiy spot a couple of
weeks ago.
But saying that, "Supporters of
fighting in hockey rely on nothing
more than excuses to defend the inde
fensible," or, "Don't even try to justify
fighting"?
Game on, Tom Taylor.
To make my case for why fighting
is not only necessary but beneficial, in
hockey, I'm going to use the very same
play that Tom took offense to during
Saturday's game. The sequence began
when Colorado Avalanche captain
Gabriel Landeskog skated up the
boards and was leveled by Sharks
defenseman Brad Stuart.
Now, there are two types of hockey
hits: clean ones and dirty ones. As the
names imply the first type is perfectly
legal and the second type defined
by factors such as attempting to injure
a player, hitting an opponent's head or
leaving your feet to deliver an unsafe
ly powerful blow—can result in a
stint in the penalty box, a fine or even
a suspension, depending on the sever
ity of the infraction.
(It should be noted here that hock
ey has taken some of the most aggres
sive action in professional sports by
suspending players whose unsafe hits
threaten others' safety. League disci
plinarian Brendan Shanahan, once a
professional tough guy himself, issued
58 such "Shanabans" last season
alone.)
By most objective accounts, Stuar
t's hit was clean: He was making a play
on the puck handler, he stayed on his
feet and any contact with Landeskog's
head was incidental. But Colorado
defenseman Ryan O'Byrne thought
otherwise, and you don't let a dirty hit
to your team captain go unpunished. If
you did, after all, who's to stop the oth
er team from pummeling him again on
the next shift?
Regardless, as there was nothing
blatantly bad about the hit, the level
headed thing for O'Byrne to do would
have been to line Stuart up and deliver
a legal, crushing check against the
boards. That sort of retaliation hap
pens all the time in hockey. Instead,
O'Byrne lost his cool and went right
after Stuart, wrestling him down and
starting a fight.
Tom and others wonder why the
chaos of fighting seems so institution
alized in hockey, but shocking as the
fisticuffs appear, they're not nearly as
violent as your average dark-alley
duel. That's because the players are
still on ice, and if you've ever worn a
paii* of skates you know that a quick
change of momentum say, lunging
your fist forward —is a pretty easy
way to fall. So in any hockey fight, the
first thing the two players do isn't to go
for the haymaker, but to grab their
adversary's jersey with their left hand
for stability.
Now that everybody's safely
entangled, the hilarity can begin. Each
player stiff-arms their opponent's right
shoulder with their left hand as they
swing own their right fist around at
their adversary's head, which is now
conveniently out of reach because of
said stiff-arm and usually no
longer sports a helmet, the removal
of which is a common courtesy to
prevent bruised or broken fingers.
Most punches miss, and in an even
fight there are only two ways to
make contact: with a surprise upper
cut by the right hand or a pesky, six
inch jab to the chin with that all-impor
tant left paw
Occasionally a big punch lands;
even less often there's blood. Nine
times out of 10 a hockey fight is more
like wrestling than boxing, but the fre
netic flair of flying fists can be a bit
misleading.
