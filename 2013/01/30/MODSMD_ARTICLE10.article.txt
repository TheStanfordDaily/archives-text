# Internet outage hits residences
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marshall Watkins 
An Internet outage affected students across
campus early Ttiesday morning, with the failure of a
network distribution switch causing the loss of
wired and wireless Internet access for approximate
ly three hours.
The equipment failure, which took place at
around 1:25 a.m., impacted residences throughout
campus. According to Nancy Ware, director of
strategic planning and communications for IT Serv
ices, affected locations included Governor's Corner,
Grove, the Haas Center for Public Service, the
Knoll, Lyman, Lagunita, Roble and Wilbur Hall.
Upper Row and Suites residents also reported out
ages during the same time period.
"It's probably safe to say that nearly all of the
undergraduate residences were affected," said
Sherwin Smith, Residential Computing consulting
services manager.
Ware framed the outage as a relatively rare

occurrence, noting that only one other such incident
which affected Escondido Village residences
took place in the last two years.
An effort to preclude such outages by providing
residential networks with redundant network con
nections in case of equipment failure began in Dec.
2012 and will be completed by the end of this winter
quarter. All academic buildings have already
migrated to the new "backbone network," according
to Ware.
