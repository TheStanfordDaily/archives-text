### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marwa Farag 
Melissa Ketunuti M.D. 'O7, 35, a pediatrician at
the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was found
dead in the basement of her Philadelphia home on
Jan. 21.
Exterminator Jason Smith, 36, was arrested and
charged with murder, arson, abuse of a corpse and
risking a catastrophe on Jan. 23. He is currently
being held without bail after confessing to the
crime.
Ketunuti, a second-year infectious diseases fel
low and researcher, had called an exterminating
service to deal with a rodent problem, according to
Capt. James Clark of the Philadelphia Police
Department. Smith was subcontracted out for the
job. Police believe Smith and Ketunuti then got into
an argument, details of which have not been
released.
According to Clark, the suspect "struck her
while she was in the basement, knocked her down,
strangled her to death and ultimately set her body
on fire." There were no signs of sexual assault.
When they announced Smith's arrest, police said
they believe the body was set on fire in an attempt
to get rid of evidence.
Ketunuti's dog-walker discovered the body on
fire in the house approximately 15 minutes after
Smith had left the vicinity. He then went on to
another job in New Jersey.
Detectives used neighborhood video footage that
captured Smith entering and leaving the house to
identify him as the killer. Police reported that
Smith's criminal record contained only "minor traf
fic offenses" before the incident.
"Melissa was a warm, caring, earnest, bright
young woman with her whole future ahead of her,"
said Paul Offit, chief of the hospital's division of
infectious diseases, in an emailed statement to
CNN.
Ketunuti family spokeswoman Manisha Pai
released a statement on Jan. 25.
"The family and friends of Melissa Ketunuti are
devastated by this senseless act of violence that has
ended the life of someone who was so loved, cher
ished and admired," the statement read.
"Melissa was a source of joy to everyone in her
life. Her passing has left an enormous gap in our
lives."
