## Don't look now, but the Dubs are back 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
I stalled watching the Warriors
nearly nine years ago, mainly
because there was nothing else
on TV to watch. Those were the
good old days, with superstars
like Thoy Murphy, Adonal Foyle and
Mike Dunleavy putting up great num
bers and managing to lose nearly all of
their games.
Under the wise and able guidance
of renowned owner Chris Cohan
(sense the sarcasm?), the Warriors
put up spectacular bottom lines (prof
its, not box scores), alienated one of
the greatest fan bases in existence
today, sold a ton of t-shirts, butchered
draft picks, sold more t-shirts, hiked
up season ticket prices to hitherto
unforeseen heights and sold even
more t-shirts.

In short, they were like the Oak
land Raiders, only without A1 Davis
running the show. Although many
would argue that is a good thing, at
least A1 Davis cared about winning;
his catchphrase was "Just Win, Baby."
With Chris Cohan, about the only
thing you were guaranteed was the
cheapest roster possible. His catch
phrase might have been "Kaching."
Why watch this team then, you
might ask. Why put yourself through
the pain of a team destined for noth
ing more than mediocrity? Why suffer
the whims of a multimillionaire owner
pinching pennies in order to expand
his ever-growing coffers?
I guess first it was the throwback
jerseys. The classic retro, blue-and
gold embossed unis with "The City"
proudly emblazoned on their fronts
were (and still are) some of the great
est uniforms that can be had. (Please
this excuse this small interruption as
your author rushes to Ebay.com to get
a dirt-cheap Patrick O'Bryant jersey.
You can even take this time to look up
Patrick O'Bryant on Google and find
out exactly how badly the Dubs
screwed him.)
But more than that, there was
always something about how much
people cared about the Warriors.
Casual fans and diehard nuts alike
would always be talking about how
this was the year, about how the latest
coaching hire (hello, Mike Mont
gomery) or the latest draft pick (hello,
Brandan Wright and Anthony Ran
dolph) or the latest D-League discov
ery (hello, Kelenna Azubuike) would
bring the team to the cusp of the play
offs, a height last reached in the clas
sic "Run TMC" days starring Mitch
Richmond, Chris Mullin and Tim
Hardaway.
But invariably, the opposite would
occur. Mike Montgomery went down
in flames, taking the fate of Stanford
basketball with him for a few years,
and then had the temerity to go coach
at that other school across the Bay.
Brandan Wright couldn't sniff the
starting lineup; Anthony Randolph
combined incredible athleticism with
incredibly boneheaded basketball
mistakes (a la Javale McGee today).
Kelenna Azubuike, for a time,
remained my favorite Warriors play
er, an impossibly sculpted, soft-spo
ken, tenacious basketball player who
eventually succumbed to a torn ACL.

The Warriors couldn't seem to
catch a break, much less run a fast
break. And it broke the hearts of fans
everywhere.
The one glowing bright spot was
during the 2006-07 season, when
Celtics great (seriously, look it up) and
coaching legend Don Nelson returned
to the helm of the team he once cap
tained to perfection (except for run
ning Chris Webber out of town, but I
digress).
Like a riverboat gambler who
knows he has pocket aces up his
sleeve, the mad genius in Nelson
shipped a pu pu platter of expiring
contracts to pry Stephen Jackson, A1
Harrington and Baron Davis from
then' respective teams, pairing these
established head cases with consum
mate professional Jason Richardson
and developing star Monta Ellis.
What ensued was one of the great
est stretch runs in the long, storied
history of the NBA: the Warriors rat
tled off huge, clutch wins in must-win
games for weeks on end, finally
sneaking into the playoffs and draw
ing (as the eighth seed) the top
ranked Dallas Mavericks.
With all sorts of noise records bro
ken as a delirious Oracle Arena
embraced the moment they had wait
ed for over so many terrible years, the
Warriors, swaggering around with a
swagger that swaggered its way into
their very being, knocked the Maver
icks fi - om the playoffs, leading to one
of the all-time most awkward MVP
trophy presentations when Dirk
Nowitzki accepted a regular season
MVP award after having been
bounced from the postseason.
Then came "the posterization:"
Baron Davis over Andrei Kir
ilenko in a move that nearly
caused Oakland to explode.
But when the Dubs finally lost
to the superior Utah Jazz,
another cold spell was born
and the team began to
implode.
First, Baron Davis made it
his goal to eat his weight in
cheeseburgers in the offsea
son; after a short time, he fled
Oakland like a murderer flee
ing the scene of a crime, begin
ning a quest to play for every
team in the NBA for just a few
weeks at a time.
Then Monta Ellis crashed
his scooter, destroying his
ankle and causing the War
riors ownership to threaten
him with voiding his contract.

structed, with a specific identi
ty: no more Nellieball, no more
small ball, no more gimmicks.
Now, the team is built
around a transcendental point
guard with unlimited range
(Steph Curry whose only flaw
might be ankles made of
glass); a big, hulking, sweet
passing, shot-blocking center
(Andrew Bogut, whose beard
makes him look like a giant
from the Lord of the Rings);
and an array of capable scor
ers, defenders and supporting
cast members (Klay Thomp
son, Harrison Barnes, Jarret
Jack, Carl Landry... the list
goes on and on).
Finally, a team, in the
truest sense of the word.
As I watch this current
Warriors team thrive in the
face of adversity I can't help
but consider the preceding his
tory and think of the unlikeli
hood of it all. We haven't even
talked about the immortal PJ
Carlesimo and his wringable
neck or Don Nelson's quest to
get fired by shamelessly tank
ing left, right and center. What
are the odds that, in year two
of new ownership, the War
riors finally find an identity
and run with it?

Then the Dubs front office
decided to reward Andris
Biedrins with a luxurious con
tract and watched in horror as
he proceeded to forget how to
dribble, shoot, rebound or
make more than one out of
every 100 free throws. All the
while, Chris Cohan fattened
his purse and waited for the
perfect time to sell.
And then came the turning
point. When Joe Lacob and his
ownership group purchased
the Warriors, they not only
swept out the third-most hated
owner in all of sports, they also
ushered in an era of hope.
Despite some hiccups along
the way (i.e. trading Monta
Ellis, a fan favorite, which I
maintain was the smartest
move that could have been
made at the time), the team
has been thoroughly recon-

The old Warriors fit a per
fect archetype: undersized,
flashy all offense, no defense,
the lovable losers of the NBA,
a team that just could not catch

a break. They lost because
they were constructed to
entertain, not to win. They
were built to satisfy fans, sell t
shirts and put up huge num
bers in lieu of actually winning
games. They, in short, existed
as Chris Cohan's personal cash
cow, which he milked for all it
was worth. All that changed
with the Lacob Liquidation, a
polar reversal of outlooks and
desires. The Warriors no
longer needed to be the cheap
est roster around or the most
offensively constructed. They
no longer had to pander to the
casual crowd or chase mean
ingless numbers in the
absence of victories.
These Warriors have one
goal and one goal only: win.
These Warriors are made of
sterner stuff: they shoot threes,
play good D, hustle around,
jump around and otherwise live
in the moment. The breaks
they get are of their own mak
ing. The NBA should be on
high alert: the Dubs are back.

might be ankles made of
glass); a big, hulking, sweet
passing, shot-blocking center
(Andrew Bogut, whose beard
makes him look like a giant

and an array of capable scor
ers, defenders and supporting
cast members (Klay Thomp
son, Harrison Barnes, Jarret

goes on and on).
Finally, a team, in the
truest sense of the word.
As I watch this current
Warriors team thrive in the
face of adversity I can't help
but consider the preceding his
tory and think of the unlikeli
hood of it all. We haven't even
talked about the immortal PJ
Carlesimo and his wringable
neck or Don Nelson's quest to
get fired by shamelessly tank
ing left, right and center. What
are the odds that, in year two
of new ownership, the War
riors finally find an identity
and run with it?

Then the Dubs front office
decided to reward Andris
Biedrins with a luxurious con
tract and watched in horror as
he proceeded to forget how to
dribble, shoot, rebound or
make more than one out of
every 100 free throws. All the
while, Chris Cohan fattened
his purse and waited for the
perfect time to sell.
And then came the turning
point. When Joe Lacob and his
ownership group purchased
the Warriors, they not only
swept out the third-most hated
owner in all of sports, they also
ushered in an era of hope.
Despite some hiccups along
the way (i.e. trading Monta
Ellis, a fan favorite, which I
maintain was the smartest
move that could have been
made at the time), the team
has been thoroughly recon-

The old Warriors fit a per
fect archetype: undersized,
flashy all offense, no defense,
the lovable losers of the NBA,
a team that just could not catch

a break. They lost because
they were constructed to
entertain, not to win. They
were built to satisfy fans, sell t
shirts and put up huge num
bers in lieu of actually winning
games. They, in short, existed
as Chris Cohan's personal cash
cow, which he milked for all it
was worth. All that changed
with the Lacob Liquidation, a
polar reversal of outlooks and
desires. The Warriors no
longer needed to be the cheap
est roster around or the most
offensively constructed. They
no longer had to pander to the
casual crowd or chase mean
ingless numbers in the
absence of victories.
These Warriors have one
goal and one goal only: win.
These Warriors are made of
sterner stuff: they shoot threes,
play good D, hustle around,
jump around and otherwise live
in the moment. The breaks
they get are of their own mak
ing. The NBA should be on
high alert: the Dubs are back.

I stalled watching the Warriors
nearly nine years ago, mainly
because there was nothing else
on TV to watch. Those were the
good old days, with superstars
like Thoy Murphy, Adonal Foyle and
Mike Dunleavy putting up great num
bers and managing to lose nearly all of
their games.
Under the wise and able guidance
of renowned owner Chris Cohan
(sense the sarcasm?), the Warriors
put up spectacular bottom lines (prof
its, not box scores), alienated one of
the greatest fan bases in existence
today, sold a ton of t-shirts, butchered
draft picks, sold more t-shirts, hiked
up season ticket prices to hitherto
unforeseen heights and sold even
more t-shirts.

In short, they were like the Oak
land Raiders, only without A1 Davis
running the show. Although many
would argue that is a good thing, at
least A1 Davis cared about winning;
his catchphrase was "Just Win, Baby."
With Chris Cohan, about the only
thing you were guaranteed was the
cheapest roster possible. His catch
phrase might have been "Kaching."
Why watch this team then, you
might ask. Why put yourself through
the pain of a team destined for noth
ing more than mediocrity? Why suffer
the whims of a multimillionaire owner
pinching pennies in order to expand
his ever-growing coffers?
I guess first it was the throwback
jerseys. The classic retro, blue-and
gold embossed unis with "The City"
proudly emblazoned on their fronts
were (and still are) some of the great
est uniforms that can be had. (Please
this excuse this small interruption as
your author rushes to Ebay.com to get
a dirt-cheap Patrick O'Bryant jersey.
You can even take this time to look up
Patrick O'Bryant on Google and find
out exactly how badly the Dubs
screwed him.)
But more than that, there was
always something about how much
people cared about the Warriors.
Casual fans and diehard nuts alike
would always be talking about how
this was the year, about how the latest
coaching hire (hello, Mike Mont
gomery) or the latest draft pick (hello,
Brandan Wright and Anthony Ran
dolph) or the latest D-League discov
ery (hello, Kelenna Azubuike) would
bring the team to the cusp of the play
offs, a height last reached in the clas
sic "Run TMC" days starring Mitch
Richmond, Chris Mullin and Tim
Hardaway.
But invariably, the opposite would
occur. Mike Montgomery went down
in flames, taking the fate of Stanford
basketball with him for a few years,
and then had the temerity to go coach
at that other school across the Bay.
Brandan Wright couldn't sniff the
starting lineup; Anthony Randolph
combined incredible athleticism with
incredibly boneheaded basketball
mistakes (a la Javale McGee today).
Kelenna Azubuike, for a time,
remained my favorite Warriors play
er, an impossibly sculpted, soft-spo
ken, tenacious basketball player who
eventually succumbed to a torn ACL.

The Warriors couldn't seem to
catch a break, much less run a fast
break. And it broke the hearts of fans
everywhere.
The one glowing bright spot was
during the 2006-07 season, when
Celtics great (seriously, look it up) and
coaching legend Don Nelson returned
to the helm of the team he once cap
tained to perfection (except for run
ning Chris Webber out of town, but I
digress).
Like a riverboat gambler who
knows he has pocket aces up his
sleeve, the mad genius in Nelson
shipped a pu pu platter of expiring
contracts to pry Stephen Jackson, A1
Harrington and Baron Davis from
then' respective teams, pairing these
established head cases with consum
mate professional Jason Richardson
and developing star Monta Ellis.
What ensued was one of the great
est stretch runs in the long, storied
history of the NBA: the Warriors rat
tled off huge, clutch wins in must-win
games for weeks on end, finally
sneaking into the playoffs and draw
ing (as the eighth seed) the top
ranked Dallas Mavericks.
With all sorts of noise records bro
ken as a delirious Oracle Arena
embraced the moment they had wait
ed for over so many terrible years, the
Warriors, swaggering around with a
swagger that swaggered its way into
their very being, knocked the Maver
icks fi - om the playoffs, leading to one
of the all-time most awkward MVP
trophy presentations when Dirk
Nowitzki accepted a regular season
MVP award after having been
bounced from the postseason.
Then came "the posterization:"
Baron Davis over Andrei Kir
ilenko in a move that nearly
caused Oakland to explode.
But when the Dubs finally lost
to the superior Utah Jazz,
another cold spell was born
and the team began to
implode.
First, Baron Davis made it
his goal to eat his weight in
cheeseburgers in the offsea
son; after a short time, he fled
Oakland like a murderer flee
ing the scene of a crime, begin
ning a quest to play for every
team in the NBA for just a few
weeks at a time.
Then Monta Ellis crashed
his scooter, destroying his
ankle and causing the War
riors ownership to threaten
him with voiding his contract.

ty: no more Nellieball, no more
small ball, no more gimmicks.
Now, the team is built
around a transcendental point
guard with unlimited range
(Steph Curry whose only flaw
might be ankles made of
glass); a big, hulking, sweet
passing, shot-blocking center
(Andrew Bogut, whose beard
makes him look like a giant
from the Lord of the Rings);
and an array of capable scor
