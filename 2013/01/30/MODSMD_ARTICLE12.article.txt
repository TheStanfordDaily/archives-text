## Don't look now, but the Dubs are back 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
I stalled watching the Warriors
nearly nine years ago, mainly
because there was nothing else
on TV to watch. Those were the
good old days, with superstars
like Thoy Murphy, Adonal Foyle and
Mike Dunleavy putting up great num
bers and managing to lose nearly all of
their games.
Under the wise and able guidance
of renowned owner Chris Cohan
(sense the sarcasm?), the Warriors
put up spectacular bottom lines (prof
its, not box scores), alienated one of
the greatest fan bases in existence
today, sold a ton of t-shirts, butchered
draft picks, sold more t-shirts, hiked
up season ticket prices to hitherto
unforeseen heights and sold even
more t-shirts.

In short, they were like the Oak
land Raiders, only without A1 Davis
running the show. Although many
would argue that is a good thing, at
least A1 Davis cared about winning;
his catchphrase was "Just Win, Baby."
With Chris Cohan, about the only
thing you were guaranteed was the
cheapest roster possible. His catch
phrase might have been "Kaching."
Why watch this team then, you
might ask. Why put yourself through
the pain of a team destined for noth
ing more than mediocrity? Why suffer
the whims of a multimillionaire owner
pinching pennies in order to expand
his ever-growing coffers?
I guess first it was the throwback
jerseys. The classic retro, blue-and
gold embossed unis with "The City"
proudly emblazoned on their fronts
were (and still are) some of the great
est uniforms that can be had. (Please
this excuse this small interruption as
your author rushes to Ebay.com to get
a dirt-cheap Patrick O'Bryant jersey.
You can even take this time to look up
Patrick O'Bryant on Google and find
out exactly how badly the Dubs
screwed him.)
But more than that, there was
always something about how much
people cared about the Warriors.
Casual fans and diehard nuts alike
would always be talking about how
this was the year, about how the latest
coaching hire (hello, Mike Mont
gomery) or the latest draft pick (hello,
Brandan Wright and Anthony Ran
dolph) or the latest D-League discov
ery (hello, Kelenna Azubuike) would
bring the team to the cusp of the play
offs, a height last reached in the clas
sic "Run TMC" days starring Mitch
Richmond, Chris Mullin and Tim
Hardaway.
But invariably, the opposite would
occur. Mike Montgomery went down
in flames, taking the fate of Stanford
basketball with him for a few years,
and then had the temerity to go coach
at that other school across the Bay.
Brandan Wright couldn't sniff the
starting lineup; Anthony Randolph
combined incredible athleticism with
incredibly boneheaded basketball
mistakes (a la Javale McGee today).
Kelenna Azubuike, for a time,
remained my favorite Warriors play
er, an impossibly sculpted, soft-spo
ken, tenacious basketball player who
eventually succumbed to a torn ACL.

The Warriors couldn't seem to
catch a break, much less run a fast
break. And it broke the hearts of fans
everywhere.
The one glowing bright spot was
during the 2006-07 season, when
Celtics great (seriously, look it up) and
coaching legend Don Nelson returned
to the helm of the team he once cap
tained to perfection (except for run
ning Chris Webber out of town, but I
digress).
Like a riverboat gambler who
knows he has pocket aces up his
sleeve, the mad genius in Nelson
shipped a pu pu platter of expiring
contracts to pry Stephen Jackson, A1
Harrington and Baron Davis from
then' respective teams, pairing these
established head cases with consum
mate professional Jason Richardson
and developing star Monta Ellis.
What ensued was one of the great
est stretch runs in the long, storied
history of the NBA: the Warriors rat
tled off huge, clutch wins in must-win
games for weeks on end, finally
sneaking into the playoffs and draw
ing (as the eighth seed) the top
ranked Dallas Mavericks.
With all sorts of noise records bro
ken as a delirious Oracle Arena
embraced the moment they had wait
ed for over so many terrible years, the
Warriors, swaggering around with a
swagger that swaggered its way into
their very being, knocked the Maver
icks fi - om the playoffs, leading to one
of the all-time most awkward MVP
trophy presentations when Dirk
Nowitzki accepted a regular season
MVP award after having been
bounced from the postseason.
Then came "the posterization:"
