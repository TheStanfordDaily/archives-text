# CARD RESHUFFLED
## COACHING TRIO PROMOTED 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Confirming speculations that
the open offensive coordinator
position would be an internal hire,
head coach David Shaw officially
announced on Tuesday that cur
rent run-game coordinator Mike
Bloomgren will take over as Stan
ford football's new Andrew Luck
Director of Offense.
The former offensive line coach
will be replacing Pep Hamilton,
who reunited with quarterback
Andrew Luck'l2 in the NFL by
accepting the offensive coordinator
role with the Indianapolis Colts.
"I'm very excited about elevat
ing Mike Bloomgren," Shaw said.
"He was the only choice. We didn't
interview anybody else, and we
didn't want to interview anyone
else."

Bloomgren has developed Stan
ford's offensive line into an elite
unit the past two years. Led by Ail-
Americans David DeCastro'l2 and
Jonathan Martin'l2 in 2011, the
group provided exceptional pass
protection for Luck, who had a
completion percentage of 70 per
cent and was only sacked 11 times
all season.

This past year, the offensive
line consisted of five starters who
earned All-Pac-12 honors, includ
ing 2012 Morris Trophy winner

junior offensive guard David
Yankey. The Tunnel Workers
Union paved the way for senior
running back Stepfan Taylor, the
all-time Stanford rushing leader
who averaged nearly 110 yards per
game.

"[Bloomgren] has done an out
standing job with our offensive line
and run game, though he's more
than an offensive line coach," said
Shaw. "He understands our
offense and how diverse we need to
be to attack defenses. We hope to
continue the success we've had on
offense, while also improving in
many areas, and Mike is the right
guy to lead us to our goals."
Former running backs coach
Mike Sanford, in his third year on
the Farm, will oversee the Cardi
nal quarterbacks and wide
receivers while maintaining his
role as the recruiting coordinator.
"The last two years, Mike San
ford has done a great job with our
running backs," Shaw commented.
"Now I am able to move him back
to his natural position in the pass
ing game ... He has worked with
our quarterbacks and wide
receivers in ball-handling and pro
tections. Now he will do a great job
working with me to continue devel
oping our passing game."
Sanford will be handing his
running back coaching duties to
former Stanford quarterback Tavi

ta Pritchard'lo, who served as a
defensive assistant for defensive
coordinator Derek Mason the last
two years. Pritchard most famous
ly led the 41-point underdog Cardi
nal to a stunning 24-23 upset of No.
2 USC in 2007.

In his second year in that role,
Pritchard contributed to the turn
around of the Cardinal secondary
in 2012, as safeties Ed Reynolds
and Jordan Richards combined for
nine interceptions. The proficiency
with which they read the quarter
back's eyes this season has often

been linked to Pritehard.
"Tavita Pritehard is one of the
brightest young coaches I have
ever been around," Shaw said. "He
has been phenomenal helping
Derek Mason on defense. He was
instrumental to the turnaround of
our program when he was our
starting quarterback and a team
leader. I'm excited to have him
back on our offense coaching the
running backs."
