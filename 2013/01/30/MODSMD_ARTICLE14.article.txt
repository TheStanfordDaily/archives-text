# DUCKS LAND ON FARM
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Flying high after throttling
Utah on Sunday evening, the men's
basketball team faces its most
important game of the season to
date tonight as the Card welcomes
No. 10 Oregon to Maples Pavilion.
Road losses to USC and UCLA,
coupled with a home loss to Wash
ington put Stanford (12-8, 3-4 Pac
-12) in a sizeable hole to start Pac-12
play. An up-and-down preseason
also has failed to build the Cardi
nal's NCAA Tournament resume,
which likely means that in order for
Stanford to put on its dancing shoes
in March, it must either go on a
remarkable run in conference play
or win the Pac-12 Tournament.
The Ducks (18-2, 7-0), currently
leading the conference, present a
great opportunity for the Cardinal
to kick off just such a run with a
marquee win on a (somewhat)
national stage.
Recent history is not in Stan
ford's favor. You have to go back to
January of 2011 to find Stanford's
last win over a ranked opponent, an
upset of then-No. 17 Washington,
and the Card has lost four games in
a row against top-25 teams. The last
time Stanford beat a top-10 team
was 2008, and the last home upset of
a top-10 team came in 2007.
But as mighty as the Ducks are
on paper, riding a nine-game win
ning streak and undefeated in
league play, they are plenty of rea
sons for Stanford to be hopeful that
tonight is the night to spring an
upset.

The Ducks have been living dan
gerously for most of the season on
the offensive end, averaging a con
ference-worst 15.7 turnovers per

contest. Their last six wins have
come by an average of only 5.0
points, and while they shot 57.8 per
cent from the field, they committed
a season-high 23 turnovers in an 81-
76 win over Washington on Satur
day.

Oregon head coach Dana Alt
man acknowledges that his team is
far from perfect. "The turnovers
really took away from the perform
ance," Altman said of his team's
effort against the Huskies. "We
made a lot of bad decisions, things
that we're going to have to work
on."

In contrast, Stanford finally put
together all the pieces for 40 min
utes in its last performance, a 31-
point rout of the Utes on the road
over the weekend. Junior forward
John Gage continued his white-hot
shooting, hitting all four of his
three-point attempts to make it
eight-straight over two games, on
his way to a career-high 19 points

The rest of the team was not far
behind, as Stanford shot 50 percent
from the field with 17 assists. Soph
omore guard Chasson Randle kept
up his scoring spree, chipping in 17
points as he continues to climb back
from his early-season shooting
straggles over his last six games
Randle is averaging 16 points.
And that leaves out the strong
play of junior forward Dwight Pow
ell. An All-Pac-10 All-Freshman
selection in 2011, Powell is finally
fully healthy and has been able to
showcase the dynamic and athletic
all-around game that made him a
blue-chip recruit coming out of high
school. In addition to averaging 14.5
points and 7.7 rebounds, Powell is
shooting 47.7 percent overall and
80.4 percent from the foul line.
The problem against the Ducks

will likely come on the defensive
end, however, as E.J Singler,
younger brother of former Duke
star and current Detroit Pistons
player Kyle Singler, is scoring buck
ets in bunches as one of five players
averaging in double digits.
Oregon also is committed to
pounding the glass on both ends, as
Arsalan Kazemi has pulled down 11
rebounds in each of his last three

games and is averaging 9.6 boards

per game.
Part of what made Stanford so
successful against Utah was its 43-
27 rebounding advantage, a big
improvement over the team's previ
ous league contests. The Card had a
minus-1.4 rebound differential in
conference play before Sunday
Oregon leads the Pac-12 in that cat
egory at plus-8.9 boards per game.

Junior forward Josh Huestis (24) scored 13 points and grabbed seven
rebounds in Stanford's comfortable victory over Utah on Sunday,
but the team faces tougher competition in No. 10 Oregon tonight.
