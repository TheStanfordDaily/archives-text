# BACK ON TRACK

### ANNA BLUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Not too far into the so-called "Miltenberg Era," the
Cardinal has already made an intimidating impression,
demonstrating its potential for the spring. This past week
end, the men and women returned to the 307-feet
unbanked Dempsey Track at the University of Washington
in Seattle where they had so easily dominated two weeks
earlier. Whereas it was the Stanford accomplishments in
the distance races that made headlines last time, this time
the Cardinal success in the field events was the story to
tell.

The biggest results were from senior high jumper Jules
Sharpe, sophomore pole-vaulter Katie Zingheim and sen
ior long jumper Karynn Dunn. Sharpe notably pulled off
Stanford's only first-place finish with a remarkable season
best of 7'1.5", towering over most in his field.
Especially looking ahead to outdoor season, Stanford
head coach Chris Miltenberg expects the high jump to be

Stanford senior Jules Sharpe (above) won the high jump event at the University of
Washington Invitational this past weekend, clearing a height of 7'1.5" and recording
the team's only first-place finish.
one of the biggest ways for
the Cardinal to score points.
Zingheim and Dunn both
finished in the ever-frustrat
ing second place, but sealed
their tickets to one of the
biggest meets of the indoor
season: the Husky Classic.
Dunn hopes to continue her
reign after her fourth-place
finish in the high jump at the
2012 NCAA Indoor Champi
onships.
Stanford had to fight
harder for its race wins this
time, facing solid competi

tion from fellow Pac-12 con
tenders UCLA and Oregon.
The Ducks' distance
strength has yet to fail
them, with first place finish
es in the women's 800 meter
and distance medley. In
addition, they swept both
the men's and women's
4x400 meter relay, with
times of 3:10.83 and 3:40.09,
respectively.
After this meet, though,
Oregon's hold on women's
event titles is less certain:
the Stanford 4x400 team, led
by senior sprinter Joy
O'Hare and junior sprinter
Kori Carter, finished not far
behind with 3:46.03. Carter,
the defending Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation champi
on, finished barely second
behind unattached Sasha Wal
lace in her first 60-meter hur
dles race of the season.

After finishing the race in
8.24 seconds, Carter was
elated, saying, "I actually
got a good start, which nev
er happens, so I was
pumped through the finish."
In her collegiate 400-
meter debut, freshman
sprinter Kristyn Williams
put on an amazing show with
third-place finish behind
senior Jordan Carlson of
Washington and senior Ali
ma Kamara of California in
the invitational race.
The men's sprinters, on
the other hand, have strug
gled as they've been plagued
by losses and injuries. The
absence of freshman Olympian
sprinter Steven Solomon,
possibly out for the rest of the
season with injury, has hin
dered the team's ability to
put together consistent
relays. The Cardinal has
also sorely missed the

national championship expe
rience of senior middle dis
tance runner Dylan Ferris,
the lone returning 2012 Ail-
American for the team.

Despite the inconsisten
cy, Miltenberg continues to
emphasize the importance of
establishing a routine. Jun
ior captain distance runner
Jessica Tonn, right after a
speedy finish of 9:10 in the
3k invitational race,
explained, "[As a team,] we
haven't done a lot of speed
work. We've mainly been
building anaerobically."

The distance men did not
let the fact that they were
often competing with experi
enced professionals affect
their performances in the
highly prestigious invitation
al races. Experienced sopho
more distance writer Luke
Lefebure definitely can't
complain after running an
800-meter time of 1:51.34,
three seconds longer than
the all-time meet record for
the event. He crossed the
line after two professionals
and an Oregon racer, similar
ly to senior captain sprinter
Spencer Chase's dramatic
finish in the open 400 with a
season best of 49.27.
This weekend the team
will travel to the Armory in
New York City and hope to
take advantage of a rare
chance to run against East
Coast competitors. There are
only four more weeks left
until the USA Track and Field
Championships, and even
though the Cardinal is still not
ready, after this past week
end, it is one giant step clos
er.
