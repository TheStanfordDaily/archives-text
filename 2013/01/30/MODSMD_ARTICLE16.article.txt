## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN A 						Stanford education and social engagement 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Alex Bayer's excellent piece on the
humanities' role in a college educa
tion brought to mind this column,
originally published April 30, 2012.

The purpose of a university
education can sometimes
seem a self-evident truth, on
par with life, liberty and the fact
that Cal sucks. The modern univer
sity, after all, obviously exists to
promote learning and instill knowl
edge, to equip its students with a
set of technical skills and to provide
a safe, open space in which the
intellect may thrive and develop.
But might intellectual goals
alone constitute too narrow a
vision, too humble an ambition, too
timid an aspiration for a university
that has always dreamed of better?
In a landmark 1837 speech to
Harvard's Phi Beta Kappa Society,
Ralph Waldo Emerson famously
defined the "American Scholar" as
a man of energetic action as well as
nuanced and advanced intellect.
Emerson urged each student to
become more than what he called a
"mere thinker" to become some
thing larger than the accumulated
library of his inner knowledge, to
mold each man's being into some
thing greater than the sum of his
intellectual parts. The great Amer
ican thinker and poet concluded
with his now-famous assertion that
"character is higher than intellect"
that the scholar's mind is not his
only implement, not even his defin
ing one.

Emerson understood the dis
tinction between mind and soul and
knew that a finely honed intellect
could flourish in men and women of
empty spirit. But he had higher
aspirations for the American uni
versity; Emerson had the audacity
to dream of a curriculum that
shaped its students into complete
moral beings, rather than mere
soulless vehicles for the transmis
sion and acquisition of knowledge.
In his wonderful essay "The
Disparity between Intellect and
Character," Harvard professor
Robert Coles tells the story of a
brilliant moral philosophy student
who treated his housekeeper, a fel
low undergraduate at Harvard
forced to clean rooms to pay her
way through school, with the same
respect he might give the trash she
picked up. One day this young
woman entered Coles' office in
tears. "I've been taking all these
philosophy courses, and we talk
about what's true, what's impor
tant, what's good ," she cried.
"Well, how do you teach people to
be good?"

Coles knew, as did Emerson,
that the disparity between intellect
and character can be mapped onto
the distinction between thought
and action that what one has
inside the head matters much less
than what one does with it. This is
not a new or original idea
indeed, it amounts to scarcely more
than the old adage that actions
speak louder than words.
But ought a university, in fact,
teach people to "be good"? How
can we teach each student to pur
sue what John Rawls termed her
"conception of the good" without
imposing a standardized, cookie
cutter picture of what that good
looks like?

As we argue about the perils
and benefits of social engagement
inside the classroom, I have to
admit that I don't know the answer.
But I do know that there is a role
for the modern university in wed
ding the power of the rigorous
mind to the wisdom that comes
with moral character.

In his 1957 classic, "Flowers for
Algernon," Daniel Keyes tells the
heartbreaking story of Charlie
Gordon, a mentally disabled man
who undergoes an experimental
procedure to increase his IQ. We
are introduced to a Charlie whose
problem-solving skills are inferior
to those of Algernon, a mouse in the
lab. Soon, Charlie's mind outstrips
that of the doctors who engineered
his transformation.

But he is no happier, no more
secure, no friendlier. Charlie's
being is no more morally valuable
than it was before the surgery; his
newly powerful intellect serves
only to give him a clearer apprecia
tion of the faults and foibles of
humankind. As he stands before
the group of intellectually brilliant
but morally empty scientists who
made him who he is, Charlie finally
shouts, "There's one thing you've
all overlooked: intelligence and
education that hasn't been tem
pered by human affection isn't
worth a damn."
Stanford has always been a
school of doers, of men and women
of action and energy employed in
the service of visible achievement.
The "College of the West," David
Starr Jordan wrote in 1904, is home
to no "dewy-eyed monk," no "stoop
shouldered grammarian." The true
Stanford scholar is the "leader of
enterprise, the builder of states."
As we pursue Jordan's vision,
let's not forget the words of Emer
son, Coles and Keyes. We have
work to do.
