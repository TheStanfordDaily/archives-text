# SITTIN' ON THE JOHN
## Lost at night, hungover in the morning 
### John Murray 
For all the attention given to
Friday and Saturday nights
the sporting events, din
ners out with friends, various par
ties of various sizes I still consid
er my favorite moment of the week
to be Sunday morning, when I wake
up, typically sleep-deprived and
occasionally still feeling the effects
of my beverage consumption from
the night before.
Sure, the physiological effects of
being tired and hungover can be a
bit uncomfortable. But to me,
there's always been something very
spiritual about those Sunday morn
ings, periods of time that often go
unheralded in the college scene.
They are moments of minimalism,

devoid of the noise of a Friday or
Saturday night, but also devoid of
any need for such noise.
There's a certain silent apathy
that hangs over most Sunday morn
ings: in stark contrast to the previ
ous few nights, there are no more
people. (Seriously, there is never
anyone around on Sunday morn
ing.) They're probably just at the
library or out getting food, but I
never actually see any of them leave
the house. I simply wake up, and
poof everyone's gone. The house is
empty, and it's fine. There's no need
for hellos or goodbyes on a Sunday
morning. No one to meet up with, to
make small talk with. No one to con
nect with, and no need to connect
with anyone.
There is no music on Sunday
mornings. No more alcohol, politics,
sex, food. There's no need for any of
these things, either: no one to impress,
no one to hit on, no song choices to be
made, no dinner plans to worry about,
no cameras to pose for.
It's a mostly welcome sight. After
a weekend of high Shakespearean
social drama, B AC-measured
escapism, endless laughter, gram
matically incoherent text messages,
many bodies being pressed up
against other bodies and a lot of
shitty, shitty beer, a morning of
silence is practically enlightening.
There's no need for clothes on
most Sunday mornings. Wake, rise,
shower, put on a pair of boxers and
I'm ready for a comatose day of
sofa. Fiddle with my homework,
look out the window for long peri
ods of time, waiting for some sort of
cinematic epiphany. "Arrested
Development" reruns: bliss.
I am always reminded of the
brief moment in "The Sun Also Ris
es" when Hemingway's protago
nist, Jake Barnes, finally departs
the chaotic fiesta at Pamplona for
an intended few days of rest alone
in San Sebastian, leaving behind a
mess of emotions, scores of inter
personal drama and a few dead
bulls. It is a fleeting instance of lit
eral and metaphorical escape from
the Lost Generation trauma that

haunts most of the novel's charac
ters; it is a cleansing relief. In some
ways, I feel as though the typical
collegiate weekend follows a similar
cycle: suffocating uproar followed
by hollowed silence, howling adoles
cence fading into seventh-day
rebirth.
Because I have concerns about
Friday and Saturday. I wonder
about alcohol, and why many of us,
myself included, feel more comfort
able and connected after a few
drinks. I wonder about the kind of
ways in which we measure our
selves, the colossal pressures under
which we continue to crush each
other. I wonder about the puritani
cal secrecy of it all, the great fear
we have of potential employers
stumbling upon our Facebook pho
tos and discovering that we, indeed,
really are just kids looking for con
nection and escapism in a modern
collegiate and social culture that
bombards us with endless opportu
nities and expectations. I wonder if
I look good, or if God is real.
On Friday and Saturday nights,
I worry about girls, and about my
friends, and about whether I'll ever
be married or have kids or be suc
cessful or enlightened. I worry
about taking funny photos, and then
I worry about what it means that so
many of our needs for social connec
tivity are filled via newsfeeds and
photo albums. God. I could have
been an engineer.
But on Sunday, I'm fine. Alone,
empty, fully alive in the silent noth
ingness of it all. I wonder if I sound
whiny? Probably.
It's sad, really Jake Barnes
spends less than a day in San
Sebastian before he must return to
the side of Lady Brett Ashley, one
of the most destructive femme
fatales of modern English litera
ture. And so the next Friday rolls
around. But that just means we're
only a few days from Sunday, right?
It's pretty to think so, at least.

This Friday night, and any night,
really, John would love to hear from
you atjhmurray@stanford.edu.

eral and metaphorical escape from
the Lost Generation trauma that

haunts most of the novel's charac
ters; it is a cleansing relief. In some
ways, I feel as though the typical
collegiate weekend follows a similar
cycle: suffocating uproar followed
by hollowed silence, howling adoles
cence fading into seventh-day
rebirth.
Because I have concerns about
Friday and Saturday. I wonder
about alcohol, and why many of us,
myself included, feel more comfort
able and connected after a few
drinks. I wonder about the kind of
ways in which we measure our
selves, the colossal pressures under
which we continue to crush each
other. I wonder about the puritani
cal secrecy of it all, the great fear
we have of potential employers
stumbling upon our Facebook pho
tos and discovering that we, indeed,
really are just kids looking for con
nection and escapism in a modern
collegiate and social culture that
bombards us with endless opportu
nities and expectations. I wonder if
I look good, or if God is real.
On Friday and Saturday nights,
I worry about girls, and about my
friends, and about whether I'll ever
be married or have kids or be suc
cessful or enlightened. I worry
about taking funny photos, and then
I worry about what it means that so
many of our needs for social connec
tivity are filled via newsfeeds and
photo albums. God. I could have
been an engineer.
But on Sunday, I'm fine. Alone,
empty, fully alive in the silent noth
ingness of it all. I wonder if I sound
whiny? Probably.
It's sad, really Jake Barnes
spends less than a day in San
Sebastian before he must return to
the side of Lady Brett Ashley, one
of the most destructive femme
fatales of modern English litera
ture. And so the next Friday rolls
around. But that just means we're
only a few days from Sunday, right?
It's pretty to think so, at least.

This Friday night, and any night,
really, John would love to hear from
you atjhmurray@stanford.edu.
