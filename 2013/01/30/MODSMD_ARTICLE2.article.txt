# Depts. submit courses for new GERs
## 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
About 390 courses have already been reg
istered to qualify for credit under the new
Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing general
education requirements (GERs), which will
take effect starting with the Class of 2017.
The Ways requirements will replace both
the Disciplinary Breadth and Education for
Citizenship GERs, in accordance with the
suggestions of the Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES). The Faculty
Senate approved the new requirements last
May.

According to Christopher Edwards, chair
of the breadth governance board (BGB) that
created the new requirements, almost all
departments and programs have responded
to the requirement to register courses under

the new program. Edwards suggested that
departments or programs looking to register
existing courses should do so by the end of
this winter quarter.

"That will allow us to see where we need
additional [course] offerings," Edwards
wrote in an emailed statement from Cape
Town.

While the degree of crossover between
Thinking Matters, the new freshman
requirement, and the Ways requirement has
yet to be finalized, Associate Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Sharon Palmer
'9O expressed hope that many of the courses
developed would fulfill both requirements.
Palmer emphasized that the Ways
requirement would not change the Thinking
Matters program or its course composition.
"Thinking Matters is an ongoing require

ment, and [the Class of 2016] is the anom
alous one [they] have the old breadth sys
tem and the new Thinking Matters," Palmer
said. "The next class will have the new
breadth system and the new Thinking Mat
ters as well."

According to Edwards and Palmer,
departments will be able to collaborate on
classes to fulfill the new requirements. Alter
nately, departments can also opt to offer
courses for non-majors that apply that
department's specific insight to a category of
the requirement.
"In the old system, for example, you
might have had to take a math or statistics
class, but now, a student might fulfill a formal
reasoning class with mathematics or statis
tics, but can also take a logic class or a com
puter science class," Palmer said.

However, Edwards stressed that the new
Ways requirement is not intended to further
the goal of facilitating interdisciplinary stud
ies.

"This is not about being interdisciplinary
although that is often a good thing," he
wrote.

Classes eligible for the Ways require
ments will fall under eight categories: Aes
thetic and Interpretive Inquiry, Social
Inquiry, Scientific Analysis, Formal Reason
ing, Quantitative Reasoning, Engaging Dif
ference, Moral and Ethical Reasoning and
Creative Expression. Students will have to
take a total of 11 eligible courses to fulfill the
requirement.
