# STUDENT LIFE
## WebDev class focuses on practical skills 
### JUSTINE MOORE STAFF WRITER 
When Kingston Tam 'l3, co-president
of Stanford Design Initiative (SDI), sur
veyed students on the SDI mailing list
about what technical skills they would like
to learn, he was surprised to find that
almost all of the 100 respondents gave the
same response: web design.
Tam shared the results of the survey
with his friends Charlie Guo 'l3 and Kevin
Xu 'l3, who share his passion for web
development. The three began to discuss
the possibility of creating their own infor
mal course to fulfill student demand for
learning web development skills and to fill
a gap they saw in Stanford's Computer
Science (CS) Department.
"We see ourselves as unique in the CS
Department as we really like building
things for the web," Xu said. "People just
kept asking us to teach them how to build
things."

After a month of planning, Cardinal
WebDev was born. Held in the Arrillaga
Wellness Room, the class is independent

from the University. The 35 enrolled stu
dents are not given course credit and do
not receive a grade at the end of the
course. Students are often shown live cod
ing and then given time to experiment with
their own projects or solve quick chal
lenges in class. The last half of the nine
week course will be focused on final proj
ects that the students create, a testament
to the founders' "learning by doing" phi
losophy.
According to Tarn, the highly interac
tive nature of the course differentiates it
from the average class offered by the CS
department.
"It's focused on how you set up your
own project and get started from nothing,
and I think that's something that a lot of
CS classes lack nowadays," Tarn said.
Anjney Midha 'l5, who is currently
enrolled in the course, said that the practi
cal rather than theoretical focus is one of
the most appealing aspects of Cardinal
WebDev. Midha was one of the select few
allowed to enroll in Cardinal WebDev; over
80 percent of the applicants were turned
away.

"I would say that it is probably one of
the most enjoyable and applicable classes I
have taken," Midha said. "The lectures are
accompanied by actual coding labs so it is
going on simultaneously, and I've never
had that experience. I would love to see
that in more Stanford classes."
Over 200 students applied for the
course, which Xu credits to the fact that
each of the three founders has extensive
experience with web design. Guo is the co
founder of Class Owl, Tam is the co-presi
dent of the Stanford Design Initiative and
Xu is the Chief Branding Officer of the
Business Association of Stanford Entre
preneurial Students (BASES).
"It was more or less our clout on cam
pus that made it so popular," Xu said.
"When we first put up a website, people
were like, 'These people together are
teaching a class?"'
Midha said he was drawn to the course
during his search for a hands-on introduc
tion to web development, which he said he
could not find in Stanford's official course

Members of the student-run web design class Cardinal WebDev watch as Kevin Xu '13 teaches students how to develop their
own websites through tutorials and in-class projects. Over 200 students applied for the course, which was capped at 40.
