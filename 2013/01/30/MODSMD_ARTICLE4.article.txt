## Judicial Affairs board approves changes to ARP 
### OLIVIA MOORE STAFF WRITER 
At the ASSU Senate's Jan. 29 meeting, Senator
Lauren Miller 'l5 announced that the Board of Judi
cial Affairs (BJA) had approved all of the Senate's
recommended changes to the Alternative Review
Process (ARP).
"The BJA was really great at taking all our revi
sions," Miller said. "They passed them all unanimous
ly, which was really exciting."
The Senate will vote at next week's meeting on a
bill to approve the enactment of the modified version
of the ARE If the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
and the Senate both approve the bill, the recommen
dations will be brought to the Faculty Senate at its
March meeting.
Senators also approved a bill to increase the max
imum allocation for the spring quarter grants pro
gram from $40,000 to $75,000 because of the high
number of applications received. The Senate received
36 applications from general fees student groups for
spring quarter events.
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen
Thisheim 'l3 encouraged senators to think carefully
about increasing the total grant allocation.
The Senate funds the grant program through its
buffer fund, which receives close to $lOO,OOO each
year from a 10% tax levied on students during the
special fees process. Trusheim, who received $35,000
from the ASSU buffer fund last year on behalf of
Stanford Concert Network's Frost Revival Concert,
reminded senators the additional disbursement
would constitute an even greater reduction in the
Senate's reserves, affecting the resources available
for similar programs in the future.
"It's well within what the Senate's done in the
past, but I just want you to think about this when you
vote about it," Trusheim told senators.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 advocated for the
increase to $75,000 under the condition that the Sen
ate reconsider the allocation amount in future years.
"I'm completely fine spending this now, but I think
we should keep in mind that it's a one-time thing,"
Bindra said. The Senate passed the bill unanimously.
The Appropriations Committee is currently
reviewing the 36 spring applications and plans to
notify grant recipients on Feb. 4. According to Appro
priations Committee Chair Nancy Pham 'l4, the total
amount requested by spring quarter grant groups
was almost $150,000.
"We haven't had a chance to meet up and review
all 36 as one batch," Pham said. "I would say it is
going to be more difficult [than reviewing the winter
grants] because there are more events."
This quarter, several Senate committees will
examine other possible uses for the Senate's large
buffer fund. A separate sub-committee focused on the
fund's use will begin meeting this week.
Senators unanimously
passed 14 funding bills allo
cating $14,079 to student
groups, including four
groups whose applications
for the winter grant program
had been rejected. Pham said
that the Appropriations
Committee attempted to help

rejected groups find alterna
tive funding for their event.
"For the most part, we
worked with all of the groups
and made sure that they
were okay with having the
event proceed with funding
from their discretionary gen
eral fees," Pham said. "We
still wanted the events to
happen, we just didn't do it
through the grant."
