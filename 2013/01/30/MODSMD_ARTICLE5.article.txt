## Chappe11 Lougee applications reach record high 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
Despite an earlier deadline, the
Chappell Lougee Scholarship
received a record number of appli
cations this year, exceeding last
year's high mark.
According to Christina Mesa, an
Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) academic director
and the scholarship's coordinator,
the program received 45 applica
tions by the Jan. 14 deadline. The

program, which offers grants worth
up to $6,000 for summer research
projects in the humanities or cre
ative arts, received nearly 40 appli
cations last year by a Feb. 1 dead
line.

In previous years, the deadline
for submitting applications was
Dec. 1. Mesa said that the new Jan
uary date was chosen to make it
easier for students to apply.
"I always felt bad about having
students turn in these proposals

right around finals," Mesa said.
"We had also thought about setting
the deadline to February, but it was
too close to the deadlines for apply
ing to major grants."
Melissa Stevenson '96, academic
director of Florence Moore Hall,
said that the earlier deadline moti
vated students to get a head start
on the application process.

"This was a deadline we knew
[about] very early in autumn quar
ter," Stevenson said. "Students that

were working on their projects
knew that... the bulk of their work
had to be done in autumn quarter
with some revision over winter
break."

The Chappell Lougee Scholar
ships were established in 1987 to
honor history professor and Struc
tured Liberal Education (SLE)
director Carolyn Chappell
Lougee's work as dean of under
graduate studies from 1982 to 1987.
The original funding came from

Stanford's Centennial Campaign
fundraising and the Chappell
Lougee family.
While Mesa hesitated to identify
definitive trends from the scholar
ship's relatively brief history, she
highlighted a recent shift in the
composition of the applicant pool.
"There seems to have been, in
my time reviewing, a boom in cre
ative writing proposals," Mesa said.
"I think that a lot of it may
have to do with outreach, but
I cannot say for sure."
In 2011, students put for
ward a considerable number
of proposals involving food
related issues, like research
into food distribution and
security, according to Mesa.
The 2012 Olympic Games in
London was also a popular
venue for applicants.
While this year's number
of awardees has yet to be

finalized, Mesa estimated
that "around half of the peo
ple who applied will be
awarded a grant, but this is a
very rough estimate."
The final number of
awardees, Mesa added, is
highly dependent on the
number of students who ulti
mately choose to turn down
the grants.
"It's something that hap
pens every year," Mesa said.
"Quite often, students get
funding from other sources,
especially their own depart
ments."
