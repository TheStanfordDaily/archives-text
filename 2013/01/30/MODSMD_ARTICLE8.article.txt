## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF —Alice Phillips 
Two environmental groups filed a lawsuit Tues
day against Stanford University for allegedly harm
ing the steelhead trout in the Searsville Dam Reser
voir in violation of the Endangered Species Act.

Our Children's Earth Foundation and the Eco
logical Rights Foundation filed the suit in federal
court in San Francisco.

In the suit, the parties say they want Stanford to
obtain an Endangered Species Act permit for
activity that harms any threatened or endan
gered species. They also seek to force Stanford to
reduce the amount of water it uses from the
reservoir and to develop a plan to assist fish in
bypassing the dam.

The National Marine Fisheries Service has
already started an investigation into any possible
violations at the Searsville dam.

University spokeswoman Lisa Lapin told the
San Mateo County Times that the University is not

harming the steelhead trout and therefore does not
need an Endangered Species Act permit.
"Stanford is definitively not in violation of the
Endangered Species Act in its operation of
Searsville Dam —in fact, the creek is a thriving
steelhead habitat," Lapin said.
