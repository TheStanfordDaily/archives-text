Stanford's Ho Center for Buddhist Studies and Stanford Continuing Studies Present
Understanding Buddhist Art:
Theravada Buddhist Arts of Mainland Southeast Asia
Saturday, February 2
1:00 - 4:00 pm
Annenberg Auditorium
Cummings Art Building
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
This seminar will introduce participants to the little discussed
Buddhist art and architecture of Laos, in particular the mural
paintings, textiles, and ephemeral ritual arts of Luang Prabang.
It will also address the role Theravada (and Socially Engaged
Buddhism) plays in the contemporary arts of Southeast Asia.
In the course of the seminar, we will explore questions such
as: How do artists integrate Theravada Buddhist philosophical
perspectives on materiality, ritual, space, and performance
into their practice? In what ways do socially engaged Buddhist
arts offer us alternative ways for thinking about political
movements and social communities?
Lecture given by Boreth Ly, Assistant Professor in History
of Art and Visual Culture, UC Santa Cruz.
