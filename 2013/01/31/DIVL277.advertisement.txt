The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation is looking for exceptional candidates to fill two

Customer Service
We're looking for outstanding individuals who take action, follow through, learn fast, make the tough call and inspire others. This
job comes with real challenges, great opportunities and a competitive salary with benefits (free meals, dental/health insurance,
paid vacation & holidays and more).
