## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY Everyone can be racist 
### Adam Johnson 
What is racism? The Oxford
English Dictionary defines
it as the "belief that all
members of each race possess char
acteristics, abilities, or qualities spe
cific to that race, especially so as to
distinguish it as inferior or superior
to other races." Under this defini
tion, white people can be racist,
black people can be racist anyone
can be racist, regardless of skin col
or.

Yet beginning in the 19605, this
definition was increasingly rejected;
scores of professors in ethnic studies
departments and law schools across
the nation have instead put forth a
new definition. For these scholars,
what the dictionaries define as
"racism" is considered "prejudice,"
and racism is equated to prejudice
plus power. This notion of "racism =
prejudice + power" surely has its
advantages its ability to explain
broader societal trajectories, for
instance. Yet some prominent
thinkers who begin with this defini
tion of racism ultimately conclude,
"only whites can be racist."
Reading a scholarly paper that
begins with the definition that
"racism = prejudice + power" and
concludes that "only whites can be
racist" is, to say the least, an inter
esting intellectual exercise. After
reading many of these papers, it
seems as if these scholars commit
the flaw of circular reasoning: they
assume what they need to prove
that only whites can be racist and
tailor the definition of power accord
ingly. While there is not enough
room here to extensively cover the
derivation, at the core of the argu
ment is the claim that only whites
have power. Thus, for these scholars,
an Arab state that degrades black
people is not an abuse of power, as
such a state falls under the broader
influence of white, Western hegemo
ny. And minorities, even the wealthi
est and/or most politically connected,
still remain powerless as white peo
ple established the system within
which they operate.

Not only do such notions of pow
er conflict with intuition, but this
linkage of "power" and "white" is
fundamentally flawed. While the his
tory and current state of white
supremacy and white privilege
should not be ignored, we should not
dismiss inter-minority relations as
either being powerless or emanating
from the white power structure. This
is especially true with foreign
nations. Although our world is now
linked in many complex ways, there
was a time when white people did
not exert influence over other soci
eties; non-white groups were at the
helms of power in such societies, and
it stands to reason that remnants of
these power structures remain in
place today.

Furthermore, while in the United
States whites may have more power
than minorities, it is obvious that
whites do not control all levers of
power. A black man is in the Oval
Office, two minorities are serving on
the Supreme Court, and roughly one
fifth of Fortune 500 CEOs are mem
bers of racial minority groups. If we

approach racism as something to be
avoided, we should ask which is
worse: a poor white man in Wiscon
sin who detests Asians, or a black
president who wishes to stop Asian
immigration because he perceives
Asians as, say, unfit to be Americans.
If we subscribe to the position that
only white people can be racist, it
necessarily follows that the Wiscon
sinite has more power than the black
president. This, however, is absurd
the black president has power
and is fully capable of being racist.
Besides these logical flaws, hold
ing that only white people can be
racist is detrimental to all races. It is
inherently divisive, framing the
struggle to attain power as whites
versus everyone else. It is also dis
empowering to minorities. By argu
ing that minorities have no power
with which to be racist, we forget
instances in which minorities clearly
do have power. My colleague Annie
Graham was guilty of this in a recent
op-ed. She began a column on abor
tion with "so these nine white guys
walk into a room," in reference to the
Roe v. Wade justices. Neglected in
her statement was the fact that one
of the nine justices, Thurgood Mar
shal, was black.
While I can only hypothesize
Annie's ultimate thoughts on race
relations, she has in all likelihood
been exposed to the leftist communi
ties at Stanford who advance the ide
ology that "only whites can be
racist." I myself was introduced to
that phrase at Stanford, and in my
time here I have heard it mentioned
many times. Its corollary that
every decision of consequence is
brought about "white guys in a
room" is also quite common. My
hope is that professors in the
humanities and social sciences are
not propagating this ideology, yet my
suspicion is that many are, or at the
very least are sympathetic to it.
By giving weight to the belief
that only whites can be racist, that
only white people have power, we are
not only being intellectually dishon
est and generating racial tension,
but beginning to forget the influence
that minorities have exercised in
guiding this and other nations.
Though by all means we should not
forget the struggles minorities have
faced, we should also refuse to
accept flawed and divisive ideology
that comes at the expense of reason
and equality.
