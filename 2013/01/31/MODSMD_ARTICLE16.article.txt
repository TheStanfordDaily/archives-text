## THE 						PERFECT BALANCE NO. 10 OREGON NO MATCH FOR STANFORD 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Maybe it was the announcing team of Brent
Musberger and Bill Walton. Perhaps it was the
rowdy student section overfilled with frats and
sororities that unexpectedly rolled out in force on
a Wednesday night. It's possible that Dwight
Powell, Josh Huestis and Aaron Bright simply ate
their Wheaties in addition to getting fresh hair
cuts.

Whatever the reason, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team put on a high-flying, hot-shooting,
highlight-reel worthy performance in a 76-52
rout of No. 10 Oregon at Maples Pavilion on
Wednesday night.
The Ducks (18-3, 7-1 Pac-12) had entered the
game on an eight-game winning streak, sitting
atop the conference, thanks to a strong offensive
attack and a knack for pulling out close victories.
Stanford (13-8,4-4) made sure there would be
no chance of Oregon pulling out another win by
taking the Ducks out of their game from start to
finish.

The effort certainly made coach Johnny
Dawkins happy. "I just thought it was a great
game," he said. "I thought our atmosphere was
terrific, you know, our student body, our band. I
just really thought it was a great atmosphere
for our guys to play in, and I thought our guys
really responded. So I think that combination of
having great support along with the way our
guys played inspired us this evening and made
for a fun game for us."
The Cardinal carried over the pure shooting
stroke it had displayed in Sunday night's 31-
point rout over Utah on the court against Ore
gon. Guards Chasson Randle and Aaron Bright
couldn't miss from behind the arc literally,
going 6-6 from downtown and combined for
29 points.
Inside, where Stanford had been wary of the

Ducks' size and aptitude for crashing the glass,
the Card again did not back down. Forwards
Josh Huestis and Dwight Powell had 13 boards
apiece, repeatedly boxing out well and snatch
ing rebounds on both the offensive and defen
sive ends of the floor.
"To be honest, I keep repeating it but just
that mindset that we were going to do whatev
er it takes [to win the battle on the glass]," Pow
ell said. "[Oregon's Tony] Woods and [Arsalan]
Kazemi were great rebounders, great offensive
rebounders, so just we went in with that aware
ness and tried to take them out as best as we
could. And the guards did a good job of boxing
them out and helping, so the balls, we were able
to get to them."
Most importantly, however, was the defen
sive effort for Stanford.
While the Ducks were missing their starting
point guard, Dominic Artis, due to injury, it
might not have mattered as the Cardinal's
defense was swarming from the opening tip.
Two steals in the first 94 seconds gave the stu
dent section some life, waving giant cutout
heads of UCLA legend Bill Walton, who was
announcing the game for ESPN, and Andrew
Luck.
Five turnovers and a missed dunk didn't
help the Ducks' cause, as they fell into an early
12-point hole. Immediately after Kazemi threw
down a dunk for Oregon's first points of the
game, Stanford went on a three-point barrage,
with Powell, Randle, Bright and junior John
Gage each raining down a three-pointer that
had the crowd roaring in appreciation.
The Ducks scored just two points in over
five minutes of play and trailed by 13 at the
break. Another two-handed slam by Kazemi

Oregon Wednesday night. Powell had 12
points and 13 rebounds for the Cardinal.
near the end of the half was the
only real highlight Oregon had in
the first twenty minutes.
"We were just trying to be as
intense as possible and as aggres
sive as possible, helping each other
out," Powell said. "We spent a lot
of time watching film on them and
watching their offensive schemes,
so just trying to be prepared for
the types of screens they set.
"[Oregon star E.J.] Singler's
always a threat, so we were keying
in on him and trying to make sure
he didn't get off, because he's a
playmaker and a scorer for them,
so we always had an eye on him
and Andy [Brown] did a great job
sticking with him. But I think it
just came down to having that
intensity and that mindset that we
were going to dig in tonight and do
whatever it takes," he said.
A three-ball from Singler
brought the Ducks within 10 to
open the second half, and then
Stanford took off once again. Pow
ell, Randle and Bright all hit shots
to key the offense, and the Card
capitalized on more of Oregon's 20
turnovers. A massive putback
dunk from Huestis put Stanford
up by 22, with under six minutes to
play, sent the few Oregon fans in

the building heading for the exits.
As the final seconds ticked
down, the student section's chants
of "overrated" rang out for the
first time in quite a while the
Card hadn't beaten a ranked oppo
nent since Jan. 13, 2011, when it
topped Washington 58-56 at home.
Stanford's last upset over a top-10
team came in a 67-65 overtime win
at Washington State on Feb. 2,
2008.
Randle, for one, hopes the two
game winning streak is indicative
of good things to come for Stan
ford, which desperately needs to
string wins together in order to
make a run at an NCAA Tourna
ment bid in March. "Really, I just
hope we can look at this game and
just look at it as a stepping stone,"
he said, "just keep going up and
keep being better every single day.
And look at this game and really
see the things that we did well, and
even the things that we can
improve on. This was a great team
that we faced tonight, and we beat
them on our home floor. If we could
do that on the road that would be
great."
First, though, Stanford must
take care of business again on its
home court when Oregon State (11-
9, 1-6 Pac-12) rolls into town on
Sunday Tip off from Maples is slat
ed for 3 p.m.
