## THE
						PERFECT BALANCE NO. 10 OREGON NO MATCH FOR STANFORD 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Maybe it was the announcing team of Brent
Musberger and Bill Walton. Perhaps it was the
rowdy student section overfilled with frats and
sororities that unexpectedly rolled out in force on
a Wednesday night. It's possible that Dwight
Powell, Josh Huestis and Aaron Bright simply ate
their Wheaties in addition to getting fresh hair
cuts.

Whatever the reason, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team put on a high-flying, hot-shooting,
highlight-reel worthy performance in a 76-52
rout of No. 10 Oregon at Maples Pavilion on
Wednesday night.
The Ducks (18-3, 7-1 Pac-12) had entered the
game on an eight-game winning streak, sitting
atop the conference, thanks to a strong offensive
attack and a knack for pulling out close victories.
Stanford (13-8,4-4) made sure there would be
no chance of Oregon pulling out another win by
taking the Ducks out of their game from start to
finish.

The effort certainly made coach Johnny
Dawkins happy. "I just thought it was a great
game," he said. "I thought our atmosphere was
terrific, you know, our student body, our band. I
just really thought it was a great atmosphere
for our guys to play in, and I thought our guys
really responded. So I think that combination of
having great support along with the way our
guys played inspired us this evening and made
for a fun game for us."
The Cardinal carried over the pure shooting
stroke it had displayed in Sunday night's 31-
point rout over Utah on the court against Ore
gon. Guards Chasson Randle and Aaron Bright
couldn't miss from behind the arc literally,
going 6-6 from downtown and combined for
29 points.
Inside, where Stanford had been wary of the

Ducks' size and aptitude for crashing the glass,
the Card again did not back down. Forwards
Josh Huestis and Dwight Powell had 13 boards
apiece, repeatedly boxing out well and snatch
ing rebounds on both the offensive and defen
sive ends of the floor.
"To be honest, I keep repeating it but just
that mindset that we were going to do whatev
er it takes [to win the battle on the glass]," Pow
ell said. "[Oregon's Tony] Woods and [Arsalan]
Kazemi were great rebounders, great offensive
rebounders, so just we went in with that aware
ness and tried to take them out as best as we
could. And the guards did a good job of boxing
them out and helping, so the balls, we were able
to get to them."
Most importantly, however, was the defen
sive effort for Stanford.
While the Ducks were missing their starting
point guard, Dominic Artis, due to injury, it
might not have mattered as the Cardinal's
defense was swarming from the opening tip.
Two steals in the first 94 seconds gave the stu
dent section some life, waving giant cutout
heads of UCLA legend Bill Walton, who was
announcing the game for ESPN, and Andrew
Luck.
Five turnovers and a missed dunk didn't
help the Ducks' cause, as they fell into an early
12-point hole. Immediately after Kazemi threw
down a dunk for Oregon's first points of the
game, Stanford went on a three-point barrage,
with Powell, Randle, Bright and junior John
Gage each raining down a three-pointer that
had the crowd roaring in appreciation.
The Ducks scored just two points in over
five minutes of play and trailed by 13 at the
break. Another two-handed slam by Kazemi
