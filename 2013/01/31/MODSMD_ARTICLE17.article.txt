### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
After opening the season with five straight
victories, the No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo team returns home for the Stanford Invi
tational this weekend.
Stanford (5-0) hosts seven collegiate teams
as well as The Olympic Club for matches played
in both Avery Pool and Belardi Pool. The Cardi
nal will be seeking its fourth-straight champi
onship in its home tournament.

The Cardinal looks to continue overwhelm
ing opponents early in four of five games last
weekend, Stanford scored what turned out to

be the winning goal in the first period.
Offensively, senior captain Melissa Seide
mann leads the team with 14 goals. She is fol
lowed by a trio of freshmen Gurpreet Sohi,
Maggie Steffens and Anna Yelizarova who
combined for 28 goals in the first five games of
their collegiate careers. In all, 13 different play
ers scored for the Cardinal last weekend as it
outscored opponents 73-18.
However impressive the goal total may look,
Stanford head coach John Tanner was much
happier with the team's performance on the
defensive side of the pool. Junior Kelsey Suggs
leads a lockdown defense that has held oppo
nent to just 3.6 goals per game. In goal, senior

Kate Baldoni, sophomore Emily Dorst and
freshman Gabby Stone all performed well last
weekend.
Stanford faces tough competition in the
tournament, as all eight collegiate teams in the
tournament are ranked in the CWPA Top 20.
On Saturday, the Cardinal faces the San
Francisco-based Olympic Club in an exhibition
game at 8:30 a.m, before diving back in against
No. 9 San Jose State at 4 p.m.
On Sunday, the Cardinal starts the day with
No. 13 UC-Davis at 8 a.m at Avery Pool.
For the final game of the tournament, teams
