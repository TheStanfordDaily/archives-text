## 
### JANA PERSKY STAFF WRITER 
After opening the season with five straight
victories, the No. 1 Stanford women's water
polo team returns home for the Stanford Invi
tational this weekend.
Stanford (5-0) hosts seven collegiate teams
as well as The Olympic Club for matches played
in both Avery Pool and Belardi Pool. The Cardi
nal will be seeking its fourth-straight champi
onship in its home tournament.

The Cardinal looks to continue overwhelm
ing opponents early in four of five games last
weekend, Stanford scored what turned out to

be the winning goal in the first period.
Offensively, senior captain Melissa Seide
mann leads the team with 14 goals. She is fol
lowed by a trio of freshmen Gurpreet Sohi,
Maggie Steffens and Anna Yelizarova who
combined for 28 goals in the first five games of
their collegiate careers. In all, 13 different play
ers scored for the Cardinal last weekend as it
outscored opponents 73-18.
However impressive the goal total may look,
Stanford head coach John Tanner was much
happier with the team's performance on the
defensive side of the pool. Junior Kelsey Suggs
leads a lockdown defense that has held oppo
nent to just 3.6 goals per game. In goal, senior

Kate Baldoni, sophomore Emily Dorst and
freshman Gabby Stone all performed well last
weekend.
Stanford faces tough competition in the
tournament, as all eight collegiate teams in the
tournament are ranked in the CWPA Top 20.
On Saturday, the Cardinal faces the San
Francisco-based Olympic Club in an exhibition
game at 8:30 a.m, before diving back in against
No. 9 San Jose State at 4 p.m.
On Sunday, the Cardinal starts the day with
No. 13 UC-Davis at 8 a.m at Avery Pool.

are matched up based on corre
sponding rankings between the
two brackets.

Stanford is in Bracket A along
with UC-Davis and San Jose State.
UCLA, California, Hawaii and
Indiana are in Bracket B. Hartwick
is automatically slotted into fourth
place in Bracket A, since it will not
participate in Saturday's games.
Tanner cited San Jose State,
Stanford's first collegiate oppo
nent, as a team to look out for this
season.
The Spartans boast a 4-1
record, with the lone loss coming
against No. 7 San Diego State.
Both San Jose State and Stanford
beat Michigan last weekend the
Spartans outscored Michigan 9-4,
while the Cardinal won 11-2.
San Jose State is led by fresh
man 2-meter Rae Lekness, who
has 16 goals this season. Junior
goalkeeper Maddie Reardon has a
goals-against average of 7.79 in five
starts.
UC-Davis is more unknown, as
the Aggies have played only one
game this season. Davis opened the
season with a 12-7 win over Cal
Sate Monterey Bay behind three

goals and five assists from sopho
more Keelia Houston. Last season,
the Cardinal easily defeated the
Aggies in both matches between
the teams.
Stanford's toughest test is like
ly to come in Sunday afternoon's
game. If the Cardinal beats UC-
Davis and San Jose State, it is like
ly to face either No. 3 UCLA or No.
4 California in the championship
game. Both teams bring undefeat
ed records into the tournament,
but one will get a loss when they
match up at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Last season, the Cardinal split
four matches with UCLA, includ
ing a 9-5 Stanford victory in the
final of the 2012 Stanford Invita
tional. The Bruins returned the
favor in the MPSF Championship
game, an 8-7 overtime battle that
represents was the last time the
Cardinal lost.
Stanford has won 31 straight
matchups against Cal, a streak that
dates back to March 26, 2000.
