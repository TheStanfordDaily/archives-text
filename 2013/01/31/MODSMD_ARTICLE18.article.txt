# Electricity on its way back at Maples
## 
### Sam Fisher 
Mr. Musberger worked
his magic courtside
at Maples once
again last night. The
man who when
Dickie V wasn't stepping all over his
call â€”immortalized Nick Robinson
and Maples Pavilion forever was
there to call another big Stanford vic
tory.
But this time it was different. Yes,
Stanford knocked off a top-10 Oregon
Ducks team, but it just wasn't that
exciting.
If Brent Musberger was the con
stant in these two big Stanford victo
ries, his broadcast partners symbol
ize the difference.
In 2004, as Nick Robinson's
buzzer-beater sailed through the net,
Dick Vitale, the most colorful of all
color commentators couldn't stop
screaming with excitement. To be fair*
to Vitale, that didn't make him any
different than the Sixth Man's stu
dents spilling onto the court.
But last night, as Stanford
methodically knocked off an Oregon
team that looked like it never got off
the plane, the much calmer to be
fair, it's pretty hard to not be "much
calmer" when being compared to
Dickie V Bill Walton sat next to
Mr. Musberger.
Then, it happened. With just
under 15 minutes to play in the ball
game, Chasson Randle and Aaron
Bright hit two three-pointers in two
seconds, and Maples went wild.
I'm not even sure how I'm sup
posed to describe this. Maples Pavil
ion, during a Stanford Men's Basket
ball game, actually got loud.
Now I wasn't here in 2004. I'm not
sure if I even knew Stanford existed
as a sixth-grader back in Westfield,
N.J., but I can imagine that, for the
first time in a while, this Maples Pavil
ion crowd actually began to resemble
its former self.
"GOOOOOOOO. STANFORD,"
the crowd roared. Well, maybe roared
isn't the right word, but it's a start.
Let me be clear, I'm not blaming
Stanford's fans for the lull in excite
ment. Though there were plenty of
empty seats last night, enough of
Nerd Nation was there to make it
loud.
Stanford isn't even that good. The
Card showed last night that it isn't a
bad basketball team, but no one would
question the argument that Stanford is
not a great basketball team.
That's what is so puzzling about this
team. The Cardinal has multiple per
sonality disorder, where the magic
potion seems to be any trip on an air
plane.
I do not understand how Stanford
Men's Basketball can beat No. 10 Ore
gon so decisively and lay an egg in so
many other games this season, includ
ing in a 21-point loss to Colorado in
Boulder.
Maybe I just don't know enough
about basketball it's definitely the
major sports that I know the least
about. All I know is this team perplex
es me.
I don't think it's an effort question
especially on the defensive side of
the ball. On some nights, though, the
offense does not show up. That's what
keeps Johnny Dawkins's seat so hot
and Stanford's fans away from
Maples Pavilion.
For the most part this season,
Stanford just has not played exciting
basketball. Even the first half last
night was pretty lackluster the
season-ticket holders next to me who
are some of the biggest Stanford fans
I know even left at halftime due to
boredom.
My good friend and former Man
aging Editor of Spoils Jack Blanchat
asked last week after Stanford's loss
at Colorado if this season was the end
of the road for Johnny Dawkins.
Just like last season, when Jack
wrote a similar column for The Daily
just before Stanford's revival en route
to an NIT Championship, it appears
as though Jack has at least initially
reverse-jinxed the Cardinal. Stanford
has won its two games since Jack's
column by a combined 55 points I
think you can call that a comeback.
However, Stanford hasn't shown
that it can consistently be an exciting
basketball team. Even if Stanford can
win a few more games and knock off
a top-25 team every once in a while, is
that good enough to warrant Johnny
Dawkins staying around?
Dawkins is an excellent human
being, which certainly helps his cause.
However, at Stanford, Dawkins needs
to do more than that he has to win
basketball games.
Actually, I'd argue that, in the Bay
Area, being exciting might be even
more important than winning. Stan
ford Football saw that firsthand over
the last two years. With Andrew
Luck, Stanford finally started selling
out its stadium. But, this past year,
even when Stanford won the Pac-12
to host the conference championship
game, attendance suffered at least in
part because the offense was boring.

So, though Blanchat may have
saved Stanford's record with his
reverse-jinx column, I'm not sure
that should, or will, save Johnny
Dawkins. Obviously Dawkins needs
to win more, but winning a few more
games without reinvigorating the fan
base won't be enough.
If Dawkins can find away to get
the offense going like it did it last
night's second half consistently
especially on the road I think

Stanford fans can make Maples
Pavilion a fun place to see a game
once again. Dawkins better hope so,
because it might be his only hope.

Sam Fisher has plans to wear a
wig, paint his chest and dance like
Andrew Zimmermann for the
home crowd at Sunday's game.
