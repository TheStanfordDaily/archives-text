# NEW BEGINNING
## 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's ten
nis team reappears on the courts
today in the season opener against
UC-Davis. The small but deter
mined eight-girl squad looks for
redemption after losing to USC in
last year's NCAA quarterfinals in
May. The new journey begins under
the leadership of coach Lele
Forood, senior captain Natalie Dil
lon and junior captains Nicole Gibbs
and Kristie Ahn.

The Cardinal lost Mallory Bur
dette, who opted to forgo her senior
year and enter the pro circuit in
September after losing to Maria
Sharapova in the third round of the
US Open. Despite her absence,
Stanford still looks strong with sev
eral key players coming back.
Gibbs will return to play court
one. Like Burdette, she also has
experience against top-five players,
including Serena Williams and
Petra Kvitova. Gibbs just returned
from the qualifiers of the Australian
Open, and despite briefly missing
Stanford practices, sees the benefit
in playing professional tourna
ments.

"I find the two completely com
plementary to each other," Gibbs
said. "It's not a balancing act for me
when I'm on tour playing matches
for my personal career. It's helping
my level of play for when I'm here."
Academically, though, Gibbs
admits it can be difficult. As an Eco
nomics major taking a very heavy
workload this quarter, she acknowl
edges the focus necessary to suc
cessfully handle all her endeavors.
But it's not only herself who she has
to worry about. The trio of Gibbs,
Ahn and Dillon will be responsible
for maintaining balance within the
team.

"lt's our job to take care of the
nitty gritties, dot the I's and cross
the T's," Ahn said. "We also make
an effort to set a precedent, always
giving 100 percent whether we're
on the court or in the gym. We also
do our best to communicate with
the coaches as much as possible so
we're all on the same page."
Ahn will finally be a healthy
starter again after missing almost
all of last season with injuries. Her
return is huge for the already small
Stanford squad.
"I feel better than I did coming
into Stanford as a freshman," she
asserted. "I put in my time at the
gym when I was still limited on the
court, and I think it's really paid
off."
In addition to the returning
Gibbs, Ahn, and Dillon, the Cardi
nal will return sophomore Ellen
Tsay, junior Amelia Herring and
senior Stacey Tan.
It has also welcomed two new
members, freshmen Krista Harde
beck and Lindsey Kostas. Harde
beck, a No. 1 recruit who has
ranked inside the top-300 on the pro
circuit, will enter the season ranked
an astounding No. 2 in the country.
"[Hardebeck] is a vibrant per
sonality and adds so much to our
team dynamic on the personal side,"
Gibbs said. "She's also an excep
tional college tennis player and had
a very illustrious junior and pro cir
cuit career. She's definitely the real

deal."
For Hardebeck, Stanford was an
easy choice. It was always her
dream school because her long time
coach, Debbie Graham, is a Stan
ford alumna who actually captured
a NCAA singles title as a sopho
more in 1990. Playing for a team
has definitely been a transition for
Hardebeck, but something she
views as a positive.
"Depending on other people and
having other people rely on you is
something you have to get used to,"
she said. "It's a growing experience
but definitely a beneficial one."
Hardebeck and Kostas actually
were doubles partners when they
were 12 and 13 years old. Both from
southern California, they played in
the same section and knew each
other well.
"We stopped playing the same
tournaments though around sopho
more year," Hardebeck said. "We
reconnected when we found out we
were both going to be freshmen at
Stanford."
A Kostas/Hardebeck doubles
team isn't in the cards for the Car
dinal this year though, as Gibbs and
Ahn will lead the line up at No. 1,
Tan and Tsay at No. 2, and Dillon
and Hardebeck at No. 3.
The singles line up is still not
completely cemented, but fans can
be sure to see a prepared and deter-

mined Stanford team on Thursday.
"I think our team feels we have
something to prove out there," Ahn
said. "There will definitely be a lot
of desire and fire on the court. We
have some pretty animated tennis
players who love to get the crowd
engaged."
Gibbs hopes that kicking off the
season with a win against UC-Davis
will increase the team's confidence.
"It's early in the year to talk
about a team identity because we
haven't seen how we play together
yet," she acknowledged. "We have a
certain level of intensity and a good
work ethic on our team, and we've
reformed ourselves to make up for
[Burdette's] absence. I think we
look really good."
Though UC-Davis typically isn't
a powerhouse team, the Cardinal
has some huge matches quickly
approaching. In fact, Stanford will
travel to Gainesville to face long
time rival and No. 1 ranked Univer
sity of Florida on Feb. 24. The team
will also travel to face southern Cal
ifornia foes No. 2 UCLA and No. 4
USC in March.
The Cardinal will first attempt
to defeat the Aggies on Thursday at
3 p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis
Courts.
