## Policy forces Net Appetit from campus 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
Net Appetit, a popular food truck that has
served Thai food on Santa Teresa Avenue for
more than a decade, has been asked by the
University to cease operations on campus as
part of Stanford's new mobile food vendor
policy, which took effect on Jan. 7 of this year.
Chon Yo, founder and operator of Net
Appetit, has operated the truck on the Stan
ford campus since 2001. All Vo's profits go to
Aid to Children Without Parents (ACWP), a
nonprofit organization that provides two
meals to children in Vietnam for every dollar
donated by the truck.
Stanford's new policy regarding food
trucks mandates that trucks must register
with Off The Grid, a food truck management
company that has partnered with the Univer
sity for the winter pilot program to bring
food trucks to campus.
Assistant Vice President for Business
Development Susan Weinstein '72 MBA '79
who helped draft the mobile food vendor pol
icy, declined a request for interview but
released a statement saying the notice about
the food truck policy and its implementation
was given to trucks operating on campus
beginning last November.
"The notice informed the trucks
that they would be required to have
a permit from Off the Grid in order
to continue [to] serve campus
beginning on Jan. 7, and also con
tained information on how the food
trucks could register with Off The
Grid," Weinstein wrote.
Vo was informed of the decision
through an unsigned notice from
the Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety on Dec. 7,
one week before the University
closed for winter break.
"On Dec. 7, the campus police
dropped off the letter," Vo said.
"We only had one week to react,
and the letter wasn't signed, so we
didn't know how to get in touch."
Since then, he has tried unsuc
cessfully to appeal to administra
tors, citing a spotless health
record.
"That's the thing that perplexed
us the most," Vo said. "If we violat
ed stuff like the food safety, then of
course we know why, but we have a
good record of 11 years. Not a sin
gle violation a spotless record."
Students and other members of
the Stanford community have sent
Vo more than 200 emails express
ing sadness over the absence of
Net Appetit.
The mobile food vendor policy
does not specifically state that food

trucks must go through Off the
Grid to be on campus, however the
University defended their decision.
"Stanford has a long-standing
policy contained in [Administrative]
Guide 15.3, which requires permis
sion from Stanford before any
unrelated commercial enterprise
may operate on campus," Weinstein
wrote. "Uninvited food trucks do
not have such permission."
"Other food trucks serving cam
pus must demonstrate that they
can operate in compliance with the
[mobile food vendor] policy and be
permitted to sell at a specific time
and location," according to the
notice given to Vo. "Stanford has
engaged Off the Grid to manage the
process to obtain a permit."
According to Vo, the process of
registering with Off the Grid is not
as easy as the notice makes it seem
when he applied, he received a
rejection letter saying that all the
available spaces on campus were
taken.

Vo said that Net Appetit was not
attempting to grow as a business or
take business away from Tresidder
eateries such as CoHo, so he
capped the number of meals sold
per day at 120. The food truck was
making just enough money to cov
er the cost of operations and give
$2OO a day to ACWE Vo called the
truck "a gift that kept on giving."
However, because it is a non
profit, Vo said Net Appetit doesn't
have the cash reserves of a typical
business and wouldn't be able to
sustain itself without business from

its on-campus spot.
"If Stanford doesn't allow [us
back] within three months [from
December], we will run out of the
cash reserve," Vo said. "We have a
month and a half left, and then we
will never come back again."
"The only thing we're worried
about now is that we don't abandon
the people who have been with us,"
he added. "Some people have been
eating [at Net Appetit] for ten
years. It's not because our food is
better. Stanford has the best dining
facilities better than Yale, better
than Harvard. I think it's just
there's not enough ethnic cuisine
here... so we concentrate on that,
and we've been very successful."
Stanford Law School teaching
fellow Matt Lamkin, who used Net
Appetit to cater Law School
events, was enthusiastic about the
truck's service, low cost, food and
mission.
"I sincerely hope that, one way
or another, he'll be able to operate
the truck at Stanford, he said.
"Selfishly because I love the food,
but more importantly, because of
the great work that it funds."
The University will consider
adding another truck to the
lunchtime schedule, according to
Weinstein, but it must meet a list of
requirements including not block
ing walkways or bike paths and not
being too close to an existing cam
pus cafe.
