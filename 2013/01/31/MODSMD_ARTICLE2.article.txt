## Policy forces Net Appetit from campus 
### SAMANTHA LYNN 
Net Appetit, a popular food truck that has
served Thai food on Santa Teresa Avenue for
more than a decade, has been asked by the
University to cease operations on campus as
part of Stanford's new mobile food vendor
policy, which took effect on Jan. 7 of this year.
Chon Yo, founder and operator of Net
Appetit, has operated the truck on the Stan
ford campus since 2001. All Vo's profits go to
Aid to Children Without Parents (ACWP), a
nonprofit organization that provides two
meals to children in Vietnam for every dollar
donated by the truck.
Stanford's new policy regarding food
trucks mandates that trucks must register
with Off The Grid, a food truck management
company that has partnered with the Univer
sity for the winter pilot program to bring
food trucks to campus.
Assistant Vice President for Business
Development Susan Weinstein '72 MBA '79
who helped draft the mobile food vendor pol
icy, declined a request for interview but
released a statement saying the notice about
the food truck policy and its implementation
was given to trucks operating on campus
beginning last November.
