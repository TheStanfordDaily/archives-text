## Big firms pay CDC $100k a year 
### CLARISSE PERALTA 
The Stanford Career Development Center
(CDC) earns roughly $lOO,OOO each year from a
program that charges employers to use services
intended to help them reach out to Stanford stu
dents and alumni, according to CDC Director
Lance Choy. One of the services offered is the
ability to send out targeted emails to Stanford
students on the basis of factors such as class
year, gender, race, major and GPA.
The program has elicited controversy
amongst student groups in recent years, peak
ing when at the height of the Occupy Stan
ford movement last winter quarter—student
activist Joshua Schott 'l4 wrote an op-ed to The
Daily, calling these services an "attempt to fun
nel its students into a narrow career pool on a
monetary basis."
Schott said that almost all of the employers
who participate in the CDC's partnership pro
gram as well as in the CDC's job listing data
base fall into one of four industries: oil, con
sulting, technology or finance.
"We thought that the CDC is not doing a fair
job with the students who do not want to work
for these institutions," Schott said.
The CDC originally started the program in
2001 as a response to three years of consecutive
budget cuts due to the dot-com bust. According
to Choy, revenue from the program has allowed
the CDC to expand its staff, hire a coun
selor to undertake outreach for the
School of Humanities and Sciences and
fund a mentoring program for all stu
dents.
"Are we favoring investment bank
ing, for instance? No," Choy said. "These
companies are going to recruit at Stan
ford and find ways to promote them
selves whether there is a program or not.
The CDC helps them and in turn we gen
erate much needed revenue for staff
positions."
Employers interested in participat
ing in the program can choose one of
three membership levels: a "Platinum
Partner" company which pays
$lO,OOO a year or $25,000 for three
years receives the ability to send
unlimited emails to targeted Stanford
students and alumni, among other ben
efits. A "Gold Partner" which pays
$5,000 per year or $12,500 for three
years gets to send two targeted
emails per quarter and a "Silver Part
ner" — which pays $2,000 per year or
$5,000 for three years gets to send
one targeted email per quarter, among
other perks.
Choy noted that students can opt
out from these emails and that employ
ers are not able to see the profiles of the
students who receive these emails.
"We send out emails to recruiting
lists which students can toggle off,"
Choy said. "We basically limit these
emails and the reason why is employers
were asking clubs to send out emails for
them. It became crazy and chaotic so
we decided to systemize it. So this is
our way to control companies from
finding ways to send out emails on their
own."
Participating employers may also
receive other services, such as access to
the Stanford Resume Service, pre
ferred participant status for on-campus
career events and access to Cardinal
Recruiting interviewing rooms.
This year, Bank of America, Boston

Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs and
McKinsey & Co are all Platinum Part
ners.
Apple, Accenture, Bain, Capital
One, Credit Suisse, Deloitte, Everyday
Health, KLA-Teneor, Kurt Salmon,
L.E.K., Lam Research, Merck, Oliver
Wyman, Schlumberger, Shell Oil Co.,
VISA and ZS are Gold Partners. Lock
heed Martin is the sole Silver Partner.
Despite the fact that many of the
employers participating in the program
operate in the same industries, Choy
said that the Partnership Program does
not advantage specific companies.
"It targets the companies who want
these services, who actively have
strong, big college recruiting programs
here," Choy said. "For public service
organizations, we have a newsletter
that we send all the time. For larger
nonprofits like Teach for America, who
hire in bulk, we offer a variety of free
services for them and space. So we tai
lor certain services for certain types of
people."
According to Choy, the program is a
small part of the CDC's efforts to sup
port students' job searches. The CDC
regularly sends out newsletters that
contain job listings, supports the Stan
ford Alumni Mentoring program and
holds workshops on using Linkedln
and developing networking skills.
The recruiting service has recently
been the subject of discussion in stu

dent publications, with The Unofficial
Stanford Blog posting a humorous
graphic about number of employers
seeking computer science majors and
The Daily running a column that
lamented the absence of employers in
creative industries at career fairs.
"I know that students would love to
have employers come to campus to
recruit them, but that's not going to be
the case for many situations," Choy
said.
Schott said that the CDC should not
let market forces dictate the employers
who attend career fairs.
"The role of the CDC is not to serve
the job market, but provide students an
advantage over the job market and as
many opportunities," Schott said.
"They should not just go with the mar
ket because it will make them the most
money."
"Students need to realize that most
employers do not actively recruit at col
lege campuses because they can meet
their hiring needs in other ways," he
added. "Some companies are not inter
ested in attending a career fair. It takes
a lot of resources to send a staff person
to travel and spend a whole day here.
They cannot afford to do that."
The CDC earns $700,000 from career
fairs each year.

one targeted email per quarter, among
other perks.
Choy noted that students can opt
out from these emails and that employ
ers are not able to see the profiles of the
students who receive these emails.
"We send out emails to recruiting
lists which students can toggle off,"
Choy said. "We basically limit these
emails and the reason why is employers
were asking clubs to send out emails for
them. It became crazy and chaotic so
we decided to systemize it. So this is
our way to control companies from
finding ways to send out emails on their
own."
Participating employers may also
receive other services, such as access to
the Stanford Resume Service, pre
ferred participant status for on-campus
career events and access to Cardinal
Recruiting interviewing rooms.
This year, Bank of America, Boston

Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs and
McKinsey & Co are all Platinum Part
ners.
Apple, Accenture, Bain, Capital
One, Credit Suisse, Deloitte, Everyday
Health, KLA-Teneor, Kurt Salmon,
L.E.K., Lam Research, Merck, Oliver
Wyman, Schlumberger, Shell Oil Co.,
VISA and ZS are Gold Partners. Lock
heed Martin is the sole Silver Partner.
Despite the fact that many of the
employers participating in the program
operate in the same industries, Choy
said that the Partnership Program does
not advantage specific companies.
"It targets the companies who want
these services, who actively have
strong, big college recruiting programs
here," Choy said. "For public service
organizations, we have a newsletter
that we send all the time. For larger
nonprofits like Teach for America, who
hire in bulk, we offer a variety of free
services for them and space. So we tai
lor certain services for certain types of
people."
According to Choy, the program is a
small part of the CDC's efforts to sup
port students' job searches. The CDC
regularly sends out newsletters that
contain job listings, supports the Stan
ford Alumni Mentoring program and
holds workshops on using Linkedln
and developing networking skills.
The recruiting service has recently
been the subject of discussion in stu

dent publications, with The Unofficial
Stanford Blog posting a humorous
graphic about number of employers
seeking computer science majors and
The Daily running a column that
lamented the absence of employers in
creative industries at career fairs.
"I know that students would love to
have employers come to campus to
recruit them, but that's not going to be
the case for many situations," Choy
said.
Schott said that the CDC should not
let market forces dictate the employers
who attend career fairs.
"The role of the CDC is not to serve
the job market, but provide students an
advantage over the job market and as
many opportunities," Schott said.
"They should not just go with the mar
ket because it will make them the most
money."
"Students need to realize that most
employers do not actively recruit at col
lege campuses because they can meet
their hiring needs in other ways," he
added. "Some companies are not inter
ested in attending a career fair. It takes
a lot of resources to send a staff person
to travel and spend a whole day here.
They cannot afford to do that."
The CDC earns $700,000 from career
fairs each year.

Twenty-two firms paid the CDC between $2,000 and $10,000 per year for
permission to send targeted emails to Stanford students. The CDC makes
$700,000 each year by charging companies for access at career fairs.
The Stanford Career Development Center
(CDC) earns roughly $lOO,OOO each year from a
program that charges employers to use services
intended to help them reach out to Stanford stu
dents and alumni, according to CDC Director
Lance Choy. One of the services offered is the
ability to send out targeted emails to Stanford
students on the basis of factors such as class
year, gender, race, major and GPA.
The program has elicited controversy
amongst student groups in recent years, peak
ing when at the height of the Occupy Stan
ford movement last winter quarter—student
activist Joshua Schott 'l4 wrote an op-ed to The
Daily, calling these services an "attempt to fun
nel its students into a narrow career pool on a
monetary basis."
Schott said that almost all of the employers
who participate in the CDC's partnership pro
gram as well as in the CDC's job listing data
base fall into one of four industries: oil, con
sulting, technology or finance.
"We thought that the CDC is not doing a fair
job with the students who do not want to work
for these institutions," Schott said.
The CDC originally started the program in
2001 as a response to three years of consecutive
budget cuts due to the dot-com bust. According
to Choy, revenue from the program has allowed
the CDC to expand its staff, hire a coun
selor to undertake outreach for the
School of Humanities and Sciences and
fund a mentoring program for all stu
dents.
"Are we favoring investment bank
ing, for instance? No," Choy said. "These
companies are going to recruit at Stan
ford and find ways to promote them
selves whether there is a program or not.
The CDC helps them and in turn we gen
erate much needed revenue for staff
positions."
Employers interested in participat
ing in the program can choose one of
three membership levels: a "Platinum
Partner" company which pays
$lO,OOO a year or $25,000 for three
years receives the ability to send
unlimited emails to targeted Stanford
students and alumni, among other ben
efits. A "Gold Partner" which pays
$5,000 per year or $12,500 for three
years gets to send two targeted
emails per quarter and a "Silver Part
ner" — which pays $2,000 per year or
$5,000 for three years gets to send
one targeted email per quarter, among
other perks.
Choy noted that students can opt
out from these emails and that employ
ers are not able to see the profiles of the
students who receive these emails.

lists which students can toggle off,"
