# Green groups sue Stanford
## University officials deny their operation of Searsville Dam violates Endangered Species 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two environmental groups filed suit
against Stanford on Tuesday, alleging that
the University's operation of the Searsville
Dam and the ensuing water diversion
has harmed local steelhead trout popula
tions.
Despite an ongoing investigation of the
same issue by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Uni
versity administrators dismissed the lawsuit

filed by the Ecological Rights Foundation
(ERF) and Our Children's Earth Foundation
(OCE).
"It's a baseless lawsuit," said University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. Lapin added that
the lawsuit would not affect Stanford's oper
ations at Jasper Ridge or the University in
general.
"Unassailable" evidence of violations
Steelhead trout, a variant species of rain
bow trout that lives in the ocean but migrates
back upstream to reproduce, are listed as an

endangered species under the Endangered
Species Act (ESA). As such, any activity that
"harms, harasses or kills" the steelhead is a
criminal violation of federal law, according to
Jim Milbury, a representative from National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Fish
eries Service.
While organizations can obtain permits
for routine activities that may incidentally
cause minor harm to endangered species,
Stanford doesn't have an Incidental Take


MADELINE SIDES/The Stanford Daily
A tour is led past Searsville Dam, which is operated by Stanford in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. Federal investigators are
currently looking into whether the University is responsible for threatening the population of steelhead trout in San Francisquito Creek.
Permit for its operation of the Searsville
Dam. The University has argued that the
dam does not cause enough damage to the
steelhead trout to be considered a viola
tion of the ESA.
"We are not violating the [ESA] â€”we
are not taking fish because there is a
healthy, breeding population of fish in the
creek below the dam," Lapin said. "The
operations of the dam are not killing fish."
Christopher Sproul, lead attorney for
the case, contended that evidence of Stan
ford's violation is "unassailable."
In addition to being a barrier to
upstream migration, Sproul said that the
dam and Stanford's water diversion oper
ations harm the steelhead by lowering
water volume, decreasing oxygen content
and increasing water temperatures. He
also argued that the dam is directly killing
the steelhead population that lives just
downstream.
"Steelhead occasionally have been
known to throw themselves against the
dam trying to migrate upstream and
injure themselves," he said. "[Also],
Searsville reservoir is a haven for non
native predator species that occasionally
spill over the dam and prey on steelhead."
Lapin contested many of Sproul's
claims, arguing that the dam's negative
impact on the steelhead is marginal and is
still being investigated.
"Historically, before 1892 ...the steel
head might have been about to go a mile or
so beyond the dam," she said. "So what
we're really talking about... is what dif
ference would be made if the steelhead
were able to go one more mile further
upstream to spawn."
Lapin also argued that, among other
considerations, the removal of the dam
might result in the dispersal of sediment
and alteration of upstream wetlands, neg
atively affecting the steelhead trout popu
lation

"The only thing I can say with confi
dence is that anybody who is confident
about what to do is not to be believed,"
said Philippe Cohen, executive director of
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, of
the dam's impact on steelhead trout.
Cohen is part of a Steering Committee
chartered by Stanford in 2011 to conduct a
study of long-term options for the Univer
sity's operation of the Searsville Dam and
Reservoir.
Opening Suit
According to an ERF press release,
the plaintiffs formally notified Stanford of
their intent to file suit on Nov. 20. While
neither party could say for sure, both
Lapin and Sproul speculated that the noti
fication may have partially motivated the
federal investigation, opened in mid-
December, into Stanford's operation of the
Searsville Dam.
Sproul said that his interest in taking
the case and most of his research comes
from the documents and reports of
Beyond Searsville Dam, a nonprofit envi
ronmental organization led by ecologist
Matt Stoecker. The organization, which
advocates for "a free flowing San Francis
quito Creek through the removal of
Searsville Dam," has been a vocal oppo
nent to Searsville Dam since its founding
in 2006.
Lapin expressed concern that Sproul
and his clients haven't fully considered
Stanford's position or attempted to com
municate Stanford through non-con
frontational channels
"We've had no interaction with [the
ERF or OCE]," Lapin said. "These
groups have never demonstrated interest
in the dam or our study. They've never
contacted us over the 18 months that
we've been doing the Searsville study. We
offered to meet with them; they declined."
According to the court order setting
initial case deadlines, the initial case man
agement conference for the suit has been
scheduled for April 30.
