# Green groups sue Stanford
## University officials deny their operation of Searsville Dam violates Endangered Species 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Two environmental groups filed suit
against Stanford on Tuesday, alleging that
the University's operation of the Searsville
Dam and the ensuing water diversion
has harmed local steelhead trout popula
tions.
Despite an ongoing investigation of the
same issue by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Uni
versity administrators dismissed the lawsuit

filed by the Ecological Rights Foundation
(ERF) and Our Children's Earth Foundation
(OCE).
"It's a baseless lawsuit," said University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. Lapin added that
the lawsuit would not affect Stanford's oper
ations at Jasper Ridge or the University in
general.
"Unassailable" evidence of violations
Steelhead trout, a variant species of rain
bow trout that lives in the ocean but migrates
back upstream to reproduce, are listed as an

endangered species under the Endangered
Species Act (ESA). As such, any activity that
"harms, harasses or kills" the steelhead is a
criminal violation of federal law, according to
Jim Milbury, a representative from National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Fish
eries Service.
While organizations can obtain permits
for routine activities that may incidentally
cause minor harm to endangered species,
Stanford doesn't have an Incidental Take

A tour is led past Searsville Dam, which is operated by Stanford in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. Federal investigators are
currently looking into whether the University is responsible for threatening the population of steelhead trout in San Francisquito Creek.
