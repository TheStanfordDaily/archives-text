## University nixes new ice rink proposal 
### KATIE SALMON 
The University is no longer consid
ering a proposal for the construction of
an on-campus ice rink facility, accord
ing to administrators and team mem
bers involved in the discussions. While
the Stanford club ice hockey team,
which spearheaded the proposal, raised
enough funds last year to support a fea
sibility study of the project, the Univer
sity declined to conduct such a study,
effectively terminating the project.
Deputy Director of Athletics Ray
Purpur worked briefly with the club ice
hockey team on the proposal, stating
that the department had viewed the
facility as "one of our master plan proj
ects."
After the proposal was presented to
Stanford's Capital Planning group,
however, the University decided that
the project was "not a priority" Purpur
said.
Purpur said that challenges facing

the project such as finding a suitable
place for the rink to be located on cam
pusâ€” discouraged the school from
pursuing the proposal. Additionally, an
ice rink would be expensive and diffi
cult to maintain, and the University
expressed doubts about the revenues
that could be raised from such a facility.
The Daily originally reported on the
ice rink proposal last January after the
club ice hockey team raised approxi
mately $26,000 within 24 hours to fund
a feasibility study. The proposed facility
would have incorporated multiple
sheets of ice, as well as storage and
training space for other sports and
recreational opportunities. At the time,
team member Jack Werner 'l4 antici
pated construction taking approxi
mately four years if the project
received approval.
The Club Sports Facilities Depart
ment was not involved in the project,
