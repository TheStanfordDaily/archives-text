## University nixes new ice rink proposal 
### KATIE SALMON 
The University is no longer consid
ering a proposal for the construction of
an on-campus ice rink facility, accord
ing to administrators and team mem
bers involved in the discussions. While
the Stanford club ice hockey team,
which spearheaded the proposal, raised
enough funds last year to support a fea
sibility study of the project, the Univer
sity declined to conduct such a study,
effectively terminating the project.
Deputy Director of Athletics Ray
Purpur worked briefly with the club ice
hockey team on the proposal, stating
that the department had viewed the
facility as "one of our master plan proj
ects."
After the proposal was presented to
Stanford's Capital Planning group,
however, the University decided that
the project was "not a priority" Purpur
said.
Purpur said that challenges facing

the project such as finding a suitable
place for the rink to be located on cam
pusâ€” discouraged the school from
pursuing the proposal. Additionally, an
ice rink would be expensive and diffi
cult to maintain, and the University
expressed doubts about the revenues
that could be raised from such a facility.
The Daily originally reported on the
ice rink proposal last January after the
club ice hockey team raised approxi
mately $26,000 within 24 hours to fund
a feasibility study. The proposed facility
would have incorporated multiple
sheets of ice, as well as storage and
training space for other sports and
recreational opportunities. At the time,
team member Jack Werner 'l4 antici
pated construction taking approxi
mately four years if the project
received approval.

ment was not involved in the project,

in Redwood City. University officials are no longer
considering a proposal to construct a rink on campus.
according to its director Tim
Ghormley, however the Club Sports
department was supportive of the
idea. Director of Club Sports Pam
Mahlow, who has worked with the
ice hockey team over the past four
years, expressed the potential val
ue of an on-campus rink for the
team's recruitment. She echoed
earlier arguments made by current
players and other student-athletes,
citing the difficulties the team faces
by practicing and competing off
campus.
Mahlow confirmed that the
team had been working independ
ently for fundraising and planning.
In fact, Mahlow said she first
learned about the initial plans for
the ice rink through The Daily's
coverage of the proposal more than
a year ago.
"I haven't really heard anything
since then, either from the team or
University, regarding it," Mahlow
said.
The Department of Capital
Planning, a branch of Land, Build
ings and Real Estate (LBRE), is
responsible for reviewing and pri
oritizing capital project requests

based on "fiscal, funding, physical
and other constraints," according
to its website. Without a feasibility
study, a project cannot proceed to
the next stages of the development
process, which include program
ming, schematic design and, ulti
mately, construction.
While the project appears dead
for now, Purpur said the proposal
might be revisited in the future and
that he remains optimistic about
the potential for Stanford to get an
ice hockey rink on campus
"Even though the efforts to
build the rink were ultimately
unsuccessful, they demonstrated
the huge amount of alumni support
the team has," Werner wrote in a
statement to The Daily. "The team
is alive and well and always looking
for new players."
