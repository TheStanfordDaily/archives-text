## GSB average salaries rise, starting salaries fall 
### ANTHONY GHOSN 
Graduates of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) have enjoyed
consistently increasing average base
salaries for the past three years, according
to GSB reports. During the same time
period, however, the range of starting
salaries has decreased.
The average base salary for GSB grad
uates rose to about $129,000 from around
$llB,OOO between the 2009-10 and 2011-12
academic years. For 2009-10, the range of
salaries varied between $330,000 and
$40,000, while during the 2011-2012 aca
demic year the upper limit fall to $260,000
and the lower limit to $20,000.
Pulin Sanghvi MBA97, assistant dean

and director of the GSB's Career Manage
ment Center, attributed the range drop to
the business school's ability to prepare
students for a variety of fields.
"The statistical variation reflects dif
ferent choices students made and who
ended up reporting in on the optional sur
veys," Sanghvi said.
While schools such as the Columbia
Business School tend to send the majority
of their students into finance and consult
ing, Stanford has historically sought to
cultivate a variety of skills applicable
across a range of fields.
For example, 13 percent of the GSB's
Class of 2012 started or explored entre-
preneurial ventures, compared to 7 percent of
graduates at the Harvard Business School.
"The value of an MBA for a traditional
career path at a firm has decreased in recent
years," said Nicholas Flanders, an incoming stu
dent at the GSB and a former McKinsey &
Company analyst.
"However, the value of Stanford's MBA pro
gram for entrepreneurship has bucked that
trend, so these statistics have not affected my
decision to attend," he added.
Startup salaries are completely excluded
from the GSB's statistics, creating a nominal
drag. According to Sanghvi, the GSB doesn't
include startup salaries because it is governed
by widely practiced compensation reporting
guidelines. Those guidelines largely exclude
startup compensation on the grounds that equi

ty-based compensation can vary vastly in valua
tion.
In addition to emphasizing the variety of
industries entered by GSB graduates, Sanghvi
also cited the GSB's class size range of 360-390
students as a reason for the salary range drop.
"Dealing with such a small pool, there is
always variation at the top," Sanghvi said.
The declining range of salaries is also hardly
unique to Stanford, and has affected peer insti
tutions like the Wharton School of the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania. The Wharton School saw its
top salary range drop from a $350,000 upper
limit in 2010 to a $250,000 upper limit in 2012.
Even so, GSB graduates' average base
salary of roughly $129,000 remains above that of
peer institutions, with the Wharton School and
the Harvard Business School averaging around
$120,000. The US News and World Report cur
rently ranks the GSB as the nation's joint top
business school, tied with Harvard.
