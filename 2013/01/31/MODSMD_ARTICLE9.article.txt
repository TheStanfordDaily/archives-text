## Latina sorority hosts financial services aptitude examination 
### CATHERINE ZAW STAFF WRITER 
The Bloomberg Assessment Test (BAT), a stan
dardized exam open to all undergraduate and grad
uate students, was held on Jan. 30 in the Nitery
Theater. The free test, offered by the Bloomberg
Institute, is a multiple-choice exam on finance
knowledge and job-related skills. The results are
available to over 20,000 financial employers.
Stanford's chapter of Lambda Theta Nu, a
Latina-interest sorority, organized the test. The
sorority's chapters receive donations for their
philanthropic goal in the Stanford chapter's
case, Latino literacy from the Bloomberg
Institute based on the number of students who
take the test.
"On campus here, we have a partnership with
Bloomberg Institute," said Anahi Gonzalez 'l5,
president of Lambda Theta Nu's Stanford chap
ter. "We host the Bloomberg Assessment and
they provide us 10 dollars to our scholarship
fund for everyone that takes the test. For every
person that registers but does not take the test,
we receive a dollar. It's really awesome and the
company gives us money even though the stu
dents don't pay for the test that they take."
The BAT tests knowledge of economics, corpo
rate valuation and investment management as
well as job-related skills and activities such as
analytical reasoning, verbal skills and math skills.
According to the testing website, the BAT is
meant to connect students with employers while
effectively matching talents to available positions.
The sorority publicized and ran the logistics
of the assessment on its own, receiving support

only from sorority sisters in San Jose and the
Bay Area as well as from the Multicultural
Greek Community Counselor.
According to Gonzalez, anywhere from 20 to
50 students take the exam every year. Although
an independent proctor came in to help adminis
ter the three-hour exam last year, Gonzalez proc
tored the exam herself this year. The online
exam was made possible because the Bloomberg
Institute provided iPads for the test.
Tiffany Huoth 'l3, a management science and
engineering major, was one of the test takers.
"I took it because it sounded interesting how
you could find the potential employers through
this test," she said. "You can also figure out
where you're at since this test basically tests
your knowledge in all these areas. You could find
out where you stand through a class, but you
might fail that, but this test gives you an oppor
tunity to know that without the need to study
and where you stand naturally."
According to Gonzalez, the partnership
between the Bloomberg Institute, Lambda
Theta Nu and Stanford students is beneficial to
all parties.
"I wasn't the one that Bloomberg Institute
originally reached out to, but we hosted the test
last year as well," she said. "But I think they orig
inally reached out to us because they saw bringing
the test to Stanford as a good opportunity, which
says something good about our campus. Lambda
Theta Nu is fortunate to be able to work with
them while we help [to] give funding to students."
