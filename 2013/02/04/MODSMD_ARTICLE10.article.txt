## ON THE UPSWING AGAINST BEAVERS, TREES REMAIN TALL 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
With March just around the corner, the
Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team des
perately needed a quality win to get them back
on track and in tournament contention. A deci
sive 24-point victory over the lOth-ranked Ore
gon Ducks, who were undefeated in the Pac-12
at the time, seemed to do the trick.

The Cardinal (14-8,5-4 Pac-12), having final
ly earned conference-wide notoriety, needed to
avoid a let down against the Oregon State
Beavers (11-11, 1-8 Pac-12) at Maples Pavilion
on Sunday in order to remain in contention to
finish atop the Pac-12.
However, Stanford's route to a third straight
win would take on a different tone than the
physical, Jonny Dawkins-style of play. The sto
ry in this contest was the Cardinal's reliance on
the 3-point shot, an area in which it has strug
gled throughout the season.
Early on, the Cardinal looked like a shell of
the team that blew out Utah and Oregon in
back to back games. Stanford couldn't get any
thing going offensively, falling behind 8-0 with
16:45 in the first half, before a 3-pointer by
sophomore guard Chasson Randle ended the
drought. After senior Joe Burton knocked
down a pair of free throws to put the Beavers
up 17-12, the Card found its rhythm. On the
strength of the 3-point shot, Stanford went on a
quick 14-0 run to take a 26-17 lead. Randle and
junior forward John Gage hit respective threes
during the run.
The Cardinal then traded baskets with the
Beavers for the next few minutes, maintaining
a steady lead for the majority of the half. After
a free throw from Randle put Stanford up 35-
27, junior guard Roberto Nelson decided to
take matters into his own hands, hitting a 3-
point jumper and then converting on a 3-point
play The Card watched as its eight-point lead
shrunk to just a 35-33 advantage going into the
halftime break.
Stanford continued to thrive from beyond
the arc in the second half, as seemingly every 3-
point attempt went in. Still, Oregon State would
not go down without a fight, bullying the Cardi
nal in the paint to keep things interesting. After
Gage knocked down a jumper with 14:51
remaining to put Stanford up 51-45, the
Beavers orchestrated an 8-0 run to recapture
the lead.
Neither team managed to establish itself
from that point on, as Stanford and Oregon
State both failed to pull away Down three with
six minutes remaining, junior forward Josh
Huestis confidently knocked down a 3-point
shot to put the Card up 62-61. Oregon State
returned the favor, as Eric Moreland converted
on a lay up to give his Beavers the lead.
Once again, the 3-point line would prove to

be the Cardinal's strongest ally, as junior Aaron
Bright hit a shot from beyond the arc to recap
ture the lead. It was more of the same after
Oregon State went up 66-65, as junior Dwight
Powell decided to make his presence felt by
knocking down a pair of threes to put Stanford
up five. This would prove to be the dagger, as
Oregon State could not overcome this deficit.
The Card would eventually win 81-73, putting

the team above .500 in conference play for the
first time this season.
It is not difficult to determine Stanford's key
to victory in this contest. The Card shot 15-24
from the 3-point line, easily its best shooting
performance of the season. Randle led the way,
knocking down four of his six 3-point attempts

Junior outside hitter Steven Irvin (above) had 27 kills, propelling Stanford to a
3-2 victory over Hawaii on Friday. The Warriors repaid the favor the very next
day, avenging their loss with a hard-fought 3-2 win over the No. 3 Cardinal.
With March just around the corner, the
Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team des
perately needed a quality win to get them back
on track and in tournament contention. A deci
sive 24-point victory over the lOth-ranked Ore
gon Ducks, who were undefeated in the Pac-12
at the time, seemed to do the trick.

The Cardinal (14-8,5-4 Pac-12), having final
ly earned conference-wide notoriety, needed to
avoid a let down against the Oregon State
Beavers (11-11, 1-8 Pac-12) at Maples Pavilion
on Sunday in order to remain in contention to
finish atop the Pac-12.
However, Stanford's route to a third straight
win would take on a different tone than the
physical, Jonny Dawkins-style of play. The sto
ry in this contest was the Cardinal's reliance on
the 3-point shot, an area in which it has strug
gled throughout the season.
Early on, the Cardinal looked like a shell of
the team that blew out Utah and Oregon in
back to back games. Stanford couldn't get any
thing going offensively, falling behind 8-0 with
16:45 in the first half, before a 3-pointer by
sophomore guard Chasson Randle ended the
drought. After senior Joe Burton knocked
down a pair of free throws to put the Beavers
up 17-12, the Card found its rhythm. On the
strength of the 3-point shot, Stanford went on a
quick 14-0 run to take a 26-17 lead. Randle and
junior forward John Gage hit respective threes
during the run.
The Cardinal then traded baskets with the
Beavers for the next few minutes, maintaining
a steady lead for the majority of the half. After
a free throw from Randle put Stanford up 35-
27, junior guard Roberto Nelson decided to
take matters into his own hands, hitting a 3-
point jumper and then converting on a 3-point
play The Card watched as its eight-point lead
shrunk to just a 35-33 advantage going into the
halftime break.
Stanford continued to thrive from beyond
the arc in the second half, as seemingly every 3-
point attempt went in. Still, Oregon State would
not go down without a fight, bullying the Cardi
nal in the paint to keep things interesting. After
Gage knocked down a jumper with 14:51
remaining to put Stanford up 51-45, the
Beavers orchestrated an 8-0 run to recapture
the lead.
Neither team managed to establish itself
from that point on, as Stanford and Oregon
State both failed to pull away Down three with
six minutes remaining, junior forward Josh
Huestis confidently knocked down a 3-point
shot to put the Card up 62-61. Oregon State
returned the favor, as Eric Moreland converted
on a lay up to give his Beavers the lead.
