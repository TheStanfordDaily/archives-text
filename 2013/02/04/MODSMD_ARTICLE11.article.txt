## Card splits matches with Hawaii 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In what was certainly a dramat
ic weekend for the No. 3 Stanford
men's volleyball, the Cardinal
played 10 hard-fought sets against
the Hawaii Warriors, barely com
ing away with a win Friday night
before dropping a heartbreaker on
Saturday

Hawaii (4-7, 3-5 MPSF) was in
control for much of the first set on
Friday. Midway through, the Cardi
nal (7-3, 4-3) faced a 15-11 deficit
but refused to give in. Stanford
uncorked a 6-0 run, quickly seizing
control of the set. While the War
riors kept it close, Stanford was
able to win 25-23.
The Warriors again started the
next set off strong, with Stanford
struggling to play catch-up. Down
22-17, the Cardinal again made a
strong push, cutting the lead to one
behind a Hawaii error and three
kills from junior outside hitter
Steven Irvin.
This paved the way for the
important third set, which proved
to be one of the most dramatic
Stanford has played this season.
Both teams fought hard but strug
gled to gain an advantage over the
other. Hawaii seemed in position to
squeak out a win, but the Cardinal
absolutely refused to give in. Stan

ford faced eight set points and
managed to fight off each one of
them.
With Hawaii up 31-30, the
Cardinal tied the match back up
on a kill from senior opposite
Jake Kneller. Irvin followed that
with a kill of his own, before a
Hawaii error sealed the unbeliev
able 33-31 set victory for Stan
ford. Irvin played a crucial role in
the win, hammering eight of his
career-high 27 kills in the set
alone.
There was still volleyball to be
played, however, and Hawaii
made it clear they were not about
to concede victory, leading from
start to finish and taking the
fourth set 25-20.
The fifth set was all Stanford,
however. The Cardinal started on
a 5-2 run before putting the game
out of reach behind back-to-back
to-back kills from Irvin. The jun
ior absolutely killed the Warriors
in the final set with four kills and
two aces. Irvin, who hit an unbe
lievable .548 for the match, had
three aces on the match, as well
as eight digs.
Irvin's fellow junior outside
hitter Brian Cook also had an
impressive day, with 20 kills and
eight assists. At the same time,
freshman setter James Shaw had
53 assists while Kneller had a
double-double with 10 kills and 14
assists. Junior libero Grant Del
gado continued his strong defen
sive play of late, chipping in a
career-high 15 digs.
After all the drama from the
first night, there was still more
volleyball to be played on Satur
day. Stanford controlled the first
set from start to finish, winning

25-20, and seemed prepped to do
the same in the second before the
Hawaii offense woke up. The
Warriors unleashed an 8-1 run,
turning a 19-14 deficit into a 22-
20 lead, shocking the Cardinal
and taking the first set 25-23.
As a result, for the second
straight day Stanford and Hawaii
entered the third set tied, and
again Stanford managed to come
out with a victory. This time, how
ever, little drama unfolded as the
Cardinal led almost the entire
way, winning 25-21.
This gave Stanford the oppor
tunity to put the Warriors away
then and there, and Irvin certain
ly seemed determined to do so.
The junior added seven of his
match-high 22 kills in the set, put
ting Stanford in position to take
the set.
An ace from Irvin gave Stan
ford its first match point, 24-23,
but Hawaii opposite JP Marks
was able to answer with a kill of
his own, tying the score at 24. An
Irvin kill again gave Stanford the
match-point opportunity, but
Marks again tied the game up.
The Warriors then converted the
next two points, taking the fourth
set 27-25.
The game again came down to
a decisive fifth set. After its
incredible rally, however, the
momentum was firmly in Hawai
i's camp, as the Warriors led all
the way, taking the final set 15-11.
With the exception of Irvin,
the Cardinal had a poor night on
the offensive end, hitting a season
low .203. Despite this, the defense
was smothering, holding Hawaii
to a .187 hitting percentage.
Stanford will return home to
Maples Pavilion this weekend,
with matches against No. 2 UC-
Irvine and No. 13 UC-San Diego.

them.
With Hawaii up 31-30, the
Cardinal tied the match back up
on a kill from senior opposite
Jake Kneller. Irvin followed that
with a kill of his own, before a
Hawaii error sealed the unbeliev
able 33-31 set victory for Stan
ford. Irvin played a crucial role in
the win, hammering eight of his
career-high 27 kills in the set
alone.
There was still volleyball to be
played, however, and Hawaii
made it clear they were not about
to concede victory, leading from
start to finish and taking the
fourth set 25-20.
The fifth set was all Stanford,
however. The Cardinal started on
a 5-2 run before putting the game
out of reach behind back-to-back
to-back kills from Irvin. The jun
ior absolutely killed the Warriors
in the final set with four kills and
two aces. Irvin, who hit an unbe
lievable .548 for the match, had
three aces on the match, as well
as eight digs.
Irvin's fellow junior outside
hitter Brian Cook also had an
impressive day, with 20 kills and
eight assists. At the same time,
freshman setter James Shaw had
53 assists while Kneller had a
double-double with 10 kills and 14
assists. Junior libero Grant Del
gado continued his strong defen
sive play of late, chipping in a
career-high 15 digs.
After all the drama from the
first night, there was still more
volleyball to be played on Satur
day. Stanford controlled the first
set from start to finish, winning

25-20, and seemed prepped to do
the same in the second before the
Hawaii offense woke up. The
Warriors unleashed an 8-1 run,
turning a 19-14 deficit into a 22-
20 lead, shocking the Cardinal
and taking the first set 25-23.
As a result, for the second
straight day Stanford and Hawaii
entered the third set tied, and
again Stanford managed to come
out with a victory. This time, how
ever, little drama unfolded as the
Cardinal led almost the entire
way, winning 25-21.
This gave Stanford the oppor
tunity to put the Warriors away
then and there, and Irvin certain
ly seemed determined to do so.
The junior added seven of his
match-high 22 kills in the set, put
ting Stanford in position to take
the set.
An ace from Irvin gave Stan
ford its first match point, 24-23,
but Hawaii opposite JP Marks
was able to answer with a kill of
his own, tying the score at 24. An
Irvin kill again gave Stanford the
match-point opportunity, but
Marks again tied the game up.
The Warriors then converted the
next two points, taking the fourth
set 27-25.
The game again came down to
a decisive fifth set. After its
incredible rally, however, the
momentum was firmly in Hawai
i's camp, as the Warriors led all
the way, taking the final set 15-11.
With the exception of Irvin,
the Cardinal had a poor night on
the offensive end, hitting a season
low .203. Despite this, the defense
was smothering, holding Hawaii
to a .187 hitting percentage.
Stanford will return home to
Maples Pavilion this weekend,
with matches against No. 2 UC-
Irvine and No. 13 UC-San Diego.
