## Card splits matches with Hawaii 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
In what was certainly a dramat
ic weekend for the No. 3 Stanford
men's volleyball, the Cardinal
played 10 hard-fought sets against
the Hawaii Warriors, barely com
ing away with a win Friday night
before dropping a heartbreaker on
Saturday

Hawaii (4-7, 3-5 MPSF) was in
control for much of the first set on
Friday. Midway through, the Cardi
nal (7-3, 4-3) faced a 15-11 deficit
but refused to give in. Stanford
uncorked a 6-0 run, quickly seizing
control of the set. While the War
riors kept it close, Stanford was
able to win 25-23.
The Warriors again started the
next set off strong, with Stanford
struggling to play catch-up. Down
22-17, the Cardinal again made a
strong push, cutting the lead to one
behind a Hawaii error and three
kills from junior outside hitter
Steven Irvin.
This paved the way for the
important third set, which proved
to be one of the most dramatic
Stanford has played this season.
Both teams fought hard but strug
gled to gain an advantage over the
other. Hawaii seemed in position to
squeak out a win, but the Cardinal
absolutely refused to give in. Stan
