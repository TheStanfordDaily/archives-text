# DOWN WITH OREGON

### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After capturing Pac-12 Player
of the Week and two national
honors last week, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike had a lot of
attention pointed her way as the
No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team (20-2, 9-1) travelled to
Oregon over the weekend.
Ogwumike exploited the out
matched Oregon and Oregon
State teams to lead the Cardinal
in a successful weekend sweep.
She finished with 22 points and
13 rebounds in Friday's matchup
against the Ducks and had a

career-high 32 points with 18
rebounds against the Beavers.
The 86-62 rout of Oregon (3-8,
1-7) was not unexpected as the
Ducks currently sit in last place
in the Pac-12. The Card went to
work early on in its first road
game since Jan. 8 to gain a 23-6
lead in the first 10 minutes of
play
