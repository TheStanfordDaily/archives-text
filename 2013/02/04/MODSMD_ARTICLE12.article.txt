# DOWN WITH OREGON
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
After capturing Pac-12 Player
of the Week and two national
honors last week, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike had a lot of
attention pointed her way as the
No. 4 Stanford women's basket
ball team (20-2, 9-1) travelled to
Oregon over the weekend.
Ogwumike exploited the out
matched Oregon and Oregon
State teams to lead the Cardinal
in a successful weekend sweep.
She finished with 22 points and
13 rebounds in Friday's matchup
against the Ducks and had a

career-high 32 points with 18
rebounds against the Beavers.
The 86-62 rout of Oregon (3-8,
1-7) was not unexpected as the
Ducks currently sit in last place
in the Pac-12. The Card went to
work early on in its first road
game since Jan. 8 to gain a 23-6
lead in the first 10 minutes of
play

STANFORD 65
OREGON STATE 45
2/3, Corvallis, Ore.


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Junior forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) netted a career-high 32
points as No. 4 Stanford women's basketball took care of Oregon
State on Sunday night, capping off a successful Oregon road trip.
The Ducks, led by junior
guard Ariel Thomas (17
points), hit a three-pointer
just before half to put her
team within nine at halftime.
Freshman forward Jillian
Alleyne also helped the
Ducks by adding 13 points
and 13 rebounds.
Oregon could not keep up
the momentum after the
halftime break as a pair of
threes by junior guards Toni
Kokenis (six points, five
assists) and Sara James (11
points) put the game away.
With the contributions of
sophomore guards Taylor
Greenfield and Bonnie
Samuelson, Stanford hit 10
threes in the game.
Senior forward Joslyn
Tinkle had a stellar defen
sive and offensive game with
16 points, six rebounds and
four steals. Sophomore point
guard Amber Orrange had
nine points and nine assists
to lead the Stanford offense
to accumulate a season high
25 assists on 32 field goals.
Stanford leads the all
time series with Oregon, 45-

8, including 15 straight
against the Ducks dating
back to Feb. 24, 2005.
In addition, Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer
captured her 400 th Pac-12
win in Friday night's win.
VanDerveer is the only
coach in conference history
to win that many league
games, and in the middle of
her 27th season, she owns a
record of 401-59 against the
Pac-12 and has captured 20
conference titles.
The Card continued its
crushing play over Oregon
State (9-13,3-7) on Sunday
Stanford leads the all
time series with Oregon
State, 49-6, and has come out
on top in its past 25 games
against the Beavers. Oregon
State's last win in the series
came on Jan. 11, 2001.
Along with her career
high game in scoring, Ogwu
mike recorded her sixth con
secutive double-double to
lead the Card to a 65-45 win
over the Beavers.
Similar to the situation on
Friday night, the Card
jumped out to an early lead,
but allowed the Beavers to
cut the lead to 35-26 at half
time.
Ogwumike opened the
half with six-straight points,

and Samuelson hit consecu
tive threes to stretch the
Stanford lead to 49-28 in the
second half.
Oregon State wasn't
ready to throw in the towel
yet, though. Freshman
guard Jamie Weisner (13
points) and sophomore
guard Ali Gibson (12 points)
helped narrow the deficit to
54-42 with 6:53 to play. How
ever, the Card answered
with five-straight points and
never looked back.
Both teams shot impres
sively well —Stanford at 38.5
percent and Oregon State at
35.8 percent—considering
that they top the Pac-12 in
field goal percentage defens
es.
Orrange and Samuelson
combined for four three
pointers and had 12 points
apiece. Stanford did not see
the breadth of scoring from
the rest of the team as it did
against Oregon State aside
from Ogwumike, Orrange
and Samuelson.
The Card returns home
this weekend with games
against Arizona on Friday
and Arizona State on Sun
day.
