## Schaefer, Lee lead LA sweep 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK 
Only six days removed from a
huge weekend that saw the Cardi
nal defeat No. 20 Arizona State and
upset No. 6 Arizona to rocket them
from No. 8 to No. 2 in the NCAA
rankings, the Cardinal (7-1, 4-0
Pac-12) knew that an enormous
challenge lay ahead of them in a
two-day home stand against two
undefeated squads from Southern
California. Unconcerned, Stanford
held strong and rose to the occasion
in spectacular fashion.

After breaking several pool
records at UCLAs Spieker Aquatic
Center last year en route to a victo
ry, Stanford treated the home
crowd at Avery Aquatics Center to
a similar show as they rolled to a
165-135 victory over No. 12 UCLA
(11-2,5-2 Pae-12). It was the first of
two losses over the weekend for the
previously undefeated Bruin
squad, which dropped its seventh
straight dual meet against the Car
dinal, who claimed victory in 11 of
the 16 events in the meet.
Highlighting the Card's per
formance were record-breaking
efforts by sophomore Maddy
Schaefer in the 50-yard freestyle
and junior Felicia Lee in the 100-
yard backstroke. Schaefer's time of
22.27 in the 50 free narrowly edged

2/2, Avery Aquatic Center
out Liv Jensen's record of
22.39 set in 2008 to put
Schaefer in Avery Center's
record books. Freshman
Julia Ama and junior Alex
Whitford also contributed
strong showings in the 50
free to give the Cardinal a 1-
2-3 finish in the event.
Schaefer also contributed a
second-place finish in the
100-yard butterfly and was
part of Stanford's first-place
teams in both the 200-yard
freestyle relay and the 200-
yard medley relay.
Felicia Lee dominated,
claiming the Avery Center
record in the 100-yard back
stroke for the second year in
a row. Lee toppled her own
time of 53.03 set last year
with a 52.99 performance as
she out-touched senior Andi
Murez the victor in the
100 free by two seconds
and Bruin swimmer Katie
Kinnear by three. Lee also
claimed a convincing victory
in the 200 backstroke, beat
ing second-place Anna
Senko of UCLA by a margin
of more than two seconds.
The true test for the Car
dinal, however, came on Sat
urday as it geared up for a
clash with No. 1 USC Tro
jans (9-1, 5-1 Pac-12).

Although the Cardinal had
won the last 12 dual meets
against the Trojans, a streak
dating back to 2001, it
seemed like things might
turn out differently this year.
Long story short: they did
n't.
After Stanford honored
its six seniors in the
pregame Senior Day cere
monies, the Cardinal kicked
off the meet with a tremen
dous victory in the 400-yard
medley relay that gave the
team an early 13-4 lead. The
Cardinal held the lead and
finished with a 158-137 win
over the top-ranked team in
the country.
Junior Felicia Lee, who
had broken the pool record
for the 100-yard backstroke
on Friday against UCLA,
once again planted herself
firmly at the top of the pack
for that event. The junior
standout broke the record
for the second day in a row,
this time with a finishing
mark of 52.90. Lee capped
off her tremendous week
end with a first-place finish
in the 100-yard butterfly,
narrowly edging out USC
freshman Kendyl Stewart
for her fourth individual
first-place finish of the
weekend.
Senior Andi Murez, in
her last home appearance as
a part of Stanford's team,
finished in first in the 200-
yard freestyle and second in

the 100-yard freestyle (to
teammate Maddy Schaefer)
to go along with her first
place finish in the 100-yard
freestyle against UCLA on
Friday. Schaefer also added
a victory in the 50-yard
freestyle to cap off a record
setting weekend for the
sophomore.
Junior Maya Di√üado also
had a strong weekend, win
ning the 200 free on Friday
and the 200 backstroke on
Saturday. Freshman Sarah
Haase was impressive too,
emerging victorious in both
the 200 breaststroke on
Friday and the 100 back
stroke on Saturday. Junior
diver Stephanie Phipps
turned in yet another
strong showing, dominat
ing the 3-meter diving com
petition against UCLA and
emerging with a narrow vic
tory against USC.
Next weekend, the Cardi
nal travels across the Bay to
face defending national
champion Cal on Saturday at
noon as Stanford looks to
remain the only undefeated
team in Pac-12 play.
Although No. 7 Cal (6-2, 3-2
Pac-12) is looking uncharac
teristically shaky down the
stretch, the Cardinal should
have its hands full with the
Golden Bears in a tough
matchup.
