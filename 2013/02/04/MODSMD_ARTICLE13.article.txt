## Schaefer, Lee lead LA sweep 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK 
Only six days removed from a
huge weekend that saw the Cardi
nal defeat No. 20 Arizona State and
upset No. 6 Arizona to rocket them
from No. 8 to No. 2 in the NCAA
rankings, the Cardinal (7-1, 4-0
Pac-12) knew that an enormous
challenge lay ahead of them in a
two-day home stand against two
undefeated squads from Southern
California. Unconcerned, Stanford
held strong and rose to the occasion
in spectacular fashion.

After breaking several pool
records at UCLAs Spieker Aquatic
Center last year en route to a victo
ry, Stanford treated the home
crowd at Avery Aquatics Center to
a similar show as they rolled to a
165-135 victory over No. 12 UCLA
(11-2,5-2 Pae-12). It was the first of
two losses over the weekend for the
previously undefeated Bruin
squad, which dropped its seventh
straight dual meet against the Car
dinal, who claimed victory in 11 of
the 16 events in the meet.
Highlighting the Card's per
formance were record-breaking
efforts by sophomore Maddy
Schaefer in the 50-yard freestyle
and junior Felicia Lee in the 100-
yard backstroke. Schaefer's time of
22.27 in the 50 free narrowly edged
