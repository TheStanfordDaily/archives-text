# OPINIONS
## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN The 						First Annual Stanford list of Banished Words 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Each and every New Year's
Day since 1976, Lake Superi
or State University has
released its humorous "List of Words
to be Banished from the Queen's
English for Misuse, Overuse and
General Uselessness." Compiled
from submissions by disgruntled
word enthusiasts around the globe,
LSSU's banished words list now
serves as the gold standard for
determining which words have
become so cliched, vague, or mean
ingless as to warrant forcible expul
sion from the national lexicon.
"Maverick" made the list in 2009,
boosted by a wave of irritation
spawned by the 2008 election; so did
"bailout," "Wall Street/Main Street,"
and "first dude." The 2013 list includ
ed "YOLO," "fiscal cliff," and "trend
ing," joining earlier classics like
"awesome" (first banished in 1984,
re-banished due to chronic overuse
in 2007), "Y2K" (1999), and "To Be
Perfectly Honest With You" (1992).
Without further ado, I present to
you my 2013 "List of Words to be Ban
ished from Stanford Campus for Mis
use, Overuse and General Useless
ness." Feel free to add your own sub
missions (and criticize mine) via email
or in the online comments section.

"Problematic"
Since first clawing its way forth
from the slimy bowels of SLE, this
little face-sucker has evolved into a
fully formed alien invader, rampag
ing mercilessly around campus and
leaving in its wake the burning
wreckage of hundreds of formerly
thought-provoking discussion sec
tions.
Whatever original meaning
"problematic" once had has long
been lost in the foggy haze of bom
bast and grandiloquence. The word
now serves primarily as a preten
tious, pseudo-academic substitute for
"I don't like what you're saying,"
absolving the utterer of responsibili
ty of formulating a coherent, rational
objection to views with which she
may disagree. It has become an anti
intellectual vehicle for dismissing
opposing arguments without having
to clearly articulate why you actually
oppose them.
In the online comments section of
my colleague Adam Johnson's recent
piece on racism, for example, "prob
lematic" reared its foul head no less
than three times. "To equate histori
cal and current racist systems to
prejudicial name-calling and throw
them all under the same umbrella of
'racism' is 1. deeply problematic 2.
awfully condescending and 3 real
ly?" wrote one commenter.
"Other concepts such as bigotry
and prejudice are equally problemat
ic," insisted another. And a third
commenter dismissed the argument
that anti-white slurs and systemic
power imbalances can be lexically
conflated as "deeply problematic,"
without explaining why. In none of
these cases did the commenters
explain what precisely "problematic"
meant or how the concept con
tributed meaningfully to the discus-

sion. I expect this may be because
the inherent vagueness of the term
renders such an explanation impossi
ble.

"Start-up"
Real start-ups the original Sil
icon Valley engine for economic and
technological dynamism once
aspired to goals more meaningful
than applying a pseudo-antique filter
to the photo of this morning's funni
ly-shaped Philz' coffee foam. Real
start-ups, which once harnessed
technical creativity and ingenuity in
the service of progress, aimed to
accomplish objectives that made
human life easier and better, not
kitschier and more brainless.
Your CS group's recent relation
ship-finder app and Google belong to
the same "start-up" category in the
same way Chihuahuas and German
shepherds belong to the same
species—which is why "start-up,"
its original meaning twisted to suit
the needs of an app-obsessed gener
ation fascinated with inflated IPOs,
made the cut for this year's list of
banished words.

"Entrepreneurial"
See definition above.
"Interesting"
adj.
1. I didn't actually do the reading;
please please please don't call on me
again (use is particularly common in
IHUM/Thinkmg Matters sections).
2.1 don't much care what you have to
say.
3. Both of the above. Usage particu
larly common among freshmen.
"Activist"
A mark of merit once reserved
for the cadre of Stanford students
who cared enough to involve them
selves deeply in causes that brought
them no personal glory or benefit,
"activist" has since devolved into a
platitudinous buzzword capacious
enough to cover everything from
actually tutoring underserved chil
dren to organizing a poorly attended
speakers' panel on muskrat rights in
19th-century Bulgaria. Like its
equally generic catchphrase "entre
preneurship," "activism" has become
a vague category of do-goodership
that everyone is expected to emulate
but no one has ever clearly defined.
As Brendan O'Byrne pointed out
in his farewell last week, we need to
revive activism and make it mean
something real for Stanford.

As an entrepreneurial activist for
clear language use, Miles hopes
you've found this column interesting

Each and every New Year's
Day since 1976, Lake Superi
or State University has
released its humorous "List of Words
to be Banished from the Queen's
English for Misuse, Overuse and
General Uselessness." Compiled
from submissions by disgruntled
word enthusiasts around the globe,
LSSU's banished words list now
serves as the gold standard for
determining which words have
become so cliched, vague, or mean
ingless as to warrant forcible expul
sion from the national lexicon.
"Maverick" made the list in 2009,
boosted by a wave of irritation
spawned by the 2008 election; so did
"bailout," "Wall Street/Main Street,"
and "first dude." The 2013 list includ
ed "YOLO," "fiscal cliff," and "trend
ing," joining earlier classics like
"awesome" (first banished in 1984,
re-banished due to chronic overuse
in 2007), "Y2K" (1999), and "To Be
Perfectly Honest With You" (1992).
Without further ado, I present to
you my 2013 "List of Words to be Ban
ished from Stanford Campus for Mis
use, Overuse and General Useless
ness." Feel free to add your own sub
missions (and criticize mine) via email
or in the online comments section.

"Problematic"
Since first clawing its way forth
from the slimy bowels of SLE, this
little face-sucker has evolved into a
fully formed alien invader, rampag
ing mercilessly around campus and
leaving in its wake the burning
wreckage of hundreds of formerly
thought-provoking discussion sec
tions.
Whatever original meaning
"problematic" once had has long
been lost in the foggy haze of bom
bast and grandiloquence. The word
now serves primarily as a preten
tious, pseudo-academic substitute for
"I don't like what you're saying,"
absolving the utterer of responsibili
ty of formulating a coherent, rational
objection to views with which she
may disagree. It has become an anti
intellectual vehicle for dismissing
opposing arguments without having
to clearly articulate why you actually
oppose them.
In the online comments section of
my colleague Adam Johnson's recent
piece on racism, for example, "prob
lematic" reared its foul head no less
than three times. "To equate histori
cal and current racist systems to
prejudicial name-calling and throw
them all under the same umbrella of
'racism' is 1. deeply problematic 2.
awfully condescending and 3 real
ly?" wrote one commenter.
"Other concepts such as bigotry
and prejudice are equally problemat
ic," insisted another. And a third
commenter dismissed the argument
that anti-white slurs and systemic
power imbalances can be lexically
conflated as "deeply problematic,"
without explaining why. In none of
these cases did the commenters
explain what precisely "problematic"
meant or how the concept con
tributed meaningfully to the discus-

sion. I expect this may be because
the inherent vagueness of the term
renders such an explanation impossi
ble.

"Start-up"
Real start-ups the original Sil
icon Valley engine for economic and
technological dynamism once
aspired to goals more meaningful
than applying a pseudo-antique filter
to the photo of this morning's funni
ly-shaped Philz' coffee foam. Real
start-ups, which once harnessed
technical creativity and ingenuity in
the service of progress, aimed to
accomplish objectives that made
human life easier and better, not
kitschier and more brainless.
Your CS group's recent relation
ship-finder app and Google belong to
the same "start-up" category in the
same way Chihuahuas and German
shepherds belong to the same
species—which is why "start-up,"
its original meaning twisted to suit
the needs of an app-obsessed gener
ation fascinated with inflated IPOs,
made the cut for this year's list of
banished words.

"Entrepreneurial"
See definition above.
"Interesting"
adj.
1. I didn't actually do the reading;
please please please don't call on me
again (use is particularly common in
IHUM/Thinkmg Matters sections).
2.1 don't much care what you have to
say.
3. Both of the above. Usage particu
larly common among freshmen.
"Activist"
A mark of merit once reserved
for the cadre of Stanford students
who cared enough to involve them
selves deeply in causes that brought
them no personal glory or benefit,
"activist" has since devolved into a
platitudinous buzzword capacious
enough to cover everything from
actually tutoring underserved chil
dren to organizing a poorly attended
speakers' panel on muskrat rights in
19th-century Bulgaria. Like its
equally generic catchphrase "entre
preneurship," "activism" has become
a vague category of do-goodership
that everyone is expected to emulate
but no one has ever clearly defined.
