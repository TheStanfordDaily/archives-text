"Slaves living at the Cape were
emancipated on 1 December 1834,"
a third display said, adding below:
"BUT THEY WERE NOT
FREED."
Such read three displays in the
foyer of the Iziko Slave Lodge Muse
um that the BOSP Cape Town pro
gram visited two weeks ago.
Taken together, this narrative
offers is the most explicit connection
I have seen a publicly funded institu
tion make between former and mod
ern-day racial oppression, class
exploitation and multinational enter
prises.
With these displays in mind, I
expand upon the ideas I raised in last
week's column, "Overcoming the
Racist State."
The more refined questions I
seek to ask are: Why do institutions
that enabled structural inequality
under slavery, apartheid or Jim
Crow remain unchanged after such
systems become illegal? How can we
expect to eradicate structural
inequality when oppressive struc
tures remain firmly intact?
The South African apartheid
regime enacted a series of zoning
laws by race. In Cape Town, the
regime evicted all colored and black
people from valuable land in and
around the city center, demolished
their homes and relocated them to
sandy plains far outside the city.
The result today?
A geographically segregated
Cape Town that features mostly
white people living in the condos and
villas near the city center and along
the city's beaches, the majority of
the colored population living 20 miles
outside Cape Town in the township
of Mitchell's Plain, and the majority

of black Capetonians relegated even
further to Khayelitsha (now the
fastest-growing township in South
Africa), with many living in informal
settlements (ironically deemed ille
gal by the government, whose con
stitution guarantees adequate hous
ing).
Even though apartheid policies
have ended, its effects are still in
place. The regime that displaced and
structurally underdeveloped these
groups has been ousted, but the dis
placement and structural underde
velopment remain.
Next, we turn to the United
States.
Very simply put, nearly every
local, state and federal office of law
and "justice" is guilty of enacting or
enabling everything from the rape of
black women to the forcible separa
tion of families, to the legal murder
of thousands of African Americans,
to the structural underdevelopment
of the race.
Most of these things may now be
illegal, but that does not change the
fact that the institutions that were
designed to "serve and protect," to
"defend the Constitution" and to
"educate" in fact failed to do any of
these things; they were not punished
or held accountable for such actions
and they continue to exist with
the same fundamental structures
that they had during slavery, dur
ing Jim Crow, during apartheid.
Accordingly, we cannot have any
illusions that either "democracy" or
"justice" has ever existed in our
contexts. We might have something
like "democracy" or "almost jus
tice," but not the things them
selves.
And we won't have "the real

deal" until we recognize the inher
ent structural connection between
racial oppression, class exploitation
and the profit of the state and/or
corporation.
The same racist capitalism and
"democracy" that utilized coerced
slave labor for profit (or murdered
indigenous people for land) then
underdeveloped black life for the
purposes of low-cost wage labor.
Following civil rights legislation and
the globalization that we're used to
today, the racist logic of capital
shifted south, west and east, to uti
lize Third World labor (which is nec
essarily black and brown) to serve
the same ends. So we wind up with
underemployment and structural
unemployment of poor and working
class blacks (who are no longer
needed by the system), and the use
of migrant groups and the global
south for cheap labor.
Class oppression becomes tied
up with racial oppression across
most minority groups. Poor whites,
who have historically resisted
organization under unions out of
refusal to work with black workers,
also get the short end of the stick
due to racism.
Slave labor has been replaced
by (low) wage labor, and we can't let
ourselves be blinded by the success
of individual minorities —or by
their recent inclusion in formerly
exclusive structures, so long as this
success is supported by the struc
tural failure (or "almost success")
of other people.
As one of the panels at the Slave
Lodge Museum concluded, "THEY
FOUGHT FOR THEIR SUR
VIVAL AND INSPIRED OTH
ERS TO RESIST SLAVERY."
We have to keep fighting for a
better world.

and "justice" is guilty of enacting or
enabling everything from the rape of
black women to the forcible separa
tion of families, to the legal murder
of thousands of African Americans,
to the structural underdevelopment
of the race.
Most of these things may now be
illegal, but that does not change the
fact that the institutions that were
designed to "serve and protect," to
"defend the Constitution" and to
"educate" in fact failed to do any of
these things; they were not punished
or held accountable for such actions
and they continue to exist with
the same fundamental structures
that they had during slavery, dur
ing Jim Crow, during apartheid.
Accordingly, we cannot have any
illusions that either "democracy" or
"justice" has ever existed in our
contexts. We might have something
like "democracy" or "almost jus
tice," but not the things them
selves.
And we won't have "the real

deal" until we recognize the inher
ent structural connection between
racial oppression, class exploitation
and the profit of the state and/or
corporation.
The same racist capitalism and
"democracy" that utilized coerced
slave labor for profit (or murdered
indigenous people for land) then
underdeveloped black life for the
purposes of low-cost wage labor.
Following civil rights legislation and
the globalization that we're used to
today, the racist logic of capital
shifted south, west and east, to uti
lize Third World labor (which is nec
essarily black and brown) to serve
the same ends. So we wind up with
underemployment and structural
unemployment of poor and working
class blacks (who are no longer
needed by the system), and the use
of migrant groups and the global
south for cheap labor.
Class oppression becomes tied
up with racial oppression across
most minority groups. Poor whites,
who have historically resisted
organization under unions out of
refusal to work with black workers,
also get the short end of the stick
due to racism.
Slave labor has been replaced
by (low) wage labor, and we can't let
ourselves be blinded by the success
of individual minorities —or by
their recent inclusion in formerly
exclusive structures, so long as this
success is supported by the struc
tural failure (or "almost success")
of other people.
As one of the panels at the Slave
Lodge Museum concluded, "THEY
FOUGHT FOR THEIR SUR
VIVAL AND INSPIRED OTH
ERS TO RESIST SLAVERY."
We have to keep fighting for a
better world.
