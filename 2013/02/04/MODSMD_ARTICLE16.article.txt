## On Food Trucks, Don't Let Bureaucracy Override our Commitment to Community 
### MATT LAMKIN Fellow, Stariford Law School 
Arranging catering used to be
the worst part of my other
wise-fantastic job as a fellow
at the Law School until I met
Chon Vo.
Chon has run his "Net Appetit"
food truck at Stanford since
2001. Because his food was afford
able and delicious, I started asking
Chon to cater our events. Unlike
many other caterers we've used,
Chon was always a consummate
professional, delivering fabulous
food with incredible service. But
because he is also modest and soft
spoken, it took me a year to discov
er that he's also an entrepreneurial
philanthropist. An MIT grad, Chon
used the proceeds from Net Appetit
to feed orphans in Vietnam.
So I am saddened and frustrated
that the administration has expelled
Chon from campus not for any
violation, but simply because the
University has a new food-truck
policy and Net Appetit isn't part of
the new plan. As The Daily report
ed on Thursday, the University has
contracted with a company called
Off The Grid to issue permits for
food trucks on campus. The admin
istration notified Chon of this
change just a week before the Uni
versity closed for winter break.
When Chon scrambled to apply to

Off The Grid, the company told him
all available food-truck spots were
already taken.
When Chon advised the adminis
tration of his plight, its response
was essentially, "Thanks for your
great contributions, but tough
luck." In rebuffing Chon's appeal
for help, Vice President for Busi
ness Affairs Randy Livingston
acknowledged "the excellent food
and quality service you have provid
ed for many years through the Net
Appetit food truck, and that you use
much of the proceeds for charitable
purposes."
But Mr. Livingston assured
Chon that "Stanford's new program
for food trucks was the result of
several months of deliberation" and
was "approved [by] the University
President, with support from his
senior management team." The
orphans may go hungry, but they
can take solace in knowing the
proper procedures were followed.
To put it mildly, this is not the
way we should treat someone who
has been a stalwart member of the
Stanford community for more than
a decade. Nor is the decision to cut
off the flow of money to orphans in
keeping with our mission "to pro
mote the public welfare by exercis
ing an influence in behalf of human
ity." And on a personal level, Chon
simply deserves better than to be
ejected from campus without cause
and with almost no notice.

It is particularly disturbing that
the administration didn't see fit to
respond to The Daily's request for
an interview about its actions. If the

University feels justified in
expelling a longtime community
member and putting a charitable
enterprise out of operation, it
should jump at the opportunity to
explain. It is hard to believe the
University finds these circum
stances so unimportant that they do
not merit 10 minutes of an adminis
trator's time.
In an institution the size of Stan
ford, it is inevitable that some gen
erally sensible policies will have
negative unintended consequences
for particular stakeholders. But
when the administration learns that
its actions are having such devastat
ing effects, it is unacceptable to
respond with the reliable standby of
bureaucrats everywhere: "Sorry,
that's our policy."
In this case, that defense rings
especially hollow since the Univer
sity has expressly reserved the
right to change its food-truck policy
at any time, "in Stanford's sole dis
cretion." In other words, there is
simply no reason why the adminis
tration cannot allow Net Appetit
back onto campus.
I applaud Stanford for experi
menting with new ways to promote
a variety of excellent food options
on campus. But like any experi
ment, this one can only succeed if
the administration is willing to
learn from it. Let's treat our com
munity members with the respect
they deserve and bring Net Appetit
back to Stanford.
