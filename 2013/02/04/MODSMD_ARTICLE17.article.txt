# Not Just Another Summer Internship

The symptoms of summer
internship-search season are
everywhere: students walking
around in business clothes, comput
er clusters printing dozens of
resumes and inboxes receiving an
alarming surge in emails.
Depending on how many of
those ever-increasing emails you've
read, you may have heard about
Stanford in Government (SIG) fel
lowships and stipends. Through
these fellowships, you are funded to
work at one of thirty-six different
public policy organizations in Cali
fornia, Washington, D.C., and
across five continents, in areas
including democratic development,
finance, education, history, the envi
ronment and human rights.
In contrast, stipends fund stu
dents who have found their own
unpaid policy internships and are
just getting started in policy
especially underclassmen and those
in non-policy majors. With both pro
grams, you get paid to undertake
meaningful work wilting memos,
briefing officials, creating propos
als, researching for publications
and more.
It's true that Stanford students
have a wealth of attractive opportu
nities available to them. Consulting
in the market can be lucrative, for
example but what about design
ing an efficient structure for the
market with the Reserve Bank of
India? Coding for a start-up can be

a rush, but so can working on a
stipend to help public agencies
incorporate technological innova
tions.
Investigating in a lab can bring
new techniques for safeguarding
the environment, but what about
making sure these discoveries get
put to use with the California Gov
ernor's Office of Planning and
Research Fellowship? Volunteering
on the ground in a developing coun
try can be formative, but what
about increasing government trans
parency and accountability through
Global Integrity?
Public policy is about solving the
largest, hardest and most interdis
ciplinary problems those that
must be tackled at the macro-level
and are not or cannot be addressed
by the private sector. It's about nav
igating the most difficult conflicts,
whether they be economic growth
and environmental sustainability,
social spending and fiscal restraint,
or privacy and security.
And SlG's fellowships and
stipends are a crucial and distinc
tive piece of the efforts at Stanford
to draw students towards public
service. Summer opportunities
abound for researching a specific
subject on campus, working in
industry or doing fieldwork off cam
pus; however, few options allow stu
dents to take their major and work
with it through the lens of real
world policy. Further, as student
orchestrated summer programs,
fellowships and stipends uniquely
