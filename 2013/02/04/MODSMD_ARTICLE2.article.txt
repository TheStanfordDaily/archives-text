# Grant to fund capstones
## UAR and VPUE launch a grant for interdisciplinary reflections 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR)
and the Office of the Vice Provost of Undergradu
ate Education (VPUE) have launched a new Senior
Synthesis grant intended to help rising seniors
integrate and reflect on their time at Stanford. Stu
dents have until March 1 to apply.
The grant will allow students to create a cap
stone project connecting all their academic and
extracurricular Stanford experiences in one place,
reflecting the Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford's (SUES) call for more integrative and
interdisciplinary learning projects.
While the impetus for the new grant program
stems largely from the SUES committee's presen
tation to the Faculty Senate in January 2012, Brian
Thomas, associate dean of UAR, said that the
underlying support for the program stemmed from
an array of unconventional or integrative grant

proposals that UAR had turned down in previous
years.
"We wanted to find away to support really com
pelling student projects that weren't clearly in pur
suit of a research agenda or a public service agen
da," Thomas said.
The synthesis grant is unique not only in its ful
ly interdisciplinary nature but also because it will
allow students to apply as a team for a collaborative
project. Thomas cited the work of a group of engi
neering students whose initial request for grant
funding was turned down currently working
with UAR on a pre-pilot trial as evidence of the
grant's potential.
The students' project involves the construction
of a mobile demonstration lab illustrating tech
niques for synthesizing biodiesel fuel that they
hope to bring to area schools and across the Uni
versity campus for public educational exhibitions.

Jonathan Berger and Rob Reich field questions after the SUES report at the
Faculty Senate meeting in which UAR and VPUE launched the new grant.
While the engineering
students' project is currently
the only one that UAR over
sees, Thomas said that this
year's pilot program was an
opportunity to gauge the
range of projects students
are interested in pursuing.
"It's a little bit of a chick
en-and-egg problem right
now," Thomas said.
In the meantime, UAR is
creating a set of guidelines
that faculty mentors and
UAR advisors can use to
help students craft a synthe
sis project proposal.
Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education Harry
Elam expressed anticipation
for this year's grant propos
als and his hope that the new
grant would encourage stu
dents to connect experiences
within their major, like elec
trical engineering, to other
activities, like past fellow
ships from the Haas Center
for Public Service.
Elam asserted that Stan
ford students often lack the
time to reflect on what they
explored and learned during
their undergraduate experi
ence, and he said that the
synthesis grant could be a
means of countering that
lack of perspective.
"We see it becoming a
signature Stanford thing,"
Elam said.
Students that work on a
synthesis project would have
to present a final product
that can take on almost any
form, including opinion
essays, workshops or travel
ing displays that can effec-

tively communicate the stu
dents' goals and inspire oth
ers to think about pursuing
their own capstone project.
"We see the projects as
giving something back to the
Stanford community," Thomas
said.
Elam also highlighted the
professional value of the syn
thesis grant, saying that a
synthesis project would pre
pare a student to become an
adaptive learner at a time
when career requirements
are constantly changing and
professions require more
creative thinking.
"It doesn't just prepare
you for one job, and it may
help you get that job, but it
prepares you, in a sense, for
a career," Elam said.
Even though only rising
seniors are eligible for the
grant, all undergraduate
academic departments and
advisors were notified of the
program. Thomas framed
the outreach as a means of
increasing awareness and
encouraging students to
think more about the long
term direction of their Stan
ford experience.
