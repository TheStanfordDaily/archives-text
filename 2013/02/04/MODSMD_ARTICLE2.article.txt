# Grant to fund capstones
## UAR and VPUE launch a grant for interdisciplinary reflections 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Undergraduate Advising and Research (UAR)
and the Office of the Vice Provost of Undergradu
ate Education (VPUE) have launched a new Senior
Synthesis grant intended to help rising seniors
integrate and reflect on their time at Stanford. Stu
dents have until March 1 to apply.
The grant will allow students to create a cap
stone project connecting all their academic and
extracurricular Stanford experiences in one place,
reflecting the Study of Undergraduate Education
at Stanford's (SUES) call for more integrative and
interdisciplinary learning projects.
While the impetus for the new grant program
stems largely from the SUES committee's presen
tation to the Faculty Senate in January 2012, Brian
Thomas, associate dean of UAR, said that the
underlying support for the program stemmed from
an array of unconventional or integrative grant

proposals that UAR had turned down in previous
years.
"We wanted to find away to support really com
pelling student projects that weren't clearly in pur
suit of a research agenda or a public service agen
da," Thomas said.
The synthesis grant is unique not only in its ful
ly interdisciplinary nature but also because it will
allow students to apply as a team for a collaborative
project. Thomas cited the work of a group of engi
neering students whose initial request for grant
funding was turned down currently working
with UAR on a pre-pilot trial as evidence of the
grant's potential.
The students' project involves the construction
of a mobile demonstration lab illustrating tech
niques for synthesizing biodiesel fuel that they
hope to bring to area schools and across the Uni
versity campus for public educational exhibitions.
