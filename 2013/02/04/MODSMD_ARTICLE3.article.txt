## Journalists map money in politics Bicoastal project combines Stanford, Columbia students 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Approximately 60 members of the
Stanford community and 25 Bay Area
residents gathered at Wallenberg Hall
on Saturday and Sunday to participate
in Stanford's second "Datafest," which
focused on studying the impact of mon
ey in politics.
The event, which was sponsored by
the Brown Institute for Media Innova
tion, was replicated at Columbia Uni
versity as a part of the institute's
bicoastal efforts and was hosted at Stan
ford by the Graduate Program in Jour
nalism.
Participants formed 11 teams to cre
ate projects analyzing political and eco
nomic data and exploring issues such as
whether money can buy an election,
how political apathy is related to cam
paign contributions and the degree to
which Silicon Valley contributes to polit
ical campaigns. The teams presented
their work to a panel of six Stanford
affiliated judges on Sunday afternoon.
'Amazing things can happen in a
really short time," said Bernd G-irod, the
institute's director and a competition
judge. "All of the teams have done ter
rific work, and we all are blown away by
how much good and interesting and
exciting work has been done over this
weekend."
"The idea was to try to create some
thing where we could have this event on
both coasts with contributions from the
graduate journalism program and other
interested parties," said Ann Grimes,
director of the Graduate Program in
Journalism. "It is an important event
for our collective fields of journalism
and technology to push journalism for
ward."
Judges at Stanford awarded "Best in
Innovation," "Best in Potential" and
"Best in Insight" prizes, giving $l,OOO to
each winning team. The Stanford and
Columbia audiences voted on their top
presentation, which was subsequently
live streamed to the other school before
both audiences voted for the best over
all project.
Columbia's "FMS Symphony" proj
ect which created a searchable data
base of the federal government's daily
expenditures received the best over
all project award, beating Stanford's
top-voted "Revolving Dollar Washing
ton" group with 63 votes to 20. All 43
participants at Columbia voted for the
Columbia project, while Stanford's
audience was equally split between the
Columbia and Stanford projects.
The winner of Stanford's "Best in
Innovation" prize was "Disclosures,"
with the "Money in the Valley" project
receiving the "Best in Insight" award
and the "Does Money Win Elections?"
project receiving the "Best in Potential"
award.
Marc Joffe, a principal consultant at
Public Sector Credit Solu
tions in San Francisco and a
member of the "Congres
sional Financial Disclosures"
team, said he first heard of
Datafest while reading a blog
about financial industry
reform. After looking at the
list of potential projects on
the Datafest website, he
reached out to Fergus Pitt, a
participant in the Columbia
Datafest, to create a bicoastal
team examining how con
gressional investment per
formance compares to mar
ket averages.
"I thought it would be a
great opportunity to meet
other people who are inter
ested in finance and politics
and technology, a nexus that
I find particularly attrac
tive," Joffe said.
Although judges praised
the team's bicoastal collabo
ration, Joffe said that coordi
nating with team members at
Columbia wasn't difficult.
"It was just a matter of
dividing up the work," Joffe
said. "We took control of the
data collection, and they took
control of the presentation
and the storytelling."
Joshua Loftus, Weijie Su,
Xiaoying Tian and Qingyuan
Zhao, who are all pursuing
doctoral degrees in statistics
at Stanford, won the "Best in
Potential" award for their
project, which attempted to
determine whether or not
money could buy an election.
Loftus said that, although
the team ran into some
unforeseen difficulties, he
enjoyed the Datafest experi
ence and would participate
again next year.
"It was very interesting,"
Loftus reflected. "It's more
inconvenient to actually get
the data that you want than
we are used to, because we
usually are just doing statisti
cal analysis after the data has
been compiled. Otherwise,
it's been fun. I think it was a
learning experience for all of
us."
In his concluding
remarks, Girod spoke about
the importance of bringing
people together to tell sto
ries, particularly with the use
of technology.
'A university is a place
where you bring people
together," he said. "I think
what we have done this week
end here at Stanford and at
Columbia University is one of
the noblest things that a uni
versity can do, really bring
people together and build
connections and bridge dif
ferent areas."

team, said he first heard of
Datafest while reading a blog
about financial industry
reform. After looking at the
list of potential projects on
the Datafest website, he
reached out to Fergus Pitt, a
participant in the Columbia
Datafest, to create a bicoastal
team examining how con
gressional investment per
formance compares to mar
ket averages.
"I thought it would be a
great opportunity to meet
other people who are inter
ested in finance and politics
and technology, a nexus that
I find particularly attrac
tive," Joffe said.
Although judges praised
the team's bicoastal collabo
ration, Joffe said that coordi
nating with team members at
Columbia wasn't difficult.
"It was just a matter of
dividing up the work," Joffe
said. "We took control of the
data collection, and they took
control of the presentation
and the storytelling."
Joshua Loftus, Weijie Su,
Xiaoying Tian and Qingyuan
Zhao, who are all pursuing
doctoral degrees in statistics
at Stanford, won the "Best in
Potential" award for their
project, which attempted to
determine whether or not
money could buy an election.
Loftus said that, although
the team ran into some
unforeseen difficulties, he
enjoyed the Datafest experi
ence and would participate
again next year.
"It was very interesting,"
Loftus reflected. "It's more
inconvenient to actually get
the data that you want than
we are used to, because we
usually are just doing statisti
cal analysis after the data has
been compiled. Otherwise,
it's been fun. I think it was a
learning experience for all of
us."
In his concluding
remarks, Girod spoke about
the importance of bringing
people together to tell sto
ries, particularly with the use
of technology.
'A university is a place
where you bring people
together," he said. "I think
what we have done this week
end here at Stanford and at
Columbia University is one of
the noblest things that a uni
versity can do, really bring
people together and build
connections and bridge dif
ferent areas."
