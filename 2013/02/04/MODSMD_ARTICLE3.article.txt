## Journalists map money in politics Bicoastal project combines Stanford, Columbia students 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Approximately 60 members of the
Stanford community and 25 Bay Area
residents gathered at Wallenberg Hall
on Saturday and Sunday to participate
in Stanford's second "Datafest," which
focused on studying the impact of mon
ey in politics.
The event, which was sponsored by
the Brown Institute for Media Innova
tion, was replicated at Columbia Uni
versity as a part of the institute's
bicoastal efforts and was hosted at Stan
ford by the Graduate Program in Jour
nalism.
Participants formed 11 teams to cre
ate projects analyzing political and eco
nomic data and exploring issues such as
whether money can buy an election,
how political apathy is related to cam
paign contributions and the degree to
which Silicon Valley contributes to polit
ical campaigns. The teams presented
their work to a panel of six Stanford
affiliated judges on Sunday afternoon.
'Amazing things can happen in a
really short time," said Bernd G-irod, the
institute's director and a competition
judge. "All of the teams have done ter
rific work, and we all are blown away by
how much good and interesting and
exciting work has been done over this
weekend."
"The idea was to try to create some
thing where we could have this event on
both coasts with contributions from the
graduate journalism program and other
interested parties," said Ann Grimes,
director of the Graduate Program in
Journalism. "It is an important event
for our collective fields of journalism
and technology to push journalism for
ward."
Judges at Stanford awarded "Best in
Innovation," "Best in Potential" and
"Best in Insight" prizes, giving $l,OOO to
each winning team. The Stanford and
Columbia audiences voted on their top
presentation, which was subsequently
live streamed to the other school before
both audiences voted for the best over
all project.
Columbia's "FMS Symphony" proj
ect which created a searchable data
base of the federal government's daily
expenditures received the best over
all project award, beating Stanford's
top-voted "Revolving Dollar Washing
ton" group with 63 votes to 20. All 43
participants at Columbia voted for the
Columbia project, while Stanford's
audience was equally split between the
Columbia and Stanford projects.
The winner of Stanford's "Best in
Innovation" prize was "Disclosures,"
with the "Money in the Valley" project
receiving the "Best in Insight" award
and the "Does Money Win Elections?"
project receiving the "Best in Potential"
award.
