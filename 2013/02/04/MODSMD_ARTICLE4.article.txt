## Despite 500 added bike racks, parking still scarce 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
Parking and Transportation Services
(P&TS) has added 500 bike racks across
Stanford annually over the last two years in
response to a 2011 study mapping the den
sity of bikes parked on campus. Currently,
the University has 18,345 bike parking
spaces, distributed across 1,753 separate bike
racks.
Despite efforts to improve bicycle facili
ties and infrastructureâ€”which has been
recognized by the League of American Bicy
clists with a "Platinum" award in both 2011
and 2012 cyclists have continued to
express frustration about the distribution
and location of bicycle parking spaces on cam
pus, citing resulting issues like a large num
ber of bike thefts.
"It's hard to get a space on a bike rack
whenever I need one," said Clarence Chio 'l4,
resident computer consultant in Cardenal.
"It's just a bad situation," agreed Roxy
Carbonell 'l4. "If I had had a bike rack avail
able, I could have locked my bike to one and
wouldn't have had it stolen."
Space limitations constitute a principle
obstacle to adding new bike racks to campus,

according to Ariadne Scott, the University's
bicycle program coordinator. Scott cited the
lack of space around the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building and the Hewlett Teaching Cen
ter as an example of a constraint on P&TS's
efforts to meet a surge in demand for bike
racks.
"Some of the areas, like Gates and
Hewlett, we continue to study since there are
limitations with adding racks due to space
everyone wants to park close to the building,"
Scott said.
"You have to make sure circulation is not
compromised," she added. "We also have
racks on the front and sides of the building,
and we have capacity there, but people who
pull up late to class will just kickstand-park
their bikes, lock and go to class. If they
walked a few feet away, they would find a
parking space."
Reconsidering how bike racks are laid out
might provide an alternate solution for areas
like those by Gates, Huang and Y2E2
that suffer from limited space and high bike
traffic, according to Scott.

In response to a 2011 study mapping the density of
bike parking on campus, the University has installed
500 new bike racks. University officials hope more
bike racks will also help suppress bike theft numbers.
