## Despite 500 added bike racks, parking still scarce 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
Parking and Transportation Services
(P&TS) has added 500 bike racks across
Stanford annually over the last two years in
response to a 2011 study mapping the den
sity of bikes parked on campus. Currently,
the University has 18,345 bike parking
spaces, distributed across 1,753 separate bike
racks.
Despite efforts to improve bicycle facili
ties and infrastructureâ€”which has been
recognized by the League of American Bicy
clists with a "Platinum" award in both 2011
and 2012 cyclists have continued to
express frustration about the distribution
and location of bicycle parking spaces on cam
pus, citing resulting issues like a large num
ber of bike thefts.
"It's hard to get a space on a bike rack
whenever I need one," said Clarence Chio 'l4,
resident computer consultant in Cardenal.
"It's just a bad situation," agreed Roxy
Carbonell 'l4. "If I had had a bike rack avail
able, I could have locked my bike to one and
wouldn't have had it stolen."
Space limitations constitute a principle
obstacle to adding new bike racks to campus,

according to Ariadne Scott, the University's
bicycle program coordinator. Scott cited the
lack of space around the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building and the Hewlett Teaching Cen
ter as an example of a constraint on P&TS's
efforts to meet a surge in demand for bike
racks.
"Some of the areas, like Gates and
Hewlett, we continue to study since there are
limitations with adding racks due to space
everyone wants to park close to the building,"
Scott said.
"You have to make sure circulation is not
compromised," she added. "We also have
racks on the front and sides of the building,
and we have capacity there, but people who
pull up late to class will just kickstand-park
their bikes, lock and go to class. If they
walked a few feet away, they would find a
parking space."
Reconsidering how bike racks are laid out
might provide an alternate solution for areas
like those by Gates, Huang and Y2E2
that suffer from limited space and high bike
traffic, according to Scott.
Over the past two years, the University

In response to a 2011 study mapping the density of
bike parking on campus, the University has installed
500 new bike racks. University officials hope more
bike racks will also help suppress bike theft numbers.
has been attempting to
address areas that a 2011
study revealed had a high
demand for bike parking
spaces. The study was initiated
by staff at the Branner Earth
Science Library, as a part of
their geospatial program.
"It was actually a student
who started this as a project,
which was funded through a
grant paid by Stanford Uni
versity Libraries," Scott not
ed.
Most of the study was con
ducted using geospatial maps
already in the library's posses
sion. This was effective,
according to Scott, because "it
is very costly to collect data
about this."
Now, P&TS has a map of
the bike racks on campus
updated as time allows.
"Our study concluded that
the highest density of bikes
parked on bike racks was
around the Main Quad,
Huang, Y2E2, Packard, Gates,
Beckman and Clark Center,"
Scott said.
"There's a lot of expansion
at the Knight Management
Center, where we've added
capacity," she added. "We've
also done a lot of renovation
along Panama Mall, in front
of the d.school [Design
School], and at the same time,

in addition to bike parking,
we're adding bike lockers, tai
lored towards people com
muting by bike."
University administrators
hope that this new distribu
tion of racks will help bring
down bike theft figures from
the 329 bikes reported
stolen last year. The Depart
ment of Public Safety has
also recently announced a
bike theft focus group of offi
cers that will help study the
problem as well.
One of the main focuses of
the program has been to
replace older styles of bike
racks with the newer kind,
called the "lightning bolt"
design, according to Scott.
The goal is to replace all cur
rent bike racks with new
"lightning bolt" style bike
racks in the next five to seven
years.
"There are multiple styles
of bike racks the lightning
bolt one is the kind you see in
the Main Quad in bike parking
areas," Scott said. 'Athletics
has a different style rack, a tri
angular one. Old-style racks
are in a lot of the housing
areas."
The University bicycle pro
gram does not manage bike
racks in Student Housing.
"Housing takes care of
their own racks," Scott said.
"We do make recommenda
tions to them, though."
