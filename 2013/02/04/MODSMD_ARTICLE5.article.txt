# Q&A
## Diamond on democracy activists 
### BENJAMIN PHAM 
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO is a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and the direc
tor of the Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law.
Diamond's work as a democracy
advocate inspired the recently
released documentary "A Whisper
to a Roar," which explores the per

sonal stories of democracy activists
in Egypt, Malaysia, Ukraine,
Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
The documentary, for which
Diamond was a producer, won high
praise from critics and leaders like
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
who commented that "the film is
not only a riveting documentary,
but also offers inspiration to people
everywhere who seek to make gov

ernments accountable to the citi
zens they serve." The Daily spoke
with Diamond about the film's ori
gins, its critical reception and its
future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
and when did you come in con
tact with [director] Ben Moses
about making this film?
Larry Diamond (LD): Ben is a

documentary filmmaker who did
[1997 Oscar-nominated film] "Good
Morning, Vietnam" based on his
personal experience in Vietnam. I
came to know him through a mutu
al friend some years ago. We sim
ply stayed in touch and when my
book "The Spirit of Democracy"
came out, I sent him a copy. Even-
tually, he approached me with an inter
est in making a documentary that would
in some way capture the themes and
if I can say the spirit of the book that
I had written.

TSD: What was your role in making
the documentary?
LD: I was involved in framing the
content of the film. There were a few of
us who met intensively to ask what
themes we wanted to address, how were
we going to cinematically display those
themes and what countries were we
going to feature in the film. When we
decided on the themes, then we had to
decide whom we were going to inter
view. I was on-site for some of the coun
try filming, and worked closely with the
director on all of the content issues from
beginning to end.

TSD: Why those countries in particu
lar? Viewers would have a strong
interest in Egyptian democracy due
to the Arab Spring, I imagine, but
why the others?
LD: We selected Egypt before the
Arab Spring. In fact, we were largely
done by the time the Arab Spring erupt
ed. We wanted to depict and explore
countries that were in the midst of dem
ocratic struggles. We wanted to look at
countries that were geographically
diverse, but also diverse regarding
where they stand now in the struggle
for democracy and diverse in terms of
the types of political systems that they
have.
We have a country that's achieved a
very inspiring breakthrough into
democracy: Ukraine. We have a country
that had been a democracy and then lost
it, and then is now struggling to achieve
it: Venezuela. We have a country that
has some multiparty competition, but
also has a very authoritarian dominant
party, and is possibly on the cusp of
democracy: Malaysia. We have a coun
try that has never been a democracy,
but has an overwhelming dictatorship:
Zimbabwe.
We chose countries that were not

only geographically diverse but also
diverse in terms of their political sys
tems and diverse in their degree of
authoritarianism.
TSD: When the film was first
screened, how did it feel to see the
work come to fruition?
LD: I felt elated and inspired. You
know, the pieces of the film are great
because of the stories of democracy and
individuals taking risks in order to
achieve their ideals and defend their
rights, but you can also see that normal
ly in studying democratic contexts of
both individuals and countries. When
you see this woven together with the
artistry that Ben Moses has brought to
it with the animated fable at the
beginning of the movie that's revisited
later, the very inspiring musical score,
the extraordinary archival footage that
presents the historical context of these
countries, the countries juxtaposed
against one another, and the universali
ty of the struggle for democracy it's a
much more powerful story than a story
with just any one individual.
It demands a lot from the audience.
There's a lot of interview material that
is in the indigenous languages and then
is subtitled. I think that, from an artistic
point of view, it's a very powerful
achievement. When I first saw it
screened as a film, it was in our studio,
not in a public setting, and that's when it
first struck me that we have something
quite extraordinary here but then to
see it for the first time publicly
screened, and to see the audience' reac
tion to it, was very gratifying.

TSD: How did it feel to get such good
reviews from the press?
LD: You just never know with
reviews. You know, reviewers are fierce
ly independent-minded individuals and
artistry is something that is profoundly
subjective, but it was obviously very
deeply gratifying, and these reviews
appreciated not only the aesthetic
dimensions of the film, but also cap
tured what we were trying to do and
convey on a substantive level.

TSD: How have audiences responded
to the film?
LD: Generally, we've gotten a lot of
positive feedback from the people in the

audience. At least every screening I've
been at has ended with spontaneous
applause at the end of the screening.
And that's probably been the most
heartwarming element of it. Audiences
have generally been deeply apprecia
tive. After the screening at the State
Department, we got a great letter from
[Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton.

TSD: How did it feel to receive such
warm praise from the Secretary of
State?
LD: That was one of the highlights.
During her four years as Secretary of
State, she has made a priority out of
supporting civil society and trying to
promote and advance democracy
around the world by embracing, defend
ing and giving financial and technical
support to civil society groups around
the world who are struggling for democ
racy.
What we have portrayed in the film
was an extension of what she was trying
to do ... The fact that she recognized
the link between these stories and
struggles and lives and what she was
trying to do as Secretary of State, and
that this resonated with someone who
has made such a high priority of trying
to support these kinds of efforts, was
deeply gratifying.

TSD: Ultimately, where would you
like the film to go from here, and
what kind of impact would you like
for it to have?
LD: Basically, I'd like the film to be
seen by as many people in the United
States and around the world as possible
who might either be able to be more
sensitive of the global nature of the
struggle or take inspiration from the
fact that there are individuals around
the world struggling for democracy...
We're hoping that it might be shown on
television both here and abroad, and
that as many people as possible will be
made aware of the fact that freedom is
not something that can be taken for
granted, that there's an active global
struggle for it, that people have been
risking them lives for it, and that these
are very inspiring and important sto
ries.

democracy: Malaysia. We have a coun
try that has never been a democracy,
but has an overwhelming dictatorship:
Zimbabwe.
We chose countries that were not

only geographically diverse but also
diverse in terms of their political sys
tems and diverse in their degree of
authoritarianism.
TSD: When the film was first
screened, how did it feel to see the
work come to fruition?
LD: I felt elated and inspired. You
know, the pieces of the film are great
because of the stories of democracy and
individuals taking risks in order to
achieve their ideals and defend their
rights, but you can also see that normal
ly in studying democratic contexts of
both individuals and countries. When
you see this woven together with the
artistry that Ben Moses has brought to
it with the animated fable at the
beginning of the movie that's revisited
later, the very inspiring musical score,
the extraordinary archival footage that
presents the historical context of these
countries, the countries juxtaposed
against one another, and the universali
ty of the struggle for democracy it's a
much more powerful story than a story
with just any one individual.
It demands a lot from the audience.
There's a lot of interview material that
is in the indigenous languages and then
is subtitled. I think that, from an artistic
point of view, it's a very powerful
achievement. When I first saw it
screened as a film, it was in our studio,
not in a public setting, and that's when it
first struck me that we have something
quite extraordinary here but then to
see it for the first time publicly
screened, and to see the audience' reac
tion to it, was very gratifying.

TSD: How did it feel to get such good
reviews from the press?
LD: You just never know with
reviews. You know, reviewers are fierce
ly independent-minded individuals and
artistry is something that is profoundly
subjective, but it was obviously very
deeply gratifying, and these reviews
appreciated not only the aesthetic
dimensions of the film, but also cap
tured what we were trying to do and
convey on a substantive level.

TSD: How have audiences responded
to the film?
LD: Generally, we've gotten a lot of
positive feedback from the people in the

audience. At least every screening I've
been at has ended with spontaneous
applause at the end of the screening.
And that's probably been the most
heartwarming element of it. Audiences
have generally been deeply apprecia
tive. After the screening at the State
Department, we got a great letter from
[Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton.

TSD: How did it feel to receive such
warm praise from the Secretary of
State?
LD: That was one of the highlights.
During her four years as Secretary of
State, she has made a priority out of
supporting civil society and trying to
promote and advance democracy
around the world by embracing, defend
ing and giving financial and technical
support to civil society groups around
the world who are struggling for democ
racy.
What we have portrayed in the film
was an extension of what she was trying
to do ... The fact that she recognized
the link between these stories and
struggles and lives and what she was
trying to do as Secretary of State, and
that this resonated with someone who
has made such a high priority of trying
to support these kinds of efforts, was
deeply gratifying.

TSD: Ultimately, where would you
like the film to go from here, and
what kind of impact would you like
for it to have?
LD: Basically, I'd like the film to be
seen by as many people in the United
States and around the world as possible
who might either be able to be more
sensitive of the global nature of the
struggle or take inspiration from the
fact that there are individuals around
the world struggling for democracy...
We're hoping that it might be shown on
television both here and abroad, and
that as many people as possible will be
made aware of the fact that freedom is
not something that can be taken for
granted, that there's an active global
struggle for it, that people have been
risking them lives for it, and that these
are very inspiring and important sto
ries.

Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO is a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and the direc
tor of the Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law.
Diamond's work as a democracy
advocate inspired the recently
released documentary "A Whisper
to a Roar," which explores the per

sonal stories of democracy activists
in Egypt, Malaysia, Ukraine,
Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
The documentary, for which
Diamond was a producer, won high
praise from critics and leaders like
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
who commented that "the film is
not only a riveting documentary,
but also offers inspiration to people
everywhere who seek to make gov

ernments accountable to the citi
zens they serve." The Daily spoke
with Diamond about the film's ori
gins, its critical reception and its
future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
and when did you come in con
tact with [director] Ben Moses
about making this film?
Larry Diamond (LD): Ben is a

documentary filmmaker who did
[1997 Oscar-nominated film] "Good
Morning, Vietnam" based on his
personal experience in Vietnam. I
came to know him through a mutu
al friend some years ago. We sim
ply stayed in touch and when my
book "The Spirit of Democracy"
came out, I sent him a copy. Even-
tually, he approached me with an inter
est in making a documentary that would
in some way capture the themes and
if I can say the spirit of the book that
I had written.

TSD: What was your role in making
the documentary?
LD: I was involved in framing the
content of the film. There were a few of
us who met intensively to ask what
themes we wanted to address, how were
we going to cinematically display those
themes and what countries were we
going to feature in the film. When we
decided on the themes, then we had to
decide whom we were going to inter
view. I was on-site for some of the coun
try filming, and worked closely with the
director on all of the content issues from
beginning to end.

TSD: Why those countries in particu
lar? Viewers would have a strong
interest in Egyptian democracy due
to the Arab Spring, I imagine, but
why the others?
LD: We selected Egypt before the
Arab Spring. In fact, we were largely
done by the time the Arab Spring erupt
ed. We wanted to depict and explore
countries that were in the midst of dem
ocratic struggles. We wanted to look at
countries that were geographically
diverse, but also diverse regarding
where they stand now in the struggle
for democracy and diverse in terms of
the types of political systems that they
have.
We have a country that's achieved a
very inspiring breakthrough into
democracy: Ukraine. We have a country
that had been a democracy and then lost
it, and then is now struggling to achieve
it: Venezuela. We have a country that
has some multiparty competition, but
also has a very authoritarian dominant
party, and is possibly on the cusp of
democracy: Malaysia. We have a coun
try that has never been a democracy,
but has an overwhelming dictatorship:
Zimbabwe.
We chose countries that were not

only geographically diverse but also

tems and diverse in their degree of
