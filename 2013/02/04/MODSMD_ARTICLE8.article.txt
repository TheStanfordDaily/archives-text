## School of Earth Sciences researchers develop Arctic greenhouse gas tracker 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Edward Ngai 
Researchers at the Stanford School of Earth Sciences have
developed a new system that can track spots of greenhouse
gases buried deep beneath the Arctic's permafrost, potentially
assisting scientists in mapping the permafrost as it thaws.
Andrew Parsekian, a postdoctoral scholar in the geophysics
department, together with his team, adapted a hospital imag
ing system to track Arctic meltwater, which creates deep pools
of decomposing organic material. That material in turn creates
methane, a greenhouse gas significantly more potent than car
bon dioxide, which then leaks into the atmosphere.
Last summer, Parsekian travelled to the Arctic to map pools
of decaying organic matter called taliks. As decaying plant
and animal matter thaw and release stored carbon, this per
mafrost melt contributes to global warming. Greenhouse gas
es from taliks are second only to fossil fuel consumption as
sources of greenhouse gases.
Parsekian's research, which mapped water up to 50 feet
deep in each talik, will potentially be applied to more accu
rately model future temperature changes as a result of green
house gas emissions.
"We think this technology will prove directly useful for
studying the rate that permafrost is thawing in the Arctic and
contributing to future climate change," Parsekian told
SFGate.
As what used to be permafrost continues to melt at the
Earth's poles, other scientists hope that Parsekian's break
through can be used to better climate science.
"The new system will be extremely useful for us," said
Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist at the University of Col
orado who studies climate change. "It can be the wave of the
future."
