# Thoughts on Super Bowl XLVII
## 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
With the exception of
the Raiders-Bucca
neers blowout 11
years ago, the
Super Bowl has
always been high on drama. The last
few years have condensed an entire
season's worth of tension, pressure and
intensity into a few agonizing minutes
towards the end of the game. This
year's tilt was no exception, with the
champion Baltimore Ravens outlast
ing the San Francisco 49ers by the
slimmest of margins, 34-31. Afewmus
ings about the game:
i. What an ending. What looked like
a blowout turned into a spectacular
game, with a fitting controversial end
ing. Seems comical in retrospect that in
the Year of the Replacement Referee,
the turning point in the Super Bowl
came on a fourfh-and-goal play where
there was plenty of contact and the
zebras swallowed their whistles.
Personally I think that was blatant
defensive holding; as a referee, I think
you have to make that call, especially
since Michael Crabtree was trying to
locate the ball as Jimmy Smith locked
his arms to his body. Instead, the men
in black and white continued a time
honored tradition of refusing to whistle
anything that happens inside the two
minute warning.
ii. Not a huge fan of the 49ers play
calling down near* the goal line. A sin
gle touchdown on those early (or late)
trips changes this game entirely.
Instead, the 49ers went pass happy,
which not only prevented them from
milking the clock but also cost them a
few downs on foolish back-shoulder
fades on both sides of the end zone.
With Kaepernick at the helm, I am
convinced that running quarterback
draws on four straight plays would
undoubtedly end up scoring six.
Instead, the Niners are left to rue what
could have been. On that note, it is nev
er smart to put the game on the line by
throwing the ball up for grabs and hop
ing for a penalty Unless of course you
are Joe Flacco...
iii. Speaking of the new Joe Cool,
Joe Flacco has earned every penny of
the multi-trillion dollar contract some
team is going to throw at him this off
season. I mean, are you kidding me?
The dude has 11 touchdowns, zero
interceptions and every viewer on the
edge of his seat as he uncorks a deep
ball. His MVP honor was well
deserved.
I never thought I would say this,
but I think it's time to retire the "Flac
cid Flacco" nickname. More stunning
ly every dumb decision he made (Le.
the innumerable jump balls he threw
up to Anquan Boldin over the course of
these playoffs) worked out splendidly;
I still have my doubts as to Flacco's
consistency but he has more than
worked his way off my "crappy quar
terbacks" list.
iv. Colin Kaepernick is going to be a
wonderful quarterback over the
course of his career. He has an absolute
howitzer attached to his right shoulder,
he's faster than a speeding bullet and,
moreover, he has incredible poise in the
pocket and touch on his passes ...in
short, everything you would want to
build around. However, with all his suc
cess over the course of the season, we
tend to forget this is his first M (half?)
season playing in the NFL. Early on in
the game, he looked quite jittery And I
would be remiss to forget that he
almost incurred a delay-of-game
penalty on every single snap.
v. Ray Rice has fumble-itis in the
playoffs. Three fumbles in three post
season games have me quite con
cerned every time he touches the ball.
The shocking thing is that Rice never
fumbles in the regular season, which
makes his playoff performances either
staggering statistical outliers or a
symptom of the intensity of playoff
football.
vi. I don't know if Jim Harbaugh
had dealings with the devil at halftime,
but if he did make a deal, it probably
involves his soul, seven pounds of flesh
and the ritual sacrifice of Alex Smith at
the unholy altar of doom. Nothing else
explains ho\y right after a gut-wrench
ing kickoff returned for a touchdown,
the lights go out, the Niners storm
right back and the Ravens start mak
ing all the mistakes they never made in
the first half The momentum in this
game switched to the 49ers way faster
than the amount of time it took the
Superdome staff to figure out how the
devil cut off their power.
vii. Speaking of power, Beyonce's
halftime performance was... interest
ing. I'm trying to think of the most
politically correct way to say this ...
screw it. She is incredibly attractive.
Enough said.
viii. In a game that smelled like a
defensive struggle, complete with
analogies to blood, gore and Roman
gladiators, it figures that neither defense could
ever get a stop when it really needed one. For
the most part, the offenses rolled up and down
the turf. The final score of 34-31 speaks to how
offensively minded the league has become; two
elite defenses couldn't even stop two mediocre*
offenses. (I have mediocre with an asterisk,
because nothing about these teams is
mediocre.)
ix. Speaking of defenses, enjoy retirement
Ray Lewis. Few players have played the game as
long as you, or with as much passion. Now you
can officially become who you were meant to be:
the world's greatest motivational speaker.
x. With each passing year, it becomes clearer
and clearer to me that the luckiest and hottest
team always wins the Super Bowl, not necessari
ly the most talented. On paper, the Ravens were
overmatched at nearly every position, both offen
sively and defensively
However, they played loose and with utter
(nearly irrational) confidence in their abilities,
while the 49ers spent the entire first half in the
fetal position. The last 10 Super Bowl champions

(New England, New England, Pittsburgh, Indi
anapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, New Orleans,
Green Bay, New York, Baltimore) have all had
one thing in common: they peaked towards the
end of the season, built up momentum through
out the playoffs and got the better of the lucky
breaks in the Super Bowl itself. The truth is that
it's not sufficient to be the most loaded roster in
football; to win a Super Bowl, you've got to be
lucky too.
With all that said, congratulations to the Bal
timore Ravens, who are world champions (anoth
er quick note: since no other nation plays football,
calling the Ravens world champions seems like
egregious overstatement, but I digress) and now
face an offseason filled with tough questions. And
for the 49er5... you have lost twice in the most
agonizing ways possible (two muffed punts last
year, and I don't want to re-salt this year's wound
so soon). Third time's the charm, I guess?
I would also like to give a shout-out to manag
ing editor George, who forced me to write this col
umn as the 49ers were driving down the field to
try to win the game. Thanks bro. I hope you suffer
mightily for this.
