rival No. 4 UCLA. Sophomore Ivana Hong was the

Cardinal with scores of 9.900 and 9.875 (a career best
for Hanset), good for second and a tie for third in the

"I was so impressed and proud of Ivana," head
coach Kristen Smyth told GoStanford.com. "She's such
a competitor and such a beautiful athlete on all four
