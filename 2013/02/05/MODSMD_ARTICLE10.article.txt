## UCLA SPOILS HOME OPENER 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
Despite one of its better performances of the sea
son, the No. 11 Stanford women's gymnastics team
lost its home opener in a close one against conference
rival No. 4 UCLA. Sophomore Ivana Hong was the
story of the day for the Cardinal, as she posted a
career-best score of 39.550 in the all-around competi
tion.
Both teams set the bar high early on, as UCLA
outscored Stanford 49.300-49.200 on vault for the first
event of the evening. UCLA senior Vanessa Zamarri
pa in the event with a 10.000, the only perfect score
for any competitor in the meet.

Hong and fellow sophomore Pauline Hanset led the
Cardinal with scores of 9.900 and 9.875 (a career best
for Hanset), good for second and a tie for third in the
event. Other notables were senior captains Ashley
Morgan and Nicole Dayton, who each scored a 9.825.
"I was so impressed and proud of Ivana," head
coach Kristen Smyth told GoStanford.com. "She's such
a competitor and such a beautiful athlete on all four

two competitors dropped the
team score to just 48.625,
Stanford's worst team score of
the evening.
But Stanford would recov

the team in the event. Five of
six competitors scored at least
9.825 for the Cardinal, led by
Hong and Ashley Morgan's
pair of 9.900s a career high
on beam for Morgan put
ting them in a three-way tie
for second-place in the event.
Freshman Danusia Fran
cis scored a 9.925 for UCLA to
win the individual title. For
Stanford, junior Amanda
Spinner added a 9.875 while
Vaculik and junior Shona Mor
gan each scored a 9.825.
Despite such a strong per
formance from the Cardinal,
UCLA nearly matched it with
a 49.225, giving Stanford just a
10th of a point advantage in
the event. Heading into the
final round down 147.600-
147.150, the Cardinal would

need UCLA mistakes to have
a chance to earn a victory.
The Bruins did just the
opposite, posting a 49.325 of
their own on-floor exercise for
their best team score of the
entire meet. Zamarripa won
her second individual title of
the evening with a 9.925, and
none of her teammates scored
below a 9.825, which was plen
ty good enough to seal the vic
tory for UCLA
Stanford's Hong, Morgan

Ayssa Pritchett for second
place in the event with a score
of 9.875. Stanford scored a
49.050 in the event to round
out the final score of 196.200-
196.925 in favor of the Bruins.
Zamarripa earned the all
around victory for the Bruins
with a veiy impressive score of
39.675. Hong and Ashley Mor
gan also put together very
strong scores of 39.550 and
39.425, respectively, to grab
second and third place for
Stanford. Hong's score was a
career high, while Morgan's
was the best of her season so
far. Morgan is the reigning
Pac-12 Gymnast of the Week.
Stanford drops to 7-2 on
the year with the loss, while
UCLA continues to prove
itself as one of the country's
best teams, improving to 4-0
on the year. Stanford has a
much-needed break after a
stretch of five meets in four
weeks, as its next meet is not
until Feb. 15, when Arizona
State will come to Maples
Pavilion for the Cardinal's sec
ond home meet of the season.
