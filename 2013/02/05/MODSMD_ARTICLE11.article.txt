### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
While the world was watching
the Baltimore Ravens win their first
Super Bowl in 12 years, the No. 1
Stanford women's water polo team
added yet another trophy to the
case this weekend. The Cardinal (8-
0) swept all four games to capture
its fourth straight Stanford Invita
tional Championship.

The Cardinal faced its first seri
ous challenge of the year in the title
game against No. 3 UCLA on Sun
day afternoon, but ultimately pulled
out the 8-5 victory to hand the Bru
ins their first loss of the season.
The Bruins broke out to a 3-1
lead in the opening quarter, forcing
the Cardinal to play from behind for
the first time this season. Stanford
scored two goals in the second peri
od, but still trailed 4-3 at halftime.
After the break, goalkeeper
Kate Baldoni and the Stanford
defense locked down, holding
UCLA to just one goal in the second
half. The senior posted six saves in
the contest as Stanford held UCLA
to its season-low scoring output.
As the defense kept the Bruins
at bay, the Cardinal offense finally
opened up after halftime. Anna
Yelizarova continued her strong
freshman campaign by recording a
hat trick in the championship game.
Yelizarova and senior Melissa Sei
demann lead the team with 22 goals
apiece this season.
Junior Kaley Dodson added two
goals for the Cardinal while Seide
mann, freshman Maggie Steffens
and junior Kaitlyn Lo each scored
once.
Stanford reached the final by
earning the No. lseed in Bracket A
of the tournament.
The Cardinal opened the week
end by beating The Olympic Club 9-
5 in an exhibition game. The San
Francisco-based squad featured
players familiar to Cardinal fans
Stanford standouts Brenda Villa 'O3
and Monica Coughlan 'l2 played in
the match.
On Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal dominated No. 8 San Jose
State with a 15-4 score. Less than
two minutes into the game, Seide
mann scored the first of her five
goals to give the Cardinal a lead it
wouldn't relinquish. The Spartans
had no answer for the senior, who
dominated the space in front of the
cage by consistently sweeping up
rebounds and putting them away
