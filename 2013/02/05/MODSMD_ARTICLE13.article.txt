## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE That Second Cup of Coffee 
### Chris Herries 
I'm relatively new to the coffee
game. I never drank it until a
few weeks ago. But now it's
become a pleasure to sit in a public
place with a black cup of joe just
watching the world.
I'm not, however, new to people
watching. One of my great hobbies
is to sit alone in the dining halls, or
on a bench, or in the quad, mar
veling at all the people hurrying by.
For those of you looking for pro
found reflection, you'll not find it in
my head. Sometimes I just sit and
I'm sad. I brew over my coffee and
wonder whether or not these are
the best days of my life. Reminisc
ing about the good old days, I won
der how good they really were. Oth
er times I'm smiling, just because I
get to enjoy a second cup of coffee.
Happy to know that my mind is
sharp and my body brawny, that
I'm able to know and do things the
average person only dreams about.
Yet generally speaking, I sit, as
we all often do, in some sort of sta
sis. Trapped in the purgatory of
routine. Waiting for the next time
we can drink, or fuck, or laugh, or
dance, or listen to music. Already
longing for med school, or law
school, or a cushioned job some
where near the top. Just as in high
school we longed for college, and in
adulthood we'll long for retirement.
Sometimes I wonder what retired
people long for. Maybe they too are
waiting for God.
No matter what I'm feeling, my
thoughts turn back to the people
I'm watching. On occasions, their
clothes will stand out. Sometimes
it's the way they interact. Odd pos
turing, evasive eyes. Yet, most of
them are normal, which is why I
love people-watching. It's taught
me that deep down we're all essen
tially the same. It's taught me to
care. Because when I hear about a
girl being raped, I know that she is
my sister. And when a boy is starv
ing, I know he is my brother.
From that I've learned that
despite all the uncertainties in life,

this much is certain: that we should
try our hardest to be loving. It will
not be easy, and we will all fall short.
And, in some situations, even the
right decision will hurt. But all we
can be is our whole selves, to bring
what goodness we have to the table.
That openness will better the world
more than any divestment cam
paign.
A former friend once criticized
my outlook on life as being too seri
ous, citing my obsession with the
Book of Job. But when is the time to
take life seriously? In the end,
where is profundity without gravi
ty? I look out at all the people walk
ing past me, and I wonder if they
know that the decisions they make
now, no matter how small, shape the
trajectory of their character. It
makes me wish we would all slow
down and grab a second cup of cof
fee. Because when we reflect, our
lives are given context.
And we all lack context.
