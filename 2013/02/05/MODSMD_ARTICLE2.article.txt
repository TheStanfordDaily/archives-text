## Vaden, Flu Crew meet demand, will not hold more drop-in clinics

Vaden Health Center has reported four
times as many cases of influenza-like illness
compared to this time last year, according to
Vaden Medical Director Robyn Tepper. Eleven
true influenza-like illnesses had been reported
at this time last year, while 45 have already
been reported this season.
Eighty-six viral illnesses have been report
ed so far this year, compared with the 45 that
had been reported by the same time last year.
While Vaden does not plan on holding more
emergency vaccination clinics, vaccinations are
still available by appointment at Vaden and are
being given through Vaden's Travel Clinic.
Students who visit Vaden for unrelated rea
sons are also offered the vaccine, according to
Tepper.
Vaden Clinic Manager Nancy Masunaga
noted the spread of influenza on campus has
created a high demand for the influenza vac
cine, prompting renewed efforts to make the
vaccine more accessible to students.
"It was pretty stressful," Masunaga said.

"We were getting lots of phone calls from stu
dents asking to get the vaccine, and our immu
nization clinic was full and we couldn't accom
modate the individuals who wanted to get it by
appointment. So then we thought, well, it's
time to have the drop-in."
Vaden's drop-in clinic was held on Jan. 16,
accompanied by two drop-in clinics held by the
Stanford Flu Crew in Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons on Jan. 16 and 18.
"We had a little over 350 people vaccinated

in a total of four hours," said Catherine Zaw
'l5, the undergraduate director of the Flu
Crew. Zaw is a Daily staffer.
In total, the Stanford Flu Crew, which part
nered with Vaden for a Power Influenza Week
in October, has administered 5,116 vaccina
tions on campus. Vaden has administered 2,749
vaccinations, including 495 given during the
Jan. 16 drop-in clinic.
Although the unusually high number of vis
its to Vaden created an increased demand for
vaccinations, Vaden did not have to turn any
student away due to vaccination shortages,
according to Masunaga.
Zaw attributed the unusually high number
of visits to the media's coverage of flu season.
"After the whole news media scare and peo
ple had heard about the flu, Vaden was getting
a little bit overbooked themselves, so we want
ed to do [the clinics] again," Zaw said. "The
planning was pretty much in two or three days,
which is pretty awesome because it ended up
being a great success."
Currently, neither Vaden nor the Stanford
Flu Crew is planning to hold another emer
gency clinic.
"The demand, since we've had the emer-
