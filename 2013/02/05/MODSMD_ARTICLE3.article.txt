## iTunes U continues to thrive Outdated platform still challenges newer competition 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While massive open online course
(MOOC) platforms such as Coursera
and Udacity continue to gain traction in
the world of online learning, outdated
platforms such as iThnes U are still
attracting millions of remote learners
interested in Stanford courses.
According to Brent Izutsu, Stan
ford's director of digital media, over 1.35
million people have subscribed to a Stan
ford course on il\mes U. Stanford-pro
duced content, including video and audio
recordings of lectures and speeches, has
been downloaded more than 64 million
times.
Izutsu said that the iTunes U pro
gram offers a valid alternative to pro
grams like Coursera for remote stu
dents who want to take a Stanford
course at their own pace.
'A lot of the other platforms have
people taking the courses together at
the same time, which is a much more
intense learning experience," Izutsu
said. "With ilbnes U, you are working at
your own pace and can invest as much or
as little time as you want."
Stanford's use of iTunes U has
evolved significantly since it began using
the platform eight years ago. While the
University's fflmes U site now hosts 17
full courses, it was originally used to
broadcast commencement speeches and
other notable events to alumni around
the world.
"When we launched the public site in
2005, it was very much geared toward
re-engaging alumni," Izutsu said. "We
very quickly realized that our audience
was not just alumni but the general pub
lic at large."
In 2007, videotaped lectures from 10
courses were added to the Stanford
iltmes site. The content on the site con
sisted solely of audio and video files until
January 2012, when Apple launched the
iltmes U app. This app allowed profes
sors to upload additional materials such
as homework assignments and class
handouts, giving remote students more
of a comprehensive course experience.
