## iTunes U continues to thrive Outdated platform still challenges newer competition 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While massive open online course
(MOOC) platforms such as Coursera
and Udacity continue to gain traction in
the world of online learning, outdated
platforms such as iThnes U are still
attracting millions of remote learners
interested in Stanford courses.
According to Brent Izutsu, Stan
ford's director of digital media, over 1.35
million people have subscribed to a Stan
ford course on il\mes U. Stanford-pro
duced content, including video and audio
recordings of lectures and speeches, has
been downloaded more than 64 million
times.
Izutsu said that the iTunes U pro
gram offers a valid alternative to pro
grams like Coursera for remote stu
dents who want to take a Stanford
course at their own pace.
'A lot of the other platforms have
people taking the courses together at
the same time, which is a much more
intense learning experience," Izutsu
said. "With ilbnes U, you are working at
your own pace and can invest as much or
as little time as you want."
Stanford's use of iTunes U has
evolved significantly since it began using
the platform eight years ago. While the
University's fflmes U site now hosts 17
full courses, it was originally used to
broadcast commencement speeches and
other notable events to alumni around
the world.
"When we launched the public site in
2005, it was very much geared toward
re-engaging alumni," Izutsu said. "We
very quickly realized that our audience
was not just alumni but the general pub
lic at large."
In 2007, videotaped lectures from 10
courses were added to the Stanford
iltmes site. The content on the site con
sisted solely of audio and video files until
January 2012, when Apple launched the
iltmes U app. This app allowed profes
sors to upload additional materials such
as homework assignments and class
handouts, giving remote students more
of a comprehensive course experience.
While remote students can now par
ticipate in a course by completing home-
work assignments and even tak
ing exams, they are still not able
to ask questions in class, receive
feedback on homework and
exams or collaborate with class
mates. Several iltmes U courses
have attempted to bridge this gap
through Piazza, an online forum
that allows students from around
the world to ask and answer ques
tions and discuss the course.
One such course is Coding
Together: Developing Apps for
iPhone and iPad, taught by Pro
fessor of Computer Science Paul
Hegarty 'B7 M.S. 'BB. Hegarty
first videotaped and uploaded lec
tures from his course in Fall 2010,
and he uploads a new version of
the course with each curriculum
update. There are currently four
versions of the course on iltmes
U.
"I've taught iltmes U a num
ber of times so it's kind of like it's
an old hat," he said. "When I first
did it years ago, I probably
thought that eveiyone was watch
ing my every move and I couldn't
screw up, but not so much any
more."
Hegarty is teaching an updat
ed version of the course this quar
ter and has been uploading the
lectures and class materials on
iltmes U. This class is currently
the top iTunes U course by down
loads.
Remote students are able to
register on Piazza to discuss the
lectures and assignments with
other students, although Hegarty
says that iTunes U students often
reach out to him for help instead.
"Many, many people have
watched my class on iltines U,
and I get emails from all over the
world from people asking me
questions about everything from
the content of the course to
whether I can grade their home
work," Hegarty said. "I have to
ignore it all. It's just too much
stuff."
In some cases, however,
iltmes U students are able to
communicate directly with pro
fessors and offer suggestions
about the content of the class.
In Election 2012, a one-unit
lecture series, guests such as Pro
fessor of Economics John Taylor
Ph.D. '73 and University Presi
dent John Hennessy spoke about
a variety of topics related to the
election. Before each lecture, both
remote and Stanford students

used a Piazza forum to suggest
questions for the speakers. Other
students were able to vote each
question up or down, allowing the
most popular questions to rise to
the top and catch the attention of
the moderators.
Associate Professor of Politi
cal Science Rob Reich M.A. '9B
Ph.D. '9B, one of the course mod
erators, said that Election 2012's
professors intended for Stanford
students and remote students to
discuss issues together through
Piazza, but ran into privacy issues
and had to create three separate
forums one for Stanford stu
dents, one for Continuing Studies
students and one for members of
the general public.
The issue stemmed from the
Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA), which pro
hibits Stanford from releasing the
names of students taking a specif
ic course.
Reich said that because the
course was filmed and uploaded
on iltmes U, students in the audi
ence at lectures were unable to
directly question the speakers,
since the professors did not
obtain permission from every stu
dent to have his or her image
online.
Though some students were
disappointed with not being able
to directly interact with the
speakers, Reich said that the
online system benefitted students
who may have been reluctant to
ask questions in front of the class.
"Having a microphone in the
crowd means people who jump up
first and have a question to ask
immediately get their questions
asked," Reich said. "Online, it's
not like a 100-yard dash to get to
the microphone stand. In that
respect, some students might
prefer being able to propose ques
tions online."
While the Election 2012 lec
ture videos were posted 72 hours
after each class, other iTunes U
videos have to go through an
intense editing process before
being approved for the iltmes U
site. Videos undergo copyright
scrubbing, which requires that all
copyrighted materials such as
a diagram from a textbook that
the professor projects to the class
—be removed from the video if
the professor does not get per
mission to publically broadcast
them.

Associate Professor of Com
puter Science Andrew Ng, whose
Machine Learning course is the
ninth-most popular class by
downloads on the Stanford iTunes
U site, complained that copyright
scrubbing made uploading his
class to iTunes U much more
expensive and time consuming.
"We recorded the videos in
Fall 2007, and there were many
months of editing and removing
copyright content, which was a
large part of the cost," Ng said.
"Copyright scrubbing is one of
those things that doesn't seem
that difficult until you actually do
it."
Ng, the co-CEO and co
founder of Coursera, said that
while iTunes U courses have his
torically been attractive to remote
students, iTunes U has become
outdated as a platform.
"If your goal is to only distrib
ute video, I think iTtmes U is a
fine platform," Ng said. "But new
technologies are much more
interactive, allow students to get
feedback and earn certificates for
their work. In the future, I will
put my online courses on Cours
era because I believe that technol
ogy is much better suited for
online courses."
While the future of Stanford's
involvement in iltmes U is still
unclear, Hegarty is certain that
online education will continue to
evolve.
"There's no doubt about the
fact that this online education
thing is just in its infancy," Hegar
ty said. "It's hard to know and
hard to predict what's going to
happen in the next 10 years.
There's going to be a lot more
going on in online education in 10
years than there is today."

You...can invest
as much or as
little time as
you want.
BRENT IZUTSU,
digital media director
While massive open online course
(MOOC) platforms such as Coursera
and Udacity continue to gain traction in
the world of online learning, outdated
platforms such as iThnes U are still
attracting millions of remote learners
interested in Stanford courses.
According to Brent Izutsu, Stan
ford's director of digital media, over 1.35
million people have subscribed to a Stan
ford course on il\mes U. Stanford-pro
duced content, including video and audio
recordings of lectures and speeches, has
been downloaded more than 64 million
times.
Izutsu said that the iTunes U pro
gram offers a valid alternative to pro
grams like Coursera for remote stu
dents who want to take a Stanford
course at their own pace.
'A lot of the other platforms have
people taking the courses together at
the same time, which is a much more
intense learning experience," Izutsu
said. "With ilbnes U, you are working at
your own pace and can invest as much or
as little time as you want."
Stanford's use of iTunes U has
evolved significantly since it began using
the platform eight years ago. While the
University's fflmes U site now hosts 17
full courses, it was originally used to
broadcast commencement speeches and
other notable events to alumni around
the world.
"When we launched the public site in
2005, it was very much geared toward
re-engaging alumni," Izutsu said. "We
very quickly realized that our audience
was not just alumni but the general pub
lic at large."
In 2007, videotaped lectures from 10
courses were added to the Stanford
iltmes site. The content on the site con
sisted solely of audio and video files until
January 2012, when Apple launched the
iltmes U app. This app allowed profes
sors to upload additional materials such
as homework assignments and class
handouts, giving remote students more
of a comprehensive course experience.
While remote students can now par
ticipate in a course by completing home-
work assignments and even tak
ing exams, they are still not able
to ask questions in class, receive
feedback on homework and
exams or collaborate with class
mates. Several iltmes U courses
have attempted to bridge this gap
through Piazza, an online forum
that allows students from around
the world to ask and answer ques
tions and discuss the course.
One such course is Coding
Together: Developing Apps for
iPhone and iPad, taught by Pro
fessor of Computer Science Paul
Hegarty 'B7 M.S. 'BB. Hegarty
first videotaped and uploaded lec
tures from his course in Fall 2010,
and he uploads a new version of
the course with each curriculum
update. There are currently four
versions of the course on iltmes
U.
"I've taught iltmes U a num
ber of times so it's kind of like it's
an old hat," he said. "When I first
did it years ago, I probably
thought that eveiyone was watch
ing my every move and I couldn't
screw up, but not so much any
more."
Hegarty is teaching an updat
ed version of the course this quar
ter and has been uploading the
lectures and class materials on
iltmes U. This class is currently
the top iTunes U course by down
loads.
Remote students are able to
register on Piazza to discuss the
lectures and assignments with
other students, although Hegarty
says that iTunes U students often
reach out to him for help instead.
"Many, many people have
watched my class on iltines U,
and I get emails from all over the
world from people asking me
questions about everything from
the content of the course to
whether I can grade their home
work," Hegarty said. "I have to
ignore it all. It's just too much
stuff."
In some cases, however,
iltmes U students are able to
communicate directly with pro
fessors and offer suggestions
about the content of the class.
In Election 2012, a one-unit
lecture series, guests such as Pro
fessor of Economics John Taylor
Ph.D. '73 and University Presi
dent John Hennessy spoke about
a variety of topics related to the
election. Before each lecture, both
remote and Stanford students

used a Piazza forum to suggest
questions for the speakers. Other
students were able to vote each
question up or down, allowing the
most popular questions to rise to
the top and catch the attention of
the moderators.
Associate Professor of Politi
cal Science Rob Reich M.A. '9B
Ph.D. '9B, one of the course mod
erators, said that Election 2012's
professors intended for Stanford
students and remote students to
discuss issues together through
Piazza, but ran into privacy issues
and had to create three separate
forums one for Stanford stu
dents, one for Continuing Studies
students and one for members of
the general public.
The issue stemmed from the
Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA), which pro
hibits Stanford from releasing the
names of students taking a specif
ic course.
Reich said that because the
course was filmed and uploaded
on iltmes U, students in the audi
ence at lectures were unable to
directly question the speakers,
since the professors did not
obtain permission from every stu
dent to have his or her image
online.
Though some students were
disappointed with not being able
to directly interact with the
speakers, Reich said that the
online system benefitted students
who may have been reluctant to
ask questions in front of the class.
"Having a microphone in the
crowd means people who jump up
first and have a question to ask
immediately get their questions
asked," Reich said. "Online, it's
not like a 100-yard dash to get to
the microphone stand. In that
respect, some students might
prefer being able to propose ques
tions online."
While the Election 2012 lec
ture videos were posted 72 hours
after each class, other iTunes U
videos have to go through an
intense editing process before
being approved for the iltmes U
site. Videos undergo copyright
scrubbing, which requires that all
copyrighted materials such as
a diagram from a textbook that
the professor projects to the class
—be removed from the video if
the professor does not get per
mission to publically broadcast
them.

Associate Professor of Com
puter Science Andrew Ng, whose
Machine Learning course is the
ninth-most popular class by
downloads on the Stanford iTunes
U site, complained that copyright
scrubbing made uploading his
class to iTunes U much more
expensive and time consuming.
"We recorded the videos in
Fall 2007, and there were many
months of editing and removing
copyright content, which was a
large part of the cost," Ng said.
"Copyright scrubbing is one of
those things that doesn't seem
that difficult until you actually do
it."
