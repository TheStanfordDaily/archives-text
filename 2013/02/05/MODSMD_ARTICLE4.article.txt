## ASSU approves $70k for spring grants 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's Appropriations Com
mittee awarded approximately
$70,000 in grants to 18 general
fees student groups for spring
events in the second round of the
Senate's new grant program.
The committee will present
their proposals at the Feb. 5 Sen
ate meeting in advance of a Sen
ate vote to authorize the grants'
allocation.
The committee received com
plete applications from 30 groups
requesting nearly $150,000 in
total. It recommended a dis
bursement of $69,117.42, in total,
to 18 of the 30 groups. Although
the Senate originally planned to
allocate $40,000 to spring quarter
events, senators voted to
increase the maximum allocation
to $75,000 after receiving an
unexpectedly high number of
applications.
During the winter quarter
round, the Senate received 20
applications and allocated almost
$50,000 in grants.
Appropriations committee
member Daniela Olivos 'l5 said
that the committee needed an
extra week to make decisions

about spring grants because it
was difficult to schedule inter
views with so many student
groups.
According to Olivos, the com
mittee used the same criteria to
evaluate grant applications that
they used in winter quarter.
"We weren't looking at how
much money we had," she said.
"We tried to take each applica
tion at face value. Even though
we had a budget that we could
have gone up to, we didn't think
that we could be more or less
lenient."
Grant amounts ranged from
$225 to almost $lO,OOO, with Col
leges Against Cancer receiving
the largest grant for their annual
Relay for Life event. The average
grant was approximately $3,900.
Adrian Bonifacio 'l3 M.A. 'l3,
president of Kayumanggi, a Fil
ipino dance troupe, requested
almost $9,000 for the group's
annual showcase. The group
received about $3,300.
"We're going to use it towards
new things for the event," Bonifa
cio said. "We wanted to invest in
costumes and have live music for
the first time. It's an old event,
but we're going to revamp it."
