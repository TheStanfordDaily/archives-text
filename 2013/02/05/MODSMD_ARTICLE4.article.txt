# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## ASSU approves $70k for spring grants 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's Appropriations Com
mittee awarded approximately
$70,000 in grants to 18 general
fees student groups for spring
events in the second round of the
Senate's new grant program.
The committee will present
their proposals at the Feb. 5 Sen
ate meeting in advance of a Sen
ate vote to authorize the grants'
allocation.
The committee received com
plete applications from 30 groups
requesting nearly $150,000 in
total. It recommended a dis
bursement of $69,117.42, in total,
to 18 of the 30 groups. Although
the Senate originally planned to
allocate $40,000 to spring quarter
events, senators voted to
increase the maximum allocation
to $75,000 after receiving an
unexpectedly high number of
applications.
During the winter quarter
round, the Senate received 20
applications and allocated almost
$50,000 in grants.
Appropriations committee
member Daniela Olivos 'l5 said
that the committee needed an
extra week to make decisions

about spring grants because it
was difficult to schedule inter
views with so many student
groups.
According to Olivos, the com
mittee used the same criteria to
evaluate grant applications that
they used in winter quarter.
"We weren't looking at how
much money we had," she said.
"We tried to take each applica
tion at face value. Even though
we had a budget that we could
have gone up to, we didn't think
that we could be more or less
lenient."
Grant amounts ranged from
$225 to almost $lO,OOO, with Col
leges Against Cancer receiving
the largest grant for their annual
Relay for Life event. The average
grant was approximately $3,900.
Adrian Bonifacio 'l3 M.A. 'l3,
president of Kayumanggi, a Fil
ipino dance troupe, requested
almost $9,000 for the group's
annual showcase. The group
received about $3,300.
"We're going to use it towards
new things for the event," Bonifa
cio said. "We wanted to invest in
costumes and have live music for
the first time. It's an old event,
but we're going to revamp it."
Nathan Cheung 'l4, vice president
of the Stanford Chinese Music Ensem
ble, requested $2,150 for the ensem
ble's spring concert and received
almost $1,900. Cheung said that he
determined the amount of money to
apply for by thinking of what improve
ments could be made to the event and
calculating their costs.
"This concert is sort of the prime
event for our group, so we wanted to
invite artists, we wanted to see if we
could get additional instruments and we
also factored in recordings, food and uni
forms," Cheung said.
While most of the grant requests
were for events for Stanford students,
Olivos said that the Senate received sev

eral requests for events directed
towards high school students. Though
these events did not meet the Senate's
criteria of being open to all Stanford stu
dents, Olivos said the Senate will look
into providing alternative funding for
those types of events in the future.
"We noticed that there is a need for a
philanthropy grant or some kind of
process for groups doing that kind of
programming," she said. "We definitely
are thinking about the future and how
that could be incorporated."
The Senate will be collecting feed
back from groups involved in the grant
application process and will pass on their
recommendations to next year's Senate.
"We definitely don't want this to be
a one-time thing, just because it was so
successful for certain groups this year,"
Olivos said.
