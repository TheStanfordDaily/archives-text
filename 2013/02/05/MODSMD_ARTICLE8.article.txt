# Stanford researchers demonstrate link between virtual super-powers and empathy

Superpowers can be a force for good,
according to Stanford researchers who
found that giving people the ability of
virtual flight encourages a higher inci
dence of signs of empathy in later tests.
The experiment, conducted in the
University's Virtual Human Interaction
Laboratory, observed 30 men and 30
women who had put on a set of goggles
and entered a digital cityscape.
Half of the subjects were endowed
with the Superman-like ability to fly,
while the other half only saw them
selves as passengers in a helicopter.
Both were charged with the same task
of delivering an insulin injection to a
diabetic child stranded somewhere in
the city.
When subjects participated in a
post-experiment interview, the inter
viewer would intentionally knock over a
cup of 15 pens, waiting five seconds to
pick them up and picking one pen up
each second thereafter. Every
member of the group that had flown
like Superman helped the inter
viewer, picking up 15 percent more
pens than the helicopter group. Six
members of the helicopter group
chose not to help at all.
The next iteration of the study
will allow participants to steer the
helicopter, in an effort to demon
strate whether the feeling of control
in helping the child or the super

power itself inspires the feelings of
empathy.
The study was led by Associate
Professor of Communication Jere
my Bailenson, clinical psychologist
Robin Rosenberg and communica
tion student Shawnee Baughman
'l2 M.A. 'l3.
"If we can identify the mecha
nism that encourages empathy, then
perhaps we can design technology
and video games that people will
enjoy and that will successfully pro
mote altruistic behavior in the real
world," Bailenson told the Stanford
News Service.
