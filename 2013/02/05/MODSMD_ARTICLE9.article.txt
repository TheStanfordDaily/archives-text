# How football teams reload their own way

That's it; the season is offi
cially over. The Ravens' 34-
31 Super Bowl victory
over the Niners on Sunday
evening means more than
that the Yince Lombardi trophy is
heading to Baltimore. It means foot
ball fans now face a seven-month
drought before a ball is next thrown
or kicked in anger
Stadium lights across the United
States will be flickering off —just like
they already did in the Superdome
and both professional and college
players will be hoping for a little
respite before serious training ramps
back up again.
But don't be fooled, it's not quite
over. In just three weeks the NFL
Scouting Combine will be here, and
in just a couple of months, the NFL
Draft takes place. Sports coverage
will still include a healthy dose of
football analysis and speculation as
everyone puzzles over the prized
players for sale.
In case you don't often look
much further than gridiron, some
thing equally as important hap
pened elsewhere in the world of
sports last week. On Thursday, the
January transfer window slammed
shut, setting in stone the team line
ups in the various English soccer
leagues until the end of the season
around Europe, the other major
leagues followed suit just a few days
later.
The near juxtaposition of the
end of the transfer window and
opening of draft season highlights
two very different philosophies and
two contrasting approaches to nur
turing fresh talent in sports.
Put simply, the NFL Draft gives
first choice to the very worst teams
from the previous year. The result is
that the most exciting and promis
ing talent from college will likely
face a frustrating first season in the
pros, though it also does make it
more likely that these players
might get considerable game time.
And while changes to the revenue
sharing system now reduce the
funds available to struggling teams,
the salary cap still helps ensure that
the contracts of these big players
to-be won't literally break the bank.
In comparison, the soccer trans
fer window makes little attempt to
level the playing field. Though clubs
in the Premier League do share TV
money equally, the most successful
team each year wins a prize of
around $25 million, 20 times that
given to the worst. The cruel, inter
connected nature of English soccer
exacerbates the inequality too,
dumping the bottom three teams in
the Premier League into the divi
sion below and replacing them with
clubs that are usually much poorer.
And when it comes to signing new
or existing talent, money talks;
often the smaller teams must wait
patiently until the bigger fish have
snapped up the juiciest prospects.
Outside of the transfer window,
the big clubs boast the resources
and finances to attract the most
skilled young kids, training them in
their soccer academies and ensur
ing they are already integrated into
then- team even before they must
legally consider actually paying
them.
It seems slightly ironic that a
country known for its dedication to
the capitalist cause is home to a
league with a deeply communist
approach to sharing out money and
talent, and vice versa that a country
proud of its socialist tendencies
boasts such a rampantly free-mar
ket attitude to sports.
Finding agreement from either
side of the Atlantic on which system
is best is impossible though. How
ever much they might moan and
complain about the outcomes, both
sets of fans often hold a deep affini
ty with their own system. The NFL
Draft has a whole culture and ritual
surrounding it, and likewise Janu
ary— or July/August, when the
window for preseason transfers is
open—just wouldn't be the same
without the looming transfer dead
line day, no matter how unfair the
result always is for any team not
owned by an oil sheikh.
The simple, but rather unsatis
fying, truth is that these two sys
tems are inherently tied to the very
foundations of either sport. Replace
revenue sharing, the salary cap and
the draft in the NFL with a free
market transfer window and the
smallest teams would wither and
almost die, just about holding on
simply as a consequence of their
protected franchise status, but
without any hope of a brighter
future.
And with hundreds of
professional and amateur
teams in English soccer, con
nected through promotion
and relegation, it becomes
unthinkable that the most
exciting talent would be sent
down to play for the smallest
clubs. As much as I might
hate to admit it, star striker
Robin van Persie deserves to
be at Premier League lead
ers Manchester United far
more than at League Two
side Accrington Stanley
who are they? Exactly.

The Stanford Daily is in
final negotiations of the
transfer of Tom Taylor to
Accrington Stanley for $1.99
and three dirty socks. To give
