# Mixing sports and faith

### Winston Shi 
Ray Lewis' face is simply
everywhere on
ESPN, of course, but
also The New York
Times, the Wall Street
Journal and before I forget, the Feb. 4
edition of Spoils Illustrated sitting on
my desk. After all, he's not just One-
Time-Super-Bowl-Champion Ray
Lewis but Two-Time-Super-Bowl-
Champion Ray Lewis.
You may not have seen that SI cov
er photo (surprise, surprise, it's Ray
Lewis praying), but more importantly,
the headline goes, "Does God Care
Who Wins The Super Bowl?"
which is a good question come to think
about it, seeing as football might be
the most spiritually inclined sport out
there.
After the Ravens defeated the
Broncos in the playoffs, Lewis went on
the show NFL Gameday Final and
discussed how (and this is an overly
reductive argument of a pretty good
interview) God had helped the Ravens
win the game.
Deion Sanders promptly respond
ed, "I believe Tom Brady is praying, as
well as Arian Foster in Houston."
But God was not to be denied, and
after beating Brady's Patriots in the
AFC Championship, Lewis went on to
say, "For [God's] will to happen this
way, I could never ask for anything
else."
No\y God messing with the score
board is one of the oldest and most
constantly discussed tropes in spoils
(TEBOW TEBOW TEBOW), and
I'm sure you know all of the argu
ments (TEBOW TEBOW TEBOW
TEBOW TEBOW). Even so, under
standing this issue has never stopped
most sports fans from resorting to reli
gion when their spoils teams suck.
I don't mean to trash Ray Lewis'
religion at all; as a Christian, I often
find myself praying at sporting events,
blindly hoping that God will lend me a
handâ€”whether in the incarnation of
the LA Lakers, or the LA Dodgers or,
more recently, the Stanford Cardinal.
(God has been very kind to me.)
So is there fate in sports? The pop
ular webcomic xkcd once compared
spoils to a "random number genera
tor." I think that that argument
belongs in the dustbin. I certainly
don't think I am alone in this belief.
According to a recent poll, 27 percent
of Americans think that God personal
ly influences who wins and loses foot
ball games. Twenty-seven percent of
Americans think that God is like a
spiritual Buffalo Wild Wings commer
cial.
Isn't this a little ridiculous , you
may ask, and you are right. Aren't
there Royals fans who believe
in God ? (I really don't want to pick
on Cleveland.) FVom personal expe
rience, I know that yes, there are
Christian Royals fans.
Despite what I just said, putting
my rational thinker cap on, I don't
actually believe that God cares
about the score of the football game.
I am not part of the 27 percent, not
that that stops me from muttering
prayers to Jesus in the stands. (I
draw the line at switching religions.)
Admittedly, I have never gone to
a Stanford game in which the Cardi
nal has lost, but I don't expect that
to continue. If sports are a Biblical
metaphor for life, then that is only
true insofar as they teach us that
bad things often happen to good
people (a la Job, Adam and the
Teacher from Ecclesiastes) and vice
versa.
This last thought is an excellent
lead-in to what may well be the
greatest paragraph ever written in
any language, tweeted by San Fran
cisco native Stevie Johnson (for con
text, Johnson had just dropped a
potential game-winning touchdown
a few hours earlier): "I PRAISE
YOU 24/7!!!!!! AND THIS HOW
YOU DO ME!!!!! YOU EXPECT
ME TO LEARN FROM THIS???
HOW???!!! I'LL NEVER FORGET
THIS!! EVER!!! THX THO."
I just love the last part.
"Thanks, though."
So we've seen that yes, players
do blame God when they screw up
(small sample size, I know) which
is only the logical extension of Ray
Lewis saying that God's will was for
him to win the Super Bowl. Knowing
this, coming from the perspective of
a sporting agnostic, is there a differ
ence between believing that God
makes victory possible and decid
ing that God makes victory cer
tain''.
When Matt Kemp points at the
sky after a home run, is he thanking
God for allowing him that achieve
ment, or for personally making that
ball go into the stands? Perhaps
Lewis, Kemp and Co. are just being
