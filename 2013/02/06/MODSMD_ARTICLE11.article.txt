# HEAT'S ON IN ARIZONA

### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford heads to Arizona this week with a
chance to prove how good or not it really is.
Two weeks ago, Stanford was sitting at 2-4 in
the Pac-12 and licking its wounds from a 21-point
loss at Colorado. Everyone thought they knew
how good the Cardinal was, but in the end it was
not very.
Since then Stanford has won three straight
games and is creeping back into the crowded Pac
-12 race.
The Cardinal (14-8,5-4) blew out 2-7 Utah the
following game, which was nothing really to get
excited over. Then it also beat Oregon State,
which at 1-8 has the only record worse than Utah
in the Pac-12.
The other win during this run, however a
76-52 shellacking of then No. 10 Oregon at
Maples Pavilion did raise a few eyebrows.
A win at No. 7 Arizona tonight would show
that the marquee win was no fluke, and that it
wasn't just about Oregon's star point guard,
Dominic Artis, being hurt. It would also put Stan
ford just a game behind Arizona in the confer
ence standings.
On the other hand, losses this weekend to Ari
zona (19-2,7-2 Pac-12) and Arizona State (17-5,6-
3) would throw the Cardinal right back into medi
ocrity, both within the league and in the NCAA
Tournament picture.
The three-game winning streak has, at the
very least, given the Cardinal confidence and a
we-can-beat-anybody mindset.
"Guys are refusing to lose out there, and if we
keep that mentality, I think the sky's the limit for
us," said sophomore guard Chasson Randle after
the team's close victory over Oregon State.
With Stanford's overwhelming offensive pro
duction over the last three games, it is easy to get
swept up in the current tailwind of confidence.
The team shot a combined 31-54 from behind the
arc during the streak, an immense improvement
from its .341 season percentage.
Randle, seemingly back to last season's scor
ing form, averaged 18 points a game, up from his
14.2 season average.
While Randle has done the most damage,
Stanford has had balance as well. Four players
have scored in double digits in each of the past
three games.
Junior forward Josh Huestis even gained
recognition as Pac-12 Player of the Week for his
offensive and defensive production during the
Oregon and Oregon State wins. He averaged a
double-double with 15 points and 13 rebounds
while also coming up with 2.5 blocks per game.
"Man, Josh is like an eraser up there," said
Randle of Heustis' defensive play of late. 'Any
thing that gets up to the basket, I'm counting on
him to take it out, and most of the time he does."
Arizona has only lost twice this season, both
times to top conference opponents. The Pac-12's
first-place team lost at Oregon as well as at home
to UCLA after going undefeated in non-confer
ence play, which included a standout victory over
Florida.
The Wildcats have three players averaging
over 13 points per game (ppg), with senior guard

Mark Lyons leading the squad with 14.9 ppg.
During the Pac-12 season, he has improved that
average to nearly 17 ppg.
Senior forward Solomon Hill and sophomore
guard Nick Johnson are the other top scorers for
Arizona. Hill also leads the team in rebounds and
three-point shooting percentage.
Arizona is in the midst of a three-game win
ning streak of its own. While that ties the longest
streak of Stanford's season, the Wildcats opened
the year with 14 wins in a row.

That kind of streak is so far away for Stanford
that it cannot even be seen over the horizon, but
wins this week would bring such aspirations a lot
closer to shore.
"We've set new standards for ourselves," said
junior forward Dwight Powell after the Oregon
State win.
Well, today is the first day to live up to those
standards or not.
