# TCU PULLS UPSET
## 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
On the heels of winning two
straight matches against top-50
teams, the Stanford men's tennis
team came up short on Tuesday
afternoon, falling to TCU on the
Cardinal's home court.

Dropping six of the nine
matches that were played on the
day, the No. 19 Cardinal (3-2)
played catch-up from the start
against a deep TCU squad (5-2)
that has won four of its last five
contests.
Things looked ominous right
off the bat when the Horned
Frogs took the first two matches
in doubles play to take an early 1-
0 overall lead. TCU's top pair,
Nick Chappell and Will Stein,
shut down the Cardinal's No. 1
duo of sophomore John Morrissey
and senior Matt Kandath. The
second doubles match had a simi
lar ending, with TCU's Max
Stevens and JT Sundling taking
down Stanford's junior Jamin Ball
and freshman Trey Strobel 8-4.
"We know [TCU] has a very
good team," said Ball, in the break
between singles and doubles play.
"We knew it was going to be a
tough matchup. Their guys were
all ready to play and they have a
great coach. We knew all the
matches were going to be dog
fights."
The one bright spot for the
Cardinal in the first portion of the
contest was the impressive play of
the No. 3 duo of Maciek
Romanowicz and Robert Stine
man, as the freshman pair earned
a hard-fought 8-4 victory over
Arnau Dachs and Orlando Super
lano.
Morrissey, currently ranked
No. 39 in the nation, did his job on

court No. 1 with a 7-5, 7-5 win
over TCU's top player Nick Chap
pell. Coming into the season, Mor
rissey faced the challenging task
of filling the large shoes of
Bradley Klahn, one of the best
players in school history who
earned All-Pac-12 honors all four
years and cruised through the

2010 NCAA Singles Champi
onship. But the sophomore star
has only just taken advantage of
that opportunity and asserted
himself as Stanford's new top
player by winning his past three
singles matches.
