## Card says 'aloha' to new year STANFORD STARTS SEASON AT AMER ARI 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
No. 15 Stanford men's golf
starts the spring season today in
Hawaii at the 22nd annual Amer
Ari Invitational. Competition will
be stiff as the Card goes up against
five of the top 10 teams in the
nation.
"All the teams there are com
petitive," head coach Conrad Ray
told GoStanford.com. "It's a type of
course where you can make a birdie
or an eagle or a couple of those in a
row pretty quickly. I think if we're
about our own business, worrying
about the course and just trying to
shoot as low as we can, save shots,
manage our team stuff mentally
and manage the golf ball if there's
some wind, that'll lead us to where
we want to go."
Last year Stanford placed third
at 844 (-20), led by sophomore
Patrick Rodgers. Rodgers won
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year last
season and earned first team All-
American honors. This fall he cap
tured the US Collegiate Champi
onship and Australian Master of
the Amateurs World Cup and was
recently named to the Ben Hogan
Award Watch List.
"I have been working hard this
off-season and implementing some
new things into my game,"
Rodgers told GoStanford. "I chose
to come to Stanford for many rea
sons but one of them is the depth of
talented players on the team. I
really look at all of our guys and
take aspects of their games and try
to learn from that."
This time out Ray will start a
lineup featuring Rodgers, seniors
Andrew Yun and Steve Kearney,
junior Cameron Wilson and fresh
man David Boote. Junior Shane
Lebow will be competing as an indi
vidual.
Yun is the reigning Pac-12 cham
pion and will be going to Hawaii for

the fourth time in his collegiate
career.
Wilson shot a course record 61
at the Gifford Intercollegiate in the
fall after struggling with a back
injury, earning him second place.
The only other Stanford golfer to
accomplish this feat was Tiger
Woods.
Boote, the freshman from Eng
land, finished tied for third at the
Pac-12 Preview.
Kearney nabbed the fifth and
final spot to finish his career at
Stanford with his first appearance
in Hawaii. Always a consistently

good ball striker, Kearney landed
the spot by improving his putting
game.
"We know there's still a long
ways [between] now and the NCAA
Championship in May so the goal
and the message I'll be sending the
guys is to try to pick up lessons as
we go along," Ray told GoStanford.
"Great competition and the oppor
tunity to test against a strong field
will give you a lot of information of
where you need to go."
