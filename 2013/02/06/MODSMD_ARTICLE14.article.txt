## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD My Main Man Frank 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
-r "jr Thencvci" I see Frank, he is
11\ clad in a white chef's coat
V T and hat. The coat accumu
lates smudges of egg whites and
avocado as he cooks breakfast. A
cordless landline phone lives in the
coat's breast pocket. I see him check
the phone often while he flips
omelets throughout the morning,
juggling his many tasks without
showing a hint of strain.
Frank Hassan trusts college stu
dents with his heart. He loves them
without reserve and knows them
better than most professors and
some parents. He wakes up at 3 a.m.
every morning to commute to cam
pus, set up his kitchen and cook the
pancakes, quesadillas and oatmeal
that will be laid out by the time I
stumble into breakfast at 8 a.m.
Frank always greets me before I
have a chance to say hello first.
"Renee, Renee, good morning,
beautiful." We exchange bits of our
selves to the accompaniment of at
least three pans of eggs that Frank
simultaneously watches, shakes and
flips.
Every man is Frank's main man.
Every woman is either beautiful or
gorgeous. But don't let the identical
greetings fool you; Frank knows
every student by name and tries to
learn as much about each individual
as he can in the window when his or
her omelet is cooking. Frank's
favorite part of his job is "in the
morning when I see the students."
The worst part of his job: "leaving
[the students] for the day." In his
own words, "my life is the students."
Frank has two children of his
own, Mohammed and Amira, who
are roughly college-age. He is not in
touch with them. Sitting across from
me at a table by the window in the
Bollard eating club, Frank grows
quiet when I ask him about
Mohammed and Amira. He wipes
his face from forehead to chin sever
al times with a gesture that looks as
if he is trying to wipe away what he
is feeling by wiping away his facial
expression. He looks out from thick
eyebrows with dark, bittersweet
eyes. "I feel old," he confesses. "All
of you guys are my kids' age. Psy
chologically, I feel you replace my
kids." His Egyptian accent is warm
and hoarse.
Frank left Egypt when he was
25, arriving in New York on Oct. 10,
1980. He was en route to becoming a
lawyer in Egypt, but took a detour
that landed him first in Brooklyn,
next in Queens with two kids. After
only three years in New York, he
opened Amira Restaurant, serving a
range from hamburgers to chicken
Parmesan.
When I ask him what people at
Stanford know about him least, he
replies, "People don't know that I'm
educated. I was going to be a
lawyer." After a divorce with his
wife, he moved to California in 1995
and began working at Stanford in
2001, first as a chef in Narnia and
eventually in Suites Dining as the
beloved breakfast cook in Bollard. "I
love it here, and I do my best," he
says. His daily greetings and his
omelets are testaments to that.
When we return to the subject of
Mohammed and Amira, Frank tells
me that he and his son have not spo
ken for eleven years, something to

do with his son's encounters with
drugs. About Amira he seems more
hopeful, but remains firm that if she
wants to have a relationship with
him, she has to contact him first, not
the other way around. I look across
the table by the window, and I see
the man who greets me first every
morning before I can even open my
mouth. He likes to play soccer and
to go to the gym in his free time. He
loves listening to Whitney Houston
so much that he starts beaming just
talking about her. I see his
resilience, his enormous love and a
corner of his sorrow.
His contract with Suites dining
runs year-to-year. The University is
planning to let him go and to con
tract an outside company to do what
Frank has devoted the past ten
years of his life to doing. I don't
know that you can contract a compa
ny to love students the way Frank
does. He tells me that if the Univer
sity has a plan for Suites Dining,
they are keeping him and the other
chefs in the dark. "I want to know
why they want a change, but they
tell us nothing," he says of the pro
posed switch. The terms of his con
tract with Stanford appall me, but
he doesn't seem bitter. Unmoored,
maybe, and suspicious, but this is a
man who seems incapable of ill will.
I can't stop thinking how special
it is to have somebody in your life
who always greets you first, who
makes you feel special and includes
you in his heart without testing you
or asking that you fill out an applica
tion. We stand up from the table by
the window, and Frank hugs me
before I get a chance to hug him
first. The cordless landline phone
has been privy to our entire conver
sation unfolding, without ringing to
announce its presence. He returns
the phone to its home in his breast
pocket, pulls it out to check it again,
returns it to the breast pocket and
walks back to his kitchen.
Monday, he will greet me first.
He will make my omelet and tell me
I'm beautiful, and he will keep feed
ing us with impossible optimism.

For more about the proposed
change in Suites dining, look out
for a feature piece by Miles Unter
reiner coming soon. If you have any
questions for Renee, contact her at

He will make my
omelet and tell me
km beautiful, and
keep feeding me
with impossible
optimism.
