## Mobile food vendor policy changes 
### 
There have been a number of
articles in The Stanford Daily
recently about the new mobile
food vendor policy and its impact on
NetAppetit. I would like to help your
readers better understand why the
policy was implemented and why we
are making no exceptions for any
food truck.
In recent years, the number of
uninvited food trucks coming on
campus (of which NetAppetit is only
one) has increased dramatically.
With this increased interest, Stan
ford felt the need to ensure that the
trucks serving campus operate safe
ly and in a manner consistent with
Stanford's values â€”just as we do
with every business operating on
campus.
The mobile food vendor policies,

like our policies for all food vendors,
require that food trucks serving
campus are properly licensed, have
adequate insurance coverage and
have all required health permits.
We limit their locations to areas
that are safe, with no equipment
blocking sidewalks and with no
customers at risk from passing car
traffic. Trucks are not allowed to
park in areas on campus where we
prohibit commercial activity, such
as the top of the Oval. We also want
to be sure that they operate in a
sustainable manner consistent
with Stanford's zero-waste guide
lines. For example, they should use
recyclable or compostable service
ware and packaging, minimize the
use of plastic and recycle their
waste.

The policies apply equally to all
food trucks, most of which have
served campus for a number of
years. We are treating all trucks in
the same manner because of the
importance of the health and safe
ty of our community and in the
interest of fairness.
All food trucks on campus,
including NetAppetit, were provid
ed with notice of our new require
ments during the week of Nov. 26.
NetAppeit received notice on Nov.
29, four weeks prior to winter clo
sure, which began on Dec. 24, and
nearly six weeks prior to the Jan. 7
implementation date.
During this time, NetAppetit did
not contact any administrative office
at Stanford. It did not contact Off
the Grid until January 17, seven
weeks after they received the notice
and nearly 2 weeks after the new
program was implemented. At this
point, all of the slots for Winter
Quarter were filled.
Off the Grid did not reject
NetAppetit. Instead, it asked
whether NetAppetit would be inter
ested in working outside of Stanford
and invited them to explore becom
ing part of its fleet of trucks. NetAp
petit is also welcome to qualify with
Off the Grid before the end of Feb
ruary in order to be placed in the
rotation of trucks being scheduled at
Stanford for spring quarter.
I hope this helps your readers to
better understand why we have
adopted the new policies and why
they apply to all trucks serving cam
pus, including NetAppetit.
