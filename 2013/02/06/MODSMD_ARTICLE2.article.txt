# University upgrades network
## New campus-wide infrastructure aims to minimize future Internet outages 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
IT Services has started to connect all
Stanford residential networks to a newly
upgraded backbone network in an effort to
reduce the possibility of network failures and
Internet outages such as the one that affect
ed residences across campus last month.
All academic buildings were connected to
the new network by December 2012, and all
residential networks will have been migrated
to the new system by mid-March 2013,
according to Nancy Ware 'B3, director of
strategic planning and communications for IT
Services.
"The purpose of this refresh is to ensure
that we continue to provide Stanford with a
high-performance, highly available network

built with the latest network standards,"
Ware wrote in a statement to The Daily. "The
newly upgraded network is more resilient
and features increased capacity."
The new network is organized into multi
ple Operational Areas, and each area's net
work equipment room is "physically diverse,"
according to Ware, to improve the chances
that the network as a whole will remain
healthy should any piece fail. The Operational
Areas, each of which is independently redun
dant, are linked to each other via multiple 10
Giga-bit per second connections.
Benjamin McKenzie 'l5, residential com
puter consultant in Burbank, expressed his
hope that the new backbone network will
increase network speed for residences that
currently suffer from slow connections.
"We have a relatively strong connection in

Burbank, but I've heard a lot of people in Flo-
Mo [Florence Moore Hall] really complaining
about their wireless connectability," McKen
zie said. "So hopefully that will help."
IT Services migrated three residential
networks Lyman wired, Roble wired and
FloMo wireless to the new backbone net
work in December 2012. Ware said that these
networks represent three different network
types an undergraduate wired network, a
graduate wired network and a wireless net
work— and were upgraded early to "test
operational stability and compatibility."
According to Ware, the network outage on
Jan. 29 motivated IT Services to accelerate
the process of migrating the remaining resi
dential networks to the new backbone net
work. Since Jan. 29, the networks for Gover
nor's Corner, Lagunita Court, Wilbur Hall

and the Row have been connected to the
backbone network. The remaining networks
for the Lyman Graduate Residences, Roble
Hall and FloMo have also been switched over.
A redundant connection for these net
works is expected to be in place by Feb. 8.
Though McKenzie predicted that the net
work migration will not be seamless, he
expressed general optimism about the new
network.

"I've heard that sometimes things can fall
through, so I think there will be a lot of patch
es in the exchange that initially will show up
as issues with people," he said. "In the long
run, hopefully the new infrastructure is more
solid and faster."
