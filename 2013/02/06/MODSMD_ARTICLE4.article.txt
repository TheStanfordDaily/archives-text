## Senate approves ARP,is looking into food trucks 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
unanimously approved the Alternative
Review Process (ARP) a revised
judicial procedure for cases involving
sexual assault, relationship violence,
sexual harassment and stalking at
its Feb. 5 meeting.
If the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) approves the ARP today, it will
proceed to the Faculty Senate for a
vote at its March meeting.
The ARP has been one of the defin
ing issues of this year's Senate. Senate
Chair Branden Crouch 'l4 said that he
was extremely pleased with the fact
that the Senate was able to come to a
consensus and approve the ARP
"It's been a really great move on
our part to tackle this in the short
amount of time that we've had and
really make sure the student body was
informed about it through all of our
public events," Crouch said.
Earlier in the meeting, ASSU
Assistant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 told the Senate that the
Board of Directors of Stanford Stu
dent Enterprises (SSE) had approved
the creation of a Financial Manager
Advisory Committee.
According to Trusheim, this com
mittee will be responsible for bringing
together the legislative and executive
bodies of the ASSU, the SSE and the
financial manager.
"There are actually specific chal
lenges and specific ways to improve
the services we offer students, and we
are really excited that we are creating
a group in order to do this," Trusheim
said.
Trusheim also asked senators to
participate in what he called "the most
important thing we could ever do for
this entire organization" creating a
multi-year plan for the ASSU.
"We expect that the political bodies
have priorities that are going to take
more than one year to accomplish,"
Trusheim said. "We really want to
make sure we are passing those things

down both for posterity and so that
next year's Senate and Execs and GSC
can think about what they want to do
to continue those priorities."
Trusheim encouraged the Senate to
compile lists of the major issues they
have been working on this year to pass
on to future senators for further devel
opment.
"If you have a priority and you have
been working on it, write a summary of
what you did, what you accomplished,
what the major problems are and what
our three-year goal is for that initia
tive," Trusheim said. "We really hope
that this will help the ASSU become a
vision-driven, mission-driven organi
zation that has better multi-year conti
nuity."
The Senate also discussed several
student life issues, including creating
an online reservation system for music
groups to book time in the new Stern
practice room and eliminating the pre
liminary phone evaluation required to
book an in-person appointment with
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS).
Student Life Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5 told senators that he
was looking into Stanford's policy
regarding food trucks on campus after
hearing that the vendor Net Appetit is
no longer allowed to operate on cam
pus due to the University's revised
food truck policy. Bindra said that he is
talking with Chon Vo, who operates
the Net Appetit truck, as well as
ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 and Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3, and will update
senators as the situation develops.
During the funding portion of the
meeting, the Senate approved the
approximately $70,000 in grant pro
posals recommended by the Appropri
ations Committee for general fees
groups hosting spring quarter events.
Senators discussed the grant pro
gram with Director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership Nanci Howe, who
asked whether or not the Appropria-
tions Committee had any
ideas on how the program
could be improved in the
future.
Although Appropriations
Committee Deputy Chair
Kimberly Bacon 'l5 men
tioned the possibility of cre
ating a grant for philan
thropic events in the future,

senators had few other sug
gestions for improving the
selection process.
"It is remarkable how
many applicants there were
and how much was done in
that short period of time,"
said Appropriations Com
mittee Deputy Chair Chris
tos Haveles 'l5. "Our hope
for future years is that if this
was planned with more time
in advance, this would turn
out even better."
After the meeting,
Crouch confirmed that for

mer senator Jack Weller 'l5
is taking a leave of absence
from the Senate.
"He's taking a leave of
absence [and] we're just
really trying to protect his
privacy," Crouch said. "At
this time, we're not sure
what's going on. I don't
think he's going to be
expelled from the Senate,
but I don't know the situa
tion."

Student Life Committee Chair
Viraj Bindra 'l5 told senators that he
was looking into Stanford's policy
regarding food trucks on campus after
hearing that the vendor Net Appetit is
no longer allowed to operate on cam
pus due to the University's revised
food truck policy. Bindra said that he is
talking with Chon Vo, who operates
the Net Appetit truck, as well as
ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 and Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3, and will update
senators as the situation develops.
During the funding portion of the
meeting, the Senate approved the
approximately $70,000 in grant pro
posals recommended by the Appropri
ations Committee for general fees
groups hosting spring quarter events.
Senators discussed the grant pro
gram with Director of Student Activi
ties and Leadership Nanci Howe, who
asked whether or not the Appropria-
tions Committee had any
ideas on how the program
could be improved in the
future.
Although Appropriations
Committee Deputy Chair
Kimberly Bacon 'l5 men
tioned the possibility of cre
ating a grant for philan
thropic events in the future,

senators had few other sug
gestions for improving the
selection process.
"It is remarkable how
many applicants there were
and how much was done in
that short period of time,"
said Appropriations Com
mittee Deputy Chair Chris
tos Haveles 'l5. "Our hope
for future years is that if this
was planned with more time
in advance, this would turn
out even better."
After the meeting,
Crouch confirmed that for

mer senator Jack Weller 'l5
is taking a leave of absence
from the Senate.
"He's taking a leave of
absence [and] we're just
really trying to protect his
privacy," Crouch said. "At
this time, we're not sure
what's going on. I don't
think he's going to be
expelled from the Senate,
but I don't know the situa
tion."
