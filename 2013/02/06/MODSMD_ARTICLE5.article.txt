## Researchers find that independence is better motivator than interdependence 
### â€” Olivia Moure 
Promoting independent thought can stim
ulate greater output in individuals, while pro
moting interdependent though has little posi
tive impact on individuals' motivation and can
in fact decrease it, according to a new study by
Stanford psychologists.
The study, which was published in the Janu
ary issue of Psychological Science, found that
for white American students, messages of
interdependence had a negative effect on both
a student's level of motivation to complete a
task and on the student's predicted level of
motivation in a hypothetical course about envi
ronmental sustainability.
Students were more likely to support mak
ing the course a University requirement and

predicted that they would put more effort into
the course when the course description includ
ed information about independent behavior
such as developing personal skills and learning
to work independently.
The effect of the messaging, however, was
not consistent across ethnicities. The Asian
American students who participated in the
study did not show differing motivational
results depending on whether they were pre
sented with messages of interdependence or
independence.
These findings confirmed the hypothesis
that white Americans, who have a more histor
ically independent mindset, would respond
more positively to independent messages
rather than interdependent messages, accord
ing to the study.
The study was conducted by Professor of
Psychology Hazel Markus, Center for Compar
ative Studies in Race and Ethnicity Associate
Director Mar Yam Hamedami Ph.D. 'OB and
fourth-year graduate psychology student
Alyssa Fu.
"Currently, if we want to inspire Americans

to think and act interdependently, it may work
best to actually emphasize their independence
to motivate them to do so," Hamedani told the
Stanford News Service.
