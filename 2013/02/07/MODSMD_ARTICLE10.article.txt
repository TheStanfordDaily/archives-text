# Tight ends could make impact early
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Recruiting analysis is
an inherently hypo
critical business. In a
good year, we write
about all these highly
ranked players that will change our
team's future; in a bad year, we just
complain that recruiting rankings
are worthless anyway.
There's a whole lot of truth to
both perspectives. Yes, Stanford's
fifth-ranked class of 2012 has
already made an impact, and yes, the
Cardinal's 50th-ranked class of 2008
drastically changed the complexion
of the Stanford football program. (I
see you, Mr. Luck.)
This year's class probably falls
somewhere between those two
extremes. Due to the return of sev
eral fifth-year seniors, only 12 play
ers will join the Cardinal this offsea
son compared with 22 a year ago
which makes for the sixth-small
est class in the nation, according to
Rivals. Since the crop of incoming
freshmen is so small, the class was
ranked as low as 64th in the nation
(and no higher than 39th) on Signing
Day.
For the very near future, the tiny
class is actually a great thing for
Stanford fans. Who wouldn't rather
have a redshirt senior over a fresh
man during the 2013 season?
But when these incoming fresh
men are seniors in four years,
there's going to be a whole lot of
pressure on the Cardinal's next
group of recruits (which should be
much larger than this one) to step
up. It's quite possible that Stanford
will lose three stalling linemen, Bar
ry Sanders and Kevin Hogan on
offense alone during a single off
season, leaving behind just the 12
seniors as Stanford's elder states
men. Junior leadership could very
well define the 2016 season.
By then, college football will have
a playoff and the Pac-12 might not be
12 any longer. I don't know about
you, but I can't quite think that far
ahead. So who in the class of 2013 is
poised to make an impact early in
their career, say, next season?
Of course, the temptation is to
look to the highest-rated recruits:
quarterback Ryan Burns, linebacker
Peter Kalambayi and wide receiver
Francis Owusu. Each earned four
stars from Rivals, which, for refer
ence, is better than current Stanford
three-star starters Hogan and safety
Jordan Richards.
Don't expect to see Burns in
2013. It took the skillful Hogan a
year and a half to master enough of
Stanford's complex playbook to earn
playing time and even Luck was
benched as a freshman. Even though
he has a chance to eventually unseat
a fellow Virginian in Hogan as Stan
ford's starter, Burns will probably be
behind older passers Josh Nunes,
Dallas Lloyd and Evan Crower for
2013 unless the coaching staff
decides to go back on what has
worked so well in the past.
It might also take some time for
Kalambayi, who is rated even higher
than Burns, to break into the rota
tion. The last Stanford recruit at
Kalambayi's position to play fre
quently as a freshman was James
Vaughters, who even as a sophomore
last year seemed to fade to the back
of the Cardinal's inside linebacker
rotation at the end of 2012. Stan
ford's front seven is still stacked, and
Scout.com had speed listed one of
Kalambayi's areas for improvement
a dangerous fault in a conference
that boasts Oregon, Arizona, Wash
ington State and other spread
attacks.
Owusu, on the other hand, could
be an impact player instantly. The
Cardinal lost five of its top six pass
catchers in the offseason and hasn't
been solid at wide receiver since
2010. Given Owusu's pedigree his
brother, Chris, starred as a Stanford
kick returner and receiver from
2008-11 and got to play as a fresh
man Cardinal fans could see him
on Saturdays pretty soon. And since
Stanford lost out on other big-name
receivers such as Devon Allen and
Jordan Cunningham this recruiting
season, the pressure will be on
Owusu right away.
Meanwhile, three-star recruits
Eric Cotton, Austin Hooper and
Greg Taboada will be locked in an
intriguing competition at tight end,
which is suddenly the least experi
enced position on Stanford's roster.
It's a tough position for a fresh
man to play in the Cardinal's physi
cal offense the feat was accom
plished by neither Jim Dray, Coby
Fleener, Zach Ertz nor Levine
Toilolo. But the new tight ends fit
well in Stanford's system, much like
last year's defensive back recruits did.
Though only one true freshman, Alex Carter,
started in Stanford's resurgent 2012 second
ary, two others, Drew Madhu and Zach Hoff
pauir, played in all 14 games as three-star
recruits, no less. Maybe Cotton, Hooper and
Taboada will get a chance of their own in 2013.
Overall, a sense of cautious optimism per

meates most analysis of this class. After
years of recruiting so well, Stanford's coach
ing staff has earned a lot of trust that it will
bring in players that fit its system and will
star on Saturdays, even if not on scouting
reports.
And besides, we all know recruiting rank
ings suck anyways.
