## NO. 7 CATS ESCAPE CARD 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
For just over 35 minutes, Stanford was the
best men's basketball team in the Pac-12. But No.
7 Arizona put the Cardinal in its place by closing
out a 73-66 battle at a packed McKale Memorial
Center one of the toughest arenas to visit in
college basketball on Wednesday night.

Stanford led for the entire first half, and had
the lead as late as the 4:44 mark in a back-and
forth second half. Arizona came out flat and the
Card capitalized early on the Wildcats complacen

cy. In the end, though, Arizona's senior guard
Mark Lyons and senior forward Solomon Hill
were just too good.
Lyons, who at times seemed like Arizona's only
viable offensive option, finished with a season high
25 points while going 3-for-6 from the three point
line to secure the Wildcats lead in the end. Hill fin
ished with 23 points, while no other Wildcat
recorded more than eight points.
"Their seniors really stepped up," said Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "Lyons and Hill
made a big difference in the end there."
Stanford did all it could to win, and after
absorbing blow after blow from the Wildcats at its
own stadium, the Cardinal looked poised to pull
off its biggest upset in the Johnny Dawkins era.
