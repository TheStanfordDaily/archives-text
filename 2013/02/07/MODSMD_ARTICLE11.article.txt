## NO. 7 CATS ESCAPE CARD 
### DAVID PEREZ STAFF WRITER 
For just over 35 minutes, Stanford was the
best men's basketball team in the Pac-12. But No.
7 Arizona put the Cardinal in its place by closing
out a 73-66 battle at a packed McKale Memorial
Center one of the toughest arenas to visit in
college basketball on Wednesday night.

Stanford led for the entire first half, and had
the lead as late as the 4:44 mark in a back-and
forth second half. Arizona came out flat and the
Card capitalized early on the Wildcats complacen

cy. In the end, though, Arizona's senior guard
Mark Lyons and senior forward Solomon Hill
were just too good.
Lyons, who at times seemed like Arizona's only
viable offensive option, finished with a season high
25 points while going 3-for-6 from the three point
line to secure the Wildcats lead in the end. Hill fin
ished with 23 points, while no other Wildcat
recorded more than eight points.
"Their seniors really stepped up," said Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins. "Lyons and Hill
made a big difference in the end there."
Stanford did all it could to win, and after
absorbing blow after blow from the Wildcats at its
own stadium, the Cardinal looked poised to pull
off its biggest upset in the Johnny Dawkins era.

night, but the Cardinal struggled defensively and the Wildcats clawed back to win at home.
points and 10 rebounds, four
Stanford players finished in
double digits scoring. Powell
and junior forward Josh
Huestis (10 points, 10
rebounds) both finished with
double-doubles. Powell
recorded 18 of his points in
the second half alone, keep
ing a win within Stanford's
grasp late in the game.
"Even though tonight
was a loss, we came out and
showed we can hang with
anyone in the country,"
Huestis said. "We let things
down in the last couple of
minutes and that's where we
lost it."
Sophomore point guard
Aaron Bright, who, for much
of the game seemed to be the
only response to Lyons, had
one of his most efficient
shooting nights to date, scor
ing 16 points on 6-11 from
the floor and 4-7 from down
town. Hitting a pair of threes

to start the game, Bright
helped Stanford go on a 10-0
run early on.
Stanford knew that its
only chance of scoring
against a tight wildcat
defense was to hit early and
often from outside. Unfortu
nately, the Card struggled
for the rest of the first half
finishing 8-27.
With three and a half
minutes left in the game,
Lyons slipped behind a giddy
Stanford defense for a layup
to put Arizona up 58-54. The
basket marked a 9-0 Wildcat
run, and the crowd was fully
behind the Pac-12's first
place team as Arizona
stormed down both ends of
the court determined to
avoid an upset.
On the next possession,
Bright knocked down a three
from the corner, and Stan
ford was once again within a
point. With a silenced arena,
the upset seemed as likely as
ever.
Then sophomore guard
Chasson Randle was called
for an offensive foul, Hill
made a jumper to put Ari

zona up 6, and the Cardinal
never closed that final gap,
losing its seventh straight
game to the Wildcats.
"I think we played well
offensively tonight, but the
lack of defense was what
killed us. It doesn't matter
how well you play on offense
if you have defensive lapses
against a high-scoring
team," Powell said. "In the
beginning of the game, we
were getting stops. We were
executing on offense and we
were on point on defense. In
the second half, we didn't
make out as well, and when
ever you have defensive
lapses like that things go
south."
The Card now looks to
redeem itself at Arizona
State 4 p.m. Saturday. The
Sun Devils are currently
ranked third in the Pac-12,
while Stanford sits at sev
enth. A win over Arizona
State could help the Card
relocate its path to the
NCAA tournament.
