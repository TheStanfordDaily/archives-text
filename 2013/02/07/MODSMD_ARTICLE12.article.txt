## NEW 'TRUE CENTER' A TRUE FIT OSER SIGNS WITH CARD WEDNESDAY 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
At 10 a.m. Wednesday morning
with just a fax to Stanford's football office
new football signee Thomas Oser's
path to Stanford was finally complete.
In an academic sense, Oser seemed
destined to end up at Stanford for a long
time. For anyone with questions about
Oser's qualifications to be a Stanford stu
dent, look no further than the two schools
Oser has attended over the last six years.
Oser comes to Stanford from Harvard-
Westlake, an elite prep school in Southern
California that is known for sending many
of its alumni to every incoming Stanford
class. But don't let Oser's time in sunny
Los Angeles fool you he's an East
coast kid whose New Jersey roots play a
large role in his identity.
I first encountered Thomas Oser five
years ago, during my sophomore year of
high school and Oser's first year on The
Pingry School's middle-school football
team. I didn't know much about him, but
every time I wandered over to middle
school football practice from our high
school team's warm-ups, I noticed Oser as
the baby-faced, smiling kid with an infec
tious personality who was by far the
biggest on the field.
Over the next two years, Oser became
a familiar face. He kept growing cur
rently he is listed at 6-foot-5, 275 pounds
and we started to see that Oser could
potentially become a very good football
player.
This was the cause of a lot of local anx
iety. Pingry is a prestigious school aca
demically, but in sports besides soccer,
many of the brightest middle-school stars
leave for more promising athletic pro
grams. In no sport is that more evident
than football; the middle school team is
consistently one of the best in its confer
ence, but the high school team has just
two playoff appearances since 2006
this past fall and 2009, my senior year.
But Oser was ready to buck that
trend. He was focused on academics, the
good relationship with his class and a
chance to help put Pingry on the map.
However, late in his eighth-grade year,
Oser found out his family was moving to
Los Angeles.
"It was really strange," Oser said.
"We didn't find out we were moving until
April. I had to do the application process
for high school later than everyone else."
Oser chose Harvard-Westlake to
maintain the level of academics he had
grown accustomed to. The level of compe
tition on the football field, however, was a
big jump.
Back at Pingry, Oser was
the biggest player on the
field. As a freshman at Har
vard-Westlake, he wasn't so
lucky.

"I got my butt kicked the
first week and all year," Oser
said. "The game was much
faster than I was used to."
But Oser wasn't as far
over his head as one might
expect. He became one of
three players in his grade to
make varsity, earning his
first playing time midway
through the season. By the
time his sophomore year
rolled around, Oser felt that
he had the experience to
make a big jump.
As it turned out, Oser's
coaches agreed. Though he
was just a sophomore, they
started him at left tackle, the
offensive line's most promi
nent position.
After a successful cam
paign, Oser came into his
junior year expecting to con
tinue in his starting role on
the left side of the line. How
ever, with Harvard-West
lake's center out with an
injury, Oser's coach asked
him to try taking a few
snaps. Soon Oser moved to
center, and hasn't left since.
At first, Oser was a bit
disappointed to make the
move. Historically, the left
tackle position is the where
the most dominant player on
the line plays. In the NFL,

protecting the right-handed
quarterback's blind side is a
valued service. On average,
starting left tackles are the
second-highest paid players
behind starting quarter
backs.
But once Oser started
getting into the action at
center, everything changed.
Oser grew to love the "close
combat" situations on the
interior of the offensive line.
"I'm right in the thick of it,"
Oser said.
Oser would find out very
soon that college coaches
liked the move as much as he
did. One day during his jun
ior year, Oser got a surprise
visit from Stanford offensive
line coach Mike Bloomgren
recently named the Car
dinal's offensive coordinator
who invited him to the
team's summer prospect
camp.
"I went up there and
played my butt off," Oser
said of the camp, and head
coach David Shaw was so
impressed with Oser's play
that he offered Oser a schol
arship. At the end of a
recruiting process that saw
Oregon and Vanderbilt join
Stanford as the favorites,
Oser decided to accept
Shaw's offer and join the
defending Rose Bowl cham
pions for 2013.
"Stanford was always a
prospect of mine. It's a
school I've been interested
in since even before football
became a reality," Oser said.
"Coming out of Pingry and
coming out of Harvard-
Westlake, you're looking to
go to one of the top schools

academically."
With starter Sam
Schwartzstein's eligibility
ending after last season,
Stanford's center spot is
open to competition. As a
true freshman Oser is cer
tainly a long shot, but he
might be closer than many
think.
Many in the recruiting
business have enjoyed refer
ring to Oser as a "true-cen
ter." Oser was in a rare posi
tion as a high-school center;
most top offensive-line
recruits are forced to play
tackle in high-school due to a
large talent gap, but Oser
spent two years with an
estimated 700 shotgun snaps
in that center spot. That
experience could give Oser a
huge step up in his transition
to the college game.
Shaw certainly liked see
ing his success as a high
school center. At his press
conference announcing
Stanford football's signing
class yesterday, Shaw sung
praise of Oser.
"It's a unique skill to be
able to put the ball between
your legs and be able to
explode out and block some
body that's in front of you,"
he said.
And now, almost four
years after Oser's move to
California robbed me of a
chance to be his teammate
for a year, I have the oppor
tunity to cover his first sea
son as a member of Stanford
football. I'm just glad he
doesn't get to block me.

disappointed to make the
move. Historically, the left
tackle position is the where
the most dominant player on
the line plays. In the NFL,

protecting the right-handed
quarterback's blind side is a
valued service. On average,
starting left tackles are the
second-highest paid players
behind starting quarter
backs.
But once Oser started
getting into the action at
center, everything changed.
Oser grew to love the "close
combat" situations on the
interior of the offensive line.
"I'm right in the thick of it,"
Oser said.
Oser would find out very
soon that college coaches
liked the move as much as he
did. One day during his jun
ior year, Oser got a surprise
visit from Stanford offensive
line coach Mike Bloomgren
recently named the Car
dinal's offensive coordinator
who invited him to the
team's summer prospect
camp.
"I went up there and
played my butt off," Oser
said of the camp, and head
coach David Shaw was so
impressed with Oser's play
that he offered Oser a schol
arship. At the end of a
recruiting process that saw
Oregon and Vanderbilt join
Stanford as the favorites,
Oser decided to accept
Shaw's offer and join the
defending Rose Bowl cham
pions for 2013.
"Stanford was always a
prospect of mine. It's a
school I've been interested
in since even before football
became a reality," Oser said.
"Coming out of Pingry and
coming out of Harvard-
Westlake, you're looking to
go to one of the top schools

academically."
With starter Sam
Schwartzstein's eligibility
ending after last season,
Stanford's center spot is
open to competition. As a
true freshman Oser is cer
tainly a long shot, but he
might be closer than many
think.
Many in the recruiting
business have enjoyed refer
ring to Oser as a "true-cen
ter." Oser was in a rare posi
tion as a high-school center;
most top offensive-line
recruits are forced to play
tackle in high-school due to a
large talent gap, but Oser
spent two years with an
estimated 700 shotgun snaps
in that center spot. That
experience could give Oser a
huge step up in his transition
to the college game.
Shaw certainly liked see
ing his success as a high
school center. At his press
conference announcing
Stanford football's signing
class yesterday, Shaw sung
praise of Oser.
"It's a unique skill to be
able to put the ball between
your legs and be able to
explode out and block some
body that's in front of you,"
he said.
And now, almost four
years after Oser's move to
California robbed me of a
chance to be his teammate
for a year, I have the oppor
tunity to cover his first sea
son as a member of Stanford
football. I'm just glad he
doesn't get to block me.

At 10 a.m. Wednesday morning
with just a fax to Stanford's football office
new football signee Thomas Oser's
path to Stanford was finally complete.
In an academic sense, Oser seemed
destined to end up at Stanford for a long
time. For anyone with questions about
Oser's qualifications to be a Stanford stu
dent, look no further than the two schools
Oser has attended over the last six years.
Oser comes to Stanford from Harvard-
Westlake, an elite prep school in Southern
California that is known for sending many
of its alumni to every incoming Stanford
class. But don't let Oser's time in sunny
Los Angeles fool you he's an East
coast kid whose New Jersey roots play a
large role in his identity.
I first encountered Thomas Oser five
years ago, during my sophomore year of
high school and Oser's first year on The
Pingry School's middle-school football
team. I didn't know much about him, but
every time I wandered over to middle
school football practice from our high
school team's warm-ups, I noticed Oser as
the baby-faced, smiling kid with an infec
tious personality who was by far the
biggest on the field.
Over the next two years, Oser became
a familiar face. He kept growing cur
rently he is listed at 6-foot-5, 275 pounds
and we started to see that Oser could
potentially become a very good football
player.
This was the cause of a lot of local anx
iety. Pingry is a prestigious school aca
demically, but in sports besides soccer,
many of the brightest middle-school stars
leave for more promising athletic pro
grams. In no sport is that more evident
than football; the middle school team is
consistently one of the best in its confer
ence, but the high school team has just
two playoff appearances since 2006
this past fall and 2009, my senior year.
But Oser was ready to buck that
trend. He was focused on academics, the
good relationship with his class and a
chance to help put Pingry on the map.
However, late in his eighth-grade year,
Oser found out his family was moving to
Los Angeles.
"It was really strange," Oser said.
"We didn't find out we were moving until
April. I had to do the application process
for high school later than everyone else."
Oser chose Harvard-Westlake to
maintain the level of academics he had
grown accustomed to. The level of compe
tition on the football field, however, was a
big jump.
Back at Pingry, Oser was
the biggest player on the
field. As a freshman at Har
vard-Westlake, he wasn't so
lucky.

"I got my butt kicked the
first week and all year," Oser
said. "The game was much
faster than I was used to."
But Oser wasn't as far
over his head as one might
expect. He became one of
three players in his grade to
make varsity, earning his
first playing time midway
through the season. By the
time his sophomore year
rolled around, Oser felt that
he had the experience to
make a big jump.
As it turned out, Oser's
coaches agreed. Though he
was just a sophomore, they
started him at left tackle, the
offensive line's most promi
nent position.
After a successful cam
paign, Oser came into his
junior year expecting to con
tinue in his starting role on
the left side of the line. How
ever, with Harvard-West
lake's center out with an
injury, Oser's coach asked
him to try taking a few
snaps. Soon Oser moved to
center, and hasn't left since.
