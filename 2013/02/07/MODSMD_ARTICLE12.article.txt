## NEW 'TRUE CENTER' A TRUE FIT OSER SIGNS WITH CARD WEDNESDAY 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
At 10 a.m. Wednesday morning
with just a fax to Stanford's football office
new football signee Thomas Oser's
path to Stanford was finally complete.
In an academic sense, Oser seemed
destined to end up at Stanford for a long
time. For anyone with questions about
Oser's qualifications to be a Stanford stu
dent, look no further than the two schools
Oser has attended over the last six years.
Oser comes to Stanford from Harvard-
Westlake, an elite prep school in Southern
California that is known for sending many
of its alumni to every incoming Stanford
class. But don't let Oser's time in sunny
Los Angeles fool you he's an East
coast kid whose New Jersey roots play a
large role in his identity.
I first encountered Thomas Oser five
years ago, during my sophomore year of
high school and Oser's first year on The
Pingry School's middle-school football
team. I didn't know much about him, but
every time I wandered over to middle
school football practice from our high
school team's warm-ups, I noticed Oser as
the baby-faced, smiling kid with an infec

biggest on the field.
Over the next two years, Oser became
a familiar face. He kept growing cur
rently he is listed at 6-foot-5, 275 pounds
and we started to see that Oser could
potentially become a very good football
player.
This was the cause of a lot of local anx
iety. Pingry is a prestigious school aca
demically, but in sports besides soccer,
many of the brightest middle-school stars
leave for more promising athletic pro
grams. In no sport is that more evident
than football; the middle school team is
consistently one of the best in its confer
ence, but the high school team has just
two playoff appearances since 2006
this past fall and 2009, my senior year.
But Oser was ready to buck that
trend. He was focused on academics, the
good relationship with his class and a
chance to help put Pingry on the map.
However, late in his eighth-grade year,
Oser found out his family was moving to
Los Angeles.
"It was really strange," Oser said.
"We didn't find out we were moving until
April. I had to do the application process
for high school later than everyone else."
Oser chose Harvard-Westlake to
maintain the level of academics he had
grown accustomed to. The level of compe
tition on the football field, however, was a
