# Stanford hits the beach

### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team makes its
first trek this weekend to southern California to
compete in a double-header against No. 49 Universi
ty of San Diego (1-1) and No. 33 Pepperdine (0-2).
The No. 5 Cardinal (1-0) is fresh off its season open
er victory over UC-Davis last Thursday.
It was an easy win for Stanford, who dropped
just one singles match on court six. Senior captain
Natalie Dillon lost a hard-fought battle to UC-Davis'
Melissa Kobayakawa in a tiebreaker 10-8 she led
the tiebreak 8-3 before Kobayakawa rallied.
"I had a lot of great moments," she said, "but I
need to focus on finishing the match out and convert
ing break points."
Though a clear leader on the roster, Dillon has
experienced only one full year of competition in the
main singles lineup.
"I'm working on improving my mental game and
competing consistently," said Dillon. "It'll be an
emphasis of mine this weekend as well as this season
more generally."
Along with Stacey Tan, Dillon is one of the only
two seniors on the squad. The pair are the only play
ers who were a part of the 2010 NCAA champi
onship team. As a captain and a walk-on, Dillon's
experience can help guide Stanford towards another
title.
"I can serve as an example of what needs to be
done in order to win that title at the end of the year,"
Dillon said. "Coming as a walk-on, my leadership is
more marked by hard work and effort than anything
else."
The Cardinal will continue to work towards that
goal and Dillon will continue to demonstrate that
