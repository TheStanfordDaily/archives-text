# Stanford hits the beach
## 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team makes its
first trek this weekend to southern California to
compete in a double-header against No. 49 Universi
ty of San Diego (1-1) and No. 33 Pepperdine (0-2).
The No. 5 Cardinal (1-0) is fresh off its season open
er victory over UC-Davis last Thursday.
It was an easy win for Stanford, who dropped
just one singles match on court six. Senior captain
Natalie Dillon lost a hard-fought battle to UC-Davis'
Melissa Kobayakawa in a tiebreaker 10-8 she led
the tiebreak 8-3 before Kobayakawa rallied.
"I had a lot of great moments," she said, "but I
need to focus on finishing the match out and convert
ing break points."
Though a clear leader on the roster, Dillon has
experienced only one full year of competition in the
main singles lineup.
"I'm working on improving my mental game and
competing consistently," said Dillon. "It'll be an
emphasis of mine this weekend as well as this season
more generally."
Along with Stacey Tan, Dillon is one of the only
two seniors on the squad. The pair are the only play
ers who were a part of the 2010 NCAA champi
onship team. As a captain and a walk-on, Dillon's
experience can help guide Stanford towards another
title.
"I can serve as an example of what needs to be
done in order to win that title at the end of the year,"
Dillon said. "Coming as a walk-on, my leadership is
more marked by hard work and effort than anything
else."
The Cardinal will continue to work towards that
goal and Dillon will continue to demonstrate that

work ethic this weekend when
they face USD and Pepper
dine. Stanford did not com
pete against USD last year,
but easily topped Pepperdine
with a 5-2 victory last Febru
ary.
The top of the lineup should
consist of junior Nicole Gibbs
on court one, followed by
freshman and No. 2 Krista
Hardebeck on court two, and
junior Kristie Ahn on court
three. Sophomore and No. 55
Ellen Tsay, Tan and Dillon will
represent the Cardinal on
courts four, five, and six.
Doubles will be played with
Gibbs and Ahn competing on
court one, followed by Tan and
Tsay on court two and Dillon
and Hardebeck on court three.
"Krista is a fantastic base
line player with powerful

shots," Dillon explained. "This
gives me the opportunity to
close in at the net, so together
we make a pretty explosive
team."
Practice this week has
especially concentrated on
doubles play. Dillon explained
that, unlike the fall where the
focus was to fine-tune, the
spring emphasis is match play.
"So far practice has been
characterized by a lot of chills
that simulate competition,"
she said. "It's more tailored
and focused to our individual
needs as well."
The Dillon/Hardebeck duo
is the only senior/freshman
pairing. When asked what
advice Dillon would give to
Hardebeck and freshman
Lindsey Kostas, Dillon instead
praised the storied Stanford
program.
"Playing on the Stanford
tennis team is a real honor and
there is a lot of history and
legacy that comes with it," she
said. "One component is

enjoying the experience but
another is putting everything
you have into it because that's
when you get the biggest
returns."
This weekend will mark
Stanford's second opportunity
playing together as a team.
Dillon described how creating
an identity is something the
group has been discussing
recently.
"We are known to be really
big hitters," said Dilllon "but
we also want to be known as
players that grind on the
court, all day and all night. We
are taking that step in terms
of fitness and practice."
The Cardinal will first take
on USD in San Diego 12 p.m.
Friday at the Hogan Tennis
Center. The team will then
travel up to Malibu on Satur
day to face Pepperdine at
Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center
at 1 p.m.
