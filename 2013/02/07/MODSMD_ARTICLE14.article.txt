## THE
						AMERICAN ANATOMY The
						death of privacy 
### Adam Johnson 
lam a kitchen manager for a
house on campus, and almost
every week I head over to Safe
way to buy my residents various
foodstuffs. This Safeway ran is rela
tively minor, often just to purchase
the few products that Costco does
not provide sometimes I will get
Bagel Bites, sometimes Triscuits,
but every time I will pick up a few
boxes of tea. I have a Safeway Club
Card, which not only saves me mon
ey but also gives me a coupon after
almost every purchase. Almost
invariably, my coupons are for tea.
A couple months ago, I started
ramping up my Google searches for
anything related to skiing. As an
avid skier, I check weather reports,
watch You Tube videos of profession
al skiers, and occasionally scan the
online marketplace for gear. Start
ing two weeks ago, I noticed that the
number of ski-related advertise
ments I was getting skyrocketed.
On websites completely unrelated to
skiing the Daily website, for
instance I was being told about
some new ski boot or the amount of
snow Mt. Bachelor has received this
season.
It is no secret that data on users
is collected from social networking
profiles, online searches, credit
cards or rewards cards, magazine
subscriptions and more. Often this
data is used for profit, whether it is
leveraged by the collector or sold to
other companies. What these firms
do with the data is generally kept
secret, although you can bet that
many of the coupons you receive and
advertisements you see online can
be traced in some way back to your
consumption history.
Many people expound on the
benefits of data collection; in my
case, I certainly would rather get
coupons for tea than dish soap, and I
would rather see ads for ski resorts
than tax services. Others try to rea
son away the costs of privacy loss by
stating that "if you've done nothing
wrong, you have nothing to hide."
Yet we never know when we may
want to keep certain information
private. There is the case of how
Target knew a teenager in Minneso
ta was pregnant before her family
did; this teenager likely purchased
some combination of supplements,
lotions and other products that
pregnant women buy. As a result,
Target sent her a coupon book filled
with coupons for diapers, formula,
and other baby items. Her father
happened upon this coupon book
and, after questioning his daughter,
learned she was pregnant.
In this case, not only was infor
mation that many would consider
private discovered and exploited by
profit-seeking third parties, but it
was shared prematurely with those
close to the user. Who knows when
you may be exposed for something
that, while not illegal or immoral,
you would rather have kept private?
For another scenario, it is not
hard to imagine a future where

insurance companies are armed
with knowledge of an individual's
consumption habits how many
cigarettes or hamburgers he buys a
week, for instance and can lever
age this information to their advan
tage (your disadvantage).
Perhaps this is already occur
ring.
Arkansas-based Acxiom Corpo
ration has detailed profiles up to
about 1,500 data points for
roughly two-thirds of the US popu
lation and analyzes over 50 trillion
data transactions per year. Acxiom
then processes this information,
placing users into one of 70 con
sumer types, and sells its findings to
interested corporations. In 2012,
Acxiom had revenue of 1.2 billion
dollars.
Are we powerless to respond to
this? For five dollars and a few
weeks' waiting time, we can see our
personal files that Acxiom keeps in
stock; we can also opt out of their
data pool entirely, although this
process requires providing them
with more information. Another
increasingly popular option is to
make purchases, especially sensitive
ones, using cash.
Perhaps government can play a
role. Although many people associ
ate "Big Brother" with a govern
ment entity, in this case the corpo
rate sector is the enemy and govern
ment could become our ally. Con
gress passed the Fair Credit Report
Act, for instance, which allowed con
sumers to view their credit reports
for free. Perhaps they could require
corporations like Acxiom to share
their information with consumers
more readily, or could regulate what
information can be collected and
acted upon. If the data collection
sector remains largely unregulated
and out of the public consciousness,
there is no telling what's next.
