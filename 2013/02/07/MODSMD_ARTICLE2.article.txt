# Demand up for CAPS services
## New board examines mental health 
### BRITTANY TORREZ 
Amid increasing concerns about
mental health awareness on campus
and growing student usage of Stan
ford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), subcommittees of
the University's newly established
Mental Health and Well-Being
Advisory Board will present a set of
ideas and findings produced this
academic year to a board meeting
later this month.
The board, co-chaired by CAPS
director Ron Albucher and Associ
ate Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Sally Dickson, was created last
spring in response to the recom
mendations of a 2008 report on cam
pus mental health. The board con
sists of 24 members including
students, faculty and staff â€”with a
range of backgrounds and experi
ence in mental health, and has met
twice since its formation.
Albucher framed the approach
ing board meeting as a means of
synthesizing the work of the board's
five subcommittees, which have
addressed topics ranging from cur
rent issues and trends in mental
health to student relationships and
how those affect mental well-being.
"The goal of the upcoming meet
ing that we're having is to kind of
being to pull all of that together, look
for areas of overlap, simplify things
and then figure out our next steps,"

Albucher said.
According to Alejandro Mar
tinez, senior associate director for
consultation and liaison at CAPS,
challenges surrounding mental
health are more prominent around
week five of the quarter as academ
ic stress accumulates, prompting
further examination by the board's
subcommittees. Ultimately, howev
er, the board will focus on the entire
ty of campus mental health issues,
according to Dickson.
"We look at some of the experi
ences that Stanford students bring
to campus and we look at what new
stressors are created while being

here," Dickson said. "It's something
we have to be on top of at all times
and this advisory board is an exam
ple of our effort to do that."
The subcommittees' reports will
come at a time when interest in and
awareness about mental health on
campus has become increasingly
widespread, according to University
administrators.
"One of the biggest changes I've
seen in the past year is the amount
of interest and commitment that
students have in the area of mental

health," Martinez said.
Martinez cited a surge in enrol
ment in EDUC 193P: Peer Counsel
ing at the Bridge, a class that he
teaches through the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and that
instructs students on the basics of
counseling and mental health, as
evidence of that increased interest
among students. Seventy-nine stu
dents are currently enrolled in the
class, compared to 46 last quarter.
