# Demand up for CAPS services
## New board examines mental health 
### BRITTANY TORREZ 
Amid increasing concerns about
mental health awareness on campus
and growing student usage of Stan
ford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), subcommittees of
the University's newly established
Mental Health and Well-Being
Advisory Board will present a set of
ideas and findings produced this
academic year to a board meeting
later this month.
The board, co-chaired by CAPS
director Ron Albucher and Associ
ate Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Sally Dickson, was created last
spring in response to the recom
mendations of a 2008 report on cam
pus mental health. The board con
sists of 24 members including
students, faculty and staff —with a
range of backgrounds and experi
ence in mental health, and has met
twice since its formation.
Albucher framed the approach
ing board meeting as a means of
synthesizing the work of the board's
five subcommittees, which have
addressed topics ranging from cur
rent issues and trends in mental
health to student relationships and
how those affect mental well-being.
"The goal of the upcoming meet
ing that we're having is to kind of
being to pull all of that together, look
for areas of overlap, simplify things
and then figure out our next steps,"

Albucher said.
According to Alejandro Mar
tinez, senior associate director for
consultation and liaison at CAPS,
challenges surrounding mental
health are more prominent around
week five of the quarter as academ
ic stress accumulates, prompting
further examination by the board's
subcommittees. Ultimately, howev
er, the board will focus on the entire
ty of campus mental health issues,
according to Dickson.
"We look at some of the experi
ences that Stanford students bring
to campus and we look at what new
stressors are created while being

here," Dickson said. "It's something
we have to be on top of at all times
and this advisory board is an exam
ple of our effort to do that."
The subcommittees' reports will
come at a time when interest in and
awareness about mental health on
campus has become increasingly
widespread, according to University
administrators.
"One of the biggest changes I've
seen in the past year is the amount
of interest and commitment that
students have in the area of mental

health," Martinez said.
Martinez cited a surge in enrol
ment in EDUC 193P: Peer Counsel
ing at the Bridge, a class that he
teaches through the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and that
instructs students on the basics of
counseling and mental health, as
evidence of that increased interest
among students. Seventy-nine stu
dents are currently enrolled in the
class, compared to 46 last quarter.

The University's new Mental Health and Well-Being Advisory Board
will bring together a range of suggestions regarding addressing
aspects of mental health on campus at a meeting later this month.
"That for me is really sig
nificant," Martinez said. "It
indicates to me an increased
attention to the issue of psy
chological well being, but
most importantly an interest
on the part of students to
want to help and make a dif
ference."
Students on the board not
only indicated this interest to
make a difference in mental
health but also a commitment
in discussing these issues,
such as the case with Chris
Herries 'l5 on the resources
and communications subcom
mittee.
Student members of the
board framed their participa
tion as an opportunity not
only to make a difference in
mental health but also to sim
ply prompt further discus
sion of the issues at hand.
"I have a personal history
of mental illness and so does
my family and that's sort of
my personal motivation,"
said Herries, a member of
the resources and communi
cations subcommittee. "But

mostly I'm just interested in
the health and happiness of
the people around me."
Herries, who is a Daily
staffer, said the communica
tions subcommittee is cur
rently working on compiling
a single directory of
resources that students can
go to for all mental health
needs.

Rising CAPS usage
As the University devotes
increased attention to issues
surrounding mental health,
the number of students utiliz
ing the CAPS has risen
steadily in recent years, from
11,560 CAPS visits in 2008-
2009 to 14,681 in 2011-12.
Albucher framed the
increased usage of the coun
seling service as partially a
vindication of University
efforts to increase mental
health awareness and reduce
associated stigmas. He also
attributed the increase to
increases in CAPS staffing
and a more proactive mental
ity among CAPS staff.
"It's hard to separate all
of these different compo
nents out but we know that
we're similar to being in the
top tier of schools," Albucher
said.

Even with this progress,
the board is still hard at work
at finding solutions to the
continuing stigma surround
ing mental health issues.
Despite the progress
made, however, Albucher
acknowledged that there is
still work to be done on how
the University approaches
issues of mental health.
"I know there's been
some concern on campus
about how the university com
municates around theses
issues," Albucher said. "The
University tries to walk this
tightrope around health pro
motion, transparency, legal
restriction and student priva
cy and is really struggling
with this in trying to find away
to be more open and transpar
ent and at the same time pro
tecting student rights."
Albucher also acknowl
edged the changing nature of
mental health challenges as
potentially impeding the Uni
versity's search for lasting
solutions.
"It's not a static thing,"
Albucher said. "Mental health
and well-being challenges are
going to change over time."

"The goal of the upcoming meet
ing that we're having is to kind of
being to pull all of that together, look
for areas of overlap, simplify things
and then figure out our next steps,"

Albucher said.
According to Alejandro Mar
tinez, senior associate director for
consultation and liaison at CAPS,
challenges surrounding mental
health are more prominent around
week five of the quarter as academ
ic stress accumulates, prompting
further examination by the board's
subcommittees. Ultimately, howev
er, the board will focus on the entire
ty of campus mental health issues,
according to Dickson.
"We look at some of the experi
ences that Stanford students bring
to campus and we look at what new
stressors are created while being

here," Dickson said. "It's something
we have to be on top of at all times
and this advisory board is an exam
ple of our effort to do that."
The subcommittees' reports will
come at a time when interest in and
awareness about mental health on
campus has become increasingly
widespread, according to University
administrators.
"One of the biggest changes I've
seen in the past year is the amount
of interest and commitment that
students have in the area of mental

health," Martinez said.
Martinez cited a surge in enrol
ment in EDUC 193P: Peer Counsel
ing at the Bridge, a class that he
teaches through the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center and that
instructs students on the basics of
counseling and mental health, as
evidence of that increased interest
among students. Seventy-nine stu
dents are currently enrolled in the
class, compared to 46 last quarter.

The University's new Mental Health and Well-Being Advisory Board
will bring together a range of suggestions regarding addressing
aspects of mental health on campus at a meeting later this month.
"That for me is really sig
nificant," Martinez said. "It
indicates to me an increased
attention to the issue of psy
chological well being, but
most importantly an interest
on the part of students to
want to help and make a dif
ference."
Students on the board not
only indicated this interest to
make a difference in mental
health but also a commitment
in discussing these issues,
such as the case with Chris
Herries 'l5 on the resources
and communications subcom
mittee.
Student members of the
board framed their participa
tion as an opportunity not
only to make a difference in
mental health but also to sim
ply prompt further discus
sion of the issues at hand.
"I have a personal history
of mental illness and so does
my family and that's sort of
my personal motivation,"
said Herries, a member of
the resources and communi
cations subcommittee. "But

mostly I'm just interested in
the health and happiness of
the people around me."
Herries, who is a Daily
staffer, said the communica
tions subcommittee is cur
rently working on compiling
a single directory of
resources that students can
go to for all mental health
needs.

Rising CAPS usage
As the University devotes
increased attention to issues
surrounding mental health,
the number of students utiliz
ing the CAPS has risen
steadily in recent years, from
11,560 CAPS visits in 2008-
2009 to 14,681 in 2011-12.
Albucher framed the
increased usage of the coun
seling service as partially a
vindication of University
efforts to increase mental
health awareness and reduce
associated stigmas. He also
attributed the increase to
increases in CAPS staffing
and a more proactive mental
ity among CAPS staff.
"It's hard to separate all
of these different compo
nents out but we know that
we're similar to being in the
top tier of schools," Albucher
said.

Even with this progress,
the board is still hard at work
at finding solutions to the
continuing stigma surround
ing mental health issues.
Despite the progress
made, however, Albucher
acknowledged that there is
still work to be done on how
the University approaches
issues of mental health.
"I know there's been
some concern on campus
about how the university com
municates around theses
issues," Albucher said. "The
University tries to walk this
tightrope around health pro
motion, transparency, legal
restriction and student priva
cy and is really struggling
with this in trying to find away
to be more open and transpar
ent and at the same time pro
tecting student rights."
Albucher also acknowl
edged the changing nature of
mental health challenges as
potentially impeding the Uni
versity's search for lasting
solutions.
"It's not a static thing,"
Albucher said. "Mental health
and well-being challenges are
going to change over time."

Amid increasing concerns about
mental health awareness on campus
and growing student usage of Stan
ford's Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), subcommittees of
the University's newly established
Mental Health and Well-Being
Advisory Board will present a set of
ideas and findings produced this
academic year to a board meeting
later this month.
The board, co-chaired by CAPS
director Ron Albucher and Associ
ate Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Sally Dickson, was created last
spring in response to the recom
mendations of a 2008 report on cam
pus mental health. The board con
sists of 24 members including
students, faculty and staff —with a
range of backgrounds and experi
ence in mental health, and has met
twice since its formation.
Albucher framed the approach
ing board meeting as a means of
synthesizing the work of the board's
five subcommittees, which have
addressed topics ranging from cur
rent issues and trends in mental
health to student relationships and
how those affect mental well-being.
"The goal of the upcoming meet
ing that we're having is to kind of
being to pull all of that together, look
for areas of overlap, simplify things
and then figure out our next steps,"

Albucher said.
