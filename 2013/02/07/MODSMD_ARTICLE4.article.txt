# CARD INKS NEW CLASS
## 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Clad in a black polo shirt, Stanford football
head coach David Shaw walked into Kissick
Auditorium of the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center, prepared to address the media on
National Signing Day. Two imposing, silver
awards flanked the two-time Pac-12 Coach of
the Year as he took a seat at the conference

table. To his left, the towering Pac-12 Champi
onship trophy loomed. To his right, the smaller
Rose Bowl trophy gleamed.
"Can everybody see okay?" Shaw jokingly
asked. "I know we have a lot of stuff on the
table."
He might've been kidding, but his quip
reflected the seemingly relaxed atmosphere
surrounding the program. On a day of the year
that is generally long-awaited and drama-filled

across the country, tension found no place on
The Farm. After all, the Cardinal had just wel
comed its official 2013 recruiting class, as 12
promising high school recruits from eight dif
ferent states signed their Letters of Intent
with Stanford.
"When you look at our 2013 class, you will
see size. You will see athleticism. You will see
toughness," Shaw said. "We made it a point in
this class to find tight ends and linebackers
who can physically do what we need, and
we're excited about the guys we found."
As expected, with a small graduating sen
ior class and fewer scholarships available to
offer, this year's signees did not top the his
toric 2012 recruiting class that included three
five-star prospects and three of the top eight
offensive line prospects in the nation.
Despite the relatively small number of
signees, the quality of the newest additions to
the Cardinal family shouldn't be overlooked.
Ten of the 12 players were ranked in the
nation's top 25 at their positions by recruiting
services, nine played in an All-America game
and five were named Prep Star All-Ameri
cans.
The 2013 Stanford class was ranked 16th
in the nation based on average player rating
nine signees were rated four stars or high
er and two were tabbed as five stars by at
least one recruiting service. Five of the
signees were also ESPN 300 recruits while
three were members of the Scout 300 and
Rivals 250.
In keeping with an annual trend, the pro
gram once again hauled in big, physically
imposing athletes. Tailor-made for the Cardi
nal's smashmouth running game and aggres
sive, physical style of play on defense, the
newly inked players average 6-foot-4 and 235
pounds.

As expected, the Cardinal's latest recruit
ing plan focused on equipping a Kevin
Hogan-led offense with a more diverse set of
weapons. Seven signees three tight ends,
two offensive linemen, one wide receiver and
one quarterback play on offense.
Stanford snagged a dynamic quarterback
wide receiver duo for the near future with the
signings of quarterback Ryan Burns (Lees
burg, Va./Stone Bridge High School) and
wideout Francis Owusu (Oxnard, Calif./ Oaks
Christian School).
"I chose Stanford because it's the best
school in the country," Burns said. "It has top
notch athletics and academics. The weather is
perfect, and the people are even better."
Listed as the third best pro-style quarter
back by Prep Star, Burns led his team to a 51-
6 record and two high school state champi
onship runner-up finishes. This past season,
the Prep Star All-American tossed for a
school-record 2,530 yards (21.1 yards per
completion) and 28 touchdowns. Showing his
dual-threat capabilities, Burns also rushed
for 222 yards and touchdowns in his senior
year.
Brother of former Stanford wide receiver
Chris Owusu, who was one of Andrew Luck's
favorite targets on the outside, four-star
recruit Francis Owusu stands at 6-foot-3 and
is one of the top 20 wide receivers in the 2013
class, as ranked by both Prep Star and Rivals.
Most notable among prospects who did not
sign with the Cardinal is four-star wide
receiver Jordan Cunningham (Fort Laud
erdale, FL/University School of Nova South),
who turned down Stanford's offer and
instead opted to sign with Vanderbilt.
"This season, Francis Owusu separated
himself from just about any receiver on the
West Coast," Shaw said.
But the signing of three new tight ends
was arguably the Cardinal's most important
grab of the day. Austin Hooper (San Ramon,
Calif./De La Salle HS), Greg Taboada
(Atlanta, Ga./Marist HS) and Eric Cotton
(Nampa, Idaho/Columbia HS) look to fill a
huge void left by the departures of unani
mous All-American tight end Zach Ertz and
four-year veteran Levine Toilolo.
Taboada, captain of the top high school
team in the nation, played on both sides of the
ball, while Hooper and Cotton's athleticism
could potentially allow them to be utilized in
other positions should Shaw choose to exper
iment during training camp. Shaw stated that
he didn't see a tight end in the nation that
was as good of a route runner in and out of
the crouch as Cotton.
"People have asked me the last few years,
'Where do you find those tight ends?"' Shaw
said. "We believe that we have three guys in
this class who can be as productive in the run
ning game and passing game as Coby Fleen
er, Zach Ertz and Levine Toilolo were for us."
After landing highly touted offensive line
men Andrus Peat, Joshua Garnett and Kyle
Murphy last year, the Cardinal has plenty of
depth in the trenches going into the 2013-14
campaign. Nonetheless, Stanford bolstered
its offensive line even further by inking David

Bright (Yorba Linda, Calif./ Mater Dei HS)
and Thomas Oser (Los Angeles, Calif./Har
vard-Westlake School).
Both Bright and Oser drew the attention
of the Cardinal coaching staff during Stan
ford's summer football camp, and their versa
tility will only add to the development of one
of the nation's top units up front. Bright, a
Prep Star All-American, has played both
tackle and guard, while Oser is the 11th cen
ter in the nation and can also switch to guard.
"Offensively, we believe that we've added
exciting firepower," Shaw said. "Up front, we
have added two physical, aggressive and ver
satile offensive linemen who fit our style and
temperament of play."

With nine of the 11 starting defenders on
the Rose Bowl team returning, the Cardinal
managed to haul in four new linebackers and
a signee who plays both cornerback and
wide receiver.
A consensus national top-10 linebacker,
Peter Kalambayi (Matthews, N.C./Butler
HS) was a USA Today first-team All-Ameri
ca selection and a finalist for the Butkus
Award, which is given annually to the top
linebacker at the high school, collegiate and
professional levels.
Joining him will be Mike Tyler
(Brecksville, Ohio/Brecksville-Broadview
Heights HS), an outside linebacker who
racked up 18 sacks this past season. The Car
dinal already boasts a deep linebacker corps,
but the additions of Kalambayi and Tyler
should help out a squad that will be without
star outside linebacker Chase Thomas next
year.
"Defensively, with the depth of young tal
ent in the defensive backfield and the return
ing strength of our defensive line, we've
added four linebackers in this class who can
run and hit and play the aggressive style of
defense for which Stanford has come to be
known," Shaw commented. "Each of these
linebackers has unique abilities in pass rush
and in coverage, and they will add to the
strength and depth of our front seven."
Four-star recruits Kevin Palma (Pixley,
Calif./ Mission Oak HS) and Sean Barton
(North Salt Lake, Utah/Woods Corss HS)
round out the inside linebacker group. Palma,
listed as the 10th best middle linebacker in
the country, tallied 19 tackles for loss in his
senior campaign and broke a school-record
by recording eight of them in a single game.
Amassing 200 tackles and 36 tackles for loss
over the course of his high school career, Bar
ton will enroll at Stanford in 2015 after his
LDS church mission in Africa.
"[Coach Shaw] cares about the players,"
Barton said. "He always has your best inten
tions at heart, and he commands the team
without having to scream constantly."
Taijuan Thomas (Monroe, La./Ouachita
Parish HS) was an explosive playmaker at
both the wide receiver and cornerback posi
tions in high school. Having a body build sim
ilar to Drew Terrell's, Thomas possesses the
triple-threat label as a possible kickoff and
punt returner.
"Taijuan Thomas is one of those explosive
athletes who could help us on offense,
defense and special teams," Shaw said. "We
can't wait for his playmaking ability to impact
our team."

On New Year's Day, an endless rain of car
dinal and white confetti fell onto the field at
the Rose Bowl Stadium as 40,000 Cardinal
fans applauded Stanford's first Rose Bowl
win in over four decades. Players celebrated,
Shaw gave a speech and MVPs were named.
Half an hour later, the postgame confer
ence was held in a much more subdued set
ting. Shaw talked about his players' resolve
that led them to the Rose Bowl victory and
then spoke his last words of the historic 2012-
2013 season.
"We have a lot of guys coming back on
both sides of the ball, all three phases, and
we'll hold ourselves to a higher standard," he
said. "But our standard is not just talking
about winning games. Our standard is how
we work, how we come together, how we
practice and the attitude that we build before
we ever play a football game. And that starts
in a few weeks."
A few weeks have passed since then and
with 12 new players added to its roster, Stan
ford's pursuit of a national title has begun in
earnest.

AVI BAGLA/The Stanford Daily
Football head coach David Shaw was able to praise his 2013 recruiting class for the first
time on Wednesday after 12 players officially signed with the Cardinal. The class is one
of the smallest in the nation but consists of athletes that fit Stanford's physical system well.
