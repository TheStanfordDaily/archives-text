## Overseas Seminar apps fall BOSP summer program adds seminars in second year back 
### JOSEE SMITH 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram's (BOSP) Overseas Seminars
component received fewer applications
this year than last year despite offering
three more programs.
According to BOSP Director
Ramon Saldivar, 344 students applied
to the eight programs in Vienna, Rio de
Janeiro, India, Israel, Madagascar,
Palau and Cardiff, Wales. Around 15
students were accepted to each of the
eight programs, for a total of approxi
mately 120 students.
Last year, by contrast, there were
five overseas seminars, with a total of
460 applicants.
Saldivar downplayed the signifi
cance of the decline, emphasizing the
limited value of only two years of data.
"Fluctuations always happen," Sal
divar said. "If that trend continues for
the next four or five years, then we'll
start thinking about what it means. But
the most important thing about the
seminars is that we are only offering a
very small number and we continue to
be hugely oversubscribed. The total
number of applications greatly exceeds
the number of spots we have avail
able."
Saldivar refused to give a break
down of application numbers for each
specific seminar.
The waitlist for each seminar also
includes 15 students, so that BOSP can
make sure that they fill each of the pro
grams to capacity.
"We have no specific goal about the
number of students we want to apply,"
Saldivar said. "We want to make sure
that we meet student interest. It also
provides information for me to give to
my superiors when making budget
requests and whatnot that the demand
of these programs exceeds what we can
offer. It can strengthen my case for
wanting to offer more of these semi
nars."
Saldivar expressed optimism about
the support the seminars have received
from students and faculty.
"Every indication from student
evaluations, faculty responses, any
review body like the SUES (Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stanford)
[report] continues to point to the
overseas seminars as being really suc
cessful," Saldivar said. "That is a given.
The next question is, how many more
can we do? At this point, it is based on
funding, in a broad sense. It is also
based on how many we can afford to do
given the size of this office, given facul
ty interest."
Biology professor Susan
McConnell, who will teach a summer
seminar in Costa Rica on conservation
photography, said she was happy about
the increase in the number of seminars
offered this year and was pleased with
the number of applicants she received.
Even while the summer seminars
continue to enjoy generally strong
