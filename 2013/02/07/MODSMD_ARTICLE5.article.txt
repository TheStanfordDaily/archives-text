## Overseas Seminar apps fall BOSP summer program adds seminars in second year back 
### JOSEE SMITH 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram's (BOSP) Overseas Seminars
component received fewer applications
this year than last year despite offering
three more programs.
According to BOSP Director
Ramon Saldivar, 344 students applied
to the eight programs in Vienna, Rio de
Janeiro, India, Israel, Madagascar,
Palau and Cardiff, Wales. Around 15
students were accepted to each of the
eight programs, for a total of approxi
mately 120 students.
Last year, by contrast, there were
five overseas seminars, with a total of
460 applicants.
Saldivar downplayed the signifi
cance of the decline, emphasizing the
limited value of only two years of data.
"Fluctuations always happen," Sal
divar said. "If that trend continues for
the next four or five years, then we'll
start thinking about what it means. But
the most important thing about the
seminars is that we are only offering a
very small number and we continue to
be hugely oversubscribed. The total
number of applications greatly exceeds
the number of spots we have avail
able."
Saldivar refused to give a break
down of application numbers for each
specific seminar.
The waitlist for each seminar also
includes 15 students, so that BOSP can
make sure that they fill each of the pro
grams to capacity.
"We have no specific goal about the
number of students we want to apply,"
Saldivar said. "We want to make sure
that we meet student interest. It also
provides information for me to give to
my superiors when making budget
requests and whatnot that the demand
of these programs exceeds what we can
offer. It can strengthen my case for
wanting to offer more of these semi
nars."
Saldivar expressed optimism about
the support the seminars have received
from students and faculty.
"Every indication from student
evaluations, faculty responses, any
review body like the SUES (Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stanford)
[report] continues to point to the
overseas seminars as being really suc
cessful," Saldivar said. "That is a given.
The next question is, how many more
can we do? At this point, it is based on
funding, in a broad sense. It is also
based on how many we can afford to do
given the size of this office, given facul
ty interest."
Biology professor Susan
McConnell, who will teach a summer
seminar in Costa Rica on conservation
photography, said she was happy about
the increase in the number of seminars
offered this year and was pleased with
the number of applicants she received.
Even while the summer seminars
continue to enjoy generally strong
interest, other BOSP pro
grams have struggled to
attract applicants. Five
BOSP spring quarter pro
grams Beijing, Florence,
Kyoto, Madrid and Santiago
are still accepting applica
tions, with interested stu
dents being asked to contact
the program as soon as possi
ble.
Saldivar said that the low
interest level of interest in
those programs is not that
unusual and that BOSP reg
ularly accepts students after
the application deadline.
On Monday, BOSP also
announced the return of the
Community Health in Oaxa
ca Program for Spring/Sum
mer 2013. According to the
BOSP website, this service

learning program will pro
vide students with the
opportunity of working in
southern Mexico, shadowing
health care providers in clin
ics and hospitals and work
ing with other agencies to
meet community-identified
needs.
"It gives us an opportuni
ty to try out a different peda
gogical method and a differ
ent duration, linking it with a
course on campus and follow
ing up with an overseas expe
rience," Saldivar said. "We
are targeting groups of stu
dents on campus who would
n't be thinking that they
would be able to go abroad
and spend time in an over
seas experience."
Saldivar added that,
although the topic is commu
nity health in southern Mex
ico, the subject is being inter
preted broadly.
"It's not just medical
issues, but broad social and

community issues that con
stitute well-being. We are
looking for students interest
ed in health care and medical
science, but also in all
aspects of social sciences and
humanities," Saldivar said.
"There is room for thinking
about culture, language and
the arts as part of the con
struction of a community in
good health. We hope to look
at it that way over the next
two years."
Students can apply to the
program on the BOSP web
site by Feb. 17.
"As long as we continue
having students interested in
the programs, we will work
hard to make the space for
students to be a part of
them," Saldivar said. "The
summer seminars are a sign
post of the way we should be
moving in the future."

"Every indication from student
evaluations, faculty responses, any
review body like the SUES (Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stanford)
[report] continues to point to the
overseas seminars as being really suc
cessful," Saldivar said. "That is a given.
The next question is, how many more
can we do? At this point, it is based on
funding, in a broad sense. It is also
based on how many we can afford to do
given the size of this office, given facul
ty interest."
Biology professor Susan
McConnell, who will teach a summer
seminar in Costa Rica on conservation
photography, said she was happy about
the increase in the number of seminars
offered this year and was pleased with
the number of applicants she received.
Even while the summer seminars
continue to enjoy generally strong
interest, other BOSP pro
grams have struggled to
attract applicants. Five
BOSP spring quarter pro
grams Beijing, Florence,
Kyoto, Madrid and Santiago
are still accepting applica
tions, with interested stu
dents being asked to contact
the program as soon as possi
ble.
Saldivar said that the low
interest level of interest in
those programs is not that
unusual and that BOSP reg
ularly accepts students after
the application deadline.
On Monday, BOSP also
announced the return of the
Community Health in Oaxa
ca Program for Spring/Sum
mer 2013. According to the
BOSP website, this service

learning program will pro
vide students with the
opportunity of working in
southern Mexico, shadowing
health care providers in clin
ics and hospitals and work
ing with other agencies to
meet community-identified
needs.
"It gives us an opportuni
ty to try out a different peda
gogical method and a differ
ent duration, linking it with a
course on campus and follow
ing up with an overseas expe
rience," Saldivar said. "We
are targeting groups of stu
dents on campus who would
n't be thinking that they
would be able to go abroad
and spend time in an over
seas experience."
Saldivar added that,
although the topic is commu
nity health in southern Mex
ico, the subject is being inter
preted broadly.
"It's not just medical
issues, but broad social and

community issues that con
stitute well-being. We are
looking for students interest
ed in health care and medical
science, but also in all
aspects of social sciences and
humanities," Saldivar said.
"There is room for thinking
about culture, language and
the arts as part of the con
struction of a community in
good health. We hope to look
at it that way over the next
two years."
Students can apply to the
program on the BOSP web
site by Feb. 17.
"As long as we continue
having students interested in
the programs, we will work
hard to make the space for
students to be a part of
them," Saldivar said. "The
summer seminars are a sign
post of the way we should be
moving in the future."
