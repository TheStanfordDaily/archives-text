KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio sta

home to a mix of students, faculty, alumni and

community members almost as eclectic as the
music it broadcasts over the airwaves.
Although many station members come and go
over the quarters, a select few stick around for
years, or even decades. One of them is Mark
Lawrence '67, chief engineer of KZSU for 40
years and counting.

Mark Lawrence, KZSU chief engineer, has worked at the station since 1963. He cited his
love for the technical side of broadcasting as one of the reasons behind his long career.
decoration soon this is Lawrence's 50th
year with the station. During his college
years, Lawrence served as a member of
KZSU's engineering department and he has
worked as an engineer at the station ever
since he graduated in 1967 with a major in
electrical engineering.
In his time at KZSU, Lawrence witnessed
many of the transitions that the station has
gone through over the years, from the annual
change in leadership, to the bureaucratic
hoops the station had to jump through to get
their FM broadcasting license in 1964.
Lawrence was even involved in the process of
setting up the station's FM transmitter at the
Dish.
Despite his many years of service,
Lawrence's passion and curiosity for the
technology at the station is as steadfast as
ever.
"You would think that as the station's
longest [tenured] staffer, [Lawrence] would
not be as enthusiastic about radio equipment
as he is," said Sophia Vo 'l4, KZSU's general
manager. "That's not the case. Every time I
run into him, he's tinkering with new technol
ogy, dusting off our vinyl record players or
checking the emergency alert system."
Known around the station for always
being tapped into his smart phone, Lawrence
talked enthusiastically about his fascination
with technology, including GPS and computer
chips.
"I've always been interested in building
things," Lawrence said. 'According to my
mom, I helped her rewire a pair of desk lamps
when I was five."
His love for technical things eventually led
him to obtaining his first radio license as a
sixth-grader and building a significant
amount of radio equipment on his own in high
school.

"So when I came to Stanford, electrical
engineering was the obvious major," he said.
Lawrence valued the hands-on experience
of his undergraduate education as an electri
cal engineering major.
"I liked the practical side of EE a lot, more
than the theoretical side of it," he said. "I
straggled with some of the theory classes, but
I aced the labs."
While some of his classmates had never
gotten their hands on a soldering iron before,
Lawrence was already adept at registering
practical details and working with technical
equipment. He joined KZSU as a freshman
volunteer, deciding that although he was
involved in other student clubs, including the
Amateur Radio Club he preferred actively
building things to discussing them.
"My job at KZSU was perfect for that," he
said. "I could spend all of my time building
radio equipment."
Among his other duties at KZSU, Mark
helps repair equipment ranging from signal
generators to distortion analyzers, replaces
delicate needles on turntables and builds
most of the equipment in the station's three
studios.
His duties, however, extend far beyond
engineering. When, in the middle of his inter
view, a DJ manning Studio A shouted across
the station: "Mark, there's a burning smell,"
Lawrence paused the session and rushed to
where he was needed.
"To do this job, electronic knowledge is
less important than general handyman
skills," he said after the crisis was averted. "I
install new stuff and fix old stuff."
Still, working with students is Lawrence's
favorite aspect of the job. He has worked
alongside students that have gone onto
impressive careers in the broadcast industry,
including former news director Pete Williams

'74, an NBC News correspondent, and David
Flemming '9B '9B, an announcer for the San
Francisco Giants.
According to Lawrence, however, the age
difference between him and the largely stu
dent staff can sometimes be challenging, par
ticularly when leadership of the station
changes every year.
"The general manager, who is a student, is
selected by the advisory board and serves for
a year," he said. "Technically, I call this person
my 'boss', although they are an undergrad
about 20 years old, and I've been working
here for 50 years."
Adam Pearson 'l2, last year's general
manager, echoed this sentiment.
"When someone who's the age of your
grandparent is reporting to you, it is a chal
lenging dynamic and conflict," he said.
Both agreed, however, that a good work
ing relationship was not hard to establish due
to a mutual passion for college radio.
"Mark is engrained in the station culture,
as he's been there for so long," Pearson said.
Moreover, not many students who work at
KZSU are interested in the technical side of
the radio.
"Do you call the electrical company to
thank them that the lights are on?" Lawrence
said. "You only think about your electrical
company when something is not working."
Nevertheless, Lawrence is thankful for
the support and appreciation he has received
from Pearson, Vo and many of the other staff
members, whom he considers dear friends.
Most importantly, however, Lawrence is most
grateful for the opportunity to tinker with
technology.
"I don't do this job for love," he said. "I do
it because I like to build things."

There is a small door on the west
side of Memorial Auditorium that
leads down to a basement full of
amplifiers, transmitters and
shelves full of records, tapes and

of a red heart, whose caption reads "KZSU
Stanford, 90.1 FM."
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio sta
tion, has served the Farm since 1947 and is
home to a mix of students, faculty, alumni and

community members almost as eclectic as the
music it broadcasts over the airwaves.
Although many station members come and go
over the quarters, a select few stick around for
years, or even decades. One of them is Mark
Lawrence '67, chief engineer of KZSU for 40
years and counting.
In the engineering lair at the back of the
station, Lawrence sits at his desk among myr
iad colorful wires, soldering tools and brightly
lit screens. On his wall there are pictures of his
family, Coca Cola ads, a card with a Robert
Frost poem and a certificate of appreciation
that the KZSU team gave him to commemo
rate his 40th year of service.
However, Lawrence might get a new wall

Mark Lawrence, KZSU chief engineer, has worked at the station since 1963. He cited his
love for the technical side of broadcasting as one of the reasons behind his long career.
decoration soon this is Lawrence's 50th
year with the station. During his college
years, Lawrence served as a member of
KZSU's engineering department and he has
worked as an engineer at the station ever
since he graduated in 1967 with a major in
electrical engineering.
In his time at KZSU, Lawrence witnessed
many of the transitions that the station has
gone through over the years, from the annual
change in leadership, to the bureaucratic
hoops the station had to jump through to get
their FM broadcasting license in 1964.
Lawrence was even involved in the process of
setting up the station's FM transmitter at the
Dish.
Despite his many years of service,
Lawrence's passion and curiosity for the
technology at the station is as steadfast as
ever.
"You would think that as the station's
longest [tenured] staffer, [Lawrence] would
not be as enthusiastic about radio equipment
as he is," said Sophia Vo 'l4, KZSU's general
manager. "That's not the case. Every time I
run into him, he's tinkering with new technol
ogy, dusting off our vinyl record players or
checking the emergency alert system."
Known around the station for always
being tapped into his smart phone, Lawrence
talked enthusiastically about his fascination
with technology, including GPS and computer
chips.
"I've always been interested in building
things," Lawrence said. 'According to my
mom, I helped her rewire a pair of desk lamps
when I was five."
His love for technical things eventually led
him to obtaining his first radio license as a
sixth-grader and building a significant
amount of radio equipment on his own in high
school.

"So when I came to Stanford, electrical
engineering was the obvious major," he said.
Lawrence valued the hands-on experience
of his undergraduate education as an electri
cal engineering major.
"I liked the practical side of EE a lot, more
than the theoretical side of it," he said. "I
straggled with some of the theory classes, but
I aced the labs."
While some of his classmates had never
gotten their hands on a soldering iron before,
Lawrence was already adept at registering
practical details and working with technical
equipment. He joined KZSU as a freshman
volunteer, deciding that although he was
involved in other student clubs, including the
Amateur Radio Club he preferred actively
building things to discussing them.
"My job at KZSU was perfect for that," he
said. "I could spend all of my time building
radio equipment."
Among his other duties at KZSU, Mark
helps repair equipment ranging from signal
generators to distortion analyzers, replaces
delicate needles on turntables and builds
most of the equipment in the station's three
studios.
His duties, however, extend far beyond
engineering. When, in the middle of his inter
view, a DJ manning Studio A shouted across
the station: "Mark, there's a burning smell,"
Lawrence paused the session and rushed to
where he was needed.
"To do this job, electronic knowledge is
less important than general handyman
skills," he said after the crisis was averted. "I
install new stuff and fix old stuff."
Still, working with students is Lawrence's
favorite aspect of the job. He has worked
alongside students that have gone onto
impressive careers in the broadcast industry,
including former news director Pete Williams

'74, an NBC News correspondent, and David
Flemming '9B '9B, an announcer for the San
Francisco Giants.
According to Lawrence, however, the age
difference between him and the largely stu
dent staff can sometimes be challenging, par
ticularly when leadership of the station
changes every year.
"The general manager, who is a student, is
selected by the advisory board and serves for
a year," he said. "Technically, I call this person
my 'boss', although they are an undergrad
about 20 years old, and I've been working
here for 50 years."
Adam Pearson 'l2, last year's general
manager, echoed this sentiment.
"When someone who's the age of your
grandparent is reporting to you, it is a chal
lenging dynamic and conflict," he said.
Both agreed, however, that a good work
ing relationship was not hard to establish due
to a mutual passion for college radio.
"Mark is engrained in the station culture,
as he's been there for so long," Pearson said.
Moreover, not many students who work at
KZSU are interested in the technical side of
the radio.
"Do you call the electrical company to
thank them that the lights are on?" Lawrence
said. "You only think about your electrical
company when something is not working."
Nevertheless, Lawrence is thankful for
the support and appreciation he has received
from Pearson, Vo and many of the other staff
members, whom he considers dear friends.
Most importantly, however, Lawrence is most
grateful for the opportunity to tinker with
technology.
"I don't do this job for love," he said. "I do
it because I like to build things."
