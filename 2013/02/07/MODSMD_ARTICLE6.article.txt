## 50 YEARS ON THE AIR KZSU engineer reflects on half a century of student-run radio 
### LAN ANH LE 
There is a small door on the west
side of Memorial Auditorium that
leads down to a basement full of
amplifiers, transmitters and
shelves full of records, tapes and
CDs. On top of the doorway resides a drawing
of a red heart, whose caption reads "KZSU
Stanford, 90.1 FM."
KZSU, Stanford's student-run radio sta
tion, has served the Farm since 1947 and is
home to a mix of students, faculty, alumni and

community members almost as eclectic as the
music it broadcasts over the airwaves.
Although many station members come and go
over the quarters, a select few stick around for
years, or even decades. One of them is Mark
Lawrence '67, chief engineer of KZSU for 40
years and counting.
In the engineering lair at the back of the
station, Lawrence sits at his desk among myr
iad colorful wires, soldering tools and brightly
lit screens. On his wall there are pictures of his
family, Coca Cola ads, a card with a Robert
Frost poem and a certificate of appreciation
that the KZSU team gave him to commemo
rate his 40th year of service.
However, Lawrence might get a new wall

Mark Lawrence, KZSU chief engineer, has worked at the station since 1963. He cited his
love for the technical side of broadcasting as one of the reasons behind his long career.
