## 2 profs win National Medal of Science 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR 
When the call from the White
House came in late December, Lucy
Shapiro wasn't quite sure how to
react.
"When someone gets on the
phone and tells you that the Presi
dent of the United States is awarding
you the highest honor that they give
in science and technology, and that is
also for outstanding service to your
nation, it's quite a thrill," Shapiro,
professor of developmental biology
at the School of Medicine, said.
Less than two months later,
Shapiro flew to Washington, D.C. for
an awards ceremony honoring her as
one of 12 National Medal of Science
recipients. The annual award recog
nizes outstanding work by scientists,
inventors and engineers, and was
also awarded to Sidney Drell, profes
sor emeritus at the SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory
"It was simply awesome,"
Shapiro said of receiving her medal
from President Barack Obama on
Feb. 1.
Drell agreed, who said that learn
ing he would receive the award was
like a "Christmas surprise."
"I am a great admirer of Presi
dent Obama," he said. "To get in a
chance for a few words was a great

thrill."
Though the award recognizes
researchers for their overall contri
butions to their scientific field, the
specific contributions of each scien
tist are listed on their award cita
tions. Drell's recognized his "applica
tion of science to inform national poli
cies in security and intelligence" as
well as his work as an advisor to the
government.
Drell's work focuses on reducing
the risk of nuclear weapons deploy
ment, with his principal accomplish
ment being a set of steps devel
oped in conjunction with Hoover fel
low and former Secretary of State
George Schultz to minimize the
threat of nuclear weapons interna
tionally, including giving more power
to nonproliferation treaties and cre
ating a more transparent and coop
erative means of nuclear weapon
verification.
"We can count the number of
warheads the Russians have on their
long range systems, and they can
count the number on ours, so you
can verify compliance," Drell said.
"That's a technical challenge and a
political cooperation challenge."
While Drell recognized the diffi
culties of eliminating nuclear
weapons on a global scale, he
expressed confidence that, with the

correct measures, it may eventually
become feasible.
"The vision of zero [nuclear
weapons] is a powerful one, but one
has to develop the technological and
political cooperation so the countries
of the world will agree that it's a
goal," Drell said.
Shapiro was given the award for
her work with the genetic circuitry
of bacterial cells, which her citation
describes as a "pioneering discov
ery." Shapiro collaborated with
Harley McAdams, a professor of
developmental biology at the School
of Medicine.
Shapiro and McAdams' research
led to the discovery that bacterial
cells work on a three-dimensional
grid, which enables cells to track
specific regulatory proteins to dis
tinct cell poles during cell division.
As specific regulatory proteins go to
different cell poles, cell differentia
tion is initiated.
Shapiro's other research inter
ests include studying globally
emerging infectious disease, and she
has become a spokesperson for poli
cy makers on a local and national
level. Shapiro is also the founder of
Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which uses
boron chemistry in the development
of new antibiotics and antifungal
drugs.

"It's a very exciting time in biolo
gy, because biology now is the
physics, chemistry and engineering
of the living world," she said. "It's a
time of just incredible revolutions in
our understanding of how the living
world works. And of course, this has
tremendous implications for control
ling disease and understanding
pathogens."
At the ceremony, Obama praised
the award recipients for their contri
butions to scientific fields.
"I am proud to honor these
inspiring American innovators," he
said in prepared remarks. "They
represent the ingenuity and imagi

nation that has long made this nation
great, and they remind us of the
enormous impact a few good ideas
can have when these creative quali
ties are unleashed in an entrepre
neurial environment."
Other recipients were recognized
for contributions in electrochem
istry, marine science, extragalactic
astronomy, supersymmetry mathe
matics, digital communications, lithi
um ion battery research, borane
chemistry and interdisciplinary
efforts.
