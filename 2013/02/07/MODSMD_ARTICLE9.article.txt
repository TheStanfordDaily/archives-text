## GSC quickly approves ARP 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted
unanimously to approve the Alternative Review
Process (ARP), Stanford's revised judicial pro
cedure for sexual assault and harassment cases,
at its Feb. 6 meeting.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate approved
the revised ARP on Thesday night, and fol
lowing the GSC's ratification of the policy—the
Faculty Senate is expected to vote on the ARP
at its March meeting. While a version of the
ARP has been in place for over a year following
an emergency decision by President John Hen

nessy, ratification by the Faculty Senate and
Hennessy would make the ARP official Stan
ford policy.
GSC Co-Chair Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3
introduced the final version of the ARP to the
GSC and offered to answer questions from
GSC members about the document before
voting. However, all 13 voting members pres
ent at the meeting passed the ARP with little
discussion.
Shaw expressed satisfaction that both the
GSC and the Senate had unanimously approved
the ARE
"We really crossed all the t's and
dotted all the i's this time, and got
everyone on board," Shaw said. "It's a
testonent to that that we got unani
mous votes from both the associations."
Shaw cited the GSC's collabora
tion with the Senate and the Board of

Judicial Affairs (BJA) to address
issues with the original version of the
ARP as other positive aspects of the
process.
"We're glad that it was a conscien
tious, successful process," Shaw said.
"Over the whole year, people put in
tremendous time and effort in the
ASSU, GSC and BJA. Everyone has
done their best to make this a success
ful operation."
According to Shaw the Fhculty Sen
ate should approve the ARP with little

controversy
"We've been in communication with
the Senate, and we know they'll have
it on the agenda this spring," Shaw
said. "We're pretty sure we're all on
the same page, and we know we've
addressed many of the concerns that
Stanford community members had. I
fully expect the Faculty Senate to
pass it."
