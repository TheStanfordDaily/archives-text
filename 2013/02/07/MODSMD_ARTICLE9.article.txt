### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted
unanimously to approve the Alternative Review
Process (ARP), Stanford's revised judicial pro
cedure for sexual assault and harassment cases,
at its Feb. 6 meeting.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate approved
the revised ARP on Thesday night, and fol
lowing the GSC's ratification of the policyâ€”the
Faculty Senate is expected to vote on the ARP
at its March meeting. While a version of the
ARP has been in place for over a year following
an emergency decision by President John Hen

nessy, ratification by the Faculty Senate and
Hennessy would make the ARP official Stan
ford policy.
GSC Co-Chair Michael Shaw Ph.D. 'l3
introduced the final version of the ARP to the
GSC and offered to answer questions from
GSC members about the document before
voting. However, all 13 voting members pres
ent at the meeting passed the ARP with little
discussion.
Shaw expressed satisfaction that both the
GSC and the Senate had unanimously approved
the ARE
