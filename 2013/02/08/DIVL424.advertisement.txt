Stanford Historical Society and Stanford Continuing Studies present
Stanford Women in Space
The term astronaut derives from the Greek words meaning "space sailor," and
refers to all who have been launched as crew members aboard NASA spacecraft
bound for orbit and beyond. In the fifty-year history of the NASA space program,
only 45 of the 525 astronauts have been women. Seven of these women have
degrees from Stanford—a truly impressive record from a single school.
The first US woman in space, the late Sally Ride, received all of her degrees at
Stanford, from BS to PhD. Eileen Collins, the first woman to serve as a Shuttle
commander, is a Stanford graduate as well. The first African American woman
in space, [Viae Jemison, and the first Hispanic woman, Ellen Ochoa, are both from
Stanford. Barbara Morgan, also a Stanford alumna, trained with the Challenger space
shuttle crew as backup to Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe, and later became
an astronaut, serving on the space shuttle Endeavor on a mission to the International
Space Station.
Please join us for a truly extraordinary evening with Eileen Collins, Ellen Ochoa,
and Barbara Morgan as they discuss their experiences in space with Scott Hubbard,
former director of NASA's Ames Research Center and consulting professor of
aeronautics and astronautics of Stanford.
