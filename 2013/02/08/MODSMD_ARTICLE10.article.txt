## Athletics Director Muir talks to Faculty Senate 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports
on the University's athletics program
and the review process for under
graduate majors at its Thursday
meeting.
Director of Athletics Bernard
Muir opened the session's agenda by
reviewing the first quarter of his
tenure at the Department of Athlet
ics, jesting that the process of inte
grating himself fully into the role was
still ongoing.
"I feel like some of our freshman
athletes," Muir said. "I'm not quite
sure where to turn."
After recounting his own experi
ence in collegiate athletics, including
stints at Norte Dame, Butler, Auburn
and the University of Delaware, Muir
toned his attention to the current
state of the athletics program and
acknowledged the pressure on Stan
ford athletes and coaches to maintain
consistent success.
'At Stanford, the expectations
are high," Muir said. "Part of the
job, as an athletics director, is to
manage those expectations."
Muir framed the direction of the
athletics program as overwhelm
ingly positive, citing the ongoing
streak of 18 straight Directors'
Cups awarded to the top all
around collegiate athletics program
as an enduring facet of Stanford
athletics.
"Coming out of the fall standings,
we are ranked No. 1... I'm thrilled we
have the opportunity to go after [No.]
19," Muir said.
An increasing number of acco
lades will also be matched by an
increased number of sports next
quarter, according to Muir, as sand
volleyball becomes the University's
36th varsity sport.
Muir also emphasized the aca
demic accomplishments of student
athletes, noting that Stanford's ath
lete graduation rate has historically
tracked closely to that of the Stanford
student body and remained far above
that of rival institutions. He acknowl
edged, however, that student-athletes
occasionally struggle to integrate
themselves fully into certain aspects
of academic life such as introductory
seminars.
"We would love for our student

athletes to get more involved," Muir
said. "We are trying to promote that
as best we can, but it does continue to
be a challenge."
Muir identified a range of con
cerns facing the athletics program in
the future such as the high growth
rate of the program's costs and the
impact of media contracts on event
scheduling. He also noted the chal
lenge of recruiting athletes given
Stanford's academic requirements
and recruits' tendencies to commit to
schools at earlier ages.
Faculty questions focused on the
role played by the athletics program
within the University as a whole and
the significance of Stanford's athletic
success for the University's national
profile.
Tom Wasow, professor of linguis
tics, expressed concern about the
broader professionalization of college
sports, citing the rapid growth of ath
letics programs' budgets and calling
for increased transparency in athletic
expenses.
"[Professionalization] has led to
an arms race in facilities and coaches'
salaries," Wasow said.
"We think there should be greater
transparency," Muir agreed. "This is
something that other institutions are
facing... that there should be a dia
logue on where we're investing."
Rob Reich M.A. '9B Ph.D. '9B
emphasized the potential for the Uni
versity to leverage the success of
Stanford student-athletes into a
national platform for advocating sim
ilar accomplishments.
"We have a hell of a story," Reich
said.
Following the discussion period,
Wasow —who chairs the Committee
on Committees put forward minor
changes to the responsibilities of the
Committee on Review of Undergrad
uate Majors, including increased
reliance on individual departments
and schools to internally review
majors offered.
The Senate adopted the revised
charter by voice vote after little dis
cussion.
The Senate will hear a report on
the future of federal research sup
port at Stanford at its next meeting
on Feb. 21.
