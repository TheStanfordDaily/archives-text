## CREST pushes social, environmental change Center builds framework for more eco-friendly tourism 
### KATIE KRAMON 
The Stanford-based Center for
Responsible Travel (CREST) will
hold its second Executive Sympo
sium for Innovators in Coastal
Tourism in Los Cabos, Mexico, in
May.
CREST, which has offices both
at Stanford and in Washington,
D.C., researches methods by which
tourism —one of the world's most
profitable industries—can be used
as a tool for preventing poverty
and environmental degradation
around the world. Stanford under
graduates, graduates and postdoc
toral students research a variety of
destinations around the world,
from the Galapagos to Peru.
The Executive Symposium will
be modeled on the executive semi
nars held at the Stanford School of
Business to promote collaboration
between experts in the field from
all over the world about new ways
of looking at tourism and ideas for
promoting social and environmen
tal change.
CREST was founded in 2003 by
Bill Durham '7l, a professor of
anthropology, and Martha Honey,
director of the Peace and Security
Program at the Institute for Policy
Studies, who now manages the
Washington, D.C. office. Durham,
who had done a lot of research
abroad in his field, became fully
aware of the impacts of tourism
after traveling in the Galapagos.
"I saw that tourism was under
mining the very isolation that
made Galapagos special," Durham
said.
According to Durham, the Gala
pagos have become an incredibly
popular vacation destination, but
many tourists often come accompa
nied by non-indigenous species and
environmental degradation.
"The islands that convinced
Darwin of a long history to life
were falling apart before my eyes,"
he said.
This concern with the deterio
rating environment of the Galapa
gos in turn became part of
Durham's motivation for founding
CREST.
"The study of tourism in places
like the Galapagos and the Amazon

Rainforest might be away to
return some of the benefits of a
career working in these areas," he
said.
The other piece fell into place in
2002 when one of Durham's post
doctoral students suggested hold
ing a conference at Stanford to dis
cuss ecotourism and mass tourism,
which attracted a lot of interest.
After the session's success,
many in the ecotourism communi
ty, including Honey, were excited
about continuing such research
and discussions. Honey even sug
gested the creation of a bi-coastal
research institute with Stanford
and Washington offices, enabling
them to interact with policy and
lawmakers, as well as the interna
tional community at large.
Durham and Honey began
CREST by approaching founda
tions, starting with the Ford Foun
dation, which Durham said was
immediately interested in the pro
posal because it is a "socially
responsible arm for environmental
intervention and had history of
building standards in commerce
and trade." Ford gave CREST an
official grant 10 years ago, allowing
the program to take off.
Since it was founded, CREST
has worked to create a new frame
work for tourism, supporting val
ues and philosophies that put the
environment and indigenous peo
ple first and the "vacation" second.
The upcoming conference aims to
further this mission, according to
CREST.
Claire Menke 'lO M.S. 'lO, a
researcher in the Department of
Anthropology at Stanford and a
member of CREST, believes that
the conference is pivotal in pro
pelling the organization's impact to
a wider audience.
"The conference will further the
goal of creating most sustainable
tourist operation possible," she
said.
In the coming years, CREST
hopes to secure a standard for
green tourism by ensuring that
revenue from tourism goes back to
a local community, in addition to
promoting ecotourism on campus
and elsewhere.
"I have nothing against sun and
sand, but I want to build in people
and habitats," Durham said.
