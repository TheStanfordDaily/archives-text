## Winning games with math 
### Sam Fisher 
As I watched the Ravens
survive a dramatic 49ers
comeback attempt in
Super Bowl XLVII, all I
could think about was
Chip Kelly
As a lifelong Philadelphia Eagles
fan and a believer in basic statis
tics for almost nearly as long—l
can't help but get excited about the
edge my Eagles will gain from Chip
Kelly's decision making.
I was so busy with Stanford foot
ball this fall that I found myself lack
ing the motivation to procrastinate
my homework another four hours to
watch the pathetic Eagles or any
other NFL teams for that matter
veiy often.
Maybe that's why I was so
stunned to see how poor NFL coach
es' decision making was on fourth
down in the playoffs. I had gotten
used to the college game, where
inconsistent kicking games have
helped lead coaches to better decision
making. Chip Kelly has been at the
forefront of college head coaches in
this category.
I had always heard that coaches
were too conservative, but I never
fully understood the argument until I
took Mathematics of Sports (STATS
50) last fall. Out of all that we learned,
the one thing that has stuck closest to
me is how to calculate the value of
field position in the NFL.
I'll keep the math as simple as I
can make it. Let's call Y(x) the value
in points of a first down and 10 at the
x yard line note that for the for
mula, the opponent's 30-yard line
would effectively become the 70-
yard line. My professor showed that
we can do a pretty good linear
approximation for the formula,
where V(x) = -2 + ,09x.
Though both Harbaughs made
some questionable decisions in the
Super Bowl, I'm going to focus on one
specific decision by San Francisco
head coach Jim Harbaugh. Late in
the third quarter, he made a decision
that clearly shows how clueless NFL
coaches are when it comes to fourth
down choices.
After a penalty for running into
the kicker gave the Niners a fourth
down and two at the Ravens 16-yard
line, Jim Harbaugh had a decision to
make. His kicker, David Akers, who
had been spotty at best all season,
had just missed a 39-yard field goal
attempt. However, the penalty gave
him a second chance.
Should Harbaugh have let Akers
kick it again or should he have sent
the offense back on the field? Let's
take a look at the math.
Based on the model introduced
earlier —V(x) = -2 + ,09x —if the
49ers failed on fourth down, the
expected value of the Ravens' next
possession would be around -0.7
points. This is equivalent to 0.7 points
for the 49ers — due to poor field
position for the Ravens. If the 49ers
converted, the expected value of the
rest of the possession would be a min
imum of 5.7 points I say minimum
because that assumes the Niners got
just enough yardage on fourth down
to get the first.
Now what do you think the
chances are that the 49ers convert on
the play? According to The New York
Time's sports blog The Fifth Down,
the historical success rate for the
offense on fourth and two is 60 per
cent. I'll spare you the rest of the
math and just say that, based on that
number, the 49ers' expected value by
going for it would have been 3.7
points, well above the total of three
points for the field goal.
I'm sure some of you will argue
that the Ravens' defense is better
than average, therefore decreasing
the chances that the Niners would
convert on the play. However, for the
math to even suggest that Harbaugh
should have let Akers kick doesn't
start to swing until you put the con
version odds at below 50 percent;
there's no way the Baltimore defense
has that big of an advantage over the
potent San Francisco offense.
I know this is only one decision,
but I think it is emblematic of a trend
that dominates the NFL. Well, a
trend that dominated the NFL.
Chip Kelly would have gone for
it and if he had Marcus Mariota,
Kenjon Barner and De' Anthony
Thomas, he probably would have
made it.
These single plays, by them
selves, don't decide whether a team
is going to win the Super Bowl.
However, over the course of the
season, making the right decision
on fourth down can be very signifi
cant.
I'd bet there is at least a play or
two in every game when most NFL
coaches throw away one point of
expected value. It might not sound
like much, but in the hypercompet
itive NFL, these plays could make
the difference between making and

missing the playoffs.
I'm glad Chip Kelly will be the
one making these decisions for the
Eagles.

Now that Chip Kelly lias left Ore
gon, Sam is cons idering trading in
his David Shaw sweatshirt for a
Chip Kelly visor. Give him fashion
advice at safisher@stanford.edu
