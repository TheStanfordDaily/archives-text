## Card looks to bounce back from Arizona loss

There are very few guarantees in life. But if
you were to flip on ESPN today or any other
February day you are basically guaranteed to
see a story about March Madness and the "bub

right on the edge of tournament contention but
haven't quite done enough to lock up a spot in the
NCAA Tourney. The Stanford Cardinal men's
basketball team currently falls under that cate

Wildcats would surely have launched Stanford
into the national spotlight and earned the team

some major tournament recognition. After the
loss, however, Stanford must play relatively per

winning the Pac-12 Tournament.
"We've got to go out and fight every single
game, no matter who we're playing, because in
this conference, we're real close," said junior for

as you've seen lately. But as long as we go out,
play team basketball and work hard, then I have
no problem with the results."

tinues Saturday night when the Cardinal (14-9,
5-5 Pac-12) travels to Tempe, Ariz., to take on the
Arizona State Sun Devils (1-5, 7-3 Pac-12). The
Sun Devils pulled off a close 66-62 win over Cal
last night and have enjoyed recent success in a
