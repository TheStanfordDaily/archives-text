## Card looks to bounce back from Arizona loss 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
There are very few guarantees in life. But if
you were to flip on ESPN today or any other
February day you are basically guaranteed to
see a story about March Madness and the "bub
ble teams." The bubble teams are those that are
right on the edge of tournament contention but
haven't quite done enough to lock up a spot in the
NCAA Tourney. The Stanford Cardinal men's
basketball team currently falls under that cate
gory.
After a heartbreaking 73-66 loss to the Pac
-12 leading Arizona Wildcats, in which Stanford
squandered a lead that they had held for the
entire game, the Cardinal has left itself with a
steep road to climb. A road win against the No. 7
Wildcats would surely have launched Stanford
into the national spotlight and earned the team

some major tournament recognition. After the
loss, however, Stanford must play relatively per
fect basketball for the rest of the season to cap
ture an at-large bid or earn an automatic bid by
winning the Pac-12 Tournament.
"We've got to go out and fight every single
game, no matter who we're playing, because in
this conference, we're real close," said junior for
ward Josh Huestis. 'Anybody can beat anybody,
as you've seen lately. But as long as we go out,
play team basketball and work hard, then I have
no problem with the results."
The road to a March Madness invitation con
tinues Saturday night when the Cardinal (14-9,
5-5 Pac-12) travels to Tempe, Ariz., to take on the
Arizona State Sun Devils (1-5, 7-3 Pac-12). The
Sun Devils pulled off a close 66-62 win over Cal
last night and have enjoyed recent success in a

improve their playoff chances when they go south to take on Arizona State this weekend.
tough Pac-12 conference.
Stanford will be faced with the
difficult task of slowing down the
Sun Devils' freshman phenom Jahii
Carson. Carson, a highly touted
recruit out of high school who decid
ed to play ball in his home state, has
been even better than advertised.
The guard has embarrassed oppos
ing defenses, averaging 18.0 points
per game on 46.2 percent shooting
from the floor. Carson is shooting
almost 30 percent from beyond the
arc and has the dribble-drive ability
to blow past almost any defender. He
has also been Arizona State's best
distributor, using his excellent court
vision and passing ability to get his
teammates open looks. Carson is
leading his team in assists, averaging

5.3 per game.
Carson is not the only player who
makes the Sun Devils dangerous.
His teammate Carrick Felix has put
up impressive numbers as well. The
senior has assumed a leadership role
for Arizona State, demonstrating a
mental toughness and fortitude that
only comes with experience. The Sun
Devils' prowess in the paint has
resulted largely from Felix's ability
to rebound despite being undersized
for a forward. The 6-foot-6 combo
player is averaging eight rebounds
per game. He is also second on the
team in scoring, averaging 14.6
points per game with 52.3 percent
shooting from the field. Felix has
emerged as a legitimate NBA
prospect due to his versatility and
high-motor play.
Before the Arizona game, Stan
ford had been on a roll, defeating No.
10 Oregon for the Cardinal's first win
over a top-10 opponent in five years.
Huestis was named Pac-12 Player of

the week after averaging 15 points,
13 rebounds and 2.5 blocks while
shooting 68.8 percent in the three
games before the Arizona loss.
Dwight Powell also earned his
sixth double-double against Arizona.
The Cardinal will count on the junior
forward to help counter the Sun
Devils' attack.
The Cardinal defense will have to
play with the same tenacity that has
helped them win three of their last
four games. If Stanford wants to
earn a spot in the 2013 NCAA Tour
nament, they will need to start by
making a statement in the Pac-12.
The journey begins this Saturday in
Tempe.
"We've got a lot of games to play,
and where we sit right now means
nothing," Huestis said. "We've got to
go into every single game like our
backs are up against the wall."
