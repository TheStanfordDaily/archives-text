## Swimmers to battle Trojans 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The stakes will be high at Avery Aquatics Cen
ter on Saturday afternoon as the mighty No. 3
USC Trojans (5-0,2-0 Pac-12) come to the Farm to
do battle with the No. 9 Cardinal (4-0, 2-0 Pac-12)
in a matchup of two Pac-12 men's swimming pow
erhouses.
Stanford may be ranked six spots lower than
the Men of Troy, but looks can be deceiving; the
Cardinal has emerged victorious in the last six
dual-meet matchups between the two teams. Addi
tionally, Stanford is fresh off of a convincing upset
against formerly top-ranked Arizona that gives the
Card the momentum coming into this matchup.
This will be the second tough matchup of the week
end for USC, who will go head to head with No. 6
Cal on Friday before then' trip to Stanford.
The Trojans boast a formidable lineup of swim
mers, highlighted by Olympic bronze medalist and
defending Pac-12 Swhnmer of the Month Vladimir
Morozov. The junior has put up eye-popping times
this year and holds the fastest time nationally in
the 100-yard freestyle, along with top-10 times in
the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard breast
stroke. Morozov is an incredibly versatile swim
mer who has the potential to do damage to the
Cardinal in many areas.
Countering for Stanford will be sprinter Aaron
Wayne, who has been a consistent threat in the 50-
and 100-yard freestyle. The senior
placed fourth nationally in both
events last season. Although Wayne
has shown the capability to swim
incredible times throughout his
career, his times this year are not as
competitive as they have been in
years past. It will take his best
effort to top Morozov on Saturday.
Morozov isn't the only Olympic
medalist who will be competing on
Saturday. The Cardinal will send
reliable sophomore Kristian Ipsen
to the diving boards as the bronze
medalist looks to continue to deliver
strong performances. After a
tremendous 2012 campaign in which
he won the NCAA title in the 3-
meter dive, Ipsen will be a signifi
cant contributor as Stanford aims to
pull off the upset.
USC senior co-captain Alex
Lendrum also looks to do some
damage against Stanford in his
strength, the backstroke. One of
the nation's fastest in the 100 and
200-yard backstroke, the returning
Ail-American will attempt to con
tinue his dominance against the
Cardinal.
The true strength for the Cardi
nal squad is its versatility. At any
given time, there are several ath
letes for every event who threat
en to give Stanford a victory.

Sophomore Drew Cosgarea has
the potential to perform well in
both short-distance and long-dis
tance freestyle events, back
stroke and the individual medley
(IM). Sophomore David Nolan is
also a threat in the breaststroke,
IM, freestyle and backstroke.
Both Cosgarea and Nolan have
finished in first place in all of those
events at various points this year,
giving Stanford a multitude of

options.
Although the Trojan swimmers
seem to have a significant edge on
paper, this Stanford squad is eagerly
awaiting its chance to pull off a sec
ond consecutive upset of a top-three
team. USC and Stanford do battle at
Avery on Saturday afternoon at 1
p.m.
