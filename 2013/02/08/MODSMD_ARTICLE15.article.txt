# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Anteaters to provide stiff test 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
After back-to-back matches in Hawaii, the
Stanford men's volleyball team will return to the
Farm where it hasn't lost this season for
two weekend home matches. The No. 3 Cardinal
(7-3,4-3 Pac-12) will face No. 1 UC-Irvine (8-3,5-
3 Pac-12) tonight, and newly unranked UC-San
Diego (4-8, 2-6 Pac-12) on Saturday. The Cardi
nal is coming off two hard-fought, physically and
mentally exhausting matches against No. 13
Hawaii in which Stanford won the first and lost
the second.
While the past weekend demonstrated that
Stanford has yet to find a solution for its strug
gles on the road, the team seems to be comfort
able at home. But despite the home advantage
based on the great atmosphere and fan base at
Maples, it will need to be performing at its best
against the formidable Anteaters.
UC-Irvine currently has a four-game win
streak after beating both UCLA and UC-Santa
Barbara on the road last week. Sen
ior Ail-American outside hitter Kevin
Tillie has been performing at his pin
nacle, hitting a .485 last game with 18
kills, and is showing no signs of stop
ping.
While Stanford's defense has
been improving, it will need to find a
way to keep Tillie from heating up.
Cardinal sophomore libero Grant
Delgado had a successful weekend
against Hawaii with a career-high
15 digs. Stanford dominated Hawaii
defensively, holding them to a .187
hitting percentage. While the
Anteaters are a stronger hitter team
than Hawaii, if Stanford can contin
ue its strong defensive performance,
then UC-Irvine will struggle to exe
cute at their usual level.
Not only will Stanford's defense
have to be at its best, but the
offense must find away to overcome
the troubles it faced during the sec
ond match against Hawaii, where
hitting was a weakness.
Junior Steven Irvin will be cru
cial in leading the Cardinal offense.
Irvin had a career-high 27 kills in
the first match against Hawaii, hit
ting a .548 with three aces and eight
digs. Accompanying Irvin's tremen
dous performance was junior Brian
Cook, who had 20 kills and eight
assists against Hawaii.
If Stanford's offense can per
form as they did in their first match
against Hawaii and setter James
Shaw can build off his latest 47
assists and 12 digs, then UC-

Irvine's defense will have their
hands full.
Still, UC-Irvine's libero Michael
Brinkley, who had a career-high 20
digs over UCLA, will be tough to
beat. Stanford cannot let UC-Irvine
pull ahead early because the
Anteaters rarely give up a lead.
Stanford will face an easier chal
lenge on Saturday against UCSD.
While the Tritons were ranked No.
13 until last week, their loss to No. 7
Long Beach State lost them a place
in the current rankings. UCSD has
not won an away game this year (0-
3), is coming off two losses in a row
to UCSB and UCLA and will play
Friday night against Pacific. Howev
er, UCSD was one of the few teams
to beat Stanford at home last year.
The two largest threats on
UCSD will be outside hitter Nick
lorfino and freshman Cory
Swartzbaugh.
Stanford faces a tough and defin
ing weekend ahead. The Cardinal is
still trying to find itself as a young
team and one that has been inconsis
tent on the road. This weekend, Stan
ford faces an opportunity to beat the
No. 1 team, recover from a hard loss
and define its team identity.
Stanford's game against UC-
Irvine will be at Burnham Pavilion
tonight at 6:30 p.m. The Cardinal
meets the Tritons on Saturday at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
