## Anteaters to provide stiff test 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
After back-to-back matches in Hawaii, the
Stanford men's volleyball team will return to the
Farm where it hasn't lost this season for
two weekend home matches. The No. 3 Cardinal
(7-3,4-3 Pac-12) will face No. 1 UC-Irvine (8-3,5-
3 Pac-12) tonight, and newly unranked UC-San
Diego (4-8, 2-6 Pac-12) on Saturday. The Cardi
nal is coming off two hard-fought, physically and
mentally exhausting matches against No. 13
Hawaii in which Stanford won the first and lost
the second.
While the past weekend demonstrated that
Stanford has yet to find a solution for its strug
gles on the road, the team seems to be comfort
able at home. But despite the home advantage
based on the great atmosphere and fan base at
Maples, it will need to be performing at its best
against the formidable Anteaters.
UC-Irvine currently has a four-game win
streak after beating both UCLA and UC-Santa
