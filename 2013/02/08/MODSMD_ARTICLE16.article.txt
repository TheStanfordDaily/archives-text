# Wildcats in town for rare visit
## 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team
will play host to Arizona tonight at Maples Pavilion.
It will be the only scheduled meeting between the
two teams this season and marks the first time that
the Wildcats have visited the Farm in over two
years.
The Cardinal (20-2,9-1 Pae-12) is currently tied
for top spot in the Pac-12 Conference with No. 6 Cal,
while the Wildcats (11-10, 3-7 Pac-12) are tied for
eighth place with in-state rival Arizona State. The
Sun Devils (11-10, 3-7 Pac-12) will be playing the

Golden Bears (11-11, 3-7 Pac-12) tonight, before
crossing the Bay to face Stanford on Sunday
Stanford leads the all-time series against Ari
zona 57-12 and has won the last 21 matchups
between the teams. The Wildcats also enter this
contest on a ran of five straight defeats while the
Cardinal has strung together six wins since Cal
dealt it its first loss in the Pac-12 since January 2009.
Adding extra incentive to this game, with just
eight outings left in this year's Pac-12 slate for the
Cardinal, it is closing in on a 13th straight title and a
bye through the first round of the Pac-12 Tourna
ment in early March. If Stanford wins out, it will be
guaranteed both, but to take sole possession of the

conference crown and the top seed for the tourna
ment, it may need a little luck. Cross-bay rival Cal is
showing little sign of slowing down and is currently
ranked nationally just a couple of places lower than
the Card.
Last time out, against Oregon State in Corvallis,
Ore., Stanford junior forward Chiney Ogwumike
made headlines with a huge double-double perform
ance, recording a personal best 32 points and adding
18 rebounds. Her play in the 6545 win helped bring
her a record-tying fifth Pac-12 Player of the Week
award on the season and means that, with a career

Sophomore guard Amber Orrange (above) had 17 assists in two games last weekend to lead the Cardinal to victories over both Oregon and
Oregon State. Stanford looks to continue its winning ways against Arizona and Arizona State in matchups at Maples Pavilion this weekend.
