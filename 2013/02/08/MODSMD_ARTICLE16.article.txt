# Wildcats in town for rare visit
## 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team
will play host to Arizona tonight at Maples Pavilion.
It will be the only scheduled meeting between the
two teams this season and marks the first time that
the Wildcats have visited the Farm in over two
years.
The Cardinal (20-2,9-1 Pae-12) is currently tied
for top spot in the Pac-12 Conference with No. 6 Cal,
while the Wildcats (11-10, 3-7 Pac-12) are tied for
eighth place with in-state rival Arizona State. The
Sun Devils (11-10, 3-7 Pac-12) will be playing the

Golden Bears (11-11, 3-7 Pac-12) tonight, before
crossing the Bay to face Stanford on Sunday
Stanford leads the all-time series against Ari
zona 57-12 and has won the last 21 matchups
between the teams. The Wildcats also enter this
contest on a ran of five straight defeats while the
Cardinal has strung together six wins since Cal
dealt it its first loss in the Pac-12 since January 2009.
Adding extra incentive to this game, with just
eight outings left in this year's Pac-12 slate for the
Cardinal, it is closing in on a 13th straight title and a
bye through the first round of the Pac-12 Tourna
ment in early March. If Stanford wins out, it will be
guaranteed both, but to take sole possession of the

conference crown and the top seed for the tourna
ment, it may need a little luck. Cross-bay rival Cal is
showing little sign of slowing down and is currently
ranked nationally just a couple of places lower than
the Card.
Last time out, against Oregon State in Corvallis,
Ore., Stanford junior forward Chiney Ogwumike
made headlines with a huge double-double perform
ance, recording a personal best 32 points and adding
18 rebounds. Her play in the 6545 win helped bring
her a record-tying fifth Pac-12 Player of the Week
award on the season and means that, with a career

Sophomore guard Amber Orrange (above) had 17 assists in two games last weekend to lead the Cardinal to victories over both Oregon and
Oregon State. Stanford looks to continue its winning ways against Arizona and Arizona State in matchups at Maples Pavilion this weekend.
total of seven, she is just one honor
away from Stanford greats Candice
Wiggins'oB and Jayne Appel'lo.
The Wildcats will look to senior
guard Davellyn Whyte and junior
guard/forward Kama Griffitts, who
transferred from North Idaho Col
lege last season. Both Whyte and
Griffitts boast scoring averages in the
double figures this season, with 16.4
and 12.0 points per game respective
ly. Whyte has also handed out 4.81
assists per game, the second-highest
in the Pac-12.
Ogwumike, though, has twice as
many boards as Arizona's leading
rebounder. The junior has 12.3
rebounds per game compared to jun
ior forward Alii Gloyd's 6.1 and also
leads the conference in three crucial
statistical categories: scoring (22.4
points per game), field-goal percent
age (58.4) and double-doubles (17).

However, as Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer has stressed sever
al times this season, the Card will
need big contributions from else
where on the roster. It cannot rely
purely on Ogwumike if it hopes to win
more silverware and return to the
NCAA Final Four for a sixth straight
season.
Against the Oregon schools last
weekend, sophomore guard Amber
Orrange took up that challenge, con
trolling the play and handing out 17
assists over the two contests. She also
took home 12 points against OSU and
is fourth in the Pac-12 in assists (4.27
apg). Fellow sophomore Bonnie
Samuelson also had a major contribu
tion in her 11 minutes on the floor,
the forward went 4-5 from down
town. She currently ranks second on
three-point shooting percentage in
the conference (36.8).
So far this season, Stanford has
been unbeatable away from home,
with a record of 13-0, but has dropped
two games at Maples, against No. 3
Connecticut and California. However,
those contests were against two of

the nation's top-ranked teams, and so
the Cardinal should certainly be the
favorite when hosting the two
unranked Arizona schools.
As a team, Stanford is first in the
Pac-12 in six statistical categories,
including its scoring defense, holding
teams to an average of just 53.0
points per game, and scoring margin,
with an average gap of 17.3 points
between Stanford and the opposing
team.
The Cardinal can also count on a
height advantage that may prove
useful in the battle for rebounds.
Stanford's relatively small starting
line up against Oregon State was still
a combined two inches taller than
Arizona's against Washington State,
and the Card boasts six 6-foot-3 play
ers on its roster, while the tallest two
Wildcat players are just 6-foot-2.
Friday's game between Stanford
and Arizona will tip off at Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m. PT and will be
broadcast live on KZSU.
