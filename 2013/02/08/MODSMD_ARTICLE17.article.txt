## SEEING GREEN From Gridiron to Grid 
### Holly Moeller 
CHERRY HILL, N.J.
"Well, that's embarrassing,"
my Dad said as the cameras
panned across the darkened Super
dome.
To fill the half-hour gap in Super
Bowl XLVII, the TV commentators
made idle chitchat, Dad watched
You Tube videos on his smartphone
and I added a few more rows to the
latest baby blanket to hang from my
knitting needles. Meanwhile, behind
the scenes, Superdome workers
scrambled to restore light to Ameri
ca's biggest sporting event.
Although we still don't know the
full story behind the Super Bowl
power outage, the incident served
as a very public reminder of how a
relatively small failure (in this case,
an error message resulting in a
flipped breaker) can bring down an
entire system (or, you know, half
the Superdome).
It's a lesson worth keeping in
mind at larger scales: namely, the
nationwide electricity grid. Which
the American Society of Civil Engi
neers (ASCE) would like us to
think about. Right now.
The country's network of power
lines, which connects 1,137
Gigawatts of generating power to
130 million homes, is getting old. In
some areas, pieces of infrastruc
ture that are half a century old are
long overdue for replacement;
many locations would benefit from
overhauls to improve efficiency and
reliability.
At the same time, we've never
relied on our electricity more. The
transportation system is over
loaded, with many lines running at
or near capacity. So when the
inevitable happens and one of those
lines snaps, the others struggle
under the additional burden of
rerouted power. Just as a major
traffic snarl on Interstate 280 can
slow down the 101 as commuters
switch sides of the Peninsula, so too
can the flow of power be forced
through uncomfortable bottle
necks, sometimes producing addi
tional failures.
We've seen examples of the pow
er grid's vulnerability across the
country over the last decade: the
dramatic Northeast power failure
0f2003, brownouts and blackouts in
Boston, Los Angeles and Manhat
tan and, just a few months ago, the
effects of Hurricane Sandy on New
York and New Jersey. Sandy, whose
storm surge forced the shutdown of
several power plants, also high
lighted the centralization of our
electricity production and its subse
quent vulnerability to natural dis
aster, human error and, of course,
terrorist attack.
The ASCE would like us to
invest $lO7 billion in grid improve
ments between now and 2020 to
patch weak points, make room for
ever-increasing demand and incor
porate new technology into a
"Smart Grid."
The term "Smart Grid" has got
ten a lot of use over the past few
years. In fact, the Obama adminis
tration earmarked $3.4 billion for
its development. There's no one
definition for the hip new phrase,
which serves as a catchall for a
suite of modernizing technologies
designed to make electricity deliv
ery more streamlined and respon
sive. Truly smart gilds instanta
neously collect and respond to elec
tricity production and consumption

information, turning off or revving
up generators as demand ebbs or
spikes and using past data to antic
ipate future needs (like, say, power
ing millions of televisions tuned in
to the Super Bowl on one special
Sunday night each year).
A Smart Grid, proponents
argue, would also be uniquely suit
ed for the future of electricity gen
eration. Although large power
plants are incredibly cost efficient,
they may be unsustainable (as fos
sil fuel supplies dwindle and the
hazards of climate change become
more apparent) or too risky
(Japan's 2011 earthquake left many
nations nervous about nuclear pow
er). New green technologies lend
themselves to more dispersed
applications: a bank of solar panels
perched on each roof in the neigh
borhood, a few wind turbines on an
environmentally conscious
research campus. This "distributed
generation" might one day make
our energy supply more reliable by
reducing our dependence on single
points of failure and ensuring a lim
itless, renewable supply.
But it requires an electricity
grid that can shunt power in two
directions and allow for its tempo
rary storage in batteries dispersed
throughout the system (like a base
ment battery bank or a Prius
plugged in out on the driveway).
This means billions of dollars in
investment and a few years of trial
and error before the Smart Grid
realizes its true potential.
Meanwhile, back in New
Orleans, the lights have come back
on over the gridiron. The stadium
engineers are mopping their brows.
The '49ers are about to start an
inspiring but ultimately heart
breaking run that will leave them
just short of a record-breaking
comeback. And across the country,
we'll shout at our televisions, casti
gate the refs' bad calls and relish
the game that comes but once a
year.

Although large
power plants are
very cost
efficient, they
maybe
unsustainable.
