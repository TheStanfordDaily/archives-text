# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## A
						Response to Joel Brinkley's Offensive Article 
### 
The Tribune Media Services
recently published an article
titled "Despite increasing
prosperity, Vietnam's appetites
remain unique," written by Stan
ford's own Professor Joel Brinkley.
Through many stereotypical asser
tions, Professor Brinkley has
denounced the country of Vietnam
as "gruesome," subsisting on a
backwards diet of endangered ani
mals. The Stanford Vietnamese
Student Association, in solidarity
with numerous on-campus organi
zations, finds this article to be a per
version of the cultural image of
Vietnam and an antithesis to the
mission of tolerance that Stanford
University students and faculty
alike should promote.
Professor Brinkley's article is a
thinly veiled attack on the culture of
Vietnam, specifically its culinary
habits. His offensive statements,
such as the assertion that the Viet
namese have consumed almost all of
their wild/domesticated animals,
are inaccurate and sensationalist.
They are loosely based on statistics
rooted in unmentioned context.
Professor Brinkley defends his
opinion piece by referencing his
short 10-day visit to the country; he
responds to opposition by further

insulting other cultures with scien
tific fallacies.
We must reply that his research
based on personal observation and
mere hearsay is incredibly negli
gent. It is impossible for Professor
Brinkley to see the real Vietnam, its
beauty and true faults, if he
approaches the experience with
ethnocentric prejudice. His state
ments on the "tradition" of eating
dogs for luck, for example, are an
incomplete translation of a proverb
praising living dogs for bringing
wealth to a family. He also ignores
that the consumption of dog is not
"unique" to Vietnam. His lack of
care for properly introducing the
traditions of a foreign culture is evi
dent in his disregard for the subtle
nuances of their customs. It is true
that a small minority eats dog meat,
but his judgments on cultural prac
tices different than his own are sim
ply racist. Furthermore, the Viet
namese population is composed of
54 diverse ethnic groups. For Pro
fessor Brinkley to judge an entire
nation by the actions of a few is to
ignore the multifaceted beauty of
Vietnamese culture.
Given his reputable career as a
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and a visiting scholar at Stanford,

Professor Brinkley has a responsi
bility to present the truth. In this
regard, he has disappointed this
student body; we expect more from
our professors than unscientific
claims connecting the supposed
"aggression" of a nation to the meat
in its diet. His influence becomes a
misguided weapon: By condemning
a culture he doesn't understand, he
insults not only native Vietnamese,
but also Vietnamese and other
Asians globally. We have fought
against the stereotypical jokes and
rumors surrounding our cultures,
but he makes Asian Americans like
us feel like foreigners in our own
home. Professor Brinkley has poor
ly represented the Stanford com
munity, often considered a haven of
cultural understanding and critical
thinking.
To Professor Brinkley: You pre
viously wrote that Vietnam "is a
country to watch and perhaps,
one day soon, to admire." We hope
that you will revisit your words with
a clearer understanding of your
mistaken judgments and instead
give Vietnam a fair chance to reach
the potential you once envisioned.
