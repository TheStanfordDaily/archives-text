## StartX Demo Day gathers startups, investors 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
StartX, a nonprofit startup accelera
tor for University-affiliated entrepre
neurs, hosted their eighth Demo Day last
night, with 11 startups presenting to a
crowd of approximately 250 investors and
members of the media.
Though StartX is financially and legal

ly separate from the University, it works
in partnership with Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) and was initially
named SSE Labs. The majority of
StartX's 31 full-time and support-staff
members are Stanford students, and over
six percent of Stanford students apply to
StartX every year.
The majority of the presenting start
ups were members of the accelerator's

most recent class, though several alumni
startups returned to Demo Day for addi
tional fundraising. Presenting companies
represented a wide variety of industries
including medical technology, educational
technology, consumer Internet, biological
technology and enterprise.
