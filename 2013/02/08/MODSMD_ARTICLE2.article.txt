## StartX Demo Day gathers startups, investors 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
StartX, a nonprofit startup accelera
tor for University-affiliated entrepre
neurs, hosted their eighth Demo Day last
night, with 11 startups presenting to a
crowd of approximately 250 investors and
members of the media.
Though StartX is financially and legal

ly separate from the University, it works
in partnership with Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) and was initially
named SSE Labs. The majority of
StartX's 31 full-time and support-staff
members are Stanford students, and over
six percent of Stanford students apply to
StartX every year.
The majority of the presenting start
ups were members of the accelerator's

most recent class, though several alumni
startups returned to Demo Day for addi
tional fundraising. Presenting companies
represented a wide variety of industries
including medical technology, educational
technology, consumer Internet, biological
technology and enterprise.

StartX's eighth Demo Day brought together Stanford-connected startups and Silicon Valley investors for a series of pitches
and presentations. The startups represented a wide range of industries, from medical technology to consumer Internet.
funding sources through
Demo Days, where founders
give short pitches and inter
act with investors. Accord
ing to Alexa Lee '95, director
of PR and communications
at StartX, investors from Sil
icon Valley to New York
travel to the three Demo
Days hosted each year.
"We don't just invite any
one to Demo Day â€”it is
actually pretty exclusive,"
Lee said. "These are the
world's most prestigious and
influential investors."
Lawrence Udell, founder
of the Silicon Valley Chapter
of the Licensing Executives
Society, is one such investor.
Udell said that he has
attended every StartX
Demo Day in hopes of find
ing new companies to invest
in.
"I'm looking to see what
is new, where the future is
and find how much excite
ment there is with young
people and new technolo
gies," Udell said. "I'm also
looking for potential invest
ments."
Smita Saxena M.S. 'lO
first attracted the attention
of investors after going
through the StartX program
with Accevia, a financial
services company that was
acquired by its first client in
early 2011.
Saxena pitched her sec
ond company, SpotOn, to
investors at the most recent
Demo Day. SpotOn is a time
based search engine that
takes information about a
user's schedule, personality,
location, budget, interests
and relationship status to
generate a list of activities
that he or she might be
interested in.
"We're all busy, but we
have those hours of time
when we're not really sure
what the optimal thing to do
is," Saxena said. "What we
do is match the right activity
to the right person at the
right time. Our long-term
concept is to become your
concierge."
According to Saxena,
SpotOn's technology could
be coming to Stanford stu
dents soon, as the company
is collaborating with Stan
ford Athletics to integrate
sporting events into student
calendars.
Lee said that investors
are attracted to StartX
because of Stanford's repu
tation for producing talented
entrepreneurs such as Saxe
na,
"Stanford alums have
created over 5,000 tech com
panies and some of the
world's best known compa
nies. There is a high expecta
tion from Stanford
founders," Lee said. "That
the thing that attracts the
investors. If there is a talent
pool anywhere in the Valley
this is going to be a very
high concentration."
The level of talent in the
StartX pool also attracts
mentors like John Baer, the
founder of Threshold Ven

tares, who said that his work
with StartX companies was a
natural extension of his work
as a venture capitalist. Baer
most recently mentored
Insynctive, an HR Service
Delivery Platform co-found
ed by Eric Kish GSB 'l2.
"I think they have found a
really neat market niche and
are targeting customers and
doing a great job," Baer said
about Insynctive.
Linkedln co-founder
Konstantin Guericke '9O M.S.
'9l was also drawn to the
StartX program as a mentor.
Guericke works in the School
of Engineering as an indus
try mentor and learned
about the program from a
group of students who were
in the first StartX class. He
most recently mentored
Meet Mikey, a startup
focused on making email
more efficient.
Guernicke noted that the
quality of startups in the pro
gram has improved during
his years as a mentor, while
StartX has become more rec
ognized and highly regarded
on campus.
"Fewer and fewer stu
dents don't know what
StartX is," he said. "In the
beginning, [StartX] didn't
get everywhere, but now
they are getting the cream of
the crop on campus."
According to Guernicke,
the program has drawn older
participants in recent years,
which helped the program
expand to a wider range of
entrepreneurial challenges.
"In the first phase, it was
all about things that students
could use in their own life
like photo sharing or trip
planning or deals or things
like that," he said. "[Those
are] not really things that
help companies be more
effective or getting new
drugs to market."
Several companies that
presented at the Demo Day
have already proved their
influence beyond the student
population and found com
mercial success through
partnerships with estab
lished organizations.
Kyle Wong 'l2, founder of
Pixlee, a platform that helps
companies develop market
ing using authentic customer
photos, said that the San
Francisco 49ers worked with
Pixlee throughout the entire
football season. Most
notably, the 49ers used
Pixlee to "rally fans for the
Super Bowl" by allowing
them to submit fan pictures.
The project received 72 mil
lion submissions.
Wong participated in the
spring 2012 session of
StartX. Since then, Pixlee
has worked with Yamaha,
Major League Soccer, Whole
Foods, NASCAR and

approximately one third of
NBA franchises. Wong cred
ited some of this success to
connections he formed at
Stanford.
"The Stanford communi
ty has been really helpful in
developing Pixlee," Wong
said. "Being able to work
with other really talented
Stanford entrepreneurs has
been a blessing. The Stan
ford connection is just so
helpful when you are in Sili
con Valley and being able to
meet people who can help
you and give you guidance
because you are from Stan
ford."
Dylan Arena 'Ol M.A. 'Ol
M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l2 also went
through StartX's spring 2012
program with his company,
Kidaptive. Kidaptive
received its first round of
funding after presenting at
the spring Demo Day and
returned to the winter 2013
Demo Day looking for more
financing to build out the
rest of its first project.
Kidaptive, which uses
research from the School of
Education, is focused on
allowing parents to support
their child's learning devel
opment through educational
games called "appisodes."
Patrick Gallagher, co
founder of CrunehFund,
attended the Demo Day to
support Kidaptive, which he
invested in. Gallagher said
he had not previously
attended a StartX Demo
Day, but was impressed by
the companies that present
ed and appreciated that
StartX had fewer presenta
tions than some of the larger
startup accelerators.
"It's a little bit more inti
mate in terms of the number
of people that are here and
the access you have to the
companies and the people,"
he said. "It's nice."
StartX recently received
$400,000 in additional fund
ing from new partners and
will be announcing another
major partnership in the
next week, according to
founder Cameron Teitelman
'lO.
Teitelman said that the
StartX program has continu
ally improved over time and
said that he expected the
trend to continue into the
future.
"Everyone always tells
me that the quality keeps
getting better and better,"
he said. "It's because we're
having more and more peo
ple applying in more and
more industries. The compa
nies are just getting more
sophisticated on the way in.
They're getting more
mature."
