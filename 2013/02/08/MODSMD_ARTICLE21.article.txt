## Researchers engineer H.I.V. resistance through genes 
### NITISH KULKARNI 
A Stanford School of Medicine researcher
has discovered an innovative way to engineer
immune system cells to resist H.I.V infection.
The breakthrough has the potential to ulti
mately assist the development of gene thera
pies meant to counter the virus.
Matthew Porteus M.D. '94 Ph.D. '94
focused his research on altering genes' pro
teins to prevent the virus from attaching to T
cells, which are specialized immune cells. His
team which included University of Texas
Southwestern Professor of Molecular Genet
ics and Microbiology Sara Sawyer and
M.D./Ph.D. candidate Richard Voit used a
technique called homologous recombination
to increase resistance via small cell muta
tions.
"We are trying to give the T-cells a new
property," Porteus said. "Normally they are
not H.I.V resistant, and what we are doing is
changing their DNA so that they become
H.I.V resistant."
While the technique inserted genes from
the Rhesus monkey into human cells, Porteus
downplayed the significance of the limited
usage of monkey genes.
"What we're honestly worried about is if
we put entire monkey genes into humans
then the body will recognize them as foreign
and reject them," he said. "That's why like we
like to use the hybrid gene, where only a tiny
portion of the gene is from the monkey."
Voit, who began working with Porteus in
2008, said that the team's discovery was stim
ulated by merging the specialties of Porteus'
and Sawyer's labs.

"It was actually pretty fortuitous set of
circumstances. At Matt's lab, a focus of
research has been strategically modifying the
genome itself," Voit said. "The other side of it
was Sara Sawyer, whose lab is discovering
new immune mechanisms that protect cells
against H.I.V"
Voit, Sawyer and Porteus began working
together after Porteus visited UT-Southwest
ern in 2008 to give a seminar. A collaborative
partnership formed, and the team applied
technologies developed at Stanford to
genomes discovered at UT-Southwestern.
"My lab is interested in finding new treat
ments for diseases like thalassemia and sick
le cell disease and such," Porteus said. "Out of
that work, we have gotten really good at mod
ifying a genome."
Sawyer said that, when she met Porteus, the
two realized that his work could be applied to
H.I.V as well.
"We talked about how his approach may be
useful to treat H.I.V/AIDS patients," she
said. "We came up with this crazy idea and
never thought that we would pursue it."
Though Sawyer believes their discovery
could eventually be used to treat patients, she
predicted it would be a long time before this
opportunity is available.
"I'm sure it won't happen as soon as I
would like it to," she said. "The standards are
so high. So far, this is ultimately only working
in the lab, but the idea is to take T-cells resist
ant to H.I.V and reintroduce them into a
patient's body."
