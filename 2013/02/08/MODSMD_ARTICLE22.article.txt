# TRACK & FIELD
## Track teams go coast to coast 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's track teams traveled 3,000
miles to compete in the Armory Invi
tational in New York City last week
end. Against competition that the
Cardinal could potentially see at the
NCAA Championships in early
March, the Cardinal turned in a
strong performance, led by junior
Michael Atchoo, who was named
Outstanding Performer of the meet.
In the championship mile race on
Saturday, Atchoo beat out Tyler
Stutzman to win the race with a blis
tering time of 4:02:38. Overall, the
race was a strong performance for
the Cardinal as Stanford placed five
men in the top 15.
The junior also ran the anchor lap
of the men's distance relay on Friday
night, turning in a 3.58.7 split over
1,600 meters. In a fantastic finish,
Stanford runners Stutzman, Spencer
Chase, Luke Lefebure and Atchoo
chased down Oregon to take first
with a time of 9:34.20.
"That was a great last lap," Stan
ford head coach Chris Miltenberg
said. "The team ran with a lot of matu
rity composure and toughness."
The Stanford women's distance
medley relay also performed well on
the tight, 200-meter banked track at
the Armory. Kori Carter, Joy O'Hare,
Jessica Tonn and Amy Weissenbach
ran the seventh-fastest time in Stan
ford history to finish fourth in a com
petitive field. Weissenbach, a fresh
man, led off with an impressive 3.20.3
split over 1,200 meters.
The Stanford women were also
led by strong individual performanc
es. In the 60-meter sprint, junior
Katie Nelms won with a personal

best time of 7.61 seconds, good for
ninth best in Stanford history.
Kristyn Williams started her col
legiate career off with a fantastic
performance in the 500-meter race.
The freshman raced in the "college"
division, but her time of 1.13.39 was
better than anyone in either the
"college" or "championship" divi
sions.
In the 800-meter race, Weis
senbach ran the third-fastest indoor
time in school history. The National
High School Federation record
holder in the 800 placed second with
a time of 2:06.72.
"[Weissenbach] did an awesome
job of keeping her composure and
was very assertive on the outside,"
Miltenberg said.
Carter, a junior, placed seventh in
the 60-meter hurdle race against a
field that featured 10 of the top 25
runners in the nation.
The Cardinal will now turn their
attention to the Husky Invitational,
which will be held in Seattle this
weekend.
According to Miltenberg, one of
the most highly anticipated races is
the 3000-meter race, in which Atchoo
will compete.
The Cardinal long-distance run
ners will also have an opportunity to
perform after taking the weekend off
last weekend. Redshirt senior Emilie
Amaro and junior Jessica Tonn are
both slated to compete in the 5000-
meter race. Tonn won the 5000 at the
University of Washington Invitation
al two weeks ago.
"We are going to keep fighting
and being the hardest, toughest team
of the year," Miltenberg said.
