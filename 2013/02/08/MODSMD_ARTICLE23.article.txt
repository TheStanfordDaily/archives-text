## Five Coursera classes recommended for college credit 
### â€” Olivia Moore 
The American Council of Education (ACE) has recom
mended that five courses on Coursera, an online learning plat
form founded by Stanford professors, become eligible for offi
cial college credit.
Associate Professor of Computer Science Andrew Ng and
Professor of Computer Science Daphne Roller Ph.D. '93
launched Coursera in April 2012. The platform currently offers
more than 200 online classes from 33 universities around the
country.
Of the five courses recommended for credit by the ACE,
four are intended for undergraduates: Pre-Calculus, offered by
the University of California, Irvine; Introduction to Genetics
and Evolution and Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach,
both offered by Duke University; and Calculus: Single Vari
able, offered by the University of Pennsylvania. The ACE also
recommended Algebra, offered by the University of California,
Irvine, for vocational credit.
The ACE certification will allow colleges to grant credit for
Coursera courses, though each university will ultimately make
its own decision about awarding credit for the classes. Students
taking classes for official credit will complete a proctored exam
at the end of the course and enroll in the course's Signature
Track, which connects each student's coursework to his or her
identity and creates a shareable course record.
Though enrollment in a Coursera class is usually free, stu
dents receiving credit will pay a fee of $3O to $99 for the Signa
ture Track, and another $6O to $9O for the proctored exam at
the end of the course. Exams will be proctored through the
online service ProctorU, which allows students to connect to a
proctor via webcam.
