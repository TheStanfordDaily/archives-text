Valentine's Day is
upon us, which for
people in relation
ships is a great opportunity
to dress up, go out on a nice
date and flood Instagram
with evidence of their love.
Meanwhile, if you're single,
you're probably dreading a
day full of reminders of

your less-than-ideal relationship status. However, if you're
sick of the whole "eat ice cream, watch 'The Notebook,'
listen to Adele, start crying and text your ex" routine, here
are some suggestions for less pathetic ways to survive
Valentine's Day:

Avoid Facebook

Everything you hate about Facebook is going
to increase tenfold on Valentine's Day: mar
ried high school friends flooding your news
feed with their romantic plans, and obnox
ious single friends posting oh-so-witty sta
tuses about dating Ben and Jerry and cele
brating "Single's Awareness Day" (aka S.A.D.,
which may be the most appropriate acronym
ever). Save yourself the headache and just
avoid the website.

Call Family

Since you're avoiding Facebook, use your
saved time to call family! Valentine's Day is
about love after all, and seriously, when was
the last time you spoke to your grandparents?

Celebrate other holidays

Take advantage of the fact that Valentine's
Day this year falls the same week as Mardi
Gras and Chinese New Year. For example, if
you party hard enough Tuesday night, you
can just shut yourself in catching up on work
on Valentine's Day, so you don't have to
worry about avoiding all the happy couples.

Bug your friends

Don't let couples have all the fun on
Valentine's Day! Numerous student organi
zations are doing serenades and candy gram
delivery services on Valentine's Day. Why not
embarrass your best friend by having
Mariachi or the Mendicants serenade them?
Alternatively, you could take your BFF out
on a romantic date to Ike's or Fraiche, or be
super old school and make Valentine's cards
to deliver to your friends!

Ask out your crush

If you do all of the above and still feel down
about the fact that you're single on
Valentine's Day, why not just ask out the
object of your affections? The timing is
about as romantic as you can get in college,
and if it doesn't work out well, you can
always go back to the old ice cream-and-
Adele routine.
