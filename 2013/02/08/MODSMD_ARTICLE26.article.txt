## GOING THE DISTANCE Coping with long-distance relationship on the most romantic day of the year 
### Katelyn Gutierrez | STAFF WRITER 
you're in a long
distance relation-
That's rough.
Good luck with that!"
First off, no one says
"yipes." But, to my main point:
peers often meet your "tragic"
predicament in this way
with a loosely fitted "thank
goodness-I'm-not-you" gri
mace and a whole lot of pes
simism. Very seldom do those
going the distance encounter a
chipper optimist who might
nod vigorously, saying, "Yeah,
man, keep up the good fight."
For those who may not be in
a long-distance relationship or
remain skeptical about such a
daunting fate, please take a
second to humor me. Long
distance relationships aren't
meant to be these stigmatized
and discouraged hindrances;
they are beautiful challenges
and admirable demonstra
tions of devotion.
Sure, this kind of com
mitment isn't for everyone,
but neither are other alterna
tive relationships (e.g. open
ones). And sure, our human
urges may cause us to toss and
turn in bed, wishing we had
our number-one cuddle
buddy. All relationships neces
sitate effort, work and com
munication in order to sus
tain them. It isn't your fault

you met that someone at a
less-than-convenient time in
each other's lives. Remember:
you didn't choose the strug
life; the strug life chose you.
And that's just the universe,
being a typical asshole. You
can't help but hear the dia
logue unfurl in your mind:
"Oh, you finally found some
one you can share love and
trust? Flere's an ocean and
some land to put between you
both! Enjoy!"
Typical asshole, indeed.
All sad stuff aside, long
distance relationships have
their perks, too. This
Valentine's Day, let's reflect on
the good things in the long
haul. You've got a love that's
so precious, so enduring that
you both know it's worth
keeping even if you'll miss the
handholding, the love-making
and the kisses, among innu
merable things.
You've got your inde
pendence. You won't be stifled
by the lack of personal space,
nor be conflicted about not
having enough "me time."
Doing whatever you want,
whenever you want, without
feeling guilty that you didn't
invite your other half is pretty
fantastic.
Through missing them,
you'll realize your capacity for

truly caring about someone.
With this wonderful thing
we've got here called Teh
Interwebz, you'll relay quick
messages wishing the other a
good day and sending
reminders that you love and
miss him or her (you've also
got that trusty webcam!).
You'll be each other's cheer
leader, encouraging your lover
to keep working hard and to
know that you'll always be
there for him or her, despite
the distance. It will make you
happy to know that you make
someone happy, too.
It takes strength to hold
on to something you believe
in, especially when we're faced
with pessimism wearing the
veneer of "being realistic."
There are the small things that
make long-distance relation
ships worth it, and this
Valentine's Day, I want you to
remind yourself of these
things. Think of the lasting
memories that unfailingly
make you smile, what made
you fall head over heels for this
person and how you've grown
as a couple and as individuals,
because you should know that
your significant other is doing
the same. Congratulations on
fighting the good fight, and
have a Valentine's Day as beau
tiful as your challenge.
