# VIRTUAL HOOK-UP
## Stanford students talk Grindr and germs 
### 
In this age of technology, meeting
people can be as easy as the click
of a button. Recently, after a
breakup, I joined an online dating site
for fun. I met a few awesome people
and a few creeps. I even had a few
messages from potential wealthy
"sugar daddies," which I, of course,
considered (but alas, I decided to get a
real job). Some I met for coffee, some
I met for drinks, and these awkward
first get-togethers often resembled the
first real date with someone you met
while drunk at a party: slightly forced
as you try to avoid awkward silences
while subdy analyzing if they were
really as hot as that one photo they
posted from high school.
Was it weird to meet people
from online; did I ever feel in danger?

Sure, it was kind of awkward at first,
but I followed all of the safety rules:
met them in a neutral public place,
didn't consider going home with
them until after a few dates. I never
felt in danger. When I received a
creepy message at 2 a.m. from a pro
file saying something like, "hey hottie
wachu up 2 2nite?" it was easy to
ignore it and block said creeper from
contacting me again. But what hap
pens when you are looking for these
2 a.m. booty calls?
In comes Grindr, marketed as a
smartphone app, predominandy for
gay, bisexual and curious men. Grindr
describes itself as "quick, convenient,
and discreet. And it's as anonymous as
you want it to be. Grindr is a simple
app that uses your mobile device's

location-based services to show you
the guys closest to you who are also
on Grindr." On Grindr, you can skip
the small talk, find a guy close by and
meet him somewhere for sex.
How is an application like
Grindr different from online dating?
Intermission interviewed a few differ
ent men about their experiences with
Grindr.
Intermission (INT):Howdidyou
find out about Grindr?
Student 1:1 got an iPhone, and
all I had to do was type in "gay" into
the app store and then Grindr came
up. So I downloaded Grindr, and it
was just a giant list of guys. I [actual
ly] found my first boyfriend on
Grindr senior year. I had a secret rela

tionship [with him] for two months.
INT:Why do you or did you use
Grindr?
Student 1:1 started using it in
the first place just to meet people, not
necessarily sexually, but just to have
someone to talk to [because] I had
never had that before. The majority of
guys on Grindr are there for quick
hookups, but I am on Grindr to try to
meet some decent people to hang out
with. There are definitely less of those
people on [Grindr], though. It's away
for other gay people to find each
other.
Student 2:1 joined because I
didn't know how to meet other [gay]
people. If you want to get laid, it's
easy. It's as easy as texting somebody. I

am always using a
condom and always being safe, but I
had some definite health scares
because of it. [Grindr really showed
me] an image of the underside of the
gay community.
INT:Can you tell us a little about
your experiences with Grindr? Best
and worst experiences?
Student 1: My best experience
was finding my first boyfriend on
[Grindr]. I never had sex with anyone
on Grindr when I was in high school.
It was always just oral or playful sex
experiences. But sometimes it would
get really sketchy; they would want
