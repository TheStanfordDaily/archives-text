# VIRTUAL HOOK-UP
## Stanford students talk Grindr and germs 
### 
In this age of technology, meeting
people can be as easy as the click
of a button. Recently, after a
breakup, I joined an online dating site
for fun. I met a few awesome people
and a few creeps. I even had a few
messages from potential wealthy
"sugar daddies," which I, of course,
considered (but alas, I decided to get a
real job). Some I met for coffee, some
I met for drinks, and these awkward
first get-togethers often resembled the
first real date with someone you met
while drunk at a party: slightly forced
as you try to avoid awkward silences
while subdy analyzing if they were
really as hot as that one photo they
posted from high school.
Was it weird to meet people
from online; did I ever feel in danger?

Sure, it was kind of awkward at first,
but I followed all of the safety rules:
met them in a neutral public place,
didn't consider going home with
them until after a few dates. I never
felt in danger. When I received a
creepy message at 2 a.m. from a pro
file saying something like, "hey hottie
wachu up 2 2nite?" it was easy to
ignore it and block said creeper from
contacting me again. But what hap
pens when you are looking for these
2 a.m. booty calls?
In comes Grindr, marketed as a
smartphone app, predominandy for
gay, bisexual and curious men. Grindr
describes itself as "quick, convenient,
and discreet. And it's as anonymous as
you want it to be. Grindr is a simple
app that uses your mobile device's

location-based services to show you
the guys closest to you who are also
on Grindr." On Grindr, you can skip
the small talk, find a guy close by and
meet him somewhere for sex.
How is an application like
Grindr different from online dating?
Intermission interviewed a few differ
ent men about their experiences with
Grindr.
Intermission (INT):Howdidyou
find out about Grindr?
Student 1:1 got an iPhone, and
all I had to do was type in "gay" into
the app store and then Grindr came
up. So I downloaded Grindr, and it
was just a giant list of guys. I [actual
ly] found my first boyfriend on
Grindr senior year. I had a secret rela

tionship [with him] for two months.
INT:Why do you or did you use
Grindr?
Student 1:1 started using it in
the first place just to meet people, not
necessarily sexually, but just to have
someone to talk to [because] I had
never had that before. The majority of
guys on Grindr are there for quick
hookups, but I am on Grindr to try to
meet some decent people to hang out
with. There are definitely less of those
people on [Grindr], though. It's away
for other gay people to find each
other.
Student 2:1 joined because I
didn't know how to meet other [gay]
people. If you want to get laid, it's
easy. It's as easy as texting somebody. I

am always using a
condom and always being safe, but I
had some definite health scares
because of it. [Grindr really showed
me] an image of the underside of the
gay community.
INT:Can you tell us a little about
your experiences with Grindr? Best
and worst experiences?
Student 1: My best experience
was finding my first boyfriend on
[Grindr]. I never had sex with anyone
on Grindr when I was in high school.
It was always just oral or playful sex
experiences. But sometimes it would
get really sketchy; they would want

more from you. It was always really
dangerous, though; you are meeting
up with a stranger, and you are
[often] lying about your age. I was 17
at the time. I started being afraid of
seeing these people in public. There
was that feeling of being with my

family and seeing someone I had been
with secretly, but I just shoved these
feelings under the rug.
INT:How is something like a Grindr
meet-up different than meeting a ran
dom person at a bar and going home
with them?
Student 1: On Grindr, there is a
natural understanding for guys on
the site that if you say "hi" to them,
you are attracted to them because
you can see their picture. A quick
conversation will usually consist of,
"Hi. Stats? What are you into (sexual

ly)? And where are you let's meet
up?"
It's so much easier to do. You can
just go online. You can do it in five to
10 messages back and forth. It has
made everyone more superficial.
INT:What is it like when you go to
meet up with someone on Grindr?
What kind of places do you meet at,
and how do you decide who plays
what role sexually?
Student 1:1 haven't met up
with a lot of people, maybe like two
or three. It took a long, committed

relationship for me to trust someone
enough to have the experience of
being a bottom ... The weirdest place
I ever met up with someone [from
Grindr] was a church parking lot.
INT: Do you have any advice for peo
ple who want to start using Grindr?
Student 1:1 think Grindr is
not talked about, ever. If someone is
coming out, there are probably so
many kids out there like I was who
don't have anyone to talk to. And they
find Grindr and experiment with
guys from a hook-up app. It is not a
good way to come out. I can see that
happening to thousands of kids
around the country. Honestly, now I
think Grindr is a modern-day vector
for HIV. A lot of people are not even
protective on it.
Student 2:1 think it's fine to be
sex positive and want to have casual
sex if you are interested in it, but you
need to know what you are getting
yourself into. Any of those men could
have given me HIV or killed me; I
had some great times, but it wasn't

worth it. It was profoundly
unhealthy. I think [Grindr] could be
used as away to meet people, but you
have to know what you are getting
into, fust because you are using a
condom every time doesn't mean you
are protecting yourself in all circum
stances.
For the people that I spoke with,
Grindr seems to be, for some, an
introductory outlet for young, gay
men to experiment with other men
for the first time. But what if you
don't know what you like yet? It
would be safer, it seems, both physi
cally and emotionally, if there were
more easily searchable resources out
there where you could talk to some
one first before looking for answers
by having sex with random people. If
you do want to be having sex with
random partners, make sure you real
ly consider if the possible negative
outcomes are worth a short-lived
good time.

It was always just oral or playful sex
experiences. But sometimes it would
get really sketchy; they would want

more from you. It was always really
dangerous, though; you are meeting
up with a stranger, and you are
[often] lying about your age. I was 17
at the time. I started being afraid of
seeing these people in public. There
was that feeling of being with my

family and seeing someone I had been
with secretly, but I just shoved these
feelings under the rug.
INT:How is something like a Grindr
meet-up different than meeting a ran
dom person at a bar and going home
with them?
Student 1: On Grindr, there is a
natural understanding for guys on
the site that if you say "hi" to them,
you are attracted to them because
you can see their picture. A quick
conversation will usually consist of,
"Hi. Stats? What are you into (sexual

ly)? And where are you let's meet
up?"
It's so much easier to do. You can
just go online. You can do it in five to
10 messages back and forth. It has
made everyone more superficial.
INT:What is it like when you go to
meet up with someone on Grindr?
What kind of places do you meet at,
and how do you decide who plays
what role sexually?
Student 1:1 haven't met up
with a lot of people, maybe like two
or three. It took a long, committed

relationship for me to trust someone
enough to have the experience of
being a bottom ... The weirdest place
I ever met up with someone [from
Grindr] was a church parking lot.
INT: Do you have any advice for peo
ple who want to start using Grindr?
Student 1:1 think Grindr is
not talked about, ever. If someone is
coming out, there are probably so
many kids out there like I was who
don't have anyone to talk to. And they
find Grindr and experiment with
guys from a hook-up app. It is not a
good way to come out. I can see that
happening to thousands of kids
around the country. Honestly, now I
think Grindr is a modern-day vector
for HIV. A lot of people are not even
protective on it.
Student 2:1 think it's fine to be
sex positive and want to have casual
sex if you are interested in it, but you
need to know what you are getting
yourself into. Any of those men could
have given me HIV or killed me; I
had some great times, but it wasn't

worth it. It was profoundly
unhealthy. I think [Grindr] could be
used as away to meet people, but you
have to know what you are getting
into, fust because you are using a
condom every time doesn't mean you
are protecting yourself in all circum
stances.
For the people that I spoke with,
Grindr seems to be, for some, an
introductory outlet for young, gay
men to experiment with other men
for the first time. But what if you
don't know what you like yet? It
would be safer, it seems, both physi
cally and emotionally, if there were
more easily searchable resources out
there where you could talk to some
one first before looking for answers
by having sex with random people. If
you do want to be having sex with
random partners, make sure you real
ly consider if the possible negative
outcomes are worth a short-lived
good time.
In this age of technology, meeting
people can be as easy as the click
of a button. Recently, after a
breakup, I joined an online dating site
for fun. I met a few awesome people
and a few creeps. I even had a few
messages from potential wealthy
"sugar daddies," which I, of course,
considered (but alas, I decided to get a
real job). Some I met for coffee, some
I met for drinks, and these awkward
first get-togethers often resembled the
first real date with someone you met
while drunk at a party: slightly forced
as you try to avoid awkward silences
while subdy analyzing if they were
really as hot as that one photo they
posted from high school.
Was it weird to meet people
from online; did I ever feel in danger?

Sure, it was kind of awkward at first,
but I followed all of the safety rules:
met them in a neutral public place,
didn't consider going home with
them until after a few dates. I never
felt in danger. When I received a
creepy message at 2 a.m. from a pro
file saying something like, "hey hottie
wachu up 2 2nite?" it was easy to
ignore it and block said creeper from
contacting me again. But what hap
pens when you are looking for these
2 a.m. booty calls?
In comes Grindr, marketed as a
smartphone app, predominandy for
gay, bisexual and curious men. Grindr
describes itself as "quick, convenient,
and discreet. And it's as anonymous as
you want it to be. Grindr is a simple
app that uses your mobile device's

location-based services to show you
the guys closest to you who are also
on Grindr." On Grindr, you can skip
the small talk, find a guy close by and
meet him somewhere for sex.
How is an application like
Grindr different from online dating?
Intermission interviewed a few differ
ent men about their experiences with
Grindr.
Intermission (INT):Howdidyou
find out about Grindr?
Student 1:1 got an iPhone, and
all I had to do was type in "gay" into
the app store and then Grindr came
up. So I downloaded Grindr, and it
was just a giant list of guys. I [actual
ly] found my first boyfriend on
Grindr senior year. I had a secret rela

tionship [with him] for two months.
INT:Why do you or did you use
Grindr?
Student 1:1 started using it in
the first place just to meet people, not
necessarily sexually, but just to have
someone to talk to [because] I had
never had that before. The majority of
guys on Grindr are there for quick
hookups, but I am on Grindr to try to
meet some decent people to hang out
with. There are definitely less of those
people on [Grindr], though. It's away
for other gay people to find each
other.
Student 2:1 joined because I
didn't know how to meet other [gay]
people. If you want to get laid, it's
easy. It's as easy as texting somebody. I

am always using a
condom and always being safe, but I
had some definite health scares
because of it. [Grindr really showed
me] an image of the underside of the
gay community.
INT:Can you tell us a little about
your experiences with Grindr? Best
and worst experiences?
Student 1: My best experience
was finding my first boyfriend on
[Grindr]. I never had sex with anyone
on Grindr when I was in high school.
