## WARM BODIES Zombie movie takes on the rom-com genre with a few stumbles along the way 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
cc -W" a yarm Bodies" is the latest, and
% /\ / emotionally, the best film in
T J the recent trend, starting with
"Shaun of the Dead," to revive the zombie film
for comedic and even rom-com effect.
"Zombieland" is its closest predecessor, a film
more interested in the eccentricities of the
humans battling the zombies including a
couple of kick-ass sisters who excel at scheming
than the zombie battles themselves.
And as all zombie movies must, both
ended in a predictable and relatively mundane
showdown between the humans and the zom
bies. Whereas vampire stories offer the opportu
nity to explore sexual dynamics, power dynam

ics and even Peter Pan syndrome, zombie films
necessarily force conventions and limit story
telling, as zombies, by definition, are brainless,
brain-eating drudges who must inevitably be
exterminated.
"Warm Bodies" shakes the genre up a bit
by making a zombie, R (Nicholas Hoult), the
main character and successfully gets us to sym
pathize with his plight: He's a lonely teenager.
Near the beginning he asks in voice-over, "Why
can't I connect with people? Oh right, I'm dead."
This kind of wry humor is R's trademark, and it
permeates his voiceovers, delivered with perfect
deadpan and comic timing by Hoult. The film is
at its smartest and liveliest in these voiceovers;

it's what makes us root for R even when his
behavior is questionable.
R spends his days ambling around an
abandoned airport, now only inhabited by zom
bies, contemplating his existence and conflicted
about his competing desires to both connect
with people and to eat their brains. Occasionally,
he and his zombie friends, including M (Rob
Corddry), venture out into no man's land, in
search of a brain to nibble on, which is where he
encounters Julie (Teresa Palmer).
After devouring her boyfriend's brain a
process during which the victim's memories are
transferred to the zombie, reinvigorating the
zombie's humanity— R decides to spare Julie's
brain and save her life, bringing her back to his
lair to stay in the process. The goal, of course, is
to get her to like him. Of course, he had no idea
that falling for her could be the cure to make
him un-undead.
The trouble is that R is barely able to artic
ulate a grunt out loud, let alone a sentence,
which makes his tentative courtship with Julie
limited. Their relationship is still heartwarming
and often funny— more a tribute to the actors,
playing out recognizable insecurities, than the
screenplay —but it also has the tendency to fall
into predictable cliche, and in this case it's not
only zombie cliche, but also rom-com cliche. Yet
the film is still fresh, especially in the first half
when the characters are front and center, and R's

voiceover guides the narrative.
The film was adapted by the director,
Jonathan Levine, from Isaac Marion's novel of
the same title, a first-person narrative which
allowed the reader to revel in R's wonderful
inner monologue constantly; however, we only
get glimpses. On screen, we have to watch the
actual grunting between lines.
British actor Hoult is the film's greatest
asset; He's charismatic, conflicted and com
pelling even as he slouches and saunters and
grunts out words. Hoult first came onto the film
scene as an awkward kid in "About a Boy," often
stealing scenes, but since Britain's "Skins," he has
grown into quite the heartthrob even in zom
bie makeup with wonderful screen presence.
Perhaps "Warm Bodies" will be the necessary
launch-point for his career as a leading man and
star in the United States.
