# ResEd ends Suites clubs
## Administration to replace student-run societies with outside vendors 
### MILES UNTERREINER MANAGING EDITOR 
Residential Education officials have decided to
move forward with their plan to contract operations of
Suites Dining to an outside vendor, effective next fall.
The move will replace the student-run nonprofit Gov
ernor's Corner Dining Societies for the first time since
Suites Dining opened in 1982.
Citing "years of mismanagement" and an inability
to "stay in good standing to meet the food needs" of
Suites residents, Dean of Residential Education Debo
rah Golder argued that the goal of transitioning to an
outside contractor is to "protect that community and
what that community thinks is important."
ResEd has yet to begin the bidding process to
select a new vendor. Officials say a "university
required process" will govern the selection of the ven
dor, with at least three or four vendors invited to bid
for the contract to operate dining services at Suites.
The current chefs' contracts are set to expire at the
conclusion of this academic year, and they will be
unable to reapply to work for the new vendor until the
vendor selection process is complete.
Current students in Suites expressed discontent
with the planned transition.
"I think it runs perfectly fine the way it is now," said
Elizabeth Stier 'l4, who added that, compared to oth
er dining options on campus, "the food is awesome ...
the quality is far superior."
Another Suites resident expressed frustration at
the loss of student leadership, saying that the student
run dining gives residents a sense of responsibility.
Discussions about the role of students with regard
to the new vendor arrangement are currently ongoing.
