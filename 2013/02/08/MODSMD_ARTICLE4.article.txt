## SPoM provides safe space Student group seeks to create open dialogue about mental health

Drug and alcohol abuse. Anxiety. Depres
sion. Suicide.
For the members of Stanford Peace of Mind
(SPoM), these are important societal issues, yet
not much is said about them on Stanford's cam
pus.
SPoM co-president Nikita Desai 'l5 said she
wants to get the information out about mental
illness on campus in order to combat the stigma
attached to mental health issues.
"We see stuff on campus about wellness and
happiness, but we don't see stuff about not being

well," Desai said.
"SPoM is advocating for a greater dialogue
and discussion about mental health," she added.
"We want to combat the notion that everyone
has to be perfect at Stanford. We are trying to
open people up to being more vulnerable."
Desai and Tara Hasan 'l3 are co-presidents
of SPoM, which meets every week at the Bridge
Peer Counseling Center. Hasan joined during
her freshmen year after seeing a SPoM panel in
her freshmen dorm, Cedro.
"I grew up in the Middle East, where every
thing stays in the family and you don't share
your feelings with people outside the family,"
Hasan said. "I had trouble adjusting to Stanford.
I felt like everyone around me was doing so well,
and I wasn't enjoying myself. I know now that it
was the duck syndrome, but at the time I could

n't put my finger on it."
Desai's involvement with mental health
began when she was in middle school. She got
involved with awareness for obsessive-compul
sive disorder, especially for kids. Being a part of


LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
SPoM, in her opinion, was just con
tinuing that work in her college
years.
Getting people involved at Stan
ford, however, hasn't been easy.
"Recruitment is most difficult,"
Hasan said. "People are interested in
being involved, but they don't stick it
out."
This year, SPoM has increased
the number of student panels they
put on and held faculty lunches in
which professors talk to students
about mental health.
"The panels are the core of what
we're trying to do," Desai added.
"Mental well-being is not universal,
and hearing stories of other stu
dents, in an open, safe space, some
times sharing with their own dorm,
can help de-stigmatize the issues."
At a SPoM panel on Wednesday
night, three students spoke about
then' experience dealing with mental
illness.
Danny McKay 'l4 shared his sto
ry of dealing with alcohol and drug
abuse.
"When I was 13 or 14,1 started
using drugs heavily," he said. "I did
n't participate in high school... I
don't really remember much of that
time."
After graduating from high
school, Danny joined the Air Force,
where his addiction continued.
"I slowed down because they
would do random drug testing, but I
could still go to Rite-Aid or wherever
and steal stuff to make into drugs or
use as a drug," he said.
Danny tried committing suicide
once and served time in jail for a
DUI. He received some treatment
while in the Air Force, but after leav
ing, he stopped.
"I grew up in a trashy part of
town... like a big playground for
thugs," he said. "I thought I was des
tined for that kind of life... I never
saw myself where I am now. I hon
estly thought I was going to end up
dead in a ditch, and I accepted it.
That's what scared me. That's what
made me want to get sober."
Grace 'l4, who requested that
only her first name be printed, grew
up in Tennessee, where she was the

perfect child, doing well academical
ly and as a violinist.
"I was used to berating myself
and being hard on myself, and it was
reinforced because I had success,"
Grace said. "It worked in high school,
and then I came to Stanford. At the
end of my [freshman year] winter
quarter, I started questioning myself
... I got to my dream school, but what
do I actually want to do?"
She describes the physical reac
tions she experienced due to her
stress.
"I started getting worried about
things," she said. "I couldn't shut it
off. I couldn't stop worrying. I was
always tense, always scared...
Adrenaline coursing through my
body."
Grace tried to reach out to her
parents, but her mom didn't know
what to say and her dad began ques
tioning her abilities.
"He would say, 'I thought you
were strong. What's wrong with
you? You're bringing this dark cloud
to our family. You just need to suck it
up.' But denying it just made the
feelings worse," she said.
Grace pledged Alpha Kappa Psi,
Stanford's business-interest frater
nity, in the spring of her freshmen
year and broke down under what she
thought was psychological hazing.
"I de-pledged and got a lot of flak
from my dad," Grace said. "I felt
really terrible, like I failed, like I
wasn't good enough... I was so good
in high school, so proud and success
ful, and all of a sudden it wasn't
working anymore."
She took the rest of the year off
and returned for her sophomore
year, but the problems hadn't gone
away.
"Spring break, I start crying
again. It freaked me out, like, 'why is
this happening again?"' Grace said.
"I just pushed it down, tried to
ignore it... I ended up in the Stan
ford ER and was admitted to the
psychiatric ward. I was transferred
to an outpatient program back
home, where I started making
changes."
With professional guidance, she
stopped tying her self-worth to
things that were out of her control.
When she returned this year as a
junior, she felt a lot stronger.
"I believe that self-worth is
inherent," Grace said. "I say nice
things to myself now."

Partially for herself, but also so
that others struggling with mental
illness do not have to suffer the same
silence she did, Grace has told her
story at two panels.
"The first was terrifying," she
said. "The second was terrifying too,
because it was my own dorm. Each
time I say my story, it feels reward
ing because I can share this part of
my life with other people, multiple
people at once ... I'm grateful to have
that space to do it."
Analyssa Lopez 'l6 also enjoyed
extensive personal success as a
child, but first struggled when she
realized how academically challeng
ing the International Baccalaureate
(IB) program was at her high school.
"It was a huge shock, like jump
ing into ice-cold water," Lopez said.
"I never had to work to get good
grades or to understand the materi
al ... I was completely out of my ele
ment."
She started being bullied and
withdrew into lonely depression.
"I started not going to school,
not wanting to see anyone," she said.
"I couldn't tell my mom that I can
not stand the idea of going to school
or getting out of bed."
She attempted suicide and ended
up in an adolescent behavioral
health center. While she still some
times struggles with the pressure
that comes with being a Stanford
student, she credits SPoM with help
ing her adjust.
"Here, I can tell strangers what
happened to me, and I think it's
most helpful because it makes me
feel like there's some sort of outlet,"
Lopez added. "It makes it easier to
admit to myself that [mental health]
is something I'm struggling with."
SPoM aims to eliminate the
"duck syndrome" and allow discus
sion of vulnerability so often swept
under the rug by schedules and
responsibilities. But according to
Desai, it's the responsibility of stu
dents, not the University, to make
the change they want to see on men
tal health stigma.
"Students create the culture on
campus," Desai said. "We can fight
the duck syndrome by talking about
it... It's tempting to point the blame
at the University, but students
silence themselves."

grades or to understand the materi
al ... I was completely out of my ele
ment."
She started being bullied and
withdrew into lonely depression.
"I started not going to school,
not wanting to see anyone," she said.
"I couldn't tell my mom that I can
not stand the idea of going to school
or getting out of bed."
She attempted suicide and ended
up in an adolescent behavioral
health center. While she still some
times struggles with the pressure
that comes with being a Stanford
student, she credits SPoM with help
ing her adjust.
"Here, I can tell strangers what
happened to me, and I think it's
most helpful because it makes me
feel like there's some sort of outlet,"
Lopez added. "It makes it easier to
admit to myself that [mental health]
is something I'm struggling with."
SPoM aims to eliminate the
"duck syndrome" and allow discus
sion of vulnerability so often swept
under the rug by schedules and
responsibilities. But according to
Desai, it's the responsibility of stu
dents, not the University, to make
the change they want to see on men
tal health stigma.
"Students create the culture on
campus," Desai said. "We can fight
the duck syndrome by talking about
it... It's tempting to point the blame
at the University, but students

Drug and alcohol abuse. Anxiety. Depres
sion. Suicide.
For the members of Stanford Peace of Mind
(SPoM), these are important societal issues, yet
not much is said about them on Stanford's cam
pus.
SPoM co-president Nikita Desai 'l5 said she
wants to get the information out about mental
illness on campus in order to combat the stigma
attached to mental health issues.
"We see stuff on campus about wellness and
happiness, but we don't see stuff about not being

well," Desai said.
"SPoM is advocating for a greater dialogue
and discussion about mental health," she added.
"We want to combat the notion that everyone
has to be perfect at Stanford. We are trying to
open people up to being more vulnerable."
Desai and Tara Hasan 'l3 are co-presidents
of SPoM, which meets every week at the Bridge
Peer Counseling Center. Hasan joined during
her freshmen year after seeing a SPoM panel in
her freshmen dorm, Cedro.
"I grew up in the Middle East, where every
thing stays in the family and you don't share
your feelings with people outside the family,"
Hasan said. "I had trouble adjusting to Stanford.
I felt like everyone around me was doing so well,
and I wasn't enjoying myself. I know now that it
was the duck syndrome, but at the time I could

n't put my finger on it."
Desai's involvement with mental health
began when she was in middle school. She got
involved with awareness for obsessive-compul
sive disorder, especially for kids. Being a part of


LORENA RINCON-CRUZ/The Stanford Daily
SPoM, in her opinion, was just con
tinuing that work in her college
years.
Getting people involved at Stan
ford, however, hasn't been easy.
"Recruitment is most difficult,"
Hasan said. "People are interested in
being involved, but they don't stick it
out."
This year, SPoM has increased
the number of student panels they
put on and held faculty lunches in
which professors talk to students
about mental health.
"The panels are the core of what
we're trying to do," Desai added.
"Mental well-being is not universal,
and hearing stories of other stu
dents, in an open, safe space, some
times sharing with their own dorm,
can help de-stigmatize the issues."
At a SPoM panel on Wednesday
night, three students spoke about
then' experience dealing with mental
illness.
Danny McKay 'l4 shared his sto
ry of dealing with alcohol and drug
abuse.
"When I was 13 or 14,1 started
using drugs heavily," he said. "I did
n't participate in high school... I
don't really remember much of that
time."
After graduating from high
school, Danny joined the Air Force,
where his addiction continued.
"I slowed down because they
would do random drug testing, but I
could still go to Rite-Aid or wherever
and steal stuff to make into drugs or
use as a drug," he said.
Danny tried committing suicide
once and served time in jail for a
DUI. He received some treatment
while in the Air Force, but after leav
ing, he stopped.
"I grew up in a trashy part of
town... like a big playground for
thugs," he said. "I thought I was des
tined for that kind of life... I never
saw myself where I am now. I hon
estly thought I was going to end up
dead in a ditch, and I accepted it.
That's what scared me. That's what
made me want to get sober."
Grace 'l4, who requested that
only her first name be printed, grew
up in Tennessee, where she was the

perfect child, doing well academical
ly and as a violinist.
"I was used to berating myself
and being hard on myself, and it was
reinforced because I had success,"
Grace said. "It worked in high school,
and then I came to Stanford. At the
end of my [freshman year] winter
quarter, I started questioning myself
... I got to my dream school, but what
do I actually want to do?"
She describes the physical reac
tions she experienced due to her
stress.
"I started getting worried about
things," she said. "I couldn't shut it
off. I couldn't stop worrying. I was
always tense, always scared...
Adrenaline coursing through my
body."
Grace tried to reach out to her
parents, but her mom didn't know
what to say and her dad began ques
tioning her abilities.
"He would say, 'I thought you
were strong. What's wrong with
you? You're bringing this dark cloud
to our family. You just need to suck it
up.' But denying it just made the
feelings worse," she said.
Grace pledged Alpha Kappa Psi,
Stanford's business-interest frater
nity, in the spring of her freshmen
year and broke down under what she
thought was psychological hazing.
"I de-pledged and got a lot of flak
from my dad," Grace said. "I felt
really terrible, like I failed, like I
wasn't good enough... I was so good
in high school, so proud and success
ful, and all of a sudden it wasn't
working anymore."
She took the rest of the year off
and returned for her sophomore
year, but the problems hadn't gone
away.
"Spring break, I start crying
again. It freaked me out, like, 'why is
this happening again?"' Grace said.
"I just pushed it down, tried to
ignore it... I ended up in the Stan
ford ER and was admitted to the
psychiatric ward. I was transferred
to an outpatient program back
home, where I started making
changes."
With professional guidance, she
stopped tying her self-worth to
things that were out of her control.
When she returned this year as a
junior, she felt a lot stronger.
"I believe that self-worth is
inherent," Grace said. "I say nice
things to myself now."

Partially for herself, but also so
that others struggling with mental
illness do not have to suffer the same
silence she did, Grace has told her
story at two panels.
"The first was terrifying," she
said. "The second was terrifying too,
because it was my own dorm. Each
time I say my story, it feels reward
ing because I can share this part of
my life with other people, multiple
people at once ... I'm grateful to have
that space to do it."
Analyssa Lopez 'l6 also enjoyed
extensive personal success as a
child, but first struggled when she
realized how academically challeng
ing the International Baccalaureate
(IB) program was at her high school.
"It was a huge shock, like jump
ing into ice-cold water," Lopez said.
"I never had to work to get good
grades or to understand the materi
al ... I was completely out of my ele
ment."
She started being bullied and
withdrew into lonely depression.
"I started not going to school,
not wanting to see anyone," she said.
"I couldn't tell my mom that I can
not stand the idea of going to school
or getting out of bed."
