## Immigration reform close, say faculty 
### SABELLE SMYTHE 
President Barack Obama's second-term
push to overhaul the United States' immigration
system may be uniquely feasible in the after
math of the 2012 presidential election, according
to Stanford political observers.
"[Republicans] know they can't let this issue
be something that continues to keep the Latino
electorate from possibly considering the GOP as
their party of choice," said Albert Camarillo,
professor of history. "They've softened their
view already. How far they will be hard-liners on
certain things, I don't know."
Over 70 percent of the growing Latino elec
torate voted for Obama last year, in what has
commonly been identified as a swing factor. In
late January, Obama expressed support for a
plan put forward by a bipartisan group of sena
tors that would among other aspects allow
skilled workers to remain in the United States
after college instead of returning to their native
countries.
With an enduring shortage of qualified work
ers in the fields of science, technology, engineer
ing and mathematics, companies like Microsoft
have been lobbying for more
green cards for foreign hires
who could fill these positions.
Comprehensive immigration
legislation could consequen
tially have a substantial
impact on the third of Stan
ford graduate students who
are international.
"For a lot of those people,
coming and getting a Ph.D. or
a master's degree may mean
more than taking those skills

and degrees and going back to
their home country," said
Tomas Jimenez, an assistant
professor of sociology. "It may
mean actually applying some
of those skills here, which
would be obviously beneficial
for those individuals but also
[would be] beneficial to the
United States and essentially
beneficial to Stanford."
Some students are also
hopeful that the proposed
reform could increase oppor
tunities for the Stanford
immigrant community as a
whole.
"There are a lot of issues
that need to be addressed in

order for students to be able
to graduate college and, even
after, to be able to work in the
labor force," said Erica Fer
nandez 'l2 M.A. 'l3.
Fernandez, whose family
emigrated from Mexico to
Oxnard, Calif., when she was
10 years old, argued that it
was important to create
opportunities so that talented
students could remain in the
United States.
"Already we have people
who are international that
study here, who do the jobs
that other students cannot do
because they don't have the
opportunities," she said. "So

they are bringing the talent
here. But I think we also have
to address the issue that
there's a lot of talent without
opportunity, so we need to
make those opportunities."
Comprehensive immigra
tion reform will also likely
address other aspects of the
current policy like better
enforcing current immigra
tion laws and creating a path
to citizenship for the more
than 11 million undocumented
immigrants currently in the
country that are likely to
be politically contentious.
For example, some Repub
licans have argued for the cer
tification of a secure border as

a prerequisite for immigration
reform and argued against
the granting of "amnesty" for
undocumented immigrants.
To date, neither side has
shown much willingness to
compromise on such issues.
However, Jimenez remained
optimistic about the prospect
for legislative change.
"I'm more hopeful than I
ever have been that the politi
cal climate is such that some
thing can get done," Jimenez
said.
