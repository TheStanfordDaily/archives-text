## Focus groups examine course evals 
### DANNY GIFFORD DESK EDITOR 
A faculty committee aimed at reforming
Stanford's course evaluation system held six
focus groups with undergraduate students
from Jan. 29 to Feb. 5 in an effort to solicit
student feedback on a process that, according
to committee chair Russell Berman, "leaves
much to be desired."
Berman said that the impetus for the com
mittee, which was created in fall quarter in

response to the suggestions of the Study of
Undergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES), came from "widespread dissatisfac
tion with the status quo."
"The faculty don't believe that it gives
them sufficient information about the success
of their courses, and students indicate, as
well, a kind of unhappiness with the form," he
said.
In order to pinpoint the failures in the cur-
rent system, members of the
committee led 14-student
focus groups that discussed
the evaluation system's
strengths and weaknesses
for 90 minutes.
Committee member and
professor of political science
Jon Krosnick, whose aca
demic work has focused on
survey methodology and
questionnaire design, noted
the difficulty of moderating
the discussion considering
students' lack of experience
in designing such surveys.
"It might be tempting to
ask the people who fill out a
questionnaire how would they
like for it to be designed, but
if they don't know... how to
design a questionnaire well,
then they're operating at a
bit of a disadvantage," he
said. "It's like saying, you
know, you'd like your open
heart surgery to be done suc
cessfully, but you have no idea
how to do it successfully."
Still, Krosnick said he
noticed several factors that
could help explain why stu
dents don't put thought into
their responses or, in many
cases, don't fill out their
evaluations at all. The prob

lem, he said, is twofold: the
survey is poorly designed,
and students are unaware of
its importance.
Berman agreed that the
evaluation, as it is now, isn't
asking the right questions.
"In addition to there
being way too many and
probably redundant ques
tions, my sense is that the
current form is focused too
much on an evaluation of the
teacher, rather than an eval
uation of the learning envi
ronment," he said. "The
form really doesn't ask the
student much about how he
or she has learned, whether
he or she has taken on
responsibility to make it a
productive learning experi
ence."
Currently the adminis
tration uses the course eval
uation results for several
purposes, including tenure
considerations, salary raises,
promotions and awards. All
of these purposes are listed
at the top of the evaluation,
but Krosnick said that many
students find it unnecessary
to read the fine print.
"It's been in front of peo
ple all along, but people
don't often read instructions
at the top of a questionnaire
when they feel that they can
just get started answering
the questions," he said.
Krosnick added that if

students were made more
aware of the evaluation's
importance, they might be
more attentive and engaged
when filling it out.
"Students don't under
stand, necessarily, this very
significant impact that their
evaluations have," he said.
"Once they realize that, as
we found in these groups,
people thought, 'Oh, gee,
well maybe I really should
be filling these things out.'"
Berman said that the
committee hopes to agree on
prospective changes soon so
that it can begin field testing
new versions in the spring
and finalize its recommenda
tions over the summer. He
said his end goal is to create
a new, effective evaluation
system, one that is beneficial
not just to professors, but to
students as well.
"We really want to turn
this around and see this as a
way to give faculty better
input as to how their course
is succeeding and how it
might succeed better," he
said. "We also want to see
filling out the form as a
learning moment for the stu
dent, inviting students to
think about how the quarter
has gone for them and what
they've put into it.
