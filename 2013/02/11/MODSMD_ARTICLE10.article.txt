# Sports, Steroids and Santa Claus

I have been a sports fan long
enough to expect sucker
punches. After my beloved
Patriots lost their undefeated
season to the upstart New
York Giants back in 2007,1 thought I
had experienced it all: the sheer, dev
astating, unbelievable pain of loss
that all sports fans go through on a
masochistically regular basis; just ask
Cleveland sports fans how they feel
and why they keep coming back.
Shockingly, I was dead wrong.
Over the last six years, I've realized
that there is only one thing worse
than having your teams lose: realiz
ing that the game itself has been com
promised.
What happens when you can no
longer believe in anything? What are
you supposed to do when everything
that you hold to be true turns out to
be unequivocally false? In essence,
that is what has slowly happened to
my faith in sports. The erosion has
finally worn me down to nothing.
You're all probably snorting with
laughter at my naivete. Why bother
to trust anything, you ask. Why even
pretend to accept anything at face
value, when all sports have done over
the last few years is to push crap onto
your plate?
Call me an idealist, a dreamer, a
moron, whatever you like. I want to
believe that what we see in sports is
the purest form of competition. I
want to believe that an athletic com
petition is a fair fight between two
equally prepared parties, and the vic
tory goes to whomsoever performs
better. More than anything, I want to
believe that these parties respect the
integrity of the game and aren't doing
anything to harm that.
But the sad truth is that in today's
world, nothing is sacred. I guess the
scandals began in baseball's steroid
era, when everyone and their cousin
were juicing. In retrospect, seeing
skinny players suddenly pack on
enormous muscle and start cracking
over 60 home runs on a regular basis
was probably a dead giveaway. Just
take a look at any statistic, any
record, and chances are that it was
set in the 1990s and early 2000s, prob
ably by someone who has been at
least peripherally implicated in some
form of steroid abuse. At this point, I
was devastated, but I thought other
sports couldn't be this morally bank
rapt ...
Then came the NBAs referee bet
ting scandal, led by the infamous Tim
Donaghy and his notoriously quick
whistle. For reasons that remain
unexplained today we never really
learned how deep the rabbit hole
really went. The NBA merely canned
all the zebras who were implicated
and pretended like the whole incident
never happened. The only loose can
non that remains is Donaghy who
continues to preach that he single
handedly influenced the outcome of
hundreds of games.
The NBA, meanwhile, preaches
that Donaghy did nothing of the sort
and is delusional. If this doesn't make
you suspicious, please go and watch
the highlights of the 2006 NBA finals,
where Dwayne Wade proceeds to
take more free throws in one game
than the entirety of the Dallas Maver
icks organization. Heck, his total free
throw count may have been more
than Mark Cuban's commissioner
levied fine count afterwards.
I remain convinced that David
Stern's hate for Mark Cuban was so
great that he convinced the refs to
gift wrap the series and hand it over
on a silver pupu platter to the Miami
Heat. And you know what? You can't
even logically disagree with me. One
bad egg generally begets another,
and we truly don't know how many
crooked referees remain employed
by the NBA today.
I'm not even sure what to think of
the NFL anymore, as the drug-test
ing policy seems to be stuck in
reverse gear 99 percent of the time.
The Players Association refuses to
allow testing, claiming a violation of
privacy. Little of me wonders what
they have to hide. The league's drag
policy has so many loopholes that the
IRS looks at it and laughs. I cringe
whenever I see the headline, "Player
X's suspension revoked." And this
doesn't even mention the fact that the
league fails to test for HGH and
recently suffered a PR nightmare
when "deer antler spray" made
rounds through the Internet. By this
point, my opinion of sports had sunk
to new lows ...
And then they went lower. I guess
what put me over the top was last
week's news that international police
were investigating over 600 (!) soccer
matches all over Europe, including
those in upper leagues and Champi-
