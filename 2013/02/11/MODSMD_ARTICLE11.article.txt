## SWEATING IT OUT Stanford narrowly pulls past Sun Devils 
### MIKE SCHWARTZd SPORTS STAFF WRITER 
Despite being lackluster for close to a decade,
Pac-12 basketball has made a clear resurgence
this season. Due to this heightened level of play
across the board, many college analysts have pro
jected between three and five teams from the
conference earning a spot in the NCAA tourna
ment.

Stanford (15-9, 6-5 Pac-12), winners of three
out of four, barring a close road loss to No. 7 Ari
zona, was making a push to be one of these teams
heading into their matchup with the Arizona
State Sun Devils (18-6, 7-4). A road win against
the Sun Devils would surely impress voters and
boost the Cardinal's RPI just weeks before
March Madness. On Saturday night, Stanford did
everything in its power to avoid disappointment.
It became evident early on that both the Car
dinal and the Sun Devils came to play. Neither
team could establish themselves; they traded
buckets for the majority of the first half. After
back-to-back 3-pointers by guard Chasson Ran
dle and forward Josh Huestis gave the Card an 8-
6 lead, Arizona State's Jonathan Gilling found
teammate Jordan Bachynski cutting towards to
basket to tie the game.
At the 13-minute mark with the game tied at
12, Huestis knocked down another 3-pointer to
give the Cardinal a 15-12 lead. Just seconds later,
to the tune of "anything you can do, I can do bet
ter," Evan Gordon made a 3-pointer of his own to
even the game. Soon after, Stanford put together
its best offensive stretch of the half, going on a
quick 11-0 run on the strength of two 3-pointers
by John Gage and a Dwight Powell layup.
After Gage's second 3-pointer gave the Card a
26-16, Arizona State head coach Herb Sendek
called a timeout to help his squad regain its com
posure. Unfortunately for Sendek, this move did
not cool off Gage's hot hand, as the forward
