## SWEATING IT OUT Stanford narrowly pulls past Sun Devils 
### MIKE SCHWARTZd SPORTS STAFF WRITER 
Despite being lackluster for close to a decade,
Pac-12 basketball has made a clear resurgence
this season. Due to this heightened level of play
across the board, many college analysts have pro
jected between three and five teams from the
conference earning a spot in the NCAA tourna
ment.

Stanford (15-9, 6-5 Pac-12), winners of three
out of four, barring a close road loss to No. 7 Ari
zona, was making a push to be one of these teams
heading into their matchup with the Arizona
State Sun Devils (18-6, 7-4). A road win against
the Sun Devils would surely impress voters and
boost the Cardinal's RPI just weeks before
March Madness. On Saturday night, Stanford did
everything in its power to avoid disappointment.
It became evident early on that both the Car
dinal and the Sun Devils came to play. Neither
team could establish themselves; they traded
buckets for the majority of the first half. After
back-to-back 3-pointers by guard Chasson Ran
dle and forward Josh Huestis gave the Card an 8-
6 lead, Arizona State's Jonathan Gilling found
teammate Jordan Bachynski cutting towards to
basket to tie the game.
At the 13-minute mark with the game tied at
12, Huestis knocked down another 3-pointer to
give the Cardinal a 15-12 lead. Just seconds later,
to the tune of "anything you can do, I can do bet
ter," Evan Gordon made a 3-pointer of his own to
even the game. Soon after, Stanford put together
its best offensive stretch of the half, going on a
quick 11-0 run on the strength of two 3-pointers
by John Gage and a Dwight Powell layup.
After Gage's second 3-pointer gave the Card a
26-16, Arizona State head coach Herb Sendek
called a timeout to help his squad regain its com
posure. Unfortunately for Sendek, this move did
not cool off Gage's hot hand, as the forward

knocked down his third consecu
tive 3-pointer immediately follow
ing the break in play.
The Sun Devils would not go out
quietly, however; they battled back
just before the half ended to put
themselves within striking dis
tance. Guard Jahii Carson convert
ed on a jumper with just over a
minute remaining to pull Arizona
State to within 11, prompting Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins
to call a timeout. It was to no avail,
as sophomore Jonathan Gilling
knocked down an uncontested 3-
pointer with six seconds remaining,
sending his team into the locker
room down 36-28 at half time.
It appeared early on that Stan
ford was in complete control in the
second half. Huestis scored on a
short jumper with 14:47 to put the
Cardinal up 48-32, giving its
largest lead to that point in the
game. But the Sun Devils quietly
mounted a comeback on the heels
of senior Carriek Felix. After a
Dwight Powell layup pushed Stan
ford's lead to 13 with 12:03 to play,
Felix countered with a 3-pointer.
The senior struck again at the
nine-minute mark, calmly setting
his feet and then drilling another
shot from beyond the arc to cut the
lead to seven.
It was not until Jahii Carson's
layup brought the score to 60-56,
favoring Stanford, with 1:15
remaining that the comeback
seemed like a legitimate possibility.
However, a missed 3-point attempt
by Evan Gordon essentially sealed
the deal for the Card, which man
aged to escape with a much-needed

62-59 victory.
It was a big win for a Stanford
team that now finds itself in the
mix for an at-large bid in the
NCAA Tournament. The Cardinal,
after struggling from beyond the
arc for much of the season, has
enjoyed an incredible amount of
success on 3-point attempts. As a
team, Stanford shot 10-18 from
three, a 55.6-percent clip that
essentially won them the game.
"We try to shoot with confi
dence," said junior Dwight Powell,
who led the team with 22 points.
This tactic has clearly been work
ing for the Card, and namely John
Gage, who has been lights-out from
beyond the arc in the last couple of
weeks. Gage, who finished the
game with 11 points, made three
out of four 3-point shots and was a
key player in the Cardinal's win.
"I tell myself I can only shoot
the ball, I can't control if it goes in,"
Gage said. "That takes a lot of the
mental pressure off me."
This tactic has certainly worked
for Gage, who has taken on a much
larger role for the Card in recent
weeks.
Stanford finds itself tied for
fight in the Pac-12 with Colorado
and in clear striking distance of
league-leading Arizona, Oregon
and UCLA, who are all 8-3 in con
ference play. Stanford, now two
games back, will have to play
almost perfect basketball for the
rest of the season in order to vault
to the top of the standings.
Next up for the Card are the
USC Trojans, who travel to Maples
Pavilion on Thursday, February 14.
Stanford will look to avoid another
upset loss to a USC team that has
been dangerous in Pac-12 play.
