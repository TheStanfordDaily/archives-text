# Card gets help from the bench
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
It is rare in a conference as dominant as the Pac
-12 that a basketball team could blow out its oppo
nents by more than 20 points in four consecutive
games, but the Stanford women's basketball team
(22-2,11-1) did just that this weekend.

The Card destroyed Arizona (11-12, 3-9 Pac-12)
Friday night 73-42 and continued its crushing play
against Arizona State (11-13, 3-9 Pac-12) Sunday,
beating the Sun Devils 69-45.
Junior forward Chiney Ogwumike has been the
engine behind the Stanford offense and defense the
whole season, and, as the Card heads into the final
games of Pac-12 play, that hasn't changed. What has
changed, however, is the notable spike in scoring
across the boards from multiple Cardinal players.
The breakout star Friday night was senior for
ward Mikaela Ruef, who earned her first career dou
ble-double and scored her career high with 11 points
and 10 rebounds. Topically a player known for the
great things she does away from the ball
rebounding, defense, assists Ruef proved that
she is capable of playing offensive minded.
"It's weird because I never thought I would score
11 points in a game," said Reuf. "That's way too
much. I know how to [score], but... I felt like nor
mally in the past it hasn't been my job to score. I like
passing more, but I'm making a concerted effort to
try and score."
The Card had eight players get on the score
board against the Wildcats, something that head
coach Tara VanDerveer has been waiting to happen
since the start of the season.
"This week in practice, we've had a couple of peo
ple out, including Jos [Tinkle], and we just said, 'We
can't just be a one-trick pony,"' said VanDerveer. "It
can't be all about Chiney [Ogwumike] and the low
block ... When you play with somebody like Chiney,
she makes it look so easy. She gets 32 points, and
other people need to assert themselves more.
"I'm really excited by how Mikaela [Ruefl's been
practicing really well, and they're a physical, athlet
ic team, and she got in deep, and she scored on them.
I'm excited for her."
Ogwumike and senior forward Joslyn Tinkle led
all scorers with 18 and 15 points, respectively. The
pair did such a consistent job throughout the game,
and especially in the second half Tinkle scored all
her points in the last 20 minutes that they put the
Card ahead by 30 points with five minutes to play
and were able to sit out the remainder of the game
and watch the bench players contribute.
One player absent from both games this week

end, however, was starting guard junior Toni Koke
nis, who has been struggling throughout the season
with not feeling well and is playing on a game-by
game basis.
"I like the opportunity it's providing other people
[with Kokenis out]," said VanDerveer. "Toni obvi
ously has a lot of experience, and we miss her, but
this gets other people in the mix, and we're going to
need that."

Against ASU, Stanford had a different player
step up and set a new career high. Sophomore guard
Bonnie Samuelson had 19 points against the Sun
Devils as she shot 50 percent from three-point land.
VanDerveer has made it clear that she has the
utmost confidence in Samuelson's shooting, making
Samuelson more comfortable with taking lots of
shots, something the team needs and thrives off of.
"I think Bonnie came in and gave me some great

this weekend," said VanDerveer.
"She got in there, and I think she's
really going to be able to help us.
She's been practicing really hard.
Mikaela Ruef is doing a great job,
so different people are [contribut
ing]."
Ogwumike scored 26 points and
grabbed 14 rebounds for another
double-double. Tinkle also record
ed a double-double with 13 points
and 11 rebounds.
ASU never led once and strug
gled the majority of the night in
shooting, making only 16-of-52
from the field. The Card's defense
shut down any offensive output
the Sun Devils might have been
able to muster, allowing only one
player, freshman guard Haley
Videckis (11 points), to score in
double digits.
Sun Devils head coach and
Stanford alum Charli Turner
Thorne is returning to her team
after a one-year sabbatical and
hasn't been able to pull the team
together in the short time she has
been back.
The Card capitalized on ASU's
youth and inexperience early and

was able to afford many players
valuable time on the court. Despite
the absence of Kokenis, the Card
did a good job taking care of the
ball, recording only seven
turnovers, with 12 assists.
Sophomore point guard Jas
mine Camp averaged 15 minutes of
playing time this weekend time
that she hasn't seen since before
her foot injury last season. She
passed out a combined six assists
with only two turnovers against
Arizona and ASU.
Sophomore guard Alex Greene
also returned to the court for the
final minutes of play for the first
time in over a year after suffering
from a torn Achilles tendon.
"We've been working really
hard in practice to step up every
single day and trying to have lots of
different people doing different
things for us, and I really think
that our coaches have been chal
lenging us a lot," said Samuelson.
"A lot of us have been trying to step
up in different ways. Every game
somebody new is stepping forward,
and that will help us in the long
run."
The Card will need that same
team effort as it takes on No. 17
UCLA and USC next weekend in
Los Angeles.
