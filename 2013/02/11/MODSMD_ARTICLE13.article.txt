# M. SWIM AND DIVE
## Trojans upset seniors 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On an emotional Senior Day in
front of an enthusiastic crowd of
Mends, family and supporters, the
men's swimming and diving squad
hoped to build off of the energy at
Avery Aquatics Center to defeat an
intimidating USC team. Instead, the
Cardinal helplessly watched as victo
ry after victory slipped through their
fingers. The No. 9 Stanford (4-1, 2-1
Pac-12) dropped a heartbreaker to the
No. 3 Trojans (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) by a
final score of 156-139.

The Cardinal, which was riding
high after its huge upset of No. 1 Ari
zona two weekends ago, was unable to
use its momentum in its favor against
a USC group that had been exposed
by No. 6 Cal in a convincing defeat on
Hiday. Stanford swimmers were able
to keep pace with the Trojans all after
noon but were never able to gain an
extra edge, which cost them the victo
ry on Saturday afternoon.
"The challenge for us today was to
win events, and although we raced
really well, we didn't win enough races
for the victory," head coach Ted
Knapp remarked after the match. "If
you look at the races we lost, the dif
ferences between first and second
place were very slim. That goes to
show you how important the details in
racing can be."
It was apparent from the begin
ning that the teams were very evenly
matched. The first event of the after
noon, the 400-yard medley relay, was
decided by a margin of less than two
tenths of a second. Olympic bronze
medalist Vladimir Morozov swam a
powerful anchor leg for USC to final
ly overtake Stanford in the final sec
onds of the race. It was only a sign of
thing's to come.
The very next event, the 1650-
yard freestyle, was also decided by a
mere one-tenths of a second as USC
sophomore Cristian Quintero trailed
