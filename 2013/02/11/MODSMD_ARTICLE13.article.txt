# M. SWIM AND DIVE
## Trojans upset seniors 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On an emotional Senior Day in
front of an enthusiastic crowd of
Mends, family and supporters, the
men's swimming and diving squad
hoped to build off of the energy at
Avery Aquatics Center to defeat an
intimidating USC team. Instead, the
Cardinal helplessly watched as victo
ry after victory slipped through their
fingers. The No. 9 Stanford (4-1, 2-1
Pac-12) dropped a heartbreaker to the
No. 3 Trojans (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) by a
final score of 156-139.

The Cardinal, which was riding
high after its huge upset of No. 1 Ari
zona two weekends ago, was unable to
use its momentum in its favor against
a USC group that had been exposed
by No. 6 Cal in a convincing defeat on
Hiday. Stanford swimmers were able
to keep pace with the Trojans all after
noon but were never able to gain an
extra edge, which cost them the victo
ry on Saturday afternoon.
"The challenge for us today was to
win events, and although we raced
really well, we didn't win enough races
for the victory," head coach Ted
Knapp remarked after the match. "If
you look at the races we lost, the dif
ferences between first and second
place were very slim. That goes to
show you how important the details in
racing can be."
It was apparent from the begin
ning that the teams were very evenly
matched. The first event of the after
noon, the 400-yard medley relay, was
decided by a margin of less than two
tenths of a second. Olympic bronze
medalist Vladimir Morozov swam a
powerful anchor leg for USC to final
ly overtake Stanford in the final sec
onds of the race. It was only a sign of
thing's to come.
The very next event, the 1650-
yard freestyle, was also decided by a
mere one-tenths of a second as USC
sophomore Cristian Quintero trailed

eling 15-minute affair until the
final leg, in which Quintero
pulled ahead in the last few
yards to clinch a victory.
It was more of the same in
the third event of the after
noon, the 200-yard freestyle,
when sophomore Thomas
Stephens' wild comeback
was stopped short as he was
touched-out by Trojan junior
Dmitri Colupaev by a mar
gin of seven-hundredths of a
second.
Stanford could never over
come its painful early deficit
despite strong performances
from sophomores David
Nolan and Kristian Ipsen.
Nolan picked up victories in
the 100-yard backstroke and
200-yard individual medley,
along with a second-place fin
ish in the 200-yard backstroke
as he continued to impress by
adding to his string of victories
this season.
Ipsen dominated the diving
boards all afternoon, as he
completely blew away all com
petition en route to huge victo
ries in both the 1-meter and 3-
meter diving events. He has

consistently given the Cardi
nal strong performances all
season, and his dominance on
Saturday further cemented his
status as one of the best divers
in the nation.
Seniors Mack Mont
gomery and Matt Thompson
were able to leave Avery Cen
ter on a winning note, as they
contributed the only other win
ning efforts for Stanford on
Saturday. Montgomery and
freshman Tom Kremer were
able to hold the Trojans at bay
in the 200-yard butterfly.
Thompson also held a steady
lead throughout the 200-yard
backstroke and was able to
hold through to the finish in a

winning effort.
Head coach Knapp, reflect
ing on the competition and the
remainder of the season, stat
ed, 'A win today would have
been nice, but we have a
greater goal in mind. Our* com
petition will get more talented,
and our seasonal plan is
designed so we can move from
training mode to racing mode."
Stanford will look to get
back to its winning ways in two
weeks as it travels across the
bay to visit No. 6 Cal (6-0, 3-0
Pac-12) to wrap up the regular
season.
