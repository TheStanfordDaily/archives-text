## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN The 						humanities don't need defending, but I'm defending them anyway 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Alex Bayer wrote a wonderful
series of columns on the
worth of the humanities in
this paper a few weeks back. What
she said got me thinking but
what really got me thinking is why
she felt she had to say it in the first
place.
Read through the online com
ments section of nearly any article
on the study of the humanities and
you're almost guaranteed to find
ideologically committed naysayers:
those who say the humanities pro
duce nothing of economic value,
make no one richer or better off or
more technologically advanced.
What perplexes me is why this
is a line of attack that anyone feels
sufficiently compelling to be worth
taking up a defense against.
Attacks on the humanities often
take the following form:
1) A humanities degree doesn't
produce money, either in the form
of a job for yourself or something
that produces economic value for
someone else.
2) Therefore, you shouldn't
major in the humanities.
But this argument makes a
colossal assumption that people
seem to miss. This argument
assumes that the guiding factor in
choosing a major should be how
much economic value it produces.
For some people people with
families to support after college, for
instance that may indeed be the
proper guiding light.
But for many others, that argu
ment is laughable on its face.
Money isn't morally good in and
of itself. Money is good because it
produces happiness and increased
human welfare. Generally speak
ing, the better off we are, the hap
pier we tend to be, hence the value
of modern medicine, antibiotics,
warm clothes, durable housing and
all the other accouterments of
modernity that come with the
increased prosperity enabled by
technological and economic
advance.
But if those subjects' value
the value of engineering, of medi
cine, of economics lies not in
their own intrinsic qualities but in
the amount of happiness they pro
duce, then surely subjects that pro
duce equal amount of happiness are
equally valuable?
I feel a great deal of happiness
while watching a great film, read
ing a great novel, or listening to a
great song. Those items are prod
ucts of minds schooled not in facts
and figures but in the human expe
rience, in the feelings and drives
that make us tick and give our lives
meaning.
Sure, that film is shown on a
screen that an engineer built, that
book was printed from a machine
an engineer designed, that song
plays on the iPod an engineer craft
ed.
But what value is there in blank
screens, in presses churning out
empty pages, in iPods playing
hours upon hours of everlasting
static?
Better to say that our lives are
worth living because we all have
skills and interests that can work in
tandem to improve and better the
world. Better to say that if we do

not encourage the flourishing of
both technical and nontechnical
disciplines, we risk missing out on
essential facets of the reason we
are here on Earth.
"Some of the most valuable
work needed by civilization,"
declared Theodore Roosevelt in
1910, "is essentially non-remunera
tive in its character." The president
knew that what made his nation a
nation worth leading were not
merely its bellows and smoke
stacks, its factories and railcars, its
steamships and telegraph lines. It
was the higher lives those things
had enabled his citizens to lead.
"While not merely acknowledg
ing but insisting," continued Roo
sevelt, "upon the fact that there
must be a basis of material well
being for the individual as for the
nation, let us with equal emphasis
insist that this material well-being
represents nothing but the founda
tion, and that the foundation,
though indispensable, is worthless
unless upon it is raised the super
structure of a higher life."
The humanities are the well
spring of that higher life. They are
what we do once the scientists have
kept us safe from disease, the engi
neers have kept us safe from natu
ral disasters and the police officers
and lawyers have kept us safe from
each other and from our govern
ment.
They are the reason we tend to
read Harry Potter to make us hap
py and not investment statistics,
watch Casablanca instead of the
stock ticker, measure the worth of
our days in smiles and laughs
rather than dollars accumulated
(although dollars well-spent can
certainly produce smiles and
laughs).
The humanities don't need
defending. They are just as intrin
sically valuable as any other sub
ject that makes human life better
and that empowers us to reach the
higher planes of understanding
toward which the University reach
es.

What value is
there in blank
screens or iPods
playing hours
and hours of
everlasting static?
