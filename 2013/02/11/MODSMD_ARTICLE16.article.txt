## "American Meat" Protest a Missed Opportunity for Dialogue 
### PRIYA FIELDING-SINGH ROHISHA ADKE MARIA DELOSO& CAROLINE HODGE Student organizers of Meat Your Farmers: "American Meat" Film Screening Panel Discussion 
On Thursday, a group of animal
rights advocates protested at
a film screening of "American
Meat," a documentary about the
future of meat production from the
U.S. farmer's perspective. Seven
protesters took the stage during the
panel discussion following the
screening. They stood directly
between the audience and row of
panelists for more than twenty min
utes, speaking over the moderator
and aggressively confronting the
film director. They expressed their
viewpoint by holding up photo
graphs of animals and repeating the
phrase, "They didn't deserve to
die."
Had the protesters' tactics been
less disruptive, perhaps the event
would not have been so explosive.
But by refusing to let the panel dis
cussion continue, they quickly dis
solved any possibility for support.
Some audience members stood up
and left. Those who remained grew
increasingly frustrated. Fifteen
minutes in, the audience literally
tried to boo the demonstrators off
the stage. When they finally left,
the crowd cheered.
As the organizers of this event
and leaders of food activist organi
zations on campus, we were sur
prised that these individuals chose
to protest at an event aimed at facil
itating dialogue about our food

choices. The documentary raised a
number of important issues: Where
does our meat come from? How
much meat should Americans be
eating and how much are we actual
ly consuming?
The film encouraged viewers to
stop to question their own dietary
beliefs and behaviors. We are
pleased by the feedback we've
received so far, which indicates that
many of the more than 200 audience
members found the evening
thought-provoking and informative.
Offering such educational oppor
tunities is an essential part of our
work as students and activists to
create a more sustainable and
humane food system one which
treats animals, our planet, and our
selves better.
That is why we screened the film
and organized a diverse panel of
experts to discuss the problems and
potential solutions associated with
our country's meat production sys
tem. We know that reforming our
food system requires forging
alliances across groups.
Thursday's protesters used pre
cisely the opposite tactic. The
screening drew attendees interest
ed in learning more about our
opaque food system. Over 200
potential (and current) food
activists sat in the audience. Yet,
these demonstrators missed an

incredible chance to open eyes to an
alternative way of thinking about
our relationship with animals.
Instead, the protesters infuriated
and alienated meat- and plant
eaters alike.
They reified the monolithic
stereotype of vegetarians and vegans
as militant and irrational. They com
promised the voice of the panelist we
had invited to provide us with a more
animal-centric viewpoint. They
undermined their own cause.
To reform our food system, we
cannot afford to make enemies out
of allies. While pushing people to
think outside of their comfort zones
is an important part of growing a
movement, inducing widespread
anger, fear, and disgust is not. We
hope that the protesters take the
advice of many audience members,
and organize their own event and
panel discussion. They too have a
message worth hearing, but there
are more effective ways to facilitate
audience understanding than the
strategies they used Thursday
night.
