# STANFORD SPLITS AT HOME
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The fourth-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team returned home this
weekend to take on No. 1 UC-Irvine
and UC-San Diego. After two hard
fought battles, the Cardinal emerged
with a split, dropping the first match
but sweeping the second.

On Friday night, Stanford (8-4,5-4
MPSF) met the top team in the
nation, defending national champion
UCI (10-3, 7-3) in the smaller Burn
ham Pavilion. Irvine was riding a
four-game win streak, but Stanford
was determined to not let its 12-game
home win streak come to an end.
The first two sets, however, were
all Irvine, as the Anteaters took both
handily, wanning both 25-18. The
match seemed to be sewn up, but the
Cardinal refused to give in.
Stanford started the third set with
six straight points, shifting the
momentum of the match back into its
favor. Led by junior outside hitter
Brian Cook, who recorded seven kills
in the set, Stanford never trailed and
captured the third 25-20.
The fourth set again seemed to be
all Irvine, but Stanford again refused
to quit. The Anteaters cruised to a
quick 11-4 lead to start the set, put
ting the Cardinal into a deep hole.
Cook and fellow junior Steven
Irvin, however, put it on themselves to
pull Stanford back into the game. The
pair combined for two aces and 14
kills in the set, and Stanford began to
crawl back into the game.
The Cardinal was able to tie the
match at 17 after an Irvine error,
shifting the momentum of the match
and leading all in attendance to
believe a fifth set was destined to
occur.
The Anteaters, however, were
determined not to go to five and were
able to compose themselves impres
sively. Irvine didn't allow Stanford to
take a lead in the set, holding off each
attack and squeaking out a 25-23 vic
tory.
Irvin led all players with 21 kills on
.375 hitting, giving him his third
straight 20-kill game. Before the
streak, his previous game-high had

been 18. Cook added 18 of his own on
.421 hitting, as well as eight digs. The
Cardinal was hurt by a lack of offen
sive contribution from the rest of the
team, as all other Stanford players
combined for just seven kills.
After the loss, Stanford went into
its match with UCSD (4-10, 2-8)
knowing that it had to reverse the los
ing tide with a victory over one of the
bottom teams in the MPSF. Coach
John Kosty, in an effort to find a win
ning combination, tried a new start
ing lineup with junior Denny Falls at
middle blocker and freshman setter
Joe Ctvrtlik receiving his first start.
Ctvrtlik certainly capitalized on
his opportunity, with 33 assists, eight
digs and three blocks, despite being
the one of the shortest men on the
court for much of the match. Junior
setter Grant Delgado, who tallied
seven digs on the match, was
impressed with the freshman's per
formance, stating that "he is a fast,
agile setter who gets his hands on
everything, has great court presence

and brings positive energy out on the
court."
The first set was a back-and-forth
affair, with UCSD leading for much
of it. The Cardinal battled back,
however, pulling the score square at
20 before a surge of Triton errors
brought Stanford to the verge of vic
tory. After a Cook kill, Stanford was
able to pull out the first, 25-22.
Stanford was again stuck playing
catch-up for much of the second set,
as UCSD started on a 4-0 run that
put them firmly in control. The Car
dinal slowly chipped away, with a
powerful kill from Cook giving Stan
ford its first lead of the set at 20-19.
Cook finished with a match-high 12,
and Stanford was again able to pull
out a close victory, 25-22.
Stanford held a close lead for
much of the third set, but UCSD
refused to give in. The Cardinal held
an opportunity to close the Tritons
out with a 24-21 match-point, but
UCSD converted twice, hoping to
complete an incredible comeback.

Senior outside hitter Jake Kneller
wouldn't let that happen, however,
with an emphatic kill to close out the
Tritons, 25-23.
Kneller had one of his best match
es of the season, with nine kills on
.538 hitting. Irvin chipped in 10 kills,
while sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly had five kills and four
blocks.
Junior opposite Daniel Tublin,
who had to sit out the matches with
injury, echoed the importance of
strong middle play, stating that "it
was great to see our connection with
the middles develop," as "it will help
open up [their] offense against teams
looking to slow down [their] outside
hitters."
Stanford is back on the road next
weekend, taking on Cal State North
ridge and Long Beach State. Both
should be solid tests for the young
Cardinal team.
