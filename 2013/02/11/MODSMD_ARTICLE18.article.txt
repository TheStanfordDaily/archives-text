### â€“ George Chen 
Opening its 2013 cam
paign, the No. 20 Stanford
women's softball team
played six games over the
course of five action-packed
days at the Kajikawa Classic
in Tempe, Ariz.
The Cardinal dominated
Bradley and Indiana, pulled
out nail-biters over Portland
State and Cal Poly and fell to
No. 2 Oklahoma and Ken
tucky.
Senior pitcher Teagan
Gerhart did much of the
heavy lifting, starting in four
of the six games and finishing
the tournament with an over
all record of 2-1 and one no
decision. The senior standout
was especially impressive
against Portland State, as
she fanned nine batters and
allowed only one run. Howev
er, Gerhart was harassed ear
ly and often by a dynamic
Oklahoma offense that
scored five runs in the first
inning alone.
Making her collegiate
debut, freshman pitcher
Kelsey Stevens was also
impressive on the mound.
Stevens especially showed
poise when she came in to
relieve Gerhart against the
Sooners and gave up just one
run on two hits while striking
nine batters over the course
of six innings.
Stanford's offense came
alive when it was most need
ed, manufacturing eight
points against both Bradley
and Indiana. Against Cal
Poly, sophomore outfielder
Cassandra Roulund scored
the winning run in the
ninth inning to ensure that
the Cardinal would come
away with no worse than a
0.500 record from the tourna
ment.
Next up for Stanford is a
home game against Santa
Clara, which is slated to
begin at 5 p.m. this Wednes
day.
