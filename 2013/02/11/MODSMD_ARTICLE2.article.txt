## Female cadets anticipate role on front lines Stanford ROTC reacts to lifting of ban on women in combat 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD 
While the Pentagon's decision last
month to lift its ban on women serving in
combat has garnered national attention,
the announcement will also directly affect
the female cadets of Stanford's Reserve
Officers' Training Corps (ROTC).
"[ln] years past... the closest that
any female officer could potentially be to
combat [was as a] military police officer,"
said Dustin Whidden, ROTC enrollment
officer for Stanford and Santa Clara Uni
versity. "Now this has opened the door
for field artillery, armor, infantry you
know, the typical positions that were only
allowed for male military officers to be in
leadership in."
Women have been serving unofficially
in combat roles throughout the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, but their work
often went without the credit and career
advantages that official recognition
would have permitted. According to The
New York Times, the Pentagon reported
that "hundreds of thousands of women
have deployed in those conflicts," with
over 800 wounded and 130 killed.
Lauren McCune 'l5, an ROTC cadet,
expressed excitement about the possibili
ty of serving with an infantry platoon
something that would not have been pos
sible just a month ago.
"The one thing that makes a big dif
ference to me is that I'll actually be able
to be the S2, the strategy [and] risk
assessment officer attached to each pla
toon, and now I could get to be with an
infantry platoon," McCune said.
When she graduates from Stanford
and becomes an active officer in the mili
tary, McCune will assume the role of Sec
ond Lieutenant, the lowest officer rank,
with the ability to seek a position in any
branch she chooses.
"If you're a second lieutenant you're
automatically put in charge of a platoon,
so the first day on the job you're in
charge of these 50 people," said Haney D.
Hong 'O3, president of the Stanford Mili
tary Service Network and a retired offi
cer in the U.S. Navy. "The opportunities
that have been opened to women are
essentially that they can be platoon lead
ers, at least from the officer's perspec
tive, of combat arms platoons. From the
enlisted woman's perspective, you can
actually be a part of these platoons."
Hong, who served in the Navy during
the integration of women into submarine
service, spoke from personal experience
about the difference that the ban's lifting
will make.
"This is a great thing," Hong said.
"Number one: by being more inclusive,
we're getting more perspectives on how
