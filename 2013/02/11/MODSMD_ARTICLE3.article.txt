## AND WE DANCED Student dancers raise $60,000 to combat H.I.V./AIDS 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's ninth annual Dance Marathon
raised just over $60,000 to combat the global
H.I.V/AIDS epidemic, with almost 1,500 stu
dents dancing in shifts from 1 p.m. on Saturday
to 1 p.m. on Sunday.
The event's fundraising total is similar to
last year's total of $60,085.97, which was itself a
decrease from the $65,075.50 raised in 2011.
However, a larger portion of this year's tally
came from dancer fundraising than last year, as

roughly $60,000 came from dancers or walk-in
attendees this year compared with $42,000 last
year.
Last year, Dance Marathon's partner organ
ization Code the Change (CTC) accounted for
$13,000 of the donations. This year, CTC was
only responsible for $2,000 of the final fundrais
ing total.
Dance Marathon directors were encouraged
by the fact that they were able to raise more
money through student fundraising. According
to Co-Director Abigail Andrews 'l3, Dance
Marathon chose to shift away from relying on

CTC and attempt to raise a greater percentage
of the funds through individual dancers in order
to ensure the long-term independent sustain
ability of the organization.
Dance Marathon was founded in 2005 and is
held annually at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Co-Director Elise Geithner 'l3 estimated that
30 dancers and 25 staff members stayed for the
entire 24 hours, saying that an "amazing chunk
of people" danced for 15 to 20 hours.
"The energy is incredible," Geithner said.
