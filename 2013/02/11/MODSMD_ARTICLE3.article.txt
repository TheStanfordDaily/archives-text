## AND WE DANCED Student dancers raise $60,000 to combat H.I.V./AIDS 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's ninth annual Dance Marathon
raised just over $60,000 to combat the global
H.I.V/AIDS epidemic, with almost 1,500 stu
dents dancing in shifts from 1 p.m. on Saturday
to 1 p.m. on Sunday.
The event's fundraising total is similar to
last year's total of $60,085.97, which was itself a
decrease from the $65,075.50 raised in 2011.
However, a larger portion of this year's tally
came from dancer fundraising than last year, as

roughly $60,000 came from dancers or walk-in
attendees this year compared with $42,000 last
year.
Last year, Dance Marathon's partner organ
ization Code the Change (CTC) accounted for
$13,000 of the donations. This year, CTC was
only responsible for $2,000 of the final fundrais
ing total.
Dance Marathon directors were encouraged
by the fact that they were able to raise more
money through student fundraising. According
to Co-Director Abigail Andrews 'l3, Dance
Marathon chose to shift away from relying on

CTC and attempt to raise a greater percentage
of the funds through individual dancers in order
to ensure the long-term independent sustain
ability of the organization.
Dance Marathon was founded in 2005 and is
held annually at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Co-Director Elise Geithner 'l3 estimated that
30 dancers and 25 staff members stayed for the
entire 24 hours, saying that an "amazing chunk
of people" danced for 15 to 20 hours.
"The energy is incredible," Geithner said.

Almost 1,500 students participated in the ninth annual Dance Marathon, a 24-hour event held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center from 1
p.m. on Feb. 10 to 1 p.m. on Feb. 11. Dancers raised over $60,000 in donations to combat the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic.
"It seemed like the people who were
here really knew why they were
here. It has been incredible."
According to Andrews, the four
directors restructured several
aspects of the event this year, includ
ing marketing, recruitment of
dancers and catering.
Some of the most significant
changes were made to fundraising
policies. For the first time, Dance
Marathon used the online fundrais
ing platform Hob Knob, which gave
dancers the opportunity to send out
mass emails and make Facebook
posts requesting donations from
their acquaintances.
"We've never had that before,"
Geithner said about the ability to
fundraise online. "It was so nice not
to rely on checks and snail-mail."
The event's directors also recon
sidered their strategy for seeking
corporate donations.
"We decided to shift away from
relying on personal connections to
big companies in order to secure big
donation checks," Andrews said. "If
we build corporate sponsorships
that are much more based around
what we do rather than transient
partnerships based on personal con
nections, it will be more sustainable
in the long run for the organization."
Each dancer was asked to raise
$192 and dancers were given
fundraising suggestions from the

directors. Some dancers relied on
more traditional fundraising meth
ods like bake sales and doing chores
for dormmates in exchange for
donations, while others offered hen
na tattoos or taught yoga.
Geithner said that an additional
$2,000 to $3,000 was raised at the
door during the event through "gen
tle heckling" of event attendees.
"We were pretty aggressive in
terms of a suggested donation of
$lO. People were throwing us tons of
money, from change to $lOO bills,"
Geithner said.
Before 2011, Dance Marathon
consistently raised larger sums, with
matching donations by FACE AIDS
leading to total sums of $178,000 in
2010 and $130,000 in 2009. Accord
ing to Andrews, FACE AIDS dis
continued that arrangement due to
the difficulty of matching the funds
raised by Dance Marathon.
The directors also revamped the
event's marketing structure in order
to attract more students to the
event, utilizing social media and cre
ating promotional videos featuring
the football team and other student
groups. However, both Andrews and
Geithner said that the directors
were more concerned with keeping
dancers at the event than with regis
tering a large number of students.
Students who could not commit
to 24 hours of dancing could register
to be "moralers." Moralers, who
were expected to raise $6O each, had
three-hour dance shifts and learned
a special morale dance to keep other
dancers energized.
Nicole Gurtler 'l6 registered as a

dancer, but decided to participate for
a few hours instead of the full day.
Gurtler said that, although she did
not stay for the entire event, she was
impressed by the support made avail
able to dancers by event organizers.
"The people who organized the
event were super motivated and
passionate about it, and that was
awesome to see," Gurtler said. "It
definitely helped everyone else get
in the mood."
Gurtler attended the event with
Tammy Chin Loy 'l6, who said that
she was pleased with the event's
snack selection. According to
Andrews, the directors "aggressive
ly pursued" more diverse food
options this year, changing their
catering and food donation policies
to accommodate participants with
gluten-free diets and other dietary
restrictions.
"This is something we've never
done in the past and we felt it was
very important," Andrews said. "We
also focused on providing healthier
food to get the dancers through the
24 hours."
Though the event did not reach
this year's fundraising goal of
$lOO,OOO, Andrews predicted that
the time-intensive process of build
ing relationships with new corporate
sponsors would eventually pay off.
"We anticipated that this year we
would take a hit in fundraising, but
we feel its much more in the long
term interests of the organization to
pursue that strategy," she said.

last year's total of $60,085.97, which was itself a
decrease from the $65,075.50 raised in 2011.
However, a larger portion of this year's tally
came from dancer fundraising than last year, as

roughly $60,000 came from dancers or walk-in
attendees this year compared with $42,000 last
year.
Last year, Dance Marathon's partner organ
ization Code the Change (CTC) accounted for
$13,000 of the donations. This year, CTC was
only responsible for $2,000 of the final fundrais
ing total.
Dance Marathon directors were encouraged
by the fact that they were able to raise more
money through student fundraising. According
to Co-Director Abigail Andrews 'l3, Dance
Marathon chose to shift away from relying on

CTC and attempt to raise a greater percentage
of the funds through individual dancers in order
to ensure the long-term independent sustain
ability of the organization.
Dance Marathon was founded in 2005 and is
held annually at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Co-Director Elise Geithner 'l3 estimated that
30 dancers and 25 staff members stayed for the
entire 24 hours, saying that an "amazing chunk
of people" danced for 15 to 20 hours.
"The energy is incredible," Geithner said.

Almost 1,500 students participated in the ninth annual Dance Marathon, a 24-hour event held at the Arrillaga Alumni Center from 1
p.m. on Feb. 10 to 1 p.m. on Feb. 11. Dancers raised over $60,000 in donations to combat the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic.
"It seemed like the people who were
here really knew why they were
here. It has been incredible."
According to Andrews, the four
directors restructured several
aspects of the event this year, includ
ing marketing, recruitment of
dancers and catering.
Some of the most significant
changes were made to fundraising
policies. For the first time, Dance
Marathon used the online fundrais
ing platform Hob Knob, which gave
dancers the opportunity to send out
mass emails and make Facebook
posts requesting donations from
their acquaintances.
"We've never had that before,"
Geithner said about the ability to
fundraise online. "It was so nice not
to rely on checks and snail-mail."
The event's directors also recon
sidered their strategy for seeking
corporate donations.
"We decided to shift away from
relying on personal connections to
big companies in order to secure big
donation checks," Andrews said. "If
we build corporate sponsorships
that are much more based around
what we do rather than transient
partnerships based on personal con
nections, it will be more sustainable
in the long run for the organization."
Each dancer was asked to raise
$192 and dancers were given
fundraising suggestions from the

directors. Some dancers relied on
more traditional fundraising meth
ods like bake sales and doing chores
for dormmates in exchange for
donations, while others offered hen
na tattoos or taught yoga.
Geithner said that an additional
$2,000 to $3,000 was raised at the
door during the event through "gen
tle heckling" of event attendees.
"We were pretty aggressive in
terms of a suggested donation of
$lO. People were throwing us tons of
money, from change to $lOO bills,"
Geithner said.
Before 2011, Dance Marathon
consistently raised larger sums, with
matching donations by FACE AIDS
leading to total sums of $178,000 in
2010 and $130,000 in 2009. Accord
ing to Andrews, FACE AIDS dis
continued that arrangement due to
the difficulty of matching the funds
raised by Dance Marathon.
The directors also revamped the
event's marketing structure in order
to attract more students to the
event, utilizing social media and cre
ating promotional videos featuring
the football team and other student
groups. However, both Andrews and
Geithner said that the directors
were more concerned with keeping
dancers at the event than with regis
tering a large number of students.
Students who could not commit
to 24 hours of dancing could register
to be "moralers." Moralers, who
were expected to raise $6O each, had
three-hour dance shifts and learned
a special morale dance to keep other
dancers energized.
Nicole Gurtler 'l6 registered as a

dancer, but decided to participate for
a few hours instead of the full day.
Gurtler said that, although she did
not stay for the entire event, she was
impressed by the support made avail
able to dancers by event organizers.
"The people who organized the
event were super motivated and
passionate about it, and that was
awesome to see," Gurtler said. "It
definitely helped everyone else get
in the mood."
Gurtler attended the event with
Tammy Chin Loy 'l6, who said that
she was pleased with the event's
snack selection. According to
Andrews, the directors "aggressive
ly pursued" more diverse food
options this year, changing their
catering and food donation policies
to accommodate participants with
gluten-free diets and other dietary
restrictions.
"This is something we've never
done in the past and we felt it was
very important," Andrews said. "We
also focused on providing healthier
food to get the dancers through the
24 hours."
Though the event did not reach
this year's fundraising goal of
$lOO,OOO, Andrews predicted that
the time-intensive process of build
ing relationships with new corporate
sponsors would eventually pay off.
"We anticipated that this year we
would take a hit in fundraising, but
we feel its much more in the long
term interests of the organization to
pursue that strategy," she said.
