Nations Security Council.
the lectern as foreign delegates
scrambled to find out exactly why
the world's western powers had
demanded transparency from the
Israeli nuclear program.
Of course, no such demand
actually came from France over the
weekend. The proceedings were
part of the Polisci 114S: Interna
tional Security in a Changing
World class simulation of the
UNSC, where for 48 hours stu
dents transformed into delegates
debating one of today's hottest
international issues: the Iranian
nuclear program. The French
Republic delegation chair who
requested that Israel ratify the
treaty was Robert Chun 'l6.
Scott Sagan, professor of politi
cal science and creator of the
class's first simulation 16 years
ago, characterized the simulation
as evolving into a "more realistic
learning experience," especially
given the rapidly changing and
increasingly precarious interna
tional security climate of recent
years.
"This year's simulation is tak
ing place in a real-world situation
that is very dynamic," Sagan said.
"It's very hard to tell sometimes
when there's an announcement
whether this is something that has
been simulated or whether it's
something that has really hap
pened."
Realism was a key goal of not
only the simulation which
course teaching assistant Eric Min,
a second-year graduate student,
described as "the highlight of the
course" but of the class as a
whole, which was meant to be a
wide-ranging view of current inter
national security issues.
"The idea of the simulation is
twofold," said Hoover fellow Amy
Zegart M.A. '93 Ph.D. '96, who
teaches the course. "We want to
give students a real feel for inter
national relations, [and] we want
them to realize how much in the
real world involves dealing with the
unexpected, which is not what you
often find in college classes. You
understand why those seemingly
obvious answers don't happen in
real life."
To achieve realism, students
participating in the simulation
were required to do everything
from memo drafting to press cov
erage.
"The most challenging part is
for students to write an executive
memorandum, which is an invalu
able skill in real life," said course
teaching assistant Arash Aramesh
J.D. 'l4.
For the second year in a row,
students in the Department of
Communication acted as members
of the international press corps
covering the simulation. Students
in Comm 104W: Reporting, Writ
ing, and Understanding the News,
taught by lecturer in communica
tion and former Washington Post
Bureau Chief Janine Zacharia, imi
tated real reporters, asking ques
tions at press conferences and
releasing news blasts throughout
the simulation.
Ruth Bram 'l4, a member of the
press corps, found herself thrown
quickly in the drama of the simula
tion.
"You have to be very quick on
your feet and decipher in just a few

seconds what is newsworthy or
not," she said. "We're not only
informing the public but also the
delegates about what's happening
in their own summit."
Zegart commented on how
quickly things change in geopoli
tics, with changes on one side of the
planet affecting negotiations on the
other.

"Things get very interesting
very fast," she said. "You have del
egates hacking into other dele
gates' email accounts, heads of
state getting executed, delegations
walking out in protest. It's all very
dynamic."
This year, nuclear weapons
were tested in North Korea during
the proceedings, and the king of
Saudi Arabia died from food poi
soning. Delegates were also noti
fied in a case of apparent email
hacking that Israeli forces had
attacked Italy.
While that dynamism may be
faculty-initiated, simulation organ
izers insisted that the ensuing
developments are student driven.
"We inject surprises during the
course of the simulation just to
keep students on their toes," said
Martha Crenshaw, course profes
sor and senior fellow at the Center
for International Security and
Cooperation. "At the same time, we
are careful not to add too much to
the scenario, because a lot of it is
about students reacting, talking to
other delegations and working
through the developments. We let
them take the lead."
The simulation has grown over
the last few years, with student
participation tripling this year.
"This is by far the most elabo
rate simulation I've ever seen
we have 12 to 15 faculty acting as
heads of state and 170 students
representing 23 countries," Zegart
said.
Crenshaw commented on how
the simulation can be a deeply
immersive and sometimes even
emotional experience for students.
"In the past years we've seen
students become so immersed in
reaching a compromise that they
were furious when their resolution
was vetoed," she said. "Students
remember this simulation for years
afterwards."
Rehan Adamjee 'l6, chair of the
North Korean delegation, said
playing characters in simulation
expanded his knowledge far
beyond what he might hear in the
news.
"I really learnt to be [North
Korea]," he said, referring to the
oft-unpredictable and provocative
regime.
Cameron Hutton 'l4, who rep
resented Argentina, said the expe
rience was "fantastic" but left room
for improvement.
"Maybe having more countries
would make this even more repre
sentative of the UNSC," he said.

actually came from France over the
weekend. The proceedings were
part of the Polisci 114S: Interna
tional Security in a Changing
World class simulation of the
UNSC, where for 48 hours stu
dents transformed into delegates
debating one of today's hottest
international issues: the Iranian
nuclear program. The French
Republic delegation chair who
requested that Israel ratify the
treaty was Robert Chun 'l6.
Scott Sagan, professor of politi
cal science and creator of the
class's first simulation 16 years
ago, characterized the simulation
as evolving into a "more realistic
learning experience," especially
given the rapidly changing and
increasingly precarious interna
tional security climate of recent
years.
"This year's simulation is tak
ing place in a real-world situation
that is very dynamic," Sagan said.
"It's very hard to tell sometimes
when there's an announcement
whether this is something that has
been simulated or whether it's
something that has really hap
pened."
Realism was a key goal of not
only the simulation which
course teaching assistant Eric Min,
a second-year graduate student,
described as "the highlight of the
course" but of the class as a
whole, which was meant to be a
wide-ranging view of current inter
national security issues.
"The idea of the simulation is
twofold," said Hoover fellow Amy
Zegart M.A. '93 Ph.D. '96, who
teaches the course. "We want to
give students a real feel for inter
national relations, [and] we want
them to realize how much in the
real world involves dealing with the
unexpected, which is not what you
often find in college classes. You
understand why those seemingly
obvious answers don't happen in
real life."
To achieve realism, students
participating in the simulation
were required to do everything
from memo drafting to press cov
erage.
"The most challenging part is
for students to write an executive
memorandum, which is an invalu
able skill in real life," said course
teaching assistant Arash Aramesh
J.D. 'l4.
For the second year in a row,
students in the Department of
Communication acted as members
of the international press corps
covering the simulation. Students
in Comm 104W: Reporting, Writ
ing, and Understanding the News,
taught by lecturer in communica
tion and former Washington Post
Bureau Chief Janine Zacharia, imi
tated real reporters, asking ques
tions at press conferences and
releasing news blasts throughout
the simulation.
Ruth Bram 'l4, a member of the
press corps, found herself thrown
quickly in the drama of the simula
tion.
"You have to be very quick on
your feet and decipher in just a few

seconds what is newsworthy or
not," she said. "We're not only
informing the public but also the
delegates about what's happening
in their own summit."
Zegart commented on how
quickly things change in geopoli
tics, with changes on one side of the
planet affecting negotiations on the
other.

"Things get very interesting
very fast," she said. "You have del
egates hacking into other dele
gates' email accounts, heads of
state getting executed, delegations
walking out in protest. It's all very
dynamic."
This year, nuclear weapons
were tested in North Korea during
the proceedings, and the king of
Saudi Arabia died from food poi
soning. Delegates were also noti
fied in a case of apparent email
hacking that Israeli forces had
attacked Italy.
While that dynamism may be
faculty-initiated, simulation organ
izers insisted that the ensuing
developments are student driven.
"We inject surprises during the
course of the simulation just to
keep students on their toes," said
Martha Crenshaw, course profes
sor and senior fellow at the Center
for International Security and
Cooperation. "At the same time, we
are careful not to add too much to
the scenario, because a lot of it is
about students reacting, talking to
other delegations and working
through the developments. We let
them take the lead."
The simulation has grown over
the last few years, with student
participation tripling this year.
"This is by far the most elabo
rate simulation I've ever seen
we have 12 to 15 faculty acting as
heads of state and 170 students
representing 23 countries," Zegart
said.
Crenshaw commented on how
the simulation can be a deeply
immersive and sometimes even
emotional experience for students.
"In the past years we've seen
students become so immersed in
reaching a compromise that they
were furious when their resolution
was vetoed," she said. "Students
remember this simulation for years
afterwards."
Rehan Adamjee 'l6, chair of the
North Korean delegation, said
playing characters in simulation
expanded his knowledge far
beyond what he might hear in the
news.
"I really learnt to be [North
Korea]," he said, referring to the
oft-unpredictable and provocative
regime.
Cameron Hutton 'l4, who rep
resented Argentina, said the expe
rience was "fantastic" but left room
for improvement.
"Maybe having more countries
would make this even more repre
sentative of the UNSC," he said.
