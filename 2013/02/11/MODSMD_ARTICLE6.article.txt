## ASSU receives 35 NomCom applications 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Executive Board
received 35 applications for seven
seats on the 2012-2013 Nomina
tions Committee (NomCom), the
group of students responsible for
selecting and appointing student
representatives to more than 40
University committees and organ
izations.
ASSU President Robbie Zim
broff'l2 M.A. 'l3 said that the pool
of applicants half graduate and
half undergraduate students is
diverse and capable.
"There will be a very qualified
NomCom," he said. "The group of
seven...will be really solid and
will come from all corners of cam
pus."
Last year's ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice Presi
dent Stewart McGregor-Dennis

'l3 deferred their obligation to
appoint students to NomCom
because they anticipated that a
revised ASSU Constitution

which, among other changes, reor
ganizes the NomCom structure
would be ratified before the end of
their term.

When opposition from current
and past ASSU members stymied
the passage of the new governing
documents, the 2012-2013 ASSU
was left without any mechanism
for incorporating student perspec
tives into University committees.
The 14th Undergraduate Sen
ate, which had its first meeting on
May 1, 2012, passed a bill assem
bling an interim NomCom. The
group made up of past Nom-
Com members and current ASSU
officials was tasked to select
and interview students for over 40
University committee spots in less
than three weeks.
Zimbroff, who was one of the
members of last year's interim
NomCom, said that, because of
their limited timeline, the commit
tee was only able to recommend stu
dent representatives for about 85
percent of open spots on University
committees and groups. He called
the failure to fill all positions "disap
pointing," while senators described
the overall process as "not ideal,"
"tough" and "shitty."
By starting in February instead
of May, Zimbroff said that he is con
fident that this year's NomCom will
do a better job than last year's
interim group at ensuring the stu
dent body's voice is heard on all lev
els of the University's operations.
He cited the Office of Community
Standards, which oversees judicial
proceedings with panels partially

composed of students, as an exam
ple of an office requiring greater
student engagement.
"One of our priorities for this
year's NomCom, and why we want
to get it started early, is so that they
have ample time to advertise and
really recruit strong students
and the full allotment of students
that have been requested for differ
ent committees and groups on cam
pus," he said.
A joint working group composed
of several senators and Graduate
Student Council members will read
applications, interview candidates
and submit a bill to both legislative
bodies with appointment recom
mendations. According to Senator
Daniela Olivos 'l5, a member of the
working committee, the bills will be
submitted no later than February
26.
In addition to seeking committed
and responsible students that are
aware of Stanford's many diverse
communities, Olivos explained that
the working group wants NomCom
members who can recruit vocal stu
dent representatives.

"We're looking for [NomCom
candidates] to understand what
the students' position in a univer
sity committee entails," Olivos
said, "[They should] be able to find
students who are willing to speak
up for the undergraduate body
and the Stanford [graduates] as
well."
Zimbroff said that he hopes this
NomCom will be able to solicit
applications from students through
the end of spring break and begin
interviewing in the first couple of
weeks of spring quarter.
All members of NomCom earn
$9OO and the Chair and Vice-Chair
make an additional $5OO and $3OO
respectively, according to Zimbroff.
"[The process has been] a lot
cleaner it's going as it should
go," Zimbroff said. "We're just
doing the things we think we need
to be doing and should be doing to
be functional. Hopefully every
thing continues to go as smoothly
as it's been going."
