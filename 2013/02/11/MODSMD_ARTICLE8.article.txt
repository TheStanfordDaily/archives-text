## Students launch video communication app 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shortwave, a video-based, asyn
chronous communication tool creat
ed by a team involving several Stan
ford students, launched this Thurs
day in Apple's App Store.
Nick Manuosos 'l4 and Laura
Pospisil 'l4 helped develop the app
in an effort led by Cornell graduates
Sean Chen and Aditya Avadhanula.
Avadhanula described Shortwave as
a mobile, video version of Reddit.
"What we're trying to do is cap
ture conversations which happen in
a community, which usually happens
at the end of a blog or something,"
he said. "We're moving that into
video. It's a really easy way to par
ticipate in asynchronous conversa
tion anytime, anywhere."
Shortwave stitches together
video responses from different
users into one continuous, playable
video. Users have the opportunity to
vote up or down on videos, and the
most popular videos are moved up
within the thread.
The website uses a nautical
theme for content recommendation.
Voting a clip, or an entire thread,
down, is called "sinking" it, while
recommending it to other users is
"floating" it. Content that is recom
mended by the community will be
displayed on the front page, and
users will be able to search for what
they are interested in through hash
tags.

Avadhanula said that the app
could serve as an online talent-shar
ing hub.
"Video is a more compelling
media, in which a high percentage of
all communication is non-verbal," he
said. "Body language plays an
important part. There is a lot of tal
ent on You Tube who can participate
and show off their talent on Short
wave."
Manousos said that he has per
sonally used the app to communi
cate with friends who live overseas.
"I have a lot of friends who are
international students, and when
they were back [home], it was great
to talk to them [through the app],"
Manousos said. "It was great that
we didn't all have to be online [at the
same time]."
Pospisil said that the app would
help to facilitate communication
among on-campus groups.
"It's really great for student
organizations, sports teams and the
like," she said. According to
Manousos, Shortwave plans to
eventually release an app for
Android. For now, however, the
team is focused on gathering initial
user feedback.
"Since we've released the app on
the market, we have received a lot of
positive feedback," Manousos said.
"We're really excited."
