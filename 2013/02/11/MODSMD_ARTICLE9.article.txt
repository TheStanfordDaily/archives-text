## Palo Alto middle school investigated for response to bullying 
### â€” Justine Moore 
Investigators from the U.S. Department of Educa
tion's Office for Civil Rights have found that a Palo Alto
middle school mishandled a bullying case in which a dis
abled student was chronically victimized by classmates.
Kevin Skelley, superintendent of the Palo Alto Uni
fied School District (PAUSD), agreed to enter a resolu
tion agreement with the Office for Civil Rights in
December to avoid potential government intervention in
response to any issues uncovered. While the agreement
did not require the district to admit to violating the law,
it mandated the creation of new anti-bullying policies
and the institution of anti-bullying training programs.
The case reached the Office for Civil Rights after the
bullied student's family filed a complaint. Investigators
concluded that the school district's inability to adequate
ly resolve the issue had become a civil rights problem.
The bullied student, who was in special education, devel
oped mental health issues as a result of the bullying and

was eventually taken out of school at his doctor's recom
mendation.
The Office for Civil Rights acknowledged that the
school could not be held responsible for the student
being bullied but said that school administrators should
have thoroughly investigated the bullying and taken dis
ciplinary action against the bullies. The school also failed
to keep records of the harassment, interview student
witnesses or inform teachers about the bullied student's
complaints.
The investigators, who interviewed students, teach
ers, administrators and counselors at the school, found
that many of the students had not received training on
how to interact with students with disabilities, though
the school held training events about social kindness and
cyberbullying.
Dana Tom 'B3 M.S. 'B4, president of the PAUSD's
Board of Education, said that the district already has
policies in place to combat bullying and that the civil
rights issue arose because these policies were not cor
rectly implemented.
