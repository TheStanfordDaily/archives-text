# Card swept in L.A.

### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After a surprising loss to No.
68 TCU last Tuesday, No. 19 Stan
ford men's tennis suffered tough
defeats against No. 3 UCLA and
No. 2 USC in Los Angeles.

Stanford's first road
trip of the season could not have
gone much worse. After losing to
UCLA on Friday afternoon, the

team fell to USC, the four-time
NCAA defending champions, on
Saturday.
"Obviously we were disap
pointed not to come away with
wins, but it's always tough to go
down and do well against those
schools," said Stanford sopho
more John Morrissey, who played
No. 1 singles and doubles for the
Cardinal. "We have a pretty
young team, so I think we gained
a lot of experience and had a lot of
close matches."
In the first match of the week
end, the Cardinal lost 7-0 to the
Bruins. UCLA, which is currently
undefeated, won every match

except for No. 1 doubles, which
went unfinished. Stanford only
claimed three sets during the
entire match.
One of the closer matches of
the day was UCLA's No. 12 Mar
cos Giron vs. No. 39 Morrissey.
Morrissey lost the first set before
rallying to bring the second set to
a tiebreak, in which he fell 7-3.
"The first set was 6-2, but it
was pretty tight. I got broken
twice but I had game points in
both of those games," Morrissey
said. "It was just a question of
taking opportunities, which I

managed to do a little bit better in
the second set."
Stanford freshman Nolan Paige
also demonstrated solid play at No.
4 singles, splitting the first two sets
with No. 41 Dennis Mkrtchian of
the Bruins before falling 6-3 in the
third.
Freshman Maciek Romanowicz
and sophomore Robert Stineman,
who represented the Cardinal at
No. 3 and No. 6 singles, respective
ly, also picked up sets before even
tually being defeated.
On Saturday afternoon, the
Cardinal looked to rebound against
No. 2 USC but did not ultimately
fare much better.
The team suffered a 6-1 defeat
with Paige clinching the only win of
the day at No. 4 singles over No. 78
Max de Vroome. Paige lost the first
set 4-6 but managed to take the
second set 7-5. Because USC had
already clinched the victory over
Stanford, the third set was
replaced by a tiebreak, which Paige
won 10-8.
The only other close match was
No. 6 singles, where Robert Stine
man battled USC's Michael Grant.
Stineman lost the first set 6-3, but
fought back to win the second set
10-8 in the tiebreak before finally
falling in the tiebreak that replaced
the third set.
The rest of the singles matches

were decisive victories for USC.
With the exception of No. 3 singles
player Maciek Romanowicz, none
of Stanford's players won more
than four games. Romanowicz
managed to get five games off
USC's No. 24 Roberto Quiroz, but
still fell 6-3, 6-2.
USC was equally dominant in
doubles. Morrissey and senior
Matt Kandath, who played No. 1
doubles for the Cardinal, lost 8-2,
and No. 2 doubles team of junior
Jamin Ball and freshman Trey
Strobel fell 8-0. Romanowicz and
Stineman, who played No. 3 dou
bles for Stanford, were up 5-2 when
the match was abandoned as USC
took the doubles point.
The Cardinal is currently 3-4,
and will look to get back to .500 on
the season on Feb. 24 at Cal. The
Golden Bears, currently ranked
No. 13, also fell to UCLA and USC
this weekend in Los Angeles.
Morrissey stated that although
the team is disappointed that it did
n't qualify for the USTA/ITA
National Indoor Championships on
Feb. 15, it will put the two weeks
before its next match to good use.
"We played the nation's best
this weekend and walked away
with some things to work on," Mor
rissey said. "The break will give us
a chance to get a little rest and
focus on things we all need to work
on, so hopefully we can get our tac
tics right and be in the right mind
set against Berkeley."
