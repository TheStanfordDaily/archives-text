## Stanford remains perfect 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's tennis cap
tured consecutive 5-2 victories this
past weekend in its Southern Cali
fornia tour, beating both San Diego
and Pepperdine to remain unde
feated.

On Friday against No. 49 San
Diego, the top of the singles lineup
dominated play. Juniors Nicole
Gibbs and Kristie Ahn both posted
easy wins, despite having previous
ly lost their doubles match on court
one to San Diego's Shani Blecher
and Laura Claus 8-6. In singles,
Gibbs disposed of USD's Stephanie
Hoffpauir 6-2, 6-2 at the No. 1 spot
while Ahn gave up just three games
in her 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Blecher on
court three. Stanford also won the
doubles point in spite of the loss on
court one, winning 8-3 on court two
and 8-5 on court three.
Sophomore Ellen Tsay easily
moved past Anna Depenau 6-0, 6-2
at the N0.4 spot. On court two,
nationally No. 2 ranked freshman
Krista Hardebeck, who had been ill
with the flu earlier in the week,
dropped the first set against Claus,
but was able to pull out a win in a
third set tie breaker 3-6,6-3,7-6 (8).
"I was happy that I was able to
focus and push through," Harde
beck said. "It is tough to know
you're down a set, but your oppo
nent still has an entire set too so it's
a long ways to go for both players.
Anything can happen."
It was the back of the lineup
that struggled against San Diego.
