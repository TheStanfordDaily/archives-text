## Stanford remains perfect 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
Stanford women's tennis cap
tured consecutive 5-2 victories this
past weekend in its Southern Cali
fornia tour, beating both San Diego
and Pepperdine to remain unde
feated.

On Friday against No. 49 San
Diego, the top of the singles lineup
dominated play. Juniors Nicole
Gibbs and Kristie Ahn both posted
easy wins, despite having previous
ly lost their doubles match on court
one to San Diego's Shani Blecher
and Laura Claus 8-6. In singles,
Gibbs disposed of USD's Stephanie
Hoffpauir 6-2, 6-2 at the No. 1 spot
while Ahn gave up just three games
in her 6-2, 6-1 defeat of Blecher on
court three. Stanford also won the
doubles point in spite of the loss on
court one, winning 8-3 on court two
and 8-5 on court three.
Sophomore Ellen Tsay easily
moved past Anna Depenau 6-0, 6-2
at the N0.4 spot. On court two,
nationally No. 2 ranked freshman
Krista Hardebeck, who had been ill
with the flu earlier in the week,
dropped the first set against Claus,
but was able to pull out a win in a
third set tie breaker 3-6,6-3,7-6 (8).
"I was happy that I was able to
focus and push through," Harde
beck said. "It is tough to know
you're down a set, but your oppo
nent still has an entire set too so it's
a long ways to go for both players.
Anything can happen."
It was the back of the lineup
that struggled against San Diego.

STANFORD 5
PEPPERDINE 2
2/9, Malibu, Calif.
USD's Marta Stojanovic defeated
senior Stacey Tan in a tight
straight-set match, 6-4, 7-6 (2)
while senior captain Natalie Dillon
lost to Cara Brown in another tight
contest, 7-6 (4), 7-5.
But when Stanford traveled
north to Malibu on Saturday to
play No. 33 Pepperdine, the indi
vidual successes were reversed
even though the final score was the
same (5-2). This time, it was the
bottom end of the line up that
pulled out the team victory.
Gibbs and Hardebeck account
ed for the Cardinal's two losses.
Gibbs fell to Pepperdine's Lorraine
Guillermo 7-5, 6-1 while nationally
ranked No. 92 Khunpak Issara
came back in dramatic fashion to
beat the Card's No. 2 Krista Hard
ebeck after being shut out the first
set (0-6, 6-4,1-0 (6)).

"Obviously it's a lot more fun to
win than lose," Hardebeck said,
"but you can learn a lot from situa
tions like that. [lssara] started set
ting up her game nicely after the
first set, and I didn't make the
changes that I needed to in order
to prevent her from keeping
momentum."
Though the rare losses from
Gibbs and Hardebeck were frus
trating, they came after Stanford
had already clinched the match by
going up 4-0.
"The main goal is a team win, so
it was a little bit of a relief when I
found out we had won after losing
my second set," Hardebeck said.
"We played a ten-point tiebreaker
after though instead of a third set,
which can be a coin toss at times."
She also noted that whether or
not the players are aware of where
the team scores depends on the
location of the match. At Stanford,
all six match scores are posted on a
large screen. At Pepperdine, there
was no indicator for the players.
"You have to focus on yourself

though," she said. "Don't let any
thing else get to you."
Gibbs also was unable to pull out
a team point with Ahn on the No. 1
doubles court for the second match
in a row to Pepperdine's Guillermo/
Issara duo 8-2.
"Nicole has a very mature mind
set," Hardebeck said. "We all know
that one loss won't define your
career at the end of the day. You just
have to let it go and continue to
work hard."
With that, it's back to another
week of practice for the Cardinal
before it faces Saint Mary's this
weekend.
"I think that we are all just going
to keep working on match play and
sets, as well as our mental tough
ness," Hardebeck said. "We will
keep building the base that we
already have."
Stanford will host the Gaels this
Saturday at noon at the Taube
Family Tennis Courts.

Gibbs fell to Pepperdine's Lorraine
Guillermo 7-5, 6-1 while nationally
ranked No. 92 Khunpak Issara
came back in dramatic fashion to
beat the Card's No. 2 Krista Hard
ebeck after being shut out the first
set (0-6, 6-4,1-0 (6)).

"Obviously it's a lot more fun to
win than lose," Hardebeck said,
"but you can learn a lot from situa
tions like that. [lssara] started set
ting up her game nicely after the
first set, and I didn't make the
changes that I needed to in order
to prevent her from keeping
momentum."
Though the rare losses from
Gibbs and Hardebeck were frus
trating, they came after Stanford
had already clinched the match by
going up 4-0.
"The main goal is a team win, so
it was a little bit of a relief when I
found out we had won after losing
my second set," Hardebeck said.
"We played a ten-point tiebreaker
after though instead of a third set,
which can be a coin toss at times."
She also noted that whether or
not the players are aware of where
the team scores depends on the
location of the match. At Stanford,
all six match scores are posted on a
large screen. At Pepperdine, there
was no indicator for the players.
"You have to focus on yourself

though," she said. "Don't let any
thing else get to you."
Gibbs also was unable to pull out
a team point with Ahn on the No. 1
doubles court for the second match
in a row to Pepperdine's Guillermo/
Issara duo 8-2.
"Nicole has a very mature mind
set," Hardebeck said. "We all know
that one loss won't define your
career at the end of the day. You just
have to let it go and continue to
work hard."
With that, it's back to another
week of practice for the Cardinal
before it faces Saint Mary's this
weekend.
"I think that we are all just going
to keep working on match play and
sets, as well as our mental tough
ness," Hardebeck said. "We will
keep building the base that we
already have."
Stanford will host the Gaels this
Saturday at noon at the Taube
Family Tennis Courts.
