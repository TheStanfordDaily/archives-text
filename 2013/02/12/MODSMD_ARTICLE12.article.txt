Victims' Reparation: What
Lessons Can We Take From
the International Criminal
Court?
As explained by Professor
Cherif Bassiouni on Jan. 29 at the
CDDRL Program on Human
Rights Sanela Diana Jenkins
Speakers Series, victims before the
International Criminal Court (the
ICC) have rights that combine the
practice in proceedings of two dif
ferent legal systems: the Civil Law
and the Common Law system.
Through direct victim represen
tation, an important aspect of the
civil law system, those who have
suffered severe abuses may pres
ent to the ICC their points of view
to the judges. In the civil system,
this is important because it allows
the prosecutor to assess harm and
damages suffered and request cor
responding reparations. In com
mon law systems, victim represen
tation is more central in civil cases,
though increasingly the perspec
tive of victims has been relevant
during criminal sentencing.
In the ICC, victims are not
required to participate in the court
proceedings and the court may
even decide on its own to make an
award for reparations. That is,
independent of any motion by the
prosecutor, the victim may also
seek reparation directly from the
ICC through the Trust Fund for
Victims, an independent body of
the court charged with implement
ing the court's decisions and pro
viding physical and psychosocial
rehabilitation and material support
to victims of crimes within the
jurisdiction of the ICC. Further
more, the Trust Fund for Victims at
the ICC can also act to benefit vic
tims of crimes even when there is
no conviction.
Why is this a valuable lesson?
Suppose that the defendant
accused of horrendous crimes does
not have sufficient assets to cover
the damages imposed onto the vic
tim? In many countries including
the United States, reparations are
often based on the defendant's abil
ity to pay. Apart from a few cases of
restitution for sex crimes in the
United States, governments sel
dom take responsibility for losses
and suffering caused by private
individuals, leaving victims to their
own resources, their personal
insurance and their own means to
recover and rehabilitate. When that
happens, is justice done?
What do victims want? From
years of researching and working
with victims of human rights abuse
including victims of war crimes in
the context of Angola and, more
recently, in the Democratic Repub
lic of Congo (DRC), the sentencing
of perpetrators is only one of the
elements of justice as understood
by victims. Victims and survivors
usually ask for guarantees that the
crimes and violation of rights will
not take place again. They want
restitution to re-establish the lives
they had before the violations took
place, and they need support so

they and their communities can
work to overcome the severe psy
chological consequences affecting
generations of victims' descen
dants.
The ICC Trust Fund for Victims
needs to raise funds to support the
reparations it grants. Contributors
to the fund are states, private
donors, foundations and individuals
that wish to support victims and
communities that see the ICC as
last resort. The Trust Fund for Vic
tims is far from perfect. It strug
gles to ensure sufficient funds to
sustain victims' requested repara
tions, and it is not well equipped to
establish reparations in cases of
collective application. However, as
the idealism that created the ICC
in the first place, the ICC Trust
Fund sends a signal of great rele
vance: reparations are an impor
tant representation of the justice
process for victims of human rights
abuse.
When the International Crimi
nal Court (the ICC) issued its first
decision on reparations of victims
in the case of Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo, convicted in March of 2012
for conscripting, enlisting and
using child soldiers in the DRC
it established an important prece
dent in victims' agency in the iden
tification of needs and in the design
of reparations. This precedent can
be a valuable lesson to the justice
systems in many countries includ
ing the United States. As the ICC
enters its second decade, let us
learn the lessons that can become
pillars in the expansion of interna
tional justice and may one day
establish jurisprudence that bene
fits victims within the countries.

Victims and
survivors usually
ask for some
guarantees that
the crimes and
violation of rights
will not take place
again.
