# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Unanswered Food Truck Questions 
### 
Susan Weinstein's letter to the
editor entitled "Stanford Food
Trucks Policy Changes" was
nothing short of detritus.
Now, I really couldn't care less
about the food trucks, as I don't eat
at them. However, I do care about
accountability. The editorial gave us
a timeline of events, for which I am
thankful, but it failed to answer a
single important question. I voiced
these questions in the comment sec
tion and was disappointed to see
that after three days, there was no
response any of the comments. I'll
voice my questions again, slightly
tweaked:
1) How much does it cost for a
vendor to register with Off the Grid
(OTG)? This isn't just an issue of
money. How much autonomy do
they cede? Can they continue to set
then own hours, menus, locations,
etc? I find it hard to believe that
OTG doesn't cost something in mon
etary or human terms.
2) If you're concerned about
health and licenses, what the hell
were you doing before the new poli
cy? Were vendors like NetAppetit

not being checked at all? Is it impos
sible to check a vendor's qualifica
tions and licenses without having
them register with an outside
agency?
3) Is what happened fair? Sub
jective question, I know. One could
make the argument that having all
vendors register with OTG is natu
rally fair. But that raises the ques
tion of how many of the trucks cur
rently slated for winter quarter
were already in the OTG fleet? If
that number is high, then no, it's not
fan. Moreover, if it costs a lot of
money or autonomy to join OTG,
then no, it's not fair.
4) NetAppetit seems to be an
exception due to the guy's populari
ty, quality, price, charity and
longevity. If you have the power to
alter a rule, why not alter it?
5) An addition: Where are the
minutes to the meetings that were
held on this issue? Please release
them. If the devilish details we seek
are in there, then the issue should
be settled pretty quickly.
