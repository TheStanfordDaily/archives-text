# Technology, Mental Health and the Art of Listening

### Taylor Brady 
My worst moment at Stan
ford came last year when,
in a fit of insomnia and
stress, I lashed out at the most
humanistic person that I know.
"Why do you stay up so late and
talk to people?" I snapped. "You
just make your life worse. Go to
bed."
Of course I have been signifi
cantly more depressed than I was
that night. Yet in retrospect, that
malicious outburst was the nadir. It
reflected the worst effect that
undergraduate culture here can
have upon us. We become frantic
Formicidae, unable ever to stop.
In contrast, my best moment
here occurred during my sopho
more year. Spooning lunch onto my
plate, I had a sudden inspiration:
"I'm not going to say a single word
during this entire meal." For the
next hour, all that I did was
observe my housemates. I watched
the twitch of my friend's mouth
when she spoke about her
boyfriend. Disarray and dirtiness
of clothing mirrored, on another
friend, how harrowed his face was.
In short, I was attuned to the not
so-subtle subtle signs that
absolutely scream how a person is
really "doing." Most of the time,
it's not simply "fine."
My housemate forgave me for
my late-night transgression, but
only now can I tell her that I've
learned my lesson. What that
splendid young woman remem
bered and what I forgot that
evening was that conversations
cannot be multitasked. You must
listen as well as you hear (see Mike
+ the Mechanics, "Living Years,"
1989). Analogously, you must con
verse as well as you chat. You can
not cultivate meaningful relation
ships with people if you resent the
time that it takes to form them and
consequently only stop for a chat.
Profundity is not efficient. You
cannot code it. It can only be found
by exhausting substantial amounts
of your time diving in search of it.
Deep conversation suffers, espe
cially at a university that worships
technological productivity, from

Baumol's cost disease. Conversa
tions take at least two people and a
lot of time, as they have for millen
nia. Dedicating more computing
power or anything else does noth
ing to get the job done faster.
I've taken to shutting off my
phone when I converse. That
addict's itch to clutch at the touch
screen as soon as it vibrates is my
greatest pet peeve. I broke up with
somebody years back because she
couldn't kick the habit. Emails,
Facebook notifications, the Ã¼biqui
tous text message each is like a
hammer stroke from the neighbor
next door who, for some incompre
hensible reason, is renovating his
deck at six in the morning. If you
heed these calls, you are unequivo
cally demonstrating that they are
more important than the person
before you.
I'm convinced that the greatest
failing of Stanford undergraduates
is simultaneously overestimating
and underestimating the time that
we have left on Earth. When
underestimating, we often choose
selfish hedonism or the frantic pur
suit of academic knowledge. Over
estimating, we neglect human rela
tionships and again frantically pur
sue knowledge.
And at times, burying yourself
in a book is perfectly justified. Stu
dents here are literally curing can
cer, finding ways to mitigate envi
ronmental disasters or designing
bridges that won't fall down in an
earthquake. Yet just as those wor
thy pursuits take discipline and
sacrifice, so does forging human
connections. You can't estimate the
grains left in your life's hourglass,
but we must decide to dedicate
more of them to other people. Since
we aren't selfless often enough,
many of us are increasingly mental
ly ill.
For a more thorough discussion
of mental health at Stanford, please
see the four-part series written by
Kristian Davis Bailey. While well
composed, I think that this collec
tion misses the mark. These arti
cles still labor under the epistemol
ogy of an institution that is funda

mentally stressful and that actively
encourages self-absorption. They
ask: how can University and com
munity resources keep you healthy
enough to literally survive here?
Stop looking to the institution to
provide you this answer. Certain
psychological treatment can and
should only be provided by trained
professionals, and this is where the
University is and must be held
accountable. Altogether too often,
though, we sacrifice our own
agency under the false impression
that there is nothing we can do.
There is something you can do.
Stop.
Bother to find out what is really
going on in the life of a human
being to whom you have even the
vaguest connection. They won't tell
you if you ask directly. They proba
bly won't reveal their vulnerabili
ties upon first inquiry. It takes
time, something we all believe that
we don't have. That false assump
tion knells in the stillness of the
night and resonates in the first
floor of Meyer. Stanford's next
architectural alteration should be
to demolish the clock tower.
Here's my challenge for the
week: don't say a word during one
conversation. Listen. Observe,
carefully. Ze's not fine, really. He's
probably sadder than you think.
She would love to just talk to some
body.
If we start stopping time for one
another, on a regular basis, we
might stop time from running out
for a few of our classmates every
year.
