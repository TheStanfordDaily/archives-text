# TOO FAST
## Kori Carter breaks own hurdles record 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend, Stanford track
and field adopted the motto "divide
and conquer" as it split to compete in
two different meets. Twenty distance
runners headed north to Seattle,
Wash., in their third return to the
Dempsey indoor facilities, while 18
sprinters and field event experts headed
south to Albuquerque, N.M., for the
Don Kirby Collegiate Elite Invitational.
By the time the squads reconvened
after the weekend back at Stanford, the
Cardinal had picked up one school
record and nine season bests.
Junior Kori Carter's raging 8.17-sec
ond finish in the 60-meter hurdles was
chief among the successes from the
meet in Albuquerque. The blistering
time secured a Stanford indoor record,
besting out her own previous record of
8.22. Her fellow junior teammate and
No. 2 record-holder Katie Nelms fin
ished fourth with a time of 8.35.
Franklin P Johnson Director of Track
and Field Chris Miltenberg has repeat
edly named Carter and Nelms as "two
of the top hurdlers in the country," and
they haven't failed to live up to his
praise.
In only his third competition of the
indoor season, senior Jules Sharpe once
again blew away the high jump competi
tion. Shaipe jumped seven feet, three
and a quarter inches to beat his own
personal record of seven feet, 3 inches.
Shaipe finished behind Kansas State
jumper Erik Kynard, the silver medalist
in the high jump from London. Sharpe's
consistency and composure under pres
sure has helped him finish among the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation top
six in his past three seasons.
Men's captain and senior shot putter
Geoffrey Tabor came up just short of his
personal record of 58 feet and 7.5 inches

by under two inches to place fourth in
the competition.
The meet in Albuquerque also con
tributed to the development of fresh
men standout twins, Kaitlyn and
Kristyn Willliams. Overall, however, the
two were personally disappointed by
their race. In their first open 400-meter
race of the season, the two ran well, but
not as fast as they would like to be run
ning two weeks before the MPSF cham
pionships.
"I definitely didn't feel like I was 100
percent in my 400," Kaitlyn Williams
said, "but I'm ready to take the race on
again in Seattle at the [MPSF] champi
onships."
Although the distance team was
almost 1500 miles away in Seattle, it had
similar stories of success in its events at
the Husky Invitational. Freshman Amy
Weissenbach matched and exceeded her
performances from previous weekends,
running a 2:05.83 800-meter race, just
.15 seconds slower than the school
indoor record. As she matures as a run
ner and learns to fight from being boxed
in, Weissenbach will pose a serious
threat to the school's all-around 800-
meter record of 2:03.54.
Junior Michael Atchoo, who finished
first in the mile last weekend in New
York, ran his season-best time of 8:00.73
in the 3000-meter competition. Sopho
more teammate Joe Rosa dropped six
seconds off of his personal best in the
same race, finishing at 8:08.14.
Although the focus this past week
end was on individual races, the men's
distance medley relay, made up of pow
erhouses like Atchoo and Rosa, is
already preparing to take on Oregon in
the upcoming conference champi
onships.
Now the team is looking to take
advantage of its week off, as it take a
step back from competition to mentally
prepare for its return to the Dempsey
track in Seattle on Feb. 22-23 for the
MPSF championships.
