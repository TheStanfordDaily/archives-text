# PAR FOR THE COURSE
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Senior Steve Kearney's career-best fourth
place finish at eight under par led Stanford
men's golf to seventh place in the Amer Ari
Invitational at the Waikoloa Kings' Course on
the Big Island of Hawai'i.
After finishing the first and second rounds in
eight and ninth place respectively, Stanford
made a charge toward the top of the leader
board. The Cardinal peaked in a tie for fourth
place before falling victim to tough headwinds
and dropping back to seventh.
In the end though, it was the start, and not
the finish, that really hurt Stanford. On Wednes
day, junior Cameron Wilson (+2), freshman
David Boote (+1) and sophomore Patrick
Rodgers (+5) all had their worst rounds of the
tournament, leaving the Cardinal in a tie for
eighth place at one under par after the opening
round.
Kearney was one of two Stanford golfers
senior Andrew Yun (-1) being the other to
open the tournament on a high-note, shooting a
three under par 69 in Wednesday's first round.
After an even-par 72 on Thursday, Kearney
roared back for an impressive five under par
67.
"My driving accuracy was definitely one of
my strong points," Kearney told
GoStanford.com. "I only missed a few fairways
these last three days and that really set me up
to play well."
Kearney came in seven shots ahead of Stan
ford's next-best finisher, Andrew Yun, who fol
lowed up his opening-round 71 with consecu
tive even-par rounds to earn a tie for 26th place

at one under par. Wilson and Boote tied for
34th place one shot behind Yun at even par,
while Rodgers battled back from a disastrous
opening-round 77 to get back to two over par
and a tie for 49th.
In a testament to the fickleness of golf,
Rodgers actually thought he hit the ball better
during his first-round 77 than his second-round
70. Rodgers credited improvement in managing
his round to shave seven shots off of his score.
Junior Shane Lebow competed as an indi
vidual his score could not count for the Stan
ford team. Lebow finished in a tie for 70th
place at six over par.
Pac-12 schools No. 6 UCLA and No. 4
Washington tied for first atop the 20-team tour
nament field at 22 under par. Senior AU-Amer
ican Dominic Bozzelli of Auburn won the indi
vidual title, following up an opening-round 70
with a 68 and a 67 to win by two strokes at 11
under par.
The invitational featured seven of
Golfweek's top-14 teams, with the six teams
that finished ahead of the Cardinal this week
all ranked ahead of Stanford.
"We're happy with the way the guys battled
today," The Knowles Family Director of Golf
Conrad Ray told GoStanford "We wish we were a
few slots up in the leaderboard but that's golf and
it is awful close."
Stanford heads to La Quinta, Calif, next
Monday for The Prestige at PGA West. The
Cardinal will get another shot at the Amer Ari
Invitational co-champions Washington and
UCLA, who are among the favorites in the
competitive 15-team field.
