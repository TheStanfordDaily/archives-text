Though Stanford is famous for its curv
ing arches and red-tiled roofs of its Mission
Revival-style architecture, the campus
hosts other architectural gems represent
ing a campus split between old and new.
Among those gems is the Hanna House,
designed by world-renowned architect
Frank Lloyd Wright.
"Something like Hanna House is a per
fect example of where techie and fuzzy cul
ture meets," said Erik Johnson M.A. 'l2
Ph.D. 'l6, a Ph.D. candidate in the English
Department.. "If you're interested in engi
neering, what you're interested in is mak
ing things like that, that shape people's
experiences."
Last spring, quarter Johnson taught a
Program in Writing and Rhetoric course
titled The Rhetoric of What Counts as Art.
As part of the course, Johnson and
brought his students to tour the house,
which sits tucked away just past the Upper
Row, its existence little known to students.
"Frankly, if people don't take advantage
of and appreciate things like [Hanna
House] then they disappear," Johnson said.
Few students, however, do seem to take
advantage of this opportunity. Chris Carl
ton, a Cantor Arts Center docent who leads
tours at the house on the weekends, esti
mates that around only eight students a
month torn- the house.Last spring, Erik

The Hanna House was built to bring to
life the dream of childhood education spe
cialists Jean and Paul Hanna. Both grew up
as the children of itinerant pastors, with
childhoods spent moving from rental house
to rental house. After meeting and falling
in love, they decided they wanted to build
and own their own home. With Wright as
their architect, however, the end result was
anything but ordinary.
The Hanna House has exactly two right
angles; the rest are 120 degrees. The entire
house is built on a grid of hexagons,
prompting an alternate name of "the hon-
