## Hanna House showcases Wright's style "Honeycomb house" shares long history with University, visitors

Though Stanford is famous for its curv
ing arches and red-tiled roofs of its Mission
Revival-style architecture, the campus
hosts other architectural gems represent
ing a campus split between old and new.
Among those gems is the Hanna House,
designed by world-renowned architect
Frank Lloyd Wright.
"Something like Hanna House is a per
fect example of where techie and fuzzy cul
ture meets," said Erik Johnson M.A. 'l2
Ph.D. 'l6, a Ph.D. candidate in the English
Department.. "If you're interested in engi
neering, what you're interested in is mak
ing things like that, that shape people's
experiences."
Last spring, quarter Johnson taught a
Program in Writing and Rhetoric course
titled The Rhetoric of What Counts as Art.
As part of the course, Johnson and
brought his students to tour the house,
which sits tucked away just past the Upper
Row, its existence little known to students.
"Frankly, if people don't take advantage
of and appreciate things like [Hanna
House] then they disappear," Johnson said.
Few students, however, do seem to take
advantage of this opportunity. Chris Carl
ton, a Cantor Arts Center docent who leads
tours at the house on the weekends, esti
mates that around only eight students a
month torn- the house.Last spring, Erik

The Hanna House was built to bring to
life the dream of childhood education spe
cialists Jean and Paul Hanna. Both grew up
as the children of itinerant pastors, with
childhoods spent moving from rental house
to rental house. After meeting and falling
in love, they decided they wanted to build
and own their own home. With Wright as
their architect, however, the end result was
anything but ordinary.
The Hanna House has exactly two right
angles; the rest are 120 degrees. The entire
house is built on a grid of hexagons,
prompting an alternate name of "the hon-
eycomb house." In
keeping with Wright's theory of
organic architecture, the house isn't
built on top of the hill but built to
blend in with it and the rest of the
environment. A cypress and an oak
tree, for example, were present
before the designing of the house but
were not removed during construc
tion. Instead Wright designed the
house to be built around the trees as
if they themselves were a part of the
home.
"Wright is great at controlling
the environment in away that man
ages your experience but not in a
manipulative way because you're
always mindful and aware of it,"
Johnson said.
According to Carlton, the fact
that Wright was one of the most
famous architects at the time didn't
really register with the Hannas. By
contrast, they had simply read a
paper about his philosophy of organ
ic architecture and promptly pro
ceeded to write him a fan letter.
While Wright eventually agreed
to design the house, when the family
eventually moved into the residence
in 1938 a year after construction
began work wasn't quite done.
Instead, Wright had created the
house to constantly adapt to the fam
ily's changing needs over the years.
"The whole concept, the thought
process behind it in terms of think
ing about it as a honeycomb and how
strong the honeycomb is for the bee
colony and the application to the
family I thought that was really
unique in terms of the flexibility that
he was trying to build into a struc
ture," Carlton said.
A guesthouse was eventually
added and when the three children
moved out, walls were taken down to
expand the living and work spaces

for Jean and Paul.
Wright's influence extends far
beyond Hanna House, of course.
Named in 1991 as the greatest
American architect of all time by the
American Institute of Architects, his
other creations include the Guggen
heim Museum in New York City, the
Johnson Wax Headquarters in
Racine, Wis., and the Imperial Hotel
in Tokyo. A couple in attendance at a
Feb. 9 torn - of Hanna House said
they lived in a house heavily influ
enced by Wright's works.
"We lived in the Bay Area all our
fives but we never knew the house
was here," said Joyce Scatena, who
said she and her husband found the
Hanna House through a Google
search. "As we walked around the
house, we went, 'Oh my god, that's
like the tile in our bathroom, that's
like our windows in the front.'"
Today the Hanna House exists
more as a museum than a place of
residence. The Hanna House Board
of Governors made this decision after
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake
damaged the house extensively.
John Hanna '54 J.D. '59, a son of
Jean and Paul and a member of the
Board of Governors, recalled an
enjoyable childhood growing up in
the house.
"We knew it was special because
there were always curiosity seekers
and photographers coming to the
house all hours of the day with their
cameras poised, peeking into the
windows and taking pictures," Han
na said.
The Hannas donated the house to
Stanford in 1975 and it served over
the years as the home for four
provosts. Now a graduate student is
assigned as caretaker and lives in the
guesthouse.
"There's something besides foot
ball on this campus," Scatena said.
"It's right here, and it's absolutely
beautiful."

Hanna House is unique for both a history intertwined with that of the
University - including serving as a residence for four provosts - and the
identity of its architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.
