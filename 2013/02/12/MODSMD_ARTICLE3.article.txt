The line between heroism and villainy;
the relationship between the individual
and the community; the long-lasting
appeal of tales of endurance. For Angela
Becerra Vidergar, a Ph.D. candidate in
comparative literature, screening clips
from the CBS reality show "Survivor" to
her class last spring quarter was simply
an entertaining way to launch some of the
course's thematic discussions.
She was also unsuspectingly giving
one of her students, Julia Landauer 'l4,
tips on how to play the game.
Landauer, a 21-year-old professional
race car driver and Stanford undergrad
uate, recently spoke to The Daily about

end of last June, contractual obligations
prevented her from speaking about how
she played the game or where she placed
among fellow cast members.

Starting this Wednesday at 8 p.m.,
however, members of Stanford communi
ty can begin to see for themselves how
Landauer fared when CBS premieres the
first 90-minute episode of "Survivor:
Caramoan."
Landauer, for one, expressed excite
ment at being able to finally share with
friends and teachers what had been such
a tightly guarded secret for a long-time.
Despite being officially selected as a con
testant last April, she was not allowed to
tell anyone about her participation on the
show until CBS made its official casting
announcement this January.
That lack of disclosure included Vider
gar, whose comparative literature lec
tures had an unsuspected resonance due
to Landauer's upcoming participation on
the show.
"I wanted to tell that teacher so bad
that I was going to be on 'Survivor,' but I
couldn't," Landauer said. "She showed us
clips of [former cast members], explain
ing why they played good games or why
they hadn't played good games. So actu
ally, this teacher was unknowingly giving
