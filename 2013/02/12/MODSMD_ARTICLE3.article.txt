# STANFORD'S "SURVIVOR'
## JULIA LANDAUER 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The line between heroism and villainy;
the relationship between the individual
and the community; the long-lasting
appeal of tales of endurance. For Angela
Becerra Vidergar, a Ph.D. candidate in
comparative literature, screening clips
from the CBS reality show "Survivor" to
her class last spring quarter was simply
an entertaining way to launch some of the
course's thematic discussions.
She was also unsuspectingly giving
one of her students, Julia Landauer 'l4,
tips on how to play the game.
Landauer, a 21-year-old professional
race car driver and Stanford undergrad
uate, recently spoke to The Daily about
competing on the latest season of the
long-running reality series, which chroni
cles the adventures of 20 contestants who
must outlast each other after being
stranded on a remote island. While film
ing of Landauer's season finished at the
end of last June, contractual obligations
prevented her from speaking about how
she played the game or where she placed
among fellow cast members.

Starting this Wednesday at 8 p.m.,
however, members of Stanford communi
ty can begin to see for themselves how
Landauer fared when CBS premieres the
first 90-minute episode of "Survivor:
Caramoan."
Landauer, for one, expressed excite
ment at being able to finally share with
friends and teachers what had been such
a tightly guarded secret for a long-time.
Despite being officially selected as a con
testant last April, she was not allowed to
tell anyone about her participation on the
show until CBS made its official casting
announcement this January.
That lack of disclosure included Vider
gar, whose comparative literature lec
tures had an unsuspected resonance due
to Landauer's upcoming participation on
the show.
"I wanted to tell that teacher so bad
that I was going to be on 'Survivor,' but I
couldn't," Landauer said. "She showed us
clips of [former cast members], explain
ing why they played good games or why
they hadn't played good games. So actu
ally, this teacher was unknowingly giving

"Survivor,"which was filmed in the Philippines. Landauer, who cannot disclose
details of the season before it airs, reflected positively on her participation.
me a little bit more insight and a
little bit more ideas as to how to
play the game."
Landauer's friends have organ
ized a premiere screening this
Wednesday at her Robinson dorm
lounge, an appropriately named ven
ue given the show's parallels to one
of literature's most famous stranded
island narratives, "Robinson Cru
soe." The event's Facebook page
jokes about coconuts and rice being
served, two of the few food items
that Survivor's "castaways" are able
to eat during the game.
Miranda Mammen 'l4, Lan
dauer's sophomore year roommate,
will not be able to attend the pre
miere screening, as she is currently
studying abroad at the University of
Oxford. She will, however, be rooting
for Landauer from the other side of
the Atlantic.
"I think this can be a really amaz
ing opportunity for Julia, especially
with her goals to become a profes
sional race car driver," Mammen
said. "This can be the perfect chance
for her to get some media play and
get people to understand what she is
capable of and how driven she is. I am
excited for her."
Preparing for the game
With Mammen's help, Landauer
filmed a video application last Janu
ary in hopes of being cast on the
show.
Sitting in the Main Quad, decked
in her racing gear, Landauer laid out
the reasons why she should be should
be selected as a contestant. She
talked about her racing career, her
distinction as the first female
NASCAR driver from New York
City, her experience trying to develop
her racing brand and her status as a
full-time Stanford student majoring
in Science, Technology and Society
(STS). Landauer said it was the com
bination of all these attributes that
made her think that she would be a
good fit for "Survivor."
"I really thought I could bring
something special to the table, a com
bination of the whole competitive
edge I have from racing, and my ana
lytical nature from being at school,
and then my personality, being able
to balance being ruthless and work
ing with others," she said. "I thought
'Survivor' would be a really cool place
to show all of these skills, so I sent in
my video."
From there, producers conducted
a background check on Landauer
and subsequently called her down to
Los Angeles for a final round of inter
views.
Mammen was one of the individu
als CBS called up during the back
ground check.
"The background check was a
pretty funny experience because I
had never done anything like that
before," Mammen said. "They asked
me: 'What are some of Julia's biggest
strengths?' [and] 'Does Julia have
problems with drugs or alcohol?'
Stuff like that. Julia is so easy to give
a background check for because she's
so upfront and has a lot of great qual
ities. That was not a stressful part of
my job."
Knowing that if she was cast on
the show, filming would take place
during the months of May and June,
Landauer began contacting profes
sors during winter quarter to see if
they would be willing to accommo
date her finishing their spring quar
ter courses early. Since she could not
tell them that she was in considera
tion for a slot on "Survivor," she told
professors that she was "pursuing a
racing opportunity."
Landauer ended up finding three
classes, totaling 14 units, whose pro
fessors agreed to work with her to
have all of her coursework due before
the end of week six. In order to
ensure that the Honor Code was not
violated, Landauer enrolled in cours
es that evaluated students on the
basis of final papers instead of in
class examinations.

Midway through spring quarter,
however, Landauer had still not

heard back from the show's produc
ers.
"I didn't know if I had gotten it,"
Landauer said. "I hadn't gotten any
confirmation, and I was like, 'Oh no,
what if I don't get it, and then I've
just finished my ten-week quarter up
in five? What am I going to do with
my other five weeks? Am I just going
to stay around and Camp Stanford,
or am I going to go and do other rac
ing?"'
Neither option ended up being
necessary. Towards the end of April,
she officially received the news that
she had been cast on the 26th season
of the series.
Landauer said that she immedi
ately began preparing to compete on
the show by practicing survival skills
like fire making, targeting specific
muscles through special racing work
out routines and marathon-watching
past seasons of "Survivor." She said
that reviewing these past seasons
gave her a better idea of the level of
strategy and deception that would be
necessaiy to win the game and the $1
million prize.
"Basically, my days consisted of
going to class, doing homework,
watching 'Survivor,' and going to the
gym, and eating from time to time,"
she said.
Anticipating the limited amount
of food that would be available during
the filming of "Survivor," in which
contestants often feel the effects of
starvation, Landauer decided to
experiment with her diet and severe
ly restricted her daily caloric intake
for a couple of weeks. She reversed
her strategy, however, when she
decided that it might be better to
pack on some extra pounds before
heading out to the Caramoan Islands.
"I was like, 'I don't want to start
off really small and then end up real
ly, really small,"' Landauer said.
While Landauer said that she
would have trained more if she hasn't
been a full-time student her accel
erated courses required her to finish
midterm papers by the end of week
three and her final papers by week
five she ended up feeling content
with the level of preparation she put
in before ever setting foot in the
Philippines.
During filming, Landauer could
not contact anyone back home. Mam
men, having participated in the appli
cation process, was one of the few
who knew why
"I missed her a lot, but the main
thing that was hard was not her
being gone, but her being completely
out of communication," Mammen
said. "I was excited for her though
because I knew it was something that
she really wanted to do."
Finding celebrity
Landauer woke up early on Jan.
11, the first time that CBS publicly
revealed the cast for the next season
of "Survivor," so she could finally
share the news with friends. That
same day, Landauer's Facebook page
crossed the 1,000 likes mark for the
first time.
"Social media kind of exploded
that day" Landauer said. "It was
really cool, and it was just fun to be
able to surprise everyday. Some peo
ple were really impressed, and some
people were really confused, but
overall... I got a lot of love."
Being cast on "Survivor" means
joining the very vocal and very
active "Survivor" fan community,
whose speculation about contestants
take up entire blogs and Internet
forums. Landauer has taken this part
of the experience in stride, even in
the instances where commenters
have not been entirely kind. She post
ed a picture on her Facebook page
Sunday night, which collected some
of the pettier comments that have
made about her on the "Survivor"
page.
She said some of the fans' assess
ments, however, are substantive and
fun to read.

"I kind of like seeing their cri
tique, and it will be interesting to see,
throughout the season, how I fared in
their eyes," Landauer said. "Not too
[much] though because I don't want
to drive myself crazy reading all of
these reviews, but I think 'Survivor'
fans really remind me of NASCAR
fans."

"They are very, very loyal," she
added. "Once you become a 'Sur
vivor' fan, you become one for life,
and it's really the same with
NASCAR and racing."
One of the most frequent com
ments that have been made about
Landauer on online "Survivor"
forums is one comparing her to
Sophie Clarke, a previous cast mem
ber who emerged victorious during
her "South Pacific" season of the
show. At the time, Clark was a 22-
year-old medical student from New
York, who became known primarily
for her analytical mind and occasion
ally condescending attitude.
"I think the whole student aspect
really anchors that comparison,"
Landauer said. "I just think she was
really analytical, and so am 1... Ido
agree that she did have some more
condescending moments, but I didn't
as much."
"It's a cool comparison though
because she played a really great
game, but I definitely think that I'm a
little different in personality ways,"
she added.
Vidergar, who is a long-time fan of
the show, favors a different compari
son. She said Landauer reminded
her of Yul Kwon '97, a Stanford alum
nus who claimed the title of "Sole
Survivor" during the 13th season of
the show. Entertainment Weekly has
named Kwon "one of the smartest
players ever" when ranking past
"Survivor" contestants.
"I like to think that Julia will be a
hero character just because my
experience with her is very posi
tive," Vidergar said. "She has a very
positive demeanor. She's very hard
working. And she's very good at
dealing with pressure, like many
Stanford students who have a lot of
balls in the air that they are able to
juggle very successfully. I think all of
those traits make her a very strong
person who would probably carry
that strength over into the game,
both as an individual and as someone
who is able to form bonds and con
nections with others."
"Some of the most effective and
beloved 'Survivor' winners have
done so by being successful both as
an individual and as members of
their community, along with having
a greater awareness of the ethical
choices that all survivors have to
contend with," she added. "I think
that's something that Julia can be
really well-prepared for."
Jeff Probst, the show's host,
released his own assessment of the
cast last Thursday.
"Julia is fascinating to me simply
because she's only 20 years old, and
she's already accomplished so
much," he said. "She's a race car
driver. She's a student. Super high
IQ."
Probst added a brief caveat, how
ever, noting that "Survivor" would
present Landauer with different
challenges than what she might have
experienced previously.
"Everything that she goes in her
life is in someway individual pur
suits, and this is very much a group
dynamic," he said. "If you go inward
in this game, you're done."
Landauer said the critique is fair,
and something she considered while
playing the game, but that it may
underestimate how much a group
sport racing can be.
"You don't pass the ball to each
other in the way that you might in
other sports, but I convey what has
happened to the crew chief, who
talks to the mechanic, and I have to
have a good bond with the mechan
ics," Landauer said. "I think people
underestimate how important mesh
ing with the team is to racing.
Last weekend, Landauer partici
pated in a race at the Sonoma Race
way. During spring quarter, she will
be racing once every month.
"No matter how far she gets, I
think it's a really amazing thing that
she was able to have that experi
ence, and I'm really proud of her,"
Vidergar said. "We are very excited
to hear about Julia, and it's really
amazing to see one of my students
who we really admire be a contest
ant on the show."
