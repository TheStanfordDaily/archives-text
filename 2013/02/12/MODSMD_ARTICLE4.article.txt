# ASSU Exec enjoys high pay, perks
## Student body leaders better paid than at many peer institutions 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The California sun is not the only perk for Stanford's
student government leaders, with the president of the
Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU)
enjoying a relatively large stipend and several unique
privileges compared to his peers at other elite institu
tions.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3, current president of
the ASSU, received a $8,750 salary for the year and
split a $2,750 summer stipend with ASSU Vice Presi
dent William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 to pay for summer
housing on campus.
The ASSU President is also a non-voting member on
the Faculty Senate and is given the opportunity to
enroll as a half-time student at a 50 percent tuition rate.
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 estimated that only four undergraduates on
campus are allowed to enroll half-time.
Salaries and perks for student body presidents vary
at colleges around the country, with some, like the Har
vard Undergraduate Council president and the presi
dent of the Yale College Council, receiving no pay and
others, such as the University of Central Florida stu
dent body president, receiving $20,000 per year in addi
tion to benefits like free cell phones and parking pass
es, money for meals and opportunities to meet celebri
ties who visit campus.
Zimbroff said that other than free admission to
football and basketball games â€”he has received no
special perks as ASSU President.
"I would love if there were tons of perks, if we got
flown around the world and stuff, but I can't think of
anything," Zimbroff said, though he noted that he had
heard past ASSU Presidents were given free food from
The Axe and Palm.
According to Trusheim, the ASSU President's
salary has remained largely constant over the past
decade, varying by at most $l,OOO in any year since
2002-03 when the president received $9,500. Most of the
annual changes made by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council have consisted of
redistributing money between the summer stipend and
the academic year salary.
Student body presidents at several of Stanford's
peer institutions are not paid for their work and receive
no special benefits. That includes Tara Raghuveer,
president of the Harvard Undergraduate Council.
"I would say my main perk is that I get to work with
a great group of people on stuff I really care about, but
besides that there's nothing material," she said.
Raghuveer said that she has been involved with the
Undergraduate Council since her sophomore year and
decided to run for president because of her interest in
local government and her desire to foster communica
tion between students and the administration.
"I'm pretty happy doing it without getting paid," she
said. "I think there are a lot better uses of student mon
ey than funding me. I ran for this position because I feel
that I have the time and energy to dedicate to it, and
that doesn't necessarily require any kind of monetary
payback."
John Gonzalez, president of the Yale College Council
(YCC), also does not receive a salary. Gonzalez said that
he believes the YCC president should be compensated,
as he thinks that it would "legit
imize" the role.
"I think it would be very helpful
in holding the president account
able to the undergraduate popula
tion as well as to administrators,"
he said, adding that compensation
would also make the administra
tors take the work of the YCC
more seriously.
According to Gonzalez, Yale's
administration currently does not
seek input from the student gov
ernment. He said that he receives
no perks as president of the YCC
and noted that he is currently
enrolled in a full load of classes
because of Yale's high credit
requirement.
"I spend over five hours a day
on this job," Gonzalez said. "It's
really hard when you're trying to
keep up with classes, too. I really
don't feel like a student. Most of
my time is spent answering emails,
going to meetings and managing
the council."
Raghuveer and Connor Land
graf, president of the Associated
Students of the University of Cali
fornia, are also currently taking
full course loads. Though Landgraf
was paid a $4,000 stipend for his
work this year, he received no

perks.
While Zimbroff receives a rela
tively large salary compared to
Landgraf, Gonzalez and Raghu
veer, the job of ASSU President
still pays far less than several oth
er positions on campus, especially
those available for graduate stu
dents and co-terms.
"If we ever had a grad student
want to be ASSU President, it lit
erally makes no economic sense for
them," Trusheim said. "For TA
ships they would get $B,OOO a quar
ter, and the ASSU President's
salary is a huge step down from
that."
The minimum salary for a grad
uate student working as a teaching
assistant (TA) for the 2012-13 aca
demic year was $8,327 per quarter,
or a total of $24,981 for a graduate
student working all three quarters.
As a co-term student, Zimbroff
had the opportunity to work as a
TA, but chose to run for ASSU
President despite the fact that he is
earning only a third of a TA's
salary.
"I don't think anyone doing this
job should be complaining about
needing to get paid more or have
more perks," Zimbroff said.
"There is a bigger reason why you
should be doing this the idea
that you want to help improve stu
dent life in certain small ways."
