# ASSU Exec enjoys high pay, perks
## Student body leaders better paid than at many peer institutions 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The California sun is not the only perk for Stanford's
student government leaders, with the president of the
Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU)
enjoying a relatively large stipend and several unique
privileges compared to his peers at other elite institu
tions.
Robbie Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3, current president of
the ASSU, received a $8,750 salary for the year and
split a $2,750 summer stipend with ASSU Vice Presi
dent William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 to pay for summer
housing on campus.
The ASSU President is also a non-voting member on
the Faculty Senate and is given the opportunity to
enroll as a half-time student at a 50 percent tuition rate.
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen Trusheim
'l3 M.S. 'l4 estimated that only four undergraduates on
campus are allowed to enroll half-time.
Salaries and perks for student body presidents vary
at colleges around the country, with some, like the Har
vard Undergraduate Council president and the presi
dent of the Yale College Council, receiving no pay and
others, such as the University of Central Florida stu
dent body president, receiving $20,000 per year in addi
tion to benefits like free cell phones and parking pass
es, money for meals and opportunities to meet celebri
ties who visit campus.
Zimbroff said that other than free admission to
football and basketball games â€”he has received no
special perks as ASSU President.
"I would love if there were tons of perks, if we got
flown around the world and stuff, but I can't think of
anything," Zimbroff said, though he noted that he had
heard past ASSU Presidents were given free food from
The Axe and Palm.
According to Trusheim, the ASSU President's
salary has remained largely constant over the past
decade, varying by at most $l,OOO in any year since
2002-03 when the president received $9,500. Most of the
annual changes made by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council have consisted of
redistributing money between the summer stipend and
the academic year salary.
Student body presidents at several of Stanford's
peer institutions are not paid for their work and receive
no special benefits. That includes Tara Raghuveer,
president of the Harvard Undergraduate Council.
"I would say my main perk is that I get to work with
a great group of people on stuff I really care about, but
besides that there's nothing material," she said.
Raghuveer said that she has been involved with the
Undergraduate Council since her sophomore year and
decided to run for president because of her interest in
local government and her desire to foster communica
tion between students and the administration.
"I'm pretty happy doing it without getting paid," she
said. "I think there are a lot better uses of student mon
ey than funding me. I ran for this position because I feel
that I have the time and energy to dedicate to it, and
that doesn't necessarily require any kind of monetary
payback."
John Gonzalez, president of the Yale College Council
(YCC), also does not receive a salary. Gonzalez said that
he believes the YCC president should be compensated,
