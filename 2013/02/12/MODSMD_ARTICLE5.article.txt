## Stanford's female astronauts discuss NASA experiences 
### MOLLY VORWERCK DESK EDITOR 
"Stanford is the kind of place where you do
think about achieving goals that are incredible
and you do get encouragement from being
around people that set those goals just like you
do," said Ellen Ochoa M.S. 'Bl Ph.D. 'B5, the first
Hispanic woman in space, on Monday night in
Cemex Auditorium at an event highlighting the
accomplishments of three Stanford alumnae
astronauts.
The program, Stanford Women in Space,
showcased the accomplishments of Eileen Collins
M.S. 'B6, the first woman to serve as a shuttle
commander, Barbara Morgan '73, the first
teacher in space, and Ochoa, the current director
of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton, Texas.
Norm Robinson Ph.D. '74, a former dean of
student affairs and current staff emeritus, began

the symposium by introducing moderator Scott
Hubbard, professor of aeronautics and astronau
tics and former director of NASAs Ames Space
Center.
Before introducing the speakers, Hubbard
brought the audience's attention to the recent
passing of Sally Ride '73 M.S. '75 Ph.D. '7B, the
first woman in space, who Hubbard cited as a
groundbreaking astronaut who paved the way for
the three women on the stage.
Collins began an account of her time at NASA
by describing the moment she realized she want
ed to go to space as a fourth grader perusing a
Junior Scholastic magazine and encountering a
picture of the Gemini astronauts.
"It didn't matter that there were no women
in the picture, I just figured I could be an astro
naut someday," she said. "I carried that dream
with me throughout the years, and I never told

anyone I wanted to be an astronaut
because I was worried they'd say I
couldn't do it."
Ochoa followed by describing her
time working for NASA, both as an
astronaut and then later on the man
agement side of the organization.
Both Collins and Ochoa were select
ed to become astronauts during the
1990 recruiting season, and Ochoa
noted that by the time they were
both in the programâ€”women had
become a much larger component of
the NASA infrastructure.
Like Hubbard, Ochoa credited
Ride for paving the way for future
female astronauts, as well as the
Stanford community for serving as
an incubator for her lofty aspirations.
"While I was getting my Ph.D.,
Sally Ride flew for the first time,
which gave me encouragement," she
said.
Morgan, the third woman on the
panel, became an elementary school
teacher before even considering
becoming an astronaut. She credited
Ronald Reagan's televised appeal to
teachers to apply for the Teacher in
Space Program as the impetus for
her desire to see space.
Morgan was chosen out of 10,000
applicants to serve as Christa McAu
liffe's back up for the Space Shuttle
Challenger mission, which ended in
tragedy after the spacecraft explod
ed 73 seconds into its flight.
After the crash, NASA reluctant
ly asked Morgan to become the new
Teacher in Space designee, fearful
that she would decline. However, that
was far from her response.
"It was very easy to make the
decision to accept," she said. "We had
school kids across the country watch
ing adults in a terrible situation, and
I thought it was right to let kids
watch adults do the right things.
How are we going to fix it if we don't
keep the future open for our kids?"
After the speakers introduced
themselves, Hubbard fielded audi
ence questions collected on note
cards distributed before the pro
gram.
When asked what skills and
accomplishments prospective astro
nauts should have under their belts
before applying to NASA, all three
women stressed the necessity of
receiving advanced educations, cit
ing their Stanford degrees and
intellectual curiosities as beneficial
assets.
Ochoa, who is currently in the
process of choosing the astronauts of
the 2013 recruitment class, empha

sized this desire to learn.
"This year, we have 6,300 applica
tions to be next astronauts, and we
will only pick 10," Ochoa said. "We
look for curious people who like to
learn. Good leaders, good followers
and good team players."
The women also responded to
questions about the difficulties of
raising families while pursuing full
time careers at NASA.
Though they all acknowledged
the difficult balance, Ochoa noted
that it was often easier to manage
operations in the spacecraft than it
was raising two young boys.
"I always thought that going on a
family vacation required more organ
ization than going on a shuttle flight,"
she said.
The symposium concluded with
Hubbard, widely known as the Mars
Tsar for his involvement with
NASAs Mars Exploration Program,
asking each woman if they would
consider traveling to Mars, and if
they did, whether or not they would
want to return.
Each said they would like to visit
the planet, with Morgan jokingly
suggesting that she might not want
to come back.
"Who knows that it will be like in
10, 20, 30 years," she said with a
shrug.
These three women are part of a
group of seven female astronauts
who have graduated from Stanford,
including Ride and Mae Jemison '77,
the first African-American woman in
space.
According to statistics provided
by the Department of Continuing
Studies, 525 people have flown in
space since Yuri Gagarin's landmark
1961 journey, but only 45 of them
have been women, and seven of these
women have Stanford degrees.
Hubbard suggested that despite
the statistics indicating that fewer
women became astronauts than
men, there is a strong interest in
joining NASA across the gender
spectrum.
"Certainly in my own depart
ment at Stanford [there is], so
there's no lack of interest," he said,
noting that his first two Ph.D. stu
dents have been women. "We like to
encourage diversity and for every
body to get involved in the space
program."
"I think Stanford promotes
entrepreneurship," he added. "I real
ly feel as though the environment is
one of encouraging everyone to start
a company or fly in space."
The Continuing Studies Program
and Stanford Historical Society joint
ly hosted the symposium.
