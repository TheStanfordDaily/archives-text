# Beware the abuse of stats by writers
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The Lanee Armstrong and
Manti Tfe'o scandals exposed
some deep flaws in the pro
fessionalism of sports jour
nalists: a willingness to
believe the unbelievable and not dig
deep lest we scratch the shiny surface
of a perfect story.
Both made headlines and I
even wrote a column on the subject
but there is perhaps a more subtle
and far more pervasive problem in the
world of sports journalism: the
(ab)use of statistics.
First things first, numbers are an
invaluable tool to any sports journal
ist; they allowwriters to back up argu
ments with hard incontrovertible
facts. But perhaps too often they dis
tract us from the truth; sometimes
even the unjustifiable can appear jus
tified through statistics.
Michael Lewis' bestseller "Money
ball" explained pretty effectively how
a cold, hard approach to statistics was
behind the Oakland Athletics' improb
able ability to make the playoffs year
after year, arguing that the rest of the
MLB's unwillingness to really
embrace sabermetrics presented a
huge opportunity for the As.
But much of that assumes we start
with the right statistics in the first
place. Even then, baseball is a very
different beast compared to most
sports. Play is broken down so
much that it becomes possible to
win games using a deeply mathe
matical analysis of skills. That is
rarely feasible in other sports. Per
haps in the tactical nature of foot
ball, but even then, the game can
break down and players find them
selves forced into a role that none of
their personal statistics can have
prepared them for.
There are simply too many
things we can't measure because
they are too subtle or because we
just would be overwhelmed with
information. Statistically, junior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike is by far
Stanford women's basketball's best
player this season. Without her
almost guaranteed double-double
performance in every game, the
Cardinal might not have a 22-2
record so far this season. In com
parison, a player like junior guard
Sara James may have had a statisti
cally solid season, but has not exact
ly lit up the box scores.
Except that ignores all the
intangibles of James' contribution.
Few players look as fired up as she
often has this year, diving all over
the court to force jump balls,
spurring her team on and providing
that spark of determination that
can turn the momentum back in its
favor. None of those show up in the
numerical story of a game, but with
out a doubt they have had then
effect on the scoreboard.
Last week, the BBC released a
league table of managers in English
soccer. As a patriotic subject of Her
Majesty, it pains me to say it, but if
you are looking for an example of
journalistic statistical failure, this
surely was it. The BBC did nothing
more than add up the number of
points each manager had won
three for each win, one for each tie
and divide it by the number of
games they had been in charge.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Man
chester United's Sir Alex Ferguson
who has won countless trophies
in his time at Old Trafford and
whose team is now 12 points clear at
the top of the Premier League
came in first, but below him the
rankings quickly became nonsensi
cal.
For example, Doncaster Rovers'
Brian Flynn was sixth, out of a total
of 122 managers. No offense to
Donny, which currently sits second
in League One, but there is a huge
difference between competing in
the top flight of English soccer
arguably the best league in the
world and fighting it out two
tiers below. But even that isn't the
most embarrassing error of judg
ment made by the BBC. At the time
that table was released, Flynn had
been in charge for just three
games. While his 2.0 points per
game might look impressive, you
don't need to have taken even a sin
gle statistics class to realize how
meaningless it is to draw conclu
sions after so few matches.
On this basis, a new manager
drafted in for just a single game
could become either the best ever
coach in the history of sport or the
absolute worst, all depending on
that one outcome.
Perhaps I'm taking this a little
too personally after all, Reading
FC's Brian McDermott, the Pre
mier League's Manager of the
Month for January was ranked just
99th — but I really don't think it is
unreasonable to have high expecta
tions of major news organizations.
In the Internet age, a simple
relaying of statistics — even with a
little bit of mathematical manipula
tion to squeeze out some new num
bers — is no longer a job for real
journalists. Live box scores
already provide fans with the same
resources that many of us use to
study and analyze games. If we
really want to add value to a story,
journalists should be reading
between those figures and, in order
to tell the real story, sometimes
even ignoring them entirely.
