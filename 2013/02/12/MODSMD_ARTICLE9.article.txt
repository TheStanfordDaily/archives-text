## GAFFNEY'S BACK Tyler Gaffney delays pro baseball to play football 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In the big breaking sports news of the day
Monday, Stanford senior Tyler Gaffney
announced that he was taking a year off from
his minor league baseball career in the Pitts
burgh Pirates organization to rejoin Stanford
football.

"It's been a long process," Gaffney said on
the decision to return to football. "I've been
thinking about it for a while. A lot of thought
went into it."
By signing with the Pirates last July,
Gaffney forfeited his final year of eligibility for
Stanford baseball, but maintained one last year
of eligibility in football. However, Gaffney's five
year clock to use that fourth year of eligibility
expires at the end of the 2013-14 academic year,
making this fall Gaffney's last chance to play
Stanford football.
Gaffney will begin practicing with the team
again on April 1, when he enrolls for spring

quarter classes. Due to NCAA rules, Gaffney is
ineligible to participate during Stanford's win
ter quarter practices because he is not enrolled
in classes.
"I'll be training my butt off trying to get bet
ter, get back into football shape," Gaffney said
about his plans until April 1. "I feel like I'm in
really good shape with all of the work I've been
doing for baseball so I don't have that far to
come."
Gaffney is no stranger to bouncing between
football and baseball. During his three years at

Senior Tyler Gaffney (25) announced that he is taking a year off from his minor league baseball career to return to Stanford football for the
2013-2014 season. Gaffney, who played three years with Stanford baseball and football, will return for spring practice beginning April 1.
Stanford, Gaffney starred at run
ning back for football and in the
outfield for baseball. This year will
actually be his first time in spring
practice at all, giving the senior an
opportunity to work into the run
ning back rotation that will have to
replace departing all-time rushing
leader Stepfan Taylor.
"I don't know that I'll be replac
ing Stepfan," Gaffney said. "I hope
to contribute to the team in any way
that I can."
While playing alongside Taylor,
Gaffney found his niche as the
"quarterback" in the Wildcat forma
tion. In his absence, rising senior
Anthony Wilkerson took over most
Wildcat duties, so Stanford will have
options at the position in the fall.
Gaffney's leaving baseball comes
at a surprising time. In his first
year in professional baseball,
Gaffney shined, hitting just under
.300 with an OPS of .925, placing
him near the top of rookie ball.
Still, the chance to play one more

year for the projected national
championship contender Stanford
football squad was too good of an
opportunity to pass up.
"My mom always tells me to live
your truth," Gaffney said. "I feel
like that's what I'm doing."
If Gaffney has a successful foot
ball season, it is possible that he
could get drafted into a second pro
fessional league: the NFL.
"I'm going to take it one day at a
time," Gaffney said about the possi
bility of playing professional foot
ball. "If that's an opportunity that
presents itself, I'll take a look at it."
On the day that ESPN's Mark
Schlabach moved Stanford up to
No. 2 in his "Way-Too-Early Pre
season Top 25," the Cardinal may
have picked up its most impactful
recruit for a chance at a BCS
National Championship in Gaffney.
Though it's too early to know
whether Gaffney gets the bulk of
the carries or just rounds out a rota
tion of running backs, it is safe to
assume that Gaffney won't let his
year off from professional baseball
go to waste.
