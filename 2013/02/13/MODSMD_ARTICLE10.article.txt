## Cook Stoves, Cake Floss and the Unfinished Evolution of Social Media 
### Uttara Sivaram 
When I first heard that
Hillary Clinton, the woman
who could out-drink and
out-pantsuit John Boehner under
the table, was initiating a project
about cooking stoves, I became
immediately disheartened. One hot
Google search later, however, I dis
covered a heartwarming and inspir
ing campaign to address one of the
leading, yet least publicized causes
of death for women in developing
countries: inhaling toxic amounts of
smoke from cooking on an open fire.
These women spend hours
crouched over fires, not only expos
ing themselves to the risk of lung
and heart diseases, but also leaving
their children vulnerable to serious
respiratory disorders. Clinton's plan
which would provide $5O million
in seed money to the Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves —would sup
ply 100 million fuel-efficient stoves to
Africa.
And to think my first thought
upon hearing about this initiative
was a guest appearance by the for
mer Secretary of State in the
Williams-Sonoma catalog next to
George Foreman.
Truth be told, not many people
indeed, veiy few students here at
Stanford are aware of the health
and environmental risk that simple
cooking fires present. However, I
can tell you what Stanford students
do know. They now know that if you
are having trouble cutting a cake
because the frosting and the crumbs
stick to the knife and make an
unholy mess (and unjustly uneven
slices), using unscented floss does
the job without the tears.
Allow me to explain. A couple
days ago, an article titled "50 Life
Hacks to Simplify Your World" was
widely circulated among Facebook,
Twitter and TUmblr users and the
four-and-a-half people who use Google
Plus. It featured tips like taking an old
CD spindle and toning it into a bagel
tote, pouring pancake batter into emp
ty ketchup bottles, turning muffin
pans upside down to make crunchy
taco shell salads and using old cassette
cases as phone stands.
The Facebook community
(myself included) was flabbergasted
by how much easier many of these
tips would make our lives. Some
people calculated that each tip saved
you, on average, one whole minute
of wasted time you would otherwise
be spending trying to find a bagel
tote in the Williams-Sonoma cata
log. Multiplied by 50, then by seven
days of the week... and so on. I for
warded this article to my family, my
friends and my Economics professor,
who never replied.
However, after I read that article
on Hillary Clinton's new cook stove
project, I began to use the critical
thinking skills that got me here in the
first place. Fifty Life Hacks to Sim
plify whose World, exactly? The Indi
an woman hunched over a cooking
stove's world?

The rise of social media has been
spectacular. But listening to the
great sucking sound of all the intel
lect rushing to create social media
apps is even scarier. Today, creating
apps is just about the trendiest thing
you can do —just yesterday, I down
loaded one that would, after some
initial registration, send me text
reminders to go to the gym, get gro
ceries, take my medication on time,
get my dry cleaning, etc. whenever
appropriate. It's a great app, even
though it's really just a kick to see
my phone chastise me for not going
to the gym.
But with this great innovation
lies the assumption that a consumer
has a gym to go to, a grocery store
within reach, medicine at hand and
an affordable laundry service, not to
mention an iPhone (with iOS.6, obvi
ously). Thus, we're looking at a woe
fully small target audience not too
much larger than the population of
men and women severely concerned
about cake-cutting technique. And I
think that Stanford students the
young men and women with the
capacity to make sweeping changes
on a larger scale than a five-mile
radius around Palo Alto might
turn to the less trendy opportunities
to use technology, even if it means
going back to something as rudimen
tary as an open cooking fire.
So perhaps I shouldn't be too
harsh on that "50 Life Hacks" arti
cle. It's hard to villainize an article
that helped me organize my comput
er cables using bread tabs, not to
mention the fact that it probably
gave a lonely blogger a few days of
Internet fame. However, if our col
lective erudite and sophisticated
interests can be piqued by some
thing as aimless as using a pool noo
dle to keep from falling out of bed, I
think that we can be far more invest
ed in the pressing issues we learn
about in class and in the newspaper
even the challenges we face
every day on campus.
After all, we talk about living in a
bubble all the time. But I think it's a
great bubble, filled with people with
not only the motivation to do great
things, but the capacity to make
them happen as well. We just need
to expand it over a greater area
perhaps even outside our beloved
94305.
Phone apps and social media are
a great start. But let's see if we can
put those loops and algorithms and
heck, maybe even bread tabs, to
good use and target a big enough
audience to truly make a difference
to really simplify the lives of men
and women who aren't necessarily
looking for life hacks but, rather, a
different lifestyle.
While unscented dental floss has
certainly changed my life, I think
that we can do better.

Help Uttara do better, and tell her
about your experiments with dental
floss at usiv@stanford.edu.
