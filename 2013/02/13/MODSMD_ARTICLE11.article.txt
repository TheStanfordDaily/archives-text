## DxE Defends Its Role in the American Meat Protest 
### DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE Direct Action Everywhere is an international grassroots network dedicated to the liberation of all animals 
On a February afternoon in
1960, four students sat down
at a "whites-only" lunch
counter in Greensboro, North Car
olina. Because of the color of their
skin, what they were doing was ille
gal. It was also rude, brazen, con
frontational and downright danger
ous. The store's manager asked the
four men to leave, and even the
black waitress working the counter
scolded, "Fellows like you make our
race look bad."
This past Thursday, some 53
years later, nine activists chose to
stand up and disrupt the panel dis
cussion following the screening of
the film 'American Meat." While our
action was not like that of the Greens
boro Four, we faced much of the same
critique. We were asked to leave,
jeered at and scolded by supporters
and critics of our message alike.
The organizers of the film screen
ing are right: a discussion needs to
take place about what is winding up
on our plates. However, that discus
sion is not over farmers' pay or the
environmental costs of factory farm
ing. It's about the animals killed and
their lives. Our protest began with
the story of a little girl-a dog
named Lisa, who, much like the ani
mals in the film, could very well have
ended up as food. Elsewhere in the
world, dogs just like Lisa are slaugh

tered for their flesh. Lisa was lucky
to have escaped a similarly grim
fate.
It is easy to dismiss animal rights
activists who choose to speak up as
irrational and militant. But with bil
lions of animals killed and eaten
eveiy year individuals with lives as
beautiful and valuable as Lisa's
silence is no longer an option. Grave
injustices are being committed
against victims whose only crime was
being born into a nonhuman species.
We are compelled to speak in their
defense and fight for their lives.
The discussion that was ultimate
ly held after the screening of '!Amer
ican Meat" may not have been the
discussion that the organizers of the
event wanted to have. But it was the
discussion that we urgently need to
have. History looks back on the
Greensboro Four as a catalyst for
ending segregation, not only at a sin
gle lunch counter, but also through
out the United States. It is easy to
look back at these brave men and
laud their actions. When a similar
opportunity to speak up arises today,
are we going to have the courage to
make our voices heard?
