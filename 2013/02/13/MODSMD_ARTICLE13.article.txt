# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD
## Why We Don't Date 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
February 14th is one of the
most dreaded days on my
calendar. When I'm single,
it's lonely; when I'm dating, it's
stressful. It feels unnecessarily
punishing to set up a day dedicated
to high expectations and general
letdowns. It seems an appropriate
time to ask a question that nudges
its way into too many conversations
on campus: why don't people date
at Stanford? I put my feelers out
with some friends and classmates,
and here are the reasons I heard
most frequently.
Number 1: We don't need to
date. There is an alternate hook-up
culture that serves many of the
same needs. Besides, there are too
many options on campus and peo
ple are hesitant to settle for just
one. With a thousand shiny banners
(and attractive people) competing
for your attention, it can be difficult
to focus on one thing that you real
ly want. It's much easier to con
stantly stimulate a short attention
span than to invest in something
long-term.
Number 2: With the demands of
school and friendships, people don't

have the emotional bandwidth to
date. It's simpler to focus on school
if you take all of the messy feelings
you have and tie them up in a box
until the end of the quarter. Hence
the nervous breakdown the first
week of winter break when the box
gets untied. People compartmental
ize, and smartly so. At the end of
the day there isn't enough storage
left for the uncertainty of pursuing
somebody you care about or the
energy reserves you need to take
care of somebody else.
Much of this could be said of any
college student, Stanford or other
wise. There is one reason why we
don't date that seems Stanford-spe
cific to me, though which brings
me to ...
Number 3: It goes like this,
"Dating will make me too comfort
able, and if I get too comfortable,
I'll lose my edge." The cutting edge
is a strong motivator in the land of
limitless startups. And this hot-off
the-market mentality spills over
into more than entrepreneurial
ventures. Better, faster, newer is
the name of the game, not good,
stable and time-tested.

A relationship that is comfort
able and reliable can all too easily
be interpreted as dull and stagnant.
After all, everybody here stretches
themselves to uncomfortable
lengths because discomfort equals
growth. The ocean may be scary
but the lee shore is where you get
shipwrecked. Or so we imagine.
Here I'm going to get sappy so if
that makes you sick, avert your
eyes. Among the highly motivated
students here, I think comfort is
underrated. I think investing in
something long-term is underrat
ed. I think shuffling your priorities
to free up emotional space for
another person is underrated. Do
something corny for me tomorrow.
Get up your nerve and find a Valen
tine. I know it's scary and I know
it's not easy I promise you you'll
be okay. At worst, you get disap
pointed on an otherwise anticlimac
tic holiday. At best, you break the
Stanford mold and you prove me
wrong.
