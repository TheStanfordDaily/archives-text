## RETURNING MARK APPEL FOR REDEMPTION Mark Appel has a point to prove his senior year 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
For the past two seasons, every time
senior Mark Appel stepped out onto
the mound on a Friday night and
looked towards home plate, he saw
dozens of scouts with radar guns point
ed right at him.
Appel was such a can't-miss prospect that not
a soul expected to see him back at Stanford for his
senior year. But when Appel fell to the eighth

overall pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major
League Baseball's Draft this past June, every
thing changed.
"I think it was probably a week or two before
the signing deadline," Appel said about the time
he realized he might be coming back for his sen
ior season. "Prom the draftâ€”well from the end
of the season all the way until a week or two
before the signing deadline I was going back and
forth, making lists, writing out pros and cons for
both returning to school and signing. It ended up
being a very, very tough decision."
In the end, Appel chose a return to Stanford
over a reported $3.8 million signing bonus offer
from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Last year's fellow
juniors Kenny Diekroeger, Stephen Piscotty, Jake
Stewart, Eric Smith and Tyler Gaffney before

announcing Monday that he is returning to Stan
ford for football all signed after being drafted.
Yet Appel, the biggest prospect of them all, is
coming back.
"It is a little weird because you see guys like
Stephen Piscotty and Kenny Diekroeger walking
around campus and going to class at least in
the fall and you don't see them at the field,"
Appel said. "So they have all this free time and,
you know, we're all still grinding and working
hard... I miss those guys but I'm really glad to be
back with all the guys that are on the team this
year."
On Friday evening in Houston, Appel will start
for the second time since the draft. His first time
