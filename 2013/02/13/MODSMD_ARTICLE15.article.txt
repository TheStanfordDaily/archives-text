## RETURNING MARK APPEL FOR REDEMPTION Mark Appel has a point to prove his senior year 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
For the past two seasons, every time
senior Mark Appel stepped out onto
the mound on a Friday night and
looked towards home plate, he saw
dozens of scouts with radar guns point
ed right at him.
Appel was such a can't-miss prospect that not
a soul expected to see him back at Stanford for his
senior year. But when Appel fell to the eighth

overall pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major
League Baseball's Draft this past June, every
thing changed.
"I think it was probably a week or two before
the signing deadline," Appel said about the time
he realized he might be coming back for his sen
ior season. "Prom the draft—well from the end
of the season all the way until a week or two
before the signing deadline I was going back and
forth, making lists, writing out pros and cons for
both returning to school and signing. It ended up
being a very, very tough decision."
In the end, Appel chose a return to Stanford
over a reported $3.8 million signing bonus offer
from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Last year's fellow
juniors Kenny Diekroeger, Stephen Piscotty, Jake
Stewart, Eric Smith and Tyler Gaffney before

announcing Monday that he is returning to Stan
ford for football all signed after being drafted.
Yet Appel, the biggest prospect of them all, is
coming back.
"It is a little weird because you see guys like
Stephen Piscotty and Kenny Diekroeger walking
around campus and going to class at least in
the fall and you don't see them at the field,"
Appel said. "So they have all this free time and,
you know, we're all still grinding and working
hard... I miss those guys but I'm really glad to be
back with all the guys that are on the team this
year."
On Friday evening in Houston, Appel will start
for the second time since the draft. His first time

was the worst start of his career.
Appel lasted only four innings,
allowing seven inns five earned
as Stanford fell to Florida State
17-1 in game one of the NCAA
Super Regional. Eight months later,
Appel has an opportunity to finally
put that start behind him.
"It's been on my mind," Appel
said of the start at Florida State. "I
haven't dwelled on it too much. It's
one of those things where you just
had a bad game and that's part of
baseball and part of life."
If there's any place more com
fortable for Appel than Sunken Dia
mond to help move on from Florida
State, it's Houston. Appel lived
there until high school, when his
family moved to Northern Califor
nia. In a few weeks, Appel will call
Houston home again, as his parents
are moving back there from Beijing
—where they've lived for a little
over a year in the next few weeks.
In fact, the Appels are using the
Rice trip to hunt for houses.
"I'm really excited to play Rice
and go to Houston," Appel said. "I
get to see a lot of friends and family
and everything and also get to play
baseball. First and foremost, it is a
business trip, but getting to see
friends and family is a benefit."
Last June, many thought Appel
would be going back to Houston for
a very different reason the
Astros had the first overall pick in
the MLB Draft and were thought to
have Appel at the top of then' draft
board. However, the Astros went in
another direction, and for the sec
ond time in his young career, Mark
Appel had to overcome being
spurned by one of his favorite teams
The University of Texas for col
lege and the Astros for professional
baseball.
"I grew up the biggest Long
horn fan," Appel said. "I think I had
a different Longhorn t-shirt for
every day of the week. Both my par
ents went there and I grew up want
ing to go to Texas, wanting to go to

UT, and when we moved to Califor
nia things kind of changed. I sent
my recruiting video there and
everything and I never really heard
back from them. They don't really
need to recruit out of Texas. There's
just so much talent there. And so, I
remember that first time freshman
year when I got to pitch against
them there, out of relief, and it was
just so surreal. It was kind of like a
dream come true except I was on
the wrong team."
For Appel, this season's quest for
redemption will be about a lot more
than just one game. Not making it to
the College World Series of Omaha,
Neb., last season was an enormous
disappointment for Appel and
everyone on the team. If he can help
lead Stanford to Omaha, he will
probably be looking at another big
signing bonus offer in June, and his
decision to come back to Stanford
could look pretty good certainly a
lot better than Texas head coach
Augie Garrido's decision to not
recruit Appel out of high school.
"I think a lot of people will deter
mine whether the decision was a
good one or not based on the results
of what happens," Appel said, "but
I'm focusing on just the process.
One of the most important things
was I just want to play baseball,
whether it's at Stanford or with the
Pirates organization."
In a few weeks, baseball will be
the only required part of Appel's
days. The senior is on track to grad
uate at the end of winter quarter in
a little over a month and is still try
ing to figure out what he'll do when
he's not playing baseball.
"I've thought about that and I've
tried to think of some cool ideas,"
Appel said. "I know I'm going to try
to catch up on sleep I've been
generating quite the sleep debt here
at Stanford so I'm going to try to
catch up a little bit on that. But I'm
going to try to stay pretty active. I
don't think I'm going to try to do an
internship or a job or anything like
that but just try to see if the are are
any community service options in
the spring."

good one or not based on the results
of what happens," Appel said, "but
I'm focusing on just the process.
One of the most important things
was I just want to play baseball,
whether it's at Stanford or with the
Pirates organization."
In a few weeks, baseball will be
the only required part of Appel's
days. The senior is on track to grad
uate at the end of winter quarter in
a little over a month and is still try
ing to figure out what he'll do when
he's not playing baseball.
"I've thought about that and I've
tried to think of some cool ideas,"
Appel said. "I know I'm going to try
to catch up on sleep I've been
generating quite the sleep debt here
at Stanford so I'm going to try to
catch up a little bit on that. But I'm
going to try to stay pretty active. I
don't think I'm going to try to do an
internship or a job or anything like
that but just try to see if the are are
any community service options in
the spring."

Junior Dan Scherer's opening win in the heavyweight contest against CSU Bakersfield was not enough to
help Stanford overcome the Roadrunners. With his victory, Scherer is now 19-9 overall and 12-7 in duals.
For the past two seasons, every time
senior Mark Appel stepped out onto
the mound on a Friday night and
looked towards home plate, he saw
dozens of scouts with radar guns point
ed right at him.
Appel was such a can't-miss prospect that not
a soul expected to see him back at Stanford for his
senior year. But when Appel fell to the eighth

overall pick of the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major
League Baseball's Draft this past June, every
thing changed.
"I think it was probably a week or two before
the signing deadline," Appel said about the time
he realized he might be coming back for his sen
ior season. "Prom the draft—well from the end
of the season all the way until a week or two
before the signing deadline I was going back and
forth, making lists, writing out pros and cons for
both returning to school and signing. It ended up
being a very, very tough decision."
In the end, Appel chose a return to Stanford
over a reported $3.8 million signing bonus offer
from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Last year's fellow
juniors Kenny Diekroeger, Stephen Piscotty, Jake
Stewart, Eric Smith and Tyler Gaffney before

announcing Monday that he is returning to Stan
ford for football all signed after being drafted.
Yet Appel, the biggest prospect of them all, is
coming back.
"It is a little weird because you see guys like
Stephen Piscotty and Kenny Diekroeger walking
around campus and going to class at least in
the fall and you don't see them at the field,"
Appel said. "So they have all this free time and,
you know, we're all still grinding and working
hard... I miss those guys but I'm really glad to be
back with all the guys that are on the team this
year."
On Friday evening in Houston, Appel will start
for the second time since the draft. His first time

was the worst start of his career.
Appel lasted only four innings,
allowing seven inns five earned
as Stanford fell to Florida State
17-1 in game one of the NCAA
Super Regional. Eight months later,
Appel has an opportunity to finally
put that start behind him.
"It's been on my mind," Appel
said of the start at Florida State. "I
haven't dwelled on it too much. It's
one of those things where you just
had a bad game and that's part of
baseball and part of life."
If there's any place more com
fortable for Appel than Sunken Dia
mond to help move on from Florida
State, it's Houston. Appel lived
there until high school, when his
family moved to Northern Califor
nia. In a few weeks, Appel will call
Houston home again, as his parents
are moving back there from Beijing
—where they've lived for a little
over a year in the next few weeks.
In fact, the Appels are using the
Rice trip to hunt for houses.
"I'm really excited to play Rice
and go to Houston," Appel said. "I
get to see a lot of friends and family
and everything and also get to play
baseball. First and foremost, it is a
business trip, but getting to see
friends and family is a benefit."
Last June, many thought Appel
would be going back to Houston for
a very different reason the
Astros had the first overall pick in
the MLB Draft and were thought to
have Appel at the top of then' draft
board. However, the Astros went in
another direction, and for the sec
ond time in his young career, Mark
Appel had to overcome being
spurned by one of his favorite teams
The University of Texas for col
lege and the Astros for professional
baseball.
"I grew up the biggest Long
horn fan," Appel said. "I think I had
a different Longhorn t-shirt for
every day of the week. Both my par
ents went there and I grew up want
ing to go to Texas, wanting to go to

UT, and when we moved to Califor
nia things kind of changed. I sent
my recruiting video there and
everything and I never really heard
back from them. They don't really
need to recruit out of Texas. There's
just so much talent there. And so, I
remember that first time freshman
year when I got to pitch against
them there, out of relief, and it was
just so surreal. It was kind of like a
dream come true except I was on
the wrong team."
For Appel, this season's quest for
redemption will be about a lot more
than just one game. Not making it to
the College World Series of Omaha,
Neb., last season was an enormous
disappointment for Appel and
everyone on the team. If he can help
lead Stanford to Omaha, he will
probably be looking at another big
signing bonus offer in June, and his
decision to come back to Stanford
could look pretty good certainly a
lot better than Texas head coach
Augie Garrido's decision to not
recruit Appel out of high school.
"I think a lot of people will deter
mine whether the decision was a
good one or not based on the results
of what happens," Appel said, "but
I'm focusing on just the process.
One of the most important things
was I just want to play baseball,
