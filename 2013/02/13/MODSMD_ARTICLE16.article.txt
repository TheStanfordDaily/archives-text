# Broncos head to Farm
## Stanford hosts Santa Clara tonight 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
After taking four of its six
games at the Kajikawa Classic
this past weekend, the Stanford
softball team looks to secure its
first home victory of the 2013
campaign against Santa Clara
tonight.
The No. 20 Cardinal (4-2) took
care of business against Bradley,
Portland State, Cal Poly and Indi
ana in the season-opening tour
nament but could not muster
enough offensive firepower to
take down heavyweights No. 2
Oklahoma and Kentucky. But the
Broncos (0-2) haven't exactly
seen their bats come alive either.
They managed only one run in
their losses to Pacific in last
weekend's doubleheader.
A First Team All-Pac-12
selection, senior shortstop Jenna
Rich has headlined Stanford's
offensive production early this
season. Six was the magic num
ber for the steady shortstop this
past weekend, as she accounted
for six hits, including one home
run and two doubles, along with
six RBIs and six runs scored.
Rich, who led the Pac-12 last sea
son with 66 RBIs, showed no
signs of rust from the offseason
and currently boasts a .611 slug
ging percentage and a .478 on
base percentage.
Sophomore first baseman
Erin Ashby had her coming-out
party at the Classic, ripping two
homers, including one that
spoiled Cal Poly's hopes by

extending the game to nine
innings. Sophomore outfielder
Cassandra Roulund got in on the
action too by hitting her first col
legiate home run.
"[The home run] definitely
felt like everything we worked
on in the fall was coming togeth
er," Roulund said. "It was a con
fidence booster. It felt thrilling
to be able to contribute to the
team."
Besides giving up eight runs
to the No. 2 team in the nation,

the duo of senior Teagan Gerhart
and freshman Kelsey Stevens
carried a consistent presence on
the mound. Gerhart shouldered
a heavy load for the Cardinal last
season, starting in 43 games
while maintaining a 2.89 ERA,
but the emergence of Stevens
should take some pressure off
her.
Gerhart started in four games
at the Classic and came away
