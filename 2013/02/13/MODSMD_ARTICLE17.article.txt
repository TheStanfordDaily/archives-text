# WRESTLING
## Card closes season 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Last Saturday, the Stanford
wrestling team defeated San Fran
cisco State 28-11 on campus before
falling 24-13 to CSU Bakersfield on
the road the following dav.

Though the Cardinal (6-15, 1-4
Pac-12) defeated the Gators (8-8,2-2
Rocky Mountain Athletics) out of
conference, the loss to the Roadrun
ners (8-5,2-3 Pac-12) almost ensured
that it would finish the season sec
ond-to-last in the six-team Pac-12
Conference. Should Cal Poly defeat
Arizona State on Friday, the Mus
tangs could climb to tie with Stan
ford for fifth.
With a frustrating season behind
it and the Pac-12 Championship
starting in just over two weeks time,
this weekend's bout with No. 12 Cen
tral Michigan provides a crucial last
chance to turn things around right at
the end of the year. Not only are the
Chippewas highly ranked, but they
will also square off against Stan
ford's in-conference rivals Cal Poly
and CSU Bakersfield two days later.
The Cardinal overcame San
Francisco State with an 8-2 decision,
including a forfeit decision in the
heavyweight class on Saturday. The
wins came thanks to sophomore
Brendan Ter Wee, with the forfeit
decision, redshirt freshman Evan
Silver, senior Timmy Boone, junior
Garrett Schaner, junior Kyle Meyer,
freshman Thomas Kimbrell, junior
Alan Yen and redshirt freshman
Michael Sojka.

STANFORD 13
CSU BAKERSFIELD 24
2/10, Bakersfield, Calif.
Silver picked up his fourth major
decision of the year and now leads
the team with 24 wins on the season.
Meyer also wrestled in the 165-
pound category even though he only
weighs in at 157 pounds, giving his
teammate, junior Bret Baumbacha,
a chance to rest.
In the loss to Bakersfield, Stan
ford lost six of the ten matches,
including a default loss in the 133-
pound class. The Cardinal victories
came from junior Dan Scherer, sen

ior Timmy Boone, Baumbach and
Sojka. Baumbach took his fifth
major decision of the year and has a
19-9 record on the season. Boone
came back from trailing the Road
runners' redshirt junior Dalton Kel
ley in the third period to force four
rounds of overtime and finally take
the win.
Stanford will now host Central
Michigan at Senior Day this Satur
day. The Chippewas (12-3, 4-0 Mid-
American) appear to be serious com
petition in the Cardinal's last home
bout of the season. CMU is on a six
contest winning streak, and hasn't
allowed the opposing team to score
even double-figure points in its last
three matchups.

The Chippewas are lead by sen
ior Ben Bennett in the 184-pound
weight class, who has a perfect 20-0
record so far this season, a No. 2
Inter Mat ranking and the top rank
ing in the Mid-American Confer
ence. Central Michigan also has the
No. 11 wrestler in the 125-pound
class and the No. 7 in the 133-pound
class, seniors Christian Cullinan and
Scotti Sentes, respectively.
The bout between Stanford and
Central Michigan will start at 12
p.m. PT at Burnham Pavilion and
will be streamed live on the Pac-12
website.
