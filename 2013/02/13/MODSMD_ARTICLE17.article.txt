## Card closes season 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Last Saturday, the Stanford
wrestling team defeated San Fran
cisco State 28-11 on campus before
falling 24-13 to CSU Bakersfield on
the road the following dav.

Though the Cardinal (6-15, 1-4
Pac-12) defeated the Gators (8-8,2-2
Rocky Mountain Athletics) out of
conference, the loss to the Roadrun
ners (8-5,2-3 Pac-12) almost ensured
that it would finish the season sec
ond-to-last in the six-team Pac-12
Conference. Should Cal Poly defeat
Arizona State on Friday, the Mus
tangs could climb to tie with Stan
ford for fifth.
With a frustrating season behind
it and the Pac-12 Championship
starting in just over two weeks time,
this weekend's bout with No. 12 Cen
tral Michigan provides a crucial last
chance to turn things around right at
the end of the year. Not only are the
Chippewas highly ranked, but they
will also square off against Stan
ford's in-conference rivals Cal Poly
and CSU Bakersfield two days later.
The Cardinal overcame San
Francisco State with an 8-2 decision,
including a forfeit decision in the
heavyweight class on Saturday. The
wins came thanks to sophomore
Brendan Ter Wee, with the forfeit
decision, redshirt freshman Evan
Silver, senior Timmy Boone, junior
Garrett Schaner, junior Kyle Meyer,
freshman Thomas Kimbrell, junior
Alan Yen and redshirt freshman
Michael Sojka.
