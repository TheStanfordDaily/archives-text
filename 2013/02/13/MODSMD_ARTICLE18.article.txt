# Secret to winning ways proved wrong

### David Eng 
Six months ago, I wrote a
column in which I lamented
over my sad existence as a
Warriors fan. In addition to
fishing for sympathetic
messages from my followers I fist
bumped myself all of twice before the
emails stopped flowing—l sought to
help out my favorite sports team by
exposing the blueprint for NBA suc
cess. Six months older and six months
wiser aren't we a11... I will now
revisit this previously laid blueprint.
Try not to laugh. I presented two
options:
Option 1: Hoard free agent
superstars a la the Miami Heat. I
like to think this was actually misin
formation intended for Mitch
Kupchak from the start. Indeed, the
general manager of the Los Ange
les Lakers signed an aging Steve
Nash and traded for an outspoken
Dwight Howard, all out of concern
that his general managing counter
part in the Bay Area also reads my
widely distributed sports columns
in The Daily.

Admittedly, this was unlikely
Kupchak's motivation for acquiring
the veteran guard and center, yet
the fact remains that hoarding
proven superstars seems to have
backfired for Kobe & Co. A 24-28
record isn't going to get it done,
boys unless, of course, you play
in the Eastern Conference. Mean
while, the Dubs' main offseason
acquisition, Jarrett Jack, neither a
free agent nor a superstar in any
sense of either word, has outper
formed each of the Lakers' acquisi
tions. Let that sink in for a moment.
Jarrett Jack has been as valuable
as a backup point guard as Steve
Nash or Dwight Howard. Who
would have thought?
Before I am sacrificed to the
basketball gods for the apparent
heresy I have just committed, allow
me to reframe my assertion. I am
not saying that Jarrett possesses
talent comparable to either of the
other two players; that would be sil
ly and, frankly, worthy of castiga
tion. What I am saying and what I
neglected to address in my previous
column was the way in which this
offseason acquisition would fit into
the system.
Hardly an earth-shattering
insight, I know. But it's worth put
ting it out there.
Option 2: Draft developing
superstars a la Oklahoma City. I
shamelessly implied that in order
for Golden State to explore this
avenue to its fullest potential, it
would need to endure a poorer sea
son than ordinary that is, the
Warriors' mediocrity wasn't cutting
it in the lottery The tough-luck
franchise had to be historically
bad to secure a lottery pick of high
value.
This season, Harrison Barnes,
the Warriors' first-round pick and
seventh pick in the draft overall,
has hardly been a revelation. But
who expected that? I, for one, was
just hoping he wouldn't end up like
Ike Diogu or Patrick O'Bryant or
Anthony Randolph or Brandan
Wright. Rather, Barnes' work ethic
and physique have made him a solid
contributor at the forward position
and, evidently choice model for
the release of the team's alternate
jersey with sleeves on a playoff
caliber team.
So I was pretty wrong when I
said that mid-lottery picks wouldn't
propel them into contention. For the
Warriors, that's apparently all
they've needed to compete. Steph
Curry was a mid-lottery pick. Klay
Thompson was not a high lottery
pick either. And neither was
Barnes.
At 30-21, the team is in no way
dominant and there's an all-too
real possibility that it regresses
from here. But, for now, it has given
me an actual reason to believe.

David Eng hopes the Warriors con
tinue to ignore his advice as they
sweep to their first NBA Finals
appearance in almost W years.
