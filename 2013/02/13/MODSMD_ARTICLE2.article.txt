## Humanties IntroSem app numbers decline Interest rising in science and engineering courses 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Despite extensive praise for
the Introductory Seminars
(IntroSems) program's ability to
introduce students to university
level thinking across a range of
disciplines, humanities faculty
members have expressed concern
about low enrollment in their
IntroSems compared to enroll
ment in more technical
IntroSems.
Data from the Simple Enroll
feature on Axess revealed that 62
IntroSems were offered this
quarter, with an approximately
equal distribution of courses
offered by humanities and science
departments.
Though IntroSem Program
Director Russell Berman refused
to release enrollment numbers,
Simple Enroll shows that 19 of
the 62 IntroSems offered this
quarter are currently closed for

enrollment, indicating that those
courses are filled to capacity. Sci
ence departments offered thir
teen of these full-capacity
IntroSems, while humanities
departments offered four and the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB) and the School of Law pro
vided the final pair.
Of the 16 IntroSems with
enrollment at less than half of
maximum capacity, 14 were in
humanities departments, with
one offered by the School of Edu
cation and one by the School of
Medicine.
Susan McConnell, professor of
biology and co-chair of last year's
Study of Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford (SUES), said
that the committee noticed dis
parities in enrollment numbers
among departments while inves
tigating the IntroSem program.
The SUES report recommended
requiring freshmen to take at
least one IntroSem.
"Certainly there was an
awareness that some of the engi-
