## Humanties IntroSem app numbers decline Interest rising in science and engineering courses 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Despite extensive praise for
the Introductory Seminars
(IntroSems) program's ability to
introduce students to university
level thinking across a range of
disciplines, humanities faculty
members have expressed concern
about low enrollment in their
IntroSems compared to enroll
ment in more technical
IntroSems.
Data from the Simple Enroll
feature on Axess revealed that 62
IntroSems were offered this
quarter, with an approximately
equal distribution of courses
offered by humanities and science
departments.
Though IntroSem Program
Director Russell Berman refused
to release enrollment numbers,
Simple Enroll shows that 19 of
the 62 IntroSems offered this
quarter are currently closed for

enrollment, indicating that those
courses are filled to capacity. Sci
ence departments offered thir
teen of these full-capacity
IntroSems, while humanities
departments offered four and the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB) and the School of Law pro
vided the final pair.
Of the 16 IntroSems with
enrollment at less than half of
maximum capacity, 14 were in
humanities departments, with
one offered by the School of Edu
cation and one by the School of
Medicine.
Susan McConnell, professor of
biology and co-chair of last year's
Study of Undergraduate Educa
tion at Stanford (SUES), said
that the committee noticed dis
parities in enrollment numbers
among departments while inves
tigating the IntroSem program.
The SUES report recommended
requiring freshmen to take at
least one IntroSem.
"Certainly there was an
awareness that some of the engi-
struggled to attract students to their
IntroSems, many professors teaching sci
ence and technology IntroSems receive an
abundance of applications.
Associate Professor of Mechanical
Engineering Shilajeet Banerjee M.S. 'OO
received over 230 applications for his
IntroSem, Think Like a Designer, this fall.
Banerjee said that he has taught the class
four times since fall 2008, and that student
interest in his IntroSem has grown over
that period.
While Banerjee hesitated to identify
any single factor in the popularity of the
class, he speculated that the increasing
popularity of design might be responsible.
He said that he has noticed that students
are particularly interested in courses that
offer the opportunity for hands-on work
and field trips, which explains high interest
in science and engineering courses in which
students visit design firms or manufactur
ing plants.
Elisha Marquez 'l6, who took an Envi
ronmental Earth System Science
IntroSem last quarter, said that low enroll
ment in humanities IntroSems reflects the
interests of the student body.
"By virtue of the fact that we go to Stan
ford, I think there is a larger interest in the
sciences in general, which correlates to
larger interest in science and math
IntroSems," Marquez said.
Marquez, a potential International
Relations major, added that science
IntroSems are often more popular among
students who are not majoring in a science
or math-related field than humanities
introsems are among students majoring in
a non-humanities field, as more science
IntroSems tend to fulfill a General Educa
tion Requirement (GER) than humanities
IntroSems.
"There is an incentive for people to take
science and math IntroSems even if they
don't have an interest in [them] because
they want to fulfill their requirements, and
IntroSems are an easy way to do it," Mar
quez said.
On the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education's Course Administration web
site, there are 33 introsems listed for the
2012-2013 academic year that fulfill the
humanities GER. Twenty fulfill the engi
neering and applied science GER, 14 fulfill
the natural science requirement and eight
satisfy the social science GER. No
introsems fulfill the math requirement this
year.
McConnell said that the Office of Vice
Provost of Undergraduate Education will
be tracking IntroSem enrollment num
bers, and she expressed optimism that
interest in humanities IntroSems will
increase.
"I think that humanities IntroSems are
a fabulous way of getting introduced to the
humanities," McConnell said. "Learning
about the humanities is so important
regardless of what someone wants to major
in and IntroSems are a perfect forum for
learning about something that is complete
ly new."

neering and science courses were overen
rolled and some of the humanities courses
were underenrolled," McConnell said. "We
were absolutely aware of that."
Charlotte Fonrobert, associate profes
sor of religious studies, was also a member
of the SUES committee and currently
teaches an IntroSem titled Religion and
Politics. She said that the low interest
expressed in humanities IntroSems is "not
so surprising."
"In general I think it is true that stu
dents have tended to take much more of
the science and social science classes in the
recent couple years," Fonrobert said.
Religion and Politics currently has nine
students enrolled and nine available seats.
Fonrobert, who said that IntroSems are
her "favorite type of class," previously
taught an IntroSem about religion and
gender that averaged 10 to 15 students
each of the three times the class was offered.
Helen Brooks Ph.D. 'BO, senior lecturer
of English, also expressed little surprise
about the low interest in humanities
IntroSems.
Brooks estimated that she has taught six
to eight IntroSems during her time at Stan
ford and said that she received four applica
tions for the English IntroSem she is teach
ing this quarter, "Tis All In Pieces, All
Coherence Gone": John Donne, the Neuro
sciences, and the Early Modern World.
This small number of applications
marked a drastic decline from previous
years, when Brooks often received 20 to 25
applications for similar IntroSems. Accord
ing to Brooks, other humanities professors
have had similar experiences.
"It seems like now there are fewer
applications, and I'm hearing that from
other faculty, too," Brooks said. "There has
been a decline in interest in humanities
courses, which is something I'm really con
cerned about."
Brooks attributed that diminishing
interest to a variety of factors, including a
difficult economic climate and parental
pressures to enroll in classes that are tradi
tionally considered more practical.
As a pre-major advisor, Brooks said that
she often speaks with students who are
reluctant to explore their interests in the
humanities because their parents have
encouraged them to commit to a different
career field.
"Students are saying, 'I have this inter
est but my parents want me to do some
thing else,' so that creates some tension in
terms of what students are going to pur
sue," Brooks said. "I have personally
encouraged the University to provide an
orientation for parents about majors and
the changes that are occurring in different
fields."
Brooks also expressed hope that
humanities courses in the IntroSem pro
gram become more interdisciplinary in
order to attract a wider variety of students.
