## Frosh form Bay Area consulting group 
### BENJAMIN PHAM 
In an attempt to redefine the
typical marketing and consulting
model, three Stanford freshmen
plan to launch the Stanford Identi
ty Lab, a new student club focused
on consulting for Bay Area clients,
in April.
While acknowledging the exis
tence of an abundance of student
led consulting groups on campus,
Identity Lab co-founders Han Lee
'l6 and Ryan Breslow 'l6 framed
their group's holistic approach to
consulting and marketing as a dif
ferentiating factor.
"Rather than tell [clients] to
target this audience, we would set
up an actual marketing strategy
for them that they would be able
to follow very simply," Breslow
said.
The group will focus on collab
oration with advertisers and cre

ative directors in the Bay Area
and has already partnered with
several firms in South Korea to
outsource design work.
"As far as technicalities go, like
with 3-D graphics, it's hard to find
someone who has that level of
technicality [that we need] on
campus," Lee said. "We contacted
several people in the Bay Area,
but we weren't really satisfied
with their portfolios, so we decided
to look internationally."
Though Lee would not disclose
what the Identity Lab would pay
partners, Breslow said that the
group will have low operating
costs and will charge clients a
small fee in order to remain com
petitive. While the group current
ly has no clients and has reached
out to potential clients with offers
of pro bono services, Lee said that
several local businesses have
already expressed interest in collab
oration.
The idea behind the Identity
Lab was conceived during last
year's Admit Weekend, where Lee
and Breslow met.
"Marketing is something I've
always been doing I've worked at
IBM and Microsoft and other ven
ture capital companies," Lee said.
"Ryan has done several websites,
including mobile websites, social
marketing and search engine opti
mization."
The two founders recently
recruited Chua Kai Jian 'l6, who
shared their interests and experi
ence in marketing, business and
consulting, to complement the
group's leadership team.
"I thought it would be cool to get
some hands-on experience in con

suiting," Jian said. "We're not think
ing as much about starting a busi
ness [as about] being more of a stu
dent group where people can learn
about aspects of consulting, like
case projects."
While many budding entrepre
neurs launch startups, the founders
of the Identity Lab decided to
remain a club in order to take
advantage of Stanford's reputation
in attracting clients.
"The Stanford name is presti
gious," Lee noted.
The Identity Lab plans to launch
an official website in March and
hold a number of information ses
sions in April, with hopes of eventu
ally expanding to become a full
fledged business.
"We'd definitely consider
[expanding in the future]," Breslow
said. "Initially we'd like to organize
as a student group, and then use our
organization to hopefully branch off
in the future "
