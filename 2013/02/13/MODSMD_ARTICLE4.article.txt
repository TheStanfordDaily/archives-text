## BRINKLEY UNDER FIRE Journalist, professor Joel Brinkley defends controversial column 
### NEEL THAKKAR DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks after a column on
Vietnamese dietary habits written
by professor of communication Joel
Brinkley prompted controversy and
criticism nationally and in Vietnam,
Brinkley has continued to defend the
column's substance amid a prolifera
tion of petitions calling for an apolo
gy or even his resignation.
In the column, published on Jan.
29 in the Chicago Tribune, Brinkley
attributed the lack of domesticated
animals in Vietnam, as well as the
Vietnamese people's "aggressive
tendencies," to the country's meat
eating tendencies.
"Animal trafficking explains the
dearth of tigers, elephants and other
big beasts. But what about birds and
rats?" Brinkley wrote. "Yes, people
eat those, too, like almost every ani
mal that lives there."
Within days, two petitions one
calling on Brinkley to immediately

resign and the other requesting that
he "publicly apologize, and in a high
ly-visible way" sprang up on the
website Change.org, and the column
began attracting media coverage in
the United States and Vietnam. The
first petition has over 4,000 signees,
and the second has over 1,600.
On Feb. 1, Tribune Media Servic
es issued an apology, saying that the
column "did not meet our journalistic
standards" and that it had "provoked
a highly critical response from our
readers."
Though Brinkley, a Pulitzer Prize
winner who was a foreign correspon
dent for The New York Times for
almost 25 years, said the column's
reception had been "unexpected and
quite surprising," he defended the
substance of the piece.
"What I wrote is what I observed
and what I learned in quite a number
of interviews," said Brinkley, who
conducted reporting during a 10-day
trip to Vietnam in late December and
early January.

Brinkley saicl he has been to Viet
nam "four or five times" and recent
ly published a book on neighboring
Cambodia.
"There's only one part of [the col
umn] that I did not phrase as well as
I should have, and that was the link
between food and aggression,"
Brinkley said.
Having spent months in Laos and
Cambodia, where people primarily
eat rice, Brinkley commented that
"the Vietnamese seemed a lot more
robust."
"It's perfectly logical," he said.
"If you don't eat protein, you're not
going to have a lot of energy."
Critics both national and on
campus â€”of Brinkley's column
argued that the piece presented neg
ative stereotypes about Vietnamese
culture. In an op-ed published in The
Daily, the Stanford Vietnamese Stu
dents' Association (SVSA) com
plained that the article lacked factu
