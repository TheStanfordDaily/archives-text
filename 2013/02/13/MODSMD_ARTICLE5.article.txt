## ASSU alters special fee hike limit Senate voted to lower parent increase allowed without petition 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At its Feb. 12 meeting, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate approved a bill
to lower the percent increase in funding
that special fees groups can request
without having to petition the student
body.
Before the bill was passed, special
fees groups that received funding the
previous year could request a 10 per
cent budget increase â€”in addition to
inflation without having to petition.
This year, special fees groups will only
be allowed to request a 7.1 percent
increase in the absence of any petition.
Appropriations Committee member
Daniela Olivos 'l5 said that the commit
tee created the bill after reexamining
funding data from previous years. His
torically special fees groups have
almost never pulled more than ten per
cent of their budget from reserves in
any given year. This led the commit
tee to decide on a lower allowed
budget increase of five percent plus
2.1 percent inflation, according to
Olivos.
"When we were reevaluating the
10 percent increase, we thought that
it was a substantial amount," Olivos
said. "We were also thinking that
since 10 percent is such a big num
ber, groups should petition if they
want to have another event or have
something larger."
Appropriations Committee
Chan* Nancy Pham 'l4 said that
financial officers were informed of
the change at a mandatory work
shop for special fees groups, but that
some groups may have been con
fused by the fact that the online doc
uments had not been updated and
still reflect last year's allowed budg
et increase.
However, Pham downplayed the

probability of any special fees
groups having difficulty with the
new policy saying that the commit
tee will work with groups who would
like to cut down their budget to the
7.1 percent increase but were not
able to do so.
"We haven't received any emails
about it," said Olivos, adding that
financial officers were first told
about the change at a meeting on
Feb. 4. "There has been time for
financial officers to submit their
budget and ask questions."
The Senate voted unanimously to
pass the bill.
ASSU Assistant Financial Man
ager Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4
announced that Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) will be launching
a low-risk loans program for ticket
ed events within the next few weeks.
Trusheim said that the program
would give senators the option to
loan money to groups who need
funding for ticketed events upfront,
with the expectation that these
groups will pay back the Senate
after collecting money for tickets.
Historically the Senate has subsi
dized these events from general fees

funds and allowed groups to keep
the ticket money.
Trusheim worked with Senator
Lauren Miller 'l5 and Olivos to
upload the ASSU's governing docu
ments onto a Wiki form. In the past,
senators have discussed the difficul
ty of finding and updating the gov
erning documents.
"It's going to be an easily accessi
ble version of the documents and
also provide away for the Senate to
go in and amend them when a bill
gets passed," Miller said about the
Wiki. "It's locked so that only cer
tain people can edit the documents,
but it's an easy way for anyone to go
on and see things."
Senators also passed two Publi
cations Board bills, allocating $6,000
to the Stanford Undergraduate
Research Journal and $3,333 to the
Stanford Journal of International
Relations, though Publications
Board chair Kathleen Chaykowski
'l3 did not attend the meeting to
present the bills. Chaykowski is a
Daily staffer.
