## BSP Oaxacan health program reinstated 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram has reinstated its Community
Health Program in Oaxaca, Mexico,
this upcoming summer after a three
year absence.
The program, which is also spon
sored by the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education and the School of
Medicine's Office of Community
Health, focuses on the health of Oaxa
can communities on both sides of the
Mexico-U.S. border.
"Students will get an understand
ing of community health in Oaxaca
and of the experience in health and
healthcare issues for the growing
number of migrants from Mexico,
creating a binational link where stu
dents will understand the root popu
lation they are serving here in the
U. 5.," said Ann Banchoff 'B7, co
director of the program and director
of educational programs at the Office
of Community Health.
The program was put on hold in
2010 after the U.S. government
issued a travel warning for all of
Mexico, as a result of a University
policy precluding students from trav
elling on University programs to
places subject to a travel warning.

Gabriel Garcia, professor of medi
cine and the program's co-director,
downplayed the risks of a program
situated in Oaxaca, for which the
travel warning was lifted in February
2012.
Michelle Neely 'll participated in
the Oaxaca program the year before
it was shelved. She described the pro
gram as a defining moment in her
academic experience at Stanford and
in shaping her future career.
"Forging relationships with Ann
Banchoff and Dr. Garcia impassioned
me about advocating for those who
are underserved back in America,"
Neely said. "It solidified my desire to
be a doctor."
Banchoff and Garcia plan to
accept 15 students into the program,
encouraging all applicants with an
interest in public health but empha
sizing the value of Spanish language
proficiency.
"We are so intertwined with the
Mexican state and people... it is
almost a requirement to be effective
in work to speak Spanish and to
understand the population and com
munity," Banchoff said.
The deadline to apply is Feb. 17,
and students will be selected before
the start of the spring quarter.
Selected students will participate in
Med 259: Oaxacan Health on Both
Sides of the Border during spring
quarter, followed by four weeks of
fieldwork in Oaxaca during the sum
mer with Banchoff and Garcia.
In addition to shadowing medics
in various medical clinics and hospi
tals, the program provides opportu
nities for immersion in Oaxacan cul
ture. Students will participate in
homestays, language and culture
classes and interact with community
and local non-governmental organi
zations.
"Soak it up, keep your eyes open

and your heart open, because it is
such an invaluable and rich experi
ence culturally, medically and per
sonally," Neely said.
Garcia framed the program as
relevant to Stanford students by
means of the sister-city relationship
between Palo Alto and Oaxaca and
through the transfer of Oaxacans'
health concerns to California
through immigration.
"Oaxaca is not only the source of
migrants to the service industry and
farms to this country but it is also
the source of migrants to the service
industry and farms throughout Mex
ico," Garcia said. "We were very
interested in being able to study
health from both the sending and
receiving community"
Upon return to the United States,
the program encourages students to
continue working to improve health
care conditions for Oaxacan commu

nities in Northern California.
"We encourage and facilitate it,"
Banchoff said. "Many [past partici
pants] participate in our Community
Health Advocacy Program, through
which students work in local clinics
and other service agencies providing
service to migrants and immigrant
communities."
While the program is funded only
through 2014, both Banchoff and
Garcia are optimistic that the fund
ing will continue as long as there is
no travel warning.
"Through long-term partner
ships, Stanford and this program can
make a lasting contribution. It just
takes a long-term commitment in
order to do that," Banchoff said.
"You can't just show up and expect to
make a difference."
