## BSP Oaxacan health program reinstated 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
The Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram has reinstated its Community
Health Program in Oaxaca, Mexico,
this upcoming summer after a three
year absence.
The program, which is also spon
sored by the Vice Provost of Under
graduate Education and the School of
Medicine's Office of Community
Health, focuses on the health of Oaxa
can communities on both sides of the
Mexico-U.S. border.
"Students will get an understand
ing of community health in Oaxaca
and of the experience in health and
healthcare issues for the growing
number of migrants from Mexico,
creating a binational link where stu
dents will understand the root popu
lation they are serving here in the
U. 5.," said Ann Banchoff 'B7, co
director of the program and director
of educational programs at the Office
of Community Health.
The program was put on hold in
2010 after the U.S. government
issued a travel warning for all of
Mexico, as a result of a University
policy precluding students from trav
elling on University programs to
places subject to a travel warning.

Gabriel Garcia, professor of medi
cine and the program's co-director,
downplayed the risks of a program
situated in Oaxaca, for which the
travel warning was lifted in February
2012.
Michelle Neely 'll participated in
the Oaxaca program the year before
it was shelved. She described the pro
gram as a defining moment in her
academic experience at Stanford and
in shaping her future career.
"Forging relationships with Ann
Banchoff and Dr. Garcia impassioned
me about advocating for those who
are underserved back in America,"
Neely said. "It solidified my desire to
be a doctor."
Banchoff and Garcia plan to
accept 15 students into the program,
encouraging all applicants with an
interest in public health but empha
sizing the value of Spanish language
proficiency.
"We are so intertwined with the
Mexican state and people... it is
almost a requirement to be effective
in work to speak Spanish and to
understand the population and com
munity," Banchoff said.
The deadline to apply is Feb. 17,
