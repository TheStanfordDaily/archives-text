## Trustees raise tuition, discuss online education 
### Olivia Moore 
Stanford's Board of Trustees
approved a tuition increase and dis
cussed developments in online edu
cation at its Feb. 12 meeting.
For the 2013-2014 academic year,
tuition will increase 3.5 percent for
all undergraduate and most gradu
ate students, including law and med
ical students. First-year students at
the Graduate School of Business will
see a 3.9 percent increase.
The overall cost of attending
Stanford as an undergraduate will
total $56,411 next year, which does
not include personal expenses or the
cost of books and supplies. First
year MBA students will pay $59,534
in cumulative costs, while graduate
engineering students will pay
$45,480, and general graduate stu
dents will pay $42,690.
According to Steven Denning
MBA '7B, chair of the Board of
Trustees, financial aid increased at
the same rate as tuition, with $l3O
million allocated in need-based aid
this year. Denning said that the cur
rent net tuition after financial aid is
equivalent to the tuition in 1994 in

inflation-adjusted dollars.
"I think that's a pretty clear indica
tion of Stanford's commitment to hold
down what appeal's to be an ever
increasing number," Denning said.
Trustees also approved several
building projects, most of which
Denning said were "small projects
that are less critical."
According to Denning, the two
most notable projects were a partial
construction approval and budget
increase for the McMurtry Building
and the approval of $lOO million in
capital for Stanford Energy System
Innovations (SESI) projects.
Trustees discussed online educa
tion for the majority of the meeting,
with presentations from the School
of Education, the School of Medi
cine, the School of Engineering and
the Graduate School of Business.
"When one says online educa
tion, it represents a wide array of
activity from things going on here on
campus to the so-called MOOCs
[massive open online courses]," Den
ning said. "The attempt was to give
the board a broader and richer
understanding of what one means
when [one says] online education."
Denning said that the trustees
will discuss longer-term issues at
their next meeting.
