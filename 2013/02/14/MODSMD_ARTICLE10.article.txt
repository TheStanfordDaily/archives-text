## Stanford researchers discover patterns of ant reproduction 
### â€” Molly Vorwerck 
Stanford biologists have recently
discovered new reproductive pat
terns among harvester ant colonies,
identifying for the first time parental
lineages within wild ant populations
and noting longer-than-expected
longevity in reproduction among
queen ants.
"Most animals produce offspring
for awhile, and then they enter a life
stage where they don't," said Debo
rah Gordon M.S. '77, a professor of
biology and leader of the project, to
the Stanford News Service. "These
queen ants are mating once, storing
that sperm in a specific sac, keeping
it alive and using it to fertilize eggs
for another 25 years."
Gordon has been studying the
same colony of harvester ants for the
past 28 years in an effort to better
understand the species.
For this specific project, her
group took DNA samples of each
colony to determine which colonies
were genetically related. In con
junction with observational analy
sis, Gordon was able to identify the
original queen ant and the order in
which her daughter queens estab
lished new colonies. The researchers
also discovered that only 25 percent
of these colonies were able to repro
duce at all, indicative that many
daughter queens are unsuccessful
reproducers.

Their study was published on Jan.
31 in the Journal of Animal Ecology.
