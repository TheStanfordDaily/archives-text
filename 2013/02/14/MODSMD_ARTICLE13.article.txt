## Hilarity ahead of holes-in-one 
### Joseph Beyda 
Last Thursday through
Sunday were perhaps the
four quietest days of Jim
Harbaugh's life. As a
competitor in the AT&T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, he
wasn't allowed to scream, shout or
otherwise contort his head for a good
96 hours, which most of us in the Bay
Area see as uncharted territory. And
if Jim Harbaugh keeps calm, who
has the right to do otherwise?
But in their enforcement of the
PGAs spectator-camera ban, some
of the security guards at Pebble
weren't quite as laid back as the for
mer Cardinal coach. They were in
full force at the event for the second
year in a row, scanning galleries and
grandstands for upright iPhones
whose owners would need to be
scolded. (I almost had mine confis
cated last year.)
As I wrote last year, the pro-am
at Pebble isn't like any other PGA
event. To quote myself, celebrity con
testants bring "levity to a sport that
most non-players see as too drawn
out, too uneventful and too preten
tious," creating a fan atmosphere
that is otherwise absent from the
world of golf. That's what makes it
memorable.
And in today's world, memories
often count for a whole lot more if
they're saved on a camera phone.
For example, fans who paid $lOO for
a seat at the Rose Parade seemed
perfectly content watching it
through an iPhone screen. I was as
guilty of this as anyone, and I have
photos of just about every float to
prove it.
IHUM doesn't exist anymore, so
I'm not going to get into the societal
implications of our obsession with
the camera app. But I know I'm not
the only one who would have loved to
capture former Cal star Aaron
Rodgers fouling a drive into the
ocean or everybody's favorite Kung-
Fu Panda fodder, Justin Verlander,
shooting from one bunker to the
next. We'll have to rely on our brains
alone to remember Huey "Some of
my Lies are Time" Lewis hitting a
great tee shot to the par-three fifth
green and tennis star Andy Rod
dick tossing a football with
Rodgers on the historic 18th fair
way.
If the whole appeal of the event
is to allow the celebrities who
are more than willing to sign auto
graphs and pose for pictures in
between shots —to interact with
fans, it shouldn't be an offense for
spectators to capture the moment.
At the same time, the PGA can't
turn its back on the professional
golfers who participate in the
event for its $6.5-million purse,
$1,152,000 first prize and 500
FedEx Cup Points. And it's hard to
blame the PGA for its harsh
restrictions on cameras. Golf is a
difficult enough sport without
shutters, flashes and weird, digi
tized noises going off all over the
place.
The tournament's 2012 winner,
Phil Mickelson, is one of the Tour's
most outspoken opponents of cam
era phones at events. Some play
ers are already less than pleased
with the tournament at Pebble
Beach; Tiger Woods took nearly a
decade off from the event because
of its "celebrity-driven crowds"
before making a one-time reap
pearance in 2012. (He missed it
again this year.) Lose the camera
restrictions and you probably lose
the players, making the nation's
premiere pro-am event just a
celebrity tournament. At a course
that embarrasses all but the best
golfers in the world, that would be
disastrous for the event's appeal.
Two very different cultures are
juxtaposed at Pebble: the high
brow, genteel world of golf and the
impatient, needy world of the mod
ern sports fan. When they clash,
the latter usually wins.
There's a reason that the only
two golf films to ever make it big
with the American public, "Cad
dyshack" and "Happy Gilmore,"
put puns ahead of putting and
hilarity ahead of holes-in-one. As a
professional sport, golf doesn't
really lend itself to that, but it has
to make some compromises if it
wants to keep fans involved.
So adapt or die, PGA. End the
camera ban for all events and leave
the players with no other choice
than to deal with it. Take a mes
sage from one of your own golfers,
D.A. Points, who won the 2011 title
at Pebble while partnering with
Murray and his unquenchable
thirst for distracting his partners
by joking with the crowd. Points
spoke of how Murray's often
unappreciated antics helped
"loosen me up" and added that
"the crowd was having a lot more
fun than the crowd at Augusta,"
the site of The Masters.
Even though golf revenues
come from television rights more
than admission fees, without the
crowd there would be no tourna
ment. Golfers have already
learned to live with blowing winds

and chirping birds, and it's time to
add camera shutters to that list
even the weird, digitized ones.
If professional golfers can't
handle that, maybe it's time we
set Jim Harbaugh lose on them.
Besides, he's been holding it in.

Joseph Beyda is currently taking
private lessons from Jim Harbaugh
on throwing temper tantrums,
spitting as much as possible when
talking and giving the media the
cold shoulder. Persuade him not to
