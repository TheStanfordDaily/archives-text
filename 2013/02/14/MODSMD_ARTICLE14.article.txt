# OUT FOR REVENGE
## 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a night made for two hope
fully this isn't the reminder you
needed about Valentine's day
Stanford begins its second run
through Pac-12 opponents when it
hosts USC tonight.
Two is actually a fitting number
to sum up the Card's and Trojan's
second date of the season.
USC defeated Stanford by that
amount in their previous meeting in
January. A pair of free throws by
senior guard Jio Fontan, who fin
ished with a team high 15 points, put
the Trojans ahead for good at 71-69.
Sophomore guard Chasson Randle
had a chance to tie the game but
missed a layup, and junior forward
Dwight Powell missed the put-back
dunk. Randle was held scoreless in
the January meeting uncharac
teristic for the starter who is aver
aging 13.6 ppg â€”after averaging
13 points in the 2011-2012 series
against USC.
Two is also the number of losses
Stanford has at home the Card is
10-2 at Maples Pavilion as well as
the number of wins USC has on the
road. USC is 2-6 on foreign courts.
Their first away win came at lowly
Utah, but their second win was
against a strong UCLA team. The
Trojans have experienced a marked
improvement overall since both
games and are coming into Maples
off of a three game win streak, win
ning four of their past six games.
Stanford's home losses came
against Washington State and Col
orado, but since the Colorado loss,
the Cardinal is 4-5 overall.
The Cardinal and Trojans are
cuddled up in the standings, too.
The teams are part of a four-way tie
for fifth place, but only two games
separate that pack from the three
