# OUT FOR REVENGE
## 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a night made for two hope
fully this isn't the reminder you
needed about Valentine's day
Stanford begins its second run
through Pac-12 opponents when it
hosts USC tonight.
Two is actually a fitting number
to sum up the Card's and Trojan's
second date of the season.
USC defeated Stanford by that
amount in their previous meeting in
January. A pair of free throws by
senior guard Jio Fontan, who fin
ished with a team high 15 points, put
the Trojans ahead for good at 71-69.
Sophomore guard Chasson Randle
had a chance to tie the game but
missed a layup, and junior forward
Dwight Powell missed the put-back
dunk. Randle was held scoreless in
the January meeting uncharac
teristic for the starter who is aver
aging 13.6 ppg —after averaging
13 points in the 2011-2012 series
against USC.
Two is also the number of losses
Stanford has at home the Card is
10-2 at Maples Pavilion as well as
the number of wins USC has on the
road. USC is 2-6 on foreign courts.
Their first away win came at lowly
Utah, but their second win was
against a strong UCLA team. The
Trojans have experienced a marked
improvement overall since both
games and are coming into Maples
off of a three game win streak, win
ning four of their past six games.
Stanford's home losses came
against Washington State and Col
orado, but since the Colorado loss,
the Cardinal is 4-5 overall.
The Cardinal and Trojans are
cuddled up in the standings, too.
The teams are part of a four-way tie
for fifth place, but only two games
separate that pack from the three

way tie for first.
Despite the trend of deuces,
three-point shooting will probably
be the deciding factor in this game.
Stanford leads the league in shoot
ing percentage from long range
during Pac-12 play at 45.1 percent.
USC, while not exactly right on its
heels, stands second at 36.8 percent.

Stanford's percentage is bol
stered by junior center John Gage's
outlandish accuracy in Pac-12 play. He
is shooting 63.3 percent on 21-33
shooting in Pac-12 games this season.
Gage has provided Stanford with
bursts of scoring when coming off of
the bench, even with limited playing
time. The reserve is seeing only 13
minutes per game of court time this
season, despite being the Pac-12's
most accurate three-point shooter.
He'll have some competition for
long-range supremacy, though.
USC's junior guard J.T. Terrel is
leading the conference with 2.3
made three-pointers per game dur
ing Pac-12 play. He is also in the top
20 in scoring in conference games
with 10.6 points per game.
Still, on the season Gage is aver
aging fewer points per game (six
ppg) than every starter except for
senior forward Andy Brown (5.9
ppg). Brown has solidified his spot
in the starting lineup for the Cardi
nal, which went through so many
changes earlier in the season. Head
coach Jonny Dawkins seems to have
settled with Brown in the stalling
lineup after having started 12 differ
ent players throughout the year.
Brown, typically a role player,

had a record setting scoring night
against USC in January. He fin
ished with a career and game high
17 points coming off of the bench.
Leading the Trojans in scoring is
senior forward Eric Wise with 12.3
ppg. Wise is both the playmaker
and shot taker, shooting 49% from
the field.
USC may have scorers, but they
don't have the rebounding force of
Powell and junior forward Josh
Huestis. Powell is averaging 15.1
ppg with 6.9 rpg, while Huestis is
averaging nine points and nine
rebounds per game.
Randle and Powell will be look
ing for revenge and making every
layup and put-back to ensure the
game doesn't go down to the final
seconds of play for a second time.
USC has also won six of the past 10
meetings against the Card, so
they'll be hungry to make it seven.
Here is a final Valentine's Day
morsel to help move dinner conver
sation along: Stanford has lost its
past two games played on February
14th and has not hosted a game on
this date since 1993.

heels, stands second at 36.8 percent.

Stanford's percentage is bol
stered by junior center John Gage's
outlandish accuracy in Pac-12 play. He
is shooting 63.3 percent on 21-33
shooting in Pac-12 games this season.
Gage has provided Stanford with
bursts of scoring when coming off of
the bench, even with limited playing
time. The reserve is seeing only 13
minutes per game of court time this
season, despite being the Pac-12's
most accurate three-point shooter.
He'll have some competition for
long-range supremacy, though.
USC's junior guard J.T. Terrel is
leading the conference with 2.3
made three-pointers per game dur
ing Pac-12 play. He is also in the top
20 in scoring in conference games
with 10.6 points per game.
Still, on the season Gage is aver
aging fewer points per game (six
ppg) than every starter except for
senior forward Andy Brown (5.9
ppg). Brown has solidified his spot
in the starting lineup for the Cardi
nal, which went through so many
changes earlier in the season. Head
coach Jonny Dawkins seems to have
settled with Brown in the stalling
lineup after having started 12 differ
ent players throughout the year.
Brown, typically a role player,

had a record setting scoring night
against USC in January. He fin
ished with a career and game high
17 points coming off of the bench.
Leading the Trojans in scoring is
senior forward Eric Wise with 12.3
ppg. Wise is both the playmaker
and shot taker, shooting 49% from
the field.
USC may have scorers, but they
don't have the rebounding force of
Powell and junior forward Josh
Huestis. Powell is averaging 15.1
ppg with 6.9 rpg, while Huestis is
averaging nine points and nine
rebounds per game.
Randle and Powell will be look
ing for revenge and making every
layup and put-back to ensure the
game doesn't go down to the final
seconds of play for a second time.
USC has also won six of the past 10
meetings against the Card, so
they'll be hungry to make it seven.
Here is a final Valentine's Day
morsel to help move dinner conver
sation along: Stanford has lost its
past two games played on February
14th and has not hosted a game on
this date since 1993.
