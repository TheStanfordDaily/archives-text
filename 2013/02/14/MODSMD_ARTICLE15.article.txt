## YOUNG CARD, HIGH HOPES 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team is very clear about its goal this
season: win a national champi
onship.
"They have their eyes on the
prize and there's a lot of great ener
gy," said head coach Amy Bokker.
"They have then- sights set big and
are really focused, so we're really
excited about that as a staff."
Last season, the Cardinal went 8-
10 and was kept from the NCAA
tournament after losing to Oregon

13-10 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) championship
game. With the win, Oregon claimed
the MPSF's automatic bid into the
tournament and the Cardinal was
not awarded one of the three at
large bids available.
As of 2013, the NCAA has
expanded the women's lacrosse
postseason field from 16 to 26 teams,
opening up 10 more at-large berths.
However, the Cardinal will still try
to earn its spot by winning the
MPSF.
To do so, Bokker said Stanford
plans to use its speed and athleti

cism to topple its opponents.
"We feel like we have a really
athletic and fast team," Bokker said.
"We'd like to play up-tempo and run
our midfield lines through so that we
can push the pace along with playing
a high-pressure defense."
The Cardinal has just two sen
iors on the roster, defender Eliza
beth Adam and midfielder Carolyn
Bradley. Both players will serve as
captains this year along with junior
midfielder Anna Kim.
"We are just trying to use our
experience from the past three
years to make sure that everyone is

adjusting to preseason and doing
everything they can, mentally and
physically, to get ready," Adam said.
Despite the small senior class,
Bokker said her team has a strong
group of leaders, particularly among
the juniors.
"Rachel Ozer is a big leader for
us [on the offensive end]," Bokker
said. "Nina Swanson is a junior on
the defensive end, so she's the one
that provides a lot of leadership in
that area, as well as our goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz."
Ozer redshirted last season with an injury,
but returns this year along with nine 2012
starters. Besides Kim, Stanford will look to
sophomores Hannah Farr and Emily New
strom to fill the offensive void left by the
graduated Emilie Boeri, the Cardinal's lead
ing scorer from a year ago. Newstrom was sec
ond on the team with 28 goals last season, while
Kim posted 25 goals in just 11 games of action.
At the other end, Munoz is back in the cage,
where she played every minute for the Cardi
nal en route to earning all-conference recogni
tion in 2012.
Stanford also boasts a strong group of new
comers. Bokker cited seven freshmen that are
expected to contribute light away, particularly
Mackenzie Tesei, who will take draws for the
Cardinal, and speedy midfielder Lucy Dikeou.

"We are really excited about the depth of
our freshman class," Bokker said. "They've
really integrated very well."
According to the seniors, after performing
well in preseason, the team is eager for the
real games to start.
"Everyone is working really hard and
doing a really good job preparing themselves
for what's to come," Bradley said. "We have a
lot of experience coming back on the team, and
our freshmen have really geared up and they
are ready to go it's exciting."
Stanford will have the chance to test itself
right away in its season-opening home
matchup against perennial contender Notre
Dame on Saturday at 3 p.m.
"Notre Dame is not only a rival of Stanford
in general, but it's also the first game so we're
definitely focused on that," Bokker said. "I
don't mean to be cliche, but we just want to
take it one game at a time and focus on each
one as we go through."
