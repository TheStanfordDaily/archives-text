# FINAL STOP: BERKELEY

Two of the nation's strongest women's
swimming squads will clash on Saturday in
what figures to be a hard-fought battle. No. 2
Stanford (7-1,4-0 Pac-12) and No. 7 Cal (6-2,2-
2) will once again fight for supremacy of the
Bay Area in the final regular-season dual meet
of the season.
Coming into last year's regular season
finale, the Golden Bears were ranked number
one in the nation and possessed a perfect
record of 7-0. On that memorable Saturday

afternoon, the Cardinal women pulled off an
upset of a Cal team that would eventually go on
to become the national champions, showing the
nation that even the strongest teams can some
times underperform in dual meets.
That is exactly why Stanford should prepare
to be tested by a talented Cal squad that
remains one of the strongest in the nation
despite its pedestrian Pac-12 record of 2-2. In
order for the Cardinal to finish a second
straight season undefeated in the Pac-12, it
needs to hold off a motivated Golden Bears
team hoping to finish with a winning conference
record.

"We know that they are going to be good, so
we're just going to focus on what we can do, run
our races and see what happens," said senior
Andi Murez.
The Cardinal comes into this matchup unde
feated in its past five dual meets, highlighted by
a huge victory over No. 1 USC two weekends
ago. The momentum certainly swings in Stan
ford's favor, as the Golden Bears have dropped
two of their last four dual meets and seem to be
uncharacteristically stumbling down the stretch
against tougher Pac-12 competition.

Junior Kirstie Chen (above) finished 13th in the 200 fly at the Pac-12 meet last year. She swam a best time of 1:58.61 in the 2011-2012 season. Junior Felicia Lee and
sophomore sprinting specialist Maddy Schaefer will lead the Cardinal against Cal's Caitlin Leverenz, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics in the 200 IM.
