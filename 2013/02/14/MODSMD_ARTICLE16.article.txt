Two of the nation's strongest women's
swimming squads will clash on Saturday in
what figures to be a hard-fought battle. No. 2
Stanford (7-1,4-0 Pac-12) and No. 7 Cal (6-2,2-
2) will once again fight for supremacy of the
Bay Area in the final regular-season dual meet
of the season.
Coming into last year's regular season
finale, the Golden Bears were ranked number
one in the nation and possessed a perfect
record of 7-0. On that memorable Saturday

afternoon, the Cardinal women pulled off an
upset of a Cal team that would eventually go on
to become the national champions, showing the
nation that even the strongest teams can some
times underperform in dual meets.
That is exactly why Stanford should prepare
to be tested by a talented Cal squad that
remains one of the strongest in the nation
despite its pedestrian Pac-12 record of 2-2. In
order for the Cardinal to finish a second
straight season undefeated in the Pac-12, it
needs to hold off a motivated Golden Bears
team hoping to finish with a winning conference
record.

"We know that they are going to be good, so
we're just going to focus on what we can do, run
our races and see what happens," said senior
Andi Murez.
The Cardinal comes into this matchup unde
feated in its past five dual meets, highlighted by
a huge victory over No. 1 USC two weekends
ago. The momentum certainly swings in Stan
ford's favor, as the Golden Bears have dropped
two of their last four dual meets and seem to be
uncharacteristically stumbling down the stretch
against tougher Pac-12 competition.

Junior Kirstie Chen (above) finished 13th in the 200 fly at the Pac-12 meet last year. She swam a best time of 1:58.61 in the 2011-2012 season. Junior Felicia Lee and
sophomore sprinting specialist Maddy Schaefer will lead the Cardinal against Cal's Caitlin Leverenz, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics in the 200 IM.
Versatile junior Felicia Lee will
help lead the charge for the Cardi
nal. Lee is the defending national
swimmer of the week after a huge
set against UCLA and USC in
which she won four individual
events, was a part of three relay
winning teams and broke a pool
record twice in as many days. The
Cardinal will look for another
strong performance out of Lee to
spur it to another victory.
Murez and sophomore Maddy
Schaefer, two of the strongest
freestyle swimmers in the nation,
will also try to help the Cardinal
out with another strong perform
ance. Schaefer owns the nation's
third-fastest time in the 50-yard
freestyle and the fourth-fastest
time in the 100-yard freestyle.
Murez, one of the most dependable
contributors on the team, owns
top-10 times in both the 100-yard
and 200-yard freestyle events.
Cal boasts formidable athletes
for the butterfly, breaststroke and
individual medley events. Olympic

gold medalist Rachel Bootsma has
not been stellar in her signature
event, the backstroke, this season.
However, she is one of the nation's
strongest butterfly swimmers and
is a threat in multiple strokes.
Senior Caitlin Leverenz of Cal,
herself an Olympic bronze medal
ist, has long since established her
self as one of the best individual
medley (IM) swimmers in the
nation. She owns the nation's sec
ond-fastest time in the 200-yard
event and the fourth-fastest time
in the 400-yard event. Stanford's
talented crew of IM swimmers will
have their work cut out for them
against Leverenz.
Cal's incredible depth also
gives them great versatility in the
relays. As a result, they own the
nation's top times in both the 200-
yard and 400-yard medley relays
and also have top-three times
nationally in all three freestyle
medley events, including the 800-
yard event.
While Cal looks formidable on
paper, it is a team that has shown
weakness at times. Stanford
should have a good chance at win
ning if it swims a strong overall
meet and is able to capitalize on
those weaknesses.

As the regular season winds
down and the team continues its
preparation for the upcoming
championship meets, it wants to
finish the season on a high note
and prepare itself both mentally
and physically for the challenges
that wait ahead. The players and
coaches have been preparing all
along for their true goal of a cham
pionship.
"We just want to have good
races all around," Schaefer said.
"Good finishes, good turns, good
details, since we're getting close to
championship meets."
Head coach Greg Meehan is
also stressing the importance of
the road ahead.
"Anytime that you have a dual
meet, especially against your big
rival, it adds to the excitement lev
el," he said. "But it's also an oppor
tunity for us to fine-tune our
details one more time before we
head to the Pac-12 and NCAA
Championships."
"We've been preparing since
September for our NCAA Champi
onships, and that's always been
our focus."

Two of the nation's strongest women's
swimming squads will clash on Saturday in
what figures to be a hard-fought battle. No. 2
Stanford (7-1,4-0 Pac-12) and No. 7 Cal (6-2,2-
2) will once again fight for supremacy of the
Bay Area in the final regular-season dual meet
of the season.
Coming into last year's regular season
finale, the Golden Bears were ranked number
one in the nation and possessed a perfect
record of 7-0. On that memorable Saturday

afternoon, the Cardinal women pulled off an
upset of a Cal team that would eventually go on
to become the national champions, showing the
nation that even the strongest teams can some
times underperform in dual meets.
That is exactly why Stanford should prepare
to be tested by a talented Cal squad that
remains one of the strongest in the nation
despite its pedestrian Pac-12 record of 2-2. In
order for the Cardinal to finish a second
straight season undefeated in the Pac-12, it
needs to hold off a motivated Golden Bears
team hoping to finish with a winning conference
record.

"We know that they are going to be good, so
we're just going to focus on what we can do, run
our races and see what happens," said senior
Andi Murez.
The Cardinal comes into this matchup unde
feated in its past five dual meets, highlighted by
a huge victory over No. 1 USC two weekends
ago. The momentum certainly swings in Stan
ford's favor, as the Golden Bears have dropped
two of their last four dual meets and seem to be
uncharacteristically stumbling down the stretch
against tougher Pac-12 competition.

Junior Kirstie Chen (above) finished 13th in the 200 fly at the Pac-12 meet last year. She swam a best time of 1:58.61 in the 2011-2012 season. Junior Felicia Lee and
sophomore sprinting specialist Maddy Schaefer will lead the Cardinal against Cal's Caitlin Leverenz, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics in the 200 IM.
Versatile junior Felicia Lee will
help lead the charge for the Cardi
nal. Lee is the defending national
swimmer of the week after a huge
set against UCLA and USC in
which she won four individual
events, was a part of three relay
winning teams and broke a pool
record twice in as many days. The
Cardinal will look for another
strong performance out of Lee to
spur it to another victory.
Murez and sophomore Maddy
Schaefer, two of the strongest
freestyle swimmers in the nation,
will also try to help the Cardinal
out with another strong perform
ance. Schaefer owns the nation's
third-fastest time in the 50-yard
freestyle and the fourth-fastest
time in the 100-yard freestyle.
Murez, one of the most dependable
contributors on the team, owns
top-10 times in both the 100-yard
and 200-yard freestyle events.
Cal boasts formidable athletes
for the butterfly, breaststroke and
individual medley events. Olympic

gold medalist Rachel Bootsma has
not been stellar in her signature
event, the backstroke, this season.
However, she is one of the nation's
strongest butterfly swimmers and
is a threat in multiple strokes.
Senior Caitlin Leverenz of Cal,
herself an Olympic bronze medal
ist, has long since established her
self as one of the best individual
medley (IM) swimmers in the
nation. She owns the nation's sec
ond-fastest time in the 200-yard
event and the fourth-fastest time
in the 400-yard event. Stanford's
talented crew of IM swimmers will
have their work cut out for them
against Leverenz.
Cal's incredible depth also
gives them great versatility in the
relays. As a result, they own the
nation's top times in both the 200-
yard and 400-yard medley relays
and also have top-three times
nationally in all three freestyle
medley events, including the 800-
yard event.
While Cal looks formidable on
paper, it is a team that has shown
weakness at times. Stanford
should have a good chance at win
ning if it swims a strong overall
meet and is able to capitalize on
those weaknesses.

As the regular season winds
down and the team continues its
preparation for the upcoming
championship meets, it wants to
finish the season on a high note
and prepare itself both mentally
and physically for the challenges
that wait ahead. The players and
coaches have been preparing all
along for their true goal of a cham
pionship.
"We just want to have good
races all around," Schaefer said.
"Good finishes, good turns, good
details, since we're getting close to
championship meets."
Head coach Greg Meehan is
also stressing the importance of
the road ahead.
"Anytime that you have a dual
meet, especially against your big
rival, it adds to the excitement lev
el," he said. "But it's also an oppor
tunity for us to fine-tune our
details one more time before we
head to the Pac-12 and NCAA
Championships."
