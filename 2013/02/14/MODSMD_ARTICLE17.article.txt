## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY The 						Ethical Case Against Football 
### Adam Johnson 
With the Super Bowl and its
power outage now in the
history books, the NFL
has entered full offseason mode.
For executives and coaches around
the league, the 2013 season will
unofficially begin with the scouting
combine next week in Indianapolis.
Many fans follow this event with
avid interest, weighing the pros
and cons of whether their favorite
team should draft certain players.
But with the season over, I think
another dilemma should be on the
minds of NFL fans: whether sup
porting football, the sport they
have come to know and love, is eth
ical.
We all know that on-field hits
can ruin a player's life. In 2010, for
instance, Rutgers defensive tackle
Eric LeGrand was paralyzed from
the neck down while tackling the
kick returner. Such severe injuries,
however, remain relatively rare.
More common are concussions and
"sub-concussions" amassed over
players' careers careers that can
span decades.
In 2011, former Bears Pro Bowl
safety Dave Duerson shot himself
to death in the chest at the age of
50. He requested beforehand that
family members donate his brain to
science, and researchers who
examined it found "indisputable"
evidence that Duerson had suffered
from chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE), a neurode
generative disease resulting from
accumulated concussions and sub
concussions.
The symptoms of CTE include
memory loss, depression, confu
sion, and aggression. A long con
cussion history is not necessary
hits that appear less serious can
contribute to considerable damage
over time. And CTE is progressive,
so that even after a player with
repeated head trauma retires, his
condition will worsen.
Junior Seau, a famed linebacker
who committed suicide at the age of
43 also by a gunshot to the chest
was likewise found to have suf
fered from CTE. Of the 34 brain
tissues from former football play
ers submitted for research, 33
showed evidence of the disease.
Current and former players are
worried. They see old teammates
and role models succumb to depres
sion and suicides. They know the
results of the brain studies. They
wonder if a slip of memory or lash
ing out at a family member is a sign
of far worse things to come. As of
now, CTE can only be diagnosed
postmortem, and hundreds of living
NFL players have agreed to
donate their brains to research.
Often, these players refuse to
let their children play the sport

that they channeled into a career.
But with millions of kids playing
football each year, the supply is
unlikely to dry up anytime soon.
Perhaps if the league, which has
until now made a halfhearted
attempt to make the game safer, is
held morally and financially
accountable, more profound
changes will be made to the game.
One factor preventing change is
the millions of fans pouring billions
of dollars into the league; many of
these fans object to changes that
make the game less interesting to
watch. For these fans, some reflec
tion is perhaps necessary: is it ethi
cal to follow and support the sport
if it may prove deadly? Are NFL
stadiums simply modernized ver
sions of the Roman Coliseum,
where gladiators don't die in front
of spectators but rather many
years later, away from the spot
light?
Some people who are not overly
concerned about the danger of the
NFL point to other jobs with high
degrees of risk coal mining or
military infantry, for instance. Yet
these jobs (in theory) are crucial
for our nation's success; however
ingrained football is in our culture,
at the end of the day it is just enter
tainment for the millions of fans out
there.
Others will point out that pro
fessional players are paid for the
risks and choose to accept them.
Yet not only are the long-term
risks just now coming to the fore
front, but we have to ask our
selves how much choice is actual
ly present in the system; the most
gifted athletes are from a young
age channeled into the sport,
spending hours on the practice
field instead of studying. And while
most attend college, often their
scholarships are contingent on foot
ball, not academics, coming first.
While NFL players like Andrew
Luck have the luxury of a strong
education to fall back on, four out of
every five former NFL players go
bankrupt or have severe financial
difficulties within two years of
retirement.
I have always loved football, and
that may not change anytime soon.
But at the same time, I am becom
ing increasingly troubled by the
sport. Whereas once I used to
cheer for a monstrous hit, I now
cringe, even if the player pops up
and appears fine. These are fellow
humans, and whatever urges we
may have for entertainment and
competition, we should not forget
that fact.

How do you react to crushing hits?
