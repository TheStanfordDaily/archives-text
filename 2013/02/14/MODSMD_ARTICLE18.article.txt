# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## The 						Struggle Continues 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
Last weekend, we traveled to
Johannesburg for our Bing
Cultural Excursion and visit
ed the South African Constitutional
Court, among other sites of memo
ry.
The Constitutional Court is
South Africa's equivalent of the
United States Supreme Court,
but its design and presentation
could not be more different than
that of our hallowed American
building of marble and looming
columns.
The court sits on the site of an
old high-security prison that
housed thousands of political dissi
dents and prisoners of all races
including Gandhi. Half of the walls
of the chamber itself were built
from the bricks of the old prison
walls. Inside, the public sits elevat
ed, looking down on the justices
and lawyers.
And outside the chambers, built
upon the old prison bricks is a dis
play in neon letters that reads: "A
LUTA CONTINUA," or "THE
STRUGGLE CONTINUES."
On the entrance to the building,
each of the 27 basic rights and prin
ciples of the South African Consti
tution is carved into a wood panel in
each of the country's 11 official lan
guages and sign language.
One of the remarkable things
about studying in South Africa has
been encountering how the state
addresses the history and legacy of
apartheid. This experience has
been especially interesting in con
trast to my perceptions of the Unit
ed States and its treatment of
indigenous and black populations.
Watching South Africa the
most unequal country in the world
confront its social issues, I've
grown interested in the notion of
refounding a country.
Our visit to the Court inspired
me to read through South Africa's
Constitution to get a better sense of
those 27 principles.
The preamble to the Constitu
tion begins with an acknowledg

ment of past suffering:
"We, the people of South
Africa,
Recognise the injustices of our
past;
Honour those who suffered for
justice and freedom in our
land;
Respect those who have worked
to build and develop our coun
try; and
Believe that South Africa.
belongs to all who live in it,
united in our diversity."
In its founding provisions, the
Constitution establishes that the
state is founded on the following
values:
1. Human dignity, the
achievement of equality and
the advancement of human
rights and freedoms.
2. Non-racialism and non
sexism.
3. Supremacy of the Consti
tution and the rule of law.
L Universal adult suffrage,
a national common voters roll,
regular elections and a multi
party system of democratic
government, to ensure
accountability, responsiveness
and openness.
The combination of these claus
es stands in stark contrast to the
"All men are created equal" and
"We the people of the United
States" that so glaringly excluded
the majority of those living on
"American" land.
The United States needs to
acknowledge that, to use Obama's
words from this year's State of the
Union address, "the basic bargain
that built America" was one of
structural inequality and injustice
towards indigenous Americans,
blacks, women and unpropertied
men. Beyond this fundamental
recognition, we also need to admit
that those injustices and inequali

ties continue through today, that
our ideals of liberty, justice and
freedom are as yet unachieved, and
that we as a nation need to commit
ourselves to the lifelong pursuit of
realizing these goals.
As it stands, our veneration of
the founding figures, documents,
institutions, and values as holy
blinds us to the structural injustice
all around us. Because, as I men
tioned last week, every office of
"democracy" and "justice" in the
United States is guilty of enabling
the opposite of such ideals from
Congress to the office of the Presi
dent, to the Supreme Court to the
FBI and CIA, to the Department of
Justice, and the police depart
ments, newspapers, local legisla
tures and courts of America.
To reiterate questions I've been
asking the last two weeks: I do not
understand how all of these institu
tions remain fundamentally
unchanged, even though they failed
in their most basic duties.
Just as monuments to Cecil
Rhodes (the great exploiter of
Africa) and Jan Smuts (the archi
tect of apartheid) stand tall and
plentifully around South Africa, so
too do these American institutions
remain unabashed and taunt us as
reminders of past and present
oppression.
While my instinct has often
been "We need to tear this shit
down," watching South Africa
change through its transition and
reconciliation process has shown
me that we cannot hide our trou
bled pasts, but must commemorate
how we have failed and use that
memory to inspire future action.
But without changing our per
spective, we will continue to perpe
trate and perpetuate crimes
against women, against ethnic
minorities, against the poor not
only in America, but around the
world.

"We, the people of South
Africa,
Recognise the injustices of our
past;
Honour those who suffered for
justice and freedom in our
land;
Respect those who have worked
to build and develop our coun
try; and
Believe that South Africa.
belongs to all who live in it,
united in our diversity."
In its founding provisions, the
Constitution establishes that the
state is founded on the following
values:
1. Human dignity, the
achievement of equality and
the advancement of human
rights and freedoms.
2. Non-racialism and non
sexism.
3. Supremacy of the Consti
tution and the rule of law.
L Universal adult suffrage,
a national common voters roll,
regular elections and a multi
party system of democratic
government, to ensure
accountability, responsiveness
and openness.
The combination of these claus
es stands in stark contrast to the
"All men are created equal" and
"We the people of the United
States" that so glaringly excluded
the majority of those living on
"American" land.
The United States needs to
acknowledge that, to use Obama's
words from this year's State of the
Union address, "the basic bargain
that built America" was one of
structural inequality and injustice
towards indigenous Americans,
blacks, women and unpropertied
men. Beyond this fundamental
recognition, we also need to admit
that those injustices and inequali

ties continue through today, that
our ideals of liberty, justice and
freedom are as yet unachieved, and
that we as a nation need to commit
ourselves to the lifelong pursuit of
realizing these goals.
As it stands, our veneration of
the founding figures, documents,
institutions, and values as holy
blinds us to the structural injustice
all around us. Because, as I men
tioned last week, every office of
"democracy" and "justice" in the
United States is guilty of enabling
the opposite of such ideals from
Congress to the office of the Presi
dent, to the Supreme Court to the
FBI and CIA, to the Department of
Justice, and the police depart
ments, newspapers, local legisla
tures and courts of America.
To reiterate questions I've been
asking the last two weeks: I do not
understand how all of these institu
tions remain fundamentally
unchanged, even though they failed
in their most basic duties.
Just as monuments to Cecil
Rhodes (the great exploiter of
Africa) and Jan Smuts (the archi
tect of apartheid) stand tall and
plentifully around South Africa, so
too do these American institutions
remain unabashed and taunt us as
reminders of past and present
oppression.
While my instinct has often
been "We need to tear this shit
down," watching South Africa
change through its transition and
reconciliation process has shown
me that we cannot hide our trou
bled pasts, but must commemorate
how we have failed and use that
memory to inspire future action.
But without changing our per
spective, we will continue to perpe
trate and perpetuate crimes
against women, against ethnic
minorities, against the poor not
only in America, but around the
world.
