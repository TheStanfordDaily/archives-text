## Frosh to release film on Huntington's experience 
### LIAM KINNEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Kristen Powers 'l6 was just three years
old when her mother began showing signs
of Huntington's disease. At such an early
age, Powers watched her young, lively
mother slowly lose her abilities to walk, talk
and even reason.
At age 11, Powers learned that she had a
50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic
disease. Although she wanted to get tested
sooner, Powers was forced to wait until she
turned 18 and was legally able to make that
decision.
Despite the high likelihood of inheriting
the debilitating condition, Powers said that
she never doubted her choice to get tested.
"I wanted to be able to have more power
behind my life decisions," Powers
explained.
At age 13, Powers began to film a docu
mentary chronicling her time dealing with
her mother's illness and the possibility of
inheriting it herself. The film, titled
"Twitch," is still in production, but has
already gained critical attention.
The film even deals with her mother's
death in 2011, at age 45. Powers had not yet
been tested.
When not working on "Twitch" as a high
school student in Chapel Hill, N.C., Powers
channeled her energies towards starting a
sustainable farming campaign that gained
national recognition. After being accepted
to Stanford for the Class of 2016, her farm
project secured her a spot as one of three
freshmen in Stanford's entering class
selected for a Compass Fellowship, a pro
gram sponsored by the Hass Center for
Public Service that fosters the growth of
student entrepreneurship.
At the end of her senior year of high
school, Powers' documentary landed her a
TEDXTeen Talk. Jess Teutonic, the curator
of TEDxTeen, worked closely with Powers
in the weeks preceding her talk, which was
filmed before she received her test results.
"I don't think I have ever met a more
poised, graceful, courageous, brave young
woman in my life," Teutonic said. "It was in
the most challenging moment in her life,
and she shined."
After hearing about her Stanford
acceptance, receiving her Compass fellow
ship and giving her TEDxTeen talk, Powers
was tested on May 18,2012. Her results came
back negative less than two weeks later.
According to Powers, the documentary
focuses on the decision-making behind

genetic testing and the how the disease
itself is "often stigmatized."
Powers said that while her mother was
in the throes of the disease, she was often
treated as though incapable of taking care
of herself and became the subject of com
plaints by neighbors for supposedly "being
drunk all the time." The discrimination
even extends to Rristen and her brother,
who also tested negative, since as carri
ers of the disease they are not eligible for
life insurance at any time in them lives.
Powers said that she hopes the film will
raise awareness of Huntington's disease
and start a more serious national conversa
tion about the stigma and potential cure.
She added that she hopes the documentary
helps "HD families come out of the closet"
and join the movement.
Although her film isn't even finished yet,
Powers was recently featured on a CBS
Sunday Morning segment on genetic dis
ease testing, where she talked about her
project.
Powers has continued to raise funds for
her documentary, which she views as a
source of support for other individuals
going through the same process with genet
ic testing for Huntington's or other dis
eases.
"It fit perfectly with my passion of using
film as a tool for education and my knowl
edge and experience with this specific top
ic," Powers said. "I didn't know anyone else
covering the youth perspective of genetic
testing. Most of the documentaries and sto-

When Kristen Powers '16 turned 18 in 2012, she decided to get tested for the
degenerative genetic condition Huntington's Disease, which runs in her family.

ries coming out related to Hunting
ton's Disease completely glazed
over those who had just arrived at
[the] testing age of 18 years."

However, Powers identified the
biggest hurdle she hopes to jump
with her film as boosting awareness
about the disease, and how it affects
not just victims but entire families.
"The biggest problem, I think,
with Huntington's disease is the
fact that it's very hidden and no
one wants to talk about it," Powers
said. "I'm really hoping Twitch will

get people to work together
towards this common goal of cur
ing Huntington's disease and
make it easier for people affected
by it to live with it and make it so
that less people feel alone, like I
did."
