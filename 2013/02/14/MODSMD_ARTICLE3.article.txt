# English professor Martin Evans dies at home
## Milton scholar fondly remembered by students, peers 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Professor of English John Martin Evans, a
staunch defender of the humanities who
taught at Stanford for almost 50 years, died on
Sunday night at his on-campus home, accord
ing to an email sent to English majors by
department chair Gavin Jones on Wednesday
morning.
"He was a wonderfully warm and generous
person," Jones said. "I remember him for his
energetic affection for literature, his dedica
tion to undergraduates, his wry humor and
general good spirited love of literature and

also his great dedication to the department
and to the University."
Evans was born in Cardiff, Wales, in 1935
and earned a 8.A., M.A. and D.Phil from
Oxford University. He moved to Stanford in
1963, becoming an Assistant Professor of
English.
Prom 1977 to 1981, Evans served as the
Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
He became the Director of Undergraduate
Studies for the English Department in 1981, a
position he held for five years, and served as
Chair of the English Department from 1988 to
1991.
"He had strong views and let them
be known, so I think he shaped the
department over the years in many,
many ways," said Professor of English
John Bender, who met Evans in 1967.
"He was a Welshman, and full of the
kind of energy and spiciness that people
associate with Wales."
Evans wrote a piece for Stanford
Magazine in March 2009 titled "What
Good Are the Humanities," in which he
argued that the humanities remain rele
vant while encouraging students to try
to understand different perspectives.
"Both kinds of knowledge, the objec
tive knowledge of the sciences and the
social sciences and the subjective knowl
edge of the humanities are necessary, I
believe, if we are to achieve even an
approximate understanding of our fel
low human beings," Evans wrote.
Other faculty members and students
said that Evans was known for his
vibrant personality and commitment to
undergraduate teaching.
Miles Osgood 'll audited one of
Evans' classes as a high school senior,
an experience that persuaded him to
attend Stanford and pursue an English
major. Evans eventually became
Osgood's major advisor, with Osgood
describing him as "very sweet, very fun
loving and very much loving what he
did."
"I remember having a conversation
with him a couple of years ago where he
said the school had been trying to offer
him more and more generous retire
ment packages over the years," Osgood
said. "[Evans] said 'Nope, I'm going to
stay here forever.'"
Osgood said he was particularly
impressed by Evans' knowledge of the
poet John Milton, a sentiment echoed by
Kyle O'Malley 'l3, a student advisor for
the Department of English who took a
class taught by Evans last fall and who
served on several committees with him.
"Milton was kind of like his bread
and butter," O'Malley said. "If you want
ed to learn about Milton at Stanford,
you took a class from Martin Evans. He

was this incredible master of Milton
that we had the privilege of having for
so long, somebody who really became a
jewel in the diadem of our department."
O'Malley said that Evans was an
extremely popular choice for English
students looking for a major or thesis
advisor.
According to Bender, Evans was also
involved in some of the administrative
aspects of the English department as a
former chair, including searching for
faculty and guiding promotions.
"One of the things that was so strik
ing about him was that he was so inclu
sive, so welcoming," said Professor of
English Michele Elam, who described
Evans as very supportive of female fac
ulty members to the extent of encour
aging them to take leadership posi
tions.
Elam said that Evans served as her
"unofficial mentor" when she first
began teaching at Stanford. One after
noon shortly after she joined the facul
ty, Evans invited Elam to his office for
a casual conversation that ended up
lasting two and a half hours.
"We sat down and just talked about
his classes and my classes, and he was
so unpretentious and so welcoming,"
she said. "He knew so much about not
just his field, but about the profession
and the department, and he was willing
to share that knowledge with me. That
kind of intellectual generosity is rare."
Evans was also an active volunteer,
and received the Richard W Lyman
award for faculty volunteer service to
the Stanford Alumni Association and
Stanford University in 1990. He also
won the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1985 and the Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching in
1988, and was named an Honored Schol
ar by the Milton Society of America in
2004.
"He was a University citizen," Ben
der said. "He wasn't just a member of
the English Department."
Jones said that Evans had been ill
for several months, and that his illness
prevented him from teaching any cours
es this year.
Evans is survived by his wife Mariel
la and his two daughters.

Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
He became the Director of Undergraduate
Studies for the English Department in 1981, a
position he held for five years, and served as
Chair of the English Department from 1988 to
1991.
"He had strong views and let them
be known, so I think he shaped the
department over the years in many,
many ways," said Professor of English
John Bender, who met Evans in 1967.
"He was a Welshman, and full of the
kind of energy and spiciness that people
associate with Wales."
Evans wrote a piece for Stanford
Magazine in March 2009 titled "What
Good Are the Humanities," in which he
argued that the humanities remain rele
vant while encouraging students to try
to understand different perspectives.
"Both kinds of knowledge, the objec
tive knowledge of the sciences and the
social sciences and the subjective knowl
edge of the humanities are necessary, I
believe, if we are to achieve even an
approximate understanding of our fel
low human beings," Evans wrote.
Other faculty members and students
said that Evans was known for his
vibrant personality and commitment to
undergraduate teaching.
Miles Osgood 'll audited one of
Evans' classes as a high school senior,
an experience that persuaded him to
attend Stanford and pursue an English
major. Evans eventually became
Osgood's major advisor, with Osgood
describing him as "very sweet, very fun
loving and very much loving what he
did."
"I remember having a conversation
with him a couple of years ago where he
said the school had been trying to offer
him more and more generous retire
ment packages over the years," Osgood
said. "[Evans] said 'Nope, I'm going to
stay here forever.'"
Osgood said he was particularly
impressed by Evans' knowledge of the
poet John Milton, a sentiment echoed by
Kyle O'Malley 'l3, a student advisor for
the Department of English who took a
class taught by Evans last fall and who
served on several committees with him.
"Milton was kind of like his bread
and butter," O'Malley said. "If you want
ed to learn about Milton at Stanford,
you took a class from Martin Evans. He

was this incredible master of Milton
that we had the privilege of having for
so long, somebody who really became a
jewel in the diadem of our department."
O'Malley said that Evans was an
extremely popular choice for English
students looking for a major or thesis
advisor.
According to Bender, Evans was also
involved in some of the administrative
aspects of the English department as a
former chair, including searching for
faculty and guiding promotions.
"One of the things that was so strik
ing about him was that he was so inclu
sive, so welcoming," said Professor of
English Michele Elam, who described
Evans as very supportive of female fac
ulty members to the extent of encour
aging them to take leadership posi
tions.
Elam said that Evans served as her
"unofficial mentor" when she first
began teaching at Stanford. One after
noon shortly after she joined the facul
ty, Evans invited Elam to his office for
a casual conversation that ended up
lasting two and a half hours.
"We sat down and just talked about
his classes and my classes, and he was
so unpretentious and so welcoming,"
she said. "He knew so much about not
just his field, but about the profession
and the department, and he was willing
to share that knowledge with me. That
kind of intellectual generosity is rare."
Evans was also an active volunteer,
and received the Richard W Lyman
award for faculty volunteer service to
the Stanford Alumni Association and
Stanford University in 1990. He also
won the Dean's Award for Distin
guished Teaching in 1985 and the Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching in
1988, and was named an Honored Schol
ar by the Milton Society of America in
2004.
"He was a University citizen," Ben
der said. "He wasn't just a member of
the English Department."
Jones said that Evans had been ill
for several months, and that his illness
prevented him from teaching any cours
es this year.
Evans is survived by his wife Mariel
la and his two daughters.
