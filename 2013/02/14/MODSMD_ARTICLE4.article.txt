# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Senate fosters loose funding ASSU Semite officials lack details, often fund student projects regardless 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Despite being responsible for disbursing
several hundred thousand dollars to student
groups each year, few members of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate have detailed knowl
edge of the funding requests they habitually
approve after little discussion, an issue attrib
utable at least in part to lax funding policies.

Both the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
and the Senate have a funding committee that
reviews all applications for funding based on a
set of guidelines for each type of expense, from
food and marketing to honoraria and travel
fees. Graduate and undergraduate financial
officers are required to meet with their respec
tive funding committee about their funding
request, after which the committee makes a
recommendation to the legislative body.
Groups requesting funding from the GSC
are also required to appear before the entire
GSC to answer questions, allowing
all of the members of the GSC to
more closely examine each funding
request and question student rep
resentatives. The Senate does not
ask groups requesting funding to
appear at a general Senate meet
ing.
While Assistant Financial Man
ager Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4 said that he has never seen
either group deny a funding
request, funding bills at the GSC
are voted on independently and
often involve more debate than
funding bills at the Senate, which
are almost always passed simulta
neously and without discussion.
"I think it just speaks to the dif
ferences in the two bodies,"
Trusheim said. "The Undergradu
ate Senate pretty much entirely
relies on the Appropriations Com
mittee to make decisions. They
might as well not vote on [funding
bills] at the meetings they don't
talk about them."
According to Trusheim, a GSC
member once brought up the issue
of whether or not groups who prof
it from ticket sales for a GSC-fund
ed event should split the profits
with the GSC. Trusheim called this
an "excellent point," and said that
he has never heard an idea like that
come from undergraduate sena
tors.
"Graduate students stay very
well connected to funds by making
people come to explain them and
having some sort of debate before
approving requests," he said.
"There is a lot to be said for keep
ing the legislative bodies really
thinking about funding at every
junction."
Another recent funding idea
produced by the GSC was a quiz
for financial officers about funding
bylaws, which GSC Funding Com
mittee Chair Anne-Laure Cuvilliez
Ph.D. 'lB created this summer. The
GSC strongly recommends that
financial officers take the quiz,
which asks them to apply informa
tion from the bylaws to practical
funding situations, before meeting
with the funding committee.
"It's a good way for them to
check that they know enough to be
able to make a good request and be
comfortable with level of conversa
tion in meeting," Cuvilliez said.
The Senate has no such funding
quiz, though Appropriations Com
mittee Chair Nancy Pham 'l4 said
it was a "smart" idea, as some
financial officers come to Appropri
ations Committee meetings
unaware of funding policies.

Financial officers for graduate
student groups also benefit from
the GSC's policy of requiring
group representatives to appear at
general GSC meetings, according
to Cuvilliez. These meetings give
the groups an opportunity to
appeal to the GSC as a whole and
receive more money than the fund
ing committee recommended.
Cuvilliez noted that, although

the funding committee uses their
guidelines to evaluate each request,
groups can bypass the guidelines
with the approval of the GSC.
According to Cuvilliez, this occurs
most often with the rental and pro
gramming expenses on funding
requests.
"The guidelines are just guide
lines, and the final call is by the
GSC," Cuvilliez said.
By contrast, Pham said that her
committee "just goes with the fund
ing policies."
According to Trusheim, the
GSC's direct use of proprietary
funds to put on events means GSC
members are more engaged with
the funding process compared to
their undergraduate peers.
The GSC spends about half of
the $300,000 they collect each year
from student activity fees on in
house programming, giving GSC
members the ability to propose and
organize their own events or spon
sor event ideas generated by other
students. The Senate is prohibited
from spending student activity fees
on their own events.
While Trusheim acknowledged
that senators have fewer incentives
to be involved with their funding
process, as they cannot host their
own events, he argued that that
detachment shouldn't preclude a
more critical and knowledge
approach to funding requests and
policies.
"I think that both bodies should
be really deeply considering all of
their funding requests and all of the
money that exits from their
accounts," Trusheim said. "They're
basically taxing students to provide
funding."

"Graduate students stay very
well connected to funds by making
people come to explain them and
having some sort of debate before
approving requests," he said.
"There is a lot to be said for keep
ing the legislative bodies really
thinking about funding at every
junction."
Another recent funding idea
produced by the GSC was a quiz
for financial officers about funding
bylaws, which GSC Funding Com
mittee Chair Anne-Laure Cuvilliez
Ph.D. 'lB created this summer. The
GSC strongly recommends that
financial officers take the quiz,
which asks them to apply informa
tion from the bylaws to practical
funding situations, before meeting
with the funding committee.
"It's a good way for them to
check that they know enough to be
able to make a good request and be
comfortable with level of conversa
tion in meeting," Cuvilliez said.
The Senate has no such funding
quiz, though Appropriations Com
mittee Chair Nancy Pham 'l4 said
it was a "smart" idea, as some
financial officers come to Appropri
ations Committee meetings
unaware of funding policies.

Financial officers for graduate
student groups also benefit from
the GSC's policy of requiring
group representatives to appear at
general GSC meetings, according
to Cuvilliez. These meetings give
the groups an opportunity to
appeal to the GSC as a whole and
receive more money than the fund
ing committee recommended.
Cuvilliez noted that, although

the funding committee uses their
guidelines to evaluate each request,
groups can bypass the guidelines
with the approval of the GSC.
According to Cuvilliez, this occurs
most often with the rental and pro
gramming expenses on funding
requests.
"The guidelines are just guide
lines, and the final call is by the
GSC," Cuvilliez said.
By contrast, Pham said that her
committee "just goes with the fund
ing policies."
According to Trusheim, the
GSC's direct use of proprietary
funds to put on events means GSC
members are more engaged with
the funding process compared to
their undergraduate peers.
The GSC spends about half of
the $300,000 they collect each year
from student activity fees on in
house programming, giving GSC
members the ability to propose and
organize their own events or spon
sor event ideas generated by other
students. The Senate is prohibited
from spending student activity fees
on their own events.
While Trusheim acknowledged
that senators have fewer incentives
to be involved with their funding
process, as they cannot host their
own events, he argued that that
detachment shouldn't preclude a
more critical and knowledge
approach to funding requests and
policies.
"I think that both bodies should
be really deeply considering all of
their funding requests and all of the
money that exits from their
accounts," Trusheim said. "They're
basically taxing students to provide
funding."
