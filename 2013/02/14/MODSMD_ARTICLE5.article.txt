## Startup acts as student marketplace Swapbox installs first exchange kiosk on campus in Daily office 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Swapbox, a startup co-founded by Neel
Murthy 'lO M.S. 'll to help students buy
and sell everything from textbooks to con
cert tickets, installed its first on-campus
kiosk this Tuesday at The Stanford Daily's
office.
Students can use the Swapbox website
or iOS app to browse for things to buy or
upload pictures and information about
items they want to sell. The purchase
amount is transferred from the buyer's
credit card to the seller's bank account,
and both parties are given a PIN code to
type into the kiosk when dropping off or
picking up the item.
Murthy came up with the idea behind
Swapbox after noticing the many items
stored in his dorm room for which he no

Swapbox aims to provide a central online marketplace
for students to buy and sell their used
goods, exchanging them through kiosks.
longer had use.
"I was here for six years I
paid a lot of tuition and I bought a
lot of books," Murthy said. "The
disconnect in my mind was that I
had all this stuff that I knew other
people needed, but I couldn't get
[it] to another student."
Murthy's childhood friend and
Swapbox co-founder Nitin Shan
taram helped him further develop
the idea into a business plan, and
Jay Borenstein '93 M.S. '94, lectur
er in computer science, joined the
Swapbox team as an advisor in late
2011 after Murthy enrolled in his
CS 210 class.
"I like to support all of my stu
dents and [Neel] was one of my
favorites," Borenstein said about
his role as an adviser. "I thought it
was an interesting and ambitious
idea, and I wanted to support it."
Murthy set up a "human Swap
box" this September to test the
program and gauge interest. Stu
dents dropped off and picked up
items from the Swapbox team at
Tresidder, with more than 60 trans
actions made during the pilot week.
Alanna Reyes 'l4 used the pilot
Swapbox to sell her Physics 41
textbook. Reyes said she chose
Swapbox because she found it
more convenient to use than a plat
form like e√üay or trying to sell the
textbook through a mailing list.
"I really liked the interface and
how it was directly on my phone
already, whereas I felt like if I used
or a website or tried to email some
thing around it would get lost in
the shuffle of emails," Reyes said,
adding that she appreciated the

fact that Swapbox directly deposit
ed the purchase amount into her
bank amount.
While Reyes expects Swapbox
to become popular on campus, she
acknowledged that the startup has
to overcome several significant
hurdles.
"I guess the major challenge it
faces right now, besides the fact
that it is kind of unknown, is gener
al competition and the fact that you
could easily complete a transaction
without it," Reyes said, noting that
many students use email lists or
Facebook groups to buy and sell
items.
Kush Nijhawan 'l6, who used
Swapbox to purchase a Math 51
textbook, said he also had a posi
tive experience with the service.
However, Nijhawan predicted that
the localized nature of Swapbox
might be limiting.
"If they wanted to improve
something, they could try to see if
they could make it more flexible so
that it is not just localized,"
Nijhawan said. "If that's not prof
itable enough, they need to find a
way to make it more effective not
just to local people to give it more
flexibility."
While Borenstein asserted that
Swapbox has the potential to
expand beyond college campuses,
Murthy said he is currently
focused on collecting results from
the 250 Stanford students who
have signed up to use the service.
"The whole point was to help
other Stanford students," he said.
"The big push is going to be to
make sure this works on Stanford
and make sure people like it, and if
that all works, we can expand to
other universities."
