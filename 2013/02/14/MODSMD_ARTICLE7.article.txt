## Sagan studies Civil War general, family history 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
It's rare that a Stanford profes
sor fully immersed in the bubble of
aeademia is able to simultaneously
pursue a scholarly research project
and map out his family tree.
Scott Sagan, professor of politi
cal science and a Senior Fellow at
the Center for International Securi
ty and Cooperation (CISAC), is one
of the lucky few.
This past summer, Sagan, who
built his career on the study of
nuclear weapons policy, temporarily
pivoted his focus towards a different

piece of history. Along with his 16-
year-old son, Samuel, Sagan
researched and produced a manu
script on the hidden history of
James Tilton "Jimmie" Pickett, the
half-Indian son of Civil War union
general George Edward Pickett
a distant relative of Sagan's.
"I thought it was an interesting
story," Sagan said. "Very often, good
academic work stems not from the
confidence that you know what the
answer is but from having a puzzle
that you don't understand, and like a
detective, you want to figure out
what happened and why."
According to Sagan, in addition
to shedding light on his family histo
ry, Pickett's story serves as a lens
that one can use to develop a deeper
understanding of the relationship
between U.S. Army officers, Indian
women and their mixed blood chil
dren in the 17th and 18th centuries.
Jimmie Pickett was one such
child, the product of a relationship
between George Edward Pickett
and an Indian woman that devel
oped while the general was sta
tioned in Washington, D.C., in the
late 1850s. At the time, many sol
diers had similar relations with
Indian women, but the specific
details of those relationships were
largely unknown.
Following Jimmie's mother's
death shortly after childbirth,
George Pickett left the young boy in
the care of a white couple that later
became Jimmie's foster parents.
When Pickett returned to Virginia
in 1861, he left some money and a
Bible for his son, but they would
never speak again.
"The Jimmie Pickett story is a
story of a young boy who was aban
doned by his father, so in this sense,
it's a sad story," Sagan said. "Yet
he's also someone who becomes

moderately successful as an artist
and is integrated into white society
in part because of the relationship
with his foster parents and his god
father, James Tilton. So, in that
sense, it's an uplifting story."
According to Sagan, although
George Pickett's biographers had
previously acknowledged Jimmie's
existence, Jimmie's relationships
with his parents, stepparents and
contemporary society were not pre
viously well known. The Sagans
used primary sources collected in
archives across the country in order
to add color to the story of a young
man who succumbed to typhoid
fever at the age of 31.
"We went up to the Washington
State Historical Society and we
looked through Jimmie Pickett's
trunk that was super interest
ing," Sam Sagan said. "We found his
old textbook, a notebook of art and a
cutout of his hair that was placed in
what we think was General Pickett's
bible."
Sagan also asked one of his
research assistants, Lauryn
Williams 'l4, to look through an
1858 diary of General August Kautz
who served alongside General
Pickett kept at the Library of
Congress to further flesh out the
details of Jimmie Pickett's heritage.
Sagan focused on the relation
ship between Jimmie Pickett and
his stepmother, LaSalle Corbell
Pickett, which developed after Gen
eral Pickett's death. The two origi

nally exchanged friendly letters, but
ended up in a bitter dispute over
Jimmie Pickett's right to inherit his
father's land in Washington, D.C.
Corbell Pickett never mentioned
Jimmie in the many books and arti
cles she wrote about her late hus
band.
Williams said that the project
showed the complexity inherent to
many professors.
"Professor Sagan has his main
focus, but the skills he has there
equate to historical research in all

types of things," Williams said. "He
found something that he is interested
in and went with it."
Although this was a unique proj
ect, it is not the first time Sagan has
integrated his connection to Pickett
into his work. He has taught a popu
lar Sophomore College class called
"The Face of Battle," which focuses
on the actual experience of combat
ants in war.
"In terms of pedagogy, it's great
because it encourages students to do
research and then defend their posi

tions," Sagan said. "And in terms of
historical understanding to see the
fog of battle the confusion and the
geography and being lost in the
woods —it makes you appreciate
things in a very different way."
For part of "The Face of Battle",
the class travels to Pennsylvania to
the battlefield of Gettysburg, where
General Pickett led the infamous
"Pickett's Charge." Students are
assigned to play different roles,
including that of the general and his
third wife.
"Last year, I added LaSalle Cor
bell Pickett so that people could
understand the role," Sagan said. "I'd
like to add Jimmie Pickett because it
adds a different dimension to this his
tory."
Although Sagan noted that his ini
tial interest in this research project
revolved mostly around his personal
connection, he said that it has also
allowed him to explore a history he
or perhaps anyone else —would like
ly not have encountered otherwise.
"This Jimmie Pickett project
started out largely as a roots trip,
but once I recognized that this was
an unexplained and underappreciat
ed part of American history, I decid
ed to dig more deeply into it," Sagan
said. "This was a mystery and there
are always still mysteries in history,
but I think we've solved some of
them."
