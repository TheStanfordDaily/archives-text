## Rebele grants mark 27th year Journalism funds provide support for upstart reporters 
### QUYEN NGUYEN 
Nearly three decades after the
Department of Communication first
hosted the Rebele Internship Pro
gram for journalism internships,
the initiative has continued to grow
in profile both on campus and on a
national level, with 30-40 students
applying to media outlets across the
country every year.
Applications for this summer's
round of funding closes April 1. The
program is open to all students who
have secured a journalism intern
ship.
Established in 1986 by Rowland
"Reb" Rebele '5l and his wife Pat,
the internship program has funded
Stanford students' full-time unpaid
internships with a newspaper of
their choice. The program offers
stipends of up to $5,000 for full-time
work over the summer and of up to
$2,200 for academic year intern
ships.
The idea for the program was
originally inspired by Rowland's
first paid journalism internship at
the Hanford Sentinel, which he
obtained when he was still a student
at Stanford. After he went on the
Harvard Business School, he and
his wife enjoyed a successful career
operating and selling newspapers.

"Now that we've made this mon
ey, it's time to give it back and help
the kids," Rebele said.
During the first few years, a
handful of students interned at
local papers and publishers such
The Palo Alto Weekly, The Menlo
Park Almanac or The Mountain
View Voice. More recently, students
have secured placements at larger
and often national publica
tions such as The New York Times
and The Miami Herald.
According to Susie Ementon, a
former program coordinator, about
30-40 students apply for a Rebele
stipend each year compared to the
few that participated when the pro
gram was first established.
Ementon attributed the grow
ing number of applicants to the
appeal of a chance to do hands-on
reporting and learn about the pro
fession, even while the internships
themselves are unpaid.
Alexei Koseff 'l2 M.A. 'l3, who
is currently enrolled at the Stan
ford Graduate Program in Journal
ism and who participated in the
Rebele program for the first time
last summer, cited the program's
funding as a major reason to apply.
"What is great about the Rebele
program is that its funding elimi
nates that barrier of entry and
allows young students who would
otherwise not be able to afford this
opportunity to put a foot in the
door," Koseff said.

Koseff worked at The Orange
County Register's bureau in Lagu
na Woods Village, a senior retire
ment community of 80,000 people.
He cited the small size of his office
which employed only two other
people as a significant factor in
improving the quality of his report
ing.
This coming summer Koseff will
again work as a Rebele intern,
working this time at The Los Ange
les Times on their news desk.
"I understand that [journalism]
is not currently the most accessible
profession," Koseff said. "The state
of the industry is in flux and also
challenged by monetization, but it is
something that I am passionate
about, so I want to give myself the
opportunity to try it out for a
while."
Katrin Wheeler, the program's
current coordinator, framed the
program's ability to pair newly
funded students and editors in need
of unpaid writers as mutually bene
ficial.
Ementon added that, regardless
of participating students' eventual
career plans, feedback on the pro
gram has been consistently positive.
Over the program's lifespan, the
number of non-journalism appli
cants has steadily grown to two
thirds of the total applicants.
