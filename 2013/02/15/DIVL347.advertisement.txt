Do "Super PACs" and corporate lobbying corrupt democratic
elections? Do Democratic and Republican economic proposals
hold up to scrutiny? Can a state prevent you from buying and
carrying a gun? How would Martin Luther King analyze
American society, public policy and racial discourse had he
lived to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his "I Have A Dream"
speech this year? This seminar investigates the relationship
between law and public policy on issues related to economic
regulation, electoral politics and finance, civil rights, sexuality
and culture. We will explore how law both facilitates and
constrains public policy reforms in historical context and our
own era of challenging budgetary pressures, intensive political
division, and increasing socio-economic inequality. Class
discussion will involve the close reading and interpretation of
judicial opinions, legislation and other legal texts,
interdisciplinary scholarship, and film.
