## Startup furthers data analysis

Ayasdi, a data analysis company
co-founded by Guijeet Singh M.S. 'O5
Ph.D. 'O7 ED. 'O9, Harlan Sexton
Ph.D. 'Bl and Professor of Mathemat
ics Gunnar Carlsson Ph.D. '76, has
pioneered a new program to help con
sumers visualize and digest complex
data such as sports statistics and
genetic maps.
Traditional techniques of analyz
ing large amounts of data require
researchers and businesses to
attempt to write code in order to
interact with data analysis programs
themselves, a job that has often been
passed off to computer scientists.
According to Jeff Yoshimura,
Ayasdi's vice president of marketing,
the company's launch transformed an
esoteric tool of academia into a "tech

nology platform to [a] scale that any
company could utilize."
Ayasdi's visualization program,
Iris, uses "push-button" functions
that take only seconds to display data
in 3D structures, compare groups of
data or analyze the statistical signifi
cance of an event. Ayasdi data scien
tist Alexis Johnson said that most
users can learn how to use Iris in less
than a day, making it more accessible
than traditional techniques of data
analysis.
"Humans are innately capable of
recognizing patterns," Yoshimura
said. "It's just a matter of expressing
the data in away that makes the pat
terns easiest to recognize.
According to Johnson, Iris allows
users to make notes and forward
their files back and forth with their
colleagues to share insights. Users

can also manipulate the 3D form of
the data to show their peers different
perspectives of the analyses.
Johnson said that Iris has already
been applied to real-world problems,
including a recent effort to process
genetic data from breast cancer
patients by separating patients into
subcategories based on gene expres
sion.
Though patients with low estro
gen receptor expression typically
have high breast cancer mortality
rates, Iris revealed a subgroup of
patients with a 100 percent survival
rate. This discovery allowed women
with a specific genetic profile to
receive targeted treatment.
"What we do is provide a com
pressed representation of the data
set, compressed in a way that retains
features and patterns so we can see
patterns in very large sets and also
flexible in that it can represent com
plexity," Carisson said.
Though Ayasdi was founded in
2008, Carisson and Sexton met in the
1970s as Ph.D. students in mathemat
ics at Stanford. Singh, who generated
many of the algorithms that Iris uses,
began working with Carisson on topo
logical data analysis while pursuing a
doctoral degree in computational
mathematics.
Ayasdi launched a new website
this January and established an office
in Palo Alto after receiving $10 million
in funding from Khosla Ventures. The
company's 30 employees are current
ly working on new product applica
tions to make Ayasdi's technology
more accessible.
Carisson said that the decision to
expand Ayasdi beyond research at
Stanford was based on the realization
that their data analysis could be
turned into a usable product. Accord
ing to Carisson, creating industrial
grade software within the university

would have been very difficult.
"If you're building very big
software packages, it's sort of
not fair to students to have
them be involved in writing a
lot of code and implementa
tion," Carlsson said. "Stu
dents and postdocs are really
here to do their own research
and develop intellectually,
which isn't the same as build
ing a bulletproof product."

Although Ayasdi has since
expanded into the private sec
tor, Carisson said that the
Stanford environment has had
a significant influence on
Ayasdi's development.
"[Stanford is] the premier
place in the world for all sorts
of interdisciplinary interac
tions," he said. "I myself have
taught at other places, I
taught at Princeton before
this, and in none of those
places is the environment
even close to comparable."
