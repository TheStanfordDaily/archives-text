## SLAC scientists confirm source of cosmic rays 
### â€“ Olivia Moore 
Researchers at the Kavli Institute for Particle
Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC), part of the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, have con
firmed that cosmic rays are created in the after
math of supernovas, a theory that had never before
been proven conclusively.
The team of researchers, led by Assistant Pro
fessor of Physics Stefan Funk, analyzed four years
of data from NASAs Fermi Gamma-ray Space Tel
escope. The researchers found that the aftermath
of two supernovas had accelerated protons through
a process called Fermi acceleration, causing these
protons to transform into cosmic rays.
Scientists had previously believed that cosmic
rays were created either by supernovas or through
energy from black holes but were unable to find
definite evidence because they could not trace the
rays back to their source.
The SLAC team approached the issue by look
ing at gamma rays, which have distinctive signa
tures and are created when cosmic rays combine
with static protons. Unlike cosmic rays, which are
deflected by magnetic fields, gamma rays travel in
straight lines, and their source can be identified.
"It's fitting that such a clear demonstration
showing supernova remnants accelerate cosmic
rays came as we celebrated the 100 th anniversary
of their discovery," Kavli Institute Director Roger
Blandford said in a press release. "It brings home
how quickly our capabilities for discovery are
advancing."
The team's findings were published in the Feb.
15 issue of Science.
