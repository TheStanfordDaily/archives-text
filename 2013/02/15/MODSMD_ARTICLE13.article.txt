## Does football need to make changes? 
### Sam Fisher 
There's a new fad in America,
catching on faster than
"Gangnam Style" or "Call
Me Maybe." No, I'm not
talking about the "Harlem
Shake." I'm talking about the argument
against football.
On Thursday in an opinions piece
for The Stanford Daily Adam Johnson
became the next person to make that
argument. And, I have to admit, he did
a pretty good job.
I think one of Adam's strongest
arguments is the change in mindset
over a big hit. "Whereas once I used to
cheer for a monstrous hit," Adam
writes, "I now cringe, even if the player
pops up and appears fine."
He's right. The big hits — specifi
cally those to the head —have to go. At
first, I wasn't sure this was possible; I
thought hits to the head would be too
difficult to avoid. I thought this would
be the downfall of football.
But then I watched Stanford junior
strong safety Jordan Richards play this
season. Week after week, Richards
delivered punishing hits to opposing
wide receivers, tight ends and running
backs. However, he never hit them in
the head, becoming an expert at the
blow to the ribs.
These plays were violent, certainly
violent enough to cause injury, but they
did not involve the head. I don't think
anyone believes you could —or even
should—get rid of all violence and
injuries in football, but most agree that
eliminating or greatly reducing head
injuries is vital to the sport's future.
I'm not a scientist, nor am I some
one who is going to make my career
playing football, so I'll refrain from
adding anything more to the argument
over the safety, or iuture, of the game.
Instead, let me tell you what playing
football meant to me.
At the end of the day football was
the one thing that truly taught me
about toughness and responsibility I
was a lineman. I played both ways
through junior varsity but stuck mostly
to defensive line when I got to varsity.
My best football lessons came from
my time on the JY offensive line. My
sophomore year, our JV quarterback
was a baby-faced five-foot-nothing, 100-
pound freshman named Matt
Damstrom.
Parents will tell you that every time
Damstrom took one of my shotgun
snaps, they winced in anticipation of
what a sack could do to the kid. He was
so small, so young, that everyone feared
one hit could do some real damage.
I didn't miss many blocks that sea
son. I didn't need any lectures on
responsibility or toughness to give
everything in my body to make sure
the nose tackle didn't beat me on a pass
play—all I had to do was picture my
friend Matt Damstrom under a pile of
defensive linemen twice his size.
Sure there were times I got beat —
there's a reason that I write about
Stanford football and don't play it —
but I would fight, hold, grab or do just
about anything in my power to make
sure my man did not get to Matt
Damstrom.
All around the field, one player
making a mistake can do a lot more
than cost the team the game—it could
cause a teammate's injury You see it all
the time: a quarterback throws a bad
pass and his receiver takes a big hit,
Reed Miller has a bad snap and Daniel
Zychlinsky misses the next game and a
half with an injury
This isn't like soccer, basketball or
baseball, where mistakes rarely do
more to a teammate than make him
look bad or hurt his stats. It's not like
wrestling or boxing either, where your
mistakes cause yourself, not your
friends, pain or injury
Something has to be done about
football. The sport cannot —and hon
estly should not — survive without
major changes to player safety Legs,
ribs, shoulders and knees all heal, but
as far as we kno\y the brain does not.
However, unless we find that there
really is no alternative, we can't give up
on football so easily The game has giv
en me so much. The responsibility of
holding a teammate's safety in my
hands and trusting my safety in his has
led to some great friendships. When I
go back home to visit, I find it's those
football friends who I look for more
than anyone else.
It's going to be tough to change the
sport. But, as the sport that needs
tough changes taught me, sometimes
you have to claw grab and fight to keep
who — or what—you care about off
the turf
It's time to strap on the helmet.

Sure there were times I got beat —
there's a reason that I write about
Stanford football and don't play it —
but I would fight, hold, grab or do just
about anything in my power to make
sure my man did not get to Matt
Damstrom.
All around the field, one player
making a mistake can do a lot more
than cost the team the game—it could
cause a teammate's injury You see it all
the time: a quarterback throws a bad
pass and his receiver takes a big hit,
Reed Miller has a bad snap and Daniel
Zychlinsky misses the next game and a
half with an injury
This isn't like soccer, basketball or
baseball, where mistakes rarely do
more to a teammate than make him
look bad or hurt his stats. It's not like
wrestling or boxing either, where your
mistakes cause yourself, not your
friends, pain or injury
Something has to be done about
football. The sport cannot —and hon
estly should not — survive without
major changes to player safety Legs,
ribs, shoulders and knees all heal, but
as far as we kno\y the brain does not.
However, unless we find that there
really is no alternative, we can't give up
on football so easily The game has giv
en me so much. The responsibility of
holding a teammate's safety in my
hands and trusting my safety in his has
led to some great friendships. When I
go back home to visit, I find it's those
football friends who I look for more
than anyone else.
It's going to be tough to change the
sport. But, as the sport that needs
tough changes taught me, sometimes
you have to claw grab and fight to keep
who — or what—you care about off
the turf
It's time to strap on the helmet.
