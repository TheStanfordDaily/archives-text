# DOWN TO THE WIRE
## FINAL SHOT DOESN'T FALL 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
It was deja vu all over again.
In a scene that was far too familiar for
Stanford fans, a last-second shot didn't
drop for Chasson Randle and the Cardi
nal (15-10, 6-6 Pac-12) was once again
upset by USC on Thursday night, 65-64,
throwing its NCAA Tournament chances
at least partially out the window.

The final sequence brought back bad
memories of the first meeting between
the two teams back in early January. On
that day, Stanford had the ball down two
points with less than 20 seconds to play
before missing two chances in the paint
to send the game to overtime.
When the Trojans (12-13, 7-5) rolled
into Maples Pavilion on Thursday night,
the Cardinal was hoping for a different
outcome. Desperately trying to stay in
the conversation for an at-large bid into
the NCAA Tournament, Stanford needed
a conference win over a USC opponent
that has been successful in Pac-12 play.
Early on, it appeared that the game
was going to be a defensive struggle. Nei
ther team managed to score for the first
two minutes, a streak that was snapped
when USC's Dewayne Dedmon made a
layup, followed almost immediately by a
basket from junior forward Josh Huestis.
The majority of the half then became a
back-and-forth struggle, as neither team
was able to pull away. Each time one side
looked like they were about to go on a
run, the opposing side pulled it together

Junior forward Josh Huestis (24) had a career-high 22 points against USC, but it wasn't enough
for the Cardinal, which lost 65-64 after Chasson Randle couldn't convert a last-second attempt.
defensively and started converting
on the offensive end.
After Huestis knocked down a
jumper with 11:43 remaining in the
period to put Stanford up 15-11,
USC interim head coach Bob Can
tu called a time out.
The Trojans came out on fire,
going on a 7-0 run capped by a
layup from sophomore guard
Byron Wesley. After Huestis
scored right at the four minute
mark to cut USC's advantage to
23-21, the Trojans took control of
the half. They went on a quick 12-2
run to close out the half, dominat
ing Stanford on both ends of the
floor. Junior guard J.T Terrell
found his shooting touch, knocking
down a pair of three pointers
one from 35 feet to beat the buzzer
to put his Trojans up 35-23
going into the break.
"Getting the lead in the first
half gave us confidence," Cantu
said. "We knew at some point the
other team is going to make a run,
so you've got to withstand that."
Stanford would not go down
without a fight, as the veteran trio
of Huestis, junior Dwight Powell
and sophomore Chasson Randle
willed the Card back into the game.
With 16:22 remaining, Randle
knocked down a three, followed by
another jumper from beyond the
arc two possessions later to bring
Stanford within single digits.
Randle struck again with 11:55
to go, hitting his third three of the
half to cut the Card's deficit to 43-
39. Immediately afterwards, how
ever, he made the mistake of foul
ing Terrell on a three-point
attempt. The guard drained each of
his three free throw attempts,
something Stanford struggled to
do all game long as the Card went
just 4-of-12 from the charity stripe.
The teams traded baskets for
the next two minutes, as the Cardi
nal just managed to keep the game
within reach. Junior guard Aaron
Bright found Randle on the
perimeter for yet another three
pointer and then set up Huestis for
a three of his own on the next pos
session.
Sensing that the game was slip
ping through their fingers, Cantu
called a timeout with 2:16 to play
and a 63-57 lead. Following the
break in play, Stanford recorded
two necessary defensive stops but
was again plagued by poor shoot
ing from the free throw line.
Powell and Bright went a com
bined 2-of-4 in the pressure cooker,
allowing the Trojans to maintain a
four-point advantage. Bright then
fouled Jio Fontan, who knocked
down both of his free throws to
give his team a comfortable six
point advantage. Powell then drew
a foul and knocked down a clutch
jumper. The junior knocked down
his free throw, cutting USC's lead
to 3.
However, only 30 seconds
remained, and the Card needed
some help. That is exactly what
they got, as Terrell turned the ball
over, leading to another bucket for

Powell. With 25 seconds left, and
an eerily similar plotline to the
January matchup, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins called a
timeout.
When play resumed, Stanford
tried to force a turnover, but was
unsuccessful. Powell quickly inten
tionally fouled Eric Wise with 18
seconds to play. The Card got
exactly what it needed, as Wise
missed both free throws.
Powell snatched the offensive
rebound and got the ball to Bright.
Once again, the Card had the ball
with a chance to win.

Dribbling at the top of the key,
Bright let the clock run down while
Randle tried to get free on the
perimeter. Forced to create on his
own with USC's defense smother
ing Randle, Bright drove to his left
but had his desperate entry pass
knocked out of bounds with 1.8 to
play.
Randle took the inbounds pass
in the corner and got a look at the
basket from behind the arc but
could not find the net.
It was certainly a difficult loss
for a Stanford team that desper
ately needs to impress the NCAA
voting committee in order to earn
an at-large bid.
"In the first half, we weren't
ready to play and they were ready
for a fight," Huestis said. "This is
an awakening. It will bring us down
to earth after playing well the last
couple games."
The path to March Madness
from here likely grows very steep,
perhaps requiring the Card
which entered the night with a
respectable RPI (No. 38) and
decent power rating (No. 57) but a
weak non-conference slate and
poor record (4-8) against top-50
teams —to secure an automatic
bid by winning the Pac-12 Tourna
ment to gain entry
But with six conference games
to play and the promise showed by
Stanford in the last several games,
it is still a possibility.
Stanford's next game is against
UCLA at Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday.

willed the Card back into the game.
With 16:22 remaining, Randle
knocked down a three, followed by
another jumper from beyond the
arc two possessions later to bring
Stanford within single digits.
Randle struck again with 11:55
to go, hitting his third three of the
half to cut the Card's deficit to 43-
39. Immediately afterwards, how
ever, he made the mistake of foul
ing Terrell on a three-point
attempt. The guard drained each of
his three free throw attempts,
something Stanford struggled to
do all game long as the Card went
just 4-of-12 from the charity stripe.
The teams traded baskets for
the next two minutes, as the Cardi
nal just managed to keep the game
within reach. Junior guard Aaron
Bright found Randle on the
perimeter for yet another three
pointer and then set up Huestis for
a three of his own on the next pos
session.
Sensing that the game was slip
ping through their fingers, Cantu
called a timeout with 2:16 to play
and a 63-57 lead. Following the
break in play, Stanford recorded
two necessary defensive stops but
was again plagued by poor shoot
ing from the free throw line.
Powell and Bright went a com
bined 2-of-4 in the pressure cooker,
allowing the Trojans to maintain a
four-point advantage. Bright then
fouled Jio Fontan, who knocked
down both of his free throws to
give his team a comfortable six
point advantage. Powell then drew
a foul and knocked down a clutch
jumper. The junior knocked down
his free throw, cutting USC's lead
to 3.
However, only 30 seconds
remained, and the Card needed
some help. That is exactly what
they got, as Terrell turned the ball
over, leading to another bucket for

Powell. With 25 seconds left, and
an eerily similar plotline to the
January matchup, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawkins called a
timeout.
When play resumed, Stanford
tried to force a turnover, but was
unsuccessful. Powell quickly inten
tionally fouled Eric Wise with 18
seconds to play. The Card got
exactly what it needed, as Wise
missed both free throws.
Powell snatched the offensive
rebound and got the ball to Bright.
Once again, the Card had the ball
with a chance to win.

Dribbling at the top of the key,
Bright let the clock run down while
Randle tried to get free on the
perimeter. Forced to create on his
own with USC's defense smother
ing Randle, Bright drove to his left
but had his desperate entry pass
knocked out of bounds with 1.8 to
play.
Randle took the inbounds pass
in the corner and got a look at the
basket from behind the arc but
could not find the net.
It was certainly a difficult loss
for a Stanford team that desper
ately needs to impress the NCAA
voting committee in order to earn
an at-large bid.
"In the first half, we weren't
ready to play and they were ready
for a fight," Huestis said. "This is
an awakening. It will bring us down
to earth after playing well the last
couple games."
The path to March Madness
from here likely grows very steep,
perhaps requiring the Card
which entered the night with a
respectable RPI (No. 38) and
decent power rating (No. 57) but a
weak non-conference slate and
poor record (4-8) against top-50
teams —to secure an automatic
bid by winning the Pac-12 Tourna
ment to gain entry
But with six conference games
to play and the promise showed by
Stanford in the last several games,
it is still a possibility.
Stanford's next game is against
UCLA at Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday.

It was deja vu all over again.
In a scene that was far too familiar for
Stanford fans, a last-second shot didn't
drop for Chasson Randle and the Cardi
nal (15-10, 6-6 Pac-12) was once again
upset by USC on Thursday night, 65-64,
throwing its NCAA Tournament chances
at least partially out the window.

The final sequence brought back bad
memories of the first meeting between
the two teams back in early January. On
that day, Stanford had the ball down two
points with less than 20 seconds to play
before missing two chances in the paint
to send the game to overtime.
When the Trojans (12-13, 7-5) rolled
into Maples Pavilion on Thursday night,
the Cardinal was hoping for a different
outcome. Desperately trying to stay in
the conversation for an at-large bid into
the NCAA Tournament, Stanford needed
a conference win over a USC opponent
that has been successful in Pac-12 play.
Early on, it appeared that the game
was going to be a defensive struggle. Nei
ther team managed to score for the first
two minutes, a streak that was snapped
when USC's Dewayne Dedmon made a
layup, followed almost immediately by a
basket from junior forward Josh Huestis.
The majority of the half then became a
back-and-forth struggle, as neither team
was able to pull away. Each time one side
looked like they were about to go on a
run, the opposing side pulled it together

on the offensive end.
After Huestis knocked down a
jumper with 11:43 remaining in the
period to put Stanford up 15-11,
USC interim head coach Bob Can
tu called a time out.
The Trojans came out on fire,
going on a 7-0 run capped by a
layup from sophomore guard
Byron Wesley. After Huestis
scored right at the four minute
mark to cut USC's advantage to
23-21, the Trojans took control of
the half. They went on a quick 12-2
run to close out the half, dominat
ing Stanford on both ends of the
floor. Junior guard J.T Terrell
found his shooting touch, knocking
down a pair of three pointers
one from 35 feet to beat the buzzer
to put his Trojans up 35-23
going into the break.
"Getting the lead in the first
half gave us confidence," Cantu
said. "We knew at some point the
other team is going to make a run,
so you've got to withstand that."
Stanford would not go down
without a fight, as the veteran trio
of Huestis, junior Dwight Powell
