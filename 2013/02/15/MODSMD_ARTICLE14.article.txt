# DOWN TO THE WIRE
## FINAL SHOT DOESN'T FALL 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
It was deja vu all over again.
In a scene that was far too familiar for
Stanford fans, a last-second shot didn't
drop for Chasson Randle and the Cardi
nal (15-10, 6-6 Pac-12) was once again
upset by USC on Thursday night, 65-64,
throwing its NCAA Tournament chances
at least partially out the window.

The final sequence brought back bad
memories of the first meeting between
the two teams back in early January. On
that day, Stanford had the ball down two
points with less than 20 seconds to play
before missing two chances in the paint
to send the game to overtime.
When the Trojans (12-13, 7-5) rolled
into Maples Pavilion on Thursday night,
the Cardinal was hoping for a different
outcome. Desperately trying to stay in
the conversation for an at-large bid into
the NCAA Tournament, Stanford needed
a conference win over a USC opponent
that has been successful in Pac-12 play.
Early on, it appeared that the game
was going to be a defensive struggle. Nei
ther team managed to score for the first
two minutes, a streak that was snapped
when USC's Dewayne Dedmon made a
layup, followed almost immediately by a
basket from junior forward Josh Huestis.
The majority of the half then became a
back-and-forth struggle, as neither team
was able to pull away. Each time one side
looked like they were about to go on a
run, the opposing side pulled it together

Junior forward Josh Huestis (24) had a career-high 22 points against USC, but it wasn't enough
for the Cardinal, which lost 65-64 after Chasson Randle couldn't convert a last-second attempt.
