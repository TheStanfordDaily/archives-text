## Critical LA trip for Card 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team faces USC on the road
tonight to start a crucial away trip
to Los Angeles. After playing the
Trojans, the team will then square
off against UCLA on Sunday.
When the Trojans (8-15,5-7 Pac
-12) visited campus on Jan. 20, they
were tied for the top spot in the Pac
-12 Conference with rival UCLA,
but they have since slipped to sev
enth after losing seven out of their
last eight games. The No. 15 Bruins
(19-4, 10-2), however, have contin
ued their strong season, so far only
losing in conference play to the two
Northern Californian schools.
The No. 4 Cardinal (22-2, 11-1)
and No. 6 Cal (21-2, 10-1) have
shared the top of the Pac-12 table
since the LA schools visited the Bay
Area and may well have to share
the title unless someone can stop
either team. UCLA, third in the
Pac-12, could see this weekend as
the perfect chance to do just that. If
USC loses both games and UCLA
wins, it would create a three-way tie
for the top.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer is aware of the significance
of Sunday's game but is wary of
focusing on the Bruins just yet.
"USC gave us one of our tough
est games they came back
against us, they're athletic." Van-
Derveer said. "We have to really
prepare for everybody; we're not
looking ahead."
Stanford junior guard Toni
Kokenis is struggling with illness

and is doubtful for this weekend, so
junior guard Sara James and red
shirt junior forward Mikaela Ruef
are expected to keep their starting
places alongside senior forward
Joslyn Tinkle, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike and sophomore
guard Amber Orrange.
Ogwumike has solidified her
place as one of the nation's best col
lege players this season. In 24
games she has recorded 19 double
doubles and has scored in double
figures in every game. For compar
ison, her sister Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike'l2, the No. 1 pick in last year's
WNBA Draft, hit double figures in
35 out of 36 games in her final sea
son on the Farm.
However, VanDerveer has been
pushing all season for Ogwumike's
teammates to share some of the
burden, and her persistence seems
to be working. Last Sunday, sopho
more forward Bonnie Samuelson
scored a career-high 19 points, and,
over the weekend, both Tinkle and
Ruef grabbed double-doubles,
marking Tinkle's first of the season
