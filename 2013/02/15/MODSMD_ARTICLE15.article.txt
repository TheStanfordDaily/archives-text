## Critical LA trip for Card 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team faces USC on the road
tonight to start a crucial away trip
to Los Angeles. After playing the
Trojans, the team will then square
off against UCLA on Sunday.
When the Trojans (8-15,5-7 Pac
-12) visited campus on Jan. 20, they
were tied for the top spot in the Pac
-12 Conference with rival UCLA,
but they have since slipped to sev
enth after losing seven out of their
last eight games. The No. 15 Bruins
(19-4, 10-2), however, have contin
ued their strong season, so far only
losing in conference play to the two
Northern Californian schools.
The No. 4 Cardinal (22-2, 11-1)
and No. 6 Cal (21-2, 10-1) have
shared the top of the Pac-12 table
since the LA schools visited the Bay
Area and may well have to share
the title unless someone can stop
either team. UCLA, third in the
Pac-12, could see this weekend as
the perfect chance to do just that. If
USC loses both games and UCLA
wins, it would create a three-way tie
for the top.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer is aware of the significance
of Sunday's game but is wary of
focusing on the Bruins just yet.
"USC gave us one of our tough
est games they came back
against us, they're athletic." Van-
Derveer said. "We have to really
prepare for everybody; we're not
looking ahead."
Stanford junior guard Toni
Kokenis is struggling with illness

and is doubtful for this weekend, so
junior guard Sara James and red
shirt junior forward Mikaela Ruef
are expected to keep their starting
places alongside senior forward
Joslyn Tinkle, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike and sophomore
guard Amber Orrange.
Ogwumike has solidified her
place as one of the nation's best col
lege players this season. In 24
games she has recorded 19 double
doubles and has scored in double
figures in every game. For compar
ison, her sister Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike'l2, the No. 1 pick in last year's
WNBA Draft, hit double figures in
35 out of 36 games in her final sea
son on the Farm.
However, VanDerveer has been
pushing all season for Ogwumike's
teammates to share some of the
burden, and her persistence seems
to be working. Last Sunday, sopho
more forward Bonnie Samuelson
scored a career-high 19 points, and,
over the weekend, both Tinkle and
Ruef grabbed double-doubles,
marking Tinkle's first of the season

GAME NOTES: Stanford will try to maintain
its hold on first place in the Pac-12
when it travels to Los Angeles for two
rivalry matchups against USC and
UCLA. The Bruins currently stand third
in the conference and will be looking to
move up in the standings. Stanford
defeated both teams earlier this season.

and Ruef's first in her collegiate
career.
"I just feel like we're scraping
and scrapping every game, figur
ing out a plan," VanDerveer said,
"Against USC, we have to contain
their very quick athletic guards
and an all-conference player with
[junior forward Cassie] Har
berts."
Harberts leads USC with 17.9
points and 7.9 rebounds per game,
ranking third and seventh on those
statistics in the Pac-12. Ogwumike

leads the conference in both. Soph
omore guard Ariya Crook is the
only other Trojans player with a
double-figure scoring average.
UCLA, on the other hand, has a
variety of players who can threaten
Stanford. The Bruins count on a
trio with almost identical scoring
and rebounding averages: senior
forward Alyssia Brewer (11.6 ppg
and 8.0 rpg), redshirt junior for
ward Atonye Nyingifa (11.3 and
7.4) and senior guard/forward
Markel Walker (11.1 and 7.7). Jun
ior guard Thea Lemberger is also
just shy of double figures in points,
with 9.4 ppg.
"[UCLA] is playing a big lineup
they're not starting their small
point guard anymore," VanDerveer

said, noting that several Bruins
have done well in their return from
injuries.
The contest tonight between
Stanford and USC will tip off at 8
p.m. PT from the Galen Center in
Los Angeles, and the game on Sun
day against UCLA is scheduled for
12:30 p.m. PT in Pauley Pavilion.
Both will be broadcast live on Pac
-12 Networks and on KZSU.
"This trip separates the girls
from the women," VanDerveer
said. "UCLA has been more consis
tent, but USC is very dangerous.
We're just going to have to play
well on both nights."

ward Atonye Nyingifa (11.3 and
7.4) and senior guard/forward
Markel Walker (11.1 and 7.7). Jun
ior guard Thea Lemberger is also
just shy of double figures in points,
with 9.4 ppg.
"[UCLA] is playing a big lineup
they're not starting their small
point guard anymore," VanDerveer

said, noting that several Bruins
have done well in their return from
injuries.
The contest tonight between
Stanford and USC will tip off at 8
p.m. PT from the Galen Center in
Los Angeles, and the game on Sun
day against UCLA is scheduled for
12:30 p.m. PT in Pauley Pavilion.
Both will be broadcast live on Pac
-12 Networks and on KZSU.
"This trip separates the girls
from the women," VanDerveer
said. "UCLA has been more consis
tent, but USC is very dangerous.
We're just going to have to play
well on both nights."

The Stanford women's basket
ball team faces USC on the road
tonight to start a crucial away trip
to Los Angeles. After playing the
Trojans, the team will then square
off against UCLA on Sunday.
When the Trojans (8-15,5-7 Pac
-12) visited campus on Jan. 20, they
were tied for the top spot in the Pac
-12 Conference with rival UCLA,
but they have since slipped to sev
enth after losing seven out of their
last eight games. The No. 15 Bruins
(19-4, 10-2), however, have contin
ued their strong season, so far only
losing in conference play to the two
Northern Californian schools.
The No. 4 Cardinal (22-2, 11-1)
and No. 6 Cal (21-2, 10-1) have
shared the top of the Pac-12 table
since the LA schools visited the Bay
Area and may well have to share
the title unless someone can stop
either team. UCLA, third in the
Pac-12, could see this weekend as
the perfect chance to do just that. If
USC loses both games and UCLA
wins, it would create a three-way tie
for the top.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer is aware of the significance
of Sunday's game but is wary of
focusing on the Bruins just yet.
"USC gave us one of our tough
est games they came back
against us, they're athletic." Van-
Derveer said. "We have to really
prepare for everybody; we're not
looking ahead."
Stanford junior guard Toni
Kokenis is struggling with illness

and is doubtful for this weekend, so
junior guard Sara James and red
shirt junior forward Mikaela Ruef
are expected to keep their starting
places alongside senior forward
Joslyn Tinkle, junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike and sophomore
guard Amber Orrange.
Ogwumike has solidified her
place as one of the nation's best col
lege players this season. In 24
games she has recorded 19 double
doubles and has scored in double
figures in every game. For compar
ison, her sister Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike'l2, the No. 1 pick in last year's
WNBA Draft, hit double figures in
35 out of 36 games in her final sea
son on the Farm.
However, VanDerveer has been
pushing all season for Ogwumike's
teammates to share some of the
burden, and her persistence seems
to be working. Last Sunday, sopho
more forward Bonnie Samuelson
scored a career-high 19 points, and,
over the weekend, both Tinkle and
Ruef grabbed double-doubles,
marking Tinkle's first of the season

GAME NOTES: Stanford will try to maintain
its hold on first place in the Pac-12
when it travels to Los Angeles for two
rivalry matchups against USC and
UCLA. The Bruins currently stand third
in the conference and will be looking to
move up in the standings. Stanford
defeated both teams earlier this season.

and Ruef's first in her collegiate
career.
"I just feel like we're scraping
and scrapping every game, figur
ing out a plan," VanDerveer said,
"Against USC, we have to contain
their very quick athletic guards
and an all-conference player with
[junior forward Cassie] Har
berts."
Harberts leads USC with 17.9
points and 7.9 rebounds per game,
ranking third and seventh on those
statistics in the Pac-12. Ogwumike

leads the conference in both. Soph
omore guard Ariya Crook is the
only other Trojans player with a
double-figure scoring average.
UCLA, on the other hand, has a
variety of players who can threaten
Stanford. The Bruins count on a
trio with almost identical scoring
and rebounding averages: senior
forward Alyssia Brewer (11.6 ppg
and 8.0 rpg), redshirt junior for
ward Atonye Nyingifa (11.3 and
7.4) and senior guard/forward
Markel Walker (11.1 and 7.7). Jun
ior guard Thea Lemberger is also
just shy of double figures in points,
with 9.4 ppg.
"[UCLA] is playing a big lineup
