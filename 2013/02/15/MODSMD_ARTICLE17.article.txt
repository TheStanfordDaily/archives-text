# Men's volleyball faces tough road
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Cardinal men's
volleyball team will look to
improve its 1-3 road record
when it travels south this week
end to face No. 8 Cal State-
Northridge (6-4, 4-4 MPSF) on
Feb. 15 and then to No. 4 Long
Beach State (9-4, 7-3 MPSF) for
a match on Feb. 16. The Cardi
nal (8-4, 5-4 MPSF), hoping to
build momentum going into the
second half of the season, is just

two weeks away from a meeting
with No. 1 BYU.
The young and still improv
ing Stanford team will face two
tough and steady teams that are
both pursuing three wins in a
row. The Cardinal has played
well at home but struggled on
the road this season.
Stanford is coming off its
first home loss of the season
on Feb. 8, the Cardinal fought
hard but ultimately couldn't

prevent UC-Irvine, the former
No. 1 team, from prevailing in
four sets.
Stanford rallied back the next
day, beating unranked UC-San
Diego in three sets and sending a
message that Stanford would not
give up easily.
Junior hitters Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin showed tremendous
leadership and perservance in the
Cardinal's loss to the Anteaters.
Irvin led the offense with 21 kills,
and Cook hit a .421 with eight digs
and 18 kills. They combined for 14
kills in one set, helping the Cardi
nal win that set. Stanford will be
looking for yet another dominant
performance out of these two
players this weekend against the
Matadors and 49ers, as the rest of
the Cardinal's young offense com
bined for a total of just seven kills
against Irvine.
Stanford must also focus on
ending games well. The Cardinal
allowed UCSD to save two match
points at the end of Sunday's
match, thus ending the final set
25-23 instead of 25-21. Stanford's
opponents this weekend will likely
be even tougher to hold off than
UCSD and will capitalize off any
mistakes or openings the Cardinal
provides.
Stanford changed setters over
the weekend, with freshman set
ter Joe Ctvrtlik earning the start
ing spot during Saturday's game
against UCSD. Even as a fresh
man in his first collegiate start,
Ctvrtlik helped to balance the
struggling offense.
"Joe gave us a solid balanced
offense, and I think he sets the
quicks really well," Stanford head
coach John Kosty told GoStan
ford.com. "I felt we need to
change things up a little bit
[against UCSD], and I'm pleased
with the performance that we got

from Joe."
Against UCSD, Kosty was
happy with the improved per
formance of the offense the
middles hit a .389.
"Our passing needs to be more
consistent," Kosty said. "We need
to take the opportunities when
they're given to us and not force
it, and I think we did a good job of
taking the opportunities and not
trying to force balls in there."
The Northridge Matadors are
currently ranked at a season-high
No. 8 nationally after two momen
tum-building wins against then-
No. 8 USC and No. 5 Pepperdine.
While the Cardinal have won the
last five and six of the last 10
meetings between the two teams,
the Matadors are at peak
strength right now and will be dif
ficult to defeat on the road. The
Cardinal and Matadors both only
have one home loss to the same
team, Irvine.
Long Beach State also only
has one loss at home this season
after losing to Pepperdine last
weekend. They are coming off a
weekend similar to Stanford. The
49ers lost their first home match
of the weekend but pulled
through in a win the next day
against USC. The 49ers have had
a very strong offense lately, so
Stanford's offense will need to
prevent the 49ers from dominat
ing at the net. Long Beach junior
Taylor Crabb will be a force to
watch out for after recording four
blocks, six digs and 20 kills
against USC.
The Cardinal face two strong
opponents on the road, giving the
inconsistent but talented team the
opportunity to find the solution to
its road dilemma and carry
momentum into the second half of
the season.
"In the MPSF, we've got to get
our road wins," Kosty said. "Long
Beach is on a roll, and Northridge
is tough. It's a test."

Matadors and 49ers, as the rest of
the Cardinal's young offense com
bined for a total of just seven kills
against Irvine.
Stanford must also focus on
ending games well. The Cardinal
allowed UCSD to save two match
points at the end of Sunday's
match, thus ending the final set
25-23 instead of 25-21. Stanford's
opponents this weekend will likely
be even tougher to hold off than
UCSD and will capitalize off any
mistakes or openings the Cardinal
provides.
Stanford changed setters over
the weekend, with freshman set
ter Joe Ctvrtlik earning the start
ing spot during Saturday's game
against UCSD. Even as a fresh
man in his first collegiate start,
Ctvrtlik helped to balance the
struggling offense.
"Joe gave us a solid balanced
offense, and I think he sets the
quicks really well," Stanford head
coach John Kosty told GoStan
ford.com. "I felt we need to
change things up a little bit
[against UCSD], and I'm pleased
with the performance that we got

from Joe."
Against UCSD, Kosty was
happy with the improved per
formance of the offense the
middles hit a .389.
"Our passing needs to be more
consistent," Kosty said. "We need
to take the opportunities when
they're given to us and not force
it, and I think we did a good job of
taking the opportunities and not
trying to force balls in there."
The Northridge Matadors are
currently ranked at a season-high
No. 8 nationally after two momen
tum-building wins against then-
No. 8 USC and No. 5 Pepperdine.
While the Cardinal have won the
last five and six of the last 10
meetings between the two teams,
the Matadors are at peak
strength right now and will be dif
ficult to defeat on the road. The
Cardinal and Matadors both only
have one home loss to the same
team, Irvine.
Long Beach State also only
has one loss at home this season
after losing to Pepperdine last
weekend. They are coming off a
weekend similar to Stanford. The
49ers lost their first home match
of the weekend but pulled
through in a win the next day
against USC. The 49ers have had
a very strong offense lately, so
Stanford's offense will need to
prevent the 49ers from dominat
ing at the net. Long Beach junior
Taylor Crabb will be a force to
watch out for after recording four
blocks, six digs and 20 kills
against USC.
The Cardinal face two strong
opponents on the road, giving the
inconsistent but talented team the
opportunity to find the solution to
its road dilemma and carry
momentum into the second half of
the season.
"In the MPSF, we've got to get
our road wins," Kosty said. "Long
Beach is on a roll, and Northridge
is tough. It's a test."
