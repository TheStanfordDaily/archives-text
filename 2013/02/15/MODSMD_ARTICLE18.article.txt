## SEEING GREEN The
						Spring Boileth Over 
### Holly Moeller 
When I was a little girl,
before I loved football, my
mom used to take me shop
ping on Sunday afternoons "so we
could be out of the house while
Daddy screamed at the TV"
We were a thrifty pair, debating
the utility of each purchase, calcu
lating unit prices and comparison
shopping at every opportunity. But
Mom made one exception to our
financial bottom line: She avoided
"Made in China" like the plague.
(At the time, the Chinese manufac
turing machine was just swinging
into gear, so it was actually possible
to find American-made alterna
tives.)
Like every other American con
sumer, we looked to product labels
to guide our purchases, implicitly
trusting the regulatory system to
ensure the labels' accuracy. But
what happens when that regulatory
system is absent or fundamentally
flawed?
This week, National Public
Radio ran a three-part investiga
tive report on the Marine Steward
ship Council (MSC), whose blue,
checkmark-fish logo brands
seafood as sustainable. The MSC
has been active since the late 19905,
during which time it has certified
the sustainability of over 100 fish
eries around the world, rating them
according to their fish stock's
health, environmental stewardship
of their regional seas and ability to
respond to changing conditions.
The MSC's seal of approval adorns
thousands of products sold in
dozens of countries, assuring envi
ronmentally conscious consumers
that the fish they purchase is safe
for the planet as well as the palate.
But, the NPR journalists
reported, the ecolabel might not be
as reliable as the MSC wants us to
believe. Critics point out that some
surprising fisheries like Antarc
tic krill and British Columbia
salmon have gotten the thumbs
up from the MSC despite substan
tial scientific uncertainty. It seems
that the MSC is erring on the side
of optimism, offering the fisheries a
labeling carrot in exchange for
promises of good behavior.
While this approach is hardly
ideal and, many would argue,
gives a misleading "feel good" high
to consumers it's symptomatic
of a fundamental problem in fish
eries management: The answers to
today's questions rely on tomor
row's data. Although, particularly
in our oldest fisheries, we are some
times lucky enough to have enough
historical information to guess at
future trends, much of fisheries
management remains a mystery.
Under pressure to provide a useful
metric right now, the MSC has
cut some arguably unavoidable cor
ners, potentially at the cost of its
label's trustworthiness.
It's hardly alone.
Motivated by and in turn,
motivating growing consumer
interest in "green" products,
armies of ecolabeling schemes are
battling for their corner of product
packaging real estate. As of this
year, the Ecolabel Index (itself of
dubious authority) was tracking
435 branding schemes active in 197
countries. Some generally by
arriving early to the game have
more name recognition than oth
ers. For example, you'd probably
recognize the Rainforest Alliance's
green frog or the blue and green
swirls denoting Fair Trade. Each

label also has its own distinct mean
ing, some emphasizing environ
mental protection, some focused on
social justice and some measuring
sustainability. Labels also vary
widely in their reliability, from the
good-faith efforts at quantifying a
product's environmental impact to
thinly veiled greenwashing intend
ed to move product quickly off
store shelves.
Unfortunately, without a univer
sal set of standards for measuring
sustainability, it's almost impossible
for the average consumer to make
sense of the myriad branding
schemes. Some governmental bod
iesâ€” like the United States and
the European Union have tried,
and sometimes succeeded, to put
forward their own certification
schemes, but these are hardly uni
versal in coverage or usage.
Meanwhile, overwhelmed by
claims of "greenness," "sustainabil
ity" and "carbon neutrality," con
sumers are losing faith and inter
est. This phenomenon, which indus
try experts call "consumer fatigue,"
could spell disaster or at least a
major setback for the environ
mental movement. We need unam
biguous, consistent and universal
ecolabels, and we need them now.
But that is a sun dream as elu
sive as the MSC's quest for com
plete fishery datasets. And so, in
the absence of a higher authority,
the burden falls again to the con
sumer: to my mother and I, buying
American-made; to the parent
seeking pesticide-free produce; to
the young executive dreaming of
saving the world.
Our individual choices how
much more we're willing to spend
for organic, fair-trade coffee; how
much time we're willing to spend
disentangling the environmental
impact of each product shape
the economic system and the future
of ecolabeling. We can start by
looking local, where it's easier to
trace a product's history and the
lure of the label fades into the dis
tance.

Its almost
impossible for the
average consumer
to make sense
of the myriad
branding
schemes.
