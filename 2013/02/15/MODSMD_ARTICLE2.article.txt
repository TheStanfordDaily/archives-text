Although many college football pro
grams have recently incurred heavy
financial losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics depart
ment has seen both an increase in sea
son-ticket renewals and national profile
in the aftermath of the 2013 Rose Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that previous
season-ticket holders could request
seats for the 2013 season, 1,048 seats
were renewed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an increase of 35
percent and 572 in 2011. As of Feb.

participation. The Virginia Tech report
edly lost $1.6 million in the 2011 Orange
Bowl and $2.2 million on the 2009
Orange Bowl, the University of Con
necticut reportedly lost close to $l.B mil
lion for playing in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl

While other football programs have historically lost money in bowl appearances, the Stanford athletics department met its goal of breaking
even for the 2013 Rose Bowl. Stanford's third-straight BCS apperance has also led to an almost immediate spike in season ticket renewals.
