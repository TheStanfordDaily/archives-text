# Rose Bowl win still reverberates on Farm
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Although many college football pro
grams have recently incurred heavy
financial losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics depart
ment has seen both an increase in sea
son-ticket renewals and national profile
in the aftermath of the 2013 Rose Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that previous
season-ticket holders could request
seats for the 2013 season, 1,048 seats
were renewed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an increase of 35
percent and 572 in 2011. As of Feb.
14, 2,586 of 25,500 season tickets had
been renewed with almost two months
remaining before the April 8 deadline.
In recent seasons, football programs
across the country have reported mil
lions of dollars in losses based on bowl
participation. The Virginia Tech report
edly lost $1.6 million in the 2011 Orange
Bowl and $2.2 million on the 2009
Orange Bowl, the University of Con
necticut reportedly lost close to $l.B mil
lion for playing in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl
and even Alabama, the 2010 national
champions, reported a $l.B million loss

While other football programs have historically lost money in bowl appearances, the Stanford athletics department met its goal of breaking
even for the 2013 Rose Bowl. Stanford's third-straight BCS apperance has also led to an almost immediate spike in season ticket renewals.
after the 2010 title game.
As a private institution,
Stanford is not required to
release its full financial infor
mation, but Stanford adminis
trators said that the athletic
department met its goal of
breaking even on its trip to
the 2013 Rose Bowl and is
currently reaping the benefits
of the increased exposure.
"The bowl game is not a
money-making enterprise for
the schools participating,"
said Mike Eubanks '97 M.A.
'Ol, assistant athletic director
and director of football
administration. "If you are
the CFO of Stanford athlet
ics, the goal is to be able to
meet all of the program's and
the university's needs at the
bowl game, have the best pos

sible experience and to do
that while balancing the
budget."
The Pac-12 conference
provides the league's Rose
Bowl representative with a
fixed budget of $1.5 million to
cover the costs of transport
ing, housing and feeding the
university's contingent of
players, coaches, cheerlead
ers, band members, adminis
trators and staff.
"Everything we wanted to
do every car that has to be
driven between functions
down there, every bus trip
that the team has to make,
every meal that we eat, every
decoration that is provided
all of those things cost real
dollars," Eubanks said.
According to the athletic
department, Stanford man
aged their expenses effective
ly, covering all operating costs
within the budget provided by
the Rose Bowl.
"One way we save money

is that we try to operate as
efficiently as possible from a
staffing perspective," said
Kevin Blue 'O5, the associate
athletic director for business
strategy. "Other institutions
make different decisions
about how many staff they
feel are needed to work to
support the operation."
In 2009, Stanford made its
first bowl appearance in eight
years at the Sun Bowl. The
Cardinal has qualified for a
BCS bowl in each of the three
seasons since, which Eubanks
said taught the department a
lot about how to run an effi
cient bowl operation.
"What we learned from
our planning and our budget
ing process helped us go in
and really avoid the surpris
es," Eubanks said. "We
understood what was going to
pop up and did a great job of
trying to keep everything at a
zero balanced budget."
Stanford also avoided sig

nifieant losses due to high
demand for tickets. Bowl par
ticipants are contractually
obligated to purchase a block
of tickets and try to sell them
to their fans. Many schools
report that the majority of
their losses come from absorb
ing the costs of unsold tickets.
For the 2013 Rose Bowl,
Stanford fans bought all of the
30,193 tickets allocated to
Stanford in less than 24
hours. The athletic depart
ment ultimately acquired and
sold approximately 8,000
more tickets. However, Stan
ford did not earn supplemen
tal revenue from selling addi
tional tickets, since all ticket
income goes back to the bowl
organizers.
"The revenue from those
tickets went to the Rose
Bowl," Eubanks said. "We
were selling the Rose Bowl's
tickets and providing an addi
tional service to our fans, our
alumni and our students by
being able to meet their
demand and so that they
would be able to sit in Stan
ford's section."
According to Roger Noll, a
professor emeritus of eco
nomics who has done
research on the economics of
intercollegiate athletics, there
is very little direct financial
incentive for schools to partic

ipate in bowl games, with
most benefits emerging only
over time.
"Schools expect that it will
increase ticket sales for the
next year and that it will
increase their ability to
recruit," Noll said. "The hope
is that the publicity associated
with it will be helpful."
University officials said
that, while the monetary
impact can be hard to quanti
fy, winning the Rose Bowl
certainly created excitement
among the fan base and likely
prompted a more active
donor base.
"There's no question that
the financial support [from
alumni and donors] that the
athletic department and the
university receives is stirred
up by Stanford playing in and
winning the Rose Bowl
game," Eubanks said. "People
are excited and want to
reward a job that is well done,
and there can be no job that is
done better than winning a
Rose Bowl."
Noll said that for schools
that have built then- reputa
tion on strong academics, the
benefits of increased expo
sure are likely less than they
would otherwise be.
"Stanford is not exactly
your standard football facto
ry," Noll said. "For schools
like Stanford, Northwestern
and Duke, which have high
quality undergraduates and
many times as many appli
cants as they have students,
there's not a whole lot of addi
tional publicity value because
that's not the main reason to
go there."
According to Jon Denney
'B5, senior associate vice pres
ident for development, it is
difficult to link increased giv
ing to any specific event. He

noted, however, that the suc
cess of the football program
can help alumni feel more
connected and engaged with
the university.
The athletic department
also expressed optimism that
the Rose Bowl win will lead to
increased interest in the foot
ball team next season. Last
season, Stanford's average
attendance for home games
was 43,343 people worse
than that of all Pac-12 teams
except Washington State.
Besides increased interest
in season ticket renewals, the
athletic department reported
high interest in new season
ticket sales as well.
According to Blue, the uni
versity had received deposits
for 1,256 new season ticket
accounts as of Feb. 14. The
athletic department reports
that on average, each account
purchases 2.7 seats, which
means that Stanford has
already seen interest in close
to 3,200 new season-ticket
holders with seven months to
go before the season starts.
"Those signs, although
very, very early and nascent,
are pointing in a very positive
direction for what 2013 ticket
sales and attendance will be,"
Eubanks said. "That will have
a significant financial impact
on us."
"Winning the Pac-12
championship and playing the
Rose Bowl and winning the
Rose Bowl game has a direct
impact on fan interest,"
Eubanks said. "There is no
doubt that the excitement and
level of interest leading into
the 2013 season is heightened
as a result of playing in and
winning the Rose Bowl."

According to Jon Denney
'B5, senior associate vice pres

difficult to link increased giv
ing to any specific event. He

noted, however, that the suc
cess of the football program
can help alumni feel more
connected and engaged with
the university.
The athletic department
also expressed optimism that
the Rose Bowl win will lead to
increased interest in the foot
ball team next season. Last
season, Stanford's average
attendance for home games
was 43,343 people worse
than that of all Pac-12 teams
except Washington State.
Besides increased interest
in season ticket renewals, the
athletic department reported
high interest in new season
ticket sales as well.
According to Blue, the uni
versity had received deposits
for 1,256 new season ticket
accounts as of Feb. 14. The
athletic department reports
that on average, each account
purchases 2.7 seats, which
means that Stanford has
already seen interest in close
to 3,200 new season-ticket
holders with seven months to
go before the season starts.
"Those signs, although
very, very early and nascent,
are pointing in a very positive
direction for what 2013 ticket
sales and attendance will be,"
Eubanks said. "That will have
a significant financial impact
on us."
"Winning the Pac-12
championship and playing the
Rose Bowl and winning the
Rose Bowl game has a direct
impact on fan interest,"
Eubanks said. "There is no
doubt that the excitement and
level of interest leading into
the 2013 season is heightened
as a result of playing in and
winning the Rose Bowl."

Although many college football pro
grams have recently incurred heavy
financial losses due to bowl game partic
ipation, the Stanford athletics depart
ment has seen both an increase in sea
son-ticket renewals and national profile
in the aftermath of the 2013 Rose Bowl.
On Feb. 8, the first day that previous
season-ticket holders could request
seats for the 2013 season, 1,048 seats
were renewed, compared to 776 on the
same day a year ago an increase of 35
percent and 572 in 2011. As of Feb.
14, 2,586 of 25,500 season tickets had
been renewed with almost two months
remaining before the April 8 deadline.
In recent seasons, football programs
across the country have reported mil
lions of dollars in losses based on bowl
participation. The Virginia Tech report
edly lost $1.6 million in the 2011 Orange
Bowl and $2.2 million on the 2009
Orange Bowl, the University of Con
necticut reportedly lost close to $l.B mil
lion for playing in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl
and even Alabama, the 2010 national
champions, reported a $l.B million loss

While other football programs have historically lost money in bowl appearances, the Stanford athletics department met its goal of breaking
even for the 2013 Rose Bowl. Stanford's third-straight BCS apperance has also led to an almost immediate spike in season ticket renewals.
after the 2010 title game.
As a private institution,
Stanford is not required to
release its full financial infor
mation, but Stanford adminis
trators said that the athletic
department met its goal of
breaking even on its trip to
the 2013 Rose Bowl and is
currently reaping the benefits
of the increased exposure.
"The bowl game is not a
money-making enterprise for
the schools participating,"
said Mike Eubanks '97 M.A.
'Ol, assistant athletic director
and director of football
administration. "If you are
the CFO of Stanford athlet
ics, the goal is to be able to
meet all of the program's and
the university's needs at the
bowl game, have the best pos

sible experience and to do
that while balancing the
budget."
The Pac-12 conference
provides the league's Rose
Bowl representative with a
fixed budget of $1.5 million to
cover the costs of transport
ing, housing and feeding the
university's contingent of
players, coaches, cheerlead
ers, band members, adminis
trators and staff.
"Everything we wanted to
do every car that has to be
driven between functions
down there, every bus trip
that the team has to make,
every meal that we eat, every
decoration that is provided
all of those things cost real
dollars," Eubanks said.
According to the athletic
department, Stanford man
aged their expenses effective
ly, covering all operating costs
within the budget provided by
the Rose Bowl.
"One way we save money

is that we try to operate as
efficiently as possible from a
staffing perspective," said
Kevin Blue 'O5, the associate
athletic director for business
strategy. "Other institutions
make different decisions
about how many staff they
feel are needed to work to
support the operation."
In 2009, Stanford made its
first bowl appearance in eight
years at the Sun Bowl. The
Cardinal has qualified for a
BCS bowl in each of the three
seasons since, which Eubanks
said taught the department a
lot about how to run an effi
cient bowl operation.
"What we learned from
our planning and our budget
ing process helped us go in
and really avoid the surpris
es," Eubanks said. "We
understood what was going to
pop up and did a great job of
trying to keep everything at a
zero balanced budget."
Stanford also avoided sig

nifieant losses due to high
demand for tickets. Bowl par
ticipants are contractually
obligated to purchase a block
of tickets and try to sell them
to their fans. Many schools
report that the majority of
their losses come from absorb
ing the costs of unsold tickets.
For the 2013 Rose Bowl,
Stanford fans bought all of the
30,193 tickets allocated to
Stanford in less than 24
hours. The athletic depart
ment ultimately acquired and
sold approximately 8,000
more tickets. However, Stan
ford did not earn supplemen
tal revenue from selling addi
tional tickets, since all ticket
income goes back to the bowl
organizers.
"The revenue from those
tickets went to the Rose
Bowl," Eubanks said. "We
were selling the Rose Bowl's
tickets and providing an addi
tional service to our fans, our
alumni and our students by
being able to meet their
demand and so that they
would be able to sit in Stan
ford's section."
According to Roger Noll, a
professor emeritus of eco
nomics who has done
research on the economics of
intercollegiate athletics, there
is very little direct financial
incentive for schools to partic

ipate in bowl games, with
most benefits emerging only
over time.
"Schools expect that it will
increase ticket sales for the
next year and that it will
increase their ability to
recruit," Noll said. "The hope
is that the publicity associated
with it will be helpful."
University officials said
that, while the monetary
impact can be hard to quanti
fy, winning the Rose Bowl
certainly created excitement
among the fan base and likely
prompted a more active
donor base.
"There's no question that
the financial support [from
alumni and donors] that the
athletic department and the
university receives is stirred
up by Stanford playing in and
winning the Rose Bowl
game," Eubanks said. "People
are excited and want to
reward a job that is well done,
and there can be no job that is
done better than winning a
Rose Bowl."
Noll said that for schools
that have built then- reputa
tion on strong academics, the
benefits of increased expo
sure are likely less than they
would otherwise be.
"Stanford is not exactly
your standard football facto
ry," Noll said. "For schools
like Stanford, Northwestern
and Duke, which have high
quality undergraduates and
many times as many appli
cants as they have students,
there's not a whole lot of addi
tional publicity value because
that's not the main reason to
go there."
According to Jon Denney
