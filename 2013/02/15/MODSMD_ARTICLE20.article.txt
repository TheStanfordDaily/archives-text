## The 						Death of a Great Man Whose Wisdom Lives On 
### SHARIA MAYFIELD '13 
It is with great sorrow and with
my utmost condolences that I
acknowledge the recent death
of Stanford English Professor J.
Martin Evans.
As a former student of his and a
recent Stanford graduate with a
degree in English, I cannot help but
feel as though his death on Sunday
night was something more than that
of an eventuality at the hands of a
deadly illness. Though I do not
know the exact circumstances of his
last moments, I do know that his life
has inspired and imbued countless
people in the literary field and
beyond. Having taken two classes
with him one based purely on
Miltonic literature and another on
"Textual Selves," or identities in
historic literature I can person
ally attest to his vast stores of
knowledge and wisdom. His enthu
siasm was incredible and distinct;
often times, he would trail off on
either grandiose adulations or hum
ble speculations. Neither was he
shy to criticize, once claiming that
Montaigne was "not a systematic
thinker; he wasn't even logical," and
then going on to differentiate

between heliocentrity and geocen
tricity. His attentiveness to detail, to
the intentionality of every word,
every allusion, every line-break (in
the case of poetry), reflected his
immense passion for literature.
He also managed to show a real
side to the people the identities
who create literature. He explored
the projections of self in their texts.
In St. Augustine's "Confessions," we
see a man in spiritual tumult, search
ing for faith through trial and error;
in "Innocents Abroad," we see a
snarky Twain juggling reverence of
European history with pure Ameri
can mockery of it.
Particularly memorable was a
segment in class on Milton's poetic
agency. We explored many texts, but
I recall Professor Evans dedicating
a lot of time and attention to Mil
ton's "Lycidas," a pastoral elegy in
honor of Edward King, Milton's
friend who had drowned in a ship
accident. It wasn't so much the
poem that fascinated me, but Pro
fessor Evans' mutual understand
ing, his connection, to this man cen
turies removed from our generation.
Professor Evans knew that one of

the best ways to honor a fellow
writer's death was to glorify the
deceased person in writing. He got
lost in literature, found friends in
deceased writers whose legacy lived
on in their works. Literature formed
the bonds of a scholarly fraternity
whose participants were admitted
based upon their contributions to
the field, no matter living or dead.
It is because of this bond, this
sense of reverential loyalty to a
deceased mentor, that I write this
now. In what little space and plat
form I have, I want to thank Profes
sor Evans for opening my eyes to a
commitment and brotherhood I had
never seen before. I want to honor
his contributions to the literary
field, and to the educational field, by
attesting to the wisdom he has
passed on to his former students.
And mostly, I want to say that,
although Professor Evans has
passed away, he will live on in our
memories and in the texts he has
left behind to grace us with. Rest
in peace, Professor J. Martin
Evans.
