# The 						Irony is Delicious

### ANDREW GAY'12 
On Wednesday, Feb. 13, The
Stanford Daily published a
cartoon that, by virtually all
definitions of the word, was "offen
sive." The cartoon depicted an
alarming caricature of recently
resigned Pope Benedict XVI hold
ing a scepter that read "conser
vatism" while a number of badges
littered his cloak with slogans like
"No Gays," "No Condoms," "No
AIDS Prevention," and so on.
To anyone who identifies as
Catholic or even as a non-denom
inational Christian the cartoon
was unquestionably disrespectful
and, to many, downright crass.
However, my issue here is not to
pronounce my outrage and demand
some public spectacle of an apology
from The Daily, but rather to make
two observations:
First, The Daily would never
even contemplate the publication of
a similar portrayal of Mohammad
or Allah (and for good reason),
despite the fact that Islam and
Christianity share the majority of
the doctrine that the cartoon calls
into question (same-sex unions,
women clerics, etc.). Besides the
fact that such a depiction is consid
ered blasphemous in Islamic doc
trine and would unquestionably
have provoked immediate backlash
and critical protest, such a depiction

would be considered disrespectful
and insensitive.
Sound familiar? The double
standard that is applied when
examining Christian versus Islamic
doctrine is by no means a new phe
nomenon, but that doesn't mean it
isn't worth being reminded of from
time to time. In the end, if The Dai
ly wants to publish a cartoon that
"offends" my constituency, they
have every right to do so. I just wish
the playing field were a little more
even.
Second, rather than pronounce a
call to arms due to the grave
"offense" I have suffered at the
hands of a small drawing, I think it's
worth reiterating that I do not
actually have the "right" not to be
offended by the world around me.
That is not to suggest that I am
defending hate speech (because I
am absolutely not). Instead, I am
simply suggesting that people
around us have differing views
about how the world operates, and
invariably those views will rankle
us from time to time; c'est la vie.
Take, for example, the recent
case of Joel Brinkley and his unfor
tunate column on Vietnamese cui
sine. Was his logic questionable?
Certainly. Was his claim outlandish
and frustrating to those of Viet
namese descent, or really anyone

who thought about it for more than
30 seconds? Absolutely. Does that
mean his opinion was "offensive"
and should be silenced? I am no
defender of Brinkley, but I can't be
the only one to find this response
over the top.
Our idyllic campus has gone to
great pains in recent years to cre
ate a "safe and open space," and,
while I think this initiative is an
important and necessary step, it
appears to have come at the
expense of all critical dialogue on
this campus. Any position or idea
that is deemed "offensive"
whether as mundane as the idea
that one could vote conservative or
as radical as that marriage should
be between a man and woman is
immediately stamped out in the
name of tolerance and openness.
I understand where this reac
tion comes from, but that does not
mean that students on both sides of
the issues should not be able to rec
ognize the irony involved. Next
time you find yourself "offended"
by something, take a breath and
ask yourself, "Am I upset because
the comment or action was gen
uinely aimed at causing me physical
or mental harm, or am I just mad
because they don't think like I do?"
