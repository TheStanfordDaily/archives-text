# SLAMMIN'POETRY
## Hearing their V.O.I.C.E. Project founders introduce new writers to slam poetry 
### Antonio Ramirez | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine three instances where you
felt love for another person,
explored these moments, wrote
about them and eventually shared out
loud your work with others. Just such a
process is an example of a teaching
method used by Project V.0.1.C.E. a
program designed by Sarah Kay and
Phil Kaye to introduce students to the
art form of spoken word poetry. On
Saturday, the two founders of Project
V.0.1.C.E. graced a packed Annenberg
Auditorium with a performance hosted
by Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and PASE.
The show included poems such as "B,"
"When Love Arrives" and "Teeth,"
among others.
Generally, Project V.0.1.C.E.
begins with a performance in order to
show people what spoken word poetry
looks and sounds like. However, the
true purpose of Project V.0.1.C.E. is
not to entertain a crowd. Rather, it is to
affirm the belief that almost anyone
can enjoy poetry and use it as a foun
dation for personal growth.
"I think that it only takes one
poem for someone to see poetry and
go, 'I like that. That's cool,"' Kay said.
"The trick is, you never know what
poem is going to be for what person."
Following a performance, Kay
and Kaye led a workshop for students.
This aspect of Project V.0.1.C.E. may

stem from the founders' high school
experiences, as Sarah Kay began a poet
ry initiative while attending United
Nations International High School in
New York City, and Phil Kaye travelled
to prisons to teach convicted inmates
about his chosen form of art.
As educators of spoken word
poetry, there are many barriers that can
arise during the teaching process.
According to Kay, one obstacle they
repeatedly face is convincing students
to stop believing that they aren't good
enough to write poetry.
"If you sit down and write a bad
poem, there's absolutely nothing wrong
with that," Kay said. "We write bad
poems all the time we have to.
That's how we work through them
we learn from them, and we figure out
what works better."
To ease into the process of writing
poetry, sometimes Kay and Kaye have
their students write out lists.
"When you say to someone,
"Write me a poem," sometimes that
makes them freak out because a poem
has a lot of connotations that are
sometimes scary to people," Kay
explained. "Whereas if you tell some
one to write a list, that's a form that
they're much more comfortable with.
Usually because it's much more famil
iar to them."

These lists include five things
you know to be true, five things you
should've learned by now, five rea
sons you would make the next best
president of the United States and
five reasons you would make a terri
ble girlfriend. The lists are not finite
and can be about anything, just so
long as they allow for the opportu
nity to create.
Project V.0.1.C.E. has had
remarkable success around the
world, reaching all the way to India,
South Africa and Australia. Early in
2011, Kay performed at two differ
ent TEDTalks, including her famous
talk "If I Should Have A Daughter."
One particular occasion that
Kay regards as a success is when
Project V.0.1.C.E. did a performance
in an auditorium full of students
who, until that day, had never heard
of spoken word poetry. At the end,
Kay and Kaye asked if any of the
students were willing to come on
stage to speak and, understandably,
no one came up.
A year later, the two returned
to the same school and asked the
same question. This time a student's
hand shot up, and he came on stage
and recited a poem that he wrote
the day of the performance a year
before.
