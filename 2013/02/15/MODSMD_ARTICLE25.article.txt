## THE 						BEST VALENTINE'S WE EKEND RESTAURANTS 
### Roxanna Reaves | STAFF WRITER 
Saving your Valentine's Day festivities for the
weekend? Intermission has a few dinner ideas for
your hot date.

Spontaneous dates are fun. Spontaneous
dates on Valentine's Day are ... stressful, to say
the least Haven't thought of anywhere to take
your sweetheart for the most romantic day of
the year? Don't worry; you haven't earned the
worst-special-friend-of-the-year award just
yet. Instead of settling for a hasty, last-minute
reservation at The Cheesecake Factory, try one
of these cool and different restaurants that still
have a couple tables for two available.

Juicy Steak, Well Done Date — LB
Steak
If you plan on going all out for Valentine's
Day, try LB Steak in either Menlo Park or
Santana Row for a decadent and unforget
table dinner, with options such as classy Slow
roasted New York strip loin or fresh seared
scallops in a caviar buerre blanc. It might be
hard to keep focused on your object of desire
when there's a goat cheese souffle on your
plate. Still, ladies get to go home with one of
the complimentary roses that will surely be
decorating the restaurant this weekend. Not a
bad option if you forget to pick up flowers.
Quick Trip to the Islands — Coconuts
Caribbean Restaurant & Bar
Forget the private jet — take your date to
Coconuts for an exotic night out. Just a block
off University Avenue, Coconuts has an
affordable and adventurous menu. Try a first
course of tasty seafood salad or a main entree

option of jerk chicken or beer-braised short
ribs. Your brief island vacation might end
with some chocolate-dipped strawberries
and, if you're lucky, some berry nice kisses.
THAT Bougie French Place Pastis
Bistro
Three things just say classic romance: candle
light, red roses and gourmet French cuisine.
This classy little bistro on S. California
Avenue will be sure to leave your date smit
ten. Share a lobster crab bisque, mascarpone
ravioli, duck confit salad or filet mignon.
This place isn't for any just any couple,
though. A serious meal like that one will
clearly show your date you're serious about
your relationship.
For a lower pressure but just as cute
date, try a lunch at Pastis. Their highly
praised croque-monsieur or salmon eggs
benedict are full flavor but laid back, just like
you and your crush.
Show 'Em You're a Hot Tamale
Reposado
Celebrate Dfa De San Valentin at this upscale
Mexican restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.
Dine among the city's trendiest power cou
ples and order the lobster and corn fritter
appetizer, lamb loin entree and passion fruit
souffle dessert. Nothing says "te amo" quite
like authentic ethnic cuisine.
Golden State of Mind California Cafe
Love is in the air, and at a more reasonable
price too. You and your practical date will fall
in love with the meal at California Cafe. At a
fraction of the price of other menus, you'll
still be choosing from delicacies such as crab
cake sliders, a slow roasted Cateubriand steak
and white chocolate creme brulee. Enjoy in
beautiful indoor decor or outside on their
lovely patio.
The Anti-Valentine's Day Spot Hot
Tamales
Love stinks, but your V-Day doesn't have to.
Maybe you're not sold on this whole mushy
gushy holiday or you think it's a government
conspiracy plot to commercialize intimate
relationships for the sake 0f... God knows
what. Fear not, Hot Tamales in Santana Row
down in San Jose embraces your hate of roses
and hearts and invites you to party instead
perfect to drown your sorrows if you've
just been dumped. Maybe you might even
find somebody there.
