## SIDE EFFECTS Director Steven Soderbergh's last film shines with talented cast 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
Director Steven
Soderbergh, who first
took Cannes by storm
in the late 'Bos with his inde
pendent film "Sex, Lies, and
Videotape," and later went on to
make serious critical darlings like
"Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich,"
has been shifting gears to genre
films in the last couple of years.
Last year brought us "Magic
Mike," a low budget stripper
movie more concerned with
failed dreams than naked bodies,
and "Haywire," an art action
movie, both following on the
tails of the harrowing
"Contagion," a multinational
thriller and horror film.
Although his latest efforts
may not have resulted in his
best films, these have all been
masterpieces of genre. He has
announced his retirement
hopefully temporary from
cinema, a great loss. His latest
and final film, "Side Effects,"
part horror and part thriller, is
no exception: an expertly
directed film of a relatively
intelligent, though somewhat
implausible, script by Scott Z.
Burns, the screenwriter also
behind Soderbergh's
"Contagion" and "The
Informant!".
What starts off as a caution
ary tale about our culture's

obsession with over-medicating
turns harrowing with a much
darker underbelly, more about
the masks that society requires
and the intersecting stories of a
trio of despicable, calculating,
self-absorbed and very smart
people.
The film centers on Emily
(Rooney Mara), a fragile
woman whose husband
(Channing Tatum), imprisoned
for insider trading, is about to
be released. She hugs him tight
ly with the appearance of joy at
his return, but she ends up hav
ing unenthusiastic sex, some
what ambivalent to if not
unhappy about her husband's
return.
After she attempts suicide
by impulsively drives her car
quickly into a wall, Emilyfinds
herself in hospital, examined by
a psychiatrist, Dr. Banks (Jude
Law), to whom she confesses to
being blue but offers few details
aside from explaining her des
perate need to leave the hospi
tal, to keep her job and take care
of her husband. Tie gives her a
prescription; she agrees to come
to his office for therapy.
The medication doesn't seem
to be helping. She goes to thera
py frantically but is tight-lipped
about her depression, lest she be

found to be actually crazy. When
she switches to the fictional drug
Ablixa and her sex drive returns,
her husband is thrilled: she has
the appearance of a functional
person, enough to satisfy those
around her with the pretense of
normalcy without ever return
ing to that state herself.
As the title suggests, Ablixa
has some unexpected and rather
consequential side effects, lead
ing Emily to commit a terrible
act. No one is sure who to blame
for it: Emily, her psychiatrist, her
former psychiatrist, the drug
itself, or our medicating culture.
When the ensuing trial proves
more damaging to Dr. Banks
than for Emily—losing patients
from the publicity while old
scandals resurface —Emily's
blameless story starts to seem
too perfect, too familiar.
"Side Effects" is rich in the
film language of suspicion and
of the thriller genre. From the
beginning, when the camera first
sweeps into an apartment build
ing through the window, we get
the sense that we're looking in
on something that's not quite
right. The camera is placed to
distance us from the characters,
often with space, and often by
never letting us look head-on at
the characters. Almost all close
ups are from the side or looking
slightly down at our characters
leaving the viewer with a sense
of unease. Meanwhile Thomas
Newman's eerie score is always
in the background, propelling
the story forward, auguring
trouble.
"Side Effects" earns its plot
twists, and the conventions it
embraces set us up for them,
without reducing their shock
level. The motivation is some
what contrived, but the film
gets away with it because even
what seems expected or
cliched is meticulously con
structed that way.
