## Students fight campus food truck policy 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mia's Catering, a Mexican food truck, will no
longer serve food on the Stanford campus as per
the University's new mobile food vendor policy.
In response, community members have circulat
ed a petition calling for the University to relax
their food truck policy, which has already driven
the popular food truck Net Appetit off campus.
On Monday, a Stanford sheriff asked Mia's
Catering owner Nimia Knuth to leave campus
per the University's new policy that all food
trucks must operate under food truck manage
ment company Off the Grid.
Knuth had previously parked her food truck
in front of Harold, next to Encina Hall, for about
15 minutes every afternoon, and she received a
notice from the University before winter break
informing her about how to contact Off the Grid
to remain on campus. However, Off the Grid's
proposed schedule of 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. two days
a week did not fit into Knuth's scheduled route
of construction sites on campus and other loca
tions in Palo Alto.
Knuth only has about seven customers per
shift at Harold, but she continued coming to
serve a group of faithful customers, including
students, staff and faculty. Graduate student
Ariel Mendez was one of Knuth's loyal cus
tomers.
"Her food was so good, and it was so afford
able, that even on days when I thought I was
having a really bad day, as long as I had some of
her food for lunch, I felt like it wasn't a total
loss," she said.
"I hate to leave them," Knuth said. "It's my
business, but at the same time, I care about
them too. Sometimes I'm very late to come over
here because my construction holds me longer,
and they're here waiting for me.
"I love that, but at the same time, I don't
want to go against Stanford rules," Knuth
added.
Mia's Catering has been on campus since the
1997-98 restoration of Encina Hall, serving con
struction sites at places from the Stanford Hos
pital to Bing Concert Hall. Many of Knuth's cus
tomers expressed frustration that the mobile
food vendor policy prevents Mia's Catering
from remaining on campus outside of construc
tion sites.
"You're losing a lot of variety and choices,
both in terms of food availability, but then also in
terms of geography," said Lucas Puente, a polit
ical science graduate student.
In response to Knuth's removal, Puente cre
ated a petition that aims to "end the University
sanctioned food truck oligopoly on Stanford's
campus." A day after he posted the petition, it
had over 120 signatures.
"[The goal of the petition is] just to gather as
many names as possible and then show [Susan
Weinstein], any decision-maker in that office or
in the University more broadly that there are a
lot of people who care about the availability of
food trucks on campus and that they are not
happy with the new status quo," Puente said.
So far, Puente has tried to
spread the word about the petition
primarily through social media. He
hopes to get at least 500 signatures
before presenting it to Weinstein.
The petition addresses Puente's
concerns that the new mobile food
vendor policy limits options for
Stanford students.
"It's a very simple microeco
nomic principle that limiting com
petition is going to hurt con
sumers," Puente said.
Both Puente and Mendez
emphasized that Knuth has a spot
less health record and operates in

line with the University's stan
dards.
"[Knuth is] a really wonderful,
caring person," Mendez said.
"She's not someone that I would
single out as a problem for the
things that the policy is supposed
to eliminate."
Puente expressed optimism
about the possibility of policy revi
sions.
"I haven't talked to anybody
who's strongly in favor of the new
policy and wouldn't advocate at
least some changes to it," Puente
said. "I think people want to see
the consumers' interests put first
and not the University's bank
account."
