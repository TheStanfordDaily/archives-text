# LIFTOFF IN HOUSTON
## Mark Appel takes the mound on opening day 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Freshman Freddy Avis always wanted to
come to Stanford. He never thought he'd play
college baseball with Mark Appel.
But that all changed when Appel passed
on $3.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates
last July and decided to return to the Farm,
making him the only first-round pick in last
year's MLB Draft not to sign a contract.
Appel's return as the Friday starter for a
third straight year became the dominant sto
ry of the Stanford baseball offseason, but it's
the Avises on the field that fans should keep
their eyes on as the season begins at Rice
tonight.
That's because the Cardinal's 2013 Col
lege World Series bid could have a lot more to
do with its fresh-faced fastballers than its sea
soned starters.
Eight months after a second straight
Stanford season stagnated in the Super
Regionals, the preseason No. 7 Cardinal will
move forward with a mix of veterans and new
blood that could finally get it over the hump
and to Omaha.
"Last year we had a lot of guys who were
pretty talented, superstars, but we kind of
didn't really get to click as much," said junior

NOTES: Stanford baseball kicks off the sea
son this weekend with a three-game
series on the road against Rice. The Car
dinal is No. 7 in the preseason rankings
but will be challenged by an Owls squad
that is No. 18 with plenty to prove. Hous
ton native Mark Appel will take the ball
for Stanford tonight in a return to his
hometown after turning down an offer as
the eiqhth overall pick in last June's MLB
Draft.


centei'fielder Austin Wilson, one of
only two returning position players
who started both on opening day and
in the postseason in 2012. "I feel like
this year we have guys who can click
more and can help us move on and
get through hard times."
At the heart of the lineup along
side Wilson is fellow third-year
starter Brian Ragira, but in stark
contrast to this time a year ago,
when Stanford returned seven of
eight position players, the bulk of
the Cardinal's at-bats will be taken
by players who were not regulars
throughout 2012.
Juniors Lonnie Kauppila, who
missed half of 2012 with a knee
injury, and Danny Diekroeger, a
midseason replacement, are back to
anchor the middle infield; sopho
mores Alex Blandino and Dominic
Jose will start at third and in left,
respectively. But each of those four
players started in fewer than half
the team's 2012 contests.
Sophomore Wayne Taylor will
take over behind the plate for the
departed Eric Smith, whose break
out junior campaign earned him a
late-round draft pick, while speedy
freshman Jonny Locher will start in
centerfield in place of ninth-rounder
Jake Stewart.
If you're looking for experience,
you'll find it on the bench, where
senior Justin Ringo and juniors
Brett Michael Doran and Brian Guy
mon will make Stanford one of the
Pac-12's deepest squads.
"We have guys on the bench who
are honestly great players who
would start anywhere else," Wilson
said.
That flexibility will be crucial for

head coach Mark Marquess as he
prepares to start a lineup that is
somewhat less proven than the one
that finished 26th in the nation in
runs scored last season.
"We have a good offensive team,
and I think that's critical," Marquess
told GoStanford.com on baseball
media day. 'At the same time, when
it's all said and done, it's all about
pitching."
Stanford's pitching will again
start with Appel, who turned in a 10-
2 junior campaign a year ago. The
righty was beyond dominant, strik
ing out 10 on eight occasions and
pitching a clutch four-hitter in his
regional win against Fresno State.
Sophomore John Hochstatter
will step in on Saturdays after a
rocky freshman campaign that saw
him win his first three starts before
going 0-3 in his final six, including a
1-0 loss to this weekend's opponent,
Rice.
"He pitched very well for us ear
ly in the season, and then I think he
kind of wore down and tailed off a lit
tle bit the second half," Marquess
said. "But he's really been pitching
well in the fall for us."
Stanford's only other tested
starter, junior A. J. Vanegas, is recov
ering from back surgery and won't
return until midseason, likely as a
closer. So the Sunday spot could
rotate as the season progresses
which worked to the tune of a 9-4
record in series finales last season.
The local favorite, Avis, grew up
coming to Stanford games and
called it "surreal" to finally play
with the Cardinal in Sunken Dia
mond. He's working on locating his
pitches and tuning his changeup,

learning all the while from Appel,
the Ail-American righty he never
thought he would have the chance to
play alongside.
"We're going to have a lot of
guys, a lot of great freshmen and
veterans who are going to con
tribute," Avis said. "Whether or not
it's me who's pitching, I think we're
going to be successful either way."
Though Alvis has certainly
impressed the coaching staff, it's
senior Dean McArdle who has been
given the nod to take the mound on
Sunday. Stanford's staff will face a
Rice lineup that returns just four
starters, though one of those is star
second baseman Christian Stringer,
a .343 hitter in 2012. The No. 17
Owls, meanwhile, are led on the
mound by preseason second-team
Ail-American Austin Kubitza, who is
coming off back-to-back 15-start
seasons.
The Cardinal took two of three
from Rice last season to cap its
impressive 13-2 preseason. Howev
er, after a lengthy finals break, Stan
ford staggered into Pac-12 play and
eventually finished in a three-way tie
for fourth in the conference. As it
hopes to avoid that fate and host a
Super Regional this time around, it
will be putting its faith in inexperi
enced talent: Jose, Hochstatter, Avis
and others.
"If we start clicking, working
together as a team, I think a nation
al championship is not out of the
question," Appel told GoStanford.com.
The potential is there. Now all
that's left is baseball.
