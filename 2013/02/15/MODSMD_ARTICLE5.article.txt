# LIFTOFF IN HOUSTON
## Mark Appel takes the mound on opening day 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Freshman Freddy Avis always wanted to
come to Stanford. He never thought he'd play
college baseball with Mark Appel.
But that all changed when Appel passed
on $3.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates
last July and decided to return to the Farm,
making him the only first-round pick in last
year's MLB Draft not to sign a contract.
Appel's return as the Friday starter for a
third straight year became the dominant sto
ry of the Stanford baseball offseason, but it's
the Avises on the field that fans should keep
their eyes on as the season begins at Rice
tonight.
That's because the Cardinal's 2013 Col
lege World Series bid could have a lot more to
do with its fresh-faced fastballers than its sea
soned starters.
Eight months after a second straight
Stanford season stagnated in the Super
Regionals, the preseason No. 7 Cardinal will
move forward with a mix of veterans and new
blood that could finally get it over the hump
and to Omaha.
"Last year we had a lot of guys who were
pretty talented, superstars, but we kind of
didn't really get to click as much," said junior

NOTES: Stanford baseball kicks off the sea
son this weekend with a three-game
series on the road against Rice. The Car
dinal is No. 7 in the preseason rankings
but will be challenged by an Owls squad
that is No. 18 with plenty to prove. Hous
ton native Mark Appel will take the ball
for Stanford tonight in a return to his
hometown after turning down an offer as
the eiqhth overall pick in last June's MLB
Draft.
