## Professors' Coursera use in question Students complain the "flipped classroom" model falls short of potential 
### LUCY SVOBODA 
Even as Coursera, an online learning plat
form developed at Stanford, continues to
assume an increasingly influential role in the
field of online education, its usage at Stanford
has prompted concerns among students that
courses using the platform have not fully
exploited its potential.
Coursera was launched in April 2012 by
Associate Professor of Computer Science
Andrew Ng and Professor of Computer Sci
ence Daphne Roller Ph.D. '94, and it has since
partnered with 33 universities to offer free
online courses to millions of students.
Coursera's focus on facilitating a "flipped
classroom" model of education —in which
students watch pre-recorded lectures on their
own before interacting with professors during
class time has, however, been inconsistent
ly applied in several Stanford courses that use
Coursera, with professors instead combining
the new format with traditional lectures.
"It would make sense if we were using
Coursera to achieve a pure flipped classroom
experience, but we aren't doing that," said
Johnny Winston 'l5, who took CS 147: Intro
duction to Human-Computer Interaction
which used Coursera —in fall quarter. "We
only meet in small design studio groups one
out of the three days of class, and the other
two days consist of a more traditional lecture
format."
Nate Nunez 'l5, who was also enrolled in
CS 147, agreed, arguing that class time "could
be better used" compared to the frequent
replication of content between lectures and
online videos.
By contrast, Scott Klemmer, who taught
CS 147, claimed that there were several
important differences between his online and
live lectures. He said that feedback gathered
from CS 147 students would lead to revisions
in the course's content and use of Coursera in
the future.
"There are benefits and drawbacks of
being an early adopter," Klemmer, an associ
ate professor of computer science, said. "This
academic year of students gets the advantage
of being first people to experience the flipped
classroom, but they have the challenge of
dealing with first-generation software."
Dan Boneh, a professor of computer sci
ence who currently teaches CS 255: Introduc
tion to Cryptography through Coursera, said
he is using a "semi-flipped" classroom model.
Boneh posts videos of course content on
Coursera, increasing the time available in lec
ture for student questions, and integrates
quizzes into his videos using the Coursera
software to help students track their
progress.
"It's not just using Coursera as a
You Tube," Boneh said. "It's a lot more than
that."
