### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Valentine's Evening at Cafe Wilbur, an
event planned in just over a week and exe
cuted by a team of freshmen, served a
free catered dinner to 200 students yes
terday.
Stephen Ahn 'l6 and Brandon Hill 'l6,
the primary event organizers, collaborat
ed with Wilbur Dining to host the event.
The team recruited over 30 volunteer
waiters and waitresses to set up before the
event, serve food and clean up afterwards.
Ahn said the dinner was capped to make
sure all attendees could comfortably fit in
one side of Wilbur Dining. Freshmen
reserved tickets in groups of two to eight
through the online platform Event√ürite,
and Ahn said that although ticket sales
were "relatively slow" at first, the event
sold out within two days.
The organizers used Facebook and mail
ing lists to publicize the dinner, emphasiz
ing the gourmet menu and "classy Valen
tine's Day atmosphere for couples and
friends alike."
Kendall Weierich 'l6, who attended the
event with her boyfriend, was particularly
impressed by the food options, which
included prime rib, tofu and mushroom

skewers and grilled zucchini.
"They had everything that pretty much
could accommodate different dietary habits
and a good amount of variety," Weierich
said. "It was a really fancy dinner."
The event also featured a performance
from a capella group the Mendicants, as
well as solo performances from several

freshmen musicians.
"It was more than what I expected,"
Weierich said. "They had Martinellis every
where and decorations with rose petals on
the table. It was really pretty."
