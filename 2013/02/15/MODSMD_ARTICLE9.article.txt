## Q&A: Eitan Winer Pinkas, SSE's new CEO 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Eitan Winer Pinkas 'l2 M.S. 'l2 was
recently appointed CEO of Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE), the organization respon
sible for maintaining the long-term financial
stability of the ASSU. He will begin work in
July, leading a staff of almost 100 employees
and managing more than $l5 million in
investments and $2 million in annual rev
enues for a two-year term. Winer Pinkas sat
down with The Daily to discuss how he is
preparing for the job and what his plans are
for the SSE.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): As part of
your application, you were asked for three
objectives for SSE. What were they?
Eitan Winer Pinkas (EWP): I think the
three things have changed a lot since I start
ed training... In terms of going forward, the
most clear objective is maximizing the cre
ation of value that SSE provides the Stanford
community. I think in order to maximize the
creation of value we have to try to run [SSE]
as closely as possible to real businesses.
TSD: What do you believe makes you
qualified for the position, and why do you
think that you were chosen?
EWP: I think my involvement with the
Stanford community in the past several
years, as an RA or with student groups or
TAing classes, showed my passion and dedi
cation for the school. Along with that, it was
probably a personality fit, too. I like to think
I'm a happy person, a fun person.
A lot of this business has to do with strat
egy and also with management, and I think

that my background,
whether through intern
ships or outside projects
or just personality, would
contribute to that.
TSD: Since you were
selected, what have you
been doing to prepare

for taking on the role of

CEO?
EWP: I actually have started formally
training together with Neveen [Mahmoud
'll], who is the current CEO. Today, for exam
ple, we were together for three hours. The
first couple hours was more of a formal train
ing where we started going through things
that we would want to do in coming weeks.
One hour was dedicated to specifically look
ing at the operations of the Stanford Student
Store.
TSD: Are you planning on restructur
ing or refocusing the SSE in any way?
EWP: In the past, many CEOs have
focused a lot on expansion. Of course, expan
sion should always be the end goal, but I think
in the position we are in now it is very impor
tant to strengthen the foundations we have.
We have very good businesses in the Stanford
Student Store and advertising and Ground
Up. [We should] strengthen those bases a lot,
then [look] to expand.

TSD: What do you see as the main chal
lenges facing the SSE, and how do you
plan to overcome them?
EWP: I think something that every CEO
has to struggle through is the fact that we are
a student-run business. That has limitations

specifically in terms of the high turnover rate
of students and how that affects our ability to
accomplish long or even medium-term goals.
I think increasing our ability to deal with
high turnover, whether it is through the pass
ing of institutional knowledge or the better
training and transmission of previous learned
experiences from one manager to the next, is
important. I think recruiting will be a great
part too, making sure that the people we are
recruiting are hardworking and really care
about the organization and want to be a part
of it.

TSD: Campus Mobile, the cell phone
store managed by SSE, was predicted to
be financially stable but is now closing.
What went wrong with Campus Mobile,
and how can the SSE prevent this from
happening to its other enterprises, like
Ground Up?
EWP: I think it's very important to under
stand the reasons behind why Campus
Mobile is closing. It definitely is not a man
agement failure or a business strategy or an
execution failure, in that sense Campus
Mobile was very well run... We live in a bub
ble, and I think the bubble that we serve was
just not the best market we could have had
for [Campus Mobile].
To prevent things like this from happen
ing in the future, I think something I will
focus on a lot is developing future projects
and future enterprises based on needs.
