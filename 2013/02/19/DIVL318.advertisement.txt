Public Policy 128
This course will focus on advanced international problem-solving through the
lens of international NGOs, while integrating other relevant players that address
global issues. The course will emphasize: policy, business, strategy, ethics, and
engagement with other players. Students will consider the major issues that
international NGOs face in their effort to effect positive change in an increasingly
complex global environment. The course draws heavily on a series of sophisticated
case studies involving a variety of NGOs, areas of specialization, and geographic
regions. Topics may include: poverty and famine; the natural resources curse;
terrorism; medical humanitarian aid, HIV/Aids and other epidemics and neglected
diseases; natural disasters and emergencies; climate change; and contagion of
unethical behavior. Students will have the opportunity to work with several
internationally prominent guests. A final project tailored to each student's interest
will be in lieu of a final exam. Class attendance required.
