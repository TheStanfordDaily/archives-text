## Stanford sweeps again 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Over Presidents' Day weekend, the
Stanford women's basketball swept both
Los Angeles schools on the road, first de
feating USC 79-55 on Friday night and
then earning a 68-57 victory over UCLA
on Sunday.

The wins ensured that the No. 4 Car
dinal (24-2, 13-1 Pac-12) would stay tied
for top spot in the Pac-12 Conference with
No. 6 Berkeley (23-2,13-1), which also de
feated both Southern Californian schools
this past weekend.
The Trojans (8-17, 5-9) meanwhile
dropped to eighth place in the table, and
the No. 15 Brains (19-6,10-4) look to have
lost their chance to return to the head of
the pack. With just four games remaining
for each team in the regular season,
UCLA would need both Stanford and
California to lose three games and newly
third-placed Washington to also slip up at
least once.
On Friday, junior forward Chiney Og
wumike stood out for the Card, grabbing
her record setting 20th double-double of
the season, with 26 points and 15 re
bounds. Joining Ogwumike in double fig
ures, senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
recorded her second double-double of the
season with 17 points and 11 rebounds,
senior forward Mikaela Ruef scored 12
points and sophomore guard Amber Or
range netted 10 points. Ruef also set a
