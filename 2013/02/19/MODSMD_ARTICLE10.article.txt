## Stanford sweeps again 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Over Presidents' Day weekend, the
Stanford women's basketball swept both
Los Angeles schools on the road, first de
feating USC 79-55 on Friday night and
then earning a 68-57 victory over UCLA
on Sunday.

The wins ensured that the No. 4 Car
dinal (24-2, 13-1 Pac-12) would stay tied
for top spot in the Pac-12 Conference with
No. 6 Berkeley (23-2,13-1), which also de
feated both Southern Californian schools
this past weekend.
The Trojans (8-17, 5-9) meanwhile
dropped to eighth place in the table, and
the No. 15 Brains (19-6,10-4) look to have
lost their chance to return to the head of
the pack. With just four games remaining
for each team in the regular season,
UCLA would need both Stanford and
California to lose three games and newly
third-placed Washington to also slip up at
least once.
On Friday, junior forward Chiney Og
wumike stood out for the Card, grabbing
her record setting 20th double-double of
the season, with 26 points and 15 re
bounds. Joining Ogwumike in double fig
ures, senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
recorded her second double-double of the
season with 17 points and 11 rebounds,
senior forward Mikaela Ruef scored 12
points and sophomore guard Amber Or
range netted 10 points. Ruef also set a

personal points-in-a-game record, top
ping the 11 she made against Arizona a
week ago.
Trojan sophomore forward Alexyz
Yaioletma and junior forward Cassie
Harberts netted double-figure points,
with 13 and 14, respectively. But crucial
ly for the Cardinal, sophomore guard
Ariya Crook, who alongside Harberts is
the only other USC player with a dou
ble-figure season scoring average, hit
just six points.
Ogwumike again put in another
strong performance on Sunday, hitting
26 points to keep her record of double
figure scoring in every game this season
still alive. However, Ruef also continued
her strong ran of form, grabbing her
second career double-double, with 10
points and 10 rebounds.
Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle was
just shy of joining Ruef, too, hitting 10
points and grabbing nine rebounds.
Among the guards, sophomore Amber
Orrange might not have made double
figures in any one category, but her nine
points, seven assists, six rebounds and
five steals show how much her all
around play contributed to Stanford's
win.
The biggest three scoring threats to
the Cardinal from UCLA before the
game looked likely to be senior forward
Alyssia Brewer, redshirt junior forward
Atonye Nyingifa and senior guard/for
ward Markel Walker, all with double-fig
ure point averages. True to form,
Nyingifa, Brewer and Walker hit 12,10
and 10 points, respectively.
UCLA fell behind by nine points af
ter a Stanford 9-2 run midway through
first half but clawed that back to within
two points after increasing the pressure
on the Card and preventing the visiting
team from comfortably settling into its
lead. When Stanford freshman forward
Tess Picknell was called for a flagrant

foul two minutes before the break, it
looked like the momentum had com
pletely turned.
However, the Cardinal opened the
lead back out to five before halftime,
and returning from the break, it
stretched further ahead to earn 16
points of breathing space with ten min
utes left in the game.
UCLA struggled when freshman
guard Kari Korver had to leave the con
test after picking up a cut on her right
cheek when she tried to defend Ogwu
mike. Korver had looked particularly
dangerous, hitting 2-of-3 from down
town and helping motivate and drive her
team forward, and her absence did not
help the Brains.
UCLA did again narrow the gap, but
it was too little too late, and Stanford
was not going to let the lead slip away
again. Though the Brains pressed Or
range hard, she paid them back, break
ing through and making crucial steals
on defense even when the momentum
seemed to be swinging back in UCLAs
favor.
As time wore down, a fired up Ruef
helped seal the result for both her team
and herself. With just 20 seconds re
maining, she grabbed her 10th board
and was fouled in the process, sending
her to the line to score her ninth and
10th points, sealing her double-double
performance.
Stanford now returns to The Farm
to face the Oregon schools this weekend,
first the Beavers on Friday night and
then the Ducks on Sunday. The contest
against Oregon will be Senior Night for
Tinkle and Ruef, but both hope to play
on home court during the first and sec
ond rounds of the NCAA Tournament in
March.

Junior Chiney Ogwumike (left) recorded her record-setting 20th doubledouble
of the season over the weekend to help lead No. 4 Stanford past
USC and UCLA on the road. Stanford has now won 10 straight games.
Over Presidents' Day weekend, the
Stanford women's basketball swept both
Los Angeles schools on the road, first de
feating USC 79-55 on Friday night and
then earning a 68-57 victory over UCLA
on Sunday.

The wins ensured that the No. 4 Car
dinal (24-2, 13-1 Pac-12) would stay tied
for top spot in the Pac-12 Conference with
No. 6 Berkeley (23-2,13-1), which also de
feated both Southern Californian schools
this past weekend.
The Trojans (8-17, 5-9) meanwhile
dropped to eighth place in the table, and
the No. 15 Brains (19-6,10-4) look to have
lost their chance to return to the head of
the pack. With just four games remaining
for each team in the regular season,
UCLA would need both Stanford and
California to lose three games and newly
third-placed Washington to also slip up at
least once.
On Friday, junior forward Chiney Og
wumike stood out for the Card, grabbing
her record setting 20th double-double of
the season, with 26 points and 15 re
bounds. Joining Ogwumike in double fig
ures, senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
recorded her second double-double of the
season with 17 points and 11 rebounds,
senior forward Mikaela Ruef scored 12
points and sophomore guard Amber Or
range netted 10 points. Ruef also set a

ping the 11 she made against Arizona a
week ago.
Trojan sophomore forward Alexyz
Yaioletma and junior forward Cassie
Harberts netted double-figure points,
with 13 and 14, respectively. But crucial
ly for the Cardinal, sophomore guard
Ariya Crook, who alongside Harberts is
the only other USC player with a dou
ble-figure season scoring average, hit
just six points.
Ogwumike again put in another
strong performance on Sunday, hitting
26 points to keep her record of double
figure scoring in every game this season
still alive. However, Ruef also continued
her strong ran of form, grabbing her
second career double-double, with 10
points and 10 rebounds.
Junior forward Joslyn Tinkle was
just shy of joining Ruef, too, hitting 10
points and grabbing nine rebounds.
Among the guards, sophomore Amber
Orrange might not have made double
figures in any one category, but her nine
points, seven assists, six rebounds and
five steals show how much her all
around play contributed to Stanford's
win.
The biggest three scoring threats to
the Cardinal from UCLA before the
game looked likely to be senior forward
Alyssia Brewer, redshirt junior forward
Atonye Nyingifa and senior guard/for
ward Markel Walker, all with double-fig
ure point averages. True to form,
Nyingifa, Brewer and Walker hit 12,10
and 10 points, respectively.
UCLA fell behind by nine points af
ter a Stanford 9-2 run midway through
first half but clawed that back to within
two points after increasing the pressure
on the Card and preventing the visiting
team from comfortably settling into its
lead. When Stanford freshman forward
Tess Picknell was called for a flagrant

foul two minutes before the break, it
looked like the momentum had com
pletely turned.
However, the Cardinal opened the
lead back out to five before halftime,
and returning from the break, it
stretched further ahead to earn 16
points of breathing space with ten min
utes left in the game.
UCLA struggled when freshman
guard Kari Korver had to leave the con
test after picking up a cut on her right
cheek when she tried to defend Ogwu
mike. Korver had looked particularly
dangerous, hitting 2-of-3 from down
town and helping motivate and drive her
team forward, and her absence did not
help the Brains.
UCLA did again narrow the gap, but
it was too little too late, and Stanford
was not going to let the lead slip away
again. Though the Brains pressed Or
range hard, she paid them back, break
ing through and making crucial steals
on defense even when the momentum
seemed to be swinging back in UCLAs
favor.
As time wore down, a fired up Ruef
helped seal the result for both her team
and herself. With just 20 seconds re
maining, she grabbed her 10th board
and was fouled in the process, sending
her to the line to score her ninth and
10th points, sealing her double-double
performance.
Stanford now returns to The Farm
to face the Oregon schools this weekend,
first the Beavers on Friday night and
then the Ducks on Sunday. The contest
against Oregon will be Senior Night for
Tinkle and Ruef, but both hope to play
on home court during the first and sec
