# Powell shines in loss

### DAVID BRADFORD STAFF WRITER 
UCLA rode into Maples Pavil
ion on Saturday afternoon with
the Pac-12's highest scoring of
fense, and Stanford's defense was
barely even a speed bump in the
88-80 loss.
Freshman point guard
Shabazz Muhammad, the confer
ence's third-leading scorer, fin
ished with a game high 25 points
on 9-of-14 shooting for the Bruins.
The freshman standout made it

clear that he has special, game
changing talent while Stanford's
late game floundering made it ap
parent that it still missing that
type of player.
With 1:52 left and the game
still within reach, Muhammad
converted a four-point play to
stretch the lead to eight. He fin
ished a layup on the next posses
sion to essentially ice the game,

and Stanford was left yet again to
mull over a close loss to a quality
opponent.
"He made big shots at big
times, and that's what a big-time
player is able to do," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
Much of the game went ac
cording to UCLAIs script. The
Brains shot 54.4 percent from the
field while playing at the fast pace
they prefer. None of their top
players were held under control
either.

2/16, Maples Pavillion

Junior Dwight Powell (right) scored 22 points, but it was not enough as Stanford fell to UCLA 88-80
Saturday at Maples Pavilion. Freshman phenom Shabazz Muhammad led UCLA with 25 points.
The Bruins' second-lead
ing scorer on the season,
freshman guard Jordan
Adams, finished with 20
points on 7-of-9 shooting.
Third-leading scorer fresh
man guard Kyle Anderson
netted 18 to go along with 13
rebounds.
Dawkins said after the game
that he had not seen UCLA
shoot that well all season.
"I'm not disappointed in
my team or their effort one
bit, he said. "I just think we
ran across a team that had a
buzzsaw mentality in terms of
shooting the basketball."
Senior point guard Larry
Drew II created a lot of prob
lems for the Stanford defense
as well, especially with high ball
screens that ended with him
blowing by a Cardinal big man.
Drew finished with seven as
sists, almost equaling Stan
ford's total of nine for the game.
Despite scoring 80 points,
Stanford had to work a lot
harder to keep pace. The Card
took 78 shots in the game (mak
ing only 30 of them) compared
to 57 by UCLA.
"We still managed to claw,
fight to get 80, so then it just
becomes a matter of 'can you

stop somebody,' and we just
didn't make the stops tonight,"
Dawkins said.
Still, Stanford kept the
game close until the final min
utes, trailing by as little as one
with just over six minutes left.
There were several big
time performances by Stan
ford players that kept the Bru
ins within reach. The efficiency
was not there though, and nei
ther were late-game heroics.
Junior forward Dwight
Powell had 22 points, eight re
bounds, four assists, a block
and a steal. Junior forward
Josh Huestis had a double
double his fourth in the past
five gamesâ€”with 11 points
and 12 rebounds.
Stanford's starting guard
tandem surpassed their scoring
averages. Junior Aaron Bright
had 19 points while sophomore
Chasson Randle had 17.
But every Stanford player
shot under 50 percent, except
for Bright, who was 8-of-16.
The Cardinal futility from be
hind the arc, where it shot 5-23,
did most of the damage in
dragging those percentages
down. The reliance on and the
inability to make three-point
shots also allowed UCLA to
grab long rebounds and push
the tempo.
The Cardinal's 18 offensive
rebounds, nine of which came
from Huestis, made up for a lot
of those misses.

UCLA led by as many as
10 early on, but despite sitting
Huestis down for most of the
first half after he picked up his
second foul, the Cardinal found
itself within reach at 38-43 go
ing into the half.
With Stanford still down by
five points midway through
the second half, Bright slashed
to the rim and swirled in a re
verse layup. After a rare de
fensive stop, Bright hurried
the ball down the court, pulled
up a few feet behind the arc
and swished a three-pointer to
tie the game.
UCLA called an immediate
timeout to stem the momen
tum and proceeded to score on
the next play.
A few minutes later, a lead
ing pass from Bright set up a
strong layup by senior for
ward Andy Brown in transi
tion that cut the deficit to 65-
66. Muhammad coolly an
swered with a mid-range jump
shot, and after an empty pos
session from Stanford, the
Bruins scored again to create
some breathing room.
Soon thereafter, Muham
mad watched from the ground
as his three-pointer splashed
through the net and the sound
of the referee's whistle rang
through the ah:
