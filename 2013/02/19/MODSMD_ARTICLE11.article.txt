UCLA rode into Maples Pavil
ion on Saturday afternoon with
the Pac-12's highest scoring of
fense, and Stanford's defense was
barely even a speed bump in the
88-80 loss.
Freshman point guard
Shabazz Muhammad, the confer
ence's third-leading scorer, fin
ished with a game high 25 points
on 9-of-14 shooting for the Bruins.
The freshman standout made it

clear that he has special, game
changing talent while Stanford's
late game floundering made it ap
parent that it still missing that
type of player.
With 1:52 left and the game
still within reach, Muhammad
converted a four-point play to
stretch the lead to eight. He fin
ished a layup on the next posses
sion to essentially ice the game,

and Stanford was left yet again to
mull over a close loss to a quality
opponent.
"He made big shots at big
times, and that's what a big-time
player is able to do," said head
coach Johnny Dawkins.
Much of the game went ac
cording to UCLAIs script. The
Brains shot 54.4 percent from the
field while playing at the fast pace
they prefer. None of their top
players were held under control
either.
