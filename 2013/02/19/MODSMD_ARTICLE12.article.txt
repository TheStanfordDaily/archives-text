## Cardinal dominates Nike Invitational 
### DAVID COHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford softball team sent
an emphatic message with its im
pressive performance at the Stan
ford Nike Invitational: the Cardi
nal will be a contender in the Pae
-12 this year.
Outscoring its opponents by a
combined 44-0 margin, the No. 20
Cardinal won all five of its games
during the three-day invitational,
improving to 10-2 on the season. Al
though the invitational lacked the

number of nationally ranked oppo
nents that the Card faced during its
last tournament, the Kajikawa Clas
sic, Stanford's all-around domina
tion was a boost to its resume.
In the pitching circle, senior
Teagan Gerhart, freshman Kelsey
Stevens and sophomore Nyree
White combined to give up only

twelve hits during the entire tour
nament. At the invitational, Ger
hart continued to build off of her
NFCA Second Team All-West Re
gion campaign from a year ago.
The senior from Norco, Calif, shut
down CSU-Bakersfield twice on
consecutive days, scattering a total
of seven hits over the course of 9
1/3 scoreless innings.
While Gerhart's two victories
were notable, the Nike Invitational
also marked the definitive arrival
of Stevens. The Albuquerque,
N.M., product had a perfect game

through 41/3 innings in the opener
against CSU Northridge on Friday
afternoon, ultimately finishing with
a two-hit shutout.
"It's a tough thing to do"
Stephens said on throwing a per
fect game. "No matter how good
you pitch, they're always going to
get the bat on the ba11... lam just
glad I was able to hold them off for
that long."
Stevens followed up that outing
with one-hit shutouts against CSU-

Northridge and UC-Davis. In all, Stevens al
lowed only four hits in 16 and 2/3 innings this
weekend, while striking out 20 and lowering
her ERA to 1.50. Stevens' ability to mix her
off-speed pitches with a blazing fastball bodes
well for Stanford when it enters the heart of
Pac-12 play in late March.
In establishing itself as the class of the
Nike Invitational, the Cardinal also dominat
ed opposing pitching, hitting an impressive
.342 at the plate. The Card's patience in the
box was evident, as Stanford was able to get
ahead in a number of counts and prolong at
bats by managing to foul off some difficult
pitches. In turn, the Cardinal converted these
opportunities into favorable pitches to hit, as
well as base runners in the form of 22 walks
during the three-day tournament.
Sophomore Cassandra Roulund and
freshman Kayla Bonstrom highlighted the of
fensive display for Stanford. An all Pac-12
Freshman Team Honorable Mention selection
in 2012, Roulund hit .583 in the four games
while driving in nine runs. In particular, her
triples in the first and fourth innings of Satur
day night's contest against CSU-Bakersfield
helped propel her team to a 12-0, five-inning
mercy rule rout of the Roadrunners.

Bonstrom, the freshman from Tucson,
Ariz., also had a solid tournament for the
Cardinal, hitting .455 with seven RBI in split
ting time between designated player and first
base. Her one-out, two-RBI double in the
fifth inning to left field helped break open
what had been a relatively close contest be
tween Stanford and CSU-Northridge on Sat
urday morning. After her double made the
score 5-0, the Cardinal added three more
runs to end game early with an 8-0 mercy
rule victory.
In the field, the Cardinal played almost
flawlessly, committing only one error in five
games. Hanna Winter, a sophomore from Ca
marillo, Calif., and a first team All Pac-12 se
lection as a true freshman, capped off the de
fensive effort on Sunday afternoon with a
highlight-worthy full extension vertical leap
at third to rob UC-Davis shortstop Christa
Costello of a sure base-hit. Up in the press
box, a few amazed members of the Stanford
Athletics Department serenaded Winter with
the Sports Center Top 10 music "duh nuh
nuh, duh nuh-nuh."
The Cardinal is next in action Friday at
the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic in Cathe
dral City, Calif. Stanford will face two ranked
opponents in its five-game slate: No. 13 Geor
gia to open the Classic Friday afternoon and
No. 25 Florida State on Sunday morning.

STANFORD 8
2/17, Smith Family Stadium
Northridge and UC-Davis. In all, Stevens al
lowed only four hits in 16 and 2/3 innings this
weekend, while striking out 20 and lowering
her ERA to 1.50. Stevens' ability to mix her
off-speed pitches with a blazing fastball bodes
well for Stanford when it enters the heart of
Pac-12 play in late March.
In establishing itself as the class of the
Nike Invitational, the Cardinal also dominat
ed opposing pitching, hitting an impressive
.342 at the plate. The Card's patience in the
box was evident, as Stanford was able to get
ahead in a number of counts and prolong at
bats by managing to foul off some difficult
pitches. In turn, the Cardinal converted these
opportunities into favorable pitches to hit, as
well as base runners in the form of 22 walks
during the three-day tournament.
Sophomore Cassandra Roulund and
freshman Kayla Bonstrom highlighted the of
fensive display for Stanford. An all Pac-12
Freshman Team Honorable Mention selection
in 2012, Roulund hit .583 in the four games
while driving in nine runs. In particular, her
triples in the first and fourth innings of Satur
day night's contest against CSU-Bakersfield
helped propel her team to a 12-0, five-inning
mercy rule rout of the Roadrunners.

Bonstrom, the freshman from Tucson,
Ariz., also had a solid tournament for the
Cardinal, hitting .455 with seven RBI in split
ting time between designated player and first
base. Her one-out, two-RBI double in the
fifth inning to left field helped break open
what had been a relatively close contest be
tween Stanford and CSU-Northridge on Sat
urday morning. After her double made the
score 5-0, the Cardinal added three more
runs to end game early with an 8-0 mercy
rule victory.
In the field, the Cardinal played almost
flawlessly, committing only one error in five
games. Hanna Winter, a sophomore from Ca
marillo, Calif., and a first team All Pac-12 se
lection as a true freshman, capped off the de
fensive effort on Sunday afternoon with a
highlight-worthy full extension vertical leap
at third to rob UC-Davis shortstop Christa
Costello of a sure base-hit. Up in the press
box, a few amazed members of the Stanford
Athletics Department serenaded Winter with
the Sports Center Top 10 music "duh nuh
nuh, duh nuh-nuh."
The Cardinal is next in action Friday at
the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic in Cathe
dral City, Calif. Stanford will face two ranked
opponents in its five-game slate: No. 13 Geor
gia to open the Classic Friday afternoon and
No. 25 Florida State on Sunday morning.
