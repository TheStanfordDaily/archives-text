## Cardinal dominates Nike Invitational 
### DAVID COHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford softball team sent
an emphatic message with its im
pressive performance at the Stan
ford Nike Invitational: the Cardi
nal will be a contender in the Pae
-12 this year.
Outscoring its opponents by a
combined 44-0 margin, the No. 20
Cardinal won all five of its games
during the three-day invitational,
improving to 10-2 on the season. Al
though the invitational lacked the

number of nationally ranked oppo
nents that the Card faced during its
last tournament, the Kajikawa Clas
sic, Stanford's all-around domina
tion was a boost to its resume.
In the pitching circle, senior
Teagan Gerhart, freshman Kelsey
Stevens and sophomore Nyree
White combined to give up only

twelve hits during the entire tour
nament. At the invitational, Ger
hart continued to build off of her
NFCA Second Team All-West Re
gion campaign from a year ago.
The senior from Norco, Calif, shut
down CSU-Bakersfield twice on
consecutive days, scattering a total
of seven hits over the course of 9
1/3 scoreless innings.
While Gerhart's two victories
were notable, the Nike Invitational
also marked the definitive arrival
of Stevens. The Albuquerque,
N.M., product had a perfect game

through 41/3 innings in the opener
against CSU Northridge on Friday
afternoon, ultimately finishing with
a two-hit shutout.
"It's a tough thing to do"
Stephens said on throwing a per
fect game. "No matter how good
you pitch, they're always going to
get the bat on the ba11... lam just
glad I was able to hold them off for
that long."
Stevens followed up that outing
with one-hit shutouts against CSU-
