## OP-ED The 						Latino Electorate: A Bonfire for our Vanities? 
### SALVADOR E. PÉREZ (B.A '07 J.D.'14) is a former congressional aide 
Deficits imperil social contacts
and safety nets. Our income
distribution could be confused
for that of a sub-Saharan kleptocracy.
Congress, beset by virulent polariza
tion and gridlock, has devolved from a
forum for national discourse into an
antebellum arena for bloodsport be
tween ideological tribes. Reasonable
people, feeling rightly victimized by
our contemporary politics, disengage
and cede ground to enraged radicals.
So what is the path forward?
Many experts have put forth a menu
of reforms in the areas of campaign fi
nance, election administration and
legislative procedure. Other commen
tators seem optimistic that our pres
ent is so unsustainable that the fever
is bound to break somehow.
I would like to posit another, per
haps surprising, alternative (or com
plement). A new national consensus
of affirmation and regeneration a
consensus that will reshape our politi
cal and economic institutions —will
necessarily surface as a result of the
growing importance and the prefer
ences of the Latino electorate.
We need only to look to California
to see its impact. Since the passage of
Proposition 187 passage (an anti-im
migrant measure that received the
full-throated support of then-Gover
nor Pete Wilson and the Republican
party) in 1994, not a single Republican
has been elected to statewide
office except Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Latinos also gave President Obama
the margin of victory in Virginia, Col
orado and Nevada. Today, in Califor
nia, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Col
orado, Georgia, New Mexico and Ne
vada, the number of potential Latino
voters (those eligible but unregis
tered) is greater than the margin of
victory—that's 169 electoral votes.
And if Latinos' loyalty to the Demo
cratic party continues, Arizona
and Texas could turn blue relatively
soon.
In terms of preferences, a person
al anecdote comes to mind. My par
ents naturalized in the fall of 2007,
joining the ranks of dozens of aunts,
uncles and family friends who have re
cently achieved their citizenship.
Then, on Election Day 2008, came
a moment I had long suspected
would manifest itself in some way:
many of these new citizens voted for
both candidate Obama and Californi
a's Proposition 8 endorsing greater
public investment while expressing a
measure of social conservatism.
It was this event that crystallized
the following realizations: (1) Latinos
cannot be categorized neatly into ei
ther party and (2) the hybrid nature of
Latino values, coupled with our grow
ing national influence, has the poten-

tial to remake our national polity.
But what are our values exactly,
and how do they bridge the nation's
divide? Acknowledging the inherent
crudeness of an endeavor to describe
the views of 51 million people, here is
my best attempt:
We believe that poverty in the
United States is just as much a func
tion of persistent injustice as it is of
mores and culture. We believe in an
America whose foundations lie in the
dignity of duty, kinship and moral or
der not in personal liberation. We
want to live in a society that restores
the joy of work, the value of human
association and a sense of place and
history; too much nowadays is dispos
able.
We oppose excessive concentra
tions of wealth and power. We reject
the notion that boundless wealth is
the path to human fulfillment. We
stand for self-reliance, work that
is meaningful and for narrowing the
chasms between rich and poor. We
doubt our democratic values can
withstand the ongoing transforma
tion of class into caste.
In addition, we believe both the
Left and the Right have done great
disservices to our nation. The Left
speaks the language of community but
has in reality produced a libertarian
culture obsessed with choice. In
its quest to free people from any so
cial responsibilities, it has also weak
ened important human bonds. It has
perpetuated a deep and abiding hate
of tradition and received wisdom. It
has enabled the growth of heartless
narcissism and self-gratification
inclinations alien to the impulse most
responsible for human triumph: sac
rifice.
In turn, the Right has evangelized
a free-market ideology that promised
a pluralistic and decentralized econo
my but delivered a centralized finan
cial monoculture that requires con
siderable government oversight. On
social issues, too, the Right has pre
ferred form over substance, exhibit
ing a disturbing insistence that lov
ing, committed relationships
and families come in a single variety.
What does this all portend? Our
sheer size and attachment to commu
nitarian as well as aspirational
and entrepreneurial values points to a
new future, perhaps serving as anti
dote to our current morass —an
elixir for our paralysis that will re
store a balance between rights and
responsibilities. Ultimately, however,
the Latino electorate will have to re
sist the gravitational pull of pre-es
tablished political categories.

the following realizations: (1) Latinos
cannot be categorized neatly into ei
ther party and (2) the hybrid nature of
Latino values, coupled with our grow
ing national influence, has the poten-

tial to remake our national polity.
But what are our values exactly,
and how do they bridge the nation's
divide? Acknowledging the inherent
crudeness of an endeavor to describe
the views of 51 million people, here is
my best attempt:
We believe that poverty in the
United States is just as much a func
tion of persistent injustice as it is of
mores and culture. We believe in an
America whose foundations lie in the
dignity of duty, kinship and moral or
der not in personal liberation. We
want to live in a society that restores
the joy of work, the value of human
association and a sense of place and
history; too much nowadays is dispos
able.
We oppose excessive concentra
tions of wealth and power. We reject
the notion that boundless wealth is
the path to human fulfillment. We
stand for self-reliance, work that
is meaningful and for narrowing the
chasms between rich and poor. We
doubt our democratic values can
withstand the ongoing transforma
tion of class into caste.
In addition, we believe both the
Left and the Right have done great
disservices to our nation. The Left
speaks the language of community but
has in reality produced a libertarian
culture obsessed with choice. In
its quest to free people from any so
cial responsibilities, it has also weak
ened important human bonds. It has
perpetuated a deep and abiding hate
of tradition and received wisdom. It
has enabled the growth of heartless
narcissism and self-gratification
inclinations alien to the impulse most
responsible for human triumph: sac
rifice.
In turn, the Right has evangelized
a free-market ideology that promised
a pluralistic and decentralized econo
my but delivered a centralized finan
cial monoculture that requires con
siderable government oversight. On
social issues, too, the Right has pre
ferred form over substance, exhibit
ing a disturbing insistence that lov
ing, committed relationships
and families come in a single variety.
What does this all portend? Our
sheer size and attachment to commu
nitarian as well as aspirational
and entrepreneurial values points to a
new future, perhaps serving as anti
dote to our current morass —an
elixir for our paralysis that will re
store a balance between rights and
responsibilities. Ultimately, however,
the Latino electorate will have to re
sist the gravitational pull of pre-es
tablished political categories.
