# Humility
## 
### Taylor Brady 
There's a humility that comes
from counting out five dollars
and sixty-four cents in loose
change on the gas station counter. I
was on the way to the airport Friday
to pick up a friend who had taken a
quarter off from Stanford. That af
ternoon he asked for a ride from
SFO to campus. I immediately re
sponded, "You got it."
Three hours later, I was fretting
over whether or not I would have
enough gas just to get there and
back. I had already promised anoth
er friend that I would take her shop
ping at 5:15, and I supposed that
that trip alone was bound to exhaust
most of the remaining two gallons in
my gas tank. But I had to go, so I
grabbed the mug of coins on my
desk, put on another sweater and
got in the car.
Prior to leaving, I didn't know
how much money was in that mug. I
doubted that it was enough for even
two gallons. I was right.
"Just remember that next time, I
won't take all those pennies unless
they're rolled." The attendant looks
at me, knowingly.
"Well, I appreciate you accepting
it this time," I replied, meeting his
eye and dipping out into the cold.
I used to be ashamed of the
things that I couldn't afford. When
my friends would ask me out to din
ner on a Friday afternoon, I'd try to
come up with a seemingly valid ex
cuse not to join them. That became
more difficult when it happened
week after week. Eventually, people
lost interest in eating Friday dinner
in the dining hall or scavenging left
overs from my house's fridge.
Three and a half gallons in the tank.
Taking the 101, it's 24.4 miles from
Stanford to SFO. My car gets 25 to
the gallon.
From Stanford to my hometown,

it's 850 or so miles. I've made this
fourteen-hour marathon across the
desert five times, pedometer ticking
from dawn to twilight. I've slept in
gas station parking lots because I
only got four hours of sleep the pre
ceding night. When I parcel out my
quarters on the counter there, the
station attendant says, "I watched
you sleeping out there to make sure
you weren't dead." She holds my
eyes when I thank her and slides an
energy drink that I didn't pay for
across the counter. When the wind
scours across a dune's windward
arch, just at the edge of the leeward
slope, smooth grains of sand faithful
ly leap into the abyss. Plummet. It
seems like only the wind carries on.
I don't want home to trail behind
me like shifting spheres of sand,
shipwrecked at the Center of the
Desert, the halfway point home. I've
sat on mesas there and just watched
the sun set west. My self, I believe,
is neither here nor at home. It's
camped in a desert caravan, the
watch over the first fire at night.
"I had to realize," said my friend,
"that nobody owed me anything. It's
a fight every day. Like training. You
think coaches let a person miss a
day of practice?"
"No," I said.
"You go home," he continued,
"and see how it could be and it
scares you. At first when I got in
jured, I just sucked it up, kept fight
ing harder. Then it happened again,
but I still had a combative attitude.
Finally, it broke again and I started
to lose it. I was taking a part-time
and wondering, 'What am I doing
with myself? I have so much poten
tial and I'm working here?"'
We carry our families' and our
friends' hopes, ambitions and pain
from home. Stanford doesn't hurt,
though, not the same way. At its best

it can be like an Ibuprofen pill. At its
worst, you wake up from its effects
to realize that you didn't get rid of
the ache pulsing in the east, but ig
nored it worsening, quickening. You
strive to wear the totems of the class
that you are compelled to be here,
encouraged to enter. To blow your
work on brands or swag sweaters.
Most agonizing of all is when you re
turn home, corrupted, and are chid
ed and turned away. The nest re
jects you like a baby bird contami
nated by contact with an alien
species.
Native bacteria rides in the vec
tor of your gut. Chewing the sterile
food makes you sick. It makes you
feel strange and small. But your im
munity is strong. You can eat alien
ation, swallow bitterness like the
bad disease that it is and eliminate it
with white blood cells selected for
strength. You recall what brought
you peace before you entered the
anthill.
I began reading, again, "Journey
to the West." At one point, a fisher
man and a woodcutter banter about
what makes a tranquil existence at
home so fantastic:

"I'm pleased to keep compa
ny with egrets and gulls./
I've no plans for fame and
fortune in my heart...
... Tranquil's the green wa
ter at the head of my boat./
Content, I'm not seeking the
three minister's seat."
Recently, I've rediscovered an
entire life in ratty clothes and fifty
cent mugs of coffee. I want the
peace of a stacks cubby on Friday
night and the bite of hunger, overac
tive stomach acid, as I fall asleep on
Saturday. We stopped at In' N' Out
in Mountain View and when my
friend asked what I wanted, I re
sponded.
"Just a cheeseburger."
"How about something to
drink?" he encouraged.
"Alright, a chocolate shake."
"Fries?"
"I'll eat some if you order them."
Paying me back for gas money,
he asked, "Five or ten?"
"Whatever."
He slipped ten across the counter.
There is some sand from home
on your jacket. There is somebody
looking out for you at the Palm

Springs gas station. Your friend
wants a ride to the grocery store or
from the airport. They want to know
you and listen to the flickering
speakers in your car. You don't have
to feel ashamed because you pinch
dirty pennies to buy 1.3 gallons of
gas. You can feel rich with an orange
in your hands. Never forget: you
don't need money to be happy.
Paint with your friends on a
Monday. They just want to be with
you. Thank her when she slides her
card across the counter. Pay her
back when the paycheck comes
Tuesday. Only buy toothpaste and
hit the books again. Every day is a
fight here. Nobody owes you any
thing. But you are worth something.
Here's my challenge for the
week. Think about where home is.
I'd wager that your mind is not en
tirely here so stop telling yourself
that it is. Look candidly at your
wounds and accept them. Never for
get where you came from.

Where is home to you? What have
you struggled with at Stanford?

is neither here nor at home. It's
camped in a desert caravan, the
watch over the first fire at night.
"I had to realize," said my friend,
"that nobody owed me anything. It's
a fight every day. Like training. You
think coaches let a person miss a
day of practice?"
"No," I said.
"You go home," he continued,
"and see how it could be and it
scares you. At first when I got in
jured, I just sucked it up, kept fight
ing harder. Then it happened again,
but I still had a combative attitude.
Finally, it broke again and I started
to lose it. I was taking a part-time
and wondering, 'What am I doing
with myself? I have so much poten
tial and I'm working here?"'
We carry our families' and our
friends' hopes, ambitions and pain
from home. Stanford doesn't hurt,
though, not the same way. At its best

it can be like an Ibuprofen pill. At its
worst, you wake up from its effects
to realize that you didn't get rid of
the ache pulsing in the east, but ig
nored it worsening, quickening. You
strive to wear the totems of the class
that you are compelled to be here,
encouraged to enter. To blow your
work on brands or swag sweaters.
Most agonizing of all is when you re
turn home, corrupted, and are chid
ed and turned away. The nest re
jects you like a baby bird contami
nated by contact with an alien
species.
Native bacteria rides in the vec
tor of your gut. Chewing the sterile
food makes you sick. It makes you
feel strange and small. But your im
munity is strong. You can eat alien
ation, swallow bitterness like the
bad disease that it is and eliminate it
with white blood cells selected for
strength. You recall what brought
you peace before you entered the
anthill.
I began reading, again, "Journey
to the West." At one point, a fisher
man and a woodcutter banter about
what makes a tranquil existence at
home so fantastic:

"I'm pleased to keep compa
ny with egrets and gulls./
I've no plans for fame and
fortune in my heart...
... Tranquil's the green wa
ter at the head of my boat./
Content, I'm not seeking the
three minister's seat."
Recently, I've rediscovered an
entire life in ratty clothes and fifty
cent mugs of coffee. I want the
peace of a stacks cubby on Friday
night and the bite of hunger, overac
tive stomach acid, as I fall asleep on
Saturday. We stopped at In' N' Out
in Mountain View and when my
friend asked what I wanted, I re
sponded.
"Just a cheeseburger."
"How about something to
drink?" he encouraged.
"Alright, a chocolate shake."
"Fries?"
"I'll eat some if you order them."
Paying me back for gas money,
he asked, "Five or ten?"
"Whatever."
He slipped ten across the counter.
There is some sand from home
on your jacket. There is somebody
looking out for you at the Palm

Springs gas station. Your friend
wants a ride to the grocery store or
from the airport. They want to know
you and listen to the flickering
speakers in your car. You don't have
to feel ashamed because you pinch
dirty pennies to buy 1.3 gallons of
gas. You can feel rich with an orange
in your hands. Never forget: you
don't need money to be happy.
Paint with your friends on a
Monday. They just want to be with
you. Thank her when she slides her
card across the counter. Pay her
back when the paycheck comes
Tuesday. Only buy toothpaste and
hit the books again. Every day is a
fight here. Nobody owes you any
thing. But you are worth something.
Here's my challenge for the
week. Think about where home is.
I'd wager that your mind is not en
tirely here so stop telling yourself
that it is. Look candidly at your
wounds and accept them. Never for
get where you came from.

Where is home to you? What have
you struggled with at Stanford?

There's a humility that comes
from counting out five dollars
and sixty-four cents in loose
change on the gas station counter. I
was on the way to the airport Friday
to pick up a friend who had taken a
quarter off from Stanford. That af
ternoon he asked for a ride from
SFO to campus. I immediately re
sponded, "You got it."
Three hours later, I was fretting
over whether or not I would have
enough gas just to get there and
back. I had already promised anoth
er friend that I would take her shop
ping at 5:15, and I supposed that
that trip alone was bound to exhaust
most of the remaining two gallons in
my gas tank. But I had to go, so I
grabbed the mug of coins on my
desk, put on another sweater and
got in the car.
Prior to leaving, I didn't know
how much money was in that mug. I
doubted that it was enough for even
two gallons. I was right.
"Just remember that next time, I
won't take all those pennies unless
they're rolled." The attendant looks
at me, knowingly.
"Well, I appreciate you accepting
it this time," I replied, meeting his
eye and dipping out into the cold.
I used to be ashamed of the
things that I couldn't afford. When
my friends would ask me out to din
ner on a Friday afternoon, I'd try to
come up with a seemingly valid ex
cuse not to join them. That became
more difficult when it happened
week after week. Eventually, people
lost interest in eating Friday dinner
in the dining hall or scavenging left
overs from my house's fridge.
Three and a half gallons in the tank.
Taking the 101, it's 24.4 miles from
Stanford to SFO. My car gets 25 to
the gallon.
From Stanford to my hometown,

it's 850 or so miles. I've made this
fourteen-hour marathon across the
desert five times, pedometer ticking
from dawn to twilight. I've slept in
gas station parking lots because I
only got four hours of sleep the pre
ceding night. When I parcel out my
quarters on the counter there, the
station attendant says, "I watched
you sleeping out there to make sure
you weren't dead." She holds my
eyes when I thank her and slides an
energy drink that I didn't pay for
across the counter. When the wind
scours across a dune's windward
arch, just at the edge of the leeward
slope, smooth grains of sand faithful
ly leap into the abyss. Plummet. It
seems like only the wind carries on.
I don't want home to trail behind
me like shifting spheres of sand,
shipwrecked at the Center of the
Desert, the halfway point home. I've
sat on mesas there and just watched
the sun set west. My self, I believe,
is neither here nor at home. It's
camped in a desert caravan, the
watch over the first fire at night.
