# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Cape Town dreaming 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
When I first learned to talk,
my father to the chagrin
of his grandmother
would have me say, "My name is
Rristian Davis Bailey, I own a man
sion and a yacht."
I didn't and we didn't, but yester
day— when I spent the day on
Clifton Beach I imagined I did.
Clifton is the part of Cape Town I
contrasted to the informal settle
ments (read: slums) of Khayelitsha
two weeks ago as representative of
what makes South Africa the most
unequal country in the world.
Having seen million-dollar beach
houses, luxury cars and yachts
and fully aware of why they are so
troubling in the context of the rest of
South Africa all I wanted was to
one day have a beach house in that
very location.
I drifted off: imagining the possi
bility of looking out over the glass
edges of my patio into the endless
sea, of smelling the salty air and hear
the pounding of the waves as I slept in
my bungalow, Mercedes-Benz
parked in the gated lot on my roof.
I felt like I wanted to forget about
the struggles for liberation that I'm oth
erwise sure I'd like to commit my life to.
It was a deeply individualistic
impulse, yet I did not find it repug
nant. And I still don't find it even
just troubling.
I wonder (and worry) if I am be
ing too idealistic in my apparent inter
ests (embedding myself with 'the peo
ple,' forgoing the life of relatively high
wealth and luxury I could have —the
life I have to go out of my way not to
have given how easy a Stanford ed-

ucation makes it to access).
Will I look back at my writing and
my work and laugh at what I thought
in six months? A year? 10 years?
Might I become a traitor unto my
current self and repress the beliefs
and values of 21-year-old Kristian for
some later realities of life I cannot
currently envision?
Will I become conservative?
To this last question: I doubt it; to
the others, I sincerely hope not.
Some may find fault with the poles
I have set up here: my implication
may seem to be that being wealthy
would make me into a worse person.
I caution that I am not making as
sumptions or judgments of other peo
ple, their wealth and their commit
ment to social justice I am refer
ring solely to myself, based on my
evaluation of myself and what consti
tutes being a "good person" for me.
At this juncture in my Stanford
career as I begin to think about
employment and education paths
past senior year I also think more
about the potential economic paths I
might take.
For the past nine years of my life,
I have obtained my education
through very significant financial aid.
I now start to approach a period
where I will become economically in
dependent and could one day finance
a college tuition directly out of my
own pocket.
I know based on watching the
paths of graduates ahead of me
that I could obtain a job earning more
money than my family currently
does. "Upward mobility" is indeed
one of the oft-touted effects of a col-

lege education.
Having spent most of my self-con
scious life always aware that I had
"less than" most of the people and
families around me, it is scary to
imagine a (near) future where I could
have "more than" others.
Getting a beach house in South
Africa does not directly Mow from
having enough money to own one, but
it falls in line with the notion of having
significantly more than I am used to
and more than eveiyday people.
I imagine the residents of Clifton
need to significantly detach them
selves from the inequalities of their
country in order to enjoy their pos
sessions or they must have a pro
found disconnect from, and igno
rance of, reality.
Even in imagining a future, my
made-up, beach-house-and-Benz
owning conscience cannot remove it
self from the structural inequality in
which it is implicated.
As more and more options and
opportunities becomes available to
me in my Stanford experience, I see
increasingly more glimpses of what
my life could be.
While I am aware that "It's not
what you have; it's what you do with
it," having seen such tempting and
extravagant wealth today, I fear that
I could do the wrong things, make
the wrong decisions.
I do not think I will fail myself,
but as I have written, it is my re
sponse to such a situation as yester
day's that scares me.
