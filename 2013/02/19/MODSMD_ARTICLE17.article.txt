# Stanford splits in SoCal road trip
## 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's volleyball team,
fresh off an impressive sweep of UC-San
Diego, hit the road this past weekend to face
two very tough teams: No. 8 Cal State North
ridge and No. 4 Long Beach State. It was
certainly a tale of two matches, as the Cardi
nal rallied past the Matadors on Friday be
fore being overpowered by the 49ers in three
sets on Saturday.

Stanford (9-5, 6-5 MPSF) entered its
matchup with Northridge (7-5,5-5) just 1-3 in
road matchups this year and thus was look
ing to make a resounding statement in the
first game of a tough road trip.
Neither team was able to take a distinct
advantage over the other in the first set,
trading points back and forth. The Cardinal
held a slight 21-20 lead, but back-to-back er
rors by Stanford gave Northridge a lead it
did not relinquish, as it took the first set 25-
22.
The second set, however, was all Stanford,
as the Cardinal offense was absolutely domi

nant. Stanford hit .778 in the set, led by jun
ior outside hitter Brian Cook, who posted
eight of his 21 kills in the second as the Car
dinal won 25-16.
The powerful Stanford attack continued
in the third, as Stanford hit .619 and took the
set 25-17, while holding Northridge to just
.115 hitting.
Stanford entered the fourth set with mo
mentum on its side, ready to win its second
straight game. The Cardinal started hot, with
a 6-3 opening run, taking an early lead and
refusing to be challenged throughout. Behind
six kills from Cook and four each from junior
outside hitter Steven Irvin and senior oppo
site Jake Kneller, Stanford took the set 25-21.
Irvin posted 14 kills on the match, hitting
.522 while also recording eight digs. Junior
middle blocker Eric Mochalski, back in the
starting lineup, chipped in 10 kills on .533 hit
ting along with two service aces. Freshman
setter James Shaw also had a remarkable
game in his return to the lineup with 52 as
sists, four kills, five digs and three blocks.
Mochalski credited the impressive per
formances from Shaw and junior libero Scott
Sakaida as the catalysts for the offensive ex
plosion, highlighting "great passing and set
ting, allowing for easier opportunities on the
offensive end."
