## Stackhouse cards record-low 61 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When freshman Mariah Stack
house teed off Sunday morning at the
Stanford Golf Course, her gallery was
at most 10 people deep, including her
mother. By the time she tapped in for
par on the 18th green, over 150 specta
tors were gathered to give a loud roar
of approval for one of the greatest indi
vidual golf efforts ever seen at Stan
ford-Stackhouse set a course record
with a round of 61 (-10 under par), in
cluding an astonishing 26 on the front
nine, en route to winning the Peg
Barnard Invitational.
"After I had the eagle on No. 7, hon
estly it was like I was a spectator
watching myself. I was just kind of like
'what is going on?'
"I knew one day I was going to
have an epic front nine, [I wondered

when that happened] would I be nerv
ous? But it was just so much fun...On
N0.9 and No. 7,1 was like 'man you've
been making putts all day, it would be
funny if this went in.' And then it went
in again and I was like, 'well, cool!"'
Freshman Mariah Staekhouse
(above) shot a record-breaking final
round 61 as Stanford won the Peg
Barnard Invitational on Sunday (Miles
Bennett-Smith/The Stanford Daily).
Staekhouse had command of every
club in the bag, beginning on the par-5
first hole, which she eagled. A birdie on
No. 2 got her to three-under par, and
she didn't cool off at all with birdies on
Nos. 3 and 4.
But it was the flatstick that literally
could not have been hotter. Sitting at
five under through six holes, the high
ly-touted Staekhouse (a high school
All-American and participant at the
2011 Ping Junior Solheim Cup)

drained a 40-footer for eagle on the
par-5 seventh, at which point the
crowd following her group really be
gan to swell.
"[lt was] absolutely amazing,"
Staekhouse' mother Sharon said. "You
come out just to support your daugh
ter and the team and you don't know
how it's going to turn out. To witness a
round like that, you can never see that
coming. It was just amazing-I was in
awe. [Around the eight or ninth hole] it
was like something really special is go
ing on today."
After sticking her approach on the
eighth hole and making birdie, Stack
house was eight-under heading to the
par-four ninth. A nice drive put her in
good position but her second shot was
too deep and left her with a tricky
downhill putt about 30 feet above the
hole.
It hit nothing but the bottom of the

cup.
That left her with a front-nine score
of 26, which is a stroke lower than the
best 9-hole score ever recorded on the
PGA Tour and three strokes better
than anything done on the LPGA Tour.
The Riverdale, Ga. native took just
nine putts.
"It's actually ironic, because the
front nine is my least favorite nine,"
Stackhouse said. "My goal on this golf
course is always to get through hole 10,
try to be at one or two under, and then
really try to have a good round the rest
of the way."
Instead, she was 10 under par after
a birdie on No. 12 and the magical
round of 59 was certainly within reach
with the course playing firm and fast
under sunny skies and just the hint of
a breeze.
