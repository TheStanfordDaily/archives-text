## Stackhouse cards record-low 61 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When freshman Mariah Stack
house teed off Sunday morning at the
Stanford Golf Course, her gallery was
at most 10 people deep, including her
mother. By the time she tapped in for
par on the 18th green, over 150 specta
tors were gathered to give a loud roar
of approval for one of the greatest indi
vidual golf efforts ever seen at Stan
ford-Stackhouse set a course record
with a round of 61 (-10 under par), in
cluding an astonishing 26 on the front
nine, en route to winning the Peg
Barnard Invitational.
"After I had the eagle on No. 7, hon
estly it was like I was a spectator
watching myself. I was just kind of like
'what is going on?'
"I knew one day I was going to
have an epic front nine, [I wondered

when that happened] would I be nerv
ous? But it was just so much fun...On
N0.9 and No. 7,1 was like 'man you've
been making putts all day, it would be
funny if this went in.' And then it went
in again and I was like, 'well, cool!"'
Freshman Mariah Staekhouse
(above) shot a record-breaking final
round 61 as Stanford won the Peg
Barnard Invitational on Sunday (Miles
Bennett-Smith/The Stanford Daily).
Staekhouse had command of every
club in the bag, beginning on the par-5
first hole, which she eagled. A birdie on
No. 2 got her to three-under par, and
she didn't cool off at all with birdies on
Nos. 3 and 4.
But it was the flatstick that literally
could not have been hotter. Sitting at
five under through six holes, the high
ly-touted Staekhouse (a high school
All-American and participant at the
2011 Ping Junior Solheim Cup)

drained a 40-footer for eagle on the
par-5 seventh, at which point the
crowd following her group really be
gan to swell.
"[lt was] absolutely amazing,"
Staekhouse' mother Sharon said. "You
come out just to support your daugh
ter and the team and you don't know
how it's going to turn out. To witness a
round like that, you can never see that
coming. It was just amazing-I was in
awe. [Around the eight or ninth hole] it
was like something really special is go
ing on today."
After sticking her approach on the
eighth hole and making birdie, Stack
house was eight-under heading to the
par-four ninth. A nice drive put her in
good position but her second shot was
too deep and left her with a tricky
downhill putt about 30 feet above the
hole.
It hit nothing but the bottom of the

cup.
That left her with a front-nine score
of 26, which is a stroke lower than the
best 9-hole score ever recorded on the
PGA Tour and three strokes better
than anything done on the LPGA Tour.
The Riverdale, Ga. native took just
nine putts.
"It's actually ironic, because the
front nine is my least favorite nine,"
Stackhouse said. "My goal on this golf
course is always to get through hole 10,
try to be at one or two under, and then
really try to have a good round the rest
of the way."
Instead, she was 10 under par after
a birdie on No. 12 and the magical
round of 59 was certainly within reach
with the course playing firm and fast
under sunny skies and just the hint of
a breeze.
But what was perhaps
more impressive than shoot
ing a 59 was Stackhouse's
composure after she showed
the first sign of nerves on the
13th and 14th holes, including
a 2-foot putt that she stood
over for a little longer than
usual before missing.
She bounced back almost im
mediately, however, munch
ing nonchalantly on a sand
wich as she walked up the
15th fairway and settling
back into her grove with
back-to-back birdies on 16
and 17.
"The one thing that really
separates Mariah, at least
right now, is her demeanor,"
said Stanford head coach
Anne Walker. "She is really
able to focus on whatever
shot she is hitting at that mo
ment. When you shoot 10 un
der, which few people ever
have, you really have to be
able to stay in the present.
For her to go bogey-bogey
and then jump back with
birdie-birdie tells me she was
absolutely in the moment on
every shot."

The par on No. 18 gave her a
round of 61, two strokes bet
ter than the score her team
mate, sophomore Mariko Tu
mangan, posted last year in
establishing the Stanford
Golf Course record.
"I think this [record] is go
ing to vibrate through the
country," Walker said of
Stackhouse's effort, which
Walker noted was likely an
NCAA Div. I record as well as
tying Tiger Woods' 61 at the
1996 Pac-10 Championship
for the lowest round by any
Stanford golfer in competi
tion.
It drew the attention of re
cent Stanford men's star and
current Web.com member
Joseph Bramlett, 'lO, who
was following the event on his
phone while hitting shots on
the range and made his way
over to follow Stackhouse's
effort live. His father went
even more out of his way,
stopping midway though a
round of his own in San Jose
to drive up and walk with the
group for the final couple of
holes.
"It was a buzz," Walker
said. "Mariah was five under
and word started spreading.
All of a sudden, everyone just
started showing up. It was a
great time."

But lost in the shuffle of
Stackhouse's individual play
was a nice start to the spring
season by the women's team
as a whole. In a field that in
cluded No. 2 Washington and
No. 10 UC-Davis, the No. 18
Cardinal ran away from
everybody to finish the two
day event at 569 (+1), 14
shots clear of second-place
California and 20 clear of UC-
Davis.
Freshman Lauren Kim
finished tied for fifth at 142
(70-72) and notched five
birdies of her own on Sunday.
Tumangan herself finished
16th at 148 (75-73) and senior
Sally Watson tied for 17th at
149 (75-74).
Junior Danielle Frasier
came back four strokes in the
final round to record a 152
(78-74) and senior Kristina
Wong, who played as an indi
vidual, tied for 54th at 159 (81-
78).
The day belonged to
Stackhouse, however.
'Anytime you win, it's a
special time," Walker said.
"To watch Mariah win her
home tournament as a fresh
man, this will be something
she will always remember."
