# Upset chance slips away

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The first half of the first game
of the 2013 season went exactly
the way the Stanford women's
lacrosse team had hoped. The sec
ond half saw it all slip away. The
Cardinal (0-1) can-ied a 7-2 lead
into halftime against No. 9 Notre
Dame, but ultimately lost 12-10 in
the season opener on Saturday af
ternoon at Cagan Stadium.

Stanford has said that its goal
this season is to compete with the
top teams in the country, and it
proved that it could early in the
game. The Cardinal attack was all
over the Fighting Irish as it tallied
14 shots in the first half alone.
After Notre Dame's Jaimie
Morrison opened the scoring five
minutes into the game, freshman
Lucy Dikeou answered back with
the first goal of her Cardinal ca
reer to tie the score at one.
For the rest of the half, the
Stanford offense was firing on all

cylinders. Senior captain Carolyn
Bradley, junior captain Anna Kim,
freshman Meg Lentz and sopho
more Emily Newstrom all record
ed goals while junior Rachel Ozer
pumped in two goals and two as
sists. The attacker, who missed
most of the 2012 season with in
jury, tallied three goals and two
assists for the game.
Stanford's defense, led by jun
ior Nina Swanson and sophomore
Rachel Kalick, also locked down in
the first half, holding Notre Dame
to two goals on just four shots.
Although the Cardinal entered
halftime with momentum after a
7-1 scoring run, Notre Dame
would turn the tide immediately
after the break. The Fighting
Irish scored less than a minute in
to the second period to cut the lead
to 7-3.
After Dikeou scored her sec
ond unassisted goal of the game,
Notre Dame scored five consecu
tive goals in under six minutes to
tie the game at 8-8. Notre Dame
outshot Stanford 21-8 in the sec
ond half.
The last fifteen minutes of the
game were filled with back-and
forth action as both teams fought
frantically to hold on to the lead.

Dikeou, who had three goals in
a strong collegiate debut, again
gave the Cardinal the lead on a
shot that was assisted by fellow
freshman Adrienne Anderson.
However, that would be Stanford's
final lead, as the Fighting Irish
came back with two goals in three
minutes to put Notre Dame ahead
for the first time since the score
was 1-0 early in the game.
Ozer added her third goal,
with an assist from sophomore
Meredith Kalinowski, to tie the
game at 10 with just over nine
minutes remaining. That would
be the final tally of the game for
the Cardinal.
Notre Dame converted a free
position shot the only free posi
tion attempt of the game with
5:40 to go and then added an in
surance goal Notre Dame's
10th of the half â€”to stretch the
lead to 12-10 less than a minute
later. The Cardinal pressured
hard for the remainder of the
game, but Notre Dame was able to
maintain possession and run out
the clock, securing the comeback.
Although Stanford's defense
struggled to contain the potent
