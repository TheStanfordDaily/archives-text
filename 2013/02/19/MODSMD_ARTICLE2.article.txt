Rachel Silverman 'O9 and Jerry Lee 'OB
M.S. 'O9 have been selected as recipients of
the 2013 Gates Cambridge Scholarship,
granting them full scholarships to pursue
graduate studies at the University of Cam
bridge.
According to a press release issued by the
Gates Cambridge Scholarship program, the
program drew 769 applicants from the United
States this year, ultimately selecting 39 schol
ars from 36 universities. Fifty scholars from
other countries will be chosen later this year.
Diane Murk, a student affairs officer at
the Bechtel International Center, said that 26

Stanford graduates have been selected as
Gates Cambridge Scholars since the pro
gram's inception in 2000. Approximately two
to three Stanford students have received the
scholarship every year.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center, said that because the
Gates Scholarship does not require a univer
sity endorsement, it is difficult to determine
how many Stanford students have applied.
However, he estimated that the program re
ceives between 10 and 12 applications from
Stanford graduates each year.
"Even though we don't have to endorse
[applicants], we are here to advise them,"
Pearson said.

The Bechtel Center offers mock inter

views and helps connect applicants to previ
ous Gates scholars who can answer their
questions about the program and the applica
tion process from their own experiences.
Both Silverman and Lee will be pursuing
an M.Phil, degree at Cambridge. Silverman
plans to study public health, while Lee in
tends to study epidemiology.
Silverman, who majored in economics and in
ternational relations at Stanford, said that
she was initially attracted to the Gates Schol
ar program because of her interest in the
University of Cambridge.
"It is incredibly beautiful, with so many
traditions and such a vibrant academic, intel
lectual culture," Silverman said. "I also want
ed a program where I could dive into learn-

ing new public health skills, and I thought the
Cambridge program was really focused on
that."
After graduating from Stanford, Silver
man worked for the National Democratic In
stitute and then the Center for Global Devel
opment. She decided to apply to graduate
school after realizing that she needed a mas
ter's degree to advance her career in the field
of public health.
According to Silverman, the application
process involved submitting an additional es
say and letter of recommendation along with
the standard application to the University of
Cambridge. While evaluating applications for
