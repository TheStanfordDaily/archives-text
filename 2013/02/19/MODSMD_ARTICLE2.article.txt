# Two Stanford grads receive Gates Scholarship
## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Rachel Silverman 'O9 and Jerry Lee 'OB
M.S. 'O9 have been selected as recipients of
the 2013 Gates Cambridge Scholarship,
granting them full scholarships to pursue
graduate studies at the University of Cam
bridge.
According to a press release issued by the
Gates Cambridge Scholarship program, the
program drew 769 applicants from the United
States this year, ultimately selecting 39 schol
ars from 36 universities. Fifty scholars from
other countries will be chosen later this year.
Diane Murk, a student affairs officer at
the Bechtel International Center, said that 26

Stanford graduates have been selected as
Gates Cambridge Scholars since the pro
gram's inception in 2000. Approximately two
to three Stanford students have received the
scholarship every year.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel In
ternational Center, said that because the
Gates Scholarship does not require a univer
sity endorsement, it is difficult to determine
how many Stanford students have applied.
However, he estimated that the program re
ceives between 10 and 12 applications from
Stanford graduates each year.
"Even though we don't have to endorse
[applicants], we are here to advise them,"
Pearson said.

The Bechtel Center offers mock inter

views and helps connect applicants to previ
ous Gates scholars who can answer their
questions about the program and the applica
tion process from their own experiences.
Both Silverman and Lee will be pursuing
an M.Phil, degree at Cambridge. Silverman
plans to study public health, while Lee in
tends to study epidemiology.
Silverman, who majored in economics and in
ternational relations at Stanford, said that
she was initially attracted to the Gates Schol
ar program because of her interest in the
University of Cambridge.
"It is incredibly beautiful, with so many
traditions and such a vibrant academic, intel
lectual culture," Silverman said. "I also want
ed a program where I could dive into learn-

ing new public health skills, and I thought the
Cambridge program was really focused on
that."
After graduating from Stanford, Silver
man worked for the National Democratic In
stitute and then the Center for Global Devel
opment. She decided to apply to graduate
school after realizing that she needed a mas
ter's degree to advance her career in the field
of public health.
According to Silverman, the application
process involved submitting an additional es
say and letter of recommendation along with
the standard application to the University of
Cambridge. While evaluating applications for
admission to Cambridge, each de
partment at the University ranks
applicants for review by the Gates
Foundation, and the Foundation se
lects applicants to interview.
Silverman was invited for an in
terview on Feb. 1 in Washington,
D.C., where a panel quizzed her
about the biological sciences, her
academic area of choice.
"They ask you tough questions
about why you want to do what you
want to do and more probing ques
tions about the subject matter, in
cluding very pointed questions
about my views on different public
health and global health issues,"
Silverman said.
Though Silverman graduated
four years ago, she took advantage

of Stanford's resources throughout
the application process. She re
ceived a letter of recommendation
from Grant Miller, associate pro
fessor of medicine, and the Over
seas Resource Center put her in
touch with a previous Gates schol
ar.
Lee also requested letters of
recommendation from Stanford
professors, including Professor of
Medicine John Cooke. After gradu
ating from Stanford, Lee taught bi
ology at Live Oak Academy in San
Jose. He applied for a research po
sition in Cooke's lab in Jan. 2010
and was selected out of a "really
great field of applicants," according
to Cooke.
"I was very happy with the
choice I made, because he fit right
in," Cooke said. "He was a team
player, diligent, meticulous, and im
mediately rolled up his sleeves and
started getting work done."
Cooke said that Lee was in

volved with creating models of vas
cular disease in mice and described
Lee as an adept animal surgeon
who was extremely creative and ea
ger to explore new things.
"Just being involved in the tech
nical aspects of the research wasn't
enough for Jerry," Cooke said. "He
wanted to get in on the intellectual
exchange, creativity and innovation
in the lab."
Lee said that he applied to the
Gates Scholarship after he "fell in
love" with Cambridge's Cardiovas
cular Epidemiology Unit. He sub
mitted his application shortly be
fore the Oct. 16 deadline and said
that he was shocked when he re
ceived the acceptance email on Feb.
5.
"I remember scrolling down,
and I was like, J didn't get it
this is too formal-sounding,"' Lee
said. "Then I saw I got it, and I was
really surprised and happy."
Lee and Silverman cited their

Stanford education as a crucial fac
tor in their selection as Gates schol
ars.
"I think the biggest thing that
Stanford helped me with was really
its research opportunities," Lee
said.
According to Silverman, the
skills she developed at Stanford
such as thinking critically, holding
her own during a panel interview
and effectively articulating her
views proved to be invaluable
during the application process.
"I definitely think that the edu
cation that I received at Stanford
was, first of all, essential to any
success in my career thus far, and
also the key to being eligible for the
scholarship," Silverman said.
"Without going to Stanford, I don't
think I would have this opportuni
ty."
