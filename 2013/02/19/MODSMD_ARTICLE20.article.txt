SEAN CHRISTOFFERSON/The Stanford Daily
Members of the Stanford Men's Gymnastics Team perform a routine on stage during the annual Athlete Date
Auction. Audience members barter to win "dates" with members from the men's and women's athletic teams. The proceeds
go to Camp Kesem, an organization that provides services for children whose parents have cancer.
