# Q&A JOE LONSDALE
## Co-founder of Palantir, Addepar discusses his Stanford roots 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Joe Lonsdale 'O4 is a co-founder of
Palantir and Addepar and a general
partner at early-growth technology fund
Formation 8. In an interview with The
Daily, Lonsdale spoke about his time at
Stanford, how it has influenced his ca
reer in Silicon Valley and the role of tech
nology in addressing broader socioeco
nomic issues.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Were there
any individuals or resources at Stan
ford that influenced or motivated you
to co-found Palantir?
Joe Lonsdale (JL): There are all sorts
of inspirations and resources I think
that Stanford is a great resource in [and]
of itself, the professors and the students
there are great. Also, I think that the for
mer students are really critical, and
there are all sorts of people coming on
campus. I think that the culture at Stan
ford really shapes how you view the
world, and you get a lot more out of an
entrepreneurial mindset.
One of the most important experi
ences for me was editing The Stanford
Review meeting a lot of alumni [of]
The Review was great, because they
were all working with Peter Thiel at Pay-
Pal at that time. Being able to access that
Stanford alumni network was huge I
actually interned at Pay Pal while I was

at Stanford and learned a lot. Being in
that environment and learning about it
as a student was really fun.

TSD: Do you feel that the environment
for starting companies and creating
new products is different from what it
was when you graduated?
JL: Yes, I still spend a lot of time
there [at Stanford] I think that it has
become even more entrepreneurial. It
has been going in that direction for a
long time, and there are even more clubs
around it now. I don't necessarily think
that you can learn entrepreneurship
from a class or a club, but I think it is
great to participate that way if you are
already naturally inclined.
TSD: If you were an undergraduate to
day, what would you have done differ
ently with regards to your Stanford
career?
JL: I probably would have used the
resources on campus to reach out to even
more great entrepreneurs and business
leaders. I think that when you are a stu
dent you have the unique opportunity to
be able to reach out and connect with
people. We don't always have the time to
reply to everyone, but if you reach out to
a lot of people and show them how you
share similar values and that you have
something to offer, some will reply and
help you out.
It's those who have already built

things themselves that you can learn the
most from. It's not really professors who
create entrepreneurs professors are
great, but they're not the ones who are
going to teach you how to navigate the
real world.
TSD: How do you think that the net
work of Stanford alumni has helped
you?
JL: I haven't used any resources di
rectly, but the idea is that when you hear
about things that alumni are doing, and
when you reach out to them, the fact that
you're a Stanford student [means that]
you will probably be able to engage with
them. You just have to figure out away to
reach out to them in away that's inter
esting and worth their time.
A lot of us are really eager to help out
students figure things out and succeed.
It's really important to build a skillset
and have something to offer. I think that
computer science is one of the best
skillsets to offer. It's not the only skillset,
though if you're a great writer, for in
stance, that's important too.

TSD: Do you think you could talk to us
a bit about the mission of Addepar,
your new company?
JL: A lot of the companies that I am
inclined to get involved in have a mission
to fix something that is 'broken' in the

world. I think that one of these
things is how global finance works
in the world. Finance is a really im
portant thing, because finance is the
base of our global economy, and is in
charge of allocating all the re
sources. If you can make finance
more functional, make it a tiny per
cent better, you create a great deal
of resources, which you can use for
other things like education and
healthcare.
A lot of the ways in which deals
get done even today are through
"old boy" networks and people
knowing each other, and there's [of
ten] no alternative. Technology has
come to the point where you can or
ganize the information and then use
big data to make finance more effi
cient and more transparent.

A lot of people don't understand
how important it is they often
think that it [finance] is something
that a lot of greedy people do. It's
actually something that is critical to
running our world, and making it
work better helps everybody.

TSD: Where do you see yourself in
five years? What challenges do
you see yourself tackling?
JL: I am really proud of the
work that I am doing as the chair
man of Addepar, and I think that it
is going to be one of the biggest
companies in Silicon Valley. I am al
so an investor and over the next
five years I want to help invest in
companies that have really impor
tant missions.
There are a lot of problems in
the world tied to big broken indus
tries, which need to be fixed, and I
think that the people who have the
best chance of fixing them are the
entrepreneurs. I think that under
standing how information works,

through a field like computer sci
ence, will help solve problems in
education, healthcare, government,
and so on. A lot of these are infor
mation-related problems, which on
ly technologists can solve that's
the mission I am on.

TSD: In a Jan. 20 Tech Crunch
Op-Ed piece, you wrote about the
need for a "culture of duty" in
Silicon Valley. Could you de
scribe your thoughts on the
matter and tell us how you be
lieve Stanford could imbue its
[computer science] and engi
neering students with that cul
ture of duty?
JL: I guess if I was in charge of
Stanford CS, one of the classes I
would have as a core would involve
bringing people in to talk about the
big challenges we're facing [and] a
lot of the crises we are facing in the
major industries right now.
There are huge problems in how
wasteful and broken our govern

ment is, our healthcare is, and so
on. I think that you start out being
interested in computer science as a
kid because it's really fun, and
you're really cool because you're
building stuff that you want to
build like games. But solving these
hard problems is what's important
to me.
The really great programmers
coming out of Stanford need to
partner with their peers and learn
how to build great teams and work
together to figure out how to fix our
major industries. The people run
ning them tend to be really naive
about technology cultures and
what's possible to fix, so there is a
huge opportunity now. People who
are good at technologies view these
industries as boring, but these big
industries are where the key prob
lems are and should be more attrac
tive.

at Stanford and learned a lot. Being in
that environment and learning about it
as a student was really fun.

TSD: Do you feel that the environment
for starting companies and creating
new products is different from what it
was when you graduated?
JL: Yes, I still spend a lot of time
there [at Stanford] I think that it has
become even more entrepreneurial. It
has been going in that direction for a
long time, and there are even more clubs
around it now. I don't necessarily think
that you can learn entrepreneurship
from a class or a club, but I think it is
great to participate that way if you are
already naturally inclined.
TSD: If you were an undergraduate to
day, what would you have done differ
ently with regards to your Stanford
career?
JL: I probably would have used the
resources on campus to reach out to even
more great entrepreneurs and business
leaders. I think that when you are a stu
dent you have the unique opportunity to
be able to reach out and connect with
people. We don't always have the time to
reply to everyone, but if you reach out to
a lot of people and show them how you
share similar values and that you have
something to offer, some will reply and
help you out.
It's those who have already built

things themselves that you can learn the
most from. It's not really professors who
create entrepreneurs professors are
great, but they're not the ones who are
going to teach you how to navigate the
real world.
TSD: How do you think that the net
work of Stanford alumni has helped
you?
JL: I haven't used any resources di
rectly, but the idea is that when you hear
about things that alumni are doing, and
when you reach out to them, the fact that
you're a Stanford student [means that]
you will probably be able to engage with
them. You just have to figure out away to
reach out to them in away that's inter
esting and worth their time.
A lot of us are really eager to help out
students figure things out and succeed.
It's really important to build a skillset
and have something to offer. I think that
computer science is one of the best
skillsets to offer. It's not the only skillset,
though if you're a great writer, for in
stance, that's important too.

TSD: Do you think you could talk to us
a bit about the mission of Addepar,
your new company?
JL: A lot of the companies that I am
inclined to get involved in have a mission
to fix something that is 'broken' in the

world. I think that one of these
things is how global finance works
in the world. Finance is a really im
portant thing, because finance is the
base of our global economy, and is in
charge of allocating all the re
sources. If you can make finance
more functional, make it a tiny per
cent better, you create a great deal
of resources, which you can use for
other things like education and
healthcare.
A lot of the ways in which deals
get done even today are through
"old boy" networks and people
knowing each other, and there's [of
ten] no alternative. Technology has
come to the point where you can or
ganize the information and then use
big data to make finance more effi
cient and more transparent.

A lot of people don't understand
how important it is they often
think that it [finance] is something
that a lot of greedy people do. It's
actually something that is critical to
running our world, and making it
work better helps everybody.

TSD: Where do you see yourself in
five years? What challenges do
you see yourself tackling?
JL: I am really proud of the
work that I am doing as the chair
man of Addepar, and I think that it
is going to be one of the biggest
companies in Silicon Valley. I am al
so an investor and over the next
five years I want to help invest in
companies that have really impor
tant missions.
There are a lot of problems in
the world tied to big broken indus
tries, which need to be fixed, and I
think that the people who have the
best chance of fixing them are the
entrepreneurs. I think that under
standing how information works,

through a field like computer sci
ence, will help solve problems in
education, healthcare, government,
and so on. A lot of these are infor
mation-related problems, which on
ly technologists can solve that's
the mission I am on.

TSD: In a Jan. 20 Tech Crunch
Op-Ed piece, you wrote about the
need for a "culture of duty" in
Silicon Valley. Could you de
scribe your thoughts on the
matter and tell us how you be
lieve Stanford could imbue its
[computer science] and engi
neering students with that cul
ture of duty?
JL: I guess if I was in charge of
Stanford CS, one of the classes I
would have as a core would involve
bringing people in to talk about the
big challenges we're facing [and] a
lot of the crises we are facing in the
major industries right now.
There are huge problems in how
wasteful and broken our govern

ment is, our healthcare is, and so
on. I think that you start out being
interested in computer science as a
kid because it's really fun, and
you're really cool because you're
building stuff that you want to
build like games. But solving these
hard problems is what's important
to me.
The really great programmers
coming out of Stanford need to
partner with their peers and learn
how to build great teams and work
together to figure out how to fix our
major industries. The people run
ning them tend to be really naive
about technology cultures and
what's possible to fix, so there is a
huge opportunity now. People who
are good at technologies view these
industries as boring, but these big
industries are where the key prob
lems are and should be more attrac
tive.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Were there
any individuals or resources at Stan

to co-found Palantir?

of inspirations and resources I think
that Stanford is a great resource in [and]
of itself, the professors and the students
there are great. Also, I think that the for
mer students are really critical, and
there are all sorts of people coming on
campus. I think that the culture at Stan
ford really shapes how you view the
world, and you get a lot more out of an
entrepreneurial mindset.
