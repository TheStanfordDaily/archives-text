## Axess to undergo extensive remodeling 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Axess, Stanford's primary ad
ministrative portal for students,
faculty and staff, is in the first
phase of a comprehensive redesign
that will take several years to com
plete, according to Associate Vice
President for Administrative Sys
tems Ganesh Karkala.
Initial improvements will in
clude installing the infrastructure
for a new portal technology, updat

ing the web design style and consol
idating content.
According to Sameer Marella,
senior director of People Soft Sys
tems, Axess is currently managed
almost entirely with People Soft
software, though the new infra
structure will permit the future in
tegration of other technologies.
Karkala said that the decision to
upgrade Axess was made by the
People Soft Steering Committee

Axess, Stanford's online administrative portal, will be comprehensively redesigned in the next few years. Such
renovations include a new infrastructure that will entail the integration of other technologies on the site.
composed of 11 representatives from business offices
across campus after members spent several years
soliciting Axess users' feedback. She expressed opti
mism about the potential for recently developed tech
nologies to upgrade user experience.
"The technology has improved a lot, so we want to
utilize those things at Stanford and give that experience
to our community," he said.
According to Marella, Stanford has used the brand
ed version of Axess since 2004, with the portal's most
recent update which included the consolidation of
Student Center options and the adoption of a new style
guide taking place in 2009. A simpler version of a
similar system has been in use since the 19905.
Members of the steering committee have been in
vestigating Axess user experience for several years,
and additional feedback for the redesign was recently
collected through a survey on the main page of Axess.
According to Marella, the recent survey posted on
the Axess main page collected over 2,000 responses in a
week, with students constituting the majority of re
spondents.
"[Users] have overwhelmingly said that they like the
fact that Axess consolidates information from a variety
of different academic and financial interactions with the
Stanford administration," Marella said. "They like that
it is all in one place so they can just go there and find
what they need to do in order to get their needs met."
Marella said that students also offered feedback on
how the redesign could improve functionality. Popular
requests included a more responsive system, improved
accessibility on mobile devices, support for a wider va
riety of browsers and a more intuitive user interface.
Ruben Pierre-Antoine 'l4, a Resident Computer
Consultant (RCC) in Larkin, offered several sugges
tions for potential improvements to Axess.
"It's kind of confusing to get around, but I think the
design is fine," Pierre-Antoine said. "I just think some
of the links on the homepage could be better."
Pierre-Antoine recommended the addition of a
search function, citing student complaints about the dif
ficulty of navigating Axess, and the integration of Axess
with related sites such as Courserank and Explore-
Courses within the course enrollment process.
Ryan Globus 'l4, Florence Moore West's RCC, ex
pressed general satisfaction with Axess but also sug
gested changes in the course enrollment process. Globus
said that he has found Simple Enroll to be "flaky and un
reliable" and said that he has instead taught some fresh
men to use the regular enroll process instead.
As a result, Globus suggested consolidating the two
enrollment systems and simplifying the site's naviga
tion.
"There is just some little design stuff, like all those
drop-down menus that aren't very user friendly,"
Globus said. "Everything seems to be cluttered or
tucked away."
While Marella emphasized the value placed on stu
dent feedback during the redesign process, she ac
knowledged that a prominent existing issue long de
lays when course enrollment opens for each quarter
will go unresolved even as the University explores "a
variety of options" to address the matter.
"It's not directly the server problem," Marella said.
"There are a lot of components interacting in the enroll
ment process at the same time."
