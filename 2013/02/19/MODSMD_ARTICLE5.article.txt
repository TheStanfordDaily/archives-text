## Law School joins green tech push 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Efforts by Stanford Law School's Steyer-Taylor Center for
Energy Policy and Finance to prompt congressional action that
would lower the cost of renewable energy projects may have
found new momentum after President Barack Obama's recent
call for a bipartisan approach to climate change, according to
the center's leaders.
"I think it's very helpful that the President has talked very
publicly and very strongly about needing to address climate
change," commented Dan Reicher J.D. 'B3, the center's direc
tor.
Reflecting a lobbying effort dating back to 2009, Reicher ar
gued that Congress could easily reduce the cost of funding re
newable energy projects by adjusting the tax code without im
posing an additional burden on taxpayers.
"I think one of the areas that Washington, D.C., could be
very helpful [in] is unleashing more capital, that is this intersec
tion with the finance community," Reicher said. "That's why
I'm hopeful about a couple of these mechanisms that could
bring dramatically lower cost[s] in capital, renewables and
more capital for energy efficiency."
Twenty-nine members of Congress recently called for simi
lar measures in an open letter to Obama in December.
"Minor changes to the federal tax code could provide the re
newable energy industry access to large pools of low-cost pri
vate capital," the letter said.
The push towards addressing climate change and renew
able energy has simultaneously influenced Stanford's engineer
ing department, with faculty placing an increased emphasis on
prompting students to examine the environmental conse
quences of their projects.
At an ethics and engineering talk on Feb. 5, John Kunz
Ph.D. 'B4, executive director of the Stanford Center for Inte
grated Facility Engineering, told a group of students pursuing
advanced degrees in engineering that climate change is the
most serious ethical question facing their generation, impacting
choices as fundamental as how they might choose to design
their buildings.
Warning students about the dangers of complacency, Kunz
also urged them to think about their building's use and to com
municate with their clients accordingly.
In his State of the Union speech, Obama framed a push to
wards developing renewable energy sources as an invaluable
step in keeping the United States a leading actor in technolo
gy's evolution.
"Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs
and manufacturing," Obama said in his speech.
While acknowledging a historical deficit in the United
States' investment in green energy relative to other nations,
Obama argued that the current narrative is about recovering
lost ground.
"Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean ener
gy market and the jobs that came with it," he said in his speech.
"We've begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added
nearly half of all new power capacity in America."
"I was very encouraged by his talk, actually," said Dariush
Rafinejad, associate consulting professor of management sci
ence and engineering.
Rafinejad conceded, however, that the lack of popular inter
est in or backing for funding green energy sources might pre-
