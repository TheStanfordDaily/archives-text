# STUDENT LIFE
## Faculty elected to engineering body 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Eight Stanford professors were
elected to the National Academy of
Engineering (NAE) on Feb. 6, in
recognition of their academic and
professional accomplishments. Stan
ford's eight elected members are the
most of any university this year,
bringing the University's total facul
ty membership in the NAE to 80.
The Daily spoke with four of the
eight professors Charbel Farhat,
professor of aeronautics and astro
nautics, Craig Bowman, professor of
mechanical engineering, Curtis
Frank, professor of chemical engi
neering and David Dill, professor of
computer science about their ca
reers, their research and their elec
tion to the NAE.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): For
what research were you elected to
the NAE?
Charbel Farhat: It was for my
work on fluid structure interaction
and its application to aeronautics,
naval and mechanical engineering
Craig Bowman: They cited for
me for part of my research. The
larger picture of my research is that
I have been concerned with fossil fu
el consumption and the environmen
tal effects of that. So, they cited for
me for some work that I did a num
ber of years ago on sources and
sinks of nitric and nitrous oxides
from combustion systems.
Curtis Frank: I don't recall exact
ly. It's something like "for the eluci
dation of molecular organization ion

polymers and other soft materials."
That's actually a pretty good charac
terization of the majority of the 300
papers we've published. How are
molecules portions of molecules
interact within the same molecule
and with other molecules?
David Dill (DD): The process is
secret, but they have a one-sentence
citation. It was for my work in for
mal verification of hardware, soft
ware and verification.
TSD: How does it feel to be elected
to the NAE?
Charbel Farhat: It feels great the
first day, and then you're back to
normal on the second day. As you
saw when you came [to interview
me], I was not exactly in celebration
mode.
Craig Bowman: On the one hand,
I obviously feel very honored. I am
also somewhat humbled by this ex
perience, because I know that there
are a lot of good people out there.
It's really quite an honor to be
picked from amongst them, but I al
so realize that there are some people
out there who deserve to be in that
aren't yet in.
David Dill: It's a major mile
stone. I consider it a significant hon
or, and I am very grateful to have re
ceived it.
TSD: What direction do you see
your research taking in the fu
ture?
Curtis Frank: We have three
project areas. One of them is a con
tinuation of our interest in hydro
gels, which are materials typically 60

percent to 90 percent water. Human
tissue is 70 percent water. So, hydro
gels are often considered as substi
tutes for various aspects of devices
and tissue engineering. So, in that
area, we are particularly interested
in using our expertise in making
polymer hydrogels, and we're col
laborating with the School of Medi
cine.
Craig Bowman: I do what I do
and have always done what I do, be
cause I think it is societally rele
vant. I have always used that as one
of the metrics in guiding my re
search I've done that since I
have got out of graduate school. I
may change the focus toward
greenhouse gases. For example,
say, are there things that will allow
us to emit less CO2 for the amount

of energy being released?

TSD: How has [being at] Stanford
helped facilitate your research?
Curtis Frank: Stanford is a won
derful environment for interdiscipli
nary research. The ability to be able
to get in contact with other faculty
who are very talented who are think
ing of things in a very different way
that's what makes this place very
special. With regards to my work
with the departments of civil and en
vironmental engineering, this [initia
tive] was started by students, who
used my lab for two years. This is
the great thing about Stanford: stu
dent initiative and the willingness of
faculty to say, "Oh yeah, sure, you
have to use it safely, but you can use
my instrumentation." A lot of good

things come out of that attitude.

TSD: What advice would you have
for Stanford students interested
in STEM fields?
Charbel Farhat: Math and
physics have a funny way of intimi
dating people. I really don't think
that they are [intimidating]. It's
more about taking the time and tak
ing the interest. If you're interested
in it, you can really do it. I don't
think it's much harder than other
things it's just harder for people
not interested.

ty membership in the NAE to 80.
The Daily spoke with four of the
eight professors Charbel Farhat,
professor of aeronautics and astro
nautics, Craig Bowman, professor of
mechanical engineering, Curtis
Frank, professor of chemical engi
neering and David Dill, professor of
computer science about their ca
reers, their research and their elec
tion to the NAE.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): For
what research were you elected to
the NAE?
Charbel Farhat: It was for my
work on fluid structure interaction
and its application to aeronautics,
naval and mechanical engineering
Craig Bowman: They cited for
me for part of my research. The
larger picture of my research is that
I have been concerned with fossil fu
el consumption and the environmen
tal effects of that. So, they cited for
me for some work that I did a num
ber of years ago on sources and
sinks of nitric and nitrous oxides
from combustion systems.
Curtis Frank: I don't recall exact
ly. It's something like "for the eluci
dation of molecular organization ion

polymers and other soft materials."
That's actually a pretty good charac
terization of the majority of the 300
papers we've published. How are
molecules portions of molecules
interact within the same molecule
and with other molecules?
David Dill (DD): The process is
secret, but they have a one-sentence
citation. It was for my work in for
mal verification of hardware, soft
ware and verification.
TSD: How does it feel to be elected
to the NAE?
Charbel Farhat: It feels great the
first day, and then you're back to
normal on the second day. As you
saw when you came [to interview
me], I was not exactly in celebration
mode.
Craig Bowman: On the one hand,
I obviously feel very honored. I am
also somewhat humbled by this ex
perience, because I know that there
are a lot of good people out there.
It's really quite an honor to be
picked from amongst them, but I al
so realize that there are some people
out there who deserve to be in that
aren't yet in.
David Dill: It's a major mile
stone. I consider it a significant hon
or, and I am very grateful to have re
ceived it.
TSD: What direction do you see
your research taking in the fu
ture?
Curtis Frank: We have three
project areas. One of them is a con
tinuation of our interest in hydro
gels, which are materials typically 60

percent to 90 percent water. Human
tissue is 70 percent water. So, hydro
gels are often considered as substi
tutes for various aspects of devices
and tissue engineering. So, in that
area, we are particularly interested
in using our expertise in making
polymer hydrogels, and we're col
laborating with the School of Medi
cine.
Craig Bowman: I do what I do
and have always done what I do, be
cause I think it is societally rele
vant. I have always used that as one
of the metrics in guiding my re
search I've done that since I
have got out of graduate school. I
may change the focus toward
greenhouse gases. For example,
say, are there things that will allow
us to emit less CO2 for the amount

of energy being released?

TSD: How has [being at] Stanford
helped facilitate your research?
Curtis Frank: Stanford is a won
derful environment for interdiscipli
nary research. The ability to be able
to get in contact with other faculty
who are very talented who are think
ing of things in a very different way
that's what makes this place very
special. With regards to my work
with the departments of civil and en
vironmental engineering, this [initia
tive] was started by students, who
used my lab for two years. This is
the great thing about Stanford: stu
dent initiative and the willingness of
faculty to say, "Oh yeah, sure, you
have to use it safely, but you can use
my instrumentation." A lot of good

things come out of that attitude.

TSD: What advice would you have
for Stanford students interested
in STEM fields?
Charbel Farhat: Math and
physics have a funny way of intimi
dating people. I really don't think
that they are [intimidating]. It's
more about taking the time and tak
ing the interest. If you're interested
in it, you can really do it. I don't
think it's much harder than other
things it's just harder for people
not interested.

Eight Stanford professors from the School of Engineering were recently inducted into the National Academy
of Engineering on Feb. 6, increasing the University's total faculty membership in the organization to 80.
