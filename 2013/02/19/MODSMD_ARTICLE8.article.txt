## How can the Olympics drop wrestling? 
### Tom Taylor 
When the Internation
al Olympic Commit
tee (IOC) announced
last Tuesday that
it was dropping
wrestling from the Olympic Games in
2020,1 started to wonder if they were
just trying to wind us sportswriters
up. I mean seriously, folks, wrestling?
One of the few sports that we can be
more or less certain the ancient
Greeks included in the original
Olympiads? It's not called Greco-Ro
man for nothing.
As much as current lOC Presi
dent Jacques Rogge might have in
gratiated himself with me after
flattering my entire country at last
year's summer games in London,
waxing lyrical about Britain's role
in sporting history, it's hard not to
see the insanity in this decision.
Technically it's not yet entirely
over for wrestling, as it now joins a
shortlist of seven other sports
from wushu to wakeboarding
looking to be added in 2020 as an ad
ditional event, but it is far from cer
tain which of those might make it.
According to the lOC, the exact
makeup of the Games is reviewed
after each Olympiad in an effort to
ensure the tournament remains
relevant to fans. And sure, maybe
wrestling isn't the biggest crowd
pleaser, but didn't the Olympics
used to be about this amateur spir
it? When was it ruled purely by
money and popularity?
Also, I'd really like someone to
explain to me how some of the
more bizarre events are consid
ered better value than wrestling. I
honestly don't know anyone or
at least not a single person I know
will openly admit to this who
cares about speed walking. In a
nutshell, this "sport" involves peo
ple trying to get from point A to
point B without running. Since bio
mechanically that doesn't make
any sense, in the races I've seen,
the leaders usually get disqualified.
Back in 2000, I was lucky
enough to visit Sydney during the
XXVII Olympiad, and my brother
and I managed to get tickets into
the Olympic Stadium on one of the
lower-key athletics days. One of
the highlights of that experience
was the final of the women's 20-
kilometer race walk, but not in a
good way.
Over the Games, Australians
were happily cheering on any oth
er Australian, so when Jane Saville
took the lead in this race after
the original frontrunner was dis
qualified the atmosphere in the
stadium, where the crowd was
watching the action on the big
screens, began to build. As Saville
approached the entrance to the
main arena, where she would need
to complete just one lap to take
gold, even cynical old me was get
ting excited.
But then she never emerged
from the tunnel onto the track.
Saville had been disqualified just
yards from making her big en
trance. Bemused, the crowd fell
silent. It was pretty funny.
The setup of the Games,
though, ensures that we will still
get to "enjoy" speed walking. The
sport that is broadly titled "athlet
ics" groups together everything
from sprinting to race walking.
Viewed in that way, it becomes
harder to kick out the "sport" of
speed walking, because that would
take with it, as a serious casualty,
the 100-meter final. Wrestling,
meanwhile has no such safety in
numbers.
Whatever. If popularity and
money were really all that the lOC
cared about, we'd have a very dif
ferent Games. Why not add in
American football the Super
Bowl always gets a good crowd
and maybe Formula 1 cyclists
and equestrians already bring
wheels and horsepower to the
Olympics anyway.
Though I can't remember back
to when this was a truly amateur
festival of sport, I thought the
Olympic Games were supposed to
be about more than just money,
and maybe even more than pure
popularity. It lies somewhere be
tween the ancient Greek tourna
ment, including sports like run
ning and wrestling, and a chance
for all the smaller sports out there,
such as table tennis and taekwon
do, to gain some honor and recog
nition. It was never a place for any
sport in which the Olympics would
n't be the pinnacle of that disci
pline.
What happens now to wrestling,
I don't know. It's hard to imagine
that golf, which is being
added for the Rio 2016, has
been hurting that much by
not being included, or that it
will gain substantially by be
ing an Olympic sport. Real
wrestling not that fake
WWE trash however,
doesn't get on TV very often
and isn't an industry worth
tens of billions of dollars.
Losing the biggest prize in a
minor sport, the biggest re
cruiting tool, could be dev
astating.

ensure the tournament remains
relevant to fans. And sure, maybe
wrestling isn't the biggest crowd
pleaser, but didn't the Olympics
used to be about this amateur spir
it? When was it ruled purely by
money and popularity?
Also, I'd really like someone to
explain to me how some of the
more bizarre events are consid
ered better value than wrestling. I
honestly don't know anyone or
at least not a single person I know
will openly admit to this who
cares about speed walking. In a
nutshell, this "sport" involves peo
ple trying to get from point A to
point B without running. Since bio
mechanically that doesn't make
any sense, in the races I've seen,
the leaders usually get disqualified.
Back in 2000, I was lucky
enough to visit Sydney during the
XXVII Olympiad, and my brother
and I managed to get tickets into
the Olympic Stadium on one of the
lower-key athletics days. One of
the highlights of that experience
was the final of the women's 20-
kilometer race walk, but not in a
good way.
Over the Games, Australians
were happily cheering on any oth
er Australian, so when Jane Saville
took the lead in this race after
the original frontrunner was dis
qualified the atmosphere in the
stadium, where the crowd was
watching the action on the big
screens, began to build. As Saville
approached the entrance to the
main arena, where she would need
to complete just one lap to take
gold, even cynical old me was get
ting excited.
But then she never emerged
from the tunnel onto the track.
Saville had been disqualified just
yards from making her big en
trance. Bemused, the crowd fell
silent. It was pretty funny.
The setup of the Games,
though, ensures that we will still
get to "enjoy" speed walking. The
sport that is broadly titled "athlet
ics" groups together everything
from sprinting to race walking.
Viewed in that way, it becomes
harder to kick out the "sport" of
speed walking, because that would
take with it, as a serious casualty,
the 100-meter final. Wrestling,
meanwhile has no such safety in
numbers.
Whatever. If popularity and
money were really all that the lOC
cared about, we'd have a very dif
ferent Games. Why not add in
American football the Super
Bowl always gets a good crowd
and maybe Formula 1 cyclists
and equestrians already bring
wheels and horsepower to the
Olympics anyway.
Though I can't remember back
to when this was a truly amateur
festival of sport, I thought the
Olympic Games were supposed to
be about more than just money,
and maybe even more than pure
popularity. It lies somewhere be
tween the ancient Greek tourna
ment, including sports like run
ning and wrestling, and a chance
for all the smaller sports out there,
such as table tennis and taekwon
do, to gain some honor and recog
nition. It was never a place for any
sport in which the Olympics would
n't be the pinnacle of that disci
pline.
What happens now to wrestling,
I don't know. It's hard to imagine
that golf, which is being
added for the Rio 2016, has
been hurting that much by
not being included, or that it
will gain substantially by be
ing an Olympic sport. Real
wrestling not that fake
WWE trash however,
doesn't get on TV very often
and isn't an industry worth
tens of billions of dollars.
Losing the biggest prize in a
minor sport, the biggest re
cruiting tool, could be dev
astating.
