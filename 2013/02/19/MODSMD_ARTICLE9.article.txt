# BASEBALL TAKES ONE
## DROPS SERIES TO RICE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's freshman pitchers
impressed, but the bats never
awoke as No. 7 Stanford fell in its
season-opening series to No. 7
Rice, two games to one in Hous
ton.

Stanford (1-2) dropped the
season opener Friday night, 5-1.
Senior starting pitcher Mark Ap
pel gave up all five runs two
earned in just five innings of
work. It was not the hometown
return that Appel, a Houston na
tive, envisioned in his first start
since a 17-1 loss in game one of
the 2012 NCAA Super Regionals
at Florida State.
In the end, one bad play and a
bit of bad luck ended up being the
difference in Friday's outcome.
Both Stanford and Rice had seven
hits, but the Owls bunched their
hits more effectively, scoring two
runs in the second inning and
three more in the fifth while pick
ing up only a bunt single in their
other six innings at the plate.
The big play of the night for
Rice came on the Owls' other bunt
single.
In the bottom of the fifth, Rice
shortstop Ford Stainback laid
down a bunt with runners on first
and second with no one out. Stan
ford sophomore catcher Wayne
Taylor tried to throw Stainback
out at first even though it
looked like Stainback was going
to beat it out easily but Tay

lor's throw got past Ragira and
ended up in right field, allowing
the lead runner to score.
To make matters worse, junior
right fielder Austin Wilson's
throw back home bounced past
Taylor for another error on the
catcher and another Rice run.
When the dust or infield dirt
settled, Rice had doubled its
lead to 4-0 with Stainback on third
and nobody out.
Stanford made a late come
back push, but it came too late.
Stanford had a runner in scoring
position in every inning except for
the seventh, but the Cardinal
combined to go 1-11 in those situ
ations. Only senior Justin Ringo
could come through, knocking in
Ragira with a single in the eighth.
One inning later, Ragira flew out
to deep left field to end the game
with freshman Zach Hoffpauir
representing the potential game
tying run on deck to give Rice a 1-
0 lead in the series.
"I was down to my last strike
so I was just thinking put some
thing in play," Ragira said. "I
thought extra-base hit. I thought
it was probably a double. They
were playing no-doubles defense,
and the guy made a great play."
Frustrated with his team's
performance over the first six in
nings Rice starting pitcher
Austin Kubitza fanned 12 over six
innings of work en route to earn
ing the victory Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess made
sweeping changes to the lineup.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Senior Justin Ringo (above) knocked in the winning run in Stanford's
lone win in this weekend's season-opening series at Rice on Saturday.
Ringo had a game-winning hit over Rice each of the last three seasons.
Austin Barr in for junior
Austin Wilson, freshman
Jonny Locher, junior Lonnie
Kauppila, sophomore Alex
Blandino and sophomore
Wayne Taylor.
On Saturday afternoon,
only two of those changes
stuck in the starting lineup:
Jackson got the start at
shortstop over Kauppila, and
Doran got the start in left
while Dominic Jose moved to
right in place of Wilson
who Marquess mentioned
was out with a sore elbow af
ter the game.
The game featured a re
match of last season's Sun
day pitching duel, with soph
omore John Hochstatter
starting for the Cardinal
against Rice's Jordan
Stephens. Last year, both
Hochstatter and Stephens
went 6.2 innings, but an un
earned run gave Stephens a
1-0 win.
Hochstatter was spot on
once again Saturday, except
when facing Rice left fielder
Michael Aquino. Aquino hit a
solo home run in each of his
first two at bats the first
on a fastball to take a 1-0 lead
and the second on a first
pitch changeup to tie the
game at two in the fourth.
"It was a lot different
than the intersquads,"
Hochstatter said. "I wasn't
able to locate everything ex
actly where I wanted, but the
defense behind me was great
and that made the difference
in the game... As the season
goes on, these close games
are going to be important,
and this defense is going to
make a big difference in
them."
Stanford's two runs came
on a Brian Ragira double
with the bases loaded in the
third. A great relay throw
and block of the plate by Rice
catcher Geoff Perrott nailed
Diekroeger attempting to
score from first.
Freshman right-handed
pitcher Daniel Starwalt im
pressed in his Stanford de
but. Starwalt took over with
a runner on second base and
nobody out in the bottom of
the sixth. The righty escaped
the jam on his way to three

and a third scoreless innings,
picking up his first career
win.
Ringo was the Rice Owl
killer once again. For the
third straight season, the
senior secured a game-win
ning hit against Rice. With
the game tied in the eighth
inning, Ringo doubled in
Brett Michael Doran to give
Stanford a 3-2 lead that
would remain as the final
score.
"We were kind of strug
gling to hit the whole week
end," Ringo said. "Our pitch
ers were doing well. I was
looking for a pitch to drive
because we needed some
thing going for us ... I wanted
to just get on base for
[Diekroeger and Ragira]. He
left a fastball over middle
away, and I was able to han
dle it to left-center."
Senior Garrett Hughes
retired both batters he faced
to earn the save and sealed
Stanford's first victory of the
season. The big lefty added
about three miles per hour to
his fastball over the offsea
son, and he still doesn't feel
like he's throwing his hard
est.
"I just tried to remain
composed," Hughes said. "I
knew my defense would be
right there behind me like
they are all season ... The on
ly goal right there is to finish
the game, to close the game."
In Sunday's rubber
game, one of Stanford's
freshman pitchers finally
blinked, if only just for a mo
ment. Southpaw Logan
James got the start and
looked shaky right from the
beginning. James walked
Leon Byrd, allowed a single
to Christian Stringer and hit
Michael Ratterree to load
the bases with nobody out.
After an Aquino groundout
scored Byrd and moved all
the runners up a base, Rice
third baseman Shane
Hoelscher singled his first
of four singles on the day
to give Rice a 3-0 lead.
In an impressive display
of mental toughness, James
settled down well, allowing
only one more base runner in
the remaining 3.2 innings he
pitched. Fellow freshman
Bobby Zarubin came in for
James to start the fifth and
had a debut to remember.
Zarubin pitched four score
less innings, allowing just

four hits and one walk, to
hold Rice at three runs for
the rest of the game.
But Stanford's hitters
could not figure out Rice
starter John Simms. The
right-hander carried a no
hitter into the eighth inning
before Barr doubled to right
center for what would turn
out to be Stanford's lone hit
of the afternoon.
"Simms kept everything
down," said Diekroeger, who
went 0-4 after combining to
go 4-8 over the first two
games of the series. "All
those guys could get the
breaking ball over. You could
n't tee off because you never
knew when the fastball was
coming... The swings were
defensive today."
Stanford will look to get
back to .500 on the season
Tuesday, when the Cardinal
hosts its biggest rival Cal in a
non-conference game at
Sunken Diamond.
Cal is coming off a week
end sweep of Michigan in
Berkeley. The Bears didn't
make it easy but came
through in the end, winning
all three games in walk-off
fashion by one run apiece.
Weather permitting, first
pitch on Tuesday is sched
uled for 5:30 p.m.

the jam on his way to three

and a third scoreless innings,
picking up his first career
win.
Ringo was the Rice Owl
killer once again. For the
third straight season, the
senior secured a game-win
ning hit against Rice. With
the game tied in the eighth
inning, Ringo doubled in
Brett Michael Doran to give
Stanford a 3-2 lead that
would remain as the final
score.
"We were kind of strug
gling to hit the whole week
end," Ringo said. "Our pitch
ers were doing well. I was
looking for a pitch to drive
because we needed some
thing going for us ... I wanted
to just get on base for
[Diekroeger and Ragira]. He
left a fastball over middle
away, and I was able to han
dle it to left-center."
Senior Garrett Hughes
retired both batters he faced
to earn the save and sealed
Stanford's first victory of the
season. The big lefty added
about three miles per hour to
his fastball over the offsea
son, and he still doesn't feel
like he's throwing his hard
est.
"I just tried to remain
composed," Hughes said. "I
knew my defense would be
right there behind me like
they are all season ... The on
ly goal right there is to finish
the game, to close the game."
In Sunday's rubber
game, one of Stanford's
freshman pitchers finally
blinked, if only just for a mo
ment. Southpaw Logan
James got the start and
looked shaky right from the
beginning. James walked
Leon Byrd, allowed a single
to Christian Stringer and hit
Michael Ratterree to load
the bases with nobody out.
After an Aquino groundout
scored Byrd and moved all
the runners up a base, Rice
third baseman Shane
Hoelscher singled his first
of four singles on the day
to give Rice a 3-0 lead.
In an impressive display
of mental toughness, James
settled down well, allowing
only one more base runner in
the remaining 3.2 innings he
pitched. Fellow freshman
Bobby Zarubin came in for
James to start the fifth and
had a debut to remember.
Zarubin pitched four score
less innings, allowing just

four hits and one walk, to
hold Rice at three runs for
the rest of the game.
But Stanford's hitters
could not figure out Rice
starter John Simms. The
right-hander carried a no
hitter into the eighth inning
before Barr doubled to right
center for what would turn
out to be Stanford's lone hit
of the afternoon.
"Simms kept everything
down," said Diekroeger, who
went 0-4 after combining to
go 4-8 over the first two
games of the series. "All
those guys could get the
breaking ball over. You could
n't tee off because you never
knew when the fastball was
coming... The swings were
defensive today."
Stanford will look to get
back to .500 on the season
Tuesday, when the Cardinal
hosts its biggest rival Cal in a
non-conference game at

Stanford's freshman pitchers
impressed, but the bats never
awoke as No. 7 Stanford fell in its
season-opening series to No. 7
Rice, two games to one in Hous
ton.

Stanford (1-2) dropped the
season opener Friday night, 5-1.
Senior starting pitcher Mark Ap
pel gave up all five runs two
earned in just five innings of
work. It was not the hometown
return that Appel, a Houston na
tive, envisioned in his first start
since a 17-1 loss in game one of
the 2012 NCAA Super Regionals
at Florida State.
In the end, one bad play and a
bit of bad luck ended up being the
difference in Friday's outcome.
Both Stanford and Rice had seven
hits, but the Owls bunched their
hits more effectively, scoring two
runs in the second inning and
three more in the fifth while pick
ing up only a bunt single in their
other six innings at the plate.
The big play of the night for
Rice came on the Owls' other bunt
single.
In the bottom of the fifth, Rice
shortstop Ford Stainback laid
down a bunt with runners on first
and second with no one out. Stan
ford sophomore catcher Wayne
Taylor tried to throw Stainback
out at first even though it
looked like Stainback was going
to beat it out easily but Tay

lor's throw got past Ragira and
ended up in right field, allowing
the lead runner to score.
To make matters worse, junior
right fielder Austin Wilson's
throw back home bounced past
Taylor for another error on the
catcher and another Rice run.
When the dust or infield dirt
settled, Rice had doubled its
lead to 4-0 with Stainback on third
and nobody out.
Stanford made a late come
back push, but it came too late.
Stanford had a runner in scoring
position in every inning except for
the seventh, but the Cardinal
combined to go 1-11 in those situ
ations. Only senior Justin Ringo
could come through, knocking in
Ragira with a single in the eighth.
One inning later, Ragira flew out
to deep left field to end the game
with freshman Zach Hoffpauir
representing the potential game
tying run on deck to give Rice a 1-
0 lead in the series.
"I was down to my last strike
so I was just thinking put some
thing in play," Ragira said. "I
thought extra-base hit. I thought
it was probably a double. They
were playing no-doubles defense,
and the guy made a great play."
Frustrated with his team's
performance over the first six in
nings Rice starting pitcher
Austin Kubitza fanned 12 over six
innings of work en route to earn
ing the victory Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess made

Senior Justin Ringo (above) knocked in the winning run in Stanford's
lone win in this weekend's season-opening series at Rice on Saturday.
Ringo had a game-winning hit over Rice each of the last three seasons.
Austin Barr in for junior
Austin Wilson, freshman
Jonny Locher, junior Lonnie
Kauppila, sophomore Alex
Blandino and sophomore
Wayne Taylor.
On Saturday afternoon,
only two of those changes
stuck in the starting lineup:
Jackson got the start at
shortstop over Kauppila, and
Doran got the start in left
while Dominic Jose moved to
right in place of Wilson
who Marquess mentioned
was out with a sore elbow af
ter the game.
The game featured a re
match of last season's Sun
day pitching duel, with soph
omore John Hochstatter
starting for the Cardinal
against Rice's Jordan
Stephens. Last year, both
Hochstatter and Stephens
went 6.2 innings, but an un
earned run gave Stephens a
1-0 win.
Hochstatter was spot on
once again Saturday, except
when facing Rice left fielder
Michael Aquino. Aquino hit a
solo home run in each of his
first two at bats the first
on a fastball to take a 1-0 lead
and the second on a first
pitch changeup to tie the
game at two in the fourth.
"It was a lot different
than the intersquads,"
Hochstatter said. "I wasn't
able to locate everything ex
actly where I wanted, but the
defense behind me was great
and that made the difference
in the game... As the season
goes on, these close games
are going to be important,
and this defense is going to
make a big difference in
them."
Stanford's two runs came
on a Brian Ragira double
with the bases loaded in the
third. A great relay throw
and block of the plate by Rice
catcher Geoff Perrott nailed
Diekroeger attempting to
score from first.
Freshman right-handed
pitcher Daniel Starwalt im
pressed in his Stanford de

a runner on second base and
nobody out in the bottom of
