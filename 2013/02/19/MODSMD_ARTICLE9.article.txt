# BASEBALL TAKES ONE
## DROPS SERIES TO RICE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's freshman pitchers
impressed, but the bats never
awoke as No. 7 Stanford fell in its
season-opening series to No. 7
Rice, two games to one in Hous
ton.

Stanford (1-2) dropped the
season opener Friday night, 5-1.
Senior starting pitcher Mark Ap
pel gave up all five runs two
earned in just five innings of
work. It was not the hometown
return that Appel, a Houston na
tive, envisioned in his first start
since a 17-1 loss in game one of
the 2012 NCAA Super Regionals
at Florida State.
In the end, one bad play and a
bit of bad luck ended up being the
difference in Friday's outcome.
Both Stanford and Rice had seven
hits, but the Owls bunched their
hits more effectively, scoring two
runs in the second inning and
three more in the fifth while pick
ing up only a bunt single in their
other six innings at the plate.
The big play of the night for
Rice came on the Owls' other bunt
single.
In the bottom of the fifth, Rice
shortstop Ford Stainback laid
down a bunt with runners on first
and second with no one out. Stan
ford sophomore catcher Wayne
Taylor tried to throw Stainback
out at first even though it
looked like Stainback was going
to beat it out easily but Tay

lor's throw got past Ragira and
ended up in right field, allowing
the lead runner to score.
To make matters worse, junior
right fielder Austin Wilson's
throw back home bounced past
Taylor for another error on the
catcher and another Rice run.
When the dust or infield dirt
settled, Rice had doubled its
lead to 4-0 with Stainback on third
and nobody out.
Stanford made a late come
back push, but it came too late.
Stanford had a runner in scoring
position in every inning except for
the seventh, but the Cardinal
combined to go 1-11 in those situ
ations. Only senior Justin Ringo
could come through, knocking in
Ragira with a single in the eighth.
One inning later, Ragira flew out
to deep left field to end the game
with freshman Zach Hoffpauir
representing the potential game
tying run on deck to give Rice a 1-
0 lead in the series.
"I was down to my last strike
so I was just thinking put some
thing in play," Ragira said. "I
thought extra-base hit. I thought
it was probably a double. They
were playing no-doubles defense,
and the guy made a great play."
Frustrated with his team's
performance over the first six in
nings Rice starting pitcher
Austin Kubitza fanned 12 over six
innings of work en route to earn
ing the victory Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess made
sweeping changes to the lineup.
Marquess inserted Hoffpauir,
junior Brett Michael Doran,
freshman Drew Jackson, sopho
