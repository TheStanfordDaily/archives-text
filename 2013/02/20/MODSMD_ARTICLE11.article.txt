# Sacramento deserves much more
## 
### Winston Shi 
The Sacramento Kings at the
turn of the millennium were
the most terrifying team I
had ever seen. This was
back when they had Chris
Webber, Peja Stojakovic, Mike Bibby,
Bobby Jackson and Doug Christie, a
tandem so terrifying that I still remem
ber their names a decade later; back
when ARCO Arena, raging with the
sound of a thousand cowbells, was the
loudest stadium in sports; back when
the Kings nearly derailed two Laker
championship runs by themselves, and
probably would have won a ring if it
hadn't been for St. Robert Horry
Granted, I was young, impression
able and easily terrified back then; five
Laker championships later, I find it
harder to be impressed by other NBA
teams.
Still, though, my memories of the
Kings remain the stuff of nightmares.
The fear persists. It will not fade away
I don't even need to imagine the play
era I just need to think of the fans.
This is the team that made filling its
stadium seem like the easiest thing in
the world; the team that sold out 11
seasons in a 13-year- span during which
they made the playoffs exactly twice.
(By comparison, if the Lakers were
ever that bad, there would be riots.)
This is the team that still manages
respectable attendance even though its
owners have had one foot out the door
for nearly a decade now Sacramento is,
by general consensus, the best fanbase
in basketball.
As with so many other hopes and
dreams, the downward spiral of the
Sacramento Kings begins with a bold
gamble in Las Vegas.
In 2005, the Maloof family —own-
era of the Sacramento Kings since 1999
and Vegas hoteliers since 1994
opened the ironically named "Rmtasy
Tower" at The Sands. The $6OO million
project—and its massive debts —ran
headlong into the Great Recession,
nearly bankrupting the entire family.
The Maloofs had made agreements
in principle to sell the team to Sacra
mento-based buyers, but recently they
turned around and struck a deal to sell
the team outright to a Seattle consor
tium and now it looks like the NBA is
going to get rid of the entire franchise
and ship it to Seattle.
My question is, does the team come
with a complimentary box of chocolate?
Or maybe some wrapping paper? I'm
sure that the team can be gifted away;
after all, that was exactly what hap
pened when the Seattle SuperSonics
moved to Oklahoma City But is that
how you treat this fanbase? This city?
Robert Horry's three-pointer to
beat the Kings in "that" Game 4 in 2002
is probably my favorite basketball mo
ment of all time. I know I should be
saying that the Lakers beating the
Celtics in the 2010 Finals was the best,
and at worst it's a close number two,
but Horry's moment was just pe rfect
the scene, the mortal enemy and a
crowd that was both amped up and
charged with the moment (a Lakers
playoff crowd is typically a fun one).
Few moments could ever be as
perfect two missed layups by the
two best players in the NBA (I still
can't believe this), the ball improba
bly bouncing to Horry right outside
the three-point line, the effortless
shot, the crowd erupting, not in the
artificial manner in which NBA are
nas try to pump up them fans, but as
if a direct line of electricity had blast
ed through our hearts and elevated
us to a whole new level of existence.
Basketball and the Kings
taught me that miracles do happen.
Sports teach you joy and love,
heartbreak and humility, how to win
and how to lose with grace but
that can only happen if you actually
care about your team. Being from
LA, I don't have a natural NFL team
to follow and while I tried to care
about the Giants, there was none of
that visceral connection you feel to a
team that represents your city, even
if nobody on that team actually came
from the place you call home.
The Lakers are my team, as a
fan. The Kings were Sacramento's
team, and more importantly, their
only team.
If the Kings leave Sacramento,
life will go on. The city can't stop and
it won't stop. People will find new
ways to spend them time; they will
devote their love and energy to other
pursuits. Life in general will contin
ue much as it has been. And the
memories of the Kings will someday
fade away.
But Sacramento deserves better
than that.

natural Angelina hatred for all things

the scene, the mortal enemy and a
crowd that was both amped up and
charged with the moment (a Lakers
playoff crowd is typically a fun one).
Few moments could ever be as
perfect two missed layups by the
two best players in the NBA (I still
can't believe this), the ball improba
bly bouncing to Horry right outside
the three-point line, the effortless
shot, the crowd erupting, not in the
artificial manner in which NBA are
nas try to pump up them fans, but as
if a direct line of electricity had blast
ed through our hearts and elevated
us to a whole new level of existence.
Basketball and the Kings
taught me that miracles do happen.
Sports teach you joy and love,
heartbreak and humility, how to win
and how to lose with grace but
that can only happen if you actually
care about your team. Being from
LA, I don't have a natural NFL team
to follow and while I tried to care
about the Giants, there was none of
that visceral connection you feel to a
team that represents your city, even
if nobody on that team actually came
from the place you call home.
The Lakers are my team, as a
fan. The Kings were Sacramento's
team, and more importantly, their
only team.
If the Kings leave Sacramento,
life will go on. The city can't stop and
it won't stop. People will find new
ways to spend them time; they will
devote their love and energy to other
pursuits. Life in general will contin
ue much as it has been. And the
memories of the Kings will someday
fade away.
But Sacramento deserves better
than that.

Just two quarters at Stanford and.
