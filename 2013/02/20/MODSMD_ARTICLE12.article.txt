# BACK IN TRAINING
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a 13-1 season capped by the Cardi
nal's first Rose Bowl victory since 1972, Stanford
football begins its 2013 campaign with spring
practice starting Monday.
Though this will be the first time Stanford
puts the pads back on since the Cardinal defeat
ed Wisconsin 20-14 in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1,
the team has been conditioning for weeks.
"I asked the guys 'Are we collectively hun
gry?'," Stanford Head Coach David Shaw said
about addressing the team before winter condi
tioning. "Our older guys have answered that
question."
When the first of two spring practice sessions
begins next week Stanford splits its allotted
spring practice time between the time before
winter quarter's dead week and the two weeks
immediately following spring break a few
players will be forced to watch from the sidelines.
Rising senior cornerback Barry Browning
will miss the first session and possibly some or all
of the second session because of "optional" back
surgery. Browning has bounced in and out of the
starting lineup since his freshman year, most re
cently joining rising junior Wayne Lyons on the
second string cornerback unit.
Rising fifth-year senior Josh Nunes will miss
all of spring practice because of an undisclosed
arm injury. Shaw declined to go into details about
how the injury occurred, but he called it "work
out-related." The injury will give rising junior
Evan Crower and rising sophomore Dallas Lloyd
extra reps in the battle for rising junior Kevin
Hogan's backup spot.
One of the more intriguing battles of the
spring will be the competition for left tackle. Ris
ing senior David Yankey was an All-American at
left tackle last season, but Shaw is hoping to
move Yankey back to his natural position of left
guard.
"I need David Yankey at left guard," Shaw
said.
Rising sophomores Andrus Peat and Kyle
Murphy are the most likely candidates to earn
the role of protecting Hogan's blind side. Shaw
mentioned that Murphy could actually push ris

ing senior Cam Fleming out of right tackle.
Fleming has started at that right tackle spot for
the past two seasons.
The other open competition on the offensive
line is the race to replace departing senior cap
tain Sam Schwartzstein at center. Rising senior
Conor McFadden who backed up
Schwartzstein in 2012 rising junior Kevin Rei
hner, rising sophomore Graham Shuler and ris
ing fifth-year senior Khalil Wilkes who start
ed at left guard last season are all very much
in the hunt.

Stanford does have some good injury news:
rising fifth-year senior fullback Geoff Meinken is
healthy after suffering a season-ending knee in
jury in last year's spring game. Meinken joins
the trio of fullbacks who all return after getting
significant time at the position last season ris
ing fifth-year senior Ryan Hewitt, rising junior
Patrick Skov and rising senior Lee Ward.
Many expected Hewitt to move to tight end to
help replace the two departing starters, Zach

Ertz and Levine Toilolo.
Shaw hopes the younger
guys, including rising sopho
more Luke Kaumatule
whom Shaw said was devel
oping nicely play well
enough for Shaw to be able to
keep Hewitt at fullback.
Shaw announced that ris
ing senior Eddie Plantaric
and rising junior Charlie
Hopkins have moved to tight
end for spring practice. Both
Plantaric and Hopkins en
tered Stanford as defensive
linemen, though Plantaric

switched to offensive line last
season.
The tailback corps got an
unexpected addition last
week, when Tyler Gaffney an
nounced his decision to take a
year off his professional base
ball career in the Pittsburgh
Pirates organization to rejoin
Stanford football for his sen
ior season. Gaffney joins ris
ing seniors Anthony Wilker
son and Ricky Seale, rising
juniors Remound Wright and
Kelsey Young Young plays
both wide receiver and run
ning back and rising soph
omore Barry J. Sanders in
what looks to be a very differ
ent type of "Party In The
Backfield."
Coach Shaw said Friday

that he does not plan on
switching any of the running
backs to different positions a
la rising fifth-year senior
Usua Amanam's switch from
tailback to nickelback two
years ago. Instead, Shaw cit
ed the 2010 running back trio
of Wilkerson, Gaffney and
Stepfan Taylor that teamed
up to replace departing star
Toby Gerhart'lo.
At the conclusion of
spring practice, Stanford
football will host the Cardinal
& White Spring Game. The
game will be held at Stanford
Stadium on April 13 at 3 p.m.
PT and is open to the public.

Rising senior David Yankey (54) was an All-American left tackle last season, but Stanford head
coach David Shaw hopes to move him back to his natural position at left guard in 2013.
Ertz and Levine Toilolo.
Shaw hopes the younger
guys, including rising sopho
more Luke Kaumatule
whom Shaw said was devel
oping nicely play well
enough for Shaw to be able to
keep Hewitt at fullback.
Shaw announced that ris
ing senior Eddie Plantaric
and rising junior Charlie
Hopkins have moved to tight
end for spring practice. Both
Plantaric and Hopkins en
tered Stanford as defensive
linemen, though Plantaric

switched to offensive line last
season.
The tailback corps got an
unexpected addition last
week, when Tyler Gaffney an
nounced his decision to take a
year off his professional base
ball career in the Pittsburgh
Pirates organization to rejoin
Stanford football for his sen
ior season. Gaffney joins ris
ing seniors Anthony Wilker
son and Ricky Seale, rising
juniors Remound Wright and
Kelsey Young Young plays
both wide receiver and run
ning back and rising soph
omore Barry J. Sanders in
what looks to be a very differ
ent type of "Party In The
Backfield."
Coach Shaw said Friday

that he does not plan on
switching any of the running
backs to different positions a
la rising fifth-year senior
Usua Amanam's switch from
tailback to nickelback two
years ago. Instead, Shaw cit
ed the 2010 running back trio
of Wilkerson, Gaffney and
Stepfan Taylor that teamed
up to replace departing star
Toby Gerhart'lo.
At the conclusion of
spring practice, Stanford
football will host the Cardinal
& White Spring Game. The
game will be held at Stanford
Stadium on April 13 at 3 p.m.
PT and is open to the public.
