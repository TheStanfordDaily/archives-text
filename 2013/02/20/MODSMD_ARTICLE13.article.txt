# Stanford set for home opener
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a season-opening trip
to Rice, in which No. 11 Stanford
(1-2) took one out of three games,
the Cardinal head home to take on
the cross-Bay rival California Gold
en Bears (3-0) in the home opener
at Sunken Diamond today at 5 p.m.
Mother nature provided an ex
tra day off for Stanford following

its Houston road trip this weekend.
Today's game was originally sched
uled for yesterday at 5:30 p.m., but
the rain caused Stanford to post
pone the first of five meetings
against Cal this season.
Last season, Stanford and Cal
split the season series with each
team winning two of the four
games. Stanford started the series
with a 19-6 thrashing of Cal in
Berkeley in non-conference action.

However, Cal got the last laugh,
spoiling Stanford's chances at a
top-eight national seed in the
NCAA Tournament with wins over
the Cardinal on Friday in 18 in
nings and Saturday —l5-5
marking Stanford's biggest margin
of defeat of 2012 in the last reg
ular season series for both squads.
Cal head coach David Esquer
'B7 makes his annual return to The
Farm to take on his former college

coach and boss Mark Marquess.
Esquer, who served as Marquess'
No. 2 assistant from 1991 to 1996, is
entering his 14th season at the
helm of the Bears.

Cal enters today's contest com
ing off a three-game sweep of
Michigan in Berkeley. However,
the sweep was anything but easy
for the Bears. Cal won by one run
in walk-off fashion in all three con
tests, needing extra innings in two
of the three to dispose of the pesky
Wolverines.

GAME NOTES: Stanford returns home after
dropping two games on a road trip to
Houston last weekend to face cross-Bay
rival California on The Farm tonight. The
Golden Bears enter this contest undefeat
ed after a three game sweep of Michi
gan in Berkeley. Stanford's pitchers have
performed well so far, but the team will
need better hitting to live up to its poten
tial.

Junior Danny Diekroeger (right) and senior Justin Ringo lead Stanford at the plate so far this season with
.333 batting averages, but the team will need to improve its hitting if it hopes to take down Cal tonight.

Designated hitter Devon
Rodriguez leads the Golden
Bears with a .583 batting av
erage on the young season.
Cal freshman left fielder
Brian Celsi's college career
got started with a bang when
he knocked in the game-win
ning run in the bottom of the
ninth Sunday to secure the
sweep. That hit represented
Celsi's lone RBI, but he is
second on the team with a
.462 batting average.
For Stanford, the pitch
ers have gotten off to a

strong start but the hitting
has lagged behind. Stan
ford's staff ERA in the
weekend series against Rice
was 2.52, led by freshmen
Marcus Brakeman, Daniel
Starwalt and Bobby Zarubin
who combined for 8.1 score
less innings of relief.
The one freshman pitcher
to allow runs at Rice on Sun
day was starter Logan
James. The lefty got off to a
tough start, allowing the
first three runners of the
game to score while record
ing only one out. However,
James buckled down, retir
ing eight straight hitters and
allowing only one additional
base runner in his remaining
3.1 innings of work.

At the plate, Stanford on
ly managed to hit .167 on the
weekend. Junior Danny
Diekroeger and senior
Justin Ringo lead all Cardi
nal hitters with a .333 bat
ting average. Junior Austin
Wilson missed the final two
games of the Rice series be
cause of an arm injury. Wil
son's role in today's game
could provide insight into
how serious the injury is.
After Cal, Stanford hosts
Fresno State at Sunken Dia
mond in a three game series
starting Friday. First pitch
Friday night is scheduled for
5:30 p.m.
