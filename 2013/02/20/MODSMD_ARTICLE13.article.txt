# Stanford set for home opener
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a season-opening trip
to Rice, in which No. 11 Stanford
(1-2) took one out of three games,
the Cardinal head home to take on
the cross-Bay rival California Gold
en Bears (3-0) in the home opener
at Sunken Diamond today at 5 p.m.
Mother nature provided an ex
tra day off for Stanford following

its Houston road trip this weekend.
Today's game was originally sched
uled for yesterday at 5:30 p.m., but
the rain caused Stanford to post
pone the first of five meetings
against Cal this season.
Last season, Stanford and Cal
split the season series with each
team winning two of the four
games. Stanford started the series
with a 19-6 thrashing of Cal in
Berkeley in non-conference action.

However, Cal got the last laugh,
spoiling Stanford's chances at a
top-eight national seed in the
NCAA Tournament with wins over
the Cardinal on Friday in 18 in
nings and Saturday â€”l5-5
marking Stanford's biggest margin
of defeat of 2012 in the last reg
ular season series for both squads.
Cal head coach David Esquer
'B7 makes his annual return to The
Farm to take on his former college

coach and boss Mark Marquess.
Esquer, who served as Marquess'
No. 2 assistant from 1991 to 1996, is
entering his 14th season at the
helm of the Bears.

Cal enters today's contest com
ing off a three-game sweep of
Michigan in Berkeley. However,
the sweep was anything but easy
for the Bears. Cal won by one run
in walk-off fashion in all three con
tests, needing extra innings in two
of the three to dispose of the pesky
Wolverines.

GAME NOTES: Stanford returns home after
dropping two games on a road trip to
Houston last weekend to face cross-Bay
rival California on The Farm tonight. The
Golden Bears enter this contest undefeat
ed after a three game sweep of Michi
gan in Berkeley. Stanford's pitchers have
performed well so far, but the team will
need better hitting to live up to its poten
tial.
