# SPORTS BRIEF
## Softball's Kelsey Stevens named Pac-12 Pitcher of the Week 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Freshman Kelsey Stevens was
nearly perfect in the circle this
weekend at the Stanford Nike Invi
tational, giving up just four hits (all
singles) en route to posting three
shutouts as the No. 20 Cardinal
swept all six games to win the title.
Stevens was rewarded Tuesday
with the Pac-12 Pitcher of the
Week award, the first career award
for the Albuquerque, N.M. native.
Now 5-1 on the season, Stevens
leads the team with a 1.50 ERA
and 49 strikeouts on the season. In
Stanford's 12-0 win over CSU Bak
er sfield and 8-0 win over UC-
Davis, she tossed consecutive one
hitters. Batters hit just .075
against her on the weekend and
she allowed just three walks. Stan
ford and Stevens will head to the
Cathedral City Classic in Palm
Springs, Calif, this weekend.
