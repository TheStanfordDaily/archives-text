# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Card perfect against ASU 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
Heading into last Friday's
meet against then-No. 25 Arizona
State, the No. 10 Stanford
women's gymnastics team was the
favorite to come out with the vic
tory. The Cardinal did indeed
leave with a win in the matchup,
but few could have predicted how
strong of a performance it would
put together to earn its first home
victory of the season.

Stanford won the meet
197.275-195.250 to improve to 8-2
on the season, while Arizona State
fell to 2-5. The Cardinal won each
of the four events, and its 197.275
score was a season-best for the

team, which hadn't posted a score
in the 197-point range until Fri
day.
Stanford senior Ashley Mor
gan stole the show, scoring at least
a 9.825 in all four events to come
away with a career-best all
around score of 39.550 in front of a
crowd of over 1,400 in Maples
Pavilion. Her teammates were
nearly as impressive in a true
team victory, as there was a differ
ent individual winner from Stan
ford for each of the four events.
"Throughout the year there
have been standout routines and
highlights from individuals," Mor
gan said, "but this past weekend
we showed how strong a team we
are."
The night got started on vault,
where Stanford took an early lead
in the meet with a 49.225-48.800
win. Any worries about being
rusty following a two-week break
were quickly dispelled, as Stan

ford came out strong in the event.
Coming off a career-best perform
ance at UCLA, sophomore Ivana
Hong led the way with her second
consecutive 9.900 in the event to
earn the individual victory. Senior
Nicole Dayton finished second
with a score of 9.875 and Morgan
finished third in the team with
9.825, her lowest score all evening.
Stanford kept the ball rolling
with a season-best of 49.375 on
bars. Each Stanford competitor
scored above a 9.800. No Sun Dev
il could match that score, so the
Cardinal earned an easy victory in
the event. Sophomore Kristina Va
culik tied her career-best score of
9.925 to win the individual title,
while Ail-Americans sophomore
Samantha Shapiro and Ashley
Morgan earned second and third
place with scores of 9.900 and
9.875, respectively.
