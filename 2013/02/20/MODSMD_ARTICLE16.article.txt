## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD This Stanford Life #1: Sam King 
### Renée Donovan 
Tthink a lot of people don't have
I an ethical code they live by
-Levery day. A lot of people are
apathetic. They don't know the impli
cations of their purchase decisions."
I stare down at my Starbucks cup,
immediately self-conscious and overly
aware of the "Made in China" tags I'm
sure can be found on every item of
clothing I'm wearing. Even if I do
know the implications of my pur-chase
decisions, I don't seem to be doing
much about them.
Sam King has a slight frame and
lively hand gestures. He is soft-spo
ken but well-spoken. He is from Eu
gene, Ore., well, really from the out
skirts of Cottage Grove, but it's Eu
gene that he identifies with more. He
graduated from Stanford in 2012 and
is finishing up a coterm in computer
science. When I start off with small
talk he is reserved and has little to say
besides polite "mm-hmms," but when
I ask him more prying questions, he
riffs on his values with gusto. He is off
beat, unexpected and notably consci
entious.
Sam came into Stanford thinking
he might be a political science major.
He was inspired by Peter Singer's
teachings of utilitarianism in Rob Re
ich's class, but CS 106A was where
things really clicked. Describing his
realization that he could use program
ming to make a difference in the
world, he says, "It was the first time I
was actually building something." He
got involved in Dance
Marathon/Hackathon and founded
Code the Change in the spring of
2011.
Currently a CS 109 TA, he tells
me, "There's a big need for CS majors
to discover the potential they have to
effect social change."
When I ask him to tell me some
thing few people know about him, he
pulls out his phone to review the email
he wrote to me earlier. He nods, then
puts the phone away and checks back

into the conversation, thoughts organ
ized. He is the type of person who
won't just start talking without his
thoughts composed—the residue of
many years of competing on his high
school debate team. He tells me that
for him, aesthetics are second to
ethics. When I stare back perplexed,
he explains, "It's like everybody per
ceives the world through a lens, and
I'm trying to be conscious of the lens
I'm looking through." He goes on to
tell me that when he explains this to
most people, he gets hostile reactions.
"It's like people think I'm not human."
This astounds me. Sam comes
across as quietly intense but altogeth
er human. He holds himself to a
stricter standard than most, that's all.
He is acutely self-aware. He doesn't
drink because he knows himself to
have an addictive personality. As he
puts it, "Inertia is a very powerful
force on me."
When I ask him to tell me a guilty
habit, he replies that he believes in ve
ganism but still eats eggs and dairy—
a habit he feels he should divorce him
self from. He is already a strict vege
tarian, the kind that bans the gelatin
in mai'shmallows and frosted Mini-
Wheats as well as the more obvious
things.
We chat briefly about his music
taste The Decemberists Pandora
radio station and Ratatat but he al
ways returns to his code of ethics,
clearly the part of himself he consid
ers most important. Before we wrap
up our discussion, I ask him to give me
a concrete example of his mantra of
"ethics before aesthetics." He pauses
to compose his thoughts and I see the
high school kid preparing his argu
ment for debate team. His answer:
"I've never seen a sunset more beau
tiful than justice."
