## Center accesses supercomputer 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Researchers at Stanford's Cen
ter for Ibrbulence Research (CTR)
have been granted exclusive access
to a new one-million-core supercom
puter at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL) in
Livermore, Calif.
Exclusive access to the new su
percomputer may allow researchers
at CTR to make breakthroughs in
modeling air flow and aeronautical
engine design, according to CTR di
rector Parviz Moin M.S. '75 M.S. '7B
Ph.D. '7B.
The one-million-core supercom
puter, called Sequoia, is the second
most powerful computer in the
world. The computer has a proces
sor with a memory of 1.6 quadrillion
bytes for storing calculation data
and incorporates nodes of 16-eore
processor chips with 16 gigabytes of
memory each.

"It's a new architecture. If you
want to think of it in terms of your
usual desktop, a high caliber desk
top with an 8-core chip, consider it as
one node," said Ivan Bermejo-
Moreno, a postdoctoral fellow at the
CTR. "This supercomputer has that
multiplied by 120,000 times the com
puting power and twice that in
terms of memory."
The computer's use is not just re
stricted to turbulence research, ac
cording to Moin. He said that Se
quoia can also be used for dynamic
heat research and structural calcula
tions and can even simulate a beat
ing heart.
According to Bermejo-Moreno,
Sequoia is "by far one of the green
est supercomputers," an opinion
echoed by CTR Research Assistant
Joseph Nichols.
"The philosophy behind the ar
chitecture is to use many cores, but
not cores as powerful as other types
of computers," Nichols said. "What

that does is use less electricity and
also lets you cram more cores into
smaller area."

The CTR will be able to access
Sequoia and Vulcan an older su
percomputer at the LLNL until
April, when the National Nuclear
Security Administration will close
them for governmental use.
"We are getting a chance to use
them for our research before they
go behind the fence," Moin said.
According to Moin, Sequoia has
the potential to facilitate major ad
vances in the CTR's research by
closely modeling computations like
the flow over an aircraft and creat
ing more realistic simulations.
CTR's research may also carry
over into the development of com
mercial products. According to
Moin, several aerospace engineering
firms have expressed interest in in
corporating technologies researched
