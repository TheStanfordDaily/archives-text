## Uproar at Senate meeting over divestment presentation 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At a meeting that lasted over two and a half
hours, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate ap
proved 46 special fees funding bills, gave feedback
to representatives of the Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) and put a bill on previous
notice that, if passed, will urge the Board of
Trustees to reevaluate Stanford's endowment in
vestments.
Almost 20 visitors crowded into the Nitery
meeting room to hear the Senate's decisions on
special fees groups and listen to a presentation by
Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3, who called for Stanford
to divest from companies that "violated interna
tional law"
The Senate voted on funding for gi-oups that
had received special fees the previous year and
had not requested more than a 7.1 percent budget
increase. It also approved several general fees,
Publication Board bills and special fees budget
modifications.
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen
Thrsheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 questioned whether the en
tire Senate had read the funding bills before them
thoroughly
"How many of these have you guys read?"
Thrsheim asked. "You're approving $1.9 million in
funding right now I just want to make sure no one
is taking this lightly."
Appropriations Committee Chair' Nancy
Pham 'l4 responded that the six member's of the
Appropriations Committee had reviewed every

funding bill, and noted that the bills were sent out
to all senator's prior to the meeting. Pham sent out
the funding bills at 1 pm. that afternoon.
All funding bills, with the exception of a $91,000
application from Sunday Flicks, were passed.
Pham told senator's that while the Appropriations
Committee had previously recommended the ap
plication for Sunday Flicks, they reconsidered af
ter examining the group's $9,900 requests for offi
cer salaries.
According to Pham, Sunday Flicks will petition
the student body for special fees funding.
During the second half of the meeting, Ralph
Castro, director of the Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE), visited the Senate to discuss
OAPE's history and mission.
"The University is not at war with alcohol,"
Castro said. "We're at war with the behaviors of
high-risk drinking and the related consequences.
We're at war with blackouts, with vomiting, with
transports with the things that people don't
want when they are using alcohol."
Castro reiterated that the University does not
want to completely eliminate alcohol use and that
he personally has no issue with social drinking.
"I actually consume alcohol," Castro said. "I
am a successful social drinker. It's something I've
aspired to for my whole life, and I've achieved it,
like nirvana."
Castro, Assistant Director & Community En
gagement Coordinator Angelina Cardona 'll and
Assistant Director & Outreach Education Coordi
nator Jarreau Bowen 'O7 MA 'OB answered ques
tions from senators about alcohol initiatives at

Wilbur, substance free housing, the OAPE iPhone
app and the summer session alcohol policy.
The meeting ended with a presentation by
Shakir, founder and co-president of Stanford Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights (SPER).
ShaMr submitted a bill to the Senate that called
on the Board of IVustees to reevaluate University
investments in several companies, including Riwal,
Motorola, Ahava, Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin,
Veolia Transport, Mekorot Water Company and
Cement Roadstone Holdings.
Shakir claimed that the companies "violate hu
man rights and international law."
"We don't presume to be experts on invest
ments and endowments," he said. "We are not
telling the Board of Thistees how to run its shop.
Rather, we are calling on them to reevaluate in
vestments in the four sets of activities we talk
about."
Jason Lupatkin 'l3 contested Shakir's asser
tions, arguing that Shakir lacked credible sources
or expertise on the subject.
"If we are going to listen to a history lesson
tonight and see maps, it would be in our best inter
est to have a list of sources," Lupatkin said.
Shakir said that sources were available on
SPER's website and tried to continue the presen
tation before being interrupted again.
Other students at the presentation became in
volved in the argument, forcing Senate Chair
Branden Crouch 'l4 to call the meeting to order
before Shakir could continue. Shakir finished the
presentation amid scoffs from several students
dissenting fi-om his claims about Israeli war dimes

and discriminatory policiesâ€”by asking senators
not to shy away from such a contentious topic.
"Sometimes changing significant things in soci
ety does lead to a pushback," Shakir said, "but that
doesn't mean that the middle ground is the right
ground."
After Shakir finished speaking, Crouch al
lowed a more open student debate. More than 10
students took the opportunity to speak, and at sev
eral points Crouch had to remind them about the
two-minute speaking limit and ask them not to in
terrupt each other.
Daniel Bardenstein 'l3, who said that he was
"pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli," questioned the
accuracy of Shakir's presentation.
"Typically that is how this conflict is being por
trayed, it's one side or another, but it's not that
way" he said. "In terms of historical accuracy I am
embarrassed, as a Stanford student, after watch
ing this [presentation]."
Alon Elhanan 'l4, a former senator who said
that he identifies with a pro-Israeli perspective,
asked to give a presentation at the next Senate
meeting before the Senate votes on the bill.
"The idea of divestment from specific compa
nies, it sounds really good, but that was a false nar
rative," Elhanan said. "Really it's just a global
wide movement to work against Israel."
Elections Commissioner Brianna Pang 'l3,
who attended the meeting to observe special fees
voting, asked anyone interested in the issue to
present his or her concerns at a town hall forum
