### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An enormously successful regular season
for the women's swimming and diving team
ended on a low note on Saturday afternoon at
Berkeley. The team, needing only one more
win to cap off an undefeated season in confer
ence play, was dealt a painful 154.5-145.5 de
feat at the hands of archrival Cal.
Things could have turned out differently
for No. 2 Stanford (7-2, 4-1) in this incredibly
close meet if it had just won two of the races

that it had claimed second place in. However,
things didn't go the Cardinal's way and No. 7
Cal (7-2, 3-2) handed Stanford just its second
loss of the dual meet season. The only other
defeat suffered by the Card was another
heartbreaker to No. 7 Texas back in early No
vember, decided by an even smaller margin of
three points.

Sophomore Maddy Schaefer, one of the
nation's strongest sprint swimmers, shined in
her events yet again, continuing her streak of
dominance in the pool. Schaefer claimed vic
tory in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle
events and was part of a winning effort in the
400-yard freestyle relay toward the end of the
afternoon.
Junior Felicia Lee also ended the regular
season on a strong note. Lee, who has been
one of the Cardinal's most consistent swim
mers down the stretch, did not falter on Sat
urday. Lee claimed victory in the 100-yard

backstroke and was touched out by two
tenths of a second in the 100-yard butterfly.
She was also part of the victorious 400-yard
freestyle relay, swimming a blistering 48.71
anchor leg to hold off Cal's Elizabeth Pelton.
It was also a strong afternoon for juniors
Andie Taylor and Stephanie Phipps. Taylor
showed her versatility in swimming both
shorter and long-distance races, winning the
500-yard freestyle and coming in second in
both the 1000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard
