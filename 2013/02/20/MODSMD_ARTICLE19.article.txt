# Cal snaps Card's undefeated Pac-12 run
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An enormously successful regular season
for the women's swimming and diving team
ended on a low note on Saturday afternoon at
Berkeley. The team, needing only one more
win to cap off an undefeated season in confer
ence play, was dealt a painful 154.5-145.5 de
feat at the hands of archrival Cal.
Things could have turned out differently
for No. 2 Stanford (7-2, 4-1) in this incredibly
close meet if it had just won two of the races

that it had claimed second place in. However,
things didn't go the Cardinal's way and No. 7
Cal (7-2, 3-2) handed Stanford just its second
loss of the dual meet season. The only other
defeat suffered by the Card was another
heartbreaker to No. 7 Texas back in early No
vember, decided by an even smaller margin of
three points.

Sophomore Maddy Schaefer, one of the
nation's strongest sprint swimmers, shined in
her events yet again, continuing her streak of
dominance in the pool. Schaefer claimed vic
tory in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle
events and was part of a winning effort in the
400-yard freestyle relay toward the end of the
afternoon.
Junior Felicia Lee also ended the regular
season on a strong note. Lee, who has been
one of the Cardinal's most consistent swim
mers down the stretch, did not falter on Sat
urday. Lee claimed victory in the 100-yard

backstroke and was touched out by two
tenths of a second in the 100-yard butterfly.
She was also part of the victorious 400-yard
freestyle relay, swimming a blistering 48.71
anchor leg to hold off Cal's Elizabeth Pelton.
It was also a strong afternoon for juniors
Andie Taylor and Stephanie Phipps. Taylor
showed her versatility in swimming both
shorter and long-distance races, winning the
500-yard freestyle and coming in second in
both the 1000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard

butterfly.
Phipps, Stanford's top
diver, dominated the three
meter dive to the tune of a
30-point margin of victory
and came in second in the
one-meter dive by the mar
gin of less than one point.
The Cardinal was outper
formed on Saturday after
noon by the two-pronged
Golden Bear attack from
freshman and Olympic gold
medalist Rachel Bootsma
and senior and Olympic
bronze medalist Caitlin Lev
erenz. They spearheaded the
meet-opening victory for Cal
in the 200-yard medley relay
and continued to carry the
team throughout the after
noon.
Bootsma claimed victory
in both the 100-yard and 200-
yard butterfly events and al
so swam a powerful opening
leg in the 200-yard medley
relay to put the Bears in po
sition for a resounding meet
opening win. Although
Bootsma has not been suc
cessful in her specialty
stroke, the backstroke, she
has completely dominated
the butterfly this year and
has more than made up for
her slower-than-usual back
stroke times.
As expected, Leverenz
proved her breaststroke

prowess on Saturday, win
ning both the 100-yard and
200-yard events by margins
of a second each. She also
swept away the competition
in her other specialty event,
the individual medley (IM),
winning the 200-yard event
by a margin of over two sec
onds. She also swam a pow
erful breaststroke leg in the
200-yard medley relay to put
her team in position for a
strong victory in the event.
Although the Cardinal
was foiled by the strong ef
forts of the Golden Bears
and was unable to complete
a second straight season
with an undefeated confer
ence record, it has turned in
yet another dominant regu
lar season. The historically

strong women's team con
vincingly won in its seven
victories and suffered its on
ly two losses by margins of
less than ten points each.
The team will absorb this
dual meet loss and continue
its intense preparations for
its true goal: peaking at the
championship meets. The
Pac-12 Championship takes
place from Feb. 27 to March
3 in Washington and has a
very different atmosphere
and format from the dual
meets. In just over a week,
the Cardinal will attempt to
claim its third conference
championship in the last four
years.

Things could have turned out differently
for No. 2 Stanford (7-2, 4-1) in this incredibly
close meet if it had just won two of the races

that it had claimed second place in. However,
things didn't go the Cardinal's way and No. 7
Cal (7-2, 3-2) handed Stanford just its second
loss of the dual meet season. The only other
defeat suffered by the Card was another
heartbreaker to No. 7 Texas back in early No
vember, decided by an even smaller margin of
three points.

Sophomore Maddy Schaefer, one of the
nation's strongest sprint swimmers, shined in
her events yet again, continuing her streak of
dominance in the pool. Schaefer claimed vic
tory in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle
events and was part of a winning effort in the
400-yard freestyle relay toward the end of the
afternoon.
Junior Felicia Lee also ended the regular
season on a strong note. Lee, who has been
one of the Cardinal's most consistent swim
mers down the stretch, did not falter on Sat
urday. Lee claimed victory in the 100-yard

backstroke and was touched out by two
tenths of a second in the 100-yard butterfly.
She was also part of the victorious 400-yard
freestyle relay, swimming a blistering 48.71
anchor leg to hold off Cal's Elizabeth Pelton.
It was also a strong afternoon for juniors
Andie Taylor and Stephanie Phipps. Taylor
showed her versatility in swimming both
shorter and long-distance races, winning the
500-yard freestyle and coming in second in
both the 1000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard

butterfly.
Phipps, Stanford's top
diver, dominated the three
meter dive to the tune of a
30-point margin of victory
and came in second in the
one-meter dive by the mar
gin of less than one point.
The Cardinal was outper
formed on Saturday after
noon by the two-pronged
Golden Bear attack from
freshman and Olympic gold
medalist Rachel Bootsma
and senior and Olympic
bronze medalist Caitlin Lev
erenz. They spearheaded the
meet-opening victory for Cal
in the 200-yard medley relay
and continued to carry the
team throughout the after
noon.
Bootsma claimed victory
in both the 100-yard and 200-
yard butterfly events and al
so swam a powerful opening
leg in the 200-yard medley
relay to put the Bears in po
sition for a resounding meet
opening win. Although
Bootsma has not been suc
cessful in her specialty
stroke, the backstroke, she
has completely dominated
the butterfly this year and
has more than made up for
her slower-than-usual back
stroke times.
As expected, Leverenz
proved her breaststroke

prowess on Saturday, win
ning both the 100-yard and
200-yard events by margins
of a second each. She also
swept away the competition
in her other specialty event,
the individual medley (IM),
winning the 200-yard event
by a margin of over two sec
onds. She also swam a pow
erful breaststroke leg in the
200-yard medley relay to put
her team in position for a
strong victory in the event.
Although the Cardinal
was foiled by the strong ef
forts of the Golden Bears
and was unable to complete
a second straight season
with an undefeated confer
ence record, it has turned in
yet another dominant regu
lar season. The historically

strong women's team con
vincingly won in its seven
victories and suffered its on
ly two losses by margins of
less than ten points each.
The team will absorb this
dual meet loss and continue
its intense preparations for
its true goal: peaking at the
championship meets. The
Pac-12 Championship takes
place from Feb. 27 to March
3 in Washington and has a
very different atmosphere
and format from the dual
meets. In just over a week,
the Cardinal will attempt to
claim its third conference
championship in the last four
years.
