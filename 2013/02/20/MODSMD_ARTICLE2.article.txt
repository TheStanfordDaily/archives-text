# Thiel Fellowship attracts Stanford students
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
More than 100 Stanford students
have applied for the Thiel Fellow
ship, a program founded in 2010 by
entrepreneur Peter Thiel 'B9 J.D. '92
that offers students $lOO,OOO to drop
out of college for two years and pur
sue a project of interest. Three
Stanford students have been accept
ed to the Fellowship in its two class
es thus far.
According to Thiel Fellowship
Program Director Danielle Strach
man, Thiel created the program to
encourage young entrepreneurs and
researchers to take a chance on
their ideas instead of following a tra
ditional career path.
"It is safer to go out and get an
investment banking job," Strach
man noted. "Most people aren't go

ing out and doing something risky
and innovative because they no
longer really have the time or the
capital to spend on those things. For
some fellows, it was really just a
godsend to be able to have this
time."
Among the Fellowship's Stan
ford contingent, Tom Currier 'l3
and Ph.D. candidate Andrew Hsu
joined the first class of 21 fellows in
2011, and Omar Rizwan 'l6 was ac
cepted to the second class of 20 fel
lows in 2012.
Hsu, who founded an educational
gaming startup called Airy Labs,
graduated with three degrees from
the University of Washington at age
16. In 2007, he enrolled as a Ph.D.
candidate in Stanford's neuro
science program and was in the
fourth year of the program when he
left to accept the fellowship.

While Hsu was the first Thiel
Fellow to raise venture funding,
Airy Labs has since been the sub
ject of controversy. Large cuts were
made to the company's workforce
last year, and a number of ex-em
ployees have complained that Hsu
was an inexperienced and unreason
able manager.
Currier, who left Stanford after
his sophomore year to become a
Thiel Fellow, has avoided such
scrutiny to date. The alternative en
ergy company that he launched in
2010, Black Swan Solar, was in the
first class of StartX, a Stanford-ex
clusive startup accelerator. Currier
cofounded a new company, Campus,
in December of 2012.

Thiel Fellow, was accepted into the

program while still in high
school. He delayed his partic
ipation to enroll in Stanford
in 2012, but left at the end of
fall quarter after realizing
what he wanted to do with his
fellowship.
"I really liked my time at
school and made a lot of good
friends there, but I was excit
ed to use what I learned
there to build some stuff on
my own that people could ac
tually use," Rizwan said.
Rizwan said that his inter
est in different models of ed
ucation led him to apply for
the fellowship and that he
hopes to explore his ideas in a
"free-form way" during his
two years as a fellow.
"I think there is a lot of
value to the college experi
ence socially and academical
ly, but I also think the format
of classes can be kind of con
straining," he said. "It will be
good to build some tangible
projects and products that
can actually go out and affect
the real world, which is sort
of difficult to get if you are
just sitting down and doing
homework and taking ex
ams."
Rizwan has traveled ex
tensively around the country
to develop his project. He ap
plauded the program's flexi
bility in allowing fellows to

pursue their interests. Ac
cording to Strachman, fel
lows are not required to stay
in the Bay Area, though they
do meet monthly with a per
sonal advisory board and
have a formal review with the
Thiel Foundation every three
to four months.
"It's been really great.
The Foundation is very sup
portive," Rizwan said. "As
long as you're confident in
your project and you feel like
you are learning things and
you're driven, it's a great ex
perience."
Alice Fang 'l5, vice presi
dent of the Business Associa
tion of Stanford Entrepre
neurial Students (BASES)
Freshman Battalion, ex
pressed her desire to follow
in Rizwan's footsteps.
Fang is currently in the
second round of the fellow
ship's application process.
She applied with the inten
tion of developing a science
journal she founded while in
high school. She first heard of
the fellowship in the fall of
2011 when Thiel spoke at an
event hosted by BASES.
Fang said that she was at
tracted to the program for
many of the same reasons
she chose to enroll in Stan
ford.
"It has that spirit of what
education today can be like,
and it's not like a format that
everyone follows, it's sort of
going out there and being en
trepreneurial," she said.
Although Fang down

played her chances of being
selected as a fellow, she said
she would accept the fellow
ship without hesitation.
However, some students
questioned whether or not
the program provides a more
valuable experience than a
Stanford education.
Andrew Han 'l6 said that
he first heard of the Thiel
Fellowship in high school but
noted that he likely wouldn't
apply to the program even if
he was qualified. "The idea
is that they are paying you to
drop out of college, and
$lOO,OOO isn't that much mon
ey to start up a business,"
Han said. "As smart as you
are, I feel like college is a
time of personal development
and personal growth, and I
think foregoing it is very
proud, almost to the point of
arrogance."
Han said that he views the
Thiel Fellowship as a "two
year paid vacation" and be
lieves that the Silicon Valley
legend of dropping out of col
lege to start a business can be
dangerous if over-reliant on a
few prominent examples
such as Mark Zuckerberg
and Bill Gates.
"Timing isn't everything,
as some startup people would
like to believe," he said.
"With that said, if you truly
believe that you have a good
idea, by all means you should
take risks."
