# Thiel Fellowship attracts Stanford students
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
More than 100 Stanford students
have applied for the Thiel Fellow
ship, a program founded in 2010 by
entrepreneur Peter Thiel 'B9 J.D. '92
that offers students $lOO,OOO to drop
out of college for two years and pur
sue a project of interest. Three
Stanford students have been accept
ed to the Fellowship in its two class
es thus far.
According to Thiel Fellowship
Program Director Danielle Strach
man, Thiel created the program to
encourage young entrepreneurs and
researchers to take a chance on
their ideas instead of following a tra
ditional career path.
"It is safer to go out and get an
investment banking job," Strach
man noted. "Most people aren't go

ing out and doing something risky
and innovative because they no
longer really have the time or the
capital to spend on those things. For
some fellows, it was really just a
godsend to be able to have this
time."
Among the Fellowship's Stan
ford contingent, Tom Currier 'l3
and Ph.D. candidate Andrew Hsu
joined the first class of 21 fellows in
2011, and Omar Rizwan 'l6 was ac
cepted to the second class of 20 fel
lows in 2012.
Hsu, who founded an educational
gaming startup called Airy Labs,
graduated with three degrees from
the University of Washington at age
16. In 2007, he enrolled as a Ph.D.
candidate in Stanford's neuro
science program and was in the
fourth year of the program when he
left to accept the fellowship.

While Hsu was the first Thiel
Fellow to raise venture funding,
Airy Labs has since been the sub
ject of controversy. Large cuts were
made to the company's workforce
last year, and a number of ex-em
ployees have complained that Hsu
was an inexperienced and unreason
able manager.
Currier, who left Stanford after
his sophomore year to become a
Thiel Fellow, has avoided such
scrutiny to date. The alternative en
ergy company that he launched in
2010, Black Swan Solar, was in the
first class of StartX, a Stanford-ex
clusive startup accelerator. Currier
cofounded a new company, Campus,
in December of 2012.

of Thiel fellows. They were paid $100,000 to drop out of college for
two years to work full time on a project of interest such as a startup.
