## New chaplain fosters humanist community 
### SARA ORTON 
"Community is really what people are looking for," reflects John Figdor,
the Harvard Divinity School-trained chaplain who joined Stanford this year.
"One of the most beneficial aspects of religion is that sense of community
that you get."

Unlike Stanford s other chaplains, Figdor does not
look to deities in his efforts to counsel and guide
students. Stanford's Humanist Community hired
Figdor, a humanist chaplain who also serves as
the professional leader of Atheists, Humanists,
and Agnostics (AHA!) @ Stanford, at the I
start of the academic year. I
Figdor is the first humanist chaplain to '
work with both the independent off-campus
humanist community and AHA!
He collaborates with AHA!'s student lead-

ership in bringing speakers to campus, facilitating discussions
about religion and planning events for the group.
"AHA! is one part of the humanist community, right now
it is the biggest and most burgeoning part of it," Figdor
said.

Figdor also serves as a counselor to members of the
community, oversees nontheistic weddings, funerals and
baby-naming ceremonies and visits humanists and
nontheists in hospital.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan said that
Figdor serves a community-building role similar to
those of other professional leaders on campus.
"He's done really great in providing for students
the same kind of service that Mychal Copeland, the
rabbi at Hillel, and Father Nathan Castle, the priest
of the Catholic community, have provided for their
communities," McLennan said.
While McLennan equated Figdor's role and
responsibilities with those of on-campus reli-
