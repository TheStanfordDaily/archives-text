## New chaplain fosters humanist community 
### SARA ORTON 
"Community is really what people are looking for," reflects John Figdor,
the Harvard Divinity School-trained chaplain who joined Stanford this year.
"One of the most beneficial aspects of religion is that sense of community
that you get."

Unlike Stanford s other chaplains, Figdor does not
look to deities in his efforts to counsel and guide
students. Stanford's Humanist Community hired
Figdor, a humanist chaplain who also serves as
the professional leader of Atheists, Humanists,
and Agnostics (AHA!) @ Stanford, at the I
start of the academic year. I
Figdor is the first humanist chaplain to '
work with both the independent off-campus
humanist community and AHA!
He collaborates with AHA!'s student lead-

ership in bringing speakers to campus, facilitating discussions
about religion and planning events for the group.
"AHA! is one part of the humanist community, right now
it is the biggest and most burgeoning part of it," Figdor
said.

Figdor also serves as a counselor to members of the
community, oversees nontheistic weddings, funerals and
baby-naming ceremonies and visits humanists and
nontheists in hospital.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan said that
Figdor serves a community-building role similar to
those of other professional leaders on campus.
"He's done really great in providing for students
the same kind of service that Mychal Copeland, the
rabbi at Hillel, and Father Nathan Castle, the priest
of the Catholic community, have provided for their
communities," McLennan said.
While McLennan equated Figdor's role and
responsibilities with those of on-campus reli-

"There is no sense of au
thority that comes from the
religious dogma," said Ar

Having served as Har
vard's humanist chaplain,
Figdor expressed his desire
to emulate Harvard's human
ist community at Stanford,
noting that the West Coast
has a less developed human
ist presence than the East
Coast.
"We want to do every
thing the Harvard group
does and add some more
spice onto it," Figdor said.
So far this year, Figdor
has worked with AHA! to
bring a variety of speakers to
discussion meetings. The

Originally from New
York, Figdor grew up in a
largely secular community
and realized he was an athe
ist at a young age. He studied
philosophy and Russian liter

tending Harvard Divinity

Film Festival in San Francis
co this past summer and en
gages in interfaith discus
sions with religious groups on
campus.
"All too often people think
of atheists as a bunch of an
gry people who get together
and bash religion, and that's
not what we are nor is it what
we should be," Figdor said.
"Ultimately, humanism is
about offering alternatives
different ways of looking at
the world for these folks," he
added.
