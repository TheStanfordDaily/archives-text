## Venture Lab creates global peer classroom 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
High school students in Trinidad and Tobago,
Mends in an Internet cafe in Nairobi, Kenya, and an
elderly couple of 93-year-olds in Germany all share
one experience: they took free online classes through
Stanford's Venture Lab.
Launched last March, the Stanford-developed plat
form for massive open online courses (MOOCs) has at
tracted over 170,000 students from over 150 countries
in just under a year. Based on that success, the plat
form branched out into an independent entity called
NovoEd with the intention of developing national and
international partnerships with other universities.
Unlike other for-profit MOOCs platforms such as
Coursera and Udacity, Venture Lab is a free enter
prise with a focus on peer learning.
"Instead of putting the spotlight on the professors
and pretending that they know all the answers, we put
the spotlight on the students and help them unleash
their own power," said Amin Saberi, director of Ven
ture Lab and CEO of NovoEd.
Venture Lab develops that student power by or
ganizing students taking a specific course into teams
by using factors like geographic proximity and com
mon language. Students earn individual reputation
scores based on their contributions to the team's work,
ultimately creating a new social network through an
online classroom.
