## Venture Lab creates global peer classroom 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
High school students in Trinidad and Tobago,
Mends in an Internet cafe in Nairobi, Kenya, and an
elderly couple of 93-year-olds in Germany all share
one experience: they took free online classes through
Stanford's Venture Lab.
Launched last March, the Stanford-developed plat
form for massive open online courses (MOOCs) has at
tracted over 170,000 students from over 150 countries
in just under a year. Based on that success, the plat
form branched out into an independent entity called
NovoEd with the intention of developing national and
international partnerships with other universities.
Unlike other for-profit MOOCs platforms such as
Coursera and Udacity, Venture Lab is a free enter
prise with a focus on peer learning.
"Instead of putting the spotlight on the professors
and pretending that they know all the answers, we put
the spotlight on the students and help them unleash
their own power," said Amin Saberi, director of Ven
ture Lab and CEO of NovoEd.
Venture Lab develops that student power by or
ganizing students taking a specific course into teams
by using factors like geographic proximity and com
mon language. Students earn individual reputation
scores based on their contributions to the team's work,
ultimately creating a new social network through an
online classroom.
"In this transition from
brick and mortar to online
learning, you shouldn't strip
away the social, the experien
tial or the collaborative aspect
of learning," Saberi said.
Assignments are based on
video lectures by Stanford
faculty posted on the course
site. Students receive a state
ment of accomplishment up
on completing the course.
Farnaz Ronaghi M.S. 'lO
Ph.D. 'l3 said that Venture
Lab's peer focus matches well
with the program's skill
based interactive learning,
just as the mastery-based
learning of Coursera and
Udacity fits their course
models.
Ronaghi helped create
Venture Lab as part of her
Ph.D. focus on online educa
tion and team formation al
gorithms. She had previously
worked with Saberi on a
game theory lab and current
ly works with him as engi

neering manager of NovoEd.
Students' ability to create
their own online personas is
key for developing lasting
collaboration among students
even after the courses close,
according to Ronaghi. There
are at least 100 students still
active per day on each course
site where they can continue
to communicate with their
peers from fall 2012.
The concept for Venture

Lab and subsequently
NovoEd originated in con
versations between Saberi
and Chuck Eesley, assistant
professor of management sci
ence and engineering.
Eesley, whose "Technology
and Entrepreneurship" class
was the first course offered on
the platform, had historically
videotaped his class lectures
and wanted to make them
more accessible to a global au

dience. That task has since be
come a full-time job for Saberi.
"I was actually planning on
having a peaceful and quiet
sabbatical," Saberi said.
Eesley's course introduced
students to the world of start
ups, encouraging them to
form their own through incen
tives. The top 200 teams in the
course were assigned a pro
fessional mentor for their
startup projects and the top
20 teams had the opportunity
to pitch their ideas to venture
capitalists.
Many teams went on to

launch their startups com
mercially. That number in
cludes Tommy Jams a mu
sic-themed start-up based in
India that allows performance
venues to better select their
acts through a fan review sys
tem. The founders of Tommy-
Jams met on Venture Lab,
with two team members re
signing from their jobs at Mi
crosoft to work full time on
their startup project.
As the platform continues
to expand —with 10 courses
scheduled for next quarter, in
cluding some from the Gradu

ate School of Business and the
School of Medicine prob
lems with authenticating stu
dent participants have per
sisted.

Saberi expressed opti
mism that new partnerships
with other universities might
help regulate the platform's
user base, as well as allowing
NovoEd to thrive through an
even broader audience.
"It's been a venture for all
of us," Saberi concluded.
