# RISING TO THE TOP
## CLIMBING JOINS CLUB SPORTS 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
It's just past 10 p.m. at Arrillaga Center for Sports
and Recreation and the climbing wall is buzzing
with activity. On one side, a freshman is hanging
Spiderman-style from the overhanging wall face.
Near the door, two graduate students are double
checking their safety harnesses. All along the walls,
climbers are stretching and contorting themselves to
reach the next hold.
This is practice time for Stanford's newest club sport:
Competitive Climbing. The team was officially approved
last week and will begin competing this weekend at Sono
ma State.
Stanford Competitive Climbing was founded by four
underclassmen, three of whom have extensive climbing
resumes. Freshmen Andy Lamb, Matthew Matera and
Will Roderick and sophomore Lila Neahring worked to
unite the previously scattered community of climbers on
campus.
"One of the motivating factors for creating this team

was a lack of climbing cul- \
ture on campus, at least for
undergraduates," Lamb said. 'O
"One of the aims of the team is
to create an environment where
people have people to climb with, I
practice with and train with and to
be motivated by each other."
The team has a mix of approxi- \
mately 25 climbers ranging from
those who climb recreationally to
those like Lamb, Neahring and Roder-
ick, who have competed on the highest lev-
els internationally.
"It's cool to have everyone working
gether because the more experienced climbers
can give the beginners different insights on
ferent movements or body positions and the
ners can really learn from that," said Matera, who
has been climbing since he was in third grade. "It just

provides a really good envi
ronment for people to get
better and improve."
Two of the most experi
enced members of the team,
Lamb and Roderick, serve as
the team's coaches, develop
ing workouts and giving tips
to the other climbers. Both
climbers, along with
Neahring, are among the
best in the world in their age
groups.
"What Andy and I have
experience in that not every
one else does is competition
and training really hard for
something," Roderick said. "A
lot of people [we met] wanted
to get into that and become
their best at climbing."
Lamb, a native of Lexing
ton, Mass., began climbing
more than ten years ago at a
birthday party.
"Initially, I really hated it
I was scared of heights,"
Lamb said. "But three
months after that, I random
ly asked my dad to go back
and the second time it really
clicked and I got super into
it."
Besides several strong
performances at US Nation
als, Lamb placed 29th in his
age group in sport climbing
at the International Federa
tion of Sport Climbing World
Youth Championships in Sin
gapore last summer.
"Sport climbing is based
on difficulty," Lamb said.
"They'll set a really hard
route that is designed so that
[very few] people will be able
to finish it. Then it's basically
how high you can get each
hold is a point."
Most recently, Lamb
competed in the Pan Amer
ican Championship over
Thanksgiving break. The
freshman earned second in
bouldering a shorter form
of short climbing and
fourth in sport climbing.
"[Climbing] has taken me
to some really cool places,"
Lamb said. "I've been to
Spain three times and all
over the United States. It's a
very shaping experience. It's
formed my identity."
Roderick began climbing
more recently he was in
troduced to the sport by a
friend's dad just five years
ago but he has also
climbed all over the world. In
one memorable attempt to
get a sponsorship photo, the
Berkeley native climbed up
the side of a crumbling an
cient castle in Scotland while
on a family vacation.
"The security guard was
n't too happy about that,"
Roderick joked, "but the pic
ture was cool."
Although Roderick has
competed at US Nationals in
bouldering and sport climb
ing, his specialty is speed
climbing. In 2011, Roderick

placed 20th in speed climbing
at the IFSC World Youth
Championships in Austria.
"It's really cool because
with climbing you can easily
see yourself improving,"
Roderick said. "It's really
fun and casual, so we just
started doing it more and
more and eventually joined a
team and started competing
afterwards."
Lamb and Roderick are
both training for 2013 Na
tionals, which will be held at
the end of February.
Although she is no longer
competing on the national
circuit, Neahring, during
high school, was ranked in
the top six among Americans
her age in both bouldering
and sport climbing. The
sophomore from Oregon
placed 38th in sport climbing
at the 2011 World Youth
Championships.
The Stanford team will be
competing much closer to
home as part of US Climb
ing's Collegiate Climbing Se
ries. The four founders
worked with Stanford Out
door Education and Club
Sports to become an official
ly recognized campus organ
ization.
"The other co-founders
and I had the idea pretty ear
ly in the fall and it came to
fruition in winter quarter,"
Lamb said. "It's definitely
been a process. All of the
presidents have been learn
ing how the system works. It
can take a while to get stuff
done and it can be a little bit
frustrating, but it's definitely
worth it in the end."
The team may hire a
coach once it becomes more
established, but for now,
Lamb and Roderick plan to
continue leading practices.
Climbing workouts are often
designed like running work
outs, with a warm-up and
core exercises bracketing
different types of interval ex
ercises. Roderick said that
the Stanford team's work
outs aren't as intense as the
ones the US team goes
through, although he and
Lamb lead similar exercises.
"We'll either train laps or
we'll do certain exercises
where you try to perfect
your technique as you go up
the wall, like making no
sound," Roderick said. "Or
we do various strength
based or move-based exer
cises."
On this Tuesday night,
the team is doing a drill in
which each climber has to
hover above each hold for
five seconds. According to
Neahring, the last practice
involved "route suicides," in
which the athletes climb one
third of the way up and down
a designated route, then two
thirds and then all the way to
the top of a route and down.
"We basically do things
that make you really tired,"
Neahring laughed.
One notable absence from
the regimen is weight train

ing with free weights or ma
chines. Although climbers
have to be strong enough to
pull and hold themselves up,
they also need to maintain
flexibility.
"It's generally easier to
get hurt with weight train
ing," Roderick said. "Since so
much relies on your tendons
and your bones and every
thing staying together and
not getting hurt, it's just bet
ter to do body weight."
Now that practices have
officially started, all four
founders say the enthusiasm
is more than they expected.
"I had met some of [the
other climbers] at the climb
ing gym before, but it's great
to have twice a week where
you see them all the time,"
Matera said. "For me being a
freshman, it's been a great
way to meet some of the up
perclassmen and people that
have similar interests."
"One of the requirements
for club sports is having
twelve people and at first we
were concerned that we
couldn't get that many peo
ple dedicated enough to go to
competitions," Neahring
said. "That hasn't been a
problem at all so far we're
really excited about the num
ber of people who are show
ing up and a lot of people
have kept showing up."
In fact, one of the biggest
problems that the team faces
is finding enough space for
all the climbers in the Arril
laga gym. The group supple
ments on-campus workouts
with trips to various gyms in
the area, but it is looking for
ward to the new, larger
climbing gym that is sched
uled to open near Roble next
September.
"So many different
ranges of abilities come into
[Arrillaga] that they don't
have room to represent each
climbing grade that much
and you end up doing the
same routes each time if
you're trying to do in a cer
tain range," Neahring said.
"When there's more variety
of routes there are a lot more
training possibilities."
The team's first official
competition is on Feb. 23. For
now, the team will focus on
the Collegiate Climbing Se
ries and local Bay Area
events, but the co-founders
hope to bring team members
to regionals and nationals in
the future.
Though the organization
now has competitions on the
calendar, the group mentality
isn't going to change.
"It's kind of funny to
think that we are a competi
tive climbing team, because
climbing isn't super competi
tive as a sport," Matera said.
"So even though it's competi
tive climbing, everyone is
trying to benefit from it and
learn from each other and el
evate the sport as a whole."

to finish it. Then it's basically
how high you can get each
hold is a point."
Most recently, Lamb
competed in the Pan Amer
ican Championship over
Thanksgiving break. The
freshman earned second in
bouldering a shorter form
of short climbing and
fourth in sport climbing.
"[Climbing] has taken me
to some really cool places,"
Lamb said. "I've been to
Spain three times and all
over the United States. It's a
very shaping experience. It's
formed my identity."
Roderick began climbing
more recently he was in
troduced to the sport by a
friend's dad just five years
ago but he has also
climbed all over the world. In
one memorable attempt to
get a sponsorship photo, the
Berkeley native climbed up
the side of a crumbling an
cient castle in Scotland while
on a family vacation.
"The security guard was
n't too happy about that,"
Roderick joked, "but the pic
ture was cool."
Although Roderick has
competed at US Nationals in
bouldering and sport climb
ing, his specialty is speed
climbing. In 2011, Roderick

placed 20th in speed climbing
at the IFSC World Youth
Championships in Austria.
"It's really cool because
with climbing you can easily
see yourself improving,"
Roderick said. "It's really
fun and casual, so we just
started doing it more and
more and eventually joined a
team and started competing
afterwards."
Lamb and Roderick are
both training for 2013 Na
tionals, which will be held at
the end of February.
Although she is no longer
competing on the national
circuit, Neahring, during
high school, was ranked in
the top six among Americans
her age in both bouldering
and sport climbing. The
sophomore from Oregon
placed 38th in sport climbing
at the 2011 World Youth
Championships.
The Stanford team will be
competing much closer to
home as part of US Climb
ing's Collegiate Climbing Se
ries. The four founders
worked with Stanford Out
door Education and Club
Sports to become an official
ly recognized campus organ
ization.
"The other co-founders
and I had the idea pretty ear
ly in the fall and it came to
fruition in winter quarter,"
Lamb said. "It's definitely
been a process. All of the
presidents have been learn
ing how the system works. It
can take a while to get stuff
done and it can be a little bit
frustrating, but it's definitely
worth it in the end."
The team may hire a
coach once it becomes more
established, but for now,
Lamb and Roderick plan to
continue leading practices.
Climbing workouts are often
designed like running work
outs, with a warm-up and
core exercises bracketing
different types of interval ex
ercises. Roderick said that
the Stanford team's work
outs aren't as intense as the
ones the US team goes
through, although he and
Lamb lead similar exercises.
"We'll either train laps or
we'll do certain exercises
where you try to perfect
your technique as you go up
the wall, like making no
sound," Roderick said. "Or
we do various strength
based or move-based exer
cises."
On this Tuesday night,
the team is doing a drill in
which each climber has to
hover above each hold for
five seconds. According to
Neahring, the last practice
involved "route suicides," in
which the athletes climb one
third of the way up and down
a designated route, then two
thirds and then all the way to
the top of a route and down.
"We basically do things
that make you really tired,"
Neahring laughed.
One notable absence from
the regimen is weight train

ing with free weights or ma
chines. Although climbers
have to be strong enough to
pull and hold themselves up,
they also need to maintain
flexibility.
"It's generally easier to
get hurt with weight train
ing," Roderick said. "Since so
much relies on your tendons
and your bones and every
thing staying together and
not getting hurt, it's just bet
ter to do body weight."
Now that practices have
officially started, all four
founders say the enthusiasm
is more than they expected.
"I had met some of [the
other climbers] at the climb
ing gym before, but it's great
to have twice a week where
you see them all the time,"
Matera said. "For me being a
freshman, it's been a great
way to meet some of the up
perclassmen and people that
have similar interests."
"One of the requirements
for club sports is having
twelve people and at first we
were concerned that we
couldn't get that many peo
ple dedicated enough to go to
competitions," Neahring
said. "That hasn't been a
problem at all so far we're
really excited about the num
ber of people who are show
ing up and a lot of people
have kept showing up."
In fact, one of the biggest
problems that the team faces
is finding enough space for
all the climbers in the Arril
laga gym. The group supple
ments on-campus workouts
with trips to various gyms in
the area, but it is looking for
ward to the new, larger
climbing gym that is sched
uled to open near Roble next
September.
"So many different
ranges of abilities come into
[Arrillaga] that they don't
have room to represent each
climbing grade that much
and you end up doing the
same routes each time if
you're trying to do in a cer
tain range," Neahring said.
"When there's more variety
of routes there are a lot more
training possibilities."
The team's first official
competition is on Feb. 23. For
now, the team will focus on
the Collegiate Climbing Se
ries and local Bay Area
events, but the co-founders
hope to bring team members
to regionals and nationals in
the future.
Though the organization
now has competitions on the
calendar, the group mentality
isn't going to change.
"It's kind of funny to
think that we are a competi
tive climbing team, because
climbing isn't super competi
tive as a sport," Matera said.
"So even though it's competi
tive climbing, everyone is
trying to benefit from it and
learn from each other and el
evate the sport as a whole."

It's just past 10 p.m. at Arrillaga Center for Sports
and Recreation and the climbing wall is buzzing
with activity. On one side, a freshman is hanging
Spiderman-style from the overhanging wall face.
Near the door, two graduate students are double
checking their safety harnesses. All along the walls,
climbers are stretching and contorting themselves to
reach the next hold.
This is practice time for Stanford's newest club sport:
Competitive Climbing. The team was officially approved
last week and will begin competing this weekend at Sono
ma State.
Stanford Competitive Climbing was founded by four
underclassmen, three of whom have extensive climbing
resumes. Freshmen Andy Lamb, Matthew Matera and
Will Roderick and sophomore Lila Neahring worked to
unite the previously scattered community of climbers on
campus.
"One of the motivating factors for creating this team

was a lack of climbing cul- \
ture on campus, at least for
undergraduates," Lamb said. 'O
"One of the aims of the team is
to create an environment where
people have people to climb with, I
practice with and train with and to
be motivated by each other."
The team has a mix of approxi- \
mately 25 climbers ranging from
those who climb recreationally to
those like Lamb, Neahring and Roder-
ick, who have competed on the highest lev-
els internationally.
"It's cool to have everyone working
gether because the more experienced climbers
can give the beginners different insights on
ferent movements or body positions and the
ners can really learn from that," said Matera, who
has been climbing since he was in third grade. "It just

provides a really good envi
ronment for people to get
better and improve."
Two of the most experi
enced members of the team,
Lamb and Roderick, serve as
the team's coaches, develop
ing workouts and giving tips
to the other climbers. Both
climbers, along with
Neahring, are among the
best in the world in their age
groups.
"What Andy and I have
experience in that not every
one else does is competition
and training really hard for
something," Roderick said. "A
lot of people [we met] wanted
to get into that and become
their best at climbing."
Lamb, a native of Lexing
ton, Mass., began climbing
more than ten years ago at a
birthday party.
"Initially, I really hated it
I was scared of heights,"
Lamb said. "But three
months after that, I random
ly asked my dad to go back
and the second time it really
clicked and I got super into
it."
Besides several strong
performances at US Nation
als, Lamb placed 29th in his
age group in sport climbing
at the International Federa
tion of Sport Climbing World
Youth Championships in Sin
gapore last summer.
"Sport climbing is based
on difficulty," Lamb said.
"They'll set a really hard
route that is designed so that
[very few] people will be able
to finish it. Then it's basically
how high you can get each
hold is a point."

ones the US team goes
through, although he and
Lamb lead similar exercises.
"We'll either train laps or
we'll do certain exercises
where you try to perfect
your technique as you go up
the wall, like making no
sound," Roderick said. "Or
we do various strength
based or move-based exer
cises."
On this Tuesday night,
the team is doing a drill in
which each climber has to
hover above each hold for
five seconds. According to
Neahring, the last practice
involved "route suicides," in
which the athletes climb one
third of the way up and down
a designated route, then two
thirds and then all the way to
the top of a route and down.
"We basically do things
that make you really tired,"
Neahring laughed.
One notable absence from
the regimen is weight train

ing with free weights or ma
chines. Although climbers
have to be strong enough to
pull and hold themselves up,
they also need to maintain
flexibility.
"It's generally easier to
get hurt with weight train
ing," Roderick said. "Since so
much relies on your tendons
and your bones and every
thing staying together and
not getting hurt, it's just bet
ter to do body weight."
Now that practices have
officially started, all four
founders say the enthusiasm
is more than they expected.
"I had met some of [the
other climbers] at the climb
ing gym before, but it's great
to have twice a week where
you see them all the time,"
Matera said. "For me being a
freshman, it's been a great
way to meet some of the up
perclassmen and people that
have similar interests."
"One of the requirements
for club sports is having
twelve people and at first we
were concerned that we
couldn't get that many peo
ple dedicated enough to go to
competitions," Neahring
said. "That hasn't been a
problem at all so far we're
really excited about the num
ber of people who are show
ing up and a lot of people
have kept showing up."
In fact, one of the biggest
problems that the team faces
is finding enough space for
all the climbers in the Arril
laga gym. The group supple
ments on-campus workouts
with trips to various gyms in
the area, but it is looking for
ward to the new, larger
climbing gym that is sched
uled to open near Roble next
September.
"So many different
ranges of abilities come into
[Arrillaga] that they don't
have room to represent each
climbing grade that much
and you end up doing the
same routes each time if
you're trying to do in a cer
tain range," Neahring said.
"When there's more variety
of routes there are a lot more
training possibilities."
The team's first official
competition is on Feb. 23. For
now, the team will focus on
the Collegiate Climbing Se
ries and local Bay Area
events, but the co-founders
hope to bring team members
to regionals and nationals in
the future.
Though the organization
now has competitions on the
calendar, the group mentality
isn't going to change.
"It's kind of funny to
think that we are a competi
tive climbing team, because
climbing isn't super competi
tive as a sport," Matera said.
"So even though it's competi
tive climbing, everyone is
trying to benefit from it and
learn from each other and el
evate the sport as a whole."
