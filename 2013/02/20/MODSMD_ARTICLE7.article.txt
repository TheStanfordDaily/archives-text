## Applicant codes to wow Admissions 
### KIANA HUI 
In his application for Stanford's Class of
2017, Alex Greene took the Apple motto
"There's an app for that" to a whole new lev
el.
Greene, a 17-year-old Stanford hopeful from
New York, created an iPhone application for
the Office of Undergraduate Admission in an
effort to demonstrate his passion for computer
science, his intended major. His app has
prompted features by The Huffington Post and
Gigaom, as well as several other technology
blogs.
Though the app is not available in the App
Store, Greene's YouThbe demo of the app has
been viewed more than 15,500 times. In the de
mo, Greene clicks through the app's different
pages, which describe his interests and make
his case for admission.
"Stanford has the most interesting courses
I've ever seen," Greene said. "The whole atmos
phere seems more laid-back and entrepreneur
ial. Everyone is doing something cool and cre
ative, and I want to be a part of that."
Greene said he has been developing apps for
three years and made this particular app using
Photoshop and Xcode, an iOS development pro
gram for iPhone apps. Since he could not sub
mit the app through the traditional Stanford
application process, he posted it on Reddit, Col
lege Confidential and Hacker News among
other websites —in the hope of attracting
Stanford admissions officers' attention.
"When I saw the first article on it, I was just
amazed," Greene said. "A few days later, it came
out on The Huffington Post, and I was just
speechless."
Chris Gerben, a lecturer in the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric, was one of the first at
Stanford to take note of Greene's work,

retweeting the Huffington
Post article. "I was
really impressed with him,"
Gerben said. "It was the
fact that he had this idea, he
executed it and then he has
random people like me find
ing it online and getting ex
cited about it. That's the
most impressive thing."

Greene saw that Gerben had retweeted the
article and messaged him within minutes.
"Now we have this sort of quasi-relation
ship," Gerben said. "The fact that I'm on the
record now as sort of endorsing him I think
it's really savvy the way he's following the peo
ple who are following the story."
Keith Schwarz 'lO M.S. 'll, a lecturer in
computer science (CS), found Greene's app on
Hacker News.
"I thought it was definitely an interesting
way to signal that he is interested in Stanford
CS," Schwarz said. "I'm glad that someone is
taking the initiative to do something like that."
Although Schwarz said that Greene "clearly
put a lot of time and effort" into the app, he em
phasized that there is a difference between
making iPhone apps and excelling in academic
coursework.
The app has received criticism from
You Tube commenters, some of whom have
questioned whether or not it is complicated
enough to demonstrate skill in computer sci
ence. Greene, however, expressed pride in his
work.
"The app wasn't meant to be overly techni
cal — it was just meant to show an interest,"
Greene said.
Though the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission would neither confirm nor deny that it
had seen Greene's app, Director of Admission
Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO said that other applicants
have submitted apps in the past.
Lim added that because of the high volume
of applications that admissions officers receive,
they are not always able to look at supplemen
tary information such as Greene's app.
Whether or not the admissions office has
seen the app, Greene expressed gratitude for
the coverage it has received.
"I would like to thank all the press and
everyone who has commented, positively or
negatively, for the feedback," Greene said. "It's
been pretty awesome whether or not I get in."
