### — lleana Najarro 
In an unprecedented display of fundraising
prowess, Stanford has become the first college
to raise more than $1 billion in a single year, ac
cording to a survey conducted by the Council for
Aid to Education.

The University raised $1,035 billion last year,
46 percent more than the 2011 fiscal year's $709
million total and significantly more than its 2006
record of $9ll million. Stanford also outpaced
peer institutions by a significant margin. Har
vard and Yale came second and third, collecting
$650 million and $544 million respectively.
Last year marked the eighth straight year

Stanford ranked first in the Council's annual col
lege fundraising survey.
Stanford saw a rise in donations after the
2012 completion of the five-year Stanford Chal
lenge —which raised $6.2 billion in total and
after the launch of the $1 billion Campaign for
Stanford Medicine.
According to a report by the Associated
Press, Stanford's record-breaking fundraising
efforts were due in part to the efforts of 79,000
donors. Notable donations include a $lOO million
gift from Silicon Valley investor Robert King '6O
and his wife Dorothy to the Graduate School of
Business.
"Higher education for most people repre
sents hope for a better future, and donors want
to invest in that," said Martin Shell, vice pres
ident for development, in the report.
