## Stanford catches viral Harlem Shake' fever 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Everybody's seen the video. Surround
ed by people going about their everyday
lives, one masked dancer pumps to
Baauer's sudden hit. The music drops, and
everything goes crazy.
The viral sensation, which spawned
over 40,000 imitations, has become im
mensely popular at Stanford as well, with
student groups posting at least 15 versions
of the video online.
The Class of 2016 has been the most ac
tive, with several freshman dorms filming
versions of the video. Surprisingly, howev
er, it wasn't always the freshmen that led
the shenanigans.
"We did the Harlem Shake video be
cause my SLERT (SLE resident tutor)
said that he wanted to make a video, and I
decided to organize [the Harlem Shake],"
said Liam Kinney 'l6.
Kinney rallied fellow Structured Liber
al Education (SLE) students and helped
shoot the video, which featured a lecture
and a prominently placed pink bathrobe.
When he is not choreographing, Kin
ney is a Daily staffer.
Despite the craze's sensational nature,
SLE students attributed great depth and
meaning to the 30-second video clips.
"The dance felt like a living embodi
ment of random Brownian motion," said
Noah Friedman 'l6. "[I had] never felt so
alive, part of an organism, living, pulsat
ing, shaking Harlem Shaking."
To The Daily's knowledge, Gregory
Watkins 'B5 Ph.D. 'O3, SLE assistant direc
tor, is the only faculty member to join in on
the Harlem Shake. Watkins explained that
he was impressed by the excitement gen

eratecl by the video.
"The experience was fun," he said.
"When I watch it, I enjoy it, just because it
shows a sense of spirit."

Otero, a freshman dorm in Wilbur,
made a video of its own, one of the few to
feature almost an entire a residence hall.
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4, an Otero resident as
sistant, said that he suggested making a
video because of how entertaining Harlem
Shake clips were.
"I thought it was the funniest thing
that I had seen," he said. "I had personal
ly found out about the video craze, and
then I decided to organize one for Otero.
We filmed last Wednesday, and it got us
great attendance at dorm meeting."
The Stanford men's gymnastics team
posted one of Stanford's most popular
spin-offs. The video, featuring suspended
gymnasts and a fly-by on a bike, had se
cured almost 7,000 views at time of publi
cation.
"We, like everyone else, saw the videos
being posted and realized that the gym
would be cool," said Jordan Nolff 'l4,
one of the team's captains. "It was a lot
of fun making it and thinking of the
wackiest things we could do. We tried to
get a golf cart to drive in the gym but
couldn't find one and decided to use a bike
instead."
The most viewed and oldest clip the
Stanford Harlem Shakes was performed
at Dance Marathon and mustered almost
10,000 views. The video was part of Dance
Marathon's publicity campaign for the
event, which ultimately raised over $60,000
to combat HIV/AIDS.
