## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY How Alumni Donations Narrow the Mind 
### Adam Johnson 
Last year, Stanford raised over
one billion dollars in dona
tions from roughly 80,000
donors, many of whom are alumni
of the University. That, needless to
say, is a considerable sum of money
it should prove invaluable in
funding faculty positions, research,
financial aid and construction.
At first glance, it appears as if
these alumni donations can only be
of benefit to the University and its
students. But I wonder if the na
ture of alumni donations, and Stan
ford's increasing reliance on them
to fund its institutional goals, is in
herently in conflict with an institu
tion of higher learning founded to
promote, among other values, the
"cultivation and enlargement of the
mind."
To help explore this dilemma, it
is beneficial to look at what factors
may predict alumni donations. Ac
cording to the research literature
on this topic, donations are corre
lated with a few factors: the alum
nus remaining in close contact with
the University (either through
physical location or proximity to
major alumni networks), the alum
nus having a positive experience
while a student, and the alumnus
possessing the financial assets to
afford a gift to his alma mater.
While Stanford undergraduates
are diverse in background and in
terests, many of them roughly fit
into one of two categories: those
well inside the establishment and
those more on its borders. The for
mer disapproves of general educa
tion requirements (GERs) because
they interfere with his major, he
sees little reason to question vari
ous aspects of his and his peers' col
lege experience, and he pursues
summer internships or other pres
tigious work in a linear process that
culminates in a well-paid job offer.
The latter disapproves of GERs
because they can be gamed, he ex
presses concern regarding various
administrative policies and prac
tices, and his post-Stanford trajec
tory is ambiguous.
While I do not think any student
fits perfectly into either characteri
zation, we should ask ourselves
which student Stanford, given its
substantial reliance on alumni do
nations, would prefer. The answer
is obvious; the establishment stu
dent almost always ends up with a
high-salaried job in, if not the Bay
Area, another major metropolitan
area with a strong alumni base. He
ostensibly benefits from his high
socioeconomic status and Stan
ford's role in getting him there, and
thus he has little reason to question
either. The more of these students
Stanford churns out, the more do
nations will flow back in.
How can Stanford produce
these students? For one, it can em
phasize science, technology, engi
neering and medicine (STEM)
fields over the arts and humanities;
the former provides students with
the skills that society throws mon
ey at and removes opportunities for
students to critically reflect on the
relationship between what is finan
cially valued and what is actually
valuable.
While I enjoy my engineering
classes, we have rarely examined
the role that technology plays in in
fluencing humanity and the earth.
Perhaps if we did more of that, my
cohorts would be less likely to work
for, say, Apple or Shell. They would
also be less likely to make money.
Suddenly, Stanford's decision to
modify the three-quarter Introduc
tion to the Humanities (IHUM) se
quence into a one-quarter course
that can be satisfied with a STEM-

focused class makes perfect sense.
Decreasing the number of required
humanities classes not only allows
more students to major in STEM
fields but also diminishes the im
portance of a liberal education.
To churn out wealthy alumni,
Stanford can also house a career
counseling system biased towards
high-salary jobs. Enter the CDC's
tiered-services practice. For paying
anywhere from $2,000 to $lO,OOO a
year to become one of three "part
ner" levels, companies can gain in
creasing access to students. A table
at a typical career fair, too, has a
cost upwards of $l,OOO.
Almost invariably, the compa
nies that participate are large firms
in finance, consulting, or tech. By
charging a high premium to access
Stanford students, the CDC thus
reduces the opportunity for "non
traditional" and/or lower-paying
employers to enter the fold. While I
doubt this is an active plot to funnel
students into certain careers (the
CDC is able to bring in hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year by
charging for access), the adminis
tration's compliance in letting these
practices continue is telling.
And let us not forget Stanford's
incentive to ensure that its students
are happy and thus likely to give
back. At first, this doesn't appear
wrong; what's the matter with fos
tering a happy environment? But
we must remember that happiness
can often be superficial and is not
synonymous with expansion of the
mind; as one learns more about the
world, one generally becomes more
critical of the injustices it presents.
Enter the Stanford bubble,
which ensures that students spend
a majority of their time being pro
vided for in a perfectly manicured
environment that offers little room
for creative self-expression. This
artificial environment relegates
earnest intellectual and artistic dis
course to the margins.
I have not even mentioned the
fact that many alumni gifts are tied
to certain projects or faculty posi
tions; the wealthiest donors, then,
can exercise a considerable degree
of influence. It becomes a self-ful
filling prophecy Stanford's
wealthiest donors often come from
the tech world and help fund
STEM departments, thereby cre
ating even more wealthy alumni
likely to give back to the STEM
departments that once housed
them. Over time, this will shift
the University away from the lib
eral education model upon which it
was founded. Some say it already
has.
I do not mean to imply that ad
ministrators explicitly ask them
selves how they can modify the
University-undergraduate inter
face to increase donations. But with
alumni gifts comprising more than
a fifth of university revenue, it is
only natural to ask how these dona
tions, and the solicitation of them,
conflict with the purposes of higher
education.
By lessening liberal education
requirements, by being content
with a career counseling service
that favors firms who can afford to
offer high salaries, by holding un
dergraduates' hands to make sure
we are happy at least on the surface
and by allowing gifts to be tied to
the donors' wishes, Stanford propa
gates a system that serves to nar
row the mind, not cultivate it. Sure,
the money will keep rolling in, but
at what cost?

wealthiest donors often come from
the tech world and help fund
STEM departments, thereby cre

the University away from the lib

was founded. Some say it already
has.
I do not mean to imply that ad

alumni gifts comprising more than
a fifth of university revenue, it is

conflict with the purposes of higher
education.

requirements, by being content
with a career counseling service

row the mind, not cultivate it. Sure,
the money will keep rolling in, but
at what cost?

Last year, Stanford raised over
one billion dollars in dona
tions from roughly 80,000
donors, many of whom are alumni
of the University. That, needless to
say, is a considerable sum of money
it should prove invaluable in
funding faculty positions, research,
financial aid and construction.
At first glance, it appears as if
these alumni donations can only be
of benefit to the University and its
students. But I wonder if the na
ture of alumni donations, and Stan
ford's increasing reliance on them
to fund its institutional goals, is in
herently in conflict with an institu
tion of higher learning founded to
promote, among other values, the
"cultivation and enlargement of the
mind."
To help explore this dilemma, it
is beneficial to look at what factors
may predict alumni donations. Ac
cording to the research literature
on this topic, donations are corre
lated with a few factors: the alum
nus remaining in close contact with
the University (either through
physical location or proximity to
major alumni networks), the alum
nus having a positive experience
while a student, and the alumnus
possessing the financial assets to
afford a gift to his alma mater.
While Stanford undergraduates
are diverse in background and in
terests, many of them roughly fit
into one of two categories: those
well inside the establishment and
those more on its borders. The for
mer disapproves of general educa
tion requirements (GERs) because
they interfere with his major, he
sees little reason to question vari
ous aspects of his and his peers' col
lege experience, and he pursues
summer internships or other pres
tigious work in a linear process that
culminates in a well-paid job offer.
The latter disapproves of GERs
because they can be gamed, he ex
presses concern regarding various
administrative policies and prac
tices, and his post-Stanford trajec
tory is ambiguous.
While I do not think any student
fits perfectly into either characteri
zation, we should ask ourselves
which student Stanford, given its
substantial reliance on alumni do
nations, would prefer. The answer
is obvious; the establishment stu
dent almost always ends up with a
high-salaried job in, if not the Bay
Area, another major metropolitan
area with a strong alumni base. He
ostensibly benefits from his high
socioeconomic status and Stan
ford's role in getting him there, and
thus he has little reason to question
either. The more of these students
Stanford churns out, the more do
nations will flow back in.
How can Stanford produce
these students? For one, it can em
phasize science, technology, engi
neering and medicine (STEM)
fields over the arts and humanities;
the former provides students with
the skills that society throws mon
ey at and removes opportunities for
students to critically reflect on the
relationship between what is finan
cially valued and what is actually
valuable.
While I enjoy my engineering
classes, we have rarely examined
the role that technology plays in in
fluencing humanity and the earth.
Perhaps if we did more of that, my
cohorts would be less likely to work
for, say, Apple or Shell. They would
also be less likely to make money.
Suddenly, Stanford's decision to
modify the three-quarter Introduc
tion to the Humanities (IHUM) se
quence into a one-quarter course
that can be satisfied with a STEM-

focused class makes perfect sense.
Decreasing the number of required
humanities classes not only allows
more students to major in STEM
fields but also diminishes the im
portance of a liberal education.
To churn out wealthy alumni,
Stanford can also house a career
counseling system biased towards
high-salary jobs. Enter the CDC's
tiered-services practice. For paying
anywhere from $2,000 to $lO,OOO a
year to become one of three "part
ner" levels, companies can gain in
creasing access to students. A table
at a typical career fair, too, has a
cost upwards of $l,OOO.
Almost invariably, the compa
nies that participate are large firms
in finance, consulting, or tech. By
charging a high premium to access
Stanford students, the CDC thus
reduces the opportunity for "non
traditional" and/or lower-paying
employers to enter the fold. While I
doubt this is an active plot to funnel
students into certain careers (the
CDC is able to bring in hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year by
charging for access), the adminis
tration's compliance in letting these
practices continue is telling.
And let us not forget Stanford's
incentive to ensure that its students
are happy and thus likely to give
back. At first, this doesn't appear
wrong; what's the matter with fos
tering a happy environment? But
we must remember that happiness
can often be superficial and is not
synonymous with expansion of the
mind; as one learns more about the
world, one generally becomes more
critical of the injustices it presents.
Enter the Stanford bubble,
which ensures that students spend
a majority of their time being pro
vided for in a perfectly manicured
environment that offers little room
for creative self-expression. This
artificial environment relegates
earnest intellectual and artistic dis
course to the margins.
I have not even mentioned the
fact that many alumni gifts are tied

tions; the wealthiest donors, then,
can exercise a considerable degree
of influence. It becomes a self-ful
filling prophecy Stanford's
