Moreover, several student managers report
ed that ResEd officials have argued that the
four Suites chefs are overpaid. But last year's
chef contract reveals that an academic year's
pay for a chef at Suites in 2011-12 was $51,182.
That's hardly a gold mine in the Bay Area - let
alone Palo Alto—especially since ResEd, ac
cording to Avanti chef Tony, already mandated
a wage freeze for Suites chefs three years ago,

MEHMEI INONU/The stanford Daily
Bollard head chef Frank Hassan is famous for his breakfast and his connection with Suites
residents. Frank keeps letters from formaer students tucked away in his blue Lincoin.


143 of 149 Suites residents surveyed disapproved of Res Ed's decision to contract management
of the formerly student-run Suites Dining to an outside corporation.


The Governors Corner Dining Societies, student-run since 1982, are set to be token over by on outside corporation storting next year.


Avonti head chef Anton "Tony" Dietz has served Suites residents for 18 years. Born in
Germany in 1946, he has previously catered White House functions and Hollywood premieres.
