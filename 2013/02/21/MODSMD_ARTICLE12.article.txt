MEHMEI INONU/The stanford Daily
Bollard head chef Frank Hassan is famous for his breakfast and his connection with Suites
residents. Frank keeps letters from formaer students tucked away in his blue Lincoin.


143 of 149 Suites residents surveyed disapproved of Res Ed's decision to contract management
of the formerly student-run Suites Dining to an outside corporation.


The Governors Corner Dining Societies, student-run since 1982, are set to be token over by on outside corporation storting next year.


Avonti head chef Anton "Tony" Dietz has served Suites residents for 18 years. Born in
Germany in 1946, he has previously catered White House functions and Hollywood premieres.
"If you don't treat your employ
ees well," she reflected with thinly
veiled anger about Frank's mistreat
ment under SOS, "they're going to
find another job."
Frank, in typical fashion, only ex
presses concerns about his students,
and especially about what might
happen to them after an SOS
takeover at Suites next year.
"One thing I know for sure," he
said, "is they [SOS] don't care
about the students."
"Not at all?"
"At all. Just money."
Suites Dining is the largest re
maining student-run, independent
eating location on campus, with ap
proximately 260 residents and an
annual operating budget of over
$l.l million. Whichever company
wins that contract next year will be
flush with cash cash ResEd re
quires students to pay, and cash
from which any for-profit corpora
tion will skim significant fees.
If the past is any indication of
the future, that corporation will
likely be SOS.
The entanglement between
Stanford's Office of Residential Ed
ucation and SOS is complex and
runs deep. When I contacted Peters
to request a personal interview for
this story, he declined to speak with
me and referred me instead to
Buzay in ResEd, who handles all of
SOS's media inquiries.
Boswell mentioned in our inter
view that he himself was "connect
ed" to SOS, but doesn't specify how.
Sargeant, the onetime General
Manager of SEC and Peters' broth
er-in-law, was still reluctant to talk.
"I believe that Aaron and Nate
can provide you with all the infor
mation requested," he wrote in re
sponse to my emailed request for
an interview.
When Avanti chef Tony said
there's "something insidious about
this whole thing," these are the
kind of connections that support his
suspicion. Wessells, the former
Avanti financial manager, speculat
ed that money might be changing
hands somewhere.
"What it smells of to me is basi
cally that there are people in the
University that have their own mo
tives," Wessells mused. "And
whether they stand to profit from
taking over the clubs ... maybe that
could be the case."

Despite Golder's assertion that
a "University-required" bidding
process governs the selection of
contracted vendors for student res

idences, SOS did not have to com
petitively bid to manage the Row
for over 15 years.
The first year for which ResEd
held a bidding process for Row
management was 2011-12. In the
year after receiving that bid ac
cording to members of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC), a
student-led workers' advocacy
group SOS slashed Row work
ers' health benefits by half and re-

dueed their bonuses from $l,OOO to
a maximum of $4O.
Stanford's Living Wage Policy
states clearly that workers on cam
pus shall have "the right to self-or
ganization, to form, join, or assist
labor organizations, to bargain col
lectively ... and to engage in other
concerted activities for the purpose
of collective bargaining or other
mutual aid or protection."
But when SLAC held a Worker-
Student Council meeting on Jan.
16, 2012, to provide a "safe space"
for workers seeking relief from
SOS benefit cuts advertised in
both Spanish and English
Sargeant, a ResEd employee,
barged in without introducing him
self a few minutes into the meeting,
accused the workers of organizing a
strike (which SLAC had never dis
cussed) and "intimidated" the
workers into silence.
"They seemed to know who he
was," recalled SLAC member Lau
rel Fish 'l4. "His accusations were
very aggressive."
"We tried to have a conversation
with [the workers]," Fish remem

bered, "but it was clear that they
weren't expressing their concerns
and didn't feel like they could talk
openly."
It remains unclear why a ResEd
administrator interfered in a pri
vate meeting of workers contracted
by a third-party corporation and
why ResEd paid so little attention
to the Living Wage Policy's protec
tion of "the right to self-organiza
tion."

SOS's financial operations for
the Row are almost completely
opaque to house residents. When I
met with a Row financial manager
to go over his house's finances, he
was surprised to learn that Suites
residents have full and transparent
access to their entire board bill.
ResEd, he said, takes all the money
from his residents' room and board
payment, gives him about $B5O per
resident per quarter to spend on ei
ther food or social dues and doesn't
tell him what they do with the rest.
"Even as a financial manager, I
don't see where half the student
money goes," he said.
I end up having to go directly to
Buzay for that information. The
numbers, which Row financial man
agers never see, are clear.

Total board bill costs in Suites
and on the Row are almost exactly
the same $5,999 per year for
Suites residents and $5,992 for resi
dents on the Row. But there's one
major difference: Governor's Cor
ner Dining Societies deliver seven
more meals per week than Row
houses at almost exactly the same

price.
Row residents receive 10 meals a
week, typically lunch and dinner
Monday through Friday. Suites res
idents, by contrast, get 17: every
thing the Row provides, including
open kitchen and snacks, plus a
custom-cooked Frank breakfast ex
travaganza every morning and
brunch and dinner on Sundays.
Suites student managers pro
vide those seven extra meals, more
over, on a lower food budget. GCDS
spends about $5O less per quarter
per student on food than SOS (an
average of $726 for GCDS and $775
for SOS). And they provide those
meals —as any student who has
had Dennis' lobster, Prank's filet
mignon sandwiches, Caroline's
Mexican or Tony's chocolate
mousse can tell you without
compromising quality, a feat Tony
says he accomplishes by buying on
ly "what's seasonal and freshly
available" and "minimizing or elim
inating waste." That's not even in
cluding the quarterly Gala Dinners
and Special Dinners every Suites
eating club delivers or the spring
quarter Suites-wide Special Party,
for which student managers bring
in live music, ice sculptures and en
tertainment.

And as a student-run nonprofit,
all the money Suites saves on food
goes to better pay for student hash
ers and their chefs, rather than the

bank account of a for-profit compa
ny.

Frank made $9OO per week for
33 weeks of work about $29,700
annually when he first started at
SOS. He makes $20,000 more than
that at Suites, plus 100 percent cov
erage of his (and his dependents')
healthcare and dental costs.

In "Hiring a Chef," the sample
advertisement SOS CEO Peters
encourages student managers on
the Row to post when searching for
new chefs, Peters suggests pay of
"$BOO/week DOE [depending on ex
perience] + negotiable benefits."
That's $26,400 per year about
half what Suites chefs make.
Part-time student hashers at
Suites make $l5 an hour and used
to make even more before ResEd
enforced pay cuts took their toll.
Even after the ResEd pay cuts,
Suites hashers still make more than
the Stanford-mandated living
wage. Buzay, however, said that Pe
ters the CEO of the organization
responsible for food-service labor
operations for the entire Row

"didn't know" that Stanford's Liv
ing Wage Policy, enacted in 2007,
"even existed" until four years af
ter it came into effect. In 2011, SOS
was finally forced to conform to the
policy, which mandates that all

campus workers, including those
hired by third-party contractors, be
paid at least $12.40 an hour when
also provided with benefits.

But there's no better way to
compare the performance of SOS
and GCDS than to talk to someone
who's experienced both. When I fi
nally sat down with a former Suites
hasher who currently lives on the
Row, his answer is clear: GCDS
outperforms SOS in every area of
food service.

"The food is better, the open
kitchen is better everything is
way better," he said of Suites Din
ing. He thinks it's "stupid" of
ResEd to consider contracting
management of Suites to any out
side company, much less SOS.

When I told him one of Res Ed's
ostensible justifications for elimi
nating GCDS is health and safety
concerns, he laughed in disbelief.
"We have so many health vio
lations," he said of the SOS-man
aged Row house in which he cur
rently lives. "The number of viola
tions we have..." He trailed off,
shaking his head.

When I asked him to list some of
the specific health violations in his
house, he demurred, afraid that his
kitchen staff might lose their jobs.
For the 2011-12 bidding process
for the Row the first it had ever
held ResEd conducted a closed
bid in which, according to Buzay,
four vendors submitted offers: Ara
mark, College Chefs, Sodexo and
SOS.

Sodexo is a French multination
al corporation with 16 billion euros
in annual consolidated revenue. It
employs 413,000 people worldwide
in 80 countries and serves 50 mil
lion consumers daily. Aramark op
erates in 22 countries, had rev
enues of $12.5 billion last year and
is the 23rd-largest employer on the
Fortune 500. Both companies have
come under intense criticism for
unethical business and labor prac
tices. And the first hit on a Google
search for "College Chefs reviews"
is an entry in the Ripoff Report de
tailing the company's practice of
"profiteering from students and
their parents."
When I ask Buzay which crite
ria ResEd uses to select vendors,
he says they choose "a vendor that
can come in and abide by the stu
dent-management model. Working
closely with students, work closely
with the community ... so we're not
mass producing food."
First of all, that description
sounds an awful lot like GCDS,
which is entirely made up of stu-

Clubs website shows current Student Organized Services CEO Nick Peters
'94 and his brother-in-law, Assistant ResEd Director Zac Sargeant.
Suites residents allege that their relationship is a conflict of interest.
dents from their own living
community.
And second, in a closed
bidding process in which
SOS's only three competitors
were two multinationals that
have no experience working
closely with students on
Stanford's campus and a
third company with a terri
ble reputation for its work on
college campuses, SOS's se
lection to manage the Row
was likely a foregone conclu
sion.
Boswell, Buzay and Gold
er claimed not to know who
will be selected as the bid
ders for next year's Suites
contract. But given Res Ed's
past bidding practices on the
Row, there's little reason to
believe the bidding process
for Suites will go any differ
ently.
Growing burden of ResEd
oversight
When I asked her about
Res Ed's heightened over
sight of GCDS since adminis
trators first intervened in

2009, Dean Golder insisted
that Res Ed's involvement
has been productive and ben
eficial.
"We've done our best to
help them be successful," she
declared. "And that's just
factually accurate."
But according to every
one who isn't a ResEd ad
ministrator, increased
ResEd interference has been
actively detrimental to the
effective student manage
ment of Suites Dining. Not a
single manager I inter
viewed could think of even
one way in which increased
ResEd oversight had made
their job easier.
The number of ways
managers say it has made
their jobs harder, however, is
remarkable. According to
several different managers,
all of whom wished to remain
anonymous, ResEd med
dling has made club manage
ment dramatically less effi
cient, more expensive and
less effective.
One of the most frustrat
ing changes for managers
has been Res Ed's enforced
separation of club expendi

tures into food which stu
dent managers are allowed
to purchase themselves us
ing the GCDS account
and capital items like cups,
plates and club improve
ments, which must be either
approved and paid for by
ResEd (using GCDS money)
or purchased using personal
student funds and submitted
for reimbursement.
According to one student
manager, the most signifi
cant problem with Res Ed's
new policy before which
student managers were free
to allocate funds as they saw
fit has been the delayed
payment of vendors who pro
vide both food and capital
items. Student managers will
pay for the food portion of
the invoice immediately, but
ResEd will take several
weeks to pay for the capital
items, leaving vendors com
plaining that they've been
underpaid.
Reimbursement the
other Res Ed-enforced way
for student managers to pur
chase capital items has
proven even more inconven
ient, mostly because ResEd

appears to consistently run
weeks behind schedule. One
manager purchased a new
stereo for his club in early
December using personal
funds and still hasn't re
ceived a ResEd reimburse
ment check. In September,
ResEd administrators forgot
to pay Bollard's water bill,
and Frank had to pay the
cost out of pocket. He finally
got a reimbursement check
for $248.73 on Jan. 24.
In Middle Earth, student
managers keep a running list
of things R&DE to whom,
according to the board bill,
Suites residents pay total an
nual maintenance fees of
over $380,000 has prom
ised to fix but hasn't. There
are currently 12 items on
that list, ranging from the
salad bar to the stove tap to
the mop rack.
When multiple fix-it re
quests went unanswered,
managers had to resort to
personal emails and phone
calls. Many of the requests
for maintenance have gone
unanswered since fall quar
ter. As one current Suites
manager I interviewed
fumed, "Housing does ab
solutely nothing."
Last year, R&DE in
stalled a shiny new dish
washer in Middle Earth. Un
like the other three clubs'
dishwashers, which despite
being old and timeworn work
perfectly fine, the R&DE-in
stalled Middle Earth dish
washer immediately broke,
and Housing still hasn't suc
cessfully fixed it. The sym
bolism is astonishing.
In Fall 2010, ResEd de
cided to assume control of
paying student hashers
traditionally a responsibility
of individual club managers,
who would write hashers
checks directly from their
eating club account. Before
the takeover, I remember a
student manager depositing
my hashing check every two
weeks, like clockwork, in the
furthest left-hand drawer in
the Avanti kitchen, beneath
the cupboard.
When ResEd took over,
they failed to pay student
hashers for the next two
months. Administrators only
resumed payment after stu
dents pointed out that not
paying your workers is a vio
lation of California labor law.

"It's amazing how incom
petent the so-called 'profes
sionals' can be," grumbled a
particularly displeased Suites
manager.
ResEd has even taken
GCDS money outright, with
out any warning or explana
tion. According to a 2011-12
club financial manager, each
eating club used to maintain
a $4,000 "carryover account"
money saved up "just in
case a chef got sick or we had
to have some big capital ex
penditure ... as like a
buffer."
"We had that money
saved up," the financial man
ager said. "I sent out some
checks at the end of the year
to pay off summer bills and
stuff like that... and then I
ended up coming back to
school and getting invoices
saying I had unpaid bills
from the summer, and I
found out that the checks I
had sent had bounced be
cause the University had
swept our accounts and tak
en out all the money that we
had saved for carryover, and
[they] just never gave it
back. It was just gone."
ResEd has also restricted
the number of hashers who
can be on GCDS's payroll,
drastically limiting the flexi
bility of students' work
schedules. Two club man
agers complained that find
ing replacement hashers
when their current one has a
midterm or an athletic event
has become much more diffi
cult since the pool of avail
able hashers is now much
smaller.
Even Res Ed's own stu
dent employees express frus
tration with the apparent in
competence and question
able work ethic of their supe
riors. One current Suites
Resident Assistant (RA)
complained that ResEd Stu
dent Affairs Officer Tiffany
Taylor, who is supposed to
make regular supervisory
visits to Suites, has been con
spicuously absent all year.
"She's supposed to come
over," said the RA, "but she
never actually does."
If there is any misman
agement and incompetence
going on at Suites, it's not on
the part of students. It's by
ResEd and R&DE.
It is only when I began in
vestigating its chronic un
derperformance that ResEd
finally began to grind, slowly,
into gear. Two days after I
sent an email to Boswell,

Buzay and Golder requesting
an interview about Suites, all
four club managers suddenly
got an unprecedentedly
friendly, but characteristical
ly vague, email from ResEd
administrator Jo Jaffe 'O9.
"I just wanted to check in
and see how everything was
going for you all," Jaffe
wrote. "Please let me know if
there's anything you have
questions on or need help
with."
Student managers weren't
fooled.
"It was definitely related
to the takeover," said one
club manager.
And only in the last
month has Keith Santiago,
head of Governor's Corner
Housing, finally become
more responsive to student
requests for help.
"We are skeptical as to his
motives," said another stu
dent manager.

Frank keeps his letters in
a Macy's bag in the back of
his old blue Lincoln. There
are 66 of them. Most are
thank you cards: cards from
students, cards from employ
ers, Christmas cards from
generations of Suites man
agers, cards in neatly written
Spanish I wish I could under
stand. Some are invitations to
long-ago Stanford gradua
tions from former students
who've left Frank's beloved
kitchen and moved on.
When Frank puts the tat
tered old Macy's bag in my
hands, he does so with a care
I've never seen before. He
tells me that if I open a card, I
must make sure to put it back
in the exact same envelope,
undamaged and in order.
"Be very careful, Miles,"
he says.
I smile. "I've got it,
Frank."
"No," he says, with a
fierce urgency. "These letters
are the most important things
to me."
These letters really are
the most important things to
him. And so I take great care
as I look slowly through the
letters, kept as pristine as you
could possibly keep 66 letters
in an old Macy's bag.
Certain phrases stand out
from the flow of thanks from
Frank's former students.
"You're like an uncle to
me."
"I'm so touched beyond
words that you remembered
my birthday."
"To the man who is always
right, who gives the best ad
vice and who makes my
stomach content."
Frank never lets his let
ters go. Next year, this Uni
versity won't be able to say
the same about Frank.

"Residential Education,"
states the office's website, "is
about the people it serves ...
We are concerned with the
experience of indvidual [sic]
residents and how to best
serve each of them."
As I speak with Suites
resident after Suites resident,
I can't help but think that
ResEd has forgotten that cen
tral mission. Almost unani
mously, the residents I talk to
are shocked and appalled to
discover that their four chefs'
contracts are not being re
newed a decision about
which students were not con
sulted and that students
will no longer lead Suites' din
ing clubs next year.
"It makes me really mad,"
says one current resident,
with simple honesty.
For others, the loss of a
student job at Suites threat
ens to produce financial hard
ship.
"Without hashing," says a
student in Suites who is cur
rently on financial aid, "I
would have no income at a11...
I'd be getting deeper and
deeper into the hole with my
student loans."
(Boswell, Buzay and Gold
er say that some kind of stu
dent management will be al
lowed under the new contrac
tor— but any student man
agers that remain will work for
the new company, not a stu
dent-run nonprofit, and there
will be, according to current
student managers, no paid stu
dent hashing next year.)
I'm reminded that 95.97
percent of Suites residents
opposed a change about
which they were never con
sulted and only recently in
formed.
When I reach out to
Suites alumni, the reaction
is, if anything, even more
pained. They're dismayed to
learn that the place they
loved has changed so much.
"I always thought it was
the greatest food on the plan
et," a 2005-07 resident re
members wistfully.
"The quality of the food,
and the cheapness of it, was

better than anything the
University was able to offer,"
a student who lived and
worked in Suites from 2006-
08, before ResEd began its
expensive and debilitating
takeover, recalls.

I'm also reminded about
the importance of communi
ty, and how that word means
much more than simply a
group of students. Our com
munity is made up of every
one who makes Stanford so
quintessentially Stanford
from President Hennessy
down to the last kitchen
worker, from star athletic
coaches and tenured profes
sors to the four chefs who, as
one saddened survey respon
dent put it, "make Suites
what it is."
When I ask Golder
whether she considers it im
portant to bring Caroline,
Dennis, Frank and Tony back
next year, she says, "If it
works out, I think that's
great." She suggests that if
students wanted to help, we
should write a letter of rec
ommendation for the chefs to
the new corporate contractor.
Between Boswell, Buzay
and Golder, no one offers to
do anything at all to help the
chefs keep their jobs.
"I can't tell a vendor who
they have to hire," Golder
says.
And that was it.
That's not the spirit of the
Stanford I know. The Stan
ford I know doesn't corpora
tize student life at the ex
pense of longstanding com
munity members; it encour
ages and fosters student lead
ership, student initiative and
student independence. The
Stanford I know is about
standing up for the little guy,
being accountable and doing
the best we can for every
member of our community.
As I reflect on the end of
an era, I'm deeply disturbed
by something I remember
from the beginning of my in
terview in that ResEd board
room.
"My general directive
from the president, provost
and [Vice-Provost for Stu
dent Affairs] Greg Board
man when I was brought in
four years ago was: 'Clean
up,"' Golder declared.
Suites Dining, she said,
was just "one of hundreds" of
places under ResEd consider
ation "one of hundreds" of
places "where we're looking
at ourselves and saying, 'Are
we doing the best we can by
students? Are we doing the
best we can by Stanford?"'
If firing four loyal com
munity members beloved by
their students; outsourcing
student jobs and responsibil
ity to a for-profit corporation
with a suspicious workers'
rights record and dubious
ties to the Stanford office re
sponsible for its current con
tract; and refusing to solicit
any student opinion before
making crucial decisions
about student welfare is
what "doing the best we can
by students" looks like
and if there truly are hun
dreds of places left on
Res Ed's ominous list then
the end of Suites Dining
might be merely the begin
ning of a new and darker era
in our collective campus life.
If ResEd gets its way at
Suites, it will be a victory for
bureaucracy, for incompe
tence and probably for the
coffers of SOS, with its hun
dreds of thousands of dollars
in administrative fees. But it
will be a tremendous loss for
everyone else: for students,
for four veteran chefs who will
be forced out of the communi
ty they love and for this great
university we all call home.
It can be hard to stand up
for ourselves. We're all stu
dents; we hold down jobs;
we're athletes and scientists
and writers with tremendous
time commitments on our
hands.
ResEd knows that, and
they take full advantage of it.
As Sullivan, the former
GCDS CEO who spent an
entire exhausting year try
ing to hold off the ResEd
juggernaut, puts it, "It's an
entire office of Stanford Uni
versity against a few stu
dents who don't have the
time or the energy to fight."
ResEd and SOS move
quietly, inexorably and pa
tiently towards a shared goal
that is ultimately detrimental
and destructive to the Stan
ford community.
We cannot we must not
let them go unchallenged.
It's time to take a stand.
