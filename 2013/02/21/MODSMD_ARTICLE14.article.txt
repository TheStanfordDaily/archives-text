## REPUTATION AT RISK OREGON SCHOOLS AWAIT 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
After dropping a pair of close
home games to UCLA and USC, the
Stanford Cardinal men's basketball
team desperately needs to finish con
ference play on a high note. With
March Madness just around the cor
ner and the possibility of earning an
at-large bid appearing increasingly
unrealistic, Stanford must focus on
picking up a couple of conference
wins on the road this week in order
to improve its seed for the Pac-12
tournament.
Despite having a losing record in
the conference, the Card has proven
that it can beat any team in the Pac
-12 by topping Arizona State and Ore
gon— two teams that are likely
tournament bound.
Stanford's quest to climb up the
Pac-12 standings begins this Thurs
day night, when the Cardinal (15-11,
6-7 Pac-12) travels to Corvallis, Ore.,
to take on the Oregon State Beavers
(13-13,3-10). Stanford, despite drop
ping to eighth in a very competitive
Pac-12, is only two games back of
fourth place with five games remain
ing on the schedule. The Card could
very well jump into the top five if it
manages to win out.
The Beavers, despite their sub
par conference record, have been
dangerous this season. When these
two teams first squared off at
Maples Pavilion, the Card managed
to pull out a close 81-73 win. OSU will
look to reverse that outcome on their
home court —a distinct possibility if
Stanford does not play solid basket
ball.

Unfortunately for the Card, OSU
has done many things effectively on
its two-game skid, moving the ball in
credibly well, creating open shots
and forcing turnovers on the defen-

sive end. However, the Beavers have
been plagued by poor shooting, go
ing a combined 57-for-139 (41 per
cent) from the field and a lowly 19-
for-33 (57 percent) from the free
throw fine. If the Card can start
knocking down open shots, it should
be able to close out the season with a
few big wins.
The Beavers will likely turn to
Roberto Nelson, the junior guard
who has terrorized opponents
throughout the season, to generate
much of their offense. Nelson has
been both effective spotting up and
off the dribble drive, using his ath
leticism to generate many of his own
shots. He is leading the team with
17.2 points per game on 45.4 percent
shooting from the field. He has
shown a knack for knocking down

open threes, posting a tremendous
43.1 percent mark from beyond the
arc. However, his assist-to-turnover
ratio of 2.6 to 2.3 is somewhat trou
bling for a guard who is often in con
trol of the offense.
The Cardinal will likely look to
sophomore guard Chasson Randle
and junior point guard Aaron Blight
to stop Nelson, using heavy pressure
to force him into poor decision mak
ing.
Oregon State also boasts a pair of
6-foot-10 big men in sophomore for

ward Eric Moreland and center An
gus Brandt. The combo has wreaked
havoc in the paint, using their size
and strength to grab offensive re
bounds and create second-chance op
portunities for the Beavers. More
land is leading the team with 10.5 re
bounds per game, and Brandt is not
far behind with 8.5 of his own. De
spite Brandt averaging more points
per game (11.3 to Moreland's 9.3),
Moreland has been the more effec

After dropping a pair of close
home games to UCLA and USC, the
Stanford Cardinal men's basketball
team desperately needs to finish con
ference play on a high note. With
March Madness just around the cor
ner and the possibility of earning an
at-large bid appearing increasingly
unrealistic, Stanford must focus on
picking up a couple of conference
wins on the road this week in order
to improve its seed for the Pac-12
tournament.
Despite having a losing record in
the conference, the Card has proven
that it can beat any team in the Pac
-12 by topping Arizona State and Ore
gon— two teams that are likely
tournament bound.
Stanford's quest to climb up the
Pac-12 standings begins this Thurs
day night, when the Cardinal (15-11,
6-7 Pac-12) travels to Corvallis, Ore.,
to take on the Oregon State Beavers
(13-13,3-10). Stanford, despite drop
ping to eighth in a very competitive
Pac-12, is only two games back of
fourth place with five games remain
ing on the schedule. The Card could
very well jump into the top five if it
manages to win out.
The Beavers, despite their sub
par conference record, have been
dangerous this season. When these
two teams first squared off at
Maples Pavilion, the Card managed
to pull out a close 81-73 win. OSU will
look to reverse that outcome on their
home court —a distinct possibility if
Stanford does not play solid basket
ball.

Unfortunately for the Card, OSU
has done many things effectively on
its two-game skid, moving the ball in
credibly well, creating open shots
and forcing turnovers on the defen-

sive end. However, the Beavers have
been plagued by poor shooting, go
ing a combined 57-for-139 (41 per
cent) from the field and a lowly 19-
for-33 (57 percent) from the free
throw fine. If the Card can start
knocking down open shots, it should
be able to close out the season with a
few big wins.
The Beavers will likely turn to
Roberto Nelson, the junior guard
who has terrorized opponents
throughout the season, to generate
much of their offense. Nelson has
been both effective spotting up and
off the dribble drive, using his ath
leticism to generate many of his own
shots. He is leading the team with
17.2 points per game on 45.4 percent
shooting from the field. He has
shown a knack for knocking down

open threes, posting a tremendous
43.1 percent mark from beyond the
arc. However, his assist-to-turnover
ratio of 2.6 to 2.3 is somewhat trou
bling for a guard who is often in con
trol of the offense.
The Cardinal will likely look to
sophomore guard Chasson Randle
and junior point guard Aaron Blight
to stop Nelson, using heavy pressure
to force him into poor decision mak
ing.
Oregon State also boasts a pair of
6-foot-10 big men in sophomore for

ward Eric Moreland and center An
gus Brandt. The combo has wreaked
havoc in the paint, using their size
and strength to grab offensive re
bounds and create second-chance op
portunities for the Beavers. More
land is leading the team with 10.5 re
bounds per game, and Brandt is not
far behind with 8.5 of his own. De
spite Brandt averaging more points
per game (11.3 to Moreland's 9.3),
Moreland has been the more effec
