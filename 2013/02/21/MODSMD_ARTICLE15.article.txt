# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## CARD STUNNED AT HOME 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team suffered only its third home
loss since 1999 on Saturday when it
fell to No. 47 Saint Mary's (5-3) in a
close 4-3 match.
The No. 7 Cardinal (3-1) was
playing without junior Nicole
Gibbs, a team captain and regular
on court one. Gibbs was playing a
pro tournament in Rancho Santa
Fe this past weekend, making it all
the way to the finals of the singles
draw.
Junior and fellow co-captain
Kristie Ahn, who usually plays No.
1 doubles with Gibbs, felt her ab
sence but made no excuses.
"Going into it, we knew it would
be tough without Gibbs," she said.
"And unfortunately, we came up
just a bit short."
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the first time this season
to the Gaels. Normally, Gibbs and
Ahn team up to play at the No. 1
spot, but without Gibbs, senior
Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay manned court one, losing to
Danielle Flores and Jenny Jullien,
8-5.
"St. Mary's did a better job in
doubles that day," Tsay admitted.
"They made more serves and put
away more volleys, so a lot of it just
boiled down to execution."
The court two duo of Ahn and
junior Amelia Herring also fell, los
ing to the Saint Mary's team of
Catherine Isip and Elizabeth Searl
in a tight 8-6 match. It was Ahn and
Herring's first appearance togeth
er as a doubles team.
"The match was neck and neck
the whole time, and unfortunately,
we couldn't capitalize on a few key
points toward the end of the pro
set," Ahn said. "Amelia and I played
well though, and it was a lot of fun.
They were very respectable oppo
nents."
Senior captain Natalie Dillon
and freshman Krista Hardebeck
were able to pull out a 9-8 win, but
that didn't change the outcome of
the overall doubles point.
Down 1-0, Stanford knew it had
to step it up in singles. Tan crushed
Jade Frampton, giving up just one
game to her in the second set. Ahn
then put the Cardinal ahead 2-1
with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Isip.
The match was even after
Hardebeck lost to Jullien on court
one, 7-5, 6-1, but freshman Lind
sey Kostas captured a 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory against Audrey Leitz in her
first appearance this year, putting
the Cardinal back on top.
It was tied up again after Saint
Mary's Flores outlasted Tsay at
the No. 3 spot in a three-setter, 6-
4, 0-6, 6-2.
"[Flores] was playing to win
and swung fearlessly, and I gave
her way too much leeway to con
trol points and also didn't handle
her attacking shots very well,"
Tsay said. "I didn't play as as
sertively as I have been this sea
son, and I know that I need to get
back to that style of play. "
It all came down to court five.
Dillon fought a hard battle against
Catherine Leduc, eventually los
ing 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"Tennis is not a timed sport,
nor is there a mercy rule," Ahn
said. "The craziest comebacks do
in fact happen. It's also difficult
because momentum is such a huge
part."

The team isn't going to dwell on
the past though.
"We've accepted what has hap

pened and are ready to move on,"
Ahn said.
"The loss has added a new level
of intensity and urgency," Tsay
said. "As the coaches pointed out,
the loss is not a total loss if we use
it to fuel us and motivate us for the
rest of the season."
The Cardinal will have its
chance to capture its own upset
when it travels to Gainesville, Fla.,
to take on the No. 2 Gators this
Sunday. Stanford will also face No.
18 Clemson on Saturday.
The Gators are one of Stan
ford's biggest rivals. Florida beat
the Cardinal in the 2011 NCAA
championship on the Farm,
abruptly putting an end to Stan
ford's undefeated season.
Now, the team is concentrating
on revenge.
"We're especially focusing on
doubles, particularly [Gibbs] and
myself as she's been gone so
much," Ahn said. "We're just try
ing to fine-tune and get ourselves
confident with our games before
taking on Clemson and Florida."
This will be the Cardinal's first
trip to the East Coast this year
and its first chance to play two top
-20 teams in one weekend.
"It'll be a great opportunity for
us to bounce back," Tsay said.
The Cardinal will appear in
Gainesville against Clemson this
Saturday at 9:30 a.m. and Florida
this Sunday at 8 a.m.

1 doubles with Gibbs, felt her ab
sence but made no excuses.
"Going into it, we knew it would
be tough without Gibbs," she said.
"And unfortunately, we came up
just a bit short."
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the first time this season
to the Gaels. Normally, Gibbs and
Ahn team up to play at the No. 1
spot, but without Gibbs, senior
Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay manned court one, losing to
Danielle Flores and Jenny Jullien,
8-5.
"St. Mary's did a better job in
doubles that day," Tsay admitted.
"They made more serves and put
away more volleys, so a lot of it just
boiled down to execution."
The court two duo of Ahn and
junior Amelia Herring also fell, los
ing to the Saint Mary's team of
Catherine Isip and Elizabeth Searl
in a tight 8-6 match. It was Ahn and
Herring's first appearance togeth
er as a doubles team.
"The match was neck and neck
the whole time, and unfortunately,
we couldn't capitalize on a few key
points toward the end of the pro
set," Ahn said. "Amelia and I played
well though, and it was a lot of fun.
They were very respectable oppo
nents."
Senior captain Natalie Dillon
and freshman Krista Hardebeck
were able to pull out a 9-8 win, but
that didn't change the outcome of
the overall doubles point.
Down 1-0, Stanford knew it had
to step it up in singles. Tan crushed
Jade Frampton, giving up just one
game to her in the second set. Ahn
then put the Cardinal ahead 2-1
with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Isip.
The match was even after
Hardebeck lost to Jullien on court
one, 7-5, 6-1, but freshman Lind
sey Kostas captured a 6-4, 6-4 vic
tory against Audrey Leitz in her
first appearance this year, putting
the Cardinal back on top.
It was tied up again after Saint
Mary's Flores outlasted Tsay at
the No. 3 spot in a three-setter, 6-
4, 0-6, 6-2.
"[Flores] was playing to win
and swung fearlessly, and I gave
her way too much leeway to con
trol points and also didn't handle
her attacking shots very well,"
Tsay said. "I didn't play as as
sertively as I have been this sea
son, and I know that I need to get
back to that style of play. "
It all came down to court five.
Dillon fought a hard battle against
Catherine Leduc, eventually los
ing 4-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"Tennis is not a timed sport,
nor is there a mercy rule," Ahn
said. "The craziest comebacks do
in fact happen. It's also difficult
because momentum is such a huge
part."

The team isn't going to dwell on
the past though.
"We've accepted what has hap

pened and are ready to move on,"
Ahn said.
"The loss has added a new level
of intensity and urgency," Tsay
said. "As the coaches pointed out,
the loss is not a total loss if we use
it to fuel us and motivate us for the
rest of the season."
The Cardinal will have its
chance to capture its own upset
when it travels to Gainesville, Fla.,
to take on the No. 2 Gators this
Sunday. Stanford will also face No.
18 Clemson on Saturday.
The Gators are one of Stan
ford's biggest rivals. Florida beat
the Cardinal in the 2011 NCAA
championship on the Farm,
abruptly putting an end to Stan
ford's undefeated season.
Now, the team is concentrating
on revenge.
"We're especially focusing on
doubles, particularly [Gibbs] and
myself as she's been gone so
much," Ahn said. "We're just try
ing to fine-tune and get ourselves
confident with our games before
taking on Clemson and Florida."
This will be the Cardinal's first
trip to the East Coast this year
and its first chance to play two top
-20 teams in one weekend.
"It'll be a great opportunity for
us to bounce back," Tsay said.
The Cardinal will appear in
Gainesville against Clemson this
Saturday at 9:30 a.m. and Florida
this Sunday at 8 a.m.
