# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## CARD STUNNED AT HOME 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team suffered only its third home
loss since 1999 on Saturday when it
fell to No. 47 Saint Mary's (5-3) in a
close 4-3 match.
The No. 7 Cardinal (3-1) was
playing without junior Nicole
Gibbs, a team captain and regular
on court one. Gibbs was playing a
pro tournament in Rancho Santa
Fe this past weekend, making it all
the way to the finals of the singles
draw.
Junior and fellow co-captain
Kristie Ahn, who usually plays No.
1 doubles with Gibbs, felt her ab
sence but made no excuses.
"Going into it, we knew it would
be tough without Gibbs," she said.
"And unfortunately, we came up
just a bit short."
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the first time this season
to the Gaels. Normally, Gibbs and
Ahn team up to play at the No. 1
spot, but without Gibbs, senior
Stacey Tan and sophomore Ellen
Tsay manned court one, losing to
Danielle Flores and Jenny Jullien,
8-5.
"St. Mary's did a better job in
doubles that day," Tsay admitted.
"They made more serves and put
away more volleys, so a lot of it just
boiled down to execution."
The court two duo of Ahn and
junior Amelia Herring also fell, los
ing to the Saint Mary's team of
Catherine Isip and Elizabeth Searl
in a tight 8-6 match. It was Ahn and
Herring's first appearance togeth
er as a doubles team.
"The match was neck and neck
the whole time, and unfortunately,
we couldn't capitalize on a few key
points toward the end of the pro
set," Ahn said. "Amelia and I played
well though, and it was a lot of fun.
They were very respectable oppo
nents."
Senior captain Natalie Dillon
and freshman Krista Hardebeck
were able to pull out a 9-8 win, but
that didn't change the outcome of
the overall doubles point.
Down 1-0, Stanford knew it had
to step it up in singles. Tan crushed
Jade Frampton, giving up just one
