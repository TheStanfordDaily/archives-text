# CRIMSON COMES TO CALI

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
will try to earn its first win of the 2013 sea
son when it meets cross-country rival Har
vard on Sunday.
In its opening game, the Cardinal (0-1)
allowed No. 9 Notre Dame to come back
from a 7-2 halftime deficit and steal a 12-10
win.
'After halftime, we just became a little
more tentative instead of playing to
win, I think we became a little more care
ful," said Stanford head coach Amy
Bokker. "With a young team, that's proba
bly expected a little bit, but that's definite
ly a big learning experience for us going
forward."

3/0 Columbus, O.H.
NOTES: Last time out the
young Card squad proved it
could compete with the best
when it led Notre Dame
most of the game last Satur
day. A win over Harvard
would reaffirm its potential
and warrant the team more
attention.

selection. Farr scored one of Stanford's four goals last year against
Harvard and will look to strike again in the upcoming rematch.
for the first time since suffering an injury ear
ly in the 2012 season, led Stanford with three
goals and two assists. Freshman Lucy Dikeou
also recorded three goals in her collegiate de
but.
Bokker also noted that draw controls
played a key role, with Stanford winning nine
of 10 faceoffs.
In the first 30 minutes of play, Stanford's
defense held Notre Dame to just two goals on
four shots, but in the second half, the Fighting
Irish pumped in 10 goals as the Card broke
down on defense, drawing four yellow cards in
the second half. The Card will look to maintain
that first-half effort for a lull 60 minutes when
unranked Harvard comes to the Farm.
"We came out with a lot of great energy and
had a lot of momentum on our side." Bokker
said. "A key [on Sunday] will be really staying

disciplined on the defensive end, trying to lim
it our fouls and play good solid defense."
Sunday's matchup will be Harvard's first of
the season. Last year, the Crimson had a 9-7
overall record and finished fourth in the Ivy
League. One of the wins came when the Car
dinal visited Cambridge and Stanford was held
scoreless in the first half while Harvard ran
away with a 10-4 victory. According to Bokker,
Harvard is usually well coached and well or
ganized.
The Crimson's lineup will look different in
this weekend's matchup due to graduation and
withdrawals related to the Harvard cheating
scandal. Just six of the Crimson's 2012 starters
return for 2013.
Three seniors return to lead a Harvard at
tack that averaged 8.62 goals on 22.3 shots per
game last year 1 . Midfielder Danielle Tetreault
was Harvard's leading scorer last season with
28 goals in 16 games. The senior, who was
named to the Inside Lacrosse preseason All-
America third team, dominated Stanford with
six goals in last season's game.
Harvard attacker Jenn Vandermeulen also

recorded 26 goals and five assists in 2012, while
midfielder Micaela Cyr added 17 goals. No oth
er Crimson returners scored more than 10
goals last year.
At the other end of the field, Harvard is
much more inexperienced. The Crimson re
turns just two players, juniors Lauren Tomkhi
son and Kasey Uhlenhuth, who stalled on de
fense in 2012.
Goalkeeping is a huge question mark for
the Crimson as 2012 starter Kelly Weis the
only goalie on the 2012 roster is no longer
with the team. Harvard has brought in goal
keepers from other sports and is also exploring
options among its field players.
However, Bokker is more concerned with
her squad than the opponent's.
"Our team really learned that we could play
at a high level," Bokker said. "[Now] we just
have to keep our energy for the entire 60 min
utes."
The game will begin at 3 p.m. at Cagan Sta
dium this Sunday.
