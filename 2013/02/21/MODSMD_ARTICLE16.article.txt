### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
will try to earn its first win of the 2013 sea
son when it meets cross-country rival Har
vard on Sunday.
In its opening game, the Cardinal (0-1)
allowed No. 9 Notre Dame to come back
from a 7-2 halftime deficit and steal a 12-10
win.
'After halftime, we just became a little
more tentative instead of playing to
win, I think we became a little more care
ful," said Stanford head coach Amy
Bokker. "With a young team, that's proba
bly expected a little bit, but that's definite
ly a big learning experience for us going
forward."

NOTES: Last time out the
young Card squad proved it
could compete with the best
when it led Notre Dame
most of the game last Satur
day. A win over Harvard
would reaffirm its potential
and warrant the team more
attention.

Harvard and will look to strike again in the upcoming rematch.
