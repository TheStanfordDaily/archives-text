# TRACK & FIELD
## RACE TO THE TOP AT MPSFs 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Championship starts off its 21st year
of competition, but more important
ly, this weekend marks an opportuni
ty for the Stanford women's track
and field team to bring home its
ninth MPSF title.
With the final trip this season to
the Dempsey Indoor Track at the
University of Washington in Seattle,
the women's conference crown will
be challenged by highly ranked com
petitors, Oregon and Arizona State,
while the men try to reclaim their
2010-11 MPSF title from the Sun
Devils.
The Stanford women, currently
ranked 16th by the U.S. Track and
Field Coaches Association with
45.98 overall indoor season points,
are currently over 100 points behind
the second-ranked Oregon women,
who boast an outrageous 151.95
team points.
The numbers, though, do not do
the Cardinal justice. Freshman Amy
Weissenbach, who recently ran the
school's second-fastest indoor 800
time ever, is not so much a secret
threat as she is a double threat. An
obvious competitor for the 800-me
ter title, Weissenbach raced a 2:05.83
in the Husky Invitational last week.
But in addition to her 800-meter
dominance, Weissenbach, who has
posted 1600-meter times as low as
4:52.01, could also pose a danger in
the competitive mile.
Junior Captain Kori Carter cur
rently holds the MPSF 60-meter
hurdle indoor title and is in great po
sition to snatch it again after having
recently broken her own school
record in the same event. Carter's
biggest competition will be Oregon
sophomore English Gardner, who
sprinted a time of 7.19 at Millrose
Games in New York City in mid-Feb
ruary, tying for the second fastest in
the nation this year.
"I think my biggest challenge
[this weekend] will be focusing on
the here and now, taking the race
one hurdle at a time," Carter said.
"Getting caught up in the big picture
is how you make mistakes."
The women will face 14 other
competitors, including No. 8 Ari
zona State and No. 11 Arizona, at
the meet. The University of Hawaii
women are a new addition to the
conference this year, and although

they are still considered under
dogs, their talent in the distance
events should not be overlooked.
Other key athletes for the Stan
ford women are Katie Nelms,
Carter's teammate in the 60-meter
hurdles; senior Jessica Tonn, who
put up a fantastic time in the 5,000
meter three weeks ago; and triple
jumper Jordan Merback.
The Stanford men will look to

regain their MPSF fame after it
was stolen from them last year by
the Sun Devils' record-breaking 50
point-margin of victory. The dis
tance events, a traditional strong
hold for the Cardinal because of
athletes like junior distance runner
Michael Atchoo, senior sprinter
Spencer Chase and sophomore dis
tance runner Luke Lefebure, will
single-handedly be challenged by
one man this weekend: Arizona
junior Lawi Lalang.
Lalang is the reigning MPSF
Athlete of the Year and is at the top
of the mile with a time of 3:54.56
and the 3,000-meter with a time of
7:42.79, ranking second and first
respectively in the country this
year.
The men do have one trick up
their sleeve, though, with the top
distance medley relay time in the
conference and the third-highest
rank in the NCAA at 9:34.20. Last
year, the Stanford men finished
with a total of 81.5 points. This year,
they not only hope to beat that, but
to overtake Arizona for the title.
There's no doubt, though, that
the Stanford team will be ready for
the challenge from the first event
on Friday to the final event on Sat
urday.

is how you make mistakes."
The women will face 14 other
competitors, including No. 8 Ari
zona State and No. 11 Arizona, at
the meet. The University of Hawaii
women are a new addition to the
conference this year, and although

they are still considered under
dogs, their talent in the distance
events should not be overlooked.
Other key athletes for the Stan
ford women are Katie Nelms,
Carter's teammate in the 60-meter
hurdles; senior Jessica Tonn, who
put up a fantastic time in the 5,000
meter three weeks ago; and triple
jumper Jordan Merback.
The Stanford men will look to

regain their MPSF fame after it
was stolen from them last year by
the Sun Devils' record-breaking 50
point-margin of victory. The dis
tance events, a traditional strong
hold for the Cardinal because of
athletes like junior distance runner
Michael Atchoo, senior sprinter
Spencer Chase and sophomore dis
tance runner Luke Lefebure, will
single-handedly be challenged by
one man this weekend: Arizona
junior Lawi Lalang.
Lalang is the reigning MPSF
Athlete of the Year and is at the top
of the mile with a time of 3:54.56
and the 3,000-meter with a time of
7:42.79, ranking second and first
respectively in the country this
year.
The men do have one trick up
their sleeve, though, with the top
distance medley relay time in the
conference and the third-highest
rank in the NCAA at 9:34.20. Last
year, the Stanford men finished
with a total of 81.5 points. This year,
they not only hope to beat that, but
to overtake Arizona for the title.
There's no doubt, though, that
the Stanford team will be ready for
the challenge from the first event
on Friday to the final event on Sat
urday.

Junior captain Kori Carter (above) hopes to recapture the MPSF 60-meter hurdle indoor title. The odds are in her favor, as she recently
broke her own school record in the event with a time of 8.17 seconds.
