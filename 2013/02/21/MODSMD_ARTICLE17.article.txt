# TRACK & FIELD
## RACE TO THE TOP AT MPSFs 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
This weekend the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Championship starts off its 21st year
of competition, but more important
ly, this weekend marks an opportuni
ty for the Stanford women's track
and field team to bring home its
ninth MPSF title.
With the final trip this season to
the Dempsey Indoor Track at the
University of Washington in Seattle,
the women's conference crown will
be challenged by highly ranked com
petitors, Oregon and Arizona State,
while the men try to reclaim their
2010-11 MPSF title from the Sun
Devils.
The Stanford women, currently
ranked 16th by the U.S. Track and
Field Coaches Association with
45.98 overall indoor season points,
are currently over 100 points behind
the second-ranked Oregon women,
who boast an outrageous 151.95
team points.
The numbers, though, do not do
the Cardinal justice. Freshman Amy
Weissenbach, who recently ran the
school's second-fastest indoor 800
time ever, is not so much a secret
threat as she is a double threat. An
obvious competitor for the 800-me
ter title, Weissenbach raced a 2:05.83
in the Husky Invitational last week.
But in addition to her 800-meter
dominance, Weissenbach, who has
posted 1600-meter times as low as
4:52.01, could also pose a danger in
the competitive mile.
Junior Captain Kori Carter cur
rently holds the MPSF 60-meter
hurdle indoor title and is in great po
sition to snatch it again after having
recently broken her own school
record in the same event. Carter's
biggest competition will be Oregon
sophomore English Gardner, who
sprinted a time of 7.19 at Millrose
Games in New York City in mid-Feb
ruary, tying for the second fastest in
the nation this year.
"I think my biggest challenge
[this weekend] will be focusing on
the here and now, taking the race
one hurdle at a time," Carter said.
"Getting caught up in the big picture
is how you make mistakes."
The women will face 14 other
