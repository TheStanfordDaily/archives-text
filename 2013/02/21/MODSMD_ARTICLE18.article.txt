# When good coaches get pushy
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
As a superfan of the
double, double toil and
trouble that Stanford's
Pac-12 opponents get
themselves into, few
things have pleased me more in life
than the Trojan turmoil of 2006 and
the to-be-resolved Oregon "oops!" of
2011.

But there's nothing like the good
ol' Cal chuckle: that warm, giggly
feeling I get in my heart when I find
out that the Golden Bears have done
something else wrong.
This time it's not dipping Aca
demic Progress Ratings, reckless
former players or sickening
Tweets by Daily Cal journalists,
but a regrettable move by respect
ed men's basketball coach Mike
Montgomery. With the Bears down
by double digits at home against
USC, Cal star Allen Crabbe
jogged lazily up the court as his
coach called timeout. Montgomery
took offense, shouting at Crabbe
and giving him a quick shove for
motivation. Teammates had to sep
arate a steaming Crabbe from his
coach, and he spent several min
utes in the tunnel before returning
and going on to spark a comeback
victory for the Bears.
Even though he is Cal's head
coach, Monty garners nothing but
respect from us Stanford fans.
NCAA Tournament appearances
were taken for granted by the end
of his 18-year tenure on the Farm
from 1986-2004, when he led the
Cardinal to 12 Big Dances and a
Final Four. He's the coach I grew
up watching even idolizing
and his teams were models of how
to sustain basketball success at a
school that has been a bit light on
that lately.
Monty did have a bit of a tem
per every now and then, but it was
always directed at referees, not his
players. And that's an important
distinction.
Because even though I believe
Monty with his near-spotless
record over 35 years of coaching
does deserve some slack, this was
n't "blown out of proportion" by
the media, as Crabbe suggested.
Even though this was a mistake,
apologized for in a heartbeat, the
incident shouldn't be swept under
the rug quite as quickly as one Dai
ly Cal columnist implored on Tues
day.
Even though the shove doesn't
change what I think of Mike Mont
gomery, it can't be excused. Monty
himself acknowledged that.
Crabbe's father put it best. "I
told Montgomery, 'I respect you as
a coach,'" the San Jose Mercury
News reported him saying. '"Do I
respect what you did? No. You
can't put your hands on a kid. It's
2013.'
"He understood and said it was
his mistake."
To me, that's about as healthy
of an attitude as could come from
those inside the situation. Though
Montgomery was surprisingly un
apologetic right after the game in
question, after some time to re
flect, he came to terms with what
he had done and made sure the
right people knew that. And the
right people listened.
But as honorable as it was for
Crabbe to forgive and forget,
that's not the course we should
take as media or fans.
Somehow, even after Bob
Knight and Mike Leach and Tom
my Tuberville, big-name college
coaches continue to get caught up
in the moment and act violently.
Though there's rarely any long
term malice at work, impulsive
abuse is still abuse. Even if Crabbe
acts the bigger man and publicly
accepts Monty's apology, for the
public to do the same is to create a
sense of appeasement for a prac
tice we must eliminate from col
lege sports.
And who knows what the tar
geted party really thinks of his
coach in these situations? It's en
tirely possible that despite decid
ing to help his coach and univer
sity save face, a player who has
been attacked by a coach harbors
some real displeasure with that
coach's underlying style of motiva
tion. Though by most accounts
that's not the case at Cal, if there
was a deeper issue that only came
to the fore with the incident this
weekend, this would be a real
chance to address that issue. But if
fans forgive their coach and move
on, it only encourages the continu
ation of those distasteful practices
(so long as they don't surface again
on the sidelines).
So despite my unwaver
ing respect for Mike Mont
gomery as a man, I'm still
going to remember this inci

dent as a blemish on that
otherwise spotless record.
As a principle, I'm not go
ing to rush to defend coach
es who commit violent mis
takes, however rare or inci
dental.
To do otherwise would be
to let the real offenders off
the hook.

Joseph Beyda is currently
fighting off anxiety attacks
caused by his newly uncer
tain feelings towards Monty.

were taken for granted by the end
of his 18-year tenure on the Farm
from 1986-2004, when he led the
Cardinal to 12 Big Dances and a
Final Four. He's the coach I grew
up watching even idolizing
and his teams were models of how
to sustain basketball success at a
school that has been a bit light on
that lately.
Monty did have a bit of a tem
per every now and then, but it was
always directed at referees, not his
players. And that's an important
distinction.
Because even though I believe
Monty with his near-spotless
record over 35 years of coaching
does deserve some slack, this was
n't "blown out of proportion" by
the media, as Crabbe suggested.
Even though this was a mistake,
apologized for in a heartbeat, the
incident shouldn't be swept under
the rug quite as quickly as one Dai
ly Cal columnist implored on Tues
day.
Even though the shove doesn't
change what I think of Mike Mont
gomery, it can't be excused. Monty
himself acknowledged that.
Crabbe's father put it best. "I
told Montgomery, 'I respect you as
a coach,'" the San Jose Mercury
News reported him saying. '"Do I
respect what you did? No. You
can't put your hands on a kid. It's
2013.'
"He understood and said it was
his mistake."
To me, that's about as healthy
of an attitude as could come from
those inside the situation. Though
Montgomery was surprisingly un
apologetic right after the game in
question, after some time to re
flect, he came to terms with what
he had done and made sure the
right people knew that. And the
right people listened.
But as honorable as it was for
Crabbe to forgive and forget,
that's not the course we should
take as media or fans.
Somehow, even after Bob
Knight and Mike Leach and Tom
my Tuberville, big-name college
coaches continue to get caught up
in the moment and act violently.
Though there's rarely any long
term malice at work, impulsive
abuse is still abuse. Even if Crabbe
acts the bigger man and publicly
accepts Monty's apology, for the
public to do the same is to create a
sense of appeasement for a prac
tice we must eliminate from col
lege sports.
And who knows what the tar
geted party really thinks of his
coach in these situations? It's en
tirely possible that despite decid
ing to help his coach and univer
sity save face, a player who has
been attacked by a coach harbors
some real displeasure with that
coach's underlying style of motiva
tion. Though by most accounts
that's not the case at Cal, if there
was a deeper issue that only came
to the fore with the incident this
weekend, this would be a real
chance to address that issue. But if
fans forgive their coach and move
on, it only encourages the continu
ation of those distasteful practices
(so long as they don't surface again
on the sidelines).
So despite my unwaver
ing respect for Mike Mont
gomery as a man, I'm still
going to remember this inci

dent as a blemish on that
otherwise spotless record.
As a principle, I'm not go
ing to rush to defend coach
es who commit violent mis
takes, however rare or inci
dental.
To do otherwise would be
to let the real offenders off
the hook.
