## Men's golf has impressive showing at Prestige at PGA West 
### â€” Ashley Westhem 
This week the No. 14 Stanford men's golf
team co-hosted, with UC-Davis, 15 teams at the
Prestige at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif.
Sitting in seventh after the first round, the
Card moved up two spots to finish the tourna
ment in fifth place with a score of 860, falling to
No. 4 Washington and No. 8 USC, who tied for
first with 851.
Individually, the Card had a stellar showing
from its lineup with three golfers finishing in
the top 20 despite windy conditions.
Senior Andrew Yun and junior Cameron
Wilson tied for seventh place. Yun's three-un
der-par 68 bumped Stanford up the two spots in
the leader board after the second round.
"The conditions were tough," Yun told
GoStanford.com. "I practiced hitting some low
shots, keeping it underneath the wind and try
ing to manage my game as best as I can. Luck
ily I executed all of the shots I wanted to hit and
kept it in play, which was really key."
Sophomore Patrick Rodgers finished in fif
teenth, senior Steven Kearney in 51st and
freshman David Boote in 65th.
Stanford next hits the course on March 8 in
the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters.
