# PITCHING PRIMES CARD WIN
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a tough three-game set at Rice in
which it could only muster four runs, the Car
dinal offense desperately needed a pick-me-up
in its home opener against Cal.
An erratic Golden Bear pitching staff that
had a hard time finding the strike zone all
evening was a welcome turn of events for the
No. 15 Cardinal (2-2), which was able to down
the Bears (3-1) 5-0.
The offense stalled hot, teeing off of Cal
starter Chris Muse-Fisher by greeting him
with three straight singles, including an RBI
base hit from star second baseman Danny
Diekroeger.
Designated hitter Austin Slater's RBI sin
gle only three batters later chased Muse-Fish
er, who only recorded one out on a sacrifice
bunt.
Golden Bear reliever Michael Lowden pre
vented further damage in the first by inducing
a double-play grounder from junior shortstop
Lonnie Kauppila.
For the rest of the night, the Cardinal of
fense was more subdued but was all too happy
to scrape together runs from the plentiful op
portunities that a wild Cal pitching staff pro
vided.
In the third inning, Cal reliever Collin
Monsour drilled Diekroeger in the middle of
his back with one out, the first of three hit bat
tel's on the night for the righty.
A wild pitch by Monsour that bounced 20
feet into the air and eluded catcher Andrew
Knapp allowed Diekroeger to scoot all the way
over to third base. A sharp groundout by first
baseman Brian Ragira brought Diekroeger
home in a bang-bang play. Although Knapp
did a nice job blocking the plate, the um
pire ruled that Diekroeger slid in just under
the tag.
The wildness continued in the fourth inning
as two more hit batters and a single set up a
bases-loaded walk by third baseman Alex
Blandino. The fourth run of the evening for the
Cardinal ended the night for Monsour. The re
liever had a disappointing performance, going
1.2 innings and giving up two runs on only two
hits but also handing out two walks and a stag
gering three hit batsmen.
Senior Justin Ringo, continuing his strong
hitting from the Rice series, added an RBI

triple in the sth inning to stretch the lead to 5-
0. Coming in as a pinch hitter, Ringo swatted
the first pitch he saw down the first base line
and into the right field corner, scoring Lonnie
Kauppila all the way from first base.
Thus far in the young season, Ringo has
been the most consistent hitter on the team,
leading the squad with an impressive .364 bat
ting average.
Slater also had a solid day at the plate, col
lecting the first two hits of his career en route
to a 2-for-3 performance in which he also
drove in a run.
Wednesday night also marked another
dominant performance from the Cardinal
pitching staff, which has only given up 10 runs
in four games and is now riding a 16-inning
scoreless streak.
Four Cardinal pitchers combined for a
five-hit shutout, highlighted by the perform
ance of sophomore David Schmidt, who bene
fited from the increased offensive output as he
earned the win. Schmidt delivered 3.2 strong
innings while giving up only three hits and
walking one batter.
"Anytime the bats come alive and we open
up an early lead, that's big for the pitching
staff," Schmidt said. "It just lets us go out
there and relax and make pitches. You want to

do it for your teammates, when they're put
ting runs up on the board, you realize you've
got to put it away and it really motivates us."
Junior Sam Lindquist threw two dominant
innings to wrap up the victory for the Cardi
nal. The big righty struck out four of the sev
en hitters he faced and only allowed one run
ner to reach base on a wild pitch after a strike
out.
Stanford will need its pitching staff to con
tinue to deliver strong performances that put
the offense in a position to win games. The bat
ters will also need to improve their consisten
cy so that the team can win even on days when
the pitching is less dominant.
After the four-hit outburst in the first in
ning, the Cardinal only mustered three hits in
the remaining eight innings on Wednesday.
Had it not been for the constant mistakes of
the Cal pitchers, it could potentially have been
a much closer game.
Stanford hopes to build off of this victory as
it prepares for a three-game series over the
weekend against Fresno State. The Card will
hope that its first series at home at Sunken Di
amond will jump-start its winning ways.
