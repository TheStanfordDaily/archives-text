# Menlo project tested
## Locals fight Arrillaga development 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
In an eight-acre strip of land shoehorned
between Menlo Park's Caltrain tracks and El
Camino Real, the battle for a John Arrillaga
'6O-sponsored development project has boiled
over amid resident protests.
According to Steve Elliott, Stanford's
managing director of development, the Uni
versity has owned this narrow piece of land
for almost all of Stanford's existence. Over
the past 50 years, the property has been
leased out to various auto dealerships, but on
March 31, their ground lease on the property
will expire and Stanford will have control of
the land once again.
Meanwhile, the complex, Arrillaga's most
recent project, started to take shape last sum
mer as Menlo Park passed its zoning plan for
the downtown project.
The development referred to as 500 El
Camino Real will incorporate â€”in the
form of four- and five-story office and resi
dential buildings about 96,000 square feet
of medical offices, 10,000 square feet for retail
space and over 200,000 square feet for up to
152 housing units.
"Our approach comes from about five
years ago when Menlo Park decided they
wanted [to develop]." Elliott said. "When we
got control of these properties, we wanted to
develop them on a comprehensive as opposed
to a pieeewise basis."
Meanwhile, a group named Save Menlo
Park has protested against the proposal,
forming after Stanford submitted plans for
the development in October. According to
Peria Ni, a group spokesperson, the group is
made up of about 500 community members,
many of whom are Stanford alumni or former
employees. Ni used to work at Stanford.
Ni claimed that Stanford had been given
an 87 percent increase in the development's
permitted size, and that Stanford decided
within weeks of the expansion in permission
to build medical offices. Ni argued that no
one in the community had considered the im
pact of medical offices and that the planned
development's site should have been desig
nated for low traffic housing.

"[The proposal] is terrible because of safe
ty," Ni asserted. "Menlo Park is split into an
east side and a west side by El Camino. The
middle school is on the west side, and the high
school is on the east side. Every day, hun
dreds of kids are crossing El Camino."
Menlo Park Planning Commissioner Hen
ry Riggs estimated that the development
could add 6,000 cars traveling up and down El
Camino Real on a regular basis.
"There could potentially be 20 percent in
crease in traffic because of these buildings,"
he said. "That's... a big increase."
However, he also defended Stanford's
right to build whatever they wanted on Uni
versity property.

"No one has ever said that it has to be all
residential," he said. "Stanford is just repeat
ing what is in the zoning guidelines for the
plans but people didn't count on what might
be the traffic impact if it does end up being
leased. But now they're looking at those num
bers."

Vincent Brassel, another Menlo Park
planning commissioner, mentioned another
critique of the proposal its low architectur
al appeal. Menlo Park doesn't have a commu
nity center, and, according to Brassel, the
land was "supposed to be a public benefit
community space for the city."
He said that many residents had anticipat
ed the land being turned into a scenic gather
ing space rather than a monolithic complex.
"It was a surprise to me that Stanford
showed so little concern for what had been ex
pected in terms of public amenities," Brassel
said. "That was disappointing."
According to Ni, if Stanford uses the land
for its own purposes, the University will pay
no property taxes. She added that citing
an exchange with a University representative
Stanford currently has no plans to com
pensate the local government to the taxes
that it might otherwise have collected, despite
the fact that many other schools, like Har
vard and MIT, adhere to similar practices.
"We've had three meetings with Stanford
management folks," Ni said. "But we would
love to meet with [University President John]
Hennessy and other administrators
so that they can hear from alumni
and employees that are very loyal to
Stanford but stunned by the poor
planning, design and management of
the entire project."

Asked about the reaction from
citizens about the proposal, Elliot re
iterated support for Stanford's cur
rent plan for the project.
"The property is a prominent lo
cation. It's a large property eight
acres. We knew there would be com
munity comments about the project,

and the purpose of the planning com
mission was to hear the comments
from them," he said. "Construction
will begin dependent on how long it
will take to get Menlo Park approval,
but we hope to start by next year."
Riggs acknowledged the tension
between some residents of Menlo
Park and the University.
"Everyone has their opinions
and preferences," Riggs said, ac
knowledging the challenges of re
designing the proposal. "I know
Stanford heard [the reaction] and
that the proposal is going to come
back with a different look. That
doesn't mean that we will approve
or that the neighbors will like it, and
it's going to go back and forth three
or four times."

Elliot said that resident con
cerns, especially regarding the
number of medical offices in the cur
rent proposal, have been heard and
evaluations have been put in place
to ensure the University puts for
ward an appropriate proposal.
Riggs expressed faith in the sys
tem despite simmering tensions, as
serting that the back-and-forth de
bate within the community will ulti
mately cause a good final result.
"My take on it is that it's just
part of a process that needs to hap
pen," he said. "It'll eventually come
out the right way, but I don't know
what that is."
