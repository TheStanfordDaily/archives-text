## Med School dean looks to future 
### SABELLE SMYTHE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Just three months into his time as dean of the
Stanford School of Medicine, Lloyd Minor has al
ready turned his attention to charting a plan for
the school's future.
Although Minor did not officially assume the
position until Dec. 1, he has communicated exten
sively with faculty, students and administrators in
the School of Medicine and the Stanford Medical
Center since his appointment was announced in
July.
According to Minor, that communication has fo
cused on developing three objectives advancing
innovation, empowering future leaders and trans
forming patient care while soliciting ideas and
feedback from the broader Stanford community
about the School of Medicine's future.
"I want to make sure that I understand the val
ues of Stanford and that I'm able to reflect those
values in my leadership," Minor said.
Born in Little Rock, Ark., Minor began his aca
demic career at Brown University, where he ma
jored in biology. He developed a clinical focus in
vestibular physiology, an area in which he became
interested after taking courses in mathematics

and bioengineering.
Within his field, Minor is known for his discov
ery of superior canal dehiscence syndrome, a con
dition of the inner ear leading to hearing and bal
ance problems, and his development of a surgical

procedure to correct the disorder.
Before coming to Stanford, Mi
nor served as Provost and Senior
Vice President of Academic Af
fairs for Johns Hopkins Universi
ty, where he oversaw the Univer
sity's nine schools, led budgeting
efforts and oversaw teaching and
research goals. Minor also taught
classes in otolaryngology, biomed
ical engineering and neuro
science.
Sam Gambhir, chair of the
School of Medicine's radiology de
partment, headed the selection
committee for the new Dean of
Medicine after Philip Pizzo, the
previous Dean of Medicine, re
signed last year. Pizzo had held the
position since April 2001.
According to Vice Dean of the
School of Medicine David Steven
son '7l, the nationwide selection
process was extremely intensive,
and was conducted by a "very well
constituted search committee."
Stevenson said that Minor has
"strong academic values," some
thing that became apparent soon

after Minor assumed the position.
"He's also a good synthesizer of
diverse perspectives, which I think
allows him to be comfortable with
diversity and helps him integrate
into the fabric of the school,"
Stevenson said.
According to Minor, academic
medicine currently faces a variety
of challenges, including a real de
crease in government funding for
biomedical research. However, Mi
nor remained positive about the
School's future.
"The key is that we approach
those challenges from a position of
strength, we approach those chal
lenges with the vision that we're go
ing to be an even better institution
three years from now than we are
today, and five years from now than
we are three years from now," Mi
nor said.
With his three-part plan for the
School of Medicine's future in mind,
optimism provided Minor with a re
curring theme.
"We here at Stanford have the
attitude that our best days are
ahead of us," Minor said. "We're
not looking backwards, we're look
ing forwards."
