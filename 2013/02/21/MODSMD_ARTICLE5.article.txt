## Recording voices of Stanford's past 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD 
As a co-chair of Stanford's
Oral History Program and as
a member of the Stanford com
munity for over 50 years Su
san Schofield '66 has lots of good
stories to tell spanning a lengthy
career. Her most memorable sto

As part of the Oral History
Program, which has recorded
over 160 interviews with faculty,
staff and alumni since its found

former vice president and
provost at Stanford, about his life
and experiences at the Universi

tracing his entire career,"
Schofield said. "He had been
chair of the psych department,
Dean of the [School of] Humani
ties and Sciences and provost,
and was just a thoroughly fabu
lous, delightful gentleman and a
great raconteur with lots of good
stories."
Because of Hastorf's impor
tance to the Stanford community,
the Stanford Historical Society
had planned to bind and publish
his interview. Unfortunately, soon
after the interviews were com
pleted, Schofield received some

bad news: Hastorf had been diag

The Society hurried to pub
lish the interviews, which they
presented to Hastorf and his
wife, Barbara, who brought the
book with her on her evening vis
its to her husband's hospice.
"The Society was able to get
the bound copy finished and pres
ent it to him before he passed
away â€”it was very special,"
Schofield said. "His wife would
read to him from it in the evening
it was very nice."
Beyond the interviews' per
