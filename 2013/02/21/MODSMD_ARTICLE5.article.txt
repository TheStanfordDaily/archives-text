## Recording voices of Stanford's past 
### ALEXA LIAUTAUD 
As a co-chair of Stanford's
Oral History Program and as
a member of the Stanford com
munity for over 50 years Su
san Schofield '66 has lots of good
stories to tell spanning a lengthy
career. Her most memorable sto
ry, however, is a recent one.
As part of the Oral History
Program, which has recorded
over 160 interviews with faculty,
staff and alumni since its found
ing in 1978, Schofield had sat
down to talk with Albert Hastorf,
former vice president and
provost at Stanford, about his life
and experiences at the Universi

ty-
"He and I did four or so inter
views over the course of the year,
tracing his entire career,"
Schofield said. "He had been
chair of the psych department,
Dean of the [School of] Humani
ties and Sciences and provost,
and was just a thoroughly fabu
lous, delightful gentleman and a
great raconteur with lots of good
stories."
Because of Hastorf's impor
tance to the Stanford community,
the Stanford Historical Society
had planned to bind and publish
his interview. Unfortunately, soon
after the interviews were com
pleted, Schofield received some

bad news: Hastorf had been diag
nosed with cancer.
The Society hurried to pub
lish the interviews, which they
presented to Hastorf and his
wife, Barbara, who brought the
book with her on her evening vis
its to her husband's hospice.
"The Society was able to get
the bound copy finished and pres
ent it to him before he passed
away —it was very special,"
Schofield said. "His wife would
read to him from it in the evening
it was very nice."
Beyond the interviews' per
sonal significance, Schofield said
the details of Hastorf's inter
views contributed to a richer
understanding of a key period
in Stanford's history.
The Oral History Pro
gram is run by the Stanford
Historical Society with the
purpose of conducting such
interviews with people sig
nificant to the University
community. In recent years,
additional donor support has
allowed the Program to go
from conducting four inter
views in 2007 to an average
of about 30 per year now.
The essence of the Oral
History program is to explore
and document how individuals
in the University community
interacted with and experi
enced transformative periods
of history. Right now, the Pro
gram's focus is mainly on "the
incredible post-World War II
period when Stanford began
to go from good to great," ac
cording to Schofield.
"There were people
around faculty, administra
tors who had been part of
that transformation and they
would have fabulous stories to
tell and perspectives to give
that weren't necessarily going
to be reflected in the written
record," Schofield added.
Personal anecdotes, cri
tiques, different perspectives
and situational analyses form
the centerpiece of the pro
gram.
"Think about a traditional
archive," said Daniel Hartwig,
the University's archivist.
"For example, the University

archives have professors' pa
pers which the professor has
given over perhaps after re
tiring; that is one primary
source that speaks to a per
son's experience at Stanford
but also Stanford iBtself...
Oral History helps to add a
personal perspective to his
torical documentation."
While the broad focus re
mains Stanford's "good-to
great" transformation post-
World War 11, the program's
increased support has permit
ted the pursuit of a number of
smaller, more acutely themed
projects.
"When we began, we were
really eager [to interview]
people who knew about Stan
ford and the time and the era
that we were going to be talk
ing to people about, but not
necessarily [their] individual
stories," Schofield said.
"There's a greater concern
now to tackle some of the less
er known, or ground-up
themes within the Universi
ty's history," Hartwig said,
"Taking both a top down and
bottom-up approach to docu
menting the University."
These have ranged from a
series called 'Alumni Stories'
looking at old Stanford tra
ditions and different under
graduate perspectives to
one on diversity to a project
on presidential families, look
ing at life in the Hoover
House. Both Hartwig and
Schofield also mentioned a
growing interest in pursuing a
smaller-themed project re
garding pioneering women.
"It's [about] turning our
eyes internally towards Stan
ford's own development,"
Schofield said.
Allison Tracy, one of two

professional oral historians
working within the Stanford
Historical Society and the
Oral History program, has
many different roles, one of
which is to coordinate and
train volunteers to effectively
interview the subjects.
"I'm trying to take [volun
teers] to the next level in
terms of the amount of inter
viewing that they're doing,"
Tracy said. "The volunteers
are a mix of people defi
nitely alumni, emeriti facul
ty and staff members, also a
handful of people who are
local to the Bay Area and
who are interested in oral
history."
According to Tracy, there
are currently no students in
volved in the interviewing
process. Students are, howev
er, involved in the indexing
and post-interview process,
which Schofield described as a
demanding responsibility.
"Once the interview is
completed, it is digitally
recorded and transcribed by
an outside service," Schofield
said. "Once the transcript is
back we do 'write-editing,'
which is a editorial clean up
process for the purpose of
clarity."
While the final product is
deposited in the University
archives, accessing most in
terviews no longer requires a
trip to Green Library.
"Now almost all of our oral
histories are available online
as either a transcript or an au
dio recording," Hartwig said.
"We're making all that as
available as we can,"
Schofield agreed.

had planned to bind and publish
his interview. Unfortunately, soon
after the interviews were com
pleted, Schofield received some

bad news: Hastorf had been diag
nosed with cancer.
The Society hurried to pub
lish the interviews, which they
presented to Hastorf and his
wife, Barbara, who brought the
book with her on her evening vis
its to her husband's hospice.
"The Society was able to get
the bound copy finished and pres
ent it to him before he passed
away —it was very special,"
Schofield said. "His wife would
read to him from it in the evening
it was very nice."
Beyond the interviews' per
sonal significance, Schofield said
the details of Hastorf's inter
views contributed to a richer
understanding of a key period
in Stanford's history.
The Oral History Pro
gram is run by the Stanford
Historical Society with the
purpose of conducting such
interviews with people sig
nificant to the University
community. In recent years,
additional donor support has
allowed the Program to go
from conducting four inter
views in 2007 to an average
of about 30 per year now.
The essence of the Oral
History program is to explore
and document how individuals
in the University community
interacted with and experi
enced transformative periods
of history. Right now, the Pro
gram's focus is mainly on "the
incredible post-World War II
period when Stanford began
to go from good to great," ac
cording to Schofield.
"There were people
around faculty, administra
tors who had been part of
that transformation and they
would have fabulous stories to
tell and perspectives to give
that weren't necessarily going
to be reflected in the written
record," Schofield added.
Personal anecdotes, cri
tiques, different perspectives
and situational analyses form
the centerpiece of the pro
gram.
"Think about a traditional
archive," said Daniel Hartwig,
the University's archivist.
"For example, the University

archives have professors' pa
pers which the professor has
given over perhaps after re
tiring; that is one primary
source that speaks to a per
son's experience at Stanford
but also Stanford iBtself...
Oral History helps to add a
personal perspective to his
torical documentation."
While the broad focus re
mains Stanford's "good-to
great" transformation post-
World War 11, the program's
increased support has permit
ted the pursuit of a number of
smaller, more acutely themed
projects.
"When we began, we were
really eager [to interview]
people who knew about Stan
ford and the time and the era
that we were going to be talk
ing to people about, but not
necessarily [their] individual
stories," Schofield said.
"There's a greater concern
now to tackle some of the less
er known, or ground-up
themes within the Universi
ty's history," Hartwig said,
"Taking both a top down and
bottom-up approach to docu
menting the University."
These have ranged from a
series called 'Alumni Stories'
looking at old Stanford tra
ditions and different under
graduate perspectives to
one on diversity to a project
on presidential families, look
ing at life in the Hoover
House. Both Hartwig and
Schofield also mentioned a
growing interest in pursuing a
smaller-themed project re
garding pioneering women.
"It's [about] turning our
eyes internally towards Stan
ford's own development,"
Schofield said.
Allison Tracy, one of two

professional oral historians
working within the Stanford
Historical Society and the
Oral History program, has
many different roles, one of
which is to coordinate and
train volunteers to effectively
interview the subjects.
"I'm trying to take [volun
teers] to the next level in
terms of the amount of inter
viewing that they're doing,"
Tracy said. "The volunteers
are a mix of people defi
nitely alumni, emeriti facul
ty and staff members, also a
handful of people who are
local to the Bay Area and
who are interested in oral
history."
According to Tracy, there
are currently no students in
volved in the interviewing
process. Students are, howev
er, involved in the indexing
and post-interview process,
which Schofield described as a
demanding responsibility.
"Once the interview is
completed, it is digitally
recorded and transcribed by
an outside service," Schofield
said. "Once the transcript is
back we do 'write-editing,'
which is a editorial clean up
process for the purpose of
clarity."
While the final product is
deposited in the University
archives, accessing most in
terviews no longer requires a
trip to Green Library.
"Now almost all of our oral
histories are available online
as either a transcript or an au
dio recording," Hartwig said.
"We're making all that as
available as we can,"
Schofield agreed.

As a co-chair of Stanford's
Oral History Program and as
a member of the Stanford com
munity for over 50 years Su
san Schofield '66 has lots of good
stories to tell spanning a lengthy
career. Her most memorable sto
ry, however, is a recent one.
As part of the Oral History
Program, which has recorded
over 160 interviews with faculty,
staff and alumni since its found
ing in 1978, Schofield had sat
down to talk with Albert Hastorf,
former vice president and
provost at Stanford, about his life
and experiences at the Universi

ty-
"He and I did four or so inter
views over the course of the year,
tracing his entire career,"
Schofield said. "He had been
chair of the psych department,
Dean of the [School of] Humani
ties and Sciences and provost,
and was just a thoroughly fabu
lous, delightful gentleman and a
great raconteur with lots of good
stories."
Because of Hastorf's impor
tance to the Stanford community,
the Stanford Historical Society
had planned to bind and publish
his interview. Unfortunately, soon
after the interviews were com
pleted, Schofield received some

bad news: Hastorf had been diag
nosed with cancer.
