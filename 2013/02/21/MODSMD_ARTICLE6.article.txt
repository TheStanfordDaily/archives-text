## New robotics club builds on freshman's old passion 
### SOO JI LEE 
For Eric Smalls 'l6, founder of the
Stanford Robotics Club, robotics was
never just a hobby it was the path to
a better life.
In October, Smalls was featured in a
campaign video for President Barack
Obama titled "Dear Mr. President,"
which has collected more than 67,000
views on You Tube.
In the video, Smalls described his ex
periences on his distinctly non-tradition
al path to Stanford. After his mother
died when he was three years old, Smalls
lived out of a car with his father and sis
ter, sharing less than $2 a day for food.
"Those years were very difficult, and
college was just a pipe dream," Smalls

said in the video.
Smalls eventually moved in with his
grandmother in Philadelphia and was
admitted to the George Washington
Carver High School of Engineering and
Science, where he served as president of
the robotics club. After building his first
fully functional robot in just one night,
Smalls discovered his passion for robot
ics.
"I was like 'Wow, I built this,'" Small
said. "That was my spark. Ever since
then, I just haven't stopped."
In the video, Smalls thanked Obama
for the science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) initiatives
that provided financial support to his
