## New robotics club builds on freshman's old passion 
### SOO JI LEE 
For Eric Smalls 'l6, founder of the
Stanford Robotics Club, robotics was
never just a hobby it was the path to
a better life.
In October, Smalls was featured in a
campaign video for President Barack
Obama titled "Dear Mr. President,"
which has collected more than 67,000
views on You Tube.
In the video, Smalls described his ex
periences on his distinctly non-tradition
al path to Stanford. After his mother
died when he was three years old, Smalls
lived out of a car with his father and sis
ter, sharing less than $2 a day for food.
"Those years were very difficult, and
college was just a pipe dream," Smalls

said in the video.
Smalls eventually moved in with his
grandmother in Philadelphia and was
admitted to the George Washington
Carver High School of Engineering and
Science, where he served as president of
the robotics club. After building his first
fully functional robot in just one night,
Smalls discovered his passion for robot
ics.
"I was like 'Wow, I built this,'" Small
said. "That was my spark. Ever since
then, I just haven't stopped."
In the video, Smalls thanked Obama
for the science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) initiatives
that provided financial support to his

Eric Smalls '16 founded the Stanford Robotics Club, which currently has 65
members and $27,000 in funding. He credits his passion for robotics, discovered
in high school, with helping him stay motivated and focused.
high school and allowed him to con
tinue to pursue his interest in ro
botics.
"If it wasn't for STEM initia
tives, the school I went to wouldn't
have had the money to maintain it
self," Smalls said. "It was my ticket
off the street. Having the opportu
nity to do robotics definitely kept
me motivated and focused on my
goals."
When Smalls arrived at Stan
ford for Admit Weekend last year,
he was surprised to discover that
his dream school was missing the
student group he wanted to join the
most the robotics club.
Smalls gathered a group of stu

dents interested in robotics and
submitted a petition to become a
voluntary student organization
(VSO) in October. The application
was accepted in December.
In the three months since its
founding, the Stanford Robotics
Club has grown to 65 active mem
bers and has raised over $27,000
through departmental and indus
try sponsorships, including $5,000
sponsorships from the Department
of Computer Science and the De
partment of Mechanical Engineer
ing.
The group has also garnered
the support of the Department of
Electrical Engineering, which has
granted club members 24-hour ac
cess to space in the basement of the
Packard Building. The Department
of Mechanical Engineering has also
allowed the club to use its Product
Realization Lab.

The club was officially regis
tered as a YSO a week after Smalls
took second place at the
Drone Games, a programming com
petition in San Francisco. At the
competition, Smalls collaborated
with John Backus 'l6 and Omar
Rizwan 'l6 who recently took a
leave of absence to become a Thiel
Fellow â€”to control multiple
drones from one computer. The
team competed against employees
from Twitter and Facebook.
"None of us slept and we pro
grammed for hours," Smalls said.
"Hackers do their best work at
night."
After his success at Drone Games,
Smalls started a quadrotors a type
of drone aircraft team. One of the
team's projects is the "Ikescopter,"
which the team hopes will eventual
ly be able to deliver an Ike's sand
wich order from a smartphone.

Although the group remains
busy building projects and entering
competitions, Smalls said that the
Stanford Robotics Club has also fo
cused on outreach. The club has
hosted monthly tech talks and
weekend workshops open to Stan
ford students interested in learning
more about robotics.
"Anyone that's in CS 106A can
do anything we're doing," Backus
said. "You don't have to be a mad
scientist to do robotics."
In January, the club launched
the "Build Tech Grants," a new
grants program for Robotics Club
members looking to build their own
projects. Applications for the
grants closed on Feb. 1, and more
than $3,000 in grant money was
awarded.
The Stanford Robotics Club al
so plans to enter future competi
tions such as the DARPA Robotics

challenge, where club members will
be required to build a humanoid ro
bot. The winner of the competition
receives a full-size humanoid robot
from Boston Dynamics, which
Smalls said would give the club an
opportunity to expand.
"If we win the humanoid robot,
then we can ask for more space be
cause it's getting pretty crowded
between all these competitions and
projects as we expand," he said.
Backus praised Smalls' efforts,
and said that Smalls' dedication has
played an integral role in the club's
success thus far.
"I've never seen someone so
solely focused on one task," Backus
said about Smalls. "He's always
thinking about how to improve the
robotics club."
