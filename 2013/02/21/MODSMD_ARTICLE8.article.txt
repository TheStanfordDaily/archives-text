## Open Office Hours brings faculty to Facebook 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Rob Dunbar, professor of environmental
earth system science, recently hosted office
hours from an unusual location the top of
an icebreaker at the McMurdo Station in
Antarctica.

Dunbar was just the mo
pant in Stanford's Open
Office Hours, a program
that allows faculty mem
bers and guest speakers to
film video responses to
questions from the Univer
sity's growing Facebook
fan base. The program
conceived by lan Hsu '9B
M.S. 'Ol, the University's

former director of Internet media outreach
was created in 2009. Since then, almost 30
speakers have hosted installments, with a to
tal of 64 videos posted.
According to Director of Digital Media
John Stafford M.A. 'O6, the purpose of the
program has remained the same throughout
its four-year duration.
"We want to offer another vehicle in which
we can share Stanford knowledge and re
search with audiences on the social web,"
Stafford said. "People are by and large excit
ed to have an opportunity to interact with all
these great minds at Stanford."
Although Facebook doesn't provide a view
count for videos, the most popular install
ments, as ranked by comments made, were
hosted by Professor Emeritus of Psychology
Philip Zimbardo whose videos received ap
proximately 110 comments and Dean of
Undergraduate Admission Richard Shaw,
whose videos received about 60 comments.

Videos range in length from two minutes
to over 15, and topics vary widely depending
on the speaker's area of expertise. Zimbardo
discussed the psychology of heroism in his
videos, while Shaw spoke about admissions
and student life at Stanford.
Director of Media Initiatives Melinda
Sacks '74, who is responsible for recruiting
professors and guests for Open Office Hours,
said that she often finds potential speakers by
simply "being nosy and curious."
"I really just keep my ears open for what I
think would be interesting," she said. "I try to
have as much diversity as possible in terms of
the topics and the schools that are represent
ed."

In the past, Sacks focused on finding inter
esting speakers and subsequently allowing
them to determine their speaking topics. For
recent installments, she has identified trends
or breaking news stories that would attract
viewers, and then found professors who could
provide commentary.

Sacks recruited Professor of Communica
tion Cliff Nass, who hosted two Open Office
Hour sessions in Dec. 2012, to discuss how
new technologies such as smart phones are in
fluencing human behavior.
Nass noted that participating in the pro
gram took little effort on his part, as he was
not responsible for filming, editing or posting
the videos.

"One of the big issues in online learning is
how much work it takes," Nass said. "For me
this took nothing. That low barrier to entry is
really key to this, it was so easy for me to do."
According to Nass, one of the fundamental
differences between Open Office Hours and
normal office hours is that the Facebook pro
gram allows viewers to determine the cur
riculum through their questions.
"The goal is really to give people what
they want rather than intellectually deciding
what they should learn," Nass said. "Whether
it is what I consider the most important thing
or not, it is their time, their opportunity to
find out whatever they want to know."
Helen Stacy, a senior fellow at the Free
man Spogli Institute for International Stud
ies, posted three installments of Open Office
Hours in Jan. and Feb. 2012. She emphasized
that, while she knew Stanford students and
alumni were analytical and well read, she was
impressed by how "probing and cutting edge"
the questions were.
"It really showed me how up to date and
linked in to current affairs and contemporary
debates the Stanford online community is,"
Stacy said.
Open Office Hours has also featured pub
lic figures affiliated with Stanford, including
Bill Gates, Kevin Bacon and James Franco,
whose mother Betsy graduated in 1969.
"Stanford is lucky because we have lots of
very interesting visitors to campus, ranging
from celebrities to government people to peo
ple in public policy," Sacks said. "I think it's
great to have a combination of people every
body knows and maybe celebrities, and also
those that haven't already had a lot of visibil
ity that we can bring out through Open Office
Hours."

While neither Sacks nor Stafford had spe
cific plans for expanding Open Office Hours,
both anticipate building on the program in the
future with the goal of producing one or two
installments every month.
"It really works well for most topics, even
if all it does is open the door and show people,
'Here's an area you might not have thought
about, or here is a person you might not have
heard about who is doing fantastic work,"'
Sacks said. "It serves a real purpose for the
University."
