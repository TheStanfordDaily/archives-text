## CAPS finds demand for services at E1 Centro 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the two years since El Centro Chicano
first began hosting clinical services provided
by the Counseling and Psychological Servic
es (CAPS), the initiative has received exten
sive student usage, according to students and
administrators.
Alejandro Martinez, senior associate di
rector for consultation and liaison at CAPS,
said that students use up the eight hours of
clinician services offered in the community
center's wellness room each week. Six of
those hours are set aside for appointments,
while two offer drop-in availability.
While El Centro Chicano and CAPS have
had a long-standing relationship, the 2011 ini
tiative to offer clinical consultations within
the center reflected a desire to make mental
health resources more accessible.
"We decided that a community-based ap

proach for counseling would really work well
for students that may have some apprehen
sion about coming to our [medical] center,"
Martinez said. "So rather than wait for them
to come to us, we decided that it would be in
the best interest of student's mental health to
be in places where they may be most comfort
able."
Cesar Torres 'l3, marketing and publicity
officer for El Centro Chicano, said that the
center's standing reputation among students
for offering a variety of programs adds to the
level of comfort cited by Martinez.
"Psychological health is oftentimes ... a
stigma within the community," Torres said.
"A lot of people right now suffer from
mental health issues and to have that support
in the community structure that the center
has makes it a valuable program," he added.
