## CAPS finds demand for services at E1 Centro 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the two years since El Centro Chicano
first began hosting clinical services provided
by the Counseling and Psychological Servic
es (CAPS), the initiative has received exten
sive student usage, according to students and
administrators.
Alejandro Martinez, senior associate di
rector for consultation and liaison at CAPS,
said that students use up the eight hours of
clinician services offered in the community
center's wellness room each week. Six of
those hours are set aside for appointments,
while two offer drop-in availability.
While El Centro Chicano and CAPS have
had a long-standing relationship, the 2011 ini
tiative to offer clinical consultations within
the center reflected a desire to make mental
health resources more accessible.
"We decided that a community-based ap

proach for counseling would really work well
for students that may have some apprehen
sion about coming to our [medical] center,"
Martinez said. "So rather than wait for them
to come to us, we decided that it would be in
the best interest of student's mental health to
be in places where they may be most comfort
able."
Cesar Torres 'l3, marketing and publicity
officer for El Centro Chicano, said that the
center's standing reputation among students
for offering a variety of programs adds to the
level of comfort cited by Martinez.
"Psychological health is oftentimes ... a
stigma within the community," Torres said.
"A lot of people right now suffer from
mental health issues and to have that support
in the community structure that the center
has makes it a valuable program," he added.
Frances Morales, executive dean and di-
rector of El Centro Chicano, said
that CAPS' efforts to house clinical
services at the center fit well with
the center's intent to better serve
student needs.
"As we continued to ask our
selves what else can we provide for
our students, mental health and
wellness was an area that we want
ed to focus on," Morales said.
After initial brainstorming, the
center decided to turn an old stor
age room previously used by stu
dent groups like Ballet Folklorico
for storing costumes into the
current wellness room.
Renovation of the room took
place during the summer of 2011 in
time for the clinical services to be
offered that fall. Major work includ
ed painting the walls green a col
or Martinez recommended for its
calming effect.
According to Morales, El Centro
Chicano student staff sent an
email over the summer through
the center's mailing list asking
students to submit pictures of
beaches. Those now decorate the
room in an effort to provide a re
laxing atmosphere.
While CAPS currently collabo
rates with six other community cen
ters to provide mental health sup
port for students, only El Centro
Chicano, the Asian American Activ
ities Center and the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center provide room
for clinical counseling services.
"Space is at a premium at Stan
ford and the centers are very com
pact— they use their space effi
ciently," Martinez said.
While the other three centers
have expressed interest in further
integration with CAPS, according
to Martinez, they lack the required
space.
"We have to be attentive to con
fidentiality and make sure that
there is private space and that is

not always available in each of the
community centers," Martinez said.
CAPS also provides other serv
ices to promote mental health and
wellness in collaboration with eth
nic communities.
"We also work with community
center directors and staff on educa
tional programs on mental health,"
Martinez said.
In El Centro Chicano, work
shops are held on a quarterly basis
covering topics such as stress man
agement and interpersonal rela
tionships.
"It depends on the interest of
our students," Martinez said. "So if
there is a student request to do this
kind of workshop, we will organize
it with them and do it the way they

feel it's going to work most effec
tively."

According to Morales, students
sometimes take advantage of the
wellness room for personal matters.
Once in a while, if a student has
suffered a loss in the family, they
may want to share that with the
other students in a private setting,"
Morales said.
The room is also used for a num
ber of other purposes, including of
fice hours with Laura Dominguez
Chan 'B9, a student affairs officer
from the Career Development Cen
ter.
