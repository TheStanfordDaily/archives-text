Stanford Continuing Studies presents
Pictures People Hate with Hal Buell
Monday, February 25
7:30 pm
Cubberley Auditorium
School of Education
Stanford University
Free and open to the public
Have you seen pictures in daily newspapers that prompted the
question: "Why did they print this photograph?" Images that
touch the deep emotions of viewers have prompted severe
comment from readers since photography was invented. The
debate takes place on the slippery slope where the right to
know and an invasion of privacy clash.
Veteran photo editor Hal Buell has handled many such pictures
over his half-century career in news photography, in this
presentation, he offers the audience its chance to call the shot:
Publish or don't publish photos from disasters and crime
scenes, with sexual content, and of other subjects that have
sparked controversy. This is an audience participation
presentation sure to offer a stimulating look at journalistic
ethics and taste in today's world of photojournalism.
