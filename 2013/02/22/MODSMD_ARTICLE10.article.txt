# APPEL SEEKS FIRST WIN
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Returns have been mixed for
the No. 15 Stanford baseball team
this season. The unexpected domi
nance of the Cardinal's young
pitching staff, which has allowed a
mere seven earned runs in four
games, has more or less counter
acted the slumbering bats in its
seasoned lineup, which have man
aged just six extra-base hits.
But in a rematch of one of the
highest-scoring series Stanford
played in last season the teams
combined for 38 runs in three

games look for both of those
trends to regress to the mean as
Fresno State (1-2) visits Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Though the Cardinal (2-2) will
be without junior slugger Austin
Wilson for at least a few more
weeks because of an elbow strain,
its lineup is just too powerful to
stay silent for very much longer.
Stanford still lacks a home run it
had five through the first four
games in 2012 and cleanup hit
ter Alex Blandino is only 2-for-12
on the young season.
Those numbers have a lot to do
with Rice's pitching on opening

weekend. The Cardinal struggled
against the Owls' breaking balls
while plating just four runners in
the series loss.
"They attacked us very well and
had really good breaking balls, and
early in the year we hadn't seen
that," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "I wish we would've won a
couple more games, but it was good
[for us]."
Stanford's early growth was ev
ident in Wednesday's win against
Cal. The Cardinal jumped out to a
2-0 lead with five productive at
bats four singles and a sac bunt
to lead off the game, and though

Stanford batters only had three
more hits on the evening, their pa
tience at the plate yielded four
walks and four hit-by-pitches.
The squad's best hitter to this
point, junior second baseman Dan
ny Diekroeger, kept up his consis
tent production and came around
to score twice, but a new face led
the charge against the Bears.
Sophomore designated hitter
Austin Slater registered the first
two hits of his career and knocked
in a run, signaling at least a short
term solution in the order as for
mer designated hitter Justin Ringo
takes over outfielding duties in
place of other struggling hitters.
"I waited a while to get my
chance and finally got it," Slater
said of his first hit. "It felt good."
Stanford's pitching success has
also come from unexpected
sources. Freshmen relievers Bobby
Zarubin, Daniel Starwalt and Mar
cus Brakeman have allowed no
earned runs and only seven hits in
10 combined innings of work,
though their classmate, lefty Lo
gan James, allowed all three Rice
runs in the Cardinal's loss on Sun
day. Solid outings by sophomores
John Hochstatter and David
Schmidt are also encouraging, but
both of those hurlers started
strong in 2012 before tailing off by
season's end.
Senior Mark Appel will be look
ing to shake off his uncharacteristic
loss in Houston. Though Appel on
ly gave up two earned runs, Stan
ford will need its star righty to last
longer than the five innings he got
through in his hometown if it ex
pects to have any success in the
long run this season.
Of course, Appel's only loss of
the 2012 regular season and the
first defeat of last season for the

Huestis leads with
double-double
By DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Junior Josh Huestis tallied his
eighth double-double of the season
while recording a team-high 20 points
and Stanford beat Oregon State 82-72
on the road to make it back to .500 in
the Pac-12 with just four conference
games left to play.
It was a battle of opposites down low
for much of the night. Huestis' slim
frame and expansive Afro prevailed
over Oregon State star Joe Burton's
mass and Mr. T-style haircut to lead the
Cardinal (16-11, 7-7 Pac-12) to a win.
It certainly wasn't easy. Burton
dominated early with 12 first-half
points on a slew of hook shots and
drives, drawing two early fouls from
junior Dwight Powell, who played
through early foul trouble to finish with
14 points and 11 boards.
But a swarming Stanford defense
held Burton to only four points in the
second half. Huestis took over at that
point, shooting efficiently from both the
field (7-13) and the free throw line (6-8)
in the game.
On the other side, Roberto Nelson
of Oregon State (13-14, 3-11) worked
his hardest to keep the Beavers in the

Card returns to face Cal after two-week break
By OLIVIA MOORE
DESK EDITOR
After disappointing losses against UCLA and
USC on the road, the No. 28 Stanford men's ten
nis team is looking to move back to .500 on the sea
son in Sunday's nonconference match at No. 12
Cal.
The clash between the Cardinal (34) and the
rival Golden Bears (44) is predicted to be one of
the closest of the season.
Though Cal has had a more successful season
thus far, Stanford has had more time to prepare
for the matchup. Cal spent the weekend at the Na
tional Tennis Indoor Championships in Seattle,
while Stanford did not qualify for the champi
onships and has enjoyed a two-week break from
match play.
"It's going to be a full week for Cal between
their matches this weekend and when we play
them on Sunday," said sophomore John Morrissey.
"The main advantage that we get from not playing
this weekend is that we had a large chunk of time
to really prepare and work on things and improve
our game."
Sophomore singles player Robert Stineman
agreed, saying that while it's been "mellow" hav
ing a break on back-to-back weekends, the team is
"ready to get back into competition."
"We've been working hard, training really
hard," Stineman said. "We've been focusing on
stuff that we felt needed to improve based on our
previous matches, especially the matches down in
LA"

Card returns to face Cal after two-week break
By OLIVIA MOORE

After disappointing losses against UCLA and
USC on the road, the No. 28 Stanford men's ten
nis team is looking to move back to .500 on the sea
son in Sunday's nonconference match at No. 12
Cal.
The clash between the Cardinal (34) and the
rival Golden Bears (44) is predicted to be one of
the closest of the season.
Though Cal has had a more successful season
thus far, Stanford has had more time to prepare
for the matchup. Cal spent the weekend at the Na
tional Tennis Indoor Championships in Seattle,
while Stanford did not qualify for the champi
onships and has enjoyed a two-week break from
match play.
"It's going to be a full week for Cal between
their matches this weekend and when we play
them on Sunday," said sophomore John Morrissey.
"The main advantage that we get from not playing
this weekend is that we had a large chunk of time
to really prepare and work on things and improve
our game."
Sophomore singles player Robert Stineman
agreed, saying that while it's been "mellow" hav
ing a break on back-to-back weekends, the team is
"ready to get back into competition."
"We've been working hard, training really
hard," Stineman said. "We've been focusing on

Returns have been mixed for
the No. 15 Stanford baseball team
this season. The unexpected domi
nance of the Cardinal's young
pitching staff, which has allowed a
mere seven earned runs in four
games, has more or less counter
acted the slumbering bats in its
seasoned lineup, which have man
aged just six extra-base hits.
But in a rematch of one of the
highest-scoring series Stanford
played in last season the teams
combined for 38 runs in three

games look for both of those
trends to regress to the mean as
Fresno State (1-2) visits Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Though the Cardinal (2-2) will
be without junior slugger Austin
Wilson for at least a few more
weeks because of an elbow strain,
its lineup is just too powerful to
stay silent for very much longer.
Stanford still lacks a home run it
had five through the first four
games in 2012 and cleanup hit
ter Alex Blandino is only 2-for-12
on the young season.
Those numbers have a lot to do
with Rice's pitching on opening

weekend. The Cardinal struggled
against the Owls' breaking balls
while plating just four runners in
the series loss.
"They attacked us very well and
had really good breaking balls, and
early in the year we hadn't seen
that," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "I wish we would've won a
couple more games, but it was good
[for us]."
Stanford's early growth was ev
ident in Wednesday's win against
Cal. The Cardinal jumped out to a
2-0 lead with five productive at
bats four singles and a sac bunt
to lead off the game, and though

Stanford batters only had three
more hits on the evening, their pa
tience at the plate yielded four
walks and four hit-by-pitches.
The squad's best hitter to this
point, junior second baseman Dan
ny Diekroeger, kept up his consis
tent production and came around
to score twice, but a new face led
the charge against the Bears.
Sophomore designated hitter
Austin Slater registered the first
two hits of his career and knocked
in a run, signaling at least a short
term solution in the order as for
mer designated hitter Justin Ringo
takes over outfielding duties in
place of other struggling hitters.
"I waited a while to get my
chance and finally got it," Slater
said of his first hit. "It felt good."
Stanford's pitching success has
also come from unexpected
sources. Freshmen relievers Bobby
Zarubin, Daniel Starwalt and Mar
cus Brakeman have allowed no
earned runs and only seven hits in
10 combined innings of work,
though their classmate, lefty Lo
gan James, allowed all three Rice
runs in the Cardinal's loss on Sun
day. Solid outings by sophomores
John Hochstatter and David
Schmidt are also encouraging, but
both of those hurlers started
strong in 2012 before tailing off by
season's end.
Senior Mark Appel will be look
ing to shake off his uncharacteristic
loss in Houston. Though Appel on
ly gave up two earned runs, Stan
ford will need its star righty to last
longer than the five innings he got
through in his hometown if it ex
pects to have any success in the
long run this season.

Huestis leads with
double-double
By DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Junior Josh Huestis tallied his
eighth double-double of the season
while recording a team-high 20 points
and Stanford beat Oregon State 82-72
on the road to make it back to .500 in
the Pac-12 with just four conference
games left to play.
It was a battle of opposites down low
for much of the night. Huestis' slim
frame and expansive Afro prevailed
over Oregon State star Joe Burton's
mass and Mr. T-style haircut to lead the
Cardinal (16-11, 7-7 Pac-12) to a win.
It certainly wasn't easy. Burton
dominated early with 12 first-half
points on a slew of hook shots and
drives, drawing two early fouls from
junior Dwight Powell, who played
through early foul trouble to finish with
14 points and 11 boards.
But a swarming Stanford defense
held Burton to only four points in the
second half. Huestis took over at that
point, shooting efficiently from both the
field (7-13) and the free throw line (6-8)
in the game.
On the other side, Roberto Nelson
of Oregon State (13-14, 3-11) worked
his hardest to keep the Beavers in the
game. While he did little for the team

sources. Freshmen relievers Bobby
Zarubin, Daniel Starwalt and Mar
cus Brakeman have allowed no
earned runs and only seven hits in
10 combined innings of work,
though their classmate, lefty Lo

runs in the Cardinal's loss on Sun
day. Solid outings by sophomores
John Hochstatter and David
Schmidt are also encouraging, but
both of those hurlers started
strong in 2012 before tailing off by
season's end.
Senior Mark Appel will be look
ing to shake off his uncharacteristic
loss in Houston. Though Appel on
ly gave up two earned runs, Stan
ford will need its star righty to last
longer than the five innings he got
through in his hometown if it ex
pects to have any success in the
long run this season.
Of course, Appel's only loss of

wins in
Corvallis
Huestis leads with
double-double
By DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD
SENIOR STAFF WRITER
Junior Josh Huestis tallied his
eighth double-double of the season
while recording a team-high 20 points
and Stanford beat Oregon State 82-72
on the road to make it back to .500 in
the Pac-12 with just four conference
games left to play.
It was a battle of opposites down low
for much of the night. Huestis' slim
frame and expansive Afro prevailed
over Oregon State star Joe Burton's
mass and Mr. T-style haircut to lead the
Cardinal (16-11, 7-7 Pac-12) to a win.
It certainly wasn't easy. Burton
dominated early with 12 first-half
points on a slew of hook shots and
drives, drawing two early fouls from
junior Dwight Powell, who played
through early foul trouble to finish with
14 points and 11 boards.
But a swarming Stanford defense
held Burton to only four points in the
second half. Huestis took over at that
point, shooting efficiently from both the
field (7-13) and the free throw line (6-8)
in the game.
On the other side, Roberto Nelson
of Oregon State (13-14, 3-11) worked
his hardest to keep the Beavers in the
game. While he did little for the team
outside of scoring and was a particu
larly inefficient 10-26 from the field

As a player, it's hard to picture the moment when
you will walk down the court with your parents in
your last home game as a Cardinal athlete.
But Senior Night is inevitable, and Stanford
women's basketball forwards Joslyn Tinkle and
Mikaela Ruef will take part this Sunday night when
the No. 4 Card (24-2,13-1) faces Oregon (4-22,2-12).
"It's mind boggling to me. [The season] just goes
by so fast," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
hope we have a good turnout
for both Jos and Mikaela
Ruef."
Tinkle has recorded 12.6
points per game and 6.2 re

trailing only junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Ogwu

the five on the 2012-13 Capital

"[Tinkle] has had an awe

I enjoy coaching her because

great defense. What else could
I ask for?"

Card returns to face Cal after two-week break
By OLIVIA MOORE
DESK EDITOR
After disappointing losses against UCLA and
USC on the road, the No. 28 Stanford men's ten
nis team is looking to move back to .500 on the sea
son in Sunday's nonconference match at No. 12
Cal.
The clash between the Cardinal (34) and the
rival Golden Bears (44) is predicted to be one of
the closest of the season.
Though Cal has had a more successful season
thus far, Stanford has had more time to prepare
for the matchup. Cal spent the weekend at the Na
tional Tennis Indoor Championships in Seattle,
while Stanford did not qualify for the champi
onships and has enjoyed a two-week break from
match play.
"It's going to be a full week for Cal between
their matches this weekend and when we play
them on Sunday," said sophomore John Morrissey.
"The main advantage that we get from not playing
this weekend is that we had a large chunk of time
to really prepare and work on things and improve
our game."
Sophomore singles player Robert Stineman
agreed, saying that while it's been "mellow" hav
ing a break on back-to-back weekends, the team is
"ready to get back into competition."
"We've been working hard, training really
hard," Stineman said. "We've been focusing on
stuff that we felt needed to improve based on our
previous matches, especially the matches down in
LA"

Stanford failed to score quickly
when these two teams met in last

Returns have been mixed for
the No. 15 Stanford baseball team
this season. The unexpected domi
nance of the Cardinal's young
pitching staff, which has allowed a
mere seven earned runs in four
games, has more or less counter
acted the slumbering bats in its
seasoned lineup, which have man
aged just six extra-base hits.
But in a rematch of one of the
highest-scoring series Stanford
played in last season the teams
combined for 38 runs in three

games look for both of those
trends to regress to the mean as
Fresno State (1-2) visits Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Though the Cardinal (2-2) will
be without junior slugger Austin
Wilson for at least a few more
weeks because of an elbow strain,
its lineup is just too powerful to
stay silent for very much longer.
Stanford still lacks a home run it
had five through the first four
games in 2012 and cleanup hit
ter Alex Blandino is only 2-for-12
on the young season.
Those numbers have a lot to do
with Rice's pitching on opening

weekend. The Cardinal struggled
against the Owls' breaking balls
while plating just four runners in
the series loss.
"They attacked us very well and
had really good breaking balls, and
early in the year we hadn't seen
that," said head coach Mark Mar
quess. "I wish we would've won a
couple more games, but it was good
[for us]."
Stanford's early growth was ev
ident in Wednesday's win against
Cal. The Cardinal jumped out to a
2-0 lead with five productive at
bats four singles and a sac bunt
to lead off the game, and though

Stanford batters only had three
more hits on the evening, their pa
tience at the plate yielded four
walks and four hit-by-pitches.
The squad's best hitter to this
point, junior second baseman Dan
ny Diekroeger, kept up his consis
tent production and came around
to score twice, but a new face led
the charge against the Bears.
Sophomore designated hitter
Austin Slater registered the first
two hits of his career and knocked
in a run, signaling at least a short
term solution in the order as for
mer designated hitter Justin Ringo
takes over outfielding duties in
place of other struggling hitters.
"I waited a while to get my
chance and finally got it," Slater
said of his first hit. "It felt good."
Stanford's pitching success has
also come from unexpected
sources. Freshmen relievers Bobby
Zarubin, Daniel Starwalt and Mar
cus Brakeman have allowed no
earned runs and only seven hits in
10 combined innings of work,
though their classmate, lefty Lo
