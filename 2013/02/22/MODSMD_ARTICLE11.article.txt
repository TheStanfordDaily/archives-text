## Stanford wins in Corvallis Huestis leads with double-double 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior Josh Huestis tallied his
eighth double-double of the season
while recording a team-high 20 points
and Stanford beat Oregon State 82-72
on the road to make it back to .500 in
the Pac-12 with just four conference
games left to play.
It was a battle of opposites down low
for much of the night. Huestis' slim
frame and expansive Afro prevailed
over Oregon State star Joe Burton's
mass and Mr. T-style haircut to lead the
Cardinal (16-11, 7-7 Pac-12) to a win.

It certainly wasn't easy. Burton
dominated early with 12 first-half
points on a slew of hook shots and
drives, drawing two early fouls from
junior Dwight Powell, who played
through early foul trouble to finish with
14 points and 11 boards.
But a swarming Stanford defense
held Burton to only four points in the
second half. Huestis took over at that
point, shooting efficiently from both the
field (7-13) and the free throw line (6-8)
in the game.
On the other side, Roberto Nelson
of Oregon State (13-14, 3-11) worked
his hardest to keep the Beavers in the
game. While he did little for the team
outside of scoring and was a particu
larly inefficient 10-26 from the field

he hit several tough shots and came
alive in the second half en route to a
game-high 28 points
With few outside of Nelson and
Burton giving the Beavers any
thing to work with, Stanford led for
almost the entire half, but just bare
ly. A Nelson jump shot made it 35-
34 Cardinal heading into the break.
The back-and-forth affair con
tinued for the first few minutes of
the second half before a mini-run
by Stanford gave the Card a bit of
breathing room with 15 minutes to
play.
But that too, was short-lived, as
the Beavers roared back with two
quick scores from Nelson brought
the back down to two just moments
later.
Then neither team seemed to be
able to gain any kind of edge, with
Aaron Bright heating up for a while
and Huestis getting back involved
only to be matched by Nelson he
had 19 in the half.
A three-pointer from Bright
with under two minutes to play
proved a dagger, however, pushing
the lead up to seven and forcing
Oregon State to foul the Cardinal in
the final minute. After not attempt
ing a shot from the charity stripe in
the first half, Stanford hit its free
throws down the stretch and
walked out of Gill Coliseum with
just its fourth road victory of the
season.
The main advantage for the
Cardinal came in its balance. All
five starters finished with double
figures in scoring, while only three
from Oregon State did.
Not only did the balance come in
scoring, but also in simply taking
shots. Three starters had 11 shots,
while only Huestis put it up more,
with 13 shots on the night.
The Beavers were also done in
by abysmal shooting from behind
the three-point arc as Nelson went
just 1-9 and the team a mere 2-15.
Stanford is now 7-7 in the Pac
-12, moving closer to the top teams
with five games remaining. While
they did not pass anyone in the
standings with the win, which also
completed a season sweep of the
Beavers, there is a cluster of teams
ahead of them with five and six loss
es.
The Card has a chance to build
more momentum when it takes on
No. 23 Oregon tied for first in
the Pac-12 —on Saturday. The
game will tipoff at 5 p.m. from Eu
gene, Ore.
