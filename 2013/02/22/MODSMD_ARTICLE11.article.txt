## Stanford wins in Corvallis Huestis leads with double-double 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior Josh Huestis tallied his
eighth double-double of the season
while recording a team-high 20 points
and Stanford beat Oregon State 82-72
on the road to make it back to .500 in
the Pac-12 with just four conference
games left to play.
It was a battle of opposites down low
for much of the night. Huestis' slim
frame and expansive Afro prevailed
over Oregon State star Joe Burton's
mass and Mr. T-style haircut to lead the
Cardinal (16-11, 7-7 Pac-12) to a win.

It certainly wasn't easy. Burton
dominated early with 12 first-half
points on a slew of hook shots and
drives, drawing two early fouls from
junior Dwight Powell, who played
through early foul trouble to finish with
14 points and 11 boards.
But a swarming Stanford defense
held Burton to only four points in the
second half. Huestis took over at that
point, shooting efficiently from both the
field (7-13) and the free throw line (6-8)
in the game.
On the other side, Roberto Nelson
of Oregon State (13-14, 3-11) worked
his hardest to keep the Beavers in the
game. While he did little for the team
outside of scoring and was a particu
larly inefficient 10-26 from the field
