# Seniors to be honored
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
As a player, it's hard to picture the moment when
you will walk down the court with your parents in
your last home game as a Cardinal athlete.
But Senior Night is inevitable, and Stanford
women's basketball forwards Joslyn Tinkle and
Mikaela Ruef will take part this Sunday night when
the No. 4 Card (24-2,13-1) faces Oregon (4-22,2-12).
"It's mind boggling to me. [The season] just goes

by so fast," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
hope we have a good turnout
for both Jos and Mikaela
Ruef."
Tinkle has recorded 12.6
points per game and 6.2 re
bounds per game this season,
trailing only junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Ogwu
mike, recently named one of
the five on the 2012-13 Capital
One Academic All-America Di
vision I Women's Basketball
Team, leads the Card with 22.7
ppg and 12.3 rpg.
"[Tinkle] has had an awe
some year," said VanDerveer.
"She's been a great leader, a
high-energy player. She's al
ways enthusiasticâ€” every
day I remind myself how much
I enjoy coaching her because
we're really going to miss
coaching her next year. She's a
fun person. Every time, you
can hear her laughing from the
front of the bus. And she's
making great threes, rebound
ing the heck out of it, playing
great defense. What else could
I ask for?"
Originally recruited as a
center, Tinkle developed into a
shooting guard her sophomore
year. The senior now bounces
between forward and small
forward and this season has
showed her electric versatility
not only under the basket, but
also from behind the three-
