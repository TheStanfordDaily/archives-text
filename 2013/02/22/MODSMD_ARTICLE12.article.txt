# Seniors to be honored
## 
### ASHLEY WESTHEM DESK EDITOR 
As a player, it's hard to picture the moment when
you will walk down the court with your parents in
your last home game as a Cardinal athlete.
But Senior Night is inevitable, and Stanford
women's basketball forwards Joslyn Tinkle and
Mikaela Ruef will take part this Sunday night when
the No. 4 Card (24-2,13-1) faces Oregon (4-22,2-12).
"It's mind boggling to me. [The season] just goes

by so fast," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
hope we have a good turnout
for both Jos and Mikaela
Ruef."
Tinkle has recorded 12.6
points per game and 6.2 re
bounds per game this season,
trailing only junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Ogwu
mike, recently named one of
the five on the 2012-13 Capital
One Academic All-America Di
vision I Women's Basketball
Team, leads the Card with 22.7
ppg and 12.3 rpg.
"[Tinkle] has had an awe
some year," said VanDerveer.
"She's been a great leader, a
high-energy player. She's al
ways enthusiastic— every
day I remind myself how much
I enjoy coaching her because
we're really going to miss
coaching her next year. She's a
fun person. Every time, you
can hear her laughing from the
front of the bus. And she's
making great threes, rebound
ing the heck out of it, playing
great defense. What else could
I ask for?"
Originally recruited as a
center, Tinkle developed into a
shooting guard her sophomore
year. The senior now bounces
between forward and small
forward and this season has
showed her electric versatility
not only under the basket, but
also from behind the three-

GAME NOTES: Stanford opens up its Senior Weekend with a
matchup against Oregon State. Earlier this season, the
Cardinal took a 65-45 victory in Corvallis, and with a win
tonight, Stanford would make it 27 straight victories over
the Beavers. The Cardinal is led by junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike, who yesterday was named to the Capital One
Academic All-America Team.

point line.
Her willingness to do anything
and play any position has allowed
her to step up and lead the team
alongside Ogwumike with their de
sire to score, grab every loose ball
and pick up the defensive intensity.
"It takes a lot to play at this kind
of program at this kind of level,"
said Tinkle. "But aside from all the
hard work and sacrifice and pain,
when I look back on it [playing bas
ketball at Stanford], it brings the
biggest smile to my face because it
has been such an awesome experi
ence here."
Although Ruef, as a redshirt
junior, has one more year of eligibil
ity, she will be honored with Tinkle
on Senior Night since the pair
joined the team together. It is un
certain whether she will return for
a fifth year on the Farm, but the
Card will cross its fingers that it
gets another year of Ruef's dynam
ic play.
Last week against USC, Ruef
topped her career high in scoring
with 12 points and had her second
double-double of the season against
UCLA.
"Mikaela is stepping up big
time," VanDerveer said. "We need
her out there. We went through a
spurt where she came out of our
starting line up, but now she's back
in it and we need her out there
her defense, her passing, her scor
ing. She's had two double-doubles

in the last three games, her career
high, so she's playing awesome.
And she loves playing with Joslyn.
Those two are great friends."
Before Stanford can focus on
Oregon though, it must take down
Oregon State (9-17, 3-11) tonight.
Earlier this season, the Card had
no difficulty with either team, beat
ing the Beavers 65-45 and defeating
the Ducks 86-62.
"We want Jos and Mikaela to go
off on a great Senior Night and that
means, with Oregon, just limiting
their transition baskets because
they like to get out and score quick
ly," Ogwumike said. "Then with
Oregon State, being able to read
the defense, because they play
scout defense. Playing good, fast
basketball will put us in the best po
sition so we have a good Senior
Night."
The Card remains tied for first
place in the Pac-12 with rival No. 6
Cal. With wins over USC and
UCLA last weekend, Stanford se
cured a first-round bye at the Pac
-12 Tournament. Now, the Cardinal
will try to earn a high seed and the
right to host the first round of the
NCAA Tournament.
"Each game is going to be a
fight. It's going to be a battle," Tin
kle said. "So I'm going to do whatev
er it takes for me to be out there and
for our team to win."
The Card tips off against Oregon
State tonight at 8 p.m. and at 4 p.m.

at Maples Pavilion.

GAME NOTES: Stanford opens up its Senior Weekend with a
matchup against Oregon State. Earlier this season, the
Cardinal took a 65-45 victory in Corvallis, and with a win
tonight, Stanford would make it 27 straight victories over
the Beavers. The Cardinal is led by junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike, who yesterday was named to the Capital One
Academic All-America Team.

point line.
Her willingness to do anything
and play any position has allowed
her to step up and lead the team
alongside Ogwumike with their de
sire to score, grab every loose ball
and pick up the defensive intensity.
"It takes a lot to play at this kind
of program at this kind of level,"
said Tinkle. "But aside from all the
hard work and sacrifice and pain,
when I look back on it [playing bas
ketball at Stanford], it brings the
biggest smile to my face because it
has been such an awesome experi
ence here."
Although Ruef, as a redshirt
junior, has one more year of eligibil
ity, she will be honored with Tinkle
on Senior Night since the pair
joined the team together. It is un
certain whether she will return for
a fifth year on the Farm, but the
Card will cross its fingers that it
gets another year of Ruef's dynam
ic play.
Last week against USC, Ruef
topped her career high in scoring
with 12 points and had her second
double-double of the season against
UCLA.
"Mikaela is stepping up big
time," VanDerveer said. "We need
her out there. We went through a
spurt where she came out of our
starting line up, but now she's back
in it and we need her out there
her defense, her passing, her scor
ing. She's had two double-doubles

in the last three games, her career
high, so she's playing awesome.
And she loves playing with Joslyn.
Those two are great friends."
Before Stanford can focus on
Oregon though, it must take down
Oregon State (9-17, 3-11) tonight.
Earlier this season, the Card had
no difficulty with either team, beat
ing the Beavers 65-45 and defeating
the Ducks 86-62.
"We want Jos and Mikaela to go
off on a great Senior Night and that
means, with Oregon, just limiting
their transition baskets because
they like to get out and score quick
ly," Ogwumike said. "Then with
Oregon State, being able to read
the defense, because they play
scout defense. Playing good, fast
basketball will put us in the best po
sition so we have a good Senior
Night."
The Card remains tied for first
place in the Pac-12 with rival No. 6
Cal. With wins over USC and
UCLA last weekend, Stanford se
cured a first-round bye at the Pac
-12 Tournament. Now, the Cardinal
will try to earn a high seed and the
right to host the first round of the
NCAA Tournament.
"Each game is going to be a
fight. It's going to be a battle," Tin
kle said. "So I'm going to do whatev
er it takes for me to be out there and
for our team to win."
The Card tips off against Oregon
State tonight at 8 p.m. and at 4 p.m.
on Sunday against Oregon for Sen
ior Night. Both games will be played
at Maples Pavilion.

As a player, it's hard to picture the moment when
you will walk down the court with your parents in
your last home game as a Cardinal athlete.
But Senior Night is inevitable, and Stanford
women's basketball forwards Joslyn Tinkle and
Mikaela Ruef will take part this Sunday night when
the No. 4 Card (24-2,13-1) faces Oregon (4-22,2-12).
"It's mind boggling to me. [The season] just goes

by so fast," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I
hope we have a good turnout
for both Jos and Mikaela
Ruef."
Tinkle has recorded 12.6
points per game and 6.2 re
bounds per game this season,
trailing only junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike. Ogwu
mike, recently named one of
the five on the 2012-13 Capital
One Academic All-America Di
vision I Women's Basketball
Team, leads the Card with 22.7
ppg and 12.3 rpg.
"[Tinkle] has had an awe
some year," said VanDerveer.
"She's been a great leader, a
high-energy player. She's al
ways enthusiastic— every
day I remind myself how much
I enjoy coaching her because
we're really going to miss
coaching her next year. She's a
fun person. Every time, you
can hear her laughing from the
front of the bus. And she's
making great threes, rebound
ing the heck out of it, playing
great defense. What else could
I ask for?"
Originally recruited as a
center, Tinkle developed into a
shooting guard her sophomore
year. The senior now bounces
between forward and small
forward and this season has
showed her electric versatility
not only under the basket, but
also from behind the three-
