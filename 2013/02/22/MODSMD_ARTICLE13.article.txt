## Card returns to face Cal after two-week break 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After disappointing losses against UCLA and
USC on the road, the No. 28 Stanford men's ten
nis team is looking to move back to .500 on the sea
son in Sunday's nonconference match at No. 12
Cal.
The clash between the Cardinal (34) and the
rival Golden Bears (44) is predicted to be one of
the closest of the season.
Though Cal has had a more successful season

thus far, Stanford has had more time to prepare
for the matchup. Cal spent the weekend at the Na
tional Tennis Indoor Championships in Seattle,
while Stanford did not qualify for the champi
onships and has enjoyed a two-week break from
match play.
"It's going to be a full week for Cal between
their matches this weekend and when we play
them on Sunday," said sophomore John Morrissey.
"The main advantage that we get from not playing
this weekend is that we had a large chunk of time
to really prepare and work on things and improve

our game."
Sophomore singles player Robert Stineman
agreed, saying that while it's been "mellow" hav
ing a break on back-to-back weekends, the team is
"ready to get back into competition."
"We've been working hard, training really
hard," Stineman said. "We've been focusing on
stuff that we felt needed to improve based on our
previous matches, especially the matches down in
LA"
