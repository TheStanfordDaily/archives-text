## Card returns to face Cal after two-week break 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After disappointing losses against UCLA and
USC on the road, the No. 28 Stanford men's ten
nis team is looking to move back to .500 on the sea
son in Sunday's nonconference match at No. 12
Cal.
The clash between the Cardinal (34) and the
rival Golden Bears (44) is predicted to be one of
the closest of the season.
Though Cal has had a more successful season

thus far, Stanford has had more time to prepare
for the matchup. Cal spent the weekend at the Na
tional Tennis Indoor Championships in Seattle,
while Stanford did not qualify for the champi
onships and has enjoyed a two-week break from
match play.
"It's going to be a full week for Cal between
their matches this weekend and when we play
them on Sunday," said sophomore John Morrissey.
"The main advantage that we get from not playing
this weekend is that we had a large chunk of time
to really prepare and work on things and improve

our game."
Sophomore singles player Robert Stineman
agreed, saying that while it's been "mellow" hav
ing a break on back-to-back weekends, the team is
"ready to get back into competition."
"We've been working hard, training really
hard," Stineman said. "We've been focusing on
stuff that we felt needed to improve based on our
previous matches, especially the matches down in
LA"
Morrissey and senior Matt Kan
dath will anchor the top of the Cardi
nal's lineup in both singles and dou
bles. As a duo, the pair is 7-5 overall
this season. In singles, Morrissey has
a 4-2 record at the No. 1 spot while
Kandath has won two of six matches
at the No. 2 position.
Freshman Nolan Paige earned
Stanford's only victory last weekend
on court four against USC. Paige has
alternated between the No. 3 and No.
4 positions this year and is likely to
meet either Campbell Johnson or
Gregory Bayane of Cal.
At the National Tennis Indoor
Championships, Cal was defeated 0-4
by No. 4 Ohio State on Feb. 15 but
clinched a victory over No. 11 Florida
in the first round of the consolations.
In the second round of consola
tions, Cal lost 4-3 to No. 8 Oklahoma
after Cal's Nikhil Jayashankar lost in
a three-set battle at sixth singles.
Last season, the Cardinal deci
sively defeated Cal at home 6-1 and
away 5-2, and Stanford's series
record against Cal is 88-16. However,
the Cardinal's 0-2 record in away
matches this season does not bode
well for a victory—the Golden Bears
are 3-0 in home matches during the
regular season.
While Stanford may have domi
nated Cal last year, Stineman said
that losing two seniors this year and
having a team with so many fresh
men and sophomores might pose a
challenge.
"We're a young team this year,

that's for sure," Stineman said. "We
are really looking to rely on the expe
rience we gained this fall and in the
beginning of this season."
The Cardinal's chances may de
pend on whether or not several of
Cal's best players are able to recover
from injuries. After the team's loss to
Ohio State on Feb. 15, Cal head coach
Peter Wright said that both Ben
Lachlan and Chase Melton were suf
fering from injuries, though both
played in the Feb. 16 match against
Florida and the Feb. 17 match

against Oklahoma.
"The No. 1 player, Ben Lachlan,
had a really good season last year
[with] some really big wins," Morris
sey said. "He is a dangerous player,
so in his day he can make it tough for
everybody."
Riki Lachlan, who usually plays
doubles with his brother Ben, was in
jured at a Feb. 8 match against USC
and hasn't played since. The Lach
lans are ranked as the No. 22 doubles
team in the nation.
Regardless of whether or not

Lachlan makes a recovery, Morrissey
is confident that the Cardinal has a
good chance of coming back from
Berkeley with a victory.
"I think it's going to be a very
close match. They always are," Mor
rissey said. "Last year we had a
tough one when we went over to Cal,
but we managed to pull through. I
think everyone is really looking for
ward to it."

in the first round of the consolations.
In the second round of consola
tions, Cal lost 4-3 to No. 8 Oklahoma
after Cal's Nikhil Jayashankar lost in
a three-set battle at sixth singles.
Last season, the Cardinal deci
sively defeated Cal at home 6-1 and
away 5-2, and Stanford's series
record against Cal is 88-16. However,
the Cardinal's 0-2 record in away
matches this season does not bode
well for a victory—the Golden Bears
are 3-0 in home matches during the
regular season.
While Stanford may have domi
nated Cal last year, Stineman said
that losing two seniors this year and
having a team with so many fresh
men and sophomores might pose a
challenge.
"We're a young team this year,

that's for sure," Stineman said. "We
are really looking to rely on the expe
rience we gained this fall and in the
beginning of this season."
The Cardinal's chances may de
pend on whether or not several of
Cal's best players are able to recover
from injuries. After the team's loss to
Ohio State on Feb. 15, Cal head coach
Peter Wright said that both Ben
Lachlan and Chase Melton were suf
fering from injuries, though both
played in the Feb. 16 match against
Florida and the Feb. 17 match

against Oklahoma.
"The No. 1 player, Ben Lachlan,
had a really good season last year
[with] some really big wins," Morris
sey said. "He is a dangerous player,
so in his day he can make it tough for
everybody."
Riki Lachlan, who usually plays
doubles with his brother Ben, was in
jured at a Feb. 8 match against USC
and hasn't played since. The Lach
lans are ranked as the No. 22 doubles
team in the nation.
Regardless of whether or not

Lachlan makes a recovery, Morrissey
is confident that the Cardinal has a
good chance of coming back from
Berkeley with a victory.
"I think it's going to be a very
close match. They always are," Mor
rissey said. "Last year we had a
tough one when we went over to Cal,
but we managed to pull through. I
think everyone is really looking for
ward to it."

Sophomore Robert Stineman (above) and the Stanford men's tennis team will try to even their record when
they face Cal this weekend. The Cardinal is returning to action after a two-week break from match play that
allowed the squad to prepare for the Golden Bears. Stanford has yet to earn a victory on the road this year.
