# Road continues for Card
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball contin
ues its four-game road trip this
weekend by heading first to Utah to
face No. 2 BYU (9-3) before return
ing to California to take on No. 13
Cal Baptist (6-7).
The Cardinal (9-5,6-5 MPSF) has
straggled to find consistency away
from home this season the team's
away record is now 2-4 after split
ting two road games last weekend.
Stanford was able to hold off Cal
State-Northridge to earn a 3-1 victo
ry but fell short against No. 4 Long
Beach State in straight sets.
In both matches, the offense was
the deciding factor. The Cardinal of
fense dominated Northridge, hitting
a season-high .456, including .788 in
second set. Junior Brian Cook led
the Cardinal with 21 kills on the day.
In the match against Long Beach,
however, Stanford hit a season-low
.152 and straggled against a power
ful and aggressive 49ers offense.
"[Long Beach State] took us out
of our system, and that's when we
struggled," Stanford head coach
John Kosty told GoStanford.com.
"When we pass well, we're good.
When we don't, we get fairly one-di

mensional. We need to be more con
sistent."
In the Cardinal's game against
Northridge, freshman setter James
Shaw made a team-high 52 assists,
which provided the offense with the
groundwork to have a strong hitting
night.
The Cardinal will need that kind
of performance against a BYU
squad that is one of the top blocking
teams in the nation. The Cougars,
led by senior middle blocker Russ
Lavaja, have held opponents to a
.237 hitting average, while hitting
.325 themselves. The Stanford de
fense must also find away to contain
BYU junior hitter Taylor Sander,
who had 23 kills against Pepperdine
last week.
BYU is currently ranked first in
the MPSF and will benefit from
their home environment in Provo,
Utah, where the Cougars are 8-2 this
year. However, BYU is coming off a
similar weekend to the Cardinal, as
the Cougars first lost a five-set
match to No. 5 Pepperdine before
rebounding to beat No. 10 USC 3-1.
Stanford has not lost to BYU in
the last six meetings between the
teams, including four in which the
Card was the underdog coming into
the match. In the last matchup, the

Cardinal knocked the Cougars out of
the 2012 MPSF semifinals.
After the match with the
Cougars, Stanford will meet No. 13
Cal Baptist on Monday, Feb. 25. In
their first season in the MPSF, the
Lancers are 6-7 on the year. Cal
Baptist has also lost three of its past
four matches, including four-set de
feats to USC and Pepperdine last
weekend. Last season, Stanford lost
to the Lancers in five sets in the Car
dinal's first match after the spring
break layoff.
Cal Baptist is led by senior out
side hitter Levi Cabral, who is aver
aging 4.46 kills per set. Setter Brett
Anderson has also recently emerged
for the Lancers —the sophomore
posted 43 assists against USC.
This weekend represents the
midpoint of the MPSF season. With
13 matches to go, the Cardinal is cur
rently ranked fifth in the conference,
and two wins this weekend could cer
tainly provide them with the oppor
tunity to move up in the standings.
"It's a long process," Kosty said.
"At the same time, we're at a stage
where we're still learning to put
matches together."
