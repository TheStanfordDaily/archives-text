# AWARDS SEASON
## THE 						OSCARS The 						granddaddy of them all is this Sunday. Here's what to expect from the 85TH ACADEMY AWARDS. The 						Oscars take the Bechdel Test 
### Katharine Schwab STAFF WRITER 
It's Oscar time. Time for the best- and
worst-dressed lists, the endless media
coverage, the analysis, the predictions
and the recognition of great storytellers
and their cohorts. As viewers tune in to see
whom the Academy votes in as Best
Director, Best Actor and Actress and Best
Picture in the largest Hollywood publicity
stunt of the year (because, let's be honest,
we all just want to see who's wearing what),
we forget that what we are really seeing is
one of the last and greatest Old Boys' Clubs
in the country awarding themselves for
their own artistic genius. And the vast
majority of them are white and male.

According to a survey by the Los
Angeles Times, the academy is 94 percent
white and 77 percent male. The division of
labor in the film industry itself is 82 percent
male and 18 percent female. In 2011,
women directed only 5 percent of the top
grossing movies.
As shocking as it is that Steven
Spielberg was nominated again for his his
torical flick "Lincoln," it is even more shock
ing that not one woman is up for an Oscar
for Best Director this year. Even Kathryn
Bigelow, who was the first woman to win
Best Director with "The Hurt Locker" and
whose "Zero Dark Thirty" has received criti
cal acclaim, was passed over in favor of the
usual suspects.

While there is clear gender
inequality behind the scenes, it might
appear as if women are equally repre
sented on screen. Among the Best

Picture nominees, it is useful to put
them to the test. The Bechdel Test,
that is. Begun inadvertently by

comic book writer Alison
Bechdel in a 1985 comic
strip called "The Rule," the
Bechdel test provides a
means to judge female repre-

sentation on screen. The rules are
simple.

1. There are two female characters (who
have names)
2. Who talk to each other

3. About something other than men.
Straightforward, but harrowing when
you begin to test films considered among
the best ever made, such as "The
Godfather," "Fight Club" and "Pulp
Fiction." Even so, passing the Bechdel test
does not make a film feminist or even posi
tive toward women. Still, it's a place to
start.
Among this year's Best Picture nomi
nees, only "Life of Pi" outright fails the
Bechdel Test. After all, the only two charac
ters are a boy and a tiger. Of the nine films,
six pass all three criteria (though some

remain up for debate, such as
"Amour"). "Silver Linings Playbook"
passes two, and "Django Unchained"
dubiously passes only the first.
However, it's not hard to assert that
every film should pass the Bechdel
test. In the database of 3,717 movies
(and growing) on bechdeltest.com,
only a little over half of the films ful

fill all three criteria.
Hollywood filmmakers aren't
bringing the complex experiences of
half of the population to the silver
screen, leaving out a wide range of
stories that should be told. Maybe
it's because most writers, directors
and producers are male. Maybe it's
because the industry likes to green

light movies that will appeal to the
"average person," which, in our soci
ety, is a young, white, straight, afflu
ent man who likes to watch things
blow up and scantily clad girls.
Either way, there is a "shocking
underrepresentation of women in
our business," as the ever-eloquent
Meryl Streep puts it. This Sunday

night, as we ogle the beautiful dress
es and despair over the contrived
opening sequence, we should
remember to think twice about the
gender inequalities that the Academy
Awards reinforce and remember
that, as consumers, we can make an
impact on the types of movies that
are made.
