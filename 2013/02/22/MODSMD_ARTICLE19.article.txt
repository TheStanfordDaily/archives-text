# TREE SEX SEX ON WHEELS
## 
### 
As I gazed across the dusty
trodden path at my horse
competition, I saw this gor
geous guy. Fit, pearly white teeth, just
enough scruff and a great outfit. He
also happened to be in a wheelchair. I
thought to myself, "Oh, he must have
broken a leg falling off a horse or
from dirt biking," as if a guy who
looked like that could only have a
temporary disability. I struck up a
conversation and later found out that
he was actually paralyzed from the
waist down due to a spinal chord
injury. I immediately felt uncomfort
able hitting on him, as all sorts of
hypothetical questions started racing
through my mind: What would it be
like if we ever hooked up? Could he
even get an erection?
I wish, in that moment, I had
been more open-minded and less
ignorant and afraid to consider the
possibility of sex or a relationship
with a man who had a disability. This
week, I had the privilege to interview
one Stanford woman, who has been
in a wheelchair since she was 10,
about sex and sexuality of people with
disabilities. Though of course she can
not speak for all people with disabili
ties, it is important to consider and
understand that just because a disabil
ity affects a person physically, it does
not mean that the individual must say
goodbye to a healthy love and sex life.
Diagnosed with genetic spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA), a neural

muscular degenerative disorder that
affects all of the muscles in the body,
our student still enjoys, like many col
lege students, talking about sex and
engaging in romantic and sexual
activities and dating.
INT: Does your disability affect the
way you feel pleasure?
STUDENT : Physically, everything is
exactly how someone without SMA
would feel. Not all people in wheel
chairs are paralyzed. And people in
wheelchairs [and even paralyzed peo
ple] can have sex. [Though I] have
not had sex, I have had orgasms. I am
actually overly sensitive because my
body is just overall more sensitive
in general, pain hurts more, and
pleasure feels better too.
INT : Can you describe the first time
you hooked up with someone?
STUDENT : We talked more about
what we liked rather than what he
thought I could do. He didn't ask,
"Are you able to give me a blow job?"
but seemed to like it when I did. He
didn't seem shocked or surprised, and
that made me feel comfortable.
INT : Are you ever afraid for your
physical safety or well-being during a
hookup?
STUDENT : I am more worried
about power dynamics in relation
ships. One casual Friday night
hookup, somebody definitely took

advantage of my weakness. It didn't
escalate, thank god, but up to that
point [during this hookup], I felt
physically used. That's what I fear as
far as trusting the other person. I
don't think I can get [physically hurt].
I have done some crazy things, and it
hasn't hurt me yet!
INT : How do you deal with issues of
trust and power dynamics?
STUDENT : I don't trust people
unless I have a previous relationship
with them. I think that's natural for
people with disabilities. For me, it is
[about] not being able to defend
myself I am cautious with the type
of people I decide to be with. I didn't
think it was a big deal until I had a
bad experience [where the guy] pulled
me out of my wheelchair when I did
n't want him to. That was a terrifying
experience I felt bad because I
thought I had put myself in that situ
ation.
INT: Are there certain positions or
acts that are better or most comfort
able for you?
STUDENT : It is always really com
fortable when somebody sits down or
if we are both lying down. Getting at
the same height level is always a chal
lenge, but somebody who is strong
enough to lift me or move me is defi
nitely a turn on! Usually, I am on bot
tom I am used to that, and I like
that. But [one time], there was some

one who was really strong and flipped
me on top of him and secured me in
away where I felt like I was in control
and I liked that. He knew my abilities
and was sensitive, but not afraid to
hurt me. He wasn't afraid that I would
be shocked or upset. It was just a nat
ural thing for us to do in that
moment.
INT : Have you ever used any sexual
aids such as a swing or wedge?
STUDENT : I never have, but I have
definitely used my chair in different
ways. One thing that has been fun for
me is giving and receiving oral sex in
my chair it is easy to get at my
height. My chair even tilts back so I
can experience different angles.
INT : Has it been difficult to find
partners who feel comfortable being
intimate with a person with a disabili
ty?
STUDENT : It is definitely difficult. I
have had a harder time at Stanford
than I did in the past. I feel like a lot
of people here have high standards
without considering other options. I
had assumed if I came to a place
where people were more educated,
they would be less likely to stereotype
my sexuality. The best partners I have
had have been people with experi
ences [i.e. disabled family members]
people who are not afraid to
understand disability. I don't want to
be treated like a fragile doll I want

to be treated like a woman. There is a
fine balance between force and fun,
but I do not want to be treated like a
gentle baby.
INT : How do you overcome any
self-consciousness?
STUDENT : I'd say I'm pretty confi
dent in general, but I am extremely
self conscious about how people per
ceive my sexuality. Bars and parties
are difficult and frustrating to meet
people because I often dislike their
questions like, "What happened?" But
that doesn't mean I don't like going
out or that I don't like dressing up. I
still wear heels and don't care what
people think about it. I don't like the
assumption that you have to be
frumpy and wear sweatpants if you
are in a wheelchair.
INT: Do you have any advice for
someone who is looking to date a per
son with disabilities or has a disability
and is looking to explore his or her
sexuality?
STUDENT : It's important to learn
what that person is like regardless of
that disability. The way I describe dis
ability: Everybody has their issues; it's
just that I sit on mine so everyone
knows them and can see them [right
off the bat]. It is difficult to discover
your sexualityâ€” I haven't been fully
happy with my own experiences. I am
a huge fan of self-exploration and was raised in
an environment that was okay with it. I like
thinking about it myself before I involve another
person.
Everyone must face their own barriers on
the road to discovering their sexuality. Whether
a person is questioning their sexual orientation,
struggling with body image issues or just trying
to figure out what turns them on, it is never an

easy or homogenous path to self-discovery.
Although people with physical disabilities may
have more apparent barriers to overcome when
it comes to intimacy, there are plenty of veiled,
inner obstacles that all people struggle with. The
student I interviewed demonstrated that she is a
sexual college student who happens to be in a
wheelchair, not that she is a disabled woman
who is surprisingly sexual.
