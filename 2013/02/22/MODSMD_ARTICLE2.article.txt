## Frosh bond over social networks 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
Although Stanford doesn't disclose
roommate assignments until freshmen ar
rive for New Student Orientation, many
incoming students get started early on
meeting their new classmates and neigh
bors online.
Jonathan Fisk 'l6 friended over 1,000
members of the Official Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook page in anticipation of the
new school year. He considered the plat
form a community-building tool.
"When I got here I had so many close
friends already ... [The Facebook group]
was a great way to get to know the school
on a more personal level as well as the
people we would be with for the next four
years," Fisk said.
According to Freshman Transition Co
ordinator Meyli Chapin 'l4, who ran the
Approaching Stanford Facebook page and
Class of 2016 group, administrators rarely
intervened in the student dialogue, pre
ferring instead to let each class' culture
develop.
In choosing between Stanford and
Harvard, Fisk attributed this unrestrict
ed discussion on the group wall as a defin
ing factor.
"Obviously both schools are really
smart, but Stanford's the one having fun
... A lot of people can be academically se
rious and then two minutes later be as
goofy as possible," Fisk said.
Facebook was not the only social media
platform bringing freshmen together pri
or to their arrival on campus, with some
freshmen taking advantage of chat-rooms
and Google Hangouts for correspondence.
According to Director of Admission
Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO, the Stanford Ad
missions Twitter feed received over 100
hits per hour "at high points in the admis
sions season."
The Confessions from Stanford blog
also allowed members of the incoming
freshmen class to share their stories of
transitioning to Stanford. According to a
Daily article published earlier this year,
the blog received over 40,000 hits in 103
countries between the end of June and
September.
Eric Wilson 'l6, who
wrote for the blog, acknowl
edged the blog's characteri
zation of the freshman class
as overly bold and presump
tuous but maintained that it
served as an outlet for bond
ing and shared excitement.
"The original purpose of
the blog was to serve as a
transition from high school
to the beginning of Stan
ford," Wilson said. "I'd say
that people forgot that...
but it was a nice way of leav
ing a memento as a class."
Lim framed community
building as the largest ad
vantage of using social me
dia in the acceptance process
but emphasized the value of
dialogue between students
and administrators.
According to Lim, social
media provided the Class of
2016 with unprecedented ac
cess to Stanford representa
tives and Freshman Transi
tion Coordinators that earli
er incoming classes did not
have. Freshmen could post
directly to the Approaching
Stanford Facebook page
questions ranging from
ideal shower caddies to
Thinking Matters courses
and expect a timely re
sponse.
According to Chapin,
Stanford will emphasize in
the future the fact that fel
low students run the Face
book wall to reduce appre
hension about asking ques
tions.
Chapin also noted that
activity on the freshman
group's wall was higher than
anticipated. Especially to
wards the end of the summer,
administrators struggled to
respond to the vast number
of posts requiring a response,
prompting the Office of Un
dergraduate Admission to
hire a permanent director of
marketing and communica
tions and collaborate with
outside consultants to im
prove their responsiveness.
"A good conversation we
want to have with focus
groups is about the pros and
cons [of social media]," Lim

said.
Although social media
has provided Stanford with
plenty of advantages in the
admissions process, high
levels of social media activity
affects students in a variety
of ways. Prospective fresh
man Miles Kool said the
Class of 2017 Facebook
group could unfairly define
the entire class by the ac
tions of a few students.
"The group is good for a
very limited amount of peo
ple who are really outgoing
or want to talk about their
accomplishments," Kool
said. "While it's a good way
to communicate and stay up
to date with fellow admits, it
can be intimidating to many
of us. You are constantly
comparing yourself to oth
ers."
Fisk, Wilson and
Matthew Arkin 'l6, who
were all active on the 2016
Facebook group, agreed that
they had made better
friends in person on campus
than online. Kool described
friend requests from fellow
admits as somewhat prema
ture.
"I'm going to wait until I
meet people in person to de
cide if we will form any last
ing bonds," Kool said.
In addition to creating
misconceptions about one's
future classmates and creat
ing the potential to interact
with false friends online, so
cial media also can amplify
anxieties among incoming
freshmen exposed to an in
creased level of transparen
cy.
"We had a worry that
there was too much activity
... Students got worked up
over so many questions, and
it all added to the stress,"
Chapin said. "These things
will work themselves out."
After the academic year
began, Stanford turned over
the Class of 2016 Facebook
group's administration to
students in the hope that it
would continue to bring the
class together.
"We don't monitor it any
more it is all yours," Lim
said. "The Facebook page
stays with the class forever."
