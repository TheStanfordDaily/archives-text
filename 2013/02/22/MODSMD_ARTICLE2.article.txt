## Frosh bond over social networks 
### MARGARET WENZLAU 
Although Stanford doesn't disclose
roommate assignments until freshmen ar
rive for New Student Orientation, many
incoming students get started early on
meeting their new classmates and neigh
bors online.
Jonathan Fisk 'l6 friended over 1,000
members of the Official Stanford Class of
2016 Facebook page in anticipation of the
new school year. He considered the plat
form a community-building tool.
"When I got here I had so many close
friends already ... [The Facebook group]
was a great way to get to know the school
on a more personal level as well as the
people we would be with for the next four
years," Fisk said.
According to Freshman Transition Co
ordinator Meyli Chapin 'l4, who ran the
Approaching Stanford Facebook page and
Class of 2016 group, administrators rarely
intervened in the student dialogue, pre
ferring instead to let each class' culture
develop.
In choosing between Stanford and
Harvard, Fisk attributed this unrestrict
ed discussion on the group wall as a defin
ing factor.
"Obviously both schools are really
smart, but Stanford's the one having fun
... A lot of people can be academically se
rious and then two minutes later be as
goofy as possible," Fisk said.
Facebook was not the only social media
platform bringing freshmen together pri
or to their arrival on campus, with some
freshmen taking advantage of chat-rooms
and Google Hangouts for correspondence.
According to Director of Admission
Colleen Lim M.A. 'BO, the Stanford Ad
missions Twitter feed received over 100
hits per hour "at high points in the admis
sions season."
The Confessions from Stanford blog
also allowed members of the incoming
freshmen class to share their stories of
transitioning to Stanford. According to a
Daily article published earlier this year,
the blog received over 40,000 hits in 103
countries between the end of June and
September.
