# THE
						OSCARS
## UNSEEN OSCARS BEST ORIGINAL SONG 
### 
Have you ever wished your life had
a soundtrack? The right song, at
the right time, can make a large
impact on the emotion of any interaction
and the mood of any scene. Five Original
Songs were nominated for Oscars this year
as recognition for their ability to make us
feel something new and memorable.
"Skyfall" from "Skyfall"; Music and Lyric
by Adele Adkins and Paul Epworth
According to Huffington Post, this
"brassy and soulful" melody fits the bold
and dramatic storyline of the latest Bond
movie, "Skyfall." Sung by famously talent
ed songstress Adele, the song will be per
formed at this year's Academy Awards as a
tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Bond
franchise. As we all know well, Adele's
voice pulls on heartstrings harder than a
picture of a Pomeranian cuddling with lit
tle brown bunny. This song is even more
intense, deep and memorable than the
opening scene that proceeds it, so it makes
sense that "Skyfall" would be the first
Bond theme song to receive as Oscar nom
ination since 1982. Expect that this fron
trunner nominee will be taking home the
award (rightfully so, too).
"Suddenly" from "Les Miserables";
Music by Claude-Michel Schonberg, Lyric
by Herbert Kretzmer and Alain Boublil
The most talked about musical, and
predictably, soundtrack, from 2012 has a
new song in it these days. "Suddenly," sung
by Hugh Jackman, adds a new happy and

hopeful tune to a soundtrack of depressing
ballads. While Hugh Jackman was largely
criticized for his let's say less than
angelic voice, the new musical number
really caters to his strengths, as his huski
ness adds a layer of genuine emotion to
the song. "Suddenly" was likely nominated
for its originality and heartfelt lyrics that
add significantly to the loving feeling of a
scene that captures the budding father
daughter relationship. But, in all honesty,
outside of the context of the movie, the
song is nothing more than delightful
pleasant and regrettably unmemorable.
"Pi's Lullaby" from "Life of Pi"; Music
by Mychael Danna, Lyric by Bombay
Jayashri
Lullaby indeed. This song, sung in
Tamil, has beautiful instrumentals paired
with the harmony of an ancient poetic
language. It's intentionally peaceful and
beautiful and has the grandeur of history
that's clearly supposed to highlight and
accompany the intense visuals of "Life of
Pi." And while beautiful, and a true con
tender for the award, there is nothing in
particular that makes this song noteworthy
or stand out enough to take home the
Academy Award.
"Everybody Needs A Best Friend"
from "Ted"; Music by Walter Murphy,
Lyric by Seth MacFarlane
"Everybody needs a best friend/I'm
happy I'm yours!" This jazzy tune from the
"TED" movie soundtrack is so catchy, the

lyrics stick for days. But what do you
expect from the creator of "Family Guy,"
whose theme song is one of the catchiest
on TV? Seth McFarlane, Walter Murphy
and vocalist Norah Jones go throwback
with a melody reminiscent of the Swing
Era and Frank Sinatra. The words, while in
theory should be particularly cheesy
refrains about childhood friendship, are
witty and adorable. This song is even a hit
when it's listened to outside of the jovial
montage of Ted and John Bennett (played
by Mark Wahlberg) growing up together.
It's a shame this song has to go up against
the likes of "Skyfall" because it sure is a
winner in my book.
"Before My Time" from ""Chasing Ice";
Music and Lyric by J. Ralph
Okay, let's be honest. This song really
never stood a chance. I mean, the movie is
about glaciers. It's actually just a time-lapse
of glaciers. It's an important issue, sure
global warming and all of that. And the
song's nice too: tranquil, calming. Plus,
Scarlett Johansson has an interesting, bor
derline-husky voice that almost makes you
want to melt. Unfortunately, while it has
found its rightful place on my study
playlist, I don't think it'll make it to the list
of songs to take home the Oscar.
As a whole, while each song has its
musical merits, we will have to wait and
see who the Academy decides truly brings
a new sound that defines the cinematic
spirit of 2012.
