# Energy Secretary Chu to return to Stanford
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu will
return to Stanford this spring as a faculty
member following the conclusion of his single
term in office. Chu's appointment will mark
his second stint at the University, where he
had previously worked as a professor of
physics and applied physics from 1987 to
2008.
Upon his return, Chu will be the William
R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Humanities and
Sciences, holding a joint appointment in the
Department of Physics and the School of
Medicine's Department of Molecular and
Cellular Physiology. The exact date of his de

parture from the Department of Energy is
currently unknown and likely dependent on
the process of nominating his successor.
"We're very excited," said Steven Kahn,
chair of the Physics Department. "It's fan
tastic that he's back... Many of us know
Steve from when he was here before, [and]
we strongly value him as a colleague."
Chu framed his decision to return to Stan
ford as a natural move for someone who
viewed his time in office mostly as a break
from academia.
"The highest point in my career was when
I became a professor in [such] a great institu
tion," Chu said.

Steven Chu, who taught at Stanford as a physics professor from 1987 to 2008, served
a turbulent four years as President Barack Obama's Secretary of Energy.
At Stanford, Chu will fo
cus on issues surrounding
energy efficiency and policy,
in addition to launching an
initiative in advanced bio-im
aging and pursuing other in
terdisciplinary projects.
"I want to return to ...
the marriage of physics, biol
ogy and biomedicine," Chu
said. "That is a very exciting
frontier."
Despite Chu's evident
comfort with academia, he
cited his time as Secretary of
Energy as invaluable in
broadening his approach to
the issues he'll address upon
his return and providing
perspective on academia's
role in driving progress.
"[As Secretary of Ener
gy], you get a much more
complete view of issues that
go so much deeper," Chu
said. "You see a lot of the

things that it takes to go
from discovery to invention
to ... getting it out into the
marketplace."
"Using technology to
drive down the cost of clean
er forms of energy is only
part of it," Chu added.
"There are a lot of things
having to do with education
and public awareness...
[Some think that] if you
build a better mousetrap,
they will come. You have to
build a better mousetrap,
and people have to be aware
that it's a better mousetrap."
As part of that emphasis
on education, Chu said that
he looks forward to teaching
and interacting with under
graduate as well as graduate
students.
"[Teaching] a frosh semi
nar was one of the most en
joyable experiences I've
had," he noted.
Born in St. Louis in 1948,
Chu studied as an under
graduate at the University of
Rochester before obtaining a
Ph.D. in 1976 from the Uni

versity of California, Berke
ley.
After a stint in the pri
vate sector at AT&T and
Bell Laboratories, where he
performed the work devel
oping methods to cool and
trap atoms with laser light
that ultimately earned him
the 1997 Nobel Prize in
Physics, he joined Stanford
in 1987. He worked as a pro
fessor of physics and ap
plied physics for 21 years,
including stints as chair of
the physics department
from 1990-1993 and 1999-
2001, before he was nomi
nated by President Barack
Obama as Secretary of En
ergy and subsequently con
firmed.
After a four-year tenure
marked by historic expan
sions in spending on green
energy, Chu wrote in a let
ter to Energy Department
employees that many major
energy challenges from a
reliance on imported oil to
lagging investment in green
energy and a lack of action

on climate change still lie
ahead. He emphasized, how
ever, his intent to further
his accomplishments as Sec
retary of Energy even after
leaving office.
"I would like to return to
an academic life of teaching
and research, but will still
work to advance the mis
sions that we have been
working on together for the
last four years," Chu wrote.
Even as he approaches a
return to academia after his
time in office, however, Chu
acknowledged that choosing
between Stanford and
Berkeley where he com
pleted his postdoctoral
studies was a difficult de
cision. Ultimately, however,
the presence of four of Chu's
grandchildren in Palo Alto
proved to be a critical factor.
"They're both great uni
versities, but I'm very happy
to be coming back to Stan
ford," Chu concluded.
