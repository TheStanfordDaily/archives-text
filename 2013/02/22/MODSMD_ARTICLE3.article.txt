# Energy Secretary Chu to return to Stanford
## 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu will
return to Stanford this spring as a faculty
member following the conclusion of his single
term in office. Chu's appointment will mark
his second stint at the University, where he
had previously worked as a professor of
physics and applied physics from 1987 to
2008.
Upon his return, Chu will be the William
R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Humanities and
Sciences, holding a joint appointment in the
Department of Physics and the School of
Medicine's Department of Molecular and
Cellular Physiology. The exact date of his de

parture from the Department of Energy is
currently unknown and likely dependent on
the process of nominating his successor.
"We're very excited," said Steven Kahn,
chair of the Physics Department. "It's fan
tastic that he's back... Many of us know
Steve from when he was here before, [and]
we strongly value him as a colleague."
Chu framed his decision to return to Stan
ford as a natural move for someone who
viewed his time in office mostly as a break
from academia.
"The highest point in my career was when
I became a professor in [such] a great institu
tion," Chu said.
