## Viennese Ball headlines two weeks of dance 
### BRITTANY TORREZ 
The annual Viennese Ball is part of a long
tradition of social dance at Stanford. First cre
ated by students returning from the now-de
funct Stanford in Austria program in 1978 who
sought to recreate Vienna's social dance cul
ture, the event has today nearly doubled in size
from the 350 tickets sold for the first event.
According to Viennese Ball Steering Com
mittee co-chair Jen Ying Zhen Ang 'l3, Ball at

tendees can expect food and music this
evening when the event is hosted at The Palace
Hotel for the first time.
"It's a registered historical landmark," said
Christina Krawec 'l5, chair of the committee
that oversees the night of the event. "It's very
swanky, very fancy and very high class."
Leading up to Viennese Ball, dance lessons
and workshops have been held as part of the
Austria Fortnight. At Bon-Bon Ball, the kick
off festivity held two weekends ago, organizers

sold 221 tickets. According to Steering Com
mittee chair Nick Enge 'O9, they expect more
than 600 people to attend.
For attendees who are not masters of the
cross-step waltz or swing, lessons were held
every night leading up to the event in the
Black Community Services Center. Austria
Fortnight the two weeks leading up to the
Ball —is filled with lessons in waltz, swing,
salsa and tango.
"It involves almost two
whole weeks of free lessons,"
said Mario Cuevas 'l3, Aus
tria Fortnight's co-chair.
In an effort to make all
dancers comfortable come
Ball night, some dancers
wear a gold ribbon and dance
with whoever approaches
them.
"If you have a gold ribbon
on it means that you're willing
to dance with anybody,"
Krawec said. "This informali
ty allows for the event to feel
more open and allows
dancers to get to know each
other. I just hope people en
joy themselves."
Richard Powers, a dance
lecturer at Stanford who has
advised Austria Fortnight for
20 years, said that the atmos
phere of social dance at the
Viennese Ball changed
markedly after he starting
teaching.
"[Before,] most people
would stand in place and do
prom dancing," Powers said.
"Then after I arrived, sud
denly everybody knew how to
waltz and travel around the
room."
Formal instruction through
classes taught on campus by
Powers and many others, as
well as the student-taught
classes during Austria Fort
night, have assisted in trans
forming the Viennese Ball in
to an exhibition of a wide vari
ety of social dances as social
dance becomes increasingly
popular on campus.
Stanford dance groups
such as the Salseros, Stanford

Ballroom Dance team and
Cardinal Ballet will perform,
and the organizers have
planned dance contests in Vi
ennese waltz, swing, salsa and
cross-step waltz for Ball at
tendees.
While the Viennese Ball
has decades of history, its
committees have continued to
tweak its execution. Krawec
said this year marks a new
emphasis on "greening" the

event.
Some of the initiatives
that organizers have imple
mented include providing
free shuttles to and from the
event, selling locally grown
flowers for corsages and bou
tonnieres, using only renew
able wares and providing
composting at the event.
