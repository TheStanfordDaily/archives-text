## IR, HumBio see reverse gender gap Programs struggle to explain skew toward females in their majors 
### SHELLEY XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the gender gap in computer science
majors both nationally and at Stanford has
been widely publicized, similar issues contin
ue to affect Stanford's human biology
(Humßio) and international relations (IR)
programs. For those two departments, how
ever, it's all about the women.
Seventy-nine percent of declared Humßio
majors are female, while women constitute
66 percent of declared IR majors.
"I hadn't heard much about the gender
gap, but when I got there I was pretty
shocked that there were girls everywhere,"
said Andre Decker 'l3, a Humßio major.
While the shortage of women in typically
male-dominated majors has been the subject
of extensive research, significantly less atten
tion has been paid to cases where the reverse
gender gap is true.
Shelley Correll M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol, direc
tor of the Stanford Clayman Institute for
Gender Research, posited a few different hy
potheses, including the tendency of a gender
imbalance to become self-perpetuating over
time.
"When groups are already underrepre
sented, then new members are less likely to
go into the major," Correll said.
Correll added that research has demon
strated a difference in preferences between
men and women that might ultimately lead to
different choices of major.
"We do find that women place a slightly
higher value on jobs that they see as helping
other people," she said.
Nora Jendoubi 'l4, an IR major, said she
chose the program because she developed a
passion for international policies after grow
ing up in a multicultural environment.
Meanwhile Rachel Seeman 'l4, a Humßio
major, was drawn to the interdisciplinary na
ture of the program and the lack of a math re
quirement.
Michael Tomz, director of the IR pro
gram, hesitated to attribute the overall gen
der imbalance to any specific factor.
"These are deep and profound questions,
why certain genders are attracted to certain
majors and not as much to others," Tomz
said.
Paul Fisher 'B4, director of the Humßio
department, also expressed puzzlement over
the gender disparity.
"We typically attract students who have
broad interests, typically incorporating natu
ral and social sciences," Fisher said. "For
some reason, females seem to be more drawn
to it than males."
While neither Fisher nor Tomz could pin
point the cause for the underrepresentation
of male students in then- programs, Correll
said the gender gap could be problematic in a
variety of ways.
"For any important social problem, it's in
