## IR, HumBio see reverse gender gap Programs struggle to explain skew toward females in their majors 
### SHELLEY XU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the gender gap in computer science
majors both nationally and at Stanford has
been widely publicized, similar issues contin
ue to affect Stanford's human biology
(Humßio) and international relations (IR)
programs. For those two departments, how
ever, it's all about the women.
Seventy-nine percent of declared Humßio
majors are female, while women constitute
66 percent of declared IR majors.
"I hadn't heard much about the gender
gap, but when I got there I was pretty
shocked that there were girls everywhere,"
said Andre Decker 'l3, a Humßio major.
While the shortage of women in typically
male-dominated majors has been the subject
of extensive research, significantly less atten
tion has been paid to cases where the reverse
gender gap is true.
Shelley Correll M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol, direc
tor of the Stanford Clayman Institute for
Gender Research, posited a few different hy
potheses, including the tendency of a gender
imbalance to become self-perpetuating over
time.
"When groups are already underrepre
sented, then new members are less likely to
go into the major," Correll said.
Correll added that research has demon
strated a difference in preferences between
men and women that might ultimately lead to
different choices of major.
"We do find that women place a slightly
higher value on jobs that they see as helping
other people," she said.
Nora Jendoubi 'l4, an IR major, said she
chose the program because she developed a
passion for international policies after grow
ing up in a multicultural environment.
Meanwhile Rachel Seeman 'l4, a Humßio
major, was drawn to the interdisciplinary na
ture of the program and the lack of a math re
quirement.
Michael Tomz, director of the IR pro
gram, hesitated to attribute the overall gen
der imbalance to any specific factor.
"These are deep and profound questions,
why certain genders are attracted to certain
majors and not as much to others," Tomz
said.
Paul Fisher 'B4, director of the Humßio
department, also expressed puzzlement over
the gender disparity.
"We typically attract students who have
broad interests, typically incorporating natu
ral and social sciences," Fisher said. "For
some reason, females seem to be more drawn
to it than males."
While neither Fisher nor Tomz could pin
point the cause for the underrepresentation
of male students in then- programs, Correll
said the gender gap could be problematic in a
variety of ways.
"For any important social problem, it's in
the interest of the society to
be really drawing from the
full range of talent within our
society," Correll said. "Hav
ing more men, we'd bring in a
different perspective than in
the absence of men."
David Hoyt 'l3, an IR ma
jor, said that while the gender
gap has never adversely af
fected his classes in the In
ternational Security track
a track that is either male
dominated or reaches gender
parity he recognizes the

gender disparity's social im
pact.
"I think that it's impor
tant to have both genders
weigh in on the discussion,"
Hoyt said.
Aside from inclusivity
concerns, Correll added that
reaching gender parity
among both female-dominat
ed and male-dominated ma
jors would resolve ongoing
social issues related to
stereotyping.
"To the extent that things
are more equalized across
gender lines, you reduce
some of the kinds of stereo
type threats that come about
when people are underrepre
sented," Correll said.

For Fisher, the main con
cern is not necessarily gen
der parity.
"I think the biggest con
cern for me as director is to
have the biggest diversity of
students," Fisher said. "We
attract people from all over
campus athletes, non-ath
letes ... I think the overrid
ing concern is that we really
reach out to the whole cam
pus."
Some female students,
like Humßio major Alison
Kadavy 'l5, said that the gen
der disparity has no effect,
while others welcomed it.
"It's easier to be in an en
vironment with all girls. I
find myself participating

more," said Raquel Ryan 'l5,
a Humßio major.
Correll said that one of
the few efforts to correct the
Humßio and IR gender gap
is organized by the Haas
Center for Public Service,
which has tried to bring in
more male students to bal
ance out the high number of
females.
He attributed the lack of
interest in boosting male re
cruitment in Humßio and IR,
as opposed to efforts to in
crease female participation in
computer science, to types of
jobs that the majors often
lead to.
"One of the reasons we
care about the shortage of
women in fields of computer
science is because computer
science jobs pay very well
and they're very high status,
so if we got more women into
computer science, that would
help reduce the gender gap in
our society from a fairness
and equity standpoint," Cor
rell said, asserting that no
such impetus existed for IR
or Humßio.

(Humßio) and international relations (IR)
programs. For those two departments, how
ever, it's all about the women.
Seventy-nine percent of declared Humßio
majors are female, while women constitute
66 percent of declared IR majors.
"I hadn't heard much about the gender
gap, but when I got there I was pretty
shocked that there were girls everywhere,"
said Andre Decker 'l3, a Humßio major.
While the shortage of women in typically
male-dominated majors has been the subject
of extensive research, significantly less atten
tion has been paid to cases where the reverse
gender gap is true.
Shelley Correll M.A. '96 Ph.D. 'Ol, direc
tor of the Stanford Clayman Institute for
Gender Research, posited a few different hy
potheses, including the tendency of a gender
imbalance to become self-perpetuating over
time.
"When groups are already underrepre
sented, then new members are less likely to
go into the major," Correll said.
Correll added that research has demon
strated a difference in preferences between
men and women that might ultimately lead to
different choices of major.
"We do find that women place a slightly
higher value on jobs that they see as helping
other people," she said.
Nora Jendoubi 'l4, an IR major, said she
chose the program because she developed a
passion for international policies after grow
ing up in a multicultural environment.
Meanwhile Rachel Seeman 'l4, a Humßio
major, was drawn to the interdisciplinary na
ture of the program and the lack of a math re
quirement.
Michael Tomz, director of the IR pro
gram, hesitated to attribute the overall gen
der imbalance to any specific factor.
"These are deep and profound questions,
why certain genders are attracted to certain
majors and not as much to others," Tomz
said.
Paul Fisher 'B4, director of the Humßio
department, also expressed puzzlement over
the gender disparity.
"We typically attract students who have
broad interests, typically incorporating natu
ral and social sciences," Fisher said. "For
some reason, females seem to be more drawn
to it than males."
While neither Fisher nor Tomz could pin
point the cause for the underrepresentation
of male students in then- programs, Correll
said the gender gap could be problematic in a
variety of ways.
"For any important social problem, it's in
the interest of the society to
be really drawing from the
full range of talent within our
society," Correll said. "Hav
ing more men, we'd bring in a
different perspective than in
the absence of men."
David Hoyt 'l3, an IR ma
jor, said that while the gender
gap has never adversely af
fected his classes in the In
ternational Security track
a track that is either male
dominated or reaches gender
parity he recognizes the

gender disparity's social im
pact.
"I think that it's impor
tant to have both genders
weigh in on the discussion,"
Hoyt said.
Aside from inclusivity
concerns, Correll added that
reaching gender parity
among both female-dominat
ed and male-dominated ma
jors would resolve ongoing
social issues related to
stereotyping.
"To the extent that things
are more equalized across
gender lines, you reduce
some of the kinds of stereo
type threats that come about
when people are underrepre
sented," Correll said.

For Fisher, the main con
cern is not necessarily gen
der parity.
"I think the biggest con
cern for me as director is to
have the biggest diversity of
students," Fisher said. "We
attract people from all over
campus athletes, non-ath
letes ... I think the overrid
ing concern is that we really
reach out to the whole cam
pus."
Some female students,
like Humßio major Alison
Kadavy 'l5, said that the gen
der disparity has no effect,
while others welcomed it.
"It's easier to be in an en
vironment with all girls. I
find myself participating

more," said Raquel Ryan 'l5,
a Humßio major.
Correll said that one of
the few efforts to correct the
Humßio and IR gender gap
is organized by the Haas
Center for Public Service,
which has tried to bring in
more male students to bal
ance out the high number of
females.
He attributed the lack of
interest in boosting male re
cruitment in Humßio and IR,
as opposed to efforts to in
crease female participation in
computer science, to types of
jobs that the majors often
lead to.
"One of the reasons we
care about the shortage of
women in fields of computer
science is because computer
science jobs pay very well
and they're very high status,
so if we got more women into
computer science, that would
help reduce the gender gap in
our society from a fairness
and equity standpoint," Cor
rell said, asserting that no
such impetus existed for IR
or Humßio.
