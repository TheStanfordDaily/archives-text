## FacSen discusses sequester cuts 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports on the impact of potential
federal budget cuts on research at Stanford at its Thursday
meeting.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, professor of civil and environ
mental engineering, opened the meeting by applauding the elec
tion of Susanna Loeb 'BB, professor of education, to the National
Academy of Education and the selection of two Stanford gradu
ates as Gates Cambridge Scholars.
Peter Michelson M.S. '76 Ph.D. 'BO, professor of physics and
chair of the Academic Council's Committee on Research, opened
the meeting's agenda by providing the Senate with some back
ground information on the potential cuts in federal research
spending.
According to Michelson, federal funding constitutes 17 per
cent of Stanford's total consolidated revenues and supports 80
percent of all research conducted at the University outside of the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Under existing legisla
tion, a failure by Congress to agree to sufficiently large deficit
reduction measures by March 1 will prompt substantial cuts to

all discretionary spending,
including Stanford's exten
sive research funding.
Ryan Adesnik, director of
federal relations, empha
sized the difficulty of making
a case for protecting federal
research funding to a Con
gress fixated on fiscal re
sponsibility.
"Every piece of legisla
tion that comes to the floor of
Congress is viewed" in terms
of costs and deficits incurred,
Adesnik said. "There are no
more free rides."
Adesnik expressed doubt
that Congress would avert
the sequester and the cor
responding spending cuts
by March 1. He offered a
more optimistic view, howev
er, of the likelihood of Con
gress averting a March 27
government shutdown by
making temporary and in
cremental budgetary adjust
ments.
"It's unlikely [that], in the
next week, you're going to
get a deal," Adesnik said.
While the sequester cuts
will likely apply to all eligible
programs equally, Adesnik
noted that research funding
might be protected from the
worst of the cuts. Over the
last three years, the amount
of funding offered by re
search agencies like the Na
tional Institutes of Health
has remained relatively con
stant or even grown while as
sociated departments have
cut overall spending.
"Science accounts are
outperforming the rest of the
accounts in the budget,"

Adesnik said. "This is hap
pening in a bipartisan way."
Reviewing the long-term
future of federal research
funding, Adesnik struck a
largely cautious tone.
"Deficit reduction is here
to stay," Adesnik acknowl
edged. "[However], we're go
ing to get continued strong
support for scientific re
search ... We've really won
the argument that we're a
priority.
"We're going to keep ad
vocating hard for getting
these things [funding levels]
back to where they should
be," he added.
Dean of Research Ann
Arvin opened her presenta
tion by emphasizing the di
minishing relative signifi
cance of research funding to
University operations, even
as research funds received
grow in absolute value.
Arvin noted that the pro
jected sequester cut of eight
percent would reduce the
University's projected re
search revenues of $685 mil
lion in 2013 by just $5l mil
lion, out of a $4.5 billion total
for the University as a whole.
Moreover, from 1998 to 2011,
the proportion of research
supported by external grants
fell from 40 to 28 percent.
Arvin acknowledged,
however, the potential for
funding cuts to be more
acutely felt in certain areas
of the University compared
to others, citing as an exam
ple the prominent role
played by research funding
in supporting graduate stu
dents in non-medical fields.
Faculty discussion and
questioning focused largely
on the manner in which cuts
might be implemented as
well as on the University's

ability to mitigate the cuts'
impact.
Glenn Chertow, professor
of medicine, voiced his con
cern that funding reductions
may come at the expense of
School of Medicine students,
whose clinical teaching pres
ents faculty members with a
significant time commitment
and no immediate fiscal up
side.
"My concern is that the
first casualties will be the
students," Chertow empha
sized.
While some faculty mem
bers expressed concern
about statements made by
House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor that argued for even
more extensive cuts in re
search funding, Adesnik dis
missed this rhetoric as politi
cal posturing. After being re
minded by Levitt that Facul
ty Senate transcripts are
available to the public, how
ever, Adesnik quickly re
versed course.
"Eric Cantor's a great
American," Adesnik jesting
ly clarified.
Arvin concluded the
meeting by offering the Sen
ate a preview of online re
sources currently under de
velopment that aim to consol
idate relevant information
about obtaining research
grants for faculty consump
tion.
The Senate will hear the
annual reports of Vice
Provost for Graduate Educa
tion Patricia Gumport M.A.
'B2 M.A. 'B6 Ph.D. 'B7 and
Dean of the Graduate School
of Education Claude Steele
at its next meeting on March
7.
