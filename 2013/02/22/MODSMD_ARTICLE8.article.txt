# OPINIONS
## WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE Suites Dining 
### Chris Herries 
ResEd seems to have a talent
for making lackluster deci
sions. Like any talent, it re
quires meticulous practice and up
keep. And so there is now the
Suites controversy. There was a
piece that appeared in The Daily
courtesy of Miles Unterreiner re
garding Res Ed's decision to termi
nate relations with the student-run
nonprofit that provides food for
Suites. I highly suggest you read it.
There was also a fantastic piece by
Renee Donovan about one of the
chefs. Also worth the read.
Now, I'm not a Suites resident,
nor do I plan to be; it's just not my
style of living. However, this seems
to me like another horseshit move
by another self-aggrandized Stan
ford administrative body aimed at
limiting the autonomy of its stu
dents; feel free to refer to Chi
Theta Chi or the ID scanners on
the Row. Even worse, I think
ResEd can smell the putridity of
their own decisions but does them
anyway.
According to Mr. Unterreiner,
Dean of ResEd and possible Sith
Lord Deborah Colder cited the ter
mination of the student-run non
profit GovCo Dining Societies as
necessary due to "years of misman
agement" and a failure to "stay in
good standing and meet the food
needs" of residents. I doubt you
know what that means. I doubt
anyone knows what it means.
Here's the issue: If you're going
to cite something, cite examples,
not platitudes. What is mismanage
ment? Show me monetary loss, cor
ruption or ineptitude. Give me ex
amples, dates, notes and refer
ences. Frankly, I believe misman
agement is systematically disre
garding the wishes of the people in
your care, but that's just me.
Epistemology how we know
what we know is equally impor
tant. Whose food needs aren't be
ing met, in what numbers, in what
ways? How does ResEd gain its in
finite wisdom about the communi
ties it 'serves'? I doubt these ad-

ministrators have even eaten a
meal at Suites. I doubt they've
shaken hands with the chefs, sat
down with the students and execut
ed meticulous surveys. I doubt
these things because it's hard to
screw over people you've met and
care about. However, I may be
wrong, which is why I wish ResEd
would simply release all the min
utes, meetings, spreadsheets and
action plans associated with this de
cision. This isn't Berkeley; we're all
smart enough to sift through meet
ing minutes if they were easily ac
cessible.
Ms. Holder was also quoted as
wanting to "protect that communi
ty and what that community thinks
is important." This is elevating va
gary to an art form. How are you
defining the community, and how
do you know that community's de
sires? I encourage the residents of
Suites who were consulted to come
forward.
Let it be known: I am, as we all
are, a fairly reasonable person. The
problem is we're being treated like
children, meant to accept such
disingenuous drivel. All they need
to do is throw every document asso
ciated with this decision into a drop
box and email it to the Stanford
community.
For all you students out there,
think of the chefs, whether you eat
there or not. The guy who wakes up

at five in the morning to cook
omelets and greet students de
serves our respect. Our lifestyles
are built on the backs of blue-collar
workers, and it's high time we
showed some gratitude. My guess
is that having to sign with an out
side vendor will cost them either
money or autonomy. Even if it does

n't, putting these people through
months of uncertainty about their
future job is simply ridiculous.
Moreover, if you want to act
against this foolishness, act now.
Because once they contract this
outside vendor and form some sort
of crooked deal, the opportunity is
lost. There's nothing I'd like to see

more than genuine student action
on this issue, but I won't tell anyone
how to live their lives. I'll only ask
you to keep this in mind: Your au
tonomy is important. However, it's
not a value if you don't fight for it.
