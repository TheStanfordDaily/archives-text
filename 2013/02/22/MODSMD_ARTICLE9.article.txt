## Stanford athletes are students first 
### Sam Fisher 
When news broke
Monday that Texas
A&M's Heisman
winning quarter
back "Johnny Footr
ball" Manziel is taking only online
courses this semester, I stalled to ac
tually laugh out loud.
The idea that Stanford competes
with universities like Texas A&M on
the playing field is nothing short of ab
surd. It's getting to a point that I'm not
even sure Stanford's teams are play
ing the same sport as the rest of the
NCAAs Division I universities.
Can you even imagine Andrew
Luck taking online classes after his
breakout junior campaign so that he
could stay away from all of the atten
tion and just focus on his football train
ing?
The reality on this campus is very
different. Each of the last two years, I
traveled with Stanford women's bas
ketball during postseason play. I can
vividly remember a moment two years
ago at the then-Pac-10 championship
in Los Angeles, which took place dur
ing winter quarter's "Dead Week"
the week right before finals start.
I came down to the lobby of our ho
tel for a snack, and more importantly,
a break from the final paper that had
been tormenting me throughout the
evening. When I sat down on the
couch to relax, I began to talk to three
of the players on the team who were all
sitting with their laptops open.
They weren't on Facebook, they
were finishing problem sets and pa
pers, just like me. In about 15 hours,
Stanford would take on UCLA for the
Pac-10 title and win but first
came school.
Later that year, Stanford baseball
traveled to Ftdlerton for the NCAA
Regional during finals week. Players
were sometimes forced to take finals
immediately following a game, into the
wee hours of the morning, to fulfill
their academic requirements. I can't
imagine toying to stay focused and
rested while balancing finals and post
season play
Every time I read a story like the
one on Manziel's online classes, I find
it harder to believe that anyone else
has to balance anything nearly as diffi
cult as what Stanford student-athletes
do.
Let me be fair to Manziel here. As
suming that his reasoning is true
Manziel told Brent Zwenerman of the
San Antonio Express-News that he
tiled to take an on-campus English
class but his classmates' reaction to
him became "more of a big deal" than
he thought—Manziel is not to blame
for his choice to stick to just online
classes.
This is one of those rare cases
where, in fact, the athlete is the victim,
not the beneficiary, of the hero-wor
shipping culture of student bodies and
fanbases in general in SEC and Big-12
country
But Manziel didn't fight back—he
was content to go through the motions
with his online classes while finishing
out the remainder of his three-year
holding pattern to NFL stardom.
And Texas A&M was happy to let
him do so. As long as Johnny Football
brings his 2012 magic into the 2013
season, no Aggie will complain about
his questionable status as an online
student-athlete.
I spoke with senior water polo
player Melissa Seidemann on Wednes
day about her transition back to Stan
ford after a year off to train with the
U.S. Senior National Team for the
London Olympics she won a gold
medal with the team and I got a
very different view on education.
"I took 20 units fall quarter, I'm
taking 20 units this quarter, just so I
can have a little bit of a lighter spring,
but it's really given me perspective in
what I want to do with my future, so
that's been cool," Seidemann said.
"I've gained a new appreciation for the
classes that I can take here and ex
plore my passion."
I know that I'm not shocking any
one with the notion that Stanford stu
dent-athletes, for the most part, have
much more passion towards academ
ics than the average NCAA student
athlete. I also know that I wouldn't be
the first person to remind readers how
difficult it is to recruit to Stanford due
to the academic standards.
But I don't think many people real
ize that this academic challenge does
n't simply disappear by Stanford re
cruiting smarter and more academi
cally focused student-athletes.
I know for a fact that my coverage
of Stanford Athletics is better when
I'm taking a lighter course load. I've
had games on air with KZSU when
schoolwork has gotten in the way of
my performance. The week of Stan
ford football's game against Arizona,
