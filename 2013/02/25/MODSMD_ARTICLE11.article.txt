# A word on racist soccer fans
## 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
You can say many things
about Mario Balotelli, al
most all of them ridicu
lous or absurd, but give
the man credit: when it
comes to racism, he seems to be
strangely calm and collected.
Just a week after his own club's
vice president used a racist and
derogatory slur to refer to Balotelli,
poor Super Mario faced yet another
inferno at his own stadium, as travel
ing Inter Milan fans waved inflated
bananas at him whilst serenading him
with unprintable obscenities. Balotel
li's reputation would have him blow
up Paolo Berlusconi, the vice presi
dent in question, with a massive lire
works explosion. Instead, he shook
Berlusconi's hand and tried to use the
moment as a teaching tool for those
who are unaware of the consequences
of opening their mouths.
Similarly, watching the film of the
Milan derby, I couldn't help but ex
pect another "Malice at the Palace"-
style debacle ("Strangulation at the
San Siro," anyone?). Instead, Balotel
li reigned in his temper, nearly scored
three goals (he ended up with zero,
but that is hardly the point) and,
when the racist outpouring got un
bearable, he faced the crowd and
shushed them with poise. Heady
stuff from one of soccer's biggest
wildcards.

Ironically, this latest travesty
comes on the heels of another Milan
player, Kevin-Prince Boateng, walk
ing off the pitch in protest when he
was the target of racist abuse in an
other Serie A match. Meanwhile, if
the story of the league seasons in
many countries hasn't been the dra
ma (high everywhere except the Bun
desliga, where Bayern Munich looks
unbeatable) or the refereeing (univer
sally poor as always), it has been the
hideous racist abuse that continues to
worm its way into the beautiful game.
Pick a league, any league! I guar
antee that a player has been abused
racially at some point this season, de
spite the best efforts of the powers
that try to halt this malignant behav
ior. Whether it's a low-level second di
vision cup match or a European Cup
competition, somehow racism rears
its ugly head at all levels. That un
pleasant truth makes me sick to my
stomach.
I'm of the opinion that racism has
no place in the world, period, and I
challenge you to find a logical way to
disagree with that statement. One's
skin color or birthplace or religion or
name should have no bearing on how
he or she is treated in the real world.
And yet, soccer fans across Europe
and the world continue to display a
staggering disregard for basic human
equality.
Does being a sports fanatic vindi
cate stooping to the level of racist
taunting, legitimized because it is to
"help" your team achieve victory?
There comes a point when even the
most hardcore fans must draw the
line. Racism should be well on the in
accessible side of that line. Losing
your humanity is not worth whatever
it is that you think you may gain from
it.
The scary thing is that these racist
taunts show no signs of stopping, de
spite the existence of numerous or
ganizations like Kick It Out that try
to eliminate racism from soccer. What
does that say about us as human be
ings? Do all soccer fans secretly har
bor racist sentiments deep inside
their guts? Or is the mob psychology
of attending a soccer game enough to
suck in non-racist folks to chant loud
ly and proudly? Quite frankly, I have
no idea how to answer the previous
question, and I'm not sure that I want
to hear the answer.
The simple take-away message is
this: if you are a fan and someone next
to you is doing something racially in
sensitive or wrong, give them a good
smack upside the head and tell them
to cut it out. If you are a fan and are
the one actually doing something im
proper, then please go get help. I have
nothing more to say.
