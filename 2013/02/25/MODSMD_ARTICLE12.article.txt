## Seniors shine at Maples But Ogwumike steals spotlight 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the Stanford
women's basketball team comfortably
defeated the bottom two schools in the
Pac-12 conference, starting with a 90-53
rout of Oregon State on Friday night
and following that up with a 74-50 win
over Oregon on Senior Night.

The No. 4 Cardinal (26-2, 15-1 Pac
-12) pulled ahead early against the
Ducks (4-24, 2-14) on Sunday, holding
the visiting team scoreless for almost
five minutes in the first half on a 12-0
run for Stanford, thus extending its
winning streak over Oregon to 17
games.
Meanwhile, though, No. 6 Cal (25-2,
15-1) seemed in trouble at halftime
across the Bay, trailing Oregon State
(9-19,3-13) 30-18; the Golden Bears re
covered to sneak ahead 58-56 by the fi
nal buzzer and stay tied for the lead of
the Pac-12 conference with Stanford.
Sunday's game marked the final ap
pearance of senior forward Joslyn Tin

Pavilion though she will likely be
back for the NCAA Tournament First
and Second Rounds in a month's time
and perhaps the last for redshirt
junior forward Mikaela Ruef, too. Ruef
found out last week that she has been
accepted to coterm in civil and environ
mental engineering but was unsure if
this would be her last season or not.
"I am a senior this year," Ruef said.
"I came in with Jos [Tinkle], and I
would like to come back, but we don't
really know what could happen or
whatever next year. I do have an extra
year of eligibility, so it would be awe
some to come back, but we never know.
I'm celebrating Senior Night with my
best friend Jos."
Tinkle, however, scored four points
and grabbed five boards in what she
knows for certain was her final true
home game. It was also the first time in
her collegiate career that both of her
