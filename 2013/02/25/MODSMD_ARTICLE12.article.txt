## Seniors shine at Maples But Ogwumike steals spotlight 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, the Stanford
women's basketball team comfortably
defeated the bottom two schools in the
Pac-12 conference, starting with a 90-53
rout of Oregon State on Friday night
and following that up with a 74-50 win
over Oregon on Senior Night.

The No. 4 Cardinal (26-2, 15-1 Pac
-12) pulled ahead early against the
Ducks (4-24, 2-14) on Sunday, holding
the visiting team scoreless for almost
five minutes in the first half on a 12-0
run for Stanford, thus extending its
winning streak over Oregon to 17
games.
Meanwhile, though, No. 6 Cal (25-2,
15-1) seemed in trouble at halftime
across the Bay, trailing Oregon State
(9-19,3-13) 30-18; the Golden Bears re
covered to sneak ahead 58-56 by the fi
nal buzzer and stay tied for the lead of
the Pac-12 conference with Stanford.
Sunday's game marked the final ap
pearance of senior forward Joslyn Tin
kle in a regular season game at Maples
Pavilion though she will likely be
back for the NCAA Tournament First
and Second Rounds in a month's time
and perhaps the last for redshirt
junior forward Mikaela Ruef, too. Ruef
found out last week that she has been
accepted to coterm in civil and environ
mental engineering but was unsure if
this would be her last season or not.
"I am a senior this year," Ruef said.
"I came in with Jos [Tinkle], and I
would like to come back, but we don't
really know what could happen or
whatever next year. I do have an extra
year of eligibility, so it would be awe
some to come back, but we never know.
I'm celebrating Senior Night with my
best friend Jos."
Tinkle, however, scored four points
and grabbed five boards in what she
knows for certain was her final true
home game. It was also the first time in
her collegiate career that both of her

parents, Wayne and Lisa Tin
kle, were at Maples together
for one of her games since her
father has had to balance a
busy schedule as the head
coach of the Montana men's
basketball team.
"It was an emotional day,
I'm going to probably choke
up now," Tinkle said. "I can
picture myself yesterday
walking through this campus
and falling in love with it right
away, coming in as a fresh
man, meeting Mikaela for the
first time just in this hallway
down here. It's surreal, it re
ally hasn't sunk in, really has
n't hit me."
Against Oregon State on
Friday, four Cardinal players
scored double-figure points:
junior forward Chiney Ogwu
mike, sophomore forward
Taylor Greenfield, sopho
more guard Amber Orrange
and Tinkle, with 19,18,15 and
11 points, respectively.
Greenfield's tally, which in
clude 4-of-5 from beyond the
arc, tied her career-high set
earlier this season against
Gonzaga and Tinkle's score
earned her the honor of being
the 34th member of Stanford's
1,000-Point Club. Ruef's 10-6-
6 on rebounds, points and as
sists also marked another big
game for the Beavercreek,
Ohio native.
On Sunday, doing her best
to steal the limelight from sen
iors Tinkle and Ruef, Ogwu
mike grabbed her school
record 52nd double-double
with her first ever 20/20 game.
Alongside her 27 points, the 24
boards that she brought down
took the single-game re
bounding school record away
from her older sister
Nnemkadi Ogwumike'l2 and
made her the sixth member
the 1,000 rebounds club. It al
so made her just the sixth
Stanford player to have
recorded both 1,000 points
and 1,000 rebounds.
However, other players
made important contributions
of their own, including 12
points from Orrange and eight
from each junior guard Sara
James and sophomore for
ward Bonnie Samuelson. Ruef
also grabbed nine rebounds
even though she played limit
ed minutes.
Ogwumike was quick to

point out the importance of
her teammates in the records
she set, especially highlighting
the roles that Ruef and Tinkle
have had in her three seasons
so far at Stanford.
"Mikaela taught me that
you should always work hard,
there's no off-season," Ogwu
mike said. "Every day is a
chance for you to get better. I
think she might have worked
the hardest of our team in the
off-season because she want
ed to have a chance to play
She was always on the gun,
every day in the summer.
During her breaks in be
tween classes she'll come and
shoot, so she definitely sets a
standard.
"And then Joslyn. There's
some people that make you
realize it's so much more than

a game and Joslyn's one of
those people. Her energy that
she brings in life in general,
you just see a little glimpse of
it on the court, but off the
court she's just a special per
son. I don't know one person
that does not like Joslyn Tin
kle."
Stanford will now head
north at the end of this week
to close out Pac-12 conference
play against Washington in
Seattle on Thursday at 7 p.m.
PT and then Washington
State in Pullman on Saturday
at noon. With Cal still tied for
first place and the top seed in
the Pac-12 Tournament still up
for grabs, the Cardinal will
need to win both contests.
