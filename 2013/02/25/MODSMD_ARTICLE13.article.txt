# HOME SWEEP
## APPEL, CARD DOWNS FRESNO STATE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
All three games were nail-biters, but great pitching
and timely hitting led No. 11 Stanford to a three-game
sweep of visiting Fresno State at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (5-2) took the series opener Friday night,
3-1. Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel (1-1) pitched a
gem to earn his first victory on the mound since a 9-1
win over the same Fresno State Bulldogs in Stanford's
first game of the 2012 Palo Alto Regional on June 1.
In the words of many of the 30-plus scouts in atten
dance Friday night, it may have been the best Appel
has ever looked in a start. In his first time through the
lineup, Appel used mostly his fastball and slider, but as
the game went on, he threw a lot more of his change
up en route to complete domination of the Bulldogs
Appel retired 16 of the last 17 batters he faced.
"His slider was better than I'd ever seen,"
Scoutcom's National Baseball Expert Kiley McDaniel
said about Appel. "If he pitches like that the rest of the
year... he's going to be a slam dunk for the No. 1 pick."
Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo contributed in
a big way to the winning effort once again. Ringo
knocked in junior Brian Ragira with a first inning single
before scoring the winning ran on a bases-loaded walk
from junior Brett Michael Doran.
"We were having good at bats all day" Ringo said.
"We were hitting balls hard. I don't think anyone was
really worried; it was just a matter of when it was going
to happen. We knew Mark was going to keep us in the
game; he always does. He's amazing."
Doran's bases-loaded walk tamed out to be only the
second most important play of his weekend.

On Saturday, after
a Fresno State come
back sent the game to
extra innings, Doran
delivered the most
clutch at bat of his Car-

dinal career. With runners on first and second with no
body out, Doran took a 1-2 pitch from Jordan Blink
deep to left field for a walk-off home run, clinching a se
ries win for Stanford.
"When I was going up there I knew I was probably
going to bunt," Doran said. "So I was trying to get the
bunt down get runners to second and third with on
ly one out. Missed the bunt, so I was like 'alright I've
just got to put together a good at bat and battle
through it.' Luckily he left me a pitch up in the zone
and I hit it."
Doran's homer bailed out freshman pitcher Daniel
Starwalt, who gave up two runs one earned —to al
low Fresno State to tie the game in the ninth. Sopho
more starting pitcher John Hochstatter got the no-de
cision after a great start. The sophomore allowed two
runs on a home run by Taylor Ward in the third —in
6.1 innings, finishing with seven strikeouts.
Ragira also starred in Sunday's contest, going two
for three with two RBI and two runs scored. Ragira and
sophomore Austin Slater were the only two Cardinal
hitters to record multiple hits on the afternoon. Stan
ford turned five Fresno State errors into two unearned
runs to help send the game to extra innings.
On Sunday, Stanford looked to sweep behind fresh
man left-handed pitcher Logan James. In his first ca-
