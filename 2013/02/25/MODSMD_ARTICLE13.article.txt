# HOME SWEEP
## APPEL, CARD DOWNS FRESNO STATE 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
All three games were nail-biters, but great pitching
and timely hitting led No. 11 Stanford to a three-game
sweep of visiting Fresno State at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (5-2) took the series opener Friday night,
3-1. Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel (1-1) pitched a
gem to earn his first victory on the mound since a 9-1
win over the same Fresno State Bulldogs in Stanford's
first game of the 2012 Palo Alto Regional on June 1.
In the words of many of the 30-plus scouts in atten
dance Friday night, it may have been the best Appel
has ever looked in a start. In his first time through the
lineup, Appel used mostly his fastball and slider, but as
the game went on, he threw a lot more of his change
up en route to complete domination of the Bulldogs
Appel retired 16 of the last 17 batters he faced.
"His slider was better than I'd ever seen,"
Scoutcom's National Baseball Expert Kiley McDaniel
said about Appel. "If he pitches like that the rest of the
year... he's going to be a slam dunk for the No. 1 pick."
Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo contributed in
a big way to the winning effort once again. Ringo
knocked in junior Brian Ragira with a first inning single
before scoring the winning ran on a bases-loaded walk
from junior Brett Michael Doran.
"We were having good at bats all day" Ringo said.
"We were hitting balls hard. I don't think anyone was
really worried; it was just a matter of when it was going
to happen. We knew Mark was going to keep us in the
game; he always does. He's amazing."
Doran's bases-loaded walk tamed out to be only the
second most important play of his weekend.

On Saturday, after
a Fresno State come
back sent the game to
extra innings, Doran
delivered the most
clutch at bat of his Car-

dinal career. With runners on first and second with no
body out, Doran took a 1-2 pitch from Jordan Blink
deep to left field for a walk-off home run, clinching a se
ries win for Stanford.
"When I was going up there I knew I was probably
going to bunt," Doran said. "So I was trying to get the
bunt down get runners to second and third with on
ly one out. Missed the bunt, so I was like 'alright I've
just got to put together a good at bat and battle
through it.' Luckily he left me a pitch up in the zone
and I hit it."
Doran's homer bailed out freshman pitcher Daniel
Starwalt, who gave up two runs one earned —to al
low Fresno State to tie the game in the ninth. Sopho
more starting pitcher John Hochstatter got the no-de
cision after a great start. The sophomore allowed two
runs on a home run by Taylor Ward in the third —in
6.1 innings, finishing with seven strikeouts.
Ragira also starred in Sunday's contest, going two
for three with two RBI and two runs scored. Ragira and
sophomore Austin Slater were the only two Cardinal
hitters to record multiple hits on the afternoon. Stan
ford turned five Fresno State errors into two unearned
runs to help send the game to extra innings.
On Sunday, Stanford looked to sweep behind fresh
man left-handed pitcher Logan James. In his first ca-

struggled early the first
three Owls he faced scored
before buckling down. He took
the loss, as Stanford fell 3-0.
Against Fresno State,
James started slowly again, al
lowing two runs one earned
in the top of the first inning.
But unlike the week before at
Rice, James couldn't find his
command in the second, allow
ing another ran before being
pulled from the game before
the start of the third inning.
Freshman right hander
Bobby Zarabin came in to try
to keep the game close after
Stanford cut the Bulldogs'
lead to 3-1 in the bottom of the
second. Zarabin rose to the oc
casion, keeping Fresno State
off the scoreboard until the
seventh inning, when Aaron
Judge hit the longest home
run of the season to tie the
game at four.
In the bottom of the
eighth, Stanford finished off
its comeback to give Zarabin
his first comfortable lead of
the afternoon. Sophomore
catcher Wayne Taylor
knocked in freshman center
fielder Drew Jackson from

first on an opposite-field dou
ble to give Stanford a one-run
edge. Then, two batters later,
Danny Diekroeger sealed the
victory with a two-run homer
to right field his first of the
season to give Stanford a 7-
4 lead.
Zarubin came within one
out of finishing the game him
self, but Stanford pitching
coach Rusty Filter elected to
go with junior Sam Lindquist
for the one-out save. Lindquist
retired Taylor Ward on a weak
grounder to shortstop to finish
the sweep of the Bulldogs.
Zarubin finished with 6.2
innings pitched, eleven strike
outs and one run allowed to
earn the victory, the first of his
Stanford career.
In the end, the friendly

confines of Sunken Diamond
gave Stanford the boost it
needed after a tough opening
series loss at Rice. Stanford
has won four straight games
since returning from Houston,
all of which were played at
Sunken Diamond.
"We play so much better at
home," Ringo said. "It's just so
much easier to play in front of
the home crowd, especially

said about Appel. "If he pitches like that the rest of the
year... he's going to be a slam dunk for the No. 1 pick."
Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo contributed in
a big way to the winning effort once again. Ringo
knocked in junior Brian Ragira with a first inning single
before scoring the winning ran on a bases-loaded walk
from junior Brett Michael Doran.
"We were having good at bats all day" Ringo said.
"We were hitting balls hard. I don't think anyone was
really worried; it was just a matter of when it was going
to happen. We knew Mark was going to keep us in the
game; he always does. He's amazing."
Doran's bases-loaded walk tamed out to be only the
second most important play of his weekend.

On Saturday, after
a Fresno State come
back sent the game to
extra innings, Doran
delivered the most
clutch at bat of his Car-

dinal career. With runners on first and second with no
body out, Doran took a 1-2 pitch from Jordan Blink
deep to left field for a walk-off home run, clinching a se
ries win for Stanford.
"When I was going up there I knew I was probably
going to bunt," Doran said. "So I was trying to get the
bunt down get runners to second and third with on
ly one out. Missed the bunt, so I was like 'alright I've
just got to put together a good at bat and battle
through it.' Luckily he left me a pitch up in the zone
and I hit it."
Doran's homer bailed out freshman pitcher Daniel
Starwalt, who gave up two runs one earned —to al
low Fresno State to tie the game in the ninth. Sopho
more starting pitcher John Hochstatter got the no-de
cision after a great start. The sophomore allowed two
runs on a home run by Taylor Ward in the third —in
6.1 innings, finishing with seven strikeouts.
Ragira also starred in Sunday's contest, going two
for three with two RBI and two runs scored. Ragira and
sophomore Austin Slater were the only two Cardinal
hitters to record multiple hits on the afternoon. Stan
ford turned five Fresno State errors into two unearned
runs to help send the game to extra innings.
On Sunday, Stanford looked to sweep behind fresh
man left-handed pitcher Logan James. In his first ca-

reer start at Rice on the sea
son's opening weekend, James
struggled early the first
three Owls he faced scored
before buckling down. He took
the loss, as Stanford fell 3-0.
Against Fresno State,
James started slowly again, al
lowing two runs one earned
in the top of the first inning.
But unlike the week before at
Rice, James couldn't find his
command in the second, allow
ing another ran before being
pulled from the game before
the start of the third inning.
Freshman right hander
Bobby Zarabin came in to try
to keep the game close after
Stanford cut the Bulldogs'
lead to 3-1 in the bottom of the
second. Zarabin rose to the oc
casion, keeping Fresno State
off the scoreboard until the
seventh inning, when Aaron
Judge hit the longest home
run of the season to tie the
game at four.
In the bottom of the
eighth, Stanford finished off
its comeback to give Zarabin
his first comfortable lead of
the afternoon. Sophomore
catcher Wayne Taylor
knocked in freshman center
fielder Drew Jackson from

first on an opposite-field dou
ble to give Stanford a one-run
edge. Then, two batters later,
Danny Diekroeger sealed the
victory with a two-run homer
to right field his first of the
season to give Stanford a 7-
4 lead.
Zarubin came within one
out of finishing the game him
self, but Stanford pitching
coach Rusty Filter elected to
go with junior Sam Lindquist
for the one-out save. Lindquist
retired Taylor Ward on a weak
grounder to shortstop to finish
the sweep of the Bulldogs.
Zarubin finished with 6.2
innings pitched, eleven strike
outs and one run allowed to
earn the victory, the first of his
Stanford career.
In the end, the friendly

confines of Sunken Diamond
gave Stanford the boost it
needed after a tough opening
series loss at Rice. Stanford
has won four straight games
since returning from Houston,
all of which were played at
Sunken Diamond.
"We play so much better at
home," Ringo said. "It's just so
much easier to play in front of
the home crowd, especially
when Mark goes nine innings
and gives up one run. That's
also very nice."
Stanford will head back on
the road Hresday for an early
afternoon contest against St.
Mary's. First pitch is sched

All three games were nail-biters, but great pitching
and timely hitting led No. 11 Stanford to a three-game
sweep of visiting Fresno State at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford (5-2) took the series opener Friday night,
3-1. Senior stalling pitcher Mark Appel (1-1) pitched a
gem to earn his first victory on the mound since a 9-1
win over the same Fresno State Bulldogs in Stanford's
first game of the 2012 Palo Alto Regional on June 1.
In the words of many of the 30-plus scouts in atten
dance Friday night, it may have been the best Appel
has ever looked in a start. In his first time through the
lineup, Appel used mostly his fastball and slider, but as
the game went on, he threw a lot more of his change
up en route to complete domination of the Bulldogs
Appel retired 16 of the last 17 batters he faced.
"His slider was better than I'd ever seen,"
Scoutcom's National Baseball Expert Kiley McDaniel
said about Appel. "If he pitches like that the rest of the
year... he's going to be a slam dunk for the No. 1 pick."
Senior designated hitter Justin Ringo contributed in
