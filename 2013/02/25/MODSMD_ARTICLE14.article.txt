# Card trips up in Eugene
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Cardinal men's
basketball team (16-12,7-8 Pac-12)
delivered its most impressive per
formance of the season on Jan.
30th when it knocked off the Ore
gon Ducks (22-6,11-4), ranked No.
10 in the nation at the time, in
blowout fashion. When the Card
traveled to Eugene to take on the
Ducks for the second time this sea
son, it was looking for a similar re
sult.

However, in January, the
Ducks were reeling after losing
their starting point guard Dominic
Artis to a foot injury. They have
since had time to acclimate, adjust
ing their game plan to compensate
for his absence. The team that
Stanford played in Eugene on Sat
urday night was very different
from the one that showed up at
Maples Pavilion earlier in the sea
son.
Early on, it appeared that
Stanford was going to have its way
for the second time, as it jmnped
out to a quick 12-5 lead after guard
Aaron Bright found teammate
Chasson Randle on the perimeter
for an open 3-pointer. Oregon then
picked up the intensity, going on a
quick 8-0 run, highlighted by two
offensive rebound put-backs from
forward Tony Woods, to grab a one
point lead.
The remainder of the half was
very back-and-forth, as neither
team could establish themselves as
the dominant force. Senior for
ward Arsalan Kazemi gave the
Ducks their biggest lead of the half

when he converted on a layup in
the paint, putting them up 21-16
with just over five minutes to play.
Stanford junior forward
Dwight Powell immediately coun
tered, knocking down a mid-range
jump shot and then picking up an
and-one in the paint. He made the
free throw, cutting Stanford's
deficit to three. Two minutes later,
junior forward Josh Huestis re
captured the lead for the Card,
throwing down a nice dunk to put
his team up one.
Johnathan Loyd then started
to heat up, draining a 3-pointer
and then hitting a pair of free
throws to give Oregon a 30-26 lead.
Junior forward John Gage's 3-
point attempt to close out the half
then rimmed out, sending Stan
ford into the break down four;
The second half was a similar
story, as the Ducks couldn't quite
pull away Each time it appeared
that Oregon was going to go on a
run, the Card would counter with a
bucket. After Tony Woods made a
jump shot, Huestis knocked down
a rare 3-pointer, putting Stanford
down 37-33 with 15:49 remaining.
Oregon's E.J. Singler teamed up
with Loyd to make back-to-back
layups to stretch the Ducks' lead to
eight.
The Ducks then star-ted to pull
away at the 10-nrinute mark, as
Singler went three-for-four from
the free-throw line to give his
squad a 51-36 lead. Senior Carlos
Emory then took control for Ore
gon, draining three straight
jumpers on consecutive posses
sions. Stanford head coach John
ny Dawkins, sensing that the
game was spiraling out of control
for his team, then called a timeout
down 58-39.
It was to no avail, as the Card

In a close game against Oregon, junior forward Dwight Powell (33)

around, the Ducks came through with the victory on their home court.
