### Hashing at Suites Dining: A Memory EMILY LAYDEN '11 
It is an abstract thing to explain:
hashing. Attempts are punctu
ated by my own dismissive
hand-waving; an inability to make
eye contact; before I've really be
gun, a surrender. It is difficult to un
derstand not only because the word
itself is illogical but because of the
greater incongruity: the fact that
we (the "hashers") enjoyed it,
forged friendships in this way, recall
the job with a smile.
On paper, and to any outsider,
hashing is at best disgusting and at
worst nauseating. The practice at
Stanford is not unique to Suites, but
nowhere else on campus is it as all
inclusive as at Suites Dining Socie
ty. Hashers at Suites are responsi
ble for cleaning the clubs, work on a
rotating schedule to do so, are paid
a small but quickly cumulative
amount for their efforts, and had
until very recently the opportunity
to make a small accessory career
out of it: Suites hashers could work
their way to becoming kitchen and
club managers, CEOs and CFOs of
the soon-to-be formerly-student
run operation.
As a Stanford undergraduate, I
lived in Suites for two years,
worked as a hasher for three, and
cooked Sunday dinner (at Suites,
Sunday brunch and dinner are stu
dent-cooked meals) for two, usually
with a friend who became over the
course of those Sunday evenings
one of my very closest. Suites my
tenure as a hasher and cook was,
all natural instinct to the contrary,
integral to my Stanford experience.
I say "all instinct to the con
trary" because there is very natural
disbelief that any eighteen- or nine
teen-year-old girl might enjoy
scraping dried cereal from aban
doned breakfast bowls. And yet
hashing scrubbing clean an in
dustrial kitchen after a chef has
prepared a meal for fifty or sixty of
my friends, teammates, and room
mates— remains one of my most
enduring and defining memories of
Stanford. On a smaller and more se
questered and less-consequential
scale, hashing mirrors the actual
stress of restaurant work, and I am
sure there was something inherent
in the chaos and pace and general
loudness that drew me to it, but that
is not quite the point. Nor is it that
at a very expensive school (in a crip
plingly expensive area) where there
are never enough hours in the day,
hashing its longest shift just
three hours on a Sunday afternoon
was away to earn a couple hun
dred dollars every month.
For nearly all of us, the work was
needed. But even this is not why I
hope that, when an outside vendor
is brought in to manage the former
ly-student-run Suites Dining Socie
ty, they keep student hashing.
Looking back now through the un
avoidably charming haze of nostal
gia, the most enduring takeaway
was that, scraping burnt chili from
the bottom of a five-gallon pot, I
made some very good friends.
Working in two-man teams, we
mopped floors and wiped down ta
bles. We washed dishes hun
dreds of dishes, thousands of dish
es, spent cumulatively hours elbow
deep in scalding and browning wa
ter, our fingers and nails worked
raw by steel wool. We scraped hard
ened drippings off oven racks and
learned to disassemble and re
assemble a deli meat slicer. At Stan
ford, where the use of acronyms and
nicknames (FMOTQ, MemChu,
FroSoCo, LSJUMB) might require
an outsider to find a translator,
hashing too has its own language: of
Hobarts and Robocoupes; of the

mess wrought by barbeque chicken
and the searing burn of vinegar on a
hot grill. For three years I ruined t
shirt after t-shirt, one after another
flecked pink with bleach stains.
And yet if song and scent are our
strongest memory cues, there is a
playlist that runs in my mind one
punctuated by Robyn and nineties
throwbacks and this one ten-minute
electronic anthem by somebody or
some group called "009 Sound Sys
tem" — and a particular combina
tion of smells (bleach; white vine
gar) that reminds me not just of a
weird job I had but of some friends
I have not seen in a while; some
friends I would not have met if it
weren't for hashing.
The point here (although it is
surely the point in general) is not to
point out the travesty of the im
pending ResEd takeover the un
yieldingness, the illogicalness, the
gross mistreatment of decades-de
voted Stanford employees have
been exhaustively documented in
this paper in a series of pieces by
Miles Unterreiner but rather to
note that, despite Res Ed's insis
tence to the contrary, Suites was in
simple terms very good to its resi
dents. Those of us who worked in
the clubs as hashers and managers
took pride in our work; we left The
Farm with our Stanford experience
informed in no small part by these
our time at Suites.
I of course echo sentiments re
garding the egregiously unfair
treatment levied upon the Suites
chefs Dennis taught me the se
cret to a good chili, Tony how to tell
a good story, and Frank the impor
tance of an earnest "good morning"
and as much as I believe they de
serve better, I believe that future
Stanford students deserve Suites as
it was, as it is, as I will always re
member it.
