# Stanford's Labor Rights Problem
## 
### MATTHEW COLFORD '14 
I'm not an activist. I don't occupy
or protest, sit in or walk out.
Though I'm a Roman Catholic,
sixth-generation liberal California
Democrat who was reared on homi
ly after homily and parental spiel
after parental spiel about fighting
for the rights of laborers, I never
paid much attention to the issue
or perhaps I chose to ignore it. Re
cently, though, it's been difficult to
look the other way and accept Stan
ford's unfair treatment of its loyal
employees. It's time for all of us to
admit: Stanford has a problem.
My freshman year I was part of
"Habla," a group that tutors Stan
ford janitors who need help learn
ing English. Uriel, my tutee,
worked two jobs and lived in East
Palo Alto. Ultimately, though, Uriel
stopped coming to our sessions. It
wasn't because he lost interest in
learning English (he was making
quite a bit of progress, in fact).
Uriel, along with all of his co-work
ers, was laid off by the subcontrac
tor to which Stanford had out
sourced janitorial responsibilities.
Did Stanford know he would be
unable to continue learning Eng
lish? Probably not. Did Stanford en
sure that he found another job?
Doubtful. Stanford's decision was
purely strategic. At a certain point,
Stanford would become responsible
for overseeing the conditions under
which the janitors worked, from fair
insurance policies to issues of labor
abuse. So the janitors were cycled
out, replaced by new ones who will
likely meet the same fate as Uriel,
all the while saving Stanford a little
money. These types of practices
have been occurring campus-wide,

from the recent decision to restruc
ture the management of Suites din
ing to the widespread layoffs and
outsourcing of janitors at the Med
ical School. It doesn't take the head
of AFL-CIO to tell you that's
wrong.
While I don't pretend to know
how difficult some administrative
decisions are or what details go in to
allocating Stanford's operating
budget, when an endowment ex
ceeds 17 billion dollars, is there re
ally cause for putting people like
Uriel out of work to save some
cash? While I'm sure the adminis
trators at ResEd don't just sit
around and brainstorm ways to lay
off employees, is the university re
ally doing everything it can to en
sure that labor practices aren't just
legal but also fair? And while I'm
sure we can all agree that having
another Arrillaga gym will be nice,
can we honestly say that we would
n't have preferred for some of that
money to go towards keeping peo
ple in work?
My sense is that a lot of people
will read this and assure me that the
Stanford practices I've described
haven't really affected them. "I
don't live in Chi Theta Chi," you
might say, or "I don't know the
chefs at Suites."
Neither do I. I really do under
stand how easy it would be to read
this column, close this issue of The
Daily, and do no more than simply
shake your head at Res Ed. Don't
get me wrong: I love our school. I

don't like to preach. I'll be the first
to admit that I'm not an activist
type.
But when the university that I
am proud to associate with and the
administrators whom I trust begin
to put profits over loyal employees
and cost-saving over student inter
ests, I'll raise a voice and recall that
sense of social justice that some
times gets buried inside me. I hope
you will, too.
