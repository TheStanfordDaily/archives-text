# Class Confessions on Campus
## 
### THE FLIP LEADERSHIP CORE The Stanford First-Generation and/or Low-In-come Partnership (FLIP) Leadership Core is a team of students committed to building community providing resources for first-generation and/or low-income students and, allies 
The Stanford First Generation
and/or Low-Income Partner
ship (FLIP) recently hosted a
workshop where students of all
class backgrounds were invited to
discuss our socioeconomic status se
crets and share ideas for how to
move toward a more honest and in
clusive campus community. Over 50
students showed up, eager to en
gage in Stanford's first cross-class
discussion space.
Before the event, we asked peo
ple to submit their "Class Confes
sions," or instances in which they
had concealed their class identities.
We displayed these anonymous rev
elations at our workshop, where at
tendees could read and reflect on
their peers' class secrets. Here is a
sampling of the more than 80 con
fessions, which were split evenly be
tween students who identified as
having class privilege and those who
did not:
"When I was abroad, I pretend
ed to be extremely sick because I
wanted people to stop asking me
why I couldn't buy a plane ticket to
explore nearby countries during a
long weekend."
"I use my knowledge about fi
nancial aid to pretend that I receive
it when talking to friends and ac
quaintances."
As we watched these anonymous
secrets pour in, we realized just how
serious the silence around class can
be on this campus. These confes
sions demonstrated that although
some students are confident in their
class identities, so many of us
from every position on the socioeco
nomic spectrum hide parts of
ourselves that relate to money.
But our discussion demonstrated
the desire that students have to
move past all this secrecy and to
ward a campus community in which
we can all be authentic and whole,
especially regarding our class iden
tities. We asked participants to gen
erate "Ideas for Action" as they
browsed the "Confessions" and re
flected in small groups. In particu
lar, we asked everyone to engage

with one question: "What sort of
barriers prevent you from being
honest about your class background,
and what can we do to overcome
those?"
The group came up with amazing
ideas for institutional changes that
could impact cross-class relation
ships on campus. Students asked for
more programming around class
identities during New Student Ori
entation, as well as throughout resi
dential staff training. Several atten
dees suggested that ResEd might
provide more funding for dorm trips
and off-campus cultural events, so
that all students can be included re
gardless of their financial situations
without feeling isolated.
We also reflected on ways in
which we can work to combat the se
crecy and fear individually, in our in
terpersonal relationships and inter
actions. Students suggested that we
each recognize that class is every
where, and that it defines our experi
ences here more than we might
think. Yes, Stanford offers people the
opportunity to move into new social
classes. But our backgrounds will ab
solutely influence our lives in college
from weekend plans to career
plans, as indicated by the "Class
Confessions."
One of the most important take
aways from our discussion was the
reminder that we shouldn't make as
sumptions about one another based
on our relationships to wealth. It's
apparent that most of us fear the as
sumptions that others might make,
so why should we perpetuate those
as well? Let's all commit to appreci
ating peoples' values and experi
ences instead of the superficial
stereotypes that we might ascribe to
someone because of his or her class
background. We won't be able to
share our class identities without
judgment if we don't let others do the
same.
Finally, we learned that we can
all change the culture around class
on campus by speaking up about our
own class backgrounds, by starting
the conversation and encouraging
others to join us.
We are so grateful for those who
shared their "Class Confessions"
with us, and we really feel for those
who are carrying deep secrets.
But know that you are not alone,
and that there is a community of stu
dents who are here to hear you out.
