## Net Appetit returns with new regulations 
### SAMANTHA LYNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Net Appetit, the food truck that was asked to leave cam
pus earlier this quarter under the University's new mobile
food vendor policy, has returned to Stanford, albeit operat
ing as a delivery truck that can only take orders ahead of
time.
The terms of Net Appetit's return, according to an email
from Assistant Vice President for Business Development
Susan Weinstein '72 MBA '79, stipulate that Chon Vo
Net Appetit's founder and operator must take orders
and payment off campus, prepare and package food off
campus and deliver each meal individually to each customer
in dorms or offices. If those conditions are not met, Net Ap-

Net Appetit will be allowed to return to Stanford if
founder Chon Vo abides by a series of stipulations, including
preparing and packaging food, taking orders
and accepting payment off-campus.
petit will be removed from campus
again.
The University's revised policy
for Net Appetit may be more strin
gent than its approach to other ven
dors. Delivery services like Domi
no's Pizza are paid in cash on cam
pus, while delivery companies often
cater large events without deliver
ing food individually to each cus
tomer.
Vo said he was unable to reach
Weinstein about operating Net Ap
petit as a delivery service, but AS
SU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 acted
as a liaison between Vo along
with concerned students and We
instein
Bindra said that when he corre
sponded with Weinstein about re
branding Net Appetit as a delivery
service, she seemed receptive to
communication but inflexible about
the policy.
"I don't think she was fully able
to appreciate the sense of communi
ty that Vo had built," Bindra said.
"[She didn't believe] that it would
merit at least some sort of excep
tion."
Under the University's new
terms, Vo can continue to serve food
in his original location on Santa
Teresa Street. Now, however, cus
tomers have to place their orders
before coming to the track. In the
last week, campus police have visit
ed three times to check that all food
is being pre-ordered either by email
or text message.
Vo emphasized that he acknowl

edges the need for regulation
through a mobile food vendor policy,
but he framed some of the delivery
requirements sent to Bindra from
Weinstein as unreasonable. Howev
er, he expressed general satisfaction
with his accomplishments to date.
"[Net Appetit] lasted 10 times
longer than I expected, so if it goes
away now, personally, I will be total
ly satisfied because I have done my
job," Vo said.
Vo identified his primary rea
sons for fighting to stay on campus
as his customers and the charity
that receives Net Appetit's profits,
Aid to Children Without Parents, an
organization in Vietnam that feeds
orphans.
"I have a four-year old, and I
would never worry about her being
hungry in this country, but I worry
about her not having the right guid
ance in her education," Vo said
about the University's moves to re
move him from campus.
A petition in support of Net Ap
petit and other displaced mobile
food vendors, such as Mia's Cater
ing, has meanwhile continued to
gain signatures.
Bindra said that he signed the
petition because he disagreed with
the manner in which Net Appetit's
removal was handled, despite un
derstanding both the University's
position on the matter and Vo's per
spective.
"I'm slightly pessimistic about
[the petition] having any actual im
pact, but I do agree with the spirit of
it," he said. "I do agree that the Uni
versity shouldn't be taking super
staunch policies on things that neg
atively impact the community at
Stanford."
Amidst the ongoing uncertainty

involving food trucks on campus,
the Stanford Federalist Society
hosted a talk about food trucks and
economic liberty on Thursday, Feb.
21 at the Stanford Law School.
Lawyers and representatives of
various food vendor associations
spoke about food truck owners' eco
nomic rights to sell food and earn a
living.
However, Matt Geller, head of
the Southern California Mobile
Food Vendors Association, noted
that food trucks "basically have zero
rights" on a university campus.
"Stanford has the right and the
power to manage its own campus,
but beyond that, it should definitely
listen to what students have to say,"
said Bert Gall, director of the Insti
tute for Justice's National Street
Vending Initiative. "It sounds like
there's been some real backlash,
and people are going to miss the
trucks that can't be here anymore,
and Stanford probably should have
thought about that before contract
ing out to Off the Grid for the exclu
sive rights."
Dan Hugo, head of the Bay Area
Food Truck Association, said that
the Stanford community needs to
work together to change University
policy.
"People are not dissatisfied ac
tively enough in large enough num
bers," he said. "Maybe there's a uni
fying force behind Net Appetit."
Despite that apparent lack of
popular dissatisfaction, Vo is back
on campus and looking forward to
serving his regulars.
"More than anybody, I want this
to end in a happy way," Vo said.

The terms of Net Appetit's return, according to an email
from Assistant Vice President for Business Development
Susan Weinstein '72 MBA '79, stipulate that Chon Vo
Net Appetit's founder and operator must take orders
and payment off campus, prepare and package food off
campus and deliver each meal individually to each customer
in dorms or offices. If those conditions are not met, Net Ap-

Net Appetit will be allowed to return to Stanford if
founder Chon Vo abides by a series of stipulations, including
preparing and packaging food, taking orders
and accepting payment off-campus.
petit will be removed from campus
again.
The University's revised policy
for Net Appetit may be more strin
gent than its approach to other ven
dors. Delivery services like Domi
no's Pizza are paid in cash on cam
pus, while delivery companies often
cater large events without deliver
ing food individually to each cus
tomer.
Vo said he was unable to reach
Weinstein about operating Net Ap
petit as a delivery service, but AS
SU Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 acted
as a liaison between Vo along
with concerned students and We
instein
Bindra said that when he corre
sponded with Weinstein about re
branding Net Appetit as a delivery
service, she seemed receptive to
communication but inflexible about
the policy.
"I don't think she was fully able
to appreciate the sense of communi
ty that Vo had built," Bindra said.
"[She didn't believe] that it would
merit at least some sort of excep
tion."
Under the University's new
terms, Vo can continue to serve food
in his original location on Santa
Teresa Street. Now, however, cus
tomers have to place their orders
before coming to the track. In the
last week, campus police have visit
ed three times to check that all food
is being pre-ordered either by email
or text message.
Vo emphasized that he acknowl

edges the need for regulation
through a mobile food vendor policy,
but he framed some of the delivery
requirements sent to Bindra from
Weinstein as unreasonable. Howev
er, he expressed general satisfaction
with his accomplishments to date.
"[Net Appetit] lasted 10 times
longer than I expected, so if it goes
away now, personally, I will be total
ly satisfied because I have done my
job," Vo said.
Vo identified his primary rea
sons for fighting to stay on campus
as his customers and the charity
that receives Net Appetit's profits,
Aid to Children Without Parents, an
organization in Vietnam that feeds
orphans.
"I have a four-year old, and I
would never worry about her being
hungry in this country, but I worry
about her not having the right guid
ance in her education," Vo said
about the University's moves to re
move him from campus.
A petition in support of Net Ap
petit and other displaced mobile
food vendors, such as Mia's Cater
ing, has meanwhile continued to
gain signatures.
Bindra said that he signed the
petition because he disagreed with
the manner in which Net Appetit's
removal was handled, despite un
derstanding both the University's
position on the matter and Vo's per
spective.
"I'm slightly pessimistic about
[the petition] having any actual im
pact, but I do agree with the spirit of
it," he said. "I do agree that the Uni
versity shouldn't be taking super
staunch policies on things that neg
atively impact the community at
Stanford."
Amidst the ongoing uncertainty

involving food trucks on campus,
the Stanford Federalist Society
hosted a talk about food trucks and
economic liberty on Thursday, Feb.
21 at the Stanford Law School.
Lawyers and representatives of
various food vendor associations
spoke about food truck owners' eco
nomic rights to sell food and earn a
living.
However, Matt Geller, head of
the Southern California Mobile
Food Vendors Association, noted
that food trucks "basically have zero
rights" on a university campus.
"Stanford has the right and the
power to manage its own campus,
but beyond that, it should definitely
listen to what students have to say,"
said Bert Gall, director of the Insti
tute for Justice's National Street
Vending Initiative. "It sounds like
there's been some real backlash,
and people are going to miss the
trucks that can't be here anymore,
and Stanford probably should have
thought about that before contract
ing out to Off the Grid for the exclu
sive rights."
Dan Hugo, head of the Bay Area
Food Truck Association, said that
the Stanford community needs to
work together to change University
policy.
"People are not dissatisfied ac
tively enough in large enough num
bers," he said. "Maybe there's a uni
fying force behind Net Appetit."
Despite that apparent lack of
popular dissatisfaction, Vo is back
on campus and looking forward to
serving his regulars.
"More than anybody, I want this
to end in a happy way," Vo said.
