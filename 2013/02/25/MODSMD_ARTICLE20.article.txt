# Utah fends off tenacious Card
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
After falling to Utah by
0.200 points last year in the
regular season, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team
avenged their loss when it
mattered most, finishing just
ahead of the Utes in the
NCAA Championships to
win fourth place. So when
the Cardinal traveled to
Utah for Saturday's meet,
both teams had motivation to
try to come away with a win
in front of the crowd of over
13,000.

Heading into the meet,
Stanford knew it had a diffi
cult job ahead, as Utah has
been one of the nation's best
teams over the past few year's.
Senior captain Ashley Mor
gan, coming off a career-best
performance last week, was
"extremely confident" in her
team as long as it performed
up to its potential. The team
fell just short of that, posting
its second-best score of the
season, as Utah earned the
victory 197.300-197.075. It's
the second time in two weeks
that Stanford has scored in
the 1975, which it hadn't done
all season before last week.
Starting off on uneven
bars, the Card was led by
Morgan's 9.875, which was
good enough to earn her an
other individual title to add to
her many from this season.
However, after a very unusual
miss from sophomore Saman
tha Shapiro, who finished sec
ond in the country in last
year's NCAA Championship
in uneven bars, Stanford
looked to sophomore Alex
Archer to help get back on
track. Archer not only kept
the team in the meet with her
performance, but also tied her
career-high in the event with a
9.825.
That was probably the
most nervous I've ever been in
my career," said Archer. "It
felt unbelievable. Being on a
team of 15 strong, nothing can
truly describe the feeling of
having each other's backs."
The Cardinal came away
with a 49.050 score in the
event, while the Utes were
nearly perfect on vault, post

ing a 49.500 to give them an
early cushion.
Stanford had a lot of work
to do to make up its deficit,
and its strong vault perform
ance would be a good first
step. Stanford scored a
49.325, led by senior captain
Nicole Dayton, who tied her
career-high in the event with
a 9.950. Her score was good to
tie Utah's Tory Wilson for the
individual title in the event.
Dayton was supported by
Morgan and sophomore
Pauline Hanset, each of whom
scored a 9.875 in the event
(Hanset tied her career-high
in the event with that score).
Stanford's 49.325 was a sea
son-high for the team on vault,
and it helped reduce the
deficit to 98.750-98.375 head
ing into the third round.
Junior Shona Morgan
helped Stanford put together
a strong floor performance,
scoring a 9.900 in the event.
Shona Morgan's performance
helped to solidify her as one
the Card's more consistent
performers, posting a 9.800 or
higher in each of her three
events on the day. Ashley
Morgan and freshman Taylor
Rice each scored a 9.850 to
round out Stanford's score of
49.225. Stanford was now
down just 0.175 points head
ing into the final round, trying
to complete a furious come
back.

The Cardinal did just
about all it could to try to fin
ish off its unprecedented
comeback, scoring a season
high 49.475 on beams. Junior
Amanda Spinner scored a
9.950 to earn first in the event,
followed by a pair of 9.850's by
sophomores Ivana Hong and
Kristina Vaculik. Spinner and
Vaculik's scores were both ca
reer-highs for the two gym
nasts.
Unfortunately, Utah was
even better in its final event,
posting a 49.525 to wrap up
the final score. Utah's Lia Del
Priore produced a perfect per
formance on floor to help her
team finish off the Card, scor
ing a 10.000. Utah's final team
score of 197.300 was a season
best for the Utes, and it need
ed every bit of that to put
away the tenacious Cardinal
team.
Ashley Morgan earned an
other all-around title, her
fourth of the season, with a
score of 39.450. Vaculik, com
peting in her first all-around
competition of the season, fin
ished fourth with a score of
39.300. Stanford competes
next on Friday, March 1, as it
hosts California and Oregon
State at Burnham Pavilion in
the last home meet of the
season for the Cardinal.
