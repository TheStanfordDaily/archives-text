# STUDENT LIFE
## Administration supports taking leaves of absence 
### GRACE CHAO 
For Arthur Alvarez 'l3, 31, graduating from Stanford
this spring will have taken a little longer than four years.
Having first enrolled in 1999, Alvarez has left and re
turned to the University four times over 13 years. Al
though Stanford's leave-of-absence policy indicates that
students cannot request to leave for more than four quar
ters at a time and eight quarters total, Alvarez credited
Stanford for allowing him to continue and ultimately
complete his education.
"The reason why I've been able to come back [so many
times] is because the Stanford system has been one of sup
port and not of judgment," Alvarez said. "The university is
very flexible they'll work with you."
Though the Registrar precludes students who leave
Stanford for more than two years from subsequent enroll
ment, affected students can file a "Request to Return and
Register in Undergraduate Study" online. Students must
then consult with Undergrad
uate Advising and Research
(UAR) before being re-admit
ted to complete their under
graduate degrees.
"It's one of the qualities of
this institution," said Randy
Williams, associate dean of
UAR. "Once admitted, a re
quest to return to the Universi
ty is always a possibility."
According to University
statistics, 92 percent of the
Class of 2010 graduated with
in five years, and 95 percent
graduated within six. Even
then, however, 79 students did
not graduate within the ex
pected time frame.
Williams said that, because
students do not have to state
why they are planning a leave
of absence, the University
does not keep numbers re
garding the different reasons
that students offer. He said,
however, that personal strug
gles are the most common rea
son cited.
According to Director of
Residentially Based Advising
Kirsti Copeland, this category
includes issues related to fam
ily matters, a desire to trans
fer, academic difficulties and
mental or physical health
problems. She acknowledged
that, while the University
doesn't often create mental
health issues, it has issues
managing them.
"If [a student is] dealing
with mental health issues, the
stress with attending a place like
Stanford isn't helpful,"
Copeland said. "It can be a terri
ble place if you're feeling bad."
Robin Thomas, who en
rolled in 2008 after spending
a year doing community
service with AmeriCorps,
claimed that the University
doesn't focus enough on
teaching tangible skills to un
dergraduates. He said his
gap year was a "wake-up call,"
asserting that Stanford never
gave him the same learning
experience.
"I was just this little white
boy from Ohio. The other
workers all had street-smarts
and a common sense I couldn't
even dream of," he said. "It's
not like Stanford [lecture]
classes are bad, it's just not
right for some people. I [could]
take tests really well, but it
doesn't mean I was really
learning anything."
Thomas left Stanford his
junior year to join the Marine
Corps, believing it would pro
vide what he wanted a
great mental and physical
challenge.

A long journey back
A native of Fresno, Calif.,
Alvarez first left in the winter
of 2000 due to pre-existing
mental illness, then again in
the spring of 2002 because of
difficulties in balancing the
side effects of his medication
with academic requirements.
The second time, Alvarez filed
a Leave of Absence request
without a definite return date
and did not return until the fall
of 2005, after having worked
part-time and taken classes at
a community college.
"I needed to prove to my
self that I could be a student
again," he said.
Relationship and commut
ing issues he and his part
ner lived in San Mateo
caused him to file a Request to
Permanently Withdraw (RPW)
in 2007, and Alvarez left Stan
ford for a third time.
Yet requesting to perma
nently withdraw is an ex
tremely rare instance
Williams emphasized that the
appropriate form can only be
accessed through graduate
student pages and the term
"dropout" is not used within
the Stanford Administration.
"I think the term is anti
quated," Williams said. "I feel
like 30 or 40 years ago, it had a
cultural significance â€”to dis
engage from an establishment
...to rebel against a 'broken
system.' It was about not con
forming."
"But here, and so much
more often, it's about taking
advantage of something,"
Williams added. "It's more
about dropping into an obliga
tion a student might have.
Sometimes it's great to step
away from educational pur
suits, if there is a more imme
diate priority."
Williams himself has seen
fewer than 10 RPWs in 10
years, though that number
doesn't reflect the cumulative
experiences of UAR's other
advisors. Most students file
for a Leave of Absence first,
for which they must obtain
signatures from a UAR advi
sor and their Residence Dean.
Students must consult with
both advisors to discuss the
pros and cons of taking a
Leave of Absence, as well as
logistical details.
"We aren't putting up bar
riers to keep [students] from

leaving the university,"
Copeland said. 'A lot of uni
versities are worried about re
tention rates, but Stanford
does not have that problem."
"We want to support our
students' development so they
can be the students they want
to be when they return," she
added. "We have the freedom
to let students who do leave to
come back [at their own
pace]."
According to Alvarez,
Stanford has facilitated his
unique journey with all its ob
stacles.
"The complicated part is
figuring out your life," he said.
"The paperwork is straight
forward."
Alvarez will return in the
spring to finish one last course
before graduating with a B.A.
in English Literature.
Thomas, on the other hand,
has no plans to return.
He completed boot camp
but was discharged after be
ing diagnosed with major de
pressive disorder. It was a dif
ficult experience, he said, since
"there were so many others
who had more to become de
pressed about."
Today, Thomas runs a one
man company that sells
portable whiteboards he in
vented, called Noteboards.
The concept first came to him
as he prepared to hitchhike
back home from the Marines.
In less than one year he has
assembled and sold over
14,000 Noteboards.
Thomas said he might re
turn to Stanford, if it ever feels
like the right place to be, but
that at the present he is the
happiest he has been his "en
tire life."
In his farewell column
from The Daily, Thomas
praised the University for al
lowing him and others to find
then- own paths to success.
"Stanford makes [leaves of
absence] mind-blowingly easy
to do," he said. "I offer this as
evidence that our school really
does give a darn about us as
human beings. Against all tra
ditional business sense, Stan
ford lets its students take time
off to figure out who they are
and welcomes them back
whenever they're ready."

graduated within six. Even
then, however, 79 students did
not graduate within the ex
pected time frame.
Williams said that, because
students do not have to state
why they are planning a leave
of absence, the University
does not keep numbers re
garding the different reasons
that students offer. He said,
however, that personal strug
gles are the most common rea
son cited.
According to Director of
Residentially Based Advising
Kirsti Copeland, this category
includes issues related to fam
ily matters, a desire to trans
fer, academic difficulties and
mental or physical health
problems. She acknowledged
that, while the University
doesn't often create mental
health issues, it has issues
managing them.
"If [a student is] dealing
with mental health issues, the
stress with attending a place like
Stanford isn't helpful,"
Copeland said. "It can be a terri
ble place if you're feeling bad."
Robin Thomas, who en
rolled in 2008 after spending
a year doing community
service with AmeriCorps,
claimed that the University
doesn't focus enough on
teaching tangible skills to un
dergraduates. He said his
gap year was a "wake-up call,"
asserting that Stanford never
gave him the same learning
experience.
"I was just this little white
boy from Ohio. The other
workers all had street-smarts
and a common sense I couldn't
even dream of," he said. "It's
not like Stanford [lecture]
classes are bad, it's just not
right for some people. I [could]
take tests really well, but it
doesn't mean I was really
learning anything."
Thomas left Stanford his
junior year to join the Marine
Corps, believing it would pro
vide what he wanted a
great mental and physical
challenge.

A long journey back
A native of Fresno, Calif.,
Alvarez first left in the winter
of 2000 due to pre-existing
mental illness, then again in
the spring of 2002 because of
difficulties in balancing the
side effects of his medication
with academic requirements.
The second time, Alvarez filed
a Leave of Absence request
without a definite return date
and did not return until the fall
of 2005, after having worked
part-time and taken classes at
a community college.
"I needed to prove to my
self that I could be a student
again," he said.
Relationship and commut
ing issues he and his part
ner lived in San Mateo
caused him to file a Request to
Permanently Withdraw (RPW)
in 2007, and Alvarez left Stan
ford for a third time.
Yet requesting to perma
nently withdraw is an ex
tremely rare instance
Williams emphasized that the
appropriate form can only be
accessed through graduate
student pages and the term
"dropout" is not used within
the Stanford Administration.
"I think the term is anti
quated," Williams said. "I feel
like 30 or 40 years ago, it had a
cultural significance â€”to dis
engage from an establishment
...to rebel against a 'broken
system.' It was about not con
forming."
"But here, and so much
more often, it's about taking
advantage of something,"
Williams added. "It's more
about dropping into an obliga
tion a student might have.
Sometimes it's great to step
away from educational pur
suits, if there is a more imme
diate priority."
Williams himself has seen
fewer than 10 RPWs in 10
years, though that number
doesn't reflect the cumulative
experiences of UAR's other
advisors. Most students file
for a Leave of Absence first,
for which they must obtain
signatures from a UAR advi
sor and their Residence Dean.
Students must consult with
both advisors to discuss the
pros and cons of taking a
Leave of Absence, as well as
logistical details.
"We aren't putting up bar
riers to keep [students] from

leaving the university,"
Copeland said. 'A lot of uni
versities are worried about re
tention rates, but Stanford
does not have that problem."
"We want to support our
students' development so they
can be the students they want
to be when they return," she
added. "We have the freedom
to let students who do leave to
come back [at their own
pace]."
According to Alvarez,
Stanford has facilitated his
unique journey with all its ob
stacles.
"The complicated part is
figuring out your life," he said.
"The paperwork is straight
forward."
Alvarez will return in the
spring to finish one last course
before graduating with a B.A.
in English Literature.
Thomas, on the other hand,
has no plans to return.
He completed boot camp
but was discharged after be
ing diagnosed with major de
pressive disorder. It was a dif
ficult experience, he said, since
"there were so many others
who had more to become de
pressed about."
Today, Thomas runs a one
man company that sells
portable whiteboards he in
vented, called Noteboards.
The concept first came to him
as he prepared to hitchhike
back home from the Marines.
In less than one year he has
assembled and sold over
14,000 Noteboards.
Thomas said he might re
turn to Stanford, if it ever feels
like the right place to be, but
that at the present he is the
happiest he has been his "en
tire life."
In his farewell column
from The Daily, Thomas
praised the University for al
lowing him and others to find
then- own paths to success.
"Stanford makes [leaves of
absence] mind-blowingly easy
to do," he said. "I offer this as
evidence that our school really
does give a darn about us as
human beings. Against all tra
ditional business sense, Stan
ford lets its students take time
off to figure out who they are
and welcomes them back
whenever they're ready."

ARTHUR ALVAREZ 'l3
For Arthur Alvarez 'l3, 31, graduating from Stanford
this spring will have taken a little longer than four years.
Having first enrolled in 1999, Alvarez has left and re
turned to the University four times over 13 years. Al
though Stanford's leave-of-absence policy indicates that
students cannot request to leave for more than four quar
ters at a time and eight quarters total, Alvarez credited
Stanford for allowing him to continue and ultimately
complete his education.
"The reason why I've been able to come back [so many
times] is because the Stanford system has been one of sup
port and not of judgment," Alvarez said. "The university is
very flexible they'll work with you."
Though the Registrar precludes students who leave
Stanford for more than two years from subsequent enroll
ment, affected students can file a "Request to Return and
Register in Undergraduate Study" online. Students must
then consult with Undergrad
uate Advising and Research
(UAR) before being re-admit
ted to complete their under
graduate degrees.
"It's one of the qualities of
this institution," said Randy
Williams, associate dean of
UAR. "Once admitted, a re
quest to return to the Universi
ty is always a possibility."
According to University
statistics, 92 percent of the
