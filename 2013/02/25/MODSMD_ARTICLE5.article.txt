# STUDENT LIFE
## Record number attends Parents' Weekend 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A record number of people about
3,000 registered for this year's Par
ents' Weekend, including about 130
grandparents and 80 siblings. Among
them, over 90 percent of parents regis
tered online.
"We had a new platform since last
year, and we tried to update it a little bit
to help parents register," said Elaine
Enos, executive director of the Office of
Special Events and Protocol.
The University made special
arrangements over the weekend to ac

commodate the influx of people to cam
pus. Parking near Galvez Field was re
served for guest parking and additional
luncheons were offered at dining halls to
welcome visiting parents.
"So we have parking, registration,
food, we try to keep them kind of around
each other so that logistically it's not so
difficult for parents to get around for the
biggest events," Enos said.
Programming for parents featur
ing an expanded Resource Fair, a series
of Back to School classes, a guided tour
of the newly opened Bing Concert Hall
and a finale performance of Entertain
ment Extravaganza all aimed to help

them understand their children's school
life at the same time as they relive their
college experiences.
"Back to School" classes taught by
faculty were well attended throughout
the week.
"[l'm] very impressed by how he de
livered his points," said Richard Rabens,
a Class of 2013 parent about a foreign
policy class taught by Larry Diamond,
professor of political science. "In the
space of one hour, he touched on major
hotspots of American foreign policy and
the dilemma we faced in a very logical

and human manner."
"Parents' Weekend is designed
to expose parents to a wide range of
academic and scholarly work in
Stanford and subjects our faculty
are teaching about," Diamond said.
"So as a scholar in the Hoover Insti
tution, I thought it would be useful
to give parents a flavor of that when
I engage them during Parents'
Weekend."
Diamond found the lecturing ex
perience different from his regular
classes.
"The principle difference is that
it's really just a talk, a chance to in
teract," Diamond said. "I try to
avoid giving a formal lecture. I more
want to raise issues and put forward
perspectives for discussion."

Besides the lectures, over 1,000
parents attended the Resource Fair
at the Arrillaga Alumni Center. This
year, the fair was expanded to in
clude a variety of new community
programming, such as the LGBT
and Women's Community Centers.
"What we had was a core group
and what we want to involve is every
aspect of student life on campus, so
that parents can understand what
the students are doing," Enos said.
About 25 student and 130 par
ents volunteered during the week
end, performing tasks from work
ing at information desks to driving
golf cars around campus to trans
port parents with disabilities.
Hascal Humes, father of Maya
Humes 'l4, appreciated the chance
to see his daughter and meet other
parents.
"We think it's a wonderful expe
rience," Humes said. "It's good to
see what the kids are doing, to see
the campus to see what the activi

ties are and also to meet a lot of par
ents."
To conclude the weekend, par
ents were invited to attend Enter
tainment Extravaganza, an event
organized by the Stanford Parents'
Club as its largest annual fund-rais
ing effort. More than 1,500 tickets
were sold for the performance, with
all proceeds going to the Parents'
Club Scholarship Fund.
"We have just a great variety,"
said Elizabeth Stone, the show's di
rector. "We have classical music, we
have ethnic dance, contemporary
dancers and street dance and they
are all highly skilled performers."
Eight different open house tours
were provided on campus, including
two new destinations Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve, site of
the Searsville Dam, and the new
Bing Concert Hall.
