# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Few candidates declare for ASSU posts as deadline nears 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As the number of students seeking
elected office in the Associated Students
of Stanford University (ASSU) continues
to decline, current ASSU officers have ex
pressed concern about the trend's signifi
cance for the future of Stanford's student
government.
Only 16 students have declared their
intent to run for the Undergraduate Sen
ate (UGS), and none have declared intent
to run for the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) with just five days left before the
March 1 declaration deadline. One slate
has declared for senior class presidents,
and no slates have declared for any of the
other class president positions.
On Sunday evening, the first serious
slate, Billy Gallagher 'l4 and Dan Ashton
'l4, declared for the ASSU Executive.
Gallagher, a former Daily editor in
chief, said that he decided to run after
witnessing the strong reactions to
his farewell editorial and Miles

Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3's long-form arti
cle on Suites Dining. Gallagher said that,
if elected, he and Ashton would work on
making sure that the administration
takes student feedback seriously when
making decisions.
"There are so many people who
deeply care about Stanford and about the
community, but they don't necessarily
feel like they can make a big impact, or
they don't feel like administrators will lis
ten to them," Gallagher said. "I think
everybody saw that students are upset
and want to fight for things they care
about, but they don't know what's the
most effective way to have their voices
heard."
Though Gallagher is currently a Daily
staffer, he said he would give up the posi
tion if elected.
Lack of interest
