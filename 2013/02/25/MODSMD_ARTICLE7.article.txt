# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Few candidates declare for ASSU posts as deadline nears 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As the number of students seeking
elected office in the Associated Students
of Stanford University (ASSU) continues
to decline, current ASSU officers have ex
pressed concern about the trend's signifi
cance for the future of Stanford's student
government.
Only 16 students have declared their
intent to run for the Undergraduate Sen
ate (UGS), and none have declared intent
to run for the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) with just five days left before the
March 1 declaration deadline. One slate
has declared for senior class presidents,
and no slates have declared for any of the
other class president positions.
On Sunday evening, the first serious
slate, Billy Gallagher 'l4 and Dan Ashton
'l4, declared for the ASSU Executive.
Gallagher, a former Daily editor in
chief, said that he decided to run after
witnessing the strong reactions to
his farewell editorial and Miles

Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3's long-form arti
cle on Suites Dining. Gallagher said that,
if elected, he and Ashton would work on
making sure that the administration
takes student feedback seriously when
making decisions.
"There are so many people who
deeply care about Stanford and about the
community, but they don't necessarily
feel like they can make a big impact, or
they don't feel like administrators will lis
ten to them," Gallagher said. "I think
everybody saw that students are upset
and want to fight for things they care
about, but they don't know what's the
most effective way to have their voices
heard."
Though Gallagher is currently a Daily
staffer, he said he would give up the posi
tion if elected.
Lack of interest
This year's candidate numbers repre
sent a drastic decline from previous elec-
tion years. In 2008, there
were six Executive slates,
six class president slates, 39
Senate candidates and 19
GSC candidates.
Assistant ASSU Finan
cial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4, who
served as ASSU Elections
Commissioner in 2011, said
that the number of candi
dates running for office has
decreased every year during
his time at Stanford.
According to Trusheim,
campaigns have also become
less contentious, with the ex
ception of last year's Execu
tive race.
"For the most part, the
other campaigns are kind of
relaxed, and I think that's
probably a good thing," he
said. "It does show that per
haps there's not a lot of really
passionate, dedicated people
wanting to spend their time
on, let's say, the Senate ver
sus their own student organi
zations."
Trusheim said that low
candidate numbers pose a
particularly significant prob
lem for the GSC, even though
GSC candidates are not re
quired to collect petition sig
natures in order to run. Ac
cording to Elections Com
missioner Brianna Pang 'l3,
this policy was enacted to en
courage more graduate stu
dents to run for the GSC.
"I think [GSC members]
don't do a very good job of
reaching out to them popula
tions," Trusheim said. "If a
single candidate doesn't do a
good job but for some reason
there is no one else voted on
to the job at the GSC, they to
tally lose touch with that pop
ulation and it's a downward
spiral."
In the three ASSU elec
tions Trusheim has wit
nessed, there have never

been enough candidates to fill
the GSC. If too few candi
dates declare to run for the
GSC, current members can
suggest other students to fill
the position, and the GSC
votes whether or not to ac
cept the nomination.
Roshan Shankar M.S.'l3
M.EA. 'l4, the current GSC
secretary, said that last
year's elections were disap
pointingly uncompetitive,
particularly for the district
representative positions.
Shankar said that lower can
didate numbers have result
ed in less passionate cam
paigns and decreased visibili
ty for the GSC.
"For last year, if you con
tested and you were repre
senting a separate group, you
were basically guaranteed
your spot," he said. "When I
ran, no one did a campaign.
The slates were put up, we
had our statements and peo
ple who were interested
enough read it and voted for
you."
Shankar said that he was
also concerned with declining
voter turnout for GSC elec
tions. Only 1,047 graduate
students voted in last year's
election, a 29.1 percent de
cline from the 2011 voter
number and an almost 50
percent decrease from the
2,053 graduate students who
voted in 2010.
According to Shankar, the
GSC might attract fewer can
didates because graduate
students are more likely to
seek off-campus positions
and often have other priori
ties, such as doing research
or finishing a dissertation.
Shankar said that he believes
the Undergraduate Senate
has been more successful in
inspiring competitive elec
tions.
However, Senator Viraj
Bindra 'l5 said that he be
lieves low candidate numbers
are also a problem for the
Senate, adding that he would
have liked to see more candi
dates run for Senate last

year.
"If I'm being entirely hon
est, I would not have voted for
myself in my current form
back then, and I think a large
part of that is due to the fact
that there were not enough
serious and aware candidates
for Senate," Bindra said. 'A
lot of my platform, especially
in retrospect, was very buzz
worthy without a lot of sub
stance to it."
Bindra said that he be
lieves the Senate could bene
fit from candidates with
strong ideas and more expe
rience with the ASSU, and
said that the ideal Senate
would have five sophomores,
five juniors and five seniors.
"I do think that the ASSU
could be much stronger and
could operate much more ef
fectively if there were more
people running, if there was
more of a choice," he said. "I
would have liked to see a
stronger batch of candidates
run."
ASSU President Robbie
Zimbroff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and
Vice President William
Wagstaff 'l2 M.A.'l3 said
that they were not particular
ly concerned by lower voter
turnout, but were somewhat
troubled by decreasing can
didate numbers.
"At a certain point, you
have to get people to run,"
Zimbroff said. "If there are
eight Senate candidates and
one Exec slate, you would
like to have a bigger pool
than that."
Wagstaff agreed, adding
that he believes some poten
tial candidates are discour
aged from running because
they are not "student gov
ernment types."
"Being in this position
helped me realize that there
are different pockets on
campus, and people do dif
ferent things," he said. "As
long as you are a regular kid,
I think you can be helpful."
