# Q&A BRIANNA PANG ELECTIONS COMMISSIONER
## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As this year's ASSU elections
commissioner, Brianna Pang 'l3 is
responsible for coordinating the
elections for the ASSU Executive,
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate,
the Graduate Student Council,
class presidents and special fees
student groups.
All candidates must make decla
rations of intent and gather a set
amount of signatures —lOO for
Senate and 200 for Executive can
didates by March 1 at 5 p.m. The
Stanford Daily sat down with Pang
to discuss this year's elections,
which will be held on April 11 and
12.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
is your role as elections commis
sioner?
Brianna Pang (BP): As elections
commissioner, I handle everything
that is related to the ASSU spring
elections ... I basically run elections
and coordinate everything from
ballot initiatives to special fees
groups to candidates, whether that
is in the Execs, Senate, Graduate
Student Council or class presi
dents.
TSD: Do you have any early pre
dictions for what the elections
field will look like this year?
BP: I don't have any predictions
because I am actually supposed to
be completely hands off. I can en
courage students to run, but I can't
encourage individual people or sup
port any campaign... Right now, I
think about 10 people have de
clared for Senate, no one has de
clared for Exec and no one has de
clared for class presidents.
I held two candidate info ses
sions, and about 10 people were at
the first one and about five people
were at the second one. I think
most of the people at the info ses
sion were class president slates
who were interested, but other
than that I am not really sure.

TSD: Do you see any differences
between this year's elections and
previous elections?
BP: Nothing on the administra
tive side has changed ... There was
the addition of a couple of other
groups onto the ballot for special
fees. I am hoping that this year's
elections will be much cleaner than
last year because of the whole email
debacle, because this year I have
made it very clear to people what

the campaign rules are and that
everything needs to abide by the
Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard.
TSD: How would you character
ize voter turnout in previous
years, and do you have any partic
ular goals for voter turnout this
year?
BP: I'm definitely trying to
reach out more to grad students,
because historically the grad vote
has been 10w... In my ideal world, I
would want everyone to vote be
cause it is a fundamental right,
whether that is at the student level
or at the federal elections level. I
think everyone should exercise that
right to vote.
TSD: Are you expecting that
more declarations of intent will
come in within the next week,
and are you concerned that no
one has declared for Executives
or GSC?
BP: For Executives, the only
slate that I know of currently is the
Chapparal, the Chappie slate that
runs every year. It's kind of like a
joke slate. I'm not really sure what
would happen if no one runs for AS
SU Exec —it would be very un
precedented. Given the information
I have from previous years, people
don't usually declare until the last
week. We are also in the last week,
so it really depends on what hap
pens this weekend. I know that
people sometimes declare at the
last minute for GSC as we 11... I
think I would be concerned if it was
Feb. 28 today and there was no one
declared.

TSD: What are some key dates
for voters and candidates?
BP: March 1 is when the decla
rations of intent are due. That
means that by that date you have to
get the required amount of signa
tures, and for each position there
are different requirements. For
Undergraduate Senate, you need
100 petition signatures from the
undergraduate student population;
the Graduate Student Council
doesn't need petition signatures
but they still need to submit a dec
laration of intent; [and] the ASSU
Executive slate has to get 200 sig
natures ... There are various peti
tion guidelines, but everything is
due by March 1, so we're pretty
near the deadline.
