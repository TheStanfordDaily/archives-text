If you're a standout,
you'll fit right in.
Don't just communicate ideas—experience them.
Don't memorize a foreign language—think in one.
Don't study the ruins—excavate them.
Don't analyze dreams—live them.
This is the very essence of the University of Chicago Summer
Session. Where students are engaged at every level—intellectually,
socially, personally, and professionally. Where you can benefit
from the value of taking university courses in an accelerated,
intensive format. Join us this summer for an extraordinary learning
experience at the academic home to 85 Nobel laureates.
For students in high school, college, and beyond.
June 24-August 30, 2013, 3,4, 5, and 6-week sessions.
