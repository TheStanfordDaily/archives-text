## Eleven Card players score against Harvard 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Led by tough defense and a balanced attack
that was filing on all cylinders, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team defeated Harvard 18-13
on Sunday afternoon to earn its first win of the
2013 season.
Eleven different players scored for the Cardi
nal (1-1), led by sophomore attacker Kyle Eras
er's hat trick. Junior captain Anna Kim posted
two goals and three assists while junior Rachel
Ozer added a goal and three assists to give her a
team-leading nine points in two games.
"We have a lot of weapons," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker. "We always like to say
any seven players that are in the offensive [zone]
need to be threats to score, and they showed that
today."
The first half was a back-and-forth affair as

both teams show
cased their speed
and physicality. In
Harvard's first
game of the season,
freshman Alexis

Nicolia scored twice in the first three minutes to
open a 2-0 lead for the Crimson.
Stanford answered right back with goals from
Eraser and sophomore midfielder Meredith Kali
nowski, both of which were assisted by Kim, to
bring the teams even at two goals apiece five min
utes into the game.
The teams traded goals for the next fifteen
minutes before freshman midfielder Lucy
Dikeou, who had two goals and two assists on the
day, sliced through the Crimson defense to tie the
score at six. Dikeou's goal was the first of three
