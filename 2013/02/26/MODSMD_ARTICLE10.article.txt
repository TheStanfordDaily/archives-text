## Eleven Card players score against Harvard 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
Led by tough defense and a balanced attack
that was filing on all cylinders, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team defeated Harvard 18-13
on Sunday afternoon to earn its first win of the
2013 season.
Eleven different players scored for the Cardi
nal (1-1), led by sophomore attacker Kyle Eras
er's hat trick. Junior captain Anna Kim posted
two goals and three assists while junior Rachel
Ozer added a goal and three assists to give her a
team-leading nine points in two games.
"We have a lot of weapons," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker. "We always like to say
any seven players that are in the offensive [zone]
need to be threats to score, and they showed that
today."
The first half was a back-and-forth affair as

both teams show
cased their speed
and physicality. In
Harvard's first
game of the season,
freshman Alexis

Nicolia scored twice in the first three minutes to
open a 2-0 lead for the Crimson.
Stanford answered right back with goals from
Eraser and sophomore midfielder Meredith Kali
nowski, both of which were assisted by Kim, to
bring the teams even at two goals apiece five min
utes into the game.
The teams traded goals for the next fifteen
minutes before freshman midfielder Lucy
Dikeou, who had two goals and two assists on the
day, sliced through the Crimson defense to tie the
score at six. Dikeou's goal was the first of three

straight for Stanford, giving the
Card an 8-6 lead going into the half.
The streak continued after the
break, as Stanford scored four goals
in the opening eight minutes, broken
up by a single Crimson goal six min
utes into the half, to take a 12-7 lead.
"[Before the game], we really
talked about moving the ball on of
fense, giving ourselves opportuni
ties, good ball possession and ending
with good finishes," Bokker said. "I
thought we really used our speed.
We had a couple fast break opportu
nities — especially off the draw in

the second half that were great."
The teams played even for the
rest of the game, with Harvard nev
er narrowing the deficit to less than
four goals. After a streak of three
Harvard goals made the score 16-12
with four minutes remaining, Stan
ford freshman Mackenzie Tesei and
Julia Burns both finished break
away opportunities off the ensuing
draw controls to squash any hopes of
a Crimson comeback.
Burns, Tesei and fellow fresh
man Adrienne Anderson all scored
their first career goals on Sunday.
Bokker said that it was a positive
sign that so many of the young play
ers were scoring, especially against
a historically strong opponent like
the Crimson.
Stanford won 14 of 18 draw con

trols in the second half to sustain
possession. Whenever the Crimson
did gain the ball, the Cardinal used
full-field pressure to win it back
Stanford forced 20 Harvard
turnovers on the day.
Defensively, the Cardinal was led
by a huge day from junior Megan
Lerner. The defender made her pres
ence known with 8 draw controls, 3
ground balls, 1 caused turnover and
several strong efforts to shut down
Crimson fast breaks.
"[Meg] doesn't mind contact at all,
which is something that makes her
really good in ground ball situations,"
Bokker said. "She'll put her head and
body down and really make a com
mitment to come up with the ball."
Stanford goaltenders junior Lyn
dsey Munoz and freshman Katie
Wiseman combined for three saves
in the game. Munoz —who, along
with Kim, was recently named to the
Tewaarton Award watch list
played the majority of the game and
recorded one save. Wiseman made
her Cardinal debut with 10 minutes
remaining in the first half and re
turned for the final eight minutes of
the game.
Stanford now hits the road to
face Ohio State on March 2. Accord
ing to Bokker, the win over the
Crimson gives the Cardinal momen
tum going forward.
"Harvard is a good physical op
ponent," Bokker said. "I really was
impressed how our players held up
to that and took that physicality and
used it to our advantage."
