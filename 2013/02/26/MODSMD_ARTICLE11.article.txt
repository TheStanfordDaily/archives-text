## STREAK ON THE LINE 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a small stumble at Rice to begin the
season, the Cardinal baseball team seems to
have hit its stride. No. 14 Stanford (5-2) will
look to extend its current four-game winning
streak as it travels to Saint Mary's University
(4-3) for a non-conference game on Tuesday
afternoon.
"A sweep is huge, especially against Fresno
State, who has a lot of really great players on
that team," said second baseman Danny
Diekroeger, whose timely home run Sunday
night sealed the win for the Card. "Each game
was so close and could have gone either way. It
was huge for us to win a few close games, re
ally get that confidence, and hopefully we can
keep it rolling."
This will be the first of two non-conference
meetings between Stanford and Saint Mary's,
which went head-to-head three times last sea
son. The Cardinal outscored the Gaels 24-12
overall to earn victories in all three 2012
games.
During the season-opening three-game se
ries at Rice, Stanford suffered from a chronic
inability to come up with timely hits. In the
friendly confines of Sunken Diamond, an im
proved Stanford offense propelled the team to
wins by posting 22 runs over the four-game
homestand.
Stanford will need to continue to string to
gether hits in order to build off recent victo
ries and muscle past a scrappy Saint Mary's
team.
Sophomore Austin Slater figures to be a
huge factor in the continued success of the of
fense. Starting in the outfield in place of in
jured starter Austin Wilson, Slater has been
nothing less than a sparkplug in the heart of
Stanford's lineup.
After recording his first career hits in a
two-for-three effort against Cal on Wednes
day, Slater stayed hot through the three
games against Fresno State. The sophomore
banged out six hits over the weekend, includ
ing two doubles and a home run. He has now
collected multiple hits in each of his last four
games.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will try to keep its four-game
winning streak alive when it travels to Saint Mary's to
face the Gaels this afternoon. Last weekend,
Stanford's bats finally heated up to support the
pitching staff as the Cardinal earned three wins over
Fresno State. Cardinal sophomore Austin Slater
leads the team with a .421 batting average and
multiple hits in each of the past four games.
