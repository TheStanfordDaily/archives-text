## STREAK ON THE LINE 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a small stumble at Rice to begin the
season, the Cardinal baseball team seems to
have hit its stride. No. 14 Stanford (5-2) will
look to extend its current four-game winning
streak as it travels to Saint Mary's University
(4-3) for a non-conference game on Tuesday
afternoon.
"A sweep is huge, especially against Fresno
State, who has a lot of really great players on
that team," said second baseman Danny
Diekroeger, whose timely home run Sunday
night sealed the win for the Card. "Each game
was so close and could have gone either way. It
was huge for us to win a few close games, re
ally get that confidence, and hopefully we can
keep it rolling."
This will be the first of two non-conference
meetings between Stanford and Saint Mary's,
which went head-to-head three times last sea
son. The Cardinal outscored the Gaels 24-12
overall to earn victories in all three 2012
games.
During the season-opening three-game se
ries at Rice, Stanford suffered from a chronic
inability to come up with timely hits. In the
friendly confines of Sunken Diamond, an im
proved Stanford offense propelled the team to
wins by posting 22 runs over the four-game
homestand.
Stanford will need to continue to string to
gether hits in order to build off recent victo
ries and muscle past a scrappy Saint Mary's
team.
Sophomore Austin Slater figures to be a
huge factor in the continued success of the of
fense. Starting in the outfield in place of in
jured starter Austin Wilson, Slater has been
nothing less than a sparkplug in the heart of
Stanford's lineup.
After recording his first career hits in a
two-for-three effort against Cal on Wednes
day, Slater stayed hot through the three
games against Fresno State. The sophomore
banged out six hits over the weekend, includ
ing two doubles and a home run. He has now
collected multiple hits in each of his last four
games.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will try to keep its four-game
winning streak alive when it travels to Saint Mary's to
face the Gaels this afternoon. Last weekend,
Stanford's bats finally heated up to support the
pitching staff as the Cardinal earned three wins over
Fresno State. Cardinal sophomore Austin Slater
leads the team with a .421 batting average and
multiple hits in each of the past four games.

This strong showing has likely
earned a more consistent role in a
crowded lineup for Slater, who is
playing in the outfield despite be
ing an infielder by trade. Slater's
.421 batting average and .684 slug
ging percentage currently pace the
team on this young season.
Saint Mary's is also coming off
of a strong weekend in which it
rolled to a sweep of visiting Chica
go State. Its offense exploded for
25 runs over the three games, in
cluding an eight-run outburst in
the first inning on Sunday that led
to a 15-run victory.
Despite its explosiveness, the
Gaels' offense can be inconsistent
and has yet to be challenged by a
pitching staff as strong as that of
the Cardinal the Saint Mary's
hitters have put up big numbers
in games against Cal State
Northridge and Chicago State,
which are combined 4-9 this sea
son.
The Saint Mary's pitching staff

has been as inconsistent as the of
fense. The unit is coming off of its
most impressive pitching per
formance in recent memory, a
masterful no-hitter by Ryan
Brockett, who only walked two
and plunked one batter. However,
in its season-opening series
against Cal State Northridge, the
pitching staff gave up at least five
runs in each of the four games.
With a team ERA of 4.50 against
weaker offenses, the Gaels' pitch
ers will face their first true chal
lenge against a Stanford lineup
that has begun to find its stride.
Stanford pitchers have been
rock solid this year, dishing out
strong performances day in
and day out from both proven
veterans like Mark Appel and
also from its younger, less experi

enced faces.
The pitching corps boasts an
overall ERA of 2.03 and has
recorded 57 strikeouts against on
ly 15 walks so far this season.
They have yet to allow more than
five runs in a single game and
have done an impressive job of
limiting the damage done by op
posing teams when they are able
to get runners on base.
Senior right-hander Dean
McArdle is next in the rotation
and is expected to take the mound
again after hurling two strong in
nings against Cal during his last
outing. The Cardinal and Gaels
meet in Moraga, Calif., at 2 p.m. to
day.
