# Stevens pitches gem

Kelsey Stevens came within two outs of
perfection at the Stanford Nike Invitation
al last weekend. This time at the Mary
Nutter Collegiate Classic, Stevens would
not be denied. Stevens' perfect game on
Saturday night of the four-day tourna
ment was merely one of the numerous
standout performances from the No. 17
Stanford women's Softball, which won four
of five games in Cathedral City, California.

Playing against top-flight competition
at one of the premier tournaments in col
lege softball, the Cardinal (14-3) shined,
and perhaps no one shone brighter for
Stanford than Stevens.
Last week's Pac-12 Pitcher of the
Week, the freshman followed up her sen
sational weekend at the Nike Invitational
with an even better encore that was encap
sulated by her bout of perfection against
the University of Virginia. In recording
her first perfect game wearing a Cardinal
uniform, Stevens sent all 21 Cavalier bat
ters she faced back to the dugout empty
handed, including 10 on strikeouts.
"Kelsey was fantastic for us against
Virginia. She had all of her pitches working
and kept Virginia off balance," Stanford
head coach John Rittman told the Palo Al
to Online. "I am very happy for Kelsey and
excited about her performance."
In addition to her perfect game, for the
second weekend in a row, Stevens did not

allow an earned run while striking out 19
and notching victories against No. 13
Georgia, UVA, and No. 23 Florida State.
In the process, she lowered her ERA to
0.99.
Redshirt senior Sarah Hassman also
had a weekend to remember. In Friday's
matchup against Oklahoma State, which
Stanford lost 4-1, the centerfielder record
ed the 87th stolen base of her career to
break Jessica Mendoza 'o2's all-time
stolen base record.
After missing most of last season due
to an ACL injury, the 2011 NFCA First
Team All-West Region selection has re
turned to outstanding form in 2013. Over
the weekend, Hassman batted .412 while
driving in three runs. In Friday's contest
against Georgia, Hassman's three-run
home run in the top of the fifth inning gave
the Cardinal a 5-0 lead to break open the
game. Stanford would ultimately win 6-0.
Senior Teagan Gerhart turned in a
strong pitching performance to support
her freshman teammate. On Sunday, after
Stevens conceded back-to-back walks to
start the bottom of the sixth inning in a
tight 2-1 contest against Florida State,
Gerhart entered the game in relief and
coolly proceeded to snuff out any hope
that the Seminoles had of a comeback.
The senior retired the first three Flori
da State hitters she faced on a flyout to
third, a strikeout and a groundout to first
base. Gerhart finished off the six-out save
with a nearly perfect seventh inning, al
lowing only one base runner on a hit-by
pitch, to give Stanford the 3-1 win.
Later that afternoon, Gerhart contin
ued her domination of opposing hitters by
