## LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
### 
Dear Editor,
I am sure you guys out west run a
fine publication I have many
friends young and old that at
tended Stanford over the years, and
I think very highly of the Universi
ty.

I'm sure my opinion means little
coming from a former Texas A&M
student, class of 1993, but young
Sam Fisher's column criticizing a
young student athlete like Johnny
Manziel (Stanford athletes are stu
dents first, Feb. 22) is unfair and be
neath Stanford's fine reputation. To
suggest that Sam, The Stanford
Daily or anybody else for that mat
ter has an ideal understanding of
another student athlete's situation
is absurd.
I'm not going to defend or pro
mote what's happening at Texas
A&M when it comes to the 'han
dling' of Johnny, but I'm confident
the University, the coaching staff,
his parents and those closest to him
are doing what's in the best interest
of all the parties involved.
To draw any comparison be
tween [Stanford quarterback] An
drew Luck'l2 and Johnny and his

situation lacks judgment. Luck did
n't win the Heisman Trophy, John
ny did, as a freshman. Since this
was a year of transition and firsts
for Texas A&M, I would encourage
you and your paper to be a little
more thoughtful and respectful of
another AAU University that has
earned and fought for everything
we have.
If Sam Fisher or anybody else
on the Stanford campus wants to
understand what's really happening
and why, perhaps you should do
some investigative work before
simply reacting to the fact that
Johnny Manziel is taking some on
line courses.
And I think it's magnificent and
extraordinary that Stanford, a fine
academic and athletic institution,
can compete with SEC and Big 12
opponents on the field. Stanford
should celebrate that fact with
class, rather than attacking another
University or a young student ath
lete like Johnny Manziel.

Respectfully,
