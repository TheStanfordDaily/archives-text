## An Open Letter to Suites Residents and Stanford Students 
### NATE BOSWELL '99 M.A. '09 Associate Dean, Residential Education 
We appreciate the passions
expressed these past few
days about the future of the
Governor's Corner Dining Societies
(GCDS) that serve the 250 residents
of the Suites. It is clear that stu
dents care deeply about the chefs in
the Suites, and that even more of
you are passionate about preserving
student management and independ
ence in operating the dining soci
eties and elsewhere on campus.
Having worked with student man
agement for the better part of a
decade, that is music to my ears.
While I spoke to some students
yesterday afternoon, many of those
in attendance were frustrated by my
answers. Many were also thoughtful
and reflective and stayed to speak
with me about the realities of oper
ating student management in a
large, complex University system.
For those of you who weren't
there, I wanted to provide the facts
of the matter and explain the dilem
ma of the University as it relates to
the GCDS. And in full disclosure, I
was a resident of the Suites and as
chef Tony suggested yesterday, I en
joyed and benefited from the dining
societies myself. I understand what
students are seeking to preserve

\

but given contemporary challenges
we cannot simply say 'it worked well
for thirty years, leave us alone we
don't want to change it.'
I say this because the University
is operating within many new reali
ties, including an increasingly liti
gious society and increasing legisla
tion, regulations and mandates. All
the while, the service expectations
of our students and parents are also
increasing. And our responsibilities
to maintain health and safety, and to
assure financial accountability, re
main.
In Residential Education we
work very hard to support Stan
ford's long-time tradition of provid
ing students with management
learning experiences and decision
making autonomy even when the
model isn't the most efficient or cost
effective. It is, however, more and
more difficult for anye ntities to op
erate independently on campus
without more university oversight
and controls.
In the case of the Suites, the cur
rent student-management model op
erating the GCDS has faced difficul
ty. While more recently student lead
ership of the GCDS has worked hard
to enact University recommenda-

tions stemming from an internal au
dit that took place three years ago,
when we initially outlined our con
cerns we felt the refrain was over
whelmingly 'just leave us alone, it
works fine the way it is.'
Yesterday many students ex
pressed frustration that it takes a
protest or a petition to get the ad
ministration to listen or to prompt
compromise, but it works the other
way around too. As I said to Miles
[Unterreiner] after the rally, we
have worked with GCDS manage
ment for the last two years trying to
address legitimate concerns outlined
in that University audit, and when
students come to the table with
'leave us alone,' it's hard to make
progress.
We have come a long way but it

has not been easy. Many of you
asked for the truth. The truth is the
University is currently defending
three lawsuits related to the dining
societies. Additionally, as ResEd has
worked to incorporate a structure
that meets University expectations
while preserving student manage
ment we also have had to lend funds
to the GCDS in order for them to be
solvent and make payroll.
Its student managers have been
reticent to discuss real strategies to
reduce costs and to ask beloved
chefs difficult questions about their
compensation packages, compensa
tion that was set at time when the
GCDS did not have to respond to the
trend in litigiousness I reference
above.
We understand that GCDS wants
to pay their chefs well, but the cur
rent Suites food service model is ex
pensive to operate more expen
sive by $6OO-per-student-per-year
than what students in most resi
dences pay for board. Causing fur
ther concern is that the University
has to provide a greater subsidy to
Suites students who receive finan
cial aid.
These are just some of the com
plications that ResEd and the Gov
ernor's Corner Dining Society stu
dent managers have been working
to try to overcome during the past
two years. We haven't found a work
able long-term solution but, as I also
told Miles [Unterreiner] yesterday,
I think we might be closer than we
both thought.
We would also like to state that of
the various conspiracy theories cir
culating about the rationale for
changes, none are true. Our dilem
ma is simply a matter of balancing
students' desire for independence
with the University's obligations to
mitigate risk for all concerned and
to be accountable for the money
paid by families and through finan
cial aid.
We do not believe we have been
acting in error in our attempts to ad

dress the aforementioned issues,
but you're right â€”we need to be
able to state clearly where the con
cerns are and provide examples not
just to GCDS leadership but to
Suites residents as well.
We want the most robust, re
warding and well-run system possi
ble, and we welcome recommenda
tions from the Suites residents
about the best way to preserve as
much of the independent model as
possible, while meeting the modern
day requirements of our legal, struc
tural and financial realities.
The current GCDS managers
have not expressed confidence that
it can be done in the short term. But
there are student-management
models on campus such as Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE), in
which students make independent
management decisions, but are also
accountable to an advisory board of
University staff and officials. Per
haps there are best practices from
SSE that can be adopted for the
Suites. Or maybe something com
pletely new.
We want to be clear that we do
want the Suites experience to be a
successful and rewarding one. We
are optimistic about the possibilities
if students are willing to hear all
sides of the argument and collabo
rate with us to address tough ques
tions.
Moving forward, we look for
ward to working together to pre
serve as many learning opportuni
ties and experiences for student
management as possible, while still
meeting our responsibilities to all
students and abiding by the rules of
a host of regulatory entities. And all
while not exposing the University
or its student managers to unnec
essary risk.
Thank you for your ongoing in
terest and passion to be involved in
finding a solution.
