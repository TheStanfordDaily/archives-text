# ATCHOO SETS MILE RECORD
## 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford junior Michael Atchoo set a new school
and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
record in the mile to lead the Cardinal men's track and
field team to a fifth-place finish at the MPSF champi
onships. The women finished fourth.
Atchoo's time of 3:57.14 beat the indoor school record
previously held by Olympian Michael Stember 'OO.
Olympian Jeff Atkinson 'B6 holds the all-time record
with a 3.55.16 run during the 1986 outdoor season.

"Michael is running with the assertiveness of one of
the best guys in the country," Stanford head coach
Chris Miltenberg told GoStanford.com. "We're prepar
ing him to peak in the outdoor season, so we haven't
done a lot of speed work. Michael is doing all this stuff
off strength."
Cardinal senior Tyler Stutzman also turned in the
No. 7 indoor time in Stanford history in the mile to give
Stanford a 1-2 sweep in the event. Although Stutzman
has battled injury to his knees in recent months, he
was able to surge from last place early in the race to
take second.
"The guy is extremely tough and competitive," Mil
tenberg said of Stutzman. "Even though he was in the
back, he kept his head in the race."
In the 5,000-meter run, Erik Olson took second with
a time of 13:55.66. The junior also took sixth in the
3,000-meter run. Freshman Justin Brinkley also
earned fifth in the 800-meter run with a season-best of
1:51.22.
High-jumper Jules Sharpe and shot-putter Geof
frey Tabor fought off strong fields to earn third-place
finishes at the meet. Sharpe jumped 2.21 meters while
Tabor threw 17.68 meters.
"It was a tough field [of competitors], but my train
ing has definitely paid off and will continue to pay off in
outdoor," Tabor said.
The Stanford women's team had a few upsets and a
few surprises. Junior Kori Carter, the defending cham
pion in the 60-meter hurdle, was forced to surrender
her title to Brea Buchanan of UCLA, after she finished
in fifth place.
Katie Nelms, who holds the record for the second
fastest indoor hurdle time in Stanford history behind
Carter, finished third in the hurdles.
Carter has more success earlier in the meet when
she recorded a dramatic first place finish in the 200-
meter race. Carter and teammate Carissa Levingston
repeated the 1-2 finish of Atchoo and Stutzman with
their remarkable times of 23.63 and 24.24 seconds.
"The plan for both was to get out hard and maintain
for 150. Stay strong, and pump your arms all the way
through," Stanford sprints and hurdles coach Jody
Stewart told GoStanford.com. "I was confident Kori
would do well. She's very talented, she works hard, is
consistent and she executes."
The MPSF Championships also marked the highly
anticipated return of seven-time Ail-American Kathy
Kroeger in the 5,000 meter. Kroeger, for her first race
this year, impressively finished second with a time of
16:00.29.
In addition, Stanford senior Jordan Merback and
freshman Amy Weissenbach both earned runner-up
finishes in the triple jump and the 800-meter race re
spectively.
The Cardinal also took second in the distance med
ley relay, making up for the men, who gave up an early
lead to UCLA and finished fourth in the same event.
Stanford now has one final qualifier this Friday be
fore turning its focus to the NCAA Championship on
March 8 and 9.
