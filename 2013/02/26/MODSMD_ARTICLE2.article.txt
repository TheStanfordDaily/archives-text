## Narcolepsy center studies rare condition Stanford researchers explore causes, symptoms of steep disorder

Imagine waking up one morning to the sounds
of a burglar rustling at your doorknob. As the
door creaks open, however, you are unable to
move confined to your bed.
Moments later, you realize the burglar was
just a hallucination and your movement is re
stored. It was only a dream.
These two conditions hypnagogic halluci
nations, which occur when waking up or falling
asleep, and cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle
tone often accompanying strong emotion are
characteristics of the sleep disorder narcolepsy, a
disease that affects nearly one in 2000 Ameri
cans.
"Some people have one attack a month, one
cataplexy, a little bit of nightmares, but they're
okay," said Emmanuel Mignot, director of the
Stanford Center for Narcolepsy, part of the
School of Medicine. "Others have it really bad."
Mignot is widely recognized as the interna
tional expert on the disorder, having discovered
its genetic cause.
In addition to hallucinations and cataplexy,
victims of narcolepsy can also suffer from exces
sive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and sleep paraly
sis. Much of Mignot's research is dedicated to find
ing both effective treatment for these symptoms
and, eventually, a cure for the condition itself.
"[Narcolepsy is] little bits of REM sleep
mixed with the waking world, which isn't sup
posed to be possible... It's a normal thing hap
pening at an abnormal time," said Mali Einen, a
research coordinator at the center.
With his team of researchers, Mignot con
ducts tests on individuals who think they might
have narcolepsy, which he said often goes undiag
nosed.
"The worst thing is not knowing [if you have
it], because the treatment can be really very ef
fective," he said.
