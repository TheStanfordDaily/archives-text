## Narcolepsy center studies rare condition Stanford researchers explore causes, symptoms of steep disorder 
### NITHYA VIJAYAKUMAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine waking up one morning to the sounds
of a burglar rustling at your doorknob. As the
door creaks open, however, you are unable to
move confined to your bed.
Moments later, you realize the burglar was
just a hallucination and your movement is re
stored. It was only a dream.
These two conditions hypnagogic halluci
nations, which occur when waking up or falling
asleep, and cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle
tone often accompanying strong emotion are
characteristics of the sleep disorder narcolepsy, a
disease that affects nearly one in 2000 Ameri
cans.
"Some people have one attack a month, one
cataplexy, a little bit of nightmares, but they're
okay," said Emmanuel Mignot, director of the
Stanford Center for Narcolepsy, part of the
School of Medicine. "Others have it really bad."
Mignot is widely recognized as the interna
tional expert on the disorder, having discovered
its genetic cause.
In addition to hallucinations and cataplexy,
victims of narcolepsy can also suffer from exces
sive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and sleep paraly
sis. Much of Mignot's research is dedicated to find
ing both effective treatment for these symptoms
and, eventually, a cure for the condition itself.
"[Narcolepsy is] little bits of REM sleep
mixed with the waking world, which isn't sup
posed to be possible... It's a normal thing hap
pening at an abnormal time," said Mali Einen, a
research coordinator at the center.
With his team of researchers, Mignot con
ducts tests on individuals who think they might
have narcolepsy, which he said often goes undiag
nosed.
"The worst thing is not knowing [if you have
it], because the treatment can be really very ef
fective," he said.
According to Mignot, the disor
der's symptoms most often mani
fest themselves immediately before
falling asleep or soon after waking.
The daytime sleepiness can often
persist throughout the day, and pas
sive activities such as watching a
movie or listening to lecture can
cause one to doze off.
Einen said that such chronic
symptoms can seriously impede a
sufferer's day-to-day life.
"In humans, cataplexy is most
commonly triggered by humor,
finding something amusing or do
ing well at something," Einen said.
"That part of it is kind of sad. Every
time you say something funny or
hear something funny, you have this
sudden loss of muscle tone. It pre
vents you from being the person
you were meant to be."
During a narcolepsy diagnosis,
Mignot and his team use a variety

of tests to determine how intense
the symptoms are and thus how se
vere the condition is.

One such diagnostic measure
ment is the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale, a survey in which people rate
how likely they are to fall asleep
during specific situations.
"Some things on the Epworth
sleepiness scale are sitting and
reading, watching T.V, sitting inac
tive in a public place say a the
ater or a meeting," Einen said.
"Those things are all super hard for
a person with narcolepsy to stay
awake in."
Research to understand nar
colepsy was first conducted at the
Stanford Narcolepsy Center with
help from a breed of genetically
narcoleptic dogs. Studying the
dogs helped researchers under
stand the symptoms of the disor
der and led to the center's major
breakthrough in 1999.
By analyzing the spinal cord
fluid of the dogs, it was found that
narcoleptic individuals lack
hypocretin, a chemical produced
by specialized cells in the hypothal

amus of the brain. As a result, they
are unable to regulate REM sleep.
Mignot said that while many in
the scientific community remain
skeptical about narcolepsy, his re
search proved there was a biologi
cal cause for the disorder.
Furthermore, the center also
discovered that 25 percent of the
population carries a genetic mark
er for narcolepsy, signifying genet
ic susceptibility. However, only 0.02
percent of that population experi
ences narcoleptic symptoms.
"The [genetic] marker doesn't
mean you're going to get narcolep
sy, but it makes it possible," Einen
said. "It is one piece of the puzzle,
and they are trying to figure out
what are the other pieces."
Current research has focused
on understanding what factors
trigger narcolepsy among the sus
ceptible population.
Mignot recently found that the
T-cells in narcoleptic individuals'
immune systems may play a part
in killing these depleted hypocre
tin cells.
After the global swine flu epi

demic of 2009, Mignot noted that
there has been a global increase in
the incidence of narcolepsy among
young people. The HINI vaccine
Pandemrix, distributed in some
parts of Europe, has recently re
ceived significant media attention
after studies demonstrated that it
increased the risk for developing
narcolepsy.
However, this increased inci
dence of narcolepsy has also affect
ed populations in both China and
the United States, where this vac
cine was not administered.
"We think it may be the T-cells,
which have the dirty job of fighting
the HINI, and then [make] the
mistake of killing hypocretin cells,"
Mignot said. "Even with this Pan
demrix, it should be noted that only
one person for 16,000 developed
narcolepsy. So ... the risk of devel
oping narcolepsy is still very low. So
it's a rare complication. It doesn't
mean that you should not get vacci
nated. "
The center conducts research
using blood samples and brain do
nations from around the world.

Most of the narcoleptic dogs used in
earlier studies have passed on from
old age, but Mignot adopted the last
surviving dog, Bear.
"I'm sure a lot of people have
seen us on campus," he said.
Researchers at the center col
laborate with other scientists inter
nationally to study the blood sam
ples of those with narcolepsy and
identify which immune responses
may lead to the disorder. Although
treatments exist, they often only
address symptoms.
"It is a bit like taking aspirin for
a fever," Mignot said. "They either
really wake you up or make you go
to sleep more deeply. It doesn't feel
very natural."
Mignot plans to continue study
ing T-cells in order to determine ex
actly what triggers the autoimmune
response against hypocretin cells.
"I think what's most exciting
about this work is that we may one
day be able to prevent narcolepsy,"
he said.

demic of 2009, Mignot noted that
there has been a global increase in
the incidence of narcolepsy among
young people. The HINI vaccine
Pandemrix, distributed in some
parts of Europe, has recently re
ceived significant media attention
after studies demonstrated that it
increased the risk for developing
narcolepsy.
However, this increased inci
dence of narcolepsy has also affect
ed populations in both China and
the United States, where this vac
cine was not administered.
"We think it may be the T-cells,
which have the dirty job of fighting
the HINI, and then [make] the
mistake of killing hypocretin cells,"
Mignot said. "Even with this Pan
demrix, it should be noted that only
one person for 16,000 developed
narcolepsy. So ... the risk of devel
oping narcolepsy is still very low. So
it's a rare complication. It doesn't
mean that you should not get vacci
nated. "
The center conducts research
using blood samples and brain do
nations from around the world.

Most of the narcoleptic dogs used in
earlier studies have passed on from
old age, but Mignot adopted the last
surviving dog, Bear.
"I'm sure a lot of people have
seen us on campus," he said.
Researchers at the center col
laborate with other scientists inter
nationally to study the blood sam
ples of those with narcolepsy and
identify which immune responses
may lead to the disorder. Although
treatments exist, they often only
address symptoms.
"It is a bit like taking aspirin for
a fever," Mignot said. "They either
really wake you up or make you go
to sleep more deeply. It doesn't feel
very natural."
Mignot plans to continue study
ing T-cells in order to determine ex
actly what triggers the autoimmune
response against hypocretin cells.
"I think what's most exciting
about this work is that we may one
day be able to prevent narcolepsy,"
he said.

Imagine waking up one morning to the sounds
of a burglar rustling at your doorknob. As the
door creaks open, however, you are unable to
move confined to your bed.
Moments later, you realize the burglar was
just a hallucination and your movement is re
stored. It was only a dream.
These two conditions hypnagogic halluci
nations, which occur when waking up or falling
asleep, and cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle
tone often accompanying strong emotion are
characteristics of the sleep disorder narcolepsy, a
disease that affects nearly one in 2000 Ameri
cans.
"Some people have one attack a month, one
cataplexy, a little bit of nightmares, but they're
okay," said Emmanuel Mignot, director of the
Stanford Center for Narcolepsy, part of the
School of Medicine. "Others have it really bad."
Mignot is widely recognized as the interna
tional expert on the disorder, having discovered
its genetic cause.
In addition to hallucinations and cataplexy,
victims of narcolepsy can also suffer from exces
sive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and sleep paraly
sis. Much of Mignot's research is dedicated to find
ing both effective treatment for these symptoms
and, eventually, a cure for the condition itself.
"[Narcolepsy is] little bits of REM sleep
mixed with the waking world, which isn't sup
posed to be possible... It's a normal thing hap
pening at an abnormal time," said Mali Einen, a
research coordinator at the center.
With his team of researchers, Mignot con
ducts tests on individuals who think they might
have narcolepsy, which he said often goes undiag
nosed.
"The worst thing is not knowing [if you have
it], because the treatment can be really very ef
fective," he said.
According to Mignot, the disor
der's symptoms most often mani
fest themselves immediately before
falling asleep or soon after waking.
The daytime sleepiness can often
persist throughout the day, and pas
sive activities such as watching a
movie or listening to lecture can
cause one to doze off.
Einen said that such chronic
symptoms can seriously impede a
sufferer's day-to-day life.
"In humans, cataplexy is most
commonly triggered by humor,
finding something amusing or do
ing well at something," Einen said.
"That part of it is kind of sad. Every
time you say something funny or
hear something funny, you have this
sudden loss of muscle tone. It pre
vents you from being the person
you were meant to be."
During a narcolepsy diagnosis,
Mignot and his team use a variety

of tests to determine how intense
the symptoms are and thus how se
vere the condition is.

One such diagnostic measure
ment is the Epworth Sleepiness
Scale, a survey in which people rate
how likely they are to fall asleep
during specific situations.
"Some things on the Epworth
sleepiness scale are sitting and
reading, watching T.V, sitting inac
tive in a public place say a the
ater or a meeting," Einen said.
"Those things are all super hard for
a person with narcolepsy to stay
awake in."
Research to understand nar
colepsy was first conducted at the
Stanford Narcolepsy Center with
help from a breed of genetically
narcoleptic dogs. Studying the
dogs helped researchers under
stand the symptoms of the disor
der and led to the center's major
breakthrough in 1999.
By analyzing the spinal cord
fluid of the dogs, it was found that
narcoleptic individuals lack
hypocretin, a chemical produced
by specialized cells in the hypothal

amus of the brain. As a result, they
are unable to regulate REM sleep.
Mignot said that while many in
the scientific community remain
skeptical about narcolepsy, his re
search proved there was a biologi
cal cause for the disorder.
Furthermore, the center also
discovered that 25 percent of the
population carries a genetic mark
er for narcolepsy, signifying genet
ic susceptibility. However, only 0.02
percent of that population experi
ences narcoleptic symptoms.
"The [genetic] marker doesn't
mean you're going to get narcolep
sy, but it makes it possible," Einen
said. "It is one piece of the puzzle,
and they are trying to figure out
what are the other pieces."
Current research has focused
on understanding what factors
trigger narcolepsy among the sus
ceptible population.
Mignot recently found that the
T-cells in narcoleptic individuals'
immune systems may play a part
in killing these depleted hypocre
tin cells.
