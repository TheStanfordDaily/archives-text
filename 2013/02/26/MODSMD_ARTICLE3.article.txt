# Students protest for Suites
## Over 120 gather to support Suites Eating Clubs' student management, chefs 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
More than 120 Stanford students gath
ered in the middle of White Plaza on Monday
afternoon to protest the University's recent
decision to end student management at
Suites Eating Clubs.
The move to contract the operations of
Suites Dining to an outside vendor, which
was announced by Residential Education
(ResEd) at the end of January, has been
widely derided by the Stanford community
as symptomatic of the University's corpora
tization and representative of an increasing
encroachment upon student autonomy
Students who showed up at the protest
said the event stemmed from frustration
over a series of University decisions
which they felt had been made without seri
ous consultation from the community mem
bers that would subsequently be affected
made over the past three years.
These include the University's decisions
to revoke the lease of the student-run Chi
Theta Chi last February, to launch a $5.5 mil
lion project to install of card readers on Row
houses last fall and to establish a new food
vendor policy that has driven popular food

trucks off campus this winter.
"There is a common theme of [the] Uni
versity administration not consulting with
the student body while drafting these deci
sions, instead implementing these decisions
and then announcing them to the masses
through email," said event organizer
Ma'ayan Dembo 'l4, speaking through a
loud speaker while standing on the stage
outside of Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "It is our
right as paying students and adults to have a
voice on these reforms and demand more
transparency from the administration."
The statement received one of the largest
rounds of applause of the day from the audi
ence. A few of its members waved signs and
banners with slogans like "Stop stanford"
and "Goodbye wind of freedom, Hello stan
ford Housing."

Students seeking a voice
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a Daily
staffer, has been credited for helping such is
sues gain traction among the student body,
and his long-form article about the end of
Suites Daring's student management has
prompted extensive reader response since
its publication last week. As of Monday
night, the first page of the online article has

received more than 2,500 Facebook likes and
16,400 unique page views, making it the fifth
most-read story on the Daily's website since
the 2008-09 academic year.
The article was part investigative jour
nalism, examining the rationales put for
ward by ResEd as justifying ending student
management at Suites Dining, and part per
sonal narrative, exploring Unterreiner's
own experience working as a hasher at
Suites and his interactions with its chefs,
particularly Bollard Eating Club head chef
Frank Hassan.
Speaking to The Daily the night before
the protest, Dembo, who is neither a Suites
nor XOX resident, said that it was this arti
cle that inspired her to take action.
"I was reading through the article, and at
the end, it said something like, 'lt's time to
take action,' and I realized, 'Yeah, we
should,"' Dembo said. "I was talking about it
with my friends all weekend, kind of expect
ing and waiting for something to happen,
and then I finally decided that maybe I
should be the one to take action instead."
According to Dembo, she sent out an
email to 12 of her friends Sunday afternoon,

Students gathered in the middle of White Plaza to protest the University's decision to end student management of Suites Eating
Clubs on Monday. Event organizer Ma'ayan Dembo '14 said she had expected just 30 to 50 students to show up for the event.
with the intention of collectively
walking into the ResEd office and
attempting to have a conversation
with administrators. The email,
however, was quickly forwarded to
several large student mailing lists.
Even so, as of Sunday night, Dembo
still predicted that approximately 30
to 50 students would turn up.
"I was not expecting this many
people to show up," Unterreiner
agreed after the event. "We didn't
even get the Facebook page up until
yesterday evening. I was a little wor
ried that there hadn't been enough
publicity and enough people wouldn't
show up, so I think the fact that on
one night's notice you can have over
100 people show up to White Plaza
... I think it just shows how deep the
discontent runs and just how power
ful students feel about this. That
was encouraging to me."
Unterreiner helped to publicize
the event to students on Facebook
since Dembo did not initially have
an account on the social networking
site. He also spoke at the protest.
"ResEd is interested in eliminat
ing a non-profit organization and re
place it with a for-profit corpora
tion," he told to the crowd. "It makes
no economic, moral or ethical sense.
We are here because ResEd is cor
poratizing student dining at the ex
pense of students like you guys."
According to Unterreiner, one of

the most positive aspects of the
protest was providing the chefs
from the Suites Dining Clubs
whose contracts, as of now, will not
be renewed next year an oppor
tunity to voice their opinions. The
audience broke out into applause
when Hassan and Avanti chef Anton
"Tony" Dietz showed up in White
Plaza.
"It would be nice to know what
exactly is the mission of Residential
Education," Dietz said on stage. "I
would think their capacity is one
where they are advisors [to] stu
dents, not to be an organization that
dismantles your dining societies."
Instead of marching to the
ResEd Central Office in Tresidder
Union as initially planned, the pro
testers ended up being able to ask
questions of Nate Boswell '99 M.A.
'O9, associate dean of ResEd, who
had showed up on the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium prior to the
event.
"He said he's here to listen, so
I'm really hoping that he is here to
listen and dialogue," said Erika
Kreeger 'l5, a student protester,
when news first spread among the
crowd that Boswell had made an ap
pearance at the event.
Boswell introduced himself as a
Stanford alumnus who had been a
member of the Avanti Dining Socie
ty himself during his time here.
"I think that in the long run we
will have to be able to sit down with
a representative group, not just the
Governor's Corner Dining Society,
perhaps the ASSU or you guys here
today to talk through those things a

little bit more," Boswell said.
Overall, Boswell appeared com
fortable and willing to engage with
protestors, although students in the
crowd criticized him of saying little
of substance.

At one point, Boswell said, "Let
me say that I think ResEd is a
nexus point for University commu
nication." He quickly followed up
with, "What does that mean?" which
resulted in an outburst of laughter
from the audience. One male stu
dent exclaimed loudly, "Bullshit!"
Throughout the event, Unter
reiner pressed Boswell with the
question, "How does this make stu
dent life better?" when Boswell con
tinued to talk about the reasons for
ending the student management of
Suites Dining Clubs.
"I don't have an answer,"
Boswell eventually responded.
Boswell did say that there were
aspects of the situation surrounding
Suites Dining that students did not
know about, which contributed to
Res Ed's decision.

"Many of you probably don't
know I can't talk about it much
but you don't know that there is
active litigation against the Gover
nor's Corner Dining Society by a
former employer and against Stan
ford University," he said. "We have
been uncomfortable talking about
that."

In a post-event interview with
the Daily, Unterreiner alleged that
this was a dirty trick by Boswell.
"I was disappointed by that tac
tic because there is a lawsuit ongo
ing against both Governor's Corner

Dining Society [CCDS] and the Uni
versityâ€” I'm not allowed to com
ment on that, and nobody is allowed
to comment on that," Unterreiner
said. "I really don't know what I can
say within the bounds of the law, but
having that tossed around them
tossed a lot of doubt on our credibil
ity without having to prove that the
lawsuit has any merit. I thought it
was unfair to mention that there is a
lawsuit ongoing that makes it seem
like there are terrible things going
on in Suites, which there are not."
Unterreiner also added that the
GCDS has a $2 million liability poli
cy for exactly this sort of situation.
An emerging dialogue
After the event, Boswell told a
group of students that Students Or
ganized Services (SOS) is no longer
interested in bidding for Suites Din
ing. SOS is a for-profit, privately
held company, which operates food
related labor services for the Row
and which is headed up by Nick Pe
ters '94.
Peters' brother-in-law is Zac
Sargeant, who was hired as assis
tant director of ResEd in 2008. Be
cause of this connection, students
have accused ResEd of ignoring
or perpetuating a conflict of in
terest in choosing SOS as the pri
vate contractor for Suites.

According to Unterreiner, the
current chefs of Suites Dining Clubs
now plan to incorporate as an LLC
before next year and bid to be the
private contractor for Suites.
Boswell seemed to be amenable to
this course of action.

"We would feel more comfort
able if the chefs were the vendors
rather than the students were the
vendors," Boswell told a group of
students following the formal
protest. "The chefs are profession
als, who as they have said who
we can work with, hold accountable
and interact with and so on."
Unterreiner said this is still not
the ideal scenario, and that he will
continue to fight for a student-run
Suites Dining.
"I think even forcing the chefs to
go up against an outside company is
inherently disrespectful to the serv
ice that they have put in over years
over many many years of service to
Stanford," he said. "They shouldn't
have to compete against an outside
company for reasons that haven't
been fully explained. My goal is to
fight against them having to bid at
all."

Students also said that they will
continue to fight against ResEd and
University administrators.
"I was responding to a really
well-written article that made con
crete a lot of the things that were
wrong with this particular situa
tion," said Elizabeth Matus 'l4, a
protester. "And the University if
it wants to have any leverage way
will have to respond in an equally
concrete and thorough way."
