# Students protest for Suites
## Over 120 gather to support Suites Eating Clubs' student management, chefs 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
More than 120 Stanford students gath
ered in the middle of White Plaza on Monday
afternoon to protest the University's recent
decision to end student management at
Suites Eating Clubs.
The move to contract the operations of
Suites Dining to an outside vendor, which
was announced by Residential Education
(ResEd) at the end of January, has been
widely derided by the Stanford community
as symptomatic of the University's corpora
tization and representative of an increasing
encroachment upon student autonomy
Students who showed up at the protest
said the event stemmed from frustration
over a series of University decisions
which they felt had been made without seri
ous consultation from the community mem
bers that would subsequently be affected
made over the past three years.
These include the University's decisions
to revoke the lease of the student-run Chi
Theta Chi last February, to launch a $5.5 mil
lion project to install of card readers on Row
houses last fall and to establish a new food
vendor policy that has driven popular food

trucks off campus this winter.
"There is a common theme of [the] Uni
versity administration not consulting with
the student body while drafting these deci
sions, instead implementing these decisions
and then announcing them to the masses
through email," said event organizer
Ma'ayan Dembo 'l4, speaking through a
loud speaker while standing on the stage
outside of Dinkelspiel Auditorium. "It is our
right as paying students and adults to have a
voice on these reforms and demand more
transparency from the administration."
The statement received one of the largest
rounds of applause of the day from the audi
ence. A few of its members waved signs and
banners with slogans like "Stop stanford"
and "Goodbye wind of freedom, Hello stan
ford Housing."

Students seeking a voice
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a Daily
staffer, has been credited for helping such is
sues gain traction among the student body,
and his long-form article about the end of
Suites Daring's student management has
prompted extensive reader response since
its publication last week. As of Monday
night, the first page of the online article has

received more than 2,500 Facebook likes and
16,400 unique page views, making it the fifth
most-read story on the Daily's website since
the 2008-09 academic year.
The article was part investigative jour
nalism, examining the rationales put for
ward by ResEd as justifying ending student
management at Suites Dining, and part per
sonal narrative, exploring Unterreiner's
own experience working as a hasher at
Suites and his interactions with its chefs,
particularly Bollard Eating Club head chef
Frank Hassan.
Speaking to The Daily the night before
the protest, Dembo, who is neither a Suites
nor XOX resident, said that it was this arti
cle that inspired her to take action.
"I was reading through the article, and at
the end, it said something like, 'lt's time to
take action,' and I realized, 'Yeah, we
should,"' Dembo said. "I was talking about it
with my friends all weekend, kind of expect
ing and waiting for something to happen,
and then I finally decided that maybe I
should be the one to take action instead."
According to Dembo, she sent out an
email to 12 of her friends Sunday afternoon,
