# Q&A ROBBIE ZIMBROFF ASSU PRESIDENT WILLIAM WAGSTAFF VICE PRESIDENT
## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Having assumed office after a
heated campaign last spring, AS
SU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 and Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 are
nearing the end of their time in of
fice. With less than two months
left in their term, Zimbroff and
Wagstaff sat down with The Daily
to discuss their time in office and
what they still hope to accomplish.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
were the main goals that you set
out to accomplish as ASSU Ex
ecutives, and do you feel that
you were successful?
William Wagstaff (WW): We
separated our platform into big

ideas and more day-to-day stuff.
Some of the bigger things were
faster reimbursements from SSE
[Stanford Student Enterprises],
bringing food trucks and working
with [the Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse] office, and we
wanted to do the textbook ex
change, community centers and
staff appreciation. I think we were
successful.
Robbie Zimbroff (RZ): When
we started out, we set our goals to
be pretty realistic of what one
could accomplish and should ac
complish, but we also left room for
things that come up in the middle
of the year... one of the realities is
[that] things take longer than you
first imagine them to, so we are still
trying to finish up and make sure
that we tie up all loose ends.

TSD: If you had a chance to redo
your term as Executives, is there
anything that you would do dif
ferently?
RZ: There are specific in
stances where I would have tried
to have a stricter timeline on when
things got accomplished. The sex
ual assault relationship abuse stuff
... has been a very long process
that we started at the beginning of
the fall, even over the summer,
and still is frustratingly not com

plete ...We are really trying to
produce a singular document
about what the pathways are,
what the University responses are
after an assault.
TSD: What is your response to
critics who say that bringing
food trucks to campus was your
only accomplishment?
RZ: It's our most public one ...

Wagstaff (right), nearing the end of their term, spoke with The Daily
about their time in office and what they still hope to accomplish.
The nature of the way we
have to communicate about
that is different. Making
SSE a little more efficient is
not something that I have to
tell you in a Facebook group
...I don't think we need to
throw in your face all the
time exactly what we are do
ing every week or toot our
own horns for our own sake.
WW: I think the tailgate
was also a pretty effective
thing that reached a differ
ent crowd of people. More
serious things like the sexual
assault and relationship
abuse stuff will touch a small
number of people, but it's al
so important to say that
there were people who really
enjoyed the tailgates. That is
something that helped with
our sports culture.

TSD: What do you think
about the fact that only
one slate has declared to
run for Executives this
year? How many people do
you expect to declare?
RZ: To be honest, we
haven't been keeping a pulse
on who has been declaring or
not... I wonder how much
it's being advertised. I

haven't seen much being ad
vertised about it, but I don't
keep very close tabs on lists
and stuff, so I don't know
what is going to.
WW: I have no idea.
TSD: Why do you think
that fewer and fewer stu
dents are voting in ASSU
elections every year, and do
you think this trend is con
cerning? Is there any way
to reverse it?
RZ: I don't put too much
stock in reading the tea
leaves of what voter turnout
means. I think different
years have had different lev
els of engagement... It will
be interesting if people end
up declaring if they start
talking about Suites, which is
a very relevant issue at the
moment of elections, and if it
becomes kind of a defining
feature of the election cycle.
WW: It changes also with
who runs. I don't really think
about it too much.

TSD: Considering the lack
of student interest in the
ASSU and the small num
ber of candidates who run
for positions, do you think
that the Undergraduate
Senate and [Graduate Stu
dent Council] accurately
represent the student body
as a whole?
WW: I don't know that

the expectation is that they
are a perfect representation
of the student body... I
guess people took it upon
themselves to run, and you
have the right to exercise
whether or not you are going
to vote.
RZ: Clearly our school is
not made up of 80 percent
sophomores and 10 percent
juniors, so it's not represen
tative in the exact distribu
tion of what campus is. Does
that mean that they can't do
what the ASSU needs to be
doing? No, not at a11... They
fulfill a need to support other
groups that is very impor
tant and needs to get done,
and everything beyond that
is sort of the year-to-year
variation 0f... the students
and what is going on on cam
pus.
WW: If people really
wanted something changed,
and they thought student
government could do some
thing about it, I think those
people could reach out to the
Senate ... If you don't think
they're representative, then
you should talk to them
about what you want to do.
Or run.

TSD: What will you be fo
cusing on for the rest of
your term?
RZ: I believe April 3 we
are having a staff apprecia

tion day, which is for all resi
dential and dining staff...
SARA stuff, we are trying to
get our peer-to-peer panels
into dorms so we have hired a
coordinator, she has a long list
of people who want to volun
teer to be panelists... We're
working with club sports to
reinstate scholarships that
used to exist before budget
cuts to help kids who can't af
ford club dues to still be able
to play club sports.
We're expanding a reuse
recycle program with sus
tainability groups... we are
basically going to pick up
more refrigerators that are
getting tossed at the end of
the year and bring them
back to campus so kids who
might not be able to afford a
fridge or microwave at the
beginning of next year can
get those.
WW: And not like super
big but just for saving mon
ey, we're trying to get the
discounts out there more,
people still miss them. Every
time I go somewhere I ask if
they have a student discount.
RZ: A lot of smaller stuff
... the Community Action
Board is an ASSU chartered

organization and we have
been working with them to
start a grant program where
different communities on
campus can jointly run a pro
gram and get up to $5OO for
it... The idea is to get people
into conversation about what
diversity on this campus
means and looks like ... Not
everyone needs to know
about every little thing we're
doing all the time. Hopefully
inside wherever you are on
campus, we can try to help in
some small way.
TSD: What is the most im
portant lesson that you
learned this year that you
want to pass on to future
Executives?
WW: Set hard deadlines
... Be realistic. I think that
yeah, there are a lot of things
going on and a lot of issues
student government can deal
with, but there are also a lot
of things that are really well
done by the administration
and by the University and al
so by student government.
RZ: It's about knowing
yourself and knowing what
you always wanted to do or
what you came there to do,

because I think it's easy to
feel like you are in over your
head if you are supposed to
do everything that has ever
happened on campus ... See
ing that the ASSU is one
part of the bigger picture,
and not necessarily a more
important part of the bigger
picture, is a big leap that
someone should take to be in
this spot, but I think that
people don't always see that
... Life is bigger than the AS
SU, for sure, and if you are
inside of it, it's important to
not lose sight of that fact and
suddenly think that you're
extra tight because you are
in the ASSU.
WW: Whatever you do,
you are not going to make
everyone happy. You are nev
er going to be doing enough
for people, sometimes you'll
be doing too much for peo
ple, sometimes you are not
efficient enough for every
one, so you have to know that
you can't please everyone.

talking about Suites, which is
a very relevant issue at the
moment of elections, and if it
becomes kind of a defining
feature of the election cycle.
WW: It changes also with
who runs. I don't really think
about it too much.

TSD: Considering the lack
of student interest in the
ASSU and the small num
ber of candidates who run
for positions, do you think
that the Undergraduate
Senate and [Graduate Stu
dent Council] accurately
represent the student body
as a whole?
WW: I don't know that

the expectation is that they
are a perfect representation
of the student body... I
guess people took it upon
themselves to run, and you
have the right to exercise
whether or not you are going
to vote.
RZ: Clearly our school is
not made up of 80 percent
sophomores and 10 percent
juniors, so it's not represen
tative in the exact distribu
tion of what campus is. Does
that mean that they can't do
what the ASSU needs to be
doing? No, not at a11... They
fulfill a need to support other
groups that is very impor
tant and needs to get done,
and everything beyond that
is sort of the year-to-year
variation 0f... the students
and what is going on on cam
pus.
WW: If people really
wanted something changed,
and they thought student
government could do some
thing about it, I think those
people could reach out to the
Senate ... If you don't think
they're representative, then
you should talk to them
about what you want to do.
Or run.

TSD: What will you be fo
cusing on for the rest of
your term?
RZ: I believe April 3 we
are having a staff apprecia

tion day, which is for all resi
dential and dining staff...
SARA stuff, we are trying to
get our peer-to-peer panels
into dorms so we have hired a
coordinator, she has a long list
of people who want to volun
teer to be panelists... We're
working with club sports to
reinstate scholarships that
used to exist before budget
cuts to help kids who can't af
ford club dues to still be able
to play club sports.
We're expanding a reuse
recycle program with sus
tainability groups... we are
basically going to pick up
more refrigerators that are
getting tossed at the end of
the year and bring them
back to campus so kids who
might not be able to afford a
fridge or microwave at the
beginning of next year can
get those.
WW: And not like super
big but just for saving mon
ey, we're trying to get the
discounts out there more,
people still miss them. Every
time I go somewhere I ask if
they have a student discount.
RZ: A lot of smaller stuff
... the Community Action
Board is an ASSU chartered

organization and we have
been working with them to
start a grant program where
different communities on
campus can jointly run a pro
gram and get up to $5OO for
it... The idea is to get people
into conversation about what
diversity on this campus
means and looks like ... Not
everyone needs to know
about every little thing we're
doing all the time. Hopefully
inside wherever you are on
campus, we can try to help in
some small way.
TSD: What is the most im
portant lesson that you
learned this year that you
want to pass on to future
Executives?
WW: Set hard deadlines
... Be realistic. I think that
yeah, there are a lot of things
going on and a lot of issues
student government can deal
with, but there are also a lot
of things that are really well
done by the administration
and by the University and al
so by student government.
RZ: It's about knowing
yourself and knowing what
you always wanted to do or
what you came there to do,

because I think it's easy to
feel like you are in over your
head if you are supposed to
do everything that has ever
happened on campus ... See
ing that the ASSU is one
part of the bigger picture,
and not necessarily a more
important part of the bigger
picture, is a big leap that
someone should take to be in
this spot, but I think that
people don't always see that
... Life is bigger than the AS
SU, for sure, and if you are
inside of it, it's important to
not lose sight of that fact and
suddenly think that you're
extra tight because you are
in the ASSU.
WW: Whatever you do,
you are not going to make
everyone happy. You are nev
er going to be doing enough
for people, sometimes you'll
be doing too much for peo
ple, sometimes you are not
efficient enough for every
one, so you have to know that
you can't please everyone.

Having assumed office after a
heated campaign last spring, AS
SU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 and Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 are
nearing the end of their time in of
fice. With less than two months
left in their term, Zimbroff and
Wagstaff sat down with The Daily
to discuss their time in office and
what they still hope to accomplish.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
were the main goals that you set
out to accomplish as ASSU Ex
ecutives, and do you feel that
you were successful?
William Wagstaff (WW): We
separated our platform into big

ideas and more day-to-day stuff.
Some of the bigger things were
faster reimbursements from SSE
[Stanford Student Enterprises],
bringing food trucks and working
with [the Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse] office, and we
wanted to do the textbook ex
change, community centers and
staff appreciation. I think we were
successful.
Robbie Zimbroff (RZ): When
we started out, we set our goals to
be pretty realistic of what one
could accomplish and should ac
complish, but we also left room for
things that come up in the middle
of the year... one of the realities is
[that] things take longer than you
first imagine them to, so we are still
trying to finish up and make sure
that we tie up all loose ends.

TSD: If you had a chance to redo
your term as Executives, is there
anything that you would do dif
ferently?
RZ: There are specific in
stances where I would have tried
to have a stricter timeline on when
things got accomplished. The sex
ual assault relationship abuse stuff
... has been a very long process
that we started at the beginning of
the fall, even over the summer,
and still is frustratingly not com

plete ...We are really trying to
produce a singular document
about what the pathways are,
what the University responses are
after an assault.
TSD: What is your response to
critics who say that bringing
food trucks to campus was your
only accomplishment?
RZ: It's our most public one ...

ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff (left) and Vice President William
Wagstaff (right), nearing the end of their term, spoke with The Daily
about their time in office and what they still hope to accomplish.
The nature of the way we
have to communicate about
that is different. Making
SSE a little more efficient is
not something that I have to
tell you in a Facebook group
...I don't think we need to
throw in your face all the
time exactly what we are do
ing every week or toot our
own horns for our own sake.
WW: I think the tailgate
was also a pretty effective
thing that reached a differ
ent crowd of people. More
serious things like the sexual
assault and relationship
abuse stuff will touch a small
number of people, but it's al
so important to say that
there were people who really
enjoyed the tailgates. That is
something that helped with
our sports culture.

TSD: What do you think
about the fact that only
one slate has declared to
run for Executives this
year? How many people do
you expect to declare?
RZ: To be honest, we
haven't been keeping a pulse
on who has been declaring or
not... I wonder how much
it's being advertised. I

haven't seen much being ad
vertised about it, but I don't
keep very close tabs on lists
and stuff, so I don't know
what is going to.
WW: I have no idea.
TSD: Why do you think
that fewer and fewer stu
dents are voting in ASSU
elections every year, and do
you think this trend is con
cerning? Is there any way
to reverse it?
RZ: I don't put too much
stock in reading the tea
leaves of what voter turnout
means. I think different
years have had different lev
els of engagement... It will
be interesting if people end
up declaring if they start
talking about Suites, which is
a very relevant issue at the
moment of elections, and if it
becomes kind of a defining
feature of the election cycle.

ing that the ASSU is one
part of the bigger picture,
and not necessarily a more
important part of the bigger
picture, is a big leap that
someone should take to be in
this spot, but I think that
people don't always see that
... Life is bigger than the AS
SU, for sure, and if you are
inside of it, it's important to
not lose sight of that fact and
suddenly think that you're
extra tight because you are
in the ASSU.
WW: Whatever you do,
you are not going to make
everyone happy. You are nev
er going to be doing enough
for people, sometimes you'll
be doing too much for peo
ple, sometimes you are not
efficient enough for every
one, so you have to know that
you can't please everyone.
