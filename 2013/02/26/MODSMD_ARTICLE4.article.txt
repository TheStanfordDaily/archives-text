## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Having assumed office after a
heated campaign last spring, AS
SU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 and Vice President
William Wagstaff 'l2 M.A. 'l3 are
nearing the end of their time in of
fice. With less than two months
left in their term, Zimbroff and
Wagstaff sat down with The Daily
to discuss their time in office and
what they still hope to accomplish.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
were the main goals that you set
out to accomplish as ASSU Ex
ecutives, and do you feel that
you were successful?
William Wagstaff (WW): We
separated our platform into big

ideas and more day-to-day stuff.
Some of the bigger things were
faster reimbursements from SSE
[Stanford Student Enterprises],
bringing food trucks and working
with [the Sexual Assault and Rela
tionship Abuse] office, and we
wanted to do the textbook ex
change, community centers and
staff appreciation. I think we were
successful.
Robbie Zimbroff (RZ): When
we started out, we set our goals to
be pretty realistic of what one
could accomplish and should ac
complish, but we also left room for
things that come up in the middle
of the year... one of the realities is
[that] things take longer than you
first imagine them to, so we are still
trying to finish up and make sure
that we tie up all loose ends.

TSD: If you had a chance to redo
your term as Executives, is there
anything that you would do dif
ferently?
RZ: There are specific in
stances where I would have tried
to have a stricter timeline on when
things got accomplished. The sex
ual assault relationship abuse stuff
... has been a very long process
that we started at the beginning of
the fall, even over the summer,
and still is frustratingly not com

plete ...We are really trying to
produce a singular document
about what the pathways are,
what the University responses are
after an assault.
TSD: What is your response to
critics who say that bringing
food trucks to campus was your
only accomplishment?
RZ: It's our most public one ...
