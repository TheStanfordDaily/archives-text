## Stanford applicant chosen as Intel STS finalist 
### CATHERINE ZAW DESK EDITOR 
On Jan. 23, Jake Takahashi, 17, of
Saratoga, Calif., was chosen as one of
40 finalists for the Intel Science Talent
Search (Intel STS) the nation's
most prestigious science research
award for high school seniors for his
research at the Stanford School of
Medicine. As a finalist, Takashi has re
ceived a $l,OOO stipend, with the poten
tial to win $2,000 more if he finishes the
competition as one of 10 winners.
Takahashi is awaiting his admis
sions decision from Stanford, having
been deferred from the early action
pool into the regular decision pool.
Takahashi will travel to the Nation
al Geographic Society Building in
Washington, D.C., the second week of

March to find out if he won.
"I was really surprised and fully ex
pecting not to be a finalist," Takahashi
said. "I got the phone call back in ear
ly February and was totally surprised.
I'm really excited because it's a really
cool opportunity."
Takahashi's research journey be
gan a little over a year ago when he
reached out to some professors
through the School of Medicine's Com
munity Academic Profile website. Af
ter contacting a few professors he was
interested in working with, Takahashi
received some offers.
"I wanted to work in both molecular
and medical biology and [this lab] en
abled me to do that," he said, explain
ing why he eventually chose to work in

Search for his research at the Stanford School of Medicine.
the lab of Vinicio de Jesus Perez, as
sistant professor of medicine.
De Jesus Perez's lab has focused
on the genetic, cellular and molecu
lar mechanism involved in the
pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
"We're working with many dif
ferent cell types like endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells and fi
broblasts," Takahashi said. "In pa
tients that have this disease, their
cells are malfunctioning in some

way, and we're finding the abnor
malities so that we can eventually
correct them with drugs."
In particular, Takahashi has
worked with smooth muscle cells
from pulmonary arteries, doing pro
cedures like Western blots, poly
merase chain reactions (PCR) and
immunofluorescence, which help
quantify the various amounts of
mRNA and proteins within individ
ual cells. During his research, Taka
hashi found that there was excess
beta-catenin in diseased smooth
muscle cells, which results in excess
smooth muscle cell proliferation.
Takahashi, who attends Lyn
brook High School in San Jose, ap
plied to Stanford in November,

turning in a 15-page research paper,
the application form and letters of
recommendation from members of
the lab.
According to Takahashi, his deci
sion to apply to the competition was
not unique among his peers.
'A lot of people do it from my
school," Takahashi said. "There's al
ways around five applicants. So it's
pretty consistent and a lot of people
know about it. I was inspired by see
ing winners in previous years and
going to award ceremonies and see
ing other people doing it. It's pretty
well-known in our school."
Takahashi said that his top four
colleges are Stanford, Harvard,
M.I.T. and UC San Diego.

He admitted that getting accept
ed into UC San Diego's Medical
Scholars Program an eight-year
combined 8.A./M.D. program that
accepts up to 12 highly qualified
high school seniors each year and
grants them provisional acceptance
into the UCSD School of Medicine
would be a dream come true.
Meanwhile, with his early action
application deferred by Stanford,
Takahashi expressed hope that his
participation in the Talent Search
would affect the University's ulti
mate decision. Until then, however,
he will focus on preparing for the
big event in March.
"I only [have] had a couple of
weeks since I knew about becoming

a finalist," he said. "I'll be preparing
my board, practicing explaining
what's on it and about my project.
And then there's also a judging
process where they'll ask me ques
tions just to see if I'm an 'exception
al scientist,' so I'll definitely be prac
ticing that."
In the future, Takahashi hopes to
go back to research with the intent
of getting his work published.
"The more research I do, the
more I learn, and hopefully with
more results, I should have a paper
high enough to make a decent jour
nal publication," he said.
