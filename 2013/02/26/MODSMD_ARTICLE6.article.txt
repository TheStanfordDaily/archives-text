## New manager joins R&DE food program 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While managing compost and waste
reduction might not seem like an ideal
career for many people, for Stanford
Dining's new Sustainable Food Pro
gram Manager Dara Olmstead it's a
"dream job."
Olmstead previously served as the
director of Harvard's Food Literacy
Project and wrote a blog for The
Boston Globe about environmental sus
tainability. She is the fourth person to
hold the Sustainable Food Program
Manager position, which was created
in 2006 by a group of student interns.
According to Erin Gaines 'O7, one of
the interns who proposed the Sustain
able Food Program Manager position,
sustainability initiatives used to be pri
marily directed by students. Although
the students were largely enthusiastic
about their work, they struggled to bal
ance some of their larger projects with
academic commitments.
"What we realized is that students
can't really manage all of those initia
tives," Gaines said. "People get excited
during the middle of the quarter, and
then you get stressed out at the end
and leave for break and nobody really
maintains things."
The first Sustainable Food Program
Manager was Emmett Hopkins 'O5
M.S. 'O6. Gaines, who said she took the
job in hopes of "making a much larger
impact than I had made as a student,"
succeeded Hopkins.
"As a student you are always very
passionate about things, but you have a
bazillion things going on," Gaines said.
"I thought it would be really exciting to
use all of the knowledge and experi
ence I had but to be able to work on
these things full time."
As Sustainable Food Pro
gram Manager, Gaines said
that she focused on examin
ing where food was pur
chased, how it was grown
and how Stanford could pro
duce more of its own food on
campus, as well as educating
the student body about sus
tainability initiatives.
Gaines held the job for
two years before turning it
over to Matt Rothe MBA 'O7.
Rothe was named a finalist in
the 2011 Real Food Chal
lenge for his efforts to estab
lish sustainable food policies
at Stanford, including reduc
ing waste from dining halls
and purchasing more organic
food. In 2012, Rothe left to
become a fellow at the Hasso
Plattner Institute of Design.
After moving to Palo Alto
last year when her fiance was
hired by Apple, Olmstead
worked at a non-profit engi
neering education company.

She heard that Stanford was
hiring a new Sustainable
Food Program Manager
when friends from Harvard
sent her the job posting.
"I've always been well
aware of what Stanford was
doing and impressed by the
dining program here," 01m
stead wrote in a statement to
The Daily. "I love being in a
university environment, and
I can't think of a more unique
and inspiring environment
than Stanford."
According to Olmstead,
her four main responsibili
ties will be purchasing and
reporting "fair" food; work
ing on education and out
reach; improving sustainabil
ity in operations and collabo
rating with community and
student groups to create new
goals and involve them in
programs.
During her first month at
Stanford, Olmstead has fo
cused on internal operations
and forming connections in
the Stanford community, in
cluding meeting with several
student groups and general
managers at various dining
halls to discuss sustainability

initiatives.
According to ASSU Sena
tor Janhavi Vartak 'l5, 01m
stead hopes to collaborate
with the Senate in hiring a
new student intern next year.
"Working with students is
one of the main reasons I was
attracted to this position and
is one of the core areas of re
sponsibilities," Olmstead
wrote.
In the short run, Olm
stead will work on reducing
food waste and hosting class
es with dining hall chefs.
Olmstead cited two of Resi
dential & Dining Enterpris
es' (R&DE) sustainability
goals doubling sustain
able purchases and achieving
100 percent transparency on
purchases by 2015 —as
long-term projects.
"I'm really thankful that
R&DE is fully committed to
sustainability," Olmstead
wrote. "It's important to me
to work somewhere where
sustainability is supported
by the leadership team and
part of the core mission."
