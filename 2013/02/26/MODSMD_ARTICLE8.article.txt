# Divesting my Stanford fan investment
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It seems like blasphemy to even
ask this question, the sort of
uneducated heresy more likely
to be uttered by a student from
that university across the Bay,
but: Is Stanford evil?
It can't be, right? I love this place.
I honestly struggle to get dressed in
the morning and not find myself
wealing something Cardinal. Out of
14 football games last season, I
missed just two away games, and I
shudder to think how many days of
my life I have spent in my second
home, Maples Pavilion.
There are few sports teams that I
live and die for: Reading FC, the
England soccer team and now the en
semble of Stanford Athletics too. It
wasn't always that way, I used to find
the whole concept of "school spirit"
rather distasteful, but reporting for
this publication, chatting with ath
letes and coaches alike and simply
sharing far too many happy memo
ries alongside other Stanford fans
eventually wore me down.
It can't, then, be evil. I'm one of
the good guys, right? When I missed
my bus home from Los Angeles on
Presidents' Day, I ended up buying
two tickets. One for me and one for
another passenger in a similar
predicament, except with an empty
wallet. Not because he asked I did
n't even give him the chance to do
that but just because it was the
right thing to do.
So I wouldn't support something
that was downright evil, right? Sure
ly someone or something that I like
and have respect for can't be that
bad.
But then Stanford admitted
ly not the athletics department
goes and sells out us students over
the summer, letting Starbucks in
vade Tresidder, does its best to kill
off a popular and charitable food
truck, banishing NetAppetit from
the Farm (though it has since been
allowed to return under heavy re
strictions), and now threatens to
poison the lifeblood of Suites, hand
ing control of its student-run eating
clubs over to outsiders.
Wait, that can't be my Stanford,
can it? My Stanford seen
through my rose-colored glasses
is the good guy, the quirky little
school that has made it to the top
without compromising its identity
and idealism. Not the sort of place
that would just roll over for the
first corporation that comes knock
ing, that values profit above any
thing else.
A lot of debate on campus cen
ters around the Israel-Palestine
conflict and whether Stanford, an
incredibly rich and influential or
ganization, should divest from cer
tain companies with dealings in the
Middle East. The main idea being
that investing in these companies
supports the status quo and indi
rectly leads to flagrant abuses of
human rights, and thus by remov
ing this money, the university could
enact positive change.
Whether that will work and ex
actly who is and isn't responsible in
the first place probably isn't a topic
I should be subjecting you sports
fans to, but I wouldn't be scribbling
this down if I didn't see some thing
in common here.
I can't blame the athletics de
partment directly for the sins com
mitted elsewhere, but like it or not,
there is a deep connection between
all the various subsidiaries of Stan
ford Inc. I also have a lot invested
in Cardinal sports not money, of
course but something worth far
more: my hopes and dreams.
So should I could I divest
myself from all this? Even though
attendances at football games
aren't exactly multitudinous, I
doubt a single fan would be missed,
and since most of my tickets I get
for free, I wouldn't exactly be cut
ting off a lucrative revenue stream.
But regardless of the futility of it
all, is it the right thing to do?
Reading FC is a soccer minnow
struggling to stay alive in the world
of the Premier League. Though
technically now owned by a Russian
billionaire or at least a consor
tium including him it has not let
this go to its head, valuing the team
ethic over expensive and extrava
gant superstar players or man
agers.
Even the England team doesn't
appear too bad. Yes, the Football
Association the governing body
