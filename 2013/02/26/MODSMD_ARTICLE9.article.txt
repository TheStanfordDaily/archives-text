## MEN'S TENNIS Stanford falls to rival Cal 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 28 Stanford men's
tennis team suffered its third
consecutive loss on the road
this Sunday, falling 5-2 to No.
12 Cal (5-4) in a non-conference
match. The Cardinal (3-5) lost
to the Golden Bears for only
the 17th time in the 105 times
the teams have faced off.

The match started well for
the Cardinal, as Stanford took
the doubles point with victories
from freshman Nolan Paige and
junior Jamin Ball at No. 2 dou
bles and freshman Maciek Ro
manowicz and sophomore
Robert Stineman at No. 3 dou
bles.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles
team, sophomore John Morris
sey and senior Denis Lin, fell 8-
4 to Golden Bears Christoffer
Konigsfeldt and Campbell
Johnson, currently the No. 14
duo in the nation.
The Cardinal's lead faltered
when the singles matches be
gan. On court one, Morrissey
lost 6-3, 6-0 to No. 82 Ben
McLachlan.
"Personally, I was a little
disappointed. I definitely didn't
serve as well as I had hoped,
and that was something I had
been working on for the last
few weeks," Morrissey said.
"It's just a learning experience
and I'm going to hopefully

work on that and have it ready
for the tournament this week
end and matches next week."

Stanford regained the lead
when freshman Anthony Tbodikov
beat Cal's Wyatt Houghton 6-4,
6-3 at No. 6 singles. However,
the Cardinal's fate was sealed
with the losses of the No. 2
through No. 5 singles players:
Paige, Romanowicz, Stineman
and Ball.
The matches were all ex
tremely close, as both Ro
manowicz and Stineman had
three-set battles and Paige and

Ball brought their second sets
to tiebreaks.
"The team showed a lot of
heart, we definitely had some
opportunities," Morrissey said.
"We won the doubles point and
had some opportunities with
singles that maybe we didn't
capitalize on, but the team
fought incredibly hard and
gave it our all."

The Cardinal will have a
chance for redemption on April
20, when it will play Cal at

home in a match that will count for
the Pac-12 conference standings.
Morrissey is hopeful that they will
clinch a victory, as he said that the
team has been improving through
out the season.
"At the end of the day, we are
still a very young team," Morrissey
said. "We are just gaining experi
ence with every match and we're
getting better with every match, so
when they come over here in a
month's time we're going to be
ready, hopefully."
The Cardinal is on the road
again this weekend, traveling to La
Jolla, Calif., to compete in the 124 th
annual Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
Tournament. Stanford players have
claimed the title in the past two
years, as Bradley Klahn 'l2 and

Ryan Thacher 'l2 took back-to-back
victories. The tournament will fea
ture some of the best collegiate play
ers in the nation.
"It is a prestigious event. It is the
oldest tournament in the United
States and there have been some
great names that have won that
tournament, so it is really tough
competition," Morrissey said.
According to Morrissey, the
tournament often involves two or
three doubles matches a day. Mor
rissey said the event is an opportu
nity to work on "some things we
might not get to work on" in a reg
ular match situation, where the
main concern is often the singles
matches or the team's total.
"La Jolla is always a fun event,"
Morrissey said. "We usually don't
really get to focus solely on doubles,
so it's a nice event and it's some
thing a little different."
