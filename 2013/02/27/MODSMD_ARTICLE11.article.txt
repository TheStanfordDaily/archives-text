# Reading between the sidelines
## 
### David Eng 
A female acquaintance
recently asked me why
I followed sports. Ini
tially flustered by the
elementary nature of
the question, I replied with a measure
of desperation, "Well, why do you
read?"
It seemed to be a response that
would be relatable to an individual as
infatuated with fictional accounts as
she. I loved to follow sports, just as
she loved to read. And I loved fol
lowing sports for very much the
same reason that she immersed her
self in fiction.
It took only the stink-eye that
followed for me to realize that this
wasn't one of the more intelligent
things I could have said that is,
insinuate a parallel between an es
cape which she more than likely as
sociates with innocence and intellec
tualism and an institution which she
more than likely associates with
couches, beer and phantom girl
friends. But, given the discussion
that followed, I regret nothing.
Nothing.
Digressions and irrelevant de
tails aside, i.e., the criticism that
followed my admission of reading
the Wikipedia plot summary in
lieu of enduring the 25-plus naps
required to complete "Harry Pot
ter and the Deathly Hallows," I
eventually posed the following
challenge to her (shout-out to my
readers who also enjoy digging
holes for themselves): provide a
reason why an avid reader con
sumes fiction that does not also
satisfy a reason why an avid
sports fan follows athletics. Here's
her list and a, shall we say,
"rephrasing" of my original re
sponses:
The characters: As far as fic
tional characters go, Hermione
Granger and Jacob Black are
crowd-pleasers â€”or so I've
heard. Well, sports feature such
crowd-pleasing characters as well.
I'd pit Brian Scalabrine up against
Jacob any day. Werewolves may
clothe themselves with jean
shorts, but ultimately they are
nothing more than flesh and
blood. Scalabrine is God. I'd like
to see a werewolf take on God.
And, with enough practice, ex-
Wizard JaVale McGee could cer
tainly say wingardium- leviosa
as well as Hermione. No joke. The
diversity of characters that popu
late sports rosters most certainly
contends with the diversity of
characters from fiction.
The plot: A plot is supposed to
be engrossing. Do you recall Lin
sanity? Do you recall Jackie
Robinson's traversal of the color
barrier? And do you recall those
special David versus Goliath con
frontations the stuff of leg
ends? The eighth-seeded War
riors' first-round dismantling of
the first-seeded Mavericks? The
underdog New York Giants oust
ing the undefeated Patriots in the
Super Bowl on a helmet catch?
Greg Jennings scoring on the
Saints with a broken leg? The
eternal struggle that is Dwight
Howard and the free throw?
It's something to talk about:
In the same way that two readers
may connect over a mutual dis
taste of an instance of poor style in
the fourth paragraph on page 231
or may laud an author's vivid use
of imagery in said fiction novel,
two sports followers may connect
over a mutual distaste for the
Warriors' fashion-forward, i.e.,
ugly long-sleeve jerseys or shared
admiration of Coco Crisp's hair.
And there's value in this
there's no substitute for an argu
ment over sports, especially the
argument involving Stephen A.
Smith trouncing Skip Bayless.
And just think about the cultural
references that sports so often
spawn see Marshawn Lynch
(True Meaning of Determination).
It teaches life lessons: Study
ing the imaginary actions of an
imaginary character supposedly
makes us better people. Similar to
how the writings of Shakespeare
teach us not to suffocate our wives
with a pillow over a misplaced
handkerchief or stage a dramatic
death at the suggestion of a friar,
sports reminds us of certain life
realities. Having a fictitious girl
friend (a la Manti Te'o), for exam
ple: not a good life choice. Fabricat
ing a fictitious website (a la Melky
Cabrera): not a good life choice.
Punching a brick wall out of frus
tration (a la Kevin Brown and, I'm
sure, many others): not a good life
choice. Throwing the football
