# CARD ACES GAELS
## EXTENDS WINNING STREAK TO FIVE 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford baseball offense continued to
build on its recent success and the pitching staff
hurled another stellar performance as the No. 14
Cardinal (6-2) extended its winning streak to five
games with a convincing defeat of Saint Mary's
by a score of 7-2.

En route to its fifth straight victory, the Cardi
nal scored seven runs for a third game in a row
and smacked a season-high fifteen hits. The of
fense, which started the year off slowly now ap
pears to be firing on all cylinders.
In fact, eight of the nine starters in Stanford's
lineup on Tuesday afternoon collected at least one
hit each. Sophomore right fielder Austin Slater,
who had collected multiple hits in each of his last
four games, was the only holdout but got on base
by walking twice and also drove in a run.
The offensive star of the afternoon was junior
catcher Brant Whiting, who stalled on sophomore
catcher Wayne Taylor's day off. Making his first
career start after missing most of his sophomore
season due to injury Whiting made a huge impact.
The Fbllerton, Calif., native had hits in three of
his four at-bats, including a triple in the eighth in
ning, and knocked in two runs.
"I was just really trying to get a fastball and hit
it," said Whiting. "Luckily, I got a fastball in all
four at-bats on the first pitch, so I put a good swing
on it."
The pitching ensured that the offensive fire
power was more than enough to secure the victo
ry for the Cardinal. Senior Dean McArdle, sopho

more David Schmidt, junior Sam Lindquist and
redshirt junior Garrett Hughes combined for a
gem, allowing only six hits by the Gaels' offense
and giving up two runs.
McArdle's only mistake of the afternoon was a
first-inning at-bat by Gaels sophomore Collin Fer
guson, who worked the count to 2-2 before un
leashing a home run to the opposite field to give
Saint Mary's an early 1-0 lead. McArdle kept his
composure and retired the next six hitters before
giving up a single with two outs in the third in
ning, the only other hit he gave up in his three in
nings of work.
Second baseman Danny Diekroeger got the
Cardinal on the board in the third inning when his
opposite-field single into left plated Locher from
second. Brian Ragira would advance Diekroeger

to second with a single as the potential go-ahead
run but Diekroeger was left stranded there when
senior designated hitter Justin Ringo flew out to
right field.
Stanford quickly took the lead in its half of
the fourth inning when it capitalized on having
runners on second and third with nobody out.
Freshman third baseman Drew Jackson's
groundout to the right side scored Slater from
third and Whiting's first hit of the afternoon
plated sophomore Dominic Jose on the next play,
giving the Cardinal a 3-1 lead that it would not
relinquish.
Schmidt, the winning pitcher, hurled three in
nings in which he gave up one run on four hits.
