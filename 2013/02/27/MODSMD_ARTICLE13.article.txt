# In need of Maples' magic

### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the Stanford men's basket
ball team prepares for its last two
games in Maples Pavilion this
year, it finds itself in the all-too
familiar position of playing for lit
tle more than pride and a meager
chance at a magical run.
A win against Colorado (18-8,
8-6 Pac-12) this Wednesday
would do little for the Cardinal's
meager chance at an NCAA
Tournament bid, but an opportu
nity to avenge its most lopsided
loss of the season should provide
motivational fuel for the second
to last home game of the season.
In the teams' previous meet
ing, Colorado thrashed Stanford
75-54. The Buffaloes took over
the game early, breaking open a
15-point lead by halftime and
holding Stanford to its fewest
point total of the season.
Colorado has gone 5-2 since

then, a run that includes wins
over No. 24 Oregon and No. 11
Arizona, but a loss to Utah. Stan
ford, meanwhile, has gone a lack
luster 5-4
Even if Stanford (16-12, 7-8
Pac-12) wins its final two games,
the only shot to make the NCAA
Tournament would be to win the
Pac-12 Tournament. Considering
Stanford's 1-4 mark against the
conference's trifecta of top teams
Arizona, Oregon and UCLA
â€”, that will be a tough challenge.
The Cardinal could improve
its seed for the tournament with
wins, though. It currently sits in
a tie with Washington for eighth
place, but it is two games behind
three teams in the standings.
However, with Stanford ex
pected to get the dreaded call to
defend its title at the NIT Tour
nament, expect younger players
to have expanded roles in the up-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is currently
tied with Washington for eighth
place in the Pac-12 standings, but
the team hopes to turn the mo
mentum with a win against sixth
placed Colorado tonight. The Pac
12 Tournament will begin in Las
Vegas in two-weeks time and now
represents the Cardinal's only pos
sible route to March Madness.

Sophomore guard Chasson Randle (5) struggled at Colorado earlier this season, shooting just 5-of-21,
but he is looking to turn Stanford's season momentum against the Buffs at Maples tonight.
