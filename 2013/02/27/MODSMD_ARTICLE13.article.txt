# In need of Maples' magic
## 
### DAVID PEREZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the Stanford men's basket
ball team prepares for its last two
games in Maples Pavilion this
year, it finds itself in the all-too
familiar position of playing for lit
tle more than pride and a meager
chance at a magical run.
A win against Colorado (18-8,
8-6 Pac-12) this Wednesday
would do little for the Cardinal's
meager chance at an NCAA
Tournament bid, but an opportu
nity to avenge its most lopsided
loss of the season should provide
motivational fuel for the second
to last home game of the season.
In the teams' previous meet
ing, Colorado thrashed Stanford
75-54. The Buffaloes took over
the game early, breaking open a
15-point lead by halftime and
holding Stanford to its fewest
point total of the season.
Colorado has gone 5-2 since

then, a run that includes wins
over No. 24 Oregon and No. 11
Arizona, but a loss to Utah. Stan
ford, meanwhile, has gone a lack
luster 5-4
Even if Stanford (16-12, 7-8
Pac-12) wins its final two games,
the only shot to make the NCAA
Tournament would be to win the
Pac-12 Tournament. Considering
Stanford's 1-4 mark against the
conference's trifecta of top teams
Arizona, Oregon and UCLA
—, that will be a tough challenge.
The Cardinal could improve
its seed for the tournament with
wins, though. It currently sits in
a tie with Washington for eighth
place, but it is two games behind
three teams in the standings.
However, with Stanford ex
pected to get the dreaded call to
defend its title at the NIT Tour

to have expanded roles in the up-

GAME NOTES: Stanford is currently
tied with Washington for eighth
place in the Pac-12 standings, but
the team hopes to turn the mo
mentum with a win against sixth
placed Colorado tonight. The Pac
12 Tournament will begin in Las
Vegas in two-weeks time and now
represents the Cardinal's only pos
sible route to March Madness.

Sophomore guard Chasson Randle (5) struggled at Colorado earlier this season, shooting just 5-of-21,
but he is looking to turn Stanford's season momentum against the Buffs at Maples tonight.
coming games since they
have few direct postseason
implications.
It didn't matter who was
in the rotation during the
last meeting with Colorado,
as the entire team was held
to 31.3 percent shooting. No
starter shot above 50 per
cent from the floor, head
lined by a 5-of-21 night from
sophomore guard Chasson
Randle, though he did have
15 points.
The only players to make
at least half of their shots
from the floor were junior
forward Josh Huestis and
freshman forward Rosco
Allen, who both hit 2-of-4,
and senior guard Gabriel
Harris, who made his lone
shot.
Colorado in comparison
shot 52.6 percent from the
field as a team with all five
of its starters scoring in
double digits. The major
threat from the Buffs was
junior forward Andre
Roberson, who dominated
the boards to the tune of 20
rebounds to go along with
12 points and three blocks.
Nobody for Stanford
managed more than seven
rebounds, although early
foul trouble for Heustis

was a big factor in the lack
of paint presence.
Now the Card at least
has a chance for redemp
tion. Huestis and junior for
ward Dwight Powell are ac
customed to success on the
boards and on the blocks
and so may well have per
sonal points to prove.
Both Huestis and Powell
have nine double-doubles
on the season, making them
the only teammates in the
country to have at least
eight each. Huestis is aver
aging just a hair under 10
rebounds for the entire
season and with a strong
finish he could average a
double-double with points
and rebounds, making him
the first Stanford player to
do so since Curtis Bor
chardt 'O2 in the 2001-02
season.
For the less hopeful this
last weekend will be about
personal statistics and
preparing for a return to
NIT glory. For the wishful
thinkers it could just be
about building momentum
for the Pac-12 Tournament
and perhaps a March Mad
ness miracle.
Stanford will tip off
against Colorado in Maples
Pavilion at 8 p.m. PT tonight,
with the contest broadcast
live on ESPN2 and KZSU.

Even if Stanford (16-12, 7-8

The Cardinal could improve

GAME NOTES: Stanford is currently
tied with Washington for eighth
place in the Pac-12 standings, but
the team hopes to turn the mo
mentum with a win against sixth
placed Colorado tonight. The Pac
12 Tournament will begin in Las
Vegas in two-weeks time and now
represents the Cardinal's only pos
sible route to March Madness.


MICHAEL KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore guard Chasson Randle (5) struggled at Colorado earlier this season, shooting just 5-of-21,
but he is looking to turn Stanford's season momentum against the Buffs at Maples tonight.
coming games since they
have few direct postseason
implications.
It didn't matter who was
in the rotation during the
last meeting with Colorado,
as the entire team was held
to 31.3 percent shooting. No
starter shot above 50 per
cent from the floor, head
lined by a 5-of-21 night from
sophomore guard Chasson
Randle, though he did have
15 points.
The only players to make
at least half of their shots
from the floor were junior
forward Josh Huestis and
freshman forward Rosco
Allen, who both hit 2-of-4,
and senior guard Gabriel
Harris, who made his lone
shot.
Colorado in comparison
shot 52.6 percent from the
field as a team with all five
of its starters scoring in
double digits. The major
threat from the Buffs was
junior forward Andre
Roberson, who dominated
the boards to the tune of 20
rebounds to go along with
12 points and three blocks.
Nobody for Stanford
managed more than seven
rebounds, although early
foul trouble for Heustis

was a big factor in the lack
of paint presence.
Now the Card at least
has a chance for redemp
tion. Huestis and junior for
ward Dwight Powell are ac
customed to success on the
boards and on the blocks
and so may well have per
sonal points to prove.
Both Huestis and Powell
have nine double-doubles
on the season, making them
the only teammates in the
country to have at least
eight each. Huestis is aver
aging just a hair under 10
rebounds for the entire
season and with a strong
finish he could average a
double-double with points
and rebounds, making him
the first Stanford player to
do so since Curtis Bor
chardt 'O2 in the 2001-02
season.
For the less hopeful this
last weekend will be about
personal statistics and
preparing for a return to
NIT glory. For the wishful
thinkers it could just be
about building momentum
for the Pac-12 Tournament
and perhaps a March Mad
ness miracle.
Stanford will tip off
against Colorado in Maples
Pavilion at 8 p.m. PT tonight,
with the contest broadcast
live on ESPN2 and KZSU.
