### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER

two very strong performances, it split the
matches, losing to BYU in five before de
feating Cal Baptist 3-1.

On Saturday night, No. 5 Stanford (10-
6, 7-6 MPSF) took on No. 2 BYU (11-3,10-
2 MPSF). While the Cougars were cer
tainly favored, Stanford had won six
straight over BYU, despite being under
dogs in four of those contests.
The Cardinal came out hot, starting
the first set with a 7-4 run, but the
Cougars immediately countered, eventu
ally evening the score at 10 apiece. Both
sides traded points, unable to gain an ad
vantage over the other. With the score
even at 23, Stanford caught a break when
BYU star junior outside hitter Taylor
Sander committed an error. The Cardinal
immediately seized the opportunity to win
the set, as sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly aced the Cougars.
The second set was again tight, with
Stanford slightly edging BYU early. Up
23-20, the Cardinal seemed to be firmly in
control, but BYU demonstrated why it is
the second-ranked team in the nation. A
Sander kill and Stanford error brought
the Cougars within one before three
straight BYU blocks gave the Cougars the
25-23 set victory and evened the match at
one apiece.
Despite the poor end to the second set,
Stanford was certain it could stick with the
Cougars and again held a close lead
throughout the third. Up just 22-21, Stan
ford junior outsider hitter Steven Irvin
fired his seventh third-set kill through the
Cougar defense. Stanford closed the third
like the first, as a Sander error paved the
way for an ace from freshman setter
James Shaw, giving Stanford the 2-1 ad
vantage.
Stanford's second-set collapse ensured
it now still had more volleyball to play, as
the match headed to four. Both teams
were again deadlocked early, but BYU be
gan to pull away. The Cardinal rallied to
within one, with BYU up just 21-20, before
Sander and freshman teammate opposite
hitter Ben Patch took over,
combining for three kills in
the next five points as BYU
won 25-22.
The match was therefore
headed into a fifth set, which,
in keeping with the entirety
of the match thus far, was
close throughout. Stanford
was ahead 10-9 before BYU
seized control with three
straight points and put the
game out of reach. The
Cougars held off Stanford to
capture the set 15-13 and pull
out an improbable match vic
tory.
It was certainly a match
of what-ifs, as Stanford cer
tainly could have secured the
victory with a stronger clos
ing performance in the sec
ond set.
"I thought we played a
good match. Some of the best
volleyball we've played so
far," head coach John Kosty
told GoStanford.com.
The Cardinal hit .354 as a
team, one of their strongest
performances of the season.
Irvin had 23 kills, hitting an
incredible .486, as well as
seven digs. Junior opposite
hitter Brian Cook also added
23 kills and seven digs, while
junior middle blocker Eric

Mochalski continued his
strong play since returning
to the starting lineup with
eight kills on .462 hitting, as
well as five digs and two
blocks. Shaw also had anoth
er great performance, put
ting up a career-high 60 as
sists, while chipping in three
kills and eight digs.
Stanford was severely
outperformed at the net, as it
had just nine blocks com
pared to BYU's 24. The Car
dinal defense was strong oth
erwise, however, with 45
digs.
After the disappointing
loss, Stanford traveled from
snowy Utah to sunny Cali
fornia to take on No. 13 Cal
Baptist (6-8, 3-6 MPSF). The
powerful offense demon
strated against the Cougars
was certainly not on display
in the first set on Monday
night, as Stanford hit just
.036. Despite this, the Cardi
nal hung tight with the
Lancers, losing 25-21.
The second set was close
until Irvin put on a dominant
show. With Cal Baptist up 9-
8, Irvin unleashed a powerful
kill before stepping back to
serve. At the service line, he
had three aces in four at
tempts, giving Stanford a
lead it would not relinquish.
The Cardinal would ulti
mately take the set 25-18.
The third set was closer,
with Stanford holding a

slight lead throughout. Cal
Baptist tied the match up at
21 apiece, but a Lancers serv
ice error would give the Car
dinal the lead again. Kills
from Irvin and Cook would
put Stanford on the verge of
a set victory, before another
Irvin ace put Stanford up 2-1.
Stanford needed just a
fourth set victory to end its
two-game losing streak. The
Cardinal offense completely
broke out, as Stanford hit
.565, cruising to a 25-21 set
victory.
Cook led the way with 13
kills, while Irvin chipped in
eight kills and six service
aces, one shy of the Stanford
all-time record. The middle
hitter tandem of Mochalski
and fellow junior Denny
Falls both had great games,
as Mochalski had nine kills
on .600 hitting, while Falls
had eight kills, hitting .800.
Stanford returns home
next week, with rematches
against No. 4 Pepperdine (8-
5,8-5 MPSF) and No. 9 USC
(3-8, 3-8 MPSF). Both teams
defeated the Cardinal in
their last meetings, so Stan
ford will be looking for re
venge. The matches will take
place at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, with Stanford fac
ing Pepperdine on Saturday
and USC on Sunday.

kills, while Irvin chipped in
eight kills and six service
aces, one shy of the Stanford
all-time record. The middle
hitter tandem of Mochalski
and fellow junior Denny
Falls both had great games,
as Mochalski had nine kills
on .600 hitting, while Falls
had eight kills, hitting .800.
Stanford returns home
next week, with rematches
against No. 4 Pepperdine (8-
5,8-5 MPSF) and No. 9 USC
(3-8, 3-8 MPSF). Both teams
defeated the Cardinal in
their last meetings, so Stan
ford will be looking for re
venge. The matches will take
place at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, with Stanford fac
ing Pepperdine on Saturday
and USC on Sunday.

The No. 4 Stanford women's swimming and diving team will attempt to win its third
conference title in four years at the Pac- 12 Championships, which kicks off this afternoon.
This weekend, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team was back on the road again,
taking on BYU and Cal Baptist. Despite
two very strong performances, it split the
matches, losing to BYU in five before de
feating Cal Baptist 3-1.

On Saturday night, No. 5 Stanford (10-
6, 7-6 MPSF) took on No. 2 BYU (11-3,10-
2 MPSF). While the Cougars were cer
tainly favored, Stanford had won six
straight over BYU, despite being under
dogs in four of those contests.
The Cardinal came out hot, starting
the first set with a 7-4 run, but the
Cougars immediately countered, eventu
ally evening the score at 10 apiece. Both
sides traded points, unable to gain an ad
vantage over the other. With the score
even at 23, Stanford caught a break when
BYU star junior outside hitter Taylor
Sander committed an error. The Cardinal
immediately seized the opportunity to win
the set, as sophomore middle blocker
Spencer Haly aced the Cougars.
The second set was again tight, with
Stanford slightly edging BYU early. Up
23-20, the Cardinal seemed to be firmly in
control, but BYU demonstrated why it is
the second-ranked team in the nation. A
Sander kill and Stanford error brought
the Cougars within one before three
straight BYU blocks gave the Cougars the
25-23 set victory and evened the match at
one apiece.
Despite the poor end to the second set,
Stanford was certain it could stick with the
Cougars and again held a close lead
throughout the third. Up just 22-21, Stan
ford junior outsider hitter Steven Irvin
fired his seventh third-set kill through the
Cougar defense. Stanford closed the third
like the first, as a Sander error paved the
way for an ace from freshman setter
James Shaw, giving Stanford the 2-1 ad
vantage.
Stanford's second-set collapse ensured
it now still had more volleyball to play, as
the match headed to four. Both teams
were again deadlocked early, but BYU be
gan to pull away. The Cardinal rallied to
within one, with BYU up just 21-20, before
Sander and freshman teammate opposite
hitter Ben Patch took over,
combining for three kills in
the next five points as BYU
won 25-22.
The match was therefore
headed into a fifth set, which,
in keeping with the entirety
of the match thus far, was
close throughout. Stanford
was ahead 10-9 before BYU
seized control with three
straight points and put the
game out of reach. The
Cougars held off Stanford to
capture the set 15-13 and pull
out an improbable match vic
tory.
It was certainly a match
of what-ifs, as Stanford cer
tainly could have secured the
victory with a stronger clos
ing performance in the sec
ond set.
"I thought we played a
good match. Some of the best
volleyball we've played so
far," head coach John Kosty
told GoStanford.com.
The Cardinal hit .354 as a
team, one of their strongest
performances of the season.
Irvin had 23 kills, hitting an
incredible .486, as well as
seven digs. Junior opposite
hitter Brian Cook also added
23 kills and seven digs, while
junior middle blocker Eric

Mochalski continued his
strong play since returning
to the starting lineup with
eight kills on .462 hitting, as
well as five digs and two
blocks. Shaw also had anoth
er great performance, put
ting up a career-high 60 as
sists, while chipping in three
kills and eight digs.
Stanford was severely
outperformed at the net, as it
had just nine blocks com
pared to BYU's 24. The Car
dinal defense was strong oth
erwise, however, with 45
digs.
After the disappointing
loss, Stanford traveled from
snowy Utah to sunny Cali
fornia to take on No. 13 Cal
Baptist (6-8, 3-6 MPSF). The
powerful offense demon
strated against the Cougars
was certainly not on display
in the first set on Monday
night, as Stanford hit just
.036. Despite this, the Cardi
nal hung tight with the
Lancers, losing 25-21.
The second set was close
until Irvin put on a dominant
show. With Cal Baptist up 9-
8, Irvin unleashed a powerful
kill before stepping back to
serve. At the service line, he
had three aces in four at
tempts, giving Stanford a
lead it would not relinquish.
The Cardinal would ulti
mately take the set 25-18.
The third set was closer,
with Stanford holding a

slight lead throughout. Cal
Baptist tied the match up at
21 apiece, but a Lancers serv
ice error would give the Car
dinal the lead again. Kills
from Irvin and Cook would
put Stanford on the verge of
a set victory, before another
Irvin ace put Stanford up 2-1.
Stanford needed just a
fourth set victory to end its
two-game losing streak. The
Cardinal offense completely
broke out, as Stanford hit
.565, cruising to a 25-21 set
victory.
Cook led the way with 13
kills, while Irvin chipped in
eight kills and six service
aces, one shy of the Stanford
all-time record. The middle
hitter tandem of Mochalski
and fellow junior Denny
Falls both had great games,
as Mochalski had nine kills
on .600 hitting, while Falls
had eight kills, hitting .800.
