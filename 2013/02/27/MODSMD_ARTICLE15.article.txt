## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN A 						Response to Nate Boswell and ResEd 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Effective now, and until Suites
officially remains independ
ent, this weekly column will
now be an update on the situation
at Suites Dining.
Before I continue, I would like
to formally apologize for some of
the fliers distributed at the Save
Suites protest two days ago. I'll be
very specific: I apologize for the
Zac Sargeant/Nick Peters "broth
ers-in-erime" flier that was distrib
uted. It was over-the-top and justi
fiably received negative feedback
from attendees. As the de facto or
ganizer of the event, I take full re
sponsibility for not personally
screening all the fliers beforehand
to check them for appropriateness
and respect. It will not happen
again.
Second, a big thank-you to those
of you who showed up including
ResEd Associate Dean Nate
Boswell, who courageously stepped
up and took a lot of flak from an an
gry crowd (and from me marching
around with a megaphone). That
takes a certain willingness to en
gage with student discontent, and I
(and others present at the protest)
appreciated that very much.
Boswell's response in yester
day's Daily, unfortunately, provided
few additional answers to students'
questions, and the answers we did
get were misleading. I'd like to re
spectfully set the record straight.
First, Mr. Boswell claimed that
Suites is "more expensive by $6OO
- than what
students in most residences pay for
board." That claim is misleading
because it compares apples to or
anges; the cheaper residences to
which Boswell referred are conven
tional freshman-style dorms, which
have always been cheaper but do
not afford their residents the au
tonomy, managerial experience and
living environment that are the rea
sons Stanford developed independ
ent living in the first place. Suites
board bill costs are actually, as I
pointed out in my original article,
nearly identical to those of other
similarly independent student-run
houses on campus, and we provide
more food for the same price
($5,999 per student per year for 17
meals per week in Suites, $5,992 for
10 meals per week on the corpo
rate-managed Row.)
Second, Mr. Boswell claimed
that there are three lawsuits pend
ing against GCDS and the Univer
sity. That claim is also misleading
and rhetorically inflates the volume
of legal actions actually ongoing; all
three lawsuits were filed by the
same person at the same time for
the same set of reasons. And as his
letter to the editor today demon
strates, that one person unequivo
cally opposes Res Ed's decision to
use his lawsuit as leverage against
Suites Dining student manage
ment.
Furthermore, eliminating any
entity which has a lawsuit filed
against it, regardless of the law
suit's merit (on which I cannot
legally comment), seems to make
little sense. I can talk about law
suits against the many third-party
entities that operate on this campus
all day long. Why is it only Suites
Dining, the long-standing student
nonprofit with an otherwise clean
record, to whom the "a lawsuit has
been filed, therefore we're auto
matically getting rid of you" stan
dard is applied?
Third, Boswell did not mention
that, as I documented in my origi
nal article, Res Ed's ostensible
health and safety concerns are un
supported by the actual data.
Other than that, Boswell didn't
give me any other substantive
points to refute, so I'm done de
fending Suites' record a record
that doesn't seem to need any more
defending. But besides the absence
of factual data to justify the Suites
takeover, there's something else
missing from Boswell's reply: an
apology.
There has been no apology for
regularly delaying payments to
vendors for weeks, causing them to
complain to Suites student man
agers.
There has been no apology for
forgetting to pay Bollard's water
bill in September and only reim
bursing Flunk for paying that bill
four months later, in January.
There has been no apology for
delaying the reimbursement of a
club manager for his stereo pur
chase for over a month and a half.
There has been no apology from
R&DE for failing to fix the infra
structure for which they are re
sponsible a well-documented list
of failures about which I could go
into great detail (email me).

There has been no apology for
failing to pay Suites hashers for
over two months many of whom,
from personal experience and con
versation, needed the money very
much and very quickly.
There has been no apology from
ResEd Assistant Director Zac
Sargeant for barging into, and
shutting down, a private meeting
of SOS workers trying to organize
for higher wages from his brother
in-law's company, in blatant viola
tion of Stanford's own Living Wage
Policy.
There has been no apology for
completely failing to notify Suites
residents of Res Ed's decision to
end student management, for fail
ing to consult them in any way
about the dismissal of their long
serving chefs before making that
decision, or for attempting to make
that decision behind closed doors
and only discussing it at all after a
newspaper expose, 2,500 petition
signatures, and a 120-person mass
march.
There has been no apology for
telling a reporter false information
that there were multiple fires at
Suites, for example, when there
were not.
There has been no apology for
failing to send Student Affairs Offi
cer Tiffany Taylor, who is supposed
to supervise Suites regularly, to vis
it all year.
There has been no apology for
emptying the Suites Eating Clubs
carryover fund, used to pay for
emergency chef health benefits and
capital expenditures, without any
explanation or warning, causing
managers' summer checks to
bounce.
We as students deserve at least
some semblance of an apology from
ResEd, because these are not the
high professional standards we as
Stanford students have come to ex
pect and enjoy from our excellent
Stanford administrators, the vast
majority of whom do wonderful,
high-quality work on the job every
day.
But instead of an apology from
ResEd, we got an attempt at a cov
er-up —an attempt to make it
seem as though Res Ed's mistakes
had never happened. The manager
who purchased the stereo in De
cember finally got his reimburse
ment check this weekend with
no apology for the delay. Tiffany
Taylor was finally spotted at Suites
after a year's near-complete ab
sence. And Suites managers have
suddenly begun receiving helpful
emails from R&DE with overly
friendly emoticons in them, no less.
It isn't Suites' residents turn to
explain our actions anymore. It's
your turn now, ResEd and R&DE,
to explain your actions to the stu
dent body.
Suites residents and managers
know we have responsibilities as
students who want to live and work
independently responsibilities
to keep a clean living environment,
to pay our chefs a living wage, to
deliver high-quality food. Suites
managers have —as any look at
the specific data will tell you met
those responsibilities.
You have responsibilities too,
Res Ed. Responsibilities to pay
your bills on time, to tell the truth,
to adhere to Stanford policy and to
communicate clearly with students.
We hope that as we move for
ward toward a solution with which
all parties can be happy a solu
tion we all want and can agree upon
ResEd keeps those responsibili
ties in mind too.

It's your turn
now, ResEd and
R&DE, to explain
your actions to
the student body.
