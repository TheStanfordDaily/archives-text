# OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD

U TTTe have no idea the
\/\l demons people face or
V V how they're faring
against them" (Paul Madonna, "All
Over Coffee").
I found this quote in a book of il
lustrations by SF Chronicle car
toonist Paul Madonna and promptly
tore it out and framed it on my wall.
Some days the words slip my atten
tion beside photographs of my fam
ily and the tally-mark scoreboard I
made to try to accomplish a New
Year's resolution to be more patient
(current score: Renee: 16, Impa
tience: 14). Other days I intentional
ly ignore the tiny frame, if I'm feel
ing especially stubborn or petty.
Every day, these words are relevant
and challenging to live by.
If you want words to live by, they
are not hard to find. We all have
Gandhi and Eleanor Roosevelt com
mitted to memory, not to mention
stockpiles of occasion-specific spin
offs on the trite "Keep Calm and
Carry On," conveniently printed on
coffee mugs and bro tanks. I bring
up Paul Madonna's words because I
find them practically useful when
Gandhi and Roosevelt fall short.
This is a time of year littered with
chaotic to-do lists, nervous break
downs and misunderstandings.
Winter quarter, things fall apart.
The words above might help the

center hold.
The drag about feeling stressed,
lonely, overwhelmed or depressed is
rarely the feeling itself. It's the cas
cade of shitty events that always
seem to congregate around a bad
mood like iron filings around a mag
net. You've all been there: "I got in
a fight with my roommate, I got a 50
percent on my p-set, my boyfriend
was too busy to hang out, my Mom
is nagging me to call my doctor and
my best friend and I aren't talking
because he hates me."
In isolation from each other, each
of these might feel manageable. But
their cumulative effect feels like the
universe kicking you to the curb.
The toughest thing about days like
this these is that they are rarely
caused by events in your control.
Notice that everything wrong with
the hypothetical day above, with the
exception of 50 percent on your p
set, has to do with other people.
Other people are messy. They
come with their own baggage, their
own contexts, their own demons.
And we can't know what those
demons are, or how other people are
handling them. You get a handful of
people who are privately struggling
with their own problems bumping
into each other and making a traffic
jam. It can feel like your roommate
is mad at you, your boyfriend is ig

noi'ing you or your best friend hates
you, when none of that is actually
true. The result is a host of missed
meanings, occluded connections and
bad timing resulting in misplaced
blame.
I do it all the time. I am too busy
or too stressed or too impatient to
hash out what is really happening
between my peers and me. I misun
derstand, I withdraw and I end up
isolated from the people I love when
I need them most.
I implore you: when it's week
eight of winter quarter and you find
yourself overwhelmed, don't re
treat. Imagine the demons other
people are facing. If your roommate
is acting short-tempered, try not to
take it personally. If you can do so
without irritating any raw wounds,
ask her what's going on. See how
she's doing. This campus can get
lonely. Classes here are strenuous.
If you take the time to see where
other people are coming from, you
may still be stressed and spread too
thin, but at least you'll be in good
company.
