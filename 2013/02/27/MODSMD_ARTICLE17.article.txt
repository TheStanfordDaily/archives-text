## Suites Eating Clubs offer potential for business education 
### 
To the Editor:
I ran one of the Suites Eating
Clubs during my senior year (1987),
and I'm disappointed that the Uni
versity is making this change.
I'd like to point out that the op
portunity of running an Eating
Club is one of the few real-life busi
ness lessons you can learn at school.
It was similar to running a restau
rant, and you learn more from the
day-to-day operations of a business
than you do in any classroom.
In fact, running the Eating Club
was one of the experiences that
triggered my transition from engi
neering into business. While I got
my degree at Stanford engineering,
I went on to get my MBA, obtained
my CPA in public accounting and
continued to progress my finance
career.
Without a doubt, one of the sem
inal experiences which started that
progression was running one of the
Suites Eating Clubs at Stanford.
It piqued my interest in business
and provided me the opportunity to
explore them with limited risk. I've
long believed education takes many
forms and that you learn as much
outside the classroom as inside, and
it's unfortunate that the University
it taking away one of those outside
the-classroom learning experiences
from its students.
I don't know of any other oppor
tunity in which an undergraduate
with little or no background in food
service could run a small business,
get exposure to the real world chal
lenges and perhaps find a career
path. While I understand there are
risks that perhaps the University is
concerned about, I'd argue that
with the right controls and over
sight, there should have been a so
lution that mitigated the risks yet
retained the ability to have student
management, and learning, which I
believe is the University's mission.
