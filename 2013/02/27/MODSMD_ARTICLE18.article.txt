# My lawsuit shouldn't be used against Suites Dining
## 
### 
It's true that I filed a complaint
against Governor's Corner Dining
Societies (GCDS) and Stanford be
cause after four years of loyal serv
ice and an injury at work, I feel that
I was fired unjustly.
But having the same fate be
ing fired be visited on Frank,
Tony, Dennis and Caroline because
of my lawsuit is certainly not what I
asked for. I didn't ask Stanford to
hire an outside contractor to run
Suites dining halls or fire my for
mer colleagues.
In fact, I opposed those efforts
back in 2010-2011.
Also, it does not seem right they
would make all these changes be
cause of me.
When a worker makes a legal
claim, as I have, the normal re
sponse should not be to fire the rest
of the staff, or to send the business
to an outside contractor.
The economics of my lawsuit

can't be the real reason for this
change. Stanford has a $4.4 billion
dollar budget and a $l7 billion-dollar
endowment, and I suspect Stanford
has its own insurance covering
claims like mine. Stanford raised
over $1 billion in donations last year.
By contrast, I earned about as
much as one undergraduate pays
per year for tuition, room and
board.
I've heard that Stanford wanted
GCDS to have its own insurance,
but if they need insurance, they
should get insurance, not fire the
chefs!
What I would like to see Stan
ford and GCDS do is take responsi
bility for the damage this has done
to my life and make sure these sorts
of things don't happen to others.
I think changes do need to be
made to address the problems I
raised, like better employment poli
cies and training, but there is no
reason to punish the chefs or for
Stanford to hire an outside compa
ny to start from scratch!
