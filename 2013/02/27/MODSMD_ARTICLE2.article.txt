# Union president faces re-election challenge
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DEPUTY EDITOR 
The local union that represents
service and technical workers at
Stanford University, the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory and
Santa Clara University will hold its
biennial leadership elections tomor
row.
The Stanford polling place at
the Parking and Transportation
Services building on Bonair Siding
will be open from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The union the roughly 1,300-
member Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU) Local 2007
has entered a voluntary compli
ance agreement with the Depart
ment of Labor's Office of Labor-
Management Standards (OLMS) to
hold the leadership election before
March 1, 2013, in accordance with
the union's bylaws.
Paul Regalado, the union's cur
rent president and a steward for
SLAC, will contest the election
against Chris McGilvery, a steward
for the grounds maintenance de
partment.
Regalado was appointed as the
union's interim president in 2007 by
the SEIU International President
after it came to light that then-pres
ident Jose Escanuela had been con
victed of embezzlement less than 13
years before assuming the union
presidency, in a violation of the La
bor-Management Reporting and
Disclosure Act. Regalado was sub
sequently re-elected to the post.
According to a letter from
OLMS to Regalado, OLMS' in
volvement arose from controversy
surrounding an Oct. 27,2011, union
leadership election. The validity of
that election was challenged, and an
OLMS investigation found that
SEIU Local 2007 had "denied a
member in good standing the right

to run for office by using a candida
cy requirement which required a
member to be in continuous good
standing for more than two years
prior to nominations," the letter
said.
Regalado said that the union en
tered the voluntary partnership
with the Department of Labor
which he described as being "pretty
rough" —to avoid a costly legal
process following the allegations
made by Regalado's opponent,
McGilvery.
"In order to stop further litiga
tion, we agreed to allow them to
come on board, but that in no sense
admitted on our part any wrongdo
ing," Regalado said. "Matter of fact,
the reason why we did allow them
to come in is because we didn't want
to spend any more money any
more union membership money
on the frivolous accusations that
he's throwing at us."
The Department of Labor has
not initiated legal proceedings
against SEIU Local 2007 over the
challenged election in light of the
agreement to conduct the Thursday
election. However, the Department
of Labor has reserved the right to
take legal action at any point before
April 1.
Campaigns' contrasting views
McGilvery, who served as a
union organizer in 2005 and a collec
tive bargaining agreement ratifica
tion team member in 2009, ex
pressed concern that voter turnout
may be low due to low levels of
awareness. He added that current
union leadership had distributed
election information in regular
union mailers that members rou
tinely toss out before reading.
"It's like anything else the pres-

workers about the election during their break on Monday afternoon.
ent leadership does,"
McGilvery said. "They tried
to keep information to them
selves."
Despite the McGilvery
campaign's concerns about
turnout, Tony Ruiz,
McGilvery's campaign man
ager, said that he is confident
in McGilvery's chances in the
election given the Depart
ment of Labor's administra
tive oversight of the voting
process, which he said would
ensure a fair election. Ruiz
claimed that McGilvery will
be the next union president,
barring a freak accident.
By contrast, Regalado
said that he has observed
widespread awareness about
the election while campaign
ing and claimed that voters
generally favor his candidacy.
"The level of awareness is
very high," Regalado said.
"They all know about the
campaign ... about the elec
tion process."
"The feeling that I'm get
ting from the workers is that
they have positive comments
to me but negative comments
about my counterpart," he
continued.
Regalado said that he has
campaigned in dining halls,
craft shops and on the
grounds as well as at SLAC,
Santa Clara University and
Cardinal Cogent. On the cam
paign trail, he has focused ex
tensively on the apprentice
ship program established last
year in which apprentices ac
quire State of California,
Stanford and community col
lege certifications over the
course of a four-year pro
gram.

Beyond the election
With a collective bargain
ing cycle in the next year, Re
galado said that he has also
focused on the contract nego
tiation and the process of de
veloping a contract commit
tee.
He asserted that while the
number of grievances from
workers in the union has been
very high recently, many of
those grievances have been
settled to both party's satis
faction.
"We've had ... very large
amounts of grievances in the
past year alone where... 95
percent of them have turned
out favorably, not only to the
union but as well to Stanford,
meaning that we come to a
consensus where both parties
get what they want," Regala
do said.
The top item on
McGilvery's platform is to
end the use of interspace bar
gaining, the practice used to
negotiate the union's last col
lective bargaining agree
ment. According to
McGilvery, the practice does
not allow for the involvement
of third parties, such as medi
ators, in the model of inter
space bargaining implement
ed between Stanford and
SEIU Local 2007.

The practice also creates
limited transparency in the
collective bargaining process,
according to Ruiz.
The union first started ne
gotiating with Stanford using
interspace bargaining and its
accompanying process, inter
space problem-solving, after
current Vice President for
Human Resources David
Jones arrived at the Univer
sity, according to McGilvery.
In the last round of collec
tive bargaining, the union's
bargaining team was prohib
ited from speaking with me
dia because of the interspace
bargaining model, according
to McGilvery. He said that, if
elected, he would like to open
the process back up to the
media and to students in or
der to achieve transparency.
"The union never wins
when it's an argument,"
McGilvery said. "What's the
use of interspace problem
solving if the management al
ways wins?"
Speaking on behalf of
Jones, University spokes
woman Lisa Lapin declined
to respond to McGilvery's as
sertions, saying that it would
be inappropriate for the Uni
versity to be perceived as in
fluencing a union election by
commenting on part of a can
didate's platform.
McGilvery also hopes to
reduce the number of steps it
takes to reach the top pay
grade to five from the current
10, to link vacation days to
seniority rather than hours
worked, as takes place cur
rently, and to address several
problems faced by dining
workers such as work done
outside of their pay scale and
employment during Universi
ty closures.
"The biggest gripe I've
heard on the campaign trail is
that this union is too close to
management and that this
union never came that close
to management until David
Jones came," McGilvery said.
Ruiz added that he hopes
McGilvery, if elected, will act
as a better voice for the SEIU
Local 2007 members when
problems arise with manage
ment.
"Members are not being
represented by anybody be
cause management is in bed
with the leadership of the
union," he said.
Dan Gazzano, a former
groundskeeper, has cam
paigned on campus for
McGilvery and agreed with
Ruiz that a main goal of the
McGilvery campaign is to re
store rank-and-file union
members as the organiza
tion's focus.
"We're just trying to give
this union back to the workers
who pay for it," Gazzano said
of his support for McGilvery.
Gazzano is currently in
volved in legal proceeding
against the University and
SEIU Local 2007 for wrong
ful termination after he acted
as a whistleblower and in
formed his superiors of Es
canuela's prior embezzlement
record.

He asserted that while the
number of grievances from
workers in the union has been
very high recently, many of
those grievances have been
settled to both party's satis
faction.
"We've had ... very large
amounts of grievances in the
past year alone where... 95
percent of them have turned

meaning that we come to a

The top item on
McGilvery's platform is to
end the use of interspace bar
gaining, the practice used to
negotiate the union's last col
lective bargaining agree
ment. According to
McGilvery, the practice does
not allow for the involvement
of third parties, such as medi
ators, in the model of inter
space bargaining implement
ed between Stanford and
SEIU Local 2007.

The practice also creates
limited transparency in the
collective bargaining process,
according to Ruiz.
The union first started ne
gotiating with Stanford using
interspace bargaining and its
accompanying process, inter
space problem-solving, after
current Vice President for
Human Resources David
Jones arrived at the Univer
sity, according to McGilvery.
In the last round of collec
tive bargaining, the union's
bargaining team was prohib
ited from speaking with me
dia because of the interspace
bargaining model, according
to McGilvery. He said that, if
elected, he would like to open
the process back up to the
media and to students in or
der to achieve transparency.
"The union never wins
when it's an argument,"
McGilvery said. "What's the
use of interspace problem
solving if the management al
ways wins?"
Speaking on behalf of
Jones, University spokes
woman Lisa Lapin declined
to respond to McGilvery's as
sertions, saying that it would
be inappropriate for the Uni
versity to be perceived as in
fluencing a union election by
commenting on part of a can
didate's platform.
McGilvery also hopes to
reduce the number of steps it
takes to reach the top pay
grade to five from the current
10, to link vacation days to
seniority rather than hours
worked, as takes place cur
rently, and to address several
problems faced by dining
workers such as work done
outside of their pay scale and
employment during Universi
ty closures.
"The biggest gripe I've
heard on the campaign trail is
that this union is too close to
management and that this
union never came that close
to management until David
Jones came," McGilvery said.
Ruiz added that he hopes
McGilvery, if elected, will act
as a better voice for the SEIU
Local 2007 members when
problems arise with manage
ment.
"Members are not being
represented by anybody be
cause management is in bed
with the leadership of the
union," he said.
Dan Gazzano, a former
groundskeeper, has cam
paigned on campus for
McGilvery and agreed with
Ruiz that a main goal of the
McGilvery campaign is to re
store rank-and-file union
members as the organiza
tion's focus.
"We're just trying to give
this union back to the workers
who pay for it," Gazzano said
of his support for McGilvery.
Gazzano is currently in

against the University and
SEIU Local 2007 for wrong

as a whistleblower and in
formed his superiors of Es

record.

The local union that represents
service and technical workers at
Stanford University, the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory and
Santa Clara University will hold its
biennial leadership elections tomor
row.
The Stanford polling place at
the Parking and Transportation
Services building on Bonair Siding
will be open from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The union the roughly 1,300-
member Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU) Local 2007
has entered a voluntary compli
ance agreement with the Depart
ment of Labor's Office of Labor-
Management Standards (OLMS) to
hold the leadership election before
March 1, 2013, in accordance with
the union's bylaws.
Paul Regalado, the union's cur
rent president and a steward for
SLAC, will contest the election
against Chris McGilvery, a steward
for the grounds maintenance de
partment.
Regalado was appointed as the
union's interim president in 2007 by
the SEIU International President
after it came to light that then-pres
ident Jose Escanuela had been con
victed of embezzlement less than 13
years before assuming the union
presidency, in a violation of the La
bor-Management Reporting and
Disclosure Act. Regalado was sub
sequently re-elected to the post.
According to a letter from
OLMS to Regalado, OLMS' in
volvement arose from controversy
surrounding an Oct. 27,2011, union
leadership election. The validity of
that election was challenged, and an
OLMS investigation found that
SEIU Local 2007 had "denied a
member in good standing the right

to run for office by using a candida
cy requirement which required a
member to be in continuous good
standing for more than two years
prior to nominations," the letter
said.
Regalado said that the union en
tered the voluntary partnership
with the Department of Labor
which he described as being "pretty
rough" —to avoid a costly legal
process following the allegations
made by Regalado's opponent,
McGilvery.
"In order to stop further litiga
tion, we agreed to allow them to
come on board, but that in no sense
admitted on our part any wrongdo
ing," Regalado said. "Matter of fact,
the reason why we did allow them
to come in is because we didn't want
to spend any more money any
more union membership money
on the frivolous accusations that
he's throwing at us."
The Department of Labor has
not initiated legal proceedings
against SEIU Local 2007 over the
challenged election in light of the
agreement to conduct the Thursday
election. However, the Department
of Labor has reserved the right to
take legal action at any point before
April 1.
Campaigns' contrasting views
McGilvery, who served as a
union organizer in 2005 and a collec
tive bargaining agreement ratifica
tion team member in 2009, ex
pressed concern that voter turnout
may be low due to low levels of
awareness. He added that current
union leadership had distributed
election information in regular
union mailers that members rou
tinely toss out before reading.
"It's like anything else the pres-

ent leadership does,"
McGilvery said. "They tried
to keep information to them
selves."
Despite the McGilvery
campaign's concerns about
turnout, Tony Ruiz,
McGilvery's campaign man
ager, said that he is confident
in McGilvery's chances in the
election given the Depart
ment of Labor's administra
tive oversight of the voting
process, which he said would
ensure a fair election. Ruiz
claimed that McGilvery will
be the next union president,
barring a freak accident.
By contrast, Regalado
said that he has observed
widespread awareness about
the election while campaign
ing and claimed that voters
generally favor his candidacy.
"The level of awareness is
very high," Regalado said.
"They all know about the
campaign ... about the elec
tion process."
"The feeling that I'm get
ting from the workers is that
they have positive comments
to me but negative comments
about my counterpart," he
continued.
Regalado said that he has
campaigned in dining halls,
craft shops and on the
grounds as well as at SLAC,
Santa Clara University and
Cardinal Cogent. On the cam
paign trail, he has focused ex
tensively on the apprentice
ship program established last
year in which apprentices ac

veloping a contract commit
