# Union president faces re-election challenge
## 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DEPUTY EDITOR 
The local union that represents
service and technical workers at
Stanford University, the SLAC Na
tional Accelerator Laboratory and
Santa Clara University will hold its
biennial leadership elections tomor
row.
The Stanford polling place at
the Parking and Transportation
Services building on Bonair Siding
will be open from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The union the roughly 1,300-
member Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU) Local 2007
has entered a voluntary compli
ance agreement with the Depart
ment of Labor's Office of Labor-
Management Standards (OLMS) to
hold the leadership election before
March 1, 2013, in accordance with
the union's bylaws.
Paul Regalado, the union's cur
rent president and a steward for
SLAC, will contest the election
against Chris McGilvery, a steward
for the grounds maintenance de
partment.
Regalado was appointed as the
union's interim president in 2007 by
the SEIU International President
after it came to light that then-pres
ident Jose Escanuela had been con
victed of embezzlement less than 13
years before assuming the union
presidency, in a violation of the La
bor-Management Reporting and
Disclosure Act. Regalado was sub
sequently re-elected to the post.
According to a letter from
OLMS to Regalado, OLMS' in
volvement arose from controversy
surrounding an Oct. 27,2011, union
leadership election. The validity of
that election was challenged, and an
OLMS investigation found that
SEIU Local 2007 had "denied a
member in good standing the right

to run for office by using a candida
cy requirement which required a
member to be in continuous good
standing for more than two years
prior to nominations," the letter
said.
Regalado said that the union en
tered the voluntary partnership
with the Department of Labor
which he described as being "pretty
rough" â€”to avoid a costly legal
process following the allegations
made by Regalado's opponent,
McGilvery.
"In order to stop further litiga
tion, we agreed to allow them to
come on board, but that in no sense
admitted on our part any wrongdo
ing," Regalado said. "Matter of fact,
the reason why we did allow them
to come in is because we didn't want
to spend any more money any
more union membership money
on the frivolous accusations that
he's throwing at us."
The Department of Labor has
not initiated legal proceedings
against SEIU Local 2007 over the
challenged election in light of the
agreement to conduct the Thursday
election. However, the Department
of Labor has reserved the right to
take legal action at any point before
April 1.
Campaigns' contrasting views
McGilvery, who served as a
union organizer in 2005 and a collec
tive bargaining agreement ratifica
tion team member in 2009, ex
pressed concern that voter turnout
may be low due to low levels of
awareness. He added that current
union leadership had distributed
election information in regular
union mailers that members rou
tinely toss out before reading.
