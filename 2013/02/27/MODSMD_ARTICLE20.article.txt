# Card aiming for third Pac- 12 title in four years
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every member of the Stanford women's
swimming and diving team knows that every
practice and every regular-season meet has
been leading up to this, the moment they've
been waiting for all year: the championship
meets.
"Our preparation is always for the Pac-12
and NCAA championships," said Stanford
head coach Greg Meehan. "We've been
preparing since September for our NCAA
championships and that's always been our fo
cus."
No. 4 Stanford (7-2, 4-1 Pac-12) will swim
for its third conference title in four years over
the four-day championship tournament,
which begins this afternoon and ends on Sat
urday. The Cardinal was the Paeific-10 con
ference champion in 2010 and 2011 and fin
ished in a very close second to eventual na
tional champion Cal last February. Stanford
will hope to continue its streak of success this
week.
The Pac-12 conference this year is ab
solutely loaded with talent and the Cardinal
will face multiple teams in what is undoubted
ly one of the deepest conferences in the na
tion for women's swimming.
Stanford's competition includes No. 1
USC, No. 2 Cal, No. 6 Arizona, No. 14 UCLA
and No. 25 Arizona State, a pool of competi
tors that have had their own successful sea
sons and will not go down easily.
Having already defeated Arizona, Arizona
State, UCLA and USC this season in dual
meet settings, the Cardinal, which owns the
best in-conference record, has shown that it is
one of the biggest threats in the competition.
However, championship meets are very

different from the dual meets that the team
has been competing in for the past few
months. Dual-meet success does not by any
means translate to success against the same
teams on the championship stage. The pres
sure on individual swimmers is much higher
and the team must have a very strong all
around performance in order to take home
the title.
Three-time AIl-American senior Andi
Murez, who swam solid races at last year's in
augural Pac-12 Championship, will hope to
build off of past success and deliver an impact
performance in her final conference champi
onship meet. Experienced junior Maya Dißa
do, the defending conference champion in the
200-yard backstroke, will also look to contin
ue her winning ways.
Sophomore sprinter Maddy Schaefer and
versatile junior Felicia Lee have also enjoyed
consistent success down the stretch for Stan
ford and hope that their regular-season form
will carry into the championship meet. Their
continued success, as well as consistent per
formances from junior diver Stephanie
Phipps, will be key to Stanford's success
starting for the next few days.
In the end, it will take the Cardinal's best
performance of the year to outswim some of
the top teams in the nation, including the
country's No. 1 and No. 2 schools, in this
championship meet. The teams that Stanford
defeated earlier this year will be eager to
have their chance at retribution and will be
swimming with increased determination with
a conference title at stake.
But then again, this is what the Cardinal
has been preparing for all year.
