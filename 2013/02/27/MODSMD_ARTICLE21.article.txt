# Card falls to rival Gators
## Women's tennis drops road test 
### ANNA BLUE STAFF WRITER 
For the Cardinal women's
tennis team, this past week
end yielded mixed results. A
fantastic 5-2 win against No.
18 Clemson (3-4) on the road
on Saturday was unfortu
nately overshadowed by a
frustrating loss to rival No. 4
Florida (6-1) on Sunday. Al
though both were important
matches against top-ranked
teams for No. 13 Stanford (4-
2), the Florida loss was espe
cially bitter because of the ri
valry between the two dy
namic programs.

The loss made a dent in
the overall Stanford-Florida
series, which Stanford con
tinues to lead 17-13. Yet, the
loss now stands in the way of
Stanford's previously clear
path to the NCAA Champi
onships and the disappoint
ment of the 4-2 decision halt
ed the growing momentum of
the women in preparation for
the rest of the season. Stan
ford now sits a mediocre
record of 4-2, but has yet to
start Pac-12 play.
The consistent effort of
the doubles teams, a deter
mining factor in the win
against Clemson, was not
enough to put Stanford on
top over the Gators. Al
though Stanford took the
lead early in the Florida
match with doubles points
scored by the No. 1 team
combo of juniors Kristie Ahn
and Nicole Gibbs and by the
No. 2 team combo of senior
Stacey Tan and sophomore
Ellen Tsay, Florida tied the
match even at 1-1 after fresh
man Lindsay Kostas fell 6-2,
6-2 to Gators junior Olivia
Janowicz. Overall, Ahn and
Gibbs have a 3-2 record as a
doubles pairing, while Stacey
Tan and Ellen Tsay are 12-5.
In addition to their Flori
da doubles win, Ahn and
Gibbs contributed greatly to
the Clemson contest, winning

their No. 1 and 2 singles
matches. However, Ahn was
beaten in straight sets by
Florida junior Sofie Oyen
and Stanford freshman
Krista Hardeback, who com
bined with teammate senior
Natalie Dillon in a remark
able 8-0 win against Clemson
as the No. 3 doubles team,
surrendered a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3
loss to the Gators' junior
Alexandra Cercone.
Tsay played a crucial role
in both contests, finalizing
the 5-2 defeat of Clemson
with a crushing 6-0, 6-2 win
over freshman Ani Miao and
then keeping hopes of the
Cardinal alive against the
Gators. Her 6-2, 6-2 win over
Florida's Danielle Collins,
pushed Stanford back ahead
of the Gators, but the devas
tating combination of losses
for Ahn and Hardeback
sealed the Cardinal's fate.
Florida managed to con
tinue its 111-match winning
streak at home, adding an
other one in the win column
of its run. The usually consis
tent and confident Cardinal
women have had a shaky
start, but it is too early to tell
how this year will turn out.
Coming up, Stanford will
face California (4-3) on Sat
urday at home in its first Pac
-12 match of the season. The

Cardinal is usually strong at
home, evidenced by its 184
game home-winning streak
in 2011, which was brought to
an end by Florida in the title
match. Stanford will hope to

rally and put the frustrating
loss to the Gators behind it
before Saturday's contest.
