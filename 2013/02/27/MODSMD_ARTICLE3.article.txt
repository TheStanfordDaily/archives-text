# CAPS addresses grad life
## Graduate students cite unique mental health challenges 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The diverse range of mental
health issues experienced by gradu
ate students has complicated ef
forts by the Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) to
serve the graduate community, ac
cording to graduate students.
Graduate students account for
40 percent of visits to CAPS coun
selors in 2011, though 31 percent of
those using CAPS services de
clined to state their affiliation. The
1,054 graduate students who visit
ed CAPS in 2011 make up 11.9 per
cent of the total graduate student
population.
Wendy Ni M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7,
the Graduate Student Council's
health advocate, said that the
graduate community faces mental
health struggles that are markedly

different from those of the under
graduate community.
"We're very, very diverse," Ni
said.
Ni cited the spread of graduate
students across various degree lev
els and schools, as well the large
international contingent, as com
plicating factors.
"They have different pressures,
different plans, different chal
lenges," Ni said. "And we're, in a
way, decentralized."
According to Ni, the current
lack of a centralized feedback sys
tem for graduate students has hin
dered efforts to address graduate
students' mental well-being issues.
"As a whole I find it very diffi
cult to know what overwhelming
issues there are from graduate
students," Ni said.
However, she identified two
challenges common among gradu

ate students obtaining funding
and research positions as con
tributing to mental health strug
gles.

In an effort to address those is
sues, the office of the Vice Provost
for Graduate Education has put on
several workshops for graduate
students. One such workshop, ti
tled "How to Feel as Bright and
Capable as They Think You Are,"
addressed the issue of imposter
syndrome, in which high-achieving
students believe they are frauds
and that their success is simply a
fluke.

In addition to professional help,
Ni said that student organizations
and cultural groups within the
graduate community provide grad
uate students with the kind of sup
port they might not find elsewhere.
