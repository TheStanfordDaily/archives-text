# CAPS addresses grad life
## Graduate students cite unique mental health challenges 
### BRITTANY TORREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The diverse range of mental
health issues experienced by gradu
ate students has complicated ef
forts by the Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) to
serve the graduate community, ac
cording to graduate students.
Graduate students account for
40 percent of visits to CAPS coun
selors in 2011, though 31 percent of
those using CAPS services de
clined to state their affiliation. The
1,054 graduate students who visit
ed CAPS in 2011 make up 11.9 per
cent of the total graduate student
population.
Wendy Ni M.S. 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7,
the Graduate Student Council's
health advocate, said that the
graduate community faces mental
health struggles that are markedly

different from those of the under
graduate community.
"We're very, very diverse," Ni
said.
Ni cited the spread of graduate
students across various degree lev
els and schools, as well the large
international contingent, as com
plicating factors.
"They have different pressures,
different plans, different chal
lenges," Ni said. "And we're, in a
way, decentralized."
According to Ni, the current
lack of a centralized feedback sys
tem for graduate students has hin
dered efforts to address graduate
students' mental well-being issues.
"As a whole I find it very diffi
cult to know what overwhelming
issues there are from graduate
students," Ni said.
However, she identified two
challenges common among gradu

ate students obtaining funding
and research positions as con
tributing to mental health strug
gles.

In an effort to address those is
sues, the office of the Vice Provost
for Graduate Education has put on
several workshops for graduate
students. One such workshop, ti
tled "How to Feel as Bright and
Capable as They Think You Are,"
addressed the issue of imposter
syndrome, in which high-achieving
students believe they are frauds
and that their success is simply a
fluke.

In addition to professional help,
Ni said that student organizations
and cultural groups within the
graduate community provide grad
uate students with the kind of sup
port they might not find elsewhere.
Even so, CAPS does of
fer a variety of resources to
help struggling graduate
students increase mental
well-being and stay on top of
their work, according to
CAPS administrators.
Ron Albucher, director of
CAPS, noted the presence of
counseling staff at the Grad
uate Community Center two
days a week with tailored
help for doctoral candidates
who are struggling with pro
crastination and in
creased outreach at the
School of Engineering dur
ing qualifying exams.
Issues surrounding stig
ma from certain cultural
groups within the interna
tional graduate community
also play a role in addressing
mental health issues, Al
bucher said.
"There are issues rang
ing from language, religion
and ethnic backgrounds that
play a role in the willingness
to utilize CAPS services or
potential shame or even ac
knowledgment of mental ill
ness itself," Albucher said.
Ni said she has talked
with CAPS regarding ways
to improve mental health
outreach to the graduate
community through CAPS'
resources.
The Bridge Peer Coun
seling Center has also
worked on devising new
ways to meet the needs of
the graduate community.
"We do a big campaign in
the beginning of winter
quarter where we hand out
giveaways with the Bridge
number on it and we've
talked about doing that in
Rains and Munger and other

graduate residences so that
they know we're there," said
Emily Cohodes 'l3, a course
coordinator at the Bridge.
According to Cohodes,
many graduate students are
simply unaware of the
Bridge's offerings, with only
about five percent of calls re
ceived by the Bridge coming
from graduate students.
"We often get contacted
by grad students to see if
they are able to come to us,
which they absolutely are,"
Cohodes said.
Cohodes also mentioned
that the Bridge requires
counselors to undergo train
ing that includes how to re
spond to the specific needs
of the graduate community.
Some of these specific needs
include stress over qualify
ing exams and marriage is
sues.
"We realize that this is
sort of an untapped commu
nity that we're not really
reaching out to sufficiently
and that's definitely some
thing that we're focusing on
in our outreach campaign,"
Cohodes said.
