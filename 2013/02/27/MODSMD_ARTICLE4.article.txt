## Bechtel boosts grad student outreach Center to host more events, increase programming 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While the Bechtel International
Center frequently helps internation
al graduate students with practical is
sues such as obtaining visas and com
pleting employment training, the
center has struggled to offer those
students an equally important aspect
of the Stanford experience: a sense of
community.
Stanford's international graduate
student population has increased
dramatically in recent years, with in
ternationals currently making up ap
proximately 30 percent of the gradu
ate student population. However,
John Pearson, Bechtel's director, ex
pressed concern that the internation
al graduate community has become
less cohesive as the population ex
panded.
"What we've seen are very
strong, supportive, active interna
tional student organizations based on
country," Pearson said. "Beyond that,
though, is what can Bechtel do, or
maybe other offices, to think about
what it means to be an international
graduate student more globally, not
based on your nationality but based
on the fact that you're an internation
al graduate student."
Pearson partially attributed the
declining sense of community to the
creation of on-campus graduate stu
dent housing. International students
had previously often used Bechtel as
a meeting place or hangout spot in
stead of just a location for events, ac

cording to Pearson.
"When you've got more and more
international graduate students liv
ing on campus, Bechtel's place in
their lives changed a little bit," he
said. "Rather than being a kind of
drop-in place, it becomes a place
where we have more programs."
According to Roshan Shankar
M.S. 'l3 MPA 'l4, Bechtel is located
relatively far away from many of the
graduate student residences, making
it more difficult for international
graduate students to attend the cen
ter's events.
Shankar, who interacted almost
exclusively with other Indian stu
dents during his first two months at
Stanford, said that many students
participate only in programs within
their ethnic community. These events

are often hosted by one of many dif
ferent graduate cultural groups in
stead of being hosted by Bechtel.
"There are a lot of voluntary stu
dent organizations that do a lot of
events, but most are either divided by
their ethnicity, their country or spe
cial interests," he said. "When you
come from a different county and
spend four years of undergrad in a
different country, you are sort of ac
customed to the way things are back
home and tend to flock to the people
from your home country."
Ateeq Suria M.S. 'l3 Ph.D. 'l6
the international student representa
tive on the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) agreed.

grounds tend to initially hang
out with people from their cul
ture," Suria said. "When stu
dents are new and experienc
ing culture shock, they feel
more comfortable being
around students who they can
communicate with on a more
comfortable level."
Although Shankar, Pear
son and Suria all agreed that
self-segregation inhibits the
formation of a cohesive inter
national graduate student
community, they had differ
ent proposals for how to draw
the community together.
Shankar suggested re

structuring the international
graduate orientation to more
closely resemble the under
graduate New Student Orien
tation. According to Shankar,
one of the primary differ
ences between the under
graduate and graduate inter
national student experience is
that graduate students have
to "actively seek out" events
to connect with the interna
tional community, which can
be difficult for introverts.
"There is a whole welcome
party [for undergraduates],
the Resident Assistants stand
outside and make them feel at
home," Shankar said. "When
I came to Stanford, I had to
go to the housing desk and
pick up my keys and go to my
place alone. You have no con
tacts here, and that's sort of

overwhelming."
Pearson agreed that the
transition to life at Stanford
can often be difficult for inter
national graduate students
and said that Bechtel hopes to
host more events in partner
ship with the GSC to provide
opportunities for internation
al students to socialize.
According to Pearson,
Bechtel administrators have
also had less time to plan
events since the Sept. 11 ter
rorist attacks because admin
istrators have had to focus
more on the regulatory as
pects of bringing internation
al students to campus. Pear
son said that Bechtel has only
recently been able to focus on
programming again, having
hired a part-time program co
ordinator this year.

However, Suria said that
he believes the problem is not
a lack of events but rather
poor attendance at those
events. He suggested that the
events could be marketed bet
ter and further in advance, as
serting that many students
struggle to find time in their
schedules for last-minute
events.
"Perhaps the events could
be scheduled months ahead of
time and students could be
told about them before they
arrive at Stanford so that they
can plan for them," Suria said.
"There is always space to do
more, but at the end of the day,
the responsibility is on the stu
dents to go to the event."
