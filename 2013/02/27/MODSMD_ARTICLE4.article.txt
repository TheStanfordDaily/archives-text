## Bechtel boosts grad student outreach Center to host more events, increase programming 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While the Bechtel International
Center frequently helps internation
al graduate students with practical is
sues such as obtaining visas and com
pleting employment training, the
center has struggled to offer those
students an equally important aspect
of the Stanford experience: a sense of
community.
Stanford's international graduate
student population has increased
dramatically in recent years, with in
ternationals currently making up ap
proximately 30 percent of the gradu
ate student population. However,
John Pearson, Bechtel's director, ex
pressed concern that the internation
al graduate community has become
less cohesive as the population ex
panded.
"What we've seen are very
strong, supportive, active interna
tional student organizations based on
country," Pearson said. "Beyond that,
though, is what can Bechtel do, or
maybe other offices, to think about
what it means to be an international
graduate student more globally, not
based on your nationality but based
on the fact that you're an internation
al graduate student."
Pearson partially attributed the
declining sense of community to the
creation of on-campus graduate stu
dent housing. International students
had previously often used Bechtel as
a meeting place or hangout spot in
stead of just a location for events, ac

cording to Pearson.
"When you've got more and more
international graduate students liv
ing on campus, Bechtel's place in
their lives changed a little bit," he
said. "Rather than being a kind of
drop-in place, it becomes a place
where we have more programs."
According to Roshan Shankar
M.S. 'l3 MPA 'l4, Bechtel is located
relatively far away from many of the
graduate student residences, making
it more difficult for international
graduate students to attend the cen
ter's events.
Shankar, who interacted almost
exclusively with other Indian stu
dents during his first two months at
Stanford, said that many students
participate only in programs within
their ethnic community. These events

are often hosted by one of many dif
ferent graduate cultural groups in
stead of being hosted by Bechtel.
"There are a lot of voluntary stu
dent organizations that do a lot of
events, but most are either divided by
their ethnicity, their country or spe
cial interests," he said. "When you
come from a different county and
spend four years of undergrad in a
different country, you are sort of ac
customed to the way things are back
home and tend to flock to the people
from your home country."

According to Director John Pearson, the role of Bechtel has changed
in recent years with the creation of on-campus graduate housing.
