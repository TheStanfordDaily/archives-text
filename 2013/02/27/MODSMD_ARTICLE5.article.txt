## D.C. program launches new arts track 
### CLARISSE PERALTA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Bing Stanford in Washington Pro
gram (SIW) will offer a new track focused
on visual aids, arts administration and the
ater and performance starting in winter
quarter of 2014.
Richard Meyer, professor of art history
and faculty chair of Stanford in Washing
ton (Arts), said that the idea for this track
originated two years ago when Nancy Troy,
chair of the department of art and ait his
tory, visited the program in Washington,
D.C.
"She immediately recognized the po
tential for an arts internship, as there has
n't been any focus on the museums, per
formances or art galleries in D.C.," Meyer
said. "She thought it was too exciting of an
opportunity to pass by for
Stanford students."
Meyer had taught at the
University of Southern Cali
fornia for 15 years before
coming to Stanford last year.
He was then given the task of
leading the arts program.
"Her idea is extremely ex
citing, and I teach a lot of
courses on American art so it
is a terrific opportunity for
someone who is interested in
those areas," Meyer said.
The program will admit a
maximum of 10 students for
its first quarter. Meyer said
the SIW program has en
tered discussions with about
15 different cultural institu

tions that might sponsor in
ternships.
Those institutions include
the National Endowment for
the Arts, the Phillips Collec
tion, the American Art Maga
zine, the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden and
the National Museum for
Women in the Arts.
"We're hoping to build [as]
big [a] network of contacts as
possible within that land
scape, who'd be happy to have
a Stanford intern work full
time for 10 weeks," Meyer
said.
Jill Vizas '97, on-campus
coordinator for said that
while it was possible to have
an arts internship prior to the
new track's introduction,
there were only a limited
number of classes offered.
"We have had students
who were art and art history

majors intern at places like
the Smithsonian," Vizas said.
"This is just formalizing it
more in terms of course
work."
According to Meyer, there
has been demand from stu
dents for SIW to offer an arts
track.
"Students have knocked
on our door and have asked
for arts internships, so we
know that there's an interest
in that and in D.C., being the
nation's capital," Meyer said.
"The challenge was putting
the two together."
Josie Johnson 'l3, an Art
and Art History major, had
looked for appropriate intern
ships on her own and ex

pressed enthusiasm about the
new track's potential.
"I think it's going to be a
really great opportunity,"
Johnson said. "I'm a senior, so
I'm going to miss out on it but
if it had been around while I
was still here, I definitely
would have done it."
"For students who want to
go into art administration or
film, these opportunities are
really key," Meyer said.
"That's what [the new track]
is adding: not just to be in
Washington for a quarter, but
to develop a crucial credential
for future success."
