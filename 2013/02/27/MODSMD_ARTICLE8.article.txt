## Senate extends elections deadline 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At the Feb. 26 meeting of the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, senators passed a
bill to extend the ASSU elections declara
tion deadline from March 1 to March 8.
Senator Lauren Miller 'l5, one of the
authors of the bill, said that she was con
cerned that so few students had declared
to run for several positions, with a particu
larly notable shortage of class president
slates. Miller also expressed concern that
several special fees groups missed the Feb.
18 deadline to submit budgets because of
difficulty contacting financial managers.
"It came to our attention that there is
n't really that representative of a pool for
elections right now, and this takes care of
special fees too," Miller said. "We feel like
there was a miscommunication all across
the board."
While several members of the Senate
agreed with Miller, representatives from
Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) not
ed that extending the deadline for special
fees would create administrative hassles
and potentially raise student fees.
"Extending the deadline so more peo
ple can make it just results in higher stu
dent fees," said SSE CEO Neveen Mah
moud 'll. "The statistics show that a
group getting voted down on the ballot is
highly unlikely."
Senator Garima Sharma 'l5 argued
that it was not the Senate's job to repri
mand students for missing the special fees
deadline, a statement contested by Mah
moud.
"You're not anyone's mother, but you
are a governing bodyâ€”you were voted
here by the student population," Mah
moud said. "I generally don't think it's a
responsible move to say that it's not your
responsibility to regulate. That's what you
were elected to do."
Elections Commissioner Brianna Pang
'l3 took issue with extending the deadline
for Undergraduate Senate candidates, ref
erencing the fact that 23 candidates have
declared for 15 Senate positions.
"By definition, it is already a competi
tive race for Undergraduate Senate," she
said. "On behalf of the candidates who
have been on their game and petitioning, I
don't think that deadline extension is nec-

essarily fair."
Several senators argued to the con
trary, including Viraj Bindra 'l5, who em
phasized the benefits of a more competi
tive Senate field with more candidates
from which voters can choose. Sharma
agreed, adding that extending some dead
lines and not others would cause confusion.
The Senate ultimately approved the
bill to extend the election declaration of in
tent and petition-gathering deadline to
March 8, with an amendment to push back
the special fees budget submission dead
line to March 1. The Graduate Student
Council will vote on the bill at their meet
ing tonight.
NomCom, Suites and divestment
In other business, senators approved a
bill to appoint seven members to next
year's Nominations Committee (Nom-
Com). Miller said that this year's Nom-
Com is "really representative" of the stu
dent body, as it contains undergraduates,
graduate students and a Ph.D. student.
The Senate also put a bill on previous
notice authored by Daily columnist Miles
Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 and sponsored by
Bindra. If approved at next week's meet
ing, the bill will express the Senate's oppo
sition to Residential Education's (ResEd)
decision to end the student-run Governor
Corner Dining Societies and pledge the
Senate's support of Suites Dining's chefs.
At the meeting, Unterreiner addressed
questions from senators and visitors about
his four-part article and the response he
has received from Res Ed.
"There is massive student support for
this," Unterreiner said. "Pretty uncontro
versially, this would be a good bill for the
Senate to support."
The Senate also heard a presentation
from Alon Elhanan 'l4 in opposition to the
selective divestment presentation made
last week by Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3,
founder and co-president of Stanford Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER).
Shakir's presentation urged senators
to pass a bill encouraging the Board of
Trustees to reconsider investments in
companies that Shakir said violated hu
man rights and international laws. While
Shakir argued that divestment was a hu
manitarian issue, Elhanan disagreed.

"A lot of people argue that it's the only
neutral option. In my opinion, it's not neu
tral, it's inherently political," he said. "It's
impossible to separate selective divest
ment from what is going on in Israel and
Palestine."
Representatives from a variety of stu
dent groups, including the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation, the Black Stu
dent Union and Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) attended the
meeting in support of the bill.
"We are not trying to blame anyone or
ostracize anyone, but there is a system in
place here that we are participating in, and
that system is depriving Palestinians of
their health," said Elizabeth Goodman, a
Ph.D. candidate in mathematics repre
senting Stanford Students for Queer Lib
eration.
Other groups, including the Jewish
Student Organization, Chabad at Stan
ford, the Society for Advancement of Chi
canos and Native Americans in Science
and J Street U Stanford had representa
tives speak against the bill.
Doria Charlson 'l3, president of the
Jewish Student Association, spoke in op
position to the bill, arguing that it would
"irrevocably change the Stanford commu
nity" for the worse.
"It's been increasingly uncomfortable
to identify as a Jew on this campus,"
Charlson said. "We don't know how divest
ment will affect the Middle East, but we do
know how it will affect what is going on
here with us in this room. We've seen the
harm divestment can and has caused on
this campus."
At the end of the meeting, senators vot
ed to table the bill until next week and of
fered attendees the chance to speak with
senators individually outside of the meet
ing.
"Hopefully we're going to have a deci
sion by next week. I know there's some
talk of senators feeling like they'd like to
ask questions," Miller said. "We're really
going to toy to limit it to making a decision
next week or having questions from sena
tors, but discussion is definitely done in
our meetings."
