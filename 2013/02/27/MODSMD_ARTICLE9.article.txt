### 
In "Stanford applicant
chosen as Intel STS finalist"
(Feb. 26), The Daily made
several errors. The subject's
name is Jack Takahashi, not
Jake. He has already re
ceived $8,500 total, not
$l,OOO, and could receive be
tween $20,000 and $lOO,OOO
more. The application, re
search paper and letters of
recommendation mentioned
in the article were submitted
for the Intel contest and not
to Stanford. The Daily re
grets these errors.
