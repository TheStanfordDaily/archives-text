## Men's basketball beaten by the Buffs 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Junior forward Dwight Powell
brought the Maples Pavilion crowd to
its feet twice on Wednesday night with
monstrous dunks. With 2.4 seconds to
play and Stanford down by two, Powell
caught an inbounds pass at the three
point line, took two dribbles and soared
once more for a vicious one-handed
slam. It was majestic, it was stunning,
and it was Sports Center Top Plays
worthy.

And it was too late.
The buzzer sounded and the clock
hit zero with the ball still cradled in
Powell's hands below the rim, allowing
Colorado (19-8, 9-6 Pae-12) to escape
with the win and leaving the Cardinal
(16-13, 7-9) to shake its head at yet an
other loss that featured a missed op
portunity in the closing seconds.
"[Powell] didn't have time," said
head coach Johnny Dawkins after the
game. "He should've laid the ball up. I
thought the move was great. He caught
the ball where we thought he'd catch
the ball. I thought he'd have a chance to
go ahead and get a strong finish, but

the fact that he caught it a little bit fur
ther out, he got bumped on the catch,
and by the time he turned around, time
was being eaten up."
But the road to that final sequence
was almost as interesting as the play it
self.
The Buffaloes held the lead only
once (at 2-0) in the first half thanks to
some awful shooting the Buffs start
ed 2-13 from the field but Stanford
couldn't really find its groove either
and let Colorado climb back into the
game by halftime.
A slim 32-31 lead for the Card at
halftime quickly grew to 10, however,
as sophomore guard Chasson Randle
dropped in a three-pointer from the
corner that got the small crowd into the
game.
Stanford would not score for the
next six minutes, going 1-8 from the
field and turning the ball over twice as
Colorado's 1-2 scoring punch of
Spencer Dinwiddie and Andre Rober
son led an 18-5 run.
Roberson finished with a career
high 24 points, which included 16 in the
second half and a deep three as the shot
clock expired to pull Colorado within
one point at 45-44.
Another triple and layup by Roberson
helped the Buffs seize a 51-45 lead,
sucking the air out of Maples.
