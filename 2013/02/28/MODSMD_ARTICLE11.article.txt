GAME NOTES: Stanford takes its last regular season
road trip before returning to Seattle next weekend
for the Pac-12 Tournament. The Card is currently
tied for first in the conference with rival Cal.

Sophomore point guard Amber Orrange (above) has been
the driving force in initiating Stanford's offense, with 121
assists for the season and averaging 10.4 points per game.
in cardinal and white in Fri
day's 90-53 win over Oregon
State. Tinkle is the second
leading scorer and rebound
er behind junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike with 12.3
points and 6.1 rebounds per
game, and is now Stanford's
34th member of the 1,000-
Point Club.

Ogwumike's record-set
ting performance Sunday
against Oregon won her
recognition with two nation
al honors, as she was named
to the USBWA's Ann Mey
ers Drysdale Award Mid
season Top 20 Watch List
and the Naismith Trophy
Top 30.
Chiney's 24 rebounds
broke the previous school
record for rebounds in a sin
gle game set by her older
sister, Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, and made her only the
sixth player in Stanford his
tory to grab 1,000 rebounds,
which put her into the 1,000-
1,000 Club for points and re
bounds. In addition,
Chiney's 27 points propelled
her to her 52nd career dou
ble-double, a school record.
Washington (19-8, 11-5),
ranked fifth in the Pac-12,
will have to take on Ogwu
mike and the Card without
the defending Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year, sophomore
point guard Jazmine Davis
(19 ppg, 3.24 apg), and red
shirt freshman forward
Talia Walton (13.9 ppg, 7.1
rpg). The pair was suspend-

Ed for one game after violat
ing team rules, so the
Huskies will have to look to
Kristi Kingman (14.1 ppg,
4.8 rpg) to take over. The
senior guard recently broke
her own school record for 3-
pointers in a season with 81.
Stanford should have no
issues with guarding the
perimeter and keeping the
Huskies' scoring to a mini
mum. This whole season the
Cardinal has not allowed a
single team to score more
than 70 points. If the squad
continues to play this style
of shutdown defense, it
could become the first Stan
ford team to not allow an op
ponent to reach 70 points for
an entire season.
In addition, a win tonight
would make this the sixth
straight unbeaten month of
February for the program.
The Card leads the all
time series with Washington
42-14. The teams last met at
last year's quarterfinals of
the Pac-12 Tournament, and
Cardinal won 76-57.
Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer and her team are
looking forward to the
NCAA Tournament and are
treating the remainder of
the season as continued
preparation.
"Number one, we want to
stay healthy. Number two,
we want to get better, we
want to keep improving,"
said VanDerveer. "I'm really
excited about how different
people are coming in. Tess
[Picknell] came in and gave
us, not a lot, but valuable
minutes, coming into [the
game against] UCLA and
scoring. Jasmine Camp, Bon

nie Samuelson, I'm really
happy about how our bench
is improving and contribut
ing. That's something that's
going to be really important
for where we want to go."
Junior guard Sara James
has stepped up for the Card,
entering the starting lineup
for the last bit of the season
with junior guard Toni Ko
kenis still out with an un
known illness.

Sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange has been a
huge driver of the Stanford
offense, with 10.4 points per
game, and leads the team
with 121 assists.
Although Stanford and
Cal are tied for first place in
the conference, if both
teams come out with wins
this weekend, the Cardinal
will earn the first seed spot
in the Pac-12 Tournament,
winning the tiebreaker with
the highest overall winning
percentage.
"This year has been
tremendous and it's really
unfolded well, and we have
so much more we want to
work on and so much more
we want to achieve," Tinkle
said. "I'm just really thank
ful that I'm a special part of
this team, especially this
year. It's exciting that
there's a whole bunch of us
that are rising to the occa
sion and that's going to be
advantageous for all of us."

Sophomore point guard Amber Orrange (above) has been
the driving force in initiating Stanford's offense, with 121
assists for the season and averaging 10.4 points per game.
in cardinal and white in Fri
day's 90-53 win over Oregon
State. Tinkle is the second
leading scorer and rebound
er behind junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike with 12.3
points and 6.1 rebounds per
game, and is now Stanford's
34th member of the 1,000-
Point Club.

Ogwumike's record-set
ting performance Sunday
against Oregon won her
recognition with two nation
al honors, as she was named
to the USBWA's Ann Mey
ers Drysdale Award Mid
season Top 20 Watch List
and the Naismith Trophy
Top 30.
Chiney's 24 rebounds
broke the previous school
record for rebounds in a sin
gle game set by her older
sister, Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike, and made her only the
sixth player in Stanford his
tory to grab 1,000 rebounds,
which put her into the 1,000-
1,000 Club for points and re
bounds. In addition,
Chiney's 27 points propelled
her to her 52nd career dou
ble-double, a school record.
Washington (19-8, 11-5),
ranked fifth in the Pac-12,
will have to take on Ogwu
mike and the Card without
the defending Pac-12 Fresh
man of the Year, sophomore
point guard Jazmine Davis
(19 ppg, 3.24 apg), and red
shirt freshman forward
Talia Walton (13.9 ppg, 7.1
rpg). The pair was suspend-

Ed for one game after violat
ing team rules, so the
Huskies will have to look to
Kristi Kingman (14.1 ppg,
4.8 rpg) to take over. The
senior guard recently broke
her own school record for 3-
pointers in a season with 81.
Stanford should have no
issues with guarding the
perimeter and keeping the
Huskies' scoring to a mini
mum. This whole season the
Cardinal has not allowed a
single team to score more
than 70 points. If the squad
continues to play this style
of shutdown defense, it
could become the first Stan
ford team to not allow an op
ponent to reach 70 points for
an entire season.
In addition, a win tonight
would make this the sixth
straight unbeaten month of
February for the program.
The Card leads the all
time series with Washington
42-14. The teams last met at
last year's quarterfinals of
the Pac-12 Tournament, and
Cardinal won 76-57.
Head coach Tara Van-
Derveer and her team are
looking forward to the
NCAA Tournament and are
treating the remainder of
the season as continued
preparation.
"Number one, we want to
stay healthy. Number two,
we want to get better, we
want to keep improving,"
said VanDerveer. "I'm really
excited about how different
people are coming in. Tess
[Picknell] came in and gave
us, not a lot, but valuable
minutes, coming into [the
game against] UCLA and
scoring. Jasmine Camp, Bon

nie Samuelson, I'm really
happy about how our bench
is improving and contribut
ing. That's something that's
going to be really important
for where we want to go."
Junior guard Sara James
has stepped up for the Card,
entering the starting lineup
for the last bit of the season
with junior guard Toni Ko
kenis still out with an un
known illness.

Sophomore point guard
Amber Orrange has been a
huge driver of the Stanford
offense, with 10.4 points per
game, and leads the team
with 121 assists.
Although Stanford and
Cal are tied for first place in
the conference, if both
teams come out with wins
this weekend, the Cardinal
will earn the first seed spot
in the Pac-12 Tournament,
winning the tiebreaker with
the highest overall winning
percentage.
"This year has been
tremendous and it's really
unfolded well, and we have
so much more we want to
work on and so much more
we want to achieve," Tinkle
said. "I'm just really thank
ful that I'm a special part of
this team, especially this
year. It's exciting that
there's a whole bunch of us
that are rising to the occa
sion and that's going to be
advantageous for all of us."
The Cardinal finishes
regular season play 7 p.m.
