## Buckeyes welcome Stanford 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After earning its first win of
the season against Harvard on
Feb. 24, the Stanford women's
lacrosse team will now hit the road
to take on No. 13 Ohio State on
March 2.
This will be the first road trip of
the season for the Cardinal (1-1),
but Stanford head coach Amy
Bokker is not worried about how
her young squad will handle it.
"Going into [the road trip], with
our younger players, it could be an
advantage we just go and play,"
Bokker said. "Anywhere we go, it's
tough to play on the road, but I
think this team can really handle it
with good energy and make the
adjustments we need."
Last season, Ohio State defeat
ed Stanford 14-10 in Palo Alto.
When it travels to Columbus this
weekend, Stanford will try to use
the momentum earned from an 18-
13 win over the Crimson, during
which the Cardinal dominated in
all facets of play, to overtake the
Buckeyes.
Twelve different players have
scored for Stanford after just two
games on the season. Freshman
Lucy Dikeou leads the way with
five goals to go along with two as
sists, while redshirt junior Rachel
Ozer has recorded four
goals and five assists. Junior
captain Anna Kim has also
posted six points on three as
sists and three goals. Kim
was recently named to the
Tewaarton Award Watch List
along with junior goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz, who has
made eight saves in two
games.
On the defensive end,
Stanford has used high
pressure tactics to force
turnovers and control play.
Junior defender Meg Lern
er tied a school record with 8
draw controls against Har
vard to go along with three
ground balls and one forced
turnover. According to
Bokker, the team will contin
ue to work on its defensive
discipline.
"We were a little late
with our slides and looked

disorganized [against Har
vard]," Bokker said. "From
that standpoint, we didn't
really reach our goals defen
sively, so that's going to be a
good focus going into Ohio
State."
Stanford will need to de
fend well against a prolific
Buckeye attack. Ohio State
averaged nearly 14 goals a
game while earning two
wins in the team's first four
matches.
Last night, the Buckeyes
lost to No. 8 Notre Dame,
13-8. On Feb. 16, the Fight
ing Irish came back from a
7-2 halftime deficit to defeat
the Cardinal 12-10 in Stan
ford's season opener.
The Buckeyes already
have three players with dou
ble-digit point totals, led by
junior Katie Chase's 11
goals. Ohio State's Jackie Ci
farelli is another attacker to
watch out for, as the sopho
more has collected 12 assists
to go along with four goals.
"Defensively, being able
to stay on the cutter will be

really important because I
think they like to feed the
ball a lot," Bokker said.
Ohio State sophomore
Tori DeScenza has started
all four games in goal for the
Buckeyes this year, al
though two other players
have made appearances in
net. Last year, DeScenza
made saves on 12 Stanford
shots as the Buckeyes upset
the Cardinal.
"I remember their goalie
being very good last year,"
Bokker said. "We'll continue
to fine-tune our shooting this
week."
One cause for concern for
the Cardinal is the health of
midfielder Hannah Farr. The
sophomore left the game
against Harvard with her
forearm in a brace and her
status for Saturday's game
is unknown.
The game in Columbus
will begin at 9 a.m. PST on
Saturday.
