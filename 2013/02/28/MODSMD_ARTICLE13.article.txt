# SWEET SPRING START
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a 2013 Rose Bowl victory, Stanford
football is back in action, beginning the first of its
two spring practice sessions. For head coach
David Shaw, this day could not come soon

enough.
"It's such a cliche to say that it's like Christ
mas," Shaw said after Monday's practice, "but af
ter being on airplanes and doing recruiting and
then sitting in the office and doing scheme evalu
ation ... to get back on the field is just like, 'thank
goodness.' This is what we enjoy, and I told the

guys if you're wired the right way, you've been ex
cited all day today and we've got enough guys
that felt that way."
According to Shaw, the first practice of 2013
went a lot better than last year's opener. One
year after leaving the practice field visibly upset,
Shaw was all smiles after a practice filled with "a
lot of energy."
Three positional battles for center, outside
linebacker and running back appear to be the
big story of spring practice. After only one prac
tice, the battle to replace departing fifth-year
senior captain Sam Schwartzstein has gained
some clarity.
Two of the four competitors for the starting
job, sophomore Graham Shuler and junior Kevin
Reihner, will miss the first session of spring prac
tice due to disciplinary reasons and an injury, re
spectively.
That leaves fifth-year senior Khalil Wilkes
and senior Conor McFadden to split all of the
reps of the first session. Shaw plans to "wear
them out" with all of the reps he will give them
over the next two weeks.
The rep advantage, combined with experience
from starting at left guard in 2012, may give
Wilkes an insurmountable lead in the race for the
starting center role. Wilkes' move back to the in
side seems to be going smoothly so far.
"I thought it was a pretty good day today"
Wilkes said. "I've still got to get my snaps down
with some of the quarterbacks. I feel like I'm
pretty comfortable with Hogan and Crower right
now, but I've got to get my snaps in with all of the
