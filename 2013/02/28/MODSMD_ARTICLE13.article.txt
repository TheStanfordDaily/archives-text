# SWEET SPRING START
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off a 2013 Rose Bowl victory, Stanford
football is back in action, beginning the first of its
two spring practice sessions. For head coach
David Shaw, this day could not come soon

enough.
"It's such a cliche to say that it's like Christ
mas," Shaw said after Monday's practice, "but af
ter being on airplanes and doing recruiting and
then sitting in the office and doing scheme evalu
ation ... to get back on the field is just like, 'thank
goodness.' This is what we enjoy, and I told the

guys if you're wired the right way, you've been ex
cited all day today and we've got enough guys
that felt that way."
According to Shaw, the first practice of 2013
went a lot better than last year's opener. One
year after leaving the practice field visibly upset,
Shaw was all smiles after a practice filled with "a
lot of energy."
Three positional battles for center, outside
linebacker and running back appear to be the
big story of spring practice. After only one prac
tice, the battle to replace departing fifth-year
senior captain Sam Schwartzstein has gained
some clarity.
Two of the four competitors for the starting
job, sophomore Graham Shuler and junior Kevin
Reihner, will miss the first session of spring prac
tice due to disciplinary reasons and an injury, re
spectively.
That leaves fifth-year senior Khalil Wilkes
and senior Conor McFadden to split all of the
reps of the first session. Shaw plans to "wear
them out" with all of the reps he will give them
over the next two weeks.
The rep advantage, combined with experience
from starting at left guard in 2012, may give
Wilkes an insurmountable lead in the race for the
starting center role. Wilkes' move back to the in
side seems to be going smoothly so far.
"I thought it was a pretty good day today"
Wilkes said. "I've still got to get my snaps down
with some of the quarterbacks. I feel like I'm
pretty comfortable with Hogan and Crower right
now, but I've got to get my snaps in with all of the

young guys. I thought I did pretty
well with communicating. I'm just
trying to take this spring ball to re
ally be better with communicating
with the offensive line."
The other two battles could go
much longer into the spring. Senior
Anthony Wilkerson was the heavy
favorite to replace departing senior
Stepfan Taylor as the starting tail
back, but everything changed with
Tyler Gaffney's decision to return to
the gridiron. Gaffney will be eligible
for the second session of spring
practice starting April 1, giving
Wilkerson two weeks to gain an
edge in the battle.
"You've just got to take life how it
is sometimes," Wilkerson said about
his reaction to Gaffney's return to

the football team. "It's not a good or
a bad thing. It's good in a sense that
it's going to push me, it's going to
push the other running backs. Gaff
wants playing time just like the rest
of us, so it's just going to make us
better."
The third heated battle to watch
the fight to start alongside fifth
year senior Trent Murphy at outside
linebacker features three players
with very different 2012 experiences.
Junior Kevin Anderson spent
last season as the fourth member of
the outside linebacker rotation. He
saw regular playing time but not as
much as many second-teamers be
cause of the extended time received
by departing fifth-year senior Alex
Debniak.
Senior Blake Lueders spent 2012
on the sideline after back surgery
ended his season before it began.
Lueders, an Army All-American out
of high school, saw playing time from
day one on the Farm, but he has yet

to crack the starting lineup.
Then there is James Vaughters,
who started at inside linebacker at
the beginning of 2012 before falling
to second string on the depth chart
after the rise of senior A. J. Tarpley.
Though his season was disappointing
by many accounts, the junior can
take some of his experiences with
him to improve his play on the out
side.
"I learned the playbook a lot bet
ter playing inside," Vaughters said.
"It's just a matter of getting used to
[playing outside linebacker] again."
For those seeking to get a look at
the 2013 team for themselves, Stan
ford hosts its first open practice of
the season Saturday from 9:40-11:40
a.m. The Cardinal has scheduled
three open practices and the Cardi
nal & White Spring Game during
the spring practice season.

The other two battles could go
much longer into the spring. Senior
Anthony Wilkerson was the heavy
favorite to replace departing senior
Stepfan Taylor as the starting tail
back, but everything changed with
Tyler Gaffney's decision to return to
the gridiron. Gaffney will be eligible
for the second session of spring
practice starting April 1, giving
Wilkerson two weeks to gain an
edge in the battle.
"You've just got to take life how it
is sometimes," Wilkerson said about
his reaction to Gaffney's return to

the football team. "It's not a good or
a bad thing. It's good in a sense that
it's going to push me, it's going to
push the other running backs. Gaff
wants playing time just like the rest
of us, so it's just going to make us
better."
The third heated battle to watch
the fight to start alongside fifth
year senior Trent Murphy at outside
linebacker features three players
with very different 2012 experiences.
Junior Kevin Anderson spent
last season as the fourth member of
the outside linebacker rotation. He
saw regular playing time but not as
much as many second-teamers be
cause of the extended time received
by departing fifth-year senior Alex
Debniak.
Senior Blake Lueders spent 2012
on the sideline after back surgery
ended his season before it began.
Lueders, an Army All-American out
of high school, saw playing time from
day one on the Farm, but he has yet

to crack the starting lineup.
Then there is James Vaughters,
who started at inside linebacker at
the beginning of 2012 before falling
to second string on the depth chart
after the rise of senior A. J. Tarpley.
Though his season was disappointing
by many accounts, the junior can
take some of his experiences with
him to improve his play on the out
side.
"I learned the playbook a lot bet
ter playing inside," Vaughters said.
"It's just a matter of getting used to
[playing outside linebacker] again."
For those seeking to get a look at
the 2013 team for themselves, Stan
ford hosts its first open practice of
the season Saturday from 9:40-11:40
a.m. The Cardinal has scheduled
three open practices and the Cardi
nal & White Spring Game during
the spring practice season.
