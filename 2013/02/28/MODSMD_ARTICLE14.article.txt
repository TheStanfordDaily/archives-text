## THE 						AMERICAN ANATOMY A 						discussion on feminism 
### Adam Johnson 
I believe in recognizing and real
izing the equality of women and
men. According to some, that
would make me a feminist. And yet,
it is important to differentiate theo
ry from reality. In theory, feminism
is about equal rights. In reality,
however, a decidedly different pic
ture emerges a picture wherein
the notion of equal rights for men is
often ignored or even mocked by
the modern feminist movement.
I never understood the feminist
rejection of men's rights activists.
The fundamental goal of the men's
rights movement is to ameliorate
discrimination against men in soci
ety, a goal surely in line with the
theoretical definition of feminism.
And men's rights is not an arbi
trary movement: while women are
surely worse off than men in many
facets of society, there are definite
areas in which men are disadvan
taged compared to their female
counterparts.
Prominent examples abound.
Take the criminal justice system,
for instance: for the same crime,
controlling for criminal history and
other background factors, men re
ceive sentences that are 63 percent
longer than women's, according to
a 2012 University of Michigan Law
School study. And while females are
often portrayed as harmed by
America's education system, the
data tell a different story. Accord
ing to a 2008 multinational study,
American girls outperform boys in
reading more than boys outper
form girls in math. And in some
Nordic countries, girls outperform
boys in reading and math. This
gender gap is present in the univer
sity setting, too. While the absence
of females in certain college majors
is well publicized, women earn 57
percent of all bachelor's degrees in
the US overall.
Either females are intrinsically
more intelligent than males, or
males are being discriminated
against in the education systems of
these developed countries. Decades
ago, the opposite was the case, and

feminists placed blame on the sys
tem and cried foul on any sugges
tion of innate differences in intelli
gence. Is it so wrong for men's
rights activists to call attention to
the inequalities emerging today?
And I have yet to mention a sig
nificant area of concern for many in
the men's rights movement: family
policy and law. One such issue is
child custody laws, which men's
rights activists accuse of favoring
mothers. Another is alimony: only
in 1979 did the Supreme Court de
clare it unconstitutional for a state
to have a law that required hus
bands, but not wives, to pay alimo
ny upon divorce.
Flash forward to now, and al
though women increasingly bear
the burden of financial support in
divorce cases, the vast majority of
divorce cases still involve the male
having to give alimony to the fe
male. This disparity becomes a
problem when we consider the fact
that current divorce law is derived
from centuries-old notions and cus
toms and that, until recently, little
attention has been focused on re
form.

Given these and other inequali
ties, some bloggers have adopted
use of the term "female privilege."
This term is a clear reference to the
widely-acknowledged concept of
"male privilege," or the unearned
advantages given to men on the ba
sis of their sex. While I believe in
male privilege, including female
privilege in our discourse sur
rounding gender issues is neces
sary to complete the picture. In
deed, the two concepts are highly
interrelated; one oft-cited example
of male privilege is that a male can
shirk his fatherly duties without be
ing derided by society, yet the sex
ism behind this privilege also ac
counts for males being discriminat
ed against in child custody cases.
Some feminist bloggers criticize
the notion of female privilege be
cause the female "privileges" are
rooted in sexism the fact that fe
males are excluded from the mili
tary draft, for instance, is on ac
count of women being deemed inca
pable of the demands of war. Yet if
we apply the same logic to the male
privilege checklist, we see that
many of the "privileges" listed are
rooted in sexist assumptions of men
being less nurturing and warm

than women.
Other feminists criticize the no
tion of female privilege because, as
one blogger put it, the "status quo
for men is one which grants them
status and power in both the public
and private spheres, whereas the
status quo for women is one which
limits their power to the much
smaller, and more specific, domes
tic sphere." Yet this argument
takes a decidedly middle to upper
class perspective. While competi
tiveness one status quo trait for
males may be of benefit to an ed
ucated male climbing the career
ladder, it is harmful in a context
where people must compete, say to
sell drugs.
Even if we focus on the middle
class male, it is useful to examine
just how much power the status
quo grants him. Take the example
of a married couple that has then
first child. The status quo drives
the female towards the domestic
sphere to raise the child. Since she
now works less, if at all, the hus
band must work more to maintain
their previous financial standing.
Throw in the additional financial
burden of the child, and the male
must work even more. The status

quo thus forces him into working
longer hours at a job that he may
not enjoy but remains in due to its
high pay. Is that power? On paper,
perhaps it is. But in reality, the sta
tus quo forces males (and females, I
should add) to forfeit control over
their lives in order to fulfill their
traditional gender roles.
What I hope to convey with this
piece is that we must draw more at
tention to how males are harmed
by the system if we are to realize a
society where men and women have
equal status, rights and privileges.
We must critically reflect on how
sexist assumptions regarding the
traits and "proper roles" of males
and females serve to negatively af
fect both sexes, albeit in different
ways. We must realize the fact that
the same traits that lead to a high
status male in one context can lead
to jail or death in another. There
are many nuanced discussions to be
had, and the feminists who ignore
or reject interests of men are doing
a disservice to their proposed
cause.
