# CARD READY FOR REMATCHES
## 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is returning to Maples Pavilion
this weekend after four games on the road, a
stretch during which Stanford went 2-2, had
great success and lost in a heartbreaking
ending. No. 5 Stanford (10-6, 7-6 MPSF) is
set to face No. 4 Pepperdine (8-5,8-5) on Sat
urday and No. 9 USC (3-8, 3-8) on Sunday.
The Cardinal hopes to avenge its two early
road losses against both teams.
Stanford is coming off a very tough loss
against No. 2 BYU, in which the Cardinal lost
in five close sets. Though it will be recorded
as a defeat on Stanford's record, the team
showed tremendous improvement and
strength during the match. The young squad,
which had been struggling on the road,
demonstrated that the Cardinal can perform
at high levels on the road and earned confi
dence that it can be competitive with the top
teams in the nation.
This confidence will be very valuable to
the Cardinal this weekend, and Stanford will
have at least one other key advantage in both
of its games: Maples. Stanford is 7-1
at home this season, and has an 11-game win
streak at Maples. Furthermore, USC has
played at home for the last four matches,
making Stanford's home advantage even
stronger.
Over the weekend, Stanford saw strong

offensive performances from its middle
blockers, juniors Denny Falls and Eric
Mochalski. The two players hit a combined
.680, adding to the list of key offensive play
ers who can play leading roles in the games
this weekend. Fellow juniors Brian Cook and
Steven Irvin also continued to demonstrate
their consistency over the weekend, both
posting 23 kills against BYU.
Keys to a Stanford win against Pepper
dine will be starting off aggressively and hav
ing a strong hitting performance, consider
ing that the Waves are also a strong offensive
team. Freshman setter James Shaw, who had
a career-high 60 assists in the BYU game, is
one of the main reasons why the offense has
been playing more consistently. Shaw will be
critical this weekend and must find away to
bring his recent success on the road back to
Maples.
Stanford should try to capitalize on Pep
perdine's shaken confidence, as the Waves
dropped their first home game last weekend
to UCLA. The Cardinal defense will need to
focus on shutting down sophomore Josh Tay
lor, who had a strong performance in Pepper
dine's loss to the Bruins. Stanford has ma
tured as a team during its struggles on the
road and should be better prepared to face
the Waves.
Stanford also lost to USC on the road ear
lier this season. The Trojans have been strug
gling in recent weeks, however, losing seven
of their last eight games.
USC's last four losses have been at home
and they have not traveled for two weeks, so
Stanford is in a better position than it was
when it lost to the Trojans earlier in the sea
son.
Stanford should focus on limiting the of
fensive of Tanner Jansen and Joey Booth,
who have been averaging double-digit kills in
recent games. Josh Kirchner is also a strong
blocking power whom Stanford hitters will
need to work around.
Overall, the Cardinal needs to try to find a
way to carry its recent improvement on the
road into its matches at Maples. The offense
has found consistency, leadership and perse
verance in recent games, coming from behind
and gutting out close victories. The defense
has also proven that it can control top offens
es.
Stanford hopes to extend its home win
ning streak to 13 and regain a winning record
in conference play. The Cardinal squares off
against Pepperdine at 7 p.m. this Saturday,
while its contest with USC is slated for a 7
p.m. start time on Sunday.

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to redeem itself against
the Waves after suffering a 3-1 loss earlier in the
season. Junior middle blocks Denny Falls and Eric
Mochalski were instrumental in the Card's win over
Cal Baptist this past Monday and will be counted
on for another solid performance.

Junior Denny Fells (above) gave a stellar
performance against Cal Baptist the Card's
last time out. His intensity is expected to
propel the Cardinal offense forward in the
rematches against Pepperdine and USC.
