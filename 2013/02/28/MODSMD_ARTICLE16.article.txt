over two tenths of a second behind

place finish for the Cardinal.

victory in the 800-yard freestyle re
lay, beating the rest of field by al
most two seconds. Lee set the tone
with a 1:44.96 opening leg and the
team looked back, with Murez, who
clocked in at 1:43.16, holding off
Cal's Elizabeth Pelton down the
stretch. The Cardinal missed the
Pac-12 Championship record by less
than three tenths of a second.
Stanford amassed 118 points,
just ahead of second-place Arizona
and third-place USC, who have 116
and 110 points, respectively. Defend
ing national champion Cal currently
sits in fourth place with 108 points.

hold on to its slim lead and win its
third conference title in four years.
