## Cuellar's journey to FSI reflects roots 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
"Find something that you can be passionate about and
learn it well," advised Mariano-Florentino Cuellar M.A. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, the recently appointed director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI). Cuellar's il
lustrious career, ranging from Stanford to the White House,
could be characterized by exactly that tenet: deep and intense
study of the nation's most pressing policy issues.
At an early age, Cuellar who will become the director of
FSI in July sought to become "the kind of citizen who
would be involved in civic affairs." Cuellar said that growing
up along the U.S.-Mexico border had a profound influence on
his understanding of the world and prompted his desire to
study politics and governance.
"When you grow up on the border, you realize that a legal
demarcation has such a huge effect in distinguishing one
country from another, for example, and the whole structure of
law shapes who's a citizen and therefore who counts in one so
ciety or another," he said.
