## Cuellar's journey to FSI reflects roots 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN STAFF WRITER 
"Find something that you can be passionate about and
learn it well," advised Mariano-Florentino Cuellar M.A. '96
Ph.D. 'OO, the recently appointed director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI). Cuellar's il
lustrious career, ranging from Stanford to the White House,
could be characterized by exactly that tenet: deep and intense
study of the nation's most pressing policy issues.
At an early age, Cuellar who will become the director of
FSI in July sought to become "the kind of citizen who
would be involved in civic affairs." Cuellar said that growing
up along the U.S.-Mexico border had a profound influence on
his understanding of the world and prompted his desire to
study politics and governance.
"When you grow up on the border, you realize that a legal
demarcation has such a huge effect in distinguishing one
country from another, for example, and the whole structure of
law shapes who's a citizen and therefore who counts in one so
ciety or another," he said.

Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, a former Treasury advisor and
veteran of the Obama administration transition team, will
assume the helm of the Freeman Spogli Institute in July.
Around the time he entered jun
ior high school, Cuellar moved to
Calexico, Calif., in the Imperial Val
ley.
"When you come to a place like
California, you realize that there is an
enormously interesting challenge
that is involved in running a society
a state that works well for so many
millions of people that whether
you're talking about the Imperial Val
ley or Silicon Valley, they share one
government," he said. "They share
one institutional structure that has to
respond to the needs of people who
are from very, veiy different back
grounds. Probably realizing that
made me all the more interested in
public institutions and how they
work."
Encouraged by teachers and his
parents to pursue higher education,
Cuellar enrolled at Harvard Univer
sity as an undergraduate, studying
government and political psychology.
To Cuellar, "the world seemed limit
less," even as his interest in law inten
sified.
"I wasn't certain I wanted to go to
law school until I started realizing
that lawyers have enormous power to
shape what happens in the world with
their words, both written and spoken
words," he said. "I remember I spent
the better part of an afternoon
maybe even a whole day down at
the federal district court in Boston
when I was in college, simply looking
around watching trials and legal pro
ceedings occur, and I became very ex
cited about going to law school."
Cuellar went on to pursue an un
usual set of degrees, earning his J.D.
from Yale Law School and master's
and doctoral degrees from Stanford.
"On the record, I want to make
sure that everyone knows [Harvard
and Yale] pale in comparison to Stan
ford," he said with a laugh. "Stanford
has had a big place in my life for a
long time."
Before completing his Ph.D.,
Cuellar took so me time off to work at
the Treasury Department, where he
was a senior advisor to the Under
Secretary for Enforcement. He de
scribed the experience as a formative
part of his early career.
"[lt was] an incredible opportuni
ty for a young lawyer... to watch pol
icy being made," he said. "But at the
same time, I also felt like you were
facing, in government, a series of con
straints that never fully allowed you
to understand what was happening.
It was that that sort of encouraged
me to think about a chance to be in
academia, so I could study these
problems and teach people about

them and do research on how institu
tions work."
Cuellar said that he has since
sought to combine teaching and aca
demic research with a role in policy
making. After leaving the Treasury
Department and finishing his Ph.D.,
he went on to work at the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, be
fore finally coming back to Stanford
in 2001 as a tenure-track professor at
the Law School.
In 2009, however, Cuellar left
Stanford to work on President
Barack Obama's Domestic Policy
Council at the White House, where
he remained until July of 2010.
Melody Barnes, Obama's former
Director of Domestic Policy, hired
Cuellar after witnessing his work on
Obama's campaign team.
"First of all, he's brilliant," she
said of Cuellar. "He's a brilliant
lawyer, but he's also a brilliant policy
analyst, and he's someone who is able
to take in and very quickly analyze
new issues understand their poli
cy implications, understand the nu
ances and make very strong sugges
tions."
According to Barnes, Cuellar
worked on a variety of policy issues,
including spearheading a process to
reform the food safety system.
"That was a huge, huge deal
something that administrations have
been struggling with for many, many
years," she said. "He was able to help
the process, run it, and to bring it to
an acceptable conclusion and to put
proposals in front of Congress."
Bob Kocher â€”who worked in the
Obama White House on the National
Economic Council collaborated
with Cuellar on several issues, includ
ing Food and Drug Administration
regulation and transparency, the De
partment of Agriculture and world
economic policy Cuellar, Kocher said,
was also a key player in immigration
reform.
"[Our immigration policy efforts]
now are gaining real momentum," he
said, "but it's the ideas that he devel
oped lovingly in the first term of the
administration that I think are going
to see light and lead to great
changes."
Cuellar returned to Stanford in
2010. In 2011 he became co-director
of CISAC, one of 11 research centers
housed under FSI. He will transition
into his new position as director of the
entile institute in July of this year.
Barnes said that Cuellar's policy
experience makes him an extraordi
nary asset to Stanford.
"He hasn't just read about it or
thought about it. [He] has actually
been involved in the policy-making
process at the very highest levels of
the federal government, so he's been
in the trenches and I think he'll bring
that expertise to the table," she said.
"In addition to that, he's a brilliant

scholar and also someone who is ex
tremely curious and who has been ex
pansive over a broad range of areas
of expertise and interest."
According to Kocher, Cuellar is a
global thinker, a strength that com
bines well with his influential position
at FSI.
"There are few people I know in
America who are as broad a thinker,
as great a teacher, as inspiring and
academically as rigorous and creative
as Tino," he said. "[He's] going to
have a massive impact in America for
the next many, many years."
Cuellar said that his advice to
Stanford students who aspire to fol
low in his footsteps is simple: never
underestimate the power of knowl
edge.
"Sometimes, people are so excited
to pursue a career in public service
that they don't stop to fully reflect on
the value of deep knowledge about
some area, whether it be education
policy or arms control or migration or
public health," he said. "That kind of
knowledge is enormously helpful not
only to open up job opportunities but
also to give you instincts for how to
master new areas that you didn't
start with knowledge about, because
you'll know how to ask the subtle
questions that will help you round out
your knowledge of a new problem."
Cuellar said he is greatly excited
by the capacity of FSI to help ad
dress these problems.
"I think this is an institution re
flecting the best of Stanford its
commitment to research, its commit
ment to training leaders, its commit
ment to engaging with the world," he
said. "My hope is to empower people
to do great things."
