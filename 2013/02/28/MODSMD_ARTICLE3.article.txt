# Classes may start at 8:30
## Proposed changes also ban schedules with overlapping classes 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Starting in fall quarter of next year,
students could face 8:30 a.m. class times
for popular courses and be precluded
from scheduling overlapping classes as
part of the plan to ease scheduling con
gestion put forward by University Reg
istrar Tom Black.
"Classes are available at that time
[8:30 a.m.] and they're not used. That's
an asset. If you had an asset and you
wasted it everyday, arguably you would
say 'Why?'" Black said. "We build out
these big beautiful physical plans and we
just throw away the money we spent for
that asset. That doesn't make any
sense."
According to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam, both
the Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies (C-USP) as well as
the Committee on Graduate Studies
have approved Black's proposal. The fi
nal step before the plan's implementa
tion is approval by the Faculty Senate,
which will discuss the issue on March 7.
Black portrayed the changes as ben
eficial to both students and faculty, argu
ing that earlier class times would benefit
athletes and others with substantial
time commitments later in the day. He
also said that faculty with children had
welcomed the earlier schedule because it
would allow them to get home earlier.
"[Athletes and] other groups have
their afternoons filled with all kinds of
activity," Black argued. "If the courses
are only available for a very narrow win
dow and they're on top of each other,
you're not helping anyone."
Despite the proposal's potentially
large impact on students, few students
have been afforded input to date, ac
cording to Black. Instead, he consulted
an advisory committee of 12 students,
appointed by the Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom), and has yet to put for
ward his plan to a larger body of under
graduate or graduate students.
"We asked them if there was any

thing here that would be a showstop
per," Black said. "We know there's a cul
tural practice, but as in all cultures, they
can adapt."
Besides that small focus group, nei
ther Black nor Elam offered any plans
to solicit student input.
"Enrollment opens August 1," Black
said. "When they [students] look at
when the courses are offered, they'll see
that it's been changed."
Black implemented a similar sched
uling change at the University of Chica
go, where he worked as the registrar un
til 2007. Black said there was a very
practical reason for pushing class times
earlier at Chicago the University
lacked classroom space, an issue that is
less pronounced at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has more of a princi
ple that's part of it: the value of teaching,
the proper use of resources, as well as
taking care of the students," Black said.
Reviewing his proposal to eliminate
the ability for students to double-book
classes, Black framed the move as a
means of increasing student focus and
contributions to the class.
"If you have people who are coming
in late or leaving early, what does it say
about the value of teaching? It brings it
down because you're saying 'it doesn't
matter if I'm there,"' Black said. "'I can
skip that fifteen minutes. It does not
matter.' That, to me, is unprincipled."
"On average, one thousand students
or more each quarter had courses that
overlapped. That's something that we
wanted to do away with," Elam said.
"We wanted to get rid of the possibility
of students doing two classes at the
same time."
Elam and Black framed the pro
posed changes as a means of bringing
Stanford's scheduling system in line
with peer institutions. According to
Elam, Stanford's current system is the
"most confusing" among all the schools
he surveyed.
Black noted Stanford's current class
schedule system allows most classes to

run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with many
overlaps. By contrast, Black said peer
institutions have "very few structural
conflicts in the schedules [and are] very
simple."
According to Elam, University ad
ministrators will work with individual
departments to schedule some of the
University's most popular classes at the
new 8:30 a.m. start time. The Program
in Human Biology has already agreed to
move its core classes to an 8:30 a.m. start
time, and Elam expressed hope that
many language classes will also follow
suit.
"We hope that people will use the
early morning time at 8:30 and that
some really popular classes will be held
then," Elam said. "Right now, the cul
ture is that everybody wants to teach ba
sically between 11 and 2, and we just
can't have all our classes then."

University Registrar Tom Black speaks
to the Faculty Senate at their meeting
on Feb. 27. The Report on Managing
Classroom Scheduling proposes
opening up class times at 8:30 a.m.
Student discontent
Even as efforts to support
Black's proposal move ahead, stu
dents expressed concern about the
impact of changes in scheduling on
their academic experience.
"With classes like human biology,
chemistry and other science classes,
you really have to pay attention to
understand the concept," said Rashi
Ojha 'l5, a human biology major. "It
really is hard to pay attention that
early in the morning."
"You [have] got activities at
night, you got homework," Allen Xu
'l5 said. "It's hard to get a start. If
the administration can't change any
of those other things, it can't really
expect changing class times to be a
good idea."
Some students applauded the po
tential changes. Cyerra Holmes 'l6,
a varsity lacrosse player, said that
she has had difficulty finding classes
that do not conflict with practice.
"I haven't been able to take a sin
gle [lntroductory Seminar] because
most of them meet in the afternoon
only, so it's really hard for me to find
that even though I really want to do
that," Holmes said.
"I'd be more alert and I'd have
the rest of the day to be more pro
ductive and get work done," she
added of the proposed changes.
Some professors, however, ex
pressed doubt that their students
will adjust well to the change.
"It's hard for me to imagine that
you're going to change student cul
ture at Stanford, that student work
habits of working late at night are
suddenly going to change," said
Richard White, professor of histo
ry. "If they don't, then it's going to
be like high school where there's a
bunch of sleep-deprived students."
In addition to harboring con
cerns about inattentive students,
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology who teaches the popular
Stats 60 course, also pointed to a
likely increase in student absences
from class. His course typically has
an enrollment of around 250-300 stu
dents each quarter, yet fewer than
150 students attend each class on av
erage.
"It wouldn't be difficult for me to
start my class at 8:30," Thomas not
ed. "I really worry about whether
students will come. As it is, I don't
think students come to class as
much as they should. I might be
there and nobody might show up."
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5, a human
biology major, voiced mixed feelings
about Black's proposal.
This quarter, Oragwu is taking

the human biology core, which goes
from 9 to 11 a.m. from Mondays to
Thursdays. However, she misses an
hour of class twice a week to attend
her 10 a.m. introductory seminar.
"I do miss going to class ... I still
feel like I'm missing out," Oragwu
said. "I like being in an atmosphere
where everybody comes together in
the same place to learn."
However, she voiced opposition
to the University's potential prohibi
tion of class schedule conflicts alto
gether.
"I think you would miss more by
not being able to experience that
class at all than just not being at a
part of it," Oragwu said. "I don't
think you should block people from
taking the class at all if they make
the effort to listen to lectures and
get the material later."
Black said he recognizes that
some students may want to take two
classes at the same time and cited
efforts to mitigate the issue.
"We've asked departments to
look at courses that are seemingly
popular pairs and to redistribute.
We're emphasizing a full compre
hensive look on when they're offer
ing their courses and in relation to
what," Black said.
Ihlsee Doshi 'l5, a symbolic sys
tems major, said that she doubts the
change will be beneficial.
"I think the University is valid in
making a schedule to force students
to go to class," Doshi said. "But I
think that it's not a realistic concern
given the fact that a lot of students
have multidisciplinary interests that
are inevitably going to take conflict
in the classes that they want to
take."
Because of a scheduling conflict,
Doshi currently does not attend her
CS 109 course, an issue that she
downplayed.
"CS 109 is videotaped, and it's
online," Doshi said. "I personally
feel that in a big lecture hall, sitting
in the back of a lecture hall is equiv
alent to watching the lecture online."
Black said that he expected stu
dents would get used to the
changes.
"One of the things I observe is
that when you were a freshman,
your life was getting up early in the
morning and going to high school
just a year before," he said.
"There's no reason why you can't
make that adjustment. You go over
to Berkeley and you're there at 8
o'clock, you'll see Berkeley students
going to class. It's just an issue of
our culture, which I think can be
modified slightly. We're just asking
people to get up a little early. Adjust
that late night hour in order to make
that first class."

that asset. That doesn't make any
sense."
According to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam, both
the Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies (C-USP) as well as
the Committee on Graduate Studies
have approved Black's proposal. The fi
nal step before the plan's implementa
tion is approval by the Faculty Senate,
which will discuss the issue on March 7.
Black portrayed the changes as ben
eficial to both students and faculty, argu
ing that earlier class times would benefit
athletes and others with substantial
time commitments later in the day. He
also said that faculty with children had
welcomed the earlier schedule because it
would allow them to get home earlier.
"[Athletes and] other groups have
their afternoons filled with all kinds of
activity," Black argued. "If the courses
are only available for a very narrow win
dow and they're on top of each other,
you're not helping anyone."
Despite the proposal's potentially
large impact on students, few students
have been afforded input to date, ac
cording to Black. Instead, he consulted
an advisory committee of 12 students,
appointed by the Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom), and has yet to put for
ward his plan to a larger body of under
graduate or graduate students.
"We asked them if there was any

thing here that would be a showstop
per," Black said. "We know there's a cul
tural practice, but as in all cultures, they
can adapt."
Besides that small focus group, nei
ther Black nor Elam offered any plans
to solicit student input.
"Enrollment opens August 1," Black
said. "When they [students] look at
when the courses are offered, they'll see
that it's been changed."
Black implemented a similar sched
uling change at the University of Chica
go, where he worked as the registrar un
til 2007. Black said there was a very
practical reason for pushing class times
earlier at Chicago the University
lacked classroom space, an issue that is
less pronounced at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has more of a princi
ple that's part of it: the value of teaching,
the proper use of resources, as well as
taking care of the students," Black said.
Reviewing his proposal to eliminate
the ability for students to double-book
classes, Black framed the move as a
means of increasing student focus and
contributions to the class.
"If you have people who are coming
in late or leaving early, what does it say
about the value of teaching? It brings it
down because you're saying 'it doesn't
matter if I'm there,"' Black said. "'I can
skip that fifteen minutes. It does not
matter.' That, to me, is unprincipled."
"On average, one thousand students
or more each quarter had courses that
overlapped. That's something that we
wanted to do away with," Elam said.
"We wanted to get rid of the possibility
of students doing two classes at the
same time."
Elam and Black framed the pro
posed changes as a means of bringing
Stanford's scheduling system in line
with peer institutions. According to
Elam, Stanford's current system is the
"most confusing" among all the schools
he surveyed.
Black noted Stanford's current class
schedule system allows most classes to

run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with many
overlaps. By contrast, Black said peer
institutions have "very few structural
conflicts in the schedules [and are] very
simple."
According to Elam, University ad
ministrators will work with individual
departments to schedule some of the
University's most popular classes at the
new 8:30 a.m. start time. The Program
in Human Biology has already agreed to
move its core classes to an 8:30 a.m. start
time, and Elam expressed hope that
many language classes will also follow
suit.
"We hope that people will use the
early morning time at 8:30 and that
some really popular classes will be held
then," Elam said. "Right now, the cul
ture is that everybody wants to teach ba
sically between 11 and 2, and we just
can't have all our classes then."

University Registrar Tom Black speaks
to the Faculty Senate at their meeting
on Feb. 27. The Report on Managing
Classroom Scheduling proposes
opening up class times at 8:30 a.m.
Student discontent
Even as efforts to support
Black's proposal move ahead, stu
dents expressed concern about the
impact of changes in scheduling on
their academic experience.
"With classes like human biology,
chemistry and other science classes,
you really have to pay attention to
understand the concept," said Rashi
Ojha 'l5, a human biology major. "It
really is hard to pay attention that
early in the morning."
"You [have] got activities at
night, you got homework," Allen Xu
'l5 said. "It's hard to get a start. If
the administration can't change any
of those other things, it can't really
expect changing class times to be a
good idea."
Some students applauded the po
tential changes. Cyerra Holmes 'l6,
a varsity lacrosse player, said that
she has had difficulty finding classes
that do not conflict with practice.
"I haven't been able to take a sin
gle [lntroductory Seminar] because
most of them meet in the afternoon
only, so it's really hard for me to find
that even though I really want to do
that," Holmes said.
"I'd be more alert and I'd have
the rest of the day to be more pro
ductive and get work done," she
added of the proposed changes.
Some professors, however, ex
pressed doubt that their students
will adjust well to the change.
"It's hard for me to imagine that
you're going to change student cul
ture at Stanford, that student work
habits of working late at night are
suddenly going to change," said
Richard White, professor of histo
ry. "If they don't, then it's going to
be like high school where there's a
bunch of sleep-deprived students."
In addition to harboring con
cerns about inattentive students,
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology who teaches the popular
Stats 60 course, also pointed to a
likely increase in student absences
from class. His course typically has
an enrollment of around 250-300 stu
dents each quarter, yet fewer than
150 students attend each class on av
erage.
"It wouldn't be difficult for me to
start my class at 8:30," Thomas not
ed. "I really worry about whether
students will come. As it is, I don't
think students come to class as
much as they should. I might be
there and nobody might show up."
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5, a human
biology major, voiced mixed feelings
about Black's proposal.
This quarter, Oragwu is taking

the human biology core, which goes
from 9 to 11 a.m. from Mondays to
Thursdays. However, she misses an
hour of class twice a week to attend
her 10 a.m. introductory seminar.
"I do miss going to class ... I still
feel like I'm missing out," Oragwu
said. "I like being in an atmosphere
where everybody comes together in
the same place to learn."
However, she voiced opposition
to the University's potential prohibi
tion of class schedule conflicts alto
gether.
"I think you would miss more by
not being able to experience that
class at all than just not being at a
part of it," Oragwu said. "I don't
think you should block people from
taking the class at all if they make
the effort to listen to lectures and
get the material later."
Black said he recognizes that
some students may want to take two
classes at the same time and cited
efforts to mitigate the issue.
"We've asked departments to
look at courses that are seemingly
popular pairs and to redistribute.
We're emphasizing a full compre
hensive look on when they're offer
ing their courses and in relation to
what," Black said.
Ihlsee Doshi 'l5, a symbolic sys
tems major, said that she doubts the
change will be beneficial.
"I think the University is valid in
making a schedule to force students
to go to class," Doshi said. "But I
think that it's not a realistic concern
given the fact that a lot of students
have multidisciplinary interests that
are inevitably going to take conflict
in the classes that they want to
take."
Because of a scheduling conflict,
Doshi currently does not attend her
CS 109 course, an issue that she
downplayed.
"CS 109 is videotaped, and it's
online," Doshi said. "I personally
feel that in a big lecture hall, sitting
in the back of a lecture hall is equiv
alent to watching the lecture online."
Black said that he expected stu
dents would get used to the
changes.
"One of the things I observe is
that when you were a freshman,
your life was getting up early in the
morning and going to high school
just a year before," he said.
"There's no reason why you can't
make that adjustment. You go over
to Berkeley and you're there at 8
o'clock, you'll see Berkeley students
going to class. It's just an issue of
our culture, which I think can be
modified slightly. We're just asking
people to get up a little early. Adjust
that late night hour in order to make
that first class."

welcomed the earlier schedule because it
would allow them to get home earlier.
"[Athletes and] other groups have
their afternoons filled with all kinds of
activity," Black argued. "If the courses
are only available for a very narrow win
dow and they're on top of each other,
you're not helping anyone."
Despite the proposal's potentially
large impact on students, few students
have been afforded input to date, ac
cording to Black. Instead, he consulted
an advisory committee of 12 students,
appointed by the Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom), and has yet to put for
ward his plan to a larger body of under
graduate or graduate students.
"We asked them if there was any

thing here that would be a showstop
per," Black said. "We know there's a cul
tural practice, but as in all cultures, they
can adapt."
Besides that small focus group, nei
ther Black nor Elam offered any plans
to solicit student input.
"Enrollment opens August 1," Black
said. "When they [students] look at
when the courses are offered, they'll see
that it's been changed."
Black implemented a similar sched
uling change at the University of Chica
go, where he worked as the registrar un
til 2007. Black said there was a very
practical reason for pushing class times
earlier at Chicago the University
lacked classroom space, an issue that is
less pronounced at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has more of a princi
ple that's part of it: the value of teaching,
the proper use of resources, as well as
taking care of the students," Black said.
Reviewing his proposal to eliminate
the ability for students to double-book
classes, Black framed the move as a
means of increasing student focus and
contributions to the class.
"If you have people who are coming
in late or leaving early, what does it say
about the value of teaching? It brings it
down because you're saying 'it doesn't
matter if I'm there,"' Black said. "'I can
skip that fifteen minutes. It does not
matter.' That, to me, is unprincipled."
"On average, one thousand students
or more each quarter had courses that
overlapped. That's something that we
wanted to do away with," Elam said.
"We wanted to get rid of the possibility
of students doing two classes at the
same time."
Elam and Black framed the pro
posed changes as a means of bringing
Stanford's scheduling system in line
with peer institutions. According to
Elam, Stanford's current system is the
"most confusing" among all the schools
he surveyed.
Black noted Stanford's current class
schedule system allows most classes to

run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with many
overlaps. By contrast, Black said peer
institutions have "very few structural
conflicts in the schedules [and are] very
simple."
According to Elam, University ad
ministrators will work with individual
departments to schedule some of the
University's most popular classes at the
new 8:30 a.m. start time. The Program
in Human Biology has already agreed to
move its core classes to an 8:30 a.m. start
time, and Elam expressed hope that
many language classes will also follow
suit.
"We hope that people will use the
early morning time at 8:30 and that
some really popular classes will be held
then," Elam said. "Right now, the cul
ture is that everybody wants to teach ba
sically between 11 and 2, and we just
can't have all our classes then."

University Registrar Tom Black speaks
to the Faculty Senate at their meeting
on Feb. 27. The Report on Managing
Classroom Scheduling proposes
opening up class times at 8:30 a.m.
Student discontent
Even as efforts to support
Black's proposal move ahead, stu
dents expressed concern about the
impact of changes in scheduling on
their academic experience.
"With classes like human biology,
chemistry and other science classes,
you really have to pay attention to
understand the concept," said Rashi
Ojha 'l5, a human biology major. "It
really is hard to pay attention that
early in the morning."
"You [have] got activities at
night, you got homework," Allen Xu
'l5 said. "It's hard to get a start. If
the administration can't change any
of those other things, it can't really
expect changing class times to be a
good idea."
Some students applauded the po
tential changes. Cyerra Holmes 'l6,
a varsity lacrosse player, said that
she has had difficulty finding classes
that do not conflict with practice.
"I haven't been able to take a sin
gle [lntroductory Seminar] because
most of them meet in the afternoon
only, so it's really hard for me to find
that even though I really want to do
that," Holmes said.
"I'd be more alert and I'd have
the rest of the day to be more pro
ductive and get work done," she
added of the proposed changes.
Some professors, however, ex
pressed doubt that their students
will adjust well to the change.
"It's hard for me to imagine that
you're going to change student cul
ture at Stanford, that student work
habits of working late at night are
suddenly going to change," said
Richard White, professor of histo
ry. "If they don't, then it's going to
be like high school where there's a
bunch of sleep-deprived students."
In addition to harboring con
cerns about inattentive students,
Ewart Thomas, a professor of psy
chology who teaches the popular
Stats 60 course, also pointed to a
likely increase in student absences
from class. His course typically has
an enrollment of around 250-300 stu
dents each quarter, yet fewer than
150 students attend each class on av
erage.
"It wouldn't be difficult for me to
start my class at 8:30," Thomas not
ed. "I really worry about whether
students will come. As it is, I don't
think students come to class as
much as they should. I might be
there and nobody might show up."
Rebekah Oragwu 'l5, a human
biology major, voiced mixed feelings
about Black's proposal.
This quarter, Oragwu is taking

the human biology core, which goes
from 9 to 11 a.m. from Mondays to
Thursdays. However, she misses an
hour of class twice a week to attend
her 10 a.m. introductory seminar.
"I do miss going to class ... I still
feel like I'm missing out," Oragwu
said. "I like being in an atmosphere
where everybody comes together in
the same place to learn."
However, she voiced opposition
to the University's potential prohibi
tion of class schedule conflicts alto
gether.
"I think you would miss more by
not being able to experience that
class at all than just not being at a
part of it," Oragwu said. "I don't
think you should block people from
taking the class at all if they make
the effort to listen to lectures and
get the material later."
Black said he recognizes that
some students may want to take two
classes at the same time and cited
efforts to mitigate the issue.
"We've asked departments to
look at courses that are seemingly
popular pairs and to redistribute.
We're emphasizing a full compre
hensive look on when they're offer
ing their courses and in relation to
what," Black said.
Ihlsee Doshi 'l5, a symbolic sys
tems major, said that she doubts the
change will be beneficial.
"I think the University is valid in
making a schedule to force students
to go to class," Doshi said. "But I
think that it's not a realistic concern
given the fact that a lot of students
have multidisciplinary interests that
are inevitably going to take conflict
in the classes that they want to
take."
Because of a scheduling conflict,
Doshi currently does not attend her
CS 109 course, an issue that she
downplayed.
"CS 109 is videotaped, and it's
online," Doshi said. "I personally
feel that in a big lecture hall, sitting
in the back of a lecture hall is equiv
alent to watching the lecture online."
Black said that he expected stu
dents would get used to the
changes.
"One of the things I observe is
that when you were a freshman,
your life was getting up early in the
morning and going to high school
just a year before," he said.
"There's no reason why you can't
make that adjustment. You go over
to Berkeley and you're there at 8
o'clock, you'll see Berkeley students
going to class. It's just an issue of
our culture, which I think can be
modified slightly. We're just asking
people to get up a little early. Adjust
that late night hour in order to make
that first class."
