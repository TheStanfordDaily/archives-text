# Classes may start at 8:30
## Proposed changes also ban schedules with overlapping classes 
### ANGELA ZHANG 
Starting in fall quarter of next year,
students could face 8:30 a.m. class times
for popular courses and be precluded
from scheduling overlapping classes as
part of the plan to ease scheduling con
gestion put forward by University Reg
istrar Tom Black.
"Classes are available at that time
[8:30 a.m.] and they're not used. That's
an asset. If you had an asset and you
wasted it everyday, arguably you would
say 'Why?'" Black said. "We build out
these big beautiful physical plans and we
just throw away the money we spent for
that asset. That doesn't make any
sense."
According to Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Harry Elam, both
the Committee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policies (C-USP) as well as
the Committee on Graduate Studies
have approved Black's proposal. The fi
nal step before the plan's implementa
tion is approval by the Faculty Senate,
which will discuss the issue on March 7.
Black portrayed the changes as ben
eficial to both students and faculty, argu
ing that earlier class times would benefit
athletes and others with substantial
time commitments later in the day. He
also said that faculty with children had
welcomed the earlier schedule because it
would allow them to get home earlier.
"[Athletes and] other groups have
their afternoons filled with all kinds of
activity," Black argued. "If the courses
are only available for a very narrow win
dow and they're on top of each other,
you're not helping anyone."
Despite the proposal's potentially
large impact on students, few students
have been afforded input to date, ac
cording to Black. Instead, he consulted
an advisory committee of 12 students,
appointed by the Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom), and has yet to put for
ward his plan to a larger body of under
graduate or graduate students.
"We asked them if there was any

thing here that would be a showstop
per," Black said. "We know there's a cul
tural practice, but as in all cultures, they
can adapt."
Besides that small focus group, nei
ther Black nor Elam offered any plans
to solicit student input.
"Enrollment opens August 1," Black
said. "When they [students] look at
when the courses are offered, they'll see
that it's been changed."
Black implemented a similar sched
uling change at the University of Chica
go, where he worked as the registrar un
til 2007. Black said there was a very
practical reason for pushing class times
earlier at Chicago the University
lacked classroom space, an issue that is
less pronounced at Stanford.
"This [proposal] has more of a princi
ple that's part of it: the value of teaching,
the proper use of resources, as well as
taking care of the students," Black said.
Reviewing his proposal to eliminate
the ability for students to double-book
classes, Black framed the move as a
means of increasing student focus and
contributions to the class.
"If you have people who are coming
in late or leaving early, what does it say
about the value of teaching? It brings it
down because you're saying 'it doesn't
matter if I'm there,"' Black said. "'I can
skip that fifteen minutes. It does not
matter.' That, to me, is unprincipled."
"On average, one thousand students
or more each quarter had courses that
overlapped. That's something that we
wanted to do away with," Elam said.
"We wanted to get rid of the possibility
of students doing two classes at the
same time."
Elam and Black framed the pro
posed changes as a means of bringing
Stanford's scheduling system in line
with peer institutions. According to
Elam, Stanford's current system is the
"most confusing" among all the schools
he surveyed.
Black noted Stanford's current class
schedule system allows most classes to

run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. with many
overlaps. By contrast, Black said peer
institutions have "very few structural
conflicts in the schedules [and are] very
simple."
According to Elam, University ad
ministrators will work with individual
departments to schedule some of the
University's most popular classes at the
new 8:30 a.m. start time. The Program
in Human Biology has already agreed to
move its core classes to an 8:30 a.m. start
time, and Elam expressed hope that
many language classes will also follow
suit.
"We hope that people will use the
early morning time at 8:30 and that
some really popular classes will be held
then," Elam said. "Right now, the cul
ture is that everybody wants to teach ba
sically between 11 and 2, and we just
can't have all our classes then."
