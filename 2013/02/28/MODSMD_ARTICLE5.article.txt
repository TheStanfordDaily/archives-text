## Professors challenge climate change thinking 
### ANTONIO RAMIREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Reducing carbon dioxide emissions
may no longer be enough to halt global
warming, according to a new report pro
duced by researchers at the Global Cli
mate and Energy Project (GCEP) on the
importance and capabilities of various
carbon-negative technologies.
The report, which was co-authored by
Professor of Biology and Environmental
Earth Science Christopher Field Ph.D.
'Bl and energy assessment analyst Jen
nifer Milne, summarized ideas presented
at the GCEP's June 2012 workshop. The
workshop had focused on carbon-negative
technologies those that actually re
move carbon from the atmosphere
rather than the more common carbon
neutral approach.
"We have a significant problem with
climate change," Field said. "These car
bon-negative technologies are important
to understand and we ought to know what

we can do all options and all limita
tions."
At the workshop, scientists from uni
versities around the countiy presented
new technologies for extracting carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere and rein
serting it into the earth and the sea, ac
centuating a natural process.
"The purpose of the workshop was
just choose one particular set of ap
proaches and discuss the limitations, [and
ask] could this work, under which circum
stances," Milne said.
Scientists also discussed strategies for
storing carbon for longer periods of time,
such as through biochar, wetland carbon
storage and ocean sequestration.
Dominic Wolf, a postdoctoral research
associate at Cornell University, spoke
about the potential of biochar, a carbon
rich substance created by heating bio
mass in the absence of oxygen. According
to Wolf, biochar could be used to store ex
cess carbon and enhance degraded soil by
improving the soil's fertility and tilth.

Larry Baxter, a professor at Brigham
Young University, presented another car
bon capture strategy called cryogenic car
bon capture. In this process, flue gas
the gas typically emitted by industrial
power plants is captured, dried, chilled
and then expanded until it precipitates
carbon dioxide.
The GCEP is currently in the process
of reviewing the proposals solicited from
the workshop, in hopes of granting $6 mil
lion to fund new carbon-negative tech
nologies. According to Field, this review
process will likely continue until fall 2013.
"The funding isn't so much a prize, but
a license to work a lot of late nights and
weekends." Field said.
While Milne and Field expressed opti
mism about some of the technologies pre
sented at the workshop, they acknowl
edged an ongoing broader debate regard
ing carbon capture technologies' econom
ic and practical efficiency. Current car-
bon-negative technologies are too
expensive to implement on a wide
scale, and some research suggest
that the process required to capture
and store carbon may release more
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
than it collects.
Given those challenges, Field
warned against assuming that car
bon-negative technologies will solve
the issue of global warming.
"Negative emission technologies
might work and if it they do they will
be part of a wide portfolio of solu
tions," Field said. "It is not a get-out
of-jail-free card. Not a silver bullet."
