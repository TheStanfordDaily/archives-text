## Stanford Arts grants fund student works 
### LAN ANH LE 
An exhibit of vinyl prints in the Cummings Art Building
lobby, a Toyon performance of a student composition for violin
and viola, the Cantor Arts Center's annual Party on the Edge
all owe their existence to student arts grants given out
quarterly through the Stanford Arts Institute.
This winter, 76 students submitted applications for grants,
which offer up to $1,500 of funding for projects in various ar
eas within the arts, including architecture, creative writing,
film, theater and dance. Applicants will learn if they received
funding by the final week of winter quarter, and will have the
following two quarters to complete them projects.
The Stanford Arts Institute currently offers two types of
funding Creativity Fund grants and Spark! grants.
The student-run Student Arts Grant Board awards Cre
ativity Fund grants and assists recipients throughout the
process of creating their work. Board president Hannah
Kauffman 'l4 said that the goal of the Creativity Fund is to
form a connection between students, and among the entire
Stanford community, at each level and phase of artistic cre
ation.
"This involvement creates a cycle of community and inter
est in the arts, which we hope to extend and make more preva
lent throughout campus," she said.
The Spark! grants, awarded by The Stanford Arts Institute
and endowed by Leslie Hume M.A. '7l Ph.D. '79 and George
Hume J.D. '75 MBA '75, are part of a pilot program started in
2010 as a part of the Stanford Arts Initiative with the intent of
making creative pursuits more accessible to students.
As a result, the grants are open to all students with an
artistic vision. Khalil Griffin 'l5, a computer science major, re
ceived funding to present his production, Ram's Head's Orig
inal Winter One Acts, in Memorial Auditorium earlier this
quarter.
"What I'm constantly really impressed by is how we get
applications not only from students majoring in art practices,
but also from students who major in biology or computer sci
ence who are finding an outlet to do something extracurricu
lar, creative and artistic," said grant administrator Emily
Saidel.
Saidel emphasized the grants' emphasis on promoting cre
ative extracurricular pursuits among students regardless of
academic discipline.
"[The grantees] do not get credits for a class," she noted.
"They are not being graded. They are doing this because they
feel strongly about art."
Andrew Evans, a second-year product design master's stu
dent, was a Spark! grant recipient last spring. Evans has per
formed magic for 13 years in the United States, New Zealand,
Japan, Myanmar, Great Britain and France, and said that he
was pushed by his friends to apply for a grant.
With funding from Spark!, he created
"Vodbil," a revitalization of several antiquated
illusions.
"These old illusions are not always prac
tical and easy to use on stage. With the grant,
I was able to rediscover and build these three
illusions and play with really interesting con
cepts that have been widely forgotten by cur
rent magicians," he said. "It has allowed me
to tap into the history of the art."
Chana Rose Rabinovitz 'l3, another

Spark! grant recipient, used the grant mon
ey to organize "I am From a collection
of photographs and creative writing pieces
created by students she worked with in
Cape Town, South Africa.
Rabinovitz said she believes art is a pow
erful tool for outreach and community build
ing, noting that her Spark! grant let her put
together an exhibition giving a voice to the
youths she worked with.
"The experience has changed my life in a
lot of ways. I want to work in youth devel
opment and leadership in the long run," she
said. "I am grateful that Stanford has the re
source that has allowed me to fulfill this need."
