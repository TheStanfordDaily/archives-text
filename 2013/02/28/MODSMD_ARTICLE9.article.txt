# No pay, then at least give athletes a say

### Joey Beyda 
In case you didn't notice because
you were too busy with, well,
just about anything else, the
NHL proposed a new realign
ment plan on Thesday, moving
three teams between the two confer
ences and scrambling the league's six
divisions into just four. I'm already re
working my four-year plan in disgust.
There are, of course, a few minor
controversies associated with this
move. Detroit leaves the Western
Conference to rejoin its geographic
brethren for the first time in 20 years,
which is actually a bit of a bummer for
us Sharks fans, since we consider De
troit our biggest rival. And the new
unbalanced divisions —l4 teams in
the West, 16 in the East —make it
easier for some franchises to make the
playoffs, since each division gets eight
berths.
But to me, what's more interesting
than the new structure is how it
evolved and may continue to evolve.
About a year ago, the NHL approved
a similar four-division realignment
with some of the same playoff imbal
ances, but the players' union struck
the plan down. Negotiations between
the two sides led to Tuesday's hardly
changed proposal, which isn't final yet.
I call that interesting because it
stands in stark contrast to what we
usually get out of the sports league
that typically steals realignment head
lines —the NCAA. You know, the ge
niuses who thought that the Big Ten
should have 12 teams while the Big 12
had 10, that Boise State belonged in
the Big East and that some of the
best rivalries in sports should be
torn apart for money's sake.
But that quip is fundamentally
unfair because the NCAA itself has
n't sparked those changes. Realign
ment has affected every major con
ference in college sports over the
last four years, and the conferences
have been the ones doing it.
Nowadays it's sexy to say that
the NCAA should take a step back,
deregulate or pay players. But in this
case, some strong, central regulation
could put an end to the realignment
frenzy that pretty much everyone
agrees has gotten out of hand.
Look at the NHL, which not on
ly has kept the same division/confer
ence structure for 15 years but also
took 14 whole months to re-propose a
realignment scheme that's hardly
any different from the fust rejected
plan. All those bureaucratic hoops to
jump through do serve their purpose,
and with some additional oversight of
its conferences, the NCAA could con
trol its own rampant realignment.
The logistics behind that are a bit
of a challenge, some would argue. In
an interview with GoStanford.com
just a week ago, NCAA President
Mark Emmert said that the biggest
misconception about the NCAA is
that it operates like a pro sports
league. Instead, it's an organization
without much central authority that
works like "a jury of your peers"
the 1,100 other member schools.
But if that jury can regulate
player benefits or scholarship
counts, why can't it regulate confer
ence realignment?
As we saw with the NHLPAs re
jection of the league's initial plan a year
ago, professional athletes actually have
a say in their sport and can effect (or
logjam) change. Bringing something
like that to the NCAA would certainly
put a damper on all the "college ath
letes are pushed around" talk, which is
perhaps the greatest fuel for pay-for
play advocates.
Team captains could act as rep
resentatives to a larger organiza
tional body, just like union reps in
pro sports. Even couch potato John
ny Manziel could chip in.
The power would be decentral
ized, which suits the NCAA, and the
conferences would be held in check,
which suits the fans. I'm not one to
solve the world's problems in an af
ternoon, but those are the kinds of
checks and balances that college
athletics is missing right now in the
eyes of many critics.
If we can't agree whether it's
time to pay college athletes for all
the money they generate and I
tend to fall on the "it's not time" side
of that argument we can at least
reward them with the power to fix
the problems that nobody else is
willing to.

Joseph Beyda is bitter that he's not
an NCAA athlete and that Johnny
Manziel ivould be able to "chip in"
over him. Sympathize with him at
