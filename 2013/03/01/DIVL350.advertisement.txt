FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTING FEDERAL CRIMES (for 29 years)?
by Leland Yoshitsu - Amazon • B&NNook • Sony • eßookPie
1. You are purchasing an eßook (or paperback) that contains a collection of historic and legal
documents which PROVES THE FACT that the US Federal Government and a major American
Corporation, NBC, have COMMITTED A NUMBER OF CRIMES AGAINST A US CITIZEN.
Leland Yoshitsu, to secretly and intentionally DEFRAUD him from receiving and obtaining TRUTH
AND JUSTICE.
2. This is a unique documentary book that spans 29 years - an authentic 'one-of-a-kind' learning
instrument that reveals to the public the 'real-inner-workings' of the US Federal Government and
Corporate America (NBC).
3. Do President Obama and Corporate America (NBC) have too cozy a relationship?
4. Has President Obama, as the Head of Law Enforcement in the US Federal Government,
"FAITHFULLY EXECUTED" THE LAWS for TRUTH, JUSTICE, and "EQUAL PROTECTION"?
5. Can President Obama "PRESERVE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND" the US Constitution
(Supreme Law of the Land) against Corporate America (NBC)?
6. President Obama should publicly respond to all of the allegations of Crime, Cover-up,
Corruption, and Obstruction of Justice that are outlined in this book to reassure the Public
that the General Welfare of All the People is SAFE and SECURE as intended by the US
Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and President Lincoln.
7. President Obama should acknowledge His commitment to TRANSPARENCY by voluntarily
making a 'Public Statement in Good Faith' about all the issues that He has already responded to in
this book - especially, if there is a collection of documented evidence of alleged Crime, Cover-up,
Corruption, and Obstruction of Justice in the US Postal Service and in the US Federal Government
by Corporate America (NBC).
