## Can you stop athletes playing concussed? 
### Sam Fisher 
Is it okay to for an athlete to lose
his starting job while out with an
injury? With 4961-8 quarterback
Alex Smith reportedly being
traded to the Kansas City Chiefs
for the first pick of the second round of
the 2013 Draft, this question comes
back to the forefront.
On Oct. 29, Smith went 18-of-19 for
232 yards and three touchdowns to lead
the Niners to a 24-3 victory. In the
49ers' next game, Smith started 7-of-8
before leaving the game with a concus
sion. He threw one more pass the rest
of the season.
Was this unfair to Smith? After per
haps the best stretch of his football ca
reer, a concussion cost him his job. How
unjust!
Smith's situation is not unique. The
most famous story of an athlete losing
his job for good from missing a game is
New York Yankee Wally Pipp. The sto
ry —which may not be 100 percent ac
curate —is that Pipp took a game off
due to injury Lou Gehrig took his place
in the starting lineup. Gehrig played
the next 2,130 games.
But Smith's story takes new im
portance in the age of the concussion,
perhaps the most dangerous injury to
try to play through. The NFL is in a
fight for its long-term survival against
the litigation stemming from head in
juries. In response, the league is doing
everything it can to ensure player
safety—at least the NFL says it is
especially with regards to head in
juries.
But no matter what the NFL or
its teams may say, players who watch
what happened to Smith will be
scared to miss time with a concussion.
In fact, as recently as the 2011 season,
top players said they would hide con
cussions to try to stay in the game.
"The bottom line is: You have to be
able to put food on the table," Jack
sonville Jaguars running back Mau
rice Jones-Drew told the Associated
Press in 2011. "No one's going to sign
or want a guy who can't stay healthy.
I know there will be a day when I'm
going to have trouble walking. I real
ize that. But this is what I signed up
for. Injuries are part of the game. If
you don't want to get hit, then you
shouldn't be playing."
Many players have echoed Jones-
Drew's statements. To be fair, the
league has come a long way At least
no\y at the top, playing through seri
ous injuries is becoming frowned up
on, and punishing players for missing
a game due to injury is absurd. But
though the 49ers certainly weren't
punishing Smith for being injured, his
time on the sideline gave Colin
Kaepernick a chance to win the job,
and he took full advantage.
And faced with that chance, would
you expect an athlete to do anything
other than play through the pain
especially an NFL quarterback whose
presence on the field for every single
game means so much to his team's sea
son?
When a manager walks to the
mound with two outs in the eighth and
his starter is at 125 pitches, what do you
want the pitcher to say? I don't want
my starter saying, "Coach, take me out.
I'm done."
I want my hurting starter —or my
woozy quarterback—to tell the coach
that he wants to stay in. No matter how
tired he is, no matter how hurt he may
feel, I want him to say that he can get
the job done.
But I want the coach to take him out
anyway.
That's how you stop Alex Smith's
situation from convincing NFL players
to play through concussions. You don't
have to protect his starting job while
he's on the bench if you're the one who
forces him to go there.
As a coach or a team doctor
it is your responsibility to put the play
er's health and safety ahead of a game.
It's a brutally tough challenge, but it's
a vital part of the job.
It's too much to ask of a player—
especially the ultimate competitors
you see playing in the NFL or other
professional sports leagues to think
about then- long-term health in the
middle of the game. To be fair, that
might be too much for coaches as well,
but at that level, then the trainer has to
be empowered to make more deci
sions.
Otherwise, whether or not a back
up takes the job of an injured starter
ever again, players are going to toy to
play through injuries even concus
sions —to help their teams win.

Press in 2011. "No one's going to sign
or want a guy who can't stay healthy.
I know there will be a day when I'm
going to have trouble walking. I real
ize that. But this is what I signed up
for. Injuries are part of the game. If
you don't want to get hit, then you
shouldn't be playing."
Many players have echoed Jones-
Drew's statements. To be fair, the
league has come a long way At least
no\y at the top, playing through seri
ous injuries is becoming frowned up
on, and punishing players for missing
a game due to injury is absurd. But
though the 49ers certainly weren't
punishing Smith for being injured, his
time on the sideline gave Colin
Kaepernick a chance to win the job,
and he took full advantage.
And faced with that chance, would
you expect an athlete to do anything
other than play through the pain
especially an NFL quarterback whose
presence on the field for every single
game means so much to his team's sea
son?
When a manager walks to the
mound with two outs in the eighth and
his starter is at 125 pitches, what do you
want the pitcher to say? I don't want
my starter saying, "Coach, take me out.
I'm done."
I want my hurting starter —or my
woozy quarterback—to tell the coach
that he wants to stay in. No matter how
tired he is, no matter how hurt he may
feel, I want him to say that he can get
the job done.
But I want the coach to take him out
anyway.
That's how you stop Alex Smith's
situation from convincing NFL players
to play through concussions. You don't
have to protect his starting job while
he's on the bench if you're the one who
forces him to go there.
As a coach or a team doctor
it is your responsibility to put the play
er's health and safety ahead of a game.
It's a brutally tough challenge, but it's
a vital part of the job.
It's too much to ask of a player—
especially the ultimate competitors
you see playing in the NFL or other
professional sports leagues to think
about then- long-term health in the
middle of the game. To be fair, that
might be too much for coaches as well,
but at that level, then the trainer has to
be empowered to make more deci
sions.
Otherwise, whether or not a back
up takes the job of an injured starter
ever again, players are going to toy to
play through injuries even concus
sions —to help their teams win.
