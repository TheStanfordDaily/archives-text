# BROWN'S FINAL BOW
## 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The last home game of the sea
son, which comes this Sunday
against Utah, is a time to look back
on the careers of Stanford's two
seniors. It is also a time to look for
ward.
Stanford (16-13, 7-9 Pac-12) is

ninth in the conference, just above
lOth-place Utah (11-15, 3-11). With
two games remaining, 9-9 is the
best the Cardinal can finish in con
ference play.
On Wednesday night, Stanford
fell to Colorado in the penultimate
home game of the season, 65-63. It
was the seventh conference loss of
the season by fewer than 10 points

for head coach Johnny Dawkins'
team.

"I thought we played a good
basketball team," Dawkins said. "I
thought we had a chance to win."
That seems to sum up the 2012-
13 campaign. Stanford had more
than a fighting chance against al
most every opponent, from the
highly ranked on down. But the big

wins just didn't come, although a
few bad losses did.
The Cardinal will be saying
goodbye to redshirt senior Andy
Brown, who worked his way into
the starting lineup in the late part
of this season, and senior Gabriel
Harris, who has provided occasion
al sparks off of the bench through
out his career.
More notable are the players
who are not leaving the Farm, bar
ring any unforeseen forays into the
NBA Draft.
The top four scorers will return
next fall likewise with rebounds
and minutes. The top three assist
men will be back too.
