# BROWN'S FINAL BOW
## 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The last home game of the sea
son, which comes this Sunday
against Utah, is a time to look back
on the careers of Stanford's two
seniors. It is also a time to look for
ward.
Stanford (16-13, 7-9 Pac-12) is

ninth in the conference, just above
lOth-place Utah (11-15, 3-11). With
two games remaining, 9-9 is the
best the Cardinal can finish in con
ference play.
On Wednesday night, Stanford
fell to Colorado in the penultimate
home game of the season, 65-63. It
was the seventh conference loss of
the season by fewer than 10 points

for head coach Johnny Dawkins'
team.

"I thought we played a good
basketball team," Dawkins said. "I
thought we had a chance to win."
That seems to sum up the 2012-
13 campaign. Stanford had more
than a fighting chance against al
most every opponent, from the
highly ranked on down. But the big

wins just didn't come, although a
few bad losses did.
The Cardinal will be saying
goodbye to redshirt senior Andy
Brown, who worked his way into
the starting lineup in the late part
of this season, and senior Gabriel
Harris, who has provided occasion
al sparks off of the bench through
out his career.
More notable are the players
who are not leaving the Farm, bar
ring any unforeseen forays into the
NBA Draft.
The top four scorers will return
next fall likewise with rebounds
and minutes. The top three assist
men will be back too.

GAME NOTES: In its last home game of
the season, Stanford will face Utah on
Sunday. After falling to the Colorado
Buffaloes on Wednesday night, the
Cardinal currently occupies ninth place
in the Pac-12, one spot above the
Utes. Stanford will honor its two sen
iors, Andy Brown and Gabriel Harris, at
the game.

Andy Brown (left) will take the court Sunday at Maples Pavilion for potentially his final regular season home
game Sunday. A senior academically, Brown has redshirted twice with a torn ACL and could return in 2013.
Plus, the smooth-shoot
ing junior Anthony Brown
will return from injury. He
averaged eight points per
game last year before being
sidelined for all but four
games of this season, one in
which he was expected to
provide a strong scoring
presence.

This Sunday, the starting
lineup will consist of the dou
ble-barreled frontcourt of
juniors Josh Huestis and
Dwight Powell. The team
mates had a combined eight
straight games with at least
one double-double between
them before Wednesday's
loss to Colorado.
The backcourt will show
case a pair of dynamic and
confident scoring threats in
sophomore Chasson Randle
and junior Aaron Bright.
Junior John Gage, the
Pac-12's most accurate 3-
point shooter and the Cardi

nal's source of instant of
fense off the bench, will be
coming back too.
Next year, Stanford will
be a team with a heap of ex
perience to go along with its
talent. It will be a team with
high expectations put upon
it, and more importantly,
with the pieces to live up to
those expectations.
Of course, this year is not
over just yet. There is still
the Pac-12 Tournament to be
played. There is still a trip to
Berkeley with a chance to
spoil the party for a red-hot
California team.
And of course, there is
still senior day. Stanford will
try to recapture the form
that led the Cardinal to an
87-56 win at Utah last month
in a ferocious snowstorm.
That form has escaped Stan
ford during its current 2-5
stretch.
Gage had 19 points in the
first Utah game a career
high Randle added 17 and
Powell and Huestis each
scored in double digits.
It was a victory that
started a three-game win-

ning streak the Cardinal's
longest of the Pac-12 season
that resulted in Stanford
owning a winning record in
the conference for a brief pe
riod.
Harris had two points
and a steal in nine minutes in
that game. Andy Brown had
seven points and two assists.
Brown, who has become a
leader on the team while
playing the role of a "glue"
guy, is coming off of a signa
ture performance against
Colorado in which he scored
17 points on 7-11 shooting
and grabbed eight rebounds.
"I thought it was one of
his best games in a Cardinal
uniform," Dawkins said.
Dawkins can only hope
that Brown's final encore at
Maples Pavilion is even bet
ter.
Tip-off for Sunday's game
against Utah is at 2 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. The Senior
Day ceremony will take place
before the game.

longest of the Pac-12 season

owning a winning record in

Harris had two points
and a steal in nine minutes in

seven points and two assists.
Brown, who has become a
leader on the team while
playing the role of a "glue"
guy, is coming off of a signa

Colorado in which he scored
17 points on 7-11 shooting

"I thought it was one of
his best games in a Cardinal

The last home game of the sea
son, which comes this Sunday
against Utah, is a time to look back
on the careers of Stanford's two
seniors. It is also a time to look for
ward.
Stanford (16-13, 7-9 Pac-12) is

ninth in the conference, just above
lOth-place Utah (11-15, 3-11). With
two games remaining, 9-9 is the
best the Cardinal can finish in con
ference play.
On Wednesday night, Stanford
fell to Colorado in the penultimate
home game of the season, 65-63. It
was the seventh conference loss of
the season by fewer than 10 points

for head coach Johnny Dawkins'
team.

"I thought we played a good
basketball team," Dawkins said. "I
thought we had a chance to win."
That seems to sum up the 2012-
13 campaign. Stanford had more
than a fighting chance against al
most every opponent, from the
highly ranked on down. But the big

wins just didn't come, although a
few bad losses did.
The Cardinal will be saying
goodbye to redshirt senior Andy
Brown, who worked his way into
the starting lineup in the late part
of this season, and senior Gabriel
Harris, who has provided occasion
al sparks off of the bench through
out his career.
More notable are the players
who are not leaving the Farm, bar
ring any unforeseen forays into the
NBA Draft.
The top four scorers will return
next fall likewise with rebounds
and minutes. The top three assist
men will be back too.

GAME NOTES: In its last home game of
the season, Stanford will face Utah on
Sunday. After falling to the Colorado

Utes. Stanford will honor its two sen
iors, Andy Brown and Gabriel Harris, at
the game.

Andy Brown (left) will take the court Sunday at Maples Pavilion for potentially his final regular season home
game Sunday. A senior academically, Brown has redshirted twice with a torn ACL and could return in 2013.
Plus, the smooth-shoot
ing junior Anthony Brown
will return from injury. He
averaged eight points per
game last year before being
sidelined for all but four
games of this season, one in
which he was expected to
provide a strong scoring
presence.

This Sunday, the starting
lineup will consist of the dou
ble-barreled frontcourt of
juniors Josh Huestis and
Dwight Powell. The team
mates had a combined eight
straight games with at least
one double-double between
them before Wednesday's
loss to Colorado.
The backcourt will show
case a pair of dynamic and
confident scoring threats in
sophomore Chasson Randle
and junior Aaron Bright.
Junior John Gage, the
Pac-12's most accurate 3-
point shooter and the Cardi

nal's source of instant of
fense off the bench, will be
coming back too.
Next year, Stanford will
be a team with a heap of ex
perience to go along with its
talent. It will be a team with
high expectations put upon
it, and more importantly,
with the pieces to live up to
those expectations.
Of course, this year is not
over just yet. There is still
the Pac-12 Tournament to be
played. There is still a trip to
Berkeley with a chance to
spoil the party for a red-hot
California team.
And of course, there is
still senior day. Stanford will
try to recapture the form
that led the Cardinal to an
87-56 win at Utah last month
in a ferocious snowstorm.
That form has escaped Stan
ford during its current 2-5
stretch.
Gage had 19 points in the
first Utah game a career
high Randle added 17 and
Powell and Huestis each
scored in double digits.
