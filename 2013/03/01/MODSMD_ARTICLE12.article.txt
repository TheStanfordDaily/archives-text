# Card looks to rebound against Cal
## 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Having returned from last weekend's trek
to Gainesville to face No. 4 Florida and No. 18
Clemson, the Stanford women's tennis team
will reappear back at the Farm this Saturday in
a huge match-up against cross-town rival Cal.
The No. 26 Cardinal (4-2, 0-0 Pac-12) will
take on the No. 9 Golden Bears (4-3) in a non
conference meeting. The Pac-12 dual match will
take place at Cal on April 19. Though this week
end's meeting won't count towards conference
rankings, its importance for Stanford cannot be
overemphasized.
The Cardinal fell out of the top 25 after its
loss to Florida, which is unfamiliar territory for
the powerhouse program. Stanford has
reached the quarterfinals and the finals of the
NCAA Championship each of the last two sea
sons, respectively.
"This match is just huge for us," Gibbs said.
"Cal is a top-10 team, and we've obviously fall
en in the rankings recently. It's an opportunity
for us to restart a streak at home and regain
confidence both individually and as a team."
The Golden Bears will not be an easy oppo
nent. They boast four nationally ranked play
ers: No. 5 sophomore Zsofi Susanyi, No. 8 jun
ior Anett Schutting, No. 49 freshman Lynn Chi
and No. 117 freshman Klara Fabikova.
Stanford and Cal's only common opponent is
Saint Mary's, who upset the then seventh
ranked Cardinal 4-3 on Feb. 16. A few weeks
