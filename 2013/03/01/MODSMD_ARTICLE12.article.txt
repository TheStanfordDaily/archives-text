# Card looks to rebound against Cal
## 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Having returned from last weekend's trek
to Gainesville to face No. 4 Florida and No. 18
Clemson, the Stanford women's tennis team
will reappear back at the Farm this Saturday in
a huge match-up against cross-town rival Cal.
The No. 26 Cardinal (4-2, 0-0 Pac-12) will
take on the No. 9 Golden Bears (4-3) in a non
conference meeting. The Pac-12 dual match will
take place at Cal on April 19. Though this week
end's meeting won't count towards conference
rankings, its importance for Stanford cannot be
overemphasized.
The Cardinal fell out of the top 25 after its
loss to Florida, which is unfamiliar territory for
the powerhouse program. Stanford has
reached the quarterfinals and the finals of the
NCAA Championship each of the last two sea
sons, respectively.
"This match is just huge for us," Gibbs said.
"Cal is a top-10 team, and we've obviously fall
en in the rankings recently. It's an opportunity
for us to restart a streak at home and regain
confidence both individually and as a team."
The Golden Bears will not be an easy oppo
nent. They boast four nationally ranked play
ers: No. 5 sophomore Zsofi Susanyi, No. 8 jun
ior Anett Schutting, No. 49 freshman Lynn Chi
and No. 117 freshman Klara Fabikova.
Stanford and Cal's only common opponent is
Saint Mary's, who upset the then seventh
ranked Cardinal 4-3 on Feb. 16. A few weeks

Senior Stacey Tan (above) looks to get the
Cardinal back on track against Cal on
Saturday. Stanford fell out of the top 25
after losing to No. 4 Florida last week.
earlier, the Bears swept the
Gaels with a dominant 7-0
victory. Cal is also coming off
a win over No. 11 USC last
Saturday, whom it defeated
5-2 the day after losing to No.
3 UCLA.

Susanyi, who typically
tops the lineup for the Bears,
did not play singles in the
USC matchup. Schutting in
stead manned court one and
defeated USC's No. 3 nation
ally ranked Danielle Lao. Ei
ther way, Stanford junior cap
tain Nicole Gibbs will face a
tough opponent this Saturday.
"We are preparing that
[Susanyi] will be playing at
the top, but we are ready for
either player," she said.
Gibbs has faced both Su

sanyi and Schutting before.
"[Susanyi] is a grinder," she
said. "She makes a lot of
balls and is very athletic.
She makes it tough on you to
win points for sure. [Schut
ting] is more straightfor
ward. She hits a pretty flat
ball and tries to go for win
ners. She makes you play
more defensively."
Gibbs and the rest of the
Cardinal squad will be hard at
work as they attempt to beat
Cal and climb back up the
rankings. The hard labor
won't just take place on Satur
day, though. The team has re
vamped its normal practices
post-Florida in an effort to be
come a more physical group.
"We read an article on
Florida's website after our
match that talked about how
they wanted to be physical
against us," Gibbs said. "We
don't want to be perceived as
a team that's not super fit, so

we've reorganized our prac
tices to reflect our desire to
get more physical and more
athletic as a team."

This intensity has perme
ated Stanford's long after
noon practices this week as it
prepares for Cal's visit. The
team hopes to carry over this
intensity through Saturday,
not only to regain its reputa
tion as one of the nation's top
programs, but also to enter
tain the large fan base that's
expected to show.
"People all day have been
approaching me with knowl
edge of the match this week
end," Gibbs said. "We should
see a good fan base."

The Cardinal and Golden
Bears will duke it out in the
Big Slam this Saturday at 12
p.m. on the Taube Family
Tennis Courts.
