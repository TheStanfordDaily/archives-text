# DOMINATION
## Samuelson lights up Washington 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Whether at home or on the
road, in conference or out of
conference play, Stanford
women's basketball and domi
nance have been synonymous
with each other.

Thursday night proved no
different for No. 4 Stanford
(27-2,16-1 Pac-12), as the Car
dinal easily dispatched Wash
ington (19-9, 11-6) by score of
71-36 and extended its win
streak to 13. Junior forward
Chiney Ogwumike, a consen
sus National Player of the Year
candidate, netted 24 points
and grabbed 13 rebounds to
increased her double-doubles
school record to 53.
The Huskies were short
handed for the game, as their
top two scoring players soph
omore point guard Jazmine
Davis, last year's Pac-12
Freshman of the Year, and for
ward Talia Walton, the red
shirt freshman standout who
had been averaging almost 14
points per game were side
lined for violating team rules.
Even so, the Cardinal did
not have the most auspicious
start after winning the open
ing tip-off, with senior forward
Joslyn Tinkle missing a 3-
pointer and junior forward
Mikaela Ruef turning the ball
over to waste the team's first
two possessions. The Huskies
jumped out to a 9-3 lead less
than four minutes into the
game, thanks in part to sopho
more forward Aminah
Williams' two consecutive hard
fought offensive rebounds.
But that would be the up
per limit of Washington's suc
cess for the night.
Capitalizing off of a terrific
feed from Ruef, Ogwumike
managed to draw contact,
make the short jumper and
convert the and-one to tie the
game up at 9. Following two
straight fruitless Huskies pos
sessions, sophomore forward
Bonnie Samuelson then
scored from downtown to give
the Cardinal its first lead of
the game with 14:26 left in the
first half.
Stanford never looked
back as its lead steadily grew

with each passing minute.
Meanwhile, its opponent
struggled to find any offensive
rhythm for the rest of the
game. After cashing in nine
points in the first four minutes
of the game, Washington suf
fered two scoreless stretches
that each lasted for nearly four
minutes and was unable to un
lock a suffocating Cardinal de
fense that recorded 11 blocks
and 6 steals.
The Huskies would finish
the game 12-of-71 shooting as a
team, including 4-of-24 behind
the arc. The individual statis
tics were just as meager
Williams was the only Huskies
player to reach double digits in
points or rebounds, and not a
single starter shot above 29
percent.
Fueled by Tinkle's 12 points
and three blocks, the Cardinal
headed into halftime with a
comfortable 39-18 lead.
Stanford and Washington
traded turnovers to open up
the second half before Ogwu
mike made an easy layup to
extend the Cardinal's lead to
23. Stanford's shooting effi
ciency noticeably dropped,

but it hardly mattered consid
ering that the Huskies could
not overcome their dire offen
sive woes. On one of the trips
to the basket, Washington
managed to haul in four con
secutive rebounds but could
not convert on any of them.
Back-to-back scores from
Ogwumike in the middle of
the second half gave Stanford
an insurmountable 52-24
lead. The 6-foot-4 Cypress,
Texas, native netted 14 of her
24 points in the second half
while sophomore guard Am
ber Orrange chipped in seven
points to bring her game to
tal to 12.
The Cardinal will play its
last regular season game of
the year against Washington
State in Pullman, Wash., on
Saturday. With a victory over
the Cougars, Stanford would
at least share the conference
crown with No. 6 Cal and also
own the tiebreaker over the
Golden Bears for the No. 1
seed in the Pac-12 Tourna
ment, which begins March 8.
