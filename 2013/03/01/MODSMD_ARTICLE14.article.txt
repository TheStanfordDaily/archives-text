## SEEING GREEN Field Blinders 
### Holly Moeller 
SANTA CRUZ, CA —I am a
terrible field biologist. It's not
that I don't love being out
doors; I do. And I've been privileged
to explore and work in some of
the most spectacular and intriguing
parts of the planet. I like to think
none of those opportunities have
gone to waste. Yet I can't help but
think that I'm not always the best
person for the job.
For example, I study invasive
trees in the mountains of New
Zealand, but steep terrain scares me.
Before I headed south for my first
round of fieldwork with the tough-as
nails Kiwis, I spent hours at the
climbing wall (mostly getting stuck in
awkward positions) trying "to be
come more hard-core," yet I still get
nervous on anything much steeper
than a 70 percent grade. I might have
lied about owning hiking boots to get
my first field job (Sorry, Matt!), and I
took my first backpacking trip at the
ripe old age of 25.
Sometimes, when I'm battling
fear to collect samples in a not-partic
ularly-precarious place or shying
nervously away from bear tracks
while sampling a reach of stream
within earshot of fly-fishermen, I
wonder why I didn't just become a
bench scientist. I could lead a life with
no more topographic change than
sliding on and off a lab stool. I could
sign for my test tube-sample deliver
ies, rather than packing soil cores out
of the field myself. I could study the
cell cycle instead of the nutrient one.
It's usually at this point that I need
a reality check, some kind of big-pic
ture reminder of why it is that I do
what I do.
This weekend, I was lucky enough
to get two. First, I went for a long,
solitary meander at Pinnacles, our
newest national park, where I did
some nerdy botanizing (falling Coul
ter Pine cones have got to be lethal)
and awed birding (How many Califor
nia Condors will I see in my lifetime?).
And then I caught the final night of
Santa Cruz's selection from the
Banff Mountain Film Festival, which
included thirteen minutes of genuine,
fieldwork-studded conservation biolo
gy. The short film was called "High
way Wilding," and it featured a
stretch of road I'd driven myself on a
cross-continental road trip several
summers ago.
The Trans-Canada Highway cuts
a 5,000-mile-long path across our
northerly neighbor, allowing tens of
thousands of cars passage from coast
to coast each year*. But while it helps
whisk humans from place to place, it
can also pose a substantial barrier to
the movement of animals who, with no
evolutionary training to deal with hu
man construction, frequently fall vic
tim to speeding vehicles.
"Highway Wilding" documents
conservation biologists' attempts at
fixing this problem by building over
and under-passes along the highway's
Rocky Mountain region. With motion
sensing cameras and a few twists of
wire, they record images and snag hair

samples from the animals using these
movement corridors. Over the last few
years, these animal-friendly punctures
in an otherwise-impermeable barrier
of internal combustion engines have
been used by tens of thousands of ani
mals, from elk to grizzly bear, rabbit to
wolverine.
At the same time that we work to
help animals duck through our mesh
work road system, we sometimes also
inadvertently build new corridors for
them to follow. Work in other parts of
Canada shows that animals, particu
larly highly mobile predators like
wolves, use seismic survey lines
(narrow strips of forest cleared for en
ergy exploration) to move through the
landscape. A pack can travel more
quickly and scout over longer dis
tances without trees obscuring the
way.
We know these things about ani
mal movement about soaring con
dors and roaming bears because of
fieldwork. Modern technology, like
satellite and airplane imagery or GPS
tracking collars, makes the work of a
field biologist easier and more accu
rate. Yet without first putting our
(sometimes brand-new) boots on the
ground, we wouldn't know what ques
tions needed to be answered about the
natural world.
And that is why I'm a field biolo
gist. Because the things that I need
to know, the questions that I have to
answer, relate to the natural world
around me, from the picturesque
landscapes of our national parks to
the future of New Zealand's native
forests to the Great Horned Owl
that occasionally swoops into my
San Francisco backyard. They
range from the fundamentals of sci
ence (Why does this tree grow
here?) to applied conservation (How
fast will climate change melt these
glaciers?).
And if I have to climb the occa
sional steep slope to answer them,
so be it.

didn't just become
a beach scientist.

And then I caught the final night of
Santa Cruz's selection from the
Banff Mountain Film Festival, which
included thirteen minutes of genuine,
fieldwork-studded conservation biolo
gy. The short film was called "High
way Wilding," and it featured a
stretch of road I'd driven myself on a
cross-continental road trip several
summers ago.
The Trans-Canada Highway cuts
a 5,000-mile-long path across our
northerly neighbor, allowing tens of
thousands of cars passage from coast
to coast each year*. But while it helps
whisk humans from place to place, it
can also pose a substantial barrier to
the movement of animals who, with no
evolutionary training to deal with hu
man construction, frequently fall vic
tim to speeding vehicles.
"Highway Wilding" documents
conservation biologists' attempts at
fixing this problem by building over
and under-passes along the highway's
Rocky Mountain region. With motion
sensing cameras and a few twists of
wire, they record images and snag hair

samples from the animals using these
movement corridors. Over the last few
years, these animal-friendly punctures
in an otherwise-impermeable barrier
of internal combustion engines have
been used by tens of thousands of ani
mals, from elk to grizzly bear, rabbit to
wolverine.
At the same time that we work to
help animals duck through our mesh
work road system, we sometimes also
inadvertently build new corridors for
them to follow. Work in other parts of
Canada shows that animals, particu
larly highly mobile predators like
wolves, use seismic survey lines
(narrow strips of forest cleared for en
ergy exploration) to move through the
landscape. A pack can travel more
quickly and scout over longer dis
tances without trees obscuring the
way.
We know these things about ani
mal movement about soaring con
dors and roaming bears because of
fieldwork. Modern technology, like
satellite and airplane imagery or GPS
tracking collars, makes the work of a
field biologist easier and more accu
rate. Yet without first putting our
(sometimes brand-new) boots on the
ground, we wouldn't know what ques
tions needed to be answered about the
natural world.
And that is why I'm a field biolo
gist. Because the things that I need
to know, the questions that I have to
answer, relate to the natural world
around me, from the picturesque
landscapes of our national parks to
the future of New Zealand's native
forests to the Great Horned Owl
that occasionally swoops into my
San Francisco backyard. They
range from the fundamentals of sci
ence (Why does this tree grow
here?) to applied conservation (How
fast will climate change melt these
glaciers?).
And if I have to climb the occa
sional steep slope to answer them,
so be it.

I wonder why I
didn't just become
a beach scientist.
