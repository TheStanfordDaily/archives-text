## A
						Huge Opportunity to Do Good 
### JONNY DORSEY FAGAN HARRIS ASSU Execs, 2008-2009 
TASSU elections are around
the corner. Petitions are due a
week from today. People are
asking themselves if they should
run and what should be on their
platform.
We are writing this because we
believe strongly in the ASSU and
its power to do a lot of good when
students, committed to working on
big problems, step up.
It can be tempting to make the
ASSU a tool to help pursue narrow
interests of the student body. But
the ASSU's mission and history,
and the state of affairs on campus,
require a much more ambitious and
altruistic ASSU. The ASSU played
a major role in anti-apartheid or
ganizing. The ASSU President
founded Earth Day. The history of
the ASSU is one of bold action and
a commitment to social justice
and that is what is needed now.
What are the challenges the AS
SU should tackle? There are many,
but here are four:
1. Sexual Assault: The University
has made addressing sexual as
sault more of a priority in recent
years. But its response is still in
sufficient. Students should be
warned about dangerous loca
tions, and houses that may har
bor offenders must be handled
head on. Strong support services
for acute and ongoing trauma
must be on campus permanently.
Men and women must be trained
to build a safer campus, and
abusers must be held to account.
The campus must be rallied to
stamp out a bystander mentality.
2. Mental Health: The worst days
at Stanford are when headlines
tell us explicitly or other
wise that a member of our
community has taken his or her
life. Too many continue to suf
fer the pain from untreated de
pression, eating disorders and
other struggles. Simply, we need
more investment in support serv
ices that have been shown to
make the biggest difference in

the lives of students.
3. Expanding Public Service: Jane
Stanford's vision was that Stan
ford would shape leaders for the
public good. While the Haas Cen
ter has excellent programs, ef
forts to support Stanford studen
t's strong desire to serve the pub
lic should be more deeply encour
aged by the broader University
community. At Stanford, there
should be an exponential increase
in summer service fellowships
and post-grad opportunities to
begin catching up with the enor
mous, but currently unmet, de
mand among students. Universi
ty leadership should call students
to serve and remind them of the
broader responsibilities accom
panying a Stanford degree. This
call should be issued well before
students graduate.
4. Igniting Political Engagement:
The ASSU should rally the stu
dent body to engage in the impor
tant political fights of our time.
We worked with a coalition to
hold the biggest phone-bank in
the state against Proposition 8.
What will you organize around?
Will you help pass the Dream
Act? Comprehensive immigra
tion reform? Equal rights for all?
Permanent recognition of the
speech rights guaranteed to the
student body through Leonard
Law? Whatever the cause, the
ASSU has the power to make a
real difference.

These are four important issues,
but we're sure each of you can iden

tify many more. That point is that
the ASSU can and must work on
important problems to better peo
ple's lives.
2013 provides an incredible op
portunity for the ASSU to have
powerful impact on the lives of oth
ers. Stanford recently broke the
record as the first university to sur
pass $1 billion in donations in a sin
gle year. While most of this money is
committed to certain uses, some of it
is not, and this windfall reflects our
overall strong financial standing.
The ASSU should lobby for funds
where needed. We served during
the financial crisis, and many of our
plans were derailed rather swiftly,
as a result. We envy your opportuni
ty to serve in this moment.
And who should run? Good ques
tion. Other than the obvious answer
that we need people committed to
tackling serious problems, good
candidates: 1) Have led people and
groups before, 2) will work ex
tremely hard, 3) will respect the ad
ministration and students alike, 4)
will have the strength to push the
administration and student body to
tackle issues that matter most to
Stanford students and the broader
community, and 5) see the great po
tential latent in the ASSU and will
work hard to realize its promise.
We're both grad students now.
We've both led other organizations
outside the bubble. But running the
student government at Stanford re
mains the hardest job we've ever
held. If you run, you'll be in for a lot
of hard work. People will assume
you are in it for ego, glory, resume
bullets or some combination of all
the above. But if you decide to do
work that really matters, you could
have a serious impact. You could
build a Stanford where fewer stu
dents are sexually assaulted, sur
vivors are better supported, sui
cides are reduced and our students
and alumni use their lives to build a
better world. Run.

We believe
strongly in the
ASSU.
