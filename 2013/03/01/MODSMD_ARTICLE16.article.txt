the point standings with 439.5 total points.
USC trails Stanford by over 40 points while

Arizona sits farther back in third with 343.5
points. Coming in fourth with 330.5 points,
defending national champion Cal has a lot of
catching up to do.
Sophomore sprint specialist Maddy
Schaefer just missed out on a gold medal with
a second-place finish in the 50-yard freestyle,
clocking a blistering time of 22.12. Junior
Maya Dißado touched the wall in fourth in

medalist Caitlin Leverenz, Dißado's time was
well under the automatic NCAA qualifying
time.

resumes tomorrow.
