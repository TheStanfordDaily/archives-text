# Doubles Weekend
## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 41 Stanford men's
tennis team will be on the road
again this weekend, traveling
to La Jolla, Calif., for the 124 th
Annual Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Championship.
The event, which runs from
Thursday to Sunday, is held at
the La Jolla Beach & Tennis
Club. According to the United
States Tennis Association (US
TA), the tournament is the sec
ond oldest in the United
States. It is open to the nation's
top collegiate doubles teams,
though players of all ages can
register independently.
After suffering four
straight losses, the Cardinal is
hoping to regain momentum
with a strong showing in La
Jolla. The Stanford team of
Bradley Klahn and Ryan
Thacher, who graduated in
2012, took the event's top title
in the past two years. The
team's younger players are
now looking to take their place.
"We've had pretty good
success and hopefully we can
have success this year again,"
sophomore Robert Stineman
said. "It's been a good tourna
ment for the Cardinal, for sure."
However, the tournament
will provide plenty of competi
tion from both collegiate play
ers and players who registered
independently.
According to tournament
director Bill Kellogg, teaching
professionals, former tour
players, college coaches and
even junior players have regis
tered as independent players
in the past. Previous tourna
ment champions include John

McEnroe, Bobby Riggs, Ted
Schroeder and Arthur Ashe.
Stanford graduates, includ
ing KC Corkery 'O6 and Blake
Muller 'O9 will be competing to
gether as independent players.
Corkeiy, who won the tourna
ment in 2005, was a three-time
All-American, an NCAA dou
bles champion and 2003's Pac
10 Freshman of the Year- dur
ing his time at Stanford.
Muller, who made it to the fi
nals of the tournament in 2007,
was an ITA Regional Doubles
champion.
Doubles teams from col
leges across the country, in
cluding UC-Berkeley, Univer
sity of San Diego, Villanova,
USC, UCLA and Pepperdine,
are also registered to play in
the event.
"It's got the best teams in
California playing in it, so the
competition is definitely very,
very high in terms of the dou
bles teams," said Stineman,
who played in the tournament
last year with sophomore John
Morrissey.
Stineman and Morrissey
were defeated in the round of
32 last year, while junior Jamin
Ball and senior Walker Kehrer
fell in the fourth round of the
consolations. Seniors Matt
Kandath and Denis Lin, who
were a ninth seed, fell in the
round of 64.
Stineman said that al
though the tournament is
"great competition," it's also a
nice break from the dual
matches that characterize the
rest of the season.
"There are a lot of cool
amenities that you have,"
Stineman said. "You get to stay
at the La Jolla Country Club,

which is right on the beach. You
get to use their facilities and
everything, and that country
club is really nice to spend the
rest of your days at when
you're not playing tennis."
Current Stanford players
registered for the event are
freshmen Nolan Paige, Trey
Strobel, Maciek Romanowicz
and Anthony Tsodikov, sopho
mores John Morrissey and
Robert Stineman, juniors
Daniel Ho and Jamin Ball and
seniors Matthew Kandath and
Denis Lin.
Stineman, who expects to
play with Romanowicz, said
that although all of the teams
will be trying to play their best
tennis, there is less pressure on
each individual team because
their matches are not con
tributing to a team total.
"There's not one team win
ner of the tournament, it's
more individual," Stineman
said. "You're still representing
your school, but you're playing
in an individualized format."
Stineman said that the
team is looking forward to
heading down to La Jolla,
where they plan to have dinner
with a local family and enjoy
time on the beach in between
matches.
"I think everyone's really
excited because it is such a
unique thing for college tennis
and it's a really cool venue to
play at," Stineman said. "You
don't get to play at these nice
clubs as much during college
tennis, so I think everyone is
very excited to go down
there."
