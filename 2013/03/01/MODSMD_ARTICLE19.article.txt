# AWARDS SEASON
## RED CARPET REPORT THE 						OSCARS 
### Renjie Wong I STAFF WRITER 
Once, when I was little, I met a
dog at the neighborhood
playground with the
strangest, most bulgy eyes I'd ever
seen. "Don't keep staring at them,"
cautioned my mother in her infinite
wisdom, "or they'll come out and get
you."
Watching Anne Hathaway on the
Oscars red carpet last Sunday, the
piece of maternal advice resurfaced
from the depths of my memory. As
the pointy bodice of Hathaway's
NSFW pink satin Prada column gown
stared back into the abyss of my soul,
I wondered what could ever cause the
normally elegant star to overlook a
faux pas as glaringly obvious as this.
But I suppose we shouldn't bust
out all the judgment on Hathaway;
she did, after all, deserve the Oscar for
her titillating performance in "Les
Mis," and it may very well have been a
little bit nippy that night. All I'm say
ing is, we all make fashion missteps,
and even the perkiest of celebrities

occasionally go bust in the style
department, too.
Indeed, Hollywood's biggest
night saw star after star step out in
breathtaking couture. My Hathaway
induced alarm quickly faded when
Jennifer Lawrence appeared, wearing
a gloriously regal Dior Couture gown
and looking every bit the New Look
debutante. Her hem may have tripped
her up en route to award collection,
but in our books, the only dignity that
took a tumble that night was that of
her competitors. Lawrence wasn't the
only one dressed by the vaunted
French couture house that night:
Charlize Theron's understated Dior
Couture column gown, replete with
embellished peplum and flowing
train, made her as resplendent as
Snow White next to her dwarves (i.e.
Kristin Chenoweth).
Metallic gowns were very much
the trend of the night, with Halle
Berry and Stacy Keibler wearing them
to phenomenal effect, as were embel

lished dresses, as sported by Amanda
Seyfried, Jessica Chastain and (jibes
aside) Chenoweth. Perhaps the most
breathtaking of all, however, was
Corinne Bishop: wearing a lush chif
fon gown with an intricately woven
bodice, the fresh-faced 18-year-old
daughter of Jamie Foxx worked the
red carpet with a grace even a sea
soned star would hope to possess.
Yet Hathaway wasn't the only
fashion blunder. While most dresses
erred on the side of caution, others
threw caution to the wind and by
that, we really mean they took it,
wrapped it up into a tiny little ball
and hurled it into the destructive hur
ricane of terrifyingly hideous fashion.
Olivia Munn who, we will admit,
isn't particularly noted for her subtle
ty turned up in a florid, gold-bro
caded, elaborately-pinned scarlet satin
Marchesa confection blatant pla
giarism of the polyester drapes in a
Vegas dim sum parlor I once ate at
very many years ago.
Amy Adams, who didn't so
much wear her voluminous grey
Oscar de la Renta gown as haul it, had
it bad too, looking like the unfortu
nate lovechild between a '7os bride
and the Ugly Duckling. One only
wonders how many Los Angeles fab
ric stores were raided and emptied of
their frilly ribbon inventories to create
this dress.
Brandi Glanville's bizarre gown,
which surprise, surprise was
from her own Brandß label, somehow
managed to simultaneously have too
much going on and reveal too much
skin. (We'll spare you the awful puns
this time ... breast assured.) Props to
her for making 40 the new just
turned-legal 18, but her sartorially
incontinent gown also looked as if it
desperately needed holding up. Also,
quick note to all prospective real
housewives of Beverly Hills: astrakhan
may be a key trend this season, but,
that close to the floor, it makes your

outfit virtually indistinguishable from
a $19.99 Ikea rug.
Menswear, too, had its fair share
of disappointments: in particular, the
übiquity of neckties at a formal event
like the Oscars was emblematic of the
dismal state of black tie in Hollywood.
Yes, Richard Gere/Dustin
Hoffinan/Liev Schreiber, we're talking
about you. (Tim Burton doesn't
count, because ... yeah.) The only
thing more horrifying than not wear
ing a bowtie to the Oscars is wearing a
pre-tied bowtie to the Oscars, and
those were upsettingly aplenty, too. I
have, in fact, come to think of them as
the strap-ons of the fashion world:
lifeless, uncomfortable and never
acceptable at formal events.
That said, some men clearly were
in their element in black tie. Daniel
Day-Lewis' bespoke midnight-blue,
shawl-collared tuxedo by Neapolitan
tailor Domenico Vacca rose above the
masses of black, while still remaining
well within the boundaries of accept
able eveningwear; an accomplished
shoemaker himself, he sported self
crafted calfskin dress loafers as a rak
ish departure from the standard-issue
black patent lace-ups.
But classic was elegant, too. A
collective sigh of contentment doubt
less arose from in front of TV screens
around the world when Chris Pine
trekked out (ha ... see what we did
there?) in an impeccable double
breasted tuxedo by Ermenegildo
Zegna, proving that nothing is more
flattering than a immaculately-cut
jacket; Hugh Jackman's take on the DB
tux, tailored by menswear maestro
Tom Ford, afforded a timeless elegance
seldom seen in Hollywood anymore.
I suppose, then, that my mother
was right about her advice, after all.
Whether for the breathtaking outfits
or for the ghastly getups, as long as
there will be red carpet events, I will
keep watching. They've come out and
got me.
