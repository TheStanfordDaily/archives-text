# SEXY TIME
## TREE SEX LABELING SEXUALITY 
### 
Am I gay? Many claim that
there is a spectrum of homo
sexuality, but what is the
extent to which we can be attracted to
or experiment with the same sex
without labeling ourselves or being
labeled as bisexual or gay?
I was 17 the first time I really
experimented sexually with another
woman. Although I had kissed girls
before during Spin The Bottle or for
silly reasons like attracting male atten
tion, this time was different. I was with
a group of friends: two girls and two
guys. One of the guys expressed interest
in trying group sex. It sounded exciting
to us, so we all agreed to give it a shot.
We got a hotel room for the night at a
local Marriott. Little did the reception
ist know a bunch of 17- and 18-year
olds were getting a room to have an
orgy of sorts. Or perhaps he did, but
didn't say anything. We got to the room
and awkwardly turned on the television
to delay our encounter. Finally, when it
seemed like nobody was going to initi
ate anything, I decided to start kissing

one of the guys. Since there were five of
us, what ensued seemed to be a pairing
off of people, and the extra person at
the time gave extra attention to one
pair. I ended up having sex with both a
man and a woman that night, and it
was a very positive and fun experience
for me. I have since had some sexual
encounters with women, but I have
only ever been emotionally attached to
men.
Does this experimentation con
stitute as being bisexual? My one con
cern I have with experimentation is
how it may negatively impact the pub
licity or diminish the importance of
rights for the LGBT community;
many people might argue, after wit
nessing a drunken kiss between two
people of the same sex, that things like
bisexuality are just trends or phases, as
opposed to real innate preferences. I
hate to put a label on my sexuality, but
how much does experimentation
define sexual orientation or prefer
ences, if at all? While college seems to
be a pivotal place for sexual discovery

and experimentation, at Stanford,
experiences often seem to be limited
by traditional labels and social norms.
In response to the preponder
ance of black-and-white definitions of
sexuality on campus, one self-identi
fied member of the LGBT communi
ty at Stanford commented, "I don't
think it's just 'straight' people's fault. I
think the gay community has this
notion that if you hook up with
someone of the same sex and don't
identify as 'bi' or 'gay,' then you are
'closeted' or 'repressed,' which is really
irritating because [sexuality] is so
fluid! Some guys might be sexually
interested in other guys, but not emo
tionally, and that's fine it doesn't
mean they're closeted."
As a culture, it seems we are
much more willing to accept women
experimenting with other women
(without branding them as queer),
while men who experiment with men
are often quickly labeled as gay. I
highly doubt that if Justin Bieber had
sung a rendition of Katy Perry's "I

Kissed a Girl" and called it "I Kissed a
Boy and I Liked It" that the song
would have been so easily accepted
and such a nationwide hit. In fact, his
sexuality would most likely still be
questioned in the tabloids. In truth,
though, I know many men who iden
tify as gay now who have had or still
sometimes enjoy sex with the "right"
woman. I also know some very
macho men who refuse even to hug
other men or even receive profession
al massages from male masseurs.
Another self-identified gay
Stanford male noted, "For me person
ally, before I identified as 'gay,' I was
much more attracted to women, and
after I became part of the 'gay' com
munity it became part of the sort of
culture and lifestyle so much that I
lost a lot of that previous attraction
and became more fixed [in terms of
orientation]. This is so sad because
ideally I think sexual liberation should
be about expanding our capacities for
pleasure and the idea that we just
won't fuck [or] have intimacy with

certain groups on something so arbi
trary as gender or race or ability is
really sad."
Stanford has a plethora of beau
tiful, talented and successful young
men and women. It is already difficult
enough to find a partner under nor
mative circumstances; why not make
it easier for ourselves and be open to
the possibility of less traditional expe
riences without having to be
"labeled"? I know a 50-year-old
woman who left her marriage of
almost 20 years when she fell in love
with a 45-year-old woman who had a
strictly heterosexual past. They are
now married and living together in
New York, but neither self-identifies
as straight, lesbian or bisexual. They
both say that they fell in love with a
person who just happened to be of
the same sex. Perhaps some people
are able to freely fall in love or have
sex with someone for that person's
overall qualities as an individual,
regardless of gender, and without the
need for sexual classification.

didn't say anything. We got to the room
and awkwardly turned on the television
to delay our encounter. Finally, when it
seemed like nobody was going to initi
ate anything, I decided to start kissing

one of the guys. Since there were five of
us, what ensued seemed to be a pairing
off of people, and the extra person at
the time gave extra attention to one
pair. I ended up having sex with both a
man and a woman that night, and it
was a very positive and fun experience
for me. I have since had some sexual
encounters with women, but I have
only ever been emotionally attached to
men.
Does this experimentation con
stitute as being bisexual? My one con
cern I have with experimentation is
how it may negatively impact the pub
licity or diminish the importance of
rights for the LGBT community;
many people might argue, after wit
nessing a drunken kiss between two
people of the same sex, that things like
bisexuality are just trends or phases, as
opposed to real innate preferences. I
hate to put a label on my sexuality, but
how much does experimentation
define sexual orientation or prefer
ences, if at all? While college seems to
be a pivotal place for sexual discovery

and experimentation, at Stanford,
experiences often seem to be limited
by traditional labels and social norms.
In response to the preponder
ance of black-and-white definitions of
sexuality on campus, one self-identi
fied member of the LGBT communi
ty at Stanford commented, "I don't
think it's just 'straight' people's fault. I
think the gay community has this
notion that if you hook up with
someone of the same sex and don't
identify as 'bi' or 'gay,' then you are
'closeted' or 'repressed,' which is really
irritating because [sexuality] is so
fluid! Some guys might be sexually
interested in other guys, but not emo
tionally, and that's fine it doesn't
mean they're closeted."
As a culture, it seems we are
much more willing to accept women
experimenting with other women
(without branding them as queer),
while men who experiment with men
are often quickly labeled as gay. I
highly doubt that if Justin Bieber had
sung a rendition of Katy Perry's "I

Kissed a Girl" and called it "I Kissed a
Boy and I Liked It" that the song
would have been so easily accepted
and such a nationwide hit. In fact, his
sexuality would most likely still be
questioned in the tabloids. In truth,
though, I know many men who iden
tify as gay now who have had or still
sometimes enjoy sex with the "right"
woman. I also know some very
macho men who refuse even to hug
other men or even receive profession
al massages from male masseurs.
Another self-identified gay
Stanford male noted, "For me person
ally, before I identified as 'gay,' I was
much more attracted to women, and
after I became part of the 'gay' com
munity it became part of the sort of
culture and lifestyle so much that I
lost a lot of that previous attraction
and became more fixed [in terms of
orientation]. This is so sad because
ideally I think sexual liberation should
be about expanding our capacities for
pleasure and the idea that we just
won't fuck [or] have intimacy with

certain groups on something so arbi
trary as gender or race or ability is
really sad."
Stanford has a plethora of beau
tiful, talented and successful young
men and women. It is already difficult
enough to find a partner under nor
mative circumstances; why not make
it easier for ourselves and be open to
the possibility of less traditional expe
riences without having to be
"labeled"? I know a 50-year-old
woman who left her marriage of
almost 20 years when she fell in love
with a 45-year-old woman who had a
strictly heterosexual past. They are
now married and living together in
New York, but neither self-identifies
as straight, lesbian or bisexual. They
both say that they fell in love with a
person who just happened to be of
the same sex. Perhaps some people
are able to freely fall in love or have
sex with someone for that person's
overall qualities as an individual,
regardless of gender, and without the
need for sexual classification.
