# OTHELLO
## StanShakes takes on tragic love story with a twist 
### Nikhita Obeegadoo | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This winter StanShakes, Stanford's well
loved Shakespeare Company, strikes
again. Unlike last quarter, when it won us
over through "clean, raunchy, intelligent humor,"
it is through heart-wrenching tragedy that
StanShakes makes its presence felt with this pro
duction.
There are perhaps no better words to
describe "Othello" than deep, dark and intense.
While adapting it to the modern context, the
Stanford Shakespeare Company still maintains
the dramatic splendor of one of the world's
greatest tragedies. Among the most original fea
tures of this adaptation are the color scheme
that never strays far from the intermingling of
black, white and grey; the underlying theme of
war in a modern context; and the gender-bend
ing that turns lago and Amelia into a lesbian
couple.
The acting is, as usual, top-notch. Diante
Singley 'l4, as Othello, subjugates the audience
by the potency of his performance; whether he is
exploding with fury or drowning in his own
tears, it is hard to take one's eyes off of him due
to the sheer intensity he brings to the role.
Nora Tjossem 'l5 slips into the character of
the scheming and conniving villain lago with
consummate skill, with everything from the
rolling of her eyes to the inflections of her voice
enhancing the irony in her character's lines. I
guarantee that you will leave the performance
convinced that lago could never have been
played by anyone but a woman.
With most of the play riding on their
shoulders, their performances alone make the
play worth seeing the remaining cast and
production elements make it a play not to be
missed.
Desdemona (Rachel Purcell 'l3) is as
unfailingly sweet and submissive as the character
demands; Cassio (Kevin Heller 'l6) is brilliant in
the scene of bitter repentance following his
drunken folly; Amelia (Sunny Huang 'l4) is a
revelation in the last scene of mounting tension
and multiple deaths.
As is their tradition every year, StanShakes
looked for a setting that would be particularly
appropriate for their play. This year their choice
was the Elliott Programming Center near Lake
Lagunita, which works well, especially in con
junction with the lighting effects. The sound
effects were few and far between, but, when
used, greatly enhanced the dramatic effective
ness of the play.
The costumes, overseen by Juliet Charnas
'l5, added much to the overall flavor of the play:
apart from the originality of the color scheme,
the choice of garments be it the flowing white
dress intended to convey Desdemona's chastity

or the sharp tailor suit designed to underline
lago's conniving nature was right on.
It is no small feat to do justice to one of the
most poignant tragic plays of Western tradition.
To make it adaptable to the modern context is
admirable, but to add to this mix a good dose of
originality does not fall short of impressive.
"Othello" is yet another play that StanShakes can
be proud of.
A WORD WITH...
The Director
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4 is the man behind the
play, the one whose artistic vision has propelled
"Othello" from a germinating idea to the stage.
For Hurlbutt, war and racism were two of the
concerns at the very heart of the play.
"We set the play in the modern world, part
ly in a fictional country called Venice and partly
in Cyprus where the war is being fought,"
Hurlbutt said. "That idea of being involved mili
tarily in countries that are very far away is very
present in America today.
"lago's whole intention to use other people
as pawns and to engage behind the scene is par
alleled by the way in which warfare is changing
these days, with the use of drones and cyber
attacks," Hurlbutt explained. "Our greatest war
riors are no longer storming battlefields but are
working behind computer screens to order and
execute attacks.
"Our design aesthetic is black and white
because one of the major themes of' Othello' is
racism," he continued, "and we [convey] this
idea of a world that desperately needs Othello
but doesn't realize that it doesn't treat black peo
ple very well."
Othello
Diante Singley 'l4 finds that Othello stands out
from all Shakespeare's other tragic heroes.
"Othello is very different from
Shakespeare's other tragic heroes because
although he has a high status and is respected,
he is also so loathed because of his racial back
ground because of who he is and what he
looks like that it adds a completely new ele
ment [to the play]," he said.
He also talks about how this is a play that
Stanford students can relate to.
"This is about someone who's been
shunned and found him disgusting for what he
looks like and the people he represents for his
whole life by women," Singley said. "He finally
finds this woman who loves him and is perfect
for him, and then it's all ruined. I feel that story,
in essence, minus the murder and the cheating,
is something that Stanford students can relate to:
the idea of finding love and losing it before you

can actually see whether it works really works."
lago
Nora Tjossem 'l5 explored how transform
ing a traditionally male character into a woman
has repercussions throughout the whole play.
"The theme of suspicion is very different
when it's in a female relationship [between
Amelia and lago], and theme of women in the
army and of having a female being overlooked
for promotion is introduced," Tjossem said.
One question was always on her mind
when she read or rehearsed the play: "As a
women, how would you be thinking of these
issues, and how does that change the nuances of
the play?"
Tjossem also spoke about ambition as one
of the prime themes of Othello.
"I think in Silicon Valley especially, there is
a view of ambition as a really good thing," she
said. "For the most part, Stanford students are
not cutthroat, but I think it's a really fine line to
tread. Something in lago that's really painful is
that he keeps over-reaching, and you want to tell
him to hold back. You feel there's no way he can
get out of this unscathed.
"Like Satan in Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' lago
is multi-faceted, and we can identify with him."
Desdemona
Rachel Purcell 'l3 put forward her concep
tion of "Othello" as, first and foremost, a tragic
love story.
"'Othello' is one of the best experiences I've
had because we've been emphasizing the text a
lot," she said. "There's so much about love and
jealousy and betrayal and the human experience
it's a tragic love story."
On the flawed nature of Othello and
Desdemona's relationship, Purcell elaborated, "It
was hard playing Desdemona because in many
ways she's kind of the opposite of what a mod
ern woman is told she should be; she loves him

although he lashes out and hits her, and stands
by him until he is literally killing her ... The
audience needs to remember that this is a 16th
century text, and we can't judge it by our stan
dards.
"I think that she does have a more complex
character she has her own rebellious streak
and motivations, although she eventually gives
her life for love," Purcell said.
The Costumes Director
For Juliet Charnas 'l5, the limited color
scale and specific setting made this an experi
ence unlike any she had ever encountered
before.
"'Othello' is set on a modern-day military
base, so it's a lot of suits and ties and button-up
shirts, a lot of stuff that's easier for me to buy
rather than actually make, so I haven't done
much original sewing for the show," Charnas
said.
"The director has everything set in black
and white, which is interesting but difficult for
costumes," she continued. "You don't want to
have the all same color on stage at the same time
we're trying to work with the grey scale and
make it look like a diverse body of costumes.
"We also have really cool badges!"
