# AND ALL THAT JAZZ
## JAZZ QUARTET LIGHTS UP OAKLAND 
### Alexandra Heeney | STAFF WRITER 
The great jazz saxophonist Chris Potter
brought his newest project as a band
leader, the Chris Potter Quartet, to
Yoshi's Oakland last Sunday for a fantastic show.
Since his career began 20 years ago, Potter has
distinguished himself as one of the very best and
most virtuosic saxophonists on the scene, equal
ly comfortable as a sideman for bassist Dave
Holland in his progressive Dave Holland
Quintet as with the more traditional pianist
McCoy Tyner at Herbst Theatre in 2011. He's
amassed an impressive resume as a sideman
with much of the who's who of jazz today,
including recently with the new Axis Quartet
with Joshua Redman.
But he is equally capable as a bandleader,
first as the head of Underground, a group that
was part fusion, part rock, and now with his first
acoustic ensemble, the Quartet. Potter has a sim
ilar approach as a bandleader as Holland,
emphasizing collaboration among the band
especially for solos, rather than a simple trading
off between musicians: the key is to be in tune
with the entire group all the time and constantly
responding to and building on what the other

musicians are doing.
The Chris Potter Quartet has a classical
sensibility: the music is controlled and thought
ful, at times elegiacal, much like Branford
Marsalis's "Songs of Mirth and Melancholy" or
Brad Mehldau's "Highway Rider." This is partly a
product of the unique musicians and their
musical experience and propensities. On bass is
Larry Grenadier, who has been playing consis
tently with Brad Mehldau's Trio, and he anchors
the group without taking the spotlight. Eric
Harland is on the drums, bringing his experi
ence playing innovative rhythms in more pro
gressive ensembles like several of Holland's
groups, including the Dave Holland Overtones
and Prism projects, as well as the collaborative
James Farm Band with Joshua Redman. And rel
ative newcomer, Cuban pianist David Virelles,
one of Jane Bunnett's proteges, holds his own
with the group, using his Latin jazz and bebop
training to give the group an unconventional
but very pleasing sound.
The two sets at Yoshi's were to promote the
Chris Potter Quartet's new album, released just
two weeks ago, "The Sirens," which takes its
name from the characters in Homer's "Odyssey,"
upon which the album is based. This acoustic
album, and thus Potter's set, may be his most
accessible and best to date; gone are much of the
dissonant sound walls from his more progressive
work, replaced by beautiful melodies that still
have an edge. While the album is excellent, there
is no substitute for seeing Potter live; he's one of
the very best improvisers and always present on
stage, which gives his shows an amazing energy
that cannot be captured in recordings.
The first set included several pieces from
this album, starting with the contemplative

"Wine Dark Sea," which faded seamlessly into
the more mellow "Wayside," with Potter doing
an impressive extended solo on tenor sax. He
paid tribute to Paul Motian, with whom he has
played as a sideman, in "The Owl of Cranston"
on soprano sax, with soft cymbals setting the
mood, and a lovely, calm solo on bass. One of
the highlights was Chris Potter's tenor sax solo
on the calypso piece "Kalypso," full of energy

and depth, and perhaps most surprisingly, quot
ing from the old standard "Pick Yourself Up"
not quite repertoire usually associated with
Potter. They finished the set with the eerily invit
ing yet melancholic title song from the album,
"The Sirens," which saw bassist Larry Grenadier
bowing an entrancing solo. The group received a
well-earned standing ovation for what was a
truly amazing evening of acoustic jazz.
