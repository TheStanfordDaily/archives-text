## Elam, ASSU discuss scheduling Vice Provost welcomes greater student input in decision-making process 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
Amidst student discontent over proposed changes
to class scheduling, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Harry Elam met with ASSU representa
tives and concerned students Thursday evening in a
session that eventually prompted a consensus toward
fostering greater student involvement in University
decision-making processes.

The meeting, which had been scheduled by the AS
SU Undergraduate Senate's Academic Affairs com
mittee, was initially framed as an opportunity to en
gage in discussion with Elam on subjects ranging from
advising to freshman academic requirements. Ques
tioning from the 20 students present focused exclu
sively, however, on prospective scheduling changes
that would, among other aspects, situate popular and
required classes at early morning times and preclude
students from scheduling overlapping classes.
Senator Shahab Fadavi 'l5, chair of the Academic
Affairs committee, opened the agenda by welcoming
Elam's presence at the meeting and
willingness to interact with stu
dents.
"He has been one of the most re
sponsive and engaged [administra
tors] with students," Fadavi noted.
Elam sought to alleviate student
concerns about the proposed re
forms, emphasizing that a more
streamlined class schedule and a
greater effort to inform departments
of potential clashes would limit
the number of conflicts students
might experience, while also easing
issues with classroom scheduling.
"[Clashes are] going to be the ex
ception rather than the rule," Elam
said.
While Elam noted that neither
he nor Registrar Tom Black, who
has developed the proposed re
forms, would be able to tell depart
ments when to schedule classes, he
said that he would instead advise
them to take advantage of earlier
starting times for popular courses.
In a recent Faculty Senate meet
ing, Richard Sailer, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
noted that human biology the
second-most popular major among
undergraduates would likely
shift core courses to 8:30 a.m. start
ing times. Elam cited language
courses as another group of classes

that would likely be moved to earli
er times.
William Dement, a professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences
who teaches the popular Sleep and
Dreams class, argued that the pro
posed scheduling changes would ex
acerbate an already prominent is
sue among Stanford students
that of sleep deprivation.
"It fails to recognize the basic
physiology of college students," De
ment argued, noting that the aver
age bedtime of Stanford students is
2:30 a.m.
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6, who
composed a petition protesting the
proposed changes that gathered
over 1,500 signatures in less than a
day, argued that the lack of student
consultation was concerning given
the evident relevance to the student
body as a whole. Black and Elam had
consulted 12 undergraduates in the
course of finalizing their proposal.
"It seems like yet another exam
ple of top-down implementation
that makes student life worse,"
Mouzykantskii said.
Elam acknowledged the exis
tence of discontent among faculty
members as well as students, but
framed the changes as necessary.
"[lnforming students] is some
thing we have to do better," Elam
conceded.

Dement argued that the revised
scheduling could eventually prompt
more dire consequences, such as
Stanford's liability for injuries sus
tained by students through a lack of

sleep.
A meeting attendee expressed
concern that the change, while ben
eficial to student-athletes who
might otherwise be unable to access
classes like Introductory Seminars,
failed to take into account the much
larger remainder of the student
body that does work and extracur
ricular activities at night.
"All of these other constituencies
... we have a vested interest in be
ing able to sleep late at night and
later into the morning," he said. "I
feel like you aren't taking into con
sideration the less visible groups on
campus that this would severely im
pact."
Senator Daniela Olivos 'l5 ex
pressed support for Black and
Elam's efforts to accommodate
varying interests in putting forward
their proposal, but acknowledged
the need for greater collaboration
between the University and the stu
dent body as a whole.
"We nominate students to be in
committees, but there's a big gap in
what happens in committees and
what information is given to the
larger student body," Olivos said.
Elam concluded the meeting af
ter an hour, applauding the con
structive nature of the student dia
logue and encouraging students to
attend the Faculty Senate meeting
on March 7, at which Black's pro
posal will be further debated.
