# CS class works with industry
## BMW, Facebook among partner firms 
### GRACE CHAO 
Come spring break, Dhruv Amin
'l4 and four classmates will be flown
all expenses paid to meet with
executives from BMW at the compa
ny's headquarters in Munich, Ger
many. And it's all part of a class.
The group's trip will mark the
midway point of their project for
CS 210: Software Project Experi
ence with Corporate Partners, a
two-quarter course developed by
Jay Borenstein '93 M.S. '94, a com
puter science lecturer.
In CS 210, student teams work
with corporations like BMW to devel
op software that solves a challenge
the company faces. Eight corpora
tions, including Facebook, Samsung
and SAT) have sponsored a total of 16
teams this year. Teams will present
their finished software product at the
Stanford Software Faire in June.
Since the course was first intro
duced five years ago, enrollment has
grown from 12 students to 77.
Though Borenstein had capped CS
210 at 30 students in previous years,
he decided to double the class size
this year to meet skyrocketing inter
est and still had to turn away 15 to 20
students.
According to Borenstein, one of
the reasons why so many students
are attracted to the class is that it
provides real-world experience in the
various facets of entrepreneurship.
"It's an exciting time for comput
er scientists to be able to do things
entrepreneurially," Borenstein said.
"We want to equip them with the per

spective of how they might use those
skills to deliver in society."
Evelyn Gillie 'lO M.S. '12 —who
enrolled in CS 210 in 2010 and who
served as a course assistant in 2011
and 2012 said that, although each
coiporation offers teams different
challenges, the projects are similar in
purpose.
"[lt] can be thought of as a re
search product [the corporation]
might not want to dedicate its own
employees to work on, but belongs to
a field that it's interested in and
wants to explore for the future,"
Gillie said. "They want young, cre
ative minds."
Students spend the first three
weeks of the course participating in
team-building exercises and learning
how to manage a large-scale project.
They are then paired with companies
based on ranking preferences that
are run through a matching algo
rithm.
Borenstein said he aims for diver
sity when selecting partner corpora
tions and expressed appreciation for
previous partners that have provided
helpful liaisons to the CS 210 teams.
Each company must provide an
affiliate fee of $75,000 per team,
which covers the costs of sending
teams to corporate headquarters,
team resource budgets and salaries
for the teaching team, which con
sists of Borenstein and three course
assistants.
SARa company that specializes in
business management software, is
currently collaborating with
CS 210 for the second year.
SAP's 2012 student team
created Boutique.ly, a Pin
terest-like product with a
commercial spin that received
the "Best Overall Idea"
award at the Stanford Soft
ware Faire.
Anthony Reynolds, chief
operating officer of SAP's
Global Solutions and Mobility
Division and SAP's liaison with
the CS 210 teams, called the
project "remarkable" and said
that SAP has benefitted from
the collaboration in many
ways.
"We [can] recruit some of
the best students from the
Bay Area, and we have a big
focus on learning from the mil
lennial generation," Reynolds
said. "We know that the work
place is changing, and we can
learn more from how Stan
ford students work."
Other partner companies,

such as BMV\7 are matched
with multiple CS 210 teams
in one year. This year, BMW
asked its three teams to cre
ate a valuable, wearable in
terface that utilizes both the
BMW vehicle and the Pebble
smartwatch a watch that
connects to smartphones and
offers a variety of applications
and alerts.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, a member of one of the
teams sponsored by
said that the weeks spent
brainstorming a product are
the most challenging.
"We've got to create a
product that we're passionate
about [that also] has market
ing opportunity, data sup
porting our hunches, good
user feedback," Trusheim
said. "Something we can
come back to and say, 'We did
a good thing there.'"
Amin, who is on a sepa
rate team also sponsored by
BMW, is working to code
software that can quantify
driving skills by collecting
various metrics from the car.
The team's algorithm will
translate these metrics, such

as speed, acceleration, the
lane the car is driving in and
its distance from the car in
front of it, into a "driving
score" to allow the consumer
to improve his or her driving
ability over time.
Amin said that the course
teaches a variety of entrepre
neurial skills, including build
ing a product from the
ground up and managing a
budget, that he sees as ex
tremely valuable.
"This class gives you a re
al-world experience," Amin
said. "I'm blown away by the
quality of the class."

Come spring break, Dhruv Amin
'l4 and four classmates will be flown
all expenses paid to meet with
executives from BMW at the compa
ny's headquarters in Munich, Ger
many. And it's all part of a class.
The group's trip will mark the
midway point of their project for
CS 210: Software Project Experi
ence with Corporate Partners, a
two-quarter course developed by
Jay Borenstein '93 M.S. '94, a com
puter science lecturer.
In CS 210, student teams work
with corporations like BMW to devel
op software that solves a challenge
the company faces. Eight corpora
tions, including Facebook, Samsung
and SAT) have sponsored a total of 16
teams this year. Teams will present
their finished software product at the
Stanford Software Faire in June.
Since the course was first intro
duced five years ago, enrollment has
grown from 12 students to 77.
Though Borenstein had capped CS
210 at 30 students in previous years,
he decided to double the class size
this year to meet skyrocketing inter
est and still had to turn away 15 to 20
students.
According to Borenstein, one of
the reasons why so many students
are attracted to the class is that it
provides real-world experience in the
various facets of entrepreneurship.
"It's an exciting time for comput
er scientists to be able to do things
entrepreneurially," Borenstein said.
"We want to equip them with the per

spective of how they might use those
skills to deliver in society."
Evelyn Gillie 'lO M.S. '12 —who
enrolled in CS 210 in 2010 and who
served as a course assistant in 2011
and 2012 said that, although each
coiporation offers teams different
challenges, the projects are similar in
purpose.
"[lt] can be thought of as a re
search product [the corporation]
might not want to dedicate its own
employees to work on, but belongs to
a field that it's interested in and
wants to explore for the future,"
Gillie said. "They want young, cre
ative minds."
Students spend the first three
weeks of the course participating in
team-building exercises and learning
how to manage a large-scale project.
They are then paired with companies
based on ranking preferences that
are run through a matching algo
rithm.
Borenstein said he aims for diver
sity when selecting partner corpora
tions and expressed appreciation for
previous partners that have provided
helpful liaisons to the CS 210 teams.
Each company must provide an
affiliate fee of $75,000 per team,
which covers the costs of sending
teams to corporate headquarters,
team resource budgets and salaries
for the teaching team, which con
sists of Borenstein and three course
assistants.
SARa company that specializes in
business management software, is
currently collaborating with
CS 210 for the second year.
SAP's 2012 student team
created Boutique.ly, a Pin
terest-like product with a
commercial spin that received
the "Best Overall Idea"
award at the Stanford Soft
ware Faire.
Anthony Reynolds, chief
operating officer of SAP's
Global Solutions and Mobility
Division and SAP's liaison with
the CS 210 teams, called the
project "remarkable" and said
that SAP has benefitted from
the collaboration in many
ways.
"We [can] recruit some of
the best students from the
Bay Area, and we have a big
focus on learning from the mil
lennial generation," Reynolds
said. "We know that the work
place is changing, and we can
learn more from how Stan
ford students work."
Other partner companies,

such as BMV\7 are matched
with multiple CS 210 teams
in one year. This year, BMW
asked its three teams to cre
ate a valuable, wearable in
terface that utilizes both the
BMW vehicle and the Pebble
smartwatch a watch that
connects to smartphones and
offers a variety of applications
and alerts.
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 M.S.
'l4, a member of one of the
teams sponsored by
said that the weeks spent
brainstorming a product are
the most challenging.
"We've got to create a
product that we're passionate
about [that also] has market
ing opportunity, data sup
porting our hunches, good
user feedback," Trusheim
said. "Something we can
come back to and say, 'We did
a good thing there.'"
