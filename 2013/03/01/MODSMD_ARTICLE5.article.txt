Sitting outside the CoHo in a black Portland Trail
Blazers T-shirt with coffee in hand, Jimmy Fowkes
'l4 could easily pass for your average Stanford stu
dent.
A self-proclaimed atheist majoring in religious
studies, Fowkes hails from Portland, Ore. He lives in
Potter House and spends much of his Sundays with
his Mends watching football, his favorite sport.
Fowkes has also fought a continuous battle
against brain cancer for the past seven years.
As a 13-year-old, Fowkes was diagnosed with
medulloblastoma a highly malignant brain tumor
on Jan. 11,2006. Fowkes said that his initial reac
tion to the news was a mix of shock and fear.
"I was terrified," he said. "Because when you
hear you have cancer, you think you're going to die."
After his diagnosis, he spent six days in the inten
sive care unit of his local hospital. During that time,
Fowkes' father signed him up for the Livestrong
Challenge, the signature fundraising event for seven
time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong's non
profit organization Livestrong, which seeks to help
people affected by cancer. The Challenge consisted of
a bike ride anywhere from 15 to 100 miles, with all
proceeds being donated to cancer support or re
search.
"Lance [Armstrong] was really the only cancer
survivor my dad had ever heard of or knew of, so he
signed us up," Fowkes said.

Despite Lance Armstrong's recent confession of
doping, Jimmy Fowkes '14, first diagnosed with
a brain tumor at age 13, remains an avid supporter
of Armstrong's foundation, Livestrong.
