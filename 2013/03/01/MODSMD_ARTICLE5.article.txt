## Junior battles cancer, supports Livestrong cause 
### NIUNIU TEO 
Sitting outside the CoHo in a black Portland Trail
Blazers T-shirt with coffee in hand, Jimmy Fowkes
'l4 could easily pass for your average Stanford stu
dent.
A self-proclaimed atheist majoring in religious
studies, Fowkes hails from Portland, Ore. He lives in
Potter House and spends much of his Sundays with
his Mends watching football, his favorite sport.
Fowkes has also fought a continuous battle
against brain cancer for the past seven years.
As a 13-year-old, Fowkes was diagnosed with
medulloblastoma a highly malignant brain tumor
on Jan. 11,2006. Fowkes said that his initial reac
tion to the news was a mix of shock and fear.
"I was terrified," he said. "Because when you
hear you have cancer, you think you're going to die."
After his diagnosis, he spent six days in the inten
sive care unit of his local hospital. During that time,
Fowkes' father signed him up for the Livestrong
Challenge, the signature fundraising event for seven
time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong's non
profit organization Livestrong, which seeks to help
people affected by cancer. The Challenge consisted of
a bike ride anywhere from 15 to 100 miles, with all
proceeds being donated to cancer support or re
search.
"Lance [Armstrong] was really the only cancer
survivor my dad had ever heard of or knew of, so he
signed us up," Fowkes said.

Despite Lance Armstrong's recent confession of
doping, Jimmy Fowkes '14, first diagnosed with
a brain tumor at age 13, remains an avid supporter
of Armstrong's foundation, Livestrong.
What started as simply a
fitness goal quickly blossomed
into something much more.
"When I was in recovery I
ended up reading Lance's
book [lt's Not About the Bike],
and everything that he had
done really inspired me to
fundraise," Fowkes said.
Instead of simply paying
the $5OO minimum to partici
pate in the challenge, Fowkes
turned to fundraising, solicit
ing his immediate community
of relatives and friends for con
tributions to his cause.
"The response was incredi
ble," he said. "I ended up rais
ing something like $33,000 in
my first year. I just really real
ized how much support I had
from my friends and family
and how much they cared
about me and wanted to help."
His success fundraising
that year did not go unnoticed.
As he hit $17,000, Fowkes got a
phone call from Renee
Nicholas, a Livestrong staff
member.
"She said, 'Lance is doing
an event over at the 24-Hour
Fitness [in Portland], and
Lance wants to meet Jimmy,"'
Fowkes said. "So I went over
to the 24-Hour Fitness and got
to meet him."
Nicholas has since become
close with Fowkes through his
continued involvement with
Livestrong.
"I really just had an imme
diate connection and a tremen
dous amount of admiration for
his courage and intellect and
really just general spirit,"

Nicholas said. "He was a really
remarkable person, and that
was evident even at a really
young age."
In the following years,
Nicholas and the other staff
members at Livestrong be
came an indispensable source
of support, guidance and
friendship for Fowkes and his
family.
"Going into it, I think I just
was kind of alone and didn't
know anyone else with cancer,"
Fowkes said. "I had had lots of
support from my family and
friends and everything, but
[Livestrong] was really the
first time I could meet other
cancer survivors and talk
about their experiences."
Allison Watkins, currently
on the marketing team for
Livestrong, also met Fowkes
in 2006 through his first Live
strong Challenge.
"I think a lot of his success
came from being really open
and honest," she said. "He was
able, at a really young age, to
tell his story and tell what was
going on with his diagnosis.
People were really drawn to
that."
However, Fowkes' relation
ship with Armstrong was per
haps the most unique. Arm
strong even hosted the Fowkes
family when they went to Eu
rope during the Tour de
France one year.
"When we were over in
Italy and France, we went and
saw his tour, he took me on the
team bus and introduced me to
his people," Fowkes said. "He's
a really nice guy, and I don't
think that the media sees that
side of him."

Fowkes and Armstrong
have remained close over the
years even after Armstrong

ended his professional racing
career. Armstrong rode for
Fowkes in the 2010 Tour of
California, an 810-mile bike
route during which Armstrong
crashed only a few miles into
the race. Coincidently, Arm
strong's crash came the day he
was first accused of doping by
Tour de France teammate
Floyd Landis.
Fowkes declined to com
ment on Armstrong's drug
scandal, though he did express
disappointment at the fact that
Armstrong has been depicted
by the media as a "bad person"
despite his work with cancer
survivors.
"He's been labeled as a bad
person," Fowkes said. "I won't
tell you whether he's a bad per
son or a good person, but I
think there's a side of Lance
that people really get to see,
and I think that it's a side that's
been really good to me and al
so really, really cares about
helping cancer survivors."
Fowkes said that Arm
strong's departure from Live
strong after the scandal broke
had upset him.
"I think to a certain extent
the foundation needs him, and
to a certain extent he needs the
foundation as well," he said.
Despite this controversy,
Fowkes insisted that Arm
strong will continue to serve as
a role model for cancer sur
vivors across the world.
"He was a huge inspiration,
especially when I was first di
agnosed," Fowkes said. "He
had this approach to battling
cancer as more of a fight, in
stead of just 'l'll get treatment
and hopefully it works.' So it's
been a goal of mine throughout
my treatment to stay involved
with my regular life as much as
possible."

Nearing normalcy
Fowkes returned to middle
school two weeks after being
released from the hospital af
ter his first diagnosis.
In high school, Fowkes was
an honor roll student, a mem
ber of the junior varsity soccer
team and an active participant
within Livestrong. Since his
first fundraiser, Fowkes has
raised more than $200,000 for
the foundation.
During his senior year of
high school, Fowkes was ac
cepted into Stanford, his first
choice. Watkins and Nichols
reflected with pride on his ac
complishment.
"In my cube, I have a pic
ture of Jimmy and his parents

on the day that he went to
Stanford, because that was a
huge moment for all of us,"
Watkins said. "He's been
through so much, and we did
n't know if he'd ever make it to
college."
Nicholas visited Fowkes at
Stanford for the first time
three weeks ago.
"I can imagine what it must
have felt like for his parents, as
someone who cares very much
for him, and saw him go
through a tremendous amount
of hardship and pain, and do it
with such bravery, such fight,
and such spirit," she said. "To
see him walking out of his
dorm dressed like any college
kid, knowing what he had to do
to get there I was over
whelmed with emotion."
Fowkes acknowledged that
balancing his life as a college
student and cancer survivor
has put things into perspective.
"I think [cancer] really
made me see things different
ly," he said. "It made me care a
lot more about other people,
and I think it made me a better
person."
Although Fowkes hopes to
major in religious studies, he
doesn't plan on continuing this
field of study after college. In
stead, he emphasized his de
sire to focus on providing en
couragement for others with
cancer.
"Ever since I've been diag
nosed, it's always been really
important to me to support
others battling cancer because
I've been through it and I hate
the fact that other people have
to go through the same thing
that I went through," Fowkes
said. "So it's something I'm
very passionate about, and I
could definitely see myself get
ting involved with some sort of
charity."
Fowkes suffered bouts of
his cancer at ages 13, 15 and
19. During the start of his jun
ior year, he underwent daily
chemotherapy sessions in an
effort to combat the disease.
His cancer metastasized to
other parts of his brain and his
spinal cord.
"People look at him as a
hero and an inspiration be
cause he's wise beyond his
years and he's accomplished so
much and been through so
much at a young age," Watkins
said. "I think he's really under
stands and embraces what it
means to live strong."
