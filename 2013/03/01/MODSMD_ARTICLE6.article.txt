## Interest in education minor, pre-ed group rises 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A surge of undergraduate interest in the
field of education has led to both a significant
rise in the number of education minors and
the formation of Stanford's first pre-profes
sional education group, according to Graduate
School of Education (GSE) administrators.
The GSE's undergraduate minor program
started in 2012, with only two students de
clared. That number grew to 12 in 2012 and is

expected to grow to 15 this year.
Jennifer Wolf M.A.'9l Ph.D. 'O5, director of
the GSE undergraduate minor program, em
phasized that the interest in the field of educa
tion among undergraduates is not limited to
those who declare the minor. Each fall, be
tween 50 and 70 students register for the
GSE's EDUCIOI: Introduction to Teaching
and Learning on average.
"People take our education classes for all
[kinds of] different reasons," Wolf said.
According to Wolf, those reasons include

fulfilling a sub-field of a declared major, un
derstanding how to teach the subject they are
majoring in and sheer personal interest.
Wolf argued that, given the variety of ap
proaches to education economical, psycho
logical and political, among others and the
variety of reasons to study education, it is im
portant to break the stereotype that students
interested in education go into teaching jobs.
"If you want to go into teaching, we want
to support you in that goal," Wolf
said. "But beyond that, we hope that
they [students] take education as a
kind of side-car to wherever they
want to go, because the successful
act of transference of knowledge
from a teacher to a learner is at the
core of all we do."
Erica Fernandez 'l2 M.A. 'l3, a
coterm student at the GSE who has
focused primarily on educational pol
icy with the aim of studying law in
the future, argued that education can
be a significant tool for social change
in the broader world, such as in ef
forts to improve literacy in her na
tive Mexico.
"In my masters at the GSE, I
bring together environment, educa
tion and immigration, three issues
that I really care about," Erica said.
"I want to change the educational
system [back home], and the only
way to change it is to understand
how it works."
Julia Quintero 'l5, on the other
hand, said that more attention
should be placed on guiding students
towards teaching careers.
"I think education, especially
teaching, is looked down upon at in
stitutions like Stanford," Quintero
said. "They see it as easier than oth
er careers, with not a lot of pay and
not a lot of prestige. That is frustrat
ing for me, because I know I want to
go into education."
While there are a number of edu
cation-related Voluntary Student Or
ganizations (VSOs) and nonprofits, in
cluding Students for Educational Re
form (SFER), there has never been a
pre-professional education group, as
there are for law and medicine.
Quintero has taken the lead in

creating Stanford's first such group
the Stanford Pre-Education Soci
ety. The group received official ap
proval as a voluntary student organ
ization last week.
She described her vision for the
Stanford Pre-Education Society as
one of a centralized place where un
dergraduates interested in educa
tion can learn about available re
sources and opportunities, talk to
people with experience and conse
quently make smart career choices.
'An important priority is taking
away the stigma around teaching at
Stanford," Quintero said. "I don't see
teaching as a two-year stint, I see it
as a career, and I feel it's a shame
that people who want to become
teachers feel like they shouldn't."
Christine Wotipka M.A '9l Ph.D.
'Ol, resident fellow at the Education
and Society Theme (EAST) house,
expressed support for Quintero's de
sire to create a more structured and
organized platform for education en
thusiasts.
"Having such a group would be
helpful to go hand in hand with what
we already have at the university,
and I would love to partner with
her," Wotipka said.
EAST, formerly the East Asian
Studies Theme house, shifted its fo
cus to the field of education three
years ago in response to the growing
undergraduate interest in education
and as a complement to the creation
of the GSE minor that same year.
One of the main goals of the
theme shift was to bring students
with an interest in education togeth
er and offer courses within the
house. However, EAST's resources
are not limited to residents.
"We have a weekly seminar,
EDUC 180 C, which is open to any
one on campus," Wotipika said.

teaching, is looked down upon at in
stitutions like Stanford," Quintero
said. "They see it as easier than oth
er careers, with not a lot of pay and
not a lot of prestige. That is frustrat
ing for me, because I know I want to
go into education."
While there are a number of edu
cation-related Voluntary Student Or
ganizations (VSOs) and nonprofits, in
cluding Students for Educational Re
form (SFER), there has never been a
pre-professional education group, as
there are for law and medicine.
Quintero has taken the lead in

creating Stanford's first such group
the Stanford Pre-Education Soci
ety. The group received official ap
proval as a voluntary student organ
ization last week.
She described her vision for the
Stanford Pre-Education Society as
one of a centralized place where un
dergraduates interested in educa
tion can learn about available re
sources and opportunities, talk to
people with experience and conse
quently make smart career choices.
'An important priority is taking
away the stigma around teaching at
Stanford," Quintero said. "I don't see
teaching as a two-year stint, I see it
as a career, and I feel it's a shame
that people who want to become
teachers feel like they shouldn't."
Christine Wotipka M.A '9l Ph.D.
'Ol, resident fellow at the Education
and Society Theme (EAST) house,
expressed support for Quintero's de
sire to create a more structured and
organized platform for education en
thusiasts.
"Having such a group would be
helpful to go hand in hand with what
we already have at the university,
and I would love to partner with
her," Wotipka said.
EAST, formerly the East Asian
Studies Theme house, shifted its fo
cus to the field of education three
years ago in response to the growing
undergraduate interest in education
and as a complement to the creation
of the GSE minor that same year.
One of the main goals of the
theme shift was to bring students
with an interest in education togeth
er and offer courses within the
house. However, EAST's resources
are not limited to residents.
"We have a weekly seminar,
EDUC 180 C, which is open to any
one on campus," Wotipika said.
