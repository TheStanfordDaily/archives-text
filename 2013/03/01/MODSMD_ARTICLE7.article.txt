# CARDINAL BASEBALL
## THE
						HORNS ARE BACK IN TOWN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Five-game winning streaks
don't happen on their own in
baseball, even against inferior op
position. So as the No. 16 Cardi
nal takes that momentum into a
measuring-stick home series with
No. 23 Texas this weekend, Stan
ford will look to remain potent at
the plate against a Longhorn
team making its first road trip of
the season.
The Cardinal (6-2) launched
five homers in its last four wins
it had none in the first four games
of 2013 and has scored seven
runs in three consecutive games,
while Texas (6-2) is coming off a 5-
3 midweek loss against Sam
Houston State.
Stanford hasn't lost a noncon
ference series at Sunken Dia
mond since 2009, when the Long
horns won two of three during
when else the third weekend
of the season. But if the Cardinal
keeps its hitting up, Texas will be
hard-pressed to pull that off
again.
