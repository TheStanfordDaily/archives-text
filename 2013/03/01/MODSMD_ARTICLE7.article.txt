# CARDINAL BASEBALL
## THE 						HORNS ARE BACK IN TOWN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Five-game winning streaks
don't happen on their own in
baseball, even against inferior op
position. So as the No. 16 Cardi
nal takes that momentum into a
measuring-stick home series with
No. 23 Texas this weekend, Stan
ford will look to remain potent at
the plate against a Longhorn
team making its first road trip of
the season.
The Cardinal (6-2) launched
five homers in its last four wins
it had none in the first four games
of 2013 and has scored seven
runs in three consecutive games,
while Texas (6-2) is coming off a 5-
3 midweek loss against Sam
Houston State.
Stanford hasn't lost a noncon
ference series at Sunken Dia
mond since 2009, when the Long
horns won two of three during
when else the third weekend
of the season. But if the Cardinal
keeps its hitting up, Texas will be
hard-pressed to pull that off
again.

23 Texas this weekend in a three
game homestand. The Cardinal is rid
ing a five-game winning streak and
will look to keep that momentum alive
against the Longhoms, who were the
last squad to win a nonconference se
ries at Sunken Diamond.


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Junior Lonnie Kauppila (above) takes a three-game
hitting streak into the weekend series against No. 23
Texas. The Cardinal is riding a five-game winning streak.

Consistent production
from the heart of the order
has sparked Stanford's cur
rent tear. The Cardinal's 2-5
hitters, juniors Danny
Diekroeger and Brian Ragi
ra, senior Justin Ringo and
sophomore Austin Slater, are
all hitting above .320 and
have combined for 18 of the
team's 31 total RBI.
But that success by regu
lar contributors has proven
contagious. After a slow
start to the season, highly
touted freshman center field
er Johnny Locher finally
notched the first three hits of
his Stanford career in Tues
day's 7-2 win at Saint Mary's.
Junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila is riding a three
game hitting streak after go
ing hitless in the team's first
five games and some depth
has emerged at the catcher
position, where weekend
starter Wayne Taylor and
midweek replacement Brant
Whiting have combined for
five hits in the Cardinal's last
two contests.
"I think all of our ap
proaches are better at the
plate," Whiting said after his
three-hit, two-RBI perform
ance on Tuesday. "We're get
ting better pitches to hit, see
ing the ball better. I know
early on, we were kind of
swinging out of the strike
zone."
Head coach Mark Mar
quess is still exercising his
options at the left fielder po
sition, where Stanford
starters have accounted for

just two hits in eight games.
That's a significant drop-off
from recent seasons, when
sluggers such as Tyler
Gaffney and Stephen Piscot
ty w ho signed with the Pi
rates and Cardinals respec
tively after their junior years
last June patrolled the
leftfield grass.
The Cardinal's pitching,
on the other hand, hasn't
dropped off one bit this sea
son. Stanford has posted a
1.76 team ERA since its
opening-weekend series loss
to Rice.
"It's huge [for the of
fense] ...just knowing that
even if we can't get the job
done in that inning, our
pitchers are going to give us
another chance the next in
ning," Whiting said.
"They're doing a great job.
We love them for it."
Senior ace Mark Appel
dominated the Longhorns at
Sunken Diamond in 2012,
taking a no-hitter into the
fifth and eventually striking
out 10 Texas batters in Stan
ford's 7-2 win. Then-fresh
man John Hochstatter was
also impressive in that se
ries, scattering five hits over
6.1 innings in a 15-1 Cardinal
triumph. With both hurlers
coming off their best starts
of the young season against
Fresno State a week ago, Ap
pel and Hochstatter will duel
with Longhorn sophomores
Parker French and Dillon Pe
ters on Friday and Saturday,
respectively.
The only real intrigue on
the mound will come in the
form of Stanford's Sunday
starter. The Bulldogs chased
freshman lefty Logan James
last Sunday from his second
Sunday start, but classmate

Bobby Zarubin mopped up
by allowing just one run over
6.2 innings to earn his first
career win. This early in the
season, expect Marquess to
ride the hot hand and reward
Zarubin with his first start
after two dominant relief
performances.
Stanford's staff will face a
middling Texas lineup that
has averaged 4.25 runs per
game this season. The Long
horns are led by a pair of jun
iors, right fielder Mark Pay
ton (hitting .536) and third
baseman Erich Weiss (.321),
though freshman shortstop
C.J. Hinojosa (.385) has
made an impact early in his
career as well.
Much like the Cardinal's,
Texas's pitching has carried
the team in the early going.
Four of the five starters have
an ERA of 2.53 or better, and
weekend hurlers French, Pe
ters and junior Nathan
Thornhill have averaged just
over six innings per outing.
The squad's two series wins
have come against unthreat
ening Sacramento State (4-4)
and Nebraska (0-7), so just
as Stanford's bats will be
looking to have a solid series
against the well-regarded
Longhorns, Texas's staff has
the chance to prove itself as a
true shutdown unit for the
first time.
Tonight's opener pits Ap
pel (1-1) against French (2-0)
at 5:30 p.m., with the Satur
day and Sunday games be
ginning at 1 p.m. KZSU will
broadcast the three games
and The Daily will liveblog
tonight's matchup starting
an hour before the game.

also impressive in that se
ries, scattering five hits over
6.1 innings in a 15-1 Cardinal
triumph. With both hurlers
coming off their best starts
of the young season against
Fresno State a week ago, Ap
pel and Hochstatter will duel
with Longhorn sophomores
Parker French and Dillon Pe
ters on Friday and Saturday,
respectively.
The only real intrigue on
the mound will come in the
form of Stanford's Sunday
starter. The Bulldogs chased
freshman lefty Logan James
last Sunday from his second
Sunday start, but classmate

Bobby Zarubin mopped up
by allowing just one run over
6.2 innings to earn his first
career win. This early in the
season, expect Marquess to
ride the hot hand and reward
Zarubin with his first start
after two dominant relief
performances.
Stanford's staff will face a
middling Texas lineup that
has averaged 4.25 runs per
game this season. The Long
horns are led by a pair of jun
iors, right fielder Mark Pay
ton (hitting .536) and third
baseman Erich Weiss (.321),
though freshman shortstop
C.J. Hinojosa (.385) has
made an impact early in his
career as well.
Much like the Cardinal's,
Texas's pitching has carried
the team in the early going.
Four of the five starters have
an ERA of 2.53 or better, and
weekend hurlers French, Pe
ters and junior Nathan
Thornhill have averaged just
over six innings per outing.
The squad's two series wins
have come against unthreat
ening Sacramento State (4-4)
and Nebraska (0-7), so just
as Stanford's bats will be
looking to have a solid series
against the well-regarded
Longhorns, Texas's staff has
the chance to prove itself as a
true shutdown unit for the
first time.
Tonight's opener pits Ap
pel (1-1) against French (2-0)
at 5:30 p.m., with the Satur
day and Sunday games be
ginning at 1 p.m. KZSU will
broadcast the three games
and The Daily will liveblog
tonight's matchup starting
an hour before the game.

Five-game winning streaks
don't happen on their own in
baseball, even against inferior op
position. So as the No. 16 Cardi
nal takes that momentum into a
measuring-stick home series with
No. 23 Texas this weekend, Stan
ford will look to remain potent at
the plate against a Longhorn
team making its first road trip of
the season.
The Cardinal (6-2) launched
five homers in its last four wins
it had none in the first four games
of 2013 and has scored seven
runs in three consecutive games,
while Texas (6-2) is coming off a 5-
3 midweek loss against Sam
Houston State.
Stanford hasn't lost a noncon
ference series at Sunken Dia
mond since 2009, when the Long
horns won two of three during
when else the third weekend
of the season. But if the Cardinal
keeps its hitting up, Texas will be
hard-pressed to pull that off
again.

23 Texas this weekend in a three
game homestand. The Cardinal is rid
ing a five-game winning streak and
will look to keep that momentum alive
against the Longhoms, who were the
last squad to win a nonconference se
ries at Sunken Diamond.


MEHMET INONU/The Stanford Daily
Junior Lonnie Kauppila (above) takes a three-game
hitting streak into the weekend series against No. 23
Texas. The Cardinal is riding a five-game winning streak.

Consistent production
from the heart of the order
has sparked Stanford's cur
rent tear. The Cardinal's 2-5
hitters, juniors Danny
Diekroeger and Brian Ragi
ra, senior Justin Ringo and
sophomore Austin Slater, are
all hitting above .320 and
have combined for 18 of the
team's 31 total RBI.
But that success by regu
lar contributors has proven
contagious. After a slow
start to the season, highly
touted freshman center field
er Johnny Locher finally
notched the first three hits of
his Stanford career in Tues
day's 7-2 win at Saint Mary's.
Junior shortstop Lonnie
Kauppila is riding a three
game hitting streak after go
ing hitless in the team's first
five games and some depth
has emerged at the catcher
position, where weekend
starter Wayne Taylor and
midweek replacement Brant
Whiting have combined for
five hits in the Cardinal's last
two contests.
"I think all of our ap
proaches are better at the
plate," Whiting said after his
three-hit, two-RBI perform
ance on Tuesday. "We're get
ting better pitches to hit, see
ing the ball better. I know
early on, we were kind of
swinging out of the strike
zone."
Head coach Mark Mar
quess is still exercising his
options at the left fielder po
sition, where Stanford
starters have accounted for

just two hits in eight games.
That's a significant drop-off
from recent seasons, when
sluggers such as Tyler
Gaffney and Stephen Piscot
ty w ho signed with the Pi
rates and Cardinals respec
tively after their junior years
last June patrolled the
leftfield grass.
The Cardinal's pitching,
on the other hand, hasn't
dropped off one bit this sea
son. Stanford has posted a
1.76 team ERA since its
opening-weekend series loss
to Rice.
"It's huge [for the of
fense] ...just knowing that
even if we can't get the job
done in that inning, our
pitchers are going to give us
another chance the next in
ning," Whiting said.
"They're doing a great job.
We love them for it."
Senior ace Mark Appel
dominated the Longhorns at
Sunken Diamond in 2012,
taking a no-hitter into the
fifth and eventually striking
out 10 Texas batters in Stan
ford's 7-2 win. Then-fresh
man John Hochstatter was
also impressive in that se
ries, scattering five hits over
6.1 innings in a 15-1 Cardinal
triumph. With both hurlers
