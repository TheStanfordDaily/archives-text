# Joe Flacco is the new Phil Simms
## 
### Vignesh Venkataraman 
Joe Flacco, take a bow You've
made a fool of us all. First, it
was Eli Manning claiming
that you can't spell 'elite'
without Eli. We all cracked
up in the off-season. There was a
pretty strict hierarchy of quarter
backing, and Eli sure as heck wasn't
anywhere near the top of that list.
And then a funny thing happened.
He won a Super Bowl, and suddenly
Eli's prodigious gifts started to come
together. Yeah, there was the occa
sional stinker in the regular season
where he'd throw a hundred incom
pletions and almost as many intercep
tions while the Giants got blown out
of the stadium. But in the playoffs?
Holy (expletive) the man became de
monic. Just ask Patriots/Niners/
Packers fans across the nation. All of
us have suffered at this man's hands.
This off-season, Joe Flacco made
a similarly preposterous claim: "I
think I'm the best quarterback in the
NFL," or something along those
lines.
Ludicrous, exclaimed the me
dia! Matt Ryan's definitely better.
Flacco just has a good team
around him. He hasn't really
done anything.
For a while, it certainly looked
like the media had a point. The
Ravens puttered and spluttered
their way to a halfway decent regu
lar-season record while Flacco
floundered. Then the Ravens fired
cagey Cam Cameron, promoted the
robotic Jim Caldwell to offensive
coordinator, rattled off a series of
absurd wins and suddenly found
themselves in the Super Bowl, by
which point Flacco was in full
blown Eff-You mode. Let me list the
absurdities that allowed the
Ravens to sniff the Super Bowl:
1. A Ray Rice catch-and-run on 4th
and 29 against the Chargers to
keep the Ravens in playoff con
tention.
2. Hideously blown coverage by the
Broncos to let Jacoby Jones get
behind their ENTIRE defense in
a playoff game at home, when
everyone and their mom knew
that Flacco had to throw deep.
3. Injuries, idiocy and another re
cent Patriots playoff debacle at
home.
I would estimate the probability
of these three events happening in
conjunction with all the incredible
luck the Ravens had with recovered
fumbles and fortuitous bounces as
approximately 0 percent. That's
how absurd this string of luck was.
Then the Super Bowl happened,
as we all know, and somehow Flac
co emerged on top, having thrown a
monstrous 11 touchdowns with zero
interceptions throughout the play
offs. At that point, when Flacco lift
ed the Lombardi Trophy and col
lected the MVP award, I pretty
much knew that the Ravens would
have to send him a signed blank
check.
I'm not saying that Flacco didn't
earn himself a fat new contract. He
put forth his best at a time when
many other players faded from the
moment, and that is a skill worth
having. The part of this whole affair
that makes me a little queasy is
this: Flacco is now the most expen
sive player in league history. Think
about that for a second. Even ad
justed for inflation, his contract is
the richest on record, more so than
any contract ever signed by Tom
Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew
Brees, Calvin Johnson, Adrian Pe
terson... that's hallowed company
to just jump over.
Quite frankly, I think Joe Flacco
is the evolutionary Phil Simms. My
dad always used to wax poetic
about how so-very average- Simms
was throughout his career, with one
exceptional game: the only Super
Bowl he ever played, where he dis
sected a Denver defense to the tune
of 22 completions on 25 attempts,
winning an MVP award in the
process.
Flacco? Belittled by even his
own fans, bestowed the immortal
nickname "Flaccid Flacco" by an
enterprising reader of Bill Sim
mons, his career arc is eerily simi
lar, with one exception: Simms nev
er received the biggest contract in
NFL history.
Playing the armchair-GM card
here, if I'm Ozzie Newsome of the
Baltimore Ravens, do I feel com
fortable paying $6O million in guar
anteed money to a streaky quarter
back who is hit or miss in the regu
lar season, while the rest of my ros
ter ages and retires? I sure as heck
wouldn't.
The fact is that Flacco assured
himself however much mon
ey he wanted by winning the
Super Bowl. The Ravens
were unfortunately stuck
between a rock and a hard
place: If the Ravens let him
go, they would get crucified
by their fans. But if they
wanted to keep him, they'd
have to shell out the dough
in a big way. Either way,
they're kind of screwed.
So congratulations Joe
Flacco. You've eliminated
your unibrow, silenced your
doubters and earned the
richest contract in NFL his
tory in just one season. Im
pressive, to say the least. All
that's left is for you to find a
supermodel girlfriend...
Wait, he's married to his
high school sweetheart?
Crap, she's gorgeous too.
But personally, I believe
Flaccid Flacco will never

reach another Super Bowl,
let alone win one. With his
contract weighing over their
heads, the Ravens will never
again be able to construct a
roster as balanced and as
loaded as the one that just
eked out a championship.
Most importantly, I sense
a trend of success in the
NFL: it's not always the
best team that wins the Su
per Bowl; it's the one with
the most momentum. The
Ravens, Giants, Packers,
Saints and Steelers, respon
sible for the past six titles,
have all triumphed over her
alded "superior" teams
based on momentum and
luck. That right there is
something to bank on, even
if Joe Flacco's monstrous
contract is not. Voluptuous.

Eli's prodigious gifts started to come
together. Yeah, there was the occa
sional stinker in the regular season
where he'd throw a hundred incom
pletions and almost as many intercep
tions while the Giants got blown out
of the stadium. But in the playoffs?
Holy (expletive) the man became de
monic. Just ask Patriots/Niners/
Packers fans across the nation. All of
us have suffered at this man's hands.
This off-season, Joe Flacco made
a similarly preposterous claim: "I
think I'm the best quarterback in the
NFL," or something along those
lines.
Ludicrous, exclaimed the me
dia! Matt Ryan's definitely better.
Flacco just has a good team
around him. He hasn't really
done anything.
For a while, it certainly looked
like the media had a point. The
Ravens puttered and spluttered
their way to a halfway decent regu
lar-season record while Flacco
floundered. Then the Ravens fired
cagey Cam Cameron, promoted the
robotic Jim Caldwell to offensive
coordinator, rattled off a series of
absurd wins and suddenly found
themselves in the Super Bowl, by
which point Flacco was in full
blown Eff-You mode. Let me list the
absurdities that allowed the
Ravens to sniff the Super Bowl:
1. A Ray Rice catch-and-run on 4th
and 29 against the Chargers to
keep the Ravens in playoff con
tention.
2. Hideously blown coverage by the
Broncos to let Jacoby Jones get
behind their ENTIRE defense in
a playoff game at home, when
everyone and their mom knew
that Flacco had to throw deep.
3. Injuries, idiocy and another re
cent Patriots playoff debacle at
home.
I would estimate the probability
of these three events happening in
conjunction with all the incredible
luck the Ravens had with recovered
fumbles and fortuitous bounces as
approximately 0 percent. That's
how absurd this string of luck was.
Then the Super Bowl happened,
as we all know, and somehow Flac
co emerged on top, having thrown a
monstrous 11 touchdowns with zero
interceptions throughout the play
offs. At that point, when Flacco lift
ed the Lombardi Trophy and col
lected the MVP award, I pretty
much knew that the Ravens would
have to send him a signed blank
check.
I'm not saying that Flacco didn't
earn himself a fat new contract. He
put forth his best at a time when
many other players faded from the
moment, and that is a skill worth
having. The part of this whole affair
that makes me a little queasy is
this: Flacco is now the most expen
sive player in league history. Think
about that for a second. Even ad
justed for inflation, his contract is
the richest on record, more so than
any contract ever signed by Tom
Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew
Brees, Calvin Johnson, Adrian Pe
terson... that's hallowed company
to just jump over.
Quite frankly, I think Joe Flacco
is the evolutionary Phil Simms. My
dad always used to wax poetic
about how so-very average- Simms
was throughout his career, with one
exceptional game: the only Super
Bowl he ever played, where he dis
sected a Denver defense to the tune
of 22 completions on 25 attempts,
winning an MVP award in the
process.
Flacco? Belittled by even his
own fans, bestowed the immortal
nickname "Flaccid Flacco" by an
enterprising reader of Bill Sim
mons, his career arc is eerily simi
lar, with one exception: Simms nev
er received the biggest contract in
NFL history.
Playing the armchair-GM card
here, if I'm Ozzie Newsome of the
Baltimore Ravens, do I feel com
fortable paying $6O million in guar
anteed money to a streaky quarter
back who is hit or miss in the regu
lar season, while the rest of my ros
ter ages and retires? I sure as heck
wouldn't.
The fact is that Flacco assured
himself however much mon
ey he wanted by winning the
Super Bowl. The Ravens
were unfortunately stuck
between a rock and a hard
place: If the Ravens let him
go, they would get crucified
by their fans. But if they
wanted to keep him, they'd
have to shell out the dough
in a big way. Either way,
they're kind of screwed.
So congratulations Joe
Flacco. You've eliminated
your unibrow, silenced your
doubters and earned the
richest contract in NFL his
tory in just one season. Im
pressive, to say the least. All
that's left is for you to find a
supermodel girlfriend...
Wait, he's married to his
high school sweetheart?
Crap, she's gorgeous too.
But personally, I believe
Flaccid Flacco will never

reach another Super Bowl,
let alone win one. With his
contract weighing over their
heads, the Ravens will never
again be able to construct a
roster as balanced and as
loaded as the one that just
eked out a championship.
Most importantly, I sense
a trend of success in the
NFL: it's not always the
best team that wins the Su
per Bowl; it's the one with
the most momentum. The
Ravens, Giants, Packers,
Saints and Steelers, respon
sible for the past six titles,
have all triumphed over her
alded "superior" teams
based on momentum and
luck. That right there is
something to bank on, even
if Joe Flacco's monstrous
contract is not. Voluptuous.

Joe Flacco, take a bow You've
made a fool of us all. First, it
was Eli Manning claiming
that you can't spell 'elite'
without Eli. We all cracked
up in the off-season. There was a
pretty strict hierarchy of quarter
backing, and Eli sure as heck wasn't
anywhere near the top of that list.
And then a funny thing happened.
He won a Super Bowl, and suddenly
Eli's prodigious gifts started to come
together. Yeah, there was the occa
sional stinker in the regular season
where he'd throw a hundred incom
pletions and almost as many intercep
tions while the Giants got blown out
