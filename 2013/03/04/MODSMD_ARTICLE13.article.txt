# PAC-12 CHAMPS
## STANFORD SLIPS PAST USC, CAL 
### GEORGE CHEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Defending national champion Cal might have
narrowly beat Stanford during the regular dual
meet season, but it was the No. 4 Cardinal that
came out on top at the 2013 Women's Swimming
and Diving Pac-12 Championships, a four-day af
fair that began on Wednesday.
Stanford held a mere eight-point lead over
USC a lead at which the Trojans had been
slowly chipping away entering the last day of
competition on Saturday. But a strong second
place finish by junior Maya Dißado in the 200-
yard backstroke and a third-place effort by the
400-yard free relay team consisting of Dißado,
sophomore Maddy Schaefer, junior Felicia Lee
and senior Andi Murez provided large enough of
a cushion for the Cardinal.
Dißado, the defending Pac-12 champion and
NCAA runner-up in the 200 yard-backstroke,
could not keep pace with Cal's freshman sensa
tion Elizabeth Pelton, whose time of 1:48.39 was
only five hundredths of a second off the NCAA
record. However, the junior already had one Pac
-12 title under her belt going into the race. That
gold medal was earned on Friday night, when she
touched out 2012 Olympic bronze medalist
Caitlin Leverenze by one hundredth of a second,
the smallest margin possible.
The Trojans wound up in second, 21 points be
hind Stanford's 1,439.5 winning total. Meanwhile,
the Golden Bears finished a distant third with
1,333.5 points to show for.
Mirroring the women's success, the men's
team got off to an auspicious start at its own Pac
-12 Championships. After sweeping the 1-meter
and 3-meter springboard events, sophomore div
er Rristian Ipsen took second in the platform
event on Saturday.
Ipsen beat out Arizona State's Harrison Jones

by five points in the 1-meter event. A day later,
the Olympic synchronized diving bronze medalist
won the 3-meter more comfortably as his score
of 442.15 bested that of Arizona State's Rafael
Quintero by almost 40 points.
The swimming portion of the men's Pac-12
Championships kicked off on Sunday night, with
Stanford trying to win its 32nd consecutive con
ference title. The Cardinal took second in the
first event of the meet, the 200-yard medley re
lay, with the time of 1:24.48, just six hundredths
of a second behind gold-medal winner Cal. Soph
omore star David Nolan led off the relay with a
21.38 backstroke split, the fastest time of the

field, but Cal's Tom Shields swam a blistering
19.86 butterfly leg to give the Golden Bears a
lead that they would not relinquish.
Stanford then went on to finish third in the
800-yard freestyle relay, well behind USC and
Cal. With Day One over, the Cardinal is current
ly sitting in second with 70 points, trailing the
Bears' 74 points.
The men's swimmers will compete at the Pac
-12 Championships through Wednesday, while the
women's team will taper down for the NCAA
Championships, which begin March 21.
