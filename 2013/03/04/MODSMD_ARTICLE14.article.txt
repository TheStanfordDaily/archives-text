# SHARING THE TITLE
## 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team finished off an
other successful regular sea
son on Saturday, defeating
Washington State 72-50 and
winning its 13th-straight con
ference title. Cross-Bay rival
California defeated Washing
ton 73-60 on the same day to
ensure that the Card must
share the title this season.

The win for the No. 4 Car
dinal (28-2, 17-1 Pac-12) over
the Cougars (10-19, 6-12) also
means it will bring home its
22nd all-time conference title
and has clinched the No. 1
seed for next week's Pac-12
Tournament. The Card last
tied for the conference title at
the end of the 2004-05 season,
when it had to share the honor
with Arizona.
No. 6 Cal (26-2, 16-1) de
feated Washington (19-9,11-6)
to end that nine-year run and
make amends for an upset five
years ago, when California al
so entered the final day tied
with Stanford for the lead, and

when both schools faced the
same opponents in Seattle.
That day, the Cardinal also de
feated Washington State, but
the Golden Bears slipped up
against Washington to lose 74-
66 and hand sole possession of
the title to Stanford.
Starring for the Cardinal,
consensus National Player of
the Year candidate junior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike
grabbed her 24th double-dou
ble of the year (and 54th all
time) with 28 points and 13 re
bounds. She also broke anoth
er couple of records with this
performance, setting a career
high in points as well as taking
yet another honor away from
her sister Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike 'l2 by setting a new
school and conference single
season mark of 381 boards.
Elsewhere for Stanford,
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
added 13 points, senior for
ward Mikaela Ruef scored
seven and pulled down 10 re
bounds and junior guard Sara
James contributed nine points
and six rebounds.
In comparison, no single
Washington State player
made double figures in either
points or rebounds, though
scoring and rebounding duties
were much more evenly
shared among the Cougars.

Twelve of the 13 players that
saw action for the home team
added to the points total and
every single one grabbed at
least one rebound.
Leading the Cougars,
freshman sensation guard Lia
Galdeira could not live up to
her 14.9 season average in
points, hitting just eight, but
her seven rebounds did beat
her season mark of 5.2. WSU,
though, was undoubtedly hurt
by the absence of sophomore
guard Tia Presley, who tore
her right ACL against Oregon
at the end of January. Until
that season-ending injury,
Presley was scoring 13.3
points and grabbing 4.3 re
bounds per contest.
Washington State was also
hurt by poor shooting, hitting
just 28.6 percent from the
floor compared to Stanford's
42.9 percent, and was rushed
into poor choices on offense by
the conference's best defen
sive team. Overall, the Cardi
nal stole the ball seven times
and blocked six shots. The
Cougars also struggled to con
tain Ogwumike, doubling up
on her to no avail as she still
broke her points record.
The large lead Stanford
was ahead by 30 points at 63-
33 with just over 10 minutes
gone in the second half al
lowed Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer to rest key
players, including Ogwumike,
who sat out with 11:28 still re
maining in the game. That
might prove crucial now that
the regular season has ended.
The Pac-12 Tournament is just
five days away and with Stan
ford hoping to win the title it
will need to play —and win
games on three consecutive
days.
Stanford will now look
ahead to a return to Washing
ton this Friday when it will
start its tournament play after
receiving a bye through the
first round. The two NorCal
teams of Stanford and Califor
nia will be hot favorites to
square off in the final on Sun
day, a game that may have
much wider implications that
just deciding the Pac-12 Tour
nament. The Cardinal is cur
rently on the line between re
ceiving a No. 1 or No. 2 seed
into the NCAA Tournament
and Berkeley is hot on its
heels. No. 5 Duke's 69-65 loss
to Miami on Thursday is likely
to drop it below Stanford, but
any of one these teams could
arguably make the case for
one of the top-four seeds, if it
can win out.

STANFORD 72
WASHINGTON STATE 50
3/2, Pullman, Wash.


ZETONG LI/The Stanford Daily
Junior guard Sara James pitched in nine points and six
rebounds to help Stanford clobber the Cougars 72-50 on
Saturday. With the win, the Card shares the conference title
with Cal and is the No. 1 seed for the Pac- 12 Tournament.
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team finished off an
other successful regular sea
son on Saturday, defeating
Washington State 72-50 and
winning its 13th-straight con
ference title. Cross-Bay rival
California defeated Washing
ton 73-60 on the same day to
ensure that the Card must
share the title this season.

The win for the No. 4 Car
dinal (28-2, 17-1 Pac-12) over
the Cougars (10-19, 6-12) also
means it will bring home its
22nd all-time conference title
and has clinched the No. 1
seed for next week's Pac-12
Tournament. The Card last
tied for the conference title at
the end of the 2004-05 season,
when it had to share the honor
with Arizona.
No. 6 Cal (26-2, 16-1) de
feated Washington (19-9,11-6)
to end that nine-year run and
make amends for an upset five
years ago, when California al
so entered the final day tied
with Stanford for the lead, and

when both schools faced the
same opponents in Seattle.
That day, the Cardinal also de
feated Washington State, but
the Golden Bears slipped up
against Washington to lose 74-
66 and hand sole possession of
the title to Stanford.
Starring for the Cardinal,
consensus National Player of
the Year candidate junior for
ward Chiney Ogwumike
grabbed her 24th double-dou
ble of the year (and 54th all
time) with 28 points and 13 re
bounds. She also broke anoth
er couple of records with this
performance, setting a career
high in points as well as taking
yet another honor away from
her sister Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike 'l2 by setting a new
school and conference single
season mark of 381 boards.
Elsewhere for Stanford,
senior forward Joslyn Tinkle
added 13 points, senior for
ward Mikaela Ruef scored
seven and pulled down 10 re
bounds and junior guard Sara
James contributed nine points
and six rebounds.
In comparison, no single
Washington State player
made double figures in either
points or rebounds, though
scoring and rebounding duties
were much more evenly
shared among the Cougars.

Twelve of the 13 players that
saw action for the home team
added to the points total and
every single one grabbed at
least one rebound.
Leading the Cougars,
freshman sensation guard Lia
Galdeira could not live up to
her 14.9 season average in
points, hitting just eight, but
her seven rebounds did beat
her season mark of 5.2. WSU,
though, was undoubtedly hurt
by the absence of sophomore
guard Tia Presley, who tore
her right ACL against Oregon
at the end of January. Until
that season-ending injury,
Presley was scoring 13.3
points and grabbing 4.3 re
bounds per contest.
Washington State was also
hurt by poor shooting, hitting
just 28.6 percent from the
floor compared to Stanford's
42.9 percent, and was rushed
into poor choices on offense by
the conference's best defen
sive team. Overall, the Cardi
nal stole the ball seven times
and blocked six shots. The
Cougars also struggled to con
tain Ogwumike, doubling up
on her to no avail as she still
broke her points record.
The large lead Stanford
was ahead by 30 points at 63-
33 with just over 10 minutes
gone in the second half al
lowed Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer to rest key
players, including Ogwumike,
who sat out with 11:28 still re
maining in the game. That
might prove crucial now that
the regular season has ended.
The Pac-12 Tournament is just
five days away and with Stan
ford hoping to win the title it
will need to play —and win
games on three consecutive
days.
Stanford will now look
ahead to a return to Washing
ton this Friday when it will
start its tournament play after
receiving a bye through the
first round. The two NorCal
teams of Stanford and Califor
nia will be hot favorites to
square off in the final on Sun
day, a game that may have
much wider implications that
just deciding the Pac-12 Tour
nament. The Cardinal is cur
rently on the line between re
ceiving a No. 1 or No. 2 seed
into the NCAA Tournament
and Berkeley is hot on its
heels. No. 5 Duke's 69-65 loss
to Miami on Thursday is likely
to drop it below Stanford, but
