# Peat, Sanders shine in first open practice
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The defense "won the day," but the offense,
led by a touchdown run from sophomore running
back Barry Sanders, had its moments as Stan
ford football held its first open practice of the
spring season Saturday.
Without senior free safety Ed Reynolds, who
missed practice with a tweaked muscle head
coach Shaw called the move "precautionary" and
said if Saturday was a game day, Reynolds would
have played the defense relied on pressure
from the front seven a familiar sight â€”to
stuff the offense.
"I thought [junior linebacker] James Vaugh
ters was awesome, phenomenal today," Shaw
said. "He was in the backfield every play, it
seemed like. [Senior linebacker] Blake Leuders:
just as good. Those two guys playing the SAM,
we've got a physical presence at our strong side
running game, which is phenomenal."
There was one lineman who showed that
Vaughters, while impressive, was not quite "un
blockable," as Shaw described him. Sopho
more left tackle Andrus Peat repeatedly
stopped everyone who came into his path, in
cluding Vaughters, without looking like he
even had to try.
On one play, Vaughters started outside, took a
punch from Peat, cut inside and just got gobbled
up by the massive left tackle. A little while later,
sophomore outside linebacker Noor Davis tried
his luck against Peat with a similar move and
ended up on the turf after a brutally powerful
punch from Peat.
"I thought he's had a really good week of
practice," Shaw said of Peat. "We always talk
about as coaches, when the light comes on, the
light may have come on. It's flickered a couple of
times but it's mostly on and for a guy with his
physical tools, the sky is the limit."
Though Peat's emergence on the outside is
not much of a surprise, Stanford is in the midst
of an unexpected twist in the center battle.

units while junior Kevin Rei

Shuler are out, has im
pressed Shaw at center and
may be in the competition.
"He's shocked me with
how well he's done in there,"
Shaw said. "If he gets in the
battle at center, I won't fight
it, because I think we've had
some guys at guard that have
showed they can play.
[Sophomore] Josh Garnett's
had a phenomenal spring so
far. If we want to take some
reps and put Kevin Danser at
center and put Josh Garnett
with the ones just to see how
that works, we'll see."
During the scrimmage
session, Shaw showed his
current starting lineup for

the first time this spring.
Sophomore Luke Kaumatule
played tight end with the first
team, and really impressed.
Kaumatule made some tough
catches in traffic and played
with a motor the entire ses
sion.
Sophomore Kodi Whit
field also cracked the first
team, playing alongside jun
ior Ty Montgomery as wide
receiver. Whitfield, who is
known for his "crisp" route
running, is looking to make a
big jump after getting some
playing time near the end of
2012.
"Last year's experience
definitely pays off," Whitfield
said. "Just learning under
those guys that I had in front
of me like Drew Terrell, Ja
mal [Rashad-Patterson], Ty
[Montgomery] as well, who is
also coming back. Learning
from those guys, picking up
what I could from them, has
helped me just have a fast
start this spring."

Shaw also mentioned that
another sophomore wide re
ceiver, Michael Rector, had a
great day of practice as well.
Rector's speed makes him
one of the toughest receivers
on the team to cover, accord
ing to junior cornerback
Wayne Lyons.
One jersey that didn't see
any action was the No. 12 uni
form that formerly belonged
to Andrew Luck 'l2.
"As I've told the guys, the
number's still hot," Shaw
said. "It's too hot to put on
anybody else. We've got to let
it cool off for a while."
Stanford is scheduled to
hold one more open practice
Saturday before taking a
three-week break from prac
tice for finals and spring
break. Saturday's practice is
scheduled to run from 12:30
to 2:30 p.m.
