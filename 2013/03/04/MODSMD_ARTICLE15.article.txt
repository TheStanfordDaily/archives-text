# Peat, Sanders shine in first open practice

### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
The defense "won the day," but the offense,
led by a touchdown run from sophomore running
back Barry Sanders, had its moments as Stan
ford football held its first open practice of the
spring season Saturday.
Without senior free safety Ed Reynolds, who
missed practice with a tweaked muscle head
coach Shaw called the move "precautionary" and
said if Saturday was a game day, Reynolds would
have played the defense relied on pressure
from the front seven a familiar sight â€”to
stuff the offense.
"I thought [junior linebacker] James Vaugh
ters was awesome, phenomenal today," Shaw
said. "He was in the backfield every play, it
seemed like. [Senior linebacker] Blake Leuders:
just as good. Those two guys playing the SAM,
we've got a physical presence at our strong side
running game, which is phenomenal."
There was one lineman who showed that
Vaughters, while impressive, was not quite "un
blockable," as Shaw described him. Sopho
more left tackle Andrus Peat repeatedly
stopped everyone who came into his path, in
cluding Vaughters, without looking like he
even had to try.
On one play, Vaughters started outside, took a
punch from Peat, cut inside and just got gobbled
up by the massive left tackle. A little while later,
sophomore outside linebacker Noor Davis tried
his luck against Peat with a similar move and
ended up on the turf after a brutally powerful
punch from Peat.
"I thought he's had a really good week of
practice," Shaw said of Peat. "We always talk
about as coaches, when the light comes on, the
light may have come on. It's flickered a couple of
times but it's mostly on and for a guy with his
physical tools, the sky is the limit."
Though Peat's emergence on the outside is
not much of a surprise, Stanford is in the midst
of an unexpected twist in the center battle.
