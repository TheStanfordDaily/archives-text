## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Suites Dining, Week Two 
### Miles Unterreiner 
In the last week, there has been
a colossal campus and alumni
response to Res Ed's proposed
takeover of Suites Dining. After
reading through the literally hun
dreds of emails and Facebook mes
sages I've received from Chi
Theta Chi residents, from the co
ops, from students living on the
Row, from old Suites alumni who re
member the way things used to be
we've begun to form a coalition.
A coalition of students who know
that Suites needs to be kept inde
pendent and its four loyal chefs re
hired. A coalition of students who
know ResEd needs long-term
structural reform, not a short-term
patch. And a coalition of students
ready to fundamentally change the
ways in which students and
ResEd/R&DE administrators com
municate on this campus.
We've split into two working
groups: a group focused on Suites
Dining for the short term, and a
group focused on campus-wide solu
tions for the long term. I'll start
with Suites.
This Tuesday, Suites managers
(and, for the first time ever, actual
Suites residents) will begin discus
sions with ResEd administrators
Aaron Buzay and Nate Boswell
about the future of Suites Dining.
We welcome the opportunity to talk,
and our group has some clear goals
with which we'll go into tomorrow's
discussions. Here they are:
1) Rehiring the current four chefs
Tony, Frank, Dennis, and Car
oline at their current compen
sation level.
2) Maintaining complete student
ownership and leadership of fi
nances, hiring and hashing s
including the preservation of a
permanent student CEO and
CFO.
3) Refusing to compromise the
quality and quantity of food pro
vided and continuing to serve 17
high-quality meals per week to
Suites residents.
4) Ending inefficient and costly
ResEd restrictions on the way
that Suites student managers can
spend their own money. Most no
tably, we'd like to see an end to
Res Ed's practice of earmarking
an excessively high percentage of
the Suites Dining budget for food
purchases only. Since Suites
chefs tend to utilize food effi
ciently and effectively, eveiy Suites
eating club currently has a huge
budget surplus currently a total
of about $35,000 sitting unused,
restricted for use on food Suites
doesn't need to purchase.
That unused surplus is money
wasted; at the end of the year,
ResEd will sweep those accounts
dry. That money could be used
much more efficiently for
higher chef pay, for club improve
ments, or simply as an end-of
year refund to Suites residents.
Let's free it up.
5) Reducing the high cost of hous
ing maintenance charged by
R&DE and administrative over
head charged by Res Ed. From
the 2011-2012 to 2012-2013 aca
demic year alone, Housing (a di
vision of R&DE) raised its por
tion of the Suites board bill by
$3OO per student per year. If, as
Boswell diplomatically suggested
in Res Ed's official response last
week, Suites residents are going
to have to "ask beloved chefs dif
ficult questions about their com
pensation packages," we feel it's
only fair that R&DE and ResEd
administrators start asking
themselves those same difficult
questions about them budgets.
We understand that the Univer
sity has interests in maintaining
oversight and ensuring that food
service operations are conducted
according to University policy. We
have several specific solutions that
we think would benefit both Suites
Dining and ResEd administrators.
1) Longer training periods for stu
dent managers, a clear and con
sistent training manual for stu
dent staff and contracts with
chefs and GCDS that last longer
than the current one-year term.
We understand that the high rate
of turnover in student leadership
has been a concern for ResEd,
and establishing firmer lines of
continuity from year to year
should allay those concerns.
2) More sustained and reliable over
sight from a strengthened Suites
Dining Board of Directors, com
posed of former managers,
CEOs, CFOs and students.
3) A clear delineation between the
tasks for which ResEd is respon
sible and those for which GCDS
is responsible in order to perma
nently clear up the confusion that
has plagued relations between
GCDS and ResEd for the past
several years.
We hope that, as discussions be
gin, these are goals we can work
with ResEd to help meet.

But our coalition also knows
that, without broader structural re
forms to the way ResEd and stu
dents interact on this campus, sav
ing Suites Dining will merely be a
surface-level fix to a deeper under
lying problem. That's where our
long-term campus-wide working
group comes in, and here are a few
of our goals.
1) Establish a central online reposi
tory of information for use by fu
ture students. One of the main
problems facing unhappy stu
dents has been a lack of institu
tional memory; students move on
and graduate, the new freshmen
never know Chi Theta Chi and
Suites and the old Toy on Eating
Clubs even used to be independ
ent, and each year brings with it
a gradual erosion of student free
dom. We want to build a site
where students can look back and
see that their current problem
whatever it may be is part of a
broader interlocking system of
past parallels and patterns.
2) Build an online performance re
view system for administrators
and student managers, similar to
Courserank in appearance and
function. We have student re
views for professors, TAs and
classes why not have one for
administrators, student Finan
cial Managers and student
Kitche Managers?
Much as Courserank helps ex
cellent professors stand out with
five-star rankings and approving
student comments, a new online
performance review system could
help top-notch administrators of
which Stanford is lucky to have
many stand out from the crowd,
while administrators who communi
cate poorly or attempt to fire long
standing chefs are held account
able. Ranking criteria, from one
though five stars: Clarity, Respon
siveness, and Transparency.
3) Establish a student advisory
panel within ResEd that has real
power and represents student in
terests as a permanent nexus point
between students and Res Ed.
We have more long-term goals in
the works, and I'll share them with
you in the weeks to come. Until then,
thanks for reading, and keep up the
fight!

a gradual erosion of student free
dom. We want to build a site
where students can look back and
see that their current problem
whatever it may be is part of a
broader interlocking system of
past parallels and patterns.
2) Build an online performance re
view system for administrators
and student managers, similar to
Courserank in appearance and
function. We have student re
views for professors, TAs and
classes why not have one for
administrators, student Finan
cial Managers and student
Kitche Managers?
Much as Courserank helps ex
cellent professors stand out with
five-star rankings and approving
student comments, a new online
performance review system could
help top-notch administrators of
which Stanford is lucky to have
many stand out from the crowd,
while administrators who communi
cate poorly or attempt to fire long
standing chefs are held account
able. Ranking criteria, from one
though five stars: Clarity, Respon
siveness, and Transparency.
3) Establish a student advisory
panel within ResEd that has real
power and represents student in
terests as a permanent nexus point
between students and Res Ed.
We have more long-term goals in
the works, and I'll share them with
you in the weeks to come. Until then,
thanks for reading, and keep up the
fight!

In the last week, there has been
a colossal campus and alumni
response to Res Ed's proposed
takeover of Suites Dining. After
reading through the literally hun
dreds of emails and Facebook mes
sages I've received from Chi
Theta Chi residents, from the co
ops, from students living on the
Row, from old Suites alumni who re
member the way things used to be
we've begun to form a coalition.
A coalition of students who know
that Suites needs to be kept inde
pendent and its four loyal chefs re
hired. A coalition of students who
know ResEd needs long-term
structural reform, not a short-term
patch. And a coalition of students
ready to fundamentally change the
ways in which students and
ResEd/R&DE administrators com
municate on this campus.
We've split into two working
groups: a group focused on Suites
Dining for the short term, and a
group focused on campus-wide solu
tions for the long term. I'll start
with Suites.
This Tuesday, Suites managers
(and, for the first time ever, actual
Suites residents) will begin discus
sions with ResEd administrators
Aaron Buzay and Nate Boswell
about the future of Suites Dining.
We welcome the opportunity to talk,
and our group has some clear goals
with which we'll go into tomorrow's
discussions. Here they are:
1) Rehiring the current four chefs
Tony, Frank, Dennis, and Car
oline at their current compen
sation level.
2) Maintaining complete student
ownership and leadership of fi
nances, hiring and hashing s
including the preservation of a
permanent student CEO and
CFO.
3) Refusing to compromise the
quality and quantity of food pro
vided and continuing to serve 17
high-quality meals per week to
Suites residents.
4) Ending inefficient and costly
ResEd restrictions on the way
that Suites student managers can
spend their own money. Most no
tably, we'd like to see an end to
Res Ed's practice of earmarking
an excessively high percentage of
the Suites Dining budget for food
purchases only. Since Suites
chefs tend to utilize food effi
ciently and effectively, eveiy Suites
eating club currently has a huge
budget surplus currently a total
of about $35,000 sitting unused,
restricted for use on food Suites
doesn't need to purchase.
That unused surplus is money
wasted; at the end of the year,
ResEd will sweep those accounts
dry. That money could be used
much more efficiently for
higher chef pay, for club improve
ments, or simply as an end-of
year refund to Suites residents.
Let's free it up.
5) Reducing the high cost of hous
ing maintenance charged by
R&DE and administrative over
head charged by Res Ed. From
the 2011-2012 to 2012-2013 aca
demic year alone, Housing (a di
vision of R&DE) raised its por
tion of the Suites board bill by
$3OO per student per year. If, as
Boswell diplomatically suggested
in Res Ed's official response last
week, Suites residents are going
to have to "ask beloved chefs dif
ficult questions about their com
pensation packages," we feel it's
only fair that R&DE and ResEd
administrators start asking
themselves those same difficult
questions about them budgets.
We understand that the Univer
sity has interests in maintaining
oversight and ensuring that food
service operations are conducted
according to University policy. We
have several specific solutions that
we think would benefit both Suites
Dining and ResEd administrators.
1) Longer training periods for stu
dent managers, a clear and con
sistent training manual for stu
dent staff and contracts with
chefs and GCDS that last longer
than the current one-year term.
We understand that the high rate
of turnover in student leadership
has been a concern for ResEd,
and establishing firmer lines of
continuity from year to year
should allay those concerns.
2) More sustained and reliable over
sight from a strengthened Suites
Dining Board of Directors, com
posed of former managers,
CEOs, CFOs and students.
3) A clear delineation between the
tasks for which ResEd is respon
sible and those for which GCDS
is responsible in order to perma
nently clear up the confusion that
has plagued relations between
GCDS and ResEd for the past
several years.
We hope that, as discussions be
gin, these are goals we can work
with ResEd to help meet.

But our coalition also knows
that, without broader structural re
forms to the way ResEd and stu
dents interact on this campus, sav
ing Suites Dining will merely be a
surface-level fix to a deeper under
lying problem. That's where our
long-term campus-wide working
group comes in, and here are a few
of our goals.
1) Establish a central online reposi
tory of information for use by fu
ture students. One of the main
problems facing unhappy stu
dents has been a lack of institu
tional memory; students move on
and graduate, the new freshmen
never know Chi Theta Chi and
Suites and the old Toy on Eating
Clubs even used to be independ
ent, and each year brings with it
a gradual erosion of student free
dom. We want to build a site
where students can look back and
see that their current problem
whatever it may be is part of a
broader interlocking system of
past parallels and patterns.
2) Build an online performance re
view system for administrators
and student managers, similar to
