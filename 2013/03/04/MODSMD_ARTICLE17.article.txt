# NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND
## Ethical Investment on Campus 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
Over the past few weeks, there
has been a discernible amount
of student frustration and out
rage as our university has demon
strated that its priority is functioning
as a for-profit institution at the ex
pense of workers and student opin
ions.

The most recent student outrage
over the administrative takeover of
Suites Dining does not stand in isola
tion, but rather comes in a long string
of events that are offensive to most
students' sense of decency.
In January, news broke that the
University had kicked popular food
truck NetAppetit off campus in favor
of streamlining food truck vendors
under an outside contractor.
Following a host of comments on
The Daily's site, as well as op-eds and
a petition, NetAppetit is back on cam
pus (with conditions).
Also in late January, ResEd an
nounced its intentions to lay off
Suites chefs (whose personalities and
food nearly every Suites resident has
been beyond-happy with myself
included) and to take Suites Dining
out of student management in favor
of a subcontracted service.
Thousands of students have
signed a petition to save Suites Din
ing, roughly 100 students attended a
solidarity rally in White Plaza last
week, and the campus is still planning
more responses.
And as the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition brought to our attention
last week, Stanford Hospitals and
Clinics and the School of Medicine
are finalizing labor changes that have

already laid off 13 workers, removed
the full-time and permanent job sta
tus of the remaining 25, and are mov
ing to replace these workers using
you guessed it another subcon
tractor.
Management in these facilities
was subcontracted out four years
ago, and workers have since reported
abusive conditions including work
speed-ups, excessive surveillance and
requirements to perform dangerous
and unsanitary work all of which
compromise the health of anyone en
tering these buildings.
Another petition is circulating, but
at this point we have to seriously and
critically address this university's
commitments to ethical relationships
with its workers and the people.
The Suites change comes out of
concerns of "health and safety," "fi
nancial mismanagement" and "lower
ing costs for students," according to
the University. But as Daily staffer
Miles Unterreiner showed us in a
brilliant series last week, these rea
sons shrivel under an ounce of inspec
tion to reveal the goal of cutting costs
for Stanford, in express opposition to
student sentiment.
The same shriveling happened
when examining NetAppetit, last
year's takeover of Chi Theta Chi and
the plight of the hospital workers.
The University clearly cares more
about cutting costs and the profit
seeking corporations it works with
than it cares about how those busi
nesses affect society and our commu
nity.
On Thesday, the Senate will con

sider (and probably vote on) two res
olutions which address unsavory
business practices that are injurious
to our campus and the larger worlds
around us: ethical labor contracts
with Suites Dining and the ethical in
vestment of the university endow
ment.
Although they remain separate
bills, both present an important chal
lenge for the University to recognize
the basic human rights of all people
and our right, as citizens of this coun
try, as students of this university, or
as senators of the student body, to de
mand that our university prioritize
human need over corporate greed.
And as the administration's pro
clivity for ignoring business and labor
abuses for the sake of making more
money has shown, Stanford will not
realign with its original values unless
we as a student body put pressure on
them to do so.
So just as we have to support Car
oline, Dennis, Frank and Tony, and
demand they keep then-jobs, and just
as we have to support the hospital
workers whose jobs and lives the
University dismisses with the flick of
a contract signature, and just as we
have to demand that the University
be fair to a food truck that has been
so devoted to this campus and its res
idents, we now must stand strong as
a student body and demand that the
University ring true to its values.
Anything less than this is a failure
on our parts.
