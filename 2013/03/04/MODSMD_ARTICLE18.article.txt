## Channeling Our Impatience for Good 
### TERRY WINOGRAD, PROF. EMERITUS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE CAROL WINOGRAD, MD, ASSOC. PROF. EMERITA OF MEDICINE National Executive Board of J Street 
This week, the undergraduate
Senate is set to wade into a de
bate about Israel that has cap
tured the national spotlight and al
ready drawn fierce reaction from
groups on campus.
Joining dozens of other organiza
tions across the country, on Tuesday
the Senate will consider whether or
not to encourage the University to di
vest from companies operating in Is
rael and the Palestinian territories.
The bill in question is inspired by the
"Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions"
(BDS) movement, which seeks to use
economic pressure to influence Israel
to end its occupation of lands intend
ed for a future Palestinian state.
We share BDS supporters' frus
tration over the current Israeli-
Palestinian stalemate and applaud
their commitment to act. There is no
doubt that the ongoing conflict de
mands urgent attention, but we do
not think that BDS will achieve the
desired ends.
After last year's war in Gaza
broke the illusion of calm, growing
unrest in the West Bank now reveals
that conditions are only getting
worse. Amid a deepening divide be
tween Israelis and Palestinians, en
croaching settlement expansion is
rapidly taking over Palestinian land
in the West Bank and East
Jerusalem. This settlement enter
prise threatens not only the future of
a Palestinian state, but also Israel's
future as a Jewish and democratic
homeland, and our own security in
terests here in the United States.
Meanwhile, Hamas, which rules
Gaza, refuses to accept Israel's right
to exist and continues to build its ar
senal designed to harm civilians.
Given the stagnation of diplomat
ic efforts, impatience is a good thing.
But where we agree on the urgency
of the conflict, we think that divest
ment is the wrong tool for several
reasons.
First of all, BDS is destined to

backfire. Although Israeli leaders
have the power to change course, at
tempts to alienate and economically
pressure Israeli settlers will likely
have the opposite effect: they will
convince all Israelis that the world is
turning against them, leading them
to become more entrenched in their
stances and more averse to compro
mise. Israelis need to feel secure, not
isolated, in order to make the conces
sions necessary for a peace agree
ment.
Second, the BDS movement can
not end the conflict. Unlike the two
state solution, which seeks to benefit
both sides, the BDS movement is
concerned only with assigning
blame, and it places it singularly up
on Israel.
We reject BDS's zero-sum ap
proach. We fear that, whereas the
vast majority of Americans desire a
two-state solution and should be unit
ing to make it a reality, the BDS
movement is sowing division, sap
ping resources, and turning away
many of us who would otherwise be
supportive of pro-peace efforts. Just
as BDS will only harden Israelis and
Palestinians against the possibility of
compromise, so will it also polarize
groups here on campus who could be
allies.
All of us at Stanford Chris
tians, Jews and Muslims, Republi
cans and Democrats have a
shared interest in ending this con
flict. If we are serious about it, we
need to put aside counterproductive
tactics and move past the designation
of blame that has plagued the conflict
from the beginning. We need to mar
shal our impatience and rally togeth
er for the two-state solution the
only way forward that allows both
sides to realize peace, security and
their respective national aspirations.
Polls have consistently shown
that despite the deteriorating situa
tion on the ground, support for two
states among Israelis and Palestini
ans remains strong. What has steadi
ly declined is their hope that peace
can still be accomplished. This dan
gerous hope deficit heightens our

own responsibility to act. We can
work together to restore faith in a
peaceful resolution by seeking out
thoughtful, constructive solutions to
break the stalemate.
For those of us who consider our
selves pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian or
both, a two-state solution offers the
only viable option. On Tuesday, we
hope that Stanford will reject the
BDS movement and declare strong
support for the two-state solution,
the only viable way to end this con
flict once and for all.
