# Investment, not Divestment, is the solution in Israel/Palestine
## 
### JUSTIN HEFTER '11 
Divestment arguments on
campus have been framed as
pro-Palestinian and anti-Is
rael, when in reality divestment is
anti-both; divestment advocates, re
gardless of intention, are pushing
for a policy that could make every
one worse off, not only on campus,
but in the Middle East as well.
Activists who call for divestment
from Israel usually start out with
the example of how the tactic of di
vestment helped overthrow a racist
and autocratic regime in South
Africa in the 1980s, under which
black South Africans were not al
lowed to vote and were not repre
sented in the government. Compa
nies that operated in South Africa
were complicit in supporting this
racist government, and the only
way to get it to change was to dam
age South Africa's bottom line by
divesting and boycotting.
The strategy worked, the divest
ment movement gained internation
al traction, and the regime was
overthrown and replaced by the
democratically elected African Na

tional Congress. Activists today ar
gue that divestment from compa
nies in Israel can help change the
policies with which they disagree.
However, the history and situa
tion in the Middle East is vastly dif
ferent from that of South Africa in
the 1980s. Israel is a liberal democ
racy with Arab and Muslim repre
sentation in both its parliament and
its Supreme Court. Just as in Amer
ica, some of Israel's policies are not
ideal. But using divestment, a tool
that has been used to promote
regime change, should not be the
way we express discontent with
the most stable, liberal, and demo
cratic country in the Middle East.
While Israel is a stable democra
cy that has lasting peace treaties
with Egypt and Jordan, this stabili
ty was not always a given. The rela
tive peace between Israel and its
neighbors in Egypt and Jordan is
largely due to American invest
ment. In the years between 1948
and 1973, the U.S. barely invested
in Israel. The average annual U.S.
government investment between
1948 and 1973 was four percent of
what it is today. In that time period,
Israel was consistently under at
tack from its militarily superior
neighbors. Between 1948 and 1973,
Israel fought three major defensive
wars against the heavily armed
Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi and Jordan
ian armies. Once the United
States began investing in the eco
nomic and physical security of all
parties, however, the level of con
flict de-escalated and Israel was
able to sign lasting peace treaties.
Today, investment in Israel and
Palestine has helped both parties
continue to shift the paradigm of
conflict away from the large-scale
military interventions of the past.
One of the key missions of "The
Quartet" (which includes the Unit
ed Nations, the European Union,
Russia and the U.S.) is to promote
private sector development in
Palestine by investing. The direct
