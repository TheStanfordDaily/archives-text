# Investment, not Divestment, is the solution in Israel/Palestine
## 
### JUSTIN HEFTER '11 
Divestment arguments on
campus have been framed as
pro-Palestinian and anti-Is
rael, when in reality divestment is
anti-both; divestment advocates, re
gardless of intention, are pushing
for a policy that could make every
one worse off, not only on campus,
but in the Middle East as well.
Activists who call for divestment
from Israel usually start out with
the example of how the tactic of di
vestment helped overthrow a racist
and autocratic regime in South
Africa in the 1980s, under which
black South Africans were not al
lowed to vote and were not repre
sented in the government. Compa
nies that operated in South Africa
were complicit in supporting this
racist government, and the only
way to get it to change was to dam
age South Africa's bottom line by
divesting and boycotting.
The strategy worked, the divest
ment movement gained internation
al traction, and the regime was
overthrown and replaced by the
democratically elected African Na

tional Congress. Activists today ar
gue that divestment from compa
nies in Israel can help change the
policies with which they disagree.
However, the history and situa
tion in the Middle East is vastly dif
ferent from that of South Africa in
the 1980s. Israel is a liberal democ
racy with Arab and Muslim repre
sentation in both its parliament and
its Supreme Court. Just as in Amer
ica, some of Israel's policies are not
ideal. But using divestment, a tool
that has been used to promote
regime change, should not be the
way we express discontent with
the most stable, liberal, and demo
cratic country in the Middle East.
While Israel is a stable democra
cy that has lasting peace treaties
with Egypt and Jordan, this stabili
ty was not always a given. The rela
tive peace between Israel and its
neighbors in Egypt and Jordan is
largely due to American invest
ment. In the years between 1948
and 1973, the U.S. barely invested
in Israel. The average annual U.S.
government investment between
1948 and 1973 was four percent of
what it is today. In that time period,
Israel was consistently under at
tack from its militarily superior
neighbors. Between 1948 and 1973,
Israel fought three major defensive
wars against the heavily armed
Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi and Jordan
ian armies. Once the United
States began investing in the eco
nomic and physical security of all
parties, however, the level of con
flict de-escalated and Israel was
able to sign lasting peace treaties.
Today, investment in Israel and
Palestine has helped both parties
continue to shift the paradigm of
conflict away from the large-scale
military interventions of the past.
One of the key missions of "The
Quartet" (which includes the Unit
ed Nations, the European Union,
Russia and the U.S.) is to promote
private sector development in
Palestine by investing. The direct
results of this investment
have led to a more robust
middle class in the West
Bank, and record lows in at
tempted terrorist attacks
against Israel. This invest
ment has helped lay out the
groundwork for an eventual
democratic Palestinian state.
Similarly, investment in
Israel's physical and eco
nomic security has helped
lead to a record low for Is
rael in terms of military re
sponse to terrorist provoca
tion. The Iron Dome missile
defense system, funded par
tially by U.S. investment,

successfully defended Israel
from a barrage of 1,500 rock
ets fired from Gaza during
the most recent conflict. In
prior conflicts, this rocket at
tack would have resulted in
an Israeli ground invasion.
The defensive capability of
Iron Dome, however, miti
gated the damage from
those rockets, preventing
the need for a ground inva
sion and saving thousands of
Israeli and Palestinian lives.
There are those who ar
gue that while we have made
some progress, the pace has
not been fast enough. I agree.
There are still human rights
concerns, and there are still
injustices committed by both
Palestinians and Israelis that
we need to correct.
But the progress that we

have made since the war of
1973, in which more than
20,000 were killed and 40,000
were wounded, to the most
recent conflict, in which few
er than 200 died, is entirely
due to investments in Pales
tinian society and security in
vestments like Israel's Iron
Dome and security barrier.
Just as divestment from
Palestinian economic security
could lead to increases in ter
rorism, divesting from the
companies that supply Israel
with the tools it needs to de
fend itself could be disas
trous. Even doing so in words
could damage the fragile sta
bility that is the Middle East
and send us on a path that too
dark to imagine.
