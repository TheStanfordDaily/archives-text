## Card drops Buckeyes 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
On a cold, blustery day in
Columbus, OMo, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team used a
hot start to defeat No. 13 Ohio
State 12-10.

3/2, Columbus, Ohio
The Cardinal (2-1) began
the game on a 4-0 run sparked
by redshirt junior Rachel Ozer,
who opened the scoring less
than two minutes after the
opening draw.
When Ohio State scored its
first goal nearly 14 minutes in,
Ozer answered with two more
goals to extend the Cardinal's
lead to 6-1. The attacker netted
a team-high four goals against
the Buckeyes and currently
leads the Cardinal with eight
goals and five assists on the
season.
"[Ozer] had a nose for the
net today," Stanford head coach
Amy Bokker told
GoStanford.com. "She's an
awesome dodger, one of the
best in the country, and she had
a great moment and was a fin
isher today"
The final 10 minutes of the
first half saw a flurry of offense
from both teams. After the
Buckeyes scored twice to bring
the score to 6-3, Stanford fresh
man Adrienne Anderson and
sophomore Hannah Farr re
sponded with goals to stretch
the lead once again.
Ohio State added two more
quick goals, but the Cardinal
entered halftime with a 9-5 lead
after Farr set up Phaser for a
buzzer-beating goal to end the
period.
Phaser recorded a hat trick
for the second consecutive
game, while also adding an as
sist on Fair's first-half goal.
"[Phaser] was really poised
under the pressure Ohio State
put on her and made the most
of her opportunities," Bokker
said.
The Buckeyes opened the
second half with two straight
goals to cut the deficit to two.
Phaser broke the streak with
an unassisted tally at 20:15, but
Ohio State's Jessica Hassett
would respond just a minute
later to keep the game tight.
With about 15 minutes re
maining in the game, the Car
dinal took a 12-8 lead by pump
ing in two goals in 19 seconds.

After freshman midfielder
Mackenzie Tesei picked up a
rebound and put away an unas
sisted tally, Phaser won the en
suing draw control to set up a
goal by junior attacker Anna
Kim that was assisted by soph
omore Meredith Kalinowski.
Kalinowski also recorded a goal
in the first half.
The Buckeyes would add
two goals in the final 10 min
utes, but those would ultimate
ly prove inconsequential as the
Cardinal closed out the game
and sealed the 12-10 win.
Once again, junior Megan
Lerner made her presence
known defensively for the Car
dinal by picking up five ground
balls and controlling one draw
She leads the team with 13
draw controls and is tied for the
team-lead with nine ground
balls.
Stanford won 12 of 23 draw
controls and picked up 23
ground balls on the day. Ac
cording to Bokker, the Cardi
nal's defensive pressure played
a critical role in the team's win.
Stanford junior goalkeeper
Lyndsey Munoz made six of
her nine saves in the second
half, including several at key
moments, to cap off a strong
performance in net. She has
posted an 11.92 goals-against
average through Stanford's
first three games.
The Cardinal will look for
its third victory in a row and
second straight over a ranked
opponent—when it faces No.
11 Georgetown in a non-confer
ence matchup on March 5 at
home.
Georgetown hasn't lost this
season after defeating
Delaware, No. 16 Towson and
Princeton in its first three
games. The Hoyas have
outscored their opponents 40-
28 this season.
Georgetown returned 14 of
their- top 15 scorers from a year
ago, when the Hoyas' season
ended in the Big East semifi
nals. So far this season, 11 dif
ferent players have scored for
the Hoyas, led by sophomore
Caroline Thrzian, who has five
goals and five assists, and jun
ior Kelyn Freedman, who has
posted seven goals and one as
sist.
Georgetown senior mid
fielder Sophia Thomas was one
of 50 players including Stan
ford juniors Anna Kim and
Lyndsey Munoz— recently
named to the Tewaaraton

Award Watch List.
Junior Barb Black has
played every minute in net for
the Hoyas in 2013, recording
16 saves and a 9.33 goals
against average. Stanford's at
tack, which averages just over
13 goals a game, will try to ex
ploit an inexperienced
Georgetown defense and cre
ate shots against Black.
"We're playing another
great opponent so hopefully
[the win against Ohio State]
will give us some momentum
going into that match,"
Bokker said.

The game against the
Hoyas is slated for 4 p.m. start
time at Cagan Stadium on
Ihesday, March 5.
