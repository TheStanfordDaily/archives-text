# ALL HAIL HARRIS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ BRADFORD STAFF WRITER 
Stanford basketball's 2013
senior night turned into senior
guard Gabriel Harris's night.
The Birmingham, Ala. product
scored a career-high 14 points
to help Stanford (17-3,8-9 Pac
-12) defeat Utah (11-17, 3-13)
84-66 in what was his final
home game as a Cardinal play-

Harris was 6-of-7 from the
floor and had seven rebounds,
two steals and an assist in 23
minutes. His teammates
seemed eager to get him the
ball on offense, and the bench
as well as the crowd erupted
every time he added to his
scoring tally.
"Just seeing how my team
mates surrounded me today
and just kept pushing me to
keep going, keep attacking,
keep going, it just really gave
me a good feeling," said Harris.
Harris described his emo
tions as "bittersweet." He said
he felt blessed to be able to
play in his last game and
talked about how much he will
miss his teammates.
But, while this was the last
home game, Harris believes
Stanford could have a bunch
of games left before he hangs
up the jersey for good.

"I think our team is built to
go to tournaments because we
are so deep. But we definitely
noticed with Colorado [last
year], it's all about momen
tum," Harris said.
While Utah (11-7,3-13 Pae
-12) has struggled to win
games this year, its defense
had been a bright spot. The
Utes lead the Pac-12 in oppo
nent's shooting percentage,
limiting teams to 39 percent.
Stanford could not be held
down on this night though.
The Card shot 48 percent for
the game, which was bolstered
by a 7-of-14 mark from behind
the arc in the first half.
Sophomore guard Chasson
Randle led all Cardinal scor
ers with 22 points. His six as
sists also helped Stanford
record a season-high 20 as
sists.
"I thought we did a good
job as a team collectively. We
shared the basketball... of
course, making shots is always
a good thing," said head coach
Johnny Dawkins.
Junior forward Dwight
Powell chipped in 15 points
and eight assists and junior
forward John Gage scored 11
points while going 3-of-4 from
three-point range.
For most of the contest,
Stanford held a gaudy lead,
which hit double-digits with
eight minutes left in the first
half and was 13 at the halftime
break.
Utah looked like a team
tied for tenth in the Pac-12,
and Stanford seemed on its

way to a breezy blowout.
Then, just three-and-a-half
minutes into the second half,
Utah cut its deficit to four
points.
Stanford's first two posses
sions ended with turnovers,
and the next five with missed
shots. It wasn't until the 16:01
mark in the second half that a
Cardinal player made a field
goal.
There were flashbacks to
Wednesday's loss to Colorado,
in which a large Stanford lead
disappeared quickly in the
second half.

Apparently Stanford
learned from that experience,

as it quickly racked up the
points and defensive stops
against Utah to blow the game
open again.
"It was very important for
us," said Dawkins. "The mind
set of coming off a game
where you had a lead and you
let it get away, now you have
an opportunity to withstand
that run."
The lead was back to dou
ble-digits by the 13:00 mark,
and it steadily increased to 22
points before the closing min
utes.
With 2:09 to go, Harris

er.
