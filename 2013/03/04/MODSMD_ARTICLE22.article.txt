# Nail-biter on Senior Night
## 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday night marked the final
home meet for seniors Ashley Morgan
and Nicole Dayton. So, on a night dedi
cated to honoring the two, the No. 12
Stanford women's gymnastics team
hoped to come away with a win against
No. 9 Oregon State and California. The
Cardinal managed to do just that, but
not without some suspense down to the
very end.

As they have done throughout the
year and throughout their careers, Mor
gan and Dayton came up big when it
mattered most to give Stanford the vic
tory with a score of 197.200, just in front
of Oregon State (197.175) and well ahead
of California (195.000).
Trying to get an early lead in the
meet, Stanford came out with a quick
start, putting up a season-best 49.425 on
vault. Sophomore Pauline Hanset led the
way for the Card, earning a career-best
9.925, finishing tied for second overall
with Oregon State's Hailey Gaspar.
Sophomore Rristina Vaculik set a ca
reer-best for herself as well, finishing
with a score of 9.900. Stanford had five
competitors score at least a 9.850. While
Stanford did it all it could to get out to a
fast start, Oregon State did just as
much, as the Beavers matched Stan
ford's score with a 49.425 of then* own.
California would score a 49.200 in the
event, giving the Bears a deficit they
would be unable to make up over the
next three events.
The Cardinal was nearly as impres
sive on uneven bars, posting a score of
49.400. Stanford was led by Ashley Mor
gan, who scored a 9.925 to finish second
overall in the event. Vaculik posted her

second 9.900 of the meet to finish fourth
overall once again.
However, perhaps the most crucial
moment of the event was the return of
sophomore Rebecca Wing, who hadn't
performed all season due to an injury
over the summer. Wing showed no signs
of rust, tying her career-best with a
score of 9.900 to match Vaculik.
"It felt so good to be competing
again," Wing said. "Even though it's al
most been a year, as soon as I stepped up
to compete it felt exactly the same."

Stanford's 49.400 was another sea
son-best score for the team, but would
need more if it wanted to compete with
Oregon State, who scored a 49.450 to
take a ,050-point lead heading into the
third round.
Unfortunately for the Card, it would
put together its worst performance of
the meet on beam, suffering two rare
mistakes to finish with a score of just
48.875. Beam has been Stanford's

Friday was an exciting meet for the Cardinal, showcasing seniors Ashley Morgan
and Nicole Dayton in their final home meet. Kristina Vaculik (above) had
an impressive performance as well, scoring a career-best of 9.900.
strongest event this year, as
it has outscored its opponent
in every meet, earning the
Card a fourth-place national
ranking. Despite the two
faults, Stanford's other com
petitors came up big, led by
sophomore Ivana Hong's
9.925, which earned her first
place overall in the event.
Juniors Amanda Spinner
and Shona Morgan would
add a pair of 9.900'5, but per
haps the biggest perform
ance came from Hanset in
the sixth and final spot.
"I was extremely nerv
ous, but I kept telling myself
to do exactly what I do in

practice everyday," Hanset
said.
Knowing that two of her
teammates had made mis
takes, Hanset understood
she would have to perform
well to keep her team in the
match. Her 9.800 in the event
made sure of that.
"It is the best feeling in
the world when your team is
counting on you and you rise
up to the challenge," Hanset
said.
However, the Card was
still trailing by 0.150 points
going into the fourth and fi
nal round, needing a nearly
flawless round on floor exer
cise to pull out the victory.
Lucky for Stanford, Ashley
Morgan and Dayton made
sure they would do all they
could to win their final home
meet.

Morgan led the way for
the Cardinal with a 9.925,
while Dayton hit a career
best 9.875 to start off the
round. Five of the six per
formers scored at least a
9.875, good for a team score
of 49.500. Oregon State had a
strong round as well, but its
49.325 would give Stanford
the final margin of victory of
just 0.025 points.

Stanford's victory
snapped a four-meet losing
streak against Oregon State,
while it improved to 38-1
against Cal since 1996. The
Cardinal next competes on
Saturday, when it travels to
Oklahoma to take on Oklaho
ma and North Carolina in a
tri-meet.
