## Bret Baumbach wins individual Pac-12 crown 
### â€” Miles Bennett-Smith 
Redshirt junior wrestler Bret Baumbach
won the individual Pac-12 title at 165 pounds
with a dominating 7-1 decision over No. 1
seed Seth Thomas on Sunday, simultaneously
earning a coveted automatic berth in the
NCAA Championships.
Just the 15th conference-champion in
school history, Baumbach moved to 21-10 on
the season with a 4-1 victory over Oregon
State's Holden Packard in the tournament
semifinals, held at the Wells Fargo Arena in
Tempe, Ariz.
That set up a matchup with Thomas in the
finals just a few hours later, and Baumbach
took full advantage, working Thomas over for
the full seven minutes and never truly being

threatened.
The win means that Baumbach, a native of
Council Bluffs, Iowa, will return to his home
state for the NCAA Championships, which
will be held in Des Moines, Iowa, March 21-23.
