## Financial aid rises to meet tuition hike 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's financial aid budget will increase commen
surate to a 3.5-percent rise in the cost of undergraduate
tuition for the 2013-14 academic year, according to Direc
tor of Financial Aid Karen Cooper. The budget for need
based financial aid to undergrads is $l3O million for the
2012-2013 academic year.
Undergraduate tuition will increase to $42,690 next
year, compared to $41,250 this year, and room-and-board
charges will increase from $12,721 to $13,166, according
to a University press release. The Campus Health Serv
ice Fee will increase to from $179 to $lB5 per quarter
next year. Undergraduate charges will total $56,411 next
year, compared to $54,506 this year.
"There is no official reason for why tuition has in

creased," Cooper said. "Tbition is the university's source
of unrestricted dollars, which is money that can be spent
in any way. Most of our salaries come from unrestricted
money. Tbition makes up about half of that general funds
amount... The general funds do a lot basic work around
campus that are not covered by endowment funds."
Cooper downplayed the significance of the projected
rise in tuition, noting that tuition costs have risen by sim
ilar amounts for each of the past five years.
"It's been a while since it's been higher than that,"
Cooper said. "Increases have been in that range for quite
some time."
Even with rising tuition costs, however, Cooper em
phasized Stanford's commitment to meeting students'
full needs in terms of financial assistance.
"That is how I get involved
in this discussion," she said.
"By how much do we need to
increase the financial aid
budget [in order to continue
to meet that commitment]?"
As part of that commit
ment, households with in
comes of $lOO,OOO or less are
not expected to pay any tu
ition. Households with in
comes below $60,000 do not
pay for tuition, nor room-and
board. In all, 50 percent of un
dergraduates receive finan
cial aid from Stanford, total
ing more than 3,400 students
this year.
"People are comforted by
the fact that this policy is go
ing to make Stanford afford
able regardless of what the
price is," Cooper said. "In a
way, everybody gets some
benefit from the endowment
because the full cost of a Stan
ford education is higher than
the amount of tuition."

Even with the Universi
ty's financial aid program,
however, students remain re
sponsible for an estimated
$5,000 each year in books,
travel and personal expenses,
according to Cooper. That sum
is typically covered by sum
mer earnings and part-time
jobs during the school year.
"We do our best to esti
mate student need, and tu
ition is part of that estimate,"
Cooper noted. "We look at the
federal and state aid that is
available, and whatever is not
covered by those resources,
we look to our funds. As tu
ition increases, financial aid
goes up as well."
"It's hard to tell where
we're headed [with tuition in
creases]," she added. "In
creases have been going on
since the late 70s, when tu
ition started increasing rapid
ly... $60,000 a year, adding in
everything else that we look
at, is a really significant num
ber. It's a lot of money for any
body these days."
