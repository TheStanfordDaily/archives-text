## Financial aid rises to meet tuition hike 
### JOSEE SMITH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's financial aid budget will increase commen
surate to a 3.5-percent rise in the cost of undergraduate
tuition for the 2013-14 academic year, according to Direc
tor of Financial Aid Karen Cooper. The budget for need
based financial aid to undergrads is $l3O million for the
2012-2013 academic year.
Undergraduate tuition will increase to $42,690 next
year, compared to $41,250 this year, and room-and-board
charges will increase from $12,721 to $13,166, according
to a University press release. The Campus Health Serv
ice Fee will increase to from $179 to $lB5 per quarter
next year. Undergraduate charges will total $56,411 next
year, compared to $54,506 this year.
"There is no official reason for why tuition has in

creased," Cooper said. "Tbition is the university's source
of unrestricted dollars, which is money that can be spent
in any way. Most of our salaries come from unrestricted
money. Tbition makes up about half of that general funds
amount... The general funds do a lot basic work around
campus that are not covered by endowment funds."
Cooper downplayed the significance of the projected
rise in tuition, noting that tuition costs have risen by sim
ilar amounts for each of the past five years.
"It's been a while since it's been higher than that,"
Cooper said. "Increases have been in that range for quite
some time."
Even with rising tuition costs, however, Cooper em
phasized Stanford's commitment to meeting students'
full needs in terms of financial assistance.
