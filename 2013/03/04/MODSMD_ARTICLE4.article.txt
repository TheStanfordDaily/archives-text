# Hospital layoffs draw backlash
## SLAC petitions for janitorial staff 
### ALYA NAQVI 
Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
(SHC)'s recent decision to implement
job cuts and offload services to an ex
ternal contractor has prompted alle
gations of negligence and worker
abuse from community members, as
well as a petition from the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
protesting the moves.
According to the SLAC petition,
SHC has recently laid off a dozen jan
itorial workers. In addition, 13 of the
School of Medicine's original 38
housekeeping assistants have been
offered voluntary service packages
and relieved, according to SLAC
member Laurel Fish 'l4. Some have
since been rehired in part-time ca
pacities.
Of the remaining 25,16 have been
granted only provisional employment
until October 2013 and nine have
been converted into "float workers"
without any guarantee of permanent
employment.
Meanwhile, according to the peti
tion, six of nine janitors at the Clark
Center, a research facility affiliated
with SHC, were relieved of their po
sitions in a process that began last
November. The janitors were subse
quently rehired by a subcontractor
UGL Unicco to perform the

same job for less money and fewer
benefits.
The SLAC petition demands that
current workers be guaranteed em
ployment beyond October 2013, that
float workers be guaranteed full-time
regular jobs, that the pay and benefit
levels or full-time status of Clark
Center workers be restored and that
the University hire all housekeeping
assistants and managers directly,
ceasing both existing and new con
tracts with any subcontractors.
According to Fish, the online peti
tion resulted from a series of meet
ings with workers at the Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine and
the Clark Center. Fish said that
SLAC members tried to reach out to
the administration several times in
November and December but that
they were tamed away, leading them
to create the petition.
The University does not plan,
however, to respond to the petition.
"This is a two-month-old issue,"
said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin. 'Action has already happened,
and I don't think anything further is
going to happen.
Lapin said that the University
had hired a subcontractor to manage
janitorial services at the Clark Cen-
ter to avoid using hospital
housekeeping staff in a differ
ent type of facility.
"When the Clark Center
housekeepers were offered
positions with UGL, every ef
fort was to be made to make
these positions at the top of
the pay scale, with full house
benefits and seniority vaca
tion time," Lapin said. "Stan
ford does have standards by
which it asks its subcontrac
tors to abide."
Najja Kossally 'l3, the
SLAC member who started
the petition, argued that sub
contracting has become in
creasingly popular because it
releases the University from
responsibility to its workers.
"If the subcontractor is re
ally terrible, Stanford can say,
'Well, is not really our issue,"'
he said.
Since the changes were
implemented last year, both
SLAC members and hospital
workers have claimed that
workloads have increased by
unreasonable amounts. One
worker at SHC, who like
all the workers interviewed
for this article asked that
her name not be used to help
protect her job security, said
that she is now expected to
clean 18 rooms in the same
amount of time she used to
clean nine, and that she often
is not given free time for
lunch.
Another worker at the
Stanford School of Medicine
described how he was injured
as a result of increased work
loads.
"When I came back, [the
managers] would just throw
more work at me," he said.
"This happens in big num
bers, and I want to get the
voice out for many of my co
workers."
The worker also asserted
that managers had subjected
him and other workers to poor
treatment, citing examples of
verbal harassment includ
ing being told by a manager
that he was making too much
money as well as receiving
warnings from another that
she would be "watching" him
and his co-workers in the cam
eras. In addition, he said that
the management has exacer
bated workers' unease with
regards to being rehired in
October when their contracts

expire.
"Our future is very, very
unstable," he said. "There are
always rumors about a new
company coming in anytime
and the management tells us
we're not going to rehire you."
After he and some of his
co-workers presented their
concerns to Amir Dan Rubin,
the hospital's president, the
worker reported being
quizzed in small meetings
about their experience at
SHC and being offered rec
ommendation letters to look
for jobs elsewhere.
Another housekeeping as
sistant at the Stanford School
of Medicine alleged a lack of
respect by managers when he
was denied his request for ad
ditional bereavement leave af
ter his mother passed away.
"My manager asked for a
death certificate," he said. "It
didn't seem like he believed
me."
Lapin emphasized that the
University cannot get in
volved with the workers'
grievances due to the exis
tence of a workers' union.
However, one of the workers
claimed that neither the HR
department nor the union
would address their concerns
and often sided with the man
agers.
When asked about this
concern, Lapin said that the
union may be unable to ad
dress concerns at the moment
because, until recently, it was
embroiled in biennial elec
tions.

"The University can't get
involved because [the issue is
between] a contractor and the
... union," she said. "I couldn't
speak to any problems that
they would have there."
Kossally said that he
hoped the petition would
move students to demand that
the University step in.

"The University will often
claim that this is not your is
sue because the workers have
unions [to help them]," he
said. "No, this is your issue,
and of course you should be
involved."

member Laurel Fish 'l4. Some have
since been rehired in part-time ca
pacities.
Of the remaining 25,16 have been
granted only provisional employment
until October 2013 and nine have
been converted into "float workers"
without any guarantee of permanent
employment.
Meanwhile, according to the peti
tion, six of nine janitors at the Clark
Center, a research facility affiliated
with SHC, were relieved of their po
sitions in a process that began last
November. The janitors were subse
quently rehired by a subcontractor
UGL Unicco to perform the

same job for less money and fewer
benefits.
The SLAC petition demands that
current workers be guaranteed em
ployment beyond October 2013, that
float workers be guaranteed full-time
regular jobs, that the pay and benefit
levels or full-time status of Clark
Center workers be restored and that
the University hire all housekeeping
assistants and managers directly,
ceasing both existing and new con
tracts with any subcontractors.
According to Fish, the online peti
tion resulted from a series of meet
ings with workers at the Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine and
the Clark Center. Fish said that
SLAC members tried to reach out to
the administration several times in
November and December but that
they were tamed away, leading them
to create the petition.
The University does not plan,
however, to respond to the petition.
"This is a two-month-old issue,"
said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin. 'Action has already happened,
and I don't think anything further is
going to happen.
Lapin said that the University
had hired a subcontractor to manage
janitorial services at the Clark Cen-
ter to avoid using hospital
housekeeping staff in a differ
ent type of facility.
"When the Clark Center
housekeepers were offered
positions with UGL, every ef
fort was to be made to make
these positions at the top of
the pay scale, with full house
benefits and seniority vaca
tion time," Lapin said. "Stan
ford does have standards by
which it asks its subcontrac
tors to abide."
Najja Kossally 'l3, the
SLAC member who started
the petition, argued that sub
contracting has become in
creasingly popular because it
releases the University from
responsibility to its workers.
"If the subcontractor is re
ally terrible, Stanford can say,
'Well, is not really our issue,"'
he said.
Since the changes were
implemented last year, both
SLAC members and hospital
workers have claimed that
workloads have increased by
unreasonable amounts. One
worker at SHC, who like
all the workers interviewed
for this article asked that
her name not be used to help
protect her job security, said
that she is now expected to
clean 18 rooms in the same
amount of time she used to
clean nine, and that she often
is not given free time for
lunch.
Another worker at the
Stanford School of Medicine
described how he was injured
as a result of increased work
loads.
"When I came back, [the
managers] would just throw
more work at me," he said.
"This happens in big num
bers, and I want to get the
voice out for many of my co
workers."
The worker also asserted
that managers had subjected
him and other workers to poor
treatment, citing examples of
verbal harassment includ
ing being told by a manager
that he was making too much
money as well as receiving
warnings from another that
she would be "watching" him
and his co-workers in the cam
eras. In addition, he said that
the management has exacer
bated workers' unease with
regards to being rehired in
October when their contracts

expire.
"Our future is very, very
unstable," he said. "There are
always rumors about a new
company coming in anytime
and the management tells us
we're not going to rehire you."
After he and some of his
co-workers presented their
concerns to Amir Dan Rubin,
the hospital's president, the
worker reported being
quizzed in small meetings
about their experience at
SHC and being offered rec
ommendation letters to look
for jobs elsewhere.
Another housekeeping as
sistant at the Stanford School
of Medicine alleged a lack of
respect by managers when he
was denied his request for ad
ditional bereavement leave af
ter his mother passed away.
"My manager asked for a
death certificate," he said. "It
didn't seem like he believed
me."
Lapin emphasized that the
University cannot get in
volved with the workers'
grievances due to the exis
tence of a workers' union.
However, one of the workers
claimed that neither the HR
department nor the union
would address their concerns
and often sided with the man
agers.
When asked about this
concern, Lapin said that the
union may be unable to ad
dress concerns at the moment
because, until recently, it was
embroiled in biennial elec
tions.

"The University can't get
involved because [the issue is
between] a contractor and the
... union," she said. "I couldn't
speak to any problems that
they would have there."
Kossally said that he
hoped the petition would
move students to demand that
the University step in.

"The University will often
claim that this is not your is
sue because the workers have
unions [to help them]," he
said. "No, this is your issue,
and of course you should be
involved."

Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
(SHC)'s recent decision to implement
job cuts and offload services to an ex
ternal contractor has prompted alle
gations of negligence and worker
abuse from community members, as
well as a petition from the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
protesting the moves.
According to the SLAC petition,
SHC has recently laid off a dozen jan
itorial workers. In addition, 13 of the
School of Medicine's original 38
housekeeping assistants have been
offered voluntary service packages
and relieved, according to SLAC
member Laurel Fish 'l4. Some have
since been rehired in part-time ca
pacities.
Of the remaining 25,16 have been
granted only provisional employment
until October 2013 and nine have
been converted into "float workers"
without any guarantee of permanent
employment.

tion, six of nine janitors at the Clark
Center, a research facility affiliated

sitions in a process that began last

quently rehired by a subcontractor
UGL Unicco to perform the

same job for less money and fewer
