# Hospital layoffs draw backlash
## SLAC petitions for janitorial staff 
### ALYA NAQVI 
Stanford Hospitals and Clinics
(SHC)'s recent decision to implement
job cuts and offload services to an ex
ternal contractor has prompted alle
gations of negligence and worker
abuse from community members, as
well as a petition from the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
protesting the moves.
According to the SLAC petition,
SHC has recently laid off a dozen jan
itorial workers. In addition, 13 of the
School of Medicine's original 38
housekeeping assistants have been
offered voluntary service packages
and relieved, according to SLAC
member Laurel Fish 'l4. Some have
since been rehired in part-time ca
pacities.
Of the remaining 25,16 have been
granted only provisional employment
until October 2013 and nine have
been converted into "float workers"
without any guarantee of permanent
employment.
Meanwhile, according to the peti
tion, six of nine janitors at the Clark
Center, a research facility affiliated
with SHC, were relieved of their po
sitions in a process that began last
November. The janitors were subse
quently rehired by a subcontractor
UGL Unicco to perform the

same job for less money and fewer
benefits.
The SLAC petition demands that
current workers be guaranteed em
ployment beyond October 2013, that
float workers be guaranteed full-time
regular jobs, that the pay and benefit
levels or full-time status of Clark
Center workers be restored and that
the University hire all housekeeping
assistants and managers directly,
ceasing both existing and new con
tracts with any subcontractors.
According to Fish, the online peti
tion resulted from a series of meet
ings with workers at the Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine and
the Clark Center. Fish said that
SLAC members tried to reach out to
the administration several times in
November and December but that
they were tamed away, leading them
to create the petition.
The University does not plan,
however, to respond to the petition.
"This is a two-month-old issue,"
said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin. 'Action has already happened,
and I don't think anything further is
going to happen.
Lapin said that the University
had hired a subcontractor to manage
janitorial services at the Clark Cen-
