# Q&A STEPHEN TRUSHEIM ASSU ASSISTANT FINANCIAL MANAGER
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 was the Elections Commissioner
in 2011, among other posts he has held in the ASSU.
With less than a week to declare intent to seek an AS
SU office, The Daily sat down with Trusheim to discuss
this year's elections and the ASSU's future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What has been your in
volvement with the ASSU?
Stephen Trusheim (ST): My freshman year, I was in
volved with Frosh Council, which in those days was
much more tightly connected to the ASSU. My sopho
more year I was the Elections Commissioner, as well as
on the Sophomore Class Cabinet for the first half of the
year. [ln my] junior year, I was the Chair of Student
Life and my title kind of shifted around depending on

what I was exactly doing at the time, but more or less
just working with [former ASSU President] Michael
Cruz ['l2] on issues about student life.
TSD: What do you think about the number of candi
dates who have declared this year?
ST: It's about standard. One Executive slate is a bit
10w... It's weird that not even the Chappie [Stanford
Chaparral] is running against them. The number of
senators is pretty average, the number of GSC [Gradu
ate Student Council] reps is pretty average, special fee
groups are up a little bit, but they are always up before
petitions come in, and some of them don't make it.
TSD: Have the elections changed in any significant
way during your time at Stanford?
ST: My freshman year was the first year

Trusheim, the ASSU Assistant Financial
Manager, served as Elections
Commissioner in 2011. A veteran
of several campaigns, he sat down
with The Daily to talk about this
year's election.
petitions.stanford.edu was a
thing... It has had interesting
impacts on how the elections
work because everyone peti
tions online now and cam
paigns online.
I personally think that it
makes the elections a little bit
more issues-focused... If you
are very interested in ASSU
elections, you can sit down
and really focus on what you
want to do in this election as a
voter.
TSD: What do you think the
ASSU is doing well?
ST: We've done a very
good job of being invisible... a
lot of the services that the AS
SU provides... have just be
come part of the culture at
Stanford. You expect to have
these things, and that's won
derful.
We fund 150 student
groups and all you have to do
to get money is sit down with
them for a half hour and you
can get up to $6,000 for your
student group... That's an
amazing opportunity that the
ASSU actually enables, it
doesn't have to happen.
I think that Nominations
Commission is another one of
those really important, really
in-the-background sorts of
things where we have the
ability and the right and the
opportunity to appoint stu
dents to sit 0n... committees
that really make change at
this University... It is really
those boring pieces of the AS
SU that I think function the
best, the parts of the ASSU
that do work every year and
you never hear about it unless
you are deeply involved.
TSD: What do you think the
ASSU needs to improve on?
ST: I think the ASSU
needs to have an affirmative
vision for the future. We need
to say what we want our stu
dent life to look like and work
towards it. A lot of the ASSU
right now is kind of reactive.
Suites [Dining] gets shut
down, so the ASSU starts
dealing with Suites. There's
the whole deal about classes
at 8:30 so the ASSU starts
dealing with classes at 8:30...
I would love to see the ASSU
... really work towards a goal
and a place we want to be in
stead of just reacting.
I think we need to improve
the services we provide to stu
dent groups on the SSE
[Stanford Student Enterpris
es] side of things... student
groups are very frustrated

with the way our accounting
systems work ...We need to
have better institutional
memory. We really need to
not lose four months every
year because people are get
ting up to speed on what it is
that we do.
TSD: What are the biggest
challenges facing the ASSU
going forward?
ST: The biggest problems
we are going to have are apa
thy and the fact that a lot of
these things are going to be
hard work. Everyone is very
apathetic towards the ASSU
unless they are messing up, in
which case they hate it... No
one really likes the ASSU,
ever.
I don't blame them, that's
totally fine... even though the
vast majority of Stanford stu
dents are incredibly intelli
gent people who could solve
problems, they are not in
clined to try to solve problems
for the ASSU ... Everyone
wants change, but no one
wants to be the people to do it,
because why would you work
for the ASSU?
TSD: Do you have any pre
dictions for this year's elec
tion, or anything that you
would like to see from the
candidates or the voters?
ST: Something bad is go
ing to happen in the last
week of the election. I have
no idea what it is going to be,
but for the past three years
there has always been some
thing bad that happened in
the last week of the election
... I want really good, really
passionate representatives
who are willing to work hard
on Senate. I have faith in
[ASSU Executive candi
dates Dan] Ashton ['l4] and
[Billy] Gallagher ['l4] to get
things done and I hope they
get complemented by solid
undergraduate senators who
are also willing to deeply con
sider problems and help out
with their solutions.
