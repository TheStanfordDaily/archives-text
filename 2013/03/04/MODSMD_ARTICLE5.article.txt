# Q&A STEPHEN TRUSHEIM ASSU ASSISTANT FINANCIAL MANAGER
## 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
ASSU Assistant Financial Manager Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 M.S. 'l4 was the Elections Commissioner
in 2011, among other posts he has held in the ASSU.
With less than a week to declare intent to seek an AS
SU office, The Daily sat down with Trusheim to discuss
this year's elections and the ASSU's future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What has been your in
volvement with the ASSU?
Stephen Trusheim (ST): My freshman year, I was in
volved with Frosh Council, which in those days was
much more tightly connected to the ASSU. My sopho
more year I was the Elections Commissioner, as well as
on the Sophomore Class Cabinet for the first half of the
year. [ln my] junior year, I was the Chair of Student
Life and my title kind of shifted around depending on

what I was exactly doing at the time, but more or less
just working with [former ASSU President] Michael
Cruz ['l2] on issues about student life.
TSD: What do you think about the number of candi
dates who have declared this year?
ST: It's about standard. One Executive slate is a bit
10w... It's weird that not even the Chappie [Stanford
Chaparral] is running against them. The number of
senators is pretty average, the number of GSC [Gradu
ate Student Council] reps is pretty average, special fee
groups are up a little bit, but they are always up before
petitions come in, and some of them don't make it.
TSD: Have the elections changed in any significant
way during your time at Stanford?
ST: My freshman year was the first year
