# CARDINAÂ£ BASEBALL
## HERDING THE LONGHORNS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Sparked by another masterful outing
from senior starting pitcher Mark Appel
Friday night, No. 16 Stanford over
whelmed No. 23 Texas for a three-game
home sweep to extend the Cardinal's win
ning streak to eight.

Stanford (9-2) took the series opener
Friday night over Texas (6-5), topping the
Longhorns 2-0. The Cardinal scored two
runs before Texas sophomore starter
Parker French could record an out in the
bottom of the first and coasted behind its
dominant starting pitcher the rest of the
way.
Appel (2-1) pitched his second consec
utive gem to lead Stanford. Last week,
scouts said his one-ran, 11-strikeout per
formance was perhaps the best game he
had ever pitched. That mark didn't even
survive a week.
Continuing to mix in more of his
changeup, Appel made every Longhorn
look silly. The ace struck out 14 tying
his career-high while going the dis
tance for a three-hit shutout.
"When you're pounding your fastball
down, which is something I've been really
focusing on this year, the changeup is a lot
more effective," Appel said. 'And then, I
think last year, and sophomore year, I

would try to guide it a little bit and now I
feel I'm just throwing it and it's getting
that good downward action. It's an effec
tive pitch."
On Saturday, Stanford's bats and
bullpen took over, rescuing sophomore
starting pitcher John Hochstatter.
Hochstatter struggled with his command
and lasted only three innings, but was
able to keep the Longhorns scoreless,
thanks in large part to a rare defensive
feat in the first inning.
After Hochstatter loaded the bases
with no outs to start the game, Texas's
four-hitter sent a line drive toward junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger.
Diekroeger stabbed it and fired to junior
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila and Kauppila
threw back to junior Brian Ragira at first
base to complete the triple play and keep
Texas off the board.
Amazingly, it was the second time in
the last two years that Diekroeger turned
a triple play. In summer-league ball after
his freshman season, with Diekroeger
playing second base, his team turned an
around-the-horn triple play third base
to Diekroeger at second base to first base
on a ground ball to third.
The all-junior triple play set the tone
for the rest of the day, as Stanford never
lost the momentum en route to an easy 7-
2 victory Freshman Daniel Starwalt (2-0)
scattered three hits and a walk and struck
out three in 3.1 scoreless innings in relief
of Hochstatter to earn the victory

CASEY VALENTINE/The Stanford Daily
Taking a no-hitter into the sxith inning, senior ace
Mark Appel (above) struck out 11 Longhorn batters to
give Stanford a 2-0 victory over Texas on Friday night.
Diekroeger's exciting day wasn't
done yet either. The junior doubled
Stanford's lead to 2-0 in the fifth in
ning with a towering solo home run
to right field. Diekroeger's fast start
to the season has been a big part of
Stanford's early season success.
"I don't think a lot of people saw
it coming," Diekroeger told The
Bootleg's David Lombardi. "We
don't really have the same big-name
guys that we did maybe last year
and the year before but the bullpen
and the whole pitching staff has car
ried our team this year, no doubt."
The Cardinal sealed the victory
with a four-run seventh inning. Sen
ior designated hitter Justin Ringo
continued the hot start to his season
with an RBI single to start the scor
ing. Then, a pair of sophomores who
haven't started with as much of a
bang as Ringo, left fielder Dominic

Jose and catcher Wayne Taylor,
added an RBI single and a two-RBI
single respectively to cap off the in
ning.
Stanford came within one out of
shutting out the Longhorns com
pletely for the second straight day.
Junior pitcher Sam Lindquist gave
up a two-run single to Erich Weiss
with two outs in the top of the ninth,
but then retired Payton to finish off
the game and earn his second save
of the season.
On Sunday, runs were at a pre
mium once again. Freshman starter
Bobby Zarubin continued his re
markable ascent in the pitching
staff, throwing eight innings of one
run ball in his first career start. In
18.2 innings of work over three ap
pearances, Zarubin has allowed just
two runs, good for a 0.96 ERA.
Zarubin struggled with his com
mand early, much like Hochstatter
the day before. In the third, he
walked the bases loaded and al
lowed one run before escaping the
jam. It looked like his day might
have been destined to end early, but

he made an adjustment and caught
fire.
"Coach Filter kind of talked it
out," Zarubin said. "He said he
wants me to throw a little more fast
balls, let them get themselves out,
instead of just throwing a bunch of
splitters up there hoping they're
swinging and missing. It drives up
your pitch count, so I had my de
fense help me out a little bit."
After the third inning, Zarubin
allowed only one Texas base runner
on a two-out walk in the fourth to
designated hitter Ben Johnson
who got thrown out trying to steal
during the next at-bat to end the in
ning until senior Garrett Hughes
(2-0) got called in to relieve Zarubin
for the ninth inning. Zarubin and
Hughes combined to hold Texas to
only two hits on the afternoon.
For Zarubin, who was recruited
mostly as an infielder and played
solely infield for the fall practice
season, his performance isn't a
dream come true it's a dream he
couldn't even imagine.
"It's crazy, man. I came in as an

infielder," Zarubin said. "If you
would've asked me my first day here
at Stanford, 'what position do you
think you're going to be playing?' I
never would've even guessed pitch
er, let alone the Sunday starter."
But the way Zarubin has pitched
over the past three weekends, it
looks like he'll be a weekend starter
for a while. The combination of pow
er-righty Appel, slow-throwing
lefty Hochstatter, and the splitter
throwing-righty Zarubin has left
hitters clueless. On Sunday, with
Stanford only able to manage one
run through Zarubin's eight innings
of work, Zarubin's shutdown per
formance was vital.
In the bottom of the ninth, after
Dominic Jose flied out to lead off the
inning, sophomore third baseman
Alex Blandino singled up the middle
to put the winning run on base. That
brought up Kauppila, who capped
off a brilliant defensive weekend
with a walk-off double to right-cen
ter field.
"They'd been pounding me in the
whole entire weekend so I've been

kind of cheating that way," Kauppila
told KZSU after the game. "I knew
he was going to come back at me
with another fastball so I kind of just
sat on it, got really inside of it and
poked it to right and once I saw it get
in the gap I was extremely happy
and I knew the game would be over."
Blandino wasn't sure it was over
as soon as Kauppila was.
"I went hard off first," Blandino
said. "I saw it in the gap and I knew
I had a chance to score right away. I
knew it was slicing away from the
centei'fielder. I saw Deano [Stotz]
waving hard, waving hard. I knew I
had to go. And then I had a pretty
good feeling rounding third that I
was going to make it and I was just
pumped, ready to celebrate."
Stanford will head back on the
road for a Tbesday evening contest
at Santa Clara (6-6). First pitch is
scheduled for 6:00 p.m., as the Cardi
nal will look to make it nine straight
victories.
