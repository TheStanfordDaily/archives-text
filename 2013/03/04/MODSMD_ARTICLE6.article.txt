# CARDINAÂ£ BASEBALL
## HERDING THE LONGHORNS 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
Sparked by another masterful outing
from senior starting pitcher Mark Appel
Friday night, No. 16 Stanford over
whelmed No. 23 Texas for a three-game
home sweep to extend the Cardinal's win
ning streak to eight.

Stanford (9-2) took the series opener
Friday night over Texas (6-5), topping the
Longhorns 2-0. The Cardinal scored two
runs before Texas sophomore starter
Parker French could record an out in the
bottom of the first and coasted behind its
dominant starting pitcher the rest of the
way.
Appel (2-1) pitched his second consec
utive gem to lead Stanford. Last week,
scouts said his one-ran, 11-strikeout per
formance was perhaps the best game he
had ever pitched. That mark didn't even
survive a week.
Continuing to mix in more of his
changeup, Appel made every Longhorn
look silly. The ace struck out 14 tying
his career-high while going the dis
tance for a three-hit shutout.
"When you're pounding your fastball
down, which is something I've been really
focusing on this year, the changeup is a lot
more effective," Appel said. 'And then, I
think last year, and sophomore year, I

would try to guide it a little bit and now I
feel I'm just throwing it and it's getting
that good downward action. It's an effec
tive pitch."
On Saturday, Stanford's bats and
bullpen took over, rescuing sophomore
starting pitcher John Hochstatter.
Hochstatter struggled with his command
and lasted only three innings, but was
able to keep the Longhorns scoreless,
thanks in large part to a rare defensive
feat in the first inning.
After Hochstatter loaded the bases
with no outs to start the game, Texas's
four-hitter sent a line drive toward junior
second baseman Danny Diekroeger.
Diekroeger stabbed it and fired to junior
shortstop Lonnie Kauppila and Kauppila
threw back to junior Brian Ragira at first
base to complete the triple play and keep
Texas off the board.
Amazingly, it was the second time in
the last two years that Diekroeger turned
a triple play. In summer-league ball after
his freshman season, with Diekroeger
playing second base, his team turned an
around-the-horn triple play third base
to Diekroeger at second base to first base
on a ground ball to third.
The all-junior triple play set the tone
for the rest of the day, as Stanford never
lost the momentum en route to an easy 7-
2 victory Freshman Daniel Starwalt (2-0)
scattered three hits and a walk and struck
out three in 3.1 scoreless innings in relief
of Hochstatter to earn the victory
