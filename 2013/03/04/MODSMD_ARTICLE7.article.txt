## CAB unveils new diversity group grants 
### BAKER TILNEY 
The ASSU's Community Action Board
(CAB) recently launched a grants initia
tive to fond programming that promotes
more extensive collaboration between di
verse groups on campus.
The CAB, which was established as a
permanent institution of the ASSU last
year, is a coalition of 23 students represent
ing various communities, including differ
ent ethnic and religious groups. CAB
members collaborate to support student
organizations, with a particular focus on
under-standing and fostering diversity.
President John Hennessy allocated
$5,000 to the CAB to sponsor the grants
initiative, which is named the Community
Partnership Program. Through the pro
gram, student groups and organizations
can collaborate to submit proposals for
projects, with accepted proposals receiv
ing up to $5OO from the CAB.
ASSU President Robbie Zimbroff 'l2
M.A. 'l3 expressed hope that the program
will get more students involved in diversi
ty initiatives and dialogue. Zimbroff said
that, in his discussions with the Presiden
t's Office about creating the grants, both
sides agreed that it is "important for peo
ple to think about what diversity means on
campus."
"College is a very unique experience
where a lot of people from a lot of different
backgrounds and walks of life come to
gether," Zimbroff said. "We should spend
some time taking advantage of everything
that exists around us."
According to Zimbroff) the grants are
primarily intended to fond groups that
have not yet contributed to diversity pro
gramming.
"We don't want to just fond a program
where people who are already incredibly
active in community centers are just doing
more programming," Zimbroff said.
"There's an emphasis on bringing new
people to the table."
Zimbroff said that his own experiences
with diversity motivated his enthusiasm
about the program, citing his unintention
al draw into Ujamaa, the African-Diaspo
ra-theme dorm, as having changed his
view on diversity at Stanford. After living
in Ujamaa during his sophomore year,
Zimbroff served as a resident assistant in
the dorm for two years.
"The people who I'm looking to target
in this program are people who might not
be so lucky to have the draw de
termine for them that they get
the opportunity to be exposed
to diversity," Zimbroff said.
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-chair of
the CAB, said that ethnic
theme dorms like Ujamaa
might be model applicants for
grants.
"One of the examples used a
lot is, 'How do we get different
ethnic themed dorms to collab
orate?' or, 'How do we get stu
dents who live in Stern but not
in Zapata to engage with Zapa
ta?"' Fetter said.
The grant application,
which is currently available on
line, stresses that projects
should bring together commu
nities that do not often interact
with each other. Successful ap

plicants will also be required to
meet with the grant committee
after their program's comple
tion to discuss the outcome and
share any insights they have
gained.
The CAB accepts applica
tions for grants on a rolling ba
sis, though applicants must
submit proposals at least three
weeks before the planned event
date. Rinding will be granted in
varied amounts, and Zimbroff
said that the number of proj
ects that will be ftmded has yet
to be determined.
"The metric is not how
many programs are being put
on, it's about the quality of
them," Zimbroff said. But
[something like] 10 programs
with $5OO each per year, seems
like a reasonable amount and
something that could hopefully
touch a lot of students."
