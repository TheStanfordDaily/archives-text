### BAKER TILNEY 
The ASSU's Community Action Board
(CAB) recently launched a grants initia
tive to fond programming that promotes
more extensive collaboration between di
verse groups on campus.
The CAB, which was established as a
permanent institution of the ASSU last
year, is a coalition of 23 students represent

members collaborate to support student
organizations, with a particular focus on

President John Hennessy allocated
$5,000 to the CAB to sponsor the grants
