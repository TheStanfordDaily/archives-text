# STUDENT LIFE
## Designathon promotes public service 
### DOMINICA WAMBOLD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Design for America (DFA)'s first an
nual Designathon at Stanford brought to
gether more than 20 students this week
end to brainstorm solutions to increasing
engagement in public service on campus.
At the event, which was held on March
2 at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
(d.school), student teams presented propos
als to the Haas Center for Public Service's
Executive Director Thomas Schnaubelt
and Director of Executive Partnerships
Kelly Beck, who served as judges.
Groups were tasked with devising a va
riety of solutions to the issue of low student
engagement in public service, with a focus
on bringing public service to the forefront
of the Stanford student experience.
According to Viraj Bindra 'l5, Director
of Communication for DFAs Stanford
chapter, one of the primary goals of the
event was getting students interested in
the design process.
"[The event] was much more for en
gagement, just to get people thinking
about this if they have zero experience or
even if they have a lot," he said. "One of

the things we do at DFA is focus on social
problems and tailor our design thinking
towards those, so this is an excellent ex
ample that is specific to Stanford of what
we do on a broader scale nationwide."
The event attracted a diverse audi
ence, from DFA project leaders to stu
dents with no prior design experience.
David Herman 'l6, a project leader,
helped guide newcomers through the de
sign process' various steps, including con
ducting research, framing a question and
creating a prototype.
"It's an iterative process, but in the
end you end up with a pretty good fram
ing and understanding of the problem,
and you have a pretty good understand
ing of how a solution could help address
the problem," Herman said.
Bindra's group proposed an app with
a calendar 1 of public service events that
would allow students to "check in" at
events and earn points based on the num
ber of events they attended. Students
would then be able to redeem those
points for perks like skipping the line at
Ike's.

However, the judges expressed concern
that the app would struggle to gain traction

among students and instead chose a group
composed of non-DFA members as the
winner. The winning group's proposal fo
cused on improving outreach to incoming
freshmen by establishing service hubs in
freshmen dorms and sending out materials
showcasing Stanford's community service
opportunities.
"We loved the focus on freshman,"
Schnaubelt said. "This is a terrible analo
gy, but it's like with smoking campaigns.
Who do you target? The kids. We like the
actual connection to the freshman
dorms."
According to Schnaubelt, the Haas
Center's collaboration with Design for
America has just begun.
"Design for America is going to be
working on a part of our redesign that in
volves how Stanford students get in
volved in those mentoring and tutoring
programs," Schnaubelt said. "I'm partic
ularly interested in how we create a pro
gram that will allow Stanford students to
participate, particularly around [the lim
ited] time that is available."
