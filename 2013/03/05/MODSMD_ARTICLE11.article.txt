# Looking for inspiration as time ticks down
## 
### Tom Taylor 
On Friday it hit me. An
innocent email from
my Managing Editor
at The Daily inform
ing me of this week's
budget tipped me over the edge.
Four stories due from me next
week; 3,600, hopefully well-chosen,
words; six stories by other people
due on my editing night, Tuesday,
equaling another 4,400 words for me
to sift through and check, before
helping out with the whole layout
process of the next day's paper.
And I'm supposed to be a full
time student, supposed to be busy
writing my doctoral thesis 200-
plus pages of far less comprehensi
ble text.
It's crunch time, the final few
minutes of winter quarter, the sec
onds ticking steadily by, the score
board burning painfully bright with
a simple message: I'm down, maybe
hopefully not by much, and
I'm certainly not feeling on top of
this situation.
To add insult to injury, my Mac-
Book Pro, perhaps the most impor
tant thing in my life right now, also
threw in the towel on Friday. Instead
of a nice helpful cursor, I was treated
to the Spinning Beach Ball of Death,
my files and applications frustrat
ingly out of reach behind the frozen
screen of my laptop.
Last week, one of my fellow
columnists wrote about everything
other people get from literature that
he gets from sports. On an average
week, I'd say my relationship with
sports doesn't go much deeper than
simple light-hearted entertainment,
but there are some times this
week, for example that I need
something more: inspiration.
Sure, books can be inspiring, but
rarely in quite the same way. Fiction
feeds a healthy imagination, but I
think most of us realize that when all
is said and done, it is just fiction.
Achieving the impossible in the vir
tual world is far less impressive than
even achieving average things in the
real world.
Non-fiction can be much more in
spiring, reading real accounts of how
ordinary people did extraordinary
things, how they went from nothing
to something and changed the world.
It's hard not to take at least some
thing from such stories, not to start
believing that even we can do some
thing special with our lives.
But even that falls a little short
because though it might be true, it
lacks the reality of a story unfolding
right now, before our very eyes.
What's done is done, we know how it
is all going to end. There are few sur
prises in non-fiction.
I've never really understood why
fans might want to watch a game
they have already seen again in its
entirety. Perhaps the highlights, to
marvel again at a few key moments
and better understand them but not
to sit down to try and relive the ac
tion play-by-play. Especially not
when there is far too much going on
in the real world, both inside and
outside of the realm of sports, to en
thrall anyone.
Sports live sports are in
spiring because anything can hap
pen. You might be down, but you're
never out of it until the final whistle
or buzzer is blown. It can of course
be disheartening too, because that is
the yin to inspiration's yang. When
your team gets torn to pieces or
crumbles of its own accord, it's pret
ty depressing, but without that emo
tion lurking behind every defeat the
highs wouldn't be quite as high.
You can go down in style too.
David doesn't always get to beat Go
liath, but against much bigger oppo
sition he can still inspire us all with
the way he plays the game the
teamwork, the togetherness, the
against-all-odds, the never-say-die
attitude.
As much as we might not realize
it, we're a team outside of sports too.
College is a game and the dreaded
curve means you're often competing
head-to-head with your closest
friends. Homework and exams are
just a cruel obstacle course we must
negotiate; succeeding at them does
n't prove for certain that you learned
anything anymore than failing
means you learned nothing.
And just when everything looked
hopeless for me, my own team
stepped up. My fellow women's bas
ketball beat writer and desk editor
volunteered to grab my editing du
ties and at least once of those stories
