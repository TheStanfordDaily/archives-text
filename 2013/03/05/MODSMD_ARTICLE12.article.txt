# BASEBALL SADDLES UP
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
Extended winning streaks in
baseball are hard to come by be
cause of the dynamic and multifac
eted nature of the sport. In order to
win a long streak of games, a team
needs lights-out pitching, timely hit
ting and a fair bit of luck. On its cur
rent eight-game tear, No. 9 Stan
ford (9-2) has gotten all three and
will look to extend its torrid streak
tonight at Santa Clara University
(6-6).
Stanford is no stranger to early
season success. Last season, it ex
ploded out of the gate with eight
straight victories en route to a 13-1
start to a season in which it reached
the NCAA Super Regionals.
The Cardinal will hope to outdo
itself and claim a ninth straight vic
tory against a shaky Broncos team
after sweeping the powerful Texas
Longhorns at home.
"It's huge, man," said third base
man Alex Blandino about Texas.
"This is a good team. Every time
they come in here, it's always a good
series, and we took it to them all
weekend. Those were three really
fun, close games; a lot of intensity."
Lights-out pitching has been a
defining constant of the young sea
son for Stanford. Perennially-domi
nant senior ace Mark Appel has put
on a show for spectators and scouts
alike and only seems to be getting
better.
Together with his fellow rotation
members and a lights-out bullpen,
the Cardinal pitching staff has sti
fled opposing batters to the tune of
a.200 opponent batting average and
a microscopic 1.74 staff ERA.
Stanford will be the second
ranked opponent for the Broncos
this year, which dropped a 5-4 deci
sion to current No. 25 Cal Poly. Oth
erwise, Santa Clara's schedule has
been relatively weak, consisting of
opponents like 3-9 Seattle Universi
ty, 3-6 University of Illinois at
Chicago and 3-4 Northern Col
orado.
Stanford's presumed starter,
senior right-hander Dean McArdle,

has been solid in his appearances as
the weekday starter. He gave up on
ly one run in five innings of work
against Cal and Saint Mary's and
will look to pitch a few solid innings
before turning it over to the bullpen.
Santa Clara, meanwhile, has
struggled on the mound this season.
The Broncos' pitching staff has al
lowed a whopping 70 earned runs
this season in 108 innings of work,
posting a 5.83 team ERA. In com
parison, the Cardinal huriers have
only allowed 19 earned runs in 98 in
nings thus far against much better
offenses.

Santa Clara's bats have been
successful this year with a team tal
ly of .314 compared to Stanford's
.266 clip. However, Santa Clara's
pitching has ruined several strong
hitting performances, such as the
Broncos' 16-11 loss to Seattle Uni
versity and 15-8 loss to the Univer
sity of Illinois at Chicago.
Stanford's batters will be looking
to tee off against the shaky Santa
Clara staff and make noise after be
ing relatively quiet against Texas.
The Card scored 11 runs during the
three-game series, but seven of
those came in game two and just

two apiece in the other two games.
In the series finale, a 2-1 victory
sealed by shortstop Lonnie Kauppi
la's walk-off double in the ninth, the
Cardinal pounded out 10 hits but
was only able to plate two runners.
Stanford has been able to regularly
put runners on base but has had is
sues bringing them all the way
home.
The offense will need to put up
more consistently strong perform
ances to ensure that the team can
still emerge victorious on days in
which the pitching is less dominant
than it was against Texas.
The Card will also hope to be as
successful on the road as it has been
at home. Stanford currently owns
an unblemished 7-0 record in the
friendly confines of Sunken Dia
mond but is 2-2 on the road. As
many key Pac-12 matchups over the
course of the season come on the
road, it is important that the Cardi
nal show the ability to pull out victo
ries regardless of the venue.
Stanford and Santa Clara will
square off at Schott Stadium in San
ta Clara this evening. The first pitch
will be at 6 p.m.

put up big numbers at the plate but
struggled on the mound this season.
Senior right-handed pitcher Dean
McArdle is expected to take the hill for
the Card in the mid-week matchup.

Extended winning streaks in
baseball are hard to come by be
cause of the dynamic and multifac
eted nature of the sport. In order to
win a long streak of games, a team
needs lights-out pitching, timely hit
ting and a fair bit of luck. On its cur
rent eight-game tear, No. 9 Stan
ford (9-2) has gotten all three and
will look to extend its torrid streak
tonight at Santa Clara University
(6-6).
Stanford is no stranger to early
season success. Last season, it ex
ploded out of the gate with eight
straight victories en route to a 13-1
start to a season in which it reached
the NCAA Super Regionals.
The Cardinal will hope to outdo
itself and claim a ninth straight vic
tory against a shaky Broncos team
after sweeping the powerful Texas
Longhorns at home.
"It's huge, man," said third base
man Alex Blandino about Texas.
"This is a good team. Every time
they come in here, it's always a good
series, and we took it to them all
weekend. Those were three really
fun, close games; a lot of intensity."
Lights-out pitching has been a
defining constant of the young sea
son for Stanford. Perennially-domi
nant senior ace Mark Appel has put
on a show for spectators and scouts
alike and only seems to be getting
better.
Together with his fellow rotation
members and a lights-out bullpen,
the Cardinal pitching staff has sti
fled opposing batters to the tune of
a.200 opponent batting average and
a microscopic 1.74 staff ERA.
Stanford will be the second
ranked opponent for the Broncos
this year, which dropped a 5-4 deci
sion to current No. 25 Cal Poly. Oth
erwise, Santa Clara's schedule has
been relatively weak, consisting of
opponents like 3-9 Seattle Universi
ty, 3-6 University of Illinois at
Chicago and 3-4 Northern Col
orado.
Stanford's presumed starter,
senior right-hander Dean McArdle,

has been solid in his appearances as
the weekday starter. He gave up on
ly one run in five innings of work
against Cal and Saint Mary's and
will look to pitch a few solid innings
before turning it over to the bullpen.
Santa Clara, meanwhile, has
struggled on the mound this season.
The Broncos' pitching staff has al
lowed a whopping 70 earned runs
this season in 108 innings of work,
posting a 5.83 team ERA. In com
parison, the Cardinal huriers have
only allowed 19 earned runs in 98 in
nings thus far against much better
offenses.

Santa Clara's bats have been
successful this year with a team tal
ly of .314 compared to Stanford's
.266 clip. However, Santa Clara's
pitching has ruined several strong
hitting performances, such as the
Broncos' 16-11 loss to Seattle Uni
versity and 15-8 loss to the Univer
sity of Illinois at Chicago.
Stanford's batters will be looking
to tee off against the shaky Santa
Clara staff and make noise after be
ing relatively quiet against Texas.
The Card scored 11 runs during the
three-game series, but seven of
those came in game two and just

two apiece in the other two games.
In the series finale, a 2-1 victory
sealed by shortstop Lonnie Kauppi
la's walk-off double in the ninth, the
Cardinal pounded out 10 hits but
was only able to plate two runners.
Stanford has been able to regularly
put runners on base but has had is
sues bringing them all the way
home.
The offense will need to put up
more consistently strong perform
ances to ensure that the team can
still emerge victorious on days in
which the pitching is less dominant
than it was against Texas.
The Card will also hope to be as
successful on the road as it has been
at home. Stanford currently owns
an unblemished 7-0 record in the
friendly confines of Sunken Dia
mond but is 2-2 on the road. As
many key Pac-12 matchups over the
course of the season come on the
road, it is important that the Cardi
nal show the ability to pull out victo
ries regardless of the venue.
Stanford and Santa Clara will
square off at Schott Stadium in San
ta Clara this evening. The first pitch
will be at 6 p.m.
