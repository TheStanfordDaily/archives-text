## Women beat Cal 6-1 in nonconference play 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
When Cal comes to town,
Stanford teams find a new level of
intensity in their play. It was no dif
ferent for the No. 26 women's ten
nis team (5-2) as it used a renewed
commitment to high-energy play
to achieve a 6-1 non-conference vic
tory over No. 9 Cal (5-4).

On Feb. 24, the team suffered
a tough 4-2 loss at the hands of
another big rival, the Florida
Gators, revealing a few key
changes that needed to be made.
"We're trying to up the intensity
for sure," said junior Nicole
Gibbs. "That's the baseline. We're
trying to be more organized with
our agenda each day when we go
out on the court. We're just trying
to get more physical as a team
and make sure we can outlast our
opponents on the court."
None of the women in the
Stanford lineup have ever experi
enced a loss to the Golden Bears.
The Cardinal has won its last sev
en matches against Cal dating
back to April 2009. Stanford will
meet Cal again, this time in Pac
-12 play, on April 19.
Stanford started the day off
well with another fine showing in
doubles. Juniors Rristie Ahn and
Gibbs defeated Cal's Lynn Chi
and Anett Schutting 8-4 and sen
ior Stacey Tan and sophomore
Ellen Tsay beat Cal's Kelly Chui
and Klara Fabikova by the same
score. This was a great sign for
Ahn and Gibbs as they have
struggled as a doubles pair over
the season.
"We started out the year with
me playing backhand, her at fore
hand," Ahn explained. "It wasn't

Stadium
really clicking and we
thought about splitting up
our pair for a bit. Instead, we
just tried switching sides. We
tried it out. It's been working
great ever since, and it's al
ways fun to play with her."
In singles, Stanford
showed that California's
higher ranking meant little
to them as the home team
rattled off five straight Car
dinal points. The first off the
court was Ahn, who put to
gether a dominant 6-3, 6-2
win over a clearly struggling
Lynn Chi.
Less than five minutes
later, Gibbs recorded a 6-2,
6-2 win at the top spot over
No. 8 Schutting. While she
ran away with the first set,
there was a momentum
struggle at 2-2 in the second.
Schutting put up a strong
battle on Gibbs' serve, but
after several ad points,
Gibbs was able to hold serve
and run away with the next
four games.
"When I was feeling con
fident, I was hitting my fore
hand pretty well and hitting
her off the court pretty ef
fectively," Gibbs said. "But
there were patches when I
wasn't hitting as confident,
and I relied on my move
ment and waited for her to
make errors or give me a
short ball to work with."
"I've played her three
times, and I'm 3-0," Gibbs
continued. "That being said,
I've played pretty well the
three times we have come up
against each other. She's no
one I would underestimate,
and I was happy to get the
win."
Krista Hardebeck and
Tsay were both close to win
ning at this point, too close to
tell who would provide the
clinching victory for Stan
ford. It proved to be the
promising freshman Harde
beck, who left the court with

a challenging 6-3, 7-5 victory
that provided a needed victo
ry in her first team competi
tion against the rival Golden
Bears.
"It was great clinching
the match," Hardebeck said.
"I've been struggling for the
past few weeks, and it's been
coming at a tough time for
my tennis. It was really im
portant to me to win a match
and help out my team. I was
so happy to be the one to fin
ish it off. I'm looking forward
to a lot more Stanford beat
downs of Cal."
Tsay closed a minute later
for a 6-2, 6-2 win that was
more difficult than the score
would suggest. Her doubles
partner Tan displayed an in
credible strength of will to

come back from a first set in
which she won zero games to
defeat Cal's Tayler Davis 0-6,
7-5, 6-0.
Cal took back one point
when Stanford freshman
Lindsey Kostas lost 7-6, 6-2
but only after competing in a
first-set that was so close it
took the same amount of time
as the entire matches of Ahn,
Gibbs, and Hardebeck.
The Cardinal has five
matches left in its homes
tand: Washington, Washing
ton State, Texas, Colorado
and Utah. The team's next
match is this Friday, March 8
at 1:30 p.m. against Wash
ington.

tion against the rival Golden
Bears.
"It was great clinching
the match," Hardebeck said.
"I've been struggling for the
past few weeks, and it's been
coming at a tough time for
my tennis. It was really im
portant to me to win a match
and help out my team. I was
so happy to be the one to fin
ish it off. I'm looking forward
to a lot more Stanford beat
downs of Cal."
Tsay closed a minute later
for a 6-2, 6-2 win that was
more difficult than the score
would suggest. Her doubles
partner Tan displayed an in
credible strength of will to

come back from a first set in
which she won zero games to
defeat Cal's Tayler Davis 0-6,
7-5, 6-0.
Cal took back one point
when Stanford freshman
Lindsey Kostas lost 7-6, 6-2
but only after competing in a
first-set that was so close it
took the same amount of time
as the entire matches of Ahn,
Gibbs, and Hardebeck.
The Cardinal has five
matches left in its homes
tand: Washington, Washing

and Utah. The team's next
match is this Friday, March 8

Freshman Krista Hardebeck (above) won the clinching match
at No. 3 singles as Stanford women's tennis beat rival Cal 6-1
in a non-conference matchup at home.
When Cal comes to town,
Stanford teams find a new level of
intensity in their play. It was no dif
ferent for the No. 26 women's ten
nis team (5-2) as it used a renewed
commitment to high-energy play
to achieve a 6-1 non-conference vic
tory over No. 9 Cal (5-4).

On Feb. 24, the team suffered
a tough 4-2 loss at the hands of
another big rival, the Florida
Gators, revealing a few key
changes that needed to be made.
"We're trying to up the intensity
for sure," said junior Nicole
Gibbs. "That's the baseline. We're
trying to be more organized with
our agenda each day when we go
out on the court. We're just trying
to get more physical as a team
and make sure we can outlast our
opponents on the court."
None of the women in the
Stanford lineup have ever experi
enced a loss to the Golden Bears.
The Cardinal has won its last sev
en matches against Cal dating
back to April 2009. Stanford will
meet Cal again, this time in Pac
-12 play, on April 19.
Stanford started the day off
well with another fine showing in
doubles. Juniors Rristie Ahn and
Gibbs defeated Cal's Lynn Chi
and Anett Schutting 8-4 and sen
ior Stacey Tan and sophomore
Ellen Tsay beat Cal's Kelly Chui
and Klara Fabikova by the same
score. This was a great sign for
Ahn and Gibbs as they have
struggled as a doubles pair over
the season.
"We started out the year with
me playing backhand, her at fore
hand," Ahn explained. "It wasn't

really clicking and we
thought about splitting up
our pair for a bit. Instead, we
just tried switching sides. We
tried it out. It's been working
great ever since, and it's al
ways fun to play with her."
In singles, Stanford
showed that California's
higher ranking meant little
to them as the home team
rattled off five straight Car
dinal points. The first off the
court was Ahn, who put to
gether a dominant 6-3, 6-2
win over a clearly struggling
Lynn Chi.
Less than five minutes
later, Gibbs recorded a 6-2,
6-2 win at the top spot over
No. 8 Schutting. While she
ran away with the first set,
there was a momentum
struggle at 2-2 in the second.
Schutting put up a strong
battle on Gibbs' serve, but
after several ad points,
Gibbs was able to hold serve
and run away with the next
four games.
"When I was feeling con
fident, I was hitting my fore
hand pretty well and hitting
her off the court pretty ef
fectively," Gibbs said. "But
there were patches when I
wasn't hitting as confident,
and I relied on my move
ment and waited for her to
make errors or give me a
short ball to work with."
"I've played her three
times, and I'm 3-0," Gibbs
continued. "That being said,
I've played pretty well the
three times we have come up
against each other. She's no
one I would underestimate,
and I was happy to get the
win."
Krista Hardebeck and
Tsay were both close to win
ning at this point, too close to
tell who would provide the
clinching victory for Stan
ford. It proved to be the
promising freshman Harde
beck, who left the court with

a challenging 6-3, 7-5 victory
that provided a needed victo
ry in her first team competi
tion against the rival Golden
Bears.
"It was great clinching
the match," Hardebeck said.
"I've been struggling for the
past few weeks, and it's been
coming at a tough time for
my tennis. It was really im
portant to me to win a match
and help out my team. I was
so happy to be the one to fin
ish it off. I'm looking forward
to a lot more Stanford beat
downs of Cal."
Tsay closed a minute later
for a 6-2, 6-2 win that was
more difficult than the score
would suggest. Her doubles

come back from a first set in
which she won zero games to
