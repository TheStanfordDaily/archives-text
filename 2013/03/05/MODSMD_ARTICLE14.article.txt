## 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's tennis
team found success this weekend
at the 124 th Annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships, with two
of the Cardinal's five doubles
teams advancing to the semifinals.
The tournament, which was
held at the La Jolla Beach and
Tennis Club, featured some of the
nation's best collegiate and inde
pendent players. Despite the stiff
competition, four of Stanford's
doubles teams made it past the
first round.
Sophomore John Morrissey
and senior Denis Lin, who play
No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal,
beat two independent teams and
pairs from Boston College, UNLV
and Cal to secure a spot in the
semifinal.
In the quarterfinals, Morrissey
and Lin beat the No. 1 seed in
their division, Campbell Johnson
and Christoffer Konigsfeldt from
Cal, 6-1, 6-1. They had previously
lost 8-4 to Johnson and Konigs
feldt at Cal on Feb. 24.
Morrissey said that the Feb. 24
match was the first time he and
Lin played as a doubles team. Ac
cording to Morrissey, the experi
ence that he and Lin gained as a
team, as well as the lessons they
learned from their loss to Konigs
feldt and Johnson at Cal, played a
role in their victory.
"We knew what strategies and
what plays we wanted to run
against them, and what their ten
dencies were," Morrissey said.
"That little bit of knowledge, plus
me and Dennis being more used to
playing together, made a big dif
ference this week."
In the semifinal, Lin and Mor
rissey fell to UCLA's No. 1 doubles
team in a close three-set match.
The UCLA duo went on to win the
tournament.
"We have a lot of confidence in
the way we've been playing over
the last few days, and we
knew we had the tennis to
win or make it close," Mor
rissey said. "We lost a tight
one against a good UCLA
team, but overall I think
there are a lot of positives to
take out of this weekend."
Sophomore Robert Stine
man and freshman Maciek
Romanowicz, who play No. 3
doubles for the Cardinal, de
feated three independent
teams and a team from
UCLA in the first four
rounds of competition. Stine
man and Romanowicz lost to
the No. 3 USC pair of Max
De Vroome and Eric John
son in the semifinals.
"It was a really good
bounce back to make a semi
final after the disappointing
loss at Cal at the start of the
season," Romanowicz said.
"I was not surprised because
I know that we are capable
of winning big matches, but I
feel really good about beat
ing teams from UCLA and
USC throughout the tourna
ment, which is really positive
for our upcoming matches."
Freshmen Nolan Paige
and Trey Strobel won their
first match against the No. 1
seed in their division, Stan
ford graduates KC Corkery
'O6 and Blake Muller 'O9.
Corkery was a three-time
Ail-American and NCAA
doubles semifinalist during
his time at Stanford, and
Muller was an ITA Regional
Doubles champion.
Paige and Strobel then
beat a team from UNLV to
make it to the round of 32,
where they fell 6-3, 6-3 to
Leif Berger and Jonathan
Chang from Rice.
Juniors Daniel Ho and
Jamin Ball, who play No. 2
doubles for the Cardinal,
made it to the round of 64
before suffering a 6-3, 7-5
defeat to an independent

team.
The fifth Stanford team
to play in the tournament
was freshman Anthony
Tsodikov and assistant coach
Brandon Coupe, who lost in
the first round to Michael
Grant and Johnny Wang of
USC. Tsodikov and Coupe
made it to the third round of
the consolations before
falling to Francis Alcantara
and Finn Tearney from Pep
per dine.
The No. 41 Cardinal is
headed back into dual
matches this week, with a
non-conference match at
home against Furman, an
unranked team from
Greenville, S.C. Four dou
bles teams from Furman
competed in the Pacific
Coast Doubles Champi
onship, though none made it

past the round of 64.
After suffering four
straight losses, the Cardinal
is hoping to improve its 3-5
record with a victory against
Furman at home on Thurs
day. Morrissey said that the
team will be working on sin
gles this week to "keep
things sharp" before the
match.
"I expect Furman to
come at it all guns blazing, as
every college does," Morris
sey said. "I expect our guys
to be really pumped and
ready to go. I think this
weekend a lot of guys got a
lot of confidence, so we're
going to be ready to go and
hopefully put in a big per
formance."

semifinals of the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships.
The Stanford men's tennis
team found success this weekend
at the 124 th Annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships, with two
of the Cardinal's five doubles
teams advancing to the semifinals.
The tournament, which was
held at the La Jolla Beach and
Tennis Club, featured some of the
nation's best collegiate and inde
pendent players. Despite the stiff
competition, four of Stanford's
doubles teams made it past the
first round.
Sophomore John Morrissey
and senior Denis Lin, who play
No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal,
beat two independent teams and
pairs from Boston College, UNLV
and Cal to secure a spot in the
semifinal.
In the quarterfinals, Morrissey
and Lin beat the No. 1 seed in
their division, Campbell Johnson
and Christoffer Konigsfeldt from
Cal, 6-1, 6-1. They had previously
lost 8-4 to Johnson and Konigs
feldt at Cal on Feb. 24.
Morrissey said that the Feb. 24
match was the first time he and
Lin played as a doubles team. Ac
cording to Morrissey, the experi
ence that he and Lin gained as a
team, as well as the lessons they
learned from their loss to Konigs
feldt and Johnson at Cal, played a
role in their victory.
"We knew what strategies and
what plays we wanted to run
against them, and what their ten
dencies were," Morrissey said.
"That little bit of knowledge, plus
me and Dennis being more used to
playing together, made a big dif
ference this week."
In the semifinal, Lin and Mor
rissey fell to UCLA's No. 1 doubles
team in a close three-set match.
The UCLA duo went on to win the
tournament.
"We have a lot of confidence in
the way we've been playing over
the last few days, and we
knew we had the tennis to
win or make it close," Mor
rissey said. "We lost a tight
one against a good UCLA
team, but overall I think
there are a lot of positives to
take out of this weekend."
Sophomore Robert Stine
man and freshman Maciek
Romanowicz, who play No. 3
doubles for the Cardinal, de
feated three independent
teams and a team from
UCLA in the first four
rounds of competition. Stine
man and Romanowicz lost to
the No. 3 USC pair of Max
De Vroome and Eric John
son in the semifinals.
"It was a really good
bounce back to make a semi
final after the disappointing
loss at Cal at the start of the
season," Romanowicz said.
"I was not surprised because
I know that we are capable
of winning big matches, but I
feel really good about beat
ing teams from UCLA and
USC throughout the tourna
ment, which is really positive
for our upcoming matches."
Freshmen Nolan Paige
and Trey Strobel won their
first match against the No. 1
seed in their division, Stan
ford graduates KC Corkery
'O6 and Blake Muller 'O9.
Corkery was a three-time
Ail-American and NCAA
doubles semifinalist during
his time at Stanford, and
Muller was an ITA Regional
Doubles champion.
Paige and Strobel then
beat a team from UNLV to
make it to the round of 32,
where they fell 6-3, 6-3 to
Leif Berger and Jonathan
Chang from Rice.
Juniors Daniel Ho and
Jamin Ball, who play No. 2
doubles for the Cardinal,
made it to the round of 64
before suffering a 6-3, 7-5
defeat to an independent

team.
The fifth Stanford team
to play in the tournament
was freshman Anthony
Tsodikov and assistant coach
Brandon Coupe, who lost in
the first round to Michael
Grant and Johnny Wang of
USC. Tsodikov and Coupe
made it to the third round of
the consolations before
falling to Francis Alcantara
and Finn Tearney from Pep
per dine.
The No. 41 Cardinal is
headed back into dual
matches this week, with a
non-conference match at
home against Furman, an
unranked team from
Greenville, S.C. Four dou
bles teams from Furman
competed in the Pacific
Coast Doubles Champi
onship, though none made it

past the round of 64.
After suffering four
straight losses, the Cardinal
is hoping to improve its 3-5
record with a victory against
Furman at home on Thurs
day. Morrissey said that the
team will be working on sin
gles this week to "keep
things sharp" before the
match.
"I expect Furman to
come at it all guns blazing, as
every college does," Morris
sey said. "I expect our guys
to be really pumped and
ready to go. I think this
weekend a lot of guys got a
lot of confidence, so we're
going to be ready to go and
hopefully put in a big per
formance."
