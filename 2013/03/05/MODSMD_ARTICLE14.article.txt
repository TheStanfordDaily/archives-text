### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's tennis
team found success this weekend
at the 124 th Annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships, with two
of the Cardinal's five doubles
teams advancing to the semifinals.
The tournament, which was
held at the La Jolla Beach and
Tennis Club, featured some of the
nation's best collegiate and inde

competition, four of Stanford's
doubles teams made it past the
first round.
Sophomore John Morrissey
and senior Denis Lin, who play
No. 1 doubles for the Cardinal,
beat two independent teams and

and Cal to secure a spot in the
semifinal.
In the quarterfinals, Morrissey
and Lin beat the No. 1 seed in
their division, Campbell Johnson
and Christoffer Konigsfeldt from
Cal, 6-1, 6-1. They had previously
lost 8-4 to Johnson and Konigs
feldt at Cal on Feb. 24.
Morrissey said that the Feb. 24
match was the first time he and
Lin played as a doubles team. Ac

team, as well as the lessons they
learned from their loss to Konigs
feldt and Johnson at Cal, played a
role in their victory.
"We knew what strategies and

against them, and what their ten

"That little bit of knowledge, plus
me and Dennis being more used to
playing together, made a big dif

In the semifinal, Lin and Mor
rissey fell to UCLA's No. 1 doubles
team in a close three-set match.
The UCLA duo went on to win the
tournament.

the way we've been playing over
