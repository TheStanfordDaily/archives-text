# Offense explodes for Card softball
## 
### DAVID COHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming into the Easton Invita
tional, No. 5 Stanford Softball's
season had been defined by incred
ible starting pitching, highlighted
by a perfect game and a 46-inning
streak without allowing a single
run. While the pitching was solid
over the final two days of the invi
tational, it was Stanford's offense
that propelled the Cardinal (17-5)
to a successful weekend in Fuller
ton, Calif.
Stanford's bats exploded dur
ing the three-day tournament, as
the Card tallied 32 runs and hit
.318 over the course of five games.
The team's best offensive display
came on Saturday morning against

Cal State-Fullerton, when the Car
dinal notched 14 hits in routing the
Titans 14-1; six Stanford players
recorded at least two hits in the
five-inning mercy-rule victory.

Senior Jenna Rich had a fabu
lous weekend at the plate, as the
shortstop from El Segundo, Calif.,
hit .333 while registering 6 RBIs.
In a 7-6 loss to lowa on Friday af
ternoon, Rich went 3-for-3 and
logged the first of her three multi-
RBI games during the invitational.
