# Offense explodes for Card softball
## 
### DAVID COHN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming into the Easton Invita
tional, No. 5 Stanford Softball's
season had been defined by incred
ible starting pitching, highlighted
by a perfect game and a 46-inning
streak without allowing a single
run. While the pitching was solid
over the final two days of the invi
tational, it was Stanford's offense
that propelled the Cardinal (17-5)
to a successful weekend in Fuller
ton, Calif.
Stanford's bats exploded dur
ing the three-day tournament, as
the Card tallied 32 runs and hit
.318 over the course of five games.
The team's best offensive display
came on Saturday morning against

Cal State-Fullerton, when the Car
dinal notched 14 hits in routing the
Titans 14-1; six Stanford players
recorded at least two hits in the
five-inning mercy-rule victory.

Senior Jenna Rich had a fabu
lous weekend at the plate, as the
shortstop from El Segundo, Calif.,
hit .333 while registering 6 RBIs.
In a 7-6 loss to lowa on Friday af
ternoon, Rich went 3-for-3 and
logged the first of her three multi-
RBI games during the invitational.

Senior Jenna Rich (above) had three multi-RBI games and a home
run to lead the Cardinal as Stanford Softball bounced back from two
Friday losses to win its final three games at the Easton Invitational.
Rich gave Stanford an
early 1-0 lead in the bottom
of the first inning with a two
out double. After a walk in
the third inning and a single
in the fourth, Rich's one-out
single in the sixth inning
scored Hanna Winter, cut
ting the deficit to one. Ulti
mately though, the comeback
would fall just short.
A now four-year starter

for the Cardinal who has ap
peared at shortstop, second
base, pitcher and designated
player throughout her Stan
ford career, Rich has been
Stanford's most dangerous
power hitter since her fresh
man season, leading the team
in home runs and RBIs in
each of the last three years.
That trend continued at
the Easton Invitational; in
addition to six RBIs in five
games, the NFCA All-Amer
ican also belted her third
home run of the season on
Sunday morning to open the
scoring against Indiana.

Rich's leadoff shot in the sec
ond inning jump-started the
Stanford bats, as the Card
would pound 10 hits in the
contests to pummel the
Hoosiers 7-0. Rich now leads
the team with 19 RBIs and
15 walks.
Sophomore Erin Ashby
also helped key the potent of
fensive attack, as the La
Crescenta, Calif., product
batted .375 and drove in four
runs. In her first year as a
full-time starter, Ashby has
been a stabilizing presence
for Stanford, and her versa
tility has allowed her to split

time at both catcher and first
base.
On Saturday against
Fullerton, Ashby emphatical
ly put the Cardinal on the
scoreboard in the top of the
second inning with a two-ran
blast to left field. In the next
inning, Ashby followed up
her home ran with a one-out
double to right field that plat
ed her third RBI of the
game. After driving in only
one run last year, mostly as a
pinch hitter, Ashby already
has 12 RBIs on the young
season.
After dominating oppos
ing hitters in the previous
three tournaments, Stanford
pitchers struggled on Day
One of the Easton Invitation
al. In the opener against
lowa, freshman Kelsey
Stevens gave up five earned
runs in only 1 1/3 innings of
work.

But Stevens, who was last
week's NFCA National Play
er of the Week for her flaw

less showing at the Mary
Nutter Collegiate Classic, re
bounded from the rare loss to
shut down Northwestern on
Saturday afternoon. The
freshman struck out nine
Wildcat batters while yield
ing only four hits and two
runs in picking up her ninth
win of the season, a 5-2 victo
ry for Stanford.
Teagan Gerhart also lost
her first start of the Easton
Invitational on Friday after
noon against Wisconsin; even
though Gerhart allowed only
one earned run, three errors
by a normally sure-handed
Stanford infield doomed the
Cardinal, as the unranked
Badgers dropped the Card
by a score of 4-0.
However, like Stevens,
Gerhart would not be denied
a victory for long. In her next
two starts against Cal State-
Fullerton and Indiana, Ger
hart sent a resounding mes
sage in reaffirming her place
among the elite pitchers in

the Pac-12, as she conceded a
mere four hits and one run in
the two games combined.
Stanford Softball returns
to action on Wednesday when
the Cardinal will travel to
Davis, Calif., to take on UC-
Davis. Stanford will also host
its second tournament of the
season, the Stanford
Louisville Slugger Classic,
this weekend. The tourna
ment begins on Friday with
games against Minnesota
and Florida Gulf Coast at
12:15 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. re
spectively.
The Classic will continue
on Saturday with two more
contests against Minnesota
and Florida Gulf Coast at
2:30 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. Stan
ford's tournament concludes
on Sunday with a matchup
against Pacific at 12:15 p.m.
All games will be played at
Smith Family Stadium.
