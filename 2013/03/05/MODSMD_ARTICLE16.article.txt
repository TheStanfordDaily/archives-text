## NOTES FROM THE MOTHERLAND Holding Stanford Accountable: Ethical Investment in Palestine 
### Kristian Davis Bailey 
F I ihis evening, Riesday, Stanford
I Students for Palestinian Equal
-1. Rights (of which I am a mem
ber) gave a presentation on the topic
of ethical investment in Palestine, as
well as a draft bill. Tonight, the Under
graduate Senate is likely to vote on
that bill.
SPER is pursuing a criteria-based,
ethical investment campaign focused
on multinational companies which vio
late human rights and humanitarian
law in Palestine. The campaign has
support from the Asian American Stu
dents' Association, Black Student
Union, La Familia, MEChA, Muslim
Student Awareness Network,
NAACI? National Lawyers Guild, Oc
cupy Stanford, Stanford Asian Ameri
can Activism Committee, Stanford
Friends of Tibet, Stanford Immigrant
Rights Project, Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation and Stanford Says
No to War.
We target Stanford's $l7 billion en
dowment — the fourth largest of any
American educational institution. The
University allegedly maintains a com
mitment to ethical investment, where
in "when the Trustees determine that
the corporate policies or practices of a
company Stanford may invest in could
cause substantial social injury they as
responsible and ethical investors, shall
give independent weight to this factor
in determining Investment Responsi
bility Policies and Proxy Voting Guide
lines for corporate securities."
Our bill calls for the Board of
Trustees to use four criteria for decid
ing whether to invest with a particular
company: 1) Does the company facili
tate acts of collective punishment? 2)
Does the company operate in Israeli
only settlements in the West Bank
(the existence of which the UN and
the United States recognize as ille
gal)? 3) Does the company construct
or maintain the "separation barrier"
that annexes Palestinian land in the
West Bank (similarly illegal under in
ternational law)? 4) Does the company
engage in practices that institutionally
discriminate against individuals or
groups?
If the answer to any of these ques
tions is "yes," then Stanford should
take its money out of the offending
companies.
We have identified eight specific
companies that definitively violate
these criteria and call for divestment
from: (Criteria 1) Caterpillar and
Lockheed Martin; (Criteria 2) Ahava
Dead Sea Laboratories and Motorola;
(Criteria 3) Riwal and Cement Road
stone Holdings) and (Criteria 4) Veolia
and Mekorot Water Company
While the administration has not
confirmed whether the University has
investments in any of these compa
nies, they have stated that with such a
large endowment, we should expect
that Stanford has investments in
everything.
If the University finds that the en
dowment is not invested in these com
panies, we will feel undoubtedly re
lieved. In fact, our bill will simply call
for the Board to keep it that way
It is standard that we do not do
business with human rights violators
nor do we invest heavily in regions
where conflict is taking place; sanc
tions are often put in place in order to
heed this legal and moral weight.
The status quo of our University
endowment does no such thing.
Ethical investment not only puts
the University in line with internation
al la\y it also holds the University ac
countable to its own standards of re

sponsible and ethical investment and
founding grant to promote the public
welfare.
So we focus on human rights viola
tions in Palestine because of the inex
tricable link between injustice in the
Occupied Territories and injustice in
the rest of the world.
To reiterate, current University
actions (not divesting and maintaining
the status quo) are out of line with its
own policy.
It is time to hold the University ac
countable.
Regardless and I emphasize re
gardless— of what narratives one
subscribes to about Palestine and Is
rael, regardless of whether people
don't know much about what's going
on, don't care or think it's too divisive,
I ask one very simple question:
Why should we invest in compa
nies that we know cause social harm
and violate the most sacrosanct of hu
man rights?
Until someone can answer this
question, our collective action as a
campus must be to divest.
Do we otherwise want the Stan
ford name to be associated with com
panies that discriminate based on reli
gion, nationality or ethnicity?
Does it fall in line with our Univer
sity's values to illegally demolish
25,000 homes, to displace 160,000 peo
ple and leave them homeless?
Do we want to invest in corpora
tions that operate in settlements that
our own government has acknowl
edged are illegal and present a grave
obstacle to peace in the Middle East?
Please show me where in our Uni
versity's documents it indicates that
investing in any of these companies
aligns with our values and goals, and
I'll be quiet.
If we can tackle the largest exam
ple of unethical investments, we will
pave an easy way for ethical invest
ment oversight in other conflicts and
enterprises (e.g. the private prison in
dustry in the United States, the Fil
ipino dispossession of the Tausag, the
Thai dispossession of the Rohingya).
There is no better place to do this
than the ASSU Senate. The Universi
ty will continue to ignore our voices if
all we are doing is writing columns and
signing petitions as individuals, or
even as student groups.
While our actions are not going to
make this regional conflict in the Mid
dle East disappear, that does not ab
solve us from our responsibility not to
be complicit in internationally docu
mented and recognized violence, dis
crimination and oppression.
At the very least we must do no
harm.
The Senate plays a critical role in
moving ethical investment closer to
fruition.
People have expressed concern that
the Board won't actually reconsider its
investments, but if the trustees can't
confirm the support of the student
body through the voice of the Senate,
then the trustees will mostly likely not
be moved to take action.
Whether we get another 1,000,
2,000, 5,000 signatories, the Senate's
influence and importance plays a cru
cial role in affecting University policy.
The Senate vote would represent a
benchmark victory and move us a lot
closer to ending University complicity.
Let's not stand by idly and let the
administration mollify us; let's speak
loudly and let our actions speak even
louder.
