## Why I Support the Call for Stanford University to Divest From the Israeli Occupation

University (ASSU)
Nelson Mandela once said: "We
can easily be enticed to read
reconciliation and fairness as
meaning parity between justice and in
justice. Having achieved our own
freedom, we can fall into the trap of
washing our hands of difficulties that
others face. Yet we would be less than
human if we did so. It behooves all
South Africans, themselves erstwhile
beneficiaries of generous internation
al support, to stand up and be count
ed among those contributing actively
to the cause of freedom and justice."
This is exactly why I see it as my
moral obligation to stand up for
Palestinian rights and to support
Palestinian civil society's nonviolent
efforts to gain freedom, justice and
equality.
Struggles for freedom and justice
are fraught with huge moral dilem
mas. How can we commit ourselves
to virtue before its political tri
umph â€”when such commitment may
lead to ostracism from our political al
lies and even our closest partners and
friends? Are we willing to speak out
for justice when the moral choice that
we make for an oppressed community
may invite phone calls from the pow
erful or when possible research fund
ing will be withdrawn from us? When
we say "Never again," do we truly
mean "never again" or do we mean
"never again to us"?
It is always inspiring when young
people inspire the rest of us and lead
the way in promoting international
law and human rights for all humans.
I have supported several U.S. cam
pus campaigns to divest University
money from companies that enable
and profit from the injustice of the Is
raeli occupation of Palestinian land
and violation of Palestinian human
rights.
Principled stands like this, sup
ported by a fast-growing number of
U.S. civil society organizations and
people of conscience, including
prominent Jewish groups, are essen
tial for a better world in the making.
Based on the same principles, I sup-

port the call for Stanford University
to divest from companies implicated
in Israel's brutal occupation and hu
man rights violations.
No matter what detractors may al
lege, students pushing for divestment
are doing the right thing. They are do
ing the moral thing. They are doing
that which is incumbent on them as
humans who believe that all people
have dignity and rights, and that all
those being denied their dignity and
rights deserve the solidarity and sup
port of their fellow human beings.
I have visited the Occupied Pales
tinian Territories, and I have wit
nessed the racially-segregated roads
and housing that reminded me so
much of the conditions we experi
enced in South Africa under the
racist system of Apartheid. I have
witnessed the humiliation of Palestin
ian men, women and children made to
wait hours at Israeli military check
points routinely when trying to make
the most basic of trips to visit rela
tives or attend school or college, and
this humiliation is familiar to me and
the many black South Africans who
were corralled and regularly insulted
by the security forces of the
Apartheid government.
In South Africa, we could not have
achieved our freedom and just peace
without the help of people around the
world, who through the use of nonvi
olent means including boycotts
and divestment encouraged their
governments and other corporate ac
tors to reverse decades-long support
for the Apartheid regime. Students
played a leading role in that struggle,

and as I write these words of encour
agement for student divestment ef
forts, I am well aware that it was stu
dents, including Stanford students,
who played a pioneering role in advo
cating for equality in South Africa
and promoting corporate ethical and
social responsibility to end complicity
in Apartheid.
The same issue of equality is what
motivates today's divestment move
ment, which tries to end Israel's 45-
year-long occupation and the unequal
treatment of the Palestinian people
by the Israeli government ruling over
them. The abuses they face are real,
and no person should be offended by
principled, morally consistent, nonvi
olent acts to oppose them. It is no
more wrong to call out Israel in par
ticular for its abuses than it was to
call out the Apartheid regime in
South Africa in particular for its
abuses.
To those who wrongly allege un
fairness or harm done to them by this
call for divestment, I suggest, with
humility, that the harm suffered from
being confronted with opinions that
challenge one's own pales in compari
son to the harm done by living a life
under occupation and the daily denial
of basic rights and dignity.
It is not with rancor that we criti
cize the Israeli government and call
for divesting from its human rights
violations but with hope a hope
that a better and more peaceful fii
ture can be made for both Israelis
and Palestinians.
Time peace must be anchored in
justice and an unwavering commit
ment to universal rights for all hu
mans, regardless of ethnicity, reli
gion, gender, national origin or any
other identity attribute.
These students advocating today
for divestment from Israel's occupa
tion are helping to pave that path to a
just peace. I heartily endorse their di
vestment move, encourage them to
stand firm on the side of what is right
and urge others to follow their lead.
