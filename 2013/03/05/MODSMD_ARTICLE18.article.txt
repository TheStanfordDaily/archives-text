# The
						Power of Uselessness
## 
### Taylor Brady 
Inspiration strikes at inconven
ient times. In the short term, it
is profoundly useless.
Most recently, I was struck by it
in the earthquake engineering cen
ter on Wednesday evening. We'd
been informed the week before that
this concrete design problem set
was going to be the hardest of the
quarter. This being one of the hard
er courses that I've taken here, I de
cided to start working the preceding
Saturday.
I thought that I had a pretty
good start. Yet there I was, the
evening before my problem set was
due, 1.5 problems and five hours
away from finishing. And I still had
a grant application to compose af
terward.
Buzzing. That's the best way to
describe the Blume Center during
office hours the night before a prob
lem set is due. It is hectic and stress
ful. Students chatter nervously, fig

uring out how to prevent the imagi
nary structure on the page from
falling down. We joke about our pro
fessors, how they're probably
soundly asleep already. Their smug
smiles will mock us when we lumber
in the next morning, bag-eyed and
defeated, to turn in ten pages of cal
culations. A long-running joke is
that we should make it a department
requirement that professors stay up
as late as we do. Barring that, find
their address and a bullhorn.
These are people that I have
known for three or four years. We've
spent nights at each other's houses,
eaten tacos together on the beach,
struggled through sixteen-hour
problem sets and laughed when
we've finished. I've seen them in
compromising situations of the
frowned-upon Facebook photos sort,
but the most compromising of all, I
am sure, is this evening, when
they're in sweatpants (I don't wear
sweatpants), when we're collapsing
on the table, when the only thing
that we want in the world is to sleep,
but the prospect of a blemish on our
transcripts lashes us like bridled
stallions, gasping, through the
night.

I get up. I can't be here. I can't
focus.

"I like how even though Taylor
has a pencil sharpener, he always
polishes off the point with his knife.
I like Taylor's knives," one class
mate observes as I walk down the
stairs. "And" he's taken aback
"his cigarettes, apparently."
Near Blume Center, right behind
Memorial Church, I settled at the
fountain and sucked ash into my
lungs. Showering into the pool be
hind, the water rang quite pleasant
ly. Then something cut through the
babble of droplets: a low monotone
buzz. I climbed the back wall of the
fountain to investigate. I listened to
the motor running the pump, draw
ing water through the drain, up the
pipes and back into the pool whence
it came. When I dropped down again
from the wall erected specifically to
block the sound of that motor, I
could almost enjoy the fountain's
trickle melodic-like chimes. Almost.
But I could still hear the buzz. I
thought about the gas that it was
burning to run, the carbon and ni
trogen oxides that it was choking in
to the air â€”just as harmful as any
thing I was inhaling from the cancer
stick. My impression of that foun
tain was permanently drowned out
by the ugly whirr of the motor that
ran it. Of what made it useful. What

was worse, somebody had specifical
ly constructed that wall in order to
block the sound. They measured the
decibel level at three feet from the
motor running in its steel box and
selected blocks large enough to re
flect or absorb almost all of those
sound waves so that somebody on
the other side wouldn't give second
thought to what it was, exactly, that
made their nice music possible.
They'd just listen to the concert.
The roar of familiar voices
washed out the door as soon as I re
turned to the Blume Center. I enjoy
listening to my friends, but all that I
could hear that night was the buzz of
stress, whirring behind their fa
cades. Now that I've heard it, I can
never forget.
I had to stop that night and
write. For two hours, I feverishly
scrawled across sheet after sheet of
blank, white paper. Thoughts had
struck me at that fountain with ab
solute clarity, and I had to organize
them, parcel them into prayers to
atone for the sin of living for any
thing besides what I love.
Those words are of no use, at
least for now, to anybody but me.
Nobody would give me a job for
such activity, although they would
for the knowledge in the problem

set that I neglected to finish until
three in the morning. Yet I became
at peace with that fact when I re
called a line from Zhuangzi, a
philosopher that I love: "The moun
tain tree plunders itself. The candle
fat scorches itself. The cinnamon
tree is edible, and thus it gets
chopped down. The lacquer tree is
useful, and thus it is cut down."
I'd really prefer it if Stanford
would turn off its fountains. They
accelerate increases in entropy, they
pollute the local atmosphere and
they shatter drop by drop the mir
rored pools in which we might re
flect upon ourselves were they let
alone.
Here's my challenge for the
week: do something useless. What
ever it is that inspires you, don't lose
its signal in the interfering static, in
the waves of the fountain. Especial
ly as we near exams, take time to
write about your struggle in medias
res, instead of staying preoccupied
with transcripts and with conclu
sions.
"Everyone knows how useful
usefulness is, but no one seems to
know how useful uselessness is."
