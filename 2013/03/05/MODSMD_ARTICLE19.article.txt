### ANDERS MIKKELSEN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford men's volleyball
pulled out two dramatic five
set victories against No. 5
Pepperdine and No. 13 USC
this weekend to avenge early
season losses and establish it
self as one of the toughest
teams in the MPSF.

On Saturday night, No. 4
Stanford (12-6, 9-6 MPSF)
took on Pepperdine (9-6, 9-6)
in a rematch of their early
season matchup, which the
Waves won 3-1 in Malibu.
Junior outside hitter
Steven Irvin started the
match with a kill and Stanford
did not relinquish that lead,
taking the first set 25-17.
Stanford continued its
strong play going into the sec
ond. With the Cardinal up 8-5,
however, the Waves came
back strong, uncorking a 7-2
run. Despite a small rally
from the Cardinal, Pepper
dine won the set 25-20.
In the third set, it was
Stanford that stormed back
after falling behind. A block
from freshman setter James
Shaw and junior middle block
er Denny Falls would give
Stanford its first lead of the set
at 23-22 before Irvin put the
Waves away with back-to
back kills.
The fourth set was again

extremely tight. Up 22-19,
Pepperdine seemed to be in
control before Stanford oppo
site hitter Brian Cook took
over. The junior unleashed
three powerful kills, tying the
match back up at 22. The
Waves countered, though, to
pull out the 25-23 victory.
Stanford held a slight lead
for the entirety of the final set
on Saturday. With the Card
holding a 14-11 lead, Pepper
dine countered with two
straight points, but Stanford

secured the match after a
Pepperdine service error.
Cook had another tremen
dous game, with 24 kills on .476
hitting. Both junior middle
blockers had strong games, as
Eric Mochalski chipped in five
blocks and nine kills and hit
.667 while Denny Falls had
eight kills and four blocks.
The Stanford defense, an
chored by redshirt junior
libero Grant Delgado, held
the Waves to just .277 hitting.
Delgado led the match with 12

digs, the majority of which
were extraordinary saves. The
Cardinal was also strong at the
net, tallying 21 blocks.
Delgado credited a new
found mindset for the team's
ability to pull out the victory.
"We focused on small goals
rather than big picture," Del
gado said. 'As a result, we
found out what we have to
work on and learned how to fo
cus the energy and fire within
ourselves."
On Sunday night, the Car

dinal faced USC (4-9, 4-9) in
what would turn out to be a
dogfight on and off the court.
Stanford ultimately beat the
Trojans for the first time in six
meetings between the teams.
"It's always a battle," Stan
ford head coach John Kosty
said. "It really started six or
seven years ago and it hasn't
subsided."
The Trojans started quick
ly, cruising to an early 104
lead. The Cardinal then slowly
chipped away at the Trojan
lead to tie the game at 18. Both
teams went back-and-forth,
with Stanford saving three
straight USC set points before
finally falling 28-26.
The second set was rela
tively even until Stanford
pulled away with a dominant 8-
1 run, during which the Trojans
noticeably expressed frustra
tion to the referees.
With Stanford up 21-16,
Delgado made one of the most
impressive plays of his career,
diving to save a ball and watch
ing it drift over the net for the
kill. The Cardinal was also
helped by USC's temper, as
Stanford received a point
when the Trojan libero earned
a yellow card.
After Stanford took the
second set 25-17, USC re
sponded with a dominant
third set. The Trojans led
from the start and won 25-18.
The fourth seemed to be
more of the same, as USC
edged in front 14-10. Howev
er, the Cardinal roared back
with a 10-1 run that shifted
momentum. Stanford won the

set 25-21 to enter a fifth set
once again.
The Cardinal began the
decisive fifth set with an 8-2
run, putting the match all but
out of reach for the Trojans.
Stanford would ultimately
take the set 15-10 to win the
match.
Throughout the set, Tro
jans players repeatedly shout
ed at fans and yelled during
Stanford serves.
Cook had another strong
game for the Cardinal, with 20
kills on .326 hitting, nine digs,
four aces and six blocks, while
Irvin pitched in 12 kills. The
middle blocker tandem was
again dominant, with Mochal
ski displaying his athleticism
on a number of powerful kills
and blocks. He would finish
with eight kills on .333 hitting,
two aces and six blocks, while
Falls added seven kills and
five blocks.
Shaw put up an impressive
double-double, with 48 assists
and 10 digs, while Delgado
chipped in eight assists and
one incredible kill to anchor
the defense.
"They were two very im
portant wins, and while they
weren't pretty, hopefully they
can spark some momentum
going into the second half of
the season," Cook said.
Next week, Stanford is
back on the road against UC
Santa Barbara and UCLA.
The Cardinal beat both teams
at Maples earlier this season.

back strong, uncorking a 7-2
run. Despite a small rally
from the Cardinal, Pepper
dine won the set 25-20.
In the third set, it was
Stanford that stormed back
after falling behind. A block
from freshman setter James
Shaw and junior middle block
er Denny Falls would give
Stanford its first lead of the set
at 23-22 before Irvin put the
Waves away with back-to
back kills.
The fourth set was again

extremely tight. Up 22-19,
Pepperdine seemed to be in
control before Stanford oppo
site hitter Brian Cook took
over. The junior unleashed
three powerful kills, tying the
match back up at 22. The
Waves countered, though, to
pull out the 25-23 victory.
Stanford held a slight lead
for the entirety of the final set
on Saturday. With the Card
holding a 14-11 lead, Pepper
dine countered with two
straight points, but Stanford

secured the match after a
Pepperdine service error.
Cook had another tremen
dous game, with 24 kills on .476
hitting. Both junior middle
blockers had strong games, as
Eric Mochalski chipped in five
blocks and nine kills and hit
.667 while Denny Falls had
eight kills and four blocks.
The Stanford defense, an
chored by redshirt junior
libero Grant Delgado, held
the Waves to just .277 hitting.
Delgado led the match with 12

digs, the majority of which
were extraordinary saves. The
Cardinal was also strong at the
net, tallying 21 blocks.
Delgado credited a new
found mindset for the team's
ability to pull out the victory.
"We focused on small goals
rather than big picture," Del
gado said. 'As a result, we
found out what we have to
work on and learned how to fo
cus the energy and fire within
ourselves."
On Sunday night, the Car

dinal faced USC (4-9, 4-9) in
what would turn out to be a
dogfight on and off the court.
Stanford ultimately beat the
Trojans for the first time in six
meetings between the teams.
"It's always a battle," Stan
ford head coach John Kosty
said. "It really started six or
seven years ago and it hasn't
subsided."
The Trojans started quick
ly, cruising to an early 104
lead. The Cardinal then slowly
chipped away at the Trojan
lead to tie the game at 18. Both
teams went back-and-forth,
with Stanford saving three
straight USC set points before
finally falling 28-26.
The second set was rela
tively even until Stanford
pulled away with a dominant 8-
1 run, during which the Trojans
noticeably expressed frustra
tion to the referees.
With Stanford up 21-16,
Delgado made one of the most
impressive plays of his career,
diving to save a ball and watch
ing it drift over the net for the
kill. The Cardinal was also
helped by USC's temper, as
Stanford received a point
when the Trojan libero earned
a yellow card.
After Stanford took the
second set 25-17, USC re
sponded with a dominant
third set. The Trojans led
from the start and won 25-18.
The fourth seemed to be
more of the same, as USC
edged in front 14-10. Howev
er, the Cardinal roared back
with a 10-1 run that shifted
momentum. Stanford won the

set 25-21 to enter a fifth set
once again.
The Cardinal began the
decisive fifth set with an 8-2
run, putting the match all but
out of reach for the Trojans.
Stanford would ultimately
take the set 15-10 to win the
match.
Throughout the set, Tro
jans players repeatedly shout
ed at fans and yelled during
Stanford serves.
Cook had another strong
game for the Cardinal, with 20
kills on .326 hitting, nine digs,
four aces and six blocks, while
Irvin pitched in 12 kills. The
middle blocker tandem was
again dominant, with Mochal
ski displaying his athleticism
on a number of powerful kills
and blocks. He would finish
with eight kills on .333 hitting,
two aces and six blocks, while
Falls added seven kills and
five blocks.
Shaw put up an impressive
double-double, with 48 assists
and 10 digs, while Delgado
chipped in eight assists and
one incredible kill to anchor
the defense.
"They were two very im
portant wins, and while they
weren't pretty, hopefully they
can spark some momentum
going into the second half of
the season," Cook said.
Next week, Stanford is
back on the road against UC
Santa Barbara and UCLA.
The Cardinal beat both teams
at Maples earlier this season.
