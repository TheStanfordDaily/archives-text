## she++ documentary earns national buzz 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Ayna Agarwal 'l4 and Ellora Is
rani 'l4 enrolled at Stanford, studying com
puter science was the furthest thing from
their minds.
"Even though I grew up in Silicon Val
ley, I never thought computer science was
for me, because I never saw anyone who
looked like me doing it," Israni said.
After taking introductory computer sci
ence classes, however, Agarwal and Israni
were hooked. In April 2012, they hosted
she+ + , Stanford's first conference for
women in technology, with 11 female
speakers from companies including Drop
box, Google and Pinterest.
Since then, she+ + has grown exponen
tially developing into a nationwide commu
nity that has been featured in Forbes,
Tech Crunch and The Huffington Post. This
spring, she+ + will release a documentary
launch a mentorship program and host its
second annual conference, which will be
free for Stanford and high school students.

"We're really trying to show you what it
means to be a woman in technology" Israni
said.
The 12-minute documentary which in
cludes interviews with Stanford students,
alumni and professors, will be released on
April 1, and Agarwal and Israni will host a
special screening at Cubberley Auditorium
on April 3. The film's trailer, which was up
loaded to YouTßbe two weeks ago, has col
lected more than 15,000 views.
Agarwal and Israni said that they had
been inspired to produce the documentary
after noticing a trend in the demographics
of their upper-level computer science
courses.
"We saw that in the progression of com
puter science classes, the number of
women really decreased," Agarwal said.
"We wondered why there was no conversa
tion about this."

in the field of computer sci
ence, including Jocelyn Gold
fein '97, Facebook's director
of engineering, Sandy Jen 'O3,
a co-founder and the Chief
Technology Officer of Meebo,
and Shubha Nabar M.S. 'O5
Ph.D. 'OB, a senior data scien
tist at Linkedln.
Sophia Westwood 'l3, a
computer science major who
was featured in the documen
tary, said that many young
women avoid computer sci
ence because they mistakenly
believe that it is "not veiy so
cial, not very creative and not
the most exciting."
Westwood said that these
misconceptions are harmful,
as they prevent parity in the
field and exclude women from
the opportunity to learn a skill
that is becoming crucial in to
day's technology-based world.
"Being able to code is be
coming similar- to having the
ability to read or write," West
wood said. "Everybody needs
to have a voice in shaping
technology, and the way you
have a voice is by having a
computer science back
ground."
To incorporate male per
spectives on the topic, Agarw
al and Israni interviewed Pro
fessor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts and Keith
Schwarz 'll M.S. 'll, a lectur
er in the computer science de
partment.
Roberts commented that
he has personally seen the
"barriers to women entering
computer science" at Stan
ford. According to Roberts,
while CSIO6A has near gen
der parity, women often take
the class later in then- Stan
ford careers, when they may
have already decided on a
course of study and will
therefore be less likely to pur
sue a degree in computer sci
ence.
While Israni and Agarwal
hope to inspire more female
students at Stanford to study
computer science, they have

also reached out to women of
all ages across the country. In
what Agarwal referred to as a
"call to action" at the end of
the documentary, viewers are
encouraged to sign up for
she+ +'s new mentoring pro
gram, which will be launched
this month.
Agarwal and Israni have
contacted female computer
science students at 15 schools
around the country to serve
as mentors for the program.
"We realize that so many
other organizations are doing
a great job in designing dis
tance learning curricula and
workshops where people can
learn to code," Agarwal said.
"We are simply pointing them

in the direction of those or
ganizations."

have already decided on a
course of study and will
therefore be less likely to pur
sue a degree in computer sci
ence.
While Israni and Agarwal
hope to inspire more female
students at Stanford to study
computer science, they have

also reached out to women of
all ages across the country. In
what Agarwal referred to as a
"call to action" at the end of
the documentary, viewers are
encouraged to sign up for
she+ +'s new mentoring pro
gram, which will be launched
this month.
Agarwal and Israni have
contacted female computer
science students at 15 schools
around the country to serve
as mentors for the program.
"We realize that so many
other organizations are doing
a great job in designing dis
tance learning curricula and
workshops where people can
learn to code," Agarwal said.
"We are simply pointing them

in the direction of those or
ganizations."
