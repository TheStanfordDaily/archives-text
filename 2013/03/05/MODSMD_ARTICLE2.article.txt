## she++ documentary earns national buzz 
### MARY HARRISON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Ayna Agarwal 'l4 and Ellora Is
rani 'l4 enrolled at Stanford, studying com
puter science was the furthest thing from
their minds.
"Even though I grew up in Silicon Val
ley, I never thought computer science was
for me, because I never saw anyone who
looked like me doing it," Israni said.
After taking introductory computer sci
ence classes, however, Agarwal and Israni
were hooked. In April 2012, they hosted
she+ + , Stanford's first conference for
women in technology, with 11 female
speakers from companies including Drop
box, Google and Pinterest.
Since then, she+ + has grown exponen
tially developing into a nationwide commu
nity that has been featured in Forbes,
Tech Crunch and The Huffington Post. This
spring, she+ + will release a documentary
launch a mentorship program and host its
second annual conference, which will be
free for Stanford and high school students.

"We're really trying to show you what it
means to be a woman in technology" Israni
said.
The 12-minute documentary which in
cludes interviews with Stanford students,
alumni and professors, will be released on
April 1, and Agarwal and Israni will host a
special screening at Cubberley Auditorium
on April 3. The film's trailer, which was up
loaded to YouTÃŸbe two weeks ago, has col
lected more than 15,000 views.
Agarwal and Israni said that they had
been inspired to produce the documentary
after noticing a trend in the demographics
of their upper-level computer science
courses.
"We saw that in the progression of com
puter science classes, the number of
women really decreased," Agarwal said.
"We wondered why there was no conversa
tion about this."
