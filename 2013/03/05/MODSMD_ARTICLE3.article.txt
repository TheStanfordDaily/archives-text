# Big names weigh in on divestment debate
## Figures inside and outside University take sides 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As the ASSU Undergraduate Senate pre
pares to discuss for the third straight week a bill
put forward by Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) supporting selective divestment
from Israel, SPER and the Stanford Israel Al
liance (SIA) have both received outside state
ments of support from prominent individuals, in
cluding Nobel Prize winners and congressmen.
SPER has received statements of support for
their campaign from a number of prominent so
cial justice advocates, including Nobel Peace
Laureates Mairead Maguire and Archbishop
Desmond Thtu.
SlA's supporters include Congressmen Eric
Cantor and Charles Rangel and Nobel Prize
winners Roger Kornberg Ph.D. '72, professor of
structural biology, and A1 Roth M.S. '73 Ph.D.
'74, professor of economics.
The Senate will vote on the bill at tomorrow's
meeting. If approved, the bill would pledge the
Senate's support in urging the Board of Trustees
to reconsider endowment investments in eight

companies including Caterpillar, Lockheed
Martin and Motorola that allegedly cause
"substantial social injury." The Senate has heard
student presentations on both sides of the issue
at their last two meetings.
In a letter addressed to the ASSU, Tutu said
that he has supported similar campaigns on sev
eral other college campuses and compared the
situation in Palestine to apartheid in South
Africa.
"No matter what detractors may allege, stu
dents pushing for divestment are doing the right
thing. They are doing the moral thing," Thtu
wrote in his letter. "These students advocating
divestment from Israel's occupation today are
helping to pave that path to a just peace, and I
heartily endorse their divestment move, encour
age them to stand firm on the side of what is
right and urge others to follow their lead."
In Roth's statement on the SIA website, he
said that he opposes divestment from Israel and
opposes singling Israel out for human rights vio
lations.
