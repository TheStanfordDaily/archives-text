# Big names weigh in on divestment debate
## Figures inside and outside University take sides 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
As the ASSU Undergraduate Senate pre
pares to discuss for the third straight week a bill
put forward by Students for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER) supporting selective divestment
from Israel, SPER and the Stanford Israel Al
liance (SIA) have both received outside state
ments of support from prominent individuals, in
cluding Nobel Prize winners and congressmen.
SPER has received statements of support for
their campaign from a number of prominent so
cial justice advocates, including Nobel Peace
Laureates Mairead Maguire and Archbishop
Desmond Thtu.
SlA's supporters include Congressmen Eric
Cantor and Charles Rangel and Nobel Prize
winners Roger Kornberg Ph.D. '72, professor of
structural biology, and A1 Roth M.S. '73 Ph.D.
'74, professor of economics.
The Senate will vote on the bill at tomorrow's
meeting. If approved, the bill would pledge the
Senate's support in urging the Board of Trustees
to reconsider endowment investments in eight

companies including Caterpillar, Lockheed
Martin and Motorola that allegedly cause
"substantial social injury." The Senate has heard
student presentations on both sides of the issue
at their last two meetings.
In a letter addressed to the ASSU, Tutu said
that he has supported similar campaigns on sev
eral other college campuses and compared the
situation in Palestine to apartheid in South
Africa.
"No matter what detractors may allege, stu
dents pushing for divestment are doing the right
thing. They are doing the moral thing," Thtu
wrote in his letter. "These students advocating
divestment from Israel's occupation today are
helping to pave that path to a just peace, and I
heartily endorse their divestment move, encour
age them to stand firm on the side of what is
right and urge others to follow their lead."
In Roth's statement on the SIA website, he
said that he opposes divestment from Israel and
opposes singling Israel out for human rights vio
lations.
"Despite the long running
low intensity war that per
sists, and the moral and
practical complications of
occupation, I think people at
Stanford should question
whether they believe that
Israel has a worse human
rights record than its neigh
bors, or that Palestine would
become an island of liberal
democracy on the Arab map
if only peace could be
achieved," Roth wrote.
Yoav Shoham, a comput
er science professor, and
Larry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO, a political science
professor and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
have also written statements
in opposition to SPER's bill
on the SIA website. The late
Daniel Pearl 'Bs's father,
Judea Pearl, wrote a state

ment opposing the SPER
bill, and a petition from
Stanford alumni received
more than 700 signatures.
"We urge you to resist at
tempts by the [Boycott, Di
vestment, Sanctions] special
interest group to hijack the
Senate's agenda and dis
tract it from its important
work," wrote Michael Ja
cobs '77 in a letter on the
SIA website in support of
the alumni petition to op
pose the SPER bill.
Maguire and Tutu's let
ters in support of the SPER
petition were joined by 11
other statements from schol
ars, students and interested
parties, including "The Col
or Purple" author Alice
Walker, Pink Floyd member
Roger Waters, Professor of
History Joel Benin and Pro
fessor of Comparative Liter
ature David Palumbo-Liu.
SPER also received a let
ter of support signed by rep
resentatives from 86 Pales
tinian college councils and

youth organizations, who
wrote that they "live under
an oppressive system of
colonial control."
"Stanford students have
always been at the forefront
of innovative and value
based actions that have
pushed the human race for
ward," the letter said. "It is
in your hands at Stanford to
see that the tide finally
turns across campuses in
the United States to ensure
that companies are held ac
countable for continuing to
support the violation of
Palestinian human rights."
Representatives from
student groups such as
Chabad at Stanford, the
Jewish Student Organization
and J Street U Stanford have
also spoken out in opposition
to the divestment bill, criti
cizing it as an attack on Is
rael that could threaten the
existence of the country.
