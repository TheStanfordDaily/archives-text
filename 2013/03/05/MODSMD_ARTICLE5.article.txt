## OAPE cites overall progress, winter frosh transports rise 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
After an increase in alcohol-related incidents
among freshmen at the beginning of winter
quarter, Director of the Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE) Ralph Castro and Dean
of Freshmen Rob Urstein sent out an email dur
ing Parents' Weekend warning the freshman
class about the consequences of dangerous
drinking behavior. Administrators have struck a
more optimistic tone, however, when reviewing
the academic year to date.
According to Castro, the email was meant to
remind students of the University's stance on
high-risk drinking and revisit some of the topics
discussed during New Student Orientation

(NSO) regarding alcohol use.
"We just wanted to keep it fresh in their
minds and reiterate our message around re
sponsible use and making good decisions and
things like that," Castro said.
Though freshmen alcohol transports de
creased during fall quarter compared to recent
years, the email stated that freshmen have been
"injuring themselves with alcohol more and
more frequently" in recent months and noted
that freshmen regularly face legal proceedings
for offenses like public intoxication.
Sam Saenz 'll, outreach and internship co
ordinator for OAPE, said that the increase in
alcohol-related incidents during winter quar
ter was surprising. Historically those num
bers typically peak in the fall and are lowest in

the winter.
"It's something we normally don't expect,"
Saenz said. "It definitely caught us off guard
when we saw the numbers increase, and we're
not quite sure as to what happened."
However, Kenny Johnson 'l4, a resident as
sistant in Burbank, said that the increase in win-

ter quarter incidents was not
unprecedented.
"Winter quarter can kind
of be a time where kids can be
more confident with their
drinking, and it's just more
stressful," Johnson said.
While Castro expressed
concern over the increasing
number of alcohol-related inci
dents this quarter, he noted
that freshman transport num
bers are still relatively low
compared to last year's num
bers.
Castro credited this de
crease in part to some of
OAPE's new initiatives, in
cluding greater outreach to
freshmen dorms, new party
planning policies and training,
the alcohol-free social events
offered by the Cardinal
Nights program and the

Cheers OAPE iPhone app.
"One of the things we have
really been trying to work on
is changing the culture that
you need alcohol to have fun
all the time," Castro said.
"Can you have fun when you
drink alcohol? Absolutely Do
you need alcohol to have fun?
No."
Johnson agreed that the
Cardinal Nights program,
which has hosted trips to
Build-A-Bear Workshop, Red
wood Roller Rink and Laser
Quest, among other locations,
has been very effective.
"The underlying issue is
that there is just not things to
do on campus necessarily,"
Johnson said. "For some kids
the only attractive option is to
drink and go out, whereas
things like going to Sky High
or going to movies, that's awe
some."
However, Johnson ques
tioned whether or not some of
OAPE's other initiatives are
successful in reducing danger

ous drinking behavior.
"I think the party planning
workshop has good intentions,
but it needs to be worked on,"
Johnson said. "It's a hard
thing because there's a differ
ence between knowledge and
practice, especially with some
thing like drinking."
Castro recently attended
an Undergraduate Senate
meeting with OAPE Assistant
Directors Angelina Cardona
'll and Jarreau Bowen 'O7
M.A 'OB to solicit feedback
from students like Johnson.
According to Castro, this
feedback will be used to ad
just OAPE's programs going
forward.
Castro will also teach a
four-unit alcohol studies class
during spring quarter, called
Alcohol Issues and Campus
Culture. According to Castro,
the course has been offered
"off and on" for the past 10
years, with enrollment fluctu
ating between 10 and 50 stu
dents.

Saenz, who will be a teach
ing assistant for the course,
said that students are expect
ed to investigate the alcohol
culture on campus, collect da
ta and develop ideas for proj
ects that tackle the issue of
high-risk drinking behavior.
According to Saenz, these
ideas could be incorporated
into new programs or policies
for OAPE in the future.
"Our main focus is to con
tinue the good work that's
been happening this year,"
Saenz said. "We want to make
sure we keep that up, so I
think that's really what we're
trying to do with the letter."
