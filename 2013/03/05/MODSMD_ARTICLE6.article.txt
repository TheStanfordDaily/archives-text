# Q&A EMANUEL PLEITEZ
## ALUM RUNS FOR MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Emanuel Pleitez 'O5, chief strategy officer
at Los Angeles-based technology company
Spokeo, is a candidate in the city's mayoral
race. With primaries scheduled for today, The
Daily spoke with Pleitez about his motives in
running for mayor, his platform and strategy
and how his campaign has been influenced by
his time at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why are you
running for mayor of Los Angeles?
Emanuel Pleitez (EP): I'm running be
cause quite frankly I was uninspired and
unimpressed by the slate of candidates who
were running before I decided to run. I felt

that not only me but also a number of people
through all of Los Angeles felt the same way.
Now that I've decided to run, that sentiment
has continued to be a driving force of my cam
paign. At the end of the day we're not the can
didates who are not addressing the issues that
are most pressing to the city. There are a lot of
things that I went through that I know a lot
of families are still going through and I feel
the urgency to address the issues now.
TSD: Of the seven-point plan of issues on
your platform, what is the most pressing is
sue in Los Angeles that you wish to solve or
work on? Why?
EP: The most pressing issue is the fiscal
problems that Los Angeles faces, [and] specifi
cally the pension-bought liabilities [that] are in-

creasing every year as a
percentage of the budget.
Addressing that will be able
to solve our budget issues
and make sure that we're

investing in those communities, and the way we
address it is by reforming the pension system.
I'm proposing a pension buyout plan that
would allow us to give municipal workers
the ones that folks of power have promised
very nice retirement benefits some upfront
amount so they can actually have something
for those promises and then move everyone
over to plans that are defined contributions
and allow them to have a more stable retire
ment plan going forward.

Number two, which is my
number one issue for the long
run, is investing in education
and training, not just for
young people but for their
families as well. At the end of
the day, the foundation of
any economy has to still be
the workforce, and so my
number one plan is to have
skilled workers in LA.
TSD: You've been credited
for unique campaigning
strategies, including run
ning and biking across Los
Angeles to introduce your
self to voters. Can you talk
about what prompted you
to take on this specific cam
paign effort and what that
experience entailed?
EP: My campaign has ex
ecuted strategies where we
reach out to voters in a more

direct and personal way
than any other campaign.
We started with having a 30
[person]-plus community or
ganizer staff that was actu
ally speaking to voters face
to face at their doors six to
seven days a week since Ju
ly. That was coupled with
phone banking and social
media efforts that allowed
us to continue reaching out
in a very personal way. Not
only is that a better way to
reach voters, but also it's
more efficient and a better
use of our resources.
This latest effort of bik
ing and running 120 miles
across Los Angeles was the
finishing touch on that kind
of campaign where I was ac
tually throughout all the ma
jor streets in almost all the
neighborhoods greeting vot
ers face to face ... They
knew that I was doing it be
cause we are getting the tra
ditional media attention, and
our social media attention
was there as well so it al
lowed me to engage people
in a very personal way.

TSD: What other unique
campaign strategies have
you used to both raise
funds for your campaign
and to stand out among the
other candidates?
EP: Because of our email
marketing campaign and our
donor base which is much
younger than the other can
didates' and in much smaller
donations we've actually
had 80 percent of our dona
tions through online contri
butions which is unheard of
in any campaign to have it
that high.
To reach the voters, to do
it the right way, you need to
combine old traditional media
with the newer social media so
that you're actually engaging
people on multiple platforms.
Because we have many more
platforms, we've trained our
organizers not just to be 'or
ganizers'â€” as more tradi
tional campaigns would have
field organizers go out there
to recruit volunteers and talk
to voters but actual con
tent creators that propagate
content through various
channels that is relevant to
actual voters.
For example, I have a
central Facebook page but
also a page for each of the

neighborhoods throughout
the city, which had less likes
but we were able to engage
voters in a very direct way
about their neighborhood.
That was coupled with some
one going off to knock on
someone's door and that
night becoming their Face
book friend and getting them
to like their neighborhood
page so then we continuously
generate content for those
voters through those means.
TSD: How would your
work experience at Spokeo
and your time at Goldman
Sachs and McKinsey and
Company shape your may
oral responsibilities?
EP: I know how to use
data better... in terms of
managing big data and cre
ating products that allow us
to get our services better to
Angelinos. In terms of fi
nance and capital market
roles, I understand at the
end of the day how we can
leverage any type of capital
wherever it's coming from so
we can invest into the com
munities most in need, and
leverage the capital markets
that are looking to LA for
potential equity opportuni
ties into enterprises in LA.
From my McKinsey experi
ence, I understand how to
dig into any company's oper
ations and develop strate
gies to help them grow.

TSD: How has your Stan
ford experience and the
connections you formed at
Stanford played a role in
your campaigning?
EP: A lot of my friends
from Stanford, folks I
worked with at El Centro
Chicano, folks from my busi
ness fraternity, have come
through in huge ways in
terms of contributing to my
campaign, volunteering for
my campaign and just being
supportive in general. My
Stanford friends are the
backbone of my supporter
base for my campaign.
TSD: Do you anticipate win
ning?
EP: Yes, absolutely. You
have to go in with a winning
game plan and we're executing
it.
