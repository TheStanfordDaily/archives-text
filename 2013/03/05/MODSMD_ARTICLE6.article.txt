# Q&A EMANUEL PLEITEZ
## ALUM RUNS FOR MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES 
### ILEANA NAJARRO DESK EDITOR 
Emanuel Pleitez 'O5, chief strategy officer
at Los Angeles-based technology company
Spokeo, is a candidate in the city's mayoral
race. With primaries scheduled for today, The
Daily spoke with Pleitez about his motives in
running for mayor, his platform and strategy
and how his campaign has been influenced by
his time at Stanford.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why are you
running for mayor of Los Angeles?
Emanuel Pleitez (EP): I'm running be
cause quite frankly I was uninspired and
unimpressed by the slate of candidates who
were running before I decided to run. I felt

that not only me but also a number of people
through all of Los Angeles felt the same way.
Now that I've decided to run, that sentiment
has continued to be a driving force of my cam
paign. At the end of the day we're not the can
didates who are not addressing the issues that
are most pressing to the city. There are a lot of
things that I went through that I know a lot
of families are still going through and I feel
the urgency to address the issues now.
TSD: Of the seven-point plan of issues on
your platform, what is the most pressing is
sue in Los Angeles that you wish to solve or
work on? Why?
EP: The most pressing issue is the fiscal
problems that Los Angeles faces, [and] specifi
cally the pension-bought liabilities [that] are in-

creasing every year as a
percentage of the budget.
Addressing that will be able
to solve our budget issues
and make sure that we're

investing in those communities, and the way we
address it is by reforming the pension system.
I'm proposing a pension buyout plan that
would allow us to give municipal workers
the ones that folks of power have promised
very nice retirement benefits some upfront
amount so they can actually have something
for those promises and then move everyone
over to plans that are defined contributions
and allow them to have a more stable retire
ment plan going forward.
