## A3C surveys students on faculty diversity 
### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
Undergraduate representatives of the
Asian American Activities Center recently
sent out a new student survey on faculty di
versity in an effort to inform and advance ad
vocacy efforts for a broader range of back
grounds within the faculty body, according to
involved students.
The online survey, which was created by
Van Anh Tran 'l3 and Michael Tayag 'l3, was
sent to several Asian American student mail
ing lists. The survey involved a series of
questions about academic and research inter
ests and asked students whether or not they
were satisfied with the current course offer
ings in the Asian American Studies program.
The survey also solicited student feedback on
what other courses they would like to see the
program offer.
Tran and Tayag worked with David
Palumbo-Liu, director of the Asian American
Studies program, to formulate the survey
questions. They plan to present the results to
members of the Faculty Diversity Initiative
(FDI), which was created in 2007 with the
goal of recruiting diverse scholars focused on
the study of race and ethnicity and fostering
faculty diversity.
"We just want to see what kind of re
search and academic interests students have,
so that would support the faculty diversity
committee in identifying what kind of candi
dates they should look for," Tayag said.
According to 2013 statistics released by
the University, non-minorities compose 74
percent of Stanford's faculty. Although Asian
faculty members are the best-represented
minority, they constitute only 14 percent of
Stanford's faculty.
Albert Camarillo, professor of history and
special assistant to the provost for faculty di
versity, said that while the University consid
ers how potential hires would contribute to
campus diversity, faculty searches "vary
widely" in their success in finding diverse
candidates.
"The historically underrepresented
groups continue to be very underrepresent
ed," Camarillo said, adding that the progress
in cultivating faculty diversity has been "slow
and very modest."
Tran said that students are "really aware"
of this slow progress and emphasized that the
survey was created in order to help "get the
process rolling more."
Both Tran and Tayag said that they were
particularly concerned with the number of
Asian American faculty members in human
ities and social science departments. Tran,
who is pursuing an honors thesis in public
history, said that she has been disappointed
by the scarcity of faculty with Asian Ameri
can research interests.
"My adviser doesn't know much about
my field specifically," Tran said, adding that
though this made the process "difficult,"
her adviser was supportive and helpful.
