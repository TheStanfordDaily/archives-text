In "Financial aid rises to
meet tuition hike" (March 4),
The Daily quoted Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper
as saying that there was "no
official reason for why tuition
has increased." In fact,
Cooper said: "[TJhere are
lots of reasons why tuition
goes up. I don't have for you
the official reason." The Dai
ly regrets the error.
