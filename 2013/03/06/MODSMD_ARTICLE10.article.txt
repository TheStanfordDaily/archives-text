# Wake up early and make time for your school

### Winston Shi 
I wish I went to more games at
Stanford. It's already week
nine, and I suppose it makes
sense that I'm having trouble
fitting being a sports fan into
my daily schedule, but even so I find
my attendance record more than wor
risome.
I try to go to at least one game or
meet for each team, and there are a
disturbing number of unchecked boxes
that probably won't get checked by the
time the quarter ends. Other sporting
events that I try to get to I somehow
can't make football's first open
practice, more baseball games at
Sunken Diamond, all sorts of interest
ing matchups between elite teams.
There's quite a bit of irony to this
because when I first applied to col
leges, I really loved how Stanford's
spoils teams were so good. I was veiy
interested in how Stanford had the
best athletics program in the country
and I thought that Stanford's athletic
teams reflected and represented the
University's commitment to support
ing every facet of student life.
All of this still holds true. Stanford
is a great place in part because it has
such a special athletics program, and it
wouldn't be Stanford without it. But,
like I said, it's more than a bit ironic
that one of the University's biggest
draws for me is one that I don't take
advantage of nearly as often as I
should.
Florida State makes all of its stu
dents, whether or not they play on var
sity teams, pay a fee to the athletic de
partment; Cal charges for student tick
ets to its games. This is mostly par for
the course across the country. College
athletics are rarely as well ftinded as
they are here at Stanford.
I can walk into any stadium on
campus by just showing my SUID; the
only price requested of me is my time.
FUnny enough, that resource—time
—is the one I have in shortest supply.
I go to games when I can, but I
don't go enough for reasons
that I don't fully understand.
This doesn't just extend to
sports I've missed events
by amazing musicians and
world-renowned writers, some
of the most brilliant people in the
world. We're very lucky to be at
a school that constantly brings in
the creme de la creme of our civ
ilization to speak and to teach.
Now, I'm not saying that I,
or any of you, ought to drop the
commitments we've made in
order to watch more games or

go to more concerts or Q&A
sessions. That would be the
last thing I would ever sug
gest. Everyone who went to
Stanford signed up for four or
so years of never really having
as much time as you'd like
picking and choosing what
things you can do and what
things you can't.
We can't do it all; nobody
has the sort of time to do
everything. It's simply not pos
sible. The opportunities that
we're given are not endless,
but they may well extend be
yond what we'd previously
considered possible and if
they don't, somebody will in
vent something soon that con
tinues to push the boundaries
of our imagination, in the same

way that student-athletes
strive to push the boundaries
of what the hmnan body can
achieve.

I would argue, though, that
we all should display a re
newed commitment to being
productive with our time
that, in short, we ought to
make time for our school.
There's a lot out there that I'm
sure you haven't seen and I
know I haven't.
We all know that there's a
lot of work to do here. To hell
with duck syndrome I will
freely admit that there's a lot
of work. But what I've found
out is that, despite all my prior
commitments, if I tiy hard
enough, somehow there gener
ally seems to be time to support

the people that wake up at 5
a.m. every day to create some
thing worthwhile.

Winston Shi a world
renowned poet himself wakes
up at 5 am. every day and
climbs up to his favorite unit
ing spot on the roof of Memori
al Church to write his poems as
the sun rises. Ask him to write
you a sonnet at wshi9l@stan
ford.edu.
