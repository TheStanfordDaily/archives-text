I wish I went to more games at
Stanford. It's already week
nine, and I suppose it makes
sense that I'm having trouble
fitting being a sports fan into
my daily schedule, but even so I find
my attendance record more than wor
risome.
I try to go to at least one game or
meet for each team, and there are a
disturbing number of unchecked boxes
that probably won't get checked by the
time the quarter ends. Other sporting
events that I try to get to I somehow
can't make football's first open
practice, more baseball games at
Sunken Diamond, all sorts of interest
ing matchups between elite teams.
There's quite a bit of irony to this
because when I first applied to col
leges, I really loved how Stanford's
spoils teams were so good. I was veiy
interested in how Stanford had the
best athletics program in the country
and I thought that Stanford's athletic
teams reflected and represented the
University's commitment to support
ing every facet of student life.
All of this still holds true. Stanford
is a great place in part because it has
such a special athletics program, and it
wouldn't be Stanford without it. But,
like I said, it's more than a bit ironic
that one of the University's biggest
draws for me is one that I don't take
advantage of nearly as often as I
should.
Florida State makes all of its stu
dents, whether or not they play on var
sity teams, pay a fee to the athletic de
partment; Cal charges for student tick
ets to its games. This is mostly par for
the course across the country. College
athletics are rarely as well ftinded as
they are here at Stanford.
I can walk into any stadium on
campus by just showing my SUID; the
only price requested of me is my time.
FUnny enough, that resource—time
—is the one I have in shortest supply.
