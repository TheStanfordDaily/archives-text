# WIN DESPITE WIND
## 
### DO-HYOUNG PARK STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal baseball team has
maintained its win steak in all sorts of
ways, from masterful pitching per
formances to walk-off nail-biters. Last
night, Stanford battled not only the
Santa Clara Broncos but also the ele
ments. It certainly wasn't pretty but
the Card (10-2) upped its win streak to
nine games as it squeezed by Santa
Clara, 6-4 in the midst of a windstorm.

SANTA CLARA 4
3/5, Santa Clara, Calif.

This marks Stanford's first win
streak longer than eight games since
the 2003 season, when the Cardinal
team won nine straight to open the
month of May before dropping an ex
tra-innings nail-biter to UCLA.
With winds gusting as high as 25
miles per hour in advance of a storm
bearing down on the Bay Aea, con
ditions were less than ideal for base
ball in Santa Clara. Every fly ball hit
to right field was cause for unneces
sary drama as the wind blowing in
from the right had a mind of its own.
This was no clearer than in the top
of the sixth inning, when sophomore
right fielder Austin Slater hit a high
fly ball that was clearly destined to
land in right field. However, the wind
pushed the ball all the way back into
the infield, where Broncos shortstop
Justin Viele had to dash over from his
position and slide in order to make the
catch.
Senior righty pitcher Dean McAr
dle, making his third weekday start of
the season, fell behind early in the first
inning when the leadoff hitter for the
Broncos singled on a ball right up the
middle, advanced to second on a sacri
fice bunt and promptly scored on a
single by third baseman Greg Harisis.
After the ran scored, however,
McArdle settled in and cruised
through the rest of his outing as he
collected a well deserved win, his first
of the season. In four solid innings of
work, McArdle shuck out a season
high six batters and only allowed one

more runner to reach base on a single
in the fourth.
"I was just leaving balls up early
with strikes down the middle of the
plate, thigh high, so I was just trying
to concentrate on keeping balls down
after that," said McArdle. "They
swung over some pitches, the umpire
gave me some calls and we played
some good defense."
Although the offense was out-hit
by the Broncos batters 8-6, the Cardi
nal hitters were able to take advan
tage of four errors committed by a
sloppy Santa Clara defense through
out the evening to put runs up on the
board.
In the second inning, a ball hit by
sophomore left fielder Dominic Jose
resulted in not one, but two errors:
one by first baseman Quintan Perry
and another by second baseman Kyle
DeMerritt. This resulted in Jose
reaching second base and sophomore

third baseman Alex Blandino, who
had been on first, scooting all the way
over to third.
The Cardinal was able to take ad
vantage of the miscue when freshman
outfielder Jonny Locher delivered a
solid single into center field. Both Jose
and Blandino scored on the play to put
Stanford up early 2-1, a lead that it
would never relinquish.
Stanford tallied on three more in
surance runs in the fourth inning to
extend its lead. Sophomore catcher
Brant Whiting continued to impress in
limited action with a sacrifice fly that
brought home junior shortstop Lon
nie Kauppila. A pair of back-to-back
RBI singles from Slater and junior in
fielder Danny Diekroeger put the
Cardinal up 5-1.
There was some controversy in
Stanford's half of the fifth inning
when Locher hit a sharp ground ball
that bounced off the glove of the

shortstop and dribbled into left field.
Kauppila took off from second base,
barreled around third and was waved
home. Seeing the throw beat him, the
junior did what all baseball players
do in such a situation and smashed in
to the catcher, attempting to dislodge
the ball.
After what appeared to be a clean
collision at home plate, Kauppila was
ejected from the ballgame by home
plate umpire Sid Aguilar after it was
ruled that he used his arms in the col
lision, which constituted unnecessary
force.
Although coach Mark Marquess
voiced his displeasure and argued,
Kauppila was forced out of the ball
game and was replaced by freshman
Drew Jackson.

Junior second baseman Danny Diekroeger (2) had an RBI single in the fourth inning to put the Card up
5-1 against Santa Clara. The Card hopes to continue its even output from multiple players against UNLV
ninth inning, allowing the
Broncos to rally and bring the
potential winning run to home
plate. After a run had already
come across with two outs,
junior righty Sam Lindquist
balked the tying run to second

base. With the game on the
line, Lindquist was able to
strike Harisis out to end the
game.
Stanford will hope to ex
tend its winning streak even
further as the Cardinal pre
pares to host the UNLV
Rebels for a three-game series
at home over the weekend.

The Cardinal baseball team has
maintained its win steak in all sorts of
ways, from masterful pitching per
formances to walk-off nail-biters. Last
night, Stanford battled not only the
Santa Clara Broncos but also the ele
ments. It certainly wasn't pretty but
the Card (10-2) upped its win streak to
nine games as it squeezed by Santa
Clara, 6-4 in the midst of a windstorm.

BASEBALL
STANFORD 6
SANTA CLARA 4
3/5, Santa Clara, Calif.

This marks Stanford's first win
streak longer than eight games since
the 2003 season, when the Cardinal
team won nine straight to open the
month of May before dropping an ex
tra-innings nail-biter to UCLA.
With winds gusting as high as 25
miles per hour in advance of a storm
bearing down on the Bay Aea, con
ditions were less than ideal for base
ball in Santa Clara. Every fly ball hit
to right field was cause for unneces
sary drama as the wind blowing in
from the right had a mind of its own.
This was no clearer than in the top
of the sixth inning, when sophomore
right fielder Austin Slater hit a high
fly ball that was clearly destined to
land in right field. However, the wind
pushed the ball all the way back into
the infield, where Broncos shortstop
Justin Viele had to dash over from his
position and slide in order to make the
catch.
Senior righty pitcher Dean McAr
dle, making his third weekday start of
the season, fell behind early in the first
inning when the leadoff hitter for the
Broncos singled on a ball right up the
middle, advanced to second on a sacri
fice bunt and promptly scored on a
single by third baseman Greg Harisis.
After the ran scored, however,
McArdle settled in and cruised
through the rest of his outing as he
collected a well deserved win, his first
of the season. In four solid innings of
work, McArdle shuck out a season
high six batters and only allowed one

more runner to reach base on a single
in the fourth.
"I was just leaving balls up early
with strikes down the middle of the
plate, thigh high, so I was just trying
to concentrate on keeping balls down
after that," said McArdle. "They
swung over some pitches, the umpire
gave me some calls and we played
some good defense."
Although the offense was out-hit
by the Broncos batters 8-6, the Cardi
nal hitters were able to take advan
tage of four errors committed by a
sloppy Santa Clara defense through
out the evening to put runs up on the
board.
In the second inning, a ball hit by
sophomore left fielder Dominic Jose
resulted in not one, but two errors:
one by first baseman Quintan Perry
and another by second baseman Kyle
DeMerritt. This resulted in Jose
reaching second base and sophomore

third baseman Alex Blandino, who
had been on first, scooting all the way
over to third.
The Cardinal was able to take ad
vantage of the miscue when freshman
outfielder Jonny Locher delivered a
solid single into center field. Both Jose
and Blandino scored on the play to put
Stanford up early 2-1, a lead that it
would never relinquish.
Stanford tallied on three more in
surance runs in the fourth inning to
extend its lead. Sophomore catcher
Brant Whiting continued to impress in
limited action with a sacrifice fly that
brought home junior shortstop Lon
nie Kauppila. A pair of back-to-back
RBI singles from Slater and junior in
fielder Danny Diekroeger put the
Cardinal up 5-1.
There was some controversy in
Stanford's half of the fifth inning
when Locher hit a sharp ground ball
that bounced off the glove of the

shortstop and dribbled into left field.
Kauppila took off from second base,
barreled around third and was waved
home. Seeing the throw beat him, the
junior did what all baseball players
do in such a situation and smashed in
to the catcher, attempting to dislodge
the ball.
After what appeared to be a clean
collision at home plate, Kauppila was
ejected from the ballgame by home
plate umpire Sid Aguilar after it was
ruled that he used his arms in the col
lision, which constituted unnecessary
force.
Although coach Mark Marquess
voiced his displeasure and argued,
Kauppila was forced out of the ball
game and was replaced by freshman
Drew Jackson.

vided a scare in the bottom of the

Junior second baseman Danny Diekroeger (2) had an RBI single in the fourth inning to put the Card up
5-1 against Santa Clara. The Card hopes to continue its even output from multiple players against UNLV
ninth inning, allowing the
Broncos to rally and bring the
potential winning run to home
plate. After a run had already
come across with two outs,
junior righty Sam Lindquist
balked the tying run to second

base. With the game on the
line, Lindquist was able to
strike Harisis out to end the
game.
Stanford will hope to ex
tend its winning streak even
further as the Cardinal pre
pares to host the UNLV
Rebels for a three-game series
at home over the weekend.
