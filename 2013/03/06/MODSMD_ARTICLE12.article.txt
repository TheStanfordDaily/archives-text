# Deferred gratification
## 
### Uttara Sivaram 
Last week, the admissions office
received around 520 "Optional
Update Forms" from those they
had both blessed and cursed in a single
email. Indeed, one of my good friends
from high school was deferred, and I
remember trying to console her and
congratulate her at the same time. The
only other situation to which I could
liken this one was the time I tried using
an Icy-Hot pack after seeing that com
pelling ad starring Shaquille O'Neal. In
fact, I repeated this analogy to my
glum high school friend, but it ended up
making her feel even worse. Needless
to say I bungled the job, but there's no
denying that being deferred is one of
the most complex, confusing and frus
trating situations to be in.
I would know You may not believe
that someone with my intelligence and
wit could have possibly gotten de
ferred, but deferred I was. All party
planning was halted; the music ceased;
the waiter's were sent packing; the
flower's were thrown out; and the jazz
quartet made for the hills. In other
words, I sat at my computer chair,
rereading that terrible email with a
combined sense of severe disappoint
ment and relief.
This is not to say that I'm not (in
hindsight) incredibly thankfrrl for the
second chance Stanford gave me. How
ever, I must say that sending a deferral
is almost worse than simply rejecting
the kid and letting him get on with his
applications to Brown and Yale and
wherever else, not to mention their sec
ond semester of senior year—a se
mester of low GPAs and high BACs.
Instead, a deferral presents seniors
with another semester of high stress
and continued participation in school
activities that no one cared about to be
gin with. I remember sitting resentful
ly in my Speech and Debate tourna
ments, flipping through The Econo
mist for my upcoming extemporaneous
speech and executing it with so much
anger and impatience that the judge of
fered me a handkerchief and requested
that I stop spitting when I talked be
cause his shirt was getting soggy
It was both infuriating and amazing
that my most stellar high school semes
ter was my last. I somehow got straight
As, started a new organization on cam
pus (which was unanimously voted into
extinction the year after I graduated
—turns out no one truly cares about
saving the Bengal tigers), organized a
bone marrow drive, auditioned for the
lead in the Spring musical and taught
soccer to kids from low-income families
(they ended up playing soccer while I
did their math homework). This was in
addition to keeping in step with the ob
ligations I had as editor-in-chief of the

school newspaper, member of the ASB
and (for some reason) chief financial of
ficer of the Persian club. If I may say so,
it was a job well done.
At least, that's what I thought when
I eventually got in. I truly believed that
my acceptance was derivative of the
hard work I had put into the last couple
of months, just so I could fill that darn
Optional Update Form to the exact
word limit. And perhaps it was. Howev
er, 111 never forget the day during Ad
mit Weekend when I met the admis
sions officer who was responsible for
my acceptance. When I met him, he re
cited one of his favorite lines from my
Common App essay. And then he
asked me why I never turned in an Op
tional Update Form.
It must have been a mistake in pro
cessing. Somehow; the Admissions Of
fice hadn't received the form that I had
given up any semblance of human de
cency and dignity I had left to fill out.
Thrns out that my case just needed a
little more arguing. Regardless, I was
shocked.
Severe disappointment is a strong
motivator. Mix it in with a tiny speck of
hope, and you get a neurotic teenager
with the will and capability to do pretty
amazing things. When I was deferred, I
was personally offended that the school
of my dreams had put me so unceremo
niously on hold. Pint of me wished Stan
ford had rejected me, just so I wouldn't
have to go through the same cycle of
hard work, anticipation and disappoint
ment twice. I was a weary high school
senior who just wanted to pledge alle
giance to Cal out of spite and get some
C's on the next couple of exams. Every
senior deserves that.
Watching my friend go through the
same process makes me both nostalgic
and a little angry. If you asked me last
year whether I thought deferrals were
a good idea, I would've said yes, ab
solutely Tbday I'm not so sure. The col
lege application process is a nasty one,
and it makes students do good things
for the worst reasons. Most of those
things will never be acknowledged out
side of a short Stanford Daily column,
year's after the fact. And the natural
feeling of inferiority is hard to ignore
when you confront the inescapable ear
ly or regular admit during the first cou
ple weeks of freshman year. It wears
off but leaves a light scar.
So I wish the best of luck to those
who were deferred this year. If you look
at the numbers, it's harder to get de
ferred than it is to get accepted. Thus, I
give you my hearty congratulations for
beating the odds, along with a healthy
dose of my condolences for the parties
and the C's and the unexcused absences
you missed out on for the sake of that
terrible Optional Update Form I as
sure you that if things don't work out
this April, yellow and blue tend to look
good on everyone. But if things do, this
harrowing and exhausting senior year
might just have been worth the trouble.

Uttara will accept, not defer, your
emails at usiv@stanfoniedu.
