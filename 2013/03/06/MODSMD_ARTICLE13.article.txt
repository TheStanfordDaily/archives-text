## OFFBEAT AND OVERHEARD This Stanford Life #2: Jon Bell '75 
### Ren√©e Donovan 
Jon Bell loves a girl who won't
shut up. He can't stand pre
professionalism. He is from St.
Louis, Mo., and has an endearing
habit of bookending his words with
"for heaven's sake" and "my punch
line here i 5..." Another Jon-ism I
love: "to make a short story long."
He was a History major and an
English minor. Of his time at Stan
ford, he tells me, "I never went to
class, I never did homework, I got
really good grades and I don't know
how I did it." He first emailed me
about my column at the beginning of
the year, and we have been in consis
tent email contact since. He volun
teered for my profile project, so I
called him at his home in Boston. We
chatted for an hour to the accompa
niment of a snowstorm with winds
so nasty I could hear them on the
other end of the line on a 70-degree
afternoon on campus.
Jon and I get each other. We
have never met but conversation is
easy. We share Stanford. We share a
love of Faulkner.
Still, we come from different
eras. I have to explain to him what
the term "hookup" encompasses.
He loves the tradition of Full Moon
on the Quad but doesn't like the ta
bles of condoms you will find there.
As he puts it, "It's not like you're go
ing to kiss some guy and wind up in
his bed that night, that's cheap."
When I let him know that, cheap as
it is, that is just what happens for
some students, Jon is astonished.
"Wow."
I try to steer the conversation to

ward his time at Stanford, but what
Jon is most eager to talk about are
male-female dynamics on campus.
He wants to know what it's like to be
a girl at Stanford, and he's curious
about this hookup culture. I do my
best to explain. He tells me he
wouldn't want to be a female at
Stanford. "Being a guy, it's so easy,
Renee."
I'm skeptical, and ask him to
elaborate. He touches on a double
standard that I have been strug
gling to articulate for myself. He
nails it: "If a girl sees a guy she
likes, she can't write her number on
a post-it and stick it on his ass. Girls
can't be as direct."
When we finally get through the
relationship advice, Jon has plenty
more advice to offer about careers.
He worked on Wall Street for 30
years and hated "the hypocrisy and
the lying." He now works at Har
vard Medical School and seems sat
isfied in his work. "For heaven's
sake," he raises his voice a little, "I
hope that kids who are undergrads
now follow their passion. What I did
is I tried to find a prestigious job
that paid me a lot of money. And I
went for it, I got it, and I hated it.
Actually, the passion word is over
used follow your love."
It's tough to sum up Jon in an
hour-long phone conversation and
700 words. He is curious. He seems
refreshingly mischievous, if slightly
inappropriate. His abundant in
sights lend themselves better to
print than the patchy bits of his sto
ry he offered.

He was clear that he wanted to
speak to things to which current
students might relate. As he put it,
"none of this old-alum, misty-eyed,
'Oh, back when I was at Stanford...'
stuff." His remarks about the extent
to which girls can be direct are cer
tainly relatable for me and seem a
far cry from misty-eyed old-alum
stuff.
There is clearly a gap between
Jon's Stanford of the '7os and my
present Stanford. I would like to
think that at my Stanford, even if a
girl can't write her number on a
post-it and stick it on a guy's ass,
she can be as direct as any guy. Jon
brings up some salient dissonance,
though. I hear plenty of guys who
tell me they love when girls are di
rect, but I also hear plenty of re
marks about girls being too aggres
sive, too forward, desperate, trying
too hard.
I explain to Jon that while I try
to debunk the double standard and
be as direct as possible with guys, I
don't want to be the subject of any
archaic remarks about girls being
too forward. He chuckles and lets
me know in typical irreverent Jon
fashion, "The fact is pal, you are."
