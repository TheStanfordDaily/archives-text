# SWEEP THE BEARS
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball
team bounced back from a heart
breaking last-second loss to Col
orado by trouncing the Utah Utes
on Sunday night.
The Cardinal dismantled the
Utes at Maples Pavilion, winning by
a final score of 84-66. However, it
was too little too late for a Stanford
team that, despite having high
hopes of earning an at-large bid in
the NCAA Tournament midway
through the season, dropped five
out of seven games before beating
Utah.
Still, the Card has proven it can
play with anyone in the Pac-12, beat
ing Oregon earlier in the year and
taking other top Pac-12 teams like
Arizona, UCLA and Colorado down
to the wire. If Stanford is able to
find a rhythm in the Pac-12 Tourna
ment, it has as good a chance as any
other team in the conference to
come out on top and earn a trip to
the Tournament.
The Cardinal (17-13, 8-9 Pac-12)
will not need any added motivation
on Wednesday night, as it travels to
Berkeley, Calif, to take on its archri
val: the California Golden Bears (20-
9,12-5).
Stanford delivered one of its best
performances of the season the first
time these two squads faced off,
beating Cal (a team that will most
likely earn an at-large bid) 69-59.
The Bears will certainly be looking

to exact revenge in front of their
home crowd this time around, as
both teams look for a solid perform
ance in their tune-up game before
the Pac-12 Tournament.
Junior guard Allen Crabbe will
lead the way for the Bears' balanced
offensive attack. The 6-foot-6-inch
wing player uses his length to get in
to the paint; he leads Cal in scoring,
averaging 18.4 points per game on
46.5 percent shooting from the field.
Crabbe has the skill set to hurt de
fenses in a variety of ways. He is
shooting a modest 35.2 percent from
beyond the arc, and creates second
chance opportunities with his offen
sive rebounding abilities. The versa
tile NBA prospect is also averaging

six rebounds and 2.6 assists per
game to go along with his scoring
prowess.
Stanford guards sophomore
Chasson Randle and junior Aaron
Bright will have their hands full in
slowing Crabbe down.
Backcourt mate Justin Cobbs
has largely contributed to the Bears
recent success. He is leading the
team in assists, averaging 4.7 per
game and has been a solid distribu
tor for Cal. The 6-foot-3-inch guard
is also second on the team in scor
ing, averaging 14.8 points per game
on 45 percent shooting. Cobbs and
Crabbe have complimented each
other nicely this season, and will
look to continue their success
against the Card.
Stanford, currently sitting in
ninth in the conference standings,
will most likely remain in this posi
tion heading into the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. It is possible, though unlikely,
that the team will leapfrog Washing
ton and move into the eighth spot,
but this requires a win at Cal.
In order for the Card to pull off a
win at rowdy Haas Pavilion, it will
depend on the consistent play of
junior forward Dwight Powell. Pow
ell leads the Card in scoring with
15.3 ppg and 8.2 rpg. His 17 points
and nine rebounds against Cal the
first time around fueled the Jan. 19
win. Powell's dominant play has also
been matched most of the season by
Randle (14.1 ppg) and Josh Huestis

regular season game. The Card defeat

Junior forward John Gage (40) has provided the Card with surges off
the bench this season when needed most. His 5.6 ppg will be
valuable for the Card as it hopes to beat the Bears for a second time.
(10.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg).
The determined offensive
mind of Powell, the speed
and defensive intensity of
Randle and the rebounding
prowess of Huestis could
give the Card a chance to
clinch a second win over Cal.
All three leaders must show

up to perform if the Card is
to accomplish this.
The Cardinal's season
has been defined by solid
basketball and missed op
portunities to this point. It
will look to reverse its fate as
it heads into postseason play.
A win against Cal tonight
will give the Card a much
needed boost heading into

The Cardinal dismantled the
Utes at Maples Pavilion, winning by
a final score of 84-66. However, it
was too little too late for a Stanford
team that, despite having high
hopes of earning an at-large bid in
the NCAA Tournament midway
through the season, dropped five
out of seven games before beating
Utah.
Still, the Card has proven it can
play with anyone in the Pac-12, beat
ing Oregon earlier in the year and
taking other top Pac-12 teams like
Arizona, UCLA and Colorado down
to the wire. If Stanford is able to
find a rhythm in the Pac-12 Tourna
ment, it has as good a chance as any
other team in the conference to
come out on top and earn a trip to
the Tournament.
The Cardinal (17-13, 8-9 Pac-12)
will not need any added motivation
on Wednesday night, as it travels to
Berkeley, Calif, to take on its archri
val: the California Golden Bears (20-
9,12-5).
Stanford delivered one of its best
performances of the season the first
time these two squads faced off,
beating Cal (a team that will most
likely earn an at-large bid) 69-59.
The Bears will certainly be looking

to exact revenge in front of their
home crowd this time around, as
both teams look for a solid perform
ance in their tune-up game before
the Pac-12 Tournament.
Junior guard Allen Crabbe will
lead the way for the Bears' balanced
offensive attack. The 6-foot-6-inch
wing player uses his length to get in
to the paint; he leads Cal in scoring,
averaging 18.4 points per game on
46.5 percent shooting from the field.
Crabbe has the skill set to hurt de
fenses in a variety of ways. He is
shooting a modest 35.2 percent from
beyond the arc, and creates second
chance opportunities with his offen
sive rebounding abilities. The versa
tile NBA prospect is also averaging

six rebounds and 2.6 assists per
game to go along with his scoring
prowess.
Stanford guards sophomore
Chasson Randle and junior Aaron
Bright will have their hands full in
slowing Crabbe down.
Backcourt mate Justin Cobbs
has largely contributed to the Bears
recent success. He is leading the
team in assists, averaging 4.7 per
game and has been a solid distribu
tor for Cal. The 6-foot-3-inch guard
is also second on the team in scor
ing, averaging 14.8 points per game
on 45 percent shooting. Cobbs and
Crabbe have complimented each
other nicely this season, and will
look to continue their success
against the Card.
Stanford, currently sitting in
ninth in the conference standings,
will most likely remain in this posi
tion heading into the Pac-12 Tourna
ment. It is possible, though unlikely,
that the team will leapfrog Washing
ton and move into the eighth spot,
but this requires a win at Cal.
In order for the Card to pull off a
win at rowdy Haas Pavilion, it will
depend on the consistent play of
junior forward Dwight Powell. Pow
ell leads the Card in scoring with
15.3 ppg and 8.2 rpg. His 17 points
and nine rebounds against Cal the
first time around fueled the Jan. 19
win. Powell's dominant play has also
been matched most of the season by
Randle (14.1 ppg) and Josh Huestis

GAME NOTES: Stanford men's basketball
will attempt to complete its first sweep of
the Golden Bears since 2008 in its last
regular season game. The Card defeat
ed Cal 69-59 the first time the rivals
met this season on Jan. 19.


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Junior forward John Gage (40) has provided the Card with surges off
the bench this season when needed most. His 5.6 ppg will be
valuable for the Card as it hopes to beat the Bears for a second time.
(10.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg).
The determined offensive
mind of Powell, the speed
and defensive intensity of
Randle and the rebounding
prowess of Huestis could
give the Card a chance to
clinch a second win over Cal.
All three leaders must show

up to perform if the Card is
to accomplish this.
The Cardinal's season
has been defined by solid
basketball and missed op
portunities to this point. It
will look to reverse its fate as
it heads into postseason play.
A win against Cal tonight
will give the Card a much
needed boost heading into
the Pac-12 Tournament.
