# Crower shines in practice
## 
### SAM FISHER DESK EDITOR 
In Stanford football's first session back on
the field since Saturday's open practice, junior
quarterback Evan Crower continued to take
advantage of his extra reps caused by fifth
year senior Josh Nunes' injury.
"I thought Evan Crower did very well,"
head coach David Shaw said. "He's gotten
more reps, and what we've always said about
Evan is we know he can play, we just needed
him to practice and play with a sense of ur
gency, and he's had that, really, the last three
practices."
The six-foot five-inch left-hander from San
Diego has drawn Shaw's post-practice praise
consistently over the first spring session.
Though fellow junior Kevin Hogan is the
heavy favorite to keep his starting quarter
back job, Crower's performance could give
him the inside track for the second-string spot.
Considering the number of injuries quar
terbacks face, whoever wins the competition
for the backup job could play a big role. That
backup quarterback is always just "one play
away" from getting in the action, Shaw said.
Crower's challenge in winning that spot
will be to get his mental grasp of the offense to
match his physical capabilities. According to
Shaw, Crower is making progress in his third
year on the Farm.
"Now that he knows the offense better,
he's making quicker decisions, which helps
[his] accuracy," Shaw said. "A lot of times when
you're not sure what you're doing, you're a lit
tle bit late. Right now he's on time."
On the defensive side of the ball, fifth-year
senior outside linebacker Trent Murphy made
a splash.
"Trent Murphy decided not to be blocked
about four times today," Shaw said.
Murphy's play comes as no surprise. After
leading the Cardinal with 10 sacks and 18 tack
les for a loss in 2012, many expect Murphy to
be one of the best pass rushers in the country
in 2013.
Defensive coordinator Derek Mason's fo
cus is on adding depth to the positional groups
where he lost a few players to graduation and
the NFL Draft. Mason is looking for "position
flexibility" in the spring so he can have pieces
to move around when putting together his de
fense.
One of the interesting moves to watch by
Mason this session has been his decision to try
fifth-year senior Usua Amanam and junior

Ronnie Harris at cornerback in addition to
their usual nickelback position.
"Those guys are giving Alex Carter and
Wayne Lyons a run for their money," Mason
said. "Both those guys could step outside and
play at corner and then shift back inside and
play nickel."
In addition to receiving praise for his play
at corner from his coaches, Harris has earned
the respect of Stanford's receivers as well. On
Saturday, sophomore wide receiver Kodi Whit
field called Harris one of the toughest defend
ers to beat on the outside, high praise for a
group with three of four starters returning.
For Harris, the transition from nickel to
corner has gone smoothly. Nickelback is a bit
of a hybrid between linebacker and corner,
giving Harris some extra experience to take
with him to the outside. Harris believes the
biggest thing that he is bringing with him to
corner from nickel is "quick feet."
"You've got to always keep your feet mov
ing. Your feet can never go dead when you're
jamming somebody," Harris continued. Ac
cording to Mason, Shaw and Whitfield, those
quick feet seem to be working.
