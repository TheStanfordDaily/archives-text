# Card bounces back against Spartans
## 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
After a shocking loss to
No. IUSC on Feb. 24, the No.
2 Stanford women's water po
lo team bounced back with a
dominating 16-3 win over Cal
State-Bakersfield to open
conference play on March 2.

Six different players
scored twice for the Cardinal
(13-1, 1-0 MPSF) and four
more added a goal as Stan
ford head coach John Tanner
worked through almost his
entire lineup.
"It's important after a loss
like [the USC game] that the
team sticks together and gets
back to work and that was re
flected in how we played to
day," Tanner said. "That's
what I was most pleased with
that we played just a
strong game all the way
through and had contribu
tions from the whole team."
Stanford stalled at a slow
er pace than usual the
game was tied 1-1 until fresh
man Anna Yelizarova scored a
power-play goal with 47 sec
onds remaining in the first pe
riod.
In the second quarter,
Stanford's offense exploded,
scoring six goals while the de
fense kept the Roadrunners
without a goal.
Freshman Rachel Johnson
stalled things off with a goal
immediately following an ex
clusion call on the Roadrun
ners. Freshman Maggie Stef
fens and senior Melissa Seide
mann then fired home outside
shots to extend the lead to 5-1.
Seidemann leads the Cardinal
with 35 goals on the season.
Annika Dries, who compet-

Ed in the 2012 Olympics with
Seidemann, also got in the ac
tion with a finish from in close
late in the quarter for the first
of her two goals on the day.
The second was a lob shot in
the third quarter that arced
perfectly over the Bakersfield
goalkeeper to drop into the
net. The junior was injured in
the early part of the season,
but her return to play two
weeks ago has been a boost
for the Cardinal.
"Annika is a great player
and she can control our front
court for us, make teams re
spond to her and give us even
more of an inside presence,"
Tanner said. "Anna Yelizarova
and Melissa Seidemann have
been doing a great job of that
through the early part of the
season, so it hasn't changed
that much in terms of our ap
proach but it has added a
depth to that position and cre
ated a lot more for teams to
respond to."
Stanford's powerful attack
continued creating chances
throughout the third quarter.
Junior Kaley Dodson rocket
ed a 6-on-5 opportunity off the
crossbar, but Steffens was
there to pick up the rebound.
She worked the ball back to
Dodson who finished the goal
just as the power play expired
to give the Cardinal a 9-1 lead.
The Roadrunners then re
sponded with a mini-run of
two goals to cut the deficit to
9-3. Stanford junior Kaitlyn
Lo answered with two goals of
her own and from that point
on, no matter who was in the
pool, the Cardinal's defense
locked down and limited Bak
ersfield's opportunities to
close the game on a 7-0 run.
Freshman Melena Masson
capped the game off with her
first career goal to bring the
final tally to 16-3.
"We focused on just play
ing cohesively with a lot of dif
ferent groups in there," Tan

ner said. "We got disjointed
some last weekend, and today
we looked better organized."
Freshman Gabby Stone
and sophomore Emily Dorst
split time in net for the Cardi
nal in place of usual starter
senior Kate Baldoni. Stone
made five saves on the day
while Dorst didn't allow a goal
in two quarters of action.
"We knew that they've
both been playing great in
practice and this was an op
portunity for them to play
against a conference oppo
nent," Tanner explained.
Stanford previously defeat
ed the Roadrunners twice this
season by scores of 20-3 on Jan.
27 and 124 on Feb. 23 in non
conference matchups. Stanford
will now continue MPSF play
on March 9 at home against
No. 10 San Jose State.
The Cardinal beat the
Spartans 15-4 on Feb. 2 as
part of the Stanford Invita
tional. San Jose State brings
an 8-5 record to the matchup
after defeating UC-Santa
Barbara last weekend, but
has not played a league game
yet this year.
San Jose State's attack is
led by freshman Rae Lek
ness, who is currently third in
the MPSF with a scoring av
erage of 2.38 goals per game.
Sophomore Timi Molnar and
Anna Natalizio are also both
dangerous weapons for the
Spartans.
In goal, San Jose State
junior Maddie Reardon has
allowed 8.57 goals per game
while making just under sev
en saves per game. By con
trast, Stanford leads the
MPSF in team defense after
giving up a mere 61 goals in
14 games this season.
The match will begin on
Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Av
ery Aquatic Center.
