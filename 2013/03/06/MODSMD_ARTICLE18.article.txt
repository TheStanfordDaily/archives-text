# Ogwumike headlines All Pac-12 Team
## 
### â€”Ashley Westhem 
Junior forward Chiney
Ogwumike became the first
player in conference history
to earn both Pac-12 Player of
the Year and Defensive Play
er of the Year honors. It is her
second consecutive Defensive
honor and first Player of the
Year recognition, keeping it
within the Ogwumike family,

as her sister Nnemkadi Og
wumike 'l2 won it the past
two seasons.

"She has had a phenome
nal year. She's a great leader,"
said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "She's the real deal.
I'm really fortunate I just
love coaching her."
VanDerveer was recog
nized as Pac-12 Coach of the
Year for the 13th time.
Senior forward Joslyn
Tinkle (12.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg) and
sophomore point guard Am
ber Orrange (10.2 ppg, 4.3
apg) joined Ogwumike atop
the Pac-12, each being named
to the All Pac-12 Team for the
first time in their respective
careers.
It can be easily argued
that Ogwumike is the most
improved player in the nation.
Her presence on the court is a
huge game changer for both
the Card and its opponent.
She went from averaging 15
ppg and 10.1 rpg last season
during only 28 minutes a
game to being the only player
in the country to rank in the
national top five in scoring
(22.9 ppg), rebounding (12.7
rpg), field-goal percentage
(59.1) and double-doubles (24)
this season.
Ogwumike and Baylor's
senior forward Brittney
Griner (23.2 ppg, 8.9 rpg)
head the race for National
Player of the Year, which will
be announced in April during
the NCAA Final Four.
