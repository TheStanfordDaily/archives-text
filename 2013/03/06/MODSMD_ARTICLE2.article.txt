## Flipside seeks new Rebus whiz Candidates flock to position at satirical newspaper 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
According to the staff of the Flip
side, Stanford's weekly satirical news
paper, the most powerful person on
campus isn't President John Hennessy
or ASSU Executive Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 M.A. 'l3. Instead, true power rests
in the pen of the "puzzle master," the
Flipside staffer who creates the Rebus
puzzles and jumbles that students
solve every Monday at lunch in the
dining halls.
The Flipside hopes that the prom
ise of power attracts candidates to be
come the new puzzle master, since cur
rent puzzle designer Akiko Kozato 'l3
is set to graduate at the end of this
year. Kozato has served as puzzle mas
ter since last spring, when she took
over from Laney Kuenzel 'l2 M.S. 'l2,
who had been with the Flipside since
2009.
"The puzzles are everyone's fa
vorite part of the Flipside," said Flip
side president Conor Doherty 'l3. "So
if you get to control the answers, you
have a lot of power."
Kozato said her favorite part of be
ing the puzzle master is delivering the
Flipsides every Monday.
"I think it's hilarious that full
grown men will let out Pavlovian
squeals when they see the Flipside,"
Kozato said.
Writers and readers alike describe
puzzles as an integral part of the Flip
side.
"A lot of people honestly don't read
the articles, they just flip to the puzzles
on the back," Doherty said. "There's
raucous debate about the answer to
the Rebus puzzles, and people have
fun working on them together."
Kozato said that she often seeks in
spiration from items in her room or
tries to put a subtle theme in her puz
zles because "it's easier to come up
with ideas when there's a little restric
tion."
"I don't expect anyone to guess the
theme it's just a little more fun for
me," Kozato said. "I bet the people
who made I Spy books put all sorts of
inside jokes in there so that they could
live with themselves."
Kozato usually brings a few extra
puzzles to editorial meetings before
the staff narrows them down to the
best ones.
As she delivers the Flipside, Koza
to asks for feedback on her puzzles,
she said. According to her,
readers are generally more
vocal when they don't like her
work.
"Being a good puzzle mas
ter means you have to please
everyone, but obviously you
can't please everyone, so then
the most important skill is to
be able to come up with a new
trick every week," Kozato
said. "I always like to have
one obscure puzzle of the four
to test the waters, but some
times people don't like it."
As an example, she cited
the usage of multiple cellos to
represent the ending of the
word "Botticelli."
"People said that only peo
ple in orchestra would call cel
lo's plural 'celli,'" Kozato said.
The Flipside accepted ap
plications for the position
through last week and will de
cide on the new puzzle master
soon.

"We're having people sub
mit prospective Rebus puz
zles and jumbles and we're
going to pick whoever makes
the best ones whichever
are the most interesting or
funny or compelling," Doher
ty said. "Ideally [the candi
dates] would submit a bunch
of puzzles that are usable and
good enough to be put in the
real issue."
Kozato, who had never
made Rebus puzzles before
becoming puzzle master, said
that the keys to being a good
puzzle master are creativity
and the courage to try new
things.
"It's hard to come up with
new, good [puzzles]," Kozato
said. "You can always come
up with new ones, but not nec
essarily new, good ones."
However, when asked for
tips for the new puzzle mas
ter, Kozato demurred, saying
that whoever gets the job
should try to "forge a new
path."
"If you want to do some
thing groundbreaking, I can't
tell you how to do that," Koza

to said. "If I could give [him
or] her advice, I would be a
better puzzle master myself!"
Alec Winograd 'l5 decided
to apply to be next year's puz
zle master despite having
"completely zero" puzzle
making experience.
"Mondays at lunch are al
ways fun the Flipside
comes around and everyone
really enjoys reading the dif
ferent pieces and trying to
solve the puzzles," Winograd
said. "I always thought they
would be fun to make."
According to Winograd,
the incredible power that
comes with being Flipside
puzzle master is the job's
greatest perk.
"The puzzle master really
controls the minds of Stan
ford students," Winograd
said. "Basically if you're able
to take the whole Stanford
student body and control
their minds for five to 10 min
utes every week, that's pretty
powerful."
