## Flipside seeks new Rebus whiz Candidates flock to position at satirical newspaper 
### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
According to the staff of the Flip
side, Stanford's weekly satirical news
paper, the most powerful person on
campus isn't President John Hennessy
or ASSU Executive Robbie Zimbroff
'l2 M.A. 'l3. Instead, true power rests
in the pen of the "puzzle master," the
Flipside staffer who creates the Rebus
puzzles and jumbles that students
solve every Monday at lunch in the
dining halls.
The Flipside hopes that the prom
ise of power attracts candidates to be
come the new puzzle master, since cur
rent puzzle designer Akiko Kozato 'l3
is set to graduate at the end of this
year. Kozato has served as puzzle mas
ter since last spring, when she took
over from Laney Kuenzel 'l2 M.S. 'l2,
who had been with the Flipside since
2009.
"The puzzles are everyone's fa
vorite part of the Flipside," said Flip
side president Conor Doherty 'l3. "So
if you get to control the answers, you
have a lot of power."
Kozato said her favorite part of be
ing the puzzle master is delivering the
Flipsides every Monday.
"I think it's hilarious that full
grown men will let out Pavlovian
squeals when they see the Flipside,"
Kozato said.
Writers and readers alike describe
puzzles as an integral part of the Flip
side.
"A lot of people honestly don't read
the articles, they just flip to the puzzles
on the back," Doherty said. "There's
raucous debate about the answer to
the Rebus puzzles, and people have
fun working on them together."
Kozato said that she often seeks in
spiration from items in her room or
tries to put a subtle theme in her puz
zles because "it's easier to come up
with ideas when there's a little restric
tion."
"I don't expect anyone to guess the
theme it's just a little more fun for
me," Kozato said. "I bet the people
who made I Spy books put all sorts of
inside jokes in there so that they could
live with themselves."
Kozato usually brings a few extra
puzzles to editorial meetings before
the staff narrows them down to the
best ones.
As she delivers the Flipside, Koza
to asks for feedback on her puzzles,
