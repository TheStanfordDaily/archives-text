# Senate votes no on divestment
## Meeting attracts worldwide attention 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At their March 5 meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted against a selective divest
ment bill proposed by Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER) after three weeks of con
tentious debate on the subject.
The Senate also voted in favor of a
resolution written by senators
urging students to discuss divest
ment in other forums.
Though the Senate announced
last week that they were done dis
cussing divestment, more than
100 students packed into the Sen
ate room to further debate the is
sue, spilling into the hallway and
carrying signs with slogans such
as "Free Palestine" and "Vote for
Justice."
The bill, which was first put
forward by SPER co-president
Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3 at the
Feb. 19 Senate meeting, called for
the Senate to recommend that the
Board of Trustees reconsider cer
tain endowment investments, with
Shakir identifying eight specific
companies that allegedly "commit
human rights abuses and viola
tions of international law."
However, his presentation was
met with backlash from represen
tatives of various student groups,
who claimed that Shakir's presen
tation contained historical inaccu
racies and that the bill was a veiled
attack on Israel.
At the following meeting, the

Senate heard an opposing presen
tation from former Senator Alon
Elhanan 'l4, which was followed
by statements from numerous
student group representatives in
cluding Chabad at Stanford, Stan
ford Says No to War and the
Black Student Union.
After considering the presen
tations and speaking to student
group representatives outside the
meeting, Senators Lauren Miller
'l5, Nancy Pham 'l4, Branden
Crouch 'l4 and Daniela Olivos 'l5
drafted a separate bill that was
put on previous notice.
The bill emphasized the Sen
ate's stance against University in
vestments in companies that
cause "substantial social injury,"
urged the Advisory Panel for In
vestment Review and Licensing
(APIRL) to review all Stanford in
vestments, encouraged interested
students to approach the APIRL
about the issue and pledged to
help facilitate greater conversa
tion about divestment in the fu
ture.
"I, for one, am still far from be
ing able to make a completely ed
ucated decision on such an emo
tionally charged, complex issue,
particularly on behalf of the un
dergraduate student body," Miller
said. "We ask that you please re
spect our ultimate decision, what
ever it may be, and know that it
did not come easy and without
deep personal reflection."
Miller said that the senators tried
to acknowledge the many student
voices that the Senate heard debate
the resolution and directed students'
concerns to the "appropriate Univer
sity committee responsible for these
decisions."
A contentious meeting
On Thesday, students were given
the opportunity to comment on the
resolution and SPER's bill during a
30-minute open forum session that
began with a statement from Samar
Alqatari 'l4, one of the bill's co-au
thors.
Alqatari said that the group had
revised the bill over the weekend, re
ducing to two the number of compa
nies to consider divesting from and
adding language that recognized Is
rael's right to exist.
"It was extremely painful for us
because we think the bill came in
from an extremely encompassing lan
guage to begin with," Alqatari said.
"They are all legitimate companies to
divest from. All of these [eight] com
panies commit human rights viola
tions."
After Alqatari spoke, Senator Vi
raj Bindra 'l5 asked to take a straw
poll of the room to see who was still
opposed to the revised bill. After real
izing that not everyone had a chance
to read the bill, the Senate decided to
delay voting until photocopies of the
bill could be distributed.
While waiting for students to read
the bill, the Senate discussed a bill
concerning Suites Dining, which had
been on previous notice. The bill
written by Bindra and Daily colum
nist and Opinions Managing Editor
Miles Unterreiner 'l2 M.A. 'l3 ex
pressed the Senate's support for con
tinued student management of the
Suites Dining Clubs.
Bindra discussed a modification to
the bill, in which the language re
garding the Senate's support for the
student-run Governor's Corner Din
ing Societies' bid was made "more

vague" in order to give the Senate
more freedom.
After Bindra answered questions
about the bill from several senators,
the Senate decided to delay voting
because Unterreiner had not yet ar
rived at the meeting.
The Senate also put two bills on
previous notice, both of which are
amendments to the ASSU Constitu
tion proposed by ASSU Executive
candidates Billy Gallagher 'l4 and
Dan Ashton 'l4. Gallagher is a Daily
staffer, and Ashton is a member of
The Daily's Board of Directors.
Both amendments will be voted
on at next week's meeting, and two
thirds of the Senate will have to vote
to approve in order for the amend
ments to be placed on the ballot. If
two-thirds of the student body votes
to approve the amendments, they
will be added to the Constitution.
If passed, the first amendment
would place the approximately
$lOO,OOO collected in unspent stu
dent activities fees each year into a
new fund called the "President's Un
dergraduate Discretionary Rmding
Account."
The ASSU President would be
encouraged to allocate the entirety
of these funds to groups hosting
"major annual traditions" and to
new initiatives and programs that
"do not have sufficient funding op
portunities."
Director of Student Activities
and Leadership Nanci Howe ex
pressed concern over the potential
consequences of the amendment and
said that the Senate should consult
with student groups before voting.
"It seems to me that the constitu
tional amendment is a pretty high
bar for a change that seems fairly
sudden," Howe said. "I think it has
some potential consequence to stu
dent groups and to the ASSU's bot
tom line that I haven't even gotten
my head around."
The second amendment would
reserve a maximum of five Senate
seats for upperclassmen in order to
"increase upper-class interest in
running for Senate and create a
more equitable representation of
our student interests."
Several senators took issue with

this amendment, questioning whether
or not it would be fair to reserve five
seats for upperclassmen when a rising
sophomore candidate with more votes
might then be denied a Senate spot.
Gallagher argued that while the
amendment would not necessarily
be the most fair for each individual
candidate, it would be best for the
Senate and student body as a whole.
Further debate
Senators then returned to the di
vestment bill, with Elections Com
missioner Brianna Pang 'l3 speak
ing on behalf of the APIRL. Pang
said that regardless of the Senate's
vote, the APIRL would investigate
the University's investments if stu
dents submit a request for review on
the APIREs website.
"The structures are already in
place, and I highly encourage people
to use them," Pang said. "No matter
how the Senate votes tonight, I think
this conversation will continue."
The Senate resumed the heated
30-minute open forum, with stu
dents given two minutes each to
speak about the divestment bill.
Shakir spoke first and took issue
with Pang's statement that the
APIRL was the best forum for dis
cussing divestment.
"Referring this decision to the
APIRL is the equivalent of what the
United States did in the Constitu
tional Convention when it defined
African-Americans as three-fifths of
a person because it refused to take
the tough moral stand," Shakir said.
"We will win."
Following Shakir's statement,
Jason Lupatkin 'l3 spoke in opposi
tion to the bill and said that the bill's
authors were attempting to make
the senators "abuse [their] role as
voices of the student body."
"What you have before you is a
bill that is asking you senators to
vote on an issue that is currently di
viding political governments all over
the world," Lupatkin said. "I urge
you to recognize that your job as AS
SU senators is to unite this campus."
Students from both sides of the
issue spoke during the open forum.
Some gave personal testimonies
about how the Israel-Palestine con

flict has affected their families in the
tense discussion, during which stu
dents yelled, interrupted each other
and cried.
While many students attempted
to sway the Senate to vote one way
or another, Elhanan 'l4 asked the
Senate to abstain from voting.
"[SPER] cares about you 15 [sen
ators] making a statement demoniz
ing only one side in this conflict, and
they will do it in any way that they
can," Elhanan said. "You cannot pos
sibly represent the entire student
body if you choose one side over an
other."
After ending open forum, the
Senate took a two-minute recess.
Bindra conducted another straw
poll, asking senators whether they
would prefer to vote on the bill im
mediately and the resolution next
week, vote on the bill and the resolu
tion immediately or table both for
next week. Ten out of 13 senators
voted to decide on both the bill and
the resolution at this week's meet
ing.
Senators then spent another
hour asking specific questions of the
bill's co-authors and others present
at the meeting before voting.
Senator Ismael Menjivar 'l5 rec
ommended that the Senate hold a
blind vote on paper slips, which Sen
ator Kimberly Bacon 'l5 opposed.
"People have the right to know
what my opinion is and how I'm rep
resenting them," Bacon said.
Senators then debated again
whether or not the bill should be vot
ed on at the meeting.
"If everyone is comfortable with
voting, I want to go ahead and vote,"
said Senator Christos Haveles 'l5. "I
don't want anyone to feel like time is
a limitation, that we've been racing
against the clock."
Bindra held another straw poll on
whether senators wanted to have a
blind vote, which a majority of sena
tors opposed.
The Senate asked eveiyone pres
ent at the meeting to not record the
vote, which several students contested.
"Under California law this is a
public event and I can record it," said
Ilya Mouzykantskii 'l6. "Tens of
thousands of people care about this

vote right now."
SPER's bill did not pass, with sev
en senators in opposition, five ab
staining and one in support of the bill.
Senator Janhavi Vartak 'l5 voted
in favor. Senators Anna Brezhneva
'l5, Brandon Hightower 'l5, Garima
Sharma 'l5, Bindra, Miller, Olivos
and Pham voted against. Senators
Shahab Fadavi 'l5, Bacon, Crouch,
Haveles and Menjivar abstained.
The Senate then voted to suspend
the rules of order to vote on the reso
lution, and the resolution was ap
proved with eight votes of support
and five senators abstaining.
SOCC-driven activism
After the meeting, former ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 sent an
email to the SPER mailing list ex
pressing his disappointment with the
Senate's vote on SPER's bill.
"The fact that a SOCC-dominated
Senate couldn't muster the courage
to do something rings true to this
central truth SOCC has lost its
radical core," Cruz said in the email.
"This action proves to me that our re
cruitment process is fundamentally
flawed. It must be changed now if the
ASSU is ever to become the bastion
of student activism that it once was."
Following the vote on the resolu
tion, senators directed questions to
Unterreiner about the Suites bill and
whether or not he has made progress
in his dialogue with Residential Edu
cation (ResEd).
Unterreiner said that it was "kind
of unclear exactly what's going to
happen" with ResEd, as ResEd has
agreed to allow students to re-incor
porate as a non-profit and submit a
bid for running Suites Dining next
year.
"It's not clear that students are
going to get that contact, so it is still
important for the Senate and the stu
dent body to voice their support for
students as they seek that contact,
but it is definitely improvement," Un
terreiner said.
After a short question and answer
session, the Senate unanimously
passed the Suites bill.
