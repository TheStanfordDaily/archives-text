# Senate votes no on divestment
## Meeting attracts worldwide attention 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
At their March 5 meeting, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted against a selective divest
ment bill proposed by Students
for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER) after three weeks of con
tentious debate on the subject.
The Senate also voted in favor of a
resolution written by senators
urging students to discuss divest
ment in other forums.
Though the Senate announced
last week that they were done dis
cussing divestment, more than
100 students packed into the Sen
ate room to further debate the is
sue, spilling into the hallway and
carrying signs with slogans such
as "Free Palestine" and "Vote for
Justice."
The bill, which was first put
forward by SPER co-president
Omar Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3 at the
Feb. 19 Senate meeting, called for
the Senate to recommend that the
Board of Trustees reconsider cer
tain endowment investments, with
Shakir identifying eight specific
companies that allegedly "commit
human rights abuses and viola
tions of international law."
However, his presentation was
met with backlash from represen
tatives of various student groups,
who claimed that Shakir's presen
tation contained historical inaccu
racies and that the bill was a veiled
attack on Israel.
At the following meeting, the

Senate heard an opposing presen
tation from former Senator Alon
Elhanan 'l4, which was followed
by statements from numerous
student group representatives in
cluding Chabad at Stanford, Stan
ford Says No to War and the
Black Student Union.
After considering the presen
tations and speaking to student
group representatives outside the
meeting, Senators Lauren Miller
'l5, Nancy Pham 'l4, Branden
Crouch 'l4 and Daniela Olivos 'l5
drafted a separate bill that was
put on previous notice.
The bill emphasized the Sen
ate's stance against University in
vestments in companies that
cause "substantial social injury,"
urged the Advisory Panel for In
vestment Review and Licensing
(APIRL) to review all Stanford in
vestments, encouraged interested
students to approach the APIRL
about the issue and pledged to
help facilitate greater conversa
tion about divestment in the fu
ture.
"I, for one, am still far from be
ing able to make a completely ed
ucated decision on such an emo
tionally charged, complex issue,
particularly on behalf of the un
dergraduate student body," Miller
said. "We ask that you please re
spect our ultimate decision, what
ever it may be, and know that it
did not come easy and without
deep personal reflection."
