## Stanford in Government looks to boost stipends 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Stanford in Government (SIG) approach
es its 50th anniversary this summer, leaders of
the public service group have cited the occasion
as a significant opportunity for fundraising ef
forts to boost SlG's fledgling stipend program.
Elsewhere, SlG's fellowship program sus
tained a strong level of student interest from
previous years, garnering 333 applications for
36 fellowships. The most popular fellowship op
portunity received 26 applications, though SIG
declined to identify that fellowship out of con
cern for the potential to prejudice future appli
cation pools.

Burgeoning stipends
SlG's stipend program, which is now enter
ing its second year, was first conceived in re

sponse to a 2011 undergraduate survey that
found that most SIG fellowships had been
awarded to students with previous internship
experience and from majors such as public pol
icy, economics and political science. According
to SIG chair Elise Timtim 'l3, the survey
prompted concerns about unnecessarily limit
ing opportunities for the student body as a
whole.
"We feel that the SIG fellowship program
really preferences these really committed polit
ical science and public policy majors, who know
for a while what they are interested in, so that
makes these nontraditional major students a
little bit disadvantaged in the process," Timtim
said. "We want to make sure that both audi
ences' needs are addressed."
Tenzin Sonam Atruktsang 'l4, who was part
of the first class of SIG stipend recipients last
year and who worked in the Central Tibetan

Administration's Department of Health, ap
plauded the stipend program's purpose.
"Being a biology major, as in any major, you
get exposure mainly to your own field of study,'
Atruktsang said. "I think the SIG stipend pro
gram allows me to explore other fields where I
get to use my own knowledge in biology to have,
obviously little, but some impact on policy."
Last year, 10 other students from a wide va
riety of majors, ranging from French to earth
systems, were selected from a pool of 43 appli
cants. The average endowment amount each
student received was $4,500, according to Lina
Hidalgo 'l3, SlG's vice chair of expansion.
Four applicants have already been offered
stipends this year, ranging from $4,000 to
$6,100 in value. Seven more applicants will be
selected by the April 1 deadline.
