## Stanford in Government looks to boost stipends 
### HELIN GAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As Stanford in Government (SIG) approach
es its 50th anniversary this summer, leaders of
the public service group have cited the occasion
as a significant opportunity for fundraising ef
forts to boost SlG's fledgling stipend program.
Elsewhere, SlG's fellowship program sus
tained a strong level of student interest from
previous years, garnering 333 applications for
36 fellowships. The most popular fellowship op
portunity received 26 applications, though SIG
declined to identify that fellowship out of con
cern for the potential to prejudice future appli
cation pools.

Burgeoning stipends
SlG's stipend program, which is now enter
ing its second year, was first conceived in re

sponse to a 2011 undergraduate survey that
found that most SIG fellowships had been
awarded to students with previous internship
experience and from majors such as public pol
icy, economics and political science. According
to SIG chair Elise Timtim 'l3, the survey
prompted concerns about unnecessarily limit
ing opportunities for the student body as a
whole.
"We feel that the SIG fellowship program
really preferences these really committed polit
ical science and public policy majors, who know
for a while what they are interested in, so that
makes these nontraditional major students a
little bit disadvantaged in the process," Timtim
said. "We want to make sure that both audi
ences' needs are addressed."
Tenzin Sonam Atruktsang 'l4, who was part
of the first class of SIG stipend recipients last
year and who worked in the Central Tibetan

Administration's Department of Health, ap
plauded the stipend program's purpose.
"Being a biology major, as in any major, you
get exposure mainly to your own field of study,'
Atruktsang said. "I think the SIG stipend pro
gram allows me to explore other fields where I
get to use my own knowledge in biology to have,
obviously little, but some impact on policy."
Last year, 10 other students from a wide va
riety of majors, ranging from French to earth
systems, were selected from a pool of 43 appli
cants. The average endowment amount each
student received was $4,500, according to Lina
Hidalgo 'l3, SlG's vice chair of expansion.
Four applicants have already been offered
stipends this year, ranging from $4,000 to
$6,100 in value. Seven more applicants will be
selected by the April 1 deadline.
SIG also recently ob
tained permission from the
University's Office of Devel
opment to raise funds to sup
port up to 40 stipends in fu
ture years.
"[Last year] some of the
funding was for particular
sectors of public policy or po
litical geographical location,"
Hidalgo said. "This year the
funding was just for the pro
gram itself. Therefore, we
definitely have more funding
ability."
According to Hidalgo,
$lOO,OOO has already been
raised for the stipend pro
gram this year.
"We've had numerous do
nations, mainly from SIG
alums," Timtim said. "We al
so have this support from
faculty on campus. We've
been pleasantly surprised
about how fundraising is go
ing, but we are still being
very aggressive about
fundraising."
Celebrating 50 years
According to Timtim,
SIG hopes to use its 50th an
niversary celebration this
summer as a platform for
further stipend fundraising.
The yearlong celebration,
which kicked off last fall dur
ing a reunion homecoming
panel discussion on young
people in public service that
was moderated by Hoover
Institution senior fellow Lar
ry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO, will feature a se
ries of alumni webinars and
regional reunions and will
culminate in a gala in the Na

tional Building Museum in
Washington, D.C., on June
19.
"The idea was really to
build momentum and get
people excited about the 50th
in the summer," Timtim said.
According to Timtim, the
main difficulty of organizing
the event which SIG ex
pects 100 to 200 alumni to at
tend — lies in planning it
from afar.
"It's kind of difficult to
plan an event that is this for
mal and of this magnitude
from California," Timtim
said.

She noted, however, the
potential to re-engage SIG
alumni with whom the group
might otherwise have lost
touch.
"Some people estimate
that maybe we have [had] as
many as 4,000 SIG fellows
over the past 50 years," Tim
tim said. "The fact that we
are not quite sure about the
number shows that we have
so many alums that we don't
know where a lot of them are
and what they are doing."

tained permission from the
University's Office of Devel
opment to raise funds to sup
port up to 40 stipends in fu
ture years.
"[Last year] some of the
funding was for particular
sectors of public policy or po
litical geographical location,"
Hidalgo said. "This year the
funding was just for the pro
gram itself. Therefore, we
definitely have more funding
ability."
According to Hidalgo,
$lOO,OOO has already been
raised for the stipend pro
gram this year.
"We've had numerous do
nations, mainly from SIG
alums," Timtim said. "We al
so have this support from
faculty on campus. We've
been pleasantly surprised
about how fundraising is go
ing, but we are still being
very aggressive about
fundraising."
Celebrating 50 years
According to Timtim,
SIG hopes to use its 50th an
niversary celebration this
summer as a platform for
further stipend fundraising.
The yearlong celebration,
which kicked off last fall dur
ing a reunion homecoming
panel discussion on young
people in public service that
was moderated by Hoover
Institution senior fellow Lar
ry Diamond '73 M.A. '7B
Ph.D. 'BO, will feature a se
ries of alumni webinars and
regional reunions and will
culminate in a gala in the Na

tional Building Museum in
Washington, D.C., on June
19.
"The idea was really to
build momentum and get
people excited about the 50th
in the summer," Timtim said.
According to Timtim, the
main difficulty of organizing
the event which SIG ex
pects 100 to 200 alumni to at
tend — lies in planning it
from afar.
"It's kind of difficult to
plan an event that is this for
mal and of this magnitude
from California," Timtim
said.

She noted, however, the
potential to re-engage SIG
alumni with whom the group
might otherwise have lost
touch.
"Some people estimate
that maybe we have [had] as
many as 4,000 SIG fellows
over the past 50 years," Tim
tim said. "The fact that we
are not quite sure about the
number shows that we have
so many alums that we don't
know where a lot of them are
and what they are doing."
