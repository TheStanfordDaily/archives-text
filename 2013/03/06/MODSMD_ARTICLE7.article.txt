"I'm worried about anyone who
could end civilization and not just
about certain nations," reflected
Martin Hellman M.S. '67 Ph.D. '69,
professor emeritus of electrical en
gineering, on nuclear weapons.
To the broader world, Hellman
may be best known for his inven

which underpins modern telecom
munications security. For current
students, however, he is perhaps
most closely associated with his ef
forts towards spreading awareness
about nuclear threats on campus.
For the past few years, Hellman
has gone from dorm to dorm putting
up posters to advertise his website,
Nuclear√üisk.org, which provides in
formation about how students can
get involved in reducing the threat
of nuclear weapons through grass
roots advocacy.
