## Prof, spreads awareness of nuclear issues 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"I'm worried about anyone who
could end civilization and not just
about certain nations," reflected
Martin Hellman M.S. '67 Ph.D. '69,
professor emeritus of electrical en
gineering, on nuclear weapons.
To the broader world, Hellman
may be best known for his inven
tion of public-key cryptography,
which underpins modern telecom
munications security. For current
students, however, he is perhaps
most closely associated with his ef
forts towards spreading awareness
about nuclear threats on campus.
For the past few years, Hellman
has gone from dorm to dorm putting
up posters to advertise his website,
Nuclearßisk.org, which provides in
formation about how students can
get involved in reducing the threat
of nuclear weapons through grass
roots advocacy.
Matthew Colford 'l4, who lived
ter's and doctorate degrees
on the Farm, Hellman re
turned to the East Coast to
work at IBM and later
taught engineering at Mas
sachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. In 1971 Hellman re
turned to Stanford as a pro
fessor, a position he held un
til he became professor
emeritus in 1996 after 25
years on the job.
Hellman commented that
his interest in cryptography
came out of interactions he
had while working at IBM in
the late 19605.
"I went to IBM Research
immediately after my Ph.D.
because my thesis broke so
quickly that I didn't have
time to look for a teaching
job," he said. "IBM was in
the forefront, really, of com
mercial encryption."
Hellman said he had been
working one night on devel
oping an algorithm involving
a string of data to be trans
mitted from a sender and re
cipient with two different
keys, an idea that stemmed
from an earlier conversation
with coworkers. After check
ing his work on an HP-40 cal
culator, the math seemed to
work out and his invention
snowballed from there.
"IBM was spending mon
ey and resources on this
[idea], and so I foresaw a
need for this as computers
and information communica
tion became more married,"
he said.
After gaining wide recog
nition in the field of cryptog
raphy, Hellman developed
his interest in nuclear non
proliferation, a field intro
duced to him by his wife.
"Around 1980, she got in
terested in these ideas and
then brought me along," he
said. "We both got convinced
that a single caring individ
ual could make a difference

in Florence Moore Hall as a
freshman, was encouraged
by Hellman to promote nu
clear awareness among his
dormmates.
"He was great to meet,"
Colford said of Hellman. "He
was very passionate, and as
a freshman, meeting some
one like him was a fascinat
ing experience I was in
awe."
Even with such a diverse
range of interests, Hellman
emphasized the continuity in
his experiences, framing his
invention of public-key cryp
tography —in collaboration
with Whitfield Diffie and
Ralph Merkle Ph.D. '79 in
the context of his sustained
interest in engineering,
which started at an early
age.
"I liked knowing how
everything worked," he said.
"I took my bike apart down
to the ball bearings as a
child, and once I found out
about engineering, it made
sense [to study it]."
After finishing high
school in his native New
York City, Hellman decided
to pursue engineering on a
scholarship at New York
University. After finishing
his degree in 1966, he came
to Stanford to continue his
studies, a decision he said
was easy to make.
"It wasn't so much Stan
ford, but rather, it was Cali
fornia in the 19605," Hell
man said. "It had some kind
of an aura around it, which
certainly has been borne out
it is a land of opportunity
in ways that the place I grew
up in was not."
After receiving his mas-

in this world of ours. One of
the partners at my wife's
firm invited me to come to a
meeting of a group called
Creative Initiative, which
was pushing for this idea."
As the two became more
and more invested in their
pet project and as the events
of the late 20th century un
folded, Hellman came to
view nuclear weapons as an
increasingly dangerous
threat that warranted
heightened attention in the
academic community.
"As we researched, we
concluded that we could not
separate the nuclear threat
from the threat of war it
self," he said. "We concluded
we would never get rid of nu
clear weapons or the threat
of nuclear weapons, and the
most likely trigger for a nu
clear war would be some
global hotspot."
In an effort to promote
awareness among students
on campus, Hellman teaches
STS 152: Nuclear Weapons,
Risk and Hope. The course
deals with the concept of
combating nuclear threats.
Hellman clarified that his
research has not only fo
cused on nuclear nonprolif
eration, but also on the con
trol and elimination of the
weapons already available.
"One thing I am doing
there is to study how risky it
is to rely on nuclear
weapons for our security,"
he said. "I do feel that nu
clear weapons have length

ened the time between wars,
but I don't think that they
have eliminated the threat
entirely."
Even as his career tilts
away from his background
in electrical engineering,
Hellman has continued to
gain plaudits for his work in
cryptography, including in
duction into the Silicon Val
ley Hall of Fame earlier this
year.
Hellman posited that
there is a place for both his
passions cryptography
and awareness of nuclear
threats in Silicon Valley.
"Silicon Valley epitomizes
new ideas, interesting
ideas," he said. "One of the
things that was particularly
meaningful about [my
award] is the role that Sili
con Valley plays rewarding
what I call foolishness it
rewards people who do crazy
things."

We could not separate the
nuclear threat from the threat
of war itself.
