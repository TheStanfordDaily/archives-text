# Peace and a pigskin on the Manz lawn
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
This week I'm going to tiy
something different. This
column isn't coming to you
from a one-room double in
Lantana or the Tennan En
gineering Library in Huang, but from
the Main Quad, empty on a Riesday
morning save for the chirps of birds
and the laughs of tourists. (One just
gave me a thumbs up!)
It's week nine, and we're all buried
below both the academic challenges we
so often share with others and the per
sonal struggles we wish we could be
more open about. A little bit of peace is
a lot harder to find right about now.
That's why I'm sitting on one of
these oversized flowerpots (treepots?),
not the stone-hard wooden chair my
room is outfitted with. Instead of per
fect pixels, I'm writing in improvisato
ry ink, smearing a whole lot of it along
the way
Yet as this is still a spoils column, I
can't get carried away—fine, more
carried away with my current
feeling of Zen. So I'm going to talk
about something equally peaceful
that some friends and I have been
doing a whole lot of lately: tossing
around a football.
It doesn't sound earth shattering,
and you're probably doubting
whether something so simple merits
the time it takes you to read 700
words. But there's no better study
break than spending half an hour in
the sun, losing yourself in a terra
cotta ellipsoid with a couple of
friends. It's more active than watch
ing pro sports, more laid-back than
playing for an IM team and, if done
right, less frustrating than either.
I must admit that my football
tossing days almost came to an end
early, like with practically every oth
er sport I've ever played. One night
at The Daily's office, I tried to strip
the ball from football editor Sam
Fisher, an actual former player. I
missed by about three feet, cutting
him just below the eye (and breaking
a fingernail!).
But after I had served my self
imposed, two-week suspension for
the incident, I gave it another shot
after lunch on Friday. The going was
rough, my hands still greasy from
Manz's soggy potato chips, and it's
taken a few more afternoon sessions
of catch for me to find any sem
blance of a spiral. But I've found out
quite a lot about the friends I'm
throwing with in the process.
My freshman-year roommate,
for example, grew up watching a dif
ferent kind of football south of the
border. But he still throws a decep
tively tight spiral.
My best friend, who can't serve a
tennis ball anymore since he shat
tered his elbow as a kid, can still air
mail the pigskin over my head in an
attempt to show me up.
Even Sam, the offensive lineman
at heart who is still getting back to
top form after that debilitating up
per-cheek laceration, can roll out
better than your average student
group in a fall-quarter freshman
dorm.

As for me? Well, I'm a bit of a
Josh Nunes: great deep ball, no con
trol underneath and an injury al
most certainly in my future.
When there are too many of us to
simply play catch, we split up into
teams and run plays but not the
way you'd expect. We rotate quar
terbacks, each one getting just a sin
gle play (read: Hail Mary). You
choose your receivers, you choose
their routes and then you get mad at
your favorite Thursday sports
columnist when he can't tell a hitch
from a post. It's all part of the fun.
So if you came here looking for
the usual soapboxing about why
hockey is the best thing, like, ever,
sentimental musings from a life-long
Stanford fan or semi-original analy
sis of some startling event in the
sporting world I'm sorry to disap
point. I've been too busy worrying
about how Sam is going to get his re
venge for that cheap shot, working
on my "spiral" to de-stress before fi
nals and finding some inner peace by
playing catch on the lawn in front of
Manzanita Dining to think of any
thing more profound to write about.

Joseph Bey da, while writing this col
umn, suffered a hallucination that
involved Sam popping out of nowhere
with a weighted football ready to
beam him —it was really just a
tourist asking for a picture. Express
your sympathy for or amusement
