## CARD BEATS CAL DESPITE ALTERCATION 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are some games where
records just don't matter. Tourna
ment seeding, March Madness im
plications, momentum swings
you name it, but none of it matters.
These are rivalry games, and when
the Stanford Cardinal rolls into
Berkeley to take on the California
Golden Bears, all bets are off.
Cal and Stanford have gone in
opposite directions in recent weeks.
While the Cardinal saw its chances
of earning an at-large bid in the
NCAA tournament deteriorate af
ter losing live out of seven games,
while the Bears had rebounded from
a tough loss to Arizona State on Feb.
7 by winning seven games in a row,
including upsets over Arizona,
UCLA, and Oregon. However, after
tip off, none of this mattered.

The Cardinal dominated in the
second half, building a 19-point lead
and surviving a late-game brawl
that saw four Stanford assistant
coaches and senior Gabe Harris
ejected. Though the Bears tried to
build some momentum from the al
tercation to close out their Senior
Night, Stanford (18-14, 9-9 Pac-12)
held on for the statement win
against Cal (20-10,12-6), 83-70.
"We wanted to prove we're tough
too," said sophomore guard Chasson
Randle, "and I think we did that."
Junior guard Justin Cobbs
helped Cal jump out to an early lead,
knocking down a pah- of jump shots.
Stanford guard Aaron Bright re
sponded by making a jumper of his
own to put Stanford on the board.
The two squads then traded baskets
until Randle knocked down a 3-
pointer to give Stanford its first lead
of the game (12-10) with 14:57 re
maining in the first half.
The Cardinal managed to hold
onto this slim advantage until Cal's
Ricky Kreklow forced Randle into a
turnover, leading to an Allen Crabbe
basket on the fast break. Stanford's
Josh Huestis then stole the lead
right back, knocking down a 3-point
er on the next possession to put the
Cardinal up 20-18. A couple of
jumpers from juniors Dwight Powell

and Bright then stretched Stan
ford's lead to 26-20 with 7:50 to play,
the team's biggest of the first half.
Powell then picked up an unnec
essary foul, forcing him to the bench
with 6:30 remaining in the half. Cal
tried to take advantage of his ab
sence and mount a comeback. Cobbs
knocked down a three, but Randle
responded by nailing one from be
yond the arc on the next possession.
The Card held onto a five-point lead
heading into the last possession be
fore the break, but Allen Crabbe
found David Kravish under the bas
ket for an easy score, cutting Stan
ford's lead to 34-31 at halftime.
Stanford, despite being a heavy
underdog, came out of the break
with a newfound confidence. Powell
found redshirt junior Andy Brown
cutting to the basket for an easy
layup with 17:08 to play, extending
Stanford's lead to 43-35. California
forward Richard Solomon then
picked up his fourth foul on the next
possession, forcing him to the bench
early in the second half.
The Cardinal grabbed a double
digit lead after Josh Huestis and
John Gage each knocked down a

pair of free throws, and Cal head
coach Mike Montgomery called a
timeout with his team down 47-35.
It was to no avail, as the Cardinal
continued to dominate the Bears on
both ends of the court. A frustrated
Montgomery then took his anger
out on the referees, drawing a tech
nical foul.
Stanford kept its foot on the gas
pedal for the next few minutes. Ran
dle, unimpeded by the hand in his
face, knocked down a three pointer
to put Stanford up 56-37 with 13:20
to play.
However, the Bears began to find
the offensive rhythm that had
helped them win seven games in a
row, as Cobbs knocked down a pair
of free throws and Crabbe chipped
in a 3-pointer. Stanford quickly re
sponded, as Josh Huestis knocked
down a three of his own. Randle then
made another shot from behind the
arc to give Stanford a 64-46 lead
with 8:31 to play.
Things got ugly around the five
minute mark after Aaron Bright
dove for a loose ball. Crabbe then
jumped onto Bright, attempting to
strip the ball.

After the whistles sounded, Pow
ell tried to separate the pair but in
advertently elbowed Crabbe, send
ing the Cal star to the ground and
sparking an altercation. Huestis got
involved and both head coaches im
mediately rushed to the floor, hoping
to keep things out of hand. Four
Stanford assistant coaches in
cluding former Cardinal player
Mark Madsen were ejected along
with Harris, while one Cal player
and one Cal coach were also tossed.
A total of six players received per
sonal fouls.
"Emotions ran high," said Stan
ford head coach Johnny Dawkins.
"It's a rivalry game with a lot on the
line for both teams. I don't think
anybody did anything flagrant. It's
just unfortunate."
According to a Pac-12 spokesper
son, none of the players were eject
ed for fighting so no automatic sus
pensionsâ€”which would have kept
the guilty party out of the first game
of the Pac-12 Tournament were
incurred.

Stanford junior Dwight Powell defends a drive by California's Allen Crabbe during the first half at Haas
Pavilion on Wednesday night. Powell was at the center of a second-half altercation that saw players and
coaches from both teams ejected, but the Cardinal held onto its large lead to knock off the Bears 83-70.
Cal find a rhythm, it was too little too late
for a Golden Bears team that could not
get it going offensively for the first 36
minutes. Stanford won 83-70, proving to
the rest of the Pac-12 that it is a real
threat to win the upcoming conference
tournament.
Randle and Huestis led the way for
the Cardinal in their most impressive
performances of the season. Randle
scored 20 points on 7-for-10 shooting be
fore fouling out. Huestis was not far be
hind, pitching in with 18 points of his own.
The pair combined to shoot 4-of-6 from
beyond the arc.
The Cardinal's only chance of earning
a trip to the 2013 NCAA Tournament is
winning the conference tournament. Af
ter watching this performance, there is no
reason to believe that this is unrealistic.
