# RANKING WRECKED

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 18 Stanford lacrosse
team fell flat in its quest to defeat a
second-straight ranked opponent
when it fell to No. 11 Georgetown 15-
8 on Tbesday evening at Cagan Sta
dium.
Stanford had broken into the na
tional rankings for the first time this
season after a win over previous-No.
13 Ohio State, but was unable to
keep the momentum going against
an aggressive Hoyas squad.

Early in the game, the Cardinal
(2-2) took a 3-1 lead behind goals
from juniors Rachel Ozer and Anna
Kim and sophomore Kyle Eraser.
However, after Stanford sophomore
Hannah Farr scored a free-position
shot to make it 4-2 halfway through
the first half, Georgetown burst out
with a 7-1 scoring run. From that
point on, the Cardinal would never
challenge despite four goals on the
game from Ozer.
"[Georgetown] is a great team
and it just wasn't our day maybe
coming back from the road trip, I'm
not sure what it was," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker. "I thought
they totally outsmarted us and in ar
eas were outworking us, so that's
what we've got to get back to the
drawing board on."
Both teams and the sparse but
passionate crowd expressed frustra
tion with the referees in a game that
was heated and physical in the first
half.
Hoyas sophomore Caroline Tarz
ian posted a game-high five goals, in
cluding three in the first half. Ozer
was able to break the Hoyas' streak
with a free-position goal with 3:11
left in the half, but Tarzian bookend
ed halftime with two goals of her own
to keep momentum firmly in George

town's control.
Ten minutes into the second half,
Ozer assisted a goal by freshman
Meg Lentz that cut the deficit to 10-
7. But less than 30 seconds later,
Georgetown responded with a clever
passing sequence that set up a point
blank shot to spark another five-goal
run. Stanford had just one goal over

the final 20 minutes of play, an essen
tially meaningless tally by Ozer with
6:52 remaining.

tack that consistently created
scoring opportunities. Stan
ford's offense was unable to
do the same at the other end
of the field and was also
plagued by a poor shooting
percentage.
"We're going to work on

our shooting and taking care
of the ball in general," Bokker
said. "Our ball movement on
attack has been a focus for us
all year making sure we
have a seven-player attack
and it's not everything going
through one person."
Compounding Stanford's
problems was an inability to
maintain control of the ball,
something that has been a
strength for the team in pre
vious games this season. The
Cardinal lost 15 of 25 draw
controls and turned the ball
over 16 times.
"We weren't on top of
draw controls today, so that
was something we're going to
focus on going forward,"
Bokker said. "We were play
ing defense probably 75 per
cent of that second half."
Stanford will take a day to
rest on Wednesday before
turning its focus to two big
matchups this weekend.
On Friday afternoon, the

Cardinal will play USC for its
MPSF opener. The Women of
Troy are 3-3 in their inaugural
season of varsity play, with
wins against Presbyterian,
Saint Mary's College and
LIU Brooklyn. In its last time
out, USC lost to Princeton 18-
13 on March 3.
As a first-year program,
USC's roster is made up al
most entirely of underclass
men. The team's leading scor
er is freshman Caroline de
Lyra, who has tallied 21 goals
and 15 assists this year, in
cluding 8 goals against the
Tigers. Four other players
have point totals in double fig
ures for the season.
Freshman Liz Shaeffer
has started every game in
goal for the Women of Troy
this year. Shaeffer is averag
ing 8.67 saves per game, good
for second in the MPSF.
After facing off against its
SoCal rival, the Cardinal will
take on Temple on Sunday at

1 p.m. The Owls are undefeat
ed in four games this season,
but they have also yet to play
away from home.
Offensively, Temple boasts
a balanced attack —l5 play
ers have posted goals this
season while no single player
has more than nine goals.
The Owls have also shared
the load in net, where red
shirt freshman Jaqi Kakale
cik and senior Meghan Cloth
ier have split the majority of
the time. As a team, Temple
has held opponents to 7.75
goals per game.
Both games will take place
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
"We want to focus on win
ning a conference champi
onship, and [this weekend] is
the first step to doing that,"
Bokker told GoStanford.com.
"We'll come out fired up and
ready to play USC on Friday."

of the field and was also
plagued by a poor shooting
percentage.
"We're going to work on

our shooting and taking care
of the ball in general," Bokker
said. "Our ball movement on
attack has been a focus for us
all year making sure we
have a seven-player attack
and it's not everything going
through one person."
Compounding Stanford's
problems was an inability to
maintain control of the ball,
something that has been a
strength for the team in pre
vious games this season. The
Cardinal lost 15 of 25 draw
controls and turned the ball
over 16 times.
"We weren't on top of
draw controls today, so that
was something we're going to
focus on going forward,"
Bokker said. "We were play
ing defense probably 75 per
cent of that second half."
Stanford will take a day to
rest on Wednesday before
turning its focus to two big
matchups this weekend.
On Friday afternoon, the

Cardinal will play USC for its
MPSF opener. The Women of
Troy are 3-3 in their inaugural
season of varsity play, with
wins against Presbyterian,
Saint Mary's College and
LIU Brooklyn. In its last time
out, USC lost to Princeton 18-
13 on March 3.
As a first-year program,
USC's roster is made up al
most entirely of underclass
men. The team's leading scor
er is freshman Caroline de
Lyra, who has tallied 21 goals
and 15 assists this year, in
cluding 8 goals against the
Tigers. Four other players
have point totals in double fig
ures for the season.
Freshman Liz Shaeffer
has started every game in
goal for the Women of Troy
this year. Shaeffer is averag
ing 8.67 saves per game, good
for second in the MPSF.
After facing off against its
SoCal rival, the Cardinal will
take on Temple on Sunday at

1 p.m. The Owls are undefeat
ed in four games this season,
but they have also yet to play
away from home.
Offensively, Temple boasts
a balanced attack —l5 play
ers have posted goals this
season while no single player
has more than nine goals.
The Owls have also shared
the load in net, where red
shirt freshman Jaqi Kakale
cik and senior Meghan Cloth
ier have split the majority of
the time. As a team, Temple
has held opponents to 7.75
goals per game.
Both games will take place
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
"We want to focus on win
ning a conference champi
onship, and [this weekend] is
the first step to doing that,"
Bokker told GoStanford.com.
"We'll come out fired up and
ready to play USC on Friday."

The No. 18 Stanford lacrosse
team fell flat in its quest to defeat a
second-straight ranked opponent
when it fell to No. 11 Georgetown 15-
8 on Tbesday evening at Cagan Sta
dium.
Stanford had broken into the na
tional rankings for the first time this
season after a win over previous-No.
13 Ohio State, but was unable to
keep the momentum going against
an aggressive Hoyas squad.

Early in the game, the Cardinal
(2-2) took a 3-1 lead behind goals
from juniors Rachel Ozer and Anna
Kim and sophomore Kyle Eraser.
However, after Stanford sophomore
Hannah Farr scored a free-position
shot to make it 4-2 halfway through
the first half, Georgetown burst out
with a 7-1 scoring run. From that
point on, the Cardinal would never
challenge despite four goals on the
game from Ozer.
"[Georgetown] is a great team
and it just wasn't our day maybe
coming back from the road trip, I'm
not sure what it was," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker. "I thought
they totally outsmarted us and in ar
eas were outworking us, so that's
what we've got to get back to the
drawing board on."
Both teams and the sparse but
passionate crowd expressed frustra
tion with the referees in a game that
was heated and physical in the first
half.
Hoyas sophomore Caroline Tarz
ian posted a game-high five goals, in
cluding three in the first half. Ozer
was able to break the Hoyas' streak
with a free-position goal with 3:11
left in the half, but Tarzian bookend
ed halftime with two goals of her own
to keep momentum firmly in George

town's control.
Ten minutes into the second half,
Ozer assisted a goal by freshman
Meg Lentz that cut the deficit to 10-
7. But less than 30 seconds later,
Georgetown responded with a clever
passing sequence that set up a point
blank shot to spark another five-goal
run. Stanford had just one goal over

the final 20 minutes of play, an essen
tially meaningless tally by Ozer with
6:52 remaining.
