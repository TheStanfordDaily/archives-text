# RANKING WRECKED

### JANA PERSKY DESK EDITOR 
The No. 18 Stanford lacrosse
team fell flat in its quest to defeat a
second-straight ranked opponent
when it fell to No. 11 Georgetown 15-
8 on Tbesday evening at Cagan Sta
dium.
Stanford had broken into the na
tional rankings for the first time this
season after a win over previous-No.
13 Ohio State, but was unable to
keep the momentum going against
an aggressive Hoyas squad.

Early in the game, the Cardinal
(2-2) took a 3-1 lead behind goals
from juniors Rachel Ozer and Anna
Kim and sophomore Kyle Eraser.
However, after Stanford sophomore
Hannah Farr scored a free-position
shot to make it 4-2 halfway through
the first half, Georgetown burst out
with a 7-1 scoring run. From that
point on, the Cardinal would never
challenge despite four goals on the
game from Ozer.
"[Georgetown] is a great team
and it just wasn't our day maybe
coming back from the road trip, I'm
not sure what it was," said Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker. "I thought
they totally outsmarted us and in ar
eas were outworking us, so that's
what we've got to get back to the
drawing board on."
Both teams and the sparse but
passionate crowd expressed frustra
tion with the referees in a game that
was heated and physical in the first
half.
Hoyas sophomore Caroline Tarz
ian posted a game-high five goals, in
cluding three in the first half. Ozer
was able to break the Hoyas' streak
with a free-position goal with 3:11
left in the half, but Tarzian bookend
ed halftime with two goals of her own
to keep momentum firmly in George

town's control.
Ten minutes into the second half,
Ozer assisted a goal by freshman
Meg Lentz that cut the deficit to 10-
7. But less than 30 seconds later,
Georgetown responded with a clever
passing sequence that set up a point
blank shot to spark another five-goal
run. Stanford had just one goal over

the final 20 minutes of play, an essen
tially meaningless tally by Ozer with
6:52 remaining.

Stanford could not hold on to an early lead against Georgetown,
which steamrolled the Cardinal on its home turf on Tuesday night.
