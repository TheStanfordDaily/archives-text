# M. VOLLEYBALL
## SOUTH FOR THE WINTER 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's vol
leyball team has finally found the
key to success or so it seems af
ter two critical and emotional wins
at home this past weekend. The
Cardinal beat No. 5 Pepperdine
(9-6) and No. 13 USC (4-9), both
important rivals to the program.
The weekend's success demon
states that Stanford is a tough,
maturing team and possibly a con
tender for the national champi
onship.
More importantly, perhaps,
the two wins provide the Cardinal
with the poise and momentum it
needs going into two away match-
