## SOUTH FOR THE WINTER 
### ELIZA THOMPSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's vol
leyball team has finally found the
key to success or so it seems af
ter two critical and emotional wins
at home this past weekend. The
Cardinal beat No. 5 Pepperdine
(9-6) and No. 13 USC (4-9), both
important rivals to the program.
The weekend's success demon
states that Stanford is a tough,
maturing team and possibly a con
tender for the national champi
onship.
More importantly, perhaps,
the two wins provide the Cardinal
with the poise and momentum it
needs going into two away match-

es this weekend against top-15
opponents. Stanford will face
No. 14 UC-Santa Barbara (7-
12) this Friday and No. 6
UCLA (11-9) the very next
day. Both opponents are com
ing fresh off losses and will be
seeking the comfort of their
respective home gyms to fry
and beat the Cardinal.
Stanford entered last
weekend with fresh wounds
from a very tough loss against
BYU, and with ongoing strug
gles to find consistency at
home and, more critically, on
the road. The young team was
in a constant state of in-be
tween — improving in some
matches, only to make similar
mistakes another contest.
This past weekend, howev
er, everything seemed to come
together for the Cardinal as it
avenged two early-season
losses, and now Stanford must
take these newfound answers
on the road. Stanford beat No.
5 Pepperdine in five very close
sets, winning the last set 15-13
and getting 24 kills from jun
ior Brian Cook; his continued
leadership will be critical
against UCSB and UCLA.
The win against USC came in
part because of Stanford's
ability to take advantage of
weaknesses in the Trojan de
fense.
Furthermore, libero Grant
Delgado was able to flourish in
his newly solo role as libero
over the weekend, as he com
piled 12 digs and made sever
al crucial saves.
Strong defense was one of
the greatest factors to the
Cardinal's success and one
will need to be present again
this weekend against two very
strong offensive teams. Both
the Gauchos and the Bruins
have demonstrated in recent

matches that their offense can
be controlled and limited by
strong defenses. UCSB lost to
Long Beach State last week
and was limited to .172 hitting.
If Stanford can control the
Gauchos' offenses as Long
Beach was able to, specifically
focusing on powerful hitter
Evan Licht, than the Cardinal
should be able to beat UCSB.
UCLA, having lost to
UCSB at home last week, is
facing a critical point in its sea
son, as the Bruins look to
overcome their loss and not
succumb to the mounting
pressure. Stanford wants to
come out aggressively and
gain an early lead against the
Bruins in order to ensure they
don't regain any confidence
early on against the Cardinal.
Stanford should also focus
on hitting around the strong
blocking team of Clayton
Paullin and Spencer Rowe,
who have dominated the net in
recent games. If the Cardinal
can out-block and out-hit
around the Bruins' middles,
than Stanford's offense should
see success.
Furthermore, two of the
Bruin's strongest hitters,
Page and Quiroga, both hit un
der .200 last match and may
be more vulnerable to the
Cardinal's defense, especially
if the Cardinal does not let
UCLA convert swings to kills
early on. One major factor
working against the Cardinal
is that Stanford has not won at
Pauley Pavilion since 2003.
The Cardinal this weekend
must remind itself that it has
proven, to both its
opponents and itself, that with
consistency aggression and
will, Stanford can compete
with any team in the top 15.
The key to success this week
end will be working as a team
that truly believes its strug
gles are in the past.

blocking team of Clayton
Paullin and Spencer Rowe,
who have dominated the net in
recent games. If the Cardinal
can out-block and out-hit
around the Bruins' middles,
than Stanford's offense should
see success.
Furthermore, two of the
Bruin's strongest hitters,
Page and Quiroga, both hit un
der .200 last match and may
be more vulnerable to the
Cardinal's defense, especially
if the Cardinal does not let
UCLA convert swings to kills
early on. One major factor
working against the Cardinal
is that Stanford has not won at
Pauley Pavilion since 2003.
The Cardinal this weekend
must remind itself that it has
proven, to both its
opponents and itself, that with
consistency aggression and
will, Stanford can compete
with any team in the top 15.
The key to success this week
end will be working as a team
that truly believes its strug
gles are in the past.
