## OP-EDS The 						Costs of Divestment 
### ADAM JOHNSON '13 
Recently there has been much
commotion on campus in re
gards to the University's in
vestment portfolio. The Stanford Stu
dents for Palestinian Equal Rights
(SPER), along with dozens of other
activist and community organizations
on campus, pushed for the Under
graduate Senate to pass a bill that
would recommend the Board of
Trustees to divest from corporations
involved in the Israel-Palestine situa
tion. The bill did not pass.
And while this divestment cam
paign has been a fixture in recent
years, another divestment campaign
has begun: Students for Sustainable
Stanford (SSS), following the lead of
other campus groups concerned with
climate change, has called on the Uni
versity to freeze investments in fossil
fuel companies and permanently di
vest within five years. SSS has opened
up a petition and recently chalked slo
gans in White Plaza.
At the core of these campaigns is a
vision for the University to uphold its
commitment, as stated in the Found
ing Grant, to "promote the public wel
fare by exercising an influence in be
half of humanity and civilization."
While the Board of Trustees' pri
mary responsibility regarding the en
dowment is to maximize financial re
turn taking into account risk, they al
so have a responsibility to examine
the nature of the companies they in
vest in: when it is determined that the
"the corporate policies or practices of
a company Stanford may invest in
could cause substantial social injury
[the trustees], as responsible and eth
ical investors, shall give independent
weight to this factor."
Given these myriad priorities, the
investment debate becomes more
complex than many realize. It is not
enough to merely show that a compa
ny is complicit in the violation of hu
man rights "social injury" is just
one factor in the endowment deci
sions. The flawed assumption that di
vestment campaigners make is that
Stanford is obligated to divest from
corporations if they are shown to be
unethical.

Of course, a divestment advocate
would likely respond that divesting,
whether or not the Board of Trustees
mustd o it, is the "right thing to do." I,
however, would like to question that
logic. Going back to the Founding
Grant, we must ask ourselves what it
means to "promote the public wel
fare." Does it entail only investing in
corporations deemed ethical? Or
should Stanford maximize its endow
ment returns in order to maintain and
expand programs that, in theory, do
work that improves the world?
This ideological conflict of commit
ments is thrillingly dramatized in Ma
jor Barbara, George Bernard Shaw's
1905 play. In the play, there is a scene
in which the leaders of a Salvation
Army shelter must decide whether to
accept a ten thousand pound donation
from two men, one who made his for
tune from whiskey and the other from

weapons manufacture. The immorali
ties these men represent alco
holism and warfare are as incon
gruous with the mission of the Salva
tion Army as possible, and Shaw
spares no gruesome image in making
this fact apparent. Mrs. Baines, the
Salvation Army commissioner, ulti
mately accepts the money despite the
protest of one of her officers. As she
asks, "will there be less drinking or
more if all those poor souls we are sav
ing come tomorrow and find the doors
of our shelters shut in their faces?"
Certainly, Shaw's play is a simplifi
cation of the investment dilemma
Stanford faces. There are similarities
worth noting, however. Ostensibly,
Stanford invests in corporations that
deal in fossil fuels or Palestinian op
pression because these are profitable
investments. This money does not dis
appear- it is used to fund depart
ments, research, financial aid and
more. While Stanford is in no danger
of shutting down, who knows what in
novations or ideas can be linked to the
extra money that "unethical" corpora
tions have brought in? If we are of the
opinion that this University does work
to improve humanity, we may only
constrain that mission by limiting in
vestments to "ethical" corporations.
