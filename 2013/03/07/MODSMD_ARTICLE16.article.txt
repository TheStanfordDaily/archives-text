# Re-thinking Design Thinking
## 
### DANNY BUERKLI MA '13 
The Hasso Plattner Institute of
Design at Stanford, better
known as the design school (or
d.sehool), was founded in 2005 with
the aim of creating a University-wide
hub where students from all disci
plines would come together to work
on complex challenges using design
thinking. The design thinking process
provides a methodology for, in the
d.school's own words, "producing reli
ably innovative results in any field."
The school is focused on the method
and not a particular field, as it seeks to
impart the design thinking methodol
ogy to its students with the aim of cre
ating "innovators rather than any par
ticular innovation".
d.sehool students learn design
thinking by working with client or
ganizations on real problems, trying
to find novel ways to solve them using
the method. Design thinking is a radi
cally emphatic, human-centered
process that provides a structured
way for discovering insights that can
be translated into products or servic
es. The approach is powerful and has
produced impressive breakthroughs
with the potential to improve the fives
of scores of underserved individuals: a
low-cost, low-tech infant incubator
(Embrace) and a sturdy solar-pow
ered LED lantern (dJight) are just
two of the more well-known examples.
Like any method, design thinking
structures how you approach and con
ceptualize a problem. The way the
method is currently taught, however,
preordains the result.
The answer to any problem unfail
ingly is a product or a service. Some
problems are indeed best solved with a

product or a service. Yet other prob
lems need systemic solutions (e.g. po
litical action).
Take the problem of a low-income
single mom for whom dinner with her
kids is stressful. How might we im
prove her dinner experience? We can
surely come up with some product or
service which decreases the time the
mom spends in the kitchen or some
how makes it more fun for her kids to
help cook dinner.
But what if raising the minimum
wage so she didn't have to work two
jobs was the best way to improve this
mom's dinner experience? Using the
design thinking methodology, you
would be exceedingly unlikely to reach
this conclusion.
By providing this mother a product
or a service, we condone the fact that
her hourly wage is too low to make a
living. By applying a temporary and
quick fix in the form of a product or a
service to the problem, we do not ac
knowledge or engage with the root
causes and instead, implicitly decide
that her interests would not be better
served by an increased minimum
wage. This may be true, but that deci
sion needs to be the result of a deliber
ate thought process, not the inadver
tent product of the design thinking
method.
Perhaps it is no accident that the
d.school and design thinking have
flourished in Silicon Valley. There is a
prevalent belief in the Valley that tech
nology will be able to solve all our prob
lems ("there's an app for that"). Solu
tions in the form of products and serv
ices appeal to our desire to "fix" things.
With this attitude comes a lack of re
flection about which problems lend
themselves to technical solutions and
which do not. Sometimes apps, prod
ucts and services are the right solu
tions to a problem. Sometimes they are
not. And sometimes a "quick fix" can
get in the way of desperately needed
structural change. The d.school
methodology, as it currently stands, is
not likely to prompt its practitioners to
think rigorously about these important
questions.
No method can possibly be appro

priate for every problem, and design
thinking is no exception. But it is im
perative to understand the limitations
of the methods we use.
If the d.school was a private enter
prise, it could do whatever it wanted
without the need for reflection. Howev
er, as part of a university, it has an edu
cational mission. Even though its quar
ters look distinctly non-academic, the
school is in the business of teaching a
method. Accordingly the d.school
has an obligation to not only teach the
method, but also to ensure that its stu
dents understand the limits of the
tools they are being taught. There
may be ways of remedying this prob
lem and to integrate political or struc
tural solutions into design thinking.
But as long as this is not standard
procedure, the d.school must not just
teach the method, but also its blind
spots.
