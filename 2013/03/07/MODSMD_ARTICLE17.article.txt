# A 						Memory of Suites
## 
### MARK WEIERICH '87 
I'm a Stanford alum, class of 1987.
Our daughter is a freshman at the
Farm, living in Serra House in
Stern.
My wife just came back from Stan
ford yesterday after visiting for Par
ents' Weekend. She told me some
shocking news the eating clubs at
the Suites, as we knew them, are going
away.
I lived in Stem freshman year
(1983) and drew low in the spring,
landing a six-person suite in Jenkins
with my freshman pals. We ate at Mid
dle Earth and enjoyed it so much that
by the time we were seniors, each of us
was managing one of the clubs with a
fifth roommate holding the CEO hat.
At that time, each club had a manager
and a CFO, with one student CEO
overseeing all four clubs. I was fortu
nate enough to manage Middle Earth,
which was always my favorite club!
It sounds like much of what I loved
about the eating clubs has remained
unchanged over the years. We had the
absolute best food on campus, total au

tonomy as to how we ran the clubs and
off-campus students clambering to
sign up for a food plan in any of the
four clubs. On top of it all, our meal
plan was less expensive than standard
University food service, our hashers
were well paid, we could nibble any
time day or night and our chefs were,
bar none, the best.
My chef, Walter Wormer, and I col
laborated on weekly menus and
treasured the quarterly "special din
ners" that were the highlight of the
quarter and very elaborate, including
fantastic food and entertainment.
Every Friday, Walter made his home
made recipe of chocolate chip cookies,
which were so popular- that we had to
control the distribution, lest a crazed
Beefeater or Bollardite try to purloin a
cookie or two.
Gelato Classico had just opened up
in Palo Alto and once a week, Walter
and I would drive over and buy two
large containers of gelato as a special
treat for the Middle Earthers. I also
fondly remember Sunday morning
breakfasts, cooked by a student chef,
complete with coffee cake and made
to-order pancakes or omelets. All this
while passing every health inspector's
inspection with flying colors. Never
forget to send the can opener through
the Hobart machine!
I want to thank Miles Unterreiner
for his thorough, well-researched and
well-written articles. After reading
them, it's hard not to connect the dots
and come up with a scandal. It seems
like there is no logical, justifiable busi
ness reason for Residential Education
to take over the running of the eating
clubs and dole out a contract to Stu
dent Organized Services.
I hope that the articles expose
enough light for someone higher up to
put a stop to it, but I've seen these
types of things happen in the business
world against all better judgment, so I
will remain pessimistic at this point.
As I hit the send button, I'm at least
reminded of my time as manager of
Middle Earth and the lingering smell
of warm chocolate chip cookies...
