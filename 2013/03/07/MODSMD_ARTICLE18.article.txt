## Toni Kokenis to miss Pac-12 Tournament with medical issue 
### â€”Miles Bennett-Smith 
After struggling all year with an
undisclosed medical issue, Stanford
women's basketball starting point guard
Toni Kokenis will miss the upcoming Pac
-12 Tournament, which starts Thursday
in Seattle.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer said that
Kokenis' illness is not life threatening, but
could keep her from playing in the NCAA
Tournament. Stanford is a host site for the
tournament, which begins on March 23,
and the No. 4 Cardinal has a good chance
to earn one of the four No. 1 seeds when
the bracket is announced.
But the team will have to navigate a
tough Pac-12 field this weekend without
Kokenis, who has missed the last eight
games and nine overall this season. Her
scoring average is down to 7.7 points per
game this season after scoring 9.5 ppg last
year.
Kokenis has been limited on the defen
sive end as well this season, just a year re
moved from being named to the All-Pac
-12 team as one of the conference's best
perimter defenders.
"Obviously it's not ideal," VanDerveer
said, but noted that the absence of Koke
nis has allowed other players to step up in
key roles for the team.
Top-seeded Stanford opens the Pac-12
Tournament Friday at 6 p.m. against ei
ther No. 8-seed Washington State or No.
9 Arizona State.
