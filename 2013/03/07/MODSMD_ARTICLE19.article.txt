# Cal snaps Stanford's 31-year conference title streak
## 
### â€”George Chen 
For the first time in 31 years, Stan
ford men's swimming and diving failed to
get its hands on the conference champi
onship trophy.
Propelled by senior star Tom Shields,
winner of four individual events, and im
pressive depth in the breaststroke
events, Cal ended Stanford's 31-year
streak by amassing 825 points, narrowly
besting the Cardinal's 800. USC, Arizona
and Utah rounded out the top five.
Trailing Cal by 63 points going into
the last day of competition, Stanford
made a valiant effort to close the gap.
Sophomores Drew Cosgarea and David

Sophomore Drew Cosgarea (above)
took first in the 1 650-yard freestyle at
this week's Pac-12 Championships, but
for the first time in 31 years, Stanford
did not come away with the team title,
falling short against rival Cal 825-800.

Nolan headlined the rally, coming up gold
in the 1650-yard freestyle and 200-yard
backstroke, respectively. Nolan's time of
1:40.39 broke the meet record, set by
Stanford's own Eugene Godsoe in 2009,
by just over a tenth of a second. Senior
sprint specialist Aaron Wayne took sec
ond in the 100-yard freestyle.
But the Bears ended the Cardinal's
hopes of a 32nd-straight conference title
when Shields obliterated the rest of the
field by over three seconds in the 200-
yard butterfly, clocking in at 1:41.23.
The Cardinal returns to The Farm to
taper for the NCAA Championship,
which begins March 28.
