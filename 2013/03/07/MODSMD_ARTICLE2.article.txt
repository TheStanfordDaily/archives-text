# Sequester to seriously affect Stanford research
## Projected $5l million decrease in research revenues 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The inability of the federal government to
avert the "sequester" automatic and across
the-board spending cuts of $B5 billion that came
into effect last Friday will seriously affect
the state of ongoing and future research at
Stanford, according to University administra
tors.
In a presentation to the Faculty Senate on
Feb. 21, Vice Provost and Dean of Research
Ann Arvin estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected federal research
revenues of $685 million for the 2013-14 fiscal
year by $5l million.
Grants from federal agencies, from the Na
tional Institute of Health to the National Sci
ence Foundation, make up 17 percent of Stan
ford's $4 billion budget and ultimately fund 80
percent of all research conducted at Stanford
beyond the SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory.
According to Arvin, the impact of these fed
eral discretionary spending cuts is "quite seri

ous" for the state of Stanford research, forcing
faculty to devise a number of measures that will
attempt to bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of research] and
the speed, if you will, the timeline for how
quickly the work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Director of Feder
al Government Relations, articulated his dis
pleasure with the nature of the cuts and the di
alogue's frustrating nature in a phone interview
with The Daily from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day communicating
the damage that the sequester cuts would in
flict on research and education, and the coun
try's innovation ecosystem," he said. "We tell
them that research and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S. economy, and
that has served us very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically for federal
policies that prioritize research and education
funding in acknowledgement of the broader so

cietal benefits produced.
"This is how we drive new technologies of
the future, how we educate and train the skilled
workforce of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it needs to be a
federal priority," Adesnik said.
Additionally, Adesnik asserted that the se
quester, ostensibly devised to help manage the
U.S.'s burgeoning deficit by providing an un
palatable alternative to Congress passing a
more comprehensive piece of deficit reduction
legislation, does not actually help fix the situa
tion.
"Sequestration does very, very little to im
pact the deficit, because the unsustainable
growth in the federal budget is being driven not
