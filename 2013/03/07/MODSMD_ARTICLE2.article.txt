# Sequester to seriously affect Stanford research
## Projected $5l million decrease in research revenues 
### AARON SEKHRI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The inability of the federal government to
avert the "sequester" automatic and across
the-board spending cuts of $B5 billion that came
into effect last Friday will seriously affect
the state of ongoing and future research at
Stanford, according to University administra
tors.
In a presentation to the Faculty Senate on
Feb. 21, Vice Provost and Dean of Research
Ann Arvin estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected federal research
revenues of $685 million for the 2013-14 fiscal
year by $5l million.
Grants from federal agencies, from the Na
tional Institute of Health to the National Sci
ence Foundation, make up 17 percent of Stan
ford's $4 billion budget and ultimately fund 80
percent of all research conducted at Stanford
beyond the SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory.
According to Arvin, the impact of these fed
eral discretionary spending cuts is "quite seri

ous" for the state of Stanford research, forcing
faculty to devise a number of measures that will
attempt to bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of research] and
the speed, if you will, the timeline for how
quickly the work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.
Mr. Adesnik goes to Washington
Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Director of Feder
al Government Relations, articulated his dis
pleasure with the nature of the cuts and the di
alogue's frustrating nature in a phone interview
with The Daily from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day communicating
the damage that the sequester cuts would in
flict on research and education, and the coun
try's innovation ecosystem," he said. "We tell
them that research and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S. economy, and
that has served us very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically for federal
policies that prioritize research and education
funding in acknowledgement of the broader so

cietal benefits produced.
"This is how we drive new technologies of
the future, how we educate and train the skilled
workforce of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it needs to be a
federal priority," Adesnik said.
Additionally, Adesnik asserted that the se
quester, ostensibly devised to help manage the
U.S.'s burgeoning deficit by providing an un
palatable alternative to Congress passing a
more comprehensive piece of deficit reduction
legislation, does not actually help fix the situa
tion.
"Sequestration does very, very little to im
pact the deficit, because the unsustainable
growth in the federal budget is being driven not

on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."
Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."
Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities have
been affected in similar ways, with
their reliance on federal funding for
research leading to potentially grave
consequences for the state of re
search at those institutions.
Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal re
search aid budget and is consider
ing diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.
The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,
'Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would receive
aid to help them finance the costs of
college and around 3,690 fewer stu
dents will get work-study jobs that
help them pay for college."
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.
"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's

such a small portion of our budget."
Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.
"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation ...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."
Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.
"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.
A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this moment,
"most science agencies will take a
five percent hit," according to
Adesnik. He noted, however, that
the situation is entirely "variable."
"If you're talking from a Stan
ford-specific perspective, it's a little
to early to tell the extent of the
hit," Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific guid
ance to or from the federal agen
cies, each agency at least is signal
ing a slightly different approach for
how they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing short and
long terms solutions to an impend
ing funding crunch, Arvin offered
few answers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting fundamental
research and Stanford's dependen
cy on federal research funding.
"If you are successful in getting
a grant that gives you $245 [thou

sand], you've only got enough mon
ey at that rate to support two
trainees and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said. "It
looks like a lot of money, but lab re
search is very expensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor that
can substitute $450 million a year of
federal research money," she added.
"We don't have an alternative to fed
eral research funding. Where would
it come from, at that scale?"
Despite the difficulty of finding
solutions to the impact of the se
quester cuts, Arvin emphasized
that the cuts come at a time which
has been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight funding
climate for the last five years," she
said. "I mean, we have been
preparing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on grad
uate student fellowships, endowed
chairs for faculty, so our strategy
really has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can find a
substitute resource."
In terms of substantive strate
gies, Arvin said that the essence of
any strategy to strengthen re
search at Stanford would be to cut
unnecessary costs and incentivize
faculty performance.
"We have to do everything we
can to ensure faculty are competi
tive, and we do that in several dif
ferent ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot grants in
ternally, for researchers to get pre
liminary data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facilities,
because if you have those facilities
and instruments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that cost
cutting cannot be a goal unto itself
since indiscriminate budget de
creases for faculty would diminish
the very purpose of much of the re
search at Stanford education.
"Keep in mind that our research
enterprise is all about education as
well," she said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire more
research staff and be much more ef
ficient. Are we going to do that?
No."
While the sequester will likely
impose substantial damage to re
search at universities around the
country, Arvin emphasized that is
sues associated with declining fed
eral research spending have been a
pressing issue for some time.
"We've had to think about the
declining federal funding for sever
al years," Arvin said. "We were
thinking about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain competitive
for research before anybody start
ed talking about the sequester."

Ryan Adesnik, Stanford's Director of Feder
al Government Relations, articulated his dis
pleasure with the nature of the cuts and the di
alogue's frustrating nature in a phone interview
with The Daily from Washington, D.C.
"We're spending every day communicating
the damage that the sequester cuts would in
flict on research and education, and the coun
try's innovation ecosystem," he said. "We tell
them that research and education are invest
ments in the future of the U.S. economy, and
that has served us very well over the years."
Adesnik argued emphatically for federal
policies that prioritize research and education
funding in acknowledgement of the broader so

cietal benefits produced.
"This is how we drive new technologies of
the future, how we educate and train the skilled
workforce of the future and it's the underpin
nings of economic future, and it needs to be a
federal priority," Adesnik said.
Additionally, Adesnik asserted that the se
quester, ostensibly devised to help manage the
U.S.'s burgeoning deficit by providing an un
palatable alternative to Congress passing a
more comprehensive piece of deficit reduction
legislation, does not actually help fix the situa
tion.
"Sequestration does very, very little to im
pact the deficit, because the unsustainable
growth in the federal budget is being driven not

on the discretionary side of the fed
eral budget with the science pro
grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."
Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."
Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities have
been affected in similar ways, with
their reliance on federal funding for
research leading to potentially grave
consequences for the state of re
search at those institutions.
Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal re
search aid budget and is consider
ing diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.
The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,
'Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would receive
aid to help them finance the costs of
college and around 3,690 fewer stu
dents will get work-study jobs that
help them pay for college."
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.
"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's

such a small portion of our budget."
Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.
"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation ...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."
Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.
"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.
A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this moment,
"most science agencies will take a
five percent hit," according to
Adesnik. He noted, however, that
the situation is entirely "variable."
"If you're talking from a Stan
ford-specific perspective, it's a little
to early to tell the extent of the
hit," Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific guid
ance to or from the federal agen
cies, each agency at least is signal
ing a slightly different approach for
how they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing short and
long terms solutions to an impend
ing funding crunch, Arvin offered
few answers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting fundamental
research and Stanford's dependen
cy on federal research funding.
"If you are successful in getting
a grant that gives you $245 [thou

sand], you've only got enough mon
ey at that rate to support two
trainees and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said. "It
looks like a lot of money, but lab re
search is very expensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor that
can substitute $450 million a year of
federal research money," she added.
"We don't have an alternative to fed
eral research funding. Where would
it come from, at that scale?"
Despite the difficulty of finding
solutions to the impact of the se
quester cuts, Arvin emphasized
that the cuts come at a time which
has been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight funding
climate for the last five years," she
said. "I mean, we have been
preparing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on grad
uate student fellowships, endowed
chairs for faculty, so our strategy
really has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can find a
substitute resource."
In terms of substantive strate
gies, Arvin said that the essence of
any strategy to strengthen re
search at Stanford would be to cut
unnecessary costs and incentivize
faculty performance.
"We have to do everything we
can to ensure faculty are competi
tive, and we do that in several dif
ferent ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot grants in
ternally, for researchers to get pre
liminary data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facilities,
because if you have those facilities
and instruments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that cost
cutting cannot be a goal unto itself
since indiscriminate budget de
creases for faculty would diminish
the very purpose of much of the re
search at Stanford education.
"Keep in mind that our research
enterprise is all about education as
well," she said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire more
research staff and be much more ef
ficient. Are we going to do that?
No."
While the sequester will likely
impose substantial damage to re
search at universities around the
country, Arvin emphasized that is
sues associated with declining fed
eral research spending have been a
pressing issue for some time.
"We've had to think about the
declining federal funding for sever
al years," Arvin said. "We were
thinking about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain competitive
for research before anybody start
ed talking about the sequester."

The inability of the federal government to
avert the "sequester" automatic and across
the-board spending cuts of $B5 billion that came
into effect last Friday will seriously affect
the state of ongoing and future research at
Stanford, according to University administra
tors.
In a presentation to the Faculty Senate on
Feb. 21, Vice Provost and Dean of Research
Ann Arvin estimated that the sequester would
reduce Stanford's projected federal research
revenues of $685 million for the 2013-14 fiscal
year by $5l million.
Grants from federal agencies, from the Na
tional Institute of Health to the National Sci
ence Foundation, make up 17 percent of Stan
ford's $4 billion budget and ultimately fund 80
percent of all research conducted at Stanford
beyond the SLAC National Accelerator Labo
ratory.
According to Arvin, the impact of these fed
eral discretionary spending cuts is "quite seri

ous" for the state of Stanford research, forcing
faculty to devise a number of measures that will
attempt to bring down costs and manage their
projects more economically.
"It will affect the amount [of research] and
the speed, if you will, the timeline for how
quickly the work can be done and the questions
can be answered," Arvin said.

grams and financial aid, but it
comes from the mandatory side,
from the entitlements," he said.
"When you're cutting these invest
ments you're not helping the deficit
problem, you're just hindering
long-term economic growth, and
frankly part of how you handle a
deficit problem is you have eco
nomic growth."
Adesnik said that the idea of al
lowing research funding to be di
minished at a time where competi
tion around the world is increasing
is shortsighted and misguided.
"That's the absurdity," Adesnik
said. "At a time when the global
economy is getting more competi
tive and other countries are betting
on our model, we're scaling it back,
intentionally or unintentionally."
Peer institutions equally affected
Stanford's peer universities have
been affected in similar ways, with
their reliance on federal funding for
research leading to potentially grave
consequences for the state of re
search at those institutions.
Princeton University receives
roughly $2OO million a year from
the federal government, and the
cuts "could shrink the University's
federally-sponsored research
budget by $l5 to 20 million for fis
cal year 2013 and indirectly dimin
ish its endowment," according to
The Daily Princetonian.
Harvard University anticipates
cuts to its $650 million in federal re
search aid budget and is consider
ing diversification of its funding
sources, as well as serious cost-cut
ting efforts.
The effects of the sequester are
also not constrained to research,
with federal financial aid programs
due to lose crucial funds. According
to a White House memo on the spe
cific losses for California residents,
'Around 9,600 fewer low income
students in California would receive
aid to help them finance the costs of
college and around 3,690 fewer stu
dents will get work-study jobs that
help them pay for college."
According to Director of Finan
cial Aid Karen Cooper, however,
Stanford will not be overly affected
by these predictions.
"[Federal aid] is a very small
portion of the funding that we use
to fund undergraduates," Cooper
said. "For this current year we're
spending $l2B million in institu
tional funds on financial aid and
we'll be spending $6 million in fed
eral funds for financial aid, so it's

such a small portion of our budget."
Because Pell Grants the ma
jority of Stanford's federal aid
funding are protected from the
sequester, the University should
see a marginal impact from the se
quester on its financial aid budget,
according to Cooper.
"According to NASFA, we
would lose around $50,000 from our
federal work-study allocation ...
that should be the main impact to
us," said Cooper. "We spend a little
over $2 million in federal work
study specifically... so if [funding]
is lower than last year by that
amount, it actually wouldn't impact
undergraduates. What we would do
is reduce the spending on graduate
students first."
Climate of uncertainty
According to Arvin, despite the
knowledge of the impending cuts,
there is almost no understanding of
how the cuts will actually be appor
tioned for current and future re
search grants. Instead, that deter
mination has been left to the vari
ous relevant federal agencies and
internal divisions to decide in the
next few months.
"How [the cuts] will happen, we
don't know, but it has to happen
within now and the end of the fiscal
year, and then it will carry on from
there," said Arvin.
A White House press release
claims that, in light of the se
quester, "the NIH would be forced
to delay or halt vital scientific proj
ects and make hundreds of fewer
research awards" and that "the
National Science Foundation
(NSF) would issue nearly 1,000
fewer research grants and
awards", but as of now there has
been no word from those agencies
as to when those delays and de
creases in grants will be seen.
As things hold as of this moment,
"most science agencies will take a
five percent hit," according to
Adesnik. He noted, however, that
the situation is entirely "variable."
"If you're talking from a Stan
ford-specific perspective, it's a little
to early to tell the extent of the
hit," Adesnik said. "Because there
hasn't been a lot of specific guid
ance to or from the federal agen
cies, each agency at least is signal
ing a slightly different approach for
how they're going to do this. We're
sort of in a wait-and-see mode."

Lacking solutions
In terms of assessing short and
long terms solutions to an impend
ing funding crunch, Arvin offered
few answers, citing the enormous
expense of conducting fundamental
research and Stanford's dependen
cy on federal research funding.
"If you are successful in getting
a grant that gives you $245 [thou

sand], you've only got enough mon
ey at that rate to support two
trainees and one staff member, and
some supplies," Arvin said. "It
looks like a lot of money, but lab re
search is very expensive."
"We are lucky we have our
donors, but there's no donor that
can substitute $450 million a year of
federal research money," she added.
"We don't have an alternative to fed
eral research funding. Where would
it come from, at that scale?"
Despite the difficulty of finding
solutions to the impact of the se
quester cuts, Arvin emphasized
that the cuts come at a time which
has been suboptimal for research
in general.
"It's been a very tight funding
climate for the last five years," she
said. "I mean, we have been
preparing for a long time in terms
of the leadership focusing on grad
uate student fellowships, endowed
chairs for faculty, so our strategy
really has to be to relieve the bur
den of costs where we can find a
substitute resource."
In terms of substantive strate
gies, Arvin said that the essence of
any strategy to strengthen re
search at Stanford would be to cut
unnecessary costs and incentivize
faculty performance.
"We have to do everything we
can to ensure faculty are competi
tive, and we do that in several dif
ferent ways," she said. "We try to
offer seed grants, pilot grants in
ternally, for researchers to get pre
liminary data, we also try to have
state-of-the-art shared facilities,
because if you have those facilities
and instruments available you can
have more impact."
However, Arvin said that cost
cutting cannot be a goal unto itself
since indiscriminate budget de
creases for faculty would diminish
the very purpose of much of the re
search at Stanford education.
"Keep in mind that our research
enterprise is all about education as
well," she said. "Now, we could just
take fewer students and hire more
research staff and be much more ef
ficient. Are we going to do that?
No."
While the sequester will likely
impose substantial damage to re
search at universities around the
country, Arvin emphasized that is
sues associated with declining fed
eral research spending have been a
pressing issue for some time.
"We've had to think about the
declining federal funding for sever
al years," Arvin said. "We were
thinking about what to do to make
sure our faculty remain competitive
for research before anybody start
ed talking about the sequester."
