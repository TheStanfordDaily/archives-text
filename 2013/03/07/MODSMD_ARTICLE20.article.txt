# ITA Men's Hall of Fame to induct Goldstein
## 
### 
Former Pac-10 Player of the Year
Paul Goldstein '9B will be inducted into
the Intercollegiate Tennis Association's
Men's Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame
this year.
At Stanford, Goldstein led the Cardi
nal to four consecutive N CAA team titles
and was himself a four-time All-Ameri
can in both singles in doubles. His 24-3
record as a freshman is still one of the top
rookie campaigns in Stanford history,
and his 84 total dual singles victories are
fifth-best in school history. He lost the
1998 NCAA singles final to teammate
Bob Bryan, who is now the world No. 1 in
doubles.
Goldstein's 26 titles on the USTA Pro
Circuit, a developmental tour, are the
most in its history.
