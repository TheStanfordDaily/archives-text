# Alumna Buehler makes 100th appearance for Team USA

### Joseph Beyda 
Former Cardinal soccer player
Rachel Buehler 'O7 earned her 100 th cap
in an American uniform on Wednesday,
scoring the game-winning goal for the
U.S. in a 3-0 win against Iceland. It was
just her fourth international tally and
came on the same field where she played

in her first game for the U.S. women's na
tional team in 2008.
"Today was an incredible game for
me," she told ussoccer.com. "It's sort of
coming full circle."
An All-Pac-10 First Team selection in
her senior year on the Farm, Buehler is
more widely known as the player who was
given a red card for dragging down Brazil
ian star Marta in the 2011 Women's World
Cup Final. American goalkeeper Hope So
lo saved the ensuing penalty kick, but
Maita was given a second chance after a
controversial encroachment call and tied
the match. Playing a man down without
Buehler, the U.S. team would eventually
win in penalty kicks.
