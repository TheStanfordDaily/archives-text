## Divestment vote sparks split reaction Groups cite student protest, question discussion's validity 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate's vote Tuesday night on two
pieces of legislation concerning di
vestment, which concluded three
weeks of heated debate and outside
endorsements on both sides of the
issue, has been met with varied re
actions from students and alumni
around the world.
The Senate ultimately voted
against a revised bill proposed by
Student for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), which would have
pledged the Senate's support in
urging the Board of Trustees to re
consider investment in two compa
nies that SPER believes violate hu
man rights and international law.
The Senate also passed a resolu
tion written by Senators Lauren
Miller 'l5, Nancy Pham 'l4, Bran
den Crouch 'l4 and Daniela Olivos
'l5 that encouraged the Advisory
Panel for Investment Responsibili
ty and Licensing (APIRL) to review
all of Stanford's investments, asked
concerned students to approach the
APIRL and promised to facilitate
greater discussion of divestment on
campus.
The Senate meeting was live
tweeted by many in attendance us
ing the hashtag #StanfordDivests.
Reaction from supporters of the
bill
On Wednesday morning, SPER
posted a press release to their web
site documenting student support
of the bill and discussing their plans
moving forward.
SPER co-president Omar
Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3, who originally
brought the issue of divestment be
fore the Senate with a presentation
on Feb. 19, said that although the
Senate did not pass SPER's bill, the
group had reached a "significant
milestone."
"To see so many students come
together before the vote and en
courage senators to vote with their
conscience, really to me was a victo
ry and shows how the campus com
munity views this issue," Shakir
said.
According to Shakir, several sen
ators privately supported the bill
and signed the SPER's divestment
petition, but were under "tremen-
dous pressure from select individu
als" that prevented them from pub
licly showing their support.
The petition, which is available
on SPER's website, lists senators
Brandon Hightower 'l5, Daniela
Olivos 'l5 and Christos Haveles 'l5
as "divestment signatories." High
tower and Olivos voted against the
bill, and Haveles abstained.
"The dynamics of what took
place [on Tuesday] and the concert
ed pressure tactics that were used
certainly prevented many from vot
ing their conscience," Shakir said,
adding that he believes the resolu
tion that was passed reflects the
Senate's concern with the ethical is
sues that SPER members dis
cussed.
Josh Schott 'l4, one of the co-au
thors of SPER's bill, agreed with
Shakir that SPER's efforts have
"dramatically changed the campus
climate," and blamed the opposition
for "bombarding [the senators]
with statements that made them
question their moral compass."
However, while Shakir was opti
mistic about the Senate's resolu
tion, Schott said that he believed
the resolution wouldn't influence
the APIRL.
"We feel that that was definitely
a maneuver to nix the bill and we felt
like that was the way to create an
outlet for the senators," he said. "I
don't consider the APIRL resolu
tion to matter in any sense of mean
ing— it doesn't have any teeth. I
don't think it does anything."
Former ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2, who sent an email
to the SPER mailing list express
ing his distress with the Senate's
vote, said that he was "disappointed
that the bill put forth by SPER did
not pass."
In the email, titled "I am disap
pointed," Cruz expressed his con
cern that what he referred to as a
"SOCC [Students of Color Coali
tion] dominated ASSU Senate"
could not "manage to pass a bill for
human rights."
Cruz declined to comment on
the resolution that passed, on
whether or not he believed that vot
ing on the bill was within the Sen
ate's purview or if he thought that
divestment should be discussed in
another forum.
Reaction from opponents of the
bill
Jason Lupatkin 'l3, a member of
the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA),
said that he was "elated" that the
Senate had voted against SPER's
bill. While he saw the resolution as
a "compromise move made to pla
cate members of SPER," he had no

major issues with the resolution's
content.
"I can't argue with the message
of that bill. Ethical investment is
definitely important," Lupaktin
said. "Although I generally think
the Senate should stay out of issues
of political importance that don't
have a general consensus, I'm okay
with the resolution because at the
end of the day, nobody can really
argue against ethical investment."
Though Lupatkin said that he
believed the Senate did a "great job
of moderating the discussion," he
expressed disappointment with
how supporters of the bill took to
social media to criticize those argu
ing against it.
"I did feel a little bit disrespect
ed when I found out that support
ers of SPER had been live tweeting
the entire event, and I was labeled
as an arrogant frat boy who ap
peared to be drunk," he said. "Al
though the bill did not pass, there is
definitely some damage that has
been done to campus unity."
Many of the bill's opponents ar
gued that the Senate should not
have voted on the issue.
Marty Zack 'l4, president of
SIA, said that even discussing the
bill was "a huge step backwards in
terms of what the ASSU should
and could be working on."
"Each of the senators ran to
make the community a better place
and have lots of ideas about doing
that, and this bill had nothing to do
with any of that," Zack said. "It just
detracted from the important work
that the ASSU does in trying to
make the student community a
happy, more productive place to
be."
Former Senator Alon Elhanan
'l4, who gave a presentation about
divestment to the Senate at their
Feb. 26 meeting, said that voting on
the bill may have violated the AS
SU Constitution.
Elhanan pointed to Article I,
Section 5.8 of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which states that the Senate
may act as a representative of the
student body "only if there is at
least one Stanford student who is
affected by the matter in a substan
tially different manner than would
be the case if he or she were not a
University student."
Elhanan said that he considered
it "questionable" that this stipula
tion was satisfied in the case of
Stanford students and the Israel-
Palestine conflict. He raised a simi
lar objection as a Senator on a
equally contentious bill last year.
"I think the Senate understood
that, and when it came to such a di
visive bill, the SPER bill, they
couldn't make a statement on be
half of the entire student body," El
hanan said.

with statements that made them
question their moral compass."
However, while Shakir was opti
mistic about the Senate's resolu
tion, Schott said that he believed
the resolution wouldn't influence
the APIRL.
"We feel that that was definitely
a maneuver to nix the bill and we felt
like that was the way to create an
outlet for the senators," he said. "I
don't consider the APIRL resolu
tion to matter in any sense of mean
ing— it doesn't have any teeth. I
don't think it does anything."
Former ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2, who sent an email
to the SPER mailing list express
ing his distress with the Senate's
vote, said that he was "disappointed
that the bill put forth by SPER did
not pass."
In the email, titled "I am disap
pointed," Cruz expressed his con
cern that what he referred to as a
"SOCC [Students of Color Coali
tion] dominated ASSU Senate"
could not "manage to pass a bill for
human rights."
Cruz declined to comment on
the resolution that passed, on
whether or not he believed that vot
ing on the bill was within the Sen
ate's purview or if he thought that
divestment should be discussed in
another forum.
Reaction from opponents of the
bill
Jason Lupatkin 'l3, a member of
the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA),
said that he was "elated" that the
Senate had voted against SPER's
bill. While he saw the resolution as
a "compromise move made to pla
cate members of SPER," he had no

major issues with the resolution's
content.
"I can't argue with the message
of that bill. Ethical investment is
definitely important," Lupaktin
said. "Although I generally think
the Senate should stay out of issues
of political importance that don't
have a general consensus, I'm okay
with the resolution because at the
end of the day, nobody can really
argue against ethical investment."
Though Lupatkin said that he
believed the Senate did a "great job
of moderating the discussion," he
expressed disappointment with
how supporters of the bill took to
social media to criticize those argu
ing against it.
"I did feel a little bit disrespect
ed when I found out that support
ers of SPER had been live tweeting
the entire event, and I was labeled
as an arrogant frat boy who ap
peared to be drunk," he said. "Al
though the bill did not pass, there is
definitely some damage that has
been done to campus unity."
Many of the bill's opponents ar
gued that the Senate should not
have voted on the issue.
Marty Zack 'l4, president of
SIA, said that even discussing the
bill was "a huge step backwards in
terms of what the ASSU should
and could be working on."
"Each of the senators ran to
make the community a better place
and have lots of ideas about doing
that, and this bill had nothing to do
with any of that," Zack said. "It just
detracted from the important work
that the ASSU does in trying to
make the student community a
happy, more productive place to
be."
Former Senator Alon Elhanan
'l4, who gave a presentation about
divestment to the Senate at their
Feb. 26 meeting, said that voting on
the bill may have violated the AS
SU Constitution.
Elhanan pointed to Article I,
Section 5.8 of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which states that the Senate
may act as a representative of the
student body "only if there is at
least one Stanford student who is
affected by the matter in a substan
tially different manner than would
be the case if he or she were not a
University student."
Elhanan said that he considered
it "questionable" that this stipula
tion was satisfied in the case of
Stanford students and the Israel-
Palestine conflict. He raised a simi
lar objection as a Senator on a
equally contentious bill last year.
"I think the Senate understood
that, and when it came to such a di
visive bill, the SPER bill, they
couldn't make a statement on be
half of the entire student body," El
hanan said.

The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate's vote Tuesday night on two
pieces of legislation concerning di
vestment, which concluded three
weeks of heated debate and outside
endorsements on both sides of the
issue, has been met with varied re
actions from students and alumni
around the world.
The Senate ultimately voted
against a revised bill proposed by
Student for Palestinian Equal
Rights (SPER), which would have
pledged the Senate's support in
urging the Board of Trustees to re
consider investment in two compa
nies that SPER believes violate hu
man rights and international law.
The Senate also passed a resolu
tion written by Senators Lauren
Miller 'l5, Nancy Pham 'l4, Bran
den Crouch 'l4 and Daniela Olivos
'l5 that encouraged the Advisory
Panel for Investment Responsibili
ty and Licensing (APIRL) to review
all of Stanford's investments, asked
concerned students to approach the
APIRL and promised to facilitate
greater discussion of divestment on
campus.
The Senate meeting was live
tweeted by many in attendance us
ing the hashtag #StanfordDivests.
Reaction from supporters of the
bill
On Wednesday morning, SPER
posted a press release to their web
site documenting student support
of the bill and discussing their plans
moving forward.
SPER co-president Omar
Shakir 'O7 J.D. 'l3, who originally
brought the issue of divestment be
fore the Senate with a presentation
on Feb. 19, said that although the
Senate did not pass SPER's bill, the
group had reached a "significant
milestone."
"To see so many students come
together before the vote and en
courage senators to vote with their
conscience, really to me was a victo
ry and shows how the campus com
munity views this issue," Shakir
said.
According to Shakir, several sen
ators privately supported the bill
and signed the SPER's divestment
petition, but were under "tremen-
dous pressure from select individu
als" that prevented them from pub
licly showing their support.
The petition, which is available
on SPER's website, lists senators
Brandon Hightower 'l5, Daniela
Olivos 'l5 and Christos Haveles 'l5
as "divestment signatories." High
tower and Olivos voted against the
bill, and Haveles abstained.
"The dynamics of what took
place [on Tuesday] and the concert
ed pressure tactics that were used
certainly prevented many from vot
ing their conscience," Shakir said,
adding that he believes the resolu
tion that was passed reflects the
Senate's concern with the ethical is
sues that SPER members dis
cussed.
Josh Schott 'l4, one of the co-au
thors of SPER's bill, agreed with
Shakir that SPER's efforts have
"dramatically changed the campus
climate," and blamed the opposition
for "bombarding [the senators]
with statements that made them
question their moral compass."
However, while Shakir was opti
mistic about the Senate's resolu
tion, Schott said that he believed
the resolution wouldn't influence
the APIRL.
"We feel that that was definitely
a maneuver to nix the bill and we felt
like that was the way to create an
outlet for the senators," he said. "I
don't consider the APIRL resolu
tion to matter in any sense of mean
ing— it doesn't have any teeth. I
don't think it does anything."
