## Law School opens Human Rights Center 
### DANNY GIFFORD DESK EDITOR 
For James Cavallaro, professor of law and direc
tor of the new Stanford Human Rights Center, turn
ing the Law School into one of the nation's preemi-

neni iorums ior uiougnuui ueuaie
on the world's most pressing hu
man rights issues is an effort well
worth undertaking and one that's
already well underway.
"I think we are not just on the
map, but well on the way to having
the leading human rights offerings
of any law school in the country,"
he said.

He will have to fit his plans in
between trips to Bolivia, where he and his students
are building a case against former Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and former defense min
ister Jose Carlos Sanchez Berzain for then' role in
massacring almost 70 unarmed citizens in 2003.
After all, Cavallaro is also the founder and direc
tor of Stanford's International Human Rights and
Conflict Resolution Clinic, which teaches students hu
man rights law by having them represent real victims

and which is, according to Cavallaro, "the best clinic
in the country."
Despite the relative youth of Stanford's human
rights programs the Clinic began when Cavallaro
came to Stanford Law School from Harvard in 2011,
and the Center was announced on Feb. 20 Caval
laro said he doesn't feel it will be long before they
rank above the comparable offerings at the nation's
other top law schools.
While that assertion may seem bold, Cavallaro al
so has the experience to support his projections. At
Harvard Law School, he led both the academic side of
Harvard's Human Rights Program the equivalent
of Stanford's Human Rights Center and the clini
cal side the equivalent of Stanford's International
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.
According to his former Harvard colleagues and
current co-directors of Harvard's Human Rights Pro
gram Gerald Neuman and lyier Giannini, Cavallaro
will be an excellent leader of Stanford's new Center
while continuing to direct the Clinic.
"I think he was a splendid choice for Stanford,"
Neuman said. "He's a very gifted, dedicated and en
thusiastic advocate and teacher of advocates. I think

complement to the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic, also led by Cavallaro.
