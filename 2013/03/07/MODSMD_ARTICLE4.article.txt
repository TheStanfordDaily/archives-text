## Law School opens Human Rights Center 
### DANNY GIFFORD DESK EDITOR 
For James Cavallaro, professor of law and direc
tor of the new Stanford Human Rights Center, turn
ing the Law School into one of the nation's preemi-

neni iorums ior uiougnuui ueuaie
on the world's most pressing hu
man rights issues is an effort well
worth undertaking and one that's
already well underway.
"I think we are not just on the
map, but well on the way to having
the leading human rights offerings
of any law school in the country,"
he said.

He will have to fit his plans in
between trips to Bolivia, where he and his students
are building a case against former Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and former defense min
ister Jose Carlos Sanchez Berzain for then' role in
massacring almost 70 unarmed citizens in 2003.
After all, Cavallaro is also the founder and direc
tor of Stanford's International Human Rights and
Conflict Resolution Clinic, which teaches students hu
man rights law by having them represent real victims

and which is, according to Cavallaro, "the best clinic
in the country."
Despite the relative youth of Stanford's human
rights programs the Clinic began when Cavallaro
came to Stanford Law School from Harvard in 2011,
and the Center was announced on Feb. 20 Caval
laro said he doesn't feel it will be long before they
rank above the comparable offerings at the nation's
other top law schools.
While that assertion may seem bold, Cavallaro al
so has the experience to support his projections. At
Harvard Law School, he led both the academic side of
Harvard's Human Rights Program the equivalent
of Stanford's Human Rights Center and the clini
cal side the equivalent of Stanford's International
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.
According to his former Harvard colleagues and
current co-directors of Harvard's Human Rights Pro
gram Gerald Neuman and lyier Giannini, Cavallaro
will be an excellent leader of Stanford's new Center
while continuing to direct the Clinic.
"I think he was a splendid choice for Stanford,"
Neuman said. "He's a very gifted, dedicated and en
thusiastic advocate and teacher of advocates. I think

he'll do a splendid job."
"Jim will be terrific. In the time
since we started the Human Rights
Program here at Harvard 30 years
ago, we've been gratified to see oth
er schools jump in to expand human
rights opportunities nationwide," Gi
annini wrote in a statement to The
Daily. "Our three faculty along with
our team of attorneys and fellows
look forward to exciting collabora
tions with Jim and the new Center."
Cavallaro said that the Center,
which will have a more reflective
role in examining human rights, and
the Clinic, which deals with human
rights issues more actively and tan
gibly, will collaborate closely and ul
timately produce a far more produc
tive and effective joint program.
"What we hope to do is develop a
center than can ask hard questions
and be critical and thoughtful and
theoretical, but also be very in
formed by practice," he said. "We
want those two sides to complement
each other in these kinds of events
that we have."
The Clinic: teaching advocacy by
doing advocacy
According to Cavallaro, the Clin
ic is not just the nation's best but is
also "unique among top law schools,"
set apart by its intensiveness.
Unlike students at peer institu
tions, Stanford law students take no
other classes when they spend a
quarter in the Clinic, resulting in an
immersive learning experience.
"They have, pretty much, no oth
er commitments, so they're full time
in the clinic. It makes it a very in
tense experience," Cavallaro said.

"It's particularly beneficial for inter
national human rights because most
of our work is overseas, and so we
want to be able to take students for
one, two, three weeks... to research
and document, and to speak with vic
tims and witnesses."
This unique clinical experience,
he said, would be impossible if it
weren't for the extensive funding
Stanford is capable of providing.
"There's no, 'Oh, we can only go
on one trip, we have a budget,"' he
said. "We have the resources to do
what we need to make sure that the
students are getting absolutely the
best legal training that they can
get."
According to Neuman, that train
ing is critical. He argued that while
clinics across the nation do impor
tant work combating human rights
violations in the present, one of their
most significant roles is preparing
the leading activists of tomorrow.
"Human rights clinics, in the
work that they d 0... are essential in
the training of qualified human
rights advocates who will have ca
reers helping to make a difference,"
he said, adding that these clinics al
low professors to "teach students in
human rights advocacy by doing hu
man rights advocacy."
The Center's reflective perspective
Though the Clinic may be among
nation's best, Cavallaro argued that
activist teaching and learning is only
one component of an elite human
rights program.
"If you look at the top law schools
in the country... all of them have
very robust human rights programs,
and they generally will have both the
clinical component and a more re
flective component," he said, identi
fying the new Center as the latter.

Cavallaro said that the Center
will offer a more academic take on

human rights issues through a col
lection of "speaker series, confer
ences, round tables and events that
lead to publications."
"In other words, it's a space for
critical intellectual engagement in...
human rights," he said.
This critical engagement is cru
cial, according to Neuman, but may
be lost in the frantic nature of clini
cal advocacy.
"Speaking as an academic, I
would put a lot of value on the reflec
tive study and criticism rather than
the unreflective participation in the
human rights field," he said. "I don't
mean to say that reflection doesn't
take place in clinics, [but] there's an
opportunity for more concentrated,
systematic examination of the field
in the academic way... and also the
production of scholarship that
shares with the world the reflec
tions."
"As practitioners you're often too
busy trying to get your work done to

take a step back and reflect on
broader questions," Cavallaro
agreed.
Stanford's Center will commence
its programming with a yearlong
speaker series titled "The Future of
Human Rights." Executive Director
of Human Rights Watch Ken Roth
whom Cavallaro called a "very
sharp, thoughtful, extremely well in
formed professional" will give the
first lecture on April 2. Other promi
nent speakers slated for the coming
months include Columbia University
Professor of Government Mahmood
Mamdani, Executive Director of the
U.S. Human Rights Network Ejim
Dike and Jenny Martinez, Warren
Christopher Professor in the Prac
tice of International Law and Diplo
macy.
The speaker series will be open
to the general public as part of Cav
allaro's efforts to make the Center
accessible to more than just the law
school and its students.

"We hope to reach out not just to
the law school but to the entire Stan
ford community and even beyond
that," he said. "We want the center
to be a reference both to Stanford
and beyond in terms of thinking
hard about the difficult issues in hu
man rights."
Ultimately, it is the interaction
and collaboration between the Clinic
and the Center that will bring Stan
ford's human rights program to the
frontier of the national debate, ac
cording to Cavallaro.
"We want to be on the forefront
of the questions and issues that are
in the debate, and we want to do that
in away that both is informed by
hard, critical thinking of theorists,
but also by the practical experience
of people and organizations that are
involved in intensive advocacy of hu
man rights," he said.

For James Cavallaro, professor of law and direc

neni iorums ior uiougnuui ueuaie
on the world's most pressing hu
man rights issues is an effort well
worth undertaking and one that's
already well underway.
"I think we are not just on the
map, but well on the way to having
the leading human rights offerings
of any law school in the country,"
he said.

He will have to fit his plans in
between trips to Bolivia, where he and his students
are building a case against former Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and former defense min
ister Jose Carlos Sanchez Berzain for then' role in
massacring almost 70 unarmed citizens in 2003.
After all, Cavallaro is also the founder and direc
tor of Stanford's International Human Rights and
Conflict Resolution Clinic, which teaches students hu
man rights law by having them represent real victims

and which is, according to Cavallaro, "the best clinic
in the country."
Despite the relative youth of Stanford's human
rights programs the Clinic began when Cavallaro
came to Stanford Law School from Harvard in 2011,
and the Center was announced on Feb. 20 Caval
laro said he doesn't feel it will be long before they
rank above the comparable offerings at the nation's
other top law schools.
While that assertion may seem bold, Cavallaro al
so has the experience to support his projections. At
Harvard Law School, he led both the academic side of
Harvard's Human Rights Program the equivalent
of Stanford's Human Rights Center and the clini
cal side the equivalent of Stanford's International
Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic.
According to his former Harvard colleagues and
current co-directors of Harvard's Human Rights Pro
gram Gerald Neuman and lyier Giannini, Cavallaro
will be an excellent leader of Stanford's new Center
while continuing to direct the Clinic.
"I think he was a splendid choice for Stanford,"
Neuman said. "He's a very gifted, dedicated and en
thusiastic advocate and teacher of advocates. I think

he'll do a splendid job."
"Jim will be terrific. In the time
since we started the Human Rights
Program here at Harvard 30 years
ago, we've been gratified to see oth
er schools jump in to expand human
rights opportunities nationwide," Gi
annini wrote in a statement to The
Daily. "Our three faculty along with
our team of attorneys and fellows
look forward to exciting collabora
tions with Jim and the new Center."
Cavallaro said that the Center,
which will have a more reflective
role in examining human rights, and
the Clinic, which deals with human
rights issues more actively and tan
gibly, will collaborate closely and ul
timately produce a far more produc
tive and effective joint program.
"What we hope to do is develop a
center than can ask hard questions
and be critical and thoughtful and
theoretical, but also be very in
formed by practice," he said. "We
want those two sides to complement
each other in these kinds of events
that we have."
The Clinic: teaching advocacy by
doing advocacy
According to Cavallaro, the Clin
ic is not just the nation's best but is
also "unique among top law schools,"
set apart by its intensiveness.
Unlike students at peer institu
tions, Stanford law students take no
other classes when they spend a
quarter in the Clinic, resulting in an
immersive learning experience.
"They have, pretty much, no oth
er commitments, so they're full time
in the clinic. It makes it a very in
tense experience," Cavallaro said.

"It's particularly beneficial for inter
national human rights because most
of our work is overseas, and so we
want to be able to take students for
one, two, three weeks... to research
and document, and to speak with vic
tims and witnesses."
This unique clinical experience,
he said, would be impossible if it
weren't for the extensive funding
Stanford is capable of providing.
"There's no, 'Oh, we can only go
on one trip, we have a budget,"' he
said. "We have the resources to do
what we need to make sure that the
students are getting absolutely the
best legal training that they can
get."
According to Neuman, that train
ing is critical. He argued that while
clinics across the nation do impor
tant work combating human rights
violations in the present, one of their
most significant roles is preparing
the leading activists of tomorrow.
"Human rights clinics, in the
work that they d 0... are essential in
the training of qualified human
rights advocates who will have ca
reers helping to make a difference,"
he said, adding that these clinics al
low professors to "teach students in
human rights advocacy by doing hu
man rights advocacy."
The Center's reflective perspective
Though the Clinic may be among
nation's best, Cavallaro argued that
activist teaching and learning is only
one component of an elite human
rights program.
"If you look at the top law schools
in the country... all of them have
very robust human rights programs,
and they generally will have both the
clinical component and a more re
flective component," he said, identi
fying the new Center as the latter.

Cavallaro said that the Center
will offer a more academic take on

human rights issues through a col
lection of "speaker series, confer
ences, round tables and events that
lead to publications."
"In other words, it's a space for
critical intellectual engagement in...
human rights," he said.
This critical engagement is cru
cial, according to Neuman, but may
be lost in the frantic nature of clini
cal advocacy.
"Speaking as an academic, I
would put a lot of value on the reflec
tive study and criticism rather than
the unreflective participation in the
human rights field," he said. "I don't
mean to say that reflection doesn't
take place in clinics, [but] there's an
opportunity for more concentrated,
systematic examination of the field
in the academic way... and also the
production of scholarship that
shares with the world the reflec
tions."
"As practitioners you're often too
busy trying to get your work done to

take a step back and reflect on
broader questions," Cavallaro
agreed.
Stanford's Center will commence
its programming with a yearlong
speaker series titled "The Future of
Human Rights." Executive Director
of Human Rights Watch Ken Roth
whom Cavallaro called a "very
sharp, thoughtful, extremely well in
formed professional" will give the
first lecture on April 2. Other promi
nent speakers slated for the coming
months include Columbia University
Professor of Government Mahmood
Mamdani, Executive Director of the
U.S. Human Rights Network Ejim
Dike and Jenny Martinez, Warren
Christopher Professor in the Prac
tice of International Law and Diplo
macy.
