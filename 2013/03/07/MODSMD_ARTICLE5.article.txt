# STUDENT GOVT
## Candidate knowledge falls short Prospective ASSU Senators struggle with duties, role 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While the 36 candidates who
have, to date, declared their intent
to run for the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate are uniform in enthusiasm
for their prospective role, many of
them may know little about the Sen
ate's operations and have only vague
ideas about what they hope to ac
complish as senators.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Brianna Pang 'l3, candidates
can inform themselves about the
Senate's role through the petitions
website, the Senate's website and an
optional information session.
However, many candidates were
unable to accurately describe the
Senate's basic responsibilities, such
as funding student groups, and
struggled to articulate specific plans
they would implement if elected.

Incumbent senators have been
heavily criticized this year by Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE)
representatives for their lack of
knowledge about and involvement in
the Senate's funding decisions, a
problem that seems likely to carry
over to next year's senators.
"I know that the Appropriations
Committee deals with [funding], al
locating the funds that they are giv
en," one candidate said. "They are
given about two to three billion dol
lars every year to distribute to dif
ferent groups on campus."
Senators actually allocate ap
proximately $300,000 towards stu
dent groups that receive general
fees each year. Senators also ap
prove approximately $70,000 in
funds to be allocated to student pub
lications through the Publications
Board, which is a separate entity
from the Senate.
This year, the Senate allocated
an additional $120,000 from then
buffer fund to general fees groups
through their new grants program
and another $13,000 from their Tra
ditions Fund.
While the Senate spends the ma
jority of the year dealing with gen
eral fees requests, seven out of eight
candidates interviewed only knew
about special fees funding. The
eighth candidate did not know about
either kind of funding.
"I know that there is special fees
that the Senate takes care of and al
locates to different student groups,"
one candidate said. "Just around this
time of year, student groups are
passing around petitions for stu
dents to sign so that they can pass
on their request for student fees to
the Senate so that they can have
some money to spend throughout
the year."
The student body, not the Sen
ate, votes on special fees budgets,
though the Senate does vote budg
ets onto the ballot for groups that
petition 10 percent of the relevant
student population or do not have to
petition the student body. However,
