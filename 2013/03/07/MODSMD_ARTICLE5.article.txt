## Candidate knowledge falls short Prospective ASSU Senators struggle with duties, role 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While the 36 candidates who
have, to date, declared their intent
to run for the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate are uniform in enthusiasm
for their prospective role, many of
them may know little about the Sen
ate's operations and have only vague
ideas about what they hope to ac
complish as senators.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Brianna Pang 'l3, candidates
can inform themselves about the
Senate's role through the petitions
website, the Senate's website and an
optional information session.
However, many candidates were
unable to accurately describe the
Senate's basic responsibilities, such
as funding student groups, and
struggled to articulate specific plans
they would implement if elected.
Following the money
Incumbent senators have been
heavily criticized this year by Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE)
representatives for their lack of
knowledge about and involvement in
the Senate's funding decisions, a
problem that seems likely to carry
over to next year's senators.
"I know that the Appropriations
Committee deals with [funding], al
locating the funds that they are giv
en," one candidate said. "They are
given about two to three billion dol
lars every year to distribute to dif
ferent groups on campus."
Senators actually allocate ap
proximately $300,000 towards stu
dent groups that receive general
fees each year. Senators also ap
prove approximately $70,000 in
funds to be allocated to student pub
lications through the Publications
Board, which is a separate entity
from the Senate.
This year, the Senate allocated
an additional $120,000 from then
buffer fund to general fees groups
through their new grants program
and another $13,000 from their Tra
ditions Fund.
While the Senate spends the ma
jority of the year dealing with gen
eral fees requests, seven out of eight
candidates interviewed only knew
about special fees funding. The
eighth candidate did not know about
either kind of funding.
"I know that there is special fees
that the Senate takes care of and al
locates to different student groups,"
one candidate said. "Just around this
time of year, student groups are
passing around petitions for stu
dents to sign so that they can pass
on their request for student fees to
the Senate so that they can have
some money to spend throughout
the year."
The student body, not the Sen
ate, votes on special fees budgets,
though the Senate does vote budg
ets onto the ballot for groups that
petition 10 percent of the relevant
student population or do not have to
petition the student body. However,
the student body still votes to ap
prove special fees budgets for these
groups.
When asked how they felt about
the Senate's process for funding stu
dent groups, the majority of candi
dates said that they did not intend to
focus on funding during their time in
the Senate.
One candidate, who claimed that
"appropriations is not big in my ex
perience within the ASSU," said that
he planned to support student events
outside of granting funds, and spoke
of bypassing the funding process.
"I'm talking more manpower, in
terms of organizing, in terms of get
ting venues and organizing re
sources, the ASSU clearly doesn't
require any legislative approval that
normal assistance would normally
require," he said.
When asked to clarify what he
meant by this, the candidate began
talking about another topic.
The Senate's role
Other Senate candidates were
confused about the Senate's role on
campus, with some positing that the
Senate's primary purpose is to host
events.
"Planning a lot of events, that's
really exciting," one candidate said.
"The Senate plans the sophomore
dance or something, and a lot of oth
er events and we have money that
we can budget to whatever we
want."
The Sophomore Class Presi
dents are responsible for planning
sophomore formal. Several candi
dates spoke of other events that
they mistakenly believed the Senate
had hosted.
"I feel like the events that the
Senate has put on have been really
important for students transitioning
into freshmen year," another candi
date said. "I love the things that
they've put on about increasing
awareness about mental health and
reaching out for things like that."
According to Senator Lauren
Miller 'l5, this year's Senate has not
hosted any events, though they plan
to co-sponsor several events during
dead week.
Many candidates spoke of the
importance of the Senate on cam
pus, with one candidate claiming
that, "when you do the math," each
senator represents 800 to 900 stu
dents. In reality, the correct number

is around 450 undergraduates.
Other candidates believe that
the Senate should have a more dom
inant presence on campus. One can
didate said that he is running be
cause he wants to solve what he sees
as the ASSU's largest problem
that it is not the "central figure on
campus." He said that the Senate
should be "depended on" instead of
having "various groups doing their
own little thing."
In his candidate statement, Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 also spoke of the
importance of Senate leadership, cit
ing a rather unusual set of personal
experiences as qualifications and
mentioning his opposition to Russ
ian President Vladimir Putin.
"I'm also pretty good at coordi
nating organized action," he wrote.
"Comes from the days of running
away from Moscow riot police at an
ti-Putin protest marches."
While candidates had differing
views of the role of the Senate, most
agreed that the student body does
not fully understand the importance
of the role senators play on campus.
"A lot of students are unfortu
nately really ignorant about the Sen
ate during their freshman year," one
candidate said. "I think it would be
really important to educate more
freshmen, maybe next year, on what
the Senate does and how they can be
aware."
Plans for Senate
When asked what they planned
to do if elected, most candidates
were extremely vague, citing
"breaking down barriers," "bridging
gaps" and "increasing transparen
cy" as their primary goals. The ma
jority of candidates did not provide
details on their specific goals and
how they planned to achieve them,
though one candidate suggested
having The Daily publish special re
ports about the Senate's progress.
The Daily currently sends a re
porter to the Senate's meeting each
Tuesday and runs an article on the
Senate's business in each Wednes
day's paper.
Ryan Matsumoto 'l6 took issue
with these generalizations in his
Senate candidate statement.

"It seems that year after year,
election after election, ASSU Senate
candidates make the same claims,"
Matsumoto wrote. "They claim to
want to 'reform' the ASSU, 'improve
transparency,' and 'listen to the
needs of the student body.'"
Mouzykantskii also criticized the
other candidates for their vague
platforms and inaction, claiming in
his candidate statement: "I've done

shit. They haven't. Vote for me."
"I'm pretty much the only candi
date here that got up and actually
did something for the student body
because they gave a toss,"
Mouzykantskii said in his statement.
Mouzykantskii cited his work in
helping to organize a protest against
Residential Education's decision to
end the student-run management of
Suites Dining and creating a petition
against a proposal to ban double
booking classes and start classes at
8:30 a.m.
Other candidates referenced
similar controversies, including the
farewell editorials in The Daily by
Billy Gallagher and Brendan
O'Byrne and the divestment de
bates at recent Senate meetings, as
the reasons they became interested
in running for Senate.
"I'm going to be honest, at the
beginning of the year I had no idea
about [the] ASSU," one candidate
said. "I heard about [the] ASSU in
maybe January."
A historical issue
Ignorance about the Senate's re
sponsibilities and uncertainty about
what candidates hope to accomplish
are not unique to this year's crop of
aspiring senators, however.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 said
that during his campaign for Senate
last year, he was "just kind of enam
ored by the idea of student govern
ment" but was not particularly
knowledgeable about the ASSU. Al
though Bindra could not speak for
the entire Senate, he said that he
believed this was true for "at least a
few other people running."
Bindra said that because most of
the Senate's work is done "behind
the scenes," candidates who don't
take the time to research the Sen
ate's responsibilities might not fully
understand what falls within the
Senate's purview.
According to Bindra, next year's
Senate would be able to accomplish
more if candidates became better
informed about the role of the Sen
ate and formulated concrete ideas of
what they planned to do in office.
"In terms of them developing
substantive platforms or being able
to come with good ideas that they
start off their Senate term rolling, I
would expect a little bit more,"
Bindra said. "People can actually do
a lot of things during [the time be
fore summer quarter]. That could
be used much more efficiently if
people were up to date on that."

Senate's primary purpose is to host
events.
"Planning a lot of events, that's
really exciting," one candidate said.
"The Senate plans the sophomore
dance or something, and a lot of oth
er events and we have money that
we can budget to whatever we
want."
The Sophomore Class Presi
dents are responsible for planning
sophomore formal. Several candi
dates spoke of other events that
they mistakenly believed the Senate
had hosted.
"I feel like the events that the
Senate has put on have been really
important for students transitioning
into freshmen year," another candi
date said. "I love the things that
they've put on about increasing
awareness about mental health and
reaching out for things like that."
According to Senator Lauren
Miller 'l5, this year's Senate has not
hosted any events, though they plan
to co-sponsor several events during
dead week.
Many candidates spoke of the
importance of the Senate on cam
pus, with one candidate claiming
that, "when you do the math," each
senator represents 800 to 900 stu
dents. In reality, the correct number

is around 450 undergraduates.
Other candidates believe that
the Senate should have a more dom
inant presence on campus. One can
didate said that he is running be
cause he wants to solve what he sees
as the ASSU's largest problem
that it is not the "central figure on
campus." He said that the Senate
should be "depended on" instead of
having "various groups doing their
own little thing."
In his candidate statement, Ilya
Mouzykantskii 'l6 also spoke of the
importance of Senate leadership, cit
ing a rather unusual set of personal
experiences as qualifications and
mentioning his opposition to Russ
ian President Vladimir Putin.
"I'm also pretty good at coordi
nating organized action," he wrote.
"Comes from the days of running
away from Moscow riot police at an
ti-Putin protest marches."
While candidates had differing
views of the role of the Senate, most
agreed that the student body does
not fully understand the importance
of the role senators play on campus.
"A lot of students are unfortu
nately really ignorant about the Sen
ate during their freshman year," one
candidate said. "I think it would be
really important to educate more
freshmen, maybe next year, on what
the Senate does and how they can be
aware."
Plans for Senate
When asked what they planned
to do if elected, most candidates
were extremely vague, citing
"breaking down barriers," "bridging
gaps" and "increasing transparen
cy" as their primary goals. The ma
jority of candidates did not provide
details on their specific goals and
how they planned to achieve them,
though one candidate suggested
having The Daily publish special re
ports about the Senate's progress.
The Daily currently sends a re
porter to the Senate's meeting each
Tuesday and runs an article on the
Senate's business in each Wednes
day's paper.
Ryan Matsumoto 'l6 took issue
with these generalizations in his
Senate candidate statement.

"It seems that year after year,
election after election, ASSU Senate
candidates make the same claims,"
Matsumoto wrote. "They claim to
want to 'reform' the ASSU, 'improve
transparency,' and 'listen to the
needs of the student body.'"
Mouzykantskii also criticized the
other candidates for their vague
platforms and inaction, claiming in
his candidate statement: "I've done

shit. They haven't. Vote for me."
"I'm pretty much the only candi
date here that got up and actually
did something for the student body
because they gave a toss,"
Mouzykantskii said in his statement.
Mouzykantskii cited his work in
helping to organize a protest against
Residential Education's decision to
end the student-run management of
Suites Dining and creating a petition
against a proposal to ban double
booking classes and start classes at
8:30 a.m.
Other candidates referenced
similar controversies, including the
farewell editorials in The Daily by
Billy Gallagher and Brendan
O'Byrne and the divestment de
bates at recent Senate meetings, as
the reasons they became interested
in running for Senate.
"I'm going to be honest, at the
beginning of the year I had no idea
about [the] ASSU," one candidate
said. "I heard about [the] ASSU in
maybe January."
A historical issue
Ignorance about the Senate's re
sponsibilities and uncertainty about
what candidates hope to accomplish
are not unique to this year's crop of
aspiring senators, however.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 said
that during his campaign for Senate
last year, he was "just kind of enam
ored by the idea of student govern
ment" but was not particularly
knowledgeable about the ASSU. Al
though Bindra could not speak for
the entire Senate, he said that he
believed this was true for "at least a
few other people running."
Bindra said that because most of
the Senate's work is done "behind
the scenes," candidates who don't
take the time to research the Sen
ate's responsibilities might not fully
understand what falls within the
Senate's purview.
According to Bindra, next year's
Senate would be able to accomplish
more if candidates became better
informed about the role of the Sen
ate and formulated concrete ideas of
what they planned to do in office.
"In terms of them developing
substantive platforms or being able
to come with good ideas that they
start off their Senate term rolling, I
would expect a little bit more,"
Bindra said. "People can actually do
a lot of things during [the time be
fore summer quarter]. That could
be used much more efficiently if
people were up to date on that."

While the 36 candidates who
have, to date, declared their intent
to run for the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate are uniform in enthusiasm
for their prospective role, many of
them may know little about the Sen
ate's operations and have only vague
ideas about what they hope to ac
complish as senators.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Brianna Pang 'l3, candidates
can inform themselves about the
Senate's role through the petitions
website, the Senate's website and an
optional information session.
However, many candidates were
unable to accurately describe the
Senate's basic responsibilities, such
as funding student groups, and
struggled to articulate specific plans
they would implement if elected.
Following the money
Incumbent senators have been
heavily criticized this year by Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE)
representatives for their lack of
knowledge about and involvement in
the Senate's funding decisions, a
problem that seems likely to carry
over to next year's senators.
"I know that the Appropriations
Committee deals with [funding], al
locating the funds that they are giv
en," one candidate said. "They are
given about two to three billion dol
lars every year to distribute to dif
ferent groups on campus."
Senators actually allocate ap
proximately $300,000 towards stu
dent groups that receive general
fees each year. Senators also ap
prove approximately $70,000 in
funds to be allocated to student pub
lications through the Publications
Board, which is a separate entity
from the Senate.
This year, the Senate allocated
an additional $120,000 from then
buffer fund to general fees groups
through their new grants program
and another $13,000 from their Tra
ditions Fund.
While the Senate spends the ma
jority of the year dealing with gen
eral fees requests, seven out of eight
candidates interviewed only knew
about special fees funding. The
eighth candidate did not know about
either kind of funding.
"I know that there is special fees
that the Senate takes care of and al
locates to different student groups,"
one candidate said. "Just around this
time of year, student groups are
passing around petitions for stu
dents to sign so that they can pass
on their request for student fees to
the Senate so that they can have
some money to spend throughout
the year."
The student body, not the Sen
ate, votes on special fees budgets,
though the Senate does vote budg
ets onto the ballot for groups that
petition 10 percent of the relevant
student population or do not have to
petition the student body. However,
the student body still votes to ap
prove special fees budgets for these
groups.
When asked how they felt about
the Senate's process for funding stu
dent groups, the majority of candi
dates said that they did not intend to
focus on funding during their time in
the Senate.
One candidate, who claimed that
"appropriations is not big in my ex
perience within the ASSU," said that
he planned to support student events
outside of granting funds, and spoke
of bypassing the funding process.
"I'm talking more manpower, in
terms of organizing, in terms of get
ting venues and organizing re
sources, the ASSU clearly doesn't
require any legislative approval that
normal assistance would normally
require," he said.
When asked to clarify what he
meant by this, the candidate began
talking about another topic.

Other Senate candidates were
confused about the Senate's role on
campus, with some positing that the

date here that got up and actually
did something for the student body
because they gave a toss,"
Mouzykantskii said in his statement.
Mouzykantskii cited his work in
helping to organize a protest against
Residential Education's decision to
end the student-run management of
Suites Dining and creating a petition
against a proposal to ban double
booking classes and start classes at
8:30 a.m.
Other candidates referenced
similar controversies, including the
farewell editorials in The Daily by
Billy Gallagher and Brendan
O'Byrne and the divestment de
bates at recent Senate meetings, as
the reasons they became interested
in running for Senate.
"I'm going to be honest, at the
beginning of the year I had no idea
about [the] ASSU," one candidate
said. "I heard about [the] ASSU in
maybe January."
A historical issue
Ignorance about the Senate's re
sponsibilities and uncertainty about
what candidates hope to accomplish
are not unique to this year's crop of
aspiring senators, however.
Senator Viraj Bindra 'l5 said
that during his campaign for Senate
last year, he was "just kind of enam
ored by the idea of student govern
ment" but was not particularly
knowledgeable about the ASSU. Al
though Bindra could not speak for
the entire Senate, he said that he
believed this was true for "at least a
few other people running."
Bindra said that because most of
the Senate's work is done "behind
the scenes," candidates who don't
take the time to research the Sen
ate's responsibilities might not fully
understand what falls within the
Senate's purview.
According to Bindra, next year's
Senate would be able to accomplish
more if candidates became better
informed about the role of the Sen
ate and formulated concrete ideas of
what they planned to do in office.
"In terms of them developing
substantive platforms or being able
to come with good ideas that they
start off their Senate term rolling, I
would expect a little bit more,"
Bindra said. "People can actually do
a lot of things during [the time be
fore summer quarter]. That could
be used much more efficiently if
people were up to date on that."
