## Online campaign raises student support for DREAM Act 
### SOO JI LEE 
As President Barack Obama
begins his second term with a fo
cus on overhauling the United
States' immigration system, calls
for immigration reform have tak
en a new turn on campus as "The
Dream Is Now" campaign solicits
student pressure on Congress to
pass the Development, Relief and
Education for Alien Minors
(DREAM) Act.
Among other initiatives, the
online campaign which is led by
philanthropist Laurene Powell

Jobs MBA '9l and filmmaker
Davis Guggenheim has focused
on college outreach, enlisting stu
dents as campus ambassadors to
compile sympathetic stories from
peers and mustering support for
the DREAM Act.
"Our goal is simple to put a
face on immigration reform," said
Ruben Candeo, the campaign's
college outreach director, in a
press conference call on Tuesday.
?Juany Torres 'l3 has played a
prominent role in Stanford's immi
gration reform movement as The
Dream is Now's lead campus rep

resentative and student ambassa
dor. A daughter of immigrants and
a native of San Antonio, Torres
framed the issue of immigration
reform as one of personal signifi
cance.
"My parents wouldn't have the
opportunity to be citizens and res
idents here legally if it hadn't been
for 1986 amnesty," she said. "It's
important to give that opportunity
to other people."?
Supporters can sign petitions,
upload photos and share their sto
ries through videos on the cam
paign's website. A documentary

by Guggenheim on the subject will
also premiere in April as part of
the campaign.
"If we're not careful, all this
momentum which is building be
cause of the last election and the
urgency might just go away,"
Guggenheim, who directed Wait
ing for Superman and An Incon
venient Truth, said in the press
conference call. "There are
dreams of people are hanging in
the balance. If we don't do every
thing we can, it would be a
shame."
Some videos published by the
campaign have already gained sig
nificant publicity. One such clip,
featuring University of California,
Berkeley student Terrence Park,
focuses on his undocumented sta
tus and potential financial difficul
ties if he accepts a spot in Yale's
biostatics program. The video has
received over 12,000 views to date.
"There is so much potential
here to generate real grassroots
energy and support to fix our bro
ken immigration system," Guggen
heim said.

While Stanford currently has
only two student ambassadors, in
cluding Torres, the DREAM Act
has also gained support from sen
ior administrators. In December
2010, President John Hennessy
and Harvard President Drew
Faust co-wrote an editorial calling
for Congress to pass the act. Tor
res, however, argued for immedi
ate efforts to cultivate campus
awareness and involvement.
"We should have coalitions built
within student groups to continue
the conversation," she said. "I do
believe that we have the support
but it might not be as visible as we
want it to be. And so this project is
really going to allow us to shed
some light on that."?
Phil Salazar 'l6 described his in
volvement with the campaign as a

complete coincidence, having run
into a campaign camera crew at El
Centro Chicano. Salazar's video is
now one of many of the campaign's
website and, having since found out
that a close friend is undocument
ed, he emphasized the potential to
change perceptions of the undocu
mented community on campus.
"He doesn't have the same re
search opportunities or summer
opportunities here at Stanford ... I
think that's a little unfair," Salazar
said. "There's a sweeping general
ization by a lot of people that
they're freeloaders or they should
n't be here. That's a tough general
ization to make. They're no differ
ent from us."
