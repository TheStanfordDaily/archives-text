## Researcher to send fruit flies to space Insects to mimic human cardiovascular activity 
### NITISH KULKARNI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Once the first animals sent into
space, fruit flies could soon be return
ing to the stars, this time as part of a
experiment studying the insects' car
diovascular systems in space devel
oped by a team including School of
Medicine heart surgeon Peter Lee.
The experiment, which combines
Lee's interests in spaceflight and bi
ological research, was one of eight
selected in a national research com
petition hosted by Space Florida. All
of the winning experiments will be
transported to the International
Space Station on a SpaceX Falcon 9
rocket mission from the Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station be
tween September and December
2013.
"I'm happy we got the award,
and very excited about it," Lee said.
"Surely getting free access to space
flights is not easy."
While this experiment will be
conducted with fruit flies, Lee said
that the experiment will allow him
to study potential long-term micro
gravity effects on the human car
diovascular system by analyzing
the flies' own systems upon their
return.
Lee collaborated with Karen
Ocorr and Rolf Bodmer from the
Sanford-Burnham Medical Re
search Institute and with Sharmila
Bhattacharya from the NASA Ames
Research Center on the project.
Ocorr is an assistant professor in
the Institute's Neuroscience, Aging
and Stem Cell Research Center, and
Bodmer is a professor in the same
program and director of the Insti
tute's Development and Aging Pro
gram. Both have extensively re
searched the heart functions of fruit
flies.

Bhattaeharya, who has worked
at NASA for almost 14 years, is the

head of the Biomodel Performance
and Behavior Laboratory at the
Ames Research Center and has con
ducted postdoctoral research in neu
robiology at Stanford.
Bhattacharya said that she was
eager to join the research team, not
ing that fruit flies have been used
successfully in many previous micro
gravity experiments.
"I thought it was a great idea,"
Bhattacharya said. "We came up
with a game plan for something
which is very doable."
Oeorr said that the cardiovascu
lar system of fruit flies is relatively
similar to that of humans. According
to Ocorr, the fruit fly is the only crea
ture with a cardiovascular system
that can adequately recreate long
term spaceflight in a realistic
amount of time.
'Astronauts have a problem of
facing muscular [defeneration,"
she said. "We had built many models
to try and predict and counter the
effects of this, but the fruit fly has a
great conservation of function."
Lee also cited several other ad
vantages to using fruit flies, includ
ing their small size allowing re
searchers to fit a large sample size
into a small canister and the fact
that the fruit fly genome has already
been sequenced.
"You can create a lot of combina
tions and permutations, not just
based on genetics," Lee said. "You
can affect nutrition, and so on."
Bodmer echoed Lee's sentiments
about the advantages of using fruit
flies and noted that a fly's entire life
cycle could be spent in orbit, with
several generations of flies born dur
ing the flight.
"This entire lifetime can accu
rately simulate the effects on a hu
man being of long-term flight, to say,
Mars," he said. "NASA is looking to
get a [manned] mission to Mars in
the near future, and this research is
needed to understand long-term
spaceflight."
