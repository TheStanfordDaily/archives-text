## SEEING GREEN 'Eli eli' Kau Mai 
### Holly Moeller 
Kalapana, HI Li Ling is my
hero, I think, as she tramps
tirelessly beside me. It's just
past six in the morning; we've been
awake for more than two hours and
hiking across a pitch-black lava rock
field for one. The night is at last
slowly lightening, leaving us feeling
more sure-footed on the uneven ter
rain. Just in time, too: We're ap
proaching the active flow zone,
where a careless step could plunge
someone's extremity into 200-degree
molten lava.
We've come here in darkness to
see day begin at the place where
land is being born. Kilauea Volcano
has been erupting on the Big Island
of Hawaii with startling regularity,
usually with surface flows accessible
to the sturdy hiker. Its reliability has
endeared it to geologists and visi
tors, if not to local homeowners.
Kilauea tells the story of how all
the Hawaiian islands were born:
through the gradual but inexorable
accumulation of molten rock,
squeezed through the Earth's crust
to form little fragments of what most
of us would call paradise. But a bare
lava field is hardly as inviting as a
lush tropical jungle or a warm ocean
filled with coral.
Li Ling and I will see both later
today. We will hike atop ancient soils
while visiting waterfalls north of Hi
lo. This soil accumulated over hun
dreds of millennia, through the work
of both biotic (living) and abiotic
(non-living) forces. A trickle of rain
fall here, a gradually expanding fern
or v ohf a tree root system there, and
slowly the lava rock breaks down.
Dirt accumulates in crevices, hosts
new plant life and the occasional in
sect. Eventually, a lush forest, re
plete with epiphytes and birdsong,
stands where once there was bare,
dry rock.
At the coast, Kilauea has created
a series of steam plumes where lava
is pouring into the sea. The waves
crash violently against the cliff face
and fall, hissing, back.
Yet just 15 miles away, a lava flow
from 500 years ago has turned into a
series of placid tide pools where we
will spend our late afternoon snorkel
ing. The corals there are some of the
most diverse on the island, and the fish
seem cheerfully unconcerned about ei
ther geologic or anthropologic goings
on. That reef is decades old, built by
the tirelessly steady efforts of coral
polyps that drifted in by chance from
the sea.
At the tide pools, parrotfish are
already hard at work turning coral
into sand. The breaking waves at the
reef crest will eventually puncture
the rock walls and scoop away the

reef. Up in the lush rainforest, the
waterfalls and streams we so admire
are themselves eroding away the
land. One has only to look at all the
members of the Hawaiian Island
chain, which extends all the way out
to lonely Kure Atoll and then to a
string of seamounts beyond, to know
that the Big Island, too, will eventu
ally sink down beneath the waves.
Li Ling and I savored our ability
to view this process of geological
birth and death so intimately within
such a short span of distance and
time. The inexorable power of these
forces is both awe-inspiring and
overwhelming. I can memorize facts
about lava flow age, rock chemistry
and weathering rates, but some
times I feel sure that I really know
nothing about these phenomena that
happen on a timescale so much
grander than my own.
In away, this endless process is
also reassuring. All rivers flow to the
sea; all mountains are slowly washed
away. Sediment sinks to the sea floor,
is sucked beneath a continental
plate, melted into new rock and re
turned to the surface by a volcano.
The marks we humans make on the
surface of the planet are mere
scratches in the geological record,
important to us and other living
things, but ultimately impermanent.
A friendly geologist we met on
our hike offers us a long stem of sug
ar cane. He explains how to safely
poke at the lava and, almost as an af
terthought, tosses me a pair of
gloves.
I edge closer and feel the heat of
the molten rock like the open door of
a pizza oven. Slowly, I extend the
cane, punching through the rapidly
cooling outer layers to scoop at the
molten red beneath. For a brief mo
ment, I hold the world's youngest
rock at the end of a six-foot pole.
I once read a Hawaiian phrase
uniquely suited for moments like
this: "Eli eli kau mai." Let awe pos
sess me.
The fragment of rock falls from
the cane, hits the cooled flow below
and shatters. Shortly, it's covered by
the advancing lava. In a heartbeat,
my little disruption in the process of
rock birth is erased.

into sand. The breaking waves at the
reef crest will eventually puncture
the rock walls and scoop away the

reef. Up in the lush rainforest, the
waterfalls and streams we so admire
are themselves eroding away the
land. One has only to look at all the
members of the Hawaiian Island
chain, which extends all the way out
to lonely Kure Atoll and then to a
string of seamounts beyond, to know
that the Big Island, too, will eventu
ally sink down beneath the waves.
Li Ling and I savored our ability
to view this process of geological
birth and death so intimately within
such a short span of distance and
time. The inexorable power of these
forces is both awe-inspiring and
overwhelming. I can memorize facts
about lava flow age, rock chemistry
and weathering rates, but some
times I feel sure that I really know
nothing about these phenomena that
happen on a timescale so much
grander than my own.
In away, this endless process is
also reassuring. All rivers flow to the
sea; all mountains are slowly washed
away. Sediment sinks to the sea floor,
is sucked beneath a continental
plate, melted into new rock and re
turned to the surface by a volcano.
The marks we humans make on the
surface of the planet are mere
scratches in the geological record,
important to us and other living
things, but ultimately impermanent.
A friendly geologist we met on
our hike offers us a long stem of sug
ar cane. He explains how to safely
poke at the lava and, almost as an af
terthought, tosses me a pair of
gloves.
I edge closer and feel the heat of
the molten rock like the open door of
a pizza oven. Slowly, I extend the
cane, punching through the rapidly
cooling outer layers to scoop at the
molten red beneath. For a brief mo
ment, I hold the world's youngest
rock at the end of a six-foot pole.
I once read a Hawaiian phrase
uniquely suited for moments like
this: "Eli eli kau mai." Let awe pos
sess me.
The fragment of rock falls from
the cane, hits the cooled flow below
and shatters. Shortly, it's covered by
the advancing lava. In a heartbeat,
my little disruption in the process of
rock birth is erased.
