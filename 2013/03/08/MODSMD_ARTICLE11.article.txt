## Resisting Amnesia: Understanding the Suites takeover in light of XOX 
### ELIF TASAR '12 XOX Social Manager 2010-11 XOX House Manager 2011-12 
This op-ed is the first in a two
part- series comparing the pro
posed Suites takeover with the
University's decision to termi
nate the lease of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) last year. Look for the
second part in our Dead Week
issue on Wednesday.
The heartbreak of unfair loss has
haunted me for just over a year
now. It was on Feb. 8, 2012
when a handful of members of Resi
dential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) and the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs (VPSA),
which oversees Residential Educa
tion (ResEd), ambushed student
manager and alumni representatives
of the XOX community, in what was
planned to be a routine meeting, with

a notice of their decision to terminate
our alumni's ground lease with the
University.
Among the many responses to a
call-for-help email sent out to alumni
and residents that night, one rings
through my brain as I read The Dai
ly's coverage of the University's at
tempt to take over student manage
ment of Suites Dining. It came from
an alumnus who, like myself, had
been a house manager during the
second-most-recent attempt by the
administration to seize the house, in
1986. He informed me that, with
great effort and some incompletes
taken that quarter, the XOX commu
nity managed to push to keep its in
dependence. He warned me to "keep
in mind that they'll get the house
someday, decide how much it matters

whether it's on your watch ...can't
say it was or is the civil rights issue of
the era."
Long story short: it did matter
to me and others in the community
that it was on our watch. We
raised hell. After quickly dismantling
the few reasons for termination stat
ed in the notice and launching a PR
tempest to demonstrate the signifi
cance of XOX's independence, we got
them to sit down with us and negoti
ate.
Fast-forward to August: after
countless hours of volunteer effort
and nearly $lOO,OOO spent in legal
fees on an uphill battle in which we
assumed good faith on the adminis
tration's part despite consistent evi-
