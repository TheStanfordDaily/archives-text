## Resisting Amnesia: Understanding the Suites takeover in light of XOX 
### ELIF TASAR '12 XOX Social Manager 2010-11 XOX House Manager 2011-12 
This op-ed is the first in a two
part- series comparing the pro
posed Suites takeover with the
University's decision to termi
nate the lease of Chi Theta Chi
(XOX) last year. Look for the
second part in our Dead Week
issue on Wednesday.
The heartbreak of unfair loss has
haunted me for just over a year
now. It was on Feb. 8, 2012
when a handful of members of Resi
dential & Dining Enterprises
(R&DE) and the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs (VPSA),
which oversees Residential Educa
tion (ResEd), ambushed student
manager and alumni representatives
of the XOX community, in what was
planned to be a routine meeting, with

a notice of their decision to terminate
our alumni's ground lease with the
University.
Among the many responses to a
call-for-help email sent out to alumni
and residents that night, one rings
through my brain as I read The Dai
ly's coverage of the University's at
tempt to take over student manage
ment of Suites Dining. It came from
an alumnus who, like myself, had
been a house manager during the
second-most-recent attempt by the
administration to seize the house, in
1986. He informed me that, with
great effort and some incompletes
taken that quarter, the XOX commu
nity managed to push to keep its in
dependence. He warned me to "keep
in mind that they'll get the house
someday, decide how much it matters

whether it's on your watch ...can't
say it was or is the civil rights issue of
the era."
Long story short: it did matter
to me and others in the community
that it was on our watch. We
raised hell. After quickly dismantling
the few reasons for termination stat
ed in the notice and launching a PR
tempest to demonstrate the signifi
cance of XOX's independence, we got
them to sit down with us and negoti
ate.
Fast-forward to August: after
countless hours of volunteer effort
and nearly $lOO,OOO spent in legal
fees on an uphill battle in which we
assumed good faith on the adminis
tration's part despite consistent evi-
dence to the contrary, our
group was able to grasp the
full picture of the "indepen
dence" offer being made to
us and the spirit underly
ing it. We could no longer
kid ourselves into inter
preting the administra
tion's offer as anything but
its pathetic reality: the op
portunity to apply for a
new lease that would return
management to the alumni,
without any legal ownership
of the house or even the
ability to make small re
pairs and improvements
without approval. At the
same time, those renova
tion choices were not to be
dictated by the needs of the
students, but rather by the
rhythms of a scaled proper
ty-management model that
makes little sense for a small
organization managing a sin
gle property. The bottom
line, though, is that we were
forced to walk away.
If that sounds like a dis
mal perspective on Res Ed's
decision with respect to
Suites, let me share more
parallels between the two
situations. Ultimately, these
takeovers represent two
shameful acts of the ResEd
and R&DE bureaucracy's pa
ternalism, an institutional at
titude that systematically
suppresses rare opportuni
ties for self-determination in
student life. The similarities
are frightening.

Failure to solicit and priori
tize student opinion
As with Suites, members
of our community were unex
pectedly notified that a deci
sion that would seriously im
pact them had already been
made.
The PR campaign XOX
ran was robust and highly ef
fective in demonstrating stu
dent opinion. It included sev
eral interviews with local re
porters; a story on local tele
vision; videos and posts on
every social media forum
available; interviews with
KZSU, an online petition that
garnered over 1,000 signa
tures; multiple op-eds in The
Daily; a Stanford Magazine
story; a successful letter and
phone call campaign to Vice
Provost Boardman, Provost
Etchemendy and President
Hennessy; student-initiated
meetings with administrators
including conversations over
homemade lunches at the
house; a community-wide
event that was serenaded by
the Stanford Band; a unani
mous vote for independence
by the ASSU Senate and the
Berkeley co-ops; and a march
and protest at the VPSA by
nearly a hundred students
from all parts of campus in
which residents delivered a
manifesto on the meaning of
XOX's independence. Based
on the zeal Suites advocates
have demonstrated in the
past two weeks, I imagine
they will pursue a similar ef
fort.
Just as Suites once provid
ed a relatively cheap housing
and dining service to stu
dents, XOX offered a similar

ly affordable option the
cheapest total quarterly room
and board of any on-campus
residence. And because both
were run efficiently by small
nonprofits with no University
overhead, both provided
more bang for each student's
buck. Returning residents in
XOX are frustrated with few
er food options this year, since
R&DE removes 20 percent of
the board bill before allotting
it to kitchen managers,
whereas in past years the en
tire board bill was spent direct
ly on residents.
Reading fragments from
Bollard head chef Rank Has
san's cherished letters from stu
dents, I immediately recall the
testimonies of signees of our
Save XOX petition. Just as
Rank's students consider the
familial relationships he fosters
with them to be singular among
Stanford's dining services, XOX
supporters described the house
as a cultural outlet "for the cre
ative, the passionate, the revolu
tionary" a rare "outpost of west
coast FUNK on all of Stanford's
palmy-league campus."
Given these success stories
in education through student
ownership, how can the admin
istration's standardized asset
management possibly take
precedence over the student ex
perience?

and for more similarities be
tween the XOX takeover and
Suites Dining, see our Dead
Week issue on Wednesday.
