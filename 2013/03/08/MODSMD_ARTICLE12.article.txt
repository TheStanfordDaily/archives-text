## STREAKING Baseball rides nine-win streak, welcomes UNLV 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
A nine-game winning streak is great, sure. But
as No. 10 Stanford prepares to host unranked UN
LV (10-3) at Sunken Diamond this weekend, the
Cardinal (10-2) isn't getting ahead of itself. Well, at
least senior Dean McArdle isn't.
"Nine wins in February and March don't mean
a whole lot," the righthander said on TUesday.
Even though the righty's second victory of
the season on Tuesday extended the Cardinal's
winning streak to nine games the longest one
for Stanford in 10 years this team realizes
that it can't get caught up in its nonconference
success.
Veterans like McArdle and junior Austin Wil
son would know, having seen Stanford open 2012
with eight straight wins before dropping seven
of nine conference games in late March and early
April. Last year, the long finals break at the end of
winter quarter doomed the streaking Cardinal.
"We had really a lot of momentum going into fi
nals week, but it cut off because we had 10 days off
and we didn't play anyone," Wilson admitted be
fore this season. "So we kind of came out slow, and
since then, we didn't really get to pick it up. So
hopefully this year, we can kind of change our
mentality and stay fresh over finals break."
It remains to be seen whether Stanford will
stay hot all the way up to its March 22 conference

opener, but the fact that the Cardinal has fared so
well without the injured Wilson, the team's top
slugger and a likely first-round MLB Draft pick
this June, is encouraging in and of itself.
It's no coincidence that a nine-game hitting
streak by one of Wilson's classmates, first base
man Brian Ragira, has lined up exactly with the
team's perfect stretch. Fellow junior Danny
Diekroeger is riding a six-game hitting streak of
his own, and though Stanford hasn't put up many
crooked numbers the team has yet to score
eight runs in a game, which it did in six of its first
10 contests of 2012 its timely hitting has been
just enough. Stanford hasn't lost when hitting a
home run.
"I don't know if we're doing any one thing ex
traordinarily well," McArdle said, "but it kind of
just has come down to: we score three runs if we
give up two."
And on the mound, the Cardinal has performed
better than head coach Mark Marquess could have
asked at the start of the season after junior A. J.
Vanegas went down with a back injury. Even with
out its projected Saturday starter, the Cardinal
has compiled Division I's sixth-best team ERA
(1.74) and its ninth-best WHIP (0.98) through
March 3.
In back-to-back Friday night complete games,
senior ace Mark Appel (2-1) has made perhaps the
two best starts of his career, allowing just five
Fresno State runners to reach base (one on an er
ror) on Feb. 22 before striking out 14 Texas batters
and holding the Longhorns hitless through 5.2 in
nings on March 1.
Sophomore John Hochstatter has yet to dis
play any of the durability issues that he struggled

with last year, turning in three solid starts despite
earning a trio of no decisions so far in three Cardi
nal victories.
And freshman Bobby Zarubin (1-0), who began
the year thinking he would play in the infield,
pitched eight two-hit innings in his first career
start last Sunday.
There has even been some consistency in the
bullpen, a real sore spot for the Cardinal down the
stretch last season. In their 28.2 combined innings,
primary relievers Sam Lindquist (three saves),
David Schmidt (2-0) and Daniel Starwalt (2-0)
have allowed just five earned runs; in fact, fresh
man Logan James is the only Stanford hurler with
an ERA above 2.75.
"I think, over the past two weeks, we've pitched
well, we've played defense, we've gotten some
timely hits," McArdle said. "Our weekend starters
have been great, so it's kind of been a combination
of all the facets of this team coming together to
win."
Much of the same can be said for the Rebels,
who take a six-game winning streak of their own
into the weekend.
UNLV has six regular starters hitting above
.300, led by a pair of seniors, centerfielder Mark
Shannon (.382) and rightfielder Brandon Bayardi
(.377). Freshman first baseman Justin Jones (.375)
has driven in a team-high 12 runs.
Though the Rebels have yet to hit a home ran
this season, their 26 doubles were 18th-best in the
country through March 3, paced by Shannon with
five two-baggers. UNLV added five more doubles,
with Shannon adding his team-high sixth, in Mon
day's 14-1 rout of Hawaii.
UNLV has two weapons of its own on the hill,
junior Buddy Borden (1-1) and sophomore Erick
Fedde (2-0). Borden has yet to give up an earned
run in 21.2 innings of work, while Fedde has struck
out a team-high 21 batters in three starts while
scattering just three extra-base hits. UNLV's staff
has been victimized by its defense at times; the
Rebels have given up 19 unearned runs on the
young season.
Tonight's series opener at Sunken Diamond is
slated for 5:30 p.m., with 1 p.m. games on Saturday
and Sunday.

A nine-game winning streak is great, sure. But
as No. 10 Stanford prepares to host unranked UN
LV (10-3) at Sunken Diamond this weekend, the
Cardinal (10-2) isn't getting ahead of itself. Well, at
least senior Dean McArdle isn't.
"Nine wins in February and March don't mean
a whole lot," the righthander said on TUesday.
Even though the righty's second victory of
the season on Tuesday extended the Cardinal's
winning streak to nine games the longest one
for Stanford in 10 years this team realizes
that it can't get caught up in its nonconference
success.
Veterans like McArdle and junior Austin Wil
son would know, having seen Stanford open 2012
with eight straight wins before dropping seven
of nine conference games in late March and early
April. Last year, the long finals break at the end of
winter quarter doomed the streaking Cardinal.
"We had really a lot of momentum going into fi
nals week, but it cut off because we had 10 days off
and we didn't play anyone," Wilson admitted be
fore this season. "So we kind of came out slow, and
since then, we didn't really get to pick it up. So
hopefully this year, we can kind of change our
mentality and stay fresh over finals break."
It remains to be seen whether Stanford will
stay hot all the way up to its March 22 conference

opener, but the fact that the Cardinal has fared so
well without the injured Wilson, the team's top
slugger and a likely first-round MLB Draft pick
this June, is encouraging in and of itself.
It's no coincidence that a nine-game hitting
streak by one of Wilson's classmates, first base
man Brian Ragira, has lined up exactly with the
team's perfect stretch. Fellow junior Danny
Diekroeger is riding a six-game hitting streak of
his own, and though Stanford hasn't put up many
crooked numbers the team has yet to score
eight runs in a game, which it did in six of its first
10 contests of 2012 its timely hitting has been
just enough. Stanford hasn't lost when hitting a
home run.
"I don't know if we're doing any one thing ex
traordinarily well," McArdle said, "but it kind of
just has come down to: we score three runs if we
give up two."
And on the mound, the Cardinal has performed
better than head coach Mark Marquess could have
asked at the start of the season after junior A. J.
Vanegas went down with a back injury. Even with
out its projected Saturday starter, the Cardinal
has compiled Division I's sixth-best team ERA
(1.74) and its ninth-best WHIP (0.98) through
March 3.
In back-to-back Friday night complete games,
senior ace Mark Appel (2-1) has made perhaps the
two best starts of his career, allowing just five
Fresno State runners to reach base (one on an er
ror) on Feb. 22 before striking out 14 Texas batters
and holding the Longhorns hitless through 5.2 in
nings on March 1.
Sophomore John Hochstatter has yet to dis
play any of the durability issues that he struggled

with last year, turning in three solid starts despite
earning a trio of no decisions so far in three Cardi
nal victories.
And freshman Bobby Zarubin (1-0), who began
the year thinking he would play in the infield,
pitched eight two-hit innings in his first career
start last Sunday.
There has even been some consistency in the
bullpen, a real sore spot for the Cardinal down the
stretch last season. In their 28.2 combined innings,
primary relievers Sam Lindquist (three saves),
David Schmidt (2-0) and Daniel Starwalt (2-0)
have allowed just five earned runs; in fact, fresh
man Logan James is the only Stanford hurler with
an ERA above 2.75.
"I think, over the past two weeks, we've pitched
well, we've played defense, we've gotten some
timely hits," McArdle said. "Our weekend starters
have been great, so it's kind of been a combination
of all the facets of this team coming together to
win."
Much of the same can be said for the Rebels,
who take a six-game winning streak of their own
into the weekend.
UNLV has six regular starters hitting above
.300, led by a pair of seniors, centerfielder Mark
Shannon (.382) and rightfielder Brandon Bayardi
(.377). Freshman first baseman Justin Jones (.375)
has driven in a team-high 12 runs.
Though the Rebels have yet to hit a home ran
this season, their 26 doubles were 18th-best in the
country through March 3, paced by Shannon with
five two-baggers. UNLV added five more doubles,
with Shannon adding his team-high sixth, in Mon
day's 14-1 rout of Hawaii.
UNLV has two weapons of its own on the hill,
junior Buddy Borden (1-1) and sophomore Erick
Fedde (2-0). Borden has yet to give up an earned
run in 21.2 innings of work, while Fedde has struck
out a team-high 21 batters in three starts while
scattering just three extra-base hits. UNLV's staff
has been victimized by its defense at times; the
Rebels have given up 19 unearned runs on the
young season.
Tonight's series opener at Sunken Diamond is
slated for 5:30 p.m., with 1 p.m. games on Saturday
and Sunday.
