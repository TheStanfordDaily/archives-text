No. 4 Stanford women's basketball starts Pac-12
tournament play tonight against Washington State sit
ting in the top seed position, having just won the regular
season Pac-12 title for the 13th consecutive season.
"If someone had said at the beginning of the year
that, March 5, we would be 28-2, I would be like, 'How
can that happen when you're playing at Tennessee and
South Carolina, Baylor, Connecticut?'" said Stanford
head coach and Pac-12 Coach of the Year Tara Van-
Derveer. 'And we knew how good the Pac-12 would be
this year."
"I won't say it's all coaching for sure. We have Chiney
[Ogwumike]. Chiney is huge. She's a game changer. Who
knew that she would be able to do what she's been capa
ble of doing this year? We are a whole different team
when she is on the floor than when she is not."
Stanford (28-2, 17-1 Pac-12) finished out another
strong regular season with wins against Baylor, Ten
nessee and South Carolina all on the road. Its only
losses of the season came from then-No. 2 Connecticut
and then-No. 7 Cal, both at Maples Pavilion.
Individually, the Card was well represented on the
AU-Pac-12 Team, with Ogwumike sweeping both Player
of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year and senior
forward Joslyn Tinkle and sophomore point guard Am
ber Orrange being named to the AU-Pac-12 Team.
"We've always had a target on our back in the Pac-12,
so after that Cal loss, it was the same thing [as after the
UConn loss]," Ogwumike said. "We're a good team
we're trying to be a great team but that loss put it in
perspective like, any ne can beat you on any given
night if they play hard. So I think that our number one
thing is just playing hard, and when we play 40 minutes
hard, that will help us separate."
The Card will most likely have a chance to break the
1-1 tie with No. 5 Cal (27-2, 16-1) as the Card and the
Bears are pegged to go head to head in the tournament
championship on Sunday. If the Card wins it will be its
seventh consecutive tournament title.
However, VanDerveer claims that it's "jumping the
gun to put [Stanford] or Cal into the final game," since
the league this year is so compressed talent wise. There
is not a huge gap this year between the leaders of the
pack and the bottom, with Colorado and UCLA both
ranked in the top 25 along with Cal and Stanford.
A competitive Pac-12 is something VanDerveer has
wanted for a long time it brings more recognition to
the league and more respectability to Stanford's confer
ence wins.
"We have a lot of big fish to fry this weekend," Tinkle
said. "We hope to face Cal again. Our league has some
great teams this year, and it's not going to be easy. It's
important because in order to get that number one seed
going into the [NCAA] tournament, we have to play well
this weekend."
Winning the Pac-12 and having to share the title with
Cal is not sufficient enough for the Card, who is deter
mined to bring home the program's first NCAA title
since 1992.
Winning the Pac-12 Tournament would secure a No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament for either Stanford or
Cal. That adds extra importance to the Pac-12 Tourna
ment, which is usually viewed as grooming and extra
practice games for the real challenge that comes later

this month.
In order for the Card to get the No. 1 seed for the Big
Dance, it most likely has to make it through this weekend
undefeated, with three games in three days a tough
feat for even this accomplished Stanford team. The Car
dinal did play in a similar situation in Hawaii at the Jack
in the Box Classic where it knocked off Baylor, Hawaii
and Tennessee-Martin in a three-day stretch.
The Cardinal will have to win this weekend in spite of
the continued absence of junior guard Toni Kokenis, who
has missed the past eight games due to an undisclosed ill
ness. Having Kokenis off the court is certainly not ideal
last year, she started in the Final Four and was relied
upon defensively in the beginning of the year to shut
down the opponent's offensive threat but it has
opened up opportunities for other players.
And other players will have to step up and contribute
lest it becomes the Chiney show again this weekend. Jun
ior guard Sara James has stepped up the offensive inten
sity in the latter part of the season to earn Kokenis's
starting spot. Redshirt junior forward Mikaela Ruef has
worked to develop every part of her game. And sopho
more guards Bonnie Samuelson and Taylor Greenfield
have provided huge sparks from behind the 3-point line
throughout the season. It will take a combined effort
from all players to get the W's.
"I think Sara James, Mikaela Ruef, especially [have
been helpful]," VanDerveer said. "Bonnie had her career
high this year; Taylor Greenfield had awesome games
against Baylor and Gonzaga. We just need to take every
one's best game, and we need almost that every game...
We know what they're capable of, and we can't have peo
ple sand-bagging. They are great players, they are work
ing hard, and I think this team is a very cohesive team.
That's something that's really important down the
stretch."
