## Card looks to upend Sooners 
### CONNOR SCHERER STAFF WRITER 
For years, Stanford women's
gymnastics has stressed the im
portance of improvement through
out a season. The Cardinal will
have to continue improving as it
heads to Norman, Okla., to face the
North Carolina Tar Heels and the
second-ranked Oklahoma Soon
ers on Sunday morning.
While it is always nice to start
the year strong, it is more signif
icant to steadily develop as the
season progresses. The Cardinal
(10-3, 5-1 Pac-12) rode this strat
egy all the way to fourth place in
the NCAA Championship last
year, and this season has seen
more of the same.
"We began the year with the
goal of consistently getting bet
ter every weekend so we could
peak at the right time," said sen
ior captain Ashley Morgan. "As a
senior, I am extremely proud of
how far our team has come, and I
know we are only going to contin

ue to improve and show our true
strength as we conclude our regular
season and post season begins."
Stanford got out to a very strong
7-1 start through Jan. 26 but still
had not scored above 197 points in a
meet until it defeated Arizona State
197.275-195.250 on Feb. 15. Since
that point, the Card has eclipsed the
197-point mark in both subsequent
meets en route to a 10-3 record and
the nation's No. 9 ranking.
The Card's biggest challenge
this Sunday will be keeping up with
the Sooners a feat no team has
been able to do yet this season.
Oklahoma has dominated its compe
tition, leading to a 16-0 record and
multiple weeks atop the national
rankings.
Oklahoma is led by senior Brie
Olson, who was recently recognized
as one of the six finalists for the
most outstanding senior gymnast in
the country. Oklahoma averages

197.317 points per meet with a sea
son-high 198.375-point performance
in a victory over sixth-ranked
UCLA.
But perhaps just as impressive
as Oklahoma's season-high score is
its scoring consistency. The Sooners
haven't scored below that magic
197-point mark since Jan. 12 at Ari
zona State. In fact, Stanford's sea
son-high 197.275 performance
would only have tied Oklahoma's
worst performance over the last
seven meets.
Factoring in the atmosphere of
an always-loud Oklahoma gym, top
ping the Sooners is going to be a
tough task.
"It is going to be a great environ
ment with a lot of fans, and a loud
home crowd," Morgan said. "We get
excited for challenges on the road,

but our biggest challenge is truly
just competing against ourselves.
Our goal is to improve from last
weekend and to continue to get even
better."
Morgan has been one of Stan
ford's most consistent performers
of the season, winning four individ
ual all-around titles and earning
herself a Pac-12 Gymnast of the
Week award in late January. How
ever, the team will need much more
than just Morgan, looking to fellow
senior Nicole Dayton, who has been
one of the strongest performers on
vault throughout the season, and a
strong core of young players as the
team tries to pull of a big upset vic
tory.
