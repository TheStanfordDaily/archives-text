# Falling for head coach David Shaw
## 
### Sam Fisher 
I have had a very funny feeling
stalling to take over the last few
months. It's grown stronger and
stronger, but I couldn't quite
place it.
I finally figured it out this TUesday
evening at Dan Elliott Practice Fields.
I really like David Shaw.
So often, as a columnist, we only
write about coaches when they fail. The
most common columns about coaches
seem to be ones calling for then- firing.
To be fair, it is completely in bounds
for a columnist to criticize coaching.
But won't those criticisms mean more
when columnists also give out praise?
That's what I'm here for today
Besides the occasional conservative
play-calling binge see Bowl, Rose,
quarters two and three I can't really
think of a atticism of Shaw
He's had his tough moments —the
aftermath of September's game at
Washington probably being the tough
est —but what I love about Shaw is
that he gets better every week. He's
just starting his third year as a head
coach and already turning into a true
pro.
As much as I love accounting for
my own personal beliefs and feelings, I
can acknowledge that a head coach's
most important relationship is with his
players. Fkom everything I've ever
heard on the practice field and in the
dorm rooms or dining halls, Shaw gets
top marks.
Well, maybe Shaw's lucky to be
able to follow Jim Harbaugh in that de
partment.
But where Shaw sets himself apart,
in my opinion, is with his relationship
with the media. He delivers the perfect
combination of serious updates and
lighthearted quips or stories.
During the weekly luncheon head
ing into Stanford's date against Ore
gon, when Shaw entered the room, one
of the writers asked the simple and po
lite question, "How are you feeling?"
His response:
'After the last 48 hours of watching
Oregon film," Shaw said, "how would
you feel?"
I love it.

And then there are the great stories
he told, unprompted, during Big Game
Week and the week of the Colorado
Game.
Shaw told the story of the Big
Game in 1990, one of the craziest
episodes of the always-crazy Stanford-
Cal rivalry, from his point of view as a
redshirt. After the two-point conver
sion failed and Cal rushed the field
prematurely classic Cal move
the security staff took away the prac
tice net for Stanford kicker John Hop
kins'9o.
So what did Hopkins do? He
looked at Shaw, shrugged, put a ball on
the tee and booted it into the bleach
ers. A few minutes later, Hopkins
kicked the game-winning field goal to
give Stanford an improbable 27-25 vic
tory.
Then there was the Colorado story.
It was Shaw's first game traveling
with Stanford, yet he ended up in the
front of the tunnel to lead the Cardinal
onto the field. But right before they
headed out, Colorado performed its
Run Ralphie Rim ritual, right at Shaw
and the Stanford team.
Shaw described himself as pushing
backwards trying to get back in the
locker room, but unable to move be
cause of his teammates behind him.
You have to love the self-deprecating
humor. Oh, and he made sure to talk
about the questionable calls that gave
Colorado a 21-17 win.
You'd be amazed how monotonous
and repetitive the cycle of covering a
team can feel. But Shaw gives those
weekly luncheons a very different feel.
He's not guarded like Bill Be
lichick, he's not constantly adversarial
like Lane Kiffin and he's not fake like
Andy Reid. Honestly, fake might be the
worst of the three.
And Shaw is certainly not fake.
Rightly or wrongly, Shaw is not the
best at hiding his opinions, whether
he's in a good mood or bad.
You could feel Shaw's disappoint
ment after that Washington loss. At
times, his emotions made it uncomfort
able. But what else could we ask for?
I think the biggest sign of Shaw's
maturation as a coach came out of that
awkwardness of the press conference
right after the Washington loss.
In that press conference, Shaw
snapped at a Stanford beat reporter for
one of his questions; the tension be
tween the two had reached a boiling
point.
The next week, that reporter was
n't at the Riesday press conference. I
sat in the room and wondered if we

were headed toward a Steve Spurrier
vs. Ron Morris moment.
But unlike The Head Ball Coach,
Shaw took the high road and did so in
a funny way.
At a later press luncheon, Shaw
called upon the beat writer to help
him demonstrate the current fifth
year senior Chase Thomas's signa
ture "ice-pick spin move." Shaw
spun around in his chair, swung his
arm around a lot slower than
game speed and showed us all
how Thomas works his magic.
Now that's how you eliminate
unnecessary conflict.

Sam Fisher looked forward to hear
ing David Shaw speak almost a-s
much as he looked forward to de
vouring all the food at the weekly
luncheons this past season. Let him
know what you think of Shaw at
