# Packed tennis weekend begins
## Women host three, start conference play 
### CHRISSY JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team pre
pares for an uncharacteristic three-day
stretch of matches this weekend as it hosts
No. 31 Washington, No. 73 Washington State
and No. 38 Texas. The No. 20 Cardinal's (5-2,
0-0 Pac-12) battles against Washington and
Washington State will mark its first two con
ference matchups of the season.
Stanford's most recent 6-1 victory over
then-No. 9 Cal put it back on a winning
streak after suffering a key loss to then-No. 2
Florida two weekends ago.
"We were definitely very pleased with the
result," said freshman Lindsey Kostas, "and
I think the win will give us more confidence
and momentum going into this weekend."
That momentum will be crucial as Stan
ford tries to dispatch three teams in a row.
The first match will feature Washington, the
highest ranked of Stanford's three oppo
nents, on Friday, followed by Washington
State on Saturday and Texas on Sunday
morning to round out the marathon.
The Cardinal hasn't played Texas since
2010 but easily moved past its conference
foes from up north last year, capturing a 6-1

victory over Washington and shutting out
Washington State 7-0. The players are still
focused entering the weekend.
"We have been practicing with more ener
gy and more focus," said Kostas. "The coach
es give us a game plan, tell us specific drills
that we will be doing, and then we go out and
try to execute the plan."
These more systematized practices repre
sent a change in structure that was imple
mented after the Florida match and has pro
pelled the team forward since. The team
hopes to translate its high level of intensity in
practice to this weekend's matches.
"I think we all have learned that every
team comes to play and that we cannot take
any player or team lightly," Kostas said.
Junior captains Nicole Gibbs and Kristie
Ahn and senior captain Natalie Dillon will
lead Stanford this weekend. Nationally
ranked No. 14 freshman Krista Hardebeck
will be holding down court two as she at
tempts to improve her dual match record to
4-4. Senior Stacey Tan, the only member of
the team to participate in the 2010 match
against Texas, will manage court four.
Kostas, who anchors the back of the line
up for the Cardinal as one of the two fresh
men on the team, will be concentrating on her
mental game.
"It can get very frustrating at times when
you are not playing well, but no matter how
difficult it may seem to stay tough, it is some
thing that has to be done," Kostas said. "It's
the only way that you will be able to pull out
the win, and it helps your teammates play
better if they see that you are not giving in."
For sophomore Ellen Tsay, who manned
court five against Cal, it's about speed.
"I want to continue to improve my foot
work on all fronts," Tsay said, "especially so
that I can move forward faster to the net."
Tsay hopes that increasing her speed and
fitness will help her stay in the match physi
cally.
"Our team tends to be known for taking
the first opportunity to attack," Tsay said,
"but this year we also want to be known as
the team who will grind it out to the last point
and do whatever it takes."
The Cardinal takes to the Taube Family
Tennis Courts Friday against Washington at
1:30 p.m. The matches continue as the team
battles Washington State Saturday at noon
and closes out the weekend against Texas on
Sunday at 10 a.m.
