### OLIVIA MOORE DESK EDITOR 
The No. 49 Stanford men's tennis team
clinched a decisive 7-0 victory at home against
unranked Fhrman on Thursday, ending a four
match losing streak and bringing their season
record to 4-5.
"This is a match we should win every time,
but it's also a match we needed to win," sopho
more Robert Stineman said. "We feel really
good about getting back on the right track, and
hopefully this could be the start of a good run."
The match marked the Cardinal's first victo
ry since it faced BYU on Feb. 1. The Cardinal
fell to TCU, UCLA, USC and Cal in its last four
dual matches but performed well last weekend
at the Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament,
where two of the Cardinal's five teams made it
to the semi-finals.
According to freshman Nolan Paige, the
team's success at the doubles tournament "ab
solutely" contributed to their strong perform
ance against Rirman yesterday.
"We're such a young team, and I think we're
just really coming into our own and getting bet
ter with eveiy single day and gaining confi
dence," Paige said. "We're really going to be a
team to look out for in the future."
Although doubles matches are typically
played first, the singles matches were priori
tized due to worries that the match would be
rained out. However, the players were able to
finish all of the matches uninterrupted.
Sophomore Robert Stineman, who played
No. 4 singles, was the first to finish, dropping
only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Fbr
man's Jacob Behal.
"I thought I was hitting the ball very clean
and was able to work on a lot of the stuff I had
been practicing these past couple weeks,"
Stineman said.
Freshman Maciek Romanowicz was the
next to finish, clinching a 6-2, 6-2 victory over
Joel Cook at No. 3 singles.
Paige, who played second singles, defeated
Furman's Alex Christ 6-4, 6-4 to put Stanford
within one victory of the match.
"I served really well, and I was able to make
a lot of balls and keep it going and gut out a
good victory," Paige said. "[Christ] was serving
really big."
Sophomore John Morrissey, Stanford's No.
1 singles player, beat Rirman's Andrew Mellon

6-2,6-1 to take the match. Morrissey's dominat
ing performance was followed by victories at
No. 5 and No. 6 singles by junior Daniel Ho and
freshman Trey Strobel, respectively.
The Cardinal also swept the doubles match
es with wins from senior Denis Lin and Morris
sey at No. 1 doubles, Paige and Strobel at No. 2
doubles and junior Jamin Ball and freshman
Anthony Tsodikov at No. 3 doubles.
The Fiirman match was the first of a series
of six consecutive home matches, and Paige said
the team is looking forward to the upcoming
matches at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
"There's no tennis stadium like ours," Paige
said. "Every time we get to play in our stadium,
it's amazing."
The Cardinal looks to pick up another win
against Boise State at home on Sunday. Boise
State, which is 5-7 on the season, is currently
unranked and has lost four of its five away
matches this season.
"We're going to try to have the same mind
set that we had today, just be very focused and
have the right attitude when we step out on the
court," Stineman said. "Hopefully we can do the
same thing on Sunday against Boise State.
They're a very good team, and it should be a
good one."
Paige was also optimistic about the team's
future performance and said that although the
team is relatively young, they are improving
with every match.
"We're working hard every single day.
That's one thing the coaches say all the time,
how hard we work and how dedicated we are,"
Paige said. "Good stuff is going to come."
