## BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE CREATOR OF Stanford Confessions CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? 
### Roxanna Reaves | STAFF WRITER 
As of March 5, the Facebook page
"Stanford Confessions" had 2,060
likes and nearly 1,000 confessions. The
page, which takes anonymous submissions
from anyone with a SUNet ID, has become a
forum for both deep personal disclosures and
clever witticisms. No topic is unexplored, as
opinions and views on a variety of taboo sub
jects such as sex, race, love, mental health, jeal
ousy and economic status have all been dis
cussed on numerous occasions on the page.
Still, one thing that remains unrevealed is
the identity of the creator of Stanford
Confessions, who for the past month has been
managing posts from these previously unheard
voices of Stanford. Intermission connected with
the student that started it all to find out what he
or she has to say about how the page has evolved
Intermission (INT): Overall, how has your
time here been?
Stanford Confessions (SC): I definitely
struggled my freshmen year. It was a difficult
transition. But things definitely got a lot
better when I started my sophomore year.
Since then, I've found a great support [to be]
necessary.

INT : Have you ever felt like you couldn't
express yourself here?
SC: I think that the duck syndrome is definitely
a reality. When everyone seems so happy on the
surface, it's hard to express your feelings or ask
for help.
INT: Why did you create Stanford Confessions?
SC: I think that Stanford could have a much
stronger community. There is culture of silence
that greatly hinders our daily interactions. It was
also a great way to address the duck syndrome
and foster support from peers.
INT: How did you come up with the idea?
SC: I saw that confession pages were becoming
popular at many different colleges. Although dif
ferent colleges have their own unique experi
ences, Stanford's duck syndrome culture called
for a confessions page.
INT: How do you manage your submissions?
SC: I am not tech-sawy. At all. So initially I
created a Survey Monkey form. However, peo
ple [much more tech-sawy than me] were
able to spam the form, so I ended up with
tens of thousands of spam confessions.

Someone messaged me and suggested that I
make a Google doc, so I did. I also noticed
that people who weren't Stanford students
were sending in confessions. I made it so you
have to be signed into your Stanford email to
send a confession, but that's it. When you
make a submission, I can only see your con
fession and the time/date it was submitted. I
can't see any email addresses, names or SUNet
IDs.
INT: What kinds of posts were you hoping for?
SC: Ultimately, I just wanted honest posts. I
wanted real confessions from Stanford students.
Since the system is anonymous, I wanted people
to feel that they could be honest without being
embarrassed or judged.
INT: How do you feel about the "trolls," or
joke-posters? Do you enjoy their submissions or
find them counterproductive to your cause?
SC: So, I try my best to make sure that people
can be heard. The page is also called "Stanford
Confessions," and I don't feel that it's my role to
judge what is worthy of being a real or good
"Stanford Confession." I want it to be an open
forum of all kinds of confessions confessions
about loving Stanford or not liking Stanford
because it's a page that represents the student
body. I don't feel that it's my job to tailor it to a
specific audience or manipulate it in any
way. Stanford students shape the page, and I just
post the confessions.
INT: How do you feel about the comments
people post?
SC: Again, I just think of myself as someone
who transfers posts from a Google doc to a pub
lic page. I can't control what people write, and
that's something that comes with open forums.

INT: Have you ever posted your own confes
sion?
SC: Stanford Confessions is an anonymous
page, and I do not feel that anyone should be
outed.
INT: What are the biggest challenges you have
faced as the Stanford Confessions
administrator?
SC: It's difficult to balance the freedom of
speech issue. Some confessions may be offensive
or hurtful to other students, but then, if I don't
post the confession, the individual that submit
ted the confession may get upset that he or she
was screened. It's difficult to establish the fine
line between freedom of speech and appropri
ateness.
INT: You have over 800 submissions already.
Are the confessions pouring in just as fast as
they did in the beginning?
SC: They've been coming in at a pretty consis
tent level, even now.
INT: It's been about a month since you created
the page. How did your expectations of how the
page would grow match the realities of it?
SC: I would love for the page to continue. I would
also love to see someone take it a step further and
maybe create a group or put on an event.
INT: How much longer do you see this page
going for?
SC: I think the issues will be relevant for a
while. But ultimately, it will continue as long
as Stanford students keep it alive.
INT: Lastly, what's up with the cover photo of
Aria? Are you a big Pretty Little Liars fan?
SC: Haha, yes!

likes and nearly 1,000 confessions. The
page, which takes anonymous submissions
from anyone with a SUNet ID, has become a
forum for both deep personal disclosures and
clever witticisms. No topic is unexplored, as
opinions and views on a variety of taboo sub
jects such as sex, race, love, mental health, jeal
ousy and economic status have all been dis
cussed on numerous occasions on the page.
Still, one thing that remains unrevealed is
the identity of the creator of Stanford
Confessions, who for the past month has been
managing posts from these previously unheard
voices of Stanford. Intermission connected with
the student that started it all to find out what he
or she has to say about how the page has evolved
Intermission (INT): Overall, how has your
time here been?
Stanford Confessions (SC): I definitely
struggled my freshmen year. It was a difficult
transition. But things definitely got a lot
better when I started my sophomore year.
Since then, I've found a great support [to be]
necessary.

INT : Have you ever felt like you couldn't
express yourself here?
SC: I think that the duck syndrome is definitely
a reality. When everyone seems so happy on the
surface, it's hard to express your feelings or ask
for help.
INT: Why did you create Stanford Confessions?
SC: I think that Stanford could have a much
stronger community. There is culture of silence
that greatly hinders our daily interactions. It was
also a great way to address the duck syndrome
and foster support from peers.
INT: How did you come up with the idea?
SC: I saw that confession pages were becoming
popular at many different colleges. Although dif
ferent colleges have their own unique experi
ences, Stanford's duck syndrome culture called
for a confessions page.
INT: How do you manage your submissions?
SC: I am not tech-sawy. At all. So initially I
created a Survey Monkey form. However, peo
ple [much more tech-sawy than me] were
able to spam the form, so I ended up with
tens of thousands of spam confessions.

Someone messaged me and suggested that I
make a Google doc, so I did. I also noticed
that people who weren't Stanford students
were sending in confessions. I made it so you
have to be signed into your Stanford email to
send a confession, but that's it. When you
make a submission, I can only see your con
fession and the time/date it was submitted. I
can't see any email addresses, names or SUNet
IDs.
INT: What kinds of posts were you hoping for?
SC: Ultimately, I just wanted honest posts. I
wanted real confessions from Stanford students.
Since the system is anonymous, I wanted people
to feel that they could be honest without being
embarrassed or judged.
INT: How do you feel about the "trolls," or
joke-posters? Do you enjoy their submissions or
find them counterproductive to your cause?
SC: So, I try my best to make sure that people
can be heard. The page is also called "Stanford
Confessions," and I don't feel that it's my role to
judge what is worthy of being a real or good
"Stanford Confession." I want it to be an open
forum of all kinds of confessions confessions
about loving Stanford or not liking Stanford
because it's a page that represents the student
body. I don't feel that it's my job to tailor it to a
specific audience or manipulate it in any
way. Stanford students shape the page, and I just
post the confessions.
INT: How do you feel about the comments
people post?
SC: Again, I just think of myself as someone
who transfers posts from a Google doc to a pub
lic page. I can't control what people write, and
that's something that comes with open forums.

INT: Have you ever posted your own confes
sion?
SC: Stanford Confessions is an anonymous
page, and I do not feel that anyone should be
outed.
INT: What are the biggest challenges you have
faced as the Stanford Confessions
administrator?
SC: It's difficult to balance the freedom of
speech issue. Some confessions may be offensive
or hurtful to other students, but then, if I don't
post the confession, the individual that submit
ted the confession may get upset that he or she
was screened. It's difficult to establish the fine
line between freedom of speech and appropri
ateness.
INT: You have over 800 submissions already.
Are the confessions pouring in just as fast as
they did in the beginning?
SC: They've been coming in at a pretty consis
tent level, even now.
INT: It's been about a month since you created
the page. How did your expectations of how the
page would grow match the realities of it?
SC: I would love for the page to continue. I would
also love to see someone take it a step further and
maybe create a group or put on an event.
INT: How much longer do you see this page
going for?
SC: I think the issues will be relevant for a
while. But ultimately, it will continue as long
as Stanford students keep it alive.
INT: Lastly, what's up with the cover photo of
Aria? Are you a big Pretty Little Liars fan?
SC: Haha, yes!
