# Finance internships lure, challenge students

Designer suits, chartered plane
rides across the globe and million-dol
lar deals clinched on an daily basis
the finance sector enjoys no dearth of
glamour in popular culture.
However, for many students at
Stanford trying to make an entrance
into the field, the reality isn't quite as
shiny.
Lan Chan 'l4, an international re
lations and economics double major,
first became interested in finance af
ter joining Stanford's business frater
nity, Alpha Kappa Psi, during his
freshman year. He decided to apply
for a finance internship for the sum
mer following his sophomore year.
"It's a chance game," he reflected.
"A recruiter going through 500 re
sumes for five spots in first round
it's a little bit of a black box, so people
apply to many [companies] to maxi

mize their chances."
According to statistics provided
by the Cardinal Recruiting service
for fall and winter quarters during
the 2012-13 school year, 25 finance
companies interviewed for intern
ships on campus, compared to 80 en
gineering and technology companies
and eight non-tech companies.
These numbers, however, include
neither the interviews resulting from
career fail's hosted by the Career De
velopment Center (CDC) nor those
resulting from the job offers adminis
tered through Cardinal Careers.
Beverley Principal, a student af
fairs director at the CDC, noted that
interest in finance internships tends
to vary with the state of the economy.
According to Principal, the number of
applications currently seems to be on
the rise, as the economy slowly recov
ers from the Great Recession.
According to the CDC, the top fi
nance companies in terms of student

interest are Goldman Sachs and J.P
Morgan, with favorite locations in
cluding San Francisco, where the
work tends to focus more on technol
ogy and healthcare, and New York
City, where students sample the fast
paced corporate world.
Arduous applications
Chan compared the application
process for such internships to that of
applying for a spot at a top university.
"The application isn't long, but it
takes time to get through all the elec
tronic applications, and if you do get
shortlisted it is 45 minutes of your
time that you have to devote to each
interviewer," he said. "The first inter
views are usually 'fit interviews'
questions more about yourself and
why you are interested in the compa
ny."
The internship process usually
begins with an electronic application,
followed by two interview rounds.

The first interview is typically con
ducted on a college's campus or at the
local office of a company, and the sec
ond generally takes place during
what business insiders refer to as the
"Superday." which can involve up to
five interviews in one day at a compa
ny's main offices, generally in New
York City, San Francisco or Los An
geles.
First-round interviews frequently
feature brainteasers and other logic
or math puzzles as means of testing
applicants. Chan was asked to solve a
riddle involving a disarray of black
and white socks in a dark drawer,
while Luana Dias Gomes 'l4, an eco
nomics major interning at J.E Mor
gan this summer, was asked to esti
mate the weight of a Boeing 787
Dreamliner.
"I had no idea how to do it, but I
tried to answer," Dias Gomes said.
'Afterwards, I remember flying to
my Superday [in New York City] and

thinking about going up to the pilot to
ask him how much the airplane actu
ally weighed.
"That haunted me for a while be
cause I couldn't get the right answer,"
she added.
The second-round interview, how
ever, usually focuses on more techni
cal aspects of the trade.
At the time of her Superday, Dias
Gomes had not conducted any prior
mock interviews unusual among
hopefuls and had only been to the
CDC once, for help formatting and
editing her resume.
"I remember that I had two
midterms during the week of my sec
ond-round interview, and it was also
the first time I was interviewing for
an actual job, so obviously that was
very stressful," Dias Gomes recalled.
"I was asked lots of hypothetical sce
narios, [especially about] how you
deal with day-to-day stuff."
An intense experience
Only when applicants have se
cured their internships, however,
does the real work start. According
to J.P Morgan's website, internships
offer a "short, intense, possibly ex
hausting, certainly enjoyable and
completely memorable experience."
Chan described finance intern
ships as being very time-intensive,
with 100-hour working weeks treat
ed as nothing unusual.
"These internships are a reflec
tion of the real thing," Chan said.
"[The companies] are very much
looking for permanent hires after
the summer. Taking in so many in
terns is an investment on their end."
At Stanford, sophomore applica
tions for finance internships, such as
those of Dias Gomes and Francisco
Cortes 'l5, also an economics major,
are a relatively new phenomenon.
Until recently, students typically de
cided to take the plunge only after
junior year.
"Here at Stanford, people usually
start applying their junior year, but
at J.E Morgan you have a lot of high
schoolers as interns," Dias Gomes
said. "They have a program in New

York that basically trains the kids
since they're in high school."
Given that Stanford does not
have a business or finance major, stu
dents largely have to prepare for
these internships on their own.
According to Cortes, his prepara
tion included hours spent poring
over case study guidebooks, reach
ing out to people with previous expe
rience in the industry and constantly
keeping up to date with the news.
"I wake up everyday holding The
Wall Street Journal," Cortes said.
"It's also about reaching out to peo
ple who've been in the position be
fore, finding out what [the interview
ers] will ask you, what they want to
hear from you. I did it both here at
Stanford and with friends and
friends who are already in the work
ing world."
For Chan, essential features of
his preparation process included
learning how financial statements
work, conducting mock interviews
with his fraternity mentors and
reaching out for feedback from first
round interviewers.
Chan commented that, while the
CDC has a number of resources for
job-searching, those tools are regret
tably under-utilized, in part due to
the unwieldy nature of the CDC's
website.

"It's very hard to search for jobs,
it's very cumbersome to load your
resume and cover letter," he said.
"It's just a very cumbersome sys

tem."
Despite these difficulties, Chan
argued that the CDC is ultimately a
beneficial resource for students, par
ticularly due to their facilitation of
recruitment events.
Such events, which are held both
on- and off-campus, include dinners,
case interview workshops, informa
tion sessions and chats over coffee.
Meghan Cress, a recruiting spe
cialist for Bain & Company in the
Bay Area, is her company's primary
recruiter for Stanford. She said that
about 600 Stanford students apply to
Bain each year for both full-time po
sitions and internships.
According to Cress, each Bain of
fice with an internship program will
host anywhere from five to 15 in
terns per year, making for a very
competitive recruiting process.
Cress emphasized that Bain's
emphases on solid academic per
formance, some work or internship
experience, leadership and overall
well-roundedness reward qualities
common to Stanford students.
"Stanford students' resumes are
generally quite impressive," she
said. "In an environment where so
many opportunities are available to
students, it is good to remember that
focusing energy on a few things
rather than trying to do everything
is often more effective."
