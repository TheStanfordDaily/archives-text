## Synesthesia Chocolate Heads explore culture and art at Bing 
### Holly Fetter STAFF WRITER 
Folks from every corner of the Stanford
bubble are gathered in Roble Gym doing
jumping jacks set to synth-heavy trap
tunes. Some students in sweatpants dance across
the space, while others spit poems about station
wagons and blond affos.
This is just a typical Wednesday evening
rehearsal for the Chocolate Heads Movement
Band, Stanford's most outrageous and innova

tive art collective. This deconstructed dance
crew, directed by Aleta Hayes '9l, invites musi
cians, artists, poets, DJs and designers to con
tribute to their creations.
And tonight, everyone is invited to become
a Chocolate Head. At 8 p.m. in the Bing Concert
Hall, the Heads will be joined by renowned jazz
bassist William Parker in their annual perform
ance. Despite the formal location, the crew will
undoubtedly maintain their artistic irreverence,
infusing the recently christened hall with their
signature wild vibe.
The Chocolate Heads defy categorization,
dancing at the intersections of genres, identities
and histories. They transgress boundaries of
musical genres, not afraid to mix a drum kit
with a Japanese koto. Their dance styles are sim
ilarly diverse; the artists weave ballet into vogue
into hip-hop without hesitation. The show is a
powerful interaction of disparate styles, experi
ences and skill levels, resulting in not only an
erasure of differences, but also a celebration of
those differences as the dancers come together to
create this new work.
This interconnectedness is reflected in the
theme of this year's show: synesthesia, or the
dynamic between the world of sensory experi
ence and perception. Different bodies, beings,
genres and styles interact with one another, and

the audience engages with these exchanges.
When watching the Chocolate Heads, we
become aware that these are more than moving
bodies these are real people with their own
stories, experiences and knowledge. The Bing
Concert Hall is well suited for this particular
performance, as the vineyard-style seating allows
for everyone's perspectives to be included and
affirmed.
Within the dance itself, the theme of synes
thesia is embodied. The movements are syn
chronized, harmonious even if they are dis
tinct. At once, three bodies move together in
unison as if part of some sensual machine,
seemingly symbolizing the potential for produc
tion when we collaborate and interact across dif
ference. And that's perhaps what makes the
Chocolate Heads' project so brilliant it's a

student-driven lesson in diversity, one in which
dance moves replace buzzwords and the only
texts are the lived experiences of the fellow
artists.
Tonight's show reminds us that art is cru
cial for progress and change. Throughout the
piece, each dancer generates new modes of
expression and empathy as they move upward,
forward and outward together. As observers and
participants, we leave the space convinced that
the deep connections between beings are best
expressed through music, dance and poetry.
The Chocolate Heads, with special guest
William Parker, will be performing at 8 p.m. at
the Bing Concert Hall. The show is sold out,
but the box office will be giving away
unclaimed tickets beginning at 7:45 p.m.
