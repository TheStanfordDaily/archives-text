# SEXY TIME
## TREE SEX What happens in 
### 
I recently met a man at an airport
bar who told me that he did not
believe in the exchange of money
for "sacred goods." One sacred good,
he said, was sex and our bodies. At
first, I didn't think much of it, as he
was a random man at the very classy
Ruby Tuesday's bar, but he got me
thinking. As a self-proclaimed femi
nist, I have always tried to be a propo
nent of the positive benefits and
female empowerment that can
accompany exotic dancing or prosti
tution.
I personally have enjoyed going
to strip clubs in the past. I even start
ed taking pole-dancing classes a few
years ago. At my classes, the instruc
tors always preached how pole danc
ing was an art that was away to
empower oneself and could be used
as a gift for a deserving partner. A
leisurely hobby, however, is not the
same thing as a job or a lifestyle. I was
able to interview two friends about
their respective experiences in various
adult entertainment fields. One cur
rently works in Vegas at a club called
The Crazy Horse 111, and another
used to dance and get paid for sex in
Las Vegas.
Intermission (INT): What do
you/did you do in Vegas, and how did
you get started?
Riley*: I dance at Crazy Horse 111...

and I have been there for six months.
Before that, I worked at Spearmint
Rhino. I usually work Thursday
through Saturdays, but now I only
work once or twice here and there.
Jane"": I had just lost my job in sales,
and I was struggling financially. One
of my girlfriends called me up one
night telling me she made $BOO in
eight hours. She told me to come
meet her in Vegas, and that is how it
all started. I started dancing at a small
club, and before I knew it, I was work
ing for them doing girl-on-girl shows
for parties. I made about $5OO in one
hour rather than $BOO for eight!
INT: How do you view your work?
Do you enjoy it or just view it as a
way to make money?
Riley: I think the majority of the girls
probably hate what they do and do it
because they are in some type of a
bind. Either they have kids or a drug
addiction. I enjoy parts of it. I like the
control of the job ... It makes me feel
better inside, and that's enjoyable. I like
enough about the job that I haven't left
for seven years.
Jane: The greed takes over, and you
lose yourself in it. Nobody really enjoys
begging men for money... When you
are doing it, it is very demeaning. There
were many guys I did like, but that
made me feel worse. I saw it as a man I
would date, or who would date me,

and now I have no chance. At the end it
was often, "You don't seem like the kind
of girl who would be doing this stuff...
" It was hard on my self-esteem.
INT : What do you do/how do you
cope if you get a really gross or creepy
customer?
Riley: I am a really picky stripper. You
don't have to take what you can get,
and for me, I don't want to spend
hours with the world's most disgusting
guy [just] because of the money. Or, if a
guy is super gross, then I just demand
more money.
Jane: The money is so good and so
easy, so you really numb yourself and
do whatever you have to do to get
through that night.
INT: How did you learn the tricks of
the trade?
Riley: I did learn it on my own. I didn't
know anybody who danced I had
only been to a strip club once before. I
kept it a secret from everybody until I
met another girl that was working
there, and when we became friends, I
felt more comfortable telling other peo
ple what I was doing.
INT: Does your job/did your job
change the way you view sex or intima
cy with your current or former part
ners?
Riley: It does affect your sex and inti

macy with your partners. Every aspect
of dating a guy is completely affected
by the job; that is one of the biggest
downsides. Either you think the guy
just wants you for sex or for the money
or just for your wild job. So, you don't
trust them as much or tell them the
whole truth. Then when you do find a
good guy, it is difficult to stop what you
are doing and reevaluate your life ... I
don't know one girl in the industry that
has a good relationship.
Jane: Prior to doing that job, I was only
with five guys for my whole life. I lived
in a small town and had only been in
long-term relationships. Going to
Vegas, I felt like I was a rag doll it
just tossed me around. I didn't date or
have sex (without being paid) with
anyone while I was there ... I didn't
date for seven or eight years after. It def
initely messed me up.
INT: What is the relationship between
the industry and drug use?
Jane: [Using drugs] is an easier way to
check out and accept whatever you are
doing. It is very hard to do sober,
because it is fighting with so many
voices in your head ... after a while,
you just go numb. Sometimes I felt in
control, and sometimes drunk guys
would beat the shit out of me. That is
when I knew I had to get out of that
job as soon as possible. I think what
empowered me was later on in life,

knowing that I actually survived.
INT: Jane, how did you decide to
leave the industry?
Jane: I was very grateful for a man
who used to be one of my customers
and would fly in from Arizona to see
me. He paid for me to go to L.A., and
he paid for my rent for a year and a
half. He was a godsend, because I
probably would be dead or be stuck
in that whole thing again [if it weren't
for him]. It is definitely a hard thing
to stop if you don't have a level head.
INT: Do you have any advice for
other women who are considering
these types of jobs?
Riley: I wouldn't recommend it for
anybody to start. It's kind of like a
drug. You get caught up when you
do it all the time it really affects your
life and psyche and your opinions of
yourself and others' opinions of you.
Even though it's nice because you can
be independent, make good money
and make your own schedule, you are
constantly being objectified and that
doesn't feel good.
Jane: Most women that are dancing
are also hooking, either with a [client]
or with someone else. [Dancing] leads
to sex [for money], and when you
cross the line, where do you stop?
