Hopefully, by now most of you have

This video isn't especially trendy or rele
vant to any recent fads, but it's absolutely rele
vant to the life of every Stanford student, or at
least those who go to the gym. Enjoy this

of the Universe. But it's also worth remember
ing and celebrating her rise to stardom, espe
cially when it's clad in fabulous '9os clothes.
Check out this early Destiny's Child hit if
you've ever wondered how ridiculous of a look
Beyonce can pull off.
