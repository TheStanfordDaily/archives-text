## THE 						CRUCIBLE STANFORD TAPS PUTS TWIST ON ARTHUR MILLER CLASSIC 
### Gabrielle John | CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You're probably already familiar
with "The Crucible." The
play, written in 1953 by Arthur
Miller, is his most frequently pro
duced work worldwide and a com
monly read text in high school litera
ture classes. Even if you're already
familiar with the play, it's definitely
worth coming out to see the Stanford
Theater & Performance Studies
(TAPS) production, which provides
some interesting fresh takes on the
play. For those unfamiliar with the
story, "The Crucible" is a dramatiza
tion of the 17th-century Salem Witch
Trials; it also serves as an allegory for

the House Un-American Activities
Committee anti-communist investi
gations that were taking place at the
time Miller wrote they play and under
which he was questioned. Although
the connections between the two
events are clear, the story is easy to
understand even without any context.
Put on in conjunction with
Stephen Karam's "Speech and
Debate," which ran earlier this quar
ter, the production features not just
student actors but also student dra
maturges and designers. Together
with the TAPS faculty and Bay Area
professionals, they create a winning

show. The production does an excel
lent job of drawing the audience into
the story and creating tension.
The cast is excellent all around,
with particularly standout perform
ances from David Raymond 'l4 and
Safiya Nygaard 'l4, who portray the
lead characters John Proctor and
Abigail Williams, the primary accuser.
Also noteworthy are Anneka Kumli
'l3 as Elizabeth Proctor and Jessica
Waldman 'l5 as Mary Warren, anoth
er of the accusing girls. The time and
research that the actors put into their
characters is evident, and the realistic
portrayals go a long way toward
drawing the audience into the scene.
At times, the audience became so
frustrated by the characters' actions

that they actually audibly groaned.
The performances are accentuat
ed by the well-done production
design. The show uses various hymns
and songs between acts. Singing was
also featured at the opening and close
of the show. The use of music is very
well thought out, and the carefully
chosen hymns add greatly to the pro
duction. The movement and music
used in the opening of the play, one of
the highlights of the show, is extreme
ly well executed and effectively sets the
scene for the rest of the show. The set,
a cabin-like room with two stories, is
cleverly used to stand for multiple
locations, indoors and outdoors.
Of course, the show has some
flaws. Sometimes, especially during

the court scenes, the performances
can get a bit dramatic, and the dia
logue can carry the actors away. Some
of the smaller touches added, such as
having Abigail moving on and off
stage during the first act, felt out of
place and of questionable significance.
At times, the blocking of the actors
felt overly choreographed and false.
However, most of these flaws were
very minor and didn't detract much
from the overall high quality of the
production.

If you haven't seen it yet, "The
Crucible" will be playing on March 8
and 9 at 8 p.m. in Pigott Theater.
