For students enrolled in the win
ter quarter course GES 7B: An In
troduction to Wilderness Skills,
picking up cold weather survival
skills dressing in multiple layers
to keep warm, preparing food out
doors by lighting coals and building
shelters with snow barriers encir
cling them —is both a practical
and academic imperative.
"In the wilderness, everyone is
cold and miserable there are not
many resources," said Jeff Chen
'l3, one such student. "It's harder
to delegate tasks, decide on who
does what and to manage relation
ships in this setting. But we learned
how to depend on each other."
Each quarter the Outdoor Edu
cation Program (OEP) founded
by students in 1989 through the
athletics department offers one
unit introductory courses to edu
cate the Stanford community on
wilderness travel techniques and
expose students to outdoors experi
ences such as backpacking, rock
climbing, backcountry skiing and
snow camping.
The fall quarter class (GES 7A:
An Introduction to Wilderness
Skills) is an introduction to back
country travel, the winter class is
an introduction to winter backcoun
try travel and the spring class
(GES 7C: Advanced Wilderness
Skills) is geared towards students
with advanced experience who
want to develop leadership skills.
"The goal of these introductory classes is
to develop students who have never been
outside to the point where they can lead a
trip on their own," said Vivian Ericson Ph.D.
'l4, an OEP instructor and former president
of Stanford Outdoors an umbrella organi
zation that contains many other outdoor-re
lated groups.
Student volunteers with high levels of
wilderness skills and leadership abilities
teach the classes, leading students on four
weekend-long trips to state and national
parks where they teach students to backpack
and camp in the backcountry.
In addition to teaching wilderness travel
ing techniques, the program also looks to cul
tivate skills like leadership, group dynamics
and risk-management while fostering a mul
ti-dimensional development in students, ac
cording to instructors.
"It's not just about the hard skills," said
Travis Walker M.S. 'lO, Ph.D. 'l4, an OEP in
structor. "Students come out of the class also
with the soft skills necessary for leading
their own trip."
Instructors cited the classes' introducto
ry nature as leading to a more diverse range
of students, spanning many fields and inter
ests.
"I am a biology Ph.D. student, and I get
to talk to undergraduate anthropology ma
jors," Ericson said. "Normally that just
wouldn't happen."
Instructors also represent diverse ori
gins. One OEP instructor had previously at
tended the United States Military Academy
at West Point and was highly proficient in
group dynamics and leadership. Another in
structor, a Knight Fellow from the Stanford
Graduate School of Journalism, shared his
experience serving in a military division that
focused on mountain travel.
Despite the range of expertise, friend
ships and a deep sense of community often
arise from the classes, according to Walker.
"You have a group of people who don't
know each other come into the class, but over

the course of eight weeks, they spend eight
nights together in the back country and real
ly get to know each other," Walker said.
"They build a strong community, and many
students and instructors still go on trips to
gether after the class, or outside of OEE"
Elise Deßuysser 'l3 said that she en
joyed the class, learning enough to lead her
own trip this spring and also becoming in
volved in the broader Stanford outdoors
community.
"Ultimately it got me hooked on the
backcountry and gave me skills to confident
ly do these trips outside of a class setting,"
Deßuysser said. "It also motivated me to
learn more about the places I visit and do se
rious planning ahead of time for safe and fun
excursions."
