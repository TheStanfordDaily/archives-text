For students enrolled in the win
ter quarter course GES 7B: An In
troduction to Wilderness Skills,
picking up cold weather survival
skills dressing in multiple layers
to keep warm, preparing food out
doors by lighting coals and building
shelters with snow barriers encir
cling them â€”is both a practical
and academic imperative.
"In the wilderness, everyone is
cold and miserable there are not
many resources," said Jeff Chen
'l3, one such student. "It's harder
to delegate tasks, decide on who
does what and to manage relation
ships in this setting. But we learned
how to depend on each other."
Each quarter the Outdoor Edu
cation Program (OEP) founded
by students in 1989 through the
athletics department offers one
unit introductory courses to edu
cate the Stanford community on
wilderness travel techniques and
expose students to outdoors experi
ences such as backpacking, rock
climbing, backcountry skiing and
snow camping.
The fall quarter class (GES 7A:
An Introduction to Wilderness
Skills) is an introduction to back
country travel, the winter class is
an introduction to winter backcoun
try travel and the spring class
(GES 7C: Advanced Wilderness
Skills) is geared towards students
with advanced experience who
want to develop leadership skills.
