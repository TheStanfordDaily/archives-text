## HENNESSY, INDUSTRIALIST LOOK TO FUTURE OF COMPUTING 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
After seven years as a professor in the elec
trical engineering department, President John
Hennessy took a sabbatical from Stanford in
1984 to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. and
commercialize his work with RISC processing.
The company went public shortly thereafter and
enjoyed great success as the pioneer of MIPS
architecture. Sir Hossein Yassaie is the CEO of
Imagination Technologies Group, which ac
quired what is now called MIPS Technologies
last year to use in future CPU development.
The Daily sat down with both Hennessy and
Yassaie to talk about the acquisition as well as
the history of MIPS and the realities of informa
tion technology and startup companies.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you just ex
plain a little bit about how things happened
with the early days of your company and
what led up to this point with the MIPS tech
nology?
John Hennessy (JH): The MIPS [Micro
processor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages]
architecture had its roots in a research project
here at Stanford started in the early 1980s with

the simple question: What would the age of sin
gle chip CPUs mean for how we should design
processors? Stanford, together with Berkeley
and IBM, really ... stumbled upon an incredible
discovery about a better way to design instruc
tion sets for modern computers than had been
previously thought about.
And I say "stumbled upon" because really
what happened was the constraints of having to
fit a processor with the limited number of tran
sistors at that time meant that we had to rethink
the whole process of how to design the interface
between the software system and the hardware
system. That's what led to the fundamental dis
covery, but I think it wasn't until some years lat
er that people really realized how fundamental it
was.
In fact, in the beginning there was a lot of
skepticism. The IBM project was kept secret for
many years, and people didn't know about it.
And it became very easy for many people in the
industry to say, "This is a bunch of crazy aca
demics here this isn't really a great idea." It
had to prove itself over time.
We started the company not because we
wanted to be entrepreneurs. We were, in fact, re-

President John Hennessy, who led the team that invented the MIPS framework in the '80s, said that the chip architecture is uniquely suited to emerging and mobile computing markets due to its energy and cost efficiency.
luctant entrepreneurs we started
the company originally because a fa
mous computer scientist convinced
us that, if we didn't start the compa
ny, the technology would just lan
guish on the shelves. [The technolo
gy] was very threatening to the ex
isting players out there and their
machines, and if they adopted this
technology, it was going to obsolete
their products.

Gordon Bell was then the
founder of the second-largest com
puter company [Digital Equipment
Corporation], and he said, "You've
got to go do this yourself, otherwise
you're going to have a bunch of pa
pers sitting on a shelf that nobody's
ever going to use." And, in retro
spect, it turned out to be very in
sightful.
In fact, one of the founders of
MIPS helped me found the compa
ny, because when IBM cancelled the
project, he so believed in this tech
nology that he said, "I'm not going
back to IBM. If you guys want to do
something here, I'm in."

And, at the time, people were
making big computers that cost a lot
of money. Room-sized. And we were
talking an improvement by a factor
of five in cost, conservatively and
maybe a factor of 10. So it was a big
change. People were thinking,
"Well, I'll just sell fewer computers,
and I'll make less money" instead of
saying, "Suppose you delivered that
much power—what could it do in
terms of what could it do and how
many people could afford them?"
They didn't see that, and it was ear
ly on.
And that's another reason I say
it often takes an entrepreneur to re
ally take it out there, somebody's
who is really been involved in the
creation of something. If you're in
volved in it, you see the glass as half
full. Yeah, there are some problems
to be solved, but the key insight is
there. Everybody else sees the glass
as half empty and says, "This isn't
going to work. This is a research
project."
I still remember this funny story
I was on a panel with Dave Pat
terson, who was doing a similar proj
ect at Berkeley with IBM. And
somebody says to him, just after we
had started the company "You know
Hennessy here on the panel? He just
got a million dollars to invest from
the venture capitalists, and he's go
ing to start this company. If this
technology's not going to work, what
should he do? Take the money and
go to South America." [Laughing]
TSD: How does acquiring MIPS
accelerate your activities at Imag
ination, and what was the think
ing behind the move?
Hossein Yassaie (HY): We funda
mentally believe the processor mar
ket is a big market and is an area
that is growing. As I think John
touched on, this market started with
areas such as game consoles, embed
ded applications and mobile phones
and tablets, which is a very big area.
On the horizon, everyone talks
about connected devices and Inter
net updates. We went from tens of
millions to hundreds of millions to a
few billion, and now I think we're
heading toward tens of billions of
things which are clever and smart,
so the process of business is very im
portant for us.
We're a key IT company with sig
nificant customers, so we've had the
development internally since 1995,
and it's very much a philosophy
along the same lines as MIPS in
what we were working on in terms of
multithreading and RISC architec
tures. But it's just in the last year in
discussion with the MIPS executives
and team [that] it became clear that
there is a mechanism for us acquir

ing MIPS in a structure that doubles
the team size.
We [had] about 200 people on our
processor team, and now we're dou
ble that, and that combination means
[that], both in terms of capability and
know-how, this brings additional
ecosystems to us. Particularly with
the fact that MIPS is in the Android
tree — that means our processors
getting where we want to be with the
processor technology sped up, both
in times of resources and where we
are in the marketplace.
TSD:Does the MIPS architec
ture's efficiency in cost and in
power make it more attractive in
low-cost markets in the future?
HY: One of the major constraints
in mobile devices is that they are not
capable of plugging into power. So
you have a set power envelope that
you have to live with. And not only
that, but consumers also have expec
tations they have every day. They
want it be to be as good as their PCs.
Now going forward, everything
needs to be smart, everything needs
a CPU and power is still a con
straint. We certainly believe MIPS is
one of the most efficient architec
tures that exists on this planet and
certainly have expectations and as
pirations that it will grow from this
base with the amount of energy we
can put behind and become a big
player in the market space.
JH: Efficiency has become the
key issue that's the key phrase. It
was less important early on when
people were not as cost sensitized.
It's one thing when you're building
computers that cost several thou
sand dollars. It's another when
you're building a smartphone that
only cost $2OO or you're building an
embedded device that may only cost
$5O or $25. Then it's a completely dif
ferent game.
TSD: Now that the technology is
out there, how do you balance
turning a profit with the need to
keep improving and innovating
with the architecture?
HY: We are a public company,
and I can tell you that, when you are
a public company, you have to keep
many people happy, internal and ex
ternal, and it's a tough challenge.
But my approach to these things is
that, at the end of the day, I am a
mathematician and a scientist and
an engineer.
I'm doing what I'm doing be
cause I think there's a good chance
of success. Of course profit and rev
enue is important, but not at the ex
pense of doing the wrong thing. You
have to have a balance you cannot
jeopardize the long term for the

short-term decisions, particularly in
IT business.

JH: I think this is true for not
just tech companies, but all compa
nies right now. The fundamentally
difficult problem is keeping long
term innovation alive and doing that
while keeping your current business
running, which you have to do. If
you're a public company, the share
holders will desert you quite quickly.
But all companies have that fun
damental problem of how do you
keep that innovation engine alive be
cause that's the secret of growth and
taking advantage of new markets
and new opportunities.
TSD: If you were to go back to
when you first started this work,
could you have anticipated this
level of success with the MIPS ar
chitecture? And when you're look
ing back 50 years from now, what
do you hope people are saying
about it?
JH: We knew that we had discov
ered something fairly fundamental
we understood that. We didn't un
derstand how all the pieces fit to
gether.
You never know what the suc
cesses will be like. Especially when
you're at a small company, and
you're fighting for your life, and
you're up and down. At one point,
the company was down to 10 days of
operating capital this was many
years ago in the early 'Bos but
with 10 days of operating capital,
you have to do something or you're
going to be out of business shortly.
And that's what its like for start
up companies. The fact that the ar
chitecture bloomed, it really
bloomed with this movement out in
to the embedded space. And I'm ex
cited to see Imagination pick up and
build on this incredible history and
take this to the next level as we go
forward. I think the world is going to
get better, and we're going to see
lots of interesting breakthroughs
and uses of this technology, and I'm
excited to see Imagination do it.
HY: The industry needs alterna
tive CPUs giving choice to people,
and we certainly recognize the his
tory of MIPS, and our aim is to de
velop and safeguard and be a good
custodian taking this architecture
forward and creating a kind of solu
tion in IT that many customers can
use and commit to for the long
range.

chitecture? And when you're look
ing back 50 years from now, what
do you hope people are saying
about it?
JH: We knew that we had discov
ered something fairly fundamental
we understood that. We didn't un
derstand how all the pieces fit to
gether.
You never know what the suc
cesses will be like. Especially when
you're at a small company, and
you're fighting for your life, and
you're up and down. At one point,
the company was down to 10 days of
operating capital this was many
years ago in the early 'Bos but
with 10 days of operating capital,
you have to do something or you're
going to be out of business shortly.
And that's what its like for start
up companies. The fact that the ar
chitecture bloomed, it really
bloomed with this movement out in
to the embedded space. And I'm ex
cited to see Imagination pick up and
build on this incredible history and
take this to the next level as we go
forward. I think the world is going to
get better, and we're going to see
lots of interesting breakthroughs
and uses of this technology, and I'm
excited to see Imagination do it.
HY: The industry needs alterna
tive CPUs giving choice to people,
and we certainly recognize the his
tory of MIPS, and our aim is to de
velop and safeguard and be a good
custodian taking this architecture
forward and creating a kind of solu
tion in IT that many customers can
use and commit to for the long
range.

After seven years as a professor in the elec
trical engineering department, President John
Hennessy took a sabbatical from Stanford in
1984 to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. and
commercialize his work with RISC processing.
The company went public shortly thereafter and
enjoyed great success as the pioneer of MIPS
architecture. Sir Hossein Yassaie is the CEO of
Imagination Technologies Group, which ac
quired what is now called MIPS Technologies
last year to use in future CPU development.
The Daily sat down with both Hennessy and
Yassaie to talk about the acquisition as well as
the history of MIPS and the realities of informa
tion technology and startup companies.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you just ex
plain a little bit about how things happened
with the early days of your company and
what led up to this point with the MIPS tech
nology?
John Hennessy (JH): The MIPS [Micro
processor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages]
architecture had its roots in a research project
here at Stanford started in the early 1980s with

the simple question: What would the age of sin
gle chip CPUs mean for how we should design
processors? Stanford, together with Berkeley
and IBM, really ... stumbled upon an incredible
discovery about a better way to design instruc
tion sets for modern computers than had been
previously thought about.
And I say "stumbled upon" because really
what happened was the constraints of having to
fit a processor with the limited number of tran
sistors at that time meant that we had to rethink
the whole process of how to design the interface
between the software system and the hardware
system. That's what led to the fundamental dis
covery, but I think it wasn't until some years lat
er that people really realized how fundamental it
was.
In fact, in the beginning there was a lot of
skepticism. The IBM project was kept secret for
many years, and people didn't know about it.
And it became very easy for many people in the
industry to say, "This is a bunch of crazy aca
demics here this isn't really a great idea." It
had to prove itself over time.
We started the company not because we
wanted to be entrepreneurs. We were, in fact, re-


IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
President John Hennessy, who led the team that invented the MIPS framework in the '80s, said that the chip architecture is uniquely suited to emerging and mobile computing markets due to its energy and cost efficiency.
luctant entrepreneurs we started
the company originally because a fa
mous computer scientist convinced
us that, if we didn't start the compa
ny, the technology would just lan
guish on the shelves. [The technolo
gy] was very threatening to the ex
isting players out there and their
machines, and if they adopted this
technology, it was going to obsolete
their products.

Gordon Bell was then the
founder of the second-largest com
puter company [Digital Equipment
Corporation], and he said, "You've
got to go do this yourself, otherwise
you're going to have a bunch of pa
pers sitting on a shelf that nobody's
ever going to use." And, in retro
spect, it turned out to be very in
sightful.
In fact, one of the founders of
MIPS helped me found the compa
ny, because when IBM cancelled the
project, he so believed in this tech
nology that he said, "I'm not going
back to IBM. If you guys want to do
something here, I'm in."

And, at the time, people were
making big computers that cost a lot
of money. Room-sized. And we were
talking an improvement by a factor
of five in cost, conservatively and
maybe a factor of 10. So it was a big
change. People were thinking,
"Well, I'll just sell fewer computers,
and I'll make less money" instead of
saying, "Suppose you delivered that
much power—what could it do in
terms of what could it do and how
many people could afford them?"
They didn't see that, and it was ear
ly on.
And that's another reason I say
it often takes an entrepreneur to re
ally take it out there, somebody's
who is really been involved in the
creation of something. If you're in
volved in it, you see the glass as half
full. Yeah, there are some problems
to be solved, but the key insight is
there. Everybody else sees the glass
as half empty and says, "This isn't
going to work. This is a research
project."
I still remember this funny story
I was on a panel with Dave Pat
terson, who was doing a similar proj
ect at Berkeley with IBM. And
somebody says to him, just after we
had started the company "You know
Hennessy here on the panel? He just
got a million dollars to invest from
the venture capitalists, and he's go
ing to start this company. If this
technology's not going to work, what
should he do? Take the money and
go to South America." [Laughing]
TSD: How does acquiring MIPS
accelerate your activities at Imag
ination, and what was the think
ing behind the move?
Hossein Yassaie (HY): We funda
mentally believe the processor mar
ket is a big market and is an area
that is growing. As I think John
touched on, this market started with
areas such as game consoles, embed
ded applications and mobile phones
and tablets, which is a very big area.
On the horizon, everyone talks
about connected devices and Inter
net updates. We went from tens of
millions to hundreds of millions to a
few billion, and now I think we're
heading toward tens of billions of
things which are clever and smart,
so the process of business is very im
portant for us.
We're a key IT company with sig
nificant customers, so we've had the
development internally since 1995,
and it's very much a philosophy
along the same lines as MIPS in
what we were working on in terms of
multithreading and RISC architec
tures. But it's just in the last year in
discussion with the MIPS executives
and team [that] it became clear that
there is a mechanism for us acquir

ing MIPS in a structure that doubles
the team size.
We [had] about 200 people on our
processor team, and now we're dou
ble that, and that combination means
[that], both in terms of capability and
know-how, this brings additional
ecosystems to us. Particularly with
the fact that MIPS is in the Android
tree — that means our processors
getting where we want to be with the
processor technology sped up, both
in times of resources and where we
are in the marketplace.
TSD:Does the MIPS architec
ture's efficiency in cost and in
power make it more attractive in
low-cost markets in the future?
HY: One of the major constraints
in mobile devices is that they are not
capable of plugging into power. So
you have a set power envelope that
you have to live with. And not only
that, but consumers also have expec
tations they have every day. They
want it be to be as good as their PCs.
Now going forward, everything
needs to be smart, everything needs
a CPU and power is still a con
straint. We certainly believe MIPS is
one of the most efficient architec
tures that exists on this planet and
certainly have expectations and as
pirations that it will grow from this
base with the amount of energy we
can put behind and become a big
player in the market space.
JH: Efficiency has become the
key issue that's the key phrase. It
was less important early on when
people were not as cost sensitized.
It's one thing when you're building
computers that cost several thou
sand dollars. It's another when
you're building a smartphone that
only cost $2OO or you're building an
embedded device that may only cost
$5O or $25. Then it's a completely dif
ferent game.
TSD: Now that the technology is
out there, how do you balance
turning a profit with the need to
keep improving and innovating
with the architecture?
HY: We are a public company,
and I can tell you that, when you are
a public company, you have to keep
many people happy, internal and ex
ternal, and it's a tough challenge.
But my approach to these things is
that, at the end of the day, I am a
mathematician and a scientist and
an engineer.
I'm doing what I'm doing be
cause I think there's a good chance
of success. Of course profit and rev
enue is important, but not at the ex
pense of doing the wrong thing. You
have to have a balance you cannot
jeopardize the long term for the

short-term decisions, particularly in
IT business.

JH: I think this is true for not
just tech companies, but all compa
nies right now. The fundamentally
difficult problem is keeping long
term innovation alive and doing that
while keeping your current business
running, which you have to do. If
you're a public company, the share
holders will desert you quite quickly.
But all companies have that fun
damental problem of how do you
keep that innovation engine alive be
cause that's the secret of growth and
taking advantage of new markets
and new opportunities.
TSD: If you were to go back to
when you first started this work,
could you have anticipated this
level of success with the MIPS ar
chitecture? And when you're look
ing back 50 years from now, what
do you hope people are saying
about it?

only cost $2OO or you're building an
embedded device that may only cost
$5O or $25. Then it's a completely dif
ferent game.
TSD: Now that the technology is
out there, how do you balance
turning a profit with the need to
keep improving and innovating
with the architecture?
HY: We are a public company,
and I can tell you that, when you are
a public company, you have to keep
many people happy, internal and ex
ternal, and it's a tough challenge.
But my approach to these things is
that, at the end of the day, I am a
mathematician and a scientist and
an engineer.
I'm doing what I'm doing be
cause I think there's a good chance
of success. Of course profit and rev
enue is important, but not at the ex
pense of doing the wrong thing. You
have to have a balance you cannot
jeopardize the long term for the

short-term decisions, particularly in
IT business.

JH: I think this is true for not
just tech companies, but all compa
nies right now. The fundamentally
difficult problem is keeping long
term innovation alive and doing that
while keeping your current business
running, which you have to do. If
you're a public company, the share
holders will desert you quite quickly.
But all companies have that fun
damental problem of how do you
keep that innovation engine alive be
cause that's the secret of growth and
taking advantage of new markets
and new opportunities.
TSD: If you were to go back to
when you first started this work,
could you have anticipated this
level of success with the MIPS ar
chitecture? And when you're look
ing back 50 years from now, what
do you hope people are saying
about it?
JH: We knew that we had discov
ered something fairly fundamental
we understood that. We didn't un
derstand how all the pieces fit to
gether.
You never know what the suc
cesses will be like. Especially when
you're at a small company, and
you're fighting for your life, and
you're up and down. At one point,
the company was down to 10 days of
operating capital this was many
years ago in the early 'Bos but
with 10 days of operating capital,
you have to do something or you're
going to be out of business shortly.
And that's what its like for start
up companies. The fact that the ar
chitecture bloomed, it really
bloomed with this movement out in
to the embedded space. And I'm ex
cited to see Imagination pick up and
build on this incredible history and
take this to the next level as we go
forward. I think the world is going to
get better, and we're going to see
lots of interesting breakthroughs
and uses of this technology, and I'm
excited to see Imagination do it.
HY: The industry needs alterna
tive CPUs giving choice to people,
and we certainly recognize the his
tory of MIPS, and our aim is to de
velop and safeguard and be a good
custodian taking this architecture
forward and creating a kind of solu
tion in IT that many customers can
use and commit to for the long
range.

After seven years as a professor in the elec
trical engineering department, President John
Hennessy took a sabbatical from Stanford in
1984 to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. and
commercialize his work with RISC processing.
The company went public shortly thereafter and
enjoyed great success as the pioneer of MIPS
architecture. Sir Hossein Yassaie is the CEO of
Imagination Technologies Group, which ac
quired what is now called MIPS Technologies
last year to use in future CPU development.
The Daily sat down with both Hennessy and
Yassaie to talk about the acquisition as well as
the history of MIPS and the realities of informa
tion technology and startup companies.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you just ex
plain a little bit about how things happened
with the early days of your company and
what led up to this point with the MIPS tech
nology?
John Hennessy (JH): The MIPS [Micro
processor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages]
architecture had its roots in a research project
here at Stanford started in the early 1980s with

the simple question: What would the age of sin
gle chip CPUs mean for how we should design
processors? Stanford, together with Berkeley
and IBM, really ... stumbled upon an incredible
discovery about a better way to design instruc
tion sets for modern computers than had been
previously thought about.
And I say "stumbled upon" because really
what happened was the constraints of having to
fit a processor with the limited number of tran
sistors at that time meant that we had to rethink
the whole process of how to design the interface
between the software system and the hardware
system. That's what led to the fundamental dis
covery, but I think it wasn't until some years lat
er that people really realized how fundamental it
was.
In fact, in the beginning there was a lot of
skepticism. The IBM project was kept secret for
many years, and people didn't know about it.
And it became very easy for many people in the
industry to say, "This is a bunch of crazy aca
demics here this isn't really a great idea." It
had to prove itself over time.
We started the company not because we
wanted to be entrepreneurs. We were, in fact, re-


IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
President John Hennessy, who led the team that invented the MIPS framework in the '80s, said that the chip architecture is uniquely suited to emerging and mobile computing markets due to its energy and cost efficiency.
luctant entrepreneurs we started
the company originally because a fa
mous computer scientist convinced
us that, if we didn't start the compa
ny, the technology would just lan
guish on the shelves. [The technolo
gy] was very threatening to the ex
isting players out there and their
machines, and if they adopted this
technology, it was going to obsolete
their products.

Gordon Bell was then the
founder of the second-largest com
puter company [Digital Equipment
Corporation], and he said, "You've
got to go do this yourself, otherwise
you're going to have a bunch of pa
pers sitting on a shelf that nobody's
ever going to use." And, in retro
spect, it turned out to be very in
sightful.
In fact, one of the founders of
MIPS helped me found the compa
ny, because when IBM cancelled the
project, he so believed in this tech
nology that he said, "I'm not going
back to IBM. If you guys want to do
something here, I'm in."

And, at the time, people were
making big computers that cost a lot
of money. Room-sized. And we were
talking an improvement by a factor
of five in cost, conservatively and
maybe a factor of 10. So it was a big
change. People were thinking,
"Well, I'll just sell fewer computers,
and I'll make less money" instead of
saying, "Suppose you delivered that
much power—what could it do in
terms of what could it do and how
many people could afford them?"
They didn't see that, and it was ear
ly on.
And that's another reason I say
it often takes an entrepreneur to re
ally take it out there, somebody's
who is really been involved in the
creation of something. If you're in
volved in it, you see the glass as half
full. Yeah, there are some problems
to be solved, but the key insight is
there. Everybody else sees the glass
as half empty and says, "This isn't
going to work. This is a research
project."
I still remember this funny story
I was on a panel with Dave Pat
terson, who was doing a similar proj
ect at Berkeley with IBM. And
somebody says to him, just after we
had started the company "You know
Hennessy here on the panel? He just
got a million dollars to invest from
the venture capitalists, and he's go
ing to start this company. If this
technology's not going to work, what
should he do? Take the money and
go to South America." [Laughing]
TSD: How does acquiring MIPS
accelerate your activities at Imag
ination, and what was the think
ing behind the move?
Hossein Yassaie (HY): We funda
mentally believe the processor mar
ket is a big market and is an area
that is growing. As I think John
touched on, this market started with
areas such as game consoles, embed
ded applications and mobile phones
and tablets, which is a very big area.
On the horizon, everyone talks
about connected devices and Inter
net updates. We went from tens of
millions to hundreds of millions to a
few billion, and now I think we're
heading toward tens of billions of
things which are clever and smart,
so the process of business is very im
portant for us.
We're a key IT company with sig
nificant customers, so we've had the
development internally since 1995,
and it's very much a philosophy
along the same lines as MIPS in
what we were working on in terms of
multithreading and RISC architec
tures. But it's just in the last year in
discussion with the MIPS executives
and team [that] it became clear that
there is a mechanism for us acquir

ing MIPS in a structure that doubles
the team size.
We [had] about 200 people on our
processor team, and now we're dou
ble that, and that combination means
[that], both in terms of capability and
know-how, this brings additional
ecosystems to us. Particularly with
the fact that MIPS is in the Android
tree — that means our processors
getting where we want to be with the
processor technology sped up, both
in times of resources and where we
are in the marketplace.
TSD:Does the MIPS architec
ture's efficiency in cost and in
power make it more attractive in
low-cost markets in the future?
HY: One of the major constraints
in mobile devices is that they are not
capable of plugging into power. So
you have a set power envelope that
you have to live with. And not only
that, but consumers also have expec
tations they have every day. They
want it be to be as good as their PCs.
Now going forward, everything
needs to be smart, everything needs
a CPU and power is still a con
straint. We certainly believe MIPS is
one of the most efficient architec
tures that exists on this planet and
certainly have expectations and as
pirations that it will grow from this
base with the amount of energy we
can put behind and become a big
player in the market space.
JH: Efficiency has become the
key issue that's the key phrase. It
was less important early on when
people were not as cost sensitized.
It's one thing when you're building
computers that cost several thou
sand dollars. It's another when
you're building a smartphone that
only cost $2OO or you're building an
embedded device that may only cost
$5O or $25. Then it's a completely dif
ferent game.
