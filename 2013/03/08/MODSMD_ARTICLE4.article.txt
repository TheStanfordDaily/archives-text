## HENNESSY, INDUSTRIALIST LOOK TO FUTURE OF COMPUTING 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
After seven years as a professor in the elec
trical engineering department, President John
Hennessy took a sabbatical from Stanford in
1984 to found MIPS Computer Systems Inc. and
commercialize his work with RISC processing.
The company went public shortly thereafter and
enjoyed great success as the pioneer of MIPS
architecture. Sir Hossein Yassaie is the CEO of
Imagination Technologies Group, which ac
quired what is now called MIPS Technologies
last year to use in future CPU development.
The Daily sat down with both Hennessy and
Yassaie to talk about the acquisition as well as
the history of MIPS and the realities of informa
tion technology and startup companies.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can you just ex
plain a little bit about how things happened
with the early days of your company and
what led up to this point with the MIPS tech
nology?
John Hennessy (JH): The MIPS [Micro
processor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages]
architecture had its roots in a research project
here at Stanford started in the early 1980s with

the simple question: What would the age of sin
gle chip CPUs mean for how we should design
processors? Stanford, together with Berkeley
and IBM, really ... stumbled upon an incredible
discovery about a better way to design instruc
tion sets for modern computers than had been
previously thought about.
And I say "stumbled upon" because really
what happened was the constraints of having to
fit a processor with the limited number of tran
sistors at that time meant that we had to rethink
the whole process of how to design the interface
between the software system and the hardware
system. That's what led to the fundamental dis
covery, but I think it wasn't until some years lat
er that people really realized how fundamental it
was.
In fact, in the beginning there was a lot of
skepticism. The IBM project was kept secret for
many years, and people didn't know about it.
And it became very easy for many people in the
industry to say, "This is a bunch of crazy aca
demics here this isn't really a great idea." It
had to prove itself over time.
We started the company not because we
wanted to be entrepreneurs. We were, in fact, re-

President John Hennessy, who led the team that invented the MIPS framework in the '80s, said that the chip architecture is uniquely suited to emerging and mobile computing markets due to its energy and cost efficiency.
