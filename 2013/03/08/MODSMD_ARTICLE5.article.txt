## Stanford alum talks Phasing Ice,' directing Filmmaker discusses climate change documentary, roots on the Farm 
### NIUNIU TEO 
Jeff Orlowski 'O7 is the director of "Chasing
Ice," a 2012 documentary nominated for Best
Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards that
examines the world's receding glaciers. Chasing
Ice, for which Orlowski won an "Excellence in
Cinematography for U.S. Documentary Film
making" award at the 2012 Sundance Film Fes
tival, focuses on the efforts of photographer
James Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey to
document the effects of climate change by cap
turing glacial recession with time-lapse cam
eras.
The Daily sat down with Orlowski to discuss
his time at Stanford, his lengthy collaboration
with Balog who he met senior year through a
mutual friend and his plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you be
come involved in filmmaking?
Jeff Orlowski (JO): My real introduction to
film was through the Stanford Film Society. It
was completely undergrad-run, with some fund
ing from the University, and it was just all stu
dents wanting to make short movies.
I got involved in the workshop through a
friend, and we worked on about 10 different
films over the course of one semester. Just hav
ing exposure to so many directors and produc
ers and working on so many projects it was
really just a lot of fun and exciting to get in
volved in something like that.
Then I took one documentary course
through the communications department, and
that was pretty much the only film production
class I took. I guess I took one experimental
video class, but that was pretty much it. And
then it was just going out and shooting and kind
of learning by doing.
I did a short film, a 40-minute film, with a
friend here senior year, and that got into a
bunch of festivals and won some
awards. And it was just kind of get
ting into the cycle of working and
getting some recognition and want
ing to keep doing it.
TSD: What were your original ca
reer plans?
JO: Before this, I wanted to be a
photographer, and before that, I re
member in high school debating if I
wanted to be a photographer, a pro
fessional mountain biker or a pro
grammer.
TSD: How did you get involved in
"Chasing Ice?"
JO: I started working on this
film when I was still here, but we
weren't really planning on making
a film at the time. The goal really
was just to shoot video to capture
what this guy James was doing,
which was a photography project.
TSD: Did you and James come up
with this idea together?
JO: He came up with the idea to
do these time-lapses that was
his original concept. My main goal
at first was just to shoot video and
document all of it. I kept traveling
and shooting, and it was about a
year and a half into the project
when I finally convinced him to
make a movie. It wasn't something
he was interested in at first we
didn't have the resources, we didn't
have the experience, so he was
originally not that interested in
making the film, but after a while
he realized the potential it would
have.
TSD: Was it hard balancing film
ing with schoolwork?
JO: I finished my classes two se
mesters early... so it didn't conflict
with any classes I was doing. So I
was just doing shoots on campus
with friends and getting to travel
and work with James. I started my
spring break of senior year and
went to Greenland two weeks be
fore graduation. It was fun.
TSD: What was the most difficult
part of making the film?
JO: The fundraising was proba
bly the most difficult, and, second
to that, the editing process, be
cause I had very little experience in
both those things. The shooting out
in the field was the easy part, for
me and for most of our team.
We were all experienced
campers and outdoors people. And
the conditions were harder than I
had expected, but you learn how to
adapt with that. When it's cold, you

can learn how to deal with how cold
it is. But the other aspects of build
ing the team and making some
thing of this scale are much more
difficult to do.
TSD: Would you say the film is
more a portrait of Balog or a de
piction of climate change?
JO: We originally intended for it
to be just a portrait of James. We
originally wanted it to just be
called "The Photographer," and it
was just of his personal life and his
photographic career. And the ice
project was ...just a theme in his
work.
[But] we realized, through
screening it to a lot of people, that
we were missing the bigger story
that focusing on James' individ
ual story was too small of an issue
and that we had the resources, the
footage and the story itself to tell
the story about climate change
through James.
So we shifted to that, and there
are still some remnants of the orig
inal film in there, but instead of
looking at it as a story of James, I
look at it instead as a story of Ex
treme Ice Survey, and James is that
glue that made that project happen.
It's his entire past career's worth of
work that got him to that point.
TSD: At what point did you real
ly adopt the climate change
cause?
JO: I never really felt like I was
an environmental activist, and I
still don't like that phrase I
think of myself more as a humani
tarian than an environmentalist.
But I was always aware of the is
sue, and I wasn't really doing any
thing about it.
The process of making this film
really pointed out how horrific
some of these consequences are.
What the scientists are telling us is
coming down the line and it's
some really tough stuff really
compelled me to want to do more
about it. So I think we're trying to
use the film to shift opinion now.
That wasn't the original goal,
but seeing the impact it had on peo
ple, we wanted to have that impact,
and we wanted to recognize how
significant this is.
TSD: Were there any moments
when you felt like you were in
too deep?
JO: Many times. But, like I said,
before we were making a film, I
never felt that. At first, I was just
following James for the ride. But
when we started working on the
film, I had this thing that wasn't
being accepted into film festivals,
that was just being rejected regu
larly, and I just thought that I was
an artistic failure, and that all this
effort and time that we were put

ting into this movie was just going
to be a regular, poorly made inde
pendent film.
That's what I was bracing my
self for, and just kept editing it and
working on it, and it finally just
kind of came together.
TSD: How did your film get into
Sundance?
JO: Sundance is amazing in that
it's a very merit-based submission
system. We submitted once and got
rejected. Then, we re-submitted 2
years later, after we had spent a lot
of time working on the film, and
they ultimately accepted the movie.
TSD: How did it feel seeing your
documentary screened for audi
ences?
JO: It's been amazing to see
how through something you kind of
spend five years working on in iso
lation and the editing process is
difficult and lonely and you see
it received by the public in such an
enthusiastic and supportive way.
It's amazing how different those
emotions feel. I mean, you can feel
down in the dumps and then feel
like you're changing the world. And
it's been a great learning process
it's been a great evolution going
through that. It's hooked me more
and more to wanting to make films
that audiences can engage with.
TSD: Were you surprised by the
reaction to the film?
JO: I definitely did not expect it
to be as overwhelmingly positive as
it's been. It's been amazingly sup
portive. The reviews online, the
recognition from audiences, it's
been very strong. So that was be
yond my expectations for sure.
TSD: What do you see yourself
doing in 10 years?
JO: Ideally, in 10 years, I'd like
to keep making films that can im
pact the world. I recognize the po
tential and the power that film has in
influencing change and influencing
perspective. I feel like we've really
succeeded with "Chasing Ice" in ac
complishing that goal, kind of raising
awareness about that issue. I'd like to
keep using the medium for other
projects and other subjects, both doc
umentary and narrative film.
TSD: Did you go to the Oscars?
JO: I did. It was amazing, and
so much fun. Our composer was
nominated for his song ("Before My
Time," composed by J. Ralph), so it
was just amazing to be there, and
they played the song. It was great.

TSD: Would you say the film is
more a portrait of Balog or a de
piction of climate change?
JO: We originally intended for it
to be just a portrait of James. We
originally wanted it to just be
called "The Photographer," and it
was just of his personal life and his
photographic career. And the ice
project was ...just a theme in his
work.
[But] we realized, through
screening it to a lot of people, that
we were missing the bigger story
that focusing on James' individ
ual story was too small of an issue
and that we had the resources, the
footage and the story itself to tell
the story about climate change
through James.
So we shifted to that, and there
are still some remnants of the orig
inal film in there, but instead of
looking at it as a story of James, I
look at it instead as a story of Ex
treme Ice Survey, and James is that
glue that made that project happen.
It's his entire past career's worth of
work that got him to that point.
TSD: At what point did you real
ly adopt the climate change
cause?
JO: I never really felt like I was
an environmental activist, and I
still don't like that phrase I
think of myself more as a humani
tarian than an environmentalist.
But I was always aware of the is
sue, and I wasn't really doing any
thing about it.
The process of making this film
really pointed out how horrific
some of these consequences are.
What the scientists are telling us is
coming down the line and it's
some really tough stuff really
compelled me to want to do more
about it. So I think we're trying to
use the film to shift opinion now.
That wasn't the original goal,
but seeing the impact it had on peo
ple, we wanted to have that impact,
and we wanted to recognize how
significant this is.
TSD: Were there any moments
when you felt like you were in
too deep?
JO: Many times. But, like I said,
before we were making a film, I
never felt that. At first, I was just
following James for the ride. But
when we started working on the
film, I had this thing that wasn't
being accepted into film festivals,
that was just being rejected regu
larly, and I just thought that I was
an artistic failure, and that all this
effort and time that we were put

ting into this movie was just going
to be a regular, poorly made inde
pendent film.
That's what I was bracing my
self for, and just kept editing it and
working on it, and it finally just
kind of came together.
TSD: How did your film get into
Sundance?
JO: Sundance is amazing in that
it's a very merit-based submission
system. We submitted once and got
rejected. Then, we re-submitted 2
years later, after we had spent a lot
of time working on the film, and
they ultimately accepted the movie.
TSD: How did it feel seeing your
documentary screened for audi
ences?
JO: It's been amazing to see
how through something you kind of
spend five years working on in iso
lation and the editing process is
difficult and lonely and you see
it received by the public in such an
enthusiastic and supportive way.
It's amazing how different those
emotions feel. I mean, you can feel
down in the dumps and then feel
like you're changing the world. And
it's been a great learning process
it's been a great evolution going
through that. It's hooked me more
and more to wanting to make films
that audiences can engage with.
TSD: Were you surprised by the
reaction to the film?
JO: I definitely did not expect it
to be as overwhelmingly positive as
it's been. It's been amazingly sup
portive. The reviews online, the
recognition from audiences, it's
been very strong. So that was be
yond my expectations for sure.
TSD: What do you see yourself
doing in 10 years?
JO: Ideally, in 10 years, I'd like
to keep making films that can im
pact the world. I recognize the po
tential and the power that film has in
influencing change and influencing
perspective. I feel like we've really
succeeded with "Chasing Ice" in ac
complishing that goal, kind of raising
awareness about that issue. I'd like to
keep using the medium for other
projects and other subjects, both doc
umentary and narrative film.
TSD: Did you go to the Oscars?
JO: I did. It was amazing, and
so much fun. Our composer was
nominated for his song ("Before My
Time," composed by J. Ralph), so it
was just amazing to be there, and
they played the song. It was great.

Jeff Orlowski 'O7 is the director of "Chasing
Ice," a 2012 documentary nominated for Best
Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards that
examines the world's receding glaciers. Chasing
Ice, for which Orlowski won an "Excellence in
Cinematography for U.S. Documentary Film
making" award at the 2012 Sundance Film Fes
tival, focuses on the efforts of photographer
James Balog and his Extreme Ice Survey to
document the effects of climate change by cap
turing glacial recession with time-lapse cam
eras.
The Daily sat down with Orlowski to discuss
his time at Stanford, his lengthy collaboration
with Balog who he met senior year through a
mutual friend and his plans for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): How did you be
come involved in filmmaking?
Jeff Orlowski (JO): My real introduction to
film was through the Stanford Film Society. It
was completely undergrad-run, with some fund
ing from the University, and it was just all stu
dents wanting to make short movies.
I got involved in the workshop through a
friend, and we worked on about 10 different
films over the course of one semester. Just hav
ing exposure to so many directors and produc
ers and working on so many projects it was
really just a lot of fun and exciting to get in
volved in something like that.
Then I took one documentary course
through the communications department, and
that was pretty much the only film production
class I took. I guess I took one experimental
video class, but that was pretty much it. And
then it was just going out and shooting and kind
of learning by doing.
I did a short film, a 40-minute film, with a
friend here senior year, and that got into a
bunch of festivals and won some
awards. And it was just kind of get
ting into the cycle of working and
getting some recognition and want
ing to keep doing it.
TSD: What were your original ca
reer plans?
JO: Before this, I wanted to be a
photographer, and before that, I re
member in high school debating if I
wanted to be a photographer, a pro
fessional mountain biker or a pro
grammer.
TSD: How did you get involved in
"Chasing Ice?"
JO: I started working on this
film when I was still here, but we
weren't really planning on making
a film at the time. The goal really
was just to shoot video to capture
what this guy James was doing,
which was a photography project.
TSD: Did you and James come up
with this idea together?
JO: He came up with the idea to
do these time-lapses that was
his original concept. My main goal
at first was just to shoot video and
document all of it. I kept traveling
and shooting, and it was about a
year and a half into the project
when I finally convinced him to
make a movie. It wasn't something
he was interested in at first we
didn't have the resources, we didn't
have the experience, so he was
originally not that interested in
making the film, but after a while
he realized the potential it would
have.
TSD: Was it hard balancing film
ing with schoolwork?
JO: I finished my classes two se
mesters early... so it didn't conflict
with any classes I was doing. So I
was just doing shoots on campus
with friends and getting to travel
and work with James. I started my
spring break of senior year and
went to Greenland two weeks be
fore graduation. It was fun.
TSD: What was the most difficult
part of making the film?
JO: The fundraising was proba
bly the most difficult, and, second
to that, the editing process, be
cause I had very little experience in
both those things. The shooting out
in the field was the easy part, for
me and for most of our team.
We were all experienced
campers and outdoors people. And
the conditions were harder than I
had expected, but you learn how to
adapt with that. When it's cold, you

can learn how to deal with how cold
it is. But the other aspects of build
ing the team and making some
thing of this scale are much more
difficult to do.
TSD: Would you say the film is
more a portrait of Balog or a de
piction of climate change?
JO: We originally intended for it
to be just a portrait of James. We

tential and the power that film has in
influencing change and influencing
perspective. I feel like we've really
succeeded with "Chasing Ice" in ac
complishing that goal, kind of raising
awareness about that issue. I'd like to
keep using the medium for other
projects and other subjects, both doc
umentary and narrative film.
TSD: Did you go to the Oscars?
JO: I did. It was amazing, and
so much fun. Our composer was
nominated for his song ("Before My
Time," composed by J. Ralph), so it
was just amazing to be there, and
they played the song. It was great.
