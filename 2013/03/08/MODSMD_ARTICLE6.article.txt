# ACT II
## Zimmerman moves from court to crowd 
### TOM TAYLOR DESK EDITOR 
Fans of the Stanford men's
basketball team may
have spotted a couple of
all-too-familiar faces in
the student section this
year. Towering above most of the
rest of the Sixth Man Club, two of
last year's NIT-winning stars, An
drew Zimmerman 'l2 and Jack
Trotter 'l2, have been not-so-quiet
ly making their presence felt. In
trigued by the role reversal of ath

lete-turned-fan, I sat down with
Zimmerman last week to learn the
full story.
In an interview last year, Zim
merman explained that though he
hoped to eventually study for both
an M.D. and MBA, he wasn't quite
ready to give up on basketball. His
plan after graduation was to head
off overseas and play perhaps in
Europe or Japan for a couple of
seasons before returning to school.
Those plans, though, had to be
put off when Zimmerman devel

oped an injury towards the end of
his junior year. He suffered cartilage
tears in both hips that made training
and playing progressively more
painful, but he was reluctant to have
an operation to fix the problem im
mediately.
"I chose not to have surgery af
ter my junior year because the best
case scenario was a six-month rehab
[and] the worst-case scenario was a
year, and so I figured I would just
try to manage the injury," said Zim
merman. "That went well until
about halfway through the season
my senior year... and by the end of
the season I had to sit out a couple of
games because it was difficult walk
ing, it was difficult running."
Luckily for Zimmerman, though,
he was able to stay on for an extra
year at Stanford not as a student,
but as a researcher in the School of
Medicine allowing him to keep in
touch with the physical therapists
and trainers on the basketball team
and get the best possible rehab. Sev
en months out from the last of two
operations, he played his first game
of five-on-five basketball in the last
couple of weeks and is on track to
head overseas later this year.
Exactly where he'll end up, and
what team he'll end up playing for, is,
though, still undecided.
"At the end of the day, it's what
you're willing to play for," said Zim
merman. "I'm not positive I'll find
the perfect situation, just because
I'm coming off of injury, but we'll see.
And if the perfect situation doesn't
arise, then maybe it's time to call it
quits and say 'Well, I've put eveiy

thing into it, but it's just not meant to
be.'"
Whenever Zimmerman does de
cide to finally hang up his boots, he
plans to make a career in medicine,
possibly seizing the Bay Area start
up bug and exploring medical entre
preneurship. This last year he has
been working as a life science re
search assistant in Stanford's School
of Medicine, but even before gradu
ating last June he had already been
gaining considerable experience in
his chosen field.
Zimmerman had a rather unusu
al route to the Farm, byway of first
Santa Clara and then Foothill Col
lege. So when he finally made it to
his senior year at Stanford, he need
ed just once more class to graduate
with a degree in biology. However,
NCAA rules required that he still
register for at least 12 units of
coursework, so Zimmerman spent
most of his final year working in a
plastic surgery laboratory investi
gating wound regeneration.
Talking about his longer-than
usual college career, Zimmerman
had no regrets.
"I wouldn't change it," Zimmer
man said, "and it's just one of those
things that probably helped me
grow along the way, deal with some
adversity, kind of mature to be able
to do what I did when I came to
Stanford."
He was originally recruited by
Santa Clara head coach Dick Davey,
but by the time he had made the trip
out from his home town of Oostburg,
Wise., Davey had retired. Zimmer
man did not see eye to eye with the
new setup at Santa Clara and start
ed just one game in a frustrating
freshman year.
"There's a lot that went on be
hind the scenes, good for him [Dav
ey], bad for him," said Zimmerman.

"The whole situation was a lot more
messy than what was portrayed. It
was disappointing for sure, because
he came out and recruited me. I re
ally liked him; my parents really
liked him. I really felt good about
him being my coach."
When Davey then took up an as
sociate head coaching position with
Stanford's newly appointed head
coach, Johnny Dawkins, his and
Zimmerman's paths would finally
cross again, though not immediately.
Zimmerman transferred to Stan
ford at the end of his freshman year,
but because he was not immediately
released by Santa Clara, he could
not receive a scholarship to come to
the Farm straight away. He instead
opted to spend a year at Foothill Col
lege, staying in touch as much as
possible with the basketball pro
gram and training with the team
over the summer.
Zimmerman may have started
his collegiate career as a Bronco, but
it is clear that Stanford has now won
his heart.
"The Cal game last year at home
was great," said Zimmerman. "They
came in, they had to beat us to tie for
the championship and to be able to
take that from them, being our ri
vals, was pretty awesome.
"It's serious," continued Zim
merman about the rivalry. "There's
a lot of guys on the team I don't like.
It's funny 'cause I'm sure if I played
with them I'd be buddy-buddy with
them, they'd probably be cool and
I'm sure they think the same about
us."
He likens himself to ex-Cal play
er Jorge Gutierrez, someone opposi
tion fans loved to hate, and it's easy
to see why. Standing at 6-foot-8 and
weighing in at 230 pounds, Zimmer
man stood out from the rest of the
clean-cut Cardinal last year with a

shaggy mane of hah 1 and scruffy
beard that matched his on-court per
sona.
'fAfter my junior year, they kept
bringing up Matt Howard from But
ler," Zimmerman said. "How he just
plays hard, he doesn't care what peo
ple think of him. He had the crazy
hah; unkempt. He had baggy socks,
and he just had a game that just
showed that he didn't care what oth
er people thought. He was going to
play how he played."
The clean-shaven Dawkins
turned a blind eye to Zimmerman's
new look, perhaps because it
matched his forward's approach to
every minute of every contest.
"You hear those people who say
they'd run through a brick wall,"
said Zimmerman. "Well, I felt that
that was kind of who I was, and then
my goal was to get everybody to
have that same kind of passion and
fire and work ethic and enthusiasm.
So when we stepped out onto the
court, teams saw that this is who
Stanford is, we're not the smart, ed
ucated, soft team. We're smart and
educated, and we're also willing to
run through a wall."
Though he is no longer on the
team and can no longer inspire from
the hardwood, Zimmerman has not
relinquished his motivating role.
Chest painted, caveman look still in
full swing, jumping up and down and
yelling at the opposition, he has in
stead become one of the most visible
members of the student group that
used to cheer him on from the side
lines, Stanford's Sixth Man Club.
"I remember watching Stanford
games, the Sixth Man used to be one
of the best student sections in the
country," Zimmerman said. "I did
everything as an athlete at Stanford
to try and build the basketball pro
gram, and I figured while I'm here,

lets see what I can do to help get the
student section back to the presti
gious level it was."
In Zimmerman, the team, and
the university as a whole, has a fan
that has clearly been drinking the
Stanford Kool-Aid.
"I'm a big proponent of support
ing each other as athletes," said
Zimmerman, "but even going to the
ater performances... different musi
cal events, dance events. That's just
the thing about Stanford, there are
so many amazing opportunities
[that] sometimes you don't realize
how many things you could do, or it's
overwhelming to think, 'Today
there's a soccer game, a baseball
game and a volleyball game, and I
have homework.'"
He also knows much more inti
mately than most both what it is like
to be on a college basketball team
and exactly how much work and de
termination the current players put
in not just at game time but behind
the scenes in practice. Frustrated as
he might be by losses and poor per
formances, it's a unique relationship
for any fan to have with his team and
something that makes it much hard
er to criticize coach or players.
But perhaps after his sojourn
overseas Zimmerman could be
tempted to do something a bit differ
ent. Davey praised his player's
coaching abilities in an interview last
year, and Zimmerman has been try
ing his hand at coaching kids at
Saratoga and Los Altos high schools
and helping with a basketball pro
gram in East Palo Alto. Could Zim
merman one day make it back to
Maples Pavilion to trade in his player
and fan roles for something rather
different?

cide to finally hang up his boots, he
plans to make a career in medicine,
possibly seizing the Bay Area start
up bug and exploring medical entre
preneurship. This last year he has
been working as a life science re
search assistant in Stanford's School
of Medicine, but even before gradu
ating last June he had already been
gaining considerable experience in
his chosen field.
Zimmerman had a rather unusu
al route to the Farm, byway of first
Santa Clara and then Foothill Col
lege. So when he finally made it to
his senior year at Stanford, he need
ed just once more class to graduate
with a degree in biology. However,
NCAA rules required that he still
register for at least 12 units of
coursework, so Zimmerman spent
most of his final year working in a
plastic surgery laboratory investi
gating wound regeneration.
Talking about his longer-than
usual college career, Zimmerman
had no regrets.
"I wouldn't change it," Zimmer
man said, "and it's just one of those
things that probably helped me
grow along the way, deal with some
adversity, kind of mature to be able
to do what I did when I came to
Stanford."
He was originally recruited by
Santa Clara head coach Dick Davey,
but by the time he had made the trip
out from his home town of Oostburg,
Wise., Davey had retired. Zimmer
man did not see eye to eye with the
new setup at Santa Clara and start
ed just one game in a frustrating
freshman year.
"There's a lot that went on be
hind the scenes, good for him [Dav
ey], bad for him," said Zimmerman.

"The whole situation was a lot more
messy than what was portrayed. It
was disappointing for sure, because
he came out and recruited me. I re
ally liked him; my parents really
liked him. I really felt good about
him being my coach."
When Davey then took up an as
sociate head coaching position with
Stanford's newly appointed head
coach, Johnny Dawkins, his and
Zimmerman's paths would finally
cross again, though not immediately.
Zimmerman transferred to Stan
ford at the end of his freshman year,
but because he was not immediately
released by Santa Clara, he could
not receive a scholarship to come to
the Farm straight away. He instead
opted to spend a year at Foothill Col
lege, staying in touch as much as
possible with the basketball pro
gram and training with the team
over the summer.
Zimmerman may have started
his collegiate career as a Bronco, but
it is clear that Stanford has now won
his heart.
"The Cal game last year at home
was great," said Zimmerman. "They
came in, they had to beat us to tie for
the championship and to be able to
take that from them, being our ri
vals, was pretty awesome.
"It's serious," continued Zim
merman about the rivalry. "There's
a lot of guys on the team I don't like.
It's funny 'cause I'm sure if I played
with them I'd be buddy-buddy with
them, they'd probably be cool and
I'm sure they think the same about
us."
He likens himself to ex-Cal play
er Jorge Gutierrez, someone opposi
tion fans loved to hate, and it's easy
to see why. Standing at 6-foot-8 and
weighing in at 230 pounds, Zimmer
man stood out from the rest of the
clean-cut Cardinal last year with a

shaggy mane of hah 1 and scruffy
beard that matched his on-court per
sona.
'fAfter my junior year, they kept
bringing up Matt Howard from But
ler," Zimmerman said. "How he just
plays hard, he doesn't care what peo
ple think of him. He had the crazy
hah; unkempt. He had baggy socks,
and he just had a game that just
showed that he didn't care what oth
er people thought. He was going to
play how he played."
The clean-shaven Dawkins
turned a blind eye to Zimmerman's
new look, perhaps because it
matched his forward's approach to
every minute of every contest.
"You hear those people who say
they'd run through a brick wall,"
said Zimmerman. "Well, I felt that
that was kind of who I was, and then
my goal was to get everybody to
have that same kind of passion and
fire and work ethic and enthusiasm.
So when we stepped out onto the
court, teams saw that this is who
Stanford is, we're not the smart, ed
ucated, soft team. We're smart and
educated, and we're also willing to
run through a wall."
Though he is no longer on the
team and can no longer inspire from
the hardwood, Zimmerman has not
relinquished his motivating role.
Chest painted, caveman look still in
full swing, jumping up and down and
yelling at the opposition, he has in
stead become one of the most visible
members of the student group that
used to cheer him on from the side
lines, Stanford's Sixth Man Club.
"I remember watching Stanford
games, the Sixth Man used to be one
of the best student sections in the
country," Zimmerman said. "I did
everything as an athlete at Stanford
to try and build the basketball pro
gram, and I figured while I'm here,

lets see what I can do to help get the
student section back to the presti
gious level it was."
In Zimmerman, the team, and
the university as a whole, has a fan
that has clearly been drinking the
Stanford Kool-Aid.
"I'm a big proponent of support
ing each other as athletes," said
Zimmerman, "but even going to the
ater performances... different musi
cal events, dance events. That's just
the thing about Stanford, there are
so many amazing opportunities
[that] sometimes you don't realize
how many things you could do, or it's
overwhelming to think, 'Today
there's a soccer game, a baseball
game and a volleyball game, and I
have homework.'"
He also knows much more inti
mately than most both what it is like
to be on a college basketball team
and exactly how much work and de
termination the current players put
in not just at game time but behind
the scenes in practice. Frustrated as
he might be by losses and poor per
formances, it's a unique relationship
for any fan to have with his team and
something that makes it much hard
er to criticize coach or players.
But perhaps after his sojourn
overseas Zimmerman could be
tempted to do something a bit differ
ent. Davey praised his player's
coaching abilities in an interview last
year, and Zimmerman has been try
ing his hand at coaching kids at
Saratoga and Los Altos high schools
and helping with a basketball pro
gram in East Palo Alto. Could Zim
merman one day make it back to
Maples Pavilion to trade in his player
and fan roles for something rather
different?

Fans of the Stanford men's
basketball team may
have spotted a couple of
all-too-familiar faces in
the student section this
year. Towering above most of the
rest of the Sixth Man Club, two of
last year's NIT-winning stars, An
drew Zimmerman 'l2 and Jack
Trotter 'l2, have been not-so-quiet
ly making their presence felt. In
trigued by the role reversal of ath

lete-turned-fan, I sat down with
Zimmerman last week to learn the
full story.
In an interview last year, Zim
merman explained that though he
hoped to eventually study for both
an M.D. and MBA, he wasn't quite
ready to give up on basketball. His
plan after graduation was to head
off overseas and play perhaps in
Europe or Japan for a couple of
seasons before returning to school.
Those plans, though, had to be
put off when Zimmerman devel

oped an injury towards the end of
his junior year. He suffered cartilage
tears in both hips that made training
and playing progressively more
painful, but he was reluctant to have
an operation to fix the problem im
mediately.
"I chose not to have surgery af
ter my junior year because the best
case scenario was a six-month rehab
[and] the worst-case scenario was a
year, and so I figured I would just
try to manage the injury," said Zim
merman. "That went well until
about halfway through the season
my senior year... and by the end of
the season I had to sit out a couple of
games because it was difficult walk
ing, it was difficult running."
Luckily for Zimmerman, though,
he was able to stay on for an extra
year at Stanford not as a student,
but as a researcher in the School of
Medicine allowing him to keep in
touch with the physical therapists
and trainers on the basketball team
and get the best possible rehab. Sev
en months out from the last of two
operations, he played his first game
of five-on-five basketball in the last
couple of weeks and is on track to
head overseas later this year.
Exactly where he'll end up, and
what team he'll end up playing for, is,
though, still undecided.
"At the end of the day, it's what
you're willing to play for," said Zim
merman. "I'm not positive I'll find
the perfect situation, just because
I'm coming off of injury, but we'll see.
And if the perfect situation doesn't
arise, then maybe it's time to call it
quits and say 'Well, I've put eveiy

thing into it, but it's just not meant to
be.'"

vals, was pretty awesome.
"It's serious," continued Zim
merman about the rivalry. "There's
a lot of guys on the team I don't like.
It's funny 'cause I'm sure if I played
with them I'd be buddy-buddy with
them, they'd probably be cool and
I'm sure they think the same about
us."
He likens himself to ex-Cal play
er Jorge Gutierrez, someone opposi
tion fans loved to hate, and it's easy
to see why. Standing at 6-foot-8 and
weighing in at 230 pounds, Zimmer
man stood out from the rest of the
clean-cut Cardinal last year with a

shaggy mane of hah 1 and scruffy
beard that matched his on-court per
sona.
'fAfter my junior year, they kept
bringing up Matt Howard from But
ler," Zimmerman said. "How he just
plays hard, he doesn't care what peo
ple think of him. He had the crazy
hah; unkempt. He had baggy socks,
and he just had a game that just
showed that he didn't care what oth
er people thought. He was going to
play how he played."
The clean-shaven Dawkins
turned a blind eye to Zimmerman's
new look, perhaps because it
matched his forward's approach to
every minute of every contest.
"You hear those people who say
they'd run through a brick wall,"
said Zimmerman. "Well, I felt that
that was kind of who I was, and then
my goal was to get everybody to
have that same kind of passion and
fire and work ethic and enthusiasm.
So when we stepped out onto the
court, teams saw that this is who
Stanford is, we're not the smart, ed
ucated, soft team. We're smart and
educated, and we're also willing to
run through a wall."
Though he is no longer on the
team and can no longer inspire from
the hardwood, Zimmerman has not
relinquished his motivating role.
Chest painted, caveman look still in
full swing, jumping up and down and
yelling at the opposition, he has in
stead become one of the most visible
members of the student group that
used to cheer him on from the side
lines, Stanford's Sixth Man Club.
"I remember watching Stanford
games, the Sixth Man used to be one
of the best student sections in the
country," Zimmerman said. "I did
everything as an athlete at Stanford
to try and build the basketball pro
gram, and I figured while I'm here,

lets see what I can do to help get the
student section back to the presti
gious level it was."
In Zimmerman, the team, and
the university as a whole, has a fan
that has clearly been drinking the
Stanford Kool-Aid.
"I'm a big proponent of support
ing each other as athletes," said
Zimmerman, "but even going to the
ater performances... different musi
cal events, dance events. That's just
the thing about Stanford, there are
so many amazing opportunities
[that] sometimes you don't realize
how many things you could do, or it's
overwhelming to think, 'Today
there's a soccer game, a baseball
game and a volleyball game, and I
have homework.'"
He also knows much more inti
mately than most both what it is like
to be on a college basketball team
and exactly how much work and de
termination the current players put
in not just at game time but behind
the scenes in practice. Frustrated as
he might be by losses and poor per
formances, it's a unique relationship
for any fan to have with his team and
something that makes it much hard
er to criticize coach or players.
But perhaps after his sojourn
overseas Zimmerman could be
tempted to do something a bit differ
ent. Davey praised his player's
coaching abilities in an interview last
year, and Zimmerman has been try
ing his hand at coaching kids at
Saratoga and Los Altos high schools
and helping with a basketball pro
gram in East Palo Alto. Could Zim
merman one day make it back to
Maples Pavilion to trade in his player
and fan roles for something rather
different?
