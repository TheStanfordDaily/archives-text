## Senate talks grad students, education 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports from Vice Provost
for Graduate Education Patricia Gumport M.A. 'B2 M.A.
'B6 Ph.D. 'B7 and Dean of the Graduate School of Edu
cation Claude Steele at its meeting Thursday.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, professor of civil and
environmental engineering, opened the meeting by not
ing that Senate discussion of a proposal to substantially
adjust course scheduling and class starting times would
be postponed until May in an effort to promote further
discussion of the contentious changes.
That delay will mean that the proposed changes, if
approved by the Faculty Senate, would not be imple
mented until the 2014-15 academic year.
Gumport opened her presentation by identifying
three significant challenges for the University as a
whole graduate student funding, graduate popula
tion diversity and preparing doctoral students for a
range of career paths and acknowledging the inher
ent limitations of the Office of the Vice Provost of Grad
uate Education's efforts to address those issues.

"We are really decentralized," Gumport said. "It's
difficult to resolve challenges that transcend depart
ments. Some of the challenges we face are exacerbated
by our decentralized structure."
Reviewing the funding sources available to graduate
students, Gumport acknowledged the potential for cur
rent and prospective reductions in federal spending to
cut into student support through mediums like research
assistantships.

Claude Steele, dean of the Graduate School of
Education, spoke to the Faculty Senate on Thursday
about the programs and objectives of his school. The
Senate also postponed discussing class scheduling.
"At all levels of the University,
we're feeling some stress and anxi
ety [about federal funding],"
Gumport said, later emphasizing
that "our top priority is to meet our
current funding commitment to
students."
She emphasized, however, the
diminished significance of external
funding for graduate students as a
whole. While external grants and
contracts provided 37 percent of a
total of $143.4 million in graduate
student funding in fiscal year 1998,
that proportion has fallen to 30 per
cent of a total of $309.2 million for
the current fiscal year. The propor
tion provided by the University's
designated and restricted funds
rose from 23 percent to 43 percent
of the total over that same period.
"It reduces the vulnerability of
graduate student funding to fluctu
ations in outside sources," Gumport
said. "We were relieved to see
that."
Gumport also announced a re
cent decision by Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 to increase
the proportion of graduate student
research assistants' support that
comes from University general
funds from 35 to 40 percent, fram
ing the move as a means of alleviat
ing pressure on faculty to find fund
ing sources.
Turning to the challenge of fos
tering diversity within the graduate
student population, Gumport em
phasized the University's focus on
increasing diversity within specific
academic departments rather than
necessarily within the population as
a whole.
While she cited increases in gen
der equality and in international
graduate student numbers as sub
stantial accomplishments for the
University, Gumport acknowledged
that progress for other groups
such as under-represented minori
ties (URM) has lagged behind.
While the absolute number of URM
graduate students increased from

1995 to 2012, the proportion of the
student body composed of URM
students fell from 10.7 to 9.3 per
cent over the same period.
Gumport highlighted diversity
initiatives currently under way but
also encouraged faculty to assume a
prominent and extensive role in op
portunities like mentoring students.
"This isn't just for students who
might be URM or women,"
Gumport said. "These are great
practices for all students ... There's
a lot we can do as faculty... This is
really a time for us to step up."
In his report, Steele focused on
the Graduate School of Education's
(GSE) broader impact, drawing at
tention to the importance of educa
tion to the broader economy and
the current struggles within the
American education system.
"We can make education
smarter, in all of its aspects," Steele
asserted.
Steele emphasized the ability of
the GSE —whose faculty has con
sistently been ranked first in the
nation by the U.S. News and World
Report —to leverage technology
and data-driven research to make
substantial advances through
means like video game-based learn
ing.
"They provide a huge opportu
nity to make education smarter,"
Steele reiterated.
Steele also drew attention to the
GSE's burgeoning partnership
with the San Francisco Unified
School District, which he hopes to
apply to other cities like Oakland or
San Jose.
"We have some encouraging in
dications that this kind of partner
ship ... can have an effect on the
overall system," Steele said.
Reviewing the years ahead,
Steele focused on the GSE's con
ceptual plan for an education clinic
and the broader objectives of ad
vancing education technology, ex
panding the amount of quality edu
cation offered to low-income stu
dents and developing a new plat
form to advance and disseminate
education research and training.

environmental engineering, opened the meeting by not
ing that Senate discussion of a proposal to substantially
adjust course scheduling and class starting times would
be postponed until May in an effort to promote further
discussion of the contentious changes.
That delay will mean that the proposed changes, if
approved by the Faculty Senate, would not be imple
mented until the 2014-15 academic year.
Gumport opened her presentation by identifying
three significant challenges for the University as a
whole graduate student funding, graduate popula
tion diversity and preparing doctoral students for a
range of career paths and acknowledging the inher
ent limitations of the Office of the Vice Provost of Grad
uate Education's efforts to address those issues.

"We are really decentralized," Gumport said. "It's
difficult to resolve challenges that transcend depart
ments. Some of the challenges we face are exacerbated
by our decentralized structure."
Reviewing the funding sources available to graduate
students, Gumport acknowledged the potential for cur
rent and prospective reductions in federal spending to
cut into student support through mediums like research
assistantships.

Claude Steele, dean of the Graduate School of
Education, spoke to the Faculty Senate on Thursday
about the programs and objectives of his school. The
Senate also postponed discussing class scheduling.
"At all levels of the University,
we're feeling some stress and anxi
ety [about federal funding],"
Gumport said, later emphasizing
that "our top priority is to meet our
current funding commitment to
students."
She emphasized, however, the
diminished significance of external
funding for graduate students as a
whole. While external grants and
contracts provided 37 percent of a
total of $143.4 million in graduate
student funding in fiscal year 1998,
that proportion has fallen to 30 per
cent of a total of $309.2 million for
the current fiscal year. The propor
tion provided by the University's
designated and restricted funds
rose from 23 percent to 43 percent
of the total over that same period.
"It reduces the vulnerability of
graduate student funding to fluctu
ations in outside sources," Gumport
said. "We were relieved to see
that."
Gumport also announced a re
cent decision by Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 to increase
the proportion of graduate student
research assistants' support that
comes from University general
funds from 35 to 40 percent, fram
ing the move as a means of alleviat
ing pressure on faculty to find fund
ing sources.
Turning to the challenge of fos
tering diversity within the graduate
student population, Gumport em
phasized the University's focus on
increasing diversity within specific
academic departments rather than
necessarily within the population as
a whole.
While she cited increases in gen
der equality and in international
graduate student numbers as sub
stantial accomplishments for the
University, Gumport acknowledged
that progress for other groups
such as under-represented minori
ties (URM) has lagged behind.
While the absolute number of URM
graduate students increased from

1995 to 2012, the proportion of the
student body composed of URM
students fell from 10.7 to 9.3 per
cent over the same period.
Gumport highlighted diversity
initiatives currently under way but
also encouraged faculty to assume a
prominent and extensive role in op
portunities like mentoring students.
"This isn't just for students who
might be URM or women,"
Gumport said. "These are great
practices for all students ... There's
a lot we can do as faculty... This is
really a time for us to step up."
In his report, Steele focused on
the Graduate School of Education's
(GSE) broader impact, drawing at
tention to the importance of educa
tion to the broader economy and
the current struggles within the
American education system.
"We can make education
smarter, in all of its aspects," Steele
asserted.
Steele emphasized the ability of
the GSE —whose faculty has con
sistently been ranked first in the
nation by the U.S. News and World
Report —to leverage technology
and data-driven research to make
substantial advances through
means like video game-based learn
ing.
"They provide a huge opportu
nity to make education smarter,"
Steele reiterated.
Steele also drew attention to the
GSE's burgeoning partnership
with the San Francisco Unified
School District, which he hopes to
apply to other cities like Oakland or
San Jose.
"We have some encouraging in
dications that this kind of partner
ship ... can have an effect on the
overall system," Steele said.
Reviewing the years ahead,
Steele focused on the GSE's con
ceptual plan for an education clinic
and the broader objectives of ad
vancing education technology, ex
panding the amount of quality edu
cation offered to low-income stu
dents and developing a new plat
form to advance and disseminate
education research and training.
