## Senate talks grad students, education 
### MARSHALL WATKINS MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate heard reports from Vice Provost
for Graduate Education Patricia Gumport M.A. 'B2 M.A.
'B6 Ph.D. 'B7 and Dean of the Graduate School of Edu
cation Claude Steele at its meeting Thursday.
Senate Chair Raymond Levitt, professor of civil and
environmental engineering, opened the meeting by not
ing that Senate discussion of a proposal to substantially
adjust course scheduling and class starting times would
be postponed until May in an effort to promote further
discussion of the contentious changes.
That delay will mean that the proposed changes, if
approved by the Faculty Senate, would not be imple
mented until the 2014-15 academic year.
Gumport opened her presentation by identifying
three significant challenges for the University as a
whole graduate student funding, graduate popula
tion diversity and preparing doctoral students for a
range of career paths and acknowledging the inher
ent limitations of the Office of the Vice Provost of Grad
uate Education's efforts to address those issues.

"We are really decentralized," Gumport said. "It's
difficult to resolve challenges that transcend depart
ments. Some of the challenges we face are exacerbated
by our decentralized structure."
Reviewing the funding sources available to graduate
students, Gumport acknowledged the potential for cur
rent and prospective reductions in federal spending to
cut into student support through mediums like research
assistantships.
