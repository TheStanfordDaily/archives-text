## Robot shows off first carbon circuit 
### NIKHITA OBEEGADOO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of Stanford re
searchers recently debuted the
first robot controlled by a com
puter chip built entirely from
carbon nanotube transistors,
which many scientists predict
may eventually replace silicon.
While scientists have pro
duced simple demonstrations of
working carbon nanotube circuit
components in the past, the
Stanford team, led by Professor
of Electrical Engineering Philip
Wong and Associate Professor of
Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science Subhasish
Mitra Ph.D. 'OO, was able to
demonstrate an actual subsys
tem composed entirely of the
material.
The project was presented in
the form of a robot named Sacha
at the 2013 International Solid-
State Circuits Conference,
which was held in San Francisco.
According to Mitra, the robot
was created to demonstrate the
development of a system that
can function despite the errors
caused by inherently imperfect
nanotubes, which have posed is
sues for research teams working
with carbon nanotubes in the
past.
"One thing we could have
done was to bring out our lab
equipment [to the conference],
but that's not really effective,"
Mitra said. "That's why we came
up with the idea of making a ro
bot which people can actually see
and interact [with]."
Mitra said that the use of car
bon nanotubes directly tackles
one of the greatest challenges
currently facing the electronic
systems industry energy effi
ciency. According to Mitra, one
of the next steps in working with
nanotubes is to demonstrate
that the energy benefits from
nanotubes derived at the level of
transistors and small circuits are
also present at the larger sub
system level.
Max Shulaker 'l2 Ph.D. 'l7,
who participated in the robot
demonstration, has been work

ing with carbon nanotubes since
his freshman year at Stanford.
According to Shulaker, research
on carbon nanotubes is impor
tant because of the material's
potential role in furthering
Moore's Law, which states that
every 18 months, the size of a
computing device is halved.
"Things get smaller, better
and more efficient. We're reach
ing that point where we can't
make things smaller," Shulaker
said. "Carbon nanotubes are the
step after making things smaller.
This can be something to keep
Moore's Law going â€”to keep
improving computing power."
Supratik Guha, director of
physical sciences at IBM's York
town Heights Research Center,
shared Shulaker's optimism
about the potential of carbon
nanotubes.
Guha said that IBM has
worked with carbon nanotubes
for 15 years. While their efforts
were initially focused on devel
oping carbon nanotubes, IBM
scientists have now focused on
the use of carbon nanotubes in
nanoscale devices as a replace
ment for silicon.
"Through several genera
tions of technology, devices keep
getting smaller and denser, and
silicon will no longer be the best
material for the purpose in
about ten years," Guha said.
"For needs that are close to
atomic dimensions, carbon nan
otubes have just the right shape
and the right electrical behav
ior."
Shulaker agreed that carbon
nanotubes cannot yet replace
silicon, but said that all of the
Stanford researchers' work is
silicon-compatible.
"That's completely intention
al, because we realize that
there's so much money and so
much drive behind silicon that
replacing it straightaway is in
feasible, but the gradual intro
duction of CNTs [carbon nan
otubes] to supplement silicon is
very feasible," he said.
