## Admissions favors select candidates 
### JUSTINE MOORE DESK EDITOR 
While high school students
around the world anxiously await
university admissions decisions,
some applicants may have less
cause for concern due to unique
privileges gained from special
connections with their schools of
choice. According to former Uni
versity admissions officers and
college admissions experts, the
difference made for those appli
cantsâ€” including legacies, chil
dren of faculty and development
cases may, in some cases,
bridge the gap between accept
ance and rejection.
Though Dean of Admissions
Richard Shaw declined to com
ment on the issue, several promi
nent University figures, including
President John Hennessy, have
supported the preferences af
forded to select applicants.

Publicizing preferences
According to the charge for
the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Undergraduate Admission
and Financial Aid (C-UAFA), the
Committee has the power to de
termine "the general criteria un
der which applicants may be giv
en special consideration because
of distinctive characteristics."

The charge lists examples of
these characteristics, including
"applicants whose parents gradu
ated from Stanford or are on the
Stanford faculty or staff, those
with highly developed specific tal
ents, members of ethnic minori
ties, or others who lend a desir
able diversity to the class."
The charge also states that
the Faculty Senate is responsible
for deciding "the general extent
of preference" given to applicants
in these special categories.

Associate Professor of Music
Mark Applebaum, chair of the C
UAFA, declined to comment on
the decisions made by this year's
Faculty Senate regarding these
preference.
This section of the charge has
been a subject of controversy in
the past, however. At a Faculty
Senate meeting on Oct. 7, 2010,
Professor of Computer Science
Eric Roberts questioned whether
or not the Committee should list
the types of applicants that could
receive special consideration.

"The idea was that these were
things were in practice already
and it was good to lay it out be
fore the committee to carry that
forward," said David Palumbo-
Liu, professor of comparative lit
erature, at the meeting. "I take
your point that by specifying it,

you draw attention to it. On the
other hand, it seems to be some
thing the public is well aware of
already."
President John Hennessy
weighed in, arguing that Stanford
should set a precedent of deter
mining its own admissions crite
ria based on the University's
needs.
"I think we will find ourselves,
as will the rest of higher educa
tion, increasingly trying to pro
tect our rights to decide who are
the best students to come to
Stanford, just as we did in the
Michigan case with affirmative
action," Hennessey said at the
meeting. "We need to protect our
right to make that decision."

Karen Cook '6B M.A. '7O Ph.D.
'73, professor of sociology, agreed
with Hennessy.
"The one advantage to this list
is it is 'truth in lending,' " Cook
said at the meeting. "I mean, this
is what we do admit legacies
and people in all these cate
gories."

Substantial number of students

Though Stanford does not re
lease statistics on the percentage
of legacies in each incoming class,
Daniel Golden, author of "The
Price of Admission: How Ameri
ca's Ruling Class Buys Its Way
into Elite Colleges and Who
Gets Left Outside the Gates" es
timated that this number fluctu
ates between 15 and 20 percent
each year.
Golden, who conferred with
sources in the Office of Under
graduate Admission while writ
ing his book, said that the major
ity of accepted legacies would not
have been admitted without the
benefit of their legacy status.
"I would say a few of them
would get in anyway because
they're remarkable students,
some would be on the bubble and
most of them would not get in,"
Golden said, adding that even if
the applicant's parents do not
give money to the University, "it
still helps to be the child of an
alum."

Jon Reider '67 Ph.D. 'B3, who
worked in the Office of Under
graduate Admissions from 1985
to 2000, agreed that legacies re
ceive a significant boost in admis
sions. He estimated that legacy
applicants are currently admitted
to Stanford at more than twice
the admit rate for non-legacy ap
plicants.
